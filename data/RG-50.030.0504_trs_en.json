        "A: No, we had a big apartment, actually it were two apartments that were opened up together.\nHalf of them was my father\u2019s offices and practice, and the other half is where we lived. I can still\nsee it in my eyes, it was a long, drawn out apartment, there was a big living room, and dining\nroom that were connected together. Then there was a long hall that was long enough for me to\nride my tricycle on. At the other end were the bedrooms, and big bathroom, and all that. And\nthen there were about three rooms that were my father\u2019s offices. One thing I remember in that\nbig hallway, we had an icebox, I mean, not a refrigerator, but an icebox. It was pink.",
        "Q: Pink?",
        "A: Pink icebox. And you know, in summer the iceman came by in his horse and buggy and\nbrought up those big pieces of ice to put in there.",
        "Q: When you say icebox, it means that there\u2019s ice that\u2019s make -- making the area cold so you can\nhave food in there, or 1s it just for ice?",
        "A: No, ice for -- like a refrigerator, but not electric.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: It was a -- I mean, we had electricity, and we had running water, and regular toilets and all\nthat, but many of the modern electrical stuff we didn\u2019t have as yet.",
        "Q: Right. And how often did this guy come with the ice, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t tell you that honestly. My guess would be about once a week.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. But they were these huge, big pieces of ice, right?",
        "A: Those huge, big pieces of ice, and --",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: Yes, it is a big difference, and we did have our fights, of course he was bigger and stronger\nthan I, sometimes very aggravating. He would just hold out his hand and I couldn\u2019t get anywhere\nnear him. But we did fine. I wasn\u2019t very aware of us being different from other kids in the\nneighborhood and the building. The building was owned by a man who has the carpentry shop in\nthe back. There was a little alley where we played in, and then there was this big factory, where\nyou heard the machinery going almost day and night. Well, not night of course, but I do\nremember that very well.",

        "A: Um.",
        "Q: When you said that you didn\u2019t feel different --",
        "A: We were little bit on the outskirts, not a suburb like you see here, but in a working class area.\nNot in the downtown area of our little town. And most of the Jewish family lived more in the\ndowntown area. So there were not too many Jewish people living there, but we -- the town\nwasn\u2019t that big to begin with --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so we had good contact with them. The streetcar ran right in front of our house, and\nstreetcar was a single track. And in the front of our house there was a bike path. So when one\ncame from one side, the other one had to wait --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- for it to come from the other side. And -- but we walked most places. We walked to school,\nand walked to the synagogue and all that.",
        "Q: Were you religious, was the family religious [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, not religious at all. My mother\u2019s family was religious, but we were not at all, my father\nwas not at all. However, we did belong to the synagogue with -- my parents had the respective\nseats there. On high holidays that men sat downstairs, the women upstairs.",
        "Q: So it was -- was it Orthodox?",
        "A: It was Conservative --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- it wasn\u2019t Orthodox.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- side, but --",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t go on a regular basis every week, you went on holidays?",
        "A: We did go frequently on Friday night.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: In fact, we also attended what we would call Sunday school here, but actually Hebrew school.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And three boys and three girls always got called up for Kiddush onto the beamer, and the joke\nwas that my brother didn\u2019t care for the wine but he had to drink it, but I enjoyed it every time\nthat I got up there.",
        "Q: Enjoy --",
        "A: My mother was more religious than my father, but we didn\u2019t keep kosher or anything like\nthat.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did -- did your mother light candles on Friday night?",
        "A: Most of the time.",
        "Q: Most of the time, uh-huh.",
        "A: And quite often we had friends over for Friday night dinner.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But, you know, candle lighting was about as far as we went. My mother did fast on yi -- Yom\nKippur.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: Not until I was Bar Mitzvah and then I fasted and most of the time still do.",
        "Q: Really? That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: But that\u2019s about the only thing I\u2019m sort of keeping.",
        "Q: It is. Right. So what was home life like? Did you all eat lunch together since your father was\nworking there? Did he take off lunchtime and have lunch with you?",
        "A: Not necessarily, he --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- but we had lunch -- we had servants, we had the -- my father had a nurse for his office. We\nhad a live in maid.",
        "Q: Oh, you did?",
        "A: And she took care of the house, but she didn\u2019t take care of the kids, my mother took care of\nmy brother and I.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: We took many walks. The little town was quite picturesque. Had nice parks that we went\nthrough. And my father, having lived there for such a long time, was well known in the city. Old\ntype physician, he got called out at night quite frequently.",
        "Q: So he was well known as a physician as well.",
        "A: As a physician as well --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- especially in the neighborhood that we were in.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Was he a general practitioner?",
        "A: Yes, he was.",
        "Q: So he did all sorts of things, but he didn\u2019t do surgery, I gather?",
        "A: He did not do surgery. There were other people who were there who did surgery.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And took trips to the little farms outside, and I often went with him. I remember going with\nhim on a -- to a farm and get s -- got scared when all these big dogs and what have you came\nsnooping around the car while he was in there with his patient. And as I got a little older, learned\nto ride a bike, many of the calls he made were by bicycle, and I went with him on a bicycle. It\nwas on one of those trips where I was riding in front of him, and we talked back and forth, all of\na sudden I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t get an answer. I look around and I see him off the bike, he had had a\nheart attack.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: A very severe heart attack. It was a friend of ours, not living too far from where we were, we\nwent to her house and called a taxi to take us home. And this was his first, and very severe heart\nattack.",
        "Q: Huh. And do you remember what year that was? Was that befor -- must have been before\nKristallnacht.",
        "A: Yes, this was before Kristallnacht. It was maybe one or two years before that.",
        "Q: So you were quite young?",
        "A: I was six years old or so.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: So your brother was not traveling with your dad on bicycle, just --",
        "A: No, my brother went through the elementary school in our town, and then when it came for\nhim to go to high school he was transferred to Breslau.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Now called Wroclaw, where my mother\u2019s family lived. And he lived with one of my uncle\nand aunt\u2019s and attended school there. So he wasn\u2019t home at the time.",
        "Q: I see, I see. So did your dad go to the hospital, or did he stay home?",
        "A: He stayed home.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: He got taken care of at home.",
        "Q: Was he then able to go back to his medical practice after the heart attack, or did that --",
        "A: Yes, but it took quite a few months.",
        "Q: It did?",
        "A: Quite a few months, and he was all right then. It was probably -- probably in early 1938,\nbecause after he got well, we decided to move to a smaller apartment. And it was in that smaller\napartment where we then experienced the Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: I see. So Hitler and the Nazis take over in 1933, so you\u2019re -- there -- something is going on.\nDo you notice a change --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- as you\u2019re growing up?",
        "A: I -- I didn't notice a change, really, because all I knew was --",
        "Q: Was that.",
        "A: -- Hitler.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I mean, all I knew was the Nazi government.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, at three years you have no knowledge of what is going on.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: The street we lived on, there were often parades moving along the street, and as a little child\nyou love -- you love a parade --",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: -- you like to be out there and cheering them on with the other kids. And somehow I knew\nI\u2019m not supposed to cheer these people on. But it was very difficult for me to fully understand\nwhat there was.",
        "Q: Right. Did your parents talk to you about this --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- at all, and say, you know, don\u2019t go out there, be careful, or --",
        "A: Th -- be careful, don\u2019t go out there, and tha -- but they left it fairly open. [indecipherable]\nother words, they didn\u2019t make too much of a deal out of it. But I always knew certain things we\ncan\u2019t do. Just certain rules we as Jews couldn\u2019t do. Because my parents had a live in maid, they\ncelebrated Christmas in a way, in fact we had a Christmas tree. The maid wanted it of course,\nand so we celebrated Christmas. And one year my parents called my brother and I together and\nsaid, we\u2019re not going to celebrate Christmas any more, we\u2019re going to celebrate Chanukah from\nnow on. And our main question was, will we still get gifts.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And long as that was the case, we didn\u2019t care.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t care, right. Now, did your maid have to leave at -- I -- I\u2019m assuming that she was not\nJewish, the maid?",
        "A: She was not Jewish.",
        "Q: Did she have to leave your household at a certain point?",
        "A: Yes. A certain point, the law came about that she had to be, I think fo -- 35 or 45 --",
        "Q: I think it\u2019s 45 [indecipherable]",
        "A: 45 old, and this was a very young person, and she had to leave the house at midnight,\nDecember 31\u201c, whatever year it was. And she stayed til the very last minute, and then left. And\nmy parents actually found somebody else, 40 f -- was just 45, to take over. This person had been\na cook in a sanitarium, she knew how to cook very well, and she taught my mother how to cook.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The second -- they were both called Marthe, the second Marthe. And when we moved into the\nsmaller apartment and she didn\u2019t come wi -- come with us.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t come. So when you had the maid, the maid was cleaning and cooking, and --",
        "A: Cleaning and cooking.",
        "Q: -- your mother was taking care of the two of you.",
        "A: Right. Of course, the maid was there as a babysitter --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- when my parents wanted to go out.",
        "Q: So you spent a lot of time with both of your parents, I gather.",
        "A: Lot of time with my mother, because my father was --",
        "Q: Was working, right.",
        "A: Working quite hard. But we frequently took vacations. In fact, we were fairly close to the\nCzech border.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And over a weekend we would go into Czechoslovakia, just to get out of there.",
        "Q: Right. And how would you travel, by train?",
        "A: By car.",
        "Q: By car? You had a car?",
        "A: My father had a car. The car was not parked at the house because you couldn\u2019t, you know, it\nwas in a garage maybe a mile away.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And you had to get it from there. But we traveled by car all over the place, quite often. Then\nwhen we went into Breslau to live with my mother\u2019s family, we often went by train.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And my grandmother, when she came to visit us, came by train. And where my brother was\ngoing to school in Breslau, on the weekend he came home and frequently I used to pick him up\nat the train station and we would walk home, just the two of us.",
        "Q: Right, right. Did you miss him when he was away? When -- or was it actually nice for you to\nbe able to be alone in the house?",
        "A: [honestly can\u2019t answer that. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay, right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I -- I guess it was a little bit of both.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He was always my big brother, he was always there to help me out, all my life. And I don\u2019t\nknow whether I felt it\u2019s nice to be alone.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t think I did. Because I went to school by this time also.",
        "Q: You started school when, when you were six or five?",
        "A: Six.",
        "Q: When you were six.",
        "A: But when I was five years old I went to a nursery school, a kindergarten, I mean --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- here we -- it\u2019s part of the school system, there it was separate. The same lady was in charge\nof that kindergarten that was in charge when my brother went there. And by this time it was 1935\nor SO.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And, you know -- you know, it\u2019s 1935, and I remember very clearly the door ringing at our\nhouse, and I opened the door. There is Miss Schroeder with a big bouquet of flowers, and tears in\nher eyes, coming to see my mother. Well, it turned out that one of the other kids, five year old\nkid, his parents objected to t-to being -- to having a Jew in his kindergarten class. So this was my\nfirst experience of anti-Semitism. So obviously I had to leave, and Miss Schroeder couldn\u2019t do\nanything, and this guy was also a physician, the father of this other kid. So I had to leave. But\nthis was shortly before I had to enter regular school. And when my mother took me to school my\nfirst day of school, it turned out that that same kid would be in the same class as me. So she went\nto the principal, explained the situation, and he put me into a parallel class. Turned out that I was\nthe only Jewish kid in the whole school, but at least I wasn\u2019t in with this one.",
        "Q: And no one else complained, it was this -- it was this --",
        "A: I-In the kindergarten it was this particular person. And I made friends in school, like any kid.\nGot real friendly with two other boys, they were separate, boys and girls were separate in that\nschool. And one kid had a birthday party, he invited me, the other one was fine, and of course\nmy time to have a birthday party, I invited both of them, they both said they\u2019d come. The next\nday one of them said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my parents won\u2019t let me come.\u201d",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And I remembered his name, his name was Webber, his last name was Webber. Many years\nlater, I was in the amer -- I was this G.I. in the American army, stationed back in Europe, and I\ntried to make contact with my former teacher. And somebody wrote me, my name is Webber,\nyou must remember, you went to school with my brother, and basically they wanted some help.\nSo I wrote him back, yes I remember him very well. You didn\u2019t want to have any contact with a\nJew, now you do? But the nice thing at that point was that I made contact with my grade school\nteacher. He was a wonderful person. When Crystal Night came about, I went to school. The\nsynagogue was far enough away from us that I didn\u2019t see what was going on, we were not in the\ndowntown area where all this Jewish retail stores got ruined. And I found out in school what had\noccurred. And when I came home, my mother received me at the door in tears. My father had\nbeen called out to somebody who had been beaten by the Gestapo. And while he was in that\nperson\u2019s house, they came to our house to -- for my father. He was then picked up at his patient\u2019s\nhome and taken to prison. And after that, every day, this teacher, his name was Thiel, came and\nsat on -- next to me on my chair, is your dad home yet? Every day. After five days my da -- dad\ndid come home. The chief of police in our little town took it upon himself not to send anybody to\nthe concentration camp that had been an officer in the German army. And as a physician, my\nfather was a lieutenant during World War I, so after five days he came home. Right after he came\nhome the word came out that Jews are not allowed to go to public school any more. So they kept\nme home, my parents kept me home. Mr. Thiel, when he saw me on the street afterwards, would\nstop his -- jump off his bike, he used to travel around bike, and see how I was doing. And when\nmy birthday came around, he came to our house to bring all the papers, and all the books that I\nhad. And he told my mother he was so glad that I didn\u2019t show up that day because the principal\nsent somebody in, you\u2019ve got the only Jew in the whole school, send him home. And he hadn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t have to do that in front of the other kids. So I got in contact with him in 1951 - \u2019?52. We\nhave corresponded for awhile, he was in a little town too far off the beaten track --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- for me to visit him.",
        "Q: But he must -- he was quite different, right, he just --",
        "A: He -- he -- he wasn\u2019t --",
        "Q: -- he must have been taking a chance to do what he was doing.",
        "A: He took a big chance --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- with what he was doing.",
        "Q: How did this affect you [indecipherable] as a little boy? Do you re -- do you remember?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to answer that, how it affected me, it\u2019s -- in a way I took it in stride. It\nbecame normal. The discrimination against you became a normal thing. Sounds ridiculous if I\nsay it now, but that\u2019s the feeling I have.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: No, but it makes sense. It becomes part of the pattern of your life.",
        "A: It becomes the pattern of life -- excuse me -- as I said, my brother was in Breslau, and he was\nin Breslau at Crystal Night.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He came home somehow or another, just be with us. But shortly after that was his birthday,\nhis 13\" birthday, his Bar Mitzvah. There was no Torah left in Liegnitz because the synagogue\ngot burned. So he brought his Torah home from Breslau. Some of the little shuls were in areas\nthat they couldn\u2019t burn, and there was a few Torahs left. He carried one on the train from Breslau\nback to Liegnitz. And we had the Bar Mitzvah in our house. And where we lived, that smaller\napartment, the second and third floor was a Jewish old age home, and we shared a larger\napartment with another family. And that\u2019s where we had his Bar Mitzvah. Many people had\ncome home from concentration camp. This is 1938. We have -- the family showed that they have\nintentions of leaving, they got out of the concentration camp.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I remember these people coming home with shaven heads.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Were you told where they had come from?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: You had.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, concentration camp was an everyday word. An uncle of mine, the one that my\nbrother lived with, in the family, he was taken into concentration camp earlier than Kristallnacht.\nThere was some activity, I forgot what they called it, where if you had any -- done anything\nillegal years before, you end up -- you got taken into prison again. My uncle did some cheating, I\nguess, on the income tax, I don\u2019t know, at one point it got punitive action, he paid his penalty,\nbut that wasn\u2019t enough. They used that excuse to take him. And he couldn\u2019t take it, he went up\nagainst the electric fence, got killed right then and there. My mother had a picture of him in\nShanghai, and had it on one of the tables, a man came in one time, he said, I know this man. I\nsaw him getting shot against the ca -- against the fence.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: This is your mother -- one of your mother\u2019s brothers?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband.",
        "Q: Sister\u2019s husband, I see.",
        "A: And, so all these things were told to me, I heard about them.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Was all part of our life.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They had sent their son to England to go to school, Cambridge. That\u2019s why they had the room\nfree for my brother to live in.",
        "Q: Right. Do -- and your brother came back after Kristallnacht?",
        "A: He came back -- I\u2019m not even sure at this point whether he continued his schooling in Breslau\nor not.",
        "Q: Or not, uh-huh.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t go back to a regular school.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I had the young woman come in to sta -- give me tutoring, private lessons.",
        "Q: And the Bar Mitzvah, was that in your house, or was that in the -- the home for the aged?",
        "A: In the home for the aged.",
        "Q: I see. So were there a number of people there?",
        "A: There\u2019s quite a few people there.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, and a little anecdote, my mother had a big dinner for everybody and turned out that it\nwere -- we were 13 people. She was superstitious, so she quickly called a good friend who was a\nbachelor to come join us.",
        "Q: That\u2019s great. We\u2019re going to have to change the tapes.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Okay. I think we forgot to get the name of your brother.",
        "A: Oh, my brother\u2019s name is 0 -- as he was born was Hans.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: H-a-n-s. But he changed it to Henry when we became Americanized.",
        "Q: American. And did he take the n off? The double --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So it -- he\u2019s Culman too, with one n?",
        "A: With one n. The only one who wouldn\u2019t take it off was my mother. She said, \u201cI married your\nfather with two n\u2019s and I\u2019m going to keep the two n\u2019s.\u201d",
        "Q: Keep it that way.",
        "A: And my father had already passed away by that time.",
        "Q: I see. Before we get to what happens after Kristallnacht, let me just ask you w-w -- ho-how\nyou remember being in the house? Was it a -- a very cheerful kind of home to be in, was it\nserious, or it was a combination --",
        "A: No, it was a ch -- it was a cheerful home. We had no, you know, I have no bad memories of\nthat at all. Played out in the backyard with the other kids, and played cowboys and Indians and\nwe got dressed up, and these were all non-Jewish kids that lived in that area.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The river was not -- was two or three blocks away. And in winter that\u2019s where we dragged our\nsled and sled -- sled down the side of the riverbank. In the spring and summer it was a beautiful\narea to walk. I remember walking there with my mother and at the end of the trail, bu -- there\nwas some farmyard which usually had some piglets there, and so -- it\u2019s all very pleasant\nmemories. The unpleasant parts were like I mentioned, the fact that I got kicked out of nursery\nschool, had the problems in school, then couldn\u2019t go there. But most of the unpleasant memories\nare actually things I heard about. You know, my parents talked about this person got taken to jail\nfor whatever reason, that person disappeared. And most of it didn\u2019t really get bad for me until\nKristallnacht.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did your -- did your parents take you to the f -- was there a theater, were there\nchildren\u2019s theater, do you have any recollection?",
        "A: No, th --",
        "Q: Was there movies?",
        "A: There was movies.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] movies.",
        "A: There were movies.",
        "Q: And did you like the movies?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Saw Laurel and Hardy, and things like that.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: But there was a theater that my parents attended, I mean adult theater, but I don\u2019t remember\ngoing to the theater at all. [indecipherable] And movies you didn\u2019t go that often.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In summer there was ice cream stands, it wasn\u2019t like here where you could eat ice cream all\nyear long, you just ate it in summer.",
        "Q: Summertime, right.",
        "A: And then once in a ye -- once a year a circus came to town, I remember going to that. But I\nhad no unpleasant mem -- personal memories.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Personally, they didn\u2019t get bad. Eventually, after I\u2019ve said this I realize that that wasn\u2019t quite\ntrue. There used to be kids that used to attack me and start hitting on me, called me a Jew, and all\nkinds of names. But didn\u2019t happen that often. When I came home from Hebrew school, I\nremember once being attacked by three or four kids. It was --",
        "Q: Did they hurt you?",
        "A: Well, not seriously, you know.",
        "Q: Did you fight back?",
        "A: No, [ ran.",
        "Q: You ran. Probably smarter with three or four kids against you, right?",
        "A: Yeah. The other thing that I remember is 1n school there were religious classes, and that\nreligion was taught in school. My initial teacher, Mr. Thiel used to tell me, well, just sit in class\nand don\u2019t participate. And then one year I got another teacher and he had me leave the classroom\nfor the religious class. And some of the other kids had s -- said, I didn\u2019t know you were Jewish.\nThey didn\u2019t realize I was. And that was tough because I went outside, I was the only one in the\nwhole school, for an hour. It wasn\u2019t long enough to go home, so I just wandered around the area\nand then got back into class. So the fact that I was set aside was hard to take.",
        "Q: Now your f -- your father had his heart attack, 1t was 1936, am I right?",
        "A: No, I-I think it was either \u201937 or \u201938.",
        "Q: Soa--a--",
        "A: Just --",
        "Q: -- so maybe a year before Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did he lose his job at this point as a doctor?",
        "A: Oh he -- no, he --",
        "Q: Was he not allowed to practice, or he was?",
        "A: He was still allowed to practice, and at one point he was not allowed to practice any more\nexcept for Jews.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: In our town -- I don\u2019t know how many Jewish doctors there were, but he was the one that was\nassigned to practice for Jews.",
        "Q: And do you remember a significant difference in -- in -- in him, once that happened?",
        "A: Yes. He became much more serious to me, much more ver -- worried about everything.\nSeriously starting to talk about emigrating, getting out of Germany. Started to check into going\nto Palestine. And this was before Crystal Night. Then, after Crystal Night we made contact with\nfar enough relatives in the United States. Our papers at the office, the Palestine office got burned,\nso everything there got -- had to be started from scratch again.",
        "Q: This was burned during Kristallnacht?",
        "A: Crystal Night.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: And, you know, in my mind as a child, I was looking forward to this big trip we\u2019re going to\ntake someplace, somewhere. And some people started talking about going to Shanghai.\nShanghai, being an international city, it -- you didn\u2019t need any papers, any visas, or anything like\nthat. All you needed was to get on a ship and get there. But it had a bad reputation, and people\ndidn\u2019t want to go there, including my parents. So one time after Crystal Night, we had friends\nover the house for a dinner -- I don\u2019t know if it was a Friday night dinner or not, but one person\nsaid, you know what? I\u2019m not sticking around her any more. I\u2019m going to Shanghai. Second\nperson said I\u2019Il join you, my father said, I'll join you. If that wouldn\u2019t have happened, we\nprobably would have been stuck in Germany. By this time we had an affidavit from the United\nStates and in my parent\u2019s mind we\u2019ll go to Shanghai for a year or two until our number gets\ncalled up and then we go to the States.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how we eventually ended up in Shanghai.",
        "Q: Did they tell you anything about Shanghai when they si -- made this decision? Or had you\nheard that this was --",
        "A: I just heard --",
        "Q: -- that this was a strange place.",
        "A: It\u2019s a strange place, you know, I looked it up on an atlas where it is. In the meantime, my -- a\ncouple of my uncles her -- moo -- moved to Panama, and I followed on the atlas where they\nwent, you know, we all -- all the trips of course were by ship, it wasn\u2019t by plane. So he stopped\nat many different places. And I was looking forward to this adventure. So we decided to go on a\nDutch liner instead of a German or Italian like most people did. The advantage on a Dutch liner\nis that the so-called board money, you could take right out. The Germans allowed you x number\nof dollars, or marks, of course, to take on board the ship, to spend on the ship, but not to take off\nthe ship. So when you went on a German liner, they strictly adhere to that. On the Dutch liner\nthat we went to, the purser said to my father, well didn\u2019t you lose x number of dollars gambling\nlast night? Didn\u2019t you buy a box of cigars? And all that was written down and two days after we\nleft Europe, he had all his money in his pocket.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Whatever amount that was.",
        "Q: Do you remember packing for Shanghai?",
        "A: Oh yes, very well.",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: To get all your heavy stuff on, you got from the freight company something they called a lift,\nwhich was like a big box, size of a room, and everything gets put in there. And when you were\npacking that, somebody from the Gestapo was there watching what you were packing. Well,\nwhen they came to do this packing, my mother sent me outside to play. And I had some play\nmoney, which was back from the German inflation in the 20\u2019s, had absolutely no value. And she\nwas getting ready to pack that, and the guy from the Gestapo was -- put up a fuss, you can\u2019t take\nthat. And she was arguing, that\u2019s my kid\u2019s play money, it has no value. I don\u2019t know for sure any\nmore whether we left -- let him keep it or not, but I told my mother, \u201cLet him have it, I don\u2019t\ncare.\u201d You know, it\u2019s just play money.",
        "Q: So did you come in and out when --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- when these guys were there?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I walked in and --",
        "Q: Were they nasty? What were they like?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: They were actually a little nasty at the beginning and then my mother gave them a drink, and\nthey calmed down a bit. And some of the little knickknacks that we had, she gave one person this\nand one person that. It wasn\u2019t really bribery in any sense, but it softens them up in a way.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And my parents also had the idea that maybe we can get off the ship somewhere before we\nget to Shanghai. I mean, India was still part of Britain, the Philippines was part of the United\nStates, Singapore was part of Britain. We thought we could maybe get off there.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So they decided that this lift with all our belongings should be kept by the freight company\nuntil they got the word from us.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Instead of going on the shi --",
        "A: Instead -- instead of being shipped at the same time as we were.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I mean, the ship we were on was a passenger ship, it wasn\u2019t a freighter, and the lift would\nhave to go on a freighter. The -- obviously we didn't get off anyplace. Ended up in Shanghai and\nthen contacted the freight company, she -- send it to us, this is our address. But in the meantime\nit\u2019s July of 1939. By the time this lift gets onto a freighter 1t\u2019s September, and the war breaks out.\nAnd all German ships get the signal, go into a neutral port. The Dutch is -- East Indies, which are\nnow Indonesia, were still neutral, so the ship ran into a neutral port in Dutch East Indies, and we\nhad to pay a fair amount of money to get it from there to Shanghai.",
        "Q: Get it to Shanghai.",
        "A: But eventually we got it all.",
        "Q: When -- when your mother was packing the lift, did you have to pack a little suitcase, or did\nshe pack it for you?",
        "A: She packed it.",
        "Q: She packed it.",
        "A: She packed it all. I mean, I didn\u2019t do any packing per se.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t? Were you able -- did she take any toys for you?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we took some toys.",
        "Q: Or games?",
        "A: Games, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you -- so you had that on the ship with you?",
        "A: We had some of it on the ship, and some of it was on the freight -- in the -- in the lift. So I had\na few toys, to [indecipherable]",
        "Q: This is a long trip. You go to Genoa, right, so you have to take a train to Genoa.",
        "A: We took a train to Genoa. We took a train through Germany to say good-bye to relatives.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My father\u2019s brother was in Upper Silesia. We had tried to talk him to join us in shan -- to\nShanghai and he refused. So we went there, we went to Berlin to say good-bye to some former\nfriends and relatives and to the western -- I mean, we really did a whole tour around Germany by\ntrain and eventually came to Genoa.",
        "Q: And what happened to your car? Did your father sell the car?",
        "A: I guess he sold it, I mean --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I never thought about that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But he must have sold it. When we came to the border, they had everybody get off -- not\neverybody, all the Jews get off the train to be searched, body searched. And this was middle of\nthe night, I was fast asleep. So my mother said to the Gestapo, SS guy, whoever he was, \u201cCan I\nleave my kid here?\u201d He says, \u201cYou can if you want to, but I\u2019m not guaranteeing that the train\nwon\u2019t take off without you.\u201d So she woke me up. I did not have to strip, but my parents did. And\nthe amount of money that my father was allowed to take out, he had more on him than he was\nallowed to, he telegraphed that to his brother. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Oh, he was able to --",
        "A: Send --",
        "Q: -- to do that.",
        "A: -- to do that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So we took out only what was legal. At this point my father didn\u2019t want to mess anything up\nfor a few dollars. And then we went on the train to Genoa, and my mother\u2019s sister, whose\nhusband had been killed in the concentration camp earlier, was living in Milan. And she came to\nsay good-bye to us. And her train and our train came together. I was walking through the train\nand all of a sudden there\u2019s Tante Trude. I ran into her arms. And she came to Genoa with us and\nsaw off -- saw us off from the pier. I can still see her waving to us as we were leaving.",
        "Q: And she felt okay staying in Italy?",
        "A: Well, her s -- husband had been killed.",
        "Q: Killed, right.",
        "A: Her only child, her son, was in England, so she eventually got to England.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: By the time te -- she got to England --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- he had managed to go to Palestine and join the British Brigade at Palestine. And eventually\nshe joined him in Palestine.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] each place that she went.",
        "A: She was always -- she would -- she was telling us later on the ship was blacked out that she\ntook from England to go to Palestine. She went to Palestine legally.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: This was before the illegal --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- immigrations. But it was in middle of the war. But she was there to see us off, and\neventually we got to meet her -- meet up with her again.",
        "Q: Right, right. So how do you remember this ship trip, which was really long?",
        "A: It was -- took about six weeks.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I have a tendency to get seasick very easily.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know that beforehand. But the Dutch liner was a luxury liner and they had special --\nin the dining room the children were not allowed to eat with the parents and I hated that idea. So\nI was in a separate room with the little kids, you know, the two and three years old --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- and o -- me at nine years old, I felt I was big enough to do that, you know, to be with my\nparents.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t like that at all.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you would still see land when I got seasick the first time. I don\u2019t know whether that has\nto do with seasickness or just anxiety about being left alone. But eventually it got alright, had\nping pong tables, I learned to count to 21 in -- in Dutch.",
        "Q: Did you? Had you played ping pong before?",
        "A: Yes, we --",
        "Q: You had?",
        "A: We had, so --",
        "Q: So that was fun.",
        "A: That was a lot of fun.",
        "Q: Were there -- were there a lot of kids? Were there kids your age on this trip?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: There were.",
        "A: Yeah, well, mainly Dutch kids and my brother s -- kids, there was a big swimming pool and I\ndidn\u2019t know how to swim yet, but my brother did, and he enjoyed that a great deal. And I had a\ngood time on the ship.",
        "Q: Now, there were two other couples, right? Mr. and Mrs. Ritter?",
        "A: Mr. and Mrs. Ritter, and Mr. and Mrs. Braun, Braun, and a Mr. Salinger. We were nine\npeople altogether. Mr. and Mrs. Braun were the people that we shared this apartment with in\nGermany -- in Liegnitz.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They had three children, they had left Germany before that. One went to Argentina, one went\nto Holland, and one went to England.",
        "Q: So they were older kids?",
        "A: They were older kids. Little older, not that much older.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Teena -- late teenagers --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- I believe, or maybe early 20\u2019s, or -- I have no idea. And they -- it was very tragic what\nhappened to them, the -- we were in Shanghai for about a year when they got a telegram from\nArgentina that their son had committed suicide down there. Reason, of course I don\u2019t know.\nTheir other son who went to Holland was caught up by the Nazis --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and disappeared. And their daughter survived in England, that\u2019s who they went to after the\nwar. The Ritters had two sons, the younger of which was my brother\u2019s age, the other one was a\nlittle bit older.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they had gone to Palestine before that, and they were in Palestine. The Ritters went --\nwent to them when the war was over. When we all left Shanghai they went to Palestine. Mr.\nRitter had a heart attack on the ship the day it landed in Palestine. And whether he got to\nrecognize his son or not, I don\u2019t know, but his sons were able to see him before he died. Mr.\nSalinger is another interesting story. He was married to a non-Jewish woman, they had a son.\nShe would not go with him to Shanghai, so they divorced. The son was eventually drafted into\nthe German army. When the war was over, he went back to her.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And lived in what became East Germany. His son survived also.",
        "Q: Right. That\u2019s quite a story.",
        "A: But the f -- this group of nine people, once we got to Shanghai, we rented a house -- actually\nwere some more people, I mean -- it was the equivalent of a townhouse, and we all lived in there.\nHenry and I -- Hans became Henry ba -- were the only children, so my family had two rooms, all\nthe others had one room. They had a joint kitchen, everybody cooked together.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And eventually made that into a luncheon area for other people. But especially the Ritters saw\ntheir sons in my brother and I.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: As I started school in Shanghai they were always interested in how I did, and so on.",
        "Q: So they were sort of like another set of parents or at least some kind of relative in some way?",
        "A: Yeah, well we were close to them --",
        "Q: Close.",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t consider them relatives, I think they considered us more their children --",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: -- than we considered them our parents.",
        "Q: So not so close with the Brauns?",
        "A: Oh, just as close with the Brauns.",
        "Q: Just as close.",
        "A: Yes. And sal --",
        "Q: And Salinger?",
        "A: -- sal -- also --",
        "Q: Also, so it --",
        "A: -- wi -- wi -- also, was very cl -- very closely --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- knit group.",
        "Q: When you first arrived and saw Shanghai and saw this strange port with all these small boats,\nbig boats, whatever, what -- what did you think? Was it exciting to you?",
        "A: Exciting and scary both.",
        "Q: And scary, yeah.",
        "A: Everything was so strange. First of all, Shanghai, the waterfront 1s called the Bund, which\nprior to World War II had these giant, beautiful buildings, high rise buildings right around, they\nlook very impressive. But then you saw these coolies, these are the workman. When they took\nthe heavy stuff and carried it on bamboo sticks, walking one man in front, one man behind on\nbamboo sticks, in a singsong voice so they kept their tread going so they moved smoothly. This\nwas weird to see. Then you saw the rickshaws, where a man actually pulling a little wagon all\nalong the street. And then the poverty, the beggars on the street, crippled to some degree, trying\nto beg stuff. And Mrs. Ritter had a sister who was in Shanghai already, they actually were there\nto welcome us. They said, well most of the refugees are moving into the Hongkew area.\nHongkew was a part of Shanghai that had been devastated during the war between the Japanese\nand the Chinese. Many refugees, most refugees ended up there and started to rebuild the area.\nPeople were put into what was referred to as homes. One room per family, large rooms where\npeople were living together. And everybody warned us against that, so this is where we didn\u2019t\nwant to go. So the first thing we did was go into a hotel on Bubbling Well Road and stayed there\nfor awhile, well I stayed there while the adults went out shopping for a place to live.",
        "Q: Now is this where you played \u201cTroubles\u201d with the staff?",
        "A: This -- this is where --",
        "Q: And what is that game?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s -- the German name for it is Mensch Argere dich Nicht. I\u2019m not quite sure what it is\ncalled in England, but it\u2019s a board game.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And while they were going around, I sat down there in the hotel lobby, whoever wanted to\nplay with me, played with me. I won every game, I don\u2019t know if it was purposely or not, but it\nkept me busy, it kept me from running around. But looking at it back now, my parents left me as\na nine year old kid in a strange hotel.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But nothing happened, I\u2019ve ha -- I had fun, people enjoyed having a little kid there. And these\nwere not necessarily Chinese, these were Americans, British, French, all kinds of people.",
        "Q: So is this in the in -- what they call the International Settlement?",
        "Q: In the International Settlement, and the house that we -- they eventually found, belonging to\nanother person, I don\u2019t know if he was leasing it, or what, but we subleased the house, was in the\nFrench concession.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Rue Ratard. In French, everything was [indecipherable]. And that\u2019s where we eventually\nended up.",
        "Q: Now yo -- did you stay in that hotel before they found the house, or were you able to run\naround the streets some? Did you go walk with your brother?",
        "A: I walked with my parents a little bit.",
        "Q: A little bit. Was --",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember too much of that.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t?",
        "A: No. But it\u2019s -- when I, 50 years later went back to revisit Shanghai, we stayed at a very fancy\nhotel in approximately the same area. So I rec --",
        "Q: As the ho -- as the house, the townhouse?",
        "A: As -- no, as the other -- as the other hotel.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It was on the same street. That hotel wer -- I couldn\u2019t find any more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Burlington Hotel was the name of it, but I couldn\u2019t find that. But there was this very\nfancy, modern hotel, which I believe was built up in approximately the same area.",
        "Q: Same place. Did you recognize the area when you went? Did it look sim -- similar --",
        "A: Well, part of it, I did.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My wife and I were -- went walking, I said, \u201cYou know, down this street, I believe is where\nmy school used to be.\u201d She said, \u201cWell let\u2019s go.\u201d So we walked down there, I said, \u201cIf I\nremember correctly there was a big wall, a cement wall around it, and behind the wall was a\nsynagogue and this Jewish school.\u201d",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And bingo, there it was.",
        "Q: It was.",
        "A: The school was now a government building. We couldn\u2019t go into it, but I recognized it.",
        "Q: My goodness.",
        "A: And the synagogue was there, it became sort of a museum, and we were able to go into it.\nAnd those things I recognized.",
        "Q: Wow. Okay, we have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay, just let me go back a second, do you remember when you got off the ship to go into\nShanghai, did you get into trucks?",
        "A: Lot of people did, and they were transported by trucks to the homes or other places in\nHongkew.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to remember, I don\u2019t know whether we went by -- h-how we got to that hotel. I\nimagine we went by cab, but I couldn\u2019t tell --",
        "Q: Not by rickshaw?",
        "A: No, we used rickshaws later on, but I don\u2019t believe we took rickshaws to the hotel, however I\n-- my memory fails me on that one.",
        "Q: Do you remember what the mood of everybody was? Were people very anxious? Could you -",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think as a nine year old child I could --",
        "Q: That you would -- yes.",
        "A: -- detect that. I know that we -- the ship docked on the other side of the river, you know,\nShanghai is along a river, and we took like a little ferry boat --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- to the Custom House area where we came in, and on that ferry boat, there was somebody\nfrom the Jewish community, from Jewish committee in Shanghai who sort of clued us in a little\nbit. But what he clued us in 1s, he showed us the Garden bridge, the bridge going over the\nSuzhou creek on one side of which was the International Settlement under British control and the\nother side was already under Japanese control. And he told us that you have to walk across this\nbridge, you can\u2019t drive across it, that you have to show your papers to the Japanese guard, and\nthe Chinese people that are crossing there always had to take off their hat and bow down to the\nJapanese. And somebody made s-some remark, well, what are we coming to here? It sounds as\nbad as what we\u2019ve left behind. And that of course, is where the homes were, that\u2019s where the\nmost refugees began to live. But we, somehow or another didn\u2019t go there. We ended up at this\nBurlington Hotel.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And as I say, I don\u2019t recall how we got there.",
        "Q: Do you remember being registered anywhere?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, you just walked in?",
        "A: We just walked in. I bi -- I mean -- obviously we had to register at the hotel, but --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- not registered as --",
        "Q: But not at any formal --",
        "A: Formal [indecipherable]. I imagine we did, but I don\u2019t remember any [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t remember -- you didn\u2019t have to carry papers or anything?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. My parents had to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- they had their German passports still, with the big J in it. And we as children were listed in\nthat passport --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t have our separate passport.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have your own. Ha -- do you remember how long you stayed in that hotel? Was it\na couple of weeks, was it --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t too long.",
        "Q: A few da -- it wasn\u2019t too --",
        "A: Be -- maybe a week or two.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And then you moved to the French Concession, which was more south, closer to the\nharbor, I guess. Or not?",
        "A: No, actually not, no --",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: -- it\u2019s -- the French Concession stretched along, you know, mi-might say it\u2019s parallel to the\nInternational Settlement. The French Concession had the nicer living quarters. Even today it still\nhas --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- the nicer living quarters. And what I do remember is like, the streetcars that could only go\nup to one point and then you had to take another streetcar on the other side. And there were\ntrolley cars that were driven by electricity, but no tracks. So the electricity was different in the\nFrench area that it was in the in -- in the International Settlement.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: When they got there, one guy jumped off the car, they took a running start, pulled the wires\ndown, ran across the street and then hooked the wires back up on the other side. And that\u2019s how\nyou got from one end to the other. It wasn\u2019t too far away because from there I was able to walk\nto school.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And school was in the International Settlement.",
        "Q: It was in the International Settlement?",
        "A: It was a Jewish school.",
        "Q: Just called the Shanghai Jewish school, is that where you went?",
        "A: The Shanghai Jewish school.",
        "Q: And did you go there fairly quickly from when you ca -- you came in July --",
        "A: No, we came in July of -- and they were overcrowded there, and I had a hard time -- my\nparents had a hard time getting us registered. Eventually we did, but by this time it was\nSeptember, or October. I think it was after the Jewish holidays.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The principal, he was called Reverend Brown. Course, was all British schooling, and my first\nday in school they had a dictation. I ac -- should go back a little bit to -- when I was being\ntutored in Liegnitz, I was also tutored in English.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So for about half the year I had some English lessons. And that was my whole experience in\nEnglish. Now I come into this class, it\u2019s being taught in English, we have a dictation, where you\nwrite down everything. The teacher knows I -- where I came from, so she corrected every word I\nmisspelled, which was practically every word. You\u2019ve never seen so much red ink on one piece\nof paper. But it didn\u2019t take long. They put me in a class a year younger than I was --",
        "Q: They put you in second grade?",
        "A: I guess it was second grade, I had not -- I don\u2019t even remember for sure what grade, they\ncalled it form, the British school.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Form. But I was -- I mean, the kids in class were a year younger than I.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And after a year I caught up enough to be put into my regular class.",
        "Q: And was everything taught in English?",
        "A: Everything was taught in English. But as a child, you pick this up very quickly. The other\nchildren were help -- the teachers were helpful. Some of the other kids were refugee kids that\nwere there a little longer than I, they helped. I joined the Cub Scouts, right -- you know, about a\nyear later.",
        "Q: And your brother was in the Boy Scouts?",
        "A: Boy Scouts, and --",
        "Q: So your brother was in fifth grade, or sixth grade, something like -- whatever -- whatever the\nequivalent --",
        "A: What -- I do -- I don\u2019t remember what number --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- it was, but he was obviously four years ahead of me, however, he only went to school for\nabout a year and a half.",
        "Q: And then he went to work.",
        "A: And then he was sent to work.",
        "Q: Right. So, are your parents learning English at all?",
        "A: Very little, very --",
        "Q: Very little. So you\u2019re speaking German at home?",
        "A: At ho -- home we spoke German, in school we spoke English.",
        "Q: Spoke English. And is there a common language in Shanghai or 1s just -- English just one of\nthem because there\u2019s so many languages?",
        "A: English was the main language that you were able to [indecipherable] get along with.\nObviously it\u2019s Chinese, but even Chinese wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] I mean, the Shanghai dialect is\nquite different from Mandarin, which is the main language of China today. My brother picked up\nChinese --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- where he worked. I never did, other than a few words here and there, some which you --\ncurse words you learn very easily in every language. But my parents lived within this Jewish --\nGerman Jewish community.",
        "Q: In the French Concession.",
        "A: In the French Concession, we had [indecipherable] contact with other people. My father tried\nto open a practice, he actually took an office for about a year or so in the International\nSettlement. But the refugees as a rule did not come to him because they didn\u2019t have any money,\nthe Chinese didn\u2019t come to him. He had recommendation to two -- to two physicians, and they\nwere very nice to us, they helped my father out, taught him something about [indecipherable]\ndiseases. But all in all my father was not able to make a living from his practice. He tried all\nkinds of things. One time somebody offered him a job in the leprosy colony, my mother put her\nfoot down on that. She said, that we don\u2019t need.",
        "Q: She thought he would catch it?",
        "A: Leprosy is -- you know, has a bad name to it.",
        "Q: Bad reputation.",
        "A: Very bad reputation. And -- but one time somebody was looking for my father and I said, well\nhe\u2019s in that hospital over there. And I said well come on, I\u2019Il -- P\u2019Il take you there. And I took off\nwith these two complete strangers to show them where my father was. My mother was horrified.\nYou know, you hear about kidnapping and all that kind of stuff. But I was perfectly at ease to do\nthat. And we walked to school every day and I caught up fairly quickly with my class.",
        "Q: So what was your father doing?",
        "A: Sat around.",
        "Q: Sat around.",
        "A: Doing nothing. Became very depressed. Eventually these nine people decided to open up a\nlittle lunch room, you know? Noon time was the main meal that you ate in Europe. There were a\nlot of people there who didn\u2019t know how to cook, pi -- single bachelors, what have you. They\nloved the lunch room, but inflation went -- was so rampant, that we didn\u2019t make any money. We\nbasically paid for our own food. And my father acted like a maitre d\u2019, you know, welcoming\npeople, seating them, etcetera. In between he still practiced a little bit. My mother did most of the\ncooking. The other men did the shopping, they used to go out and come back on the rickshaw\nwith all the food. There wasn\u2019t much refrigeration there, so you had to buy the food the same day\nthat you were cooking it.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know for how many years that lasted, but it lasted for a little while. My mother\nalso baked cakes for people. And what we loved is when one of the cakes didn\u2019t come out right.\nThen --",
        "Q: So you could have it.",
        "A: -- that was not good enough to sell, but --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- good enough for us to eat.",
        "Q: So she learned well enough from Marthe how to cook?",
        "A: She -- she learned -- she became an excellent cook.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But cooked everything in the German style. I mean --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- no Chinese food, per se. She took the Chinese vegetables, and somehow or another --",
        "Q: Made them into German.",
        "A: -- made it into German food, which is, of course, what everybody loved.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She also adj -- when -- once we got our furniture, she got her sewing machine, and she started\nsewing for people. So she did -- whatever money we made, was made by her.",
        "Q: Right. So your father must have been really demoralized by this.",
        "A: Terribly demoralized.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the end result of that was that my brother took on the job of being the head of the\nhousehold.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He began to speak English, he began to speak some Chinese. He was able to maneuver\nthroughout the city, and one of these doctors that my father was referred to knew a machinist\nfrom Switzerland, and he suggested the Henry might get a job with him, which he did. But this\nplace was at the other end of town. It was -- I don\u2019t know how long it took him, but it took him\nabout an hour by bicycle to get there. And then he worked under the worst conditions.",
        "Q: Was this Allensbach?",
        "A: Alle -- yes.",
        "Q: He wasn\u2019t very nice to him either.",
        "A: He was not very nice to Henry --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and Henry has never forgiven my parents for what they -- that they send him out like that.\nBut they were desperate, my father especially was desperate. He didn\u2019t see how things are going\nto go on, you know. How long is this war going to take?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So at 14, he worked -- he started to work full time.",
        "Q: Right. Can I ask you, was this -- was this sort of typical of the problems that the refugees had,\nthat the male in the family, the -- the adult male was not able to earn a living and the kids had to\ngo out, or wa -- do you --",
        "A: It was not -- it was typical in some instances.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Doctors, lawyers -- lawyers had no way of --",
        "Q: The professionals had nothing to do.",
        "A: -- pro -- professionals.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: If you were a shoemaker --",
        "Q: You ha --",
        "A: -- you did fine.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: If you did -- a watchmaker, you did fine.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Talking about watchmaker, there was a watchmaker who we became friendly with later on,\nFlautto, he actually made watches and clocks from scratch. And when Roosevelt got re-elected in\n1940, he send Roosevelt wa -- a little clock that he had made as a present, and got a sec -- thank\nyou note. I became friendly with his son years later.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So these are the people did very well, some people opened up little shops.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And also we must remember my father was in this -- by this time 50 some years old.",
        "Q: Right, right, he wasn\u2019t a young person.",
        "A: He was not a young person any more. He tried to learn other trades, but that didn\u2019t come easy\nto him. He was often taken advantage of, and we didn\u2019t trust the banks. Some of the money we\nhad was kept in either British pounds or American dollars, and then every time you needed some,\nyou changed it into China\u2019s currency.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You didn\u2019t do that too much because the inflation was so tremendous. So my father one time\nwent and got some money in Chinese currency, on the Central Reserve Bank of China. He came\nhome with that and Henry said, \u201cDoctor, you got taken. Central Reserve Bank, that\u2019s the bank of\nthe Chinese puppet government under the Japanese [indecipherable] government. It\u2019s not going\nto be worth much.\u201d But shortly afterwards the Japanese took over China --",
        "Q: And then it was worth more.",
        "A: And then it became the currency to have. So where he thought he was taken he actually got\nahead of everybody.",
        "Q: Now when you first came, the Japanese controlled part of Hongkew, right?",
        "A: They controlled all of Hongkew, actually.",
        "Q: All of Hongkew.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And -- and the International Settlement went up to a certain point, but that was not taken over\nby the Japanese, nor was the fre -- the rest of Shanghai --",
        "A: Was taken over on December eighth.",
        "Q: Yes, right.",
        "A: At that --",
        "Q: In 1941.",
        "A: [indecipherable] in 1941.",
        "Q: Right. But so --",
        "A: But up until that point it was still separate.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Had this separate government, they had the French government on one area which was like a\nFrench colony and --",
        "Q: And then the British.",
        "A: -- then the British were primarily in charge of the International Settlement.",
        "Q: Was there an American [indecipherable]",
        "A: There was an amer -- American presence there, too. There were American Marines at the --\nthey were actually stationed right across the street from our school. There were American Marine\nbarracks.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And then December seventh, which of course, because of the International Dateline,\nDecember eighth in Shanghai, the Japanese took over the rest of the town, the -- both the French\nand the British --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- at the International Settlement. Even prior to that, the allies knew that they can\u2019t stay there\nforever, so many of the people living in Shanghai had already left back to the States, or France,\nwherever. Not France, because France was at war already. And there were two British -- two\ngunboats left in the harbor, a British and an American. And the Japanese started bombarding\nthem. And the story goes that one surrendered and one went down, ship and all.",
        "Q: Huh. Right.",
        "A: But these were -- these are stories, I --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t know these to be facts.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: What I do know is that December eighth was a Monday and I walked to school like always.\nWe had by this time moved out of this building that we were sharing with our friends, to\nsomeplace else, further away from the waterfront. We didn\u2019t hear the firing, we didn\u2019t hear the\nbombardment. And we rode to work, which was in the Japanese area. I went to school, and the\nkids, did you hear the bombardment, the Japanese are taking over. We got called into the\nauditorium, the principal told us about Pearl Harbor and that the Japanese at this moment are\ntaking over the rest of the city. As he is speaking, we hear troops marching by the school,\nJapanese troops were marching by, occupying the Marine barracks across the street from us. And\nI still recall seeing the ja -- the American flag go down and the Japanese flag go up over the\nMarine barracks. And then they send us all home. By the time I ca -- came home, a kid a year or\ntwo younger than I had gotten home a few minutes before me, he told my parents and his parents\nall kinds of stories, they couldn't make heads or tails out of him, he was so nervous. I was the\nfirst one to tell them about Pearl Harbor and the Japanese taking over. In this time they worried\nsick about my brother.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And he pedaled all the way through all this military takeover back home from where he was\nworking. And after this my parents decided it\u2019s time to move into Hongkew, into the area where\nall the refugees are living.",
        "Q: Right. But let\u2019s go back a little bit. In the -- when you\u2019re living in the French Concession with\nthese two couples and a single guy --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- then all of those people decide they\u2019re going to go to Hongkew. Wa --",
        "A: They all decided to go to Hongkew and my mother still didn\u2019t want to go to Hongkew.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So they -- they --",
        "Q: So you -- they left.",
        "A: -- moved to Hongkew and we moved in with another family into a small apartment.",
        "Q: Was that in kena -- ke --",
        "A: Yes, it started with a K.",
        "Q: Ki -- ki -- K-1-n-e-a-r, Kinear. I don\u2019t know how to pronounce it.",
        "A: Kinear Road.",
        "Q: Kinear Road.",
        "A: I think yes, Kinear Road.",
        "Q: Now, that was not in the French Concession.",
        "A: No, that was --",
        "Q: That was --",
        "A: -- in the International Settlement.",
        "Q: International Settlement.",
        "A: But further, I guess, to the west, away from the harbor.",
        "Q: Ha -- yes, and further away from Hongkew, it wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] Hongkew.",
        "A: Further away from Hongkew. A good ways away from Hongkew.",
        "Q: Now, during this period, are you walking around Shanghai by yourself?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You are, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it -- are your parents worried about you, given there\u2019s supposed to\nbe a lot of thievery and opium dens and God knows what there.",
        "A: They must have been --",
        "Q: But you went anyway.",
        "A: -- but I di -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not aware of it. I mean, they had no choice. I mean, I walked to school\nby myself, and sometimes with friends.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But we always -- it was always daytime, I didn\u2019t walk around at night.",
        "Q: At night. Did you see terrible things?",
        "A: Yes. The Chinese were very poor and very dirty at that time. They had a child, an infant\nmight die, they didn\u2019t bury it. They wrapped it in newspaper and put it out on the sidewalk. So I\nsee this on the sidewalk, I cross over on the other side of the street, not to be close to it. I see\nthat. I see sometimes dogs na -- around these infant corpses.",
        "Q: And could you see it was a corpse? A baby corpse? Because it wasn\u2019t completely --",
        "A: You could see that it was something covered.",
        "Q: Something, uh-huh.",
        "A: I hob -- I wasn\u2019t curious enough to go close to it.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: I knew what it was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You saw people who were crippled on the street, begging, pushing a tin plate in front of them.\nYou saw kids crying while the parents were poking them so they cry more, trying to beg. You\nhear and heard and saw thievery going on. There was the so-called hat-snatcher. You were sitting\nin the streetcar -- course, they were not air conditioned, was opened and the man had his hat on\nand just as the streetcar took off, somebody snatched the hat off.",
        "Q: There was money in hats?",
        "A: There was money in everything.",
        "Q: I guess everything.",
        "A: There was a law in the International Settlement, if somebody steals a loaf of bread and takes a\nbite out of it, he cannot be punished, cause it shows that he was hungry.",
        "Q: Really? That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: And we just try to be careful, but the worst part was the diseases. You couldn\u2019t -- everything\nhad to be boiled.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Water had to be boiled, you could not eat any raw food. Salads were basically out of the\nquestion. Sometimes my mother took some salad and put -- poured boiling water over it, well, if\nyou put boiling water over a salad, it doesn\u2019t taste too good any more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Chinese had little shops where they boiled water and sold boiling water. And we would\ngo there with a thermos, with tea leaves and a thermos, so get the boiling water, by the time we\ngot home we had tea.",
        "Q: Tea, yeah.",
        "A: But they said, be sure you see the water boiling. It has to be bubbling. And that\u2019s a -- these\nwere big drums of water, so it took a long time for them to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- really boil.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Chinese guy would like to sell it to you before he -- it was really boiling. We were told to\nbe careful about that. You couldn\u2019t walk barefoot. When the rains came, Shanghai flooded.\nShanghai was basically at or below sea level, so you had no basements, no house had basements\nlike we\u2019re used to over here. When it flooded, h-how did we get around? Took a rickshaw, and\nwe talked to the rickshaw pullee what you\u2019re going to pay him to go to wherever you want to go,\nand then in the middle of the street he\u2019d say no, I want more. He would just stop there, so you\nhad to pay more to go on.",
        "Q: But when it rained, it could be a foot of -- or more of water.",
        "A: Yes, it could -- 1-1t was fairly deep, I -- let\u2019s say a foot or so at times.",
        "Q: Did you have boots?",
        "A: Yes, but they were not big enough, so you just had to watch what you\u2019re doing, and -- this\nwater was, of course, terribly filthy --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and you could get all kinds of diseases. And we went through all sorts of illnesses.\nTyphoid, cholera. We got inoculated every six months against all these different illnesses.",
        "Q: And where would you get inoculated? Would the -- would the Jewish Joint have a --",
        "A: Well -- well, my father gave us the inoculation, I guess --",
        "Q: He did?",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t know where he got the stuff from. But everybody got inoculated, the health\ndepartment inoculated people on the street, but we were told not to get that, because you don\u2019t\nknow how clean those needles are.",
        "Q: Oh boy, yeah.",
        "A: So you -- when you got inoculated, you got a certificate to show that you have been\ninoculated. But with all that going on, people still got ill.",
        "Q: Did you get ill during this early period?",
        "A: Yes -- not the early period, I got ill --",
        "Q: Later.",
        "A: -- later on.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The early period we did fairly well.",
        "Q: Did you like being in shang -- I\u2019m not -- talk -- bef -- before December eighth, se-seb --\nbefore Pearl Harbor, did you like being there? Was it exciting, interesting?",
        "A: It was exciting, it was interesting, 1t was an adventure. Sometimes they had gangs that would\ngang up on you. Of course [indecipherable] like anyplace.",
        "Q: But this wasn\u2019t because you were Jewish?",
        "A: No, this was because I was white.",
        "Q: I see. Were these Chinese or Japanese gangs?",
        "A: Chi -- chi -- Chinese.",
        "Q: Chinese gangs.",
        "A: Chinese. And then the Russians, the Russian kids used to attack us, even in Hongkew later on.\nThere was a lot of Russian people living there, and one time my father had a Russian person\ncome up with one of his kids to -- something was wrong with him and he took care of him. And\nhe was in part -- h-he was in some of these gangs. So if he was in the gang they told them -- he\ntold the gang to leave me alone. I had my in with that.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that was always scary. You know, we didn\u2019t have that much money on us, so if they\nwant it, but --",
        "Q: So they beat you up to try and get whatever money.",
        "A: Whatever money you had. You gave them some money then you ran away.",
        "Q: These were a lot of White Russians from Russia --",
        "A: White Russians.",
        "Q: -- who came after the revol -- revolution, right?",
        "A: Yes. White Russians.",
        "Q: Now, there are some Jews in that population that came, but the majority who had came over --",
        "A: Yeah, there was a large Jewish Russian population.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, yeah.",
        "A: Very large. And some of them went to school with us, in the Shanghai Jewish school. But --",
        "Q: We have --",
        "A: -- we have to get --",
        "Q: -- we have to change the tape [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Hi.",
        "A: Hello.",
        "Q: Tell me something. When -- when your brother Hans, or now Henry, was going to do work,\nwas there a discussion or was he simply told by your father, you\u2019re going to go out and -- to\nAllensbach factory and you\u2019re gonna -- do -- do you know?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Basically speaking, I believe he was just told you have to go out there. I don\u2019t think my father\nrealized where he sent Henry to, and how bad it would be. I think my father should have checked\nit out instead of just taking somebody\u2019s word for it.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And sending this little kid, 14 years old, out to nowhere. And he didn\u2019t do that, he didn\u2019t\ncheck it out. You know, today if you send your son, or daughter, your child someplace, you\ncheck it out, whether it\u2019s a college, whether it\u2019s a work situation. That, he didn\u2019t do. They -- he\nwas -- my father was so panicked. He didn\u2019t know how he would feed his family. Here he comes\nfrom a upper middle class background as a physician. He had his dreams of sending his sons to\nsame university he went to. Maybe they would go into his profession or something similar. All\nthese dreams got shattered, and now he cannot even take care of them on a day to day basis. He\nwas wotried how to feed us the next day. What will happen to us. So when this opportunity came\naround, he grabbed it and it\u2019ll at least take care of us to some degree. Most of our quote unquote\nincome consisted of selling what we had. We brought a lot of stuff along on this -- in this lift,\nand that\u2019s what we lived on. It wasn\u2019t until substantially later that we actually got charity.",
        "Q: So when your brother is working, it doesn\u2019t contribute that much, because he\u2019s not -- he\u2019s not\nearning so much money\u2019?",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t contribute -- 1-1t couldn't have contributed that much. You know, I wasn\u2019t in on how\nmuch he\u2019s actually paying in.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But, you know, primarily selling our products, my mother\u2019s work --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- was the main income.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I still went to school.",
        "Q: Did Hans complain to you about the work at that -- at that time? Do you remember private\nconversations?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I think more later on than at that time. I think I was too young to be privy to si -- this.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Henry -- Pll call him Henry --",
        "Q: All right, sure.",
        "A: -- because that\u2019s the way I\u2019m used to it now, 1s a very private person, doesn\u2019t open up very\nmuch. And four years at that age is a long --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- 1s a big age difference. But while I made friends and had fun, in and out of school, he\ndidn\u2019t. He worked many hours, he came home dead tired, slept, back to work, and I wasn\u2019t aware\nof what he was going through at the time.",
        "Q: And he worked six days a week?",
        "A: Six days a week.",
        "Q: So he had -- he did have one day off.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But -- mm-hm. Did you -- even though he didn\u2019t say anything, did you realize it was hard on\nhim in some -- do you recall a thi -- or are you just --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: You were too young.",
        "A: -- I was too young.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah. When di -- when did you join the Cub Scouts and he joined the Boy Scouts, was\nit --",
        "A: Right -- almost within the first year that we were there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So did he stop when he was working? He wasn't part of 1t?",
        "A: He was -- he stopped.",
        "Q: He had to stop.",
        "A: He stopped. Yeah, he stopped and his education stopped, to a --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- great extent.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I went to school for many more years and lot of things that I was learning in school he never\nwas taught, obviously he\u2019s self taught since then.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I had a better education at that point. And -- but I wasn\u2019t -- to answer your question\nhonestly, I wasn't aware [inaudible]",
        "Q: How was the relationship with your parents at that time? You\u2019re living 1n very close quarters,\nso you may not have even seen anything, cause at that age we often don\u2019t see anything. But it\nmust have --",
        "A: You mean the relationship between my parents?",
        "Q: Yes, was it diffit -- was it difficult?",
        "A: It must have been very difficult.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But again, a nine year old doesn\u2019t see that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I know my parents loved to play cards, especially my father, loved to play German card game\ncalled Skat, and I would set up my cot and go to sleep while they were playing cards. I mean, I\ncould sleep thr -- I slept through all of that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my parents, you know, played with us, we played cards and car -- board games and\nthings like that. So we do -- did play together in that respect.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I th -- think I saw more of what my mother went through, cooking and sewing, baking. And\nagain my father was devastated that his wife had to support the family. And Henry was the man\nof the house, anything that came up to be discussed with the landlord, with this, with that.",
        "Q: He did it.",
        "A: He was involved in all these things.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That went on all the time that we were in Shanghai.",
        "Q: Were you afraid your father would commit suicide?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You were?",
        "A: Yes, there was a time when we were living out there on -- not Combare, what was the name\nof the street?",
        "Q: Kinear?",
        "A: Kinear Road.",
        "Q: Kinear.",
        "A: On Kinear Road, where I thought my father went up on the roof to kill himself. My father\nused to sit in a chair and fall asleep in middle of the day. Typical sign of depression.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that was one of the worst time for us, when we were on Kinear Road, very far away from\nall our friends. And that is of course where we lived when the Japanese took over, and shortly\nafter that we moved to Hongkew. Whenever we moved, our apartment or room -- rooms, became\nsmaller and smaller. My mother and I used make a chart and figure out how we would set up the\nfurniture in the new place, and sometimes it was within an inch --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- that we could squeeze something in, and what we couldn\u2019t squeeze in, we sold. The move\nfrom Kinear Road into Hongkew was done on a push wagon, I mean it wasn\u2019t a truck, a\nmotorized truck , was hand pushed wagon all through the whole city of Shanghai.",
        "Q: Cause it\u2019s a big trip from Kinear Road into Hongkew.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very large trip. Th -- and then --",
        "Q: Were these human beings that are pushing the --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- pulling the --",
        "A: Pulling this cart.",
        "Q: This isn\u2019t a rickshaw, it\u2019s bigger than a rickshaw.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s bigger than a rickshaw, it\u2019s two guys pushing it. And I guess one of us must\nhave walked along with them. Yeah, Henry walked along with them. Of course it\u2019s always Henry\nwho had to do the dirty work. My mother and I went ahead. We might have taken the rickshaw, I\ndon\u2019t remember these things for f -- facts. So that when they came there, we were able to put\neverything --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- into the house.",
        "Q: And they would move -- these guys would move the stuff into the apartment?",
        "A: Into the apartment and we put them where they are. What I do remember is that I was also\ntransferred to another school, from the Shanghai Jewish school, to the SJY A school, Shanghai\nJewish Youth Association school, normally referred to as the Kadoorie School --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- because Sir Alec Kadoorie gave the money for that school. And you know, I was cutting up\nthe last day in the other school. This one teacher didn\u2019t believe that I would be moving, so he put\nme on detention, and the next day when we were actually moving into the other apartment, he\nhappened to walk by and said, \u201cOh, you really were moving.\u201d And yeah, we were friendly after\nthat.",
        "Q: Did you like the Kadoorie School better than this -- the British system in the --",
        "A: Well, they were both the British system.",
        "Q: They were both the British system.",
        "A: The Kadoorie School was on the British system as well. It took me a little while to get used to\nthe Kadoorie School, certain things were different, but not long and I was very familiar with\neverything there.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of Jewish kids? In the Kadoorie School is all Jewish?",
        "A: All Jewish.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] this a Jewish school?",
        "A: Well, this is Jewish refugee school.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. As well as -- so was the other one.",
        "A: The other one was not just refugees, it\u2019s a Jewish school, th-the Russian Jewish kids there, the\nBritish Jewish kids, these are the people from India, and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that settled sh -- in Shanghai initially. I mean, they were both Jewish schools, and in the\nKadoorie School, the allied citizens had to wear ya -- armbands because the Japanese had already\ntaken over. So you had the British or American armbands and eventually these people were taken\ninto POW camps, and only the refugee teachers remained.",
        "Q: And the refugee kids.",
        "A: And the refugee kids.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: There were basically none, other than refugee kids in that school. Mrs. Hartwich was the\nprincipal. Mr. Gassenheimer was my teacher, and he wer -- these teachers were excellent. They\nhad no textbooks to give us, so -- there were no textbooks so they had to teach out of one book,\nwe had to write everything down. But we learned so much. I mean, I was not even 14 yet, this\nwas 1941, I was 11 - 12. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So this is before your Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: Before my Bar Mitzvah. And we learned geometry, algebra, everything.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: When many years later I decided to take some night courses in Montgomery College here, I\ntook math and it was all a repeat, it was all what I had learned as a 12 year old kid. Gassenheimer\nwas ex -- a fantastic teacher. They were trying to teach us so many things all at one time. I mean,\neverything was taught in English, even though they were refugee teachers, they were all taught in\nEnglish. We -- being a Jewish school, we had Hebrew classes. Being in China, we had some\nChinese classes. Being under Japanese control, Japanese classes.",
        "Q: Japanese classes.",
        "A: And Mrs. Hartwich thought that we should also learn French. Now this wasn\u2019t one year of\nthis and one year of that, these were all --",
        "Q: All together.",
        "A: -- taught simultaneously. The end result 1s that we didn\u2019t learn anything to hold onto, a word\nhere and a word there 1s all that I remember. English and German is what remained because we\nstill spoke German at home. When we kids played, it was a mixture, we spoke both English and\nGerman interchangeably, but we had a good time as kids. There were no air raids --",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: -- going on, none at all. We didn\u2019t have --",
        "Q: That\u2019s not until very late.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that much later. That doesn\u2019t come about until Okinawa fell. You hav -- year or so\nlater I was Bar Mitzvah and you had to pay tuition at that school, and when my Bar Mitzvah\ncame about, Mrs. Hartwich came up to my parents, we usually don\u2019t give Bar Mitzvah presents,\nbut we like Ernest -- I don\u2019t know what they called me, er -- they didn\u2019t call me Ernie at that\ntime. Anyhow, you don\u2019t have to pay any more tuition.",
        "Q: So they had to pay before?",
        "A: Be -- we -- everybody had to pay, and this was my Bar Mitzvah present from --",
        "Q: That\u2019s lovely.",
        "A: It was very lovely.",
        "Q: So you made a big impression.",
        "A: I obviously did very well. I --",
        "Q: And you liked it. You liked it a lot.",
        "A: I -- I liked it. I was -- I mean, math was my forte. I was considered the best math student in\nthe school, not in the class, in the school.",
        "Q: In the school.",
        "A: We were -- eventually kids dropped out as they went to work, so the last year there we were\n12 students in my class, six boys and six girls. We sat at a long table, the girls on one side, the\nguys on the other, teacher at the head. And I was the best math, it was a fellow by the name of\nHans Eberstark who was the best all around student. He -- he was -- is a genius. He eventually --\nhis hobby was to go to the library and learn the dictionary by heart. But he was also a lot of fun.\nHe went along with everybody with their jokes. He eventually started working for the United\nNations in Switzerland, and although I don\u2019t know these for facts, as things I\u2019ve heard, he helped\nwrite the Constitution for some of the new African nations, and as an interpreter for United\nNations. We also had theater that we put up in school.",
        "Q: Were you involved in that theater?",
        "A: I was involved in it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I was in -- we did the part of Shakespeare, \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d I was Puck --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- in \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d We also presented something in Japanese, where the\nJapanese paper came by and took a picture of us --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- sitting on the stage there. Course we learned it by heart, I have no idea what I was actually\nsaying. The --",
        "Q: But you were saying it in English?",
        "A: No, on --",
        "Q: Shakespeare --",
        "A: The Shakespeare in English.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, but the Japanese play was in Japanese.",
        "Q: Ah-ha, right. So they never told you what you were saying?",
        "A: Well, they did, but --",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- it didn\u2019t really matter that much. But we had -- the class had a great time, the 12 of us\nputting up these plays. We were 13 - 14 years old. No, not quite 14. But we really had a\nwonderful time there. And eventually my parents decided that I sh -- finished that school as\nmuch -- far as I could go, that I should go to work. In the meantime my brother had -- was able to\nconvince my parents at that place where he was working was not right, and through some\nacquaintances he found another place, working for a Korean company that made lathe, and\ndrilling machines and so on, where he was able to get a job for me. So I became an apprentice in\nthis machine factory under my brother, in a way. The factory had a small department where the -\n- we made all the little parts, little screws, pins, what have you. And we were about half a dozen\nrefugees working in there, including a Mr. Lawrence who was a foreman. And I worked there,\nand between my brother and I, we finally made a little bit more money than we were spending\neach day.",
        "Q: So how old are you then? You --",
        "A: 14.",
        "Q: F -- so this -- this is what, s-six or eight months after your Bar Mitzvah? No, yo -- it\u2019s longer,\nit\u2019s a year afterwards.",
        "A: A year afterwards.",
        "Q: This is 1943, before the announcement for the ghetto.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the announcement of the ghetto was in 1943.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The announcement of the ghetto came while I was still in school.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And I remember at that point, I mean we read the announcement, we read the borders that\nthere were, and we thought -- I thought we were okay. We were on the Seward Road, that\u2019s\nwhere the line was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But the line went down the middle of the street, and we were on the wrong side --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- of the street, and we had to move. Well, one of the girls that I was talking to about that, she\nthought they would have to move and she was on the correct side of the street.",
        "Q: On the correct side.",
        "A: So we had to move, and now to find a place to live was very difficult. See, in the ghetto,\nnobody had to move out. The Chinese people didn\u2019t have to move out. You had to be in there\nwithin 90 days. Couldn\u2019t -- it was very hard to find anything until the Jewish organization bought\na part of a school and converted that school into small rooms and a few large halls. And you had\nto pay -- I forgot what they call it, key money or something like that, to be able to have one of\nthese rooms. And my father had to sell his microscope so that he could have the money for us to\nmove in there. So four of us moved into a room in the school. And it was very short distance to\nthe school for me to walk there. The school was actually outside the district.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: However, the Japanese basically like kids and let us go to school. We have --",
        "Q: Did you have to get a pass to go?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you have to get it from this guy, Ghoya?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that terrible?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t so terrible as a kid because I -- I don\u2019t think we ne -- actually needed it then,\nbut when I went to work, where I worked was outside.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And we had to get it from Ghoya, and that was terrible because it had to be renewed every\nmonth, and sometimes you stood in line for a month to get the renewal. So you stood outside\nthere in every kind of weather, waiting for him to show up, then he showed up and gave a few\nrenewals, gave a lot of rejections. Yeah, in summer it was hot with the sun beating down on you,\nthen you went inside and scare -- you were scared, trying to get in front of this man who had\nsuch power over you. Initially some of the people decided not to follow -- not to move into the\ndistrict, so they were thrown into jail for a week. Didn\u2019t think a week\u2019s imprisonment was so\nbad, but these cells were infected. They came out and died like flies once they came out. And\nthat went on for the rest of the time.",
        "Q: Was Ghoya the main person that you had to get -- wasn\u2019t there somebody else called Okura?",
        "A: Okura was actually Ghoya\u2019s superior.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But Okura wasn\u2019t personally involved that much with us.",
        "Q: But Ghoya was.",
        "A: Ghoya was, he had a refugee man being his secretary, doing all the paperwork, but I don\u2019t\nrecall his name. But when Ghoya eventually got -- was out of it, this man just did every\n[indecipherable] just took care of everyone. He was very fine person. But Ghoya was terrible, it\u2019s\na -- Ghoya considered himself king of the Jews.",
        "Q: It -- this was his own attribution for himself?",
        "A: Yes. He thought he was doing us all a favor.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Our sports activities were mainly playing soccer and he used to come out to the soccer field,\nwhere we had to parade past him, just like you parade past a king, and view him. And everything\nwas fine and then the next morning for whatever reason, something he didn\u2019t like, he threw the\npeople in charge of the game into jail for a few days.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: They never knew how he would a -- react on anything. He used to hit people for no reason\nwhatsoever. And again, the kids he mainly left alone. I\u2019m talking about the adults.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Did you ever see that? Did you ever see him hitting somebody [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, but my father got -- he said he got hit on the hand, just like this, and he said, \u201cI felt that\nfor hours.\u201d It was just [indecipherable]. And you know, the thing -- you were in such small\nquarters, everybody was on top of each other, slightest thing and people got into fights and\narguments. The refugee communit -- community started their own -- what did they call it? Like a\ncourt system, so it didn\u2019t have to go to the Japanese authorities. So you try to settle things outside\nof them. In the meantime, things got a little better for us because my father got a job with the --\nwith the hip -- not the hospital, but the -- well, with the hospital, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Was it the free clinic?",
        "A: The free clinic --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- actually he got the job with the free clinic.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And with him getting a job in the free clinic, my brother and I working, we finally were able\nto make ends meet. In the meantime we had gotten onto charity. And before you could accept\ncharity, they community send a committee up to your house, you know, places where you live, to\nmake sure you had nothing left to sell, which was very demoralizing. But we got one hot meal a\nday, which was sort of a stew. My parents used to dig out the small pieces of meat there was, and\ngave it to Henry and I. My father lost over 50 pounds.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Was -- basically both of them were skin and bones, trying to keep us going.",
        "Q: And did you guys lose weight? Did you lose a lot weight [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, us kids, we didn\u2019t, but you know --",
        "Q: Were you hungry?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember being hungry\u201d?",
        "A: I -- I -- I was not hungry, my -- but my parents saw to it that I was not hungry.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Henry was not hungry.",
        "Q: And when the three of you were working, did your mother stop doing all this baking that she\nwas doing, and sewing?",
        "A: Yeah, she actually stopped that when we moved into the --",
        "Q: She did?",
        "A: -- into Hongkew, because she had no facilities there to do all that.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So, I --",
        "Q: But she still had her sewing machine? Or not?",
        "A: She still had her sewing machine.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Oh -- to the very end. When we finally -- the war is over and we made contact with her\nbrother in Baltimore, things happened very rapidly and she said, should I bring my sewing\nmachine or not, and we -- it never got to [indecipherable] anyhow, we sold it in Shanghai.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And then she was sorry she didn\u2019t bring it with her. But -- was going to say something else.",
        "Q: We were talking about [indecipherable] meals and stuff.",
        "A: Oh, no I was going to ta -- at this time is when I had my Bar Mitzvah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Which was basically a low point in our life, as financial is concerned. And my parents tried to\nmake the Bar Mitzvah pretty nice. The cantor that we had used to be an opera singer in Europe. I\ncan still see him, he looked like Pavarotti standing there in front of me, singing to me. It was\ndone very beautifully. Our neighbors had a little haberdashery store and he came up to my\nmother a month or so ahead of time to loan him one of my shirts, he wants to make one for\nsomebody, well he made a nice shirt for me. But what my mother had not realized, she gave him\none that I'd -- I\u2019d slightly outgrown. So the sleeves came up to here, and he had to attach\nsomething. That was my big present, was my shirt.",
        "Q: Your new shirt.",
        "A: And my Bar Mitzvah party consisted of coffee and cake. The rabbi came, my teacher came.\nAnd Gassenheimer was my teacher, the Hebrew teacher in our school --",
        "Q: Was Gassenheimer?",
        "A: No, was not Gassenheimer.",
        "Q: No. Right.",
        "A: Was a Mr. we -- Webber, I believe. He was teaching everybody but he was going into a lot of\ndetails.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: Gassenheimer was not so Orthodox. It was easier with him, and I took lessons from him and\nthat went very well.",
        "Q: I think we have to change the tapes.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning of Tape Five",
        "Q: How long did it take you to learn your Haftorah and learn the ceremony for your Bar\nMitzvah?",
        "A: Very short period of time.",
        "Q: Like what, a month?",
        "A: Two months maybe.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Two th -- two, three months, something like that. But --",
        "Q: So you were quick?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t that so much, my birthday is December second.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So when I approached Mr. Gassenheimer back in August sometime, he said, \u201cOh, December,\nwe got plenty of time.\u201d And first day back at school in sep -- early September, he calls me, he\nsays, \u201cI just looked it up, your Bar Mitzvah by the Jewish calendar is actually November 14\".\nWe\u2019re talking a lot sooner, we really have to get onto it.\u201d So we got onto it fairly rapidly. I don\u2019t\nhave a voice to sing, so I was just reading everything, and did fine. Everything went off pretty\nwell, I did okay.",
        "Q: Ha -- you had learned Hebrew before, so --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- you knew --",
        "A: I mean, I had ler -- started to learn Hebrew back in Germany.",
        "Q: Right, in Germany, right.",
        "A: I could read Hebrew, couldn\u2019t speak it as a language --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- but, you know, I could read the Hebrew prayer books, and knew some of the translations,\nbut basically just reading it was no problem for me.",
        "Q: Did you have to give some sort of a speech, which is what they do in this country, I don\u2019t\nknow whether they do --",
        "A: No, I didn't --",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t do any speech.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] speeches.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So where did it occur?",
        "A: In the school.",
        "Q: In the school.",
        "A: The school is where we also had services.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: In the main school auditorium, that\u2019s where we had services, we had youth services there to,\nwhere the kids from school did all the parts and I one time was the quote unquote rabbi --",
        "Q: Oh yes?",
        "A: -- had a little talk on the subject, the Torah subject of the day. So that\u2019s where it was held.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, it was very nice, and --",
        "Q: And where was the coffee and the --",
        "A: At -- at our home.",
        "Q: At the ho -- at the si -- in this little room?",
        "A: That\u2019s -- in that little apartment. This was before we moved into the SACRA --",
        "Q: Uh-huh, I see.",
        "A: -- this was when we were on East Seward Road.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so we actually had two rooms.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so it was bigger.",
        "A: Bigger, and you know, we didn\u2019t have that many people, maybe half a dozen people that\ncame over.",
        "Q: And did you drink coffee, or was there something else for kids?",
        "A: Oh it -- I did drink coffee, but 1t probably was milk, or something like that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh.",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember that much.",
        "Q: Besides the communal lunches you were getting for nothing.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you were going to the --",
        "A: The communal lunches really came about later, when we were in the SACRA building.",
        "Q: Right, but when you were in East Seward, you were not.",
        "A: We were not.",
        "Q: So what -- all of this time, what -- what are you eating? Are you eating three meals a day, or\nwould you not even call it three meals a day?",
        "A: Yes, we were eating three meals a day --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and usually the noon meal was the main meal.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, we didn\u2019t have cereal, per se, that I recall.",
        "Q: So what was breakfast like?",
        "A: It was a light breakfast, some bread and butter and jelly, what have you. And I --",
        "Q: And did your mother have to -- she had to buy food every day.",
        "A: She went to buy food daily --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- because of there was no refrigeration.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And she managed very well to do that.",
        "Q: And at night it was also very small.",
        "A: Very small, like a little supper. But I can\u2019t honestly tell you what we were eating. I\u2019m -- the\nonly thing I remember 1s that my mother made -- you know --",
        "Q: She baked.",
        "A: -- she did -- changed everything into German cooking. You know, people hear that I was\nliving in Shanghai, they think of me eating Chinese food. No, we didn\u2019t do that, we ate German\nfood. Many of the things we never heard of before. Some of it came through the Russians,\nthere\u2019s kasha.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I remember that, and I hated it. But that --",
        "Q: You hated it?",
        "A: [hated it, I won\u2019t touch it now. But kasha was our cereal, and that was served to us. And\nother things, for example, Passover came about, the rabbi announced this particular cereal type\nof food is good for Passover, for those people who were Orthodox.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Made up our own rules. Kasha, there was -- we drank a lot of tea, ate a dra -- ate a lot of rice,\nand for a long time after I came to the United States, I hardly touched tea or rice. Since then I\u2019ve\nbeen accustomed to it more.",
        "Q: Did you ever eat Chinese food in Shanghai?",
        "A: Yes, when -- when we had got our visa to come to the States, we went out to a quote unquote\nChinese restaurant.",
        "Q: Really? That was the first time?",
        "A: A nice Chinese place. Not the first time, it -- but I remember that time because we -- we ri --",
        "Q: Was it good? Did you like it?",
        "A: Yeah, we liked it. One time earlier, one of these doctors that my father had been referred to,\ntook us to a really fancy Chinese restaurant with several courses came in -- coming in. But I was\nvery little at that time, I didn\u2019t appreciate all of it, but it rel -- 1t can be nice.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But most of the time it was make do with what was available.",
        "Q: Right. It wasn\u2019t an easy time, was it?",
        "A: No, it was not. I -- I mean, again, as a child you don\u2019t know these things, but for my parents it\nmust have been terrible, not knowing how they\u2019re going to feed us the next day.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: How are they going to pay for the food? And tha -- you know, once we moved into the\nSACRA, it\u2019s there that we applied and eventually got charity. And I remember the people\ncoming in, looking over to see --",
        "Q: To make sure that you had nothing to sell.",
        "A: To make sure there was nothing to sell. And then we got this one hot meal a day, which was\nbig pot of stew.",
        "Q: And did they bring that to your apartment, or did you have to go --",
        "A: Well, they brought it in a cart, and then they --",
        "Q: And they\u2019d ladled it.",
        "A: Ladled it out. And we had a pot they ladled it in --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- and then my parents tried to give us as much meat as possible.",
        "Q: And the other two meals they had to be responsible for getting them to you?",
        "A: Yes. And one was some sort of kasha or whatever that was.",
        "Q: So what did you drink in the course of the day, because it had to be extremely hot at certain\ntimes of the year, right? I mean, you would need to drink a lot, right?",
        "A: We need to drink a lot, we drank hot water.",
        "Q: You drank hot water.",
        "A: Because when we went to work, my brother and I went to work, and our mother took -- made\nsome sandwich for us, but we couldn\u2019t take anything to drink with us, and whatever we drank\nhad to be boiled. So we had to see that it 1s boiled, and then we drank hot water. Hot water and\nsort of dry bread was our lunch.",
        "Q: But what happens with the communal meal, if the communal meal is the middle of the day,\nand the two of you were working, what happens?",
        "A: My parents kept it for the evening, and then reheat it.",
        "Q: So you -- you would have it in the evening. And did your father work all day long once you\ngot into --",
        "A: No, it was a while before he --",
        "Q: Awhile before --",
        "A: -- got that.",
        "Q: So you were working with your brother before your father got to --",
        "A: Oh yes, and my father was still practice once in awhile, and then everybody had to leave that\none room that we lived in when he had a patient in there.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Other times when it wasn\u2019t such a personal examination, I assisted him in some things. We\nhad like a little balc -- not a balcony, like a walk around the room outside where we fired up the,\nwhat we called the Chinese oven, which was a hibach -- hibachi. Over here when we do the\nhibachi it\u2019s a lot of fun, over there, that was the way to go. Had to buy charcoal to do it, and\nwhen charcoal became too expensive, we bought powdered coal, which we mixed with water,\nand made into little coal balls to heat up. Our hands were black as --",
        "Q: Black.",
        "A: -- oh, it was terrible. And there was one woman in -- w-we were quite a few people in this\nbuilding, couldn\u2019t tell you the quantity. The one woman worked in a restaurant. She used to\ncome home and bring the coffee grounds from the restaurant. Anybody has a fire going, you can\n-- they can share with me a cup of coffee. So my mother had -- loved coffee, she missed coffee\nmore than anything else. So she had the fire going and drank the coffee when it was going\nthrough the grounds a second time. And it\u2019s -- and there also were -- we got bombed out. In 19 --",
        "Q: But that\u2019s later --",
        "A: That\u2019s later, okay --",
        "Q: -- let -- let -- let me just ask you a couple of things. Now, did I just forget my question.",
        "A: We\u2019re talking about food, and -- we\u2019re talking about the communal kitchen stuff that came in.",
        "Q: Ah, this is what I wanted to know. Does your -- does your father\u2019s mood, as you see it now,\nget better when he starts to work and the three of you are working? Do you see a difference?",
        "A: When my father got the job in the clinic, his mood began to change.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: His mood began to change, and made all the difference in the world then. And I remember,\nyou know, you couldn\u2019t deal in American currency on -- on open market, but Chinese currency\nhad no value. So when we finally were able to come to a point where we could buy some\nAmerican dollars, 1t was a big point because that was a turning point. This month we actually\nmade more than we spent.",
        "Q: I see, because it was worth more.",
        "A: It was [indecipherable] we were able to buy some dollars on the black market, and that\u2019s what\nwe put aside.",
        "Q: Now, before you meet -- they don\u2019t actually call it a ghetto, they say the designated area for\nstateless refugees, right?",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s actually for all of you who would come after \u201937, am I correct?",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s mainly Austrian and German refugees.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Oh -- as well -- and y --",
        "A: Some Polish also.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know ho -- the Polish -- w-we -- they were in there, but it\u2019s primarily the German and\nAustrian refugees.",
        "Q: Right. Before you go in there, there\u2019s a lot going on in Europe.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: A lot of murdering of Jews.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: Di -- you didn\u2019t know, you hear nothing.",
        "A: We know that they are being put into concentration camps.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My grandmother, my mother\u2019s mother was still in Breslau. She was up in age when we were\ngetting ready to leave, and my aunt, who was quite wealthy, had paid in an old age home for the\nrest of her life, so she didn\u2019t have to worry about money. My mother asked her to come with us\nto Shanghai, she said, \u201cLook, you guys going to have a hard time in Shanghai, why should I be\nalong? Who would do anything to a -- an old woman like me. I\u2019m taken care of over here.\u201d So\nwe corresponded with my grandmother all the time we were there, and one time a letter comes\nback, moved, address unknown. And we knew that meant concentration camp. And I recall\nseeing my mother in tears when she got that.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: When we got that notification. Now, what concentration camp meant, that it was death camps,\nwe were unaware of. As it turned out, my grandmother was taken to Theresienstadt, and from\nwhat we understand, she died there.",
        "Q: Do you think that your parents knew more than you and Hans knew?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think anybody knew this.",
        "Q: Right. So people didn\u2019t have radios, they didn\u2019t have a way of --",
        "A: Well we had radios.",
        "Q: You did. But you couldn\u2019t get -- you -- you couldn\u2019t go far enough to get --",
        "A: But the radios didn\u2019t announce it.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: The Russian radio had a German program on it. See, Russia was not at war with Japan.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the Russians were free, and the Russians reported very accurately what went on on the\nEuropean frontier. Now, we heard, you know, about the landing in Normandy and all that, almost\nat the same time as you would have heard over here. But we didn\u2019t hear anything about the\nJapanese war.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And one time we -- it came through about Okinawa and we looked on a map and we saw\nwhere Okinawa was, and we said to ourselves, God, that isn\u2019t so far away from us any more.\nAnd then shortly after that, that bombing off Shanghai began. So once a island like Okinawa,\ncomparatively close to the Chinese mainland, was captured, planes flew from there, and did their\nmissions from there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But most of the bombing of Shanghai occurred in the outskirts.",
        "Q: Right. Do you think any -- do you think that the majority of refugees, the stateless refugees in\nHongkew knew nothing?",
        "A: Of the death camps? I don\u2019t believe they did.",
        "Q: Until after the war.",
        "A: Until after the war.",
        "Q: Right. W-When you saw the notice, or all of you saw the notice to go into the designated area,\nwhich was February \u00b043, and you have to be in there by May.",
        "A: May.",
        "Q: Am I correct?",
        "A: February 18\" -- May 18\".",
        "Q: February 18 -- yes. Were you worried about having to go in there, or did you think that the\nJapanese wouldn\u2019t do anyth -- I mean what -- what -- what was the sensation about the Japanese?",
        "A: Well, we were worried. I mean, the Japanese were in control there, and Germans were their\nbuddy buddies.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We had no idea what was going on in Germany, but we realized this is an imprisonment of\nsorts.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And only of sorts, because usually when you are a prisoner, they feed you.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Here we had to feed ourselves.",
        "Q: Selves, right.",
        "A: And, you know, primarily, the first thing is trying to find the place to live.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, just imagine yourself at -- you decide to move and you have 90 days to do it. So it --\nit\u2019s not easy to find a place under the best of circumstances, and here, all of a sudden, all these\npeople trying to move in. Many people switched homes with the Chinese. They took their fancy\nhouse, something like as nice as this one and traded it for a hovel.",
        "Q: So there were some people who did very well in Shanghai, as far as you can tell?",
        "A: You mean among the refugees?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Very well is exaggerating it a bit.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: They did well. They made more money than they spent. That\u2019s considered doing well. There\nwere some -- there was one family from Liegnitz, one -- a couple actually, they didn\u2019t have any\nchildren. They came with their parents. And his father was not Jewish, so he didn\u2019t have to move\ninto the ghetto. The younger couple got a little place in the ghetto, but they were all\nwatchmakers. His father employed him, and he was able to work with his father and live outside\nthe ghetto.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They did work quite well. This Mr. Schwartz who lived next door to us, he the one that made\nthe shirt for me, he had a store across the street, and he seemed to do all right. And a lot of the\npeople who were handymen, plumbers, electricians, what have you, they did fairly well.",
        "Q: But they\u2019re working with the Jewish refugees, right, who don\u2019t seem to have a lot of money.\nSo how are these other people, even though they have the skills, how were they making money\u2019?\nDo you understand it?",
        "A: Well, we all had a little bit of money s -- coming from somewhere.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Somewhere.",
        "A: I mean, you had to have a plumber, you needed a plumber.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I am not sure how these things --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- all came together again. You couldn\u2019t see that.",
        "Q: And who did you rent from? When you rented this little room.",
        "A: Well the room in the SACRA was of course, the SACRA organization.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It stood for something.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Shanghai soma -- something or another. Prior to that, a Chinese ow-owned the house.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And the --",
        "Q: In Seward, when you were in east --",
        "A: On East Seward Road.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And he had a sh-shop downstairs and rented out the upstairs. And once the war was over, and\nwe moved back a block away on East Seward Road, the same thing occurred. Somebody had a s-\nstore downstairs and rented out the upstairs.",
        "Q: All right, let me ask you about hygiene.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: You probably didn\u2019t have a toilet inside.",
        "A: Yeah, we did.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: We did have --",
        "Q: Throughout?",
        "A: Throughout, that\u2019s one thing we insisted on, WC in the --",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- meaning water closet, yes.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s unusual?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t too unusual, but it wasn\u2019t unusual not to have it. But we had it, we did not\nhave to have an outhouse.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have to have one of these what they called the honey buckets?",
        "A: Nope, we didn\u2019t have to have a honey bucket.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Thank God.",
        "Q: Wa-Was that the main given by the refugees, a honey bucket?",
        "A: I would imagine so.",
        "Q: You imagine so. Because that, I\u2019m sure, was very uncomfortable.",
        "A: Well, but, you know, when we walked to work, or walked to school --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- we would see these Chinese people cleaning out their honey buckets --",
        "Q: Buckets.",
        "A: -- in the middle of the street.",
        "Q: And there would be people who would come, and you would dump the --",
        "A: They du -- come in one of these carts, they would dump it in, and then they would take it out\nin the field and use it as fertilizer.",
        "Q: As fertilizer.",
        "A: That\u2019s another reason why you had such --",
        "Q: So did Shanghai stink?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was it a lot of s -- awful smells?",
        "A: Awful smells, especially -- yeah. Not in the French Concession, yeah, the fancy residential\narea, but in the Hongkew area, it stank. I mean literally, it was terrible. And the people on the\nboats, they threw their waste into the water.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now that\u2019s the same water that then came out of your faucet.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s why you had to boil it.",
        "A: Yeah, boil it.",
        "Q: And even boiling, I would imagine, didn\u2019t clean everything.",
        "A: Well, they well -- that did go through some cleansing pro --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- process before it got there, but the bacteria of course, all came straight through.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And sometimes people thought that certain filters would help it or -- they tried it and they --",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t. And we got all kinds of illnesses. Typhoid, typhus.",
        "Q: Did your parents ever get sick?",
        "A: Oh yeah. My parents got sick, I got very sick.",
        "Q: You got very sick at the end.",
        "A: I had [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And so did your brother --",
        "A: -- war was actually over.",
        "Q: -- right?",
        "A: My brother got sick --",
        "Q: Something --",
        "A: -- he had got sick --",
        "Q: Bacterial dysentery or something like that?",
        "A: Bacterial dysentery in there at one point. But wa -- I -- I had either typhus or typhoid, I never\ncan keep it straight, whatever comes from lice.",
        "Q: And your parents?",
        "A: My father had some bacterial disease, my mother had something else. Everybody got sick all\nthe time.",
        "Q: And so they got sick, and then they got over it and then they got sick.",
        "A: Sick, and over it. Some things were not so serious as others.",
        "Q: Let me ask you this, when you look back -- I\u2019m sure at this age you wouldn\u2019t have seen it, but\nwhen you look back and think about when you move into the designated area, wh-where people\nare now calling the ghetto.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Maybe you ca -- did you call it the ghetto then?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: But -- yeah, I -- yeah.",
        "Q: So your mother stops doing cer -- the things that she was doing because all the boys in the\nfamily, the men are working, right?",
        "A: Well, the -- yeah, bo -- my father didn\u2019t start working until --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- some time after that.",
        "Q: But at a certain point he does.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And she stops. Now do you --",
        "A: She di -- she did -- she continued doing --",
        "Q: Oh, she did?",
        "A: -- something. I mean, we didn -- we didn\u2019t have the lunchroom any more.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That stopped when we moved away from rue Ratard. I think she still did some of the sewing.",
        "Q: Okay, then my question is not -- I\u2019I] tell you what I was going to ask you. I thought that\npossibly she pulled back from all these things so that your father could feel even s -- even\nstronger, but maybe --",
        "A: No, you know, that was not the case.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure at this point how the money that we needed to have came about.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: Mostly it came about from selling things. My father\u2019s microscope, my mother\u2019s fur coat, and\nthis, that, the other.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: [indecipherable] more and more.",
        "Q: Did you hate going to work?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t resent it?",
        "A: No. I looked forward to it, you know.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: You get out of school, you get to work, I can do someth -- accomplish something.",
        "Q: But you loved school.",
        "A: I loved school, and I --",
        "Q: And you loved the work?",
        "A: -- I basically loved work, but I was an apprentice, I didn\u2019t like it when they had me cleaning\nup.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I wanted to get onto the machinery, learn how to use the machinery.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Korean who owned the company, he didn\u2019t want to see me on the machinery, he wanted\nme to clean here, clean there.",
        "Q: Clean --",
        "A: This department where we made all the small parts was sort of a showplace for him.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And he often brought his customers in to see --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- what we were doing. And I loved making money. There -- after awhile -- I mean, first we\ngot paid a salary, but then we got on piecework, where for every screw you got so and so many\ncents, or whatever it was.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I loved that, I loved being able to contribute, and making the money. An --",
        "Q: W-Would yo --",
        "A: A -- but you know, I was still 14 - 15 years of age, of --",
        "Q: Your brother by then is 19.",
        "A: 19 -- 18 - 19 years old --",
        "Q: 19 years old.",
        "A: -- and trying to protect me from everything, I mean, when they told some stories that he\nthought I was too young to hear, I -- you know, go fetch a glass of water kind of thing, which I\nresented, I th-thought I was big enough to hear -- hear all this.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But we also had shelters, bomb shelters in the back of the -- of the factory. However, when\nthe bombing started we went on the roof of this factory and watched the American bombs --\nbombers bomb the outskirts of the city. I remember the first time we saw the B29\u2019s flying over\nour head. They were flying so high that the Japanese anti-aircraft couldn\u2019t reach them. So we\nwere there just looking up at them.",
        "Q: Just looking up. As I understand it, the Japanese had sort of munition du -- places in Hongkew",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- or around, nearby.",
        "A: Where they had it all, I don\u2019t know. But the school that we -- the SACRA built into this\nbuilding, the other half was a radio station.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: A Japanese radio station that gave some ja -- radio signals to the military. And there was a -- a\ngasoline place, storage place not far away. And there were other things, there was an admiral of\nsome sort not living too far.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: So when on July 17\", 1945, a blanket of bombs was placed over that whole area. They were\nobviously not very large bombs, not like these big bombs that they used to destroy a lot of things,\nbut there were about three or four bombs that fell into our building. And quite a few people got\nkilled right then and there. I was home, I didn\u2019t go to work because I had a cold, flu or whatever,\nnothing serious, but I was in bed. As I said before, we didn\u2019t have any basement, there was no\nplace to go anyhow when the bombs fell and they were usually [indecipherable] on the outside.\nAll of a sudden I heard this big noise and I see the ceiling falling down on me like that. And I\nwent like this. There was a bookcase over my book, and one foot fell above my head, and one\nbelow my feet, and the whole ceiling and everything fell on top of that, so I hardly had a scratch.\nBut I came very close.",
        "Q: Let m -- there were bookcases on it --",
        "A: It was bookcase, you know, a bookshelf with two legs.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Or a leg on each side.",
        "Q: On either side of the bed.",
        "A: On either side of the bookshelf, that was over the bed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Right.",
        "A: And one part of that shelf fell above my head --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- one below my feet. And it protected me from the ceiling and everything else that came\ndown.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My parents were just outside the door where I guess there was a stronger part of the building -",
        "Q: And they were okay.",
        "A: -- and they were not hurt, they were okay. But my mother was scared for me, couldn\u2019t open\nthe door because of the air pressure. And then when they finally opened the door and called for\nme, and they said I didn\u2019t answer right away, because all they saw was the ceiling stuff all over.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And my brother was at work, and -- I guess we have to stop.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll s -- we\u2019ll stop and then continue the story.\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Ernie, you were talking about the bombing and your parents --",
        "A: My parents were outside --",
        "Q: Outside.",
        "A: -- and the building there, it was a brick building and a fairly sturdy building, so where they\nstood wer -- did not come down, the ceiling did not come down. And my mother at first thought\nthat there\u2019s somebody lying in front of our door that she couldn\u2019t open it, because the air\npressure was so strong from the bombs falling. But finally she was able to open it, and after a\nfew seconds, actually, I guess, I was able to yell I\u2019m here, and push stuff away from me and\njumped out into their arms. No sooner was that done than a call came from my father to help here\nand help there because there were -- a lot of people were wounded, and quite few had died. But\nmy brother was at work, and somebody was telling him at the wor -- and he decided to come\nhome when he realized where the bombing had occurred. So he started running home, it was a\ngood 45 minute walk. And on the way he met people, he said -- he asked, what about the\nSACRA building, and people just, oh, everybody got killed in the SACRA building. It was not til\nhe was about a block or two away that he met somebody who knew us, and he said, don\u2019t worry,\nyour -- your family is fine. Now, I still had a temperature from the flu or whatever I had, so I was\nlying outside on a rug, trying to stay calm. And my mother was with me when he came. We\ncouldn't find my father, he was being called from one end to the other. And then they said, well\nwe all have to move into this school. And my mother said, I don\u2019t want to move into the school\nwith all these people. So we cleaned up our room a little bit --",
        "Q: And stayed there?",
        "A: -- and stayed there for the first night. You could see the stars coming through the ceiling. And\nduring the night a fire broke up somewhere in this complex, was actually two buildings. Well,\nthe next morning we all decided we better move into the school. So we grabbed -- each one\ngrabbed a mattress and walked those three blocks to the school. The classrooms were made\nempty, and you put one mattress next to the other, man, woman, child. And that\u2019s where we\nstayed. But neither Henry nor I decided to go back to work. We refused to go back to work.",
        "Q: You refused?",
        "A: We were too scared. And this was July 17\". Shortly afterwards the war was over. The way we\nfound out the war was over, on August 10\" is my mother\u2019s birthday. We woke up in the\nmorning, we heard bombs falling. My father said, here\u2019s some -- they\u2019re saluting you to your\nbirthday. And then at night, wi -- what was always black out, all of a sudden the lights went on.\nThere\u2019s Mrs. Hartwich, the principal in her nightgown. I just heard over the shortwave that the\nJapanese have asked for surrender. The war is over. And everybody got out, went into the\nauditorium, somebody jumped at the piano, and started playing music. And my father led the\nconga line.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Dancing through there. Next morning people started tearing down the signs of the ghetto\n[indecipherable] district, and the Japanese arrested them. Oh, everybody said the whole thing\nwas just a rumor, nothing true. But two or three days later, I think it was on the 14\", a plane,\nAmerican plane flew real low, dropping leaflets that the war is over, but the Japanese will have\ncontrol, police control over the city until the Americans can come in. And then the emperor held\nhis speech telling Japan and the whole world that the war is over.",
        "Q: Did you hear that on the radio?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: Obviously I couldn\u2019t understand what he is saying, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah, I was going to say --",
        "A: But we heard this, and then somebody was translating it. And then, just a few days after that,\nthe first Americans came in, they came into the school. It was nice to see them, and after that, all\nright, we now have to go back to work someplace, so --",
        "Q: Let me ask you something. Did you folks hear about the -- the two atom bombs that had been\ndropped?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Did you hear about that later, or in this period?",
        "A: In this same period. I mean, it came over the newspapers.",
        "Q: It did, and --",
        "A: Not what we fully understood what an atom bomb was.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But we heard about the destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And na -- to begin with, we were worried if -- what would happen if they start dropping a\nbomb on Shanghai.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But this happened so rapidly from one day to the next.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But it was nice. It was a good -- good time.",
        "Q: It was a good time [indecipherable]",
        "A: It was a good time that -- then I don\u2019t know where my brother first went to work, but he -- as\nsoon as the American troops came in, he got a job at the airport, and I got a job at another\nmachine shop, which was quite filthy.",
        "Q: Filthy.",
        "A: Filthy place. And I didn\u2019t like working there, but then I got sick, and this is where I got -- I\ngot sick and said to my mom, look at my bites, I had some bites on me, turned out to be typhoid\nor typhus. I think it\u2019s typhoid.",

        "Q: -- no.",
        "A: -- he was working at the clinic.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But this was a hospital that they had going all along --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- it was 1n one of the homes.",
        "Q: Which they called Heime --",
        "A: Heime --",
        "Q: -- yeah.",
        "A: Heime. [indecipherable] the Heime, I think 1t was a [indecipherable] time, but then again, I\ncan\u2019t be a hundred percent sure. And you know, I was in the room with about a dozen other\npeople. I had had my shots for typhus, typhoid, cholera, all along, so I didn\u2019t get this illness as\nbad as it could be. There was another kid about my age in the room, he didn\u2019t have as many\nshots, and he was delirious for days. He eventually had recovered, and I eventually recovered.\nBut there were people in this room who died while I was in there. People used to say, Ernie, turn\naround. And I could hear people actually passing on. In the meantime, Mr. Lorenz, who was my\nforeman in the other factory, he had a been a student at the Zeiss factory in Germany. He decided\nto open up a camera repair place. He met my parents on the street, he said, \u201cDo you think Ernie\nwould like to continue his apprenticeship with me?\u201d Well, when I heard that -- course, he didn\u2019t\ncall me Ernie, everybody called me Ernst at the time. When I heard that, it helped my recovery\nmore than anything else. And soon as I was well enough, I started working with him.",
        "Q: Did you know him?",
        "A: Yes, he was my foreman --",
        "Q: Ah, that\u2019s right --",
        "A: -- in the --",
        "Q: -- and you liked him.",
        "A: -- in the Korean factory. Oh yes, he was very nice person.",
        "Q: And were you attracted to doing work on cameras, was there something attractive for you in\nthat? Or you weren\u2019t sure?",
        "A: Well, cameras or not, it\u2019s the small pieces, the small --",

        "A: -- mechanical --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- which they used to call fern Mechaniker in German, fine mechanic.

He\nsaid, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a mechanic.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, that was fine mechanic,\u201d --",

        "A: -- that it referred to. But I continued my apprenticeship with him by getting into cameras.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And here, 60 years later --",
        "Q: And here you are [indecipherable] later --",
        "A: -- Pm still at it.",
        "Q: Now, did your brother get sick at the same time as you, or a little bit afterwards?",
        "A: No, that was before that, I believe.",
        "Q: Before, uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- sometime before that that he had this serious illness.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re working now in different places?",
        "A: In different places. He worked for -- he worked for the American military, which I also\nwanted to do because it sounded neat.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But then I got sick and started working for Mr. Lorenz.",
        "Q: Right. And where do you folks live now? Where di -- where did you go -- oops -- where did\nyou go right after the war, when the American occupation [indecipherable |",
        "A: Well, once the American occupation came in, of course we could go move wherever we\nwanted to.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And we found an apartment on East Seward Road again --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- but a block away from where we were before, basically the same area. And that\u2019s where we\nmoved into, and stayed until the --",

        "A: I couldn't answer that --",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: -- you know, because we had no social contact with them at all.",
        "Q: Right, right. Was there any suspicion because you were Germans and Austrians?",
        "A: From the Japanese, or --",
        "Q: From the American -- no, from the Americans.",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, no. I mean the -- no, I mean the people in charge knew who we were.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, the plain G.I.s, and sailors, they could care less.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] And is there more help coming in once the war is over, from Jewish\norganizations?",
        "A: Tremendous amount of help. First of all, packages were sent to us of clothing and food, and\nsome of the food we didn\u2019t quite know what to do with, what it 1s.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: Farina. We didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t know what Farina was, my mother finally figured it out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But we loved the hard salami.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: You know, that was easy to ship, but didn\u2019t spoil.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was just great. We loved the canned fruits, you know, canned cherries and so on. The\ncherries we split evenly, one for you, one for me. Chocolate and everything else, I mean, we just\nloved everything coming in. My parents quickly began to get their weight back.",
        "Q: Because they could have more food now --",
        "A: Then -- now they could --",
        "Q: -- because there\u2019s more.",
        "A: -- eat more [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And my father still worked for the clinic, my brother worked for the Americans so he made a\nhalfway decent salary.",
        "Q: Right, you worked for --",
        "A: For Lorenz and although my salary wasn\u2019t great, 1t was great compared to what many other\nkids were doing.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I was making 20 American dollars a month, I mean, that was a lot of money.",

        "A: And --",
        "Q: So the currency was American money at this point?",
        "A: Well, we got paid -- we calculated everything in American money.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But your everyday purchases still was in Chinese money.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But the Chinese money changed again. And of course, the inflation was rampant.",
        "Q: Right.",

        "A: There was no real destruction, even in the Hongkew area, other than that one point on July\n17th",
        "Q: There wasn\u2019t much.",
        "A: -- there wasn\u2019t much. The airport got destroyed, the -- some of the piers, some got destroyed,\nbut there was no rampant destruction like you see in what happened in London or in --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- Germany in World War II.",
        "Q: Now, as time go -- you were there for about two years, until 1947, okay?",
        "A: Yeah, January \u00b047.",
        "Q: As time goes on, do you hear more about the destruction from the atom bomb? Do you -- do\nyou get a sense of what that really was?",
        "A: Yes. The papers were fairly accurate in what they told us about that.",
        "Q: Did that hor -- did that horrify you, or did you think --",
        "A: Well, the horror, 1t got overshadowed by what we heard from Germany.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, right.",
        "A: I mean, the paper started running an article about Treblinka, one of the destructive camps.\nThen we saw newsreels and -- when we went to movies, of what occurred.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And so you saw newsreels of the camps?",
        "A: Of the camps. And then the realization, these aren\u2019t strangers, these are our relatives.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s my uncles, my aunts, my --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- grandmother --",

        "A: -- these are all in there. That realization was very, very hard to accept.",

        "A: Free, on the --",
        "Q: -- free on the one hand, and not on the --",
        "A: -- on the other hand, I mean, it took a long time to absorb this.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I mean, to this day, none of us can fully comprehend that.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Sometimes read some of these books of -- which have a graphic description, I mean it -- can\u2019t\neven -- you have to put it down --",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: -- put it away.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And what -- when we read about things happening in another country, it\u2019s bad enough, but\nwhen you begin to realize these are my people, these are my relatives, that\u2019s -- that was hard to\naccept. An --",
        "Q: Did you -- did you see a change in your parents, was this -- di -- did it take a lot -- because\nthey knew them even better than you did.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Right?",
        "A: I mean, they was much closer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s three siblings all had gotten out, only her grandmother had stayed behind. My\nfather had four siblings and only one had gotten out.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the one brother that he was so close with, that he was trying to talk into coming to\nShanghai --",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t get out.",
        "A: -- didn\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He had three children. One went to England, one went to first Holland -- Denmark, then\nSweden and eventually is -- Israel or Palestine. But the third one, the youngest one, stayed with\nthem.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- but the one that went to England, I fou -- eventually made contact with and we got\ntogether. It\u2019s horrible to realize what went through there. And that overshadowed a lot of the\nother things.",
        "Q: Right. Yes.",
        "A: And then the next step was to make contact with the people that were alive. My mother\u2019s\nsister was in Panama, her brother was in Baltimore. Her other sister was in Haifa. My father\u2019s\nsister was in Montreal. So we contacted all of them, and we decided whatever comes first, that\u2019s\nwhere we go.",
        "Q: Where you go.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t care where.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, it turned out that the United States came through f-fast. And on Christmas eve,\nDecember 24\", 1946, we got our visa to come to the United States. And of course once you had\nthe visa, now you had to figure out how to get here. The Joint and other Jewish organizations\ntook care of that. Was shipped -- usually troop ships, which were filled. The first --",
        "Q: With troops?",
        "A: American troops, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But the -- you know, they tried to arrange it so that husbands went to wives first, parents to\nchildren, children to parents. And we were the first group after that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And we were told we\u2019d have a ship leaving first week of February. I get a call at work, Ernie,\ncome on home, we\u2019re leaving in a few days. What happened, the ship in February would not take\nany women because there were still G.I.s on the boat. So they said, \u201cWell, you and your sons can\ngo, but your wife would have to come on the next ship.\u201d And he -- father wouldn\u2019t hear of that.\nSaid, \u201cWe\u2019ve stuck together this far, we\u2019re not going to split up now.\u201d Is there nothing else we\ncan do? This was on January the fifth. The guy said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a ship leaving on the ninth of\nJanuary, there is still some room.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d But we have to have your heavy stuff\nby day after tomorrow. Okay. So --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have that much stuff anyway.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have that [indecipherable] had stuff we had to get rid of, you know, like the sewing\nmachine I mentioned earlier, and got rid of some of the things. But we were aboard that ship on\nJanuary ninth, and 13 days later we were in San Francisco.",
        "Q: Was it hard to leave Shanghai in some ways?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You were glad to get out.",
        "A: We loved -- we couldn\u2019t wait to get out.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Our stay in Shanghai, I mean, even though it wasn\u2019t that tough for me as a child, was very\ntough for my parents, my brother, and of course it filtered down to me.",
        "Q: And even after the amer -- a-after the American occupation, even --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- even then it was not easy.",
        "A: No, that -- you know, that was just a year, so getting out --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and starting a -- a new life was all we could hope for.",
        "Q: So you were all very happy to get out?",
        "A: Very happy to get out. Very happy.",
        "Q: Were there any friends there that you had made that you --",
        "A: Yes, we had some close friends.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They moved different places. One went to Australia, and I remember him, dimly. We\ncorresponded for awhile.",
        "Q: And then stopped?",
        "A: And then it stopped. There was -- we actually had a little club that we formed after the war,\nmet in the school, called Tikvah, and made some close friends with them, and one of them came\nto Washington, and I got to know her -- reunite with them --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- after we got here. I went to one reunion where I met -- re-met many of these people from\nthe Tikvah club. But it wasn't hard to leave. I think it -- yeah, this group from Liegnitz, we all got\ntogether the night before --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- had dinner together. And --",
        "Q: That original group?",
        "A: That original group.",

        "A: The Brauns, the Ritters --",
        "Q: The Ritters and --",
        "A: Mr. Salinger.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And we said goodbye to each other because we all went in different directions. We came to\nBaltimore, Brauns went to London, Ritters went to ta -- Palestine, and Salinger went back to\nGermany.",
        "Q: Get his wife.",
        "A: To his wife.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And my parents corresponded with them for a fairly long time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Had you remained fairly close with them whi --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- the whole time you were in Shanghai?",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, in fact, we always celebrated Passover together.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Mr. Braun was the one who conducted the service.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I was always the youngest in all my life, to say the four questions.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Manishtana. And he used to practice, and I had to come over his house to help -- to do my\npart, and to practice.",
        "Q: I see, so you would do it well.",
        "A: So I would do it well.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But e-even in Germany, my mother\u2019s family, where we used to have Seder together with her\nfamily, I was always the youngest of all the cousins.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Then in this group I was the youngest. So I was always the youngest.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But s-say that by heart in Hebrew to this day to a great extent. But it must have been very\nhard for my parents to say goodbye to them --",

        "A: -- because we spent so much --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- time together.",
        "Q: And you shared a huge decision to even go to Shanghai.",
        "A: Decision to go to Shanghai, to live together.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: To do that lunchroom together.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And even afterwards we stayed very close. And --",
        "Q: Was America what you expected?",
        "A: In most cases, yes.",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: In many cases better and some cases not so good. And by that, the racial discrimination.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I thought that this business with the blacks being different from the whites went out with the\nCivil War. And of course, especially in Maryland and Baltimore, that was not the case.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: There was still a lot of discrimination in 1947 and \u201948. When we came here, of course, the\nfirst thing, you had to find a job. We had a little bit of money that we had brought with us, but\nnot very much. And so looking for a job was the first thing, and we had relatives here, mother\u2019s\nbrother and his family. They found out that Henry was a mechanic, and -- not an automobile\nmechanic, but a machinist, I should say.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So they got him a job in Bethlehem Steel, which was not to his liking because that was quite a\ndistance from where we lived, and it reminded him like being shoved off to Allensbach in\nShanghai. When he -- my cousin heard that I was a camera repairman, he took me into Ritz\ncamera center, and they hired me, and I was with Ritz for about 10 years. So I had a job a week\nafter we got here, my brother had a job a week after we got here.",
        "Q: Your mother?",
        "A: My brother.",
        "Q: Your brother, right, at Bethlehem Steel, right.",
        "A: At Bethlehem Steel. And my father went to the Jewish Community Center and talking to\nthose people he says, I\u2019ll be a Fuller Brush man, whatever you can find me. And he was told, no,\nwa -- I\u2019ll find you something better, and a few months later found him a job in a hospital. In\nMaryland you could work as a physician in a hospital without having to take all the tests.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: But this was a sa -- a sanitar1um for colored people. So he was in a place called Henryton,\nworking his profession, very happy living there. My mother decided to live in Baltimore to take\ncare of Henry and I. They got together on -- on weekends. And -- but this is some more of this\ndiscrimination that I was talking about, these doctors, African-American doctors used to tell my\nfather, when you go into downtown Baltimore, you can go into any restaurant --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- drugstore, have thi -- something to eat, or to drink, we can\u2019t do that. Theaters, some you can\ngo to, some you can\u2019t. And that -- that surprised me, that was one of the things that surprised me.\nBut other than that, it was just great.",
        "Q: It was easier than being in Shanghai, I guess.",
        "A: Much easier --",
        "Q: In ace -- in a certain --",
        "A: -- much easier.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And we became assimilated as fast as we could. We wanted to be as American as --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- and the next guy.",
        "Q: Now you were 17 when you came and your brother was 21.",
        "A: 21.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re no longer kid kids any more.",
        "A: No, no. You know, I -- I made friends very quickly, and some of the people I made friends\nwith I\u2019m still friends with today.",
        "Q: Are you? That\u2019s great. Would [indecipherable] change the tape.\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: Ernie, what did your father actually do in this hospital? Was he just a regular physician?",
        "A: Regular attending physician --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- it was a TB hospital. There were quite a few little children there, and he loved little\nchildren, got some pictures at home, him and the little children.",
        "Q: And he lived there, so when did you and -- and Henry see him?",
        "A: On weekends.",
        "Q: So, just --",
        "A: Henry -- Henry got a -- a -- the idea was, when Henry was so unhappy with working in -- at\nBethlehem Steel, my father said to him, as soon as I have a job, you can quit there and find\nsomething else.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he did. He found a position as a salesman for a paper company selling wrapping paper\nand all that kind of stuff to retail stores, hos -- hospitals --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- hotels, etcetera. And for that, of course, he needed a car, so we bought him a car, and with\nthat car we --",
        "Q: You went back and forth.",
        "A: Back and forth.",
        "Q: I see. And did your father have an apartment there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: He did? So y --",
        "A: And my mother stayed there sometimes for days, but she wanted to take care of Henry and I,\nso she stayed in Baltimore with us.",
        "Q: So you all four were -- were subsidizing two apartments.",
        "A: Well, the ap -- the apartment in the -- in Henryton, he didn\u2019t have to pay for it, that was --",
        "Q: I see, that was given to him, I see.",
        "A: -- that was given to him as part of his pay.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: My mother could have stayed there too, with him.",
        "Q: Right, but she preferred to stay with you guys.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Now I understand that one of the reasons you came to Baltimore, because her brother was\nthere.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And then pretty much after you came, they decided they were -- or had they already decided\nthey were going to California.",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Which was a little odd, right?",
        "A: Yes. It -- my mother became very upset about that, because when we came into California,\nwhen we landed in San Francisco, friends of my parents from Germany, who were living in San\nFrancisco, were there welcoming us. And the Joint gave us a hotel room where we could spend a\nlittle bit of time with them. These were two brothers, they were not married, two brothers who, in\nLiegnitz had department stores, something, but they came to San Francisco and lived there. And\nsaid, \u201cWhy do you go to Baltimore? Everybody from the east is coming west.\u201d My mother said,\n\u201cWell, all these years, with all that went on, I want to get back and at least be with my brother.\u201d\nSo we came to Baltimore, we settled down a little bit, and they tell us that they are planning to\nmove to San Francisco. My mother was furious. You could have told us that ahead of time, we\nwould have stayed in San Francisco, the -- I forgot what their name was -- told us to just stay\nthere. Anyhow, they decided to go there, first their son, and then they. And my uncle couldn\u2019t\nfind a job. So after awhile they came back to Baltimore. In the meantime we had really settled\ndown extremely rapidly. I had a nice job, maybe it wasn\u2019t paying a fortune, but more than\nminimum wage. Henry eventually had the job with this paper company, he stayed with them for\nover 40 years until he retired.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: And we made friends. My parents made friends with other refugee people that lived there. I\njoined a fraternity, it had nothing to do with a college, it was like a club, and as I said, I\u2019m still\nfriends with these people today. A few years ago we had our 50 year reunion.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Just the three couples, one young -- one man moved onto New York and is now in upstate\nNew York, and we call each other on the phone every once in awhile, once in awhile we see each\nother. So it was a very deep friendship that developed there. My brother also became friends with\nquite a few people, he had now a decent job, nine t -- nine to five, so to speak, rather than all\nhours of the day and night that they had in Bethlehem Steel. He had a car so he could get around.\nBegan to teach me how to drive, which was --",
        "Q: That was good.",
        "A: -- it was good to a point. Eventually I went to a driving school, and --",
        "Q: I see. You needed a better teacher.",
        "A: Well, would -- he was so nervous because he had no controls, you know what I -- driving\nschool the guy has all the controls there.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And that -- so we had no intentions of leaving Baltimore to go to San Francisco.",
        "Q: Did you want to go to school?",
        "A: No. That\u2019s my problem, I didn\u2019t want to go to school. I liked -- I liked making money.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I liked work, I liked making money. But people said to us -- used to say to us, in America you\ndon\u2019t need schooling. They don\u2019t care about your schooling, it\u2019s what you know that counts,\nwhat you can do that counts. Well, that\u2019s not true. And eventually somebody said to my father,\nlook, your boys don\u2019t even have a high school diploma. You need to see to it that they get some\nschooling. So Henry and I went to night school, Baltimore City College, which although it has\nthe name college in it, is really a high school. We went to night school, and sent our report cards\nfrom Shanghai to a department of education here in Washington. That eventually came back, and\nthey just went by our age into which grade we should go. So in the meantime, what should we\ntake, we -- English, of course, American history and some other subjects. We took tests in\nGerman for both German one and for German two, which we passed with about a 90 degree\nsetting. And then we heard about the ga -- high school equivalent tests.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we both took that and passed that.",
        "Q: So you got your high school degree.",
        "A: So we have our high school degree. Recently I happened to come across a report card of that.\nI had 99 plus in mathematics, so mathematics was my field. But we didn\u2019t go on to college.",
        "Q: And neither one of you wanted to?",
        "A: Henry did go.",
        "Q: He did?",
        "A: He went to -- he went to Baltimore City College and took a two year course there. I was not\neager at the time, which --",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: -- and I had no encouragement from my parents. In the meantime, my pa -- father had passed\naway, and my mother depended on Henry and I --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to keep her going.",
        "Q: Now, your father had a -- a goiter when he was in Shanghai, and this --",
        "A: My father had a goiter from when he was a young man.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: During World War I is when he first noticed it. And it was in the army at the time, German\narmy. But this is 1914 - 1918 --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: He had had a friend who had a goiter removed and he became a vegetable afterwards.",
        "Q: So your father was afraid.",
        "A: My father said, I don\u2019t need that, this is just a beauty spot. People either like me or don\u2019t like\nme with it --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and just kept that. However, that put a tremendous strain on his heart, pos -- probably had\nsome effect on his heart attacks.",
        "Q: Because it was growing?",
        "A: It was growing internally --",
        "Q: Internally.",
        "A: -- yeah, always. And it put a pressure on his heart.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So after we\u2019re here for awhile, we have to meet some of the doctors here, they said, look, why\ndon\u2019t you have it taken care of now? We have Johns Hopkins Hospital here --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- one of the best hospitals in the world. He said, \u201cBut what about my heart?\u201d I mean, now\nafter the initial heart attack in Germany, he had had another heart attack in Shanghai.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Not as severe, but it was a heart attack. They said, well, let\u2019s take you under observation and\nthen see how your heart will hold up for an operation. So he did that, went into Hopkins, and we\nwent to visit him one Sunday in December, and while we were there the doctor comes in. We\u2019ve\nchecked your heart, you\u2019ve been under observation, your heart is fine, you\u2019Il be able to do it.\nWe\u2019 ve scheduled the operation for tomorrow, next day.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, he ex -- my father excused himself after a few minutes, he had to go to the bathroom,\ndidn\u2019t come back. All of a sudden we hear, Dr. So and So, Dr. So and So, calling him. My father\nhad had a heart attack. They wheeled him back into the room, they chased us out, and that\u2019s ho --\nwhen he died.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: His heart just wasn\u2019t able to take this, or whatever. Completely -- I -- I for one never expected\nhim to die. That really got to me.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And my mother now depended completely on my brother and I to take care of her. No\nencouragement to me to go to school, so I didn\u2019t. Two years later, 1951, I got drafted.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that -- after I come out of the army, instead of taking advantage of the G.I. bill, I went\nright back to work. My own fault, I should have gone to college. It would have been paid for\nunder the G.I. bill. But with no encouragement, 1n just the other way, you know, you got to go\nback to work so you can support me, I went back to work.",
        "Q: And who was supporting your mother when you were -- when you were in the army?",
        "A: My brother.",
        "Q: Your brother.",
        "A: And I.",
        "Q: And you, because you were sending back the money.",
        "A: I sent back half of my pay, I mean, I got 80 dollars a month as a private, sent 40 bo -- dollars\nback home.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: While the other guys got money from home, I sent it back. And my brother was just above the\nage to be drafted, and the age was at 26, and --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- so he just escaped being drafted.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t?",
        "A: And I didn\u2019t, and you know, so once I got home -- my brother got married while I was in the\nservice, and --",
        "Q: Did you know? Was he dating this person before?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did -- so you knew her?",
        "A: Yes. I knew her. And this -- also from -- she\u2019s actually from Vienna. And they took an\napartment just a few doors away from my mother\u2019s house, or mother\u2019s apartment, didn\u2019t have a\nhouse, and my mother used to cook dinner for them. So they came over her house for dinner, and\nthen went home. But then I came home, and I moved in with my mother and stayed there, and\nthis is still in Baltimore. In the meantime I went back to Ritz camera centers, and they told me --\nEddie Ritz, a very fine man, you know, they had to send repairs out while you were gone, so now\nhow about -- we think you\u2019d be better salesman than a repairman. So I went into sales, worked\nmy way up to assistant manager. And one day I got a call from Eddie Ritz out of Washington, we\njust bought this place called Brenner photo, how would you like to be manager of the store here\nin Washington? And that\u2019s how I ended up in Washington.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But instead of moving to Washington, my mother put it very bluntly, well, if you move to\nWashington, you\u2019d have to pay for two apartments. So I commuted for about a year.",
        "Q: By train, by car?",
        "A: By train.",
        "Q: By train, mm-hm.",
        "A: And then, after awhile I left Ritz cameras and then went for another comp -- with another\ncompany called Industrial Photo in Silver Spring, but there was no good train connection to\nSilver Spring --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and I commuted by car. And couldn\u2019t wait to get out of my mother\u2019s house, so first chance\nI had, found a girlfriend, we decided to get married and move to Washington.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Now [indecipherable |",
        "Q: But you still supported your mother.",
        "A: I still supported my mother.",
        "Q: Yeah. Did you get along with your mother?",
        "A: Oh. To some degree, yes. Retroactively I resent a lot of what happened. This business of\nmaking us support her, not letting us have a life of our own. I got married and when this young\nlady and I talked about marriage, I said, \u201cBut, you know, you\u2019ve got to realize, I\u2019ve got to send\nsome money to my mother every month, every week.\u201d And it was tough --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- on our weddin -- on our marriage. Eventually she got some money out of Germany, a small\npension.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] I see, yes.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when it made it a little easier on us. But I moved to Washington and visited my\nmother very frequently, but even that was not frequently enough. So there was quite a bit of\nresentment that built up in me.",
        "Q: Was she very isolated, do you think? Or did she have friends that --",
        "A: She had made lots of friends among the German Jews.",
        "Q: But she still wanted this association with you and Henry.",
        "A: Well, you know, she wanted that, she wanted our financial support.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And made no strong effort to learn the language or to find a job. And it was very difficult to\nbuild up a family life of our own, with that.",
        "Q: And did you have children? This is your first wife, yes?",
        "A: My first wife, yeah.",
        "Q: You had --",
        "A: We had -- we had three children.",
        "Q: -- two -- three children.",
        "A: One of whom unfortunately be -- died a few years ago.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: But they all got to know my grandmother -- my -- their grandmother, my mother.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Although the youngest probably hardly remembered her.",
        "Q: And do they live in the area, your children? The two?",
        "A: The two -- one lives 1n Philadelphia, just outside of Philadelphia.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: One is now here in northern Virginia.",
        "Q: How nice.",
        "A: But she is married to a man in the diplomatic service, so every once in awhile they are --",
        "Q: They\u2019re [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: -- in other places, which is usually fine, we have a place to visit.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: They\u2019ve been in Lisbon, I visited them in Lisbon, I\u2019ve -- we visited them in Moscow.",
        "Q: Great.",
        "A: So it\u2019s very nice, and they have a little boy. My son has two sons, one of whom is getting\nready to go to college this fall.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And my son-in-law never remarried after my daughter died, but has a little -- a little daughter,\na young daughter.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: She is now in high school, so they\u2019re not little any more. And --",
        "Q: And I gather your daughter was ill.",
        "A: My daughter had an illness that came about, well it was in her all her life. I can\u2019t think of the\nname right now, but it was a illness of the connecting tic -- tissue. Ehlers -- Ehlers-something\nsyndrome. She one day developed a sore on her leg which wouldn\u2019t heal, they had to decide to\namputate the leg. And then it a-attacked other parts of her body. And it\u2019s something I can\u2019t get\nover.",
        "Q: It\u2019s awful.",
        "A: I mean, you expect your parents to die before you.",
        "Q: Right. You don\u2019t expect your children --",
        "A: You sometimes expect your mate to pass away, but you don\u2019t expect the children to die\nbefore you. It\u2019s -- that\u2019s the tough part.",
        "Q: Yeah. And you divorced in the 60\u2019s, or --",
        "A: No, late -- later on. When did I divorce? About 15 years ago -- no, 18 years ago, cause it was\njust before my oldest grandson was born.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We divorced, there were many reasons for it, and once the children were out of the house, it\nbecame more obvious that we don\u2019t fit together.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it was a -- about as friendly a divorce as you can have, I guess. One day we just looked at\neach other and said, do we really want to continue our lives like that, and we decided no. So first\nI suggested she find a place to live, and then I would sell the house and I\u2019d find a place to live,\nfiguring it\u2019s easier for a man to find an apartment than a woman. And she started to look around,\nshe said, \u201cWhy would you want to sell this house, I mean, it\u2019s something valuable that we have.\u201d\nI said, \u201cWell the house is too big for one person to live in.\u201d Said, \u201cWell if you don\u2019t want it, then\nI want it.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s fine, you know, I\u2019ll find a place to live,\u201d and I moved out. And\nyou know, financial arrangements that we made between us hit some hard times, but not bad, not\nreally bad.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And she eventually remarried, and a few years later I met somebody and remarried.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And a good friend of mine asked me [indecipherable] how is marriage a second time around?\nI said, \u201cWell, if it\u2019s that much better the second time around, I can\u2019t wait for the third time\naround.\u201d",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a good relationship.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very nice relationship, we do a lot of things together, we travel a lot. We bo -- she\u2019s also\ndivorced, so we learned from our mistakes the first time.",
        "Q: Yeah, right.",
        "A: And any divorce, it\u2019s not one person\u2019s fault --",
        "Q: It\u2019s not.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s always two people who are not necessarily at fault, things just don\u2019t work out right.\nThere are many, many parts that --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- play a part in this.",
        "Q: Whe -- when you look back, it\u2019s -- in a way what I\u2019m going to say is a stupid question, but --\nbecause I don\u2019t know exactly how you take something out of your life and say if -- what would\nhave happened if this didn\u2019t happen to me. But I don\u2019t know whether you experience what\nShanghai has done to you. The move out of Germany, the effect on your family and all of that.",
        "A: I think I am aware of it.",
        "Q: You are?",
        "A: My life -- I mean, I look at what my life would have been like 1f Nazism wouldn\u2019t have come\nto Germany.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I would have gone to college, I would have become a doctor or lawyer --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- some professional.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I would have had a great life, you know, I would not have had to worry about supporting my\nparents, they would have supported me. Probably would have gone into a profession where I\ncould make -- I\u2019ve made a decent living, and -- instead of what I ended up with. I mean, I didn\u2019t\ndo bad. Considering what I went through, I did very well.",
        "Q: Right, right. And you enjoyed it, it seems.",
        "A: I -- enjoyed most of it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And -- but I find -- I -- you know, I get together with people my age or even younger, and\nthey talk about their college life, which I\u2019d never experienced. I never experienced living by\nmyself until I divorced.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Because I went from my mother\u2019s house, got married --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- into married life. The three years between my separation from my wife, and before I met\nAnya, I enjoyed those, because I was on my own.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I was able to take care of myself, I didn\u2019t starve.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Figured out how to cook, more or less, and I missed out on that part of my youth. I never had\na teenage life, or a young adult life. So yes, I missed that. I decided a couple of times to go back\nto take college courses, but didn\u2019t really follow through on it. I did all right in my profession. I\neventually, after I left Ritz Camera Center, went with a company called Industrial Photo, and\nbecame their general manager and vice president, and did fairly well for myself. But it\u2019s not the\nsame as what I could have been, or would have been.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [inaudible] you know, I can hold my own with other people, I --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- have enough education of -- by reading and studying on my own. But certain things I just\nmissed out on. You know, it -- like one time I tried to -- I considered opening up my own camera\nstore, but then I became scared. I am not a big risk taker, I\u2019d rather let other people take the risk\nand I work for them, but that doesn\u2019t get you very far.",
        "Q: But you were in a very high risk situation as a child, it makes perfect sense, doesn\u2019t it?",
        "A: Uh-huh, I guess.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t your choice, it was certainly --",
        "A: It was not my choice.",
        "Q: No, but it certainly was a high risk situation.",

        "A: Most time Levy is with a -- a v, this was with a w.",
        "A: No, we had a big apartment, actually it were two apartments that were opened up together.\nHalf of them was my father\u2019s offices and practice, and the other half is where we lived. I can still\nsee it in my eyes, it was a long, drawn out apartment, there was a big living room, and dining\nroom that were connected together. Then there was a long hall that was long enough for me to\nride my tricycle on. At the other end were the bedrooms, and big bathroom, and all that. And\nthen there were about three rooms that were my father\u2019s offices. One thing I remember in that\nbig hallway, we had an icebox, I mean, not a refrigerator, but an icebox. It was pink.",
        "A: Pink icebox. And you know, in summer the iceman came by in his horse and buggy and\nbrought up those big pieces of ice to put in there.",
        "A: No, ice for -- like a refrigerator, but not electric.",
        "A: It was a -- I mean, we had electricity, and we had running water, and regular toilets and all\nthat, but many of the modern electrical stuff we didn\u2019t have as yet.",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t tell you that honestly. My guess would be about once a week.",
        "A: Those huge, big pieces of ice, and --",
        "A: -- the melting of the ice truck down, ran behind it as little kids to get some of that cold water\non your face --",
        "A: -- on a hot, sunny day.",
        "A: No, my -- I shared it with my brother. And we got along fine.",
        "A: Most of the -- most of the time.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s actually four years.",
        "A: Yes, it is a big difference, and we did have our fights, of course he was bigger and stronger\nthan I, sometimes very aggravating. He would just hold out his hand and I couldn\u2019t get anywhere\nnear him. But we did fine. I wasn\u2019t very aware of us being different from other kids in the\nneighborhood and the building. The building was owned by a man who has the carpentry shop in\nthe back. There was a little alley where we played in, and then there was this big factory, where\nyou heard the machinery going almost day and night. Well, not night of course, but I do\nremember that very well.",
        "A: Um.",
        "A: We were little bit on the outskirts, not a suburb like you see here, but in a working class area.\nNot in the downtown area of our little town. And most of the Jewish family lived more in the\ndowntown area. So there were not too many Jewish people living there, but we -- the town\nwasn\u2019t that big to begin with --",
        "A: -- so we had good contact with them. The streetcar ran right in front of our house, and\nstreetcar was a single track. And in the front of our house there was a bike path. So when one\ncame from one side, the other one had to wait --",
        "A: -- for it to come from the other side. And -- but we walked most places. We walked to school,\nand walked to the synagogue and all that.",
        "A: No, not religious at all. My mother\u2019s family was religious, but we were not at all, my father\nwas not at all. However, we did belong to the synagogue with -- my parents had the respective\nseats there. On high holidays that men sat downstairs, the women upstairs.",
        "A: It was Conservative --",

        "A: We did go frequently on Friday night.",
        "A: In fact, we also attended what we would call Sunday school here, but actually Hebrew school.",
        "A: And three boys and three girls always got called up for Kiddush onto the beamer, and the joke\nwas that my brother didn\u2019t care for the wine but he had to drink it, but I enjoyed it every time\nthat I got up there.",
        "A: My mother was more religious than my father, but we didn\u2019t keep kosher or anything like\nthat.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Most of the time.",
        "A: And quite often we had friends over for Friday night dinner.",
        "A: But, you know, candle lighting was about as far as we went. My mother did fast on yi -- Yom\nKippur.",
        "A: Not until I was Bar Mitzvah and then I fasted and most of the time still do.",
        "A: But that\u2019s about the only thing I\u2019m sort of keeping.",
        "A: Not necessarily, he --",
        "A: -- but we had lunch -- we had servants, we had the -- my father had a nurse for his office. We\nhad a live in maid.",
        "A: And she took care of the house, but she didn\u2019t take care of the kids, my mother took care of\nmy brother and I.",
        "A: We took many walks. The little town was quite picturesque. Had nice parks that we went\nthrough. And my father, having lived there for such a long time, was well known in the city. Old\ntype physician, he got called out at night quite frequently.",
        "A: As a physician as well --",
        "A: -- especially in the neighborhood that we were in.",
        "A: Yes, he was.",
        "A: He did not do surgery. There were other people who were there who did surgery.",
        "A: And took trips to the little farms outside, and I often went with him. I remember going with\nhim on a -- to a farm and get s -- got scared when all these big dogs and what have you came\nsnooping around the car while he was in there with his patient. And as I got a little older, learned\nto ride a bike, many of the calls he made were by bicycle, and I went with him on a bicycle. It\nwas on one of those trips where I was riding in front of him, and we talked back and forth, all of\na sudden I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t get an answer. I look around and I see him off the bike, he had had a\nheart attack.",
        "A: A very severe heart attack. It was a friend of ours, not living too far from where we were, we\nwent to her house and called a taxi to take us home. And this was his first, and very severe heart\nattack.",
        "A: Yes, this was before Kristallnacht. It was maybe one or two years before that.",
        "A: I was six years old or so.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: No, my brother went through the elementary school in our town, and then when it came for\nhim to go to high school he was transferred to Breslau.",
        "A: Now called Wroclaw, where my mother\u2019s family lived. And he lived with one of my uncle\nand aunt\u2019s and attended school there. So he wasn\u2019t home at the time.",
        "A: He stayed home.",
        "A: He got taken care of at home.",
        "A: Yes, but it took quite a few months.",
        "A: Quite a few months, and he was all right then. It was probably -- probably in early 1938,\nbecause after he got well, we decided to move to a smaller apartment. And it was in that smaller\napartment where we then experienced the Kristallnacht.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I -- I didn't notice a change, really, because all I knew was --",
        "A: -- Hitler.",
        "A: I mean, all I knew was the Nazi government.",
        "A: You know, at three years you have no knowledge of what is going on.",
        "A: The street we lived on, there were often parades moving along the street, and as a little child\nyou love -- you love a parade --",
        "A: -- you like to be out there and cheering them on with the other kids. And somehow I knew\nI\u2019m not supposed to cheer these people on. But it was very difficult for me to fully understand\nwhat there was.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Th -- be careful, don\u2019t go out there, and tha -- but they left it fairly open. [indecipherable]\nother words, they didn\u2019t make too much of a deal out of it. But I always knew certain things we\ncan\u2019t do. Just certain rules we as Jews couldn\u2019t do. Because my parents had a live in maid, they\ncelebrated Christmas in a way, in fact we had a Christmas tree. The maid wanted it of course,\nand so we celebrated Christmas. And one year my parents called my brother and I together and\nsaid, we\u2019re not going to celebrate Christmas any more, we\u2019re going to celebrate Chanukah from\nnow on. And our main question was, will we still get gifts.",
        "A: And long as that was the case, we didn\u2019t care.",
        "A: She was not Jewish.",
        "A: Yes. A certain point, the law came about that she had to be, I think fo -- 35 or 45 --",
        "A: 45 old, and this was a very young person, and she had to leave the house at midnight,\nDecember 31\u201c, whatever year it was. And she stayed til the very last minute, and then left. And\nmy parents actually found somebody else, 40 f -- was just 45, to take over. This person had been\na cook in a sanitarium, she knew how to cook very well, and she taught my mother how to cook.",
        "A: The second -- they were both called Marthe, the second Marthe. And when we moved into the\nsmaller apartment and she didn\u2019t come wi -- come with us.",
        "A: Cleaning and cooking.",
        "A: Right. Of course, the maid was there as a babysitter --",
        "A: -- when my parents wanted to go out.",
        "A: Lot of time with my mother, because my father was --",
        "A: Working quite hard. But we frequently took vacations. In fact, we were fairly close to the\nCzech border.",
        "A: And over a weekend we would go into Czechoslovakia, just to get out of there.",
        "A: By car.",
        "A: My father had a car. The car was not parked at the house because you couldn\u2019t, you know, it\nwas in a garage maybe a mile away.",
        "A: And you had to get it from there. But we traveled by car all over the place, quite often. Then\nwhen we went into Breslau to live with my mother\u2019s family, we often went by train.",
        "A: And my grandmother, when she came to visit us, came by train. And where my brother was\ngoing to school in Breslau, on the weekend he came home and frequently I used to pick him up\nat the train station and we would walk home, just the two of us.",
        "A: [honestly can\u2019t answer that. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I -- I guess it was a little bit of both.",
        "A: He was always my big brother, he was always there to help me out, all my life. And I don\u2019t\nknow whether I felt it\u2019s nice to be alone.",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t think I did. Because I went to school by this time also.",
        "A: Six.",
        "A: But when I was five years old I went to a nursery school, a kindergarten, I mean --",
        "A: -- here we -- it\u2019s part of the school system, there it was separate. The same lady was in charge\nof that kindergarten that was in charge when my brother went there. And by this time it was 1935\nor SO.",
        "A: And, you know -- you know, it\u2019s 1935, and I remember very clearly the door ringing at our\nhouse, and I opened the door. There is Miss Schroeder with a big bouquet of flowers, and tears in\nher eyes, coming to see my mother. Well, it turned out that one of the other kids, five year old\nkid, his parents objected to t-to being -- to having a Jew in his kindergarten class. So this was my\nfirst experience of anti-Semitism. So obviously I had to leave, and Miss Schroeder couldn\u2019t do\nanything, and this guy was also a physician, the father of this other kid. So I had to leave. But\nthis was shortly before I had to enter regular school. And when my mother took me to school my\nfirst day of school, it turned out that that same kid would be in the same class as me. So she went\nto the principal, explained the situation, and he put me into a parallel class. Turned out that I was\nthe only Jewish kid in the whole school, but at least I wasn\u2019t in with this one.",
        "A: I-In the kindergarten it was this particular person. And I made friends in school, like any kid.\nGot real friendly with two other boys, they were separate, boys and girls were separate in that\nschool. And one kid had a birthday party, he invited me, the other one was fine, and of course\nmy time to have a birthday party, I invited both of them, they both said they\u2019d come. The next\nday one of them said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my parents won\u2019t let me come.\u201d",
        "A: And I remembered his name, his name was Webber, his last name was Webber. Many years\nlater, I was in the amer -- I was this G.I. in the American army, stationed back in Europe, and I\ntried to make contact with my former teacher. And somebody wrote me, my name is Webber,\nyou must remember, you went to school with my brother, and basically they wanted some help.\nSo I wrote him back, yes I remember him very well. You didn\u2019t want to have any contact with a\nJew, now you do? But the nice thing at that point was that I made contact with my grade school\nteacher. He was a wonderful person. When Crystal Night came about, I went to school. The\nsynagogue was far enough away from us that I didn\u2019t see what was going on, we were not in the\ndowntown area where all this Jewish retail stores got ruined. And I found out in school what had\noccurred. And when I came home, my mother received me at the door in tears. My father had\nbeen called out to somebody who had been beaten by the Gestapo. And while he was in that\nperson\u2019s house, they came to our house to -- for my father. He was then picked up at his patient\u2019s\nhome and taken to prison. And after that, every day, this teacher, his name was Thiel, came and\nsat on -- next to me on my chair, is your dad home yet? Every day. After five days my da -- dad\ndid come home. The chief of police in our little town took it upon himself not to send anybody to\nthe concentration camp that had been an officer in the German army. And as a physician, my\nfather was a lieutenant during World War I, so after five days he came home. Right after he came\nhome the word came out that Jews are not allowed to go to public school any more. So they kept\nme home, my parents kept me home. Mr. Thiel, when he saw me on the street afterwards, would\nstop his -- jump off his bike, he used to travel around bike, and see how I was doing. And when\nmy birthday came around, he came to our house to bring all the papers, and all the books that I\nhad. And he told my mother he was so glad that I didn\u2019t show up that day because the principal\nsent somebody in, you\u2019ve got the only Jew in the whole school, send him home. And he hadn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t have to do that in front of the other kids. So I got in contact with him in 1951 - \u2019?52. We\nhave corresponded for awhile, he was in a little town too far off the beaten track --",
        "A: -- for me to visit him.",
        "A: He -- he -- he wasn\u2019t --",
        "A: He took a big chance --",
        "A: -- with what he was doing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to answer that, how it affected me, it\u2019s -- in a way I took it in stride. It\nbecame normal. The discrimination against you became a normal thing. Sounds ridiculous if I\nsay it now, but that\u2019s the feeling I have.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: It becomes the pattern of life -- excuse me -- as I said, my brother was in Breslau, and he was\nin Breslau at Crystal Night.",
        "A: He came home somehow or another, just be with us. But shortly after that was his birthday,\nhis 13\" birthday, his Bar Mitzvah. There was no Torah left in Liegnitz because the synagogue\ngot burned. So he brought his Torah home from Breslau. Some of the little shuls were in areas\nthat they couldn\u2019t burn, and there was a few Torahs left. He carried one on the train from Breslau\nback to Liegnitz. And we had the Bar Mitzvah in our house. And where we lived, that smaller\napartment, the second and third floor was a Jewish old age home, and we shared a larger\napartment with another family. And that\u2019s where we had his Bar Mitzvah. Many people had\ncome home from concentration camp. This is 1938. We have -- the family showed that they have\nintentions of leaving, they got out of the concentration camp.",
        "A: I remember these people coming home with shaven heads.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, concentration camp was an everyday word. An uncle of mine, the one that my\nbrother lived with, in the family, he was taken into concentration camp earlier than Kristallnacht.\nThere was some activity, I forgot what they called it, where if you had any -- done anything\nillegal years before, you end up -- you got taken into prison again. My uncle did some cheating, I\nguess, on the income tax, I don\u2019t know, at one point it got punitive action, he paid his penalty,\nbut that wasn\u2019t enough. They used that excuse to take him. And he couldn\u2019t take it, he went up\nagainst the electric fence, got killed right then and there. My mother had a picture of him in\nShanghai, and had it on one of the tables, a man came in one time, he said, I know this man. I\nsaw him getting shot against the ca -- against the fence.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband.",
        "A: And, so all these things were told to me, I heard about them.",
        "A: Was all part of our life.",
        "A: They had sent their son to England to go to school, Cambridge. That\u2019s why they had the room\nfree for my brother to live in.",
        "A: He came back -- I\u2019m not even sure at this point whether he continued his schooling in Breslau\nor not.",
        "A: But I didn\u2019t go back to a regular school.",
        "A: I had the young woman come in to sta -- give me tutoring, private lessons.",
        "A: In the home for the aged.",
        "A: There\u2019s quite a few people there.",
        "A: Yeah, and a little anecdote, my mother had a big dinner for everybody and turned out that it\nwere -- we were 13 people. She was superstitious, so she quickly called a good friend who was a\nbachelor to come join us.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Oh, my brother\u2019s name is 0 -- as he was born was Hans.",
        "A: H-a-n-s. But he changed it to Henry when we became Americanized.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: With one n. The only one who wouldn\u2019t take it off was my mother. She said, \u201cI married your\nfather with two n\u2019s and I\u2019m going to keep the two n\u2019s.\u201d",
        "A: And my father had already passed away by that time.",
        "A: No, it was a ch -- it was a cheerful home. We had no, you know, I have no bad memories of\nthat at all. Played out in the backyard with the other kids, and played cowboys and Indians and\nwe got dressed up, and these were all non-Jewish kids that lived in that area.",
        "A: The river was not -- was two or three blocks away. And in winter that\u2019s where we dragged our\nsled and sled -- sled down the side of the riverbank. In the spring and summer it was a beautiful\narea to walk. I remember walking there with my mother and at the end of the trail, bu -- there\nwas some farmyard which usually had some piglets there, and so -- it\u2019s all very pleasant\nmemories. The unpleasant parts were like I mentioned, the fact that I got kicked out of nursery\nschool, had the problems in school, then couldn\u2019t go there. But most of the unpleasant memories\nare actually things I heard about. You know, my parents talked about this person got taken to jail\nfor whatever reason, that person disappeared. And most of it didn\u2019t really get bad for me until\nKristallnacht.",
        "A: No, th --",
        "A: There was movies.",
        "A: There were movies.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Saw Laurel and Hardy, and things like that.",
        "A: But there was a theater that my parents attended, I mean adult theater, but I don\u2019t remember\ngoing to the theater at all. [indecipherable] And movies you didn\u2019t go that often.",
        "A: In summer there was ice cream stands, it wasn\u2019t like here where you could eat ice cream all\nyear long, you just ate it in summer.",
        "A: And then once in a ye -- once a year a circus came to town, I remember going to that. But I\nhad no unpleasant mem -- personal memories.",
        "A: Personally, they didn\u2019t get bad. Eventually, after I\u2019ve said this I realize that that wasn\u2019t quite\ntrue. There used to be kids that used to attack me and start hitting on me, called me a Jew, and all\nkinds of names. But didn\u2019t happen that often. When I came home from Hebrew school, I\nremember once being attacked by three or four kids. It was --",
        "A: Well, not seriously, you know.",
        "A: No, [ ran.",
        "A: Yeah. The other thing that I remember is 1n school there were religious classes, and that\nreligion was taught in school. My initial teacher, Mr. Thiel used to tell me, well, just sit in class\nand don\u2019t participate. And then one year I got another teacher and he had me leave the classroom\nfor the religious class. And some of the other kids had s -- said, I didn\u2019t know you were Jewish.\nThey didn\u2019t realize I was. And that was tough because I went outside, I was the only one in the\nwhole school, for an hour. It wasn\u2019t long enough to go home, so I just wandered around the area\nand then got back into class. So the fact that I was set aside was hard to take.",
        "A: No, I-I think it was either \u201937 or \u201938.",
        "A: Just --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh he -- no, he --",
        "A: He was still allowed to practice, and at one point he was not allowed to practice any more\nexcept for Jews.",
        "A: In our town -- I don\u2019t know how many Jewish doctors there were, but he was the one that was\nassigned to practice for Jews.",
        "A: Yes. He became much more serious to me, much more ver -- worried about everything.\nSeriously starting to talk about emigrating, getting out of Germany. Started to check into going\nto Palestine. And this was before Crystal Night. Then, after Crystal Night we made contact with\nfar enough relatives in the United States. Our papers at the office, the Palestine office got burned,\nso everything there got -- had to be started from scratch again.",
        "A: Crystal Night.",
        "A: And, you know, in my mind as a child, I was looking forward to this big trip we\u2019re going to\ntake someplace, somewhere. And some people started talking about going to Shanghai.\nShanghai, being an international city, it -- you didn\u2019t need any papers, any visas, or anything like\nthat. All you needed was to get on a ship and get there. But it had a bad reputation, and people\ndidn\u2019t want to go there, including my parents. So one time after Crystal Night, we had friends\nover the house for a dinner -- I don\u2019t know if it was a Friday night dinner or not, but one person\nsaid, you know what? I\u2019m not sticking around her any more. I\u2019m going to Shanghai. Second\nperson said I\u2019Il join you, my father said, I'll join you. If that wouldn\u2019t have happened, we\nprobably would have been stuck in Germany. By this time we had an affidavit from the United\nStates and in my parent\u2019s mind we\u2019ll go to Shanghai for a year or two until our number gets\ncalled up and then we go to the States.",
        "A: And that\u2019s how we eventually ended up in Shanghai.",
        "A: I just heard --",
        "A: It\u2019s a strange place, you know, I looked it up on an atlas where it is. In the meantime, my -- a\ncouple of my uncles her -- moo -- moved to Panama, and I followed on the atlas where they\nwent, you know, we all -- all the trips of course were by ship, it wasn\u2019t by plane. So he stopped\nat many different places. And I was looking forward to this adventure. So we decided to go on a\nDutch liner instead of a German or Italian like most people did. The advantage on a Dutch liner\nis that the so-called board money, you could take right out. The Germans allowed you x number\nof dollars, or marks, of course, to take on board the ship, to spend on the ship, but not to take off\nthe ship. So when you went on a German liner, they strictly adhere to that. On the Dutch liner\nthat we went to, the purser said to my father, well didn\u2019t you lose x number of dollars gambling\nlast night? Didn\u2019t you buy a box of cigars? And all that was written down and two days after we\nleft Europe, he had all his money in his pocket.",
        "A: Whatever amount that was.",
        "A: Oh yes, very well.",
        "A: To get all your heavy stuff on, you got from the freight company something they called a lift,\nwhich was like a big box, size of a room, and everything gets put in there. And when you were\npacking that, somebody from the Gestapo was there watching what you were packing. Well,\nwhen they came to do this packing, my mother sent me outside to play. And I had some play\nmoney, which was back from the German inflation in the 20\u2019s, had absolutely no value. And she\nwas getting ready to pack that, and the guy from the Gestapo was -- put up a fuss, you can\u2019t take\nthat. And she was arguing, that\u2019s my kid\u2019s play money, it has no value. I don\u2019t know for sure any\nmore whether we left -- let him keep it or not, but I told my mother, \u201cLet him have it, I don\u2019t\ncare.\u201d You know, it\u2019s just play money.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I walked in and --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They were actually a little nasty at the beginning and then my mother gave them a drink, and\nthey calmed down a bit. And some of the little knickknacks that we had, she gave one person this\nand one person that. It wasn\u2019t really bribery in any sense, but it softens them up in a way.",
        "A: And my parents also had the idea that maybe we can get off the ship somewhere before we\nget to Shanghai. I mean, India was still part of Britain, the Philippines was part of the United\nStates, Singapore was part of Britain. We thought we could maybe get off there.",
        "A: So they decided that this lift with all our belongings should be kept by the freight company\nuntil they got the word from us.",
        "A: Instead -- instead of being shipped at the same time as we were.",
        "A: I mean, the ship we were on was a passenger ship, it wasn\u2019t a freighter, and the lift would\nhave to go on a freighter. The -- obviously we didn't get off anyplace. Ended up in Shanghai and\nthen contacted the freight company, she -- send it to us, this is our address. But in the meantime\nit\u2019s July of 1939. By the time this lift gets onto a freighter 1t\u2019s September, and the war breaks out.\nAnd all German ships get the signal, go into a neutral port. The Dutch is -- East Indies, which are\nnow Indonesia, were still neutral, so the ship ran into a neutral port in Dutch East Indies, and we\nhad to pay a fair amount of money to get it from there to Shanghai.",
        "A: But eventually we got it all.",
        "A: She packed it.",
        "A: She packed it all. I mean, I didn\u2019t do any packing per se.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we took some toys.",
        "A: Games, yeah.",
        "A: We had some of it on the ship, and some of it was on the freight -- in the -- in the lift. So I had\na few toys, to [indecipherable]",
        "A: We took a train to Genoa. We took a train through Germany to say good-bye to relatives.",
        "A: My father\u2019s brother was in Upper Silesia. We had tried to talk him to join us in shan -- to\nShanghai and he refused. So we went there, we went to Berlin to say good-bye to some former\nfriends and relatives and to the western -- I mean, we really did a whole tour around Germany by\ntrain and eventually came to Genoa.",
        "A: I guess he sold it, I mean --",
        "A: I never thought about that.",
        "A: But he must have sold it. When we came to the border, they had everybody get off -- not\neverybody, all the Jews get off the train to be searched, body searched. And this was middle of\nthe night, I was fast asleep. So my mother said to the Gestapo, SS guy, whoever he was, \u201cCan I\nleave my kid here?\u201d He says, \u201cYou can if you want to, but I\u2019m not guaranteeing that the train\nwon\u2019t take off without you.\u201d So she woke me up. I did not have to strip, but my parents did. And\nthe amount of money that my father was allowed to take out, he had more on him than he was\nallowed to, he telegraphed that to his brother. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Send --",
        "A: -- to do that.",
        "A: So we took out only what was legal. At this point my father didn\u2019t want to mess anything up\nfor a few dollars. And then we went on the train to Genoa, and my mother\u2019s sister, whose\nhusband had been killed in the concentration camp earlier, was living in Milan. And she came to\nsay good-bye to us. And her train and our train came together. I was walking through the train\nand all of a sudden there\u2019s Tante Trude. I ran into her arms. And she came to Genoa with us and\nsaw off -- saw us off from the pier. I can still see her waving to us as we were leaving.",
        "A: Well, her s -- husband had been killed.",
        "A: Her only child, her son, was in England, so she eventually got to England.",
        "A: By the time te -- she got to England --",
        "A: -- he had managed to go to Palestine and join the British Brigade at Palestine. And eventually\nshe joined him in Palestine.",
        "A: She was always -- she would -- she was telling us later on the ship was blacked out that she\ntook from England to go to Palestine. She went to Palestine legally.",
        "A: This was before the illegal --",
        "A: -- immigrations. But it was in middle of the war. But she was there to see us off, and\neventually we got to meet her -- meet up with her again.",
        "A: It was -- took about six weeks.",
        "A: Well, I have a tendency to get seasick very easily.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know that beforehand. But the Dutch liner was a luxury liner and they had special --\nin the dining room the children were not allowed to eat with the parents and I hated that idea. So\nI was in a separate room with the little kids, you know, the two and three years old --",
        "A: -- and o -- me at nine years old, I felt I was big enough to do that, you know, to be with my\nparents.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t like that at all.",
        "A: And you would still see land when I got seasick the first time. I don\u2019t know whether that has\nto do with seasickness or just anxiety about being left alone. But eventually it got alright, had\nping pong tables, I learned to count to 21 in -- in Dutch.",
        "A: Yes, we --",
        "A: We had, so --",
        "A: That was a lot of fun.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, well, mainly Dutch kids and my brother s -- kids, there was a big swimming pool and I\ndidn\u2019t know how to swim yet, but my brother did, and he enjoyed that a great deal. And I had a\ngood time on the ship.",
        "A: Mr. and Mrs. Ritter, and Mr. and Mrs. Braun, Braun, and a Mr. Salinger. We were nine\npeople altogether. Mr. and Mrs. Braun were the people that we shared this apartment with in\nGermany -- in Liegnitz.",
        "A: They had three children, they had left Germany before that. One went to Argentina, one went\nto Holland, and one went to England.",
        "A: They were older kids. Little older, not that much older.",
        "A: Teena -- late teenagers --",
        "A: -- I believe, or maybe early 20\u2019s, or -- I have no idea. And they -- it was very tragic what\nhappened to them, the -- we were in Shanghai for about a year when they got a telegram from\nArgentina that their son had committed suicide down there. Reason, of course I don\u2019t know.\nTheir other son who went to Holland was caught up by the Nazis --",
        "A: -- and disappeared. And their daughter survived in England, that\u2019s who they went to after the\nwar. The Ritters had two sons, the younger of which was my brother\u2019s age, the other one was a\nlittle bit older.",
        "A: And they had gone to Palestine before that, and they were in Palestine. The Ritters went --\nwent to them when the war was over. When we all left Shanghai they went to Palestine. Mr.\nRitter had a heart attack on the ship the day it landed in Palestine. And whether he got to\nrecognize his son or not, I don\u2019t know, but his sons were able to see him before he died. Mr.\nSalinger is another interesting story. He was married to a non-Jewish woman, they had a son.\nShe would not go with him to Shanghai, so they divorced. The son was eventually drafted into\nthe German army. When the war was over, he went back to her.",
        "A: And lived in what became East Germany. His son survived also.",
        "A: But the f -- this group of nine people, once we got to Shanghai, we rented a house -- actually\nwere some more people, I mean -- it was the equivalent of a townhouse, and we all lived in there.\nHenry and I -- Hans became Henry ba -- were the only children, so my family had two rooms, all\nthe others had one room. They had a joint kitchen, everybody cooked together.",
        "A: And eventually made that into a luncheon area for other people. But especially the Ritters saw\ntheir sons in my brother and I.",
        "A: As I started school in Shanghai they were always interested in how I did, and so on.",
        "A: Yeah, well we were close to them --",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t consider them relatives, I think they considered us more their children --",
        "A: -- than we considered them our parents.",
        "A: Oh, just as close with the Brauns.",
        "A: Yes. And sal --",
        "A: -- sal -- also --",
        "A: -- wi -- wi -- also, was very cl -- very closely --",
        "A: -- knit group.",
        "A: Exciting and scary both.",
        "A: Everything was so strange. First of all, Shanghai, the waterfront 1s called the Bund, which\nprior to World War II had these giant, beautiful buildings, high rise buildings right around, they\nlook very impressive. But then you saw these coolies, these are the workman. When they took\nthe heavy stuff and carried it on bamboo sticks, walking one man in front, one man behind on\nbamboo sticks, in a singsong voice so they kept their tread going so they moved smoothly. This\nwas weird to see. Then you saw the rickshaws, where a man actually pulling a little wagon all\nalong the street. And then the poverty, the beggars on the street, crippled to some degree, trying\nto beg stuff. And Mrs. Ritter had a sister who was in Shanghai already, they actually were there\nto welcome us. They said, well most of the refugees are moving into the Hongkew area.\nHongkew was a part of Shanghai that had been devastated during the war between the Japanese\nand the Chinese. Many refugees, most refugees ended up there and started to rebuild the area.\nPeople were put into what was referred to as homes. One room per family, large rooms where\npeople were living together. And everybody warned us against that, so this is where we didn\u2019t\nwant to go. So the first thing we did was go into a hotel on Bubbling Well Road and stayed there\nfor awhile, well I stayed there while the adults went out shopping for a place to live.",
        "A: This -- this is where --",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s -- the German name for it is Mensch Argere dich Nicht. I\u2019m not quite sure what it is\ncalled in England, but it\u2019s a board game.",
        "A: And while they were going around, I sat down there in the hotel lobby, whoever wanted to\nplay with me, played with me. I won every game, I don\u2019t know if it was purposely or not, but it\nkept me busy, it kept me from running around. But looking at it back now, my parents left me as\na nine year old kid in a strange hotel.",
        "A: But nothing happened, I\u2019ve ha -- I had fun, people enjoyed having a little kid there. And these\nwere not necessarily Chinese, these were Americans, British, French, all kinds of people.",
        "A: Rue Ratard. In French, everything was [indecipherable]. And that\u2019s where we eventually\nended up.",
        "A: I walked with my parents a little bit.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember too much of that.",
        "A: No. But it\u2019s -- when I, 50 years later went back to revisit Shanghai, we stayed at a very fancy\nhotel in approximately the same area. So I rec --",
        "A: As -- no, as the other -- as the other hotel.",
        "A: It was on the same street. That hotel wer -- I couldn\u2019t find any more.",
        "A: The Burlington Hotel was the name of it, but I couldn\u2019t find that. But there was this very\nfancy, modern hotel, which I believe was built up in approximately the same area.",
        "A: Well, part of it, I did.",
        "A: My wife and I were -- went walking, I said, \u201cYou know, down this street, I believe is where\nmy school used to be.\u201d She said, \u201cWell let\u2019s go.\u201d So we walked down there, I said, \u201cIf I\nremember correctly there was a big wall, a cement wall around it, and behind the wall was a\nsynagogue and this Jewish school.\u201d",
        "A: And bingo, there it was.",
        "A: The school was now a government building. We couldn\u2019t go into it, but I recognized it.",
        "A: And the synagogue was there, it became sort of a museum, and we were able to go into it.\nAnd those things I recognized.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Lot of people did, and they were transported by trucks to the homes or other places in\nHongkew.",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to remember, I don\u2019t know whether we went by -- h-how we got to that hotel. I\nimagine we went by cab, but I couldn\u2019t tell --",
        "A: No, we used rickshaws later on, but I don\u2019t believe we took rickshaws to the hotel, however I\n-- my memory fails me on that one.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think as a nine year old child I could --",
        "A: -- detect that. I know that we -- the ship docked on the other side of the river, you know,\nShanghai is along a river, and we took like a little ferry boat --",
        "A: -- to the Custom House area where we came in, and on that ferry boat, there was somebody\nfrom the Jewish community, from Jewish committee in Shanghai who sort of clued us in a little\nbit. But what he clued us in 1s, he showed us the Garden bridge, the bridge going over the\nSuzhou creek on one side of which was the International Settlement under British control and the\nother side was already under Japanese control. And he told us that you have to walk across this\nbridge, you can\u2019t drive across it, that you have to show your papers to the Japanese guard, and\nthe Chinese people that are crossing there always had to take off their hat and bow down to the\nJapanese. And somebody made s-some remark, well, what are we coming to here? It sounds as\nbad as what we\u2019ve left behind. And that of course, is where the homes were, that\u2019s where the\nmost refugees began to live. But we, somehow or another didn\u2019t go there. We ended up at this\nBurlington Hotel.",
        "A: And as I say, I don\u2019t recall how we got there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We just walked in. I bi -- I mean -- obviously we had to register at the hotel, but --",
        "A: -- not registered as --",
        "A: Formal [indecipherable]. I imagine we did, but I don\u2019t remember any [indecipherable]",
        "A: I didn\u2019t. My parents had to --",
        "A: -- they had their German passports still, with the big J in it. And we as children were listed in\nthat passport --",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t have our separate passport.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t too long.",
        "A: Be -- maybe a week or two.",
        "A: No, actually not, no --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s -- the French Concession stretched along, you know, mi-might say it\u2019s parallel to the\nInternational Settlement. The French Concession had the nicer living quarters. Even today it still\nhas --",
        "A: -- the nicer living quarters. And what I do remember is like, the streetcars that could only go\nup to one point and then you had to take another streetcar on the other side. And there were\ntrolley cars that were driven by electricity, but no tracks. So the electricity was different in the\nFrench area that it was in the in -- in the International Settlement.",
        "A: When they got there, one guy jumped off the car, they took a running start, pulled the wires\ndown, ran across the street and then hooked the wires back up on the other side. And that\u2019s how\nyou got from one end to the other. It wasn\u2019t too far away because from there I was able to walk\nto school.",
        "A: And school was in the International Settlement.",
        "A: It was a Jewish school.",
        "A: The Shanghai Jewish school.",
        "A: No, we came in July of -- and they were overcrowded there, and I had a hard time -- my\nparents had a hard time getting us registered. Eventually we did, but by this time it was\nSeptember, or October. I think it was after the Jewish holidays.",
        "A: The principal, he was called Reverend Brown. Course, was all British schooling, and my first\nday in school they had a dictation. I ac -- should go back a little bit to -- when I was being\ntutored in Liegnitz, I was also tutored in English.",
        "A: So for about half the year I had some English lessons. And that was my whole experience in\nEnglish. Now I come into this class, it\u2019s being taught in English, we have a dictation, where you\nwrite down everything. The teacher knows I -- where I came from, so she corrected every word I\nmisspelled, which was practically every word. You\u2019ve never seen so much red ink on one piece\nof paper. But it didn\u2019t take long. They put me in a class a year younger than I was --",
        "A: I guess it was second grade, I had not -- I don\u2019t even remember for sure what grade, they\ncalled it form, the British school.",
        "A: Form. But I was -- I mean, the kids in class were a year younger than I.",
        "A: And after a year I caught up enough to be put into my regular class.",
        "A: Everything was taught in English. But as a child, you pick this up very quickly. The other\nchildren were help -- the teachers were helpful. Some of the other kids were refugee kids that\nwere there a little longer than I, they helped. I joined the Cub Scouts, right -- you know, about a\nyear later.",
        "A: Boy Scouts, and --",
        "A: What -- I do -- I don\u2019t remember what number --",
        "A: -- it was, but he was obviously four years ahead of me, however, he only went to school for\nabout a year and a half.",
        "A: And then he was sent to work.",
        "A: Very little, very --",
        "A: At ho -- home we spoke German, in school we spoke English.",
        "A: English was the main language that you were able to [indecipherable] get along with.\nObviously it\u2019s Chinese, but even Chinese wasn\u2019t [indecipherable] I mean, the Shanghai dialect is\nquite different from Mandarin, which is the main language of China today. My brother picked up\nChinese --",
        "A: -- where he worked. I never did, other than a few words here and there, some which you --\ncurse words you learn very easily in every language. But my parents lived within this Jewish --\nGerman Jewish community.",
        "A: In the French Concession, we had [indecipherable] contact with other people. My father tried\nto open a practice, he actually took an office for about a year or so in the International\nSettlement. But the refugees as a rule did not come to him because they didn\u2019t have any money,\nthe Chinese didn\u2019t come to him. He had recommendation to two -- to two physicians, and they\nwere very nice to us, they helped my father out, taught him something about [indecipherable]\ndiseases. But all in all my father was not able to make a living from his practice. He tried all\nkinds of things. One time somebody offered him a job in the leprosy colony, my mother put her\nfoot down on that. She said, that we don\u2019t need.",
        "A: Leprosy is -- you know, has a bad name to it.",
        "A: Very bad reputation. And -- but one time somebody was looking for my father and I said, well\nhe\u2019s in that hospital over there. And I said well come on, I\u2019Il -- P\u2019Il take you there. And I took off\nwith these two complete strangers to show them where my father was. My mother was horrified.\nYou know, you hear about kidnapping and all that kind of stuff. But I was perfectly at ease to do\nthat. And we walked to school every day and I caught up fairly quickly with my class.",
        "A: Sat around.",
        "A: Doing nothing. Became very depressed. Eventually these nine people decided to open up a\nlittle lunch room, you know? Noon time was the main meal that you ate in Europe. There were a\nlot of people there who didn\u2019t know how to cook, pi -- single bachelors, what have you. They\nloved the lunch room, but inflation went -- was so rampant, that we didn\u2019t make any money. We\nbasically paid for our own food. And my father acted like a maitre d\u2019, you know, welcoming\npeople, seating them, etcetera. In between he still practiced a little bit. My mother did most of the\ncooking. The other men did the shopping, they used to go out and come back on the rickshaw\nwith all the food. There wasn\u2019t much refrigeration there, so you had to buy the food the same day\nthat you were cooking it.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t know for how many years that lasted, but it lasted for a little while. My mother\nalso baked cakes for people. And what we loved is when one of the cakes didn\u2019t come out right.\nThen --",
        "A: -- that was not good enough to sell, but --",
        "A: -- good enough for us to eat.",
        "A: She -- she learned -- she became an excellent cook.",
        "A: But cooked everything in the German style. I mean --",
        "A: -- no Chinese food, per se. She took the Chinese vegetables, and somehow or another --",
        "A: -- made it into German food, which is, of course, what everybody loved.",
        "A: She also adj -- when -- once we got our furniture, she got her sewing machine, and she started\nsewing for people. So she did -- whatever money we made, was made by her.",
        "A: Terribly demoralized.",
        "A: And the end result of that was that my brother took on the job of being the head of the\nhousehold.",
        "A: He began to speak English, he began to speak some Chinese. He was able to maneuver\nthroughout the city, and one of these doctors that my father was referred to knew a machinist\nfrom Switzerland, and he suggested the Henry might get a job with him, which he did. But this\nplace was at the other end of town. It was -- I don\u2019t know how long it took him, but it took him\nabout an hour by bicycle to get there. And then he worked under the worst conditions.",
        "A: Alle -- yes.",
        "A: He was not very nice to Henry --",
        "A: -- and Henry has never forgiven my parents for what they -- that they send him out like that.\nBut they were desperate, my father especially was desperate. He didn\u2019t see how things are going\nto go on, you know. How long is this war going to take?",
        "A: So at 14, he worked -- he started to work full time.",
        "A: It was not -- it was typical in some instances.",
        "A: Doctors, lawyers -- lawyers had no way of --",
        "A: -- pro -- professionals.",

        "A: -- you did fine.",
        "A: If you did -- a watchmaker, you did fine.",
        "A: Talking about watchmaker, there was a watchmaker who we became friendly with later on,\nFlautto, he actually made watches and clocks from scratch. And when Roosevelt got re-elected in\n1940, he send Roosevelt wa -- a little clock that he had made as a present, and got a sec -- thank\nyou note. I became friendly with his son years later.",
        "A: So these are the people did very well, some people opened up little shops.",
        "A: And also we must remember my father was in this -- by this time 50 some years old.",
        "A: He was not a young person any more. He tried to learn other trades, but that didn\u2019t come easy\nto him. He was often taken advantage of, and we didn\u2019t trust the banks. Some of the money we\nhad was kept in either British pounds or American dollars, and then every time you needed some,\nyou changed it into China\u2019s currency.",
        "A: You didn\u2019t do that too much because the inflation was so tremendous. So my father one time\nwent and got some money in Chinese currency, on the Central Reserve Bank of China. He came\nhome with that and Henry said, \u201cDoctor, you got taken. Central Reserve Bank, that\u2019s the bank of\nthe Chinese puppet government under the Japanese [indecipherable] government. It\u2019s not going\nto be worth much.\u201d But shortly afterwards the Japanese took over China --",
        "A: And then it became the currency to have. So where he thought he was taken he actually got\nahead of everybody.",
        "A: They controlled all of Hongkew, actually.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Was taken over on December eighth.",
        "A: At that --",
        "A: [indecipherable] in 1941.",
        "A: But up until that point it was still separate.",
        "A: Had this separate government, they had the French government on one area which was like a\nFrench colony and --",
        "A: -- then the British were primarily in charge of the International Settlement.",
        "A: There was an amer -- American presence there, too. There were American Marines at the --\nthey were actually stationed right across the street from our school. There were American Marine\nbarracks.",
        "A: And then December seventh, which of course, because of the International Dateline,\nDecember eighth in Shanghai, the Japanese took over the rest of the town, the -- both the French\nand the British --",
        "A: -- at the International Settlement. Even prior to that, the allies knew that they can\u2019t stay there\nforever, so many of the people living in Shanghai had already left back to the States, or France,\nwherever. Not France, because France was at war already. And there were two British -- two\ngunboats left in the harbor, a British and an American. And the Japanese started bombarding\nthem. And the story goes that one surrendered and one went down, ship and all.",
        "A: But these were -- these are stories, I --",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t know these to be facts.",
        "A: What I do know is that December eighth was a Monday and I walked to school like always.\nWe had by this time moved out of this building that we were sharing with our friends, to\nsomeplace else, further away from the waterfront. We didn\u2019t hear the firing, we didn\u2019t hear the\nbombardment. And we rode to work, which was in the Japanese area. I went to school, and the\nkids, did you hear the bombardment, the Japanese are taking over. We got called into the\nauditorium, the principal told us about Pearl Harbor and that the Japanese at this moment are\ntaking over the rest of the city. As he is speaking, we hear troops marching by the school,\nJapanese troops were marching by, occupying the Marine barracks across the street from us. And\nI still recall seeing the ja -- the American flag go down and the Japanese flag go up over the\nMarine barracks. And then they send us all home. By the time I ca -- came home, a kid a year or\ntwo younger than I had gotten home a few minutes before me, he told my parents and his parents\nall kinds of stories, they couldn't make heads or tails out of him, he was so nervous. I was the\nfirst one to tell them about Pearl Harbor and the Japanese taking over. In this time they worried\nsick about my brother.",
        "A: And he pedaled all the way through all this military takeover back home from where he was\nworking. And after this my parents decided it\u2019s time to move into Hongkew, into the area where\nall the refugees are living.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They all decided to go to Hongkew and my mother still didn\u2019t want to go to Hongkew.",
        "A: So they -- they --",
        "A: -- moved to Hongkew and we moved in with another family into a small apartment.",
        "A: Yes, it started with a K.",
        "A: Kinear Road.",
        "A: I think yes, Kinear Road.",
        "A: No, that was --",
        "A: -- in the International Settlement.",
        "A: But further, I guess, to the west, away from the harbor.",
        "A: Further away from Hongkew. A good ways away from Hongkew.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They must have been --",
        "A: -- but I di -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not aware of it. I mean, they had no choice. I mean, I walked to school\nby myself, and sometimes with friends.",
        "A: But we always -- it was always daytime, I didn\u2019t walk around at night.",
        "A: Yes. The Chinese were very poor and very dirty at that time. They had a child, an infant\nmight die, they didn\u2019t bury it. They wrapped it in newspaper and put it out on the sidewalk. So I\nsee this on the sidewalk, I cross over on the other side of the street, not to be close to it. I see\nthat. I see sometimes dogs na -- around these infant corpses.",
        "A: You could see that it was something covered.",
        "A: I hob -- I wasn\u2019t curious enough to go close to it.",
        "A: I knew what it was.",
        "A: You saw people who were crippled on the street, begging, pushing a tin plate in front of them.\nYou saw kids crying while the parents were poking them so they cry more, trying to beg. You\nhear and heard and saw thievery going on. There was the so-called hat-snatcher. You were sitting\nin the streetcar -- course, they were not air conditioned, was opened and the man had his hat on\nand just as the streetcar took off, somebody snatched the hat off.",
        "A: There was money in everything.",
        "A: There was a law in the International Settlement, if somebody steals a loaf of bread and takes a\nbite out of it, he cannot be punished, cause it shows that he was hungry.",
        "A: And we just try to be careful, but the worst part was the diseases. You couldn\u2019t -- everything\nhad to be boiled.",
        "A: Water had to be boiled, you could not eat any raw food. Salads were basically out of the\nquestion. Sometimes my mother took some salad and put -- poured boiling water over it, well, if\nyou put boiling water over a salad, it doesn\u2019t taste too good any more.",
        "A: The Chinese had little shops where they boiled water and sold boiling water. And we would\ngo there with a thermos, with tea leaves and a thermos, so get the boiling water, by the time we\ngot home we had tea.",
        "A: But they said, be sure you see the water boiling. It has to be bubbling. And that\u2019s a -- these\nwere big drums of water, so it took a long time for them to --",
        "A: -- really boil.",
        "A: The Chinese guy would like to sell it to you before he -- it was really boiling. We were told to\nbe careful about that. You couldn\u2019t walk barefoot. When the rains came, Shanghai flooded.\nShanghai was basically at or below sea level, so you had no basements, no house had basements\nlike we\u2019re used to over here. When it flooded, h-how did we get around? Took a rickshaw, and\nwe talked to the rickshaw pullee what you\u2019re going to pay him to go to wherever you want to go,\nand then in the middle of the street he\u2019d say no, I want more. He would just stop there, so you\nhad to pay more to go on.",
        "A: Yes, it could -- 1-1t was fairly deep, I -- let\u2019s say a foot or so at times.",
        "A: Yes, but they were not big enough, so you just had to watch what you\u2019re doing, and -- this\nwater was, of course, terribly filthy --",
        "A: -- and you could get all kinds of diseases. And we went through all sorts of illnesses.\nTyphoid, cholera. We got inoculated every six months against all these different illnesses.",
        "A: Well -- well, my father gave us the inoculation, I guess --",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t know where he got the stuff from. But everybody got inoculated, the health\ndepartment inoculated people on the street, but we were told not to get that, because you don\u2019t\nknow how clean those needles are.",
        "A: So you -- when you got inoculated, you got a certificate to show that you have been\ninoculated. But with all that going on, people still got ill.",
        "A: Yes -- not the early period, I got ill --",
        "A: -- later on.",
        "A: The early period we did fairly well.",
        "A: It was exciting, it was interesting, 1t was an adventure. Sometimes they had gangs that would\ngang up on you. Of course [indecipherable] like anyplace.",
        "A: No, this was because I was white.",
        "A: Chi -- chi -- Chinese.",
        "A: Chinese. And then the Russians, the Russian kids used to attack us, even in Hongkew later on.\nThere was a lot of Russian people living there, and one time my father had a Russian person\ncome up with one of his kids to -- something was wrong with him and he took care of him. And\nhe was in part -- h-he was in some of these gangs. So if he was in the gang they told them -- he\ntold the gang to leave me alone. I had my in with that.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that was always scary. You know, we didn\u2019t have that much money on us, so if they\nwant it, but --",
        "A: Whatever money you had. You gave them some money then you ran away.",
        "A: White Russians.",
        "A: Yes. White Russians.",
        "A: Yeah, there was a large Jewish Russian population.",
        "A: Very large. And some of them went to school with us, in the Shanghai Jewish school. But --",
        "A: -- we have to get --",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Hello.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Basically speaking, I believe he was just told you have to go out there. I don\u2019t think my father\nrealized where he sent Henry to, and how bad it would be. I think my father should have checked\nit out instead of just taking somebody\u2019s word for it.",
        "A: And sending this little kid, 14 years old, out to nowhere. And he didn\u2019t do that, he didn\u2019t\ncheck it out. You know, today if you send your son, or daughter, your child someplace, you\ncheck it out, whether it\u2019s a college, whether it\u2019s a work situation. That, he didn\u2019t do. They -- he\nwas -- my father was so panicked. He didn\u2019t know how he would feed his family. Here he comes\nfrom a upper middle class background as a physician. He had his dreams of sending his sons to\nsame university he went to. Maybe they would go into his profession or something similar. All\nthese dreams got shattered, and now he cannot even take care of them on a day to day basis. He\nwas wotried how to feed us the next day. What will happen to us. So when this opportunity came\naround, he grabbed it and it\u2019ll at least take care of us to some degree. Most of our quote unquote\nincome consisted of selling what we had. We brought a lot of stuff along on this -- in this lift,\nand that\u2019s what we lived on. It wasn\u2019t until substantially later that we actually got charity.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t contribute -- 1-1t couldn't have contributed that much. You know, I wasn\u2019t in on how\nmuch he\u2019s actually paying in.",
        "A: But, you know, primarily selling our products, my mother\u2019s work --",
        "A: -- was the main income.",
        "A: And I still went to school.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I think more later on than at that time. I think I was too young to be privy to si -- this.",
        "A: Henry -- Pll call him Henry --",
        "A: -- because that\u2019s the way I\u2019m used to it now, 1s a very private person, doesn\u2019t open up very\nmuch. And four years at that age is a long --",
        "A: -- 1s a big age difference. But while I made friends and had fun, in and out of school, he\ndidn\u2019t. He worked many hours, he came home dead tired, slept, back to work, and I wasn\u2019t aware\nof what he was going through at the time.",
        "A: Six days a week.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t --",
        "A: -- I was too young.",
        "A: Right -- almost within the first year that we were there.",
        "A: He was -- he stopped.",
        "A: He stopped. Yeah, he stopped and his education stopped, to a --",
        "A: -- great extent.",
        "A: I went to school for many more years and lot of things that I was learning in school he never\nwas taught, obviously he\u2019s self taught since then.",
        "A: But I had a better education at that point. And -- but I wasn\u2019t -- to answer your question\nhonestly, I wasn't aware [inaudible]",
        "A: You mean the relationship between my parents?",
        "A: It must have been very difficult.",
        "A: But again, a nine year old doesn\u2019t see that.",
        "A: I know my parents loved to play cards, especially my father, loved to play German card game\ncalled Skat, and I would set up my cot and go to sleep while they were playing cards. I mean, I\ncould sleep thr -- I slept through all of that.",
        "A: And my parents, you know, played with us, we played cards and car -- board games and\nthings like that. So we do -- did play together in that respect.",
        "A: I th -- think I saw more of what my mother went through, cooking and sewing, baking. And\nagain my father was devastated that his wife had to support the family. And Henry was the man\nof the house, anything that came up to be discussed with the landlord, with this, with that.",
        "A: He was involved in all these things.",
        "A: That went on all the time that we were in Shanghai.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, there was a time when we were living out there on -- not Combare, what was the name\nof the street?",
        "A: Kinear Road.",
        "A: On Kinear Road, where I thought my father went up on the roof to kill himself. My father\nused to sit in a chair and fall asleep in middle of the day. Typical sign of depression.",
        "A: And that was one of the worst time for us, when we were on Kinear Road, very far away from\nall our friends. And that is of course where we lived when the Japanese took over, and shortly\nafter that we moved to Hongkew. Whenever we moved, our apartment or room -- rooms, became\nsmaller and smaller. My mother and I used make a chart and figure out how we would set up the\nfurniture in the new place, and sometimes it was within an inch --",
        "A: -- that we could squeeze something in, and what we couldn\u2019t squeeze in, we sold. The move\nfrom Kinear Road into Hongkew was done on a push wagon, I mean it wasn\u2019t a truck, a\nmotorized truck , was hand pushed wagon all through the whole city of Shanghai.",
        "A: It\u2019s a very large trip. Th -- and then --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Pulling this cart.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s bigger than a rickshaw, it\u2019s two guys pushing it. And I guess one of us must\nhave walked along with them. Yeah, Henry walked along with them. Of course it\u2019s always Henry\nwho had to do the dirty work. My mother and I went ahead. We might have taken the rickshaw, I\ndon\u2019t remember these things for f -- facts. So that when they came there, we were able to put\neverything --",
        "A: -- into the house.",
        "A: Into the apartment and we put them where they are. What I do remember is that I was also\ntransferred to another school, from the Shanghai Jewish school, to the SJY A school, Shanghai\nJewish Youth Association school, normally referred to as the Kadoorie School --",
        "A: -- because Sir Alec Kadoorie gave the money for that school. And you know, I was cutting up\nthe last day in the other school. This one teacher didn\u2019t believe that I would be moving, so he put\nme on detention, and the next day when we were actually moving into the other apartment, he\nhappened to walk by and said, \u201cOh, you really were moving.\u201d And yeah, we were friendly after\nthat.",
        "A: Well, they were both the British system.",
        "A: The Kadoorie School was on the British system as well. It took me a little while to get used to\nthe Kadoorie School, certain things were different, but not long and I was very familiar with\neverything there.",
        "A: All Jewish.",
        "A: Well, this is Jewish refugee school.",
        "A: The other one was not just refugees, it\u2019s a Jewish school, th-the Russian Jewish kids there, the\nBritish Jewish kids, these are the people from India, and --",
        "A: -- that settled sh -- in Shanghai initially. I mean, they were both Jewish schools, and in the\nKadoorie School, the allied citizens had to wear ya -- armbands because the Japanese had already\ntaken over. So you had the British or American armbands and eventually these people were taken\ninto POW camps, and only the refugee teachers remained.",
        "A: And the refugee kids.",
        "A: There were basically none, other than refugee kids in that school. Mrs. Hartwich was the\nprincipal. Mr. Gassenheimer was my teacher, and he wer -- these teachers were excellent. They\nhad no textbooks to give us, so -- there were no textbooks so they had to teach out of one book,\nwe had to write everything down. But we learned so much. I mean, I was not even 14 yet, this\nwas 1941, I was 11 - 12. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Before my Bar Mitzvah. And we learned geometry, algebra, everything.",
        "A: When many years later I decided to take some night courses in Montgomery College here, I\ntook math and it was all a repeat, it was all what I had learned as a 12 year old kid. Gassenheimer\nwas ex -- a fantastic teacher. They were trying to teach us so many things all at one time. I mean,\neverything was taught in English, even though they were refugee teachers, they were all taught in\nEnglish. We -- being a Jewish school, we had Hebrew classes. Being in China, we had some\nChinese classes. Being under Japanese control, Japanese classes.",
        "A: And Mrs. Hartwich thought that we should also learn French. Now this wasn\u2019t one year of\nthis and one year of that, these were all --",
        "A: -- taught simultaneously. The end result 1s that we didn\u2019t learn anything to hold onto, a word\nhere and a word there 1s all that I remember. English and German is what remained because we\nstill spoke German at home. When we kids played, it was a mixture, we spoke both English and\nGerman interchangeably, but we had a good time as kids. There were no air raids --",
        "A: -- going on, none at all. We didn\u2019t have --",
        "A: That\u2019s -- that much later. That doesn\u2019t come about until Okinawa fell. You hav -- year or so\nlater I was Bar Mitzvah and you had to pay tuition at that school, and when my Bar Mitzvah\ncame about, Mrs. Hartwich came up to my parents, we usually don\u2019t give Bar Mitzvah presents,\nbut we like Ernest -- I don\u2019t know what they called me, er -- they didn\u2019t call me Ernie at that\ntime. Anyhow, you don\u2019t have to pay any more tuition.",
        "A: Be -- we -- everybody had to pay, and this was my Bar Mitzvah present from --",
        "A: It was very lovely.",
        "A: I obviously did very well. I --",
        "A: I -- I liked it. I was -- I mean, math was my forte. I was considered the best math student in\nthe school, not in the class, in the school.",
        "A: We were -- eventually kids dropped out as they went to work, so the last year there we were\n12 students in my class, six boys and six girls. We sat at a long table, the girls on one side, the\nguys on the other, teacher at the head. And I was the best math, it was a fellow by the name of\nHans Eberstark who was the best all around student. He -- he was -- is a genius. He eventually --\nhis hobby was to go to the library and learn the dictionary by heart. But he was also a lot of fun.\nHe went along with everybody with their jokes. He eventually started working for the United\nNations in Switzerland, and although I don\u2019t know these for facts, as things I\u2019ve heard, he helped\nwrite the Constitution for some of the new African nations, and as an interpreter for United\nNations. We also had theater that we put up in school.",
        "A: I was involved in it.",
        "A: I was in -- we did the part of Shakespeare, \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d I was Puck --",
        "A: -- in \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\u201d We also presented something in Japanese, where the\nJapanese paper came by and took a picture of us --",

        "A: No, on --",
        "A: The Shakespeare in English.",
        "A: Yeah, but the Japanese play was in Japanese.",
        "A: Well, they did, but --",
        "A: -- it didn\u2019t really matter that much. But we had -- the class had a great time, the 12 of us\nputting up these plays. We were 13 - 14 years old. No, not quite 14. But we really had a\nwonderful time there. And eventually my parents decided that I sh -- finished that school as\nmuch -- far as I could go, that I should go to work. In the meantime my brother had -- was able to\nconvince my parents at that place where he was working was not right, and through some\nacquaintances he found another place, working for a Korean company that made lathe, and\ndrilling machines and so on, where he was able to get a job for me. So I became an apprentice in\nthis machine factory under my brother, in a way. The factory had a small department where the -\n- we made all the little parts, little screws, pins, what have you. And we were about half a dozen\nrefugees working in there, including a Mr. Lawrence who was a foreman. And I worked there,\nand between my brother and I, we finally made a little bit more money than we were spending\neach day.",
        "A: 14.",
        "A: A year afterwards.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the announcement of the ghetto was in 1943.",
        "A: The announcement of the ghetto came while I was still in school.",
        "A: And I remember at that point, I mean we read the announcement, we read the borders that\nthere were, and we thought -- I thought we were okay. We were on the Seward Road, that\u2019s\nwhere the line was.",
        "A: But the line went down the middle of the street, and we were on the wrong side --",
        "A: -- of the street, and we had to move. Well, one of the girls that I was talking to about that, she\nthought they would have to move and she was on the correct side of the street.",
        "A: So we had to move, and now to find a place to live was very difficult. See, in the ghetto,\nnobody had to move out. The Chinese people didn\u2019t have to move out. You had to be in there\nwithin 90 days. Couldn\u2019t -- it was very hard to find anything until the Jewish organization bought\na part of a school and converted that school into small rooms and a few large halls. And you had\nto pay -- I forgot what they call it, key money or something like that, to be able to have one of\nthese rooms. And my father had to sell his microscope so that he could have the money for us to\nmove in there. So four of us moved into a room in the school. And it was very short distance to\nthe school for me to walk there. The school was actually outside the district.",
        "A: However, the Japanese basically like kids and let us go to school. We have --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t so terrible as a kid because I -- I don\u2019t think we ne -- actually needed it then,\nbut when I went to work, where I worked was outside.",
        "A: And we had to get it from Ghoya, and that was terrible because it had to be renewed every\nmonth, and sometimes you stood in line for a month to get the renewal. So you stood outside\nthere in every kind of weather, waiting for him to show up, then he showed up and gave a few\nrenewals, gave a lot of rejections. Yeah, in summer it was hot with the sun beating down on you,\nthen you went inside and scare -- you were scared, trying to get in front of this man who had\nsuch power over you. Initially some of the people decided not to follow -- not to move into the\ndistrict, so they were thrown into jail for a week. Didn\u2019t think a week\u2019s imprisonment was so\nbad, but these cells were infected. They came out and died like flies once they came out. And\nthat went on for the rest of the time.",
        "A: Okura was actually Ghoya\u2019s superior.",
        "A: But Okura wasn\u2019t personally involved that much with us.",
        "A: Ghoya was, he had a refugee man being his secretary, doing all the paperwork, but I don\u2019t\nrecall his name. But when Ghoya eventually got -- was out of it, this man just did every\n[indecipherable] just took care of everyone. He was very fine person. But Ghoya was terrible, it\u2019s\na -- Ghoya considered himself king of the Jews.",
        "A: Yes. He thought he was doing us all a favor.",
        "A: Our sports activities were mainly playing soccer and he used to come out to the soccer field,\nwhere we had to parade past him, just like you parade past a king, and view him. And everything\nwas fine and then the next morning for whatever reason, something he didn\u2019t like, he threw the\npeople in charge of the game into jail for a few days.",
        "A: They never knew how he would a -- react on anything. He used to hit people for no reason\nwhatsoever. And again, the kids he mainly left alone. I\u2019m talking about the adults.",
        "A: No, but my father got -- he said he got hit on the hand, just like this, and he said, \u201cI felt that\nfor hours.\u201d It was just [indecipherable]. And you know, the thing -- you were in such small\nquarters, everybody was on top of each other, slightest thing and people got into fights and\narguments. The refugee communit -- community started their own -- what did they call it? Like a\ncourt system, so it didn\u2019t have to go to the Japanese authorities. So you try to settle things outside\nof them. In the meantime, things got a little better for us because my father got a job with the --\nwith the hip -- not the hospital, but the -- well, with the hospital, yeah, yeah.",

        "A: -- actually he got the job with the free clinic.",
        "A: And with him getting a job in the free clinic, my brother and I working, we finally were able\nto make ends meet. In the meantime we had gotten onto charity. And before you could accept\ncharity, they community send a committee up to your house, you know, places where you live, to\nmake sure you had nothing left to sell, which was very demoralizing. But we got one hot meal a\nday, which was sort of a stew. My parents used to dig out the small pieces of meat there was, and\ngave it to Henry and I. My father lost over 50 pounds.",
        "A: Was -- basically both of them were skin and bones, trying to keep us going.",
        "A: No, us kids, we didn\u2019t, but you know --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I -- I -- I was not hungry, my -- but my parents saw to it that I was not hungry.",
        "A: Henry was not hungry.",
        "A: Yeah, she actually stopped that when we moved into the --",
        "A: -- into Hongkew, because she had no facilities there to do all that.",
        "A: So, I --",
        "A: She still had her sewing machine.",
        "A: Oh -- to the very end. When we finally -- the war is over and we made contact with her\nbrother in Baltimore, things happened very rapidly and she said, should I bring my sewing\nmachine or not, and we -- it never got to [indecipherable] anyhow, we sold it in Shanghai.",
        "A: And then she was sorry she didn\u2019t bring it with her. But -- was going to say something else.",
        "A: Oh, no I was going to ta -- at this time is when I had my Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: Which was basically a low point in our life, as financial is concerned. And my parents tried to\nmake the Bar Mitzvah pretty nice. The cantor that we had used to be an opera singer in Europe. I\ncan still see him, he looked like Pavarotti standing there in front of me, singing to me. It was\ndone very beautifully. Our neighbors had a little haberdashery store and he came up to my\nmother a month or so ahead of time to loan him one of my shirts, he wants to make one for\nsomebody, well he made a nice shirt for me. But what my mother had not realized, she gave him\none that I'd -- I\u2019d slightly outgrown. So the sleeves came up to here, and he had to attach\nsomething. That was my big present, was my shirt.",
        "A: And my Bar Mitzvah party consisted of coffee and cake. The rabbi came, my teacher came.\nAnd Gassenheimer was my teacher, the Hebrew teacher in our school --",
        "A: No, was not Gassenheimer.",
        "A: Was a Mr. we -- Webber, I believe. He was teaching everybody but he was going into a lot of\ndetails.",
        "A: Gassenheimer was not so Orthodox. It was easier with him, and I took lessons from him and\nthat went very well.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning of Tape Five",
        "A: Very short period of time.",
        "A: Two months maybe.",
        "A: Two th -- two, three months, something like that. But --",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t that so much, my birthday is December second.",
        "A: So when I approached Mr. Gassenheimer back in August sometime, he said, \u201cOh, December,\nwe got plenty of time.\u201d And first day back at school in sep -- early September, he calls me, he\nsays, \u201cI just looked it up, your Bar Mitzvah by the Jewish calendar is actually November 14\".\nWe\u2019re talking a lot sooner, we really have to get onto it.\u201d So we got onto it fairly rapidly. I don\u2019t\nhave a voice to sing, so I was just reading everything, and did fine. Everything went off pretty\nwell, I did okay.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I mean, I had ler -- started to learn Hebrew back in Germany.",
        "A: I could read Hebrew, couldn\u2019t speak it as a language --",
        "A: -- but, you know, I could read the Hebrew prayer books, and knew some of the translations,\nbut basically just reading it was no problem for me.",
        "A: No, I didn't --",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t do any speech.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: In the school.",
        "A: The school is where we also had services.",
        "A: In the main school auditorium, that\u2019s where we had services, we had youth services there to,\nwhere the kids from school did all the parts and I one time was the quote unquote rabbi --",
        "A: -- had a little talk on the subject, the Torah subject of the day. So that\u2019s where it was held.",
        "A: You know, it was very nice, and --",
        "A: At -- at our home.",
        "A: That\u2019s -- in that little apartment. This was before we moved into the SACRA --",
        "A: -- this was when we were on East Seward Road.",
        "A: -- so we actually had two rooms.",
        "A: Bigger, and you know, we didn\u2019t have that many people, maybe half a dozen people that\ncame over.",
        "A: Oh it -- I did drink coffee, but 1t probably was milk, or something like that.",
        "A: Don\u2019t remember that much.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The communal lunches really came about later, when we were in the SACRA building.",
        "A: We were not.",
        "A: Yes, we were eating three meals a day --",
        "A: -- and usually the noon meal was the main meal.",
        "A: I mean, we didn\u2019t have cereal, per se, that I recall.",
        "A: It was a light breakfast, some bread and butter and jelly, what have you. And I --",
        "A: She went to buy food daily --",
        "A: -- because of there was no refrigeration.",
        "A: And she managed very well to do that.",
        "A: Very small, like a little supper. But I can\u2019t honestly tell you what we were eating. I\u2019m -- the\nonly thing I remember 1s that my mother made -- you know --",
        "A: -- she did -- changed everything into German cooking. You know, people hear that I was\nliving in Shanghai, they think of me eating Chinese food. No, we didn\u2019t do that, we ate German\nfood. Many of the things we never heard of before. Some of it came through the Russians,\nthere\u2019s kasha.",
        "A: I remember that, and I hated it. But that --",
        "A: [hated it, I won\u2019t touch it now. But kasha was our cereal, and that was served to us. And\nother things, for example, Passover came about, the rabbi announced this particular cereal type\nof food is good for Passover, for those people who were Orthodox.",
        "A: Made up our own rules. Kasha, there was -- we drank a lot of tea, ate a dra -- ate a lot of rice,\nand for a long time after I came to the United States, I hardly touched tea or rice. Since then I\u2019ve\nbeen accustomed to it more.",
        "A: Yes, when -- when we had got our visa to come to the States, we went out to a quote unquote\nChinese restaurant.",
        "A: A nice Chinese place. Not the first time, it -- but I remember that time because we -- we ri --",
        "A: Yeah, we liked it. One time earlier, one of these doctors that my father had been referred to,\ntook us to a really fancy Chinese restaurant with several courses came in -- coming in. But I was\nvery little at that time, I didn\u2019t appreciate all of it, but it rel -- 1t can be nice.",
        "A: But most of the time it was make do with what was available.",
        "A: No, it was not. I -- I mean, again, as a child you don\u2019t know these things, but for my parents it\nmust have been terrible, not knowing how they\u2019re going to feed us the next day.",
        "A: How are they going to pay for the food? And tha -- you know, once we moved into the\nSACRA, it\u2019s there that we applied and eventually got charity. And I remember the people\ncoming in, looking over to see --",
        "A: To make sure there was nothing to sell. And then we got this one hot meal a day, which was\nbig pot of stew.",
        "A: Well, they brought it in a cart, and then they --",
        "A: Ladled it out. And we had a pot they ladled it in --",
        "A: -- and then my parents tried to give us as much meat as possible.",
        "A: Yes. And one was some sort of kasha or whatever that was.",
        "A: We need to drink a lot, we drank hot water.",
        "A: Because when we went to work, my brother and I went to work, and our mother took -- made\nsome sandwich for us, but we couldn\u2019t take anything to drink with us, and whatever we drank\nhad to be boiled. So we had to see that it 1s boiled, and then we drank hot water. Hot water and\nsort of dry bread was our lunch.",
        "A: My parents kept it for the evening, and then reheat it.",
        "A: No, it was a while before he --",
        "A: -- got that.",
        "A: Oh yes, and my father was still practice once in awhile, and then everybody had to leave that\none room that we lived in when he had a patient in there.",
        "A: Other times when it wasn\u2019t such a personal examination, I assisted him in some things. We\nhad like a little balc -- not a balcony, like a walk around the room outside where we fired up the,\nwhat we called the Chinese oven, which was a hibach -- hibachi. Over here when we do the\nhibachi it\u2019s a lot of fun, over there, that was the way to go. Had to buy charcoal to do it, and\nwhen charcoal became too expensive, we bought powdered coal, which we mixed with water,\nand made into little coal balls to heat up. Our hands were black as --",
        "A: -- oh, it was terrible. And there was one woman in -- w-we were quite a few people in this\nbuilding, couldn\u2019t tell you the quantity. The one woman worked in a restaurant. She used to\ncome home and bring the coffee grounds from the restaurant. Anybody has a fire going, you can\n-- they can share with me a cup of coffee. So my mother had -- loved coffee, she missed coffee\nmore than anything else. So she had the fire going and drank the coffee when it was going\nthrough the grounds a second time. And it\u2019s -- and there also were -- we got bombed out. In 19 --",
        "A: That\u2019s later, okay --",
        "A: We\u2019re talking about food, and -- we\u2019re talking about the communal kitchen stuff that came in.",
        "A: When my father got the job in the clinic, his mood began to change.",
        "A: His mood began to change, and made all the difference in the world then. And I remember,\nyou know, you couldn\u2019t deal in American currency on -- on open market, but Chinese currency\nhad no value. So when we finally were able to come to a point where we could buy some\nAmerican dollars, 1t was a big point because that was a turning point. This month we actually\nmade more than we spent.",
        "A: It was [indecipherable] we were able to buy some dollars on the black market, and that\u2019s what\nwe put aside.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: Some Polish also.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know ho -- the Polish -- w-we -- they were in there, but it\u2019s primarily the German and\nAustrian refugees.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: We know that they are being put into concentration camps.",
        "A: My grandmother, my mother\u2019s mother was still in Breslau. She was up in age when we were\ngetting ready to leave, and my aunt, who was quite wealthy, had paid in an old age home for the\nrest of her life, so she didn\u2019t have to worry about money. My mother asked her to come with us\nto Shanghai, she said, \u201cLook, you guys going to have a hard time in Shanghai, why should I be\nalong? Who would do anything to a -- an old woman like me. I\u2019m taken care of over here.\u201d So\nwe corresponded with my grandmother all the time we were there, and one time a letter comes\nback, moved, address unknown. And we knew that meant concentration camp. And I recall\nseeing my mother in tears when she got that.",
        "A: When we got that notification. Now, what concentration camp meant, that it was death camps,\nwe were unaware of. As it turned out, my grandmother was taken to Theresienstadt, and from\nwhat we understand, she died there.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think anybody knew this.",
        "A: Well we had radios.",
        "A: But the radios didn\u2019t announce it.",
        "A: The Russian radio had a German program on it. See, Russia was not at war with Japan.",
        "A: So the Russians were free, and the Russians reported very accurately what went on on the\nEuropean frontier. Now, we heard, you know, about the landing in Normandy and all that, almost\nat the same time as you would have heard over here. But we didn\u2019t hear anything about the\nJapanese war.",
        "A: And one time we -- it came through about Okinawa and we looked on a map and we saw\nwhere Okinawa was, and we said to ourselves, God, that isn\u2019t so far away from us any more.\nAnd then shortly after that, that bombing off Shanghai began. So once a island like Okinawa,\ncomparatively close to the Chinese mainland, was captured, planes flew from there, and did their\nmissions from there.",
        "A: But most of the bombing of Shanghai occurred in the outskirts.",
        "A: Of the death camps? I don\u2019t believe they did.",
        "A: Until after the war.",
        "A: May.",
        "A: February 18\" -- May 18\".",
        "A: Well, we were worried. I mean, the Japanese were in control there, and Germans were their\nbuddy buddies.",
        "A: We had no idea what was going on in Germany, but we realized this is an imprisonment of\nsorts.",
        "A: And only of sorts, because usually when you are a prisoner, they feed you.",
        "A: Here we had to feed ourselves.",
        "A: And, you know, primarily, the first thing is trying to find the place to live.",
        "A: I mean, just imagine yourself at -- you decide to move and you have 90 days to do it. So it --\nit\u2019s not easy to find a place under the best of circumstances, and here, all of a sudden, all these\npeople trying to move in. Many people switched homes with the Chinese. They took their fancy\nhouse, something like as nice as this one and traded it for a hovel.",
        "A: You mean among the refugees?",
        "A: Very well is exaggerating it a bit.",
        "A: They did well. They made more money than they spent. That\u2019s considered doing well. There\nwere some -- there was one family from Liegnitz, one -- a couple actually, they didn\u2019t have any\nchildren. They came with their parents. And his father was not Jewish, so he didn\u2019t have to move\ninto the ghetto. The younger couple got a little place in the ghetto, but they were all\nwatchmakers. His father employed him, and he was able to work with his father and live outside\nthe ghetto.",
        "A: They did work quite well. This Mr. Schwartz who lived next door to us, he the one that made\nthe shirt for me, he had a store across the street, and he seemed to do all right. And a lot of the\npeople who were handymen, plumbers, electricians, what have you, they did fairly well.",
        "A: Well, we all had a little bit of money s -- coming from somewhere.",
        "A: I mean, you had to have a plumber, you needed a plumber.",
        "A: I am not sure how these things --",
        "A: -- all came together again. You couldn\u2019t see that.",
        "A: Well the room in the SACRA was of course, the SACRA organization.",
        "A: It stood for something.",
        "A: Shanghai soma -- something or another. Prior to that, a Chinese ow-owned the house.",
        "A: And the --",
        "A: On East Seward Road.",
        "A: And he had a sh-shop downstairs and rented out the upstairs. And once the war was over, and\nwe moved back a block away on East Seward Road, the same thing occurred. Somebody had a s-\nstore downstairs and rented out the upstairs.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Yeah, we did.",
        "A: We did have --",
        "A: Throughout, that\u2019s one thing we insisted on, WC in the --",
        "A: -- meaning water closet, yes.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t too unusual, but it wasn\u2019t unusual not to have it. But we had it, we did not\nhave to have an outhouse.",
        "A: Nope, we didn\u2019t have to have a honey bucket.",
        "A: Thank God.",
        "A: I would imagine so.",
        "A: Well, but, you know, when we walked to work, or walked to school --",
        "A: -- we would see these Chinese people cleaning out their honey buckets --",
        "A: -- in the middle of the street.",
        "A: They du -- come in one of these carts, they would dump it in, and then they would take it out\nin the field and use it as fertilizer.",
        "A: That\u2019s another reason why you had such --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Awful smells, especially -- yeah. Not in the French Concession, yeah, the fancy residential\narea, but in the Hongkew area, it stank. I mean literally, it was terrible. And the people on the\nboats, they threw their waste into the water.",
        "A: Now that\u2019s the same water that then came out of your faucet.",
        "A: Yeah, boil it.",
        "A: Well, they well -- that did go through some cleansing pro --",
        "A: -- process before it got there, but the bacteria of course, all came straight through.",
        "A: And sometimes people thought that certain filters would help it or -- they tried it and they --",
        "A: It didn\u2019t. And we got all kinds of illnesses. Typhoid, typhus.",
        "A: Oh yeah. My parents got sick, I got very sick.",
        "A: I had [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- war was actually over.",
        "A: My brother got sick --",
        "A: -- he had got sick --",
        "A: Bacterial dysentery in there at one point. But wa -- I -- I had either typhus or typhoid, I never\ncan keep it straight, whatever comes from lice.",
        "A: My father had some bacterial disease, my mother had something else. Everybody got sick all\nthe time.",
        "A: Sick, and over it. Some things were not so serious as others.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But -- yeah, I -- yeah.",
        "A: Well, the -- yeah, bo -- my father didn\u2019t start working until --",
        "A: -- some time after that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: She di -- she did -- she continued doing --",
        "A: -- something. I mean, we didn -- we didn\u2019t have the lunchroom any more.",
        "A: That stopped when we moved away from rue Ratard. I think she still did some of the sewing.",
        "A: No, you know, that was not the case.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure at this point how the money that we needed to have came about.",
        "A: Mostly it came about from selling things. My father\u2019s microscope, my mother\u2019s fur coat, and\nthis, that, the other.",
        "A: [indecipherable] more and more.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I looked forward to it, you know.",
        "A: You get out of school, you get to work, I can do someth -- accomplish something.",
        "A: I loved school, and I --",
        "A: -- I basically loved work, but I was an apprentice, I didn\u2019t like it when they had me cleaning\nup.",
        "A: I wanted to get onto the machinery, learn how to use the machinery.",
        "A: The Korean who owned the company, he didn\u2019t want to see me on the machinery, he wanted\nme to clean here, clean there.",
        "A: This department where we made all the small parts was sort of a showplace for him.",
        "A: And he often brought his customers in to see --",
        "A: -- what we were doing. And I loved making money. There -- after awhile -- I mean, first we\ngot paid a salary, but then we got on piecework, where for every screw you got so and so many\ncents, or whatever it was.",
        "A: And I loved that, I loved being able to contribute, and making the money. An --",
        "A: A -- but you know, I was still 14 - 15 years of age, of --",
        "A: 19 -- 18 - 19 years old --",
        "A: -- and trying to protect me from everything, I mean, when they told some stories that he\nthought I was too young to hear, I -- you know, go fetch a glass of water kind of thing, which I\nresented, I th-thought I was big enough to hear -- hear all this.",
        "A: But we also had shelters, bomb shelters in the back of the -- of the factory. However, when\nthe bombing started we went on the roof of this factory and watched the American bombs --\nbombers bomb the outskirts of the city. I remember the first time we saw the B29\u2019s flying over\nour head. They were flying so high that the Japanese anti-aircraft couldn\u2019t reach them. So we\nwere there just looking up at them.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Where they had it all, I don\u2019t know. But the school that we -- the SACRA built into this\nbuilding, the other half was a radio station.",
        "A: A Japanese radio station that gave some ja -- radio signals to the military. And there was a -- a\ngasoline place, storage place not far away. And there were other things, there was an admiral of\nsome sort not living too far.",
        "A: So when on July 17\", 1945, a blanket of bombs was placed over that whole area. They were\nobviously not very large bombs, not like these big bombs that they used to destroy a lot of things,\nbut there were about three or four bombs that fell into our building. And quite a few people got\nkilled right then and there. I was home, I didn\u2019t go to work because I had a cold, flu or whatever,\nnothing serious, but I was in bed. As I said before, we didn\u2019t have any basement, there was no\nplace to go anyhow when the bombs fell and they were usually [indecipherable] on the outside.\nAll of a sudden I heard this big noise and I see the ceiling falling down on me like that. And I\nwent like this. There was a bookcase over my book, and one foot fell above my head, and one\nbelow my feet, and the whole ceiling and everything fell on top of that, so I hardly had a scratch.\nBut I came very close.",
        "A: It was bookcase, you know, a bookshelf with two legs.",
        "A: Or a leg on each side.",
        "A: On either side of the bookshelf, that was over the bed.",
        "A: And one part of that shelf fell above my head --",
        "A: -- one below my feet. And it protected me from the ceiling and everything else that came\ndown.",
        "A: My parents were just outside the door where I guess there was a stronger part of the building -",
        "A: -- and they were not hurt, they were okay. But my mother was scared for me, couldn\u2019t open\nthe door because of the air pressure. And then when they finally opened the door and called for\nme, and they said I didn\u2019t answer right away, because all they saw was the ceiling stuff all over.",
        "A: And my brother was at work, and -- I guess we have to stop.\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: My parents were outside --",
        "A: -- and the building there, it was a brick building and a fairly sturdy building, so where they\nstood wer -- did not come down, the ceiling did not come down. And my mother at first thought\nthat there\u2019s somebody lying in front of our door that she couldn\u2019t open it, because the air\npressure was so strong from the bombs falling. But finally she was able to open it, and after a\nfew seconds, actually, I guess, I was able to yell I\u2019m here, and push stuff away from me and\njumped out into their arms. No sooner was that done than a call came from my father to help here\nand help there because there were -- a lot of people were wounded, and quite few had died. But\nmy brother was at work, and somebody was telling him at the wor -- and he decided to come\nhome when he realized where the bombing had occurred. So he started running home, it was a\ngood 45 minute walk. And on the way he met people, he said -- he asked, what about the\nSACRA building, and people just, oh, everybody got killed in the SACRA building. It was not til\nhe was about a block or two away that he met somebody who knew us, and he said, don\u2019t worry,\nyour -- your family is fine. Now, I still had a temperature from the flu or whatever I had, so I was\nlying outside on a rug, trying to stay calm. And my mother was with me when he came. We\ncouldn't find my father, he was being called from one end to the other. And then they said, well\nwe all have to move into this school. And my mother said, I don\u2019t want to move into the school\nwith all these people. So we cleaned up our room a little bit --",
        "A: -- and stayed there for the first night. You could see the stars coming through the ceiling. And\nduring the night a fire broke up somewhere in this complex, was actually two buildings. Well,\nthe next morning we all decided we better move into the school. So we grabbed -- each one\ngrabbed a mattress and walked those three blocks to the school. The classrooms were made\nempty, and you put one mattress next to the other, man, woman, child. And that\u2019s where we\nstayed. But neither Henry nor I decided to go back to work. We refused to go back to work.",
        "A: We were too scared. And this was July 17\". Shortly afterwards the war was over. The way we\nfound out the war was over, on August 10\" is my mother\u2019s birthday. We woke up in the\nmorning, we heard bombs falling. My father said, here\u2019s some -- they\u2019re saluting you to your\nbirthday. And then at night, wi -- what was always black out, all of a sudden the lights went on.\nThere\u2019s Mrs. Hartwich, the principal in her nightgown. I just heard over the shortwave that the\nJapanese have asked for surrender. The war is over. And everybody got out, went into the\nauditorium, somebody jumped at the piano, and started playing music. And my father led the\nconga line.",
        "A: Dancing through there. Next morning people started tearing down the signs of the ghetto\n[indecipherable] district, and the Japanese arrested them. Oh, everybody said the whole thing\nwas just a rumor, nothing true. But two or three days later, I think it was on the 14\", a plane,\nAmerican plane flew real low, dropping leaflets that the war is over, but the Japanese will have\ncontrol, police control over the city until the Americans can come in. And then the emperor held\nhis speech telling Japan and the whole world that the war is over.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Obviously I couldn\u2019t understand what he is saying, you know.",
        "A: But we heard this, and then somebody was translating it. And then, just a few days after that,\nthe first Americans came in, they came into the school. It was nice to see them, and after that, all\nright, we now have to go back to work someplace, so --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: In this same period. I mean, it came over the newspapers.",
        "A: Not what we fully understood what an atom bomb was.",
        "A: But we heard about the destruction of Nagasaki and Hiroshima.",
        "A: And na -- to begin with, we were worried if -- what would happen if they start dropping a\nbomb on Shanghai.",
        "A: But this happened so rapidly from one day to the next.",
        "A: But it was nice. It was a good -- good time.",
        "A: It was a good time that -- then I don\u2019t know where my brother first went to work, but he -- as\nsoon as the American troops came in, he got a job at the airport, and I got a job at another\nmachine shop, which was quite filthy.",
        "A: Filthy place. And I didn\u2019t like working there, but then I got sick, and this is where I got -- I\ngot sick and said to my mom, look at my bites, I had some bites on me, turned out to be typhoid\nor typhus. I think it\u2019s typhoid.",
        "A: And I'd -- sent to the hospital, and I was in the hospital for about three weeks. We --",
        "A: No, the refugee hospital.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- he was working at the clinic.",
        "A: But this was a hospital that they had going all along --",
        "A: -- it was 1n one of the homes.",
        "A: Heime --",
        "A: Heime. [indecipherable] the Heime, I think 1t was a [indecipherable] time, but then again, I\ncan\u2019t be a hundred percent sure. And you know, I was in the room with about a dozen other\npeople. I had had my shots for typhus, typhoid, cholera, all along, so I didn\u2019t get this illness as\nbad as it could be. There was another kid about my age in the room, he didn\u2019t have as many\nshots, and he was delirious for days. He eventually had recovered, and I eventually recovered.\nBut there were people in this room who died while I was in there. People used to say, Ernie, turn\naround. And I could hear people actually passing on. In the meantime, Mr. Lorenz, who was my\nforeman in the other factory, he had a been a student at the Zeiss factory in Germany. He decided\nto open up a camera repair place. He met my parents on the street, he said, \u201cDo you think Ernie\nwould like to continue his apprenticeship with me?\u201d Well, when I heard that -- course, he didn\u2019t\ncall me Ernie, everybody called me Ernst at the time. When I heard that, it helped my recovery\nmore than anything else. And soon as I was well enough, I started working with him.",
        "A: Yes, he was my foreman --",
        "A: -- in the --",
        "A: -- in the Korean factory. Oh yes, he was very nice person.",
        "A: Well, cameras or not, it\u2019s the small pieces, the small --",
        "A: -- mechanical --",
        "A: -- which they used to call fern Mechaniker in German, fine mechanic. And just recently my\nson, who is into genealogy, found a listing of the people coming over to the United States on a\nship from Shanghai including our name, and next to my name -- profession, it said mechanic. He\nsaid, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a mechanic.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, that was fine mechanic,\u201d --",
        "A: -- that it referred to. But I continued my apprenticeship with him by getting into cameras.",
        "A: And here, 60 years later --",
        "A: -- Pm still at it.",
        "A: No, that was before that, I believe.",
        "A: And -- sometime before that that he had this serious illness.",
        "A: In different places. He worked for -- he worked for the American military, which I also\nwanted to do because it sounded neat.",
        "A: But then I got sick and started working for Mr. Lorenz.",
        "A: Well, once the American occupation came in, of course we could go move wherever we\nwanted to.",
        "A: And we found an apartment on East Seward Road again --",
        "A: -- but a block away from where we were before, basically the same area. And that\u2019s where we\nmoved into, and stayed until the --",
        "A: Two rooms instead of one.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Still with a WC, definitely a WC.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah, everybody had to boil their water, definitely.",
        "A: I couldn't answer that --",
        "A: -- you know, because we had no social contact with them at all.",
        "A: From the Japanese, or --",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "A: No, no. I mean the -- no, I mean the people in charge knew who we were.",
        "A: You know, the plain G.I.s, and sailors, they could care less.",
        "A: Tremendous amount of help. First of all, packages were sent to us of clothing and food, and\nsome of the food we didn\u2019t quite know what to do with, what it 1s.",
        "A: Farina. We didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t know what Farina was, my mother finally figured it out.",
        "A: But we loved the hard salami.",
        "A: You know, that was easy to ship, but didn\u2019t spoil.",
        "A: That was just great. We loved the canned fruits, you know, canned cherries and so on. The\ncherries we split evenly, one for you, one for me. Chocolate and everything else, I mean, we just\nloved everything coming in. My parents quickly began to get their weight back.",
        "A: Then -- now they could --",
        "A: -- eat more [indecipherable]",
        "A: And my father still worked for the clinic, my brother worked for the Americans so he made a\nhalfway decent salary.",
        "A: For Lorenz and although my salary wasn\u2019t great, 1t was great compared to what many other\nkids were doing.",
        "A: I was making 20 American dollars a month, I mean, that was a lot of money.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: Well, we got paid -- we calculated everything in American money.",
        "A: But your everyday purchases still was in Chinese money.",
        "A: But the Chinese money changed again. And of course, the inflation was rampant.",
        "A: You just couldn\u2019t go by it.",
        "A: There was no real destruction, even in the Hongkew area, other than that one point on July\n17th",
        "A: -- there wasn\u2019t much. The airport got destroyed, the -- some of the piers, some got destroyed,\nbut there was no rampant destruction like you see in what happened in London or in --",
        "A: -- Germany in World War II.",
        "A: Yeah, January \u00b047.",
        "A: Yes. The papers were fairly accurate in what they told us about that.",
        "A: Well, the horror, 1t got overshadowed by what we heard from Germany.",
        "A: I mean, the paper started running an article about Treblinka, one of the destructive camps.\nThen we saw newsreels and -- when we went to movies, of what occurred.",
        "A: Of the camps. And then the realization, these aren\u2019t strangers, these are our relatives.",
        "A: It\u2019s my uncles, my aunts, my --",
        "A: -- grandmother --",
        "A: -- these are all in there. That realization was very, very hard to accept.",
        "A: Free, on the --",
        "A: -- on the other hand, I mean, it took a long time to absorb this.",
        "A: I mean, to this day, none of us can fully comprehend that.",
        "A: Sometimes read some of these books of -- which have a graphic description, I mean it -- can\u2019t\neven -- you have to put it down --",
        "A: -- put it away.",
        "A: And what -- when we read about things happening in another country, it\u2019s bad enough, but\nwhen you begin to realize these are my people, these are my relatives, that\u2019s -- that was hard to\naccept. An --",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: I mean, they was much closer.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s three siblings all had gotten out, only her grandmother had stayed behind. My\nfather had four siblings and only one had gotten out.",
        "A: And the one brother that he was so close with, that he was trying to talk into coming to\nShanghai --",
        "A: -- didn\u2019t get out.",
        "A: He had three children. One went to England, one went to first Holland -- Denmark, then\nSweden and eventually is -- Israel or Palestine. But the third one, the youngest one, stayed with\nthem.",
        "A: And -- but the one that went to England, I fou -- eventually made contact with and we got\ntogether. It\u2019s horrible to realize what went through there. And that overshadowed a lot of the\nother things.",
        "A: And then the next step was to make contact with the people that were alive. My mother\u2019s\nsister was in Panama, her brother was in Baltimore. Her other sister was in Haifa. My father\u2019s\nsister was in Montreal. So we contacted all of them, and we decided whatever comes first, that\u2019s\nwhere we go.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t care where.",
        "A: Well, it turned out that the United States came through f-fast. And on Christmas eve,\nDecember 24\", 1946, we got our visa to come to the United States. And of course once you had\nthe visa, now you had to figure out how to get here. The Joint and other Jewish organizations\ntook care of that. Was shipped -- usually troop ships, which were filled. The first --",
        "A: American troops, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: But the -- you know, they tried to arrange it so that husbands went to wives first, parents to\nchildren, children to parents. And we were the first group after that.",
        "A: And we were told we\u2019d have a ship leaving first week of February. I get a call at work, Ernie,\ncome on home, we\u2019re leaving in a few days. What happened, the ship in February would not take\nany women because there were still G.I.s on the boat. So they said, \u201cWell, you and your sons can\ngo, but your wife would have to come on the next ship.\u201d And he -- father wouldn\u2019t hear of that.\nSaid, \u201cWe\u2019ve stuck together this far, we\u2019re not going to split up now.\u201d Is there nothing else we\ncan do? This was on January the fifth. The guy said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a ship leaving on the ninth of\nJanuary, there is still some room.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d But we have to have your heavy stuff\nby day after tomorrow. Okay. So --",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have that [indecipherable] had stuff we had to get rid of, you know, like the sewing\nmachine I mentioned earlier, and got rid of some of the things. But we were aboard that ship on\nJanuary ninth, and 13 days later we were in San Francisco.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We loved -- we couldn\u2019t wait to get out.",
        "A: Our stay in Shanghai, I mean, even though it wasn\u2019t that tough for me as a child, was very\ntough for my parents, my brother, and of course it filtered down to me.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, that -- you know, that was just a year, so getting out --",
        "A: -- and starting a -- a new life was all we could hope for.",
        "A: Very happy to get out. Very happy.",
        "A: Yes, we had some close friends.",
        "A: They moved different places. One went to Australia, and I remember him, dimly. We\ncorresponded for awhile.",
        "A: And then it stopped. There was -- we actually had a little club that we formed after the war,\nmet in the school, called Tikvah, and made some close friends with them, and one of them came\nto Washington, and I got to know her -- reunite with them --",
        "A: -- after we got here. I went to one reunion where I met -- re-met many of these people from\nthe Tikvah club. But it wasn't hard to leave. I think it -- yeah, this group from Liegnitz, we all got\ntogether the night before --",
        "A: -- had dinner together. And --",
        "A: That original group.",
        "A: The Brauns, the Ritters --",
        "A: Mr. Salinger.",
        "A: And we said goodbye to each other because we all went in different directions. We came to\nBaltimore, Brauns went to London, Ritters went to ta -- Palestine, and Salinger went back to\nGermany.",
        "A: To his wife.",
        "A: And my parents corresponded with them for a fairly long time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, in fact, we always celebrated Passover together.",
        "A: Mr. Braun was the one who conducted the service.",
        "A: I was always the youngest in all my life, to say the four questions.",
        "A: Manishtana. And he used to practice, and I had to come over his house to help -- to do my\npart, and to practice.",
        "A: So I would do it well.",
        "A: But e-even in Germany, my mother\u2019s family, where we used to have Seder together with her\nfamily, I was always the youngest of all the cousins.",
        "A: Then in this group I was the youngest. So I was always the youngest.",
        "A: But s-say that by heart in Hebrew to this day to a great extent. But it must have been very\nhard for my parents to say goodbye to them --",
        "A: -- because we spent so much --",
        "A: -- time together.",
        "A: Decision to go to Shanghai, to live together.",
        "A: To do that lunchroom together.",
        "A: And even afterwards we stayed very close. And --",
        "A: In most cases, yes.",
        "A: In many cases better and some cases not so good. And by that, the racial discrimination.",
        "A: I thought that this business with the blacks being different from the whites went out with the\nCivil War. And of course, especially in Maryland and Baltimore, that was not the case.",
        "A: There was still a lot of discrimination in 1947 and \u201948. When we came here, of course, the\nfirst thing, you had to find a job. We had a little bit of money that we had brought with us, but\nnot very much. And so looking for a job was the first thing, and we had relatives here, mother\u2019s\nbrother and his family. They found out that Henry was a mechanic, and -- not an automobile\nmechanic, but a machinist, I should say.",
        "A: So they got him a job in Bethlehem Steel, which was not to his liking because that was quite a\ndistance from where we lived, and it reminded him like being shoved off to Allensbach in\nShanghai. When he -- my cousin heard that I was a camera repairman, he took me into Ritz\ncamera center, and they hired me, and I was with Ritz for about 10 years. So I had a job a week\nafter we got here, my brother had a job a week after we got here.",
        "A: My brother.",
        "A: At Bethlehem Steel. And my father went to the Jewish Community Center and talking to\nthose people he says, I\u2019ll be a Fuller Brush man, whatever you can find me. And he was told, no,\nwa -- I\u2019ll find you something better, and a few months later found him a job in a hospital. In\nMaryland you could work as a physician in a hospital without having to take all the tests.",
        "A: But this was a sa -- a sanitar1um for colored people. So he was in a place called Henryton,\nworking his profession, very happy living there. My mother decided to live in Baltimore to take\ncare of Henry and I. They got together on -- on weekends. And -- but this is some more of this\ndiscrimination that I was talking about, these doctors, African-American doctors used to tell my\nfather, when you go into downtown Baltimore, you can go into any restaurant --",
        "A: -- drugstore, have thi -- something to eat, or to drink, we can\u2019t do that. Theaters, some you can\ngo to, some you can\u2019t. And that -- that surprised me, that was one of the things that surprised me.\nBut other than that, it was just great.",
        "A: Much easier --",
        "A: -- much easier.",
        "A: And we became assimilated as fast as we could. We wanted to be as American as --",
        "A: -- and the next guy.",
        "A: 21.",
        "A: No, no. You know, I -- I made friends very quickly, and some of the people I made friends\nwith I\u2019m still friends with today.\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Regular attending physician --",
        "A: -- it was a TB hospital. There were quite a few little children there, and he loved little\nchildren, got some pictures at home, him and the little children.",
        "A: On weekends.",
        "A: Henry -- Henry got a -- a -- the idea was, when Henry was so unhappy with working in -- at\nBethlehem Steel, my father said to him, as soon as I have a job, you can quit there and find\nsomething else.",
        "A: And he did. He found a position as a salesman for a paper company selling wrapping paper\nand all that kind of stuff to retail stores, hos -- hospitals --",
        "A: -- hotels, etcetera. And for that, of course, he needed a car, so we bought him a car, and with\nthat car we --",
        "A: Back and forth.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And my mother stayed there sometimes for days, but she wanted to take care of Henry and I,\nso she stayed in Baltimore with us.",
        "A: Well, the ap -- the apartment in the -- in Henryton, he didn\u2019t have to pay for it, that was --",
        "A: -- that was given to him as part of his pay.",
        "A: My mother could have stayed there too, with him.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Yes. It -- my mother became very upset about that, because when we came into California,\nwhen we landed in San Francisco, friends of my parents from Germany, who were living in San\nFrancisco, were there welcoming us. And the Joint gave us a hotel room where we could spend a\nlittle bit of time with them. These were two brothers, they were not married, two brothers who, in\nLiegnitz had department stores, something, but they came to San Francisco and lived there. And\nsaid, \u201cWhy do you go to Baltimore? Everybody from the east is coming west.\u201d My mother said,\n\u201cWell, all these years, with all that went on, I want to get back and at least be with my brother.\u201d\nSo we came to Baltimore, we settled down a little bit, and they tell us that they are planning to\nmove to San Francisco. My mother was furious. You could have told us that ahead of time, we\nwould have stayed in San Francisco, the -- I forgot what their name was -- told us to just stay\nthere. Anyhow, they decided to go there, first their son, and then they. And my uncle couldn\u2019t\nfind a job. So after awhile they came back to Baltimore. In the meantime we had really settled\ndown extremely rapidly. I had a nice job, maybe it wasn\u2019t paying a fortune, but more than\nminimum wage. Henry eventually had the job with this paper company, he stayed with them for\nover 40 years until he retired.",
        "A: And we made friends. My parents made friends with other refugee people that lived there. I\njoined a fraternity, it had nothing to do with a college, it was like a club, and as I said, I\u2019m still\nfriends with these people today. A few years ago we had our 50 year reunion.",
        "A: Just the three couples, one young -- one man moved onto New York and is now in upstate\nNew York, and we call each other on the phone every once in awhile, once in awhile we see each\nother. So it was a very deep friendship that developed there. My brother also became friends with\nquite a few people, he had now a decent job, nine t -- nine to five, so to speak, rather than all\nhours of the day and night that they had in Bethlehem Steel. He had a car so he could get around.\nBegan to teach me how to drive, which was --",
        "A: -- it was good to a point. Eventually I went to a driving school, and --",
        "A: Well, would -- he was so nervous because he had no controls, you know what I -- driving\nschool the guy has all the controls there.",
        "A: And that -- so we had no intentions of leaving Baltimore to go to San Francisco.",
        "A: No. That\u2019s my problem, I didn\u2019t want to go to school. I liked -- I liked making money.",
        "A: I liked work, I liked making money. But people said to us -- used to say to us, in America you\ndon\u2019t need schooling. They don\u2019t care about your schooling, it\u2019s what you know that counts,\nwhat you can do that counts. Well, that\u2019s not true. And eventually somebody said to my father,\nlook, your boys don\u2019t even have a high school diploma. You need to see to it that they get some\nschooling. So Henry and I went to night school, Baltimore City College, which although it has\nthe name college in it, is really a high school. We went to night school, and sent our report cards\nfrom Shanghai to a department of education here in Washington. That eventually came back, and\nthey just went by our age into which grade we should go. So in the meantime, what should we\ntake, we -- English, of course, American history and some other subjects. We took tests in\nGerman for both German one and for German two, which we passed with about a 90 degree\nsetting. And then we heard about the ga -- high school equivalent tests.",
        "A: And we both took that and passed that.",
        "A: So we have our high school degree. Recently I happened to come across a report card of that.\nI had 99 plus in mathematics, so mathematics was my field. But we didn\u2019t go on to college.",
        "A: Henry did go.",
        "A: He went to -- he went to Baltimore City College and took a two year course there. I was not\neager at the time, which --",
        "A: -- and I had no encouragement from my parents. In the meantime, my pa -- father had passed\naway, and my mother depended on Henry and I --",
        "A: -- to keep her going.",
        "A: My father had a goiter from when he was a young man.",
        "A: During World War I is when he first noticed it. And it was in the army at the time, German\narmy. But this is 1914 - 1918 --",
        "A: He had had a friend who had a goiter removed and he became a vegetable afterwards.",
        "A: My father said, I don\u2019t need that, this is just a beauty spot. People either like me or don\u2019t like\nme with it --",
        "A: -- and just kept that. However, that put a tremendous strain on his heart, pos -- probably had\nsome effect on his heart attacks.",
        "A: It was growing internally --",
        "A: -- yeah, always. And it put a pressure on his heart.",
        "A: So after we\u2019re here for awhile, we have to meet some of the doctors here, they said, look, why\ndon\u2019t you have it taken care of now? We have Johns Hopkins Hospital here --",
        "A: -- one of the best hospitals in the world. He said, \u201cBut what about my heart?\u201d I mean, now\nafter the initial heart attack in Germany, he had had another heart attack in Shanghai.",
        "A: Not as severe, but it was a heart attack. They said, well, let\u2019s take you under observation and\nthen see how your heart will hold up for an operation. So he did that, went into Hopkins, and we\nwent to visit him one Sunday in December, and while we were there the doctor comes in. We\u2019ve\nchecked your heart, you\u2019ve been under observation, your heart is fine, you\u2019Il be able to do it.\nWe\u2019 ve scheduled the operation for tomorrow, next day.",
        "A: Well, he ex -- my father excused himself after a few minutes, he had to go to the bathroom,\ndidn\u2019t come back. All of a sudden we hear, Dr. So and So, Dr. So and So, calling him. My father\nhad had a heart attack. They wheeled him back into the room, they chased us out, and that\u2019s ho --\nwhen he died.",
        "A: His heart just wasn\u2019t able to take this, or whatever. Completely -- I -- I for one never expected\nhim to die. That really got to me.",
        "A: And my mother now depended completely on my brother and I to take care of her. No\nencouragement to me to go to school, so I didn\u2019t. Two years later, 1951, I got drafted.",
        "A: And that -- after I come out of the army, instead of taking advantage of the G.I. bill, I went\nright back to work. My own fault, I should have gone to college. It would have been paid for\nunder the G.I. bill. But with no encouragement, 1n just the other way, you know, you got to go\nback to work so you can support me, I went back to work.",
        "A: My brother.",
        "A: And I.",
        "A: I sent back half of my pay, I mean, I got 80 dollars a month as a private, sent 40 bo -- dollars\nback home.",
        "A: While the other guys got money from home, I sent it back. And my brother was just above the\nage to be drafted, and the age was at 26, and --",
        "A: -- so he just escaped being drafted.",
        "A: And I didn\u2019t, and you know, so once I got home -- my brother got married while I was in the\nservice, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. I knew her. And this -- also from -- she\u2019s actually from Vienna. And they took an\napartment just a few doors away from my mother\u2019s house, or mother\u2019s apartment, didn\u2019t have a\nhouse, and my mother used to cook dinner for them. So they came over her house for dinner, and\nthen went home. But then I came home, and I moved in with my mother and stayed there, and\nthis is still in Baltimore. In the meantime I went back to Ritz camera centers, and they told me --\nEddie Ritz, a very fine man, you know, they had to send repairs out while you were gone, so now\nhow about -- we think you\u2019d be better salesman than a repairman. So I went into sales, worked\nmy way up to assistant manager. And one day I got a call from Eddie Ritz out of Washington, we\njust bought this place called Brenner photo, how would you like to be manager of the store here\nin Washington? And that\u2019s how I ended up in Washington.",
        "A: But instead of moving to Washington, my mother put it very bluntly, well, if you move to\nWashington, you\u2019d have to pay for two apartments. So I commuted for about a year.",
        "A: By train.",
        "A: And then, after awhile I left Ritz cameras and then went for another comp -- with another\ncompany called Industrial Photo in Silver Spring, but there was no good train connection to\nSilver Spring --",
        "A: -- and I commuted by car. And couldn\u2019t wait to get out of my mother\u2019s house, so first chance\nI had, found a girlfriend, we decided to get married and move to Washington.",
        "A: Now [indecipherable |",
        "A: I still supported my mother.",
        "A: Oh. To some degree, yes. Retroactively I resent a lot of what happened. This business of\nmaking us support her, not letting us have a life of our own. I got married and when this young\nlady and I talked about marriage, I said, \u201cBut, you know, you\u2019ve got to realize, I\u2019ve got to send\nsome money to my mother every month, every week.\u201d And it was tough --",
        "A: -- on our weddin -- on our marriage. Eventually she got some money out of Germany, a small\npension.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when it made it a little easier on us. But I moved to Washington and visited my\nmother very frequently, but even that was not frequently enough. So there was quite a bit of\nresentment that built up in me.",
        "A: She had made lots of friends among the German Jews.",
        "A: Well, you know, she wanted that, she wanted our financial support.",
        "A: And made no strong effort to learn the language or to find a job. And it was very difficult to\nbuild up a family life of our own, with that.",
        "A: My first wife, yeah.",
        "A: We had -- we had three children.",
        "A: One of whom unfortunately be -- died a few years ago.",
        "A: But they all got to know my grandmother -- my -- their grandmother, my mother.",
        "A: Although the youngest probably hardly remembered her.",
        "A: The two -- one lives 1n Philadelphia, just outside of Philadelphia.",
        "A: One is now here in northern Virginia.",
        "A: But she is married to a man in the diplomatic service, so every once in awhile they are --",
        "A: -- in other places, which is usually fine, we have a place to visit.",
        "A: They\u2019ve been in Lisbon, I visited them in Lisbon, I\u2019ve -- we visited them in Moscow.",
        "A: So it\u2019s very nice, and they have a little boy. My son has two sons, one of whom is getting\nready to go to college this fall.",
        "A: And my son-in-law never remarried after my daughter died, but has a little -- a little daughter,\na young daughter.",
        "A: She is now in high school, so they\u2019re not little any more. And --",
        "A: My daughter had an illness that came about, well it was in her all her life. I can\u2019t think of the\nname right now, but it was a illness of the connecting tic -- tissue. Ehlers -- Ehlers-something\nsyndrome. She one day developed a sore on her leg which wouldn\u2019t heal, they had to decide to\namputate the leg. And then it a-attacked other parts of her body. And it\u2019s something I can\u2019t get\nover.",
        "A: I mean, you expect your parents to die before you.",
        "A: You sometimes expect your mate to pass away, but you don\u2019t expect the children to die\nbefore you. It\u2019s -- that\u2019s the tough part.",
        "A: No, late -- later on. When did I divorce? About 15 years ago -- no, 18 years ago, cause it was\njust before my oldest grandson was born.",
        "A: We divorced, there were many reasons for it, and once the children were out of the house, it\nbecame more obvious that we don\u2019t fit together.",
        "A: And it was a -- about as friendly a divorce as you can have, I guess. One day we just looked at\neach other and said, do we really want to continue our lives like that, and we decided no. So first\nI suggested she find a place to live, and then I would sell the house and I\u2019d find a place to live,\nfiguring it\u2019s easier for a man to find an apartment than a woman. And she started to look around,\nshe said, \u201cWhy would you want to sell this house, I mean, it\u2019s something valuable that we have.\u201d\nI said, \u201cWell the house is too big for one person to live in.\u201d Said, \u201cWell if you don\u2019t want it, then\nI want it.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s fine, you know, I\u2019ll find a place to live,\u201d and I moved out. And\nyou know, financial arrangements that we made between us hit some hard times, but not bad, not\nreally bad.",
        "A: And she eventually remarried, and a few years later I met somebody and remarried.",
        "A: And a good friend of mine asked me [indecipherable] how is marriage a second time around?\nI said, \u201cWell, if it\u2019s that much better the second time around, I can\u2019t wait for the third time\naround.\u201d",
        "A: It\u2019s a very nice relationship, we do a lot of things together, we travel a lot. We bo -- she\u2019s also\ndivorced, so we learned from our mistakes the first time.",
        "A: And any divorce, it\u2019s not one person\u2019s fault --",
        "A: -- it\u2019s always two people who are not necessarily at fault, things just don\u2019t work out right.\nThere are many, many parts that --",
        "A: -- play a part in this.",
        "A: I think I am aware of it.",
        "A: My life -- I mean, I look at what my life would have been like 1f Nazism wouldn\u2019t have come\nto Germany.",
        "A: I would have gone to college, I would have become a doctor or lawyer --",
        "A: -- some professional.",
        "A: I would have had a great life, you know, I would not have had to worry about supporting my\nparents, they would have supported me. Probably would have gone into a profession where I\ncould make -- I\u2019ve made a decent living, and -- instead of what I ended up with. I mean, I didn\u2019t\ndo bad. Considering what I went through, I did very well.",
        "A: I -- enjoyed most of it.",
        "A: And -- but I find -- I -- you know, I get together with people my age or even younger, and\nthey talk about their college life, which I\u2019d never experienced. I never experienced living by\nmyself until I divorced.",
        "A: Because I went from my mother\u2019s house, got married --",
        "A: -- into married life. The three years between my separation from my wife, and before I met\nAnya, I enjoyed those, because I was on my own.",
        "A: I was able to take care of myself, I didn\u2019t starve.",
        "A: Figured out how to cook, more or less, and I missed out on that part of my youth. I never had\na teenage life, or a young adult life. So yes, I missed that. I decided a couple of times to go back\nto take college courses, but didn\u2019t really follow through on it. I did all right in my profession. I\neventually, after I left Ritz Camera Center, went with a company called Industrial Photo, and\nbecame their general manager and vice president, and did fairly well for myself. But it\u2019s not the\nsame as what I could have been, or would have been.",
        "A: [inaudible] you know, I can hold my own with other people, I --",
        "A: -- have enough education of -- by reading and studying on my own. But certain things I just\nmissed out on. You know, it -- like one time I tried to -- I considered opening up my own camera\nstore, but then I became scared. I am not a big risk taker, I\u2019d rather let other people take the risk\nand I work for them, but that doesn\u2019t get you very far.",
        "A: Uh-huh, I guess.",
        "A: It was not my choice.",
        "A: It was a very high risk situation, I mean, we escaped Germany --",
        "A: -- barely escaped Germany. In Shanghai I got bombed out, I mean I easily could have been\nkilled there.",
        "A: And to think about what would have happened if we wouldn\u2019t have left Germany --",
        "A: -- is really un -- I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here.",
        "A: Really be unthinkable.",
        "A: To realize what happened to my cousin, my uncles, my aunts, can\u2019t -- I can\u2019t dwell on that too\nlong, it\u2019s too horrible. You read some books and you wonder how one human being could do that\nto another.",
        "A: And yet, it\u2019s still happening today. Not necessarily against the Jews, but human beings can be\nvery cruel.",
        "A: No, not at all.",
        "A: No, it has -- I think the last straw was my daughter\u2019s death.",
        "A: Lalways say if -- there can\u2019t be a God who can let six million people die, with one million of\nchildren, and then I say it\u2019s really six million and one.",
        "A: So, I\u2019m really an atheist in -- as far as my belief is concerned. I\u2019m a cultural Jew, and ethnic\nJew, but not religious.",
        "A: Well, thank you for asking me, I feel privileged.",
        "A: Thank you.\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: This is actually a shot of the Main Street of Liegnitz. Legnica 1s called now. At one point in\nShanghai, somebody came across this as a picture postcard and gave it to my mother when they\nsaw that it was town we were born in -- I was born in. And you see the streetcar on its single\ntrack down the street, and those two domes in the back, I don\u2019t remember the name of the\nchurch, but was the center part of Liegnitz, and it -- the main shopping center. This must have\nbeen taken sometime in the early 30\u2019s.",
        "A: These are my mother\u2019s parents. Their last name was Lewy, pronounced Levy in German. His\nname is Isadore and her name is Rosa. And my grandfather had a little goatee, looks a little bit\nlike Lenin. He -- what I remember about him is as a child he fell out of a tree, and they had to\namputate one of his fingers. And when we went for walks, it always felt funny when that one\nfinger was missing. He passed away in 1936, of a normal death, I forgot -- I have no idea what it\nwas. But my grandmother lived on and then eventually ended up in Theresienstadt.",
        "A: These are my father\u2019s parents. I never met them. They died during World War I. I am not sure\nwhat they died of, it might have been from that flu epidemic that went all around the world at\nthat time. But these pictures must have been taken before the 20\" century started. I have the\noriginals in the frame in my bedroom. And well I\u2019m -- as I say, I don\u2019t know too much about\nthem.",
        "A: Emil is his name, and now you got me, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I -- Hanne, I believe. I think it\u2019s Hanne, well don\u2019t quote me on this one.",
        "A: This is my father, his name was August, and -- on his motorcycle. He didn\u2019t have the\nmotorcycle any more by the time I was born. He and my mother cruised on the motorcycle all\nthrough Germany, and eventually they bought a car. And then when I came along, a bigger car.\nSo the story goes that my brother asked once, why didn\u2019t you buy a bus in the first place? But he\nloved gadgets like this, and people recognized when the doctor was visiting someplace by the\nmotorcycle.",
        "A: Well, it is probably in the 20\u2019s, the mid- 20\u2019s, because Henry was born in 1925.",
        "A: So it would have been before that.",
        "A: This is my whole family, my father, obviously doing quite well, not on a diet at that point. My\nmother, Betty, that\u2019s me on her lap, and my brother Henry on the other side. This was taken\nwhen Henry and I had whooping cough, and we were out in the country someplace, and my\nfather went to town to his practice, and then came ho -- back in the evening, and one day he\ncame back with a brand new car.",
        "A: This is my nursery school. The lady in the back is Miss Schroeder, who was the owner\n[indecipherable] of the school, and I\u2019m the little guy right in front of her. I have no idea of any of\nthe names of the others, but this is Miss Schroeder, who had to kick me out cause one of the\nother kid\u2019s parents didn\u2019t like a Jewish boy in there.",
        "A: With flowers, to my mother, to tell me about it.",
        "A: This was my first day of school. In Germany it was common practice that on your first day of\nschool you got a cone filled with candy. That\u2019s my brother, putting his hand on my shoulder for\nsupport. But I obviously enjoyed the candy afterwards.",
        "A: This is my first year of school, my first grade class. I\u2019m in the front in the center. They -- right\nthere. And my teacher Mr. Thiel is in the background there.",
        "A: That\u2019s him right there. Basically had a pretty good time in school there. And I reconnected\nwith Mr. Thiel when I was in the military after World War -- after -- no, during the Korean War.",
        "A: Well, this is me in my liederhosen. And it\u2019s hard to tell who is more proud, my father of me,\nor me of my father. But I believe this was taken in the mountains not too far from where we used\nto live.",
        "A: My guess is about seven.",
        "A: Yes, approximately.",
        "A: \u00b036 approximately. It\u2019s --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if in the album I even have the dates on there.",
        "A: This is probably on the second year in Shanghai. Both my brother Henry and I joined the\nBritish Boy Scout association. He as a scout, and I as a Wolf Cub. Here we call them Cub\nScouts.",
        "A: It was referred to as Wolf Cub. This was actually taken across the street from where we used\nto live.",
        "A: Here we see what is left of the SACRA building after the bombing on July 17\", 1945. You\ncan see the bomb holes on top, and there\u2019s a little gate in that wall that we used to enter in. The\nbuilding has been razed, and there\u2019s another apartment building in its place now.",
        "A: Well it -- if you can imagine a school, where you have a walkway all around --",

        "A: -- of this, but several bombs fell onto the building, and substantial destruction.",
        "A: This was taken 1n the school building when we were living there, after the bombardment. And\nthey came by with these big bins of food, and doled out enough food for every family. We used\nto stand in line with our pots, waiting for them to show up, but eventually we kids just let the\npots stand there, and we played on the playground until they came by. And th -- each one got a\nlittle bit of food. That what we lived on.",
        "A: This is back in -- being a Boy Scout. The war is over, and during the war we often met, but\ndidn\u2019t dress up in uniform, always had to be back home before 10 o\u2019clock when curfew came\nabout. And now we started to take some trips around Shanghai. That\u2019s me right there.",
