        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Alfred Munzer, t -- conducted by Gail Schwartz on\nAugust 4\", 2002 in Washington, D.C.. This is tape number one, side A. What is\nyour full name?",
        "Answer: My full name is Alfred Munzer and that\u2019s spelled M-u-n-z-e-r. The name\nhas undergone some changes, so when I was born it was actually Minzer, M-i-n-z-\ne-r, because of a slight spelling error that had been made in my father\u2019s birth\ncertificate. Someone forgot the upstroke on the -- on the U actually, which had a\nlittle umlaut on it. And officially also, when we came to the United States the name\nwas changed back to Munzer, M-u-e-n-z-e-r. So we have all three spellings, but\ncommonly I use M-u-n-z-e-r.",
        "Q: Do you have a middle name?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have a middle name.",
        "Q: And where were you born and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in The Hague, in the Netherlands, November 23\", 1941.",
        "Q: And your parents\u2019 names and where they were from?",
        "A: My father\u2019s name was Simcha or Siegfried Munzer, or Minzer. And he was\nborn in a town in Galicia called Kanczuga. And he was born in 1904. My mother\nAugust 4, 2002\nwas born in a town in the same general area, called Rymanow, and she was born\nMay 20\", we th -- 1905 officially, but it could have been, it probably was more\nlikely 1907.",
        "Q: And when did they come to the nether -- Netherlands, and what brought them to\nthat location?",
        "A: My father came to the Netherlands in the late 20\u2019s, and my mother came to the\nNetherlands in 1932. And my father came there to -- to start a -- a business,\nobviously. Conditions for Jews in Poland were not ideal. He came from a large\nfamily of tailors and he decided to start his own tailoring business in The Hague.\nAnd then my mother joined him there about four years later. She was also -- they\nwere actually cousins, so they shared the same last name. And she initially left\nRymanow in the impr -- the end of the 20\u2019s probably, maybe beginning 30\u2019s and\nwent to Berlin to join a sister and a brother who were -- already lived in Berlin.\nAnd she worked in their tailoring business, and then came to join my father, and\nthey were married in the Netherlands in 1930 --",
        "Q: Two.",
        "A: -- Two. 1932.",
        "Q: December 16\", 1932.",
        "A: Right, December 16\", 1932.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: And then when did they begin a family?",
        "A: They -- I had -- they had two children before I was born. My oldest sister Eva\nwas born in 1936, and my younger sister Leana was born in 1938 and then I\nfollowed in 1941.",
        "Q: Were your parents very religious, do you know?",
        "A: They both came from very re-religious backgrounds, very typical eastern\nEuropean, but they were also part of the -- the enlightenment, if you will, and so\nthey -- they experimented, when they came to Holland. And some of their closest\nfriends in Holland were actually not Jewish. They -- they observed, you know, the\nJewish holidays, certainly, but they -- they did make a break with the very rigid, and\nwhat they considered, I think, constraining and confining religion of their bankr --\nbackground in Poland.",
        "Q: All right. Now obviously I know what you\u2019re telling me is what your mother told\nyou, cause you haven\u2019t been born yet. How much education did they have?",
        "A: I\u2019m not entirely sure, my -- they -- they both, I think, had a high school\neducation, essentially. Neither one of them went to the university. And to a large\nextent also were self educated. My mother read a tremendous amount, was a\nvoracious reader throughout her life. And my father was also a fairly educated man,\napparently very interested in world affairs.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Was there an extended family in the Netherlands?",
        "A: In the Netherlands there was -- my father had a brother by the name of Emil,\nEmil Munzer. And I think that that\u2019s -- that\u2019s really an -- all we had in Holland.\nThere were some close friends. There was another Emil, an Emil Landau who I\nsubsequently met because he happened -- he lived in the United States and you\nknow, he happened to -- to marry, actually, someone who became a part of our life\nmuch, much later on. And so we became very close friends with him. But he was\nvery close with -- with both my father and with my Uncle Emil.",
        "Q: But -- but he was not a blood relative?",
        "A: My uncle --",
        "Q: No, no, Emil Landau.",
        "A: Emil Landau was not a blood bra -- blood relative. The only blood relatives that\nI know of in Holland was my Uncle Emil, my father\u2019s side. All of the others were\neither -- either remained in Poland or Czechoslovakia, whatever. The location of --\nof the towns actually was changed quite frequently throughout history. And the\n[indecipherable] some of them were in Berlin.",
        "Q: And on your mother\u2019s side there was no rela -- there were no relatives?",
        "A: On my mother\u2019s side, as far as I know, there were no relatives in Holland.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: And wh-what do you know of the conditions in Holland before you were born?\nDid your mother tell you about any tightening restrictions or any sense of danger?",
        "A: Certainly the -- you know, she did tell me about the -- the -- the -- the gradual\ntightening of the screws after the invasion of Holland by the Germans.",
        "Q: Which was May 1940.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, May 1940 and the confiscation of -- of Jewish property, the banning\nof Jews from -- from various positions in the arts, or in -- in -- 1n business. Just a\nvery -- I think actually the first thing that happened was the banning of shechitah,\nritual slaughter and then just things got tighter and tighter. And I think they try --\nmy -- my perception is that they really tried to go on with their lives as -- as\nnormally as possible in Holland, and I\u2019m not sure how directly threatened they felt\nin Holland, actually. My feeling is that for a long time they somehow felt safe. As\nfar as I know, my father never made any attempt to -- to emigrate, for example, to\nthe United States or anywhere else. I think they -- they -- they really felt very\nsecure in Holland.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then your mother became pregnant with you.",
        "A: Certainly by the time my mother became pregnant with me, conditions in\nHolland had really deteriorated a great deal. By then the -- the occupation was in\nfull swing, and this was an unplanned pregnancy. And my mother was advised in\nAugust 4, 2002\nvery strong terms by her obstetrician to have an abortion. He told her that it would\nbe immoral to -- to bring another Jewish child into the world. And my mother, this\nis one of the times when she did turn to the Bible, and she read the story of\nHannah, who desperately wanted to have a child, and it was in reading that story,\nmy mother told me, that she decided that she could not possibly have an abortion.\nAs aresult of that, her obstetrician refa -- refused to have anything further to do\nwith her, and so I was -- I was born not in a hospital, but I was born at home\nactually, with th -- with the help of -- of a nurse, rather than attended by an\nobstetrician. And I was born actually one month prematurely, November, as I said,\nNovember 23\", 1941. And this led to another dilemma at the time, actually, and\nthat\u2019s whether to have a -- a bris or a circumcision. Again my -- my parents friends\nadvised very strongly against it because that would identify me as being Jewish and\nthen the pediatrician who examined me after my birth came out and told my father\nthat I -- that I would need a circumcision, that there was a medical need for it, and\nmy father at that point of course made the decision that we would have a regular\nbris. And I have some wonderful photographs of -- of that bris. They\u2019re very\nremarkable photographs, they\u2019re very, very tiny, they\u2019re only about one by one and\na half inch in size, but my mother was to keep them hidden on her body for the year\n-- subsequent years when she was in the concentration camps.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: So you were born, you were circumcised and then the next development?",
        "A: Well the next development, I -- I was born, as I said, in November, and by the\nfollowing May ts -- is when it became apparent that the family would have to go\ninto hiding. That\u2019s when Jews began -- were deported openly in Holland and the --\nthe first person who was actually called up by the -- by the Germans was my father,\nto -- to go to a so-called work camp. What he initially did was he -- he scheduled a\nhernia operation, which he had postponed previously, went into the hospital, had the\noperation and that delayed his -- his going to the concentration camps for awhile.\nAnd then the next thing that happened was that he had a mock suicide attempt,\nwhich gained him admission, like many other Jews apparently, to a psychiatric ho-\nhospital near The Hague, called The Remarkkliniek. And that\u2019s -- so he entered\nthere, basically under the pretext of being a patient. My mother, in the meantime,\nbegan to look for hiding places for my sisters and for myself. The f -- my father --\nmy parents decided that we should not go be hidden together, but that we should --\nshould hide in -- in different places, so that if -- if one person were killed or found\nout, at least someone would survive, one person in the family would survive or the\nothers would survive. My sisters were placed -- we have very close friends among\nour neighbors. The Van Luhrmann sisters, they were two sisters, Jo, J-o and Ko,\nK-o were their first names, Jo and Ko Van Luhrmann. They were very, very close\nAugust 4, 2002\nto us, very religious Catholic and they were instrumental in several things. First\nthey -- they had my sisters -- facilitated the enrollment of my sisters in a Catholic\nschool, and that was sort of the first attempt, really, at hiding their identity. And\nthen through their church in The Hague, a church which I have visited since then,\non the street called Alonstraat, and through the intervention also of two priests, a\nfather by the name of -- one father was Schulling, S-c-h-u-I-l-i-n-g, and I right now\ncan\u2019t remember the name of the other one, but anyway, these two priests were\ninstrumental in finding a Catholic family that was willing to take my sisters. The\nwoman in that family was also very religious, very devout Catholic. She had had a\nvision telling her -- where the Virgin Mary told her to take in Jewish children. And\nth-that\u2019s what led to my sisters being placed with this woman. Subsequently, my\nmother asked a neighbor across the way from us, where we lived, to -- to take me\nin. And th-the plan, apparently was for me to place -- be placed with her, and then\neventually to be transferred to a safer place somewhere in the Dutch countryside,\nwhere most Jewish children apparently were hidden.",
        "Q: What -- where -- what -- what was the address of your family\u2019s house? Wa --\nyou\u2019re talking about neighbors --",
        "A: Sure. It was 100 Zoutmanstraat in The Hague, and I don\u2019t recall exactly, but\nthey lived on the same street, on Zoutmanstraat, right across the street, actually.\nAugust 4, 2002\nHer name was Annie Madna and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the woman I was -- I was placed\nwith.",
        "Q: And your family knew her because she was a neighbor.",
        "A: They were very -- they were close neighbors. She was divorced from her\nhusband, Tol\u00e9 Madna, who was of Indonesian background. She herself was Dutch.\nAnd they had had -- they had tw -- three children, and the three children really were\napparently in and out of my mother\u2019s house all the time. It was a very, very close\nrelationship. They also played with my two sisters and knew them very well. So it\nwas -- it was a logical thing for me, you know, to be placed with her initially,\ncertainly. That probably was in September 1941, because I -- I think I was nine\nmonths old at the time when I was placed with Annie. And at that point my mother\nsold most of our furniture and belongings and placed a lot of 1tems 1n hiding with\nour neighbors, basically emptied the house and she too, she joined my father in -- in\nhiding at the same psychiatric clinic, the Remarkkliniek and -- but sh -- in her\ncase, she worked there as an attendant, as a nurse\u2019s aid, basically.",
        "Q: Was she known as his -- his wife?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not sure. I really don\u2019t know. There were quite a few Jews\nwho were hiding there in the same way, although I never asked my munther -- my\nmother exactly how many people. She did tell me about the shock it was to her to --\nAugust 4, 2002\nto -- to be in a -- inas -- ina hospital where people had been confined -- and\npsychiatric hospitals at that time were quite different from the clinics we are\naccustomed to. So these people had been confined for -- for much of their lives and\nit was a tremendous shock for her. My father apparently adapted much better and he\nfound a little clique of -- of Jewish men who were in hiding and they played cards.\nBut for my mother it was -- it was much more difficult.",
        "Q: Did she have contact with him?",
        "A: She did have contact with him. As a matter of fact, for Christmas day 1942, the -\n- in Holland Christmas is celebrated for two days, but the -- on Christmas day, the -\n- my two sisters were brought to the Remarkkliniek to visit my parents. I\u2019m not\nsure whether that was actually Christmas day, it may have been in -- and I have\nsome notes somewhere -- it may have been the feast of Santa Claus, which 1s also a\nbig deal in Holland, which is the sixth of December, but I think this was actually f-\nfor -- for Christmas day. Yeah, it was Christmas day. And they -- so that that part of\nthe family at least, was reunited that -- one last time. This was December 25\", 1942.\nThe following day the clinic was invaded by the Germans and apparently was\nemptied not only of all the Jews who were hiding there, but also of all the patients\nand the entire staff, they were all taken prisoner. And my parents were taken, first to\na -- a temporary prison in The Hague, the former home of the philosopher, Dutch\nAugust 4, 2002\nphilosopher Spinoza had been converted into a prison. And then, just within a\nmatter of days really, early in January they were transferred to the first\nconcentration camp, and that was Westerbork. Westerbork, which is located in\nthe northernmost part of -- of Holland. Westerbork, my mother told me, initially\nhad been built actually as a receiving center for Jewish refugees fleeing eastern\nEurope.",
        "Q: And -- and so they were together in Westerbork for how long?",
        "A: They remained in Westerbork, I believe for sev -- for -- for several weeks, not a\nvery long period of time. My mother was put in charge of the nursery there, of\ntaking care of -- of young children, and it gave her, she said, a sense of security that\n-- that her own children were not there. She was really quite glad of that, actually\nand very grateful that -- that there ha -- was -- that we had found sa -- that she had\nfound safe refuge for all three children.",
        "Q: Once she was in Westerbork, was there any contact with -- where y -- where\nyou all were placed?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think -- there was no contact. And I -- I think at that\npoint every attempt was made probably, to keep things as secret as possible, so she\ndid not disclose. There was some contact later on, and I can mention that now, is\nactually my mother, on -- on her way subsequently to -- to Auschwitz, wrote a little\nAugust 4, 2002\nnote on a piece of -- of toilet paper which said, en route to Auschwitz, all is well.\nAnd she dropped that on the railroad tracks and she put an address on it, not -- I --\nprobably to my mother\u2019s neighbors, not to where my sisters were or I was. And a\nrailroad worker in Holland found the note and it did make its way back. I\u2019ve never\nseen the note, I\u2019m not sure whether my mother saved it or not, but there 1s a very\nsimilar note in the museum in Amsterdam. So I -- I assume that this was really s-\nsomething that was done fairly commonly. But in any event, from Westerbork, my\n-- my parents were deported to the next concentration camp, which was Vught. And\nVught is -- is a -- is a camp located in northern hol -- northwestern Holland --\nnortheastern Holland, sorry, not far from the city of Eindhoven, and it was home to\nthe Philips factory. And both my parents were put to work in the Philips factory.\nAnd at that time they still had contact with each other; although they were separated\nin the camp, th-they saw each other and still had contact.",
        "Q: Did your mother talk about her state of mind at that time or your father\u2019s state of\nmind?",
        "A: Just an extreme hope for peace. One of the things that my mother told me that,\nyou know, they had these -- these morning line-ups, and -- in the camp, in Vught.\nAnd at one point actually they were -- they were visited there by -- by Himmler\nhimself, who told them that as long as they worked, they were in no danger, nothing\nAugust 4, 2002\nwould ever happen to them. [indecipherable] Whether it\u2019s at that same line-up or\none of the others, I mean, very humiliating experiences. She saw a little church way\nin the distance in the du -- Dutch church on the horizon, and she wondered how --\nhow wonderful, how it would be if peace would break out at that moment. And she\nsaid she would just run to that church, she didn\u2019t care if 1t was a church or a\nsynagogue and just thank God for -- for being freed. So she did maintain hope. I\nthink that\u2019s -- that\u2019s really what kept my mother going then, and -- and\nsubsequently. She never lost hope. She -- she always tried to -- to -- to really make\nthe best of -- of the situation.",
        "Q: And she would have been in her what, mid to late 30\u2019s by then.",
        "A: She was in her -- in her 30\u2019s at that time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: One of the things which -- which happened really a bit later was -- but which\nsort of says something about her state of mind I think, is when she was in one of the\ncattle, the infamous cattle cars. She -- she looked outside, she was able t-to -- to\nlook at the -- the countryside, the German countryside and -- and realize -- this was\nspringtime and she realized how beautiful it was and she -- she said to herself that\nafter the war we probably would not have much money, but that this still was one\nway that the family could actually go around and see Europe and still admire the\nAugust 4, 2002\nbeauty of -- of creation. So that\u2019s -- I think that says something about her state of\nmind. This was much later, when things were much worse for her. Much worse than\nthey were when she was at -- in Vught.",
        "Q: And did she talk about what your father\u2019s state of mind was, there at the factory?",
        "A: Not at that time, but she -- she did tell me about my father\u2019s state of mind\nactually, earlier. He kept hoping that the Germans would be defeated by the\nRussians. He had -- he had great faith in th-the -- in history and what happened\nduring the Napoleonic wars, and he -- he felt that when -- when Russia entered the\nwar, he -- he felt it was a strong possibility that the Germans would be defeated in\nRussia and that that will be the end of the war. But that, of course, was not to be for\na long time.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And then how long did they stay at this factory?",
        "A: \u2019'm not entirely sure. I do have some documents that I could refer to, okay?",
        "Q: Well, why don\u2019t you continue with the story and we can talk about the\ndocuments later.",
        "A: Right. I think -- good. They -- they stayed in Vught for sev -- as far as I know,\nseveral months and then were transferred from, or tra -- deported from Vught to\nAuschwitz. That\u2019s where my mother wrote that fame -- that note, which she\nAugust 4, 2002\ndropped on the railroad track. They were still together on arrival in Auschwitz, and\nwere both selected for work -- to -- to work in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: What did she say about that journey with your father in the cattle car?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were in th -- in the cattle car together. They just -- I -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think so. I think men and women were separated, but I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m not sure of that. But -- and I d -- I don\u2019t know of any specific conversations\nwhat they had. She did, on arrival in Auschwitz they -- they -- they both, I think,\nwere very much aware of -- of what the realities of Auschwitz were, there was no --\nno hiding it. You know, she -- she told me of Torah scrolls that were on the floors.\nShe told me of Tallisium that had been com -- made into curtains and sh-she\nrealized that things in Auschwitz were going to be very, very, very bad. My mother\nsomehow found a way to make herself indispensable in -- in many different ways.\nThe first kind of job that she had actually, was making fur coats for the wives of --\nof German generals. My mother had never done any kind of tailoring, any kind of\nwork before, hard work, let alone working with fur, but somehow she managed to\npersuade them that she was able to -- to work with fur. And so she made some --\nsome fur coats. That was her -- her first job. And then through the grapevine is how\nshe learned that people working in electronics were very essential to the work\neffort, and that led to a different kind of work, first in Auschwitz, but then to a\nAugust 4, 2002\ntransfer to Reichenbach, which was home of the Telefunken factory, and there she\nwas put to work assembling radio tubes essential for the war effort and for\ntransmission.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer. This is tape number one, side\nB. You were talking about your mother\u2019s experience in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes, my mother found work in Auschwitz, made herself indispensable first by\nmaking fur coats, and then she learned through the grapevine that people who\nworked in electronics were saved, actually had a way of saving themselves. And so\nshe started doing that, she claimed that she knew how to -- how to work in\nelectronics, and she was -- that led to a transfer to the Telefunken factory in\nReichenbach, sort of a continuation, if you will, of what she had been doing at\nPhilips in -- in -- in Vught. And in Reichenbach she -- she worked assembling\nradio tubes. Her state of mind at that point actually improved, or she took heart\nfrom the fact that there were not only Jewish and other -- other inmates of the\nconcentration camps working at Telefunken, but there were also German soldiers\nwho had been injured on the Russian front, many of whom were missing limbs and\nAugust 4, 2002\nwere put to work basically, as best they could in the factory. And their state of\nmind, they were so anti-Hitler, and anti-Himmler that they would do everything to\n-- to sabotage the effort at that point. And she took tremendous heart from that, and\ntold me of her own sabotage efforts basically, you know, she would spend the\nwhole day assembling the radio tube, and then when the alarm sounded, or the siren\nsounds at the end of the day, she would take the -- the entire radio tube apart and\nput it back in the drawer and then the following day would start the process again,\nwhich 1s kind of a daring thing, certainly. But by that time, things like that were\nquite common.",
        "Q: What did she say a-about leaving your father in Auschwitz?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t talk about that specifically. I -- not that I recall.",
        "Q: Did she have contact with him when they were there together?",
        "A: In Auschwitz they still had contact together, but that was the end. It was in\nAuschwitz really that they were separated. I did not realize that until much later,\nbut my father actually remained in Auschwitz, amazingly for -- for over a year,\nbefore being transferred to another hellhole, Mauthausen, another work camp,\ndeath camp. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to distinguish the two suddenly -- certainly. And then he\nwas transferred from Mauthausen after being there for several months, to several\nother, smaller subsidiaries of Mauthausen; Gusen, Steyr and then finally ended up\nAugust 4, 2002\nin a camp called Ebensee. My mother and I for many years thought that he worked\nin salt mines. I don\u2019t know where we got that idea from, but there were salt mines in\n-- in that area, that part of Austria, actually. And it\u2019s called the Salzkammergut.\nAnd -- but the-these were actually abandoned salt mines that were used for\nassembling of V-2 rockets. And that\u2019s where my father di -- where my father\nworked to the end of the war. And he -- he remained there through the liberation,\nsurvived the liberation by the Americans, and -- but was much too weak, contracted\n-- well, what we was told was tuberculosis and died still in Ebensee and still\nwithout having been able to establish contact with us, two months after the war, on\nJuly 25\", 1945. He -- he died in a -- ac -- a convent in Ebensee that had been\nconverted into a hospital for concentration camp victims who were very ill. My\npartner Joel and I visited the -- the convent, actually, and spoke to one of the sisters\nabout her experience there, and she -- she had -- she was much too young, I think, to\nhave been there, actually. But she said that -- that literally there were hundreds of\ninmates who were being cared for, and that people were just also dying on a daily\nbasis. And my father was buried actually, in -- in a cemetery in the former\nconcentration camp of Ebensee. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s an absolutely beautiful place. It is 1m --\nun -- it\u2019s unimaginable that -- that horrors like that could have taken place. It -- it\u2019s -\n- | think it\u2019s one of the most beautiful places on earth.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Is that a marked grave?",
        "A: Well, his grave originally was marked, and there are some -- some mass graves\nthere, because of the tremendous number of people who died immediately after --\nthey were found dead in the concentration camp. And then there were a lot of\nmarked graves, but for the sake of -- of uniformity, basically -- initially actually his\n-- his -- the first time my mother visited the cemetery in 1952, there was actually a\ncross on -- on his grave, that we didn\u2019t know -- there were Jewish graves that did\nnot have crosses, that had, you know, just plain markers. We didn't know why there\nwas across on his grave. And we didn\u2019t know whether in -- somehow in his last\ndays he had converted, or whatever, what had happened. But we were told at the t --\nor she was told at the time that all the markers would be removed because there\nwere far too many errors like that. And also because many of the people were\nunidentified, and so all markers were removed, but we do know exactly where he is\nburied.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And to get back to your mother\u2019s experience?",
        "A: My mother eventually -- Reichenbach was bombed by the allies and the factory\nwas destroyed and again showing my mother\u2019s attitude at the time and her\ncontinued hope that kept her going was she said the Shechianu prayer, as she saw\nthe flames engulfing the factory. She said that was one of the greatest joys that she\nAugust 4, 2002\nhad, was seeing that factory going up in flames. And then after that she was put on -\n- on one of these many death marches that were occurring and she was just\ntransferred from one camp after another, in very, very desperate conditions. She\ntold me that she stuffed newspapers around her -- her -- her feet to keep them warm,\nbasically. And sh -- barely -- she barely had -- had shoes. Just absolutely desperate\nconditions. She did become ill along the way, developed a diarrheal disease, and --\nbut somehow managed to survive.",
        "Q: How did she continue to carry the photographs with her, do you know?",
        "A: My mother told me that the photographs were hidden in her hair, and she told me\nthat her hair -- I asked her whether her hair was ever cut or shaven like -- like most\nwomen in Auschwitz, but she said it was not. I don\u2019t whether that was just -- she\nwas just being discreet with me, but she -- but she claims -- she told me that she had\nthem hidden in her hair. She had the feeling that if these two little photographs of\nmy -- my bris were ever lost, it would mean that I had died. And so she really, she\nheld onto those, and I still have those photographs.",
        "Q: Did she have a number on her arm?",
        "A: Yes, my mother did have a -- a number on her arm.",
        "Q: Do you know what it was?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I have it written down somewhere, but I -- I don\u2019t remember it offhand. It\u2019s --\nit\u2019s interesting, my mother never wanted me to photograph the number, and she --\nshe talked many times of having it removed, actually. She always kept it covered.\nShe was -- til the end of her life she would shop for dresses that had, you know,\nsleeves that just barely covered the number. She -- she did not want to show that\nnumber. Eventually my mother ended up at a -- a camp at the German-Danish\nborder, and that\u2019s where she eventually was -- was liberated. It was actually about a\nmonth or two before the end of the war. It turns out, and this -- this was really found\nout -- and my mother did tell me that she was liberated, came off a train, was in -- 1n\nterritory that was marked, Red Cross. And she was greeted by a Count Bernadotte\no-of Sweden. And I believe the Danish -- Swedish crown prince was with him. And\nshe was, it turned out, part of a large convoy of -- of women who had been kept\nhostage by Himmler to try to gain his own freedom, eventually, negotiate his own\nsafety after the war through -- wi-with -- with Count Folke Bernadotte. And also\nshe was fortunate enough to be -- to be saved as a result of that, and to be liberated.",
        "Q: What was the name of the last camp that she was in? Was it --",
        "A: [indecipherable|",
        "Q: -- was it Ravensbritick?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I think 1t was Ravensbriick. She did mention that camp. There were other --\nseveral small camps in the area that my mother was -- was with -- was in. And\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that was the last camp and then from -- from the train, she was\ntransferred. Now, she never mentioned the white buses, the famous white buses\nspecifically, but subsequently I\u2019ve seen photographs of those. I\u2019ve never been able\nto verify with her whether that\u2019s how she was transported, but she did tell me that\nshe crossed Denmark, which was then still occupied, and was taken in by a family\nin Sweden. The inmates were just -- were distributed to -- to different families in\nSweden who were willing to take in the prisoners and be part of the rehabilitation\nprocess, basically. And she remained in Sweden through the end of the war until\nAugust 1945, when she returned to Holland.",
        "Q: All right, well now let\u2019s -- that helps us get back to your story, which was that\nyou were then placed across the street with Annie Madna.",
        "A: We also need to --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We also need to talk about my sisters.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, I meant your -- your -- your story and your sister\u2019s story. Yeah,\nokay, so you\u2019re at Annie Madna\u2019s house and your sisters are with this Catholic\nfamily.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Right. I don\u2019t know exactly the name of the family that -- that my sisters were\nplaced with. Much, much later I found a book that -- that contained an\nadvertisement asking for the whereabouts of my sisters, and the name they were\ngiven was Jonson, the last name. And I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s the name of the\nfamily that they were hidden with or not, my mother didn\u2019t tell me. But in any\nevent, I-I was placed with -- with Annie Madna --",
        "Q: But before we get to that, who placed that advertisement?",
        "A: This was an advertisement placed in a Jewish newspaper in July 1945.",
        "Q: By whom?",
        "A: We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know who placed the advertisement. I gave a talk\nabout my family\u2019s experiences and someone in the audience worked at the Library\nof Congress, and the following day just happened to pick up a book that contained\nreprints from Jewish newspapers in Holland and there, in the middle of the page\nwas an adver -- was an advertisement a-asking about -- the whereabouts of my two\nsisters and where they had last been seen when they were deported.",
        "Q: But no n -- knowledge of who placed it?",
        "A: There was a -- the -- the name, actually was th -- was -- there was a name in\nthere in terms of contact and it was Van Luhrmann family. So I think that this was\nAugust 4, 2002\na different member of the same family, the Van Luhrmann family, because they\nwere not -- this was not The Hague address.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. All right, now let\u2019s get back to th -- yo-your story and their story.",
        "A: I was placed with Annie Madna and again with -- with the -- the -- with the goal\nof eventually going to the countryside. I remained with Annie for -- I don\u2019t know\nexactly how long, I think about two months altogether, because I -- I think I was\ntold that I was 11 months old when I finally arrived at the Tol\u00e9 Madna household.\nTol\u00e9 Madna was the ex-husband of Annie Madna. They had joint custody of their\nthree children, Vidy -- Willy, Davy and Robby. And so I was transferred to --\neventually to -- to her husband. Tol\u00e9 Madna had a housekeeper by the name of\nMima Saina, S-a-i-n-a. We don\u2019t even know what -- what -- what her real name\nwas, if that was her real name. She was an Indonesian woman who was really -- the\nIndonesian term was a babu, which was nursemaid. She took care of -- or nanny.\nAnd she took care of the children and also the entire household. She was a -- a\nyoung woman, probably in her 20\u2019s at the time and had no -- was not married and\nhad no children of her own, but she had taken care of -- especially o-of -- of Robby\nMadna when he was very young. And -- so it was completely natural for her to -- to\ntake me on as -- as -- and take care of me. And she really did not want to part with\nme, and apparently the other children in the household also liked the idea of having\nAugust 4, 2002\na baby in the household, and so I ended up remaining with the Madna family until\nthe return of my mother in August 1945. Obviously, since I was an infant I have,\nyou know, very few memories, direct memories just of -- of my stay with the\nMadna family, but I do have a few, actually. I -- I remember listening to Indonesian\nlullabies that Papa Madna, Mr. Tol\u00e9 Madna played on the piano.",
        "Q: Can you sing any of them now?",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t. My native tongue apparently was -- was Malay, or Indonesian, but\nI\u2019ve totally -- I\u2019ve just almost totally forgotten it, for two -- a few words, but I was\ntold that that\u2019s how I communicated with Mima, who did not speak any Dutch. She\nwas actually illiterate, couldn\u2019t read or write.",
        "Q: When you were gr -- not you, but when your family, in the 1930\u2019s and your\nsisters were talking to each other, it was in Dutch?",
        "A: Yes. My family, th-they all spoke Dutch, and my mother had learned Dutch.\nClose -- it\u2019s close enough to German that -- that she learned Dutch fairly quickly,\nthat\u2019s what my father spoke, and certainly, you know -- they tried everything really\nto -- to -- to become a part of the -- the Dutch community.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So they -- that -- that was their language, definitely.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Tell me about the Madna family, a little bit of their background and the\nneighborhood that the house was in.",
        "A: Sure. The house that I was hidden in was located -- was not -- van\nKinsbergenstraat, number 40. And it was a -- a -- a very modest house in -- not too\nfar from the -- the home of my parents and also my -- my parent\u2019s home was\nactually an apartment that was just a door away from where my mothe -- my\nfather\u2019s business was, his store was. And this was probably half a mile, or a mile\naway from-om where the store was, certainly within walking distance, was where\nthe van Kinsbergenstraat house was. It had a front room, sort of a middle room,\ntypical Dutch house and then a back room and then two little rooms at the very,\nvery end. And I slept in sort of an enclosed porch, as I remember. My father -- my\nfoster father, Papa Madna also had kept birds, that was his hobby. He had canaries.\nAnd that was one of the other sounds, besides the -- the -- the lullabies, the\nIndonesian lullaby, what I also remember was the sound of canaries. I\u2019ve\nsubsequently made a tape of that, actually, because it -- that\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that\nhe -- he stuck to through the end of his life, really. He had a tremendous love for his\nbirds. It was a very joyful household as I -- as I remember. I -- I do remember one\nspecific thing, which must have been when I was a little bit older, obviously. I came\nthere when I was less than a year old, my guess is when I was about two or three. I -\nAugust 4, 2002\n- I tried to copy the writing. I saw my -- the -- my foster -- my sisters, then sisters,\nWilly and Davy tri -- writing and so I scribbled on a piece of paper. And I\nremember that they were laughing and I was very unhappy about that. It\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s just\none of those memories that -- that has stuck with me. I -- I also remember some of\nthe f -- a little bit of the furniture. Here in the apartment I have -- I have some items\nactually that were in -- in the house. There was a big, Indonesian wayang doll,\nwhich is a puppet, which is now hanging in my foyer. And just to show, you know,\nthe dimensions of -- of -- perceived dimensions as a child, Papa Madna had a -- a\nlittle liquor cabinet that was shaped like a barrel, and to me it looked very big,\nactually and it wasn\u2019t until many, many years later, recently in fact, that I\nencountered that barrel again and realized that it was very tiny. And I -- I -- that\nbarrel is now in my apartment as well, I -- it -- 1t arrived here rece -- just a few\nweeks ago. And just -- just one other reminder of those days. I also remember some\nof the toys I had. I had a big yellow stuffed dog and then a little stuffed rabbit, also\nyellow. And I subsequently found out that that\u2019s where much of my mother\u2019s\njewelry was actually hidden, was sewn into -- to th -- my toy rabbit. I also, towards\nthe -- remember one particular time when I was hungry and the last winter of the\nwar in Holland was extremely bad, very rough, and there was really very, very little\nfood. And the only thing we had to eat at that time -- again something I found out\nAugust 4, 2002\nsubsequently, is tulip bulbs. And I remember waking up, or -- one night and feeling\nhungry and seeing the table set for the following morning. And so I just sat down at\nthe table, waiting to be fed, and I -- I -- I really distinctly remember falling asleep\nand my head falling into the plate. That\u2019s one very distinct memory. And then the --\nthe most definite memory I have is when my mother returned, when I was reunited\nwith my mother.",
        "Q: We'll -- we\u2019ll get to that in a little bit. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your experience\nbefore that. Did you go outside at all, or were you confined in a house?",
        "A: Oh no, I -- I was confined to the house and to the backyard, basically, and I do --\nmy view of the outside world was really through a mail slot. That\u2019s the only thing\nthat I saw.",
        "Q: So you never went out the front door?",
        "A: I never went out the front door, never went out to the street, but was allowed to\nplay in the backyard, and I have some photographs of me playing in the backyard.\nVery --",
        "Q: But you -- you could be seen in the backyard?",
        "A: Some of the neighbors were aware of the fact of my -- were aware of my\npresence. My -- Papa Madna told me that in fact he had made a -- concocted a story\nthat I was the illegitimate child of his ex-wife, who now had a new boyfriend who\nAugust 4, 2002\ndidn\u2019t want me around, and that\u2019s how I ended up in his household. Whether, you\nknow, he really used this story with the Germans or not, I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the\nstory he told me. The n -- our neighbors on va -- on van Kinsbergenstraat, I was\ntold were actually very anti-German, were communist and so they were of the\nwhere -- aware of the fact that I was there. Many members of the Indonesian\ncommunity who came to the house, I think also were aware of the fact that I was\nthere in the house and -- and in fact, many, many years later, when I would visit\nPapa Madna, we -- we -- we\u2019d go to a Indonesian grocer store and the grocer had\none look at the combination of Papa Madna and myself and immediately realized\nwho I was. And he called me by my then name, I had a name in hiding called -- I\nwas called Bobby, and that\u2019s what he called me, you know, Bobby. I -- I -- I\nthought for many years that I -- | was named after the dog, I had -- there was a dog\nin the family. And that the reason for that 1s so that people would think the dog was\nbeing called when I was being called, and -- as a -- as a disguise. That story turned\nout not to be true, because I found out that the dog\u2019s name was actually Teddy.",
        "Q: What was your relationship with the other children in the family that you were\ntold either later or that you remember?",
        "A: Well, to this day, I am still their younger sibling. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- you know, that --\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s very, very interesting actually, you know. For example, September 11\"\nAugust 4, 2002\nlast year, the first telephone call that I got to make sure I was safe was from one of\nthe siblings, was from Davy Madna. She -- she called me here several times, left\nmessages on the machine, was desperate to find out, to make sure that I was okay.\nAnd whenever -- and I\u2019ve maintained contact over the years and there is no question\nbut that when I\u2019m with them, I always feel the younger sibling. Mr. Madna\nsubsequently remarried and three more children and there is no question but that I\nfeel like the older sibling to the next three children. So I\u2019m really the bridge\nbetween them. In fact, the only time that they ever talk to each other is when I\u2019m\nthere.",
        "Q: When the two sets --",
        "A: The two sets of children.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And when you were talking about September 11\", that was 2001.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the elder Mr. Madna, what you know about his\nbackground.",
        "A: Mr. T-Tol\u00e9 Madna was born in Indonesia and came to Holland around -- he\nwas born in 1896 and came to Holland around the time of World War II -- World\nWar I, sorry. With either -- and I\u2019m not sure whether this was his mother or a foster\nmother, I\u2019m not sure, he was very, very mysterious about his background, never\nAugust 4, 2002\ntalked about it very much. Apparently he came from a family that was relatively\nwell-to-do, because he -- he -- after he arrived at Holland he was able to take piano\nlessons. He was very proud of the fact that he owned a motorcycle, and he -- he\nreally became a part of -- of the very -- the young Indonesian community that was\nbeing established in Holland. Indonesia, of course, was a Dutch colony at the time.\nAnd he -- he then married Annie Madna, further really integrating him really into -\n- into Dutch society. But he also, I think felt very proud of his -- of his Indonesian\nheritage. He -- there were paintings in the house that illustrated, really, life in the\nIndonesian villages. And he -- he enjoyed gardening in -- in the home, in van\nKinsbergenstraat actually, we kept chickens in the backyard, which he -- he really\ngreatly enjoyed. Many years later, when he moved to a smaller apartment after the\nwar, he -- he got one of those little gardens outside the city and th-there was no\nquestion as t -- his garden, his little garden was the most luxuriant of any of them\naround. And -- and he had all sorts of -- of little quirks. For example, he -- he dug a\nbig hole in that backyard, which became a -- a refrigerator. Was very, very clever,\nthat\u2019s where he kept his beer, so that when he worked in the backyard he could sit\nthere and -- this little yard, little garden, he had his -- his -- his little comforts from\nhome, actually.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nAugust 4, 2002\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer. This is tape number two, side\nA. And you were talking about Papa Madna. Any other memories that you have?\nWhat -- was he a very affectionate, physically affectionate person? Do you\nremember any of that?",
        "A: He was a very affectionate, very warm person. I\u2019m not sure about physical\naffection, but you know, we -- we were very, very, very close. He was always to --\nto the very end very protective of me, certainly. And I remember sitting on his lap. I\nremember also, this was immediately after the war when I was allowed to go out of\nthe house, I remember sitting on the back of his bicycle, or he also had a little seat\non the front of his bicycle where I would sit, and I enjoyed that a great deal. We\nwould take long walks together. He -- the -- we\u2019d alway -- he would always -- this\nwas after the war, immediately after the war an-and he worked in a -- in a restaurant\nand I would go up the back stairs with him and the Indonesian women who worked\nin the kitchens would always have little snacks for me. He -- he always as -- as --\neven when it was really no longer necessary he would always have a -- a little\nsavings, a piggy bank for me, for example. He fashioned those out of his cigarette\nboxes. These were Player cigarettes, which came in metal cans at the time, and I\nAugust 4, 2002\nremember he made those into a piggy bank for myself. And that continued for a\nlong time. He bought me comic books, because he knew there was one comic strip\nthat I really enjoyed called \u201cPanda\u201d which was really just only found in Holland,\nand he would always buy me the little books, and I -- I really enjoyed those. So we -\n- we really had a very, very close relationship. And that -- that continued to the very\nend of his life when he died at age 96. I-I saw him just two months before he died.\nJoel and I went to vi -- went to Holland and we visited him, spent quite a bit of\ntime with him and with his t -- other children. And I -- I remember his final gesture\n-- first of all, his final words to me was to -- to be careful, and watch over my\nmother, which was very typical. This is the way he had always been, very\nconcerned about her as well. And then, as we were leaving the apartment building\nhe stood at the window waving a white handkerchief. And that was the last gesture,\nthat was the last time I saw him alive. And then two months later I went back for\nthe funeral. And people say that he kept himself alive waiting for me to come and\nvisit him one last time because he -- he and I were very, very close. And I also to --\nto the very end always called him Papa. There were no qualifications to that. Now,\nMima we have not talked about. Obviously, the person who really raised me,\nespecially when I was very young, when I was an infant, was Mima. I was told that\nI slept in her bed, slept with her. And I was also told that Mima kept a knife under\nAugust 4, 2002\nher pillow and that she said that if ever the Germans came for me, she would kill me\nand then herself. Again, I have no direct knowledge of that, but that\u2019s what I was\ntold. I was very, very close to her. I have absolutely no direct memory of -- of\nMima, except perhaps the few words of -- of -- of Malay Indonesian that I\nremember, but other than that, I have no direct memory while she was alive. Mima\ntragically died shortly after the war. She died in October 1945 of a cerebral\nhemorrhage, very, very unexpectedly. And I do remember visiting her grave many\ntimes. I also remember going back there to -- to the grave when Papa Madna buried\nhis favorite canary in -- in the same grave, the gravesite. And many, many years\nlater I went to visit the grave with Papa Madna. And th-there -- there was a woman\nat the gate, who again, because of the combination of an Indonesian man and a\nCaucasian young man -- younger man, immediately knew who I was and\nrecognized me from the little child who had come to visit the grave of Mima. And I\nwas able to find the grave without anybody telling me where it was. So there was a\nvery sharp divide, I just totally bla -- have -- have totally -- have no direct memory\nof her alive, but I do remember her grave very well, very distinctly.",
        "Q: Were there any times when it was very dangerous? Did any Germans come to\nthe house? Was there any particular incidents like that?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I have no direct memories of any particular dangerous times, but I do remember\nbeing asked to hide in this -- it\u2019s not -- a little cellar. Was a space, I thought it was\nbeneath the stairs, but I\u2019m not quite sure there were stairs there. There was a little\ncellar and th-that\u2019s where all the families -- the families\u2019 Christmas decorations\nwere -- were -- were actually kept, and I -- I remember playing with them while the\nhouse apparently was being searched. Another memory that I have of the house besi\n-- | mentioned the little barrel before -- my very favorite place in the house was\nactually the kneehole of Papa Madna\u2019s desk. It was sort of a dark mahogany desk\nand I -- I still very distinctly remember that kneehole. I also remember opening one\nof the drawers one time and finding a gun and then closing the drawer again. And I\n-- | didn\u2019t tell anybody about it at the time, but told Papa Madna about it many,\nmany years later and he was absolutely shocked that I had seen it and remembered\nit.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So what did -- what were you told that you did during the day? You\njust played with Mima, and -- the other children were at school, correct?",
        "A: I think I just -- I -- I really -- I -- I don\u2019t know, specifically. I did play with some\nof the children next door, there were other young children, and I have some\nphotographs.",
        "Q: But only in your backyard.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: On -- only in our backyard. And I -- I did have my toys, and I did look out the\nmail slot to the outside, but just was confined to the house. But I -- I really do not\nrecall anything sp-specific as to what -- what I did in the house during those years.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of what it was like to look through the mail slot to\nsee the outside world?",
        "A: Not really, you know. I-I remember doing it, and standing there and evy -- and\neven the mail sl -- even though the mail slot was very low, to me it seemed very\nhigh, I do remember that. You know, van Kinsbergenstraat was actually a very\nquiet street, there wasn\u2019t much going on, even there. And so I think I spent more\ntime, really, in the backyard than anywhere else, which was enclosed, so that people\nreally couldn\u2019t look in very easily.",
        "Q: And these two people were your parents at the time, Mima and -- and Mr.\nMadna were your mama and your papa.",
        "A: Absolutely. And that was, you know, became very difficult, of course, when I\nwas reunited with my mother.",
        "Q: While this was -- while you were at the Madna\u2019s, what was happening with your\ntwo sisters?",
        "A: Unfortunately there was -- a fight apparently had broken out between the\nhusband and wife of the home where my sisters were hidden, and the husband\nAugust 4, 2002\ndenounced of his wife and of my two sisters to the Germans. And so his wife and\nmy two sisters were deported. They were taken to Westerbork, and were actually\nthere at about the same time as my mother. Either there, or subsequently in\nAuschwitz [indecipherable] obviously they never saw each other. The woman, the\nwife eventually was liberated, but my sisters were deported from -- taken from\nWesterbork in 1944, early 1944 to -- to Auschwitz and they both died in\nAuschwitz. And it\u2019s na -- something that we did not -- my mother did not find out\nuntil she returned, actually, back to Holland. I\u2019m not sure whether my mother had\nhad any warning when she was still in Sweden. I -- I just -- we never talked about it.\nI really don\u2019t know exactly when she found out. I don\u2019t think she found out until\nshe actually returned to Holland, what had happened to my sisters. My mother was\nso upset at the time, obviously, that she -- she squeezed -- she developed this habit\nof squeezing her fi -- her hand with -- with her other hand, one hand with the other\nand she actually developed an infection in her fingers. It was -- you know, she\nsqueezed so hard. I remember very distinctly the time when I was reunited with my\nmother, finally. This was in -- in August 1945.",

        "A: -- flow together. I do remember leaving the house and I-I\u2019m told I was all\ndressed up in -- in the national colors of -- of Holland, and watching a parade. It\u2019s\ninteresting because I don\u2019t have any direct memory of that, but I do have a memory\nof about eight months later or so, being with my mother at the place where we\nwatched the parade and telling her that\u2019s where I was with Mima. That memory I\ndo have, which 1s -- which 1s interesting. And -- and my mother really didn\u2019t believe\nme at the time, and she had to -- she verified this with the family. But other than\nthat, I really don\u2019t have any -- any specific memories of -- of the months before my\nmother returned. When I was -- I -- I was sleeping the night she came back and\nsomeone came to wake me up. I don\u2019t know who it was. I think it was one of my\nsisters, foster sisters, Davy or Willy. And I went to the front room of the house\nwhere everybody was sitting in a circle. And I was crying because I was unhappy\nabout being woken up, and I was being passed around from lap to lap. And I do\nAugust 4, 2002\nremember very distinctly refusing to sit in a strange woman\u2019s lap, and that, of\ncourse, was my own mother. And it took awhile for my mother to -- for me to get\nused to my mother, and to be -- I -- I have no specific memories of all the things\nthat happened. One thing my mother told me was that she as -- she told Mima -- she\n-- she got tickets for Mima to go to a movie, which was something very special at\nthat time, and just so -- so that my mother would have some time alone with me.\nAnd Mima left the house and then came back a few minutes later and told my\nmother, don\u2019t hit him. Just -- that\u2019s how protective, of course, Mima was, even vis-\na-vis with my mother. Initially my mother and I stayed with the Madna family and\nthen my mother found an apar -- was a very small apartment. Well, these were\nfurnished rooms, really. Again, somewhere not far from where our original home\nhad been on Laanformairdafort, another -- sort of all in the same general area. It\nwas an apartment upstairs and a woman and her daughter lived there and they --\nthey rented out the front room. I do remember that they had a little dog. You know,\nit\u2019s funny what children remember. Little dachshund.",
        "Q: How long did -- did your mother stay at the Madna\u2019s? She stayed with you at\nthe Madna\u2019s for how long?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I think 1t was a few weeks, I\u2019m not sure entirely, cause then we moved with -- to\nthis first apartment and I think we were only there for a month or two and then\nmoved to a larger apartment.",
        "Q: D-Do you have any memories of leaving the Madna house?",
        "A: You know, I think that this -- I -- I don\u2019t, and I think part of that is because it\nwas a very gradual thing. I still spent a lot of time with them --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- initially.",
        "Q: I mean, you were -- you were only -- close to four years old, you were still a\nvery young child.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s really only probably after Mima died that I moved entirely with, or\nprimarily with -- with my mother. And she -- sh -- she had to go out of the house to\ntry to make a living, and the reason I say that I -- I -- I was really away from the\nMadna family at that point, because I remember one time having trouble getting\ninto the apartment and that was because my mother was away, she was actually\nselling some of the merchandise that my father had left behind from his tailoring\nbusiness. Fabrics were very valuable at the time and he had many factories that\nowed him fabrics from -- from England. And that\u2019s -- that was her first business,\nwas Selling those.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Who kept up his stock while he was taken away?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. This was not in his store any more, the store was -- was\ngone, had been taken over. So these -- this was really more a credit sort of -- and my\nmother, actually, her initial work was out of a suitcase. But then I remember the day\nwhen -- when I couldn\u2019t get into the house, she was extremely upset and that\u2019s\nwhen she decided to -- to start her own business, basically and she bought us a\nstore. But this was over a fairly long period of time. I would imagine -- I think she\nbought the store probably about 1947 or so. \u2019'm not entirely sure because I had\nalready gone to kindergarten at a -- at a school that was around the corner from that\nsecond apartment that we lived in.",
        "Q: Was that a hard adjustment, to leave, to go to a strange school?",
        "A: [love difficulties mixing with other children. I don\u2019t remember too much to --\nhaving too many difficulties at the kindergarten, actually, but I do remember my\nmother sending me to a summer camp. And that -- that created tre-tremendous\ndifficulties and fears.",
        "Q: Was it a Jewish camp?",
        "A: It was a Jewish camp called Wijk aan Zee, not too far from -- from Amsterdam\nand I was surrounded by very, very rowdy Jewish kids who had all been in hiding\nand who all had, in retrospect, tremendous difficulties, you know, they were very\nAugust 4, 2002\ndifficult to control. And I had come from at -- you know, very quiet household,\nbasically. I had had it easy compared to -- to many of them. And I was -- so I -- I\njust did not fit in, and I had trouble, you know, wi-with that. So then the next place\nthat my mother sent me to for summer vacation was not a summer camp, but it was\nactually a private home where I went with m -- friends of my mother in a -- ina\ntown called Appledorn. And th-that\u2019s -- that worked out much, much better.",
        "Q: Y-You have actual memories of th -- of those experiences?",
        "A: Of?",
        "Q: Of being with those children who were rowdy, and so forth?",
        "A: Very much so, yeah. I remember vomiting every day and really being sick and\nthen finally my mother, you know, take me -- took me back. I -- I did not last one\nwe -- I think I lasted about a week and then she took me back, and -- because it d --\nit just did not work out.",
        "Q: How was your proficiency in Dutch? Were you -- you said you -- you knew\nIndonesian at the time. Were -- were you also being brought up as a youngster to\nspeak Dutch when you were with the Madnas?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember ever having any difficulties when I was in -- when I started\nkindergarten or school, so I think I -- I -- I think I was pretty fluent in Dutch. As I\nsaid, I d -- I never -- I don\u2019t remember ever speaking Malay, so this was really very,\nAugust 4, 2002\nvery early on. It\u2019s only in speaking to Robby and Davy that I -- you know, that I\nwas told that I -- I really did communicate and answered in -- in Malay whenever I\nwas spoken to. And I was able to understand Mima. But -- but I must have, you\nknow, learned Dutch at that time as well from the other children.",
        "Q: Did you ask your mother about the rest of the family? Again, I know you were\nvery young at this time, but when you were -- in the beginning, those first few years\nafter the war, did you ask her? And if so, how did she answer you?",
        "A: I learned about my sisters and -- and about my -- my father very, very early on.\nThe interesting thing is, you know, that at that time my story was not unique. So\nhaving sisters who were deported was not unusual. And so it didn\u2019t particularly\nshock me, it didn\u2019t particularly affect me. They were just gone. And my mother --\nmy mother\u2019s neighbor, the Van Luhrmann family, they were both schoolteachers\nand they had taught my sisters how to -- to read and write at a very, very young age.\nAnd they and my mother had saved all of my sisters\u2019 notebooks. And my mother\nwould show me those notebooks. And this -- this was before I started elementary\nschool, so it was really pretty soon after the war that she showed me those. She had\nportraits of my sisters that were -- that were hanging 1n -- in the -- in the apartment.\nSo again I knew certainly, of them. She told me many stories about my sisters. They\nwere held out, really as a example to me in many ways. And so I got to know my\nAugust 4, 2002\nsisters through my mother\u2019s words and also through her neighbors, the Van\nLuhrmann family. They v -- also showed me -- my mother showed me the\nnotebooks that -- that my sister Eva was writing in. I don\u2019t think my sister Leah\nwas -- she was much younger, obviously did not know how to -- to write, but the\nVan Luhrmann family also showed me books, and they were actually -- because,\nas I said before, my sisters had gone to a Catholic religious school, so she would\nshow me books, little Catholic books that my sisters were able to read. And I\nremember had a little devil one side, a little angel on the other side. And I -- I\nremember very distinctly looking at those. My mother always told me that she --\nshe had decided that she did not want me to learn how to read at a very young age.\nShe thought somehow that this was a jinx. That when -- when, you know, my sisters\nwere So precocious in their reading and writing, that somehow had something to do\nwith -- with their -- with their fate. And so in my case, my mother really did not\nencourage that.",
        "Q: Who watched over your parent\u2019s belongings while you were gone? You said\nyour mother had pictures of your sister, or portraits, or other things. Who -- who\noversaw that?",
        "A: The Van Luhrmann family next door had some of the things. There were others\nalso who -- who had hidden things, and we sort of gradually -- my mother gradually\nAugust 4, 2002\nhad things returned to her. Again, you know, this -- this was sort of part of normal\nlife, to have things returned. All the people we had contact with after the war were\npeople who were -- either had survived the concentration camps or people who had\nbeen in hiding, so that was normal conversation. You know, it was how you\nsurvived. How did you survive, what did you do? It\u2019s without -- with very little\nemotion, as far as I can remember, actually, because it was so much -- just an\neveryday occurrence.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The same thing, for example, one of the families that we were very close with\nafter the war was the Vanderpool family. Hela Vanderpool was a woman who had\ngone through all the concentration camps with my mother. And she was younger\nthan my mother. Also came from the same general area in Poland, Galicia. And\nafter the war married a -- a Dutch man. Her -- her maiden name was Helen -- Helen\nEnwine and then she married Max Vanderpool. And my mother remained very\nclose friends with her. Probably -- she was probably my mother\u2019s closest friend.\nAnd the only housing that they could find in The Hague was in the attic of one\nhouse that was sort of left standing 1n this entire bombed out neighborhood. And I\nremember this is a time my mother already had her store, taking this very, very long\nwalk across this bombed out area, this -- this -- all this debris and rubble, through\nAugust 4, 2002\nthe rubble to this house where they lived, this attic. And again, it was -- 1t was a\njoyful occasion to take those walks. I thought it was the most normal thing to do,\nwas to take a walk across, you know, bombed out rubble. I remember thinking that\nit was the most normal thing to find bunkers with shells on the beach. Again, this\nwas just part of normal growing up after World War II.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Alfred Munzer. This is tape number two, side\nB. And let\u2019s now talk about your schooling after the war.",
        "A: Well, before I even started schooling, my mother, who as I said before, did not\nreally want me to learn how to read or write before had to teach me some other\nthings. And that was the first thing she taught me, was really a love for -- for\ntheater, and for theater type games, and I remember very distinctly playing those.\nShe would tell me things that -- plays that she had done when she was a young girl,\nyoung -- growing up 1n Poland, she was part of a -- a theater company. And I\nwould remember those, and that\u2019s -- and I would -- I would actually start playing\nthose before I even learned how to read or write, with a puppet theater. That became\none of my favorite toys. Another thing that really fascinated me, probably because I\nAugust 4, 2002\nhad spent those early years completely confined to the house was the tramway\noutside and going from place to place on -- on public -- this public conveyance, on\nthe tramway. And I very quickly memorized all of the stops on the tramway, the\nlocal tramway. And one of the first toys that I got from Papa Madna after the war\nfor my -- the first birthday that occurred after the war was a miniature tram. And\nright about that time the numbers, in sort of a bureaucratic thing, were -- were\nchanged on the tramway. And I remember, since I didn\u2019t know how to read or write\nyet, but I did remember asking either Willy or Davy to make sure and change the\nnumber on my tramway. It\u2019s a very, very distinct memory I have. This was just\nabout the time when I started kindergarten. The kindergarten was right around the\ncorner from the house that my mother and I lived in, which was on a place called\nArchimaidastraat [indecipherable] street -- straat in -- in -- in The Hague and\nright around the corner was the first school that I went to. And I do remember very\ndistinctly enjoying kindergarten, doing all the things pe -- children do in\nkindergarten, you know, making things wi -- c -- playing with clay, remember that\nvery distinctly. Little artwork, bringing that home, learning about some -- some\nholidays. For example, I -- I learned about Mother\u2019s day through kindergarten and\nbringing home a card that I had made for my mother. I also remember going\nshopping to buy my mother a gift, and 1t was a geranium. That was the first plant. I\nAugust 4, 2002\nwent to a store and asked her, you know, if she has this much money, whatever it\nwas, I said, what would she get? And so that\u2019s -- that was the first time I ever\nbought a gift for my mother. I think for her birthday, which was very close actually,\nsince that was May 20\" -- the two were very close -- I bought her a bottle of\nperfume which I accidentally dropped. Also one of those -- those childhood\nmemories. I kept it hidden from her in back of -- and so I was holding it in back of\nme, and phew, it fell to the floor as th -- as she opened the door. After -- 1t was after\nkindergarten that -- just about that time that my mother bought her business. That\nwas in a -- that was a -- a cosmetic store, perfume store. It was in the --in -- not ina\nvery good neighborhood, quite far away from where we had lived before and where\nI had spent my years with the Madnas. This was near the -- one the train stations in\nThe Hague. Little bit of a red light district, as a matter of fact, and certainly non --\nnot a wealthy neighborhood, but it was the only -- housing was extremely short in\nHolland because o f-- in The Hague especially, because such a big part of the city\nhad been bombed out by the allies, actually. And so we -- she found this -- this\nstore, this perfume store from a man who -- it was called Parfumerie Idajale, and\nshe bought it from a man by the name of Sharfstein who moved to South America.\nAnd she took over the store and we lived in back of the store. And then I -- she --\nshe had to decided on a school for me to go to -- decided that the -- the public\nAugust 4, 2002\nschools were just not the greatest in that neighborhood. There was a -- a Catholic\nschool right across the street from us, but for whatever reason, my mother did not\nwant to go that route -- route again, because probably it brought back too many\nmemories of my sisters. So instead, I went to a -- a private Protestant school called\nthe Weeshuis, it was called Weeshuis, it means orphanage. I don\u2019t know whether\nthere -- there ever was an orphanage attached to that school at one point, but that\nwas what it was called, the orphanage school. Which was a fair distance from --\nfrom home, but not -- not too great and I -- I was able to walk to school by myself,\nand I went there for my -- for the first few grades, first two grades.",
        "Q: Was that a pleasant experience? Did you find a better adjustment with the other\nchildren then you did in the summer experience?",
        "A: Oh definitely, I -- I did very well in -- in elementary school, I did very well in --\nI did very well in kindergarten and I did very well, I had no trouble whatsoever in\nelementary school in terms of fact, you know, I sort of became a leader among ah,\nthe children. I had no trouble making friends at all. There was an incident with --\nwith a schoolteacher who sang a song that had some inappropriate words in it and I\ntold my mother about it, and --",
        "Q: You mean anti-Semitic?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: No, no, not anti-Semitic, just sexual. And he made some gestures that were\ninappropriate and I told my mother about it, and I -- you know, the teacher and the\nprincipal of the school, with whom we were very good friends, my mother had\nbecome close friends with the fre -- with the principal and I was very close friends\nwith the principal\u2019s son. His name was Bati Bos, B-o-s. And they came over to the\nhouse and I was confronted, I was asked to -- to confront the teacher and tell them\nwhat -- what had happened, and I did. And after that my mother decided to change\nschools and I then went on, took a tramway actually to go back to take -- to -- to\nattend the school in the neighborhood where we had lived before the war, because\nmy mother really felt those were the better schools. And that was a public school.\nAnd that\u2019s where I went for third and fourth grades [indecipherable] something\napproximately, and I again, you know, enjoyed that. And then subsequently then,\nafter that, is when we -- when we moved to Belgium. And so I attended schools in -\n- in Brussels.",
        "Q: When did you move to Belgium?",
        "A: We moved to Brussels, if I remember correctly, probably 1952 -- either 19 --\nsome time between 1950 and 1952 1s when we moved to Belgium. And my mother\nat that point, at the -- was considering or attempting a remarriage that -- that utterly\nfailed, but we did end up living in Belgium for several years.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Was that hard for you, to leave the Madnas?",
        "A: It was difficult to leave the Madnas and by then also I had become very close\nwith -- with other friends of my mother\u2019s. For example, one family that we\u2019re v --\nwe were very, very close with was a family that lived -- called Ravensbergan.\nHusband was Truus, T-r-u-u-s, and Piet, P-i-e-t. They -- my -- my Uncle Emil,\nwhom I mentioned earlier, had actually been hidden with them in this little town\ncalled Rijnsburg, outside of Leiden. And -- but he was -- he was found out by the\nGermans and was deported. And I never really found out anything else about him. I\nhave no new information whatsoever. But we became very close friends with the\nRavensbergan family and we would spend many weekends traveling there. We\nwould take the train, first to Leiden and then a second, more local tramway,\nactually [indecipherable] tramway to the town of -- of -- of -- where they lived.\nAnd I -- I would spend weekends there, or sometimes a week and I would ver -- I\nwas very, very close with those people. By that time the Vanderpool family had\nleft for the United States. They emigrated du -- in 1948 to the United States, so\nthat was a loss for my mother. And that\u2019s, I think, when she became really very --\neven closer friends with -- with these -- the Ravensbergan in -- in Rijnsburg. And\nwe would go there almost every other weekend. And -- and leaving them when we\nmoved to Brussels was very, very difficult. And I remember catching rides\nAugust 4, 2002\nperiodically to get back to visit them. Rijnsburg is a -- is an area where it\u2019s in the\nmiddle of all the flower fields of Holland, the flower industry. And trucks with\nflowers would go to Belgium to deliver them to the market. And when these trucks\nwould go back empty I would catch a ride with them to go back and visit the family\nfrom Brussels. So I remained in very close contact with them as well.",
        "Q: Was your mother extremely protective of you when you were young, after the\nwar because of what you went through? Did -- did you sense that maybe more than\nother parents of your friends?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: When you were in elementary school.",
        "A: Sure. It\u2019s hard to say, you know, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s compared to what, you\nknow, I have no -- I have no way of comparing. I-I don\u2019t f -- you know, I -- when I\nwas in elementary school I became -- I had -- I became very, very ill. I had a\nruptured appendix. And this was in my first year in elementary school, if I\nremember correctly. And at that -- at that time there was no -- there were no\nantibiotics, as yet. Penicillin had just come out. So I was really very, very sick. I\nwas in the hospital for about 10 weeks altogether. And my mother had a tremendous\nfear that she was going to lose me at that time. And she talked about that, a lot. And\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s when I really found out how much I meant to her, that -- that -- you\nAugust 4, 2002\nknow. I was the one thing that kept her going, and she told me that many, many,\nmany times. So yes, you know, she was very protective. But at the same time, for\nexample, did allow me to play outside, did allow me to have friends, encouraged me\nto walk to school by myself, even though there was some danger there. And one\ntime I was almost hit by a car. But nonetheless, sh-she did allow me that freedom\nand she allowed me to grow up, basically. So she was not overly protective. She\nalso tried to encourage me to mix with other children. Hence, you know, the -- the\ncamp I mentioned before. I went to -- I would go to the Protestant elementary\nschool in the mornings and then in the afternoon I would go to a cheder, to a -- a\nHebrew school which was in a building adjacent to the big synagogue in The\nHague. And that was a very, very long walk actually. But I [indecipherable] my\nmother never accompanied me. She couldn\u2019t, she had her store. And she certainly\nallowed me to go there by myself, and I -- I do remember attending the Hebrew\nschool. I remember also her warning, because I was -- the -- the Protestant school\nwas extremely good at teaching Bible, and so she -- she told -- and I was very good\nat that, so she told me, don\u2019t repeat in the afternoon, what you learned in the\nmorning.",
        "Q: Did you feel very Jewish then, when you were that young? You really knew you\nwere Jewish.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I definitely knew that I was Jewish. I -- certainly my mother made -- you know,\nsent me to the cheder very, very early on. I think at the same time, virtually that I\nstarted elementary school, I started going to the cheder, which wasn\u2019t much of a\nschool at the time because there were very, very few kids left. My teacher was the\ncantor of the synagogue, Mr. Mussel, and I -- I don\u2019t remember too much of what\nwe -- what he ler -- what he taught us, but I -- and shortly -- it was around that time\nalso, when my mother definitely found out that my father had died, when we got\ndocumentation through the Red Cross. My mother had a very good friend who\nworked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Liza. And he managed to speed\nthings up so that we got documents from the Red Cross explaining exactly what had\nhappened to my father. And as soon as we found out when he had died exactly, we -\n- my mother di -- encouraged me to learn to say Kaddish and to go to the synagogue\non his Yahrzeit. And I probably was about six or seven when I started doing that.\nAnd I also remember going, certainly, to the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, on Yom\nKippur with my mother. I remember very distinctly, for example -- you know, that -\n- this was an Orthodox synagogue in The Hague and so the women sat in the\ngallery upstairs and of course, there I was all by myself downstairs, and I had to be\nadopted by some -- some of the men downstairs, yes. And I remember for the first\ntime th-the honor of rolling up the -- the scroll, the Torah scroll is usually given to a\nAugust 4, 2002\nchild in Holland, and I remember being given the honor. And then afterwards, you\nknow, going over and shaking the hand of the president of the congregation, or the\nparness, as we called him there, and then rushing upstairs to the balcony to ask my\nmother if I had done okay.",
        "Q: Did she observe the Sabbath at your house?",
        "A: Yes, she did. She -- she certainly lit candles on Friday night and she observed\nPesach, very distinctly I remember. The Pesach I remember most distinctly was in\n-- in 1948, and the reason I remember it is because my mother was telling me the\nstory about the Egyptians, and then at the same time there was the Arab Israeli war.\nAnd I remember asking how -- her how this was possible since all the Egyptians\nhad already been defeated. Passover. So that was -- that was -- I remember that. I\nremember, you know, going out and buying matzos, which were hard to get in\nHolland. They were round and came in special boxes. The other thing was that --\nthat I remember in terms of -- of -- of Jewish things is that I had -- a-as I indicated\nbefore, I went to a Protestant school, and either the principal of the school or\nsomeone passed out -- passed my name on to a -- a pastor, a p -- a Protestant pastor\nwho was a Jewish convert, by the name of Suril Tabachsblaat. And he came to my\nmother\u2019s store with the idea, I think, of trying to convert her to becoming\nProtestant. But by the time he left the store, she had sent him on errands in\nAugust 4, 2002\nAntwerp, she knew he was going to Antwerp, and so he brought back mezuzahs\nand a siddur, which we didn\u2019t have, you know, none of that was left. And to this\nday the mezuzah on my door is the mezuzah that Mr. Tabachsblaat brought back\nfrom Antwerp. She also persuaded him to let her -- and I don\u2019t think it took much -\n- she told him, she said we were going to have a Seder and she said, you know,\nSeder is not necessarily a Jewish thing, why don\u2019t you have a Seder in your church?\nAnd she -- she persuaded him, something that became very commonplace\nafterwards, to have a Seder in the church. And my mother spoke to his congregants\nabout the Jewish lifecycle events. And my mother, in many ways, I think,\nrediscovered Judaism after the war. Her experiences in the concentration camps did\nnot seem to lessen her faith, but if anything increased it, and she became much more\ninterested in Judaism after the war. Before the war she -- she used the word,\nsearching. After the war there was no searching any more.",
        "Q: When you were at this Protestant school, where there other J-Jewish children\nthere?",
        "A: No, there were no other Jewish children at the -- at the Protestant school, I wa --\nas far as I know, I was the only one there.",
        "Q: Were you accepted by the other children?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Yes. I -- I don\u2019t think there was a -- as I said, you know, I was very close friends,\nfor example, with the -- the son of the principal. The principal\u2019s wife was also one\nof the schoolteachers and I -- I remember watching her grading papers and things\nlike that and spending a lot of time in their household, and I had many other\nchildren in the playground. And I had no difficulty, you know, playing games with\nthem. I remember our favorite game -- my favorite game at that time, because I\nenjoyed going to -- Papa Madna had taken me to the circus and my mother took me\nto the circus in Holland, which is really a big deal over there, and I remember\nplaying circus in -- in the playground with the other children.",
        "Q: Then, did your mother talk about your father and the children as you got older --\nyour sisters, as they -- got older, was it a big topic of conversation?",
        "A: Well, as I said before, my mother showed me my sister\u2019s notebooks and through\nthe Van Luhrmann family I also -- you know, we constantly talked about my\nsisters. Maybe a little bit less so about my father except my mother did tell me\nabout the -- his store, and what it looked like and the furniture they had bought. In\nmany ways he was really kept, you know, in the family and very early on she gave\nme a -- apen, a Parker pen that belonged to him, which I have -- which I still have.\nThat sort of became a good luck charm. Whenever I took an exam or anything, she\ntold me to take the pen along and use that pen for writing. So she -- she -- she really\nAugust 4, 2002\ntried, you know, to impress on me who my father was. Said things like, you know,\nyour father is with you. And when -- whenever, you know, there were moments of\ndifficulty, or -- or sadness, or po-potential difficulties, we -- I do remember fairly\nearly on after the war, visiting the woman who had hidden my sisters, where my\nsisters had been hidden. She and her husband, as far as I know, separated, so he was\nnot there. But my mother took me in to what -- t-to what me seemed -- seemed like\na very long trip actually on the tramway, way outside The Hague, somewhere near\nthe beach is where this woman lived. And it was very important to my mother to\nthank this woman and let her know that at least one of the children had survived and\nto relieve some of this woman\u2019s guilt. And my mother gave her some -- some\nmoney, some gifts. I don\u2019t know whether my mother had any subsequent contact\nwith her. That must obviously have been an incredibly difficult time. We also had\ncontinued contact with the two priests, one of them I mentioned before, Father\nSchulling, the other one was called Father Lodders, L-o-d-d-e-r-s, and he was --\noh, he was much younger though, Schulling was the older man and Lodders was a\n-- a younger, Jesuit priest. And he would come to visit my mother\u2019s store quite\nfrequently on his motor bike. And I -- I very much remember him also. And in some\nways they -- they also encouraged me in Judaism. Not too many forms, actually, the\n-- you know, is -- I was at my -- my mother took great pride in exposing me in an ha\nAugust 4, 2002\n-- to -- to many different beliefs. It was very important to her, which is really\namazing after what she went through, to -- to have a respect and an understanding\nof other religions. And she would take great pride, for example, at birthday parties\nfor me, in counting around the table how many different religions she had\nrepresented. And there were always very devout Catholics, there were the Madnas,\nwho were probably Moslem in origin. There were the Protestant family from --\nfrom Rijnsburg. And you have to understand that in Holland, Protestants and\nCatholics do not speak to each other. But there they were, all around the table for\nmy birthday. And then there were Jewish members, and some of them were very\nOrthodox Jewish, and my mother took tremendous pride in bringing -- and in the\nconvert Minister. And my mother took tremendous pride in bringing all these\npeople around the table. This was very, very important to her.",
        "Q: You had mentioned that when you went to visit the woman who sheltered your\nsisters, your mother wanted to give her some gifts. Had j -- had your folks given any\nmoney to the Madnas to take care of you?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t give any money, as far as I know, to the Madnas, or they had th\n-- in other words, there was no money paid for my -- for -- for -- for them sheltering\nme. They did give them some ration cards and ration coupons so that they could\nobtain food for me. There may have been some money, you know, to -- to -- to help\nAugust 4, 2002\ntake care of me, defray expenses, basically. But they certainly weren\u2019t paid, you\nknow, to take care of me. There was no -- no -- no, there was no monetary gain to\nthem.",
        "Q: And what about the family that took your sisters?",
        "A: I think it was the same thing. No, it was really -- my sisters, th -- all their\npossessions were taken to them. And again, the most important thing at that time\nwas ration cards, and I remember what they looked like, even. I remember\nimmediately after the war even, you know, when rationing continued, going with\nmy mother to get those ration cards at an -- at an office and standing on line to get\nthem. So I was -- I was very familiar with those.",
        "Q: And then you also mentioned the probab -- possibly the Moslem background of\nthe Madnas. Were there any holidays or any traditions that you -- that they carried\nout while you were there?",
        "A: Christmas was the only holiday because I remember the decorations. They had a\nChristmas tree and it was decorated. There were no electric lights, but I remember\nthere were real candles in the -- in -- in the Christmas tree. I\u2019m not entirely sure\nwhether there was one during the war years, or whether the one that I remember\nwas immediately after. I th -- it may have been immediately after when my mother\nwas actually in -- I just remembered that now, is when my mother was actually\nAugust 4, 2002\nliving there with us. She was there at the time, also. So this may -- this -- this may\nhave been the first Christmas, 1945, but I\u2019m not --",
        "Q: I -- I -- I thought you said she stayed a few weeks with them?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. Or whether she came back, we came back to stay with them, that\nmay have been, but -- but it\u2019s -- I remember my mother being there for -- for that\nChristmas at -- at -- at the Madnas. And we may have had the trees before. I do\nremember that, you know, seeing the decorations before, but that\u2019s where sort of\nmemories blend into each other.",
        "Q: Right. Did you have any hobbies when you were a small child? Any -- or did\nyou like sports?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t play many sp -- any sports, I -- I rode a bicycle, but what I -- my -- th-the\nearliest hobby that I had as a child carried through from the puppet theater. I u -- I\nused to really take the puppet theater to all my friends birthdays an-and have puppet\nplays for them. And then the next phase after that, related to that 1s when I started\nwriting plays, and I started doing that when I was what, about six or seven, as soon\nas I learned how to -- to write. I still have some of those early manuscripts and they\nwere based on stories that my mother told me. And my f-first play was produced in\nelementary school, and I remember taking down my mother\u2019s curtains -- draperies,\nto make -- fashion curtains for my stage. I also had little gifts for the teachers, to get\nAugust 4, 2002\nthem to send their kids in to watch my play. And I\u2019m ashamed to admit it now, but I\nhad little packets of cigarettes and had little samples, soap samples, I remember\nthose, they were in the shape of a hand, because those are things my mother got in\nher store. So those -- I handed those out to entice people to come and watch my\nplay.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nAugust 4, 2002\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Alfred Munzer. This is tape number three, side A, and you were\ntalking about your performances and your playwriting ability.",
        "A: Well, this was something that really was encouraged by my mother, who had a\ntremendous love for theater. My mother was also an accomplished painter, but I\ncould never master that, but the writing -- I really did enjoy playwriting. And I also\nlearned public speaking and the way that came about was kind of interesting. When\nwe would go spend our weekends with the family in -- in Rijnsburg, another\nreligious angle, I would also always go to church with the family. And after the\nchurch service I would be able to repeat the sermon that I had heard almost\nverbatim. And so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s really where I learned public speaking, and I\u2019ve --\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed that, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very, very valuable experience I had. But\nthe interesting thing 1s again, that my mother was not afraid to have me exposed to a\nvariety of experiences, and then to know at the same time that my -- my Jewish\nfoundations would remain very, very strong. One more thing in the involvement in\nterms of the Jewish community in -- in The Hague; I mentioned, you know,\nattending services, but there also was a -- a Purim party immediately -- very shortly\nafter the war. My guess is that it would probably have been \u201946 - \u201947 approximately,\nAugust 4, 2002\nprobably more \u201947 because I remember where we lived at the t -- we were living at\nthe time. My mother already had her store, and she would dress me up as a Karen\nKayemet collection box. And I won second prize, actually. First prize was to a girl\nwho was dressed up as a Sabbath queen. And that -- that was a very, very major\nevent. Actually, you know, now -- now that I think about it, prior to this Purim fe --\nfeast, 1t was also an even earlier experience that I had, which was a Hanukkah party\nearlier, because I remember very distinctly the kinds of gifts that we got. And they\nwere not toys, they were not books, they were socks and very common things that\npeople needed immediately after the war. So that -- that probably was -- may have\nbeen the end of \u201945 - \u201946, something like that. As I remember also, related to that,\ngoing with my mother to -- to a place where packages would arrive from overseas,\nand one of my mother\u2019s brothers had survived and escaped to Bolivia and he\narranged for packages to be sent from the United States to us. And I remember\ngoing with my mother to collect those packages.",
        "Q: What about the extended members of your parents\u2019 families?",
        "A: As far as we know, the -- the only person who -- who survived for sure was one\nof my mother\u2019s brothers, Adolf, or Abraham Munzer. And he managed to leave\nGermany on th -- right after, or right around Kristallnacht, and the only country\nthat he could go to was Bolivia. He had married a German woman who converted to\nAugust 4, 2002\nJudaism, and they had one son, Norbert and the three of them managed to escape to\nBolivia. My mother\u2019s sister in Berlin was deported eventually, and -- with her\nfamily, her son Yossi, who was exactly the same age as Norbert, they sort of\nlooked alike, and I have some beautiful photographs of the two of them. But sh --\nthat part of the entire -- of the family was deported and all of the ones who\nremained behind, the immediate family that remi -- remained behind in Rymanow,\nor my father\u2019s side in Kanczuga, they all died at concentration camps. There were\nsome cousins of my mother, an aunt of my mother who survived and we did not\nfind out about that until we came to the United States. But she managed -- she\nsurvived with eight children, which was totally am-amazing, actually.",
        "Q: Were your parents strong Zionists?",
        "A: My mother was a member of some Zionist youth organizations, but I don\u2019t know\nhow strong Zionists they were. My mother, you know, did face the choice of after\nthe war, whether we should come to -- go to Israel or come to the United States.\nAnd I know it was a difficult choice for her. A lot of people did mo -- who we had\ncontact with in -- in Holland came -- went to Israel. And it was probably about\nequally divided. But she -- I guess I think she did not -- wasn\u2019t ready for renewed\nhardship and she felt -- and that\u2019s why we ca -- we eventually came to the United\nStates, although that was not so many years later.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to talk about before you move to Brussels?",
        "A: Do I think -- no, if things come up we can come back -- we\u2019ll backtrack.",
        "Q: All right, okay. So then your mother decided to move to Brussels?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, we moved to Brussels in 1952 and she sold her business in The\nHague and we then remained in Brussels until 1958 when we came to the United\nStates. I attended scho -- my -- my education continued in Brussels and my mother\nmade a decision that the s -- French speaking schools were better than the a -- that\nthe Dutch spe -- the Flemish schools, so initially I went -- this -- this is where I did\ngo to a full time Jewish school actually, called the E-Ecole Israel Elite in -- in\nBrussels. And a little van would pick us up every day, make the rounds and pick up\nthe children for the school. Not a very big school, probably had about a hundred\nstudents is my -- my guess, at most. And I went there for approximately two years\nand then graduated and went to -- in -- in Belgium they call it attenay or it\u2019s li --\nLyc\u00e9e in French, or in France, but basically that\u2019s -- that\u2019s seventh grade. I started\nthe -- the Atheneum School, and that was -- that was not a Jewish school. That was\njust a -- a public high school, in French.",
        "Q: Was it hard for you to leave Brussels -- leave to go to Brussels?",
        "A: It was hard because we had very -- you know, as I said, we had many close\nfriends in Holland. My mother attempted a -- a remarriage, it didn\u2019t work out, she -\nAugust 4, 2002\n- it was someone, a man who was much older than she was. But at the same time,\nthe positive thing that came out of that, we became very, very -- I became very\nclose with his family in -- in Brussels, the Schumer family, and have maintained\nthat friendship to the present day. They were very, very warm, very supportive to\nme and to my mother. Some of the members of the family live here in the United\nStates, lived there at the time, they were coming back and forth between Belgium\nand -- and -- and the United States and others lived in -- in Brussels, actually. And\nthey -- so that became my next family. I also became much more aware of -- of\nJewish things, things Jewish after we moved to Brussels, Brussels had a much\nmore active Jewish community, more synagogues. It even had some, as I said\nbefore, a -- a full time Jewish school that -- that had somehow survived.",
        "Q: What about your Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: And that\u2019s where I had my Bar Mitzvah, in -- in Brussels, actually, in a fairly\nsmall synagogue, synagogue that was attached to a -- an old people\u2019s home, nursing\nhome actually. Nursing home or senior citizen home, and that\u2019s where we had the\nBar Mitzvah and it was very, very nice. I do remember that.",
        "Q: Did you have many friends?",
        "A: Fair number. Not -- not a great number of friends. The friends of the Schumer\nfamily, they were all there, but I -- we had some neighbors were friends, but ah,\nAugust 4, 2002\nJewish community even in -- in -- in Brussels was fairly small, so certainly I did\nnot have many, many friends. But nothing again, that seemed out of the ordinary f-\nfor me, simply because that\u2019s the way things were in Holland, you know, we\nweren\u2019t -- it was much more of -- of a -- of a shock really, coming to the United\nStates and becoming aware of the intensity of Jewish life and J-Jewish community.\nThat, you know, was just -- it\u2019s a totally different scale.",
        "Q: What was your life like in high school, junior high school, high school. Did you\ntalk about your early childhood with people? Were you accepted?",
        "A: I did not enjoy the Jewish day school particularly, I don\u2019t know why. It was -- I -\n- | just did not particularly get along well with my teachers. It\u2019s the only school\nexperience that I had that was negative, and I don\u2019t know why it -- why that was\nparticularly. I had a very good experience subsequently in the -- in the Belgian\nschool, the Atheneum. And did very wer -- well, even though French was a new\nlanguage to me, but still, you know, did very well. But there was some anti-\nSemitism there. It was very -- it was kind of subtle. There were several Jewish\nstudents in my class in the Atheneum, and we had religious -- Jewish religious\ninstruction in the public school. There\u2019s no separation of church and state in\nBelgium. And so the -- the probl -- the -- the s -- religion is handled differently.\nPeople -- students basically pick what religion -- religious instruction they want to\nAugust 4, 2002\nattend. So it could be protest -- they could go to a Protestant class, Catholic class,\nJewish class, or one that was called ethics. And I did go to -- to a class with a Mr.\nDeener, and I think, you know, the entire class we only had two or three students at\nany one time because there were so few Jews 1n the class. But then one time -- I did\nnot -- there were classes on Saturday mornings, that was part of the regular school\nweek, and I did not go to those classes on Saturday mornings, and I remember --\nand the principal, you know, contacted my mother and said that I -- I was in danger\nof failing, you know, because, you know, the Jewish students, you know, were --\nwere staying away on Saturday morning. And that didn\u2019t happen, the Jewish\nstudents graduated, you know, near the top of the class. But there was a -- that little\nbit, definitely. Anti-Semitism actually, hadn\u2019t thought of this, but certainly was\nprevalent also in Holland, and I -- I remember when I was walking back from\ncheder being pursued by kids yelling dirty Jew and things like that, or the\nequivalent in Dutch. Was -- Jew with glasses was the term, I can\u2019t translate it, burla\nyout. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that was a very common thing. So there was -- there\nwas a fair amount --",
        "Q: What did you do when you heard those expressions?",
        "A: Just -- just ran. It was very frightening. Very, very frightening. And --",
        "Q: Did you tell your mother?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Definitely. We talked about 1t and my mother had similar experiences, actually.\nOne time she -- we were on -- in line to go to a -- a movie and the newsreels. And I\ndon\u2019t know, someone noticed my mother\u2019s number and made a remark about, well\nthere\u2019s one they didn\u2019t get. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- there was still anti-Semitism after the\nwar, certainly, in -- in -- in Holland and in Belgium.",
        "Q: So then you stayed in Belgium until what year?",
        "A: Well, in ninet -- I stayed -- I -- my mother stayed in Belgium til 1958. I stayed in\nBelgium til 1956. I had gone to summer came in Belgium in a -- a summer camp\nsponsored by yeshiva. I\u2019d been to several summer camps, but the last one I went to\nwas one sponsored by a -- aj -- a -- a yeshiva, actually, near Antwerp. And they\nencouraged my mother to send me to a yeshiva full time. I was not getting along\nwith the man my mother had remarried and so that was one solution. And plus the\nfact that, you know, I was really encouraged. So we -- I went to a school in France,\na yeshiva in France in a town called [indecipherable] and my mother took me\nthere in -- in 1956 and that was a very, very wonderful experience, actually, a very,\nvery positive experience. An extremely warm, caring atmosphere",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t hard for you to keep picking up and changing where you lived, I\nmean you -- you had already, at a young age, had made so many moves. But you\nwere able to adapt to that. How do you explain that?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s just the facts, you know, that I did really\nda -- did make many changes, and somehow this -- this was a very, very different\natmosphere. Obviously this was a very Orthodox yeshiva. It was -- the -- the head\nof the yeshiva was from Lithuania. He was a student of the Chofetz Chaim, so it\nwas -- you know. But I -- somehow managed to fit in very -- fairly quickly. Again,\nmade very, very good friends very quickly. And took charge actually of the --\nvolunteered to take charge of the infirmary, that was my first inkling of becoming a\ndoctor. You know, all the students had different chores and my chores were in the\ninfirmary.",
        "Q: Whi-Which you chose, or you were assigned?",
        "A: No, I chose. So that was the first time that I made, you know, the choice that I --\nultimately I was going to be a physician. Th-The school was sort of -- had -- had\nstudents from -- half the students were Ashkenazi and the other half were\nSephardic from Morocco and Algeria. And so they -- that created -- there was an\ninteresting dynamic. That was a whole different exposure again because they spoke\nArabic, in addition to French and so to resolve that dilemma, the -- the head of the\nschool actually decreed that were two languages that could not be spoken. One was\nYiddish and the other one was Arabic, they were forbidden. And also, all the\nstudying, everything was done in French as a result of that, which was very, very\nAugust 4, 2002\ndifficult for the head of the school, because his -- his French was -- was atrocious.\nBut he was a very, very nice man who had been imprisoned during the war years.\nHis name was Haim Haiken. And he died in er -- a very advanced age, in early\n90\u2019s.",
        "Q: And you stayed there for two years?",
        "A: I was there for two years, and --",
        "Q: During that time did you have any correspondence or connection with the\nMadnas?",
        "A: I stayed in touch with the Madnas. I can\u2019t remember specifically whether during\nthat time I went to visit them. I think I did. I did go back to visit my mother, you\nknow, several times and finally, just before we left in -- in early July, after I had\ntaken some ex -- my exams, my final exams, which in -- in fr -- in France at th -- at\nthat stage are fairly elaborate. You have to go to a different city and be -- take an\noral exam, a written exam and then an oral exam by teachers from different parts of\nthe country to make sure it\u2019s absolutely honest. Well, anyway, I passed that exam\nand then there was -- you know, then I left the Yeshiva and for f -- to go to the\nUnited States. Basically, my mother never told the man that she had remarried to\nthat she was leaving, she just packed up her things and we met, actually. We\narranged to meet in Ebensee where my father was buried. I took the train from\nAugust 4, 2002\nFrance and she took the train from Belgium. And we met a little town called Bad\nIschl, which is very close to Ebensee. We met actually because of all the coupling,\nuncoupling of the trains, I remember meeting on the train and my mother was being\n-- walked from one end of the train, I walked from the other. And we went on to\nBad Ischl, stayed there overnight and then the following morning took the train to\nEbensee to visit my father\u2019s grave. My mother wanted to be sure that I saw it\nbefore we left for the United States. And then -- that\u2019s the first time that I really\nshed tears over my father. I remember very distinctly crying at the grave. The\nreality of my father had really -- and of his death had really never quite registered.\nYou know, it was -- it was like a page in a book, it wasn't -- I had sort of -- was\ndetached from it. But standing there at the grave and knowing that\u2019s where my\nfather was buried was incredibly -- an incredible experience and I -- I did cry. And\nwe -- we left Ebensee and Bad Ischl and stayed my mother\u2019s -- stayed -- I stayed\nwith my mother for a few days in a town called Bad Nauheim in Germany and\nthen from there went to Rotterdam and met up with the Madna family and the\nRavensbergan family from Rijnsburg and some other friends of my mother, close\nfriends of my mother from The Hague, and who saw us off on the Ryndam and we\nleft for the United States.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: What did you know about the United States? You were 17 years old. What did\nyou know about the United States?",
        "A: I had been -- I was scared of the United States, especially when we were in this\nspa at bel -- in -- in -- 1n -- in -- in Germany called Bad Nauheim. There was a\nwoman who sat at our table who was there from the United States and she told me\nthat I\u2019d better toughen up, that all the kids here were extremely rough and that I was\ngoing to have a very hard time. And so I was -- I was -- frankly, I was scared. I\ndidn\u2019t know what I was going to encounter. You know, I\u2019d certainly seen cowboy\nmovies also, and that\u2019s what I expected the United States to be like. And I -- it was\na very different experience, very positive when we arrived.",
        "Q: Di-Did you -- d-d -- were you upset that your mother wanted to move to the\nUnited States?",
        "A: No, because I knew that this situation in Brussels was really not tenable. At one\npoint I actually -- we had even planned on going to Canada. The reason we didn\u2019t\ngo to the United States earlier is because it took that many years to obtain a visa,\nbecause of the quota system. And so we have -- we had applied for a visa to go to\nCanada in about 1954 or so, but then there was a flood in Holland, and -- I may be\noff somewhat on my years, and all of a sudden we were told that the -- that I had --\nthat there was a visa for me to go to -- to th -- the United States opened the Dutch\nAugust 4, 2002\nquota basically, because of the floods. And so I got a visa and my mother assumed\nthat she had one too, and she didn\u2019t know about the visas being by national origin.\nSo she did not -- was not able to come t -- [indecipherable] to the United States.\nBut that\u2019s -- as a result of that, we dropped our pla -- we had dropped our plans to\ngo to Canada and -- so I was prepared for the change to come to the United States.\nI had also -- I'd gotten different warnings. I also -- the -- my -- my si -- teachers at\nthe yeshiva and the older, more senior students, you know, warned me, said that the\nUnited States was extremely materialistic and I shouldn\u2019t forget the things I had\nlearned over there, you know, that -- and that one of the -- the lessons that I should\ntake back from the war was that material objects were really not that important.\nThere were more important things in life. School over there was very, very much\ngeared towards the Mussar ethical movement and was very, very valuable. So I\nwas prepared for the worst in many ways when we came to the United States, but\ninstead, I think both of us really adapted quite well. We -- my mother purposely had\nbooked a trip on -- that was fairly long because she -- she looked on this as kind of a\n-- a vacation. So our -- our trip to the United States took about 10 days. The ship\nmade stops in Ireland and France, Halifax, Canada before finally arriving in -- in\nHoboken, New York. And in Hoboken we were met by someone from the HIAS,\nAugust 4, 2002\nMrs. Citrin. By f -- our first exposure to a real American woman who was super-\nAmerican.",
        "Q: Did you know any English?",
        "A: Very, very little. I had taken English as my second foreign language which --\nwhich was really bare bones, was twice a week for about two years, so it was very,\nvery little. But there was this -- this very swaggering woman, very, very different\nfrom -- yeah, the -- the very quiet European women we -- and that was -- that was\nintere -- and then we -- we took the taxi to -- to -- to Brooklyn and joined -- and\nstayed with the Vanderpool family, who had -- since they originally -- they 1-\ninitially had lived in Williamsburg when they came to the United States. Hela\nVanderpool had a job actually, in a matzo baking factory. And then finally, you\nknow, they -- they moved to a nicer part of Brooklyn. We moved in with them for a\nshort period and got our own apartment.",
        "Q: Did it mean anything to you to put -- to arrive in America, to walk onto\nAmerican soil? Did that have any special meaning?",
        "A: I very distinctly re -- remember seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time.\nYou know, we were having breakfast on the ship and there it was, and really -- it --\nit si -- it did symbolize a tremendous amount. The other thing that really struck us\nas -- as we got off -- as we were on the boat watching, you know, being processed\nAugust 4, 2002\non the boat, was they were -- the dockworkers were unloading things from the ship\nand that the dockworkers were wearing leather -- were wearing protective gloves.\nThat was one thing that really struck us. The second thing that struck us, that on this\nbig loading platform at one point, they brought -- they dropped a newspaper and\ncontainers of coffee for the workers. And this was very, very different from\nworking conditions in -- in Holland at the time. And that -- those two things, the\nnewspaper, especially, and the cups of coffee and the leather gloves, the protective\ngloves, somehow struck us as being very special and showing that -- you know, that\nthings were much, much better in the United States. The other -- very shortly after\nour arrival, we also -- we started looking for permanent places to live and -- which\nis quite an adventure. We ended up in some of the worst neighborhoods of -- of -- of\nBrooklyn before we finally found a place, but -- and my mother had to look for\nwork. And I remember visiting the offices. I think it was either the HIAS, or there\nwas another organization called New Americans, which was -- and this was on\nBeekman Place in -- in New York, not far from Wall Street. And I remember one\nof the first things we visited was -- was Trinity Church and -- and the graveyard,\nand how impressed we were to see this old graveyard next to Wall Street over these\n-- these skyscrapers. That was also a very, very positive impression. And we both\nfeel -- felt -- my mother, I know, felt liberated. She really is the one who wanted to\nAugust 4, 2002\nleave behind the memories of Europe. She found Europe extremely confining. The\nmemories were bad, but in addition to that, she -- she did not -- she did not like\nbeing referred to as the widow Munzer, which was how women were still regarded,\nsingle women, widowed women in -- in -- in Europe were still regarded at that\ntime. Whereas here in the United States she could get a job and make a living, and\nshe would just be like anybody else.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Alfred Munzer. This is tape number three, side B. And you\u2019ve\narrived in the United States, did you -- and where did you eventually live?",
        "A: We actually lived in an apartment that was almost next door to the Vanderpool\nfamily. There were some people who -- these were two family, two si -- houses and\nwe took an apartment next door to them. And we stayed there for several years and\nthen moved to an o -- to a larger apartment a little bit further away. My mother,\nalmost immediately got -- got work, went to work in the -- the ladies\u2019 garment\nbusiness, basically. She made -- she had a variety of jobs. One of them was making\nhats, all sorts of things, til she finally got as -- a job that she kept for a long period\nof time, which was working as a t -- at a tailor in a -- in a women\u2019s store. The\nAugust 4, 2002\nreason she took that particular job, which was on Williams Street, again, and Wall\nStreet, was because it was closed on Shabbas. And by then my mother really had\nbecome much more observant and she would go to shul every -- every Shabbas. So\nthat -- that became very important for her.",
        "Q: Considering what she had gone through during the war, how was her health?",
        "A: My mother was in very, very good health, actually. Had -- had no -- was never si\n-- never sick at all. Had no -- no major health -- no health problems that I know of at\nall.",
        "Q: And your health was good, too?",
        "A: Yeah, I had no -- no problems in spite of, you know, malnutrition. I\u2019m told that\nthere\u2019s some dental problems, probably from early, you know, development that\nmay be related to that. My mother was concerned about my health early on, but\nthere really weren't any -- any problems. After we came to the United States,\nstarted looking for a school for me and I enrolled actually at -- I -- we -- we\nexplored one of the more religious inst -- yeshiva, Yeshiva Torah Vodaath in -- in\n-- in Brooklyn. But that was in a -- in a -- in a very ver -- bad neighborhood and my\nmother wanted -- but by then I was beginning to think really of -- of eventually\ngoing to medical school. And so my mother really wanted me to go to a school that\nwas more progressive. That\u2019s why I went to Yeshiva University High School in\nAugust 4, 2002\nBrooklyn. And it was a -- that was a very -- it was a difficult move because I knew\n-- spoke very, very little English. And I must say that the school was not supportive.\nNo one at the school asked any questions about how I had survived, how my mother\nsurvived. It -- it\u2019s unfortunately left a sour taste in my -- in my mouth. The students\nwere very, very friendly and the students were very interested in my past. And I still\nhave an article that they wrote for the school newspaper, actually an interview about\nmy experiences in Europe. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- but the adults were just -- I -- I -- for\nwhatever reason, no one wants to talk about. The only person who really asked us\nabout our survival, how we had survived, it was very interesting, it was someone\nwho wasn\u2019t Jewish. It was when my mother went to open up a bank account at\nManufacturer\u2019s Trust. And when the -- the woman who read the application, she\ncalled over the bank manager and they were both in tears practically, when they\nfound out my father had died and how he had died and -- and such. That was -- but\nthat was unique. Most people -- there were some other people, obviously, who had\nbeen through similar experiences we talked to. We went to a small synagogue,\nRabbi Moshe Weiss, and he had lost much of his own family and certainly we were\nvery close with him and we talked with him. But other than that, certainly at\nYeshiva University High School there was no -- there was no talk about the\nHolocaust at all. And I -- I was asked to take every single Regent\u2019s exam for the\nAugust 4, 2002\nentire four years of high school in that one year because they were afraid really of --\nof giving me a diploma without doing that, so I did. But it -- I -- the unfortunate\nthing is that it\u2019s probably as a result of that experience that I did not go -- did not\nattend Yeshiva University. I was interviewed there and would have gone there, but\nended up going to Brooklyn College. And that\u2019s where I graduated from\neventually. And that was a very good experience. And the interesting thing is that\nover there there were the beginnings of talk. At least there were other foreign\nstudents and there was some interest. But I felt very much at home, felt very\ncomfortable there, made good friends and really blended in.",
        "Q: So you did not feel like an outsider?",
        "A: Definitely not, no. I -- o-or if I did, it was -- it was something positive. But I no -\n- definitely felt a part of the school.",
        "Q: And you obviously picked up English quickly.",
        "A: Very much so. I had a -- I did have a -- a very heavy accent, initially, because I -\n- and I had a very, very good speech teacher, Professor Dorothy Lawson. And she\nspent hours with me with a tape recorder, and I would listen to my voice and then\nshe would make corrections and she taught me the international phonetic alphabet,\nand that\u2019s how I learned English.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: And then you -- so you attended for four years to Brooklyn College, and then\nwhat?",
        "A: I attended Brooklyn College for four years, then applied to medical school. Did\nnot get in the first time, so I did a year of graduate studies at -- also still at\nBrooklyn College and then fi -- and then was admitted to -- to medical school and\nwent to the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center in\nBrooklyn. And after that, it\u2019s part of my internship, my internship and residency at\nState University, King\u2019s County Medical Center, then went on to the University\nof Rochester, then Johns Hopkins, and then finally did my military service in\nWashington, D.C. at Andrews Air Force base. And that\u2019s how I came to live in\nWashington.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And you always found it was easy to have friends, and a\nsocial life and so forth? You did not feel arre -- being a refugee, so to speak?",
        "A: No, I did -- I did not feel like any stranger, refugee or foreigner. I never really\nfound that an obstacle at all. I found it really a positive -- I tried to -- to use it as a\npositive experience. You know, certainly all of the different exposures that I had to\ndifferent people, different cultures, different religions, I -- I tie th -- try to keep that\nbasically as part of me. And I think to this day it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s something that has -- has\nhelped me.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: When did you become a citizen?",
        "A: We became citizens in 1962, really the first up -- no, 63, five years, I think. The\nfirst opportunity that we had, basically, we became citizens. Unfortunately, that was\nnot a good experience. [indecipherable] everybody has wonderful experiences, but\nwe were being interviewed -- we were interviewed by someone who basically told\nus that -- said, you know, remember in this country you don\u2019t do what you want,\nyou do as you are told. This country is run like the army. And that -- that was pa --\nhorrible, you know, and the man tried to trick me in -- in the citizenship questions.\nHe threw my -- my mother\u2019s green card and mine on the floor. The positive thing\nthat came out of that is that I wrote a letter of complaint to the Immigration\nNaturalization Service, which initially -- and to the Justice Department, which at\nthat time was headed by Bobby Kennedy. I did not get a reply, but then wrote to\nEmmanuel Seller, who was my congressman in Brooklyn and who was head of\nthe Judiciary Committee and I got immediate action, they actually -- there was a\nhearing held in -- in Brooklyn. And I was confronted -- and the man was forced to\napologize. And I think h-he retired shortly after that. So it -- it did show the\nnegative and the positive, you know, the fact that you can stand up and -- for your\nrights.",
        "Q: Did he give a reason at the hearing why he treated you that way?\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Absolutely not. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s interesting because the -- the hearing\nexaminer told me that this man had never even served in the army, and why he was\nmaking the reference to the army was bizarre, and he didn\u2019t -- he said he didn\u2019t\nknow whether the man was having a bad day, or what it was, but obviously the\nbehavior was -- was totally -- was inappropriate.",
        "Q: So then you s -- you said you -- you worked at Andrew\u2019s Air Force base and\nyou stayed in Washington since then. And what -- and what do you do now? Or\nwhat did you do after Andrew\u2019s Air Force base, professionally?",
        "A: Well, after Andrew\u2019s Air Force base -- well, I ni -- I had become -- I was a lung\nspecialist by then and I looked for practice opportunities in the Washington area\nand decided to join an associate at Washington Adventist Hospital and that\u2019s where\nI have been in practice since then.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And your family situation?",
        "A: Well, I -- I have a partner, Joel Wind and we\u2019ve known each other for 21 years\nand we\u2019ve lived together here for about 11 years. And I\u2019m very, very close to his\nfamily, another survivor family. Joel\u2019s father is a rabbi and came to the United\nStates in 1938 from Lvov, and -- on a scholarship to the Jewish Theological\nSeminary. Joel has -- had an aunt who actually was one of the people who lived in\nAugust 4, 2002\nthe sewers of Lvov. So there are a lot of connections, family connections and I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m very, very close to Joel\u2019s family and we are one family.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Now let\u2019s talk a little bit about some of your general thoughts. Though,\nbefore we do that, you kept up your relationships with the mand -- Madnas I\nassume, all through -- once you got to the United States?",
        "A: A-After we came to the United States, I did keep up my relationship with the\nMadnas. For many years it was just writing and sometimes, you know, there would\nbe -- months would go by before I would write, but we always stayed in touch. I did\nnot go back for a visit to Holland until I think in 1973, 15 years after we had been\nhere is when I -- when I went back on a visit and spent a lot of time -- primarily\nwent back to visit the Madnas, basically. And Papa Madna was as protective of me\nas he had ever been. I had never been to -- to Amsterdam, actually. My mother had\nalways said negative things about Amsterdam, she sa -- basically she said my\nfather did not like Amsterdam, it was too noisy and that\u2019s why he lived -- they\nlived in -- in The Hague. And so, as a result of that, I had never gone to\nAmsterdam. And I decided that on this trip I was going to go to Amsterdam and\nPapa Madna again, almost completely dissuaded me from going altogether, then\nscared me so much that I went there for one day and then came right back t-to him.\nAnd -- but that\u2019s -- that still 1s the -- the -- the influence. You -- you asked earlier\nAugust 4, 2002\nabout whether my mother was -- was protective. I have the sense -- I had the sense\nreally that 1-in many ways he was more protective of me than she was. That was\nvery, very special. And he -- he had remarried in 1947, and I was very, very close\nwith this second wife. And they had three children, Vonny, Tol\u00e9 and Matipah. And\nI was very, very close with all three of them, and remain close with them to this\nday. Vonny Madna and his wife Annika have been here to visit, and just a few\nweeks ago, their son Rodewick and his girlfriend came over here for a visit. And so\nthe -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re passing on the -- the accomplishments or -- of his -- of his\ngrandfather, or -- of Tol\u00e9 Madna now to the next generation. And I think that\u2019s\nwhat the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum is all about in a way. We had a -- a\nwondert -- we had -- we visited the museum together and the importance of a\nmuseum and of a memorial suddenly hit me. Prior to that I thought that people\ncould get information from books, but there is something very special about a\nmemorial, in terms of the passage from one generation to the next.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. When you went back t -- at Papa Madna\u2019s funeral, did you feel like\nyou were losing a father?",
        "A: What do yo -- yes, I think when he f -- when he finally -- I -- you know, he was -\n- even though we were far removed geographically, he really remained very much a\npart of my life to the very end, and -- and certainly, you know, his -- his death was -\nAugust 4, 2002\n- was a big loss for me. Fortunately he lived to a -- a ripe, old age, and fortunately,\nyou know, we were able, Joel and I were -- were able to spend time with him. It\nwas very important for me for Joel to get to know him, and we made several trips\ntogether where we saw the Madnas. I made that initial trip by myself in 1973, but\nthen in 1985 Joel and I were in Holland together and visited the Madnas, all of\nthem, and it was a -- a very, very good visit. And then Joel and I were back again\njust before Tol\u00e9 Madna died. And that too, was very, very special visit.",
        "Q: Did you speak at his funeral?",
        "A: No, Rob Madna is the one who spoke at the funeral, I did not. But Rob Madna\n-- I can\u2019t remember ma -- whether I did or not.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through such terrible difficulties and such\nterrible losses and other people living, let\u2019s say in the United States, did not?",
        "A: You know, there were times when I really miss not knowing, not having had,\nyou know, my sisters. Not having nephews, nieces and nephews and feeling lonely\nat times. I certainly have missed my father. The interesting thing 1s that I really have\nnever, you know, you -- you mentioned the word angry, and I don\u2019t think that\ndescribes it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever really felt anger. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very interesting.\nWhen Joel and I went to Austria, for example, he was much angrier than I was. I\nwas able to speak and converse with people without, you know, difficulty. We had\nAugust 4, 2002\none very special experience there. We were staying again in the town, the same\ntown where I stayed with my mother, Bad Ischl, and we had ma -- made\nreservations 1n a -- in an inn, and the woman who was the innkeeper, when we\narrived told us that she had made a mistake. She said, you know, you\u2019re going to\nhave to change rooms tomorrow morning because of some mistake I\u2019ve made in the\nreservations. And I told her that would be very difficult because we were going to\ntake a train first thing in the morning to visit my father\u2019s grave in Ebensee. And the\nwoman told me that her family -- she burst out in tears and she says, you know, my\nfamily is from Ebensee and I am so ashamed. And we hugged, and that -- that was\ntruly an incredible experience. But Joel would not -- would barely look out the train\nwindow. He -- he could not bring himself to say anything positive about Austria,\nand couldn\u2019t wait to get away. That\u2019s one reason we did not -- this was around my -\n- the time of my father\u2019s Yahrzeit and so we visited Ebensee and then from there,\ninstead of going to Vienna, we went to Prague and said Kaddish in the Altneu\nshul.",
        "Q: Do you feel you had a childhood, or you never did?",
        "A: Well, it was a very different childhood probably, but I -- I definitely, you know,\ndefinitely had the childhood. I had a lot of fun. I learned a lot. M -- you know. I was\ntaken care of by many different people and I was fortunate, I think, in having a read\nAugust 4, 2002\nchildhood, a good childhood, and learning many different things. And I -- I think I -\n- because of the unusual nature of my childhood, I had had many opportunities that\nother kids probably did not have. So I was able to learn several languages and be\nexposed to many different cultures.",
        "Q: Are there any sights today or sounds or smells that kind of trigger memories\nfrom your early years?",
        "A: Well, when we went back to Holland and crossed the border, I smelled the\ncoffee. And there was something very special about the smell of Dutch coffee, and\nthat -- that was very, very distinct. And of course, you know, Indonesian cooking\nstill ha -- is a -- something very special. And I -- I do enjoy, you know, going back\nto Holland and the sights of Holland. And I do enjoy going back to visit The\nHague, the places where I grew up. The house at van Kinsbergenstraat, number\n40 doesn\u2019t exist any more, but other places are still there. Where my father had his\nstore, that\u2019s still there. I\u2019ve taken Joel there on a visit. So -- the -- the one place that\n-- that gave me some difficulty was the Anne Frank house, actually. It\u2019s\ninteresting, you know, you mention the word anger, maybe there I did feel some\nanger. And the first time I went there was with my foster sister, with Davy and both\nof us had to leave. She more so than I did. For her it just brought back too many\nmemories and she -- she really was very upset, very angry. In my case, it -- it was\nAugust 4, 2002\njust wanting to shout out, you know, there were other people like Anne Frank, like\nmyself, you know? And --",
        "Q: Do you feel very Dutch, or very American?",
        "A: I think I feel very American. You know, I think the Dutch has sort of faded,\nalthough, you know, I -- I -- I still pride myself on being able to read Dutch -- Dutch\nnewspapers and being able to converse in Dutch, but I -- I don\u2019t really feel -- and\nmy mother did not have any -- any great affinity to Holland after the war. My\nmother, I think, really understood also, that there was a large Nazi presence in\nHolland itself, and that -- that Holland really never faced up to that. Apparently\nthat has changed and now there is -- there is -- 1t\u2019s been -- there\u2019s mo-more talk\nabout the Dutch Nazi party. It\u2019s one of the things that even in the Holocaust\nMemorial Museum doesn\u2019t get enough emphasis is -- 1s the size of the Dutch Nazi\nparty. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of between the lines, when you look at the -- the percentage of\npeople who lost -- or Jews who lost their lives, the greatest percentage was in\nHolland. But then there\u2019s nothing said about it and why that was, and part of the\nreason was that Holland had a very large Nazi party which collaborated with the\nGermans. So we -- we know about the Vichy regime in France, but we don\u2019t know\nenough about the Nazi collaborators in Holland.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Mm-hm. As you\u2019ve gotten older, do you think more of your wartime experience\nthan European experience?",
        "A: I think it -- it\u2019s become more important for me to -- to really preserve the\nmemory of -- of Holland and of the story of my family. And I\u2019m -- I\u2019m very, very\nglad I\u2019ve had the opportunity to sit down with my mother and go through all the\nnames of all the concentration camps that she was in and sit down with a map with\nher, and -- and have a presentation p -- on that. That -- that -- that was very, very\nimportant. Emotionally it\u2019s very hard to tell. You know, at times I have dreams\nabout it that obviously come from there, and -- but it\u2019s not a part of my -- my\neveryday life. I also -- sometimes I\u2019m concerned that there are people who may\nresent talk about the Holocaust, and the experiences. So it\u2019s -- there\u2019s some --\nthere\u2019s a little bit of caution there.",
        "Q: Are you talking about non-Jews?",
        "A: No, more in the Jewish community, I think. There is -- there is some feeling, I\nthink that enough is enough. At times I have -- I have a sense of that.",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable around people who were born in Europe and have\nwartime experiences than others who grew up in the United States?",
        "A: Not really. No, I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s really m-most of my friends now and most of\nthe friends we have are p -- are people who grew up in the United States. But you\nAugust 4, 2002\nknow even when you begin to talk to people, you -- you realize that -- how common\nthe experience really is, and I\u2019m -- people may have been born here, but their\nparents may be from Europe. I had a ni -- a fascinating experience very recently. I -\n- I was speaking to a young man at Congregation Bet Mishpachah and he -- his\nname is -- his last name is Flatow, Warren Flatow. I told him, I said, you know,\nFlatow is not a very common name, and I worked with a gentleman many, many\nyears ago who was a -- was from Germany, a German refugee and whose last name\nwas Flatow, Anzd Flatow, and he said -- and he worked as a translator and I\nworked in the same translation bureau in -- in New York while I was in college.\nAnd he -- he said, gee, you know, he has a grandfather the same name, but his\ngrandfather was a lawyer and to his knowledge never worked in the translation\nbureau. Then he asked his father and it turned out to be the same Anzd Flatow. And\nwe worked together at the Lawyers and Merchants Translation Bureau in New\nYork. And he was, you know, had escaped from Germany in 1944 and was a\nlawyer. Obviously couldn\u2019t do any work as a lawyer in the United States, so he\ntook this job as a translator. So the -- the connections are many, once you begin\ntalking.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Did you go into medicine -- though I know you said you -- you thought about it\nearly on, but do you think you went into this helping, giving profession because of\nwhat you experienced?",
        "A: Pro -- probably. It probably was one of the factors, you know. Certainly my\nmother always impressed on me that I was there to serve human kind. And I don\u2019t\nwant to be overly dramatic about it, but that goes all the way back to -- to her\nreading the story of -- the biblical story of --",

        "A: Oh Hannah, right, the biblical story of Hannah, and -- and Hannah\u2019s\npromising to -- to -- you know, to have her son, you know, be in -- of service to\nGod. And that story really stuck to me. My mother said, you know, that I too, that\u2019s\nthe promise that she made to God. And when times were bad, when I -- I would\ngive her trouble or something like that, she would repeat that story. My mother\nnever hit me. She never spanked me, but she certainly used every psychological\nmeans, and that was one of them, and you know, and so becoming a physician --\nshe wanted me to be a rabbi, she didn't want me to be a physician, actually.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nAugust 4, 2002\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is the continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Alfred Munzer. This is tape number four, side A, and you were\ntalking about your relationship with your mother and how she was -- she wanted\nyou to be a rabbi and not a doctor.",
        "A: Sh-She felt that I was more suited -- that I was really suited to becoming a rabbi.\nShe -- she felt that I would not do well in -- in hav -- in business, for example. She\njust -- she thought that I was too, quote, honest, and that -- you know, that that -- so\nshe wanted me to be -- to be -- she also thought that that would be a natural way to\nacquire a family, in a sense. But she was basically, as to a large extent on -- on the\nrespect that rabbis have in -- in Europe, especially. When we came to the United\nStates she realized that -- that rabbis do not necessarily have it all that easy here,\nand that congregations can be very difficult. So anyway, but -- but -- I had really\nnever considered that that much. It was a -- was a brief consideration. The oth -- the\nother place where that came from, being a rabbi was, strangely enough, the family\nthat we used to visit in -- in Rijnsburg, in Holland and who would take me to\nchurch and then I would repeat the sermons and one of the women there would say\noh, he\u2019s going to become a preacher and then the other one would say, no, he\u2019s\ngoing to become a rabbi. And so that was -- that was one of the early things. But it\nAugust 4, 2002\nwas -- those were the two professions that I really considered seriously. But from --\nfrom my standpoint it was really all -- I -- I can\u2019t remember. Maybe it was when I\nwas really sick as a child and had the ruptured appendix. That\u2019s, I think, when I\nreally made up my mind that I was going to become a physician. But my\nexperiences of -- of -- certainly of having had my life given to me in a -- in a very\ndirect sense by -- by the Madna family, I would say probably it has had a major\nimpact, not just on becoming a physician but also volunteering my time. When I\npicked a specialty it was one where I -- I knew I could have a wider -- I wanted one\nwhere I could have a wider impact. And so I chose lung disease because lung\ndisease is so much related to -- to an -- the environment, it\u2019s related to smoking and\nI became very active in the American Lung Association and eventually served as --\nas president of the American Lung Association, nationally, and also received their\nWill Ross medal a few years ago, which 1s their highest volunteer honor. So at --\nit\u2019s -- that certainly -- and it, interestingly enough, at that ceremony the story, the\nMadna story was told very, very prominently and to -- to an audience of thousands\nof people. And the Madnas received a standing ovation. They weren\u2019t there, but\nyou know, just -- it was -- 1t was extremely moving. So my past, my experiences\ncertainly have been a very important part of forming my life and of determining the\nkind of person I am. And I guess it\u2019s possible for that, depending on the\nAugust 4, 2002\nexperiences, to be positive or negative and I\u2019m very fortunate that in my case, it was\nvery positive.",
        "Q: In talking about the Madnas, did you -- have you come to any conclusion why\nMr. Madna really risked his life for you?",
        "A: I -- I really haven\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very, very interesting. To me, this\nseemed like the most natural thing to do. You know, recently at -- when I was at\nAdas Israel at a service, it was a -- a young girl who had a Bat Mitzvah who came\nhere from Russia, and th-the rabbi mentioned all the languages she spoke and all\nthe things she had done and then he had asked her, you know, how did this happen,\nhow -- how is this possible? And she said, it\u2019s normal. And those words really stuck\nbecause that\u2019s -- that\u2019s probably what describes the way I look on -- on what the\nMadnas did. To me there was nothing unusual about it. That may be terrible, but\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s really -- 1t\u2019s really true because I -- I was so much a part of their family.\nThey never made a big deal about it. My mother did, she expressed, certainly, her\ngratitude, especially to Mima. To her Mima was really the important person. But\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- so | -- I -- 1t took me a long time to -- to give them the recognition they\ndeserved as a result of that, again, because it was just part of my everyday life, they\nwere -- you know, they were never out of my life. I couldn\u2019t -- I never really\ndistanced myself to -- to be able to say this was something incredible they did.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: But when you were an adult, did you ever ask him why he risked -- you know,\ntook such terrible risks?",
        "A: No, I never did. I really -- I -- I -- I just -- you know, it would have been like a\nchild asking a parent why did you have me. You know, it -- it really -- it -- it was\nvery strange, may seem very strange, but it really -- it never occurred to me. It --\nyou know, he knew that I loved him dearly, you know, and --",
        "Q: I -- I -- I really meant the initial --",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: -- acceptance that -- not -- not you particularly --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but accepting a child and putting --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- his life in danger.",
        "A: No, no, no, I know, no, no, no. I -- I just -- I really don\u2019t know. The only thing\nthat I -- that I -- that I\u2019ve heard was that the plan originally was that this was\nsupposed to be an intermediate step. I\u2019m not sure that this was a conscious decision\non his part. It is -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s very possible that this was more something that was\nthrust into him -- at him, and I don\u2019t -- you know, at that point he really didn\u2019t have\nany control over. I think one of the factors really was -- was Mima. Papa Madna\nAugust 4, 2002\nwas ready also to adopt me if my mother had not come back. And I did, you know,\nfind that out. He did tell me that. He -- he also told me that he had felt very warmly\ntowards my father, and that -- you know, th-that -- but again, nothing specific as to\nwhy he took the risk.",
        "Q: So he knew your father? You said that she had -- his first wife had lived across\nthe street, but -- but Papa Madna had known your father also?",
        "A: Yes, and one of the things that he -- he showed me after the war was a suit that\nmy father had made for him. So yes, they knew each other.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. What about your religious feelings? Are -- are you affiliated,\nJewishly?",
        "A: Yes, Iam. I\u2019m not as religious as I was when I was at the yeshiva in Aix-les-\nBains, but I certainly, you know, I -- I certainly am -- I\u2019m very much involved. I\u2019m\ninvolved in three different synagogues. Maybe it\u2019s -- maybe it\u2019s that -- maybe that\u2019s\nwhere the -- the -- the ambivalence or the -- the division between different religions\nis still coming to [indecipherable] I can\u2019t make up my mind which one. No, but\nI\u2019m very involved at -- at B\u2019nai Israel. That\u2019s where my mother was a member for\nmany years and so I\u2019ve maintained a -- a strong connection with -- with B\u2019nai\nIsrael. It also turns out that there 1s a -- a family relationship through -- through\nJoel and Rabbi Schnitzer there. I became involved at Adas Israel when I was\nAugust 4, 2002\nsaying Kaddish for my mother, and -- because it was in the neighborhood. And\nthen of course, through the ceremony honoring the Madnas at Adas Israel, I\u2019ve\nbecome very much a part of that congregation and feel very, very warmly. And then\nlast but not least, I\u2019ve been a member of Bet Mishpachah for -- for many years and\non a fairly regular basis do have a chance to -- to write a [indecipherable] sermon,\nthe high holidays or sometimes during the year. So I\u2019ve been -- I\u2019ve been very much\ninvolved in -- in religious things, and what I learned certainly at the yeshiva in\nterms of ethics especially, in Jewish ethics 1s -- is something that really still guides\nme -- I hope guides me and is something that I still try to convey to others as being\nvery important.",
        "Q: What are your feelings about Germany or Germans?",
        "A: I have had some very close German friends, whose -- I had one German friends\nwhose -- one whose parents I think it was, part of his family were Nazis. We -- we -\n- we didn't talk about it a great deal, but it was, I think, part of -- almost the reason\nfor our sh -- our fr -- our friendship, on both sides. It was very important. And I -- I\nreal -- as I -- I have ha -- I-I\u2019ve no great discomfort around German being spoken or\n-- or Germany. | am baffled by -- by Germany. In 1973 when I went back to\nHolland to visit the Madnas [ also -- I was still in the air force at the time and I\ntook a flight into -- in and out of Frankfurt, and that was the first time that I had\n100August 4, 2002\nreally, except for going to bat -- being in Bad Nauheim with my mother, that I\nspent time in -- in -- in Germany. And I had spent also a little time at that time, in\nParis, and did not have very pleasant experiences as a tourist in Paris. In\nGermany, for the one night that I was there actually, it was in a very nice hotel,\nthey were very honest, it was very civilized. You know, turned on the radio and it\nwas opera and there was -- there was beautiful music. And I became -- I\u2019ve become\n-- became more and more baffled. And to this day I -- I cannot understand how\nNazism arose. I can -- I can do it on an intellectual level -- yeah, I can certainly read\nabout it and I -- I know what happened, but it\u2019s beyond me as to why Nazism took\nroot to the extent it did in Germany. And what frightens me about it is -- what I\nthink is if it happened there, it can happen anywhere. I really -- because I don\u2019t\nthink -- I cannot tell if there is anything different about the German character from\nany other country.",
        "Q: Do -- do you receive reparations, or did your mother?",
        "A: I did for a brief period of time until my 18\" birthday and I\u2019m s -- my mother did\nget reparations to the very end, and s -- she encouraged other people also to -- to\napply for reparations. She had many friends who re -- who -- who refused, but in\nher case she felt that this -- she -- this was something she was owed. And so she did\nnot hesitate.\n101August 4, 2002",
        "Q: Obviously everyone has a close connection with a parent, a mother, but when\nyou lost her, because of your special story, was that even doubly painful?",
        "A: It was, because you know, I -- I -- I -- you know, it\u2019s -- I was more afraid before\nit happened, before she died. My mother, the last few years had fairly severe,\nprogressive dementia. So I felt, you know, I was becoming -- but nonetheless, you\nknow, that -- that\u2019s -- the touch, the warmth of being with her was very, very\nimportant. And you know, s -- even the number was very, very impor -- she didn\u2019t\nlike to look at it, but for me, you know, it brought back a lot of memories. And --\nand -- and I -- it was totally amazing to me how my -- what my mother\u2019s attitude\nwas towards life after the war. I -- I -- to this day cannot understand that. My\nmother could speak with joy about her childhood in Poland, in Rymanow. Talking\nabout, you know, the policemen called bambula and -- and all of the places where,\nyou know, they -- the kids would go out to play and then -- and I have a very, very\nvivid picture, actually, of the town. She could talk to me about, you know,\nexperiences in the concentration camps when she put on plays with other prisoners\nand sh -- and portraying Hitler. And then after the war, beginning -- starting a life\nover again, I would hear her cry at night at times, certainly, in the first few years.\nShe would be very -- sometimes she would accidentally refer to me by my father\u2019s\nname and that was a very frightening thing. But somehow, you know, she was\n102August 4, 2002\nalways very cheerful. You know, when I was little and she had her store, after she\nclosed the store we would take very, very long walks to the park and she would race\nme to the park. She took me to the theater. You know, every Su-Sunday there was\nalways something. We either went to a museum, we went to -- to a play, we went to\n-- J-] -- I remember the very first time I went to a -- a -- a Jewish dance company. I\nwas probably seven years old or so, and I -- I still remember it to this day because I\nremember putting on a performance in the store window afterwards. It\u2019s really --\nher -- her introduction of me to the theater. And then she picked up painting again.\nSomehow, being able to enjoy life and to continue to really enjoy life 1s -- is just --\nwithout f -- ever forgetting what happened, my sisters or my father, 1s -- 1s beyond\nme. I don\u2019t know where -- where that strength came from. And I was a very f -- I\nfeel very glad to have had my mother for so many years.",
        "Q: Politically, do you -- are -- d -- are -- are you -- is your political inclination\ninfluenced by your war experience?",
        "A: I tend to the liberal side, I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s really related, except that\npeople have responsibility for each other. That is -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s an important part\nof -- of certainly my outlook, politically. And -- but other than that I don\u2019t think it\nhas had a direct bearing. I certainly do not consider myself, you know, a -- a far\nright, or a -- no, not at all, I think.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "Q: Has it affected your feelings about Israel?",
        "A: Certainly I think it has -- it has made Israel all the more important to me. I\nrealize the role of Israel really as a refu -- as an ultimate refuge is very, very\nimportant. At the same time I\u2019ve also come to appreciate recently, more recent -- in\nrecent years, the importance of the United States as a place of refuge. And I really\ndo feel very, very positive about the United States. I think the -- the ability to\naccommodate the diversity of beliefs of peoples. You know, we may have many\nproblems and there may be anti-Semitism here and there may be f -- there may have\nbeen oppression of -- of African Americans, Latinos, and negative things said. But\nin the end, I think, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of positive in the United States.\nAnd I feel very good about being here and being an American. Hadn\u2019t really\nthought about that very much, but I do.",
        "Q: You had mentioned that the Madna\u2019s story got recognition when you got your\naward. Can you just tell a little bit about any other recognition that the Madnas\nhave received, the Madna family.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m told that the Madna family was recognized within Holland, actually.\nThere was a ceremony held by -- by the queen. I don\u2019t know an -- too many details\nabout that. But I\u2019ve also submitted the family history to Yad Vashem and hopefully\nin the near future, they will also be honored at Yad Vashem.\n104August 4, 2002",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And then they were honored at your synagogue.",
        "A: At Adas -- yeah, at Adas Israel we had a wonderful ceremony in the garden.\nThere is a Garden of the Righteous at Adas Israel, where every year a -- a righteous\nfamily that was responsible for saving Jews is honored. And this year the Madna\nfamily was honored, and that was an incredible experience for me. Not just the\nimmediate ceremony, which was beautiful, but because it gave me a chance to\nspeak to -- altogether I figured out there were close to a thousand schoolchildren.\nAll the schoolchildren at Adas Israel, plus all the s-schoolchildren at the Jewish\nDay School heard the Madna\u2019s story with slides, with pictures. And many of the s -\n- children wrote letters to the Madna family and I think that -- that was incredibly\nexper -- an incredible experience, very, very positive for me, and -- and -- and for\nma -- for Rob Madna and I think the rest of the family as well. I also, again realize\nthe importance of a monument, as when I came there to visit with one of the ma --\nrecently with the Madna grand -- one of the Madna grandchildren and they took\ntremend -- he took tremendous pride in seeing the name inscribed, the Madna\nfamily. And we took a nice photograph there and then after that, we went to visit the\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and I -- | -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the next generation now\ncoming up. We talk about the Jewish next generation needing to keep the Holocaust\nin mind and not to forget the Holocaust, but I think it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s even more important\n105August 4, 2002\nthat the next generation of the heroes also, that they are remembered for generations\nto come.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a wonderful note to end on. So thank you very much for doing the\ninterview.",

        "Answer: My full name is Alfred Munzer and that\u2019s spelled M-u-n-z-e-r. The name\nhas undergone some changes, so when I was born it was actually Minzer, M-i-n-z-\ne-r, because of a slight spelling error that had been made in my father\u2019s birth\ncertificate. Someone forgot the upstroke on the -- on the U actually, which had a\nlittle umlaut on it. And officially also, when we came to the United States the name\nwas changed back to Munzer, M-u-e-n-z-e-r. So we have all three spellings, but\ncommonly I use M-u-n-z-e-r.",

        "A: My father\u2019s name was Simcha or Siegfried Munzer, or Minzer. And he was\nborn in a town in Galicia called Kanczuga. And he was born in 1904. My mother\nAugust 4, 2002\nwas born in a town in the same general area, called Rymanow, and she was born\nMay 20\", we th -- 1905 officially, but it could have been, it probably was more\nlikely 1907.",
        "A: My father came to the Netherlands in the late 20\u2019s, and my mother came to the\nNetherlands in 1932. And my father came there to -- to start a -- a business,\nobviously. Conditions for Jews in Poland were not ideal. He came from a large\nfamily of tailors and he decided to start his own tailoring business in The Hague.\nAnd then my mother joined him there about four years later. She was also -- they\nwere actually cousins, so they shared the same last name. And she initially left\nRymanow in the impr -- the end of the 20\u2019s probably, maybe beginning 30\u2019s and\nwent to Berlin to join a sister and a brother who were -- already lived in Berlin.\nAnd she worked in their tailoring business, and then came to join my father, and\nthey were married in the Netherlands in 1930 --",
        "A: -- Two. 1932.",
        "A: Right, December 16\", 1932.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: They -- I had -- they had two children before I was born. My oldest sister Eva\nwas born in 1936, and my younger sister Leana was born in 1938 and then I\nfollowed in 1941.",
        "A: They both came from very re-religious backgrounds, very typical eastern\nEuropean, but they were also part of the -- the enlightenment, if you will, and so\nthey -- they experimented, when they came to Holland. And some of their closest\nfriends in Holland were actually not Jewish. They -- they observed, you know, the\nJewish holidays, certainly, but they -- they did make a break with the very rigid, and\nwhat they considered, I think, constraining and confining religion of their bankr --\nbackground in Poland.",
        "A: I\u2019m not entirely sure, my -- they -- they both, I think, had a high school\neducation, essentially. Neither one of them went to the university. And to a large\nextent also were self educated. My mother read a tremendous amount, was a\nvoracious reader throughout her life. And my father was also a fairly educated man,\napparently very interested in world affairs.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: In the Netherlands there was -- my father had a brother by the name of Emil,\nEmil Munzer. And I think that that\u2019s -- that\u2019s really an -- all we had in Holland.\nThere were some close friends. There was another Emil, an Emil Landau who I\nsubsequently met because he happened -- he lived in the United States and you\nknow, he happened to -- to marry, actually, someone who became a part of our life\nmuch, much later on. And so we became very close friends with him. But he was\nvery close with -- with both my father and with my Uncle Emil.",
        "A: My uncle --",
        "A: Emil Landau was not a blood bra -- blood relative. The only blood relatives that\nI know of in Holland was my Uncle Emil, my father\u2019s side. All of the others were\neither -- either remained in Poland or Czechoslovakia, whatever. The location of --\nof the towns actually was changed quite frequently throughout history. And the\n[indecipherable] some of them were in Berlin.",
        "A: On my mother\u2019s side, as far as I know, there were no relatives in Holland.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Certainly the -- you know, she did tell me about the -- the -- the -- the gradual\ntightening of the screws after the invasion of Holland by the Germans.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, May 1940 and the confiscation of -- of Jewish property, the banning\nof Jews from -- from various positions in the arts, or in -- in -- 1n business. Just a\nvery -- I think actually the first thing that happened was the banning of shechitah,\nritual slaughter and then just things got tighter and tighter. And I think they try --\nmy -- my perception is that they really tried to go on with their lives as -- as\nnormally as possible in Holland, and I\u2019m not sure how directly threatened they felt\nin Holland, actually. My feeling is that for a long time they somehow felt safe. As\nfar as I know, my father never made any attempt to -- to emigrate, for example, to\nthe United States or anywhere else. I think they -- they -- they really felt very\nsecure in Holland.",
        "A: Certainly by the time my mother became pregnant with me, conditions in\nHolland had really deteriorated a great deal. By then the -- the occupation was in\nfull swing, and this was an unplanned pregnancy. And my mother was advised in\nAugust 4, 2002\nvery strong terms by her obstetrician to have an abortion. He told her that it would\nbe immoral to -- to bring another Jewish child into the world. And my mother, this\nis one of the times when she did turn to the Bible, and she read the story of\nHannah, who desperately wanted to have a child, and it was in reading that story,\nmy mother told me, that she decided that she could not possibly have an abortion.\nAs aresult of that, her obstetrician refa -- refused to have anything further to do\nwith her, and so I was -- I was born not in a hospital, but I was born at home\nactually, with th -- with the help of -- of a nurse, rather than attended by an\nobstetrician. And I was born actually one month prematurely, November, as I said,\nNovember 23\", 1941. And this led to another dilemma at the time, actually, and\nthat\u2019s whether to have a -- a bris or a circumcision. Again my -- my parents friends\nadvised very strongly against it because that would identify me as being Jewish and\nthen the pediatrician who examined me after my birth came out and told my father\nthat I -- that I would need a circumcision, that there was a medical need for it, and\nmy father at that point of course made the decision that we would have a regular\nbris. And I have some wonderful photographs of -- of that bris. They\u2019re very\nremarkable photographs, they\u2019re very, very tiny, they\u2019re only about one by one and\na half inch in size, but my mother was to keep them hidden on her body for the year\n-- subsequent years when she was in the concentration camps.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Well the next development, I -- I was born, as I said, in November, and by the\nfollowing May ts -- is when it became apparent that the family would have to go\ninto hiding. That\u2019s when Jews began -- were deported openly in Holland and the --\nthe first person who was actually called up by the -- by the Germans was my father,\nto -- to go to a so-called work camp. What he initially did was he -- he scheduled a\nhernia operation, which he had postponed previously, went into the hospital, had the\noperation and that delayed his -- his going to the concentration camps for awhile.\nAnd then the next thing that happened was that he had a mock suicide attempt,\nwhich gained him admission, like many other Jews apparently, to a psychiatric ho-\nhospital near The Hague, called The Remarkkliniek. And that\u2019s -- so he entered\nthere, basically under the pretext of being a patient. My mother, in the meantime,\nbegan to look for hiding places for my sisters and for myself. The f -- my father --\nmy parents decided that we should not go be hidden together, but that we should --\nshould hide in -- in different places, so that if -- if one person were killed or found\nout, at least someone would survive, one person in the family would survive or the\nothers would survive. My sisters were placed -- we have very close friends among\nour neighbors. The Van Luhrmann sisters, they were two sisters, Jo, J-o and Ko,\nK-o were their first names, Jo and Ko Van Luhrmann. They were very, very close\nAugust 4, 2002\nto us, very religious Catholic and they were instrumental in several things. First\nthey -- they had my sisters -- facilitated the enrollment of my sisters in a Catholic\nschool, and that was sort of the first attempt, really, at hiding their identity. And\nthen through their church in The Hague, a church which I have visited since then,\non the street called Alonstraat, and through the intervention also of two priests, a\nfather by the name of -- one father was Schulling, S-c-h-u-I-l-i-n-g, and I right now\ncan\u2019t remember the name of the other one, but anyway, these two priests were\ninstrumental in finding a Catholic family that was willing to take my sisters. The\nwoman in that family was also very religious, very devout Catholic. She had had a\nvision telling her -- where the Virgin Mary told her to take in Jewish children. And\nth-that\u2019s what led to my sisters being placed with this woman. Subsequently, my\nmother asked a neighbor across the way from us, where we lived, to -- to take me\nin. And th-the plan, apparently was for me to place -- be placed with her, and then\neventually to be transferred to a safer place somewhere in the Dutch countryside,\nwhere most Jewish children apparently were hidden.",
        "A: Sure. It was 100 Zoutmanstraat in The Hague, and I don\u2019t recall exactly, but\nthey lived on the same street, on Zoutmanstraat, right across the street, actually.\nAugust 4, 2002\nHer name was Annie Madna and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the woman I was -- I was placed\nwith.",
        "A: They were very -- they were close neighbors. She was divorced from her\nhusband, Tol\u00e9 Madna, who was of Indonesian background. She herself was Dutch.\nAnd they had had -- they had tw -- three children, and the three children really were\napparently in and out of my mother\u2019s house all the time. It was a very, very close\nrelationship. They also played with my two sisters and knew them very well. So it\nwas -- it was a logical thing for me, you know, to be placed with her initially,\ncertainly. That probably was in September 1941, because I -- I think I was nine\nmonths old at the time when I was placed with Annie. And at that point my mother\nsold most of our furniture and belongings and placed a lot of 1tems 1n hiding with\nour neighbors, basically emptied the house and she too, she joined my father in -- in\nhiding at the same psychiatric clinic, the Remarkkliniek and -- but sh -- in her\ncase, she worked there as an attendant, as a nurse\u2019s aid, basically.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m not sure. I really don\u2019t know. There were quite a few Jews\nwho were hiding there in the same way, although I never asked my munther -- my\nmother exactly how many people. She did tell me about the shock it was to her to --\nAugust 4, 2002\nto -- to be in a -- inas -- ina hospital where people had been confined -- and\npsychiatric hospitals at that time were quite different from the clinics we are\naccustomed to. So these people had been confined for -- for much of their lives and\nit was a tremendous shock for her. My father apparently adapted much better and he\nfound a little clique of -- of Jewish men who were in hiding and they played cards.\nBut for my mother it was -- it was much more difficult.",
        "A: She did have contact with him. As a matter of fact, for Christmas day 1942, the -\n- in Holland Christmas is celebrated for two days, but the -- on Christmas day, the -\n- my two sisters were brought to the Remarkkliniek to visit my parents. I\u2019m not\nsure whether that was actually Christmas day, it may have been in -- and I have\nsome notes somewhere -- it may have been the feast of Santa Claus, which 1s also a\nbig deal in Holland, which is the sixth of December, but I think this was actually f-\nfor -- for Christmas day. Yeah, it was Christmas day. And they -- so that that part of\nthe family at least, was reunited that -- one last time. This was December 25\", 1942.\nThe following day the clinic was invaded by the Germans and apparently was\nemptied not only of all the Jews who were hiding there, but also of all the patients\nand the entire staff, they were all taken prisoner. And my parents were taken, first to\na -- a temporary prison in The Hague, the former home of the philosopher, Dutch\nAugust 4, 2002\nphilosopher Spinoza had been converted into a prison. And then, just within a\nmatter of days really, early in January they were transferred to the first\nconcentration camp, and that was Westerbork. Westerbork, which is located in\nthe northernmost part of -- of Holland. Westerbork, my mother told me, initially\nhad been built actually as a receiving center for Jewish refugees fleeing eastern\nEurope.",
        "A: They remained in Westerbork, I believe for sev -- for -- for several weeks, not a\nvery long period of time. My mother was put in charge of the nursery there, of\ntaking care of -- of young children, and it gave her, she said, a sense of security that\n-- that her own children were not there. She was really quite glad of that, actually\nand very grateful that -- that there ha -- was -- that we had found sa -- that she had\nfound safe refuge for all three children.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think -- there was no contact. And I -- I think at that\npoint every attempt was made probably, to keep things as secret as possible, so she\ndid not disclose. There was some contact later on, and I can mention that now, is\nactually my mother, on -- on her way subsequently to -- to Auschwitz, wrote a little\nAugust 4, 2002\nnote on a piece of -- of toilet paper which said, en route to Auschwitz, all is well.\nAnd she dropped that on the railroad tracks and she put an address on it, not -- I --\nprobably to my mother\u2019s neighbors, not to where my sisters were or I was. And a\nrailroad worker in Holland found the note and it did make its way back. I\u2019ve never\nseen the note, I\u2019m not sure whether my mother saved it or not, but there 1s a very\nsimilar note in the museum in Amsterdam. So I -- I assume that this was really s-\nsomething that was done fairly commonly. But in any event, from Westerbork, my\n-- my parents were deported to the next concentration camp, which was Vught. And\nVught is -- is a -- is a camp located in northern hol -- northwestern Holland --\nnortheastern Holland, sorry, not far from the city of Eindhoven, and it was home to\nthe Philips factory. And both my parents were put to work in the Philips factory.\nAnd at that time they still had contact with each other; although they were separated\nin the camp, th-they saw each other and still had contact.",
        "A: Just an extreme hope for peace. One of the things that my mother told me that,\nyou know, they had these -- these morning line-ups, and -- in the camp, in Vught.\nAnd at one point actually they were -- they were visited there by -- by Himmler\nhimself, who told them that as long as they worked, they were in no danger, nothing\nAugust 4, 2002\nwould ever happen to them. [indecipherable] Whether it\u2019s at that same line-up or\none of the others, I mean, very humiliating experiences. She saw a little church way\nin the distance in the du -- Dutch church on the horizon, and she wondered how --\nhow wonderful, how it would be if peace would break out at that moment. And she\nsaid she would just run to that church, she didn\u2019t care if 1t was a church or a\nsynagogue and just thank God for -- for being freed. So she did maintain hope. I\nthink that\u2019s -- that\u2019s really what kept my mother going then, and -- and\nsubsequently. She never lost hope. She -- she always tried to -- to -- to really make\nthe best of -- of the situation.",
        "A: She was in her -- in her 30\u2019s at that time.",
        "A: One of the things which -- which happened really a bit later was -- but which\nsort of says something about her state of mind I think, is when she was in one of the\ncattle, the infamous cattle cars. She -- she looked outside, she was able t-to -- to\nlook at the -- the countryside, the German countryside and -- and realize -- this was\nspringtime and she realized how beautiful it was and she -- she said to herself that\nafter the war we probably would not have much money, but that this still was one\nway that the family could actually go around and see Europe and still admire the\nAugust 4, 2002\nbeauty of -- of creation. So that\u2019s -- I think that says something about her state of\nmind. This was much later, when things were much worse for her. Much worse than\nthey were when she was at -- in Vught.",
        "A: Not at that time, but she -- she did tell me about my father\u2019s state of mind\nactually, earlier. He kept hoping that the Germans would be defeated by the\nRussians. He had -- he had great faith in th-the -- in history and what happened\nduring the Napoleonic wars, and he -- he felt that when -- when Russia entered the\nwar, he -- he felt it was a strong possibility that the Germans would be defeated in\nRussia and that that will be the end of the war. But that, of course, was not to be for\na long time.",
        "A: \u2019'm not entirely sure. I do have some documents that I could refer to, okay?",
        "A: Right. I think -- good. They -- they stayed in Vught for sev -- as far as I know,\nseveral months and then were transferred from, or tra -- deported from Vught to\nAuschwitz. That\u2019s where my mother wrote that fame -- that note, which she\nAugust 4, 2002\ndropped on the railroad track. They were still together on arrival in Auschwitz, and\nwere both selected for work -- to -- to work in Auschwitz.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they were in th -- in the cattle car together. They just -- I -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think so. I think men and women were separated, but I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m not sure of that. But -- and I d -- I don\u2019t know of any specific conversations\nwhat they had. She did, on arrival in Auschwitz they -- they -- they both, I think,\nwere very much aware of -- of what the realities of Auschwitz were, there was no --\nno hiding it. You know, she -- she told me of Torah scrolls that were on the floors.\nShe told me of Tallisium that had been com -- made into curtains and sh-she\nrealized that things in Auschwitz were going to be very, very, very bad. My mother\nsomehow found a way to make herself indispensable in -- in many different ways.\nThe first kind of job that she had actually, was making fur coats for the wives of --\nof German generals. My mother had never done any kind of tailoring, any kind of\nwork before, hard work, let alone working with fur, but somehow she managed to\npersuade them that she was able to -- to work with fur. And so she made some --\nsome fur coats. That was her -- her first job. And then through the grapevine is how\nshe learned that people working in electronics were very essential to the work\neffort, and that led to a different kind of work, first in Auschwitz, but then to a\nAugust 4, 2002\ntransfer to Reichenbach, which was home of the Telefunken factory, and there she\nwas put to work assembling radio tubes essential for the war effort and for\ntransmission.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yes, my mother found work in Auschwitz, made herself indispensable first by\nmaking fur coats, and then she learned through the grapevine that people who\nworked in electronics were saved, actually had a way of saving themselves. And so\nshe started doing that, she claimed that she knew how to -- how to work in\nelectronics, and she was -- that led to a transfer to the Telefunken factory in\nReichenbach, sort of a continuation, if you will, of what she had been doing at\nPhilips in -- in -- in Vught. And in Reichenbach she -- she worked assembling\nradio tubes. Her state of mind at that point actually improved, or she took heart\nfrom the fact that there were not only Jewish and other -- other inmates of the\nconcentration camps working at Telefunken, but there were also German soldiers\nwho had been injured on the Russian front, many of whom were missing limbs and\nAugust 4, 2002\nwere put to work basically, as best they could in the factory. And their state of\nmind, they were so anti-Hitler, and anti-Himmler that they would do everything to\n-- to sabotage the effort at that point. And she took tremendous heart from that, and\ntold me of her own sabotage efforts basically, you know, she would spend the\nwhole day assembling the radio tube, and then when the alarm sounded, or the siren\nsounds at the end of the day, she would take the -- the entire radio tube apart and\nput it back in the drawer and then the following day would start the process again,\nwhich 1s kind of a daring thing, certainly. But by that time, things like that were\nquite common.",

        "A: In Auschwitz they still had contact together, but that was the end. It was in\nAuschwitz really that they were separated. I did not realize that until much later,\nbut my father actually remained in Auschwitz, amazingly for -- for over a year,\nbefore being transferred to another hellhole, Mauthausen, another work camp,\ndeath camp. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to distinguish the two suddenly -- certainly. And then he\nwas transferred from Mauthausen after being there for several months, to several\nother, smaller subsidiaries of Mauthausen; Gusen, Steyr and then finally ended up\nAugust 4, 2002\nin a camp called Ebensee. My mother and I for many years thought that he worked\nin salt mines. I don\u2019t know where we got that idea from, but there were salt mines in\n-- in that area, that part of Austria, actually. And it\u2019s called the Salzkammergut.\nAnd -- but the-these were actually abandoned salt mines that were used for\nassembling of V-2 rockets. And that\u2019s where my father di -- where my father\nworked to the end of the war. And he -- he remained there through the liberation,\nsurvived the liberation by the Americans, and -- but was much too weak, contracted\n-- well, what we was told was tuberculosis and died still in Ebensee and still\nwithout having been able to establish contact with us, two months after the war, on\nJuly 25\", 1945. He -- he died in a -- ac -- a convent in Ebensee that had been\nconverted into a hospital for concentration camp victims who were very ill. My\npartner Joel and I visited the -- the convent, actually, and spoke to one of the sisters\nabout her experience there, and she -- she had -- she was much too young, I think, to\nhave been there, actually. But she said that -- that literally there were hundreds of\ninmates who were being cared for, and that people were just also dying on a daily\nbasis. And my father was buried actually, in -- in a cemetery in the former\nconcentration camp of Ebensee. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s an absolutely beautiful place. It is 1m --\nun -- it\u2019s unimaginable that -- that horrors like that could have taken place. It -- it\u2019s -\n- | think it\u2019s one of the most beautiful places on earth.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Well, his grave originally was marked, and there are some -- some mass graves\nthere, because of the tremendous number of people who died immediately after --\nthey were found dead in the concentration camp. And then there were a lot of\nmarked graves, but for the sake of -- of uniformity, basically -- initially actually his\n-- his -- the first time my mother visited the cemetery in 1952, there was actually a\ncross on -- on his grave, that we didn\u2019t know -- there were Jewish graves that did\nnot have crosses, that had, you know, just plain markers. We didn't know why there\nwas across on his grave. And we didn\u2019t know whether in -- somehow in his last\ndays he had converted, or whatever, what had happened. But we were told at the t --\nor she was told at the time that all the markers would be removed because there\nwere far too many errors like that. And also because many of the people were\nunidentified, and so all markers were removed, but we do know exactly where he is\nburied.",
        "A: My mother eventually -- Reichenbach was bombed by the allies and the factory\nwas destroyed and again showing my mother\u2019s attitude at the time and her\ncontinued hope that kept her going was she said the Shechianu prayer, as she saw\nthe flames engulfing the factory. She said that was one of the greatest joys that she\nAugust 4, 2002\nhad, was seeing that factory going up in flames. And then after that she was put on -\n- on one of these many death marches that were occurring and she was just\ntransferred from one camp after another, in very, very desperate conditions. She\ntold me that she stuffed newspapers around her -- her -- her feet to keep them warm,\nbasically. And sh -- barely -- she barely had -- had shoes. Just absolutely desperate\nconditions. She did become ill along the way, developed a diarrheal disease, and --\nbut somehow managed to survive.",
        "A: My mother told me that the photographs were hidden in her hair, and she told me\nthat her hair -- I asked her whether her hair was ever cut or shaven like -- like most\nwomen in Auschwitz, but she said it was not. I don\u2019t whether that was just -- she\nwas just being discreet with me, but she -- but she claims -- she told me that she had\nthem hidden in her hair. She had the feeling that if these two little photographs of\nmy -- my bris were ever lost, it would mean that I had died. And so she really, she\nheld onto those, and I still have those photographs.",

It\u2019s --\nit\u2019s interesting, my mother never wanted me to photograph the number, and she --\nshe talked many times of having it removed, actually. She always kept it covered.\nShe was -- til the end of her life she would shop for dresses that had, you know,\nsleeves that just barely covered the number. She -- she did not want to show that\nnumber. Eventually my mother ended up at a -- a camp at the German-Danish\nborder, and that\u2019s where she eventually was -- was liberated. It was actually about a\nmonth or two before the end of the war. It turns out, and this -- this was really found\nout -- and my mother did tell me that she was liberated, came off a train, was in -- 1n\nterritory that was marked, Red Cross. And she was greeted by a Count Bernadotte\no-of Sweden. And I believe the Danish -- Swedish crown prince was with him. And\nshe was, it turned out, part of a large convoy of -- of women who had been kept\nhostage by Himmler to try to gain his own freedom, eventually, negotiate his own\nsafety after the war through -- wi-with -- with Count Folke Bernadotte. And also\nshe was fortunate enough to be -- to be saved as a result of that, and to be liberated.",

Now, she never mentioned the white buses, the famous white buses\nspecifically, but subsequently I\u2019ve seen photographs of those. I\u2019ve never been able\nto verify with her whether that\u2019s how she was transported, but she did tell me that\nshe crossed Denmark, which was then still occupied, and was taken in by a family\nin Sweden. The inmates were just -- were distributed to -- to different families in\nSweden who were willing to take in the prisoners and be part of the rehabilitation\nprocess, basically.

Much, much later I found a book that -- that contained an\nadvertisement asking for the whereabouts of my sisters, and the name they were\ngiven was Jonson, the last name. And I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s the name of the\nfamily that they were hidden with or not, my mother didn\u2019t tell me. But in any\nevent, I-I was placed with -- with Annie Madna --",

I gave a talk\nabout my family\u2019s experiences and someone in the audience worked at the Library\nof Congress, and the following day just happened to pick up a book that contained\nreprints from Jewish newspapers in Holland and there, in the middle of the page\nwas an adver -- was an advertisement a-asking about -- the whereabouts of my two\nsisters and where they had last been seen when they were deported.",

So I think that this was\nAugust 4, 2002\na different member of the same family, the Van Luhrmann family, because they\nwere not -- this was not The Hague address.",
        "A: I was placed with Annie Madna and again with -- with the -- the -- with the goal\nof eventually going to the countryside. I remained with Annie for -- I don\u2019t know\nexactly how long, I think about two months altogether, because I -- I think I was\ntold that I was 11 months old when I finally arrived at the Tol\u00e9 Madna household.\nTol\u00e9 Madna was the ex-husband of Annie Madna. They had joint custody of their\nthree children, Vidy -- Willy, Davy and Robby. And so I was transferred to --\neventually to -- to her husband. Tol\u00e9 Madna had a housekeeper by the name of\nMima Saina, S-a-i-n-a. We don\u2019t even know what -- what -- what her real name\nwas, if that was her real name. She was an Indonesian woman who was really -- the\nIndonesian term was a babu, which was nursemaid. She took care of -- or nanny.\nAnd she took care of the children and also the entire household. She was a -- a\nyoung woman, probably in her 20\u2019s at the time and had no -- was not married and\nhad no children of her own, but she had taken care of -- especially o-of -- of Robby\nMadna when he was very young. And -- so it was completely natural for her to -- to\ntake me on as -- as -- and take care of me. And she really did not want to part with\nme, and apparently the other children in the household also liked the idea of having\nAugust 4, 2002\na baby in the household, and so I ended up remaining with the Madna family until\nthe return of my mother in August 1945. Obviously, since I was an infant I have,\nyou know, very few memories, direct memories just of -- of my stay with the\nMadna family, but I do have a few, actually. I -- I remember listening to Indonesian\nlullabies that Papa Madna, Mr. Tol\u00e9 Madna played on the piano.",
        "A: No, I can\u2019t. My native tongue apparently was -- was Malay, or Indonesian, but\nI\u2019ve totally -- I\u2019ve just almost totally forgotten it, for two -- a few words, but I was\ntold that that\u2019s how I communicated with Mima, who did not speak any Dutch. She\nwas actually illiterate, couldn\u2019t read or write.",
        "A: Yes. My family, th-they all spoke Dutch, and my mother had learned Dutch.\nClose -- it\u2019s close enough to German that -- that she learned Dutch fairly quickly,\nthat\u2019s what my father spoke, and certainly, you know -- they tried everything really\nto -- to -- to become a part of the -- the Dutch community.",
        "A: So they -- that -- that was their language, definitely.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Sure. The house that I was hidden in was located -- was not -- van\nKinsbergenstraat, number 40. And it was a -- a -- a very modest house in -- not too\nfar from the -- the home of my parents and also my -- my parent\u2019s home was\nactually an apartment that was just a door away from where my mothe -- my\nfather\u2019s business was, his store was. And this was probably half a mile, or a mile\naway from-om where the store was, certainly within walking distance, was where\nthe van Kinsbergenstraat house was. It had a front room, sort of a middle room,\ntypical Dutch house and then a back room and then two little rooms at the very,\nvery end. And I slept in sort of an enclosed porch, as I remember. My father -- my\nfoster father, Papa Madna also had kept birds, that was his hobby. He had canaries.\nAnd that was one of the other sounds, besides the -- the -- the lullabies, the\nIndonesian lullaby, what I also remember was the sound of canaries. I\u2019ve\nsubsequently made a tape of that, actually, because it -- that\u2019s -- it\u2019s something that\nhe -- he stuck to through the end of his life, really. He had a tremendous love for his\nbirds. It was a very joyful household as I -- as I remember. I -- I do remember one\nspecific thing, which must have been when I was a little bit older, obviously. I came\nthere when I was less than a year old, my guess is when I was about two or three. I -\nAugust 4, 2002\n- I tried to copy the writing. I saw my -- the -- my foster -- my sisters, then sisters,\nWilly and Davy tri -- writing and so I scribbled on a piece of paper. And I\nremember that they were laughing and I was very unhappy about that. It\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s just\none of those memories that -- that has stuck with me. I -- I also remember some of\nthe f -- a little bit of the furniture. Here in the apartment I have -- I have some items\nactually that were in -- in the house. There was a big, Indonesian wayang doll,\nwhich is a puppet, which is now hanging in my foyer. And just to show, you know,\nthe dimensions of -- of -- perceived dimensions as a child, Papa Madna had a -- a\nlittle liquor cabinet that was shaped like a barrel, and to me it looked very big,\nactually and it wasn\u2019t until many, many years later, recently in fact, that I\nencountered that barrel again and realized that it was very tiny. And I -- I -- that\nbarrel is now in my apartment as well, I -- it -- 1t arrived here rece -- just a few\nweeks ago. And just -- just one other reminder of those days. I also remember some\nof the toys I had. I had a big yellow stuffed dog and then a little stuffed rabbit, also\nyellow. And I subsequently found out that that\u2019s where much of my mother\u2019s\njewelry was actually hidden, was sewn into -- to th -- my toy rabbit. I also, towards\nthe -- remember one particular time when I was hungry and the last winter of the\nwar in Holland was extremely bad, very rough, and there was really very, very little\nfood. And the only thing we had to eat at that time -- again something I found out\nAugust 4, 2002\nsubsequently, is tulip bulbs. And I remember waking up, or -- one night and feeling\nhungry and seeing the table set for the following morning. And so I just sat down at\nthe table, waiting to be fed, and I -- I -- I really distinctly remember falling asleep\nand my head falling into the plate. That\u2019s one very distinct memory. And then the --\nthe most definite memory I have is when my mother returned, when I was reunited\nwith my mother.",
        "A: Oh no, I -- I was confined to the house and to the backyard, basically, and I do --\nmy view of the outside world was really through a mail slot. That\u2019s the only thing\nthat I saw.",
        "A: I never went out the front door, never went out to the street, but was allowed to\nplay in the backyard, and I have some photographs of me playing in the backyard.\nVery --",
        "A: Some of the neighbors were aware of the fact of my -- were aware of my\npresence.

Whether, you\nknow, he really used this story with the Germans or not, I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the\nstory he told me. The n -- our neighbors on va -- on van Kinsbergenstraat, I was\ntold were actually very anti-German, were communist and so they were of the\nwhere -- aware of the fact that I was there. Many members of the Indonesian\ncommunity who came to the house, I think also were aware of the fact that I was\nthere in the house and -- and in fact, many, many years later, when I would visit\nPapa Madna, we -- we -- we\u2019d go to a Indonesian grocer store and the grocer had\none look at the combination of Papa Madna and myself and immediately realized\nwho I was. And he called me by my then name, I had a name in hiding called -- I\nwas called Bobby, and that\u2019s what he called me, you know, Bobby. I -- I -- I\nthought for many years that I -- | was named after the dog, I had -- there was a dog\nin the family. And that the reason for that 1s so that people would think the dog was\nbeing called when I was being called, and -- as a -- as a disguise. That story turned\nout not to be true, because I found out that the dog\u2019s name was actually Teddy.",

        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Mr. T-Tol\u00e9 Madna was born in Indonesia and came to Holland around -- he\nwas born in 1896 and came to Holland around the time of World War II -- World\nWar I, sorry. With either -- and I\u2019m not sure whether this was his mother or a foster\nmother, I\u2019m not sure, he was very, very mysterious about his background, never\nAugust 4, 2002\ntalked about it very much. Apparently he came from a family that was relatively\nwell-to-do, because he -- he -- after he arrived at Holland he was able to take piano\nlessons. He was very proud of the fact that he owned a motorcycle, and he -- he\nreally became a part of -- of the very -- the young Indonesian community that was\nbeing established in Holland. Indonesia, of course, was a Dutch colony at the time.\nAnd he -- he then married Annie Madna, further really integrating him really into -\n- into Dutch society. But he also, I think felt very proud of his -- of his Indonesian\nheritage. He -- there were paintings in the house that illustrated, really, life in the\nIndonesian villages. And he -- he enjoyed gardening in -- in the home, in van\nKinsbergenstraat actually, we kept chickens in the backyard, which he -- he really\ngreatly enjoyed. Many years later, when he moved to a smaller apartment after the\nwar, he -- he got one of those little gardens outside the city and th-there was no\nquestion as t -- his garden, his little garden was the most luxuriant of any of them\naround. And -- and he had all sorts of -- of little quirks. For example, he -- he dug a\nbig hole in that backyard, which became a -- a refrigerator. Was very, very clever,\nthat\u2019s where he kept his beer, so that when he worked in the backyard he could sit\nthere and -- this little yard, little garden, he had his -- his -- his little comforts from\nhome, actually.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nAugust 4, 2002\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: He was a very affectionate, very warm person. I\u2019m not sure about physical\naffection, but you know, we -- we were very, very, very close. He was always to --\nto the very end very protective of me, certainly. And I remember sitting on his lap. I\nremember also, this was immediately after the war when I was allowed to go out of\nthe house, I remember sitting on the back of his bicycle, or he also had a little seat\non the front of his bicycle where I would sit, and I enjoyed that a great deal. We\nwould take long walks together. He -- the -- we\u2019d alway -- he would always -- this\nwas after the war, immediately after the war an-and he worked in a -- in a restaurant\nand I would go up the back stairs with him and the Indonesian women who worked\nin the kitchens would always have little snacks for me. He -- he always as -- as --\neven when it was really no longer necessary he would always have a -- a little\nsavings, a piggy bank for me, for example. He fashioned those out of his cigarette\nboxes. These were Player cigarettes, which came in metal cans at the time, and I\nAugust 4, 2002\nremember he made those into a piggy bank for myself. And that continued for a\nlong time. He bought me comic books, because he knew there was one comic strip\nthat I really enjoyed called \u201cPanda\u201d which was really just only found in Holland,\nand he would always buy me the little books, and I -- I really enjoyed those. So we -\n- we really had a very, very close relationship. And that -- that continued to the very\nend of his life when he died at age 96. I-I saw him just two months before he died.\nJoel and I went to vi -- went to Holland and we visited him, spent quite a bit of\ntime with him and with his t -- other children. And I -- I remember his final gesture\n-- first of all, his final words to me was to -- to be careful, and watch over my\nmother, which was very typical. This is the way he had always been, very\nconcerned about her as well. And then, as we were leaving the apartment building\nhe stood at the window waving a white handkerchief. And that was the last gesture,\nthat was the last time I saw him alive. And then two months later I went back for\nthe funeral. And people say that he kept himself alive waiting for me to come and\nvisit him one last time because he -- he and I were very, very close. And I also to --\nto the very end always called him Papa. There were no qualifications to that. Now,\nMima we have not talked about. Obviously, the person who really raised me,\nespecially when I was very young, when I was an infant, was Mima. I was told that\nI slept in her bed, slept with her. And I was also told that Mima kept a knife under\nAugust 4, 2002\nher pillow and that she said that if ever the Germans came for me, she would kill me\nand then herself. Again, I have no direct knowledge of that, but that\u2019s what I was\ntold. I was very, very close to her. I have absolutely no direct memory of -- of\nMima, except perhaps the few words of -- of -- of Malay Indonesian that I\nremember, but other than that, I have no direct memory while she was alive. Mima\ntragically died shortly after the war. She died in October 1945 of a cerebral\nhemorrhage, very, very unexpectedly. And I do remember visiting her grave many\ntimes. I also remember going back there to -- to the grave when Papa Madna buried\nhis favorite canary in -- in the same grave, the gravesite. And many, many years\nlater I went to visit the grave with Papa Madna. And th-there -- there was a woman\nat the gate, who again, because of the combination of an Indonesian man and a\nCaucasian young man -- younger man, immediately knew who I was and\nrecognized me from the little child who had come to visit the grave of Mima. And I\nwas able to find the grave without anybody telling me where it was. So there was a\nvery sharp divide, I just totally bla -- have -- have totally -- have no direct memory\nof her alive, but I do remember her grave very well, very distinctly.\nAugust 4, 2002",

        "A: -- flow together. I do remember leaving the house and I-I\u2019m told I was all\ndressed up in -- in the national colors of -- of Holland, and watching a parade. It\u2019s\ninteresting because I don\u2019t have any direct memory of that, but I do have a memory\nof about eight months later or so, being with my mother at the place where we\nwatched the parade and telling her that\u2019s where I was with Mima. That memory I\ndo have, which 1s -- which 1s interesting. And -- and my mother really didn\u2019t believe\nme at the time, and she had to -- she verified this with the family. But other than\nthat, I really don\u2019t have any -- any specific memories of -- of the months before my\nmother returned. When I was -- I -- I was sleeping the night she came back and\nsomeone came to wake me up. I don\u2019t know who it was. I think it was one of my\nsisters, foster sisters, Davy or Willy. And I went to the front room of the house\nwhere everybody was sitting in a circle. And I was crying because I was unhappy\nabout being woken up, and I was being passed around from lap to lap. And I do\nAugust 4, 2002\nremember very distinctly refusing to sit in a strange woman\u2019s lap, and that, of\ncourse, was my own mother. And it took awhile for my mother to -- for me to get\nused to my mother, and to be -- I -- I have no specific memories of all the things\nthat happened. One thing my mother told me was that she as -- she told Mima -- she\n-- she got tickets for Mima to go to a movie, which was something very special at\nthat time, and just so -- so that my mother would have some time alone with me.\nAnd Mima left the house and then came back a few minutes later and told my\nmother, don\u2019t hit him. Just -- that\u2019s how protective, of course, Mima was, even vis-\na-vis with my mother. Initially my mother and I stayed with the Madna family and\nthen my mother found an apar -- was a very small apartment. Well, these were\nfurnished rooms, really. Again, somewhere not far from where our original home\nhad been on Laanformairdafort, another -- sort of all in the same general area. It\nwas an apartment upstairs and a woman and her daughter lived there and they --\nthey rented out the front room. I do remember that they had a little dog. You know,\nit\u2019s funny what children remember. Little dachshund.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I think 1t was a few weeks, I\u2019m not sure entirely, cause then we moved with -- to\nthis first apartment and I think we were only there for a month or two and then\nmoved to a larger apartment.",
        "A: You know, I think that this -- I -- I don\u2019t, and I think part of that is because it\nwas a very gradual thing. I still spent a lot of time with them --",
        "A: -- initially.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s really only probably after Mima died that I moved entirely with, or\nprimarily with -- with my mother. And she -- sh -- she had to go out of the house to\ntry to make a living, and the reason I say that I -- I -- I was really away from the\nMadna family at that point, because I remember one time having trouble getting\ninto the apartment and that was because my mother was away, she was actually\nselling some of the merchandise that my father had left behind from his tailoring\nbusiness. Fabrics were very valuable at the time and he had many factories that\nowed him fabrics from -- from England. And that\u2019s -- that was her first business,\nwas Selling those.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. This was not in his store any more, the store was -- was\ngone, had been taken over. So these -- this was really more a credit sort of -- and my\nmother, actually, her initial work was out of a suitcase. But then I remember the day\nwhen -- when I couldn\u2019t get into the house, she was extremely upset and that\u2019s\nwhen she decided to -- to start her own business, basically and she bought us a\nstore. But this was over a fairly long period of time. I would imagine -- I think she\nbought the store probably about 1947 or so. \u2019'm not entirely sure because I had\nalready gone to kindergarten at a -- at a school that was around the corner from that\nsecond apartment that we lived in.",
        "A: [love difficulties mixing with other children. I don\u2019t remember too much to --\nhaving too many difficulties at the kindergarten, actually, but I do remember my\nmother sending me to a summer camp. And that -- that created tre-tremendous\ndifficulties and fears.",
        "A: It was a Jewish camp called Wijk aan Zee, not too far from -- from Amsterdam\nand I was surrounded by very, very rowdy Jewish kids who had all been in hiding\nand who all had, in retrospect, tremendous difficulties, you know, they were very\nAugust 4, 2002\ndifficult to control. And I had come from at -- you know, very quiet household,\nbasically. I had had it easy compared to -- to many of them. And I was -- so I -- I\njust did not fit in, and I had trouble, you know, wi-with that. So then the next place\nthat my mother sent me to for summer vacation was not a summer camp, but it was\nactually a private home where I went with m -- friends of my mother in a -- ina\ntown called Appledorn. And th-that\u2019s -- that worked out much, much better.",
        "A: Of?",
        "A: Very much so, yeah. I remember vomiting every day and really being sick and\nthen finally my mother, you know, take me -- took me back. I -- I did not last one\nwe -- I think I lasted about a week and then she took me back, and -- because it d --\nit just did not work out.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember ever having any difficulties when I was in -- when I started\nkindergarten or school, so I think I -- I -- I think I was pretty fluent in Dutch. As I\nsaid, I d -- I never -- I don\u2019t remember ever speaking Malay, so this was really very,\nAugust 4, 2002\nvery early on. It\u2019s only in speaking to Robby and Davy that I -- you know, that I\nwas told that I -- I really did communicate and answered in -- in Malay whenever I\nwas spoken to. And I was able to understand Mima. But -- but I must have, you\nknow, learned Dutch at that time as well from the other children.",
        "A: I learned about my sisters and -- and about my -- my father very, very early on.\nThe interesting thing is, you know, that at that time my story was not unique. So\nhaving sisters who were deported was not unusual. And so it didn\u2019t particularly\nshock me, it didn\u2019t particularly affect me. They were just gone. And my mother --\nmy mother\u2019s neighbor, the Van Luhrmann family, they were both schoolteachers\nand they had taught my sisters how to -- to read and write at a very, very young age.\nAnd they and my mother had saved all of my sisters\u2019 notebooks. And my mother\nwould show me those notebooks. And this -- this was before I started elementary\nschool, so it was really pretty soon after the war that she showed me those. She had\nportraits of my sisters that were -- that were hanging 1n -- in the -- in the apartment.\nSo again I knew certainly, of them. She told me many stories about my sisters. They\nwere held out, really as a example to me in many ways. And so I got to know my\nAugust 4, 2002\nsisters through my mother\u2019s words and also through her neighbors, the Van\nLuhrmann family. They v -- also showed me -- my mother showed me the\nnotebooks that -- that my sister Eva was writing in. I don\u2019t think my sister Leah\nwas -- she was much younger, obviously did not know how to -- to write, but the\nVan Luhrmann family also showed me books, and they were actually -- because,\nas I said before, my sisters had gone to a Catholic religious school, so she would\nshow me books, little Catholic books that my sisters were able to read. And I\nremember had a little devil one side, a little angel on the other side. And I -- I\nremember very distinctly looking at those. My mother always told me that she --\nshe had decided that she did not want me to learn how to read at a very young age.\nShe thought somehow that this was a jinx. That when -- when, you know, my sisters\nwere So precocious in their reading and writing, that somehow had something to do\nwith -- with their -- with their fate. And so in my case, my mother really did not\nencourage that.",
        "A: The Van Luhrmann family next door had some of the things. There were others\nalso who -- who had hidden things, and we sort of gradually -- my mother gradually\nAugust 4, 2002\nhad things returned to her. Again, you know, this -- this was sort of part of normal\nlife, to have things returned. All the people we had contact with after the war were\npeople who were -- either had survived the concentration camps or people who had\nbeen in hiding, so that was normal conversation. You know, it was how you\nsurvived. How did you survive, what did you do? It\u2019s without -- with very little\nemotion, as far as I can remember, actually, because it was so much -- just an\neveryday occurrence.",
        "A: The same thing, for example, one of the families that we were very close with\nafter the war was the Vanderpool family. Hela Vanderpool was a woman who had\ngone through all the concentration camps with my mother. And she was younger\nthan my mother. Also came from the same general area in Poland, Galicia. And\nafter the war married a -- a Dutch man. Her -- her maiden name was Helen -- Helen\nEnwine and then she married Max Vanderpool. And my mother remained very\nclose friends with her. Probably -- she was probably my mother\u2019s closest friend.\nAnd the only housing that they could find in The Hague was in the attic of one\nhouse that was sort of left standing 1n this entire bombed out neighborhood. And I\nremember this is a time my mother already had her store, taking this very, very long\nwalk across this bombed out area, this -- this -- all this debris and rubble, through\nAugust 4, 2002\nthe rubble to this house where they lived, this attic. And again, it was -- 1t was a\njoyful occasion to take those walks. I thought it was the most normal thing to do,\nwas to take a walk across, you know, bombed out rubble. I remember thinking that\nit was the most normal thing to find bunkers with shells on the beach. Again, this\nwas just part of normal growing up after World War II.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Well, before I even started schooling, my mother, who as I said before, did not\nreally want me to learn how to read or write before had to teach me some other\nthings. And that was the first thing she taught me, was really a love for -- for\ntheater, and for theater type games, and I remember very distinctly playing those.\nShe would tell me things that -- plays that she had done when she was a young girl,\nyoung -- growing up 1n Poland, she was part of a -- a theater company. And I\nwould remember those, and that\u2019s -- and I would -- I would actually start playing\nthose before I even learned how to read or write, with a puppet theater. That became\none of my favorite toys. Another thing that really fascinated me, probably because I\nAugust 4, 2002\nhad spent those early years completely confined to the house was the tramway\noutside and going from place to place on -- on public -- this public conveyance, on\nthe tramway. And I very quickly memorized all of the stops on the tramway, the\nlocal tramway. And one of the first toys that I got from Papa Madna after the war\nfor my -- the first birthday that occurred after the war was a miniature tram. And\nright about that time the numbers, in sort of a bureaucratic thing, were -- were\nchanged on the tramway. And I remember, since I didn\u2019t know how to read or write\nyet, but I did remember asking either Willy or Davy to make sure and change the\nnumber on my tramway. It\u2019s a very, very distinct memory I have. This was just\nabout the time when I started kindergarten. The kindergarten was right around the\ncorner from the house that my mother and I lived in, which was on a place called\nArchimaidastraat [indecipherable] street -- straat in -- in -- in The Hague and\nright around the corner was the first school that I went to. And I do remember very\ndistinctly enjoying kindergarten, doing all the things pe -- children do in\nkindergarten, you know, making things wi -- c -- playing with clay, remember that\nvery distinctly. Little artwork, bringing that home, learning about some -- some\nholidays. For example, I -- I learned about Mother\u2019s day through kindergarten and\nbringing home a card that I had made for my mother. I also remember going\nshopping to buy my mother a gift, and 1t was a geranium. That was the first plant. I\nAugust 4, 2002\nwent to a store and asked her, you know, if she has this much money, whatever it\nwas, I said, what would she get? And so that\u2019s -- that was the first time I ever\nbought a gift for my mother. I think for her birthday, which was very close actually,\nsince that was May 20\" -- the two were very close -- I bought her a bottle of\nperfume which I accidentally dropped. Also one of those -- those childhood\nmemories. I kept it hidden from her in back of -- and so I was holding it in back of\nme, and phew, it fell to the floor as th -- as she opened the door. After -- 1t was after\nkindergarten that -- just about that time that my mother bought her business. That\nwas in a -- that was a -- a cosmetic store, perfume store. It was in the --in -- not ina\nvery good neighborhood, quite far away from where we had lived before and where\nI had spent my years with the Madnas. This was near the -- one the train stations in\nThe Hague. Little bit of a red light district, as a matter of fact, and certainly non --\nnot a wealthy neighborhood, but it was the only -- housing was extremely short in\nHolland because o f-- in The Hague especially, because such a big part of the city\nhad been bombed out by the allies, actually. And so we -- she found this -- this\nstore, this perfume store from a man who -- it was called Parfumerie Idajale, and\nshe bought it from a man by the name of Sharfstein who moved to South America.\nAnd she took over the store and we lived in back of the store. And then I -- she --\nshe had to decided on a school for me to go to -- decided that the -- the public\nAugust 4, 2002\nschools were just not the greatest in that neighborhood. There was a -- a Catholic\nschool right across the street from us, but for whatever reason, my mother did not\nwant to go that route -- route again, because probably it brought back too many\nmemories of my sisters. So instead, I went to a -- a private Protestant school called\nthe Weeshuis, it was called Weeshuis, it means orphanage. I don\u2019t know whether\nthere -- there ever was an orphanage attached to that school at one point, but that\nwas what it was called, the orphanage school. Which was a fair distance from --\nfrom home, but not -- not too great and I -- I was able to walk to school by myself,\nand I went there for my -- for the first few grades, first two grades.",
        "A: Oh definitely, I -- I did very well in -- in elementary school, I did very well in --\nI did very well in kindergarten and I did very well, I had no trouble whatsoever in\nelementary school in terms of fact, you know, I sort of became a leader among ah,\nthe children. I had no trouble making friends at all. There was an incident with --\nwith a schoolteacher who sang a song that had some inappropriate words in it and I\ntold my mother about it, and --\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: No, no, not anti-Semitic, just sexual. And he made some gestures that were\ninappropriate and I told my mother about it, and I -- you know, the teacher and the\nprincipal of the school, with whom we were very good friends, my mother had\nbecome close friends with the fre -- with the principal and I was very close friends\nwith the principal\u2019s son. His name was Bati Bos, B-o-s. And they came over to the\nhouse and I was confronted, I was asked to -- to confront the teacher and tell them\nwhat -- what had happened, and I did. And after that my mother decided to change\nschools and I then went on, took a tramway actually to go back to take -- to -- to\nattend the school in the neighborhood where we had lived before the war, because\nmy mother really felt those were the better schools. And that was a public school.\nAnd that\u2019s where I went for third and fourth grades [indecipherable] something\napproximately, and I again, you know, enjoyed that. And then subsequently then,\nafter that, is when we -- when we moved to Belgium. And so I attended schools in -\n- in Brussels.",
        "A: We moved to Brussels, if I remember correctly, probably 1952 -- either 19 --\nsome time between 1950 and 1952 1s when we moved to Belgium. And my mother\nat that point, at the -- was considering or attempting a remarriage that -- that utterly\nfailed, but we did end up living in Belgium for several years.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: It was difficult to leave the Madnas and by then also I had become very close\nwith -- with other friends of my mother\u2019s. For example, one family that we\u2019re v --\nwe were very, very close with was a family that lived -- called Ravensbergan.\nHusband was Truus, T-r-u-u-s, and Piet, P-i-e-t. They -- my -- my Uncle Emil,\nwhom I mentioned earlier, had actually been hidden with them in this little town\ncalled Rijnsburg, outside of Leiden. And -- but he was -- he was found out by the\nGermans and was deported. And I never really found out anything else about him. I\nhave no new information whatsoever. But we became very close friends with the\nRavensbergan family and we would spend many weekends traveling there. We\nwould take the train, first to Leiden and then a second, more local tramway,\nactually [indecipherable] tramway to the town of -- of -- of -- where they lived.\nAnd I -- I would spend weekends there, or sometimes a week and I would ver -- I\nwas very, very close with those people. By that time the Vanderpool family had\nleft for the United States. They emigrated du -- in 1948 to the United States, so\nthat was a loss for my mother. And that\u2019s, I think, when she became really very --\neven closer friends with -- with these -- the Ravensbergan in -- in Rijnsburg. And\nwe would go there almost every other weekend. And -- and leaving them when we\nmoved to Brussels was very, very difficult. And I remember catching rides\nAugust 4, 2002\nperiodically to get back to visit them. Rijnsburg is a -- is an area where it\u2019s in the\nmiddle of all the flower fields of Holland, the flower industry. And trucks with\nflowers would go to Belgium to deliver them to the market. And when these trucks\nwould go back empty I would catch a ride with them to go back and visit the family\nfrom Brussels. So I remained in very close contact with them as well.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Sure. It\u2019s hard to say, you know, because it\u2019s -- it\u2019s compared to what, you\nknow, I have no -- I have no way of comparing. I-I don\u2019t f -- you know, I -- when I\nwas in elementary school I became -- I had -- I became very, very ill. I had a\nruptured appendix. And this was in my first year in elementary school, if I\nremember correctly. And at that -- at that time there was no -- there were no\nantibiotics, as yet. Penicillin had just come out. So I was really very, very sick. I\nwas in the hospital for about 10 weeks altogether. And my mother had a tremendous\nfear that she was going to lose me at that time. And she talked about that, a lot. And\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s when I really found out how much I meant to her, that -- that -- you\nAugust 4, 2002\nknow. I was the one thing that kept her going, and she told me that many, many,\nmany times. So yes, you know, she was very protective. But at the same time, for\nexample, did allow me to play outside, did allow me to have friends, encouraged me\nto walk to school by myself, even though there was some danger there. And one\ntime I was almost hit by a car. But nonetheless, sh-she did allow me that freedom\nand she allowed me to grow up, basically. So she was not overly protective. She\nalso tried to encourage me to mix with other children. Hence, you know, the -- the\ncamp I mentioned before. I went to -- I would go to the Protestant elementary\nschool in the mornings and then in the afternoon I would go to a cheder, to a -- a\nHebrew school which was in a building adjacent to the big synagogue in The\nHague. And that was a very, very long walk actually. But I [indecipherable] my\nmother never accompanied me. She couldn\u2019t, she had her store. And she certainly\nallowed me to go there by myself, and I -- I do remember attending the Hebrew\nschool. I remember also her warning, because I was -- the -- the Protestant school\nwas extremely good at teaching Bible, and so she -- she told -- and I was very good\nat that, so she told me, don\u2019t repeat in the afternoon, what you learned in the\nmorning.",
        "A: I definitely knew that I was Jewish. I -- certainly my mother made -- you know,\nsent me to the cheder very, very early on. I think at the same time, virtually that I\nstarted elementary school, I started going to the cheder, which wasn\u2019t much of a\nschool at the time because there were very, very few kids left. My teacher was the\ncantor of the synagogue, Mr. Mussel, and I -- I don\u2019t remember too much of what\nwe -- what he ler -- what he taught us, but I -- and shortly -- it was around that time\nalso, when my mother definitely found out that my father had died, when we got\ndocumentation through the Red Cross. My mother had a very good friend who\nworked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Liza. And he managed to speed\nthings up so that we got documents from the Red Cross explaining exactly what had\nhappened to my father. And as soon as we found out when he had died exactly, we -\n- my mother di -- encouraged me to learn to say Kaddish and to go to the synagogue\non his Yahrzeit. And I probably was about six or seven when I started doing that.\nAnd I also remember going, certainly, to the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, on Yom\nKippur with my mother. I remember very distinctly, for example -- you know, that -\n- this was an Orthodox synagogue in The Hague and so the women sat in the\ngallery upstairs and of course, there I was all by myself downstairs, and I had to be\nadopted by some -- some of the men downstairs, yes. And I remember for the first\ntime th-the honor of rolling up the -- the scroll, the Torah scroll is usually given to a\nAugust 4, 2002\nchild in Holland, and I remember being given the honor. And then afterwards, you\nknow, going over and shaking the hand of the president of the congregation, or the\nparness, as we called him there, and then rushing upstairs to the balcony to ask my\nmother if I had done okay.",
        "A: Yes, she did. She -- she certainly lit candles on Friday night and she observed\nPesach, very distinctly I remember. The Pesach I remember most distinctly was in\n-- in 1948, and the reason I remember it is because my mother was telling me the\nstory about the Egyptians, and then at the same time there was the Arab Israeli war.\nAnd I remember asking how -- her how this was possible since all the Egyptians\nhad already been defeated. Passover. So that was -- that was -- I remember that. I\nremember, you know, going out and buying matzos, which were hard to get in\nHolland. They were round and came in special boxes. The other thing was that --\nthat I remember in terms of -- of -- of Jewish things is that I had -- a-as I indicated\nbefore, I went to a Protestant school, and either the principal of the school or\nsomeone passed out -- passed my name on to a -- a pastor, a p -- a Protestant pastor\nwho was a Jewish convert, by the name of Suril Tabachsblaat. And he came to my\nmother\u2019s store with the idea, I think, of trying to convert her to becoming\nProtestant. But by the time he left the store, she had sent him on errands in\nAugust 4, 2002\nAntwerp, she knew he was going to Antwerp, and so he brought back mezuzahs\nand a siddur, which we didn\u2019t have, you know, none of that was left. And to this\nday the mezuzah on my door is the mezuzah that Mr. Tabachsblaat brought back\nfrom Antwerp. She also persuaded him to let her -- and I don\u2019t think it took much -\n- she told him, she said we were going to have a Seder and she said, you know,\nSeder is not necessarily a Jewish thing, why don\u2019t you have a Seder in your church?\nAnd she -- she persuaded him, something that became very commonplace\nafterwards, to have a Seder in the church. And my mother spoke to his congregants\nabout the Jewish lifecycle events. And my mother, in many ways, I think,\nrediscovered Judaism after the war. Her experiences in the concentration camps did\nnot seem to lessen her faith, but if anything increased it, and she became much more\ninterested in Judaism after the war. Before the war she -- she used the word,\nsearching. After the war there was no searching any more.",
        "A: No, there were no other Jewish children at the -- at the Protestant school, I wa --\nas far as I know, I was the only one there.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Yes. I -- I don\u2019t think there was a -- as I said, you know, I was very close friends,\nfor example, with the -- the son of the principal. The principal\u2019s wife was also one\nof the schoolteachers and I -- I remember watching her grading papers and things\nlike that and spending a lot of time in their household, and I had many other\nchildren in the playground. And I had no difficulty, you know, playing games with\nthem. I remember our favorite game -- my favorite game at that time, because I\nenjoyed going to -- Papa Madna had taken me to the circus and my mother took me\nto the circus in Holland, which is really a big deal over there, and I remember\nplaying circus in -- in the playground with the other children.",
        "A: Well, as I said before, my mother showed me my sister\u2019s notebooks and through\nthe Van Luhrmann family I also -- you know, we constantly talked about my\nsisters. Maybe a little bit less so about my father except my mother did tell me\nabout the -- his store, and what it looked like and the furniture they had bought. In\nmany ways he was really kept, you know, in the family and very early on she gave\nme a -- apen, a Parker pen that belonged to him, which I have -- which I still have.\nThat sort of became a good luck charm. Whenever I took an exam or anything, she\ntold me to take the pen along and use that pen for writing. So she -- she -- she really\nAugust 4, 2002\ntried, you know, to impress on me who my father was. Said things like, you know,\nyour father is with you. And when -- whenever, you know, there were moments of\ndifficulty, or -- or sadness, or po-potential difficulties, we -- I do remember fairly\nearly on after the war, visiting the woman who had hidden my sisters, where my\nsisters had been hidden. She and her husband, as far as I know, separated, so he was\nnot there. But my mother took me in to what -- t-to what me seemed -- seemed like\na very long trip actually on the tramway, way outside The Hague, somewhere near\nthe beach is where this woman lived. And it was very important to my mother to\nthank this woman and let her know that at least one of the children had survived and\nto relieve some of this woman\u2019s guilt. And my mother gave her some -- some\nmoney, some gifts. I don\u2019t know whether my mother had any subsequent contact\nwith her. That must obviously have been an incredibly difficult time. We also had\ncontinued contact with the two priests, one of them I mentioned before, Father\nSchulling, the other one was called Father Lodders, L-o-d-d-e-r-s, and he was --\noh, he was much younger though, Schulling was the older man and Lodders was a\n-- a younger, Jesuit priest. And he would come to visit my mother\u2019s store quite\nfrequently on his motor bike. And I -- I very much remember him also. And in some\nways they -- they also encouraged me in Judaism. Not too many forms, actually, the\n-- you know, is -- I was at my -- my mother took great pride in exposing me in an ha\nAugust 4, 2002\n-- to -- to many different beliefs. It was very important to her, which is really\namazing after what she went through, to -- to have a respect and an understanding\nof other religions. And she would take great pride, for example, at birthday parties\nfor me, in counting around the table how many different religions she had\nrepresented. And there were always very devout Catholics, there were the Madnas,\nwho were probably Moslem in origin. There were the Protestant family from --\nfrom Rijnsburg. And you have to understand that in Holland, Protestants and\nCatholics do not speak to each other. But there they were, all around the table for\nmy birthday. And then there were Jewish members, and some of them were very\nOrthodox Jewish, and my mother took tremendous pride in bringing -- and in the\nconvert Minister. And my mother took tremendous pride in bringing all these\npeople around the table. This was very, very important to her.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t give any money, as far as I know, to the Madnas, or they had th\n-- in other words, there was no money paid for my -- for -- for -- for them sheltering\nme. They did give them some ration cards and ration coupons so that they could\nobtain food for me. There may have been some money, you know, to -- to -- to help\nAugust 4, 2002\ntake care of me, defray expenses, basically. But they certainly weren\u2019t paid, you\nknow, to take care of me. There was no -- no -- no, there was no monetary gain to\nthem.",
        "A: I think it was the same thing. No, it was really -- my sisters, th -- all their\npossessions were taken to them. And again, the most important thing at that time\nwas ration cards, and I remember what they looked like, even. I remember\nimmediately after the war even, you know, when rationing continued, going with\nmy mother to get those ration cards at an -- at an office and standing on line to get\nthem. So I was -- I was very familiar with those.",
        "A: Christmas was the only holiday because I remember the decorations. They had a\nChristmas tree and it was decorated. There were no electric lights, but I remember\nthere were real candles in the -- in -- in the Christmas tree. I\u2019m not entirely sure\nwhether there was one during the war years, or whether the one that I remember\nwas immediately after. I th -- it may have been immediately after when my mother\nwas actually in -- I just remembered that now, is when my mother was actually\nAugust 4, 2002\nliving there with us. She was there at the time, also. So this may -- this -- this may\nhave been the first Christmas, 1945, but I\u2019m not --",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure. Or whether she came back, we came back to stay with them, that\nmay have been, but -- but it\u2019s -- I remember my mother being there for -- for that\nChristmas at -- at -- at the Madnas. And we may have had the trees before. I do\nremember that, you know, seeing the decorations before, but that\u2019s where sort of\nmemories blend into each other.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t play many sp -- any sports, I -- I rode a bicycle, but what I -- my -- th-the\nearliest hobby that I had as a child carried through from the puppet theater. I u -- I\nused to really take the puppet theater to all my friends birthdays an-and have puppet\nplays for them. And then the next phase after that, related to that 1s when I started\nwriting plays, and I started doing that when I was what, about six or seven, as soon\nas I learned how to -- to write. I still have some of those early manuscripts and they\nwere based on stories that my mother told me. And my f-first play was produced in\nelementary school, and I remember taking down my mother\u2019s curtains -- draperies,\nto make -- fashion curtains for my stage. I also had little gifts for the teachers, to get\nAugust 4, 2002\nthem to send their kids in to watch my play. And I\u2019m ashamed to admit it now, but I\nhad little packets of cigarettes and had little samples, soap samples, I remember\nthose, they were in the shape of a hand, because those are things my mother got in\nher store. So those -- I handed those out to entice people to come and watch my\nplay.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nAugust 4, 2002\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Well, this was something that really was encouraged by my mother, who had a\ntremendous love for theater. My mother was also an accomplished painter, but I\ncould never master that, but the writing -- I really did enjoy playwriting. And I also\nlearned public speaking and the way that came about was kind of interesting. When\nwe would go spend our weekends with the family in -- in Rijnsburg, another\nreligious angle, I would also always go to church with the family. And after the\nchurch service I would be able to repeat the sermon that I had heard almost\nverbatim. And so that\u2019s -- that\u2019s really where I learned public speaking, and I\u2019ve --\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed that, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very, very valuable experience I had. But\nthe interesting thing 1s again, that my mother was not afraid to have me exposed to a\nvariety of experiences, and then to know at the same time that my -- my Jewish\nfoundations would remain very, very strong. One more thing in the involvement in\nterms of the Jewish community in -- in The Hague; I mentioned, you know,\nattending services, but there also was a -- a Purim party immediately -- very shortly\nafter the war. My guess is that it would probably have been \u201946 - \u201947 approximately,\nAugust 4, 2002\nprobably more \u201947 because I remember where we lived at the t -- we were living at\nthe time. My mother already had her store, and she would dress me up as a Karen\nKayemet collection box. And I won second prize, actually. First prize was to a girl\nwho was dressed up as a Sabbath queen. And that -- that was a very, very major\nevent. Actually, you know, now -- now that I think about it, prior to this Purim fe --\nfeast, 1t was also an even earlier experience that I had, which was a Hanukkah party\nearlier, because I remember very distinctly the kinds of gifts that we got. And they\nwere not toys, they were not books, they were socks and very common things that\npeople needed immediately after the war. So that -- that probably was -- may have\nbeen the end of \u201945 - \u201946, something like that. As I remember also, related to that,\ngoing with my mother to -- to a place where packages would arrive from overseas,\nand one of my mother\u2019s brothers had survived and escaped to Bolivia and he\narranged for packages to be sent from the United States to us. And I remember\ngoing with my mother to collect those packages.",
        "A: As far as we know, the -- the only person who -- who survived for sure was one\nof my mother\u2019s brothers, Adolf, or Abraham Munzer. And he managed to leave\nGermany on th -- right after, or right around Kristallnacht, and the only country\nthat he could go to was Bolivia. He had married a German woman who converted to\nAugust 4, 2002\nJudaism, and they had one son, Norbert and the three of them managed to escape to\nBolivia. My mother\u2019s sister in Berlin was deported eventually, and -- with her\nfamily, her son Yossi, who was exactly the same age as Norbert, they sort of\nlooked alike, and I have some beautiful photographs of the two of them. But sh --\nthat part of the entire -- of the family was deported and all of the ones who\nremained behind, the immediate family that remi -- remained behind in Rymanow,\nor my father\u2019s side in Kanczuga, they all died at concentration camps. There were\nsome cousins of my mother, an aunt of my mother who survived and we did not\nfind out about that until we came to the United States. But she managed -- she\nsurvived with eight children, which was totally am-amazing, actually.",
        "A: My mother was a member of some Zionist youth organizations, but I don\u2019t know\nhow strong Zionists they were. My mother, you know, did face the choice of after\nthe war, whether we should come to -- go to Israel or come to the United States.\nAnd I know it was a difficult choice for her. A lot of people did mo -- who we had\ncontact with in -- in Holland came -- went to Israel. And it was probably about\nequally divided. But she -- I guess I think she did not -- wasn\u2019t ready for renewed\nhardship and she felt -- and that\u2019s why we ca -- we eventually came to the United\nStates, although that was not so many years later.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Do I think -- no, if things come up we can come back -- we\u2019ll backtrack.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, we moved to Brussels in 1952 and she sold her business in The\nHague and we then remained in Brussels until 1958 when we came to the United\nStates. I attended scho -- my -- my education continued in Brussels and my mother\nmade a decision that the s -- French speaking schools were better than the a -- that\nthe Dutch spe -- the Flemish schools, so initially I went -- this -- this is where I did\ngo to a full time Jewish school actually, called the E-Ecole Israel Elite in -- in\nBrussels. And a little van would pick us up every day, make the rounds and pick up\nthe children for the school. Not a very big school, probably had about a hundred\nstudents is my -- my guess, at most. And I went there for approximately two years\nand then graduated and went to -- in -- in Belgium they call it attenay or it\u2019s li --\nLyc\u00e9e in French, or in France, but basically that\u2019s -- that\u2019s seventh grade. I started\nthe -- the Atheneum School, and that was -- that was not a Jewish school. That was\njust a -- a public high school, in French.",
        "A: It was hard because we had very -- you know, as I said, we had many close\nfriends in Holland. My mother attempted a -- a remarriage, it didn\u2019t work out, she -\nAugust 4, 2002\n- it was someone, a man who was much older than she was. But at the same time,\nthe positive thing that came out of that, we became very, very -- I became very\nclose with his family in -- in Brussels, the Schumer family, and have maintained\nthat friendship to the present day. They were very, very warm, very supportive to\nme and to my mother. Some of the members of the family live here in the United\nStates, lived there at the time, they were coming back and forth between Belgium\nand -- and -- and the United States and others lived in -- in Brussels, actually. And\nthey -- so that became my next family. I also became much more aware of -- of\nJewish things, things Jewish after we moved to Brussels, Brussels had a much\nmore active Jewish community, more synagogues. It even had some, as I said\nbefore, a -- a full time Jewish school that -- that had somehow survived.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where I had my Bar Mitzvah, in -- in Brussels, actually, in a fairly\nsmall synagogue, synagogue that was attached to a -- an old people\u2019s home, nursing\nhome actually. Nursing home or senior citizen home, and that\u2019s where we had the\nBar Mitzvah and it was very, very nice. I do remember that.",
        "A: Fair number. Not -- not a great number of friends. The friends of the Schumer\nfamily, they were all there, but I -- we had some neighbors were friends, but ah,\nAugust 4, 2002\nJewish community even in -- in -- in Brussels was fairly small, so certainly I did\nnot have many, many friends. But nothing again, that seemed out of the ordinary f-\nfor me, simply because that\u2019s the way things were in Holland, you know, we\nweren\u2019t -- it was much more of -- of a -- of a shock really, coming to the United\nStates and becoming aware of the intensity of Jewish life and J-Jewish community.\nThat, you know, was just -- it\u2019s a totally different scale.",
        "A: I did not enjoy the Jewish day school particularly, I don\u2019t know why. It was -- I -\n- | just did not particularly get along well with my teachers. It\u2019s the only school\nexperience that I had that was negative, and I don\u2019t know why it -- why that was\nparticularly. I had a very good experience subsequently in the -- in the Belgian\nschool, the Atheneum. And did very wer -- well, even though French was a new\nlanguage to me, but still, you know, did very well. But there was some anti-\nSemitism there. It was very -- it was kind of subtle. There were several Jewish\nstudents in my class in the Atheneum, and we had religious -- Jewish religious\ninstruction in the public school. There\u2019s no separation of church and state in\nBelgium. And so the -- the probl -- the -- the s -- religion is handled differently.\nPeople -- students basically pick what religion -- religious instruction they want to\nAugust 4, 2002\nattend. So it could be protest -- they could go to a Protestant class, Catholic class,\nJewish class, or one that was called ethics. And I did go to -- to a class with a Mr.\nDeener, and I think, you know, the entire class we only had two or three students at\nany one time because there were so few Jews 1n the class. But then one time -- I did\nnot -- there were classes on Saturday mornings, that was part of the regular school\nweek, and I did not go to those classes on Saturday mornings, and I remember --\nand the principal, you know, contacted my mother and said that I -- I was in danger\nof failing, you know, because, you know, the Jewish students, you know, were --\nwere staying away on Saturday morning. And that didn\u2019t happen, the Jewish\nstudents graduated, you know, near the top of the class. But there was a -- that little\nbit, definitely. Anti-Semitism actually, hadn\u2019t thought of this, but certainly was\nprevalent also in Holland, and I -- I remember when I was walking back from\ncheder being pursued by kids yelling dirty Jew and things like that, or the\nequivalent in Dutch. Was -- Jew with glasses was the term, I can\u2019t translate it, burla\nyout. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- that was a very common thing. So there was -- there\nwas a fair amount --",

        "A: Definitely. We talked about 1t and my mother had similar experiences, actually.\nOne time she -- we were on -- in line to go to a -- a movie and the newsreels. And I\ndon\u2019t know, someone noticed my mother\u2019s number and made a remark about, well\nthere\u2019s one they didn\u2019t get. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- there was still anti-Semitism after the\nwar, certainly, in -- in -- in Holland and in Belgium.",
        "A: Well, in ninet -- I stayed -- I -- my mother stayed in Belgium til 1958. I stayed in\nBelgium til 1956. I had gone to summer came in Belgium in a -- a summer camp\nsponsored by yeshiva. I\u2019d been to several summer camps, but the last one I went to\nwas one sponsored by a -- aj -- a -- a yeshiva, actually, near Antwerp. And they\nencouraged my mother to send me to a yeshiva full time. I was not getting along\nwith the man my mother had remarried and so that was one solution. And plus the\nfact that, you know, I was really encouraged. So we -- I went to a school in France,\na yeshiva in France in a town called [indecipherable] and my mother took me\nthere in -- in 1956 and that was a very, very wonderful experience, actually, a very,\nvery positive experience. An extremely warm, caring atmosphere",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s just the facts, you know, that I did really\nda -- did make many changes, and somehow this -- this was a very, very different\natmosphere. Obviously this was a very Orthodox yeshiva. It was -- the -- the head\nof the yeshiva was from Lithuania. He was a student of the Chofetz Chaim, so it\nwas -- you know. But I -- somehow managed to fit in very -- fairly quickly. Again,\nmade very, very good friends very quickly. And took charge actually of the --\nvolunteered to take charge of the infirmary, that was my first inkling of becoming a\ndoctor. You know, all the students had different chores and my chores were in the\ninfirmary.",
        "A: No, I chose. So that was the first time that I made, you know, the choice that I --\nultimately I was going to be a physician. Th-The school was sort of -- had -- had\nstudents from -- half the students were Ashkenazi and the other half were\nSephardic from Morocco and Algeria. And so they -- that created -- there was an\ninteresting dynamic. That was a whole different exposure again because they spoke\nArabic, in addition to French and so to resolve that dilemma, the -- the head of the\nschool actually decreed that were two languages that could not be spoken. One was\nYiddish and the other one was Arabic, they were forbidden. And also, all the\nstudying, everything was done in French as a result of that, which was very, very\nAugust 4, 2002\ndifficult for the head of the school, because his -- his French was -- was atrocious.\nBut he was a very, very nice man who had been imprisoned during the war years.\nHis name was Haim Haiken. And he died in er -- a very advanced age, in early\n90\u2019s.",
        "A: I was there for two years, and --",
        "A: I stayed in touch with the Madnas. I can\u2019t remember specifically whether during\nthat time I went to visit them. I think I did. I did go back to visit my mother, you\nknow, several times and finally, just before we left in -- in early July, after I had\ntaken some ex -- my exams, my final exams, which in -- in fr -- in France at th -- at\nthat stage are fairly elaborate. You have to go to a different city and be -- take an\noral exam, a written exam and then an oral exam by teachers from different parts of\nthe country to make sure it\u2019s absolutely honest. Well, anyway, I passed that exam\nand then there was -- you know, then I left the Yeshiva and for f -- to go to the\nUnited States. Basically, my mother never told the man that she had remarried to\nthat she was leaving, she just packed up her things and we met, actually. We\narranged to meet in Ebensee where my father was buried. I took the train from\nAugust 4, 2002\nFrance and she took the train from Belgium. And we met a little town called Bad\nIschl, which is very close to Ebensee. We met actually because of all the coupling,\nuncoupling of the trains, I remember meeting on the train and my mother was being\n-- walked from one end of the train, I walked from the other. And we went on to\nBad Ischl, stayed there overnight and then the following morning took the train to\nEbensee to visit my father\u2019s grave. My mother wanted to be sure that I saw it\nbefore we left for the United States. And then -- that\u2019s the first time that I really\nshed tears over my father. I remember very distinctly crying at the grave. The\nreality of my father had really -- and of his death had really never quite registered.\nYou know, it was -- it was like a page in a book, it wasn't -- I had sort of -- was\ndetached from it. But standing there at the grave and knowing that\u2019s where my\nfather was buried was incredibly -- an incredible experience and I -- I did cry. And\nwe -- we left Ebensee and Bad Ischl and stayed my mother\u2019s -- stayed -- I stayed\nwith my mother for a few days in a town called Bad Nauheim in Germany and\nthen from there went to Rotterdam and met up with the Madna family and the\nRavensbergan family from Rijnsburg and some other friends of my mother, close\nfriends of my mother from The Hague, and who saw us off on the Ryndam and we\nleft for the United States.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: I had been -- I was scared of the United States, especially when we were in this\nspa at bel -- in -- in -- 1n -- in -- in Germany called Bad Nauheim. There was a\nwoman who sat at our table who was there from the United States and she told me\nthat I\u2019d better toughen up, that all the kids here were extremely rough and that I was\ngoing to have a very hard time. And so I was -- I was -- frankly, I was scared. I\ndidn\u2019t know what I was going to encounter. You know, I\u2019d certainly seen cowboy\nmovies also, and that\u2019s what I expected the United States to be like. And I -- it was\na very different experience, very positive when we arrived.",
        "A: No, because I knew that this situation in Brussels was really not tenable. At one\npoint I actually -- we had even planned on going to Canada. The reason we didn\u2019t\ngo to the United States earlier is because it took that many years to obtain a visa,\nbecause of the quota system. And so we have -- we had applied for a visa to go to\nCanada in about 1954 or so, but then there was a flood in Holland, and -- I may be\noff somewhat on my years, and all of a sudden we were told that the -- that I had --\nthat there was a visa for me to go to -- to th -- the United States opened the Dutch\nAugust 4, 2002\nquota basically, because of the floods. And so I got a visa and my mother assumed\nthat she had one too, and she didn\u2019t know about the visas being by national origin.\nSo she did not -- was not able to come t -- [indecipherable] to the United States.\nBut that\u2019s -- as a result of that, we dropped our pla -- we had dropped our plans to\ngo to Canada and -- so I was prepared for the change to come to the United States.\nI had also -- I'd gotten different warnings. I also -- the -- my -- my si -- teachers at\nthe yeshiva and the older, more senior students, you know, warned me, said that the\nUnited States was extremely materialistic and I shouldn\u2019t forget the things I had\nlearned over there, you know, that -- and that one of the -- the lessons that I should\ntake back from the war was that material objects were really not that important.\nThere were more important things in life. School over there was very, very much\ngeared towards the Mussar ethical movement and was very, very valuable. So I\nwas prepared for the worst in many ways when we came to the United States, but\ninstead, I think both of us really adapted quite well. We -- my mother purposely had\nbooked a trip on -- that was fairly long because she -- she looked on this as kind of a\n-- a vacation. So our -- our trip to the United States took about 10 days. The ship\nmade stops in Ireland and France, Halifax, Canada before finally arriving in -- in\nHoboken, New York. And in Hoboken we were met by someone from the HIAS,\nAugust 4, 2002\nMrs. Citrin.

        "A: Very, very little. I had taken English as my second foreign language which --\nwhich was really bare bones, was twice a week for about two years, so it was very,\nvery little. But there was this -- this very swaggering woman, very, very different\nfrom -- yeah, the -- the very quiet European women we -- and that was -- that was\nintere -- and then we -- we took the taxi to -- to -- to Brooklyn and joined -- and\nstayed with the Vanderpool family, who had -- since they originally -- they 1-\ninitially had lived in Williamsburg when they came to the United States. Hela\nVanderpool had a job actually, in a matzo baking factory. And then finally, you\nknow, they -- they moved to a nicer part of Brooklyn. We moved in with them for a\nshort period and got our own apartment.",
        "A: I very distinctly re -- remember seeing the Statue of Liberty for the first time.\nYou know, we were having breakfast on the ship and there it was, and really -- it --\nit si -- it did symbolize a tremendous amount. The other thing that really struck us\nas -- as we got off -- as we were on the boat watching, you know, being processed\nAugust 4, 2002\non the boat, was they were -- the dockworkers were unloading things from the ship\nand that the dockworkers were wearing leather -- were wearing protective gloves.\nThat was one thing that really struck us. The second thing that struck us, that on this\nbig loading platform at one point, they brought -- they dropped a newspaper and\ncontainers of coffee for the workers. And this was very, very different from\nworking conditions in -- in Holland at the time. And that -- those two things, the\nnewspaper, especially, and the cups of coffee and the leather gloves, the protective\ngloves, somehow struck us as being very special and showing that -- you know, that\nthings were much, much better in the United States. The other -- very shortly after\nour arrival, we also -- we started looking for permanent places to live and -- which\nis quite an adventure. We ended up in some of the worst neighborhoods of -- of -- of\nBrooklyn before we finally found a place, but -- and my mother had to look for\nwork. And I remember visiting the offices. I think it was either the HIAS, or there\nwas another organization called New Americans, which was -- and this was on\nBeekman Place in -- in New York, not far from Wall Street. And I remember one\nof the first things we visited was -- was Trinity Church and -- and the graveyard,\nand how impressed we were to see this old graveyard next to Wall Street over these\n-- these skyscrapers. That was also a very, very positive impression. And we both\nfeel -- felt -- my mother, I know, felt liberated. She really is the one who wanted to\nAugust 4, 2002\nleave behind the memories of Europe. She found Europe extremely confining. The\nmemories were bad, but in addition to that, she -- she did not -- she did not like\nbeing referred to as the widow Munzer, which was how women were still regarded,\nsingle women, widowed women in -- in -- in Europe were still regarded at that\ntime. Whereas here in the United States she could get a job and make a living, and\nshe would just be like anybody else.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",

There were some people who -- these were two family, two si -- houses and\nwe took an apartment next door to them. And we stayed there for several years and\nthen moved to an o -- to a larger apartment a little bit further away. My mother,\nalmost immediately got -- got work, went to work in the -- the ladies\u2019 garment\nbusiness, basically. She made -- she had a variety of jobs. One of them was making\nhats, all sorts of things, til she finally got as -- a job that she kept for a long period\nof time, which was working as a t -- at a tailor in a -- in a women\u2019s store. The\nAugust 4, 2002\nreason she took that particular job, which was on Williams Street, again, and Wall\nStreet, was because it was closed on Shabbas.

        "A: Yeah, I had no -- no problems in spite of, you know, malnutrition. I\u2019m told that\nthere\u2019s some dental problems, probably from early, you know, development that\nmay be related to that. My mother was concerned about my health early on, but\nthere really weren't any -- any problems. After we came to the United States,\nstarted looking for a school for me and I enrolled actually at -- I -- we -- we\nexplored one of the more religious inst -- yeshiva, Yeshiva Torah Vodaath in -- in\n-- in Brooklyn. But that was in a -- in a -- in a very ver -- bad neighborhood and my\nmother wanted -- but by then I was beginning to think really of -- of eventually\ngoing to medical school. And so my mother really wanted me to go to a school that\nwas more progressive. That\u2019s why I went to Yeshiva University High School in\nAugust 4, 2002\nBrooklyn. And it was a -- that was a very -- it was a difficult move because I knew\n-- spoke very, very little English. And I must say that the school was not supportive.\nNo one at the school asked any questions about how I had survived, how my mother\nsurvived. It -- it\u2019s unfortunately left a sour taste in my -- in my mouth. The students\nwere very, very friendly and the students were very interested in my past. And I still\nhave an article that they wrote for the school newspaper, actually an interview about\nmy experiences in Europe. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- but the adults were just -- I -- I -- for\nwhatever reason, no one wants to talk about. The only person who really asked us\nabout our survival, how we had survived, it was very interesting, it was someone\nwho wasn\u2019t Jewish. It was when my mother went to open up a bank account at\nManufacturer\u2019s Trust.

That was -- but\nthat was unique. Most people -- there were some other people, obviously, who had\nbeen through similar experiences we talked to. We went to a small synagogue,\nRabbi Moshe Weiss, and he had lost much of his own family and certainly we were\nvery close with him and we talked with him. But other than that, certainly at\nYeshiva University High School there was no -- there was no talk about the\nHolocaust at all. And I -- I was asked to take every single Regent\u2019s exam for the\nAugust 4, 2002\nentire four years of high school in that one year because they were afraid really of --\nof giving me a diploma without doing that, so I did. But it -- I -- the unfortunate\nthing is that it\u2019s probably as a result of that experience that I did not go -- did not\nattend Yeshiva University. I was interviewed there and would have gone there, but\nended up going to Brooklyn College. And that\u2019s where I graduated from\neventually. And that was a very good experience. And the interesting thing is that\nover there there were the beginnings of talk. At least there were other foreign\nstudents and there was some interest.

And Papa Madna was as protective of me\nas he had ever been. I had never been to -- to Amsterdam, actually. My mother had\nalways said negative things about Amsterdam, she sa -- basically she said my\nfather did not like Amsterdam, it was too noisy and that\u2019s why he lived -- they\nlived in -- in The Hague. And so, as a result of that, I had never gone to\nAmsterdam. And I decided that on this trip I was going to go to Amsterdam and\nPapa Madna again, almost completely dissuaded me from going altogether, then\nscared me so much that I went there for one day and then came right back t-to him.\nAnd -- but that\u2019s -- that still 1s the -- the -- the influence. You -- you asked earlier\nAugust 4, 2002\nabout whether my mother was -- was protective. I have the sense -- I had the sense\nreally that 1-in many ways he was more protective of me than she was. That was\nvery, very special. And he -- he had remarried in 1947, and I was very, very close\nwith this second wife. And they had three children, Vonny, Tol\u00e9 and Matipah. And\nI was very, very close with all three of them, and remain close with them to this\nday.

We had a -- a\nwondert -- we had -- we visited the museum together and the importance of a\nmuseum and of a memorial suddenly hit me.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever really felt anger. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very interesting.\nWhen Joel and I went to Austria, for example, he was much angrier than I was. I\nwas able to speak and converse with people without, you know, difficulty. We had\nAugust 4, 2002\none very special experience there. We were staying again in the town, the same\ntown where I stayed with my mother, Bad Ischl, and we had ma -- made\nreservations 1n a -- in an inn, and the woman who was the innkeeper, when we\narrived told us that she had made a mistake. She said, you know, you\u2019re going to\nhave to change rooms tomorrow morning because of some mistake I\u2019ve made in the\nreservations. And I told her that would be very difficult because we were going to\ntake a train first thing in the morning to visit my father\u2019s grave in Ebensee. And the\nwoman told me that her family -- she burst out in tears and she says, you know, my\nfamily is from Ebensee and I am so ashamed. And we hugged, and that -- that was\ntruly an incredible experience. But Joel would not -- would barely look out the train\nwindow. He -- he could not bring himself to say anything positive about Austria,\nand couldn\u2019t wait to get away. That\u2019s one reason we did not -- this was around my -\n- the time of my father\u2019s Yahrzeit and so we visited Ebensee and then from there,\ninstead of going to Vienna, we went to Prague and said Kaddish in the Altneu\nshul.",

Apparently\nthat has changed and now there is -- there is -- 1t\u2019s been -- there\u2019s mo-more talk\nabout the Dutch Nazi party.

I told him, I said, you know,\nFlatow is not a very common name, and I worked with a gentleman many, many\nyears ago who was a -- was from Germany, a German refugee and whose last name\nwas Flatow, Anzd Flatow, and he said -- and he worked as a translator and I\nworked in the same translation bureau in -- in New York while I was in college.\nAnd he -- he said, gee, you know, he has a grandfather the same name, but his\ngrandfather was a lawyer and to his knowledge never worked in the translation\nbureau. Then he asked his father and it turned out to be the same Anzd Flatow. And\nwe worked together at the Lawyers and Merchants Translation Bureau in New\nYork. And he was, you know, had escaped from Germany in 1944 and was a\nlawyer. Obviously couldn\u2019t do any work as a lawyer in the United States, so he\ntook this job as a translator. So the -- the connections are many, once you begin\ntalking.\nAugust 4, 2002",

She\njust -- she thought that I was too, quote, honest, and that -- you know, that that -- so\nshe wanted me to be -- to be -- she also thought that that would be a natural way to\nacquire a family, in a sense. But she was basically, as to a large extent on -- on the\nrespect that rabbis have in -- in Europe, especially. When we came to the United\nStates she realized that -- that rabbis do not necessarily have it all that easy here,\nand that congregations can be very difficult. So anyway, but -- but -- I had really\nnever considered that that much. It was a -- was a brief consideration. The oth -- the\nother place where that came from, being a rabbi was, strangely enough, the family\nthat we used to visit in -- in Rijnsburg, in Holland and who would take me to\nchurch and then I would repeat the sermons and one of the women there would say\noh, he\u2019s going to become a preacher and then the other one would say, no, he\u2019s\ngoing to become a rabbi. And so that was -- that was one of the early things. But it\nAugust 4, 2002\nwas -- those were the two professions that I really considered seriously. But from --\nfrom my standpoint it was really all -- I -- I can\u2019t remember. Maybe it was when I\nwas really sick as a child and had the ruptured appendix. That\u2019s, I think, when I\nreally made up my mind that I was going to become a physician. But my\nexperiences of -- of -- certainly of having had my life given to me in a -- in a very\ndirect sense by -- by the Madna family, I would say probably it has had a major\nimpact, not just on becoming a physician but also volunteering my time. When I\npicked a specialty it was one where I -- I knew I could have a wider -- I wanted one\nwhere I could have a wider impact. And so I chose lung disease because lung\ndisease is so much related to -- to an -- the environment, it\u2019s related to smoking and\nI became very active in the American Lung Association and eventually served as --\nas president of the American Lung Association, nationally, and also received their\nWill Ross medal a few years ago, which 1s their highest volunteer honor. So at --\nit\u2019s -- that certainly -- and it, interestingly enough, at that ceremony the story, the\nMadna story was told very, very prominently and to -- to an audience of thousands\nof people. And the Madnas received a standing ovation. They weren\u2019t there, but\nyou know, just -- it was -- 1t was extremely moving. So my past, my experiences\ncertainly have been a very important part of forming my life and of determining the\nkind of person I am. And I guess it\u2019s possible for that, depending on the\nAugust 4, 2002\nexperiences, to be positive or negative and I\u2019m very fortunate that in my case, it was\nvery positive.",
        "A: I -- I really haven\u2019t. You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very, very interesting. To me, this\nseemed like the most natural thing to do. You know, recently at -- when I was at\nAdas Israel at a service, it was a -- a young girl who had a Bat Mitzvah who came\nhere from Russia, and th-the rabbi mentioned all the languages she spoke and all\nthe things she had done and then he had asked her, you know, how did this happen,\nhow -- how is this possible? And she said, it\u2019s normal. And those words really stuck\nbecause that\u2019s -- that\u2019s probably what describes the way I look on -- on what the\nMadnas did.

So I felt, you know, I was becoming -- but nonetheless, you\nknow, that -- that\u2019s -- the touch, the warmth of being with her was very, very\nimportant. And you know, s -- even the number was very, very impor -- she didn\u2019t\nlike to look at it, but for me, you know, it brought back a lot of memories. And --\nand -- and I -- it was totally amazing to me how my -- what my mother\u2019s attitude\nwas towards life after the war. I -- I -- to this day cannot understand that. My\nmother could speak with joy about her childhood in Poland, in Rymanow. Talking\nabout, you know, the policemen called bambula and -- and all of the places where,\nyou know, they -- the kids would go out to play and then -- and I have a very, very\nvivid picture, actually, of the town. She could talk to me about, you know,\nexperiences in the concentration camps when she put on plays with other prisoners\nand sh -- and portraying Hitler. And then after the war, beginning -- starting a life\nover again, I would hear her cry at night at times, certainly, in the first few years.\nShe would be very -- sometimes she would accidentally refer to me by my father\u2019s\nname and that was a very frightening thing. But somehow, you know, she was\n102August 4, 2002\nalways very cheerful. You know, when I was little and she had her store, after she\nclosed the store we would take very, very long walks to the park and she would race\nme to the park. She took me to the theater. You know, every Su-Sunday there was\nalways something. We either went to a museum, we went to -- to a play, we went to\n-- J-] -- I remember the very first time I went to a -- a -- a Jewish dance company. I\nwas probably seven years old or so, and I -- I still remember it to this day because I\nremember putting on a performance in the store window afterwards. It\u2019s really --\nher -- her introduction of me to the theater. And then she picked up painting again.\nSomehow, being able to enjoy life and to continue to really enjoy life 1s -- is just --\nwithout f -- ever forgetting what happened, my sisters or my father, 1s -- 1s beyond\nme. I don\u2019t know where -- where that strength came from. And I was a very f -- I\nfeel very glad to have had my mother for so many years.",
        "A: I tend to the liberal side, I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s really related, except that\npeople have responsibility for each other. That is -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s an important part\nof -- of certainly my outlook, politically. And -- but other than that I don\u2019t think it\nhas had a direct bearing. I certainly do not consider myself, you know, a -- a far\nright, or a -- no, not at all, I think.\nAugust 4, 2002",
        "A: Certainly I think it has -- it has made Israel all the more important to me. I\nrealize the role of Israel really as a refu -- as an ultimate refuge is very, very\nimportant. At the same time I\u2019ve also come to appreciate recently, more recent -- in\nrecent years, the importance of the United States as a place of refuge. And I really\ndo feel very, very positive about the United States. I think the -- the ability to\naccommodate the diversity of beliefs of peoples. You know, we may have many\nproblems and there may be anti-Semitism here and there may be f -- there may have\nbeen oppression of -- of African Americans, Latinos, and negative things said. But\nin the end, I think, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of positive in the United States.\nAnd I feel very good about being here and being an American. Hadn\u2019t really\nthought about that very much, but I do.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m told that the Madna family was recognized within Holland, actually.\nThere was a ceremony held by -- by the queen. I don\u2019t know an -- too many details\nabout that. But I\u2019ve also submitted the family history to Yad Vashem and hopefully\nin the near future, they will also be honored at Yad Vashem.\n104August 4, 2002",
        "A: At Adas -- yeah, at Adas Israel we had a wonderful ceremony in the garden.\nThere is a Garden of the Righteous at Adas Israel, where every year a -- a righteous\nfamily that was responsible for saving Jews is honored. And this year the Madna\nfamily was honored, and that was an incredible experience for me. Not just the\nimmediate ceremony, which was beautiful, but because it gave me a chance to\nspeak to -- altogether I figured out there were close to a thousand schoolchildren.\nAll the schoolchildren at Adas Israel, plus all the s-schoolchildren at the Jewish\nDay School heard the Madna\u2019s story with slides, with pictures. And many of the s -\n- children wrote letters to the Madna family and I think that -- that was incredibly\nexper -- an incredible experience, very, very positive for me, and -- and -- and for\nma -- for Rob Madna and I think the rest of the family as well. I also, again realize\nthe importance of a monument, as when I came there to visit with one of the ma --\nrecently with the Madna grand -- one of the Madna grandchildren and they took\ntremend -- he took tremendous pride in seeing the name inscribed, the Madna\nfamily. And we took a nice photograph there and then after that, we went to visit the\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and I -- | -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s the next generation now\ncoming up. We talk about the Jewish next generation needing to keep the Holocaust\nin mind and not to forget the Holocaust, but I think it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s even more important\n105August 4, 2002\nthat the next generation of the heroes also, that they are remembered for generations\nto come.",
