        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Manfred Gans,\nconducted by Amy Reuben on November 11\", 2004, in Fort Lee, New Jersey. This is tape\nnumber one, side A. Mr. Gans, would you please start by telling me your full name, and where\nand when you were born?",
        "Answer: Okay, my name is Manfred Gans. I was born in a little town in West Germany near the\nDutch frontier, the name of that town 1s Borken, it\u2019s -- at the time it used to be called Borken in\nWestfarn -- in Westphalia. And I was born in there on the 27\" of April, 1922. My father\u2019s family\nhad lived in that town at least since 1610. The town records showed that his -- the fa -- his -- his\nmother\u2019s family, by the name of Windmiller, were allowed to live inside the walled city of that\ntown in 1610, which was very exceptional, because Jews generally were not allowed within\nwalled ci -- cities.",
        "Q: Do you know why, perhaps, it --",
        "A: No, I can -- can\u2019t remember why, exactly what the reason was why -- but -- why they were\nallowed to live there. But basically Jews had lived in that area, or in that town since sometime --\nsomething like 1246. The exact history of the Jewish community has been reworked now, and is\nfully available in the -- in a group that has been formed in -- since 1988 in that town, who -- a\nsmall group of people who have occupied themselves with the history of the Jews. And they\nhave fabulous documents about everything. So if you have to clear up something, this 1s where\nyou can go, and anybody who wants to research the subject should go to these -- to these people.",
        "Q: How large a Jewish community was there when you were living there?",
        "A: There were -- about 25 Jewish families lived in the town itself. And there were Jewish\nfamilies in every -- all the little villages around it. The town was a -- you know, was the county\nseat, and the -- all these other Jew -- little Jewish communities in the villages, some of them had\ntheir own synagogues, but none of them had schools. And -- so everybody had to come to -- to p\n-- all the Jewish children had to come to Borken for the Jewish schools. We -- oh, I had one towa\n-- want to mention one more thing which I -- this third thing is very important. So the Jews in a --\n1-in effect, had lived in this town for 750 years. And though it was a free town, that means it was\n-- it was -- it had -- it was an independent town, which could make its own decisions, my father\nwas the only Jew who was ever elected into the town council. There have been no Jews before\nthat, and no Jews, of course, since that -- since itch -- there are no Jews living in the town now.\nEverybody emigrated, or perished in the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Well tell me, if you would, tell me your father\u2019s name, and when was he part of this council,\nand maybe you could tell me a little bit more about him, and your mother?",
        "A: Okay. My father\u2019s name was Maurice Gans. He was born in 1885, and he went to -- like a --\nall the Jewish kids in na -- in -- in the town, he went into the Jewish school for the first four years\nof his schooling, which we can suppo -- suppose we can calculate when that was. And then, at\nthe age of 10, he went into the high school, which actually was a larger, Catholic school. And he\ngraduated from there at the age of, I think about 16. He did -- he did not finish up as a full\nmatriculation because there -- there was certain stages. And from there on s -- from then he -- he\nwent into the textile trade, and he was an apprentice in a wholesale textile ware -- company in\nFrankfurt, 1-1-in -- in Germany. He -- when World War One broke out, he was a -- drafted into\nthe German army. He was in Italy, and his unit was continuously short of food, and supplies, and\nhe made it his business to go into the Italian towns and get provisions there. And coming back\nfrom one of those expeditions, a -- a -- he was shot at by his own people, who hadn\u2019t recognized\nhim, and as a result he lost a leg, and as a result of a big loss of blood, he lost a lung, and so he --\nhis whole like -- life from there on, he had only one leg, and one lung. He was extremely brave.\nHe was lucky that he was sent to a Jewish home for recuperation in Switzerland because of\nhaving lost the lung. Of course the -- you know what -- the --the -- the -- he was treated as if he\nhad tuberculosis, which he did not have, and there he got involved in founding a Jewish\nrecuperation home. I think it was called Itania, which was Orthodox and had kosher food and all\nthose -- those things. When he eventually returned to his hometown, he set up his own company,\nand my mother was his partner. Now, ma -- tell you a little bit about my mother, because she had\na totally different background.",
        "Q: Actually, and -- first tell me when he was elected to the town council, cause you said that was\nsuch an unusual occurrence.",
        "A: Yeah, he was -- I think he was elected to the town council only in -- either in 1930 -- 1930 or\n\u00b031. Then, of course when -- when the -- when the -- there were so many elections just before the\nHitler period, and he of -- he was the chairman of the social democ -- democratic party in town.\nWhen the social democratic party was reduced to only one representative in the town council, I --\nmy father decided that his non-Jewish social democratic -- what trying to say?",
        "Q: A colleague of his, or --",
        "A: A colleague -- colleague should stay, rather than he. And so that he was out of it. Now, how\ndid he get into this position that people voted for him? When he returned to the town, after\nWorld War One, and set up his own business, he also took a very active part in the league of war\norphans, widows. And -- I\u2019m trying to find a -- find a English wor -- when people who had been\ninjured in the war, there was a -- a -- a league like that, and he beca -- soon became the head of\nthat league. He had his staff work on all the applications which were necessary so that these war\norphans, war widows, and people who had -- war injured could apply to the various government\noffices for the support to which they were entitled. And he never charged anybody for all these\nservices, and therefore he became very, very popular. His staff was -- his office staff, which was\nconcerned, of course with wholesale textiles, was a-accustomed to service the members of the\nleague of war orphans, widows, and people who had been injured in the war. Oh, I also started to\ntell about my mother\u2019s family, right? My mother\u2019s family lived in a little town called Falksen,\nwhich was near Hannover. And my grandfather, Maurice Frankel, had come from somewhere in\nthe Brunswick area, Braunschweig at the time. He had set up his own business, and this is a\ntown, he was a total free thinker, didn\u2019t believe in organized religion at all. But -- and his wife,\nmy grandmother had the same attitude, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they were hiding the fact that\nthey were Jews, they were not at all hiding, but they just didn\u2019t believe in organized religion.\nTheir ideal were opera, and theater, German [indecipherable] you know, that sort of thing. In\nfact, one of the sisters of my grandfather was an actress in Hannover, and she was a paramour of\nthe king of Hannover. She was very good looking. Even I remember her, though vaguely. And of\ncourse, I\u2019ve seen pictures of her. So, it was totally different type of upbringing, but nevertheless\nmy mother also had to go to Hebrew school two or three times a week, in -- this was a town\ncalled Springer, which was a -- probably only about four or five miles away. There -- you know,\nin those days of course there were plenty of trains. They went to and fro by train all the time. So\nshe too had a smattering of Jewish education. And then when she finished elementary school, her\nparents sent her to a finishing school, to Belgium, a Jewish finishing school where essentially\nladies learned to be good housewife, and as a result my mother was an outstanding cook, very\nmuch oriented towards the French cuisine, which she had learned in -- in Belgium. For a short\nwhile, she actually worked, after the [indecipherable] she -- she was a -- a companion lady or\nwhatever you call this, in the house of Rosensweig, was a German philosopher, Jewish\nphilosopher who -- who -- usually his name is connected with Buber, who was in -- who was --\nwho was later on a professor in -- 1n Israel, at the [indecipherable] university. Of course, Franz\nRosensweig was at that time already very sick. He had contact -- contract-tacted syphilis while\nhe was in the German army in -- in Poland. And sa -- but he was an outstanding thinker, and ve-\nvery famous in his interpretation of general philosophy and Judaism.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s your -- what was your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Else Frankel. E -- E-l-s-e Frankel. Now --",
        "Q: And when was she born?",
        "A: She was, I think, five years younger than my father, so she must have been what, 18 - 19, yes.",
        "Q: Sol tell me a little bit about the home then, that they had for you, as you were growing up. Try\nto give me a picture of what the -- what that, you know, how your daily life was like at home,\nand of course, could you mention, you know, the siblings who -- who are your siblings.",
        "Q: Okay. I only vaguely remember the house in which we lived during the -- during the first\nthree years of my life. That house is not in existence any more now, but I know exactly where it\nwas, it was near the railway station in Borken. And my parents just rented an apartment th-there.\nNow, my father was very successful in business, he was a -- always a financial genius. And --\nand I think in the year 19 -- yeah, \u201935, just before my younger brother was born, he bought a very\nstately house, just outside the town of Borken, which had been built by a man who was the\nowner of a brick factory once, th-therefore they had -- they hadn\u2019t -- not spared any -- any\nexpenses, any bricks, or anything like that. That house is still in existence now, and it\u2019s still an\noutstanding house, up to the -- up to the sis -- da -- this day. And it still has a lot of the features\nwhich it had when we lived in it. At the time when my parents bought it, and it was not\ndeveloped around it, gradually they, you know, they planted trees and bushes, and things like\nthat. So we had two maids as servants, we had people looking after the vegetable gardens, and\nafter the flower gardens. And above all, my father had a chauffeur, since he couldn\u2019t drive\nhimself. He was always on the road for -- during the whole week. Usually he came back at night,\nsometimes he did not come back at night, but he usually came back at night and then went out\nagain in the morning, into the rural district, to sell the specialty textiles to people who make\ncustom clothing. So it -- it -- it -- 1 -- it wa-was certainly upper class. I think we had a higher\nstandard of living than anything I have achieved since then, or my brothers have achieved since\nthen. My older brother was called Karl, and he -- he was two years older than I. He\u2019s still alive\nnow, he lives in Israel. Now he\u2019s called Gashom Kadar. He\u2019s changed his name during wor --\nWorld War Two, when he was serving 1n a mixed Arab Jewish unit in the British army. And my\nyounger brother, his name was Tayol, and when he went -- went -- went to Israel in 1950 -- let\nme see, he went to Israel in 1952. He too changed his name from Gans to Kadar. I have to excuse\nmyself.",
        "Q: Okay, if you could just continue to tell me about your life in your childhood home, and was it\na very festive life with your family? Tell me a little bit about the sort of routines that you had,\nyou know, as a family, and at home.",
        "A: Well the routine obviously was we go to school every day. Until the age of 10, we went to the\nJewish school, Jewish elementary school, where we learned both the secular subjects and the\nbasic parts of the Jewish service, including the translation of the five books of Moses and things\nlike that. So w-we had a systematic education in learning classical Hebrew. Then, at the age of\n10, since our parents were well enough to do to -- they could send us to high school, we shifted\nover to the high school. Now, th -- the routine at home was that we\u2019d all be in school until about\none o\u2019clock and then came home and had the -- the main meal of the day. In the afternoon we\nwere supposed to do our homework. Had some sort of other activities, we were essentially free.\nAnd the -- the -- yeah, the up -- of c-course it\u2019s -- is a -- home was essentially Orthodox. Not --\nwe wouldn\u2019t call this strictly Orthodox, call it like the modern Orthodox in the United States now\nhere. And Friday evenings we would go to the service. After the service there would be a very\nfestive meal. My -- my father would be home most of the time on s -- on Friday -- on the\nweekends. Saturday morning we would go to synagogue again. The synagogue would finish at\nabout half past 10, 11 o\u2019clock. We then would go home and have a very festive breakfast, and\nafter that we were obligated to go and visit our grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, who was living\nin town. And at that time she was beginning to be about 75 - 80 years old. And we had to visit\nher every Saturday. And after that we\u2019d go back to synagogue for the afternoon service, a --\nwhich was at about one o\u2019clock, and about two o\u2019clock was the main meal, and in the evening at\nthe end of the -- of the holiday, or Saturday, we would again go to synagogue and participated\nwhat\u2019s called the Havdalah service. So, it was a -- a life that revol-revolved largely around the\nJewish religion. On Sunday we had to go to Sunday school, which was strictly devoted to\nHebrew and Jewish history. The Jewish elementary school was a one room school with eight\ngrades in it. Of course, we who -- whose parents were well off and could afford to send us to the\nhigh school only stayed in it for four years. But there were people -- Jewish kids in the school\nwho -- whose parents could not afford to send them to high school, and who did all the eight\ngrades in the -- in the one room school, this was a one room school. Which was very interesting\nbecause it -- it almost was like self education. There was only one teacher, and h-he would attend\nto all -- to everybody, set tasks for everybody. But when he taught history, or when he taught\nsomething to somebody else, of course you could always listen in. And I think [indecipherable]\nthat was very, very good for our development. That\u2019s in my -- in my days, the name of that first\nteacher we had, his name was Gunsberg, and he became an outstanding person in the\n[indecipherable] s-service, or [indecipherable] organization in Israel, when he finally em-\nemigrated to Israel, some time before World War Two.",
        "Q: When you started the high school, tell me what age you were when you started the high\nschool, and were your friends at the high school only Jewish, or did you have also non-Jewish\nfriends?",
        "A: We started high school at the age of te -- 10. Before the Hitler period, we mixed fairly freely.\nNot hundred percent te -- hundred percent freely, but fairly freely with everybody. And there was\nnot much of a distinction made between Jews and -- and non-Jews, and you could communicate\nvery easily with everybody else. In my case, of course, this only lasted for one year. And then in\n1933, when I was 11 years old, Hitler came to power. But in the case of my older brother, this\nstate of affairs had much -- lasted much longer. My cousin -- my oldest cousin, who was of -- the\noldest amongst all of us who was at that time, he must have been already about 16 or 17, he had\ngone through that whole school, and of course had been totally integrated into the class in which\nhe was. So th-tha -- there wa -- there was not much -- there was not much distinction made, but\nthere -- there -- there was -- always was a certain amount of anti-Semitism. And the really\nwealthy families in town, non-Jewish wealthy families did not mix with Jews, basically. So there\nwere certain --",
        "Q: Did you remember feeling anti-Semitism in school before -- before Hitler came to power?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, oh yes. First of all, it was already 1932, the Nazi movement was already very\nactive, and certain -- let\u2019s say parents of certain -- of children have -- were already very active\nNazis. And they already came out with some objections to Jews. It didn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t very\nserious, and we didn\u2019t take it very serious, and we also had -- always had already answers to\neverything. We always fought back.",
        "Q: What would you say?",
        "A: Well, some of the [indecipherable] I remember somebody say to him -- said to me, you\nGoddamn Jew, you have a bend in your nose, you know, Jewish nose? And I said better -- I said\nit\u2019s much better than having a bird in your brain like you do. I said -- that\u2019s the German\nexpression for -- for being a nut, 1s to have, you know -- so -- but it -- 1t more or less stopped\nthere.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel, you know, physically harassed, or --",
        "A: Well now, are you talking about f -- before Hitler, or after Hitler?",
        "Q: First before.",
        "A: Before Hitler, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think -- I personally had no encounters of physical\nharassment. Maybe it was just lucky, but I -- I don\u2019t think it was very common to have physical\nharassment before Hitler.",
        "Q: Would you say -- can you tell me how large the overall town was, how many people lived\nthere, and was it -- would you say it was pretty good relations in general between the Jewish\ncommunity and non-Jews?",
        "A: The town had 8,000 in habitants, and as I said before, there were about 25 Jewish families in\nit. The relationships were, I think, pretty good. There were, of course, very Jewish businesses,\nand there were certain people who were anti-Semitic, who were just avoided. You just didn\u2019t\ncon-contact them. Of course, the -- the point of our town with 8,000 inhabitants is that everybody\nknows everybody. You couldn\u2019t hide. But by and large, I think it was a pretty peaceful life.",
        "Q: Now before we get to the time when Hitler comes to power, can you give me just a very brief\nsnapshot, the personalities of your family members; your mom, your -- your father, and your\nsiblings. Just give me a sense of, you know, who they -- who they are, and -- and their\npersonalities.",
        "A: Well, my father was the -- was very, very respected by -- by us. He was our greatest friend,\nand w-we three sons had a extremely good relationship with him when he was home.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nManfred Gans. This is tape number one, side B. If you could continue to tell me -- you were\nstarting to tell me about your mother.",
        "A: My mother, of course, had a hard job educating three sons, and no daughter. And she was --\ncould be quite volatile at times, and put on quite some scenes when we wouldn\u2019t go along with\nwhat she preached. And w-we could at times form a united front against her, and she would\ncomplain like hell to my father, who w-would get very upset about it, when he heard about it.\nBut -- and I don\u2019t want to underestimate the fact that, of course, my mother was in the afternoon\nin -- in my father\u2019s business, and we were somewhat educated by the maids we had in the house,\ntoo. We had two maids, as I said before, and we had other se-servants, and that had some sort --\nquite a bit of influence on us, too. Which I suppose is the usual experience of people who have\ngrown up in -- in we-wealthy homes where there were servants. My older brother was -- he was\nvery much the intellectual. He we -- he -- he was what you called a bookworm. And he -- he\nloved reading, and it came -- came -- c-came in very handy later on. I can go into the fine details\nafterwards. And my younger brother, he was outstandingly good looking. So -- and my mother\nalways said that I\u2019m -- I was her only s -- d-daughter. I had to learn all the practical skills. I had\nto do all the stuff in the kitchen, helping and so on, so forth. My -- my older brother was shielded\nfrom that -- he was quite awkward, too, that\u2019s because he was so bookish. My younger brother,\nof course, was spoiled like hell because he was so good looking, and so I had to have all the\npractical skills to -- to help everybody. So those -- those were the personalities, and they\nsomewhat remained that way all our lives, too.",
        "Q: So tell me now about Hitler coming to power.",
        "A: Well, of course it wasn\u2019t a -- it was not unexpected. There had been so many elections, and\nevery election Germany was going further and further to the right. More and more people were\nvoting for Hitler, or voting for the right wing parties, some of which were eventually merged into\nthe Nazi party. Another thing, another point I have to point out why all this was not so\nunexpected. When we visited my grandparents in Falksen near Hannover, they lived in -- ina\ntown that was largely Protestant. And that town was very radically in with the Nazi before Hitler.\nSo already in -- before Hitler, before 1933, when we went visiting there, there were a lot of kids\nwho didn\u2019t play with us because we were Jews. And they were already converted. So it\u2019s a -- a --\nth-they -- this is where the indic -- these were the indications of things changing. This a -- well, I\nnever forget the day Hitler came to power. We were having lunch, and we were listening to the\nradio, which was on because we listened to the one o\u2019clock news. And the newscast came out,\nand then suddenly the announcer said, \u201cAnd here is a little message, which has just fallen on my\ndesk, the president of Germany, Hindenburg, has appointed Adolf Hitler as the chancellor of --\nas the next chancellor of the German state.\u201d And I remember my mother was very, very shocked\nto hear this, and somehow we took it and said -- said well, that wa -- this was just one of the\nthings we had to face. The full implication of it, well I suppose we didn\u2019t ful -- fully realize -- at\nthe time the kids didn\u2019t, but my mother obviously did. My father was not home. I can\u2019t\nremember whether he came home that night. But soon -- he certainly came home very soon after.\nNow -- things changed in school now very -- I would say very rapidly. There -- some of the cra -\n- oO -- some of our classmates were keen to join the Hitler youth. There was no Hitler youth in our\ntown, and every time they had a demonstration, they had to call out the high school, which\nincluded us, for all their -- their demonstration, and whatever they were celebrating at the time.\nEventually my father got us out of there, we didn\u2019t have to attend those blasted ca -- wh-what --\nwhat do they call it? It\u2019s called in German [indecipherable]. Had the torchlight parades and all\nthat sort of things. We didn\u2019t have to go -- go along with that any more, but in the beginning we\ndid, because the school just said everybody come tonight, there\u2019Il be a torchlight parade to\ncelebrate this, that, and the other. And so we had to go.",
        "Q: Now did you always feel and know that you were against this, even though you had to be\nthere?",
        "A: Oh yeah, definitely, we had absolutely no identity cris -- crisis. That, I think is the advantage\nof having grown up as a -- as an Orthodox Jew. My father\u2019s father had come from Holland to\nmarry my -- marry my grandmother. And he had grown up with the Sephardic Jews in Holland,\nthough he was not Sephardic himself. In fact they were from the part of Holland that borders on\nGermany. And -- but he -- he was -- he was very much aware of the Sephardic experience. And\nevery time the word Spain was used, he spit. I didn\u2019t know him personally any more. He -- he\ndied in 1917. He had a hernia [indecipherable] there was misop -- mis-operation, unfortunately.\nAnd -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware of the fact that expulsion, flight, and all that\nsort of things was part of the Jewish tradition. And there were two Jewish families living in\ntown, who had come from either Poland or Russia, and who had been exposed to this whole\nbusiness of pogroms, and -- and ma -- Jewish persecution in the east. So again, everybody was\nOrthodox, so just was part again -- was accepted as being part and parcel of one\u2019s history. We\nhad absolutely no identity crisis when all this came. People find that hard to believe, particularly\nI -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lot of Jews, who f -- German Jews, who were not\nbrought up Orthodox, who had all sorts of clashes, including the -- the people who -- when\nsomeone was in the army, and people [indecipherable] working professionally, and who had --\nwho -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to\npower, and when they were excluded from the social life which they had practiced up to that\ntime. But as I said -- of course, the other point was we couldn\u2019t socialize that well with other pe -\n- with non-Jews, even before Hitler, because we were kosher, and we couldn\u2019t eat in their homes.\nAnd so it was -- it would be very rare if any of them would come to our homes, and eat with us.\nAs one of my schoolmates told me back in -- in the 1988 -- 1992, when I went back to -- to the\nha -- we first went back to our hometown, this -- we -- homes were not that comfortable in those\ndays, and we all were friends because we played on the street. So the -- the intimacy that one\nnow can experience in being in each other\u2019s home, we had -- we did not have that in any case.",
        "Q: So did you start to experience more restrictions at school? And also who -- tell me a little bit\nabout the composition of -- of the student body at school. I think you s-said in your memoirs\nmostly Catholic, but tell me a little bit about that.",
        "A: Yeah. The -- of course the town was largely Catholic, and most of our classmates before\nHitler belon -- belonged to a Catholic youth movement. That was the standard thing to do, for\neverybody to belong to the Catholic youth movement. That of course we -- we were already\nautomatically excluded. We did not, at that time, have a Jewish youth movement to which we\nbelonged, but we did later on. Now, all these -- of course, now the pressure became very strong\non all these members of the Catholic youth movement to change over to the Hitler youth, and\nmost of them did, eventually. It took a little while for everybody to go along that line, but this is -\n- this is where they went, eventually. And our attitude to them was you are wrong and we are\nright. Well, it\u2019s a -- things came to a head on the first of April, 1933. Now, this was only what,\nthree months after Hitler came to power? He come to power on the 13\" of January, 1933. The --\nthey started this boycott movement against Jewish businesses. And it was a Saturday, and there\nwere storm troopers in front of every Jewish business to make sure that people wouldn\u2019t buy at --\nin Jewish shops. And w-we of course had to go to school on Saturday, we didn\u2019t write, we didn\u2019t\nca-carry our satchel because we were Orthodox, but we had to go to school and listen to the\nschool classes. And while we were in school, the -- one of the teachers -- of the most trusted\nteachers, [indecipherable] was trusted most, came and called us out, and he said -- he said to us, I\nremember there were four Jewish boys in my grade, \u201cLook, you know what\u2019s happening to you.\nI think it\u2019d be safer for you to go home now.\u201d So, when we went home, and well, you know, this\n-- this was the dramatic, the most dramatic change you can imagine. Course our parents were -- I\nwon\u2019t say shocked, but they were stunned. And my father wasn\u2019t going to take it. So he\nimmediately [indecipherable] the Shabbat was out, he got on the telephone to the headmaster of\nthe school, and he says, \u201cHey, what\u2019s happening? I\u2019m not going to send my children back to the\nschool if you can\u2019t guarantee their safety.\u201d I am convinced that that headmaster then had to\ncontact all the necessary party lines. I don\u2019t think there was a Gestapo in this town yet, at that\ntime. I was very much aware of the Gestapo when it finally came, because of course, they -- they\n-- later on, at the outbreak of World War Two, they took over our house as Gestapo headquarters.\nBut I\u2019m sure he -- he couldn\u2019t give my father a direct answer, he had to square this away with all\nthe authorities. Anyhow, by Monday morning he told my father that all the Jewish students could\ncome back to the high school, and they could guarantee their -- our safety.",
        "Q: How did you feel personally? Were you getting worried, as -- as a youngster?",
        "A: Not in the least. Not in the least for it. They were wrong, we were right.",
        "Q: Do you want to take a short break?",
        "A: Yeah, I have to get my medicine.",
        "Q: Okay, if you want to continue telling me recollections of -- of this early period when the\nNazis came.",
        "A: So that was April first, and the next lightning bolt struck on May first. Of course May first is\nalways celebrated in -- in Europe by all labor unions and people who have anything to do with\nlabor, you know, which the Nazis thought they were -- were too. This was a big celebration. And\nof course there again, we had to have a -- a parade, and again, since there was no Hitler youth, so\nwe -- we ha-had to collec -- come together again. There wasn\u2019t a big demonstration, but we\nsuddenly -- one of the teachers came out with a swastika emblem, which showed that he\u2019d been -\n- been a member of the Nazi party for quite awhile. I don\u2019t know whether it was true. There\u2019s a\nlong history attached to this character. He was a dis -- teacher of mathematics, bio -- and\nparticularly of biology, and he eventually was charged with teaching the signs of a racist, a\nsubject -- new subject, which the -- the Nazis had thought out. Anyhow, on May first it turned\nout, he -- he came out with a swastika emblem on his coat, which showed that he had been a long\ntime member of the Nazi party.",
        "Q: And you -- you witnessed this yourself, this was --",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I have a long history with this man, who of course now, by now he\u2019s dead. But\nhe was an invalid. I can\u2019t remember from what any more, but he -- he -- he walked av -- one of\nhis legs wasn\u2019t functioning properly, so he was never called into the war, he stayed in the town\nthrough the whole war period, and as I said, I had quite a history with this character. Anyhow,\nnow m-my older brother, who decided that we should not communicate with our classmates any\nmore. We -- we shouldn\u2019t wait. He was -- my older brother was the sort of leader of the Jewish\nkids. My cousin, who as I said, who was about at that time was 16 - 17 years old. When he died\nlast year he -- in New York. He was -- he -- he wasn\u2019t in school any more, anyhow, so my older\nbrother became the leader of the Jewish children, and he decided that we\u2019re not going to wait\nuntil we\u2019re excluded, we\u2019re going to separate ourselves. So from that time on was -- we did not\ncommunicate with our schoolmates any more in -- in the -- in the a -- in the periods between\nlessons. Well -- we -- communication was absolutely at a -- at a minimum. You know, without\nany degree of intimacy between them and us. So, and this how I went to school for five years.\nMy older brother, who left in 1935, who -- which was three years later, and went to, at that time,\nPalestine, Israel. And so he was out, and so other Jewish children were taken out of school and\nsent abroad, or didn\u2019t continue high school. Emigrated and gone [indecipherable]. So eventually,\nby the time -- by the time I left, there -- there were only very few Jews -- Jewish children left in\nthe school, in the high school.",
        "Q: Did you feel -- what about the Nuremberg laws? Did you and your family feel repercussions\nalso?",
        "A: Yeah, the Nuremberg laws as far as we were concerned meant that we couldn\u2019t have any non-\nJewish maids any more. We then managed to get some maids whose nationality -- we-were\nDutch by nationality, you know, it\u2019s in a -- in a fr-frontier area like that wasn\u2019t that difficult to\nfind. But that was the na -- the major effect it had -- had on us. I am not aware of any other of\nthese, you know, manifestation of the Nuremberg laws.",
        "Q: What about your father\u2019s business?",
        "A: My father reduced his business considerably, and he started -- he -- he concentrated all his\nefforts on getting cash out of Germany. And he set up a new business which sold vacuum\ncleaners, and irons, and you know, for -- for pressing clothing, things of that nature, because he\nsaw a chance to do business of that nature, to get a lot of his money out of Germany, which of\ncourse, was illegal. There were schemes of that nature. I know my uncles had had schemes of\nthat nature. My father\u2019s brothers who were -- all of them were doing very well financially. And -\n- and including my father\u2019s best friend, who became my father-in-law later on, he too had a\nscheme of this nature, and this is how people who had money managed to get some of their\npossessions out of the country, some of their cash out of the country. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a complicated\nway of doing it. Might be interesting to investigate it some time, but I think it goes too far to talk\nabout it in great detail here.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you know at least where, in general, he was sending the money?",
        "A: Yeah, to -- largely to Holland. And he -- he went to Holland very frequently. He had a cousin\nin Winterswijk who cooperated with him. And I don\u2019t know all the details about it -- it -- but\nthere -- there always was some money available for us. He bought a house in -- in Israel in the\nearly stage, when he -- he went on a trip to Israel, I think in -- first time in 1936, or 1937, and\nyou know my -- of course my older brother was there, and he obviously had to pay for the\nschool, my brother went to Ben Shemen together with all the -- a lot of the famous leaders of --\no-of -- a lot of the men who became the famous leaders later on in Israel.",
        "Q: Tell me --",
        "A: Including -- in -- and amongst these -- his classmates were people like Rabin and Dayan. So\nhe -- so, as I said, money was available from -- for him to attend these schools.",
        "Q: Tell me what were -- what were the conversations like within your family, and at home? What\nwere you talking about now? Your father\u2019s business was changing, the changes at school. What -\n- what kind of conversations at home?",
        "A: Interesting question. Was a -- what were we -- what were we talking about? Well, I don\u2019t\nthink the subjects changed that dr-drastically. My parents were still very much interested in\nliterature, talking about s-sub -- subjects of culture. And they -- they did occasionally discuss\nwhat we should and should not do, and what we should and should not say in public. And -- and\nif you had to be cautious and all that. At a very early stage of 1933, of course they came and --\nthe police and the storm troopers came into our house, and they went through my father\u2019s library,\nbut they weren\u2019t -- weren\u2019t enough educated to even find the books that -- that were of dubious\nbackground. So my mother, too, had no -- absolutely no fear of these people. So I call them a\nbunch of drunkards who -- who belong to a club of dr-dr-drunkards, meaning the storm troopers.\nAnd I\u2019m sure they -- my parents are not afraid of them and nothing close to -- very radically\nhappened. But my father was in the -- interesting point, my father was in the town council. He\nhad advocated that the high school for girls, which only had 50 students in it, should be\ncombined with the high school of boys. Now, of course, in a Catholic town that was out of the\nquestion. My father had always based this on the huge expense the 50 student school was for the\ntown to support, and they said there should -- there should be a combination of that. Well would\nyou believe that within two months after the Nazis came to power, they combined the two\nschools? My father was away, I think in Hannover at the time, and my mother -- I remember my\nmother telling him on the telephone that this has happened, but of course she didn\u2019t say it direct\nbecause the telephones were probably listened to. But she said -- she used some Jewish\nexpression to -- to make him aware of that this was -- was happening. Finally his scheme was\nbeing translated into reality. So from one day to the other we had girls in the class.",
        "Q: Now, was your -- was your life a-aside from not interacting with non-Jewish students at\nschool, were there other things about your daily life that really changed, or was it largely the\nsame as -- as before?",
        "A: It was largely the same as before, except that [indecipherable] we cou -- we couldn\u2019t show our\nfaces any more at sports events, you know? You know, these sort of sports events that are\norganized, what shall we say, by kids themselves. There was a certain amount of exclusion there,\nand that it got worse. But there were -- there were classes to teach aircraft design in the\nafternoon, which I participated in and I\u2019m sure we were allowed to participate in. So it\u2019s -- 1-1t\ndidn\u2019t change too drastically, except now, the other thing was of course that now we had a\ndifferent teacher, who was very, very keen to -- to st -- to teach much about -- we had a different\nteacher -- teacher of the Jewish elementary school, and he was very, very keen that we should go\ninto much -- to greater depths in -- in Hebrew. And eventually we went to Hebrew classes. Now,\nI\u2019m talking about modern Hebrew speaking classes, every -- every day, except Friday. Every\nafternoon we had Hebrew classes. So that -- that was a radical change. And of course it did us a\nlot of good, and -- because go -- got us much into greater depths into Hebrew. This teacher, who\nalso later on was -- became the headmaster of the Mizrachi high school in Tel Aviv, he started\nthe -- also the [indecipherable] movement to which we then belonged, and so then it was sort of a\nlittle bit of a organization which was -- through which we met other Jewish kids from other\ntowns occasionally, and so we were -- became the members of the Mizrachi. Now it\u2019s a national\nreligious party, but it wasn\u2019t as radical as that in those days. The youth movement, and we were\npart of that.",
        "Q: So this was still in Borken, and was this a Zionist group?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, it was a Zionist -- Zionist group. That must have started round about 1934 or\nso, because my older brother was still in town when we started it, and he became one of the\nmotivators of it. And as I said before, he left in 35, I think, to go to Israel. So that -- that was\nanother connection which we had --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nManfred Gans. This is tape number two, side A.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister had gone to the Jewish agricultural school near Hannover, as -- when she\nhad finished elementary school. And there she met the man whom she eventually married, Alex\nMo. And who was one of the teachers in the school. And both my uncle, Alex Mo, and my aunt,\nspend all their lives until they emigrated from Germany, being in charge of agricultural training\nschools for Jews. Now, in 1932, I think it was, I spent a summer in the school which they ran at\nthe time, which was near Berlin, it was called Gutwinkle, and we somewhat participated a little\nbit in the work they did, and ma -- we were rewarded for it. But then, in 1933, they took over a\nvery large, what we called a hashavah camp, a cultural training camp for Jews who were\nchanging professionally to agriculture. [indecipherable]. And I spent almost every summer there,\nuntil I left Germany. And this of course, 1t was a fantastic influence on all our lives. We -- we\nloved the ti -- to go there. Since my uncle was in charge, we had, of course, a lot of privileges.\nOne of them was that we did a lot of horseback riding, and s-systematically learned horseback\nriding from one -- one of the teachers who was there, non-Jewish, who had been in the German\narmy cavalry. My uncle himself, who rode around all the time, supervised the work that was\nbeing done in the fields by these trainees, who were changing from all sorts of profession over\ninto agriculture. And to a child this was an absolutely 1 -- ideal way of -- of living. We -- I have\ninterest stories of the -- of the life we led there, and it was a -- a [indecipherable] connected with\nthe work and play, and it was a terrific experience. And I had -- it\u2019s of -- very much set the\natmosphere, both for my brothers and for myself, as to wh-where we wanted to go\nprofessionally, eve-eventually. Some --",
        "Q: How did it -- how did it establish your direction?",
        "A: Well, my uncle thought well, of -- you know, he -- he put -- put us into whatever we wanted\nto do, and was -- wherever we could be used. We -- in the morning we always worked, and he\nsoon found out that I was very, very handy, so he assigned me to the repair shop which they had\nthere. And that sort of set me on my -- on my aim to become an engineer for repairing -- for\nagricultural machinery. I played around already at that time a little bit with the idea of becoming\na chemical engineer, but it was -- there was -- everybody said you can\u2019t do that without doing it\nfull time. And I always felt that I would never have the money to go to a full time university. So,\nthere -- that was, of course, my idea, and I\u2019ve already mentioned, my older brother went to an\neke -- went to Israel, went to Ben Shemen, which was the agricultural school in -- in Israel. So\nthat set his life, too. And my younger brother, he -- when he finished school in -- in England,\neventually he also took up -- there was a -- a job in -- in agriculture, and stayed in that field all\nhis life. He later on became a specialist of fertilizers and things of that nature. So all our\ndirections were set by this agricultural experience, which we had in the training schools run by\nour uncle and a-aunt.",
        "Q: And this is when you\u2019re a teenager, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And what about your Bar Mitzvah during this time of your life?",
        "A: Well, Bar Mitzvah to us was not a big deal really, because we knew so much Hebrew, and\nlearned so much. And my older brother was Bar Mitzvahed in 1933, yeah \u201933, that\u2019s right. And\nat the time -- at the time my -- my mother\u2019s father had just died. So my parents didn\u2019t -- for that\nreason, and also because the Hitler business, did not want to make a huge Bar Mitzvah for him.\nBut, you know, he had a f -- it was a very nice Bar Mitzvah and all that sort of thing. Very\nluxurious, but it was kept relatively small. You know, we had a huge family because my -- my\ngrandmother had five boys and five girls. And we al -- and they all married, and they all had\nkids, you know, so th -- wa -- it was somewh -- somewhat resented by all these relatives that they\n-- they weren\u2019t -- the invitations were relatively kept to a small [indecipherable]. Now, by the\ntime I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1930 -- it\u2019s 22 and 13 is 35, right? Yes, that\u2019s right. \u201933 to thir --\nyeah, \u201935. By the time I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1935, w -- we had a really huge Bar Mitzvah, with\nall the trimmings on it, and of course people coming to our town, they had to be fed three times\non as -- Saturday, you know? On Friday nights, on Saturday morning, and s -- then somehow\nagain something -- something again in the afternoon. We were expected to do the whole Torah\nreading for that day, of sh -- was no -- no difficulty to me at all. And we were expected to do the\nwhole reading from the prophets, the Haftorah readings for the day. Again, no -- no -- no\nparticular -- wa -- and we were expected to make a speech. And I made a f -- apparently made a\nspeech which upset my parents very much, because I -- politically it was unwise.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: Well, yeah, I think I started off by saying we are being accused of -- of such and such, and\nsuch and such things now, and I\u2019Il teach you that this is totally against our laws, and that we\ncouldn\u2019t be like this. And so it\u2019s a so -- so anyhow --",
        "Q: So your -- your speech actually had to do with the political climate and the times?",
        "A: Yes, yes. But you know, the speech was made at home, not in the synagogue. And the\nservants of course that were around, were non-Jews, who served the meals, so -- I don\u2019t think\nthat my parents had e -- invited any non-Jews -- non-Jewish friends to any of these occasions.",
        "Q: What were your favorite Jewish holidays growing up?",
        "A: Oh, I would say Pesach, Passover. Best food. You know, cause of my mother, being such a\nfabulous cook, all these things were -- were -- were on a -- on a Scale that wer -- was gour -- real\ngourmet eating. I mean, even the -- you know, that we -- we of course did not eat meat on the\nnine days before Tisha B\u2019 Av. But it was wonderful, the stuff my mother cooked was just out of\nthis world. No meat in it, and this being summer, you know, you have all the fruits you want.\nAnd she made the most fantastic fruit soups, and vegetable soups tha -- vegetable dishes,\nanything you could think of. And this way it was no hardship at all. The only hardship was that\nwe also couldn\u2019t go swimming in those -- in those nine days. And in the summer, you know\u201d? So\nwe were waiting for Tisha B\u2019 Av to be gon -- be gone so we could go back to the s -- to the swim\nbaths, you know, go swimming.",
        "Q: That reminds me of something you wrote in your memoirs about the pool in -- in the\ncommunity. Can you tell me about that during this time period?",
        "A: Yeah, actually it\u2019s a -- the -- the -- the pool was not forbidden to us, except for certain times.\nThey had to, you know, there was sort of a mixture between Catholic and Nazi. They had periods\n[indecipherable] was women only, and -- where women were allowed. Those periods we did not\n-- we were not allowed to go into the swimming pool, the town swimming pool. But then they\nalso had periods when the -- the pool was open to men only, and those periods -- in those periods\nwe could still sneak in and take a swim. So we had to be carefully attuned to what could and\nwhat could not be done.",
        "Q: Was there any rule at all that said that Jews could not swim in that pool?",
        "A: Yeah, not -- not -- not -- not complete exclusion. The exclusion was only for the periods when\nwomen were allowed, or mixed swimming was allowed. So we managed to ge -- to gets -- to\nsneak in still.",
        "Q: Were there any other places in town where you weren\u2019t actually allowed?",
        "A: They -- the -- the -- you know, there was only one movie house in town, and that put up a sign\nfairly soon saying we don\u2019t want any Jews, Juden [indecipherable]. And when that sign went up,\nmy parents would not allow us to go in any more because this is -- you know, that -- that was\nthat.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s not like you tried, you just decided not to go?",
        "A: We decided that -- not to go, yeah. I think if you could have sneaked in, nobody would have\nobjected very much.",
        "Q: And what about any recollections of Nazis in -- in your town, did you ever have any\nencounters yourself?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Violent, too. I mean, it started to get dangerous to -- to walk in the -- 1 -- you know,\nin the very beautiful woods around that town. You know, on Saturday afternoon we would go for\na walk, and sha -- would want to play, and there were certain guys who -- who it was dangerous\nto meet. And they were beating us up and God knows what. That\u2019s -- we had to be very, very\ncareful.",
        "Q: Did this actually happen to you, or mostly to others?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Once a guy hit me in the face with a burning rubber -- rubber what do\nyou call it, a rubber stick, and I, you know, I had an injury from it for quite awhile. And there\nwas another, you know, usually it was just beating up, or stones being thrown, and things of that\nnature. You just had -- had to be very, very careful. And you just -- nothing you could do. You\nhad to recognize that there was superior force on the other side. You don\u2019t stand and fight\nsuperior force. You just have to flee from it, go into an area where gro -- you have enough\ngrown-ups who would interfere with what these kids were doing.",
        "Q: So now tell me about what -- what happened -- what leads up to you going to England.",
        "A: Actually, my parents wanted to get me into a Jewish high school in Berlin in 1938. On -- on\none of the many trips to this farm, that training farm which my uncle and aunt -- aunt were in\ncharge of, I had to -- come to know two of these schools. They had to -- they had come to visit\nthe farm, and I was there. I got very, very friendly with some of the teachers, and some of the\nkids. And as a matter of fact I went to one of the schools, and well, for a day or two in Berlin,\nand listened in, and from -- and then my parents said in 1938, that I should leave the school in\nour hometown and go to one of those schools. And it was decided that since all these schools are\nvery far advanced in teaching English, I will need enough English to ca -- catch up with the other\nme-members of the school.",
        "Q: What languages did you know already at this point?",
        "A: We had been -- we had, apart from Hebrew, of course, which we did not learn in public\nschool, our education was Latin. We -- we -- ever since we were 10 years old, every day we\nlearned -- had at least one or two hours of Latin. Latin was the foundation of our -- of our\nknowledge. Now, I learned some English, I learned some French, but certainly not -- not to a\nvery high degree. Anyhow, my parents wanted to send me to England for the summer, and -- to\nlearn English, and then I -- I would come back to -- to -- to Germany. But while I was in\nEngland, my parents wrote saying that they have talked with other people, and they\u2019 ve come to\nthe conclusion that it\u2019s not wise for me to go back to Germany. And they said what would you do\nif we were tell you, you just stay where you are. So --",
        "Q: And what did you feel about that?",
        "A: Wonderful. I was free. I had -- I had made friends, again thr -- through my relatives with other\nf-family where the gentleman was very active in the Jewish agency, Adler Rudell. And I went to\nthem, and I told them that -- what my parents had written, and -- and what should I do? And we\ndecided that the thing to do was, since my means were limited, was to go to an intensive tutorial\ncollege, and try and do metric, you know, high school cer -- equivalent to a high school\ncertificate, in that fashion. And I -- I loved the idea to do this.",
        "Q: Now tell me when is this, how old are you, and what kind of major experience 1s this for you\nat this time, because you\u2019re pretty young.",
        "A: Yeah. This was 1938, so I was 16 years old, and -- I liked the idea of trying to make it in\nabout four or five months, to try and get -- get a equivalent of a high school certificate, and then\ngo and start working. Since I knew exactly what I wanted to do, I would get myself a job, and I\nwould go on and learning in -- in evening classes. I didn\u2019t have any doubts as to what to do, and I\nlike -- as I said, I like the idea to be on my own. Now my parents did come over occasionally, my\nfather or my mother, or both of them, during all this time when I first came to England, and --\nuntil the outbreak of the war. They -- on and off there, they were in England.",
        "Q: Was it easy for you to leave, and also for them to travel like that?",
        "A: It was very easy for me to leave, because we all had been living so close to the frontier, we all\nhad passes to cross the frontier. It took a long while to get a passport wh-which could take me\npast the frontier areas of Holland. But we -- we -- we all passports at the time. One more thing,\nalready at that age, I had learned to drive the car. My father wanted me to do that in case we\nsuddenly had to get out in the middle of the night. So by the age of 16, and of course t-totally\nillegal, I knew how to drive a car already. And I -- I left home on a Friday afternoon, Friday\nmorning, I crossed the frontier, went to my c -- my father took me to his cousin, I stayed there\nfor the weekend, and on Sunday I traveled on to Hoek van Holland, took the night boat over to\nEngland, and arrangements had been made by my parents for me to live temporarily with a\nfamily, a very nice family in -- in London.",
        "Q: So when you were preparing to leave, were you thinking a lot about the escalating events in\nGermany? Is this what you and your parents talked about a lot? Is this also -- was this on your\nmind a great deal?",
        "A: Yes, yes, in my mi -- we came to the con -- conclusion that things were really getting worse\nand worse, and that it wasn\u2019t worthwhile to take the risk of sticking around. So -- and since I was\nout of the country anyhow, my parents felt that I should stay out, because as I said before, my\nolder brother had been in -- in -- in Israel since 1935, so it wa -- it wasn\u2019t such a big sh -- idea for\nme to get out, too.",
        "Q: But your parents and your younger brother did stay in your hometown?",
        "A: Yes. My father somehow just couldn\u2019t make -- give himself the push to cut off everything. He\nsaw more and more chances to get at least some of his money out, and he was going to stick it\nout to the -- to the end and get the maximum amount, you know, of course that probably was the\nwrong decision to make. My younger brother also stayed at home. My parents were rather\nreluctant to let him go because he was not independent yet, and so he stayed until after\nKristallnacht.",
        "Q: So tell me about what you knew while you were now in London, what you knew about\nevents, things going on like Kristallnacht. What -- what did you hear, and what did you know\nabout what was happening back in Germany?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a -- you know, this became wu -- practically headline news in the British papers,\nwhen this Kristallnacht happened, and some of the papers tried to say that this was spontaneous,\nyou know, and other papers, like the new scr -- new [indecipherable] liberal paper, they said no,\nthis is organized. I discussed -- discussed it with my friends, the Adler Rudell, and he said, \u201cNo,\nthis was organized by the state, there was nothing spontaneous about that.\u201d This was an assertion\nof power, a first sign, and if you had no doubts about it, where all this was going to -- to -- to\nlead. The fact that so many people had been put into prison, some in concentration camp, and so\non, so forth, I mean I don\u2019t think that anybody, at least I didn\u2019t have any doubts this was the\nbeginning of an absolute disaster. So --",
        "Q: Were you worried about your family, your parents, and your brother?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I was worried about my parents because I knew that they could always get\nout when they wanted to get out, and this is what they intended to do. And -- and that they had\nenough means to -- to -- to get out when they wanted to do. So from -- personally we didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t feel this was a -- was to -- go -- going to be so critical. But you know, the [indecipherable]\nthe stateless Jews [indecipherable] family in our town, people who had come from Poland, and\nnever -- never become citizens, and you know, they were picked up, and shipped away, and put\nat the border of Poland and -- and -- and Germany. That time we were very much aware of what\nwas happening to them. You should -- you know, the Poles didn\u2019t want to let them in, and the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t have them. And, you know, these were families whom we knew.\n[indecipherable] 35 families in a town, of course you know everybody.",
        "Q: Did you have a feeling once you\u2019re in London that you may never return to your hometown,\nor what was your sense at that time?",
        "A: Absolutely. Already when I left Germany I knew I would never -- never return. And I was -- I\n-- I was convinced that this German experiment would last for ages and ages and we would never\nbe allowed to return. I never mentioned that this was all going to be over and done with in -- in\nwhat was it? ?38? Fa -- \u201945? That\u2019s seven years, right? We got back to Germany in \u201945. It\u2019s\nincredible. It\u2019s incredible, except that it didn\u2019t seem so incredible after Munich, you know. After\nMunich we knew that war was coming, and -- and that Hitler would go too far. So -- but befo --\nbut when I left, I thought I will never see the place again.",
        "Q: How did that make you feel, had -- did you feel an attachment to Germany?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I did, you know. I -- after all, we had traveled a lot in Germany, we had been in\nvarious children\u2019s camps, things of that nature, and I -- I -- I loved the beautiful landscapes, the\nbeautiful woods and all. [indecipherable] very much trave -- traveled along the Rhine. Was a\nbeautiful area, by -- into -- by train, and so we were very much aware of what the place looked\nlike, and definitely had -- definitely had a certain attachment to it. Felt very bad about never\nbeing able to see it again.",
        "Q: So tell me a little bit about your life in -- in London, and are you following the news very\ncarefully? Is this something that you really were, you know, closely following, about these\ndevelopments? Just tell me about this phase of your life before the war actually starts.",
        "Q: Well, first off, as I said, when I came to London, I was living with a wonderful family, with\nthe Jacobs, who were the [indecipherable] Mr. Jacobs, he\u2019d been an officer in a Jewish brigade in\nWorld War One, and of course, knowing a lot about Zionist history, all this makes a little sense\nto me. His wife was from a Jewish family that had settled originally in -- in Scotland, she spoke\nquite a good ger -- German, and sh-she was [indecipherable] woman, very hard working. They\nhad one daughter, about my age, and also living with them was a nephew who was an orphan,\nand who went to business every day. And also a distant relative, a girl from -- a Polish Jewish\ngirl apparently from very well-to-do parents. She spent every afternoon in the movies. She was a\ntotal movie addict, this girl. So -- so it was a big household, and actually we only ate together on\n-- again, on Friday nights, and Saturday lunch time. The -- the house was located right be --\nwithin one or two blocks of the [indecipherable] synagogue, which was a big synagogue, and\nthat\u2019s where Mr. Jacobs belonged. And -- and I concentrated on learning English, very much\nhelped by Mrs. Jacobs, who had no hesitation to correct me, telling me what to do. And ever\nsince I love reading newspapers, and the Jacobs, since they were liberals, you know, with a\n[indecipherable], course the newspaper was a news chronicle, and I u-used to translate\nnewspaper articles and then learn them by heart, and this is how I si -- taught myself English, to\na large extent, very much helped, as I said, by Mrs. Jacobs, as I was there. Was a wonderful time\nI had there. Was a little bit expensive, and so I couldn\u2019t stay there any length of time, but while it\nlasted it was -- was very nice.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nManfred Gans. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: Well, one incident that actually I think is worthwhile recording is one day Mr. Jacobs went to\nthe library, and he said, \u201cDo you want anything from the library?\u201d And I said \u201cYes, get me\n\u201cMein Kampf,\u201d Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in German.\u201d Of course, while I was in Germany, I would\nnever do them the honor of reading this, but I felt I had to read it, and I\u2019m very, very grateful that\nI did read it at the time when I -- whe -- because it made it so clear, totally clear as to what was\ngoing to happen, from reading that book. And this -- all this -- the propaganda methods, the way\nto achieve their aim. This business of expanding Germany into the eastern [indecipherable] and\nsh -- chasing all Slavic nations behind the euro -- and all this was all -- the all -- all set out there,\nyou know? It -- 1-1t was shus -- it was oka -- I don\u2019t know why I did it, but I did read \u201cMein\nKampf\u2019 in German while I was there. Then occasionally we went to the movies, Mr. Jacobs took\nme to the movies, which was, of course, in English. And that -- that was a good experience too.\nAnd generally ha-have a wonderful time. Eventually, when my parents say cha -- that I should\nstay, I realized I couldn\u2019t stay with the Jacobs because it was far too expensive, and I had to go\nand look for cheaper accommodation. An -- but -- but of course, by that time my English had\nimproved a lot, too. I had made up my mind to go to the tutorial college in Euston -- it -- 1s it\nEuston? It is near -- I know it\u2019s near Bushhaus in -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s Euston, which is spelled E-u-s-t-o-\nn. And so I made the arrangements to find a new home, or new digs with se -- with those factors\nin mind of having to go to -- to the tutorial college every day, a-and obviously I still wanted to be\nnear a synagogue and all that, and I had to live kosher. So that\u2019s -- determined where I settled.",
        "Q: What were the signs of -- of the war now -- now encroaching, coming?",
        "A: Well, the signs were the demands which Germany made on Czechoslovakia. There was the\ngathering of the party -- I can\u2019t remember any more where it was, where they -- where they\ncelebrated the presence of the S-Sudeten German people, and their demands for incorporating the\nSudeten area into Germany became very, very loud and forceful, and it was quite obvious what\nthey wanted to do. They wanted to annex the Sudetenland. And this led to the Munich gathering,\nwhich -- in which France and Germany agreed -- France and England agreed that Hitler could go\ninto -- could annex the Sudetenland without France and England going to war. Well, of course,\nHitler signs a piece of paper saying that this would be his last demand, and it will be peace in our\ntime. That\u2019s the famous peace in our time. And Chamberlain came home to England, he says\npeace in our time, the memo in his hand, and I remember next Saturday, next Shabbat in\nsynagogue -- I still went to the [indecipherable] synagogue, Mr. Jacob saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like this\nwhole thing.\u201d And of course, there was the famous speech by Churchill in Parliament, where he\ntold Chamberlain y- you had to -- you had to choose between dishonor and war, you chose\ndishonor, that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to have war.",
        "Q: Was this -- was this a difficult time for you to --",
        "A: No, no, it\u2019s a -- you know, it no -- it became -- it -- it just said it was all inevitable. This 1s all -\n- what\u2019s going to happen and so there was nothing we could do about it, and we just had to fit\nourselves into this -- into this -- into this situation. Before the Munich agreement, a lot of people\nhad left London, including my landlady and her daughters, [indecipherable] and I was sort of\nasked to look after myself, which I didn\u2019t mind at all. And they -- they returned after the Munich\nagreement had been signed, and it was pretty sure that a war would not break out immediately.\nPeople we -- were divided. They ca -- people who were conservatives, conservative Jews, I\nmean, you know, this conservative party of England. There were a lot of those in a rich\ncommunity like Goldaskreen, and they took the attitude Chamberlain did the right thing. We\nhave not got the means to go to war at the moment. He s -- fo-fought for time. The people who\nwere liberal like Mr. Jacobs said it was a dishonor which we shouldn\u2019t have gone in for. And the\npeople who were lesstich labor, they -- they had been such you Jews, they had been such\npacifists, that they -- they -- they wouldn\u2019t hear about -- about any requirements such as having a\ndraft and mobilizing, and any of those things. They -- they couldn\u2019t get used to this idea\n[indecipherable]. And, as I said, I was very much influenced by the views of people like Mr.\nJacobs, who were liberals, who -- who thought this was a --a dishonor. So we\u2019ve faced reality, as\nbest as we could. And -- and of course the pressure on -- on the German Jews which -- other\nJews became larger, until more and more refugees coming into England, and a lot of -- and the\ndifficulty of getting jobs for people, and getting a way of finding money to live on became larger\nand larger, but the British Jewish community was a [indecipherable] and an extremely well\norganized, largely by volunteers. They had money available, and they -- I think they, in my\nopinion they took care of this refugee program in an excellent -- in a wonderful way, in spite of\nthe fact of course, obviously everybody finished up living at a standard of living which was far,\nfar below the sort of standard of living they had experienced in -- in Germany.",
        "Q: Was life difficult for you as a refugee in London, or did they also make it easier for you?",
        "A: Well, you know, the point was that I had enough money to live on. All I had to look after was\nt -- to do, was to work and work and work and try and get this high school simetric in four\nmonths, which I didn\u2019t succeed to do eventually, but nevertheless, that effort [indecipherable]\nwas the only thing I -- I was going for. It\u2019s -- I -- I did not have to share in a lot of the hardships\nwhich other people were exposed to, because after all, my father could send me some money --\ncarefully, you know, didn\u2019t squander it in any way, lived very simple. But it gave me certain\npride to -- to live in a frugal way. And as I said, my aim was to -- was concentrated on qualifying\nfor the high school certificate.",
        "Q: So tell me about the start of the war.",
        "A: All right. After I finish the tutorial college, and have not passed the examination, I -- I passed\neverything except the English, I just wasn\u2019t good enough. But I -- I decided I was not going to go\nback to school full time. And I registered as the [indecipherable] I -- I went into the German\nJewish aid committee, and saw what went on there for a whole day. And in the evening, one of\nthe ladies, she was from the Shief fam -- family -- you know, these were all volunteers, people\nwho did this. She had -- obviously has a tough day, and she says, \u201cWould you like to go to\nManchester?\u201d I said, yes, I\u2019ll go. I thought it was very important that we -- we refugees would\nnot all congregate in London, and so -- so I -- together with a few other people, a few days later,\nI went to Manchester, and again, there was a organized German Jewish aid committee, first liv --\nfirst lived in a -- in -- what do you call -- would you call it, I don\u2019t know. Some sort of communal\nhouse, which again it was, you know, had to be kosher, and -- and it was very nicely organized,\nand all that, and of course we had to work and keep it clean and all that. And the c-committee\nwent out and to tr-try to find us jobs. And -- and through them, eventually, I got a -- a job which\n-- which I liked very much. In fact, this was the first non-Jewish offer which the committee had\nhad for jobs. And I wanted to go into machinery repair, and it turns out that this, we -- this part of\nthis -- this plant was not -- the repair shop was not unionized, so I could go -- go -- go into that,\nand fit myself into that. And it turned out to be an extremely good experience. It\u2019s an interesting\nstory, you can tell it in great details. Again, I had to make it clear that I wouldn\u2019t work on\nSaturday, I wouldn\u2019t work on Friday afternoons, or would go home early on Friday afternoons.\nBut they -- they didn\u2019t mind at all, they said, \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get paid. If you\nclock in and you clock out, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Initially the German Jewish aid committee subsidized\nmy -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I had started working in this job, they told me in\nthe home where we were, that I should go to a certain place, to a certain address where I would\nbe able to make arrangements to finding a place -- permanent place to live, a lodging to -- to live.\nI went to this place, I had hardly changed from my work clothes, and I went to the right address,\nand to my great surprise I was in -- at a beautiful estate, very rich, obviously very rich people. I\ndidn\u2019t know what it was all about, but I was hope [indecipherable] the right address. It turned out\nthat my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be\nintroduced to me. These were the Steinats. They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous\nLaskeys were the richest family in Manchester, Jewish family in Manchester. And the Steinats\nwere the second richest families. And they were -- s-started my relationship with that -- that\nfamily. The brother of Mrs. Steinats had also been an officer in the Jewish brigade in World War\nOne, and that -- so the connection between Mrs. Jacobs and the Steinats. So you see it\u2019s just all --\nall a question of connection with -- and it was very important in England, everything 1s c-\nconnection. It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s whom you know. And the Steinats made arrangements\nfor me to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a room from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr.\nSteinats father. Mr. Steinats hated her like the guts. He didn\u2019t like her at all. But it came in handy\nfor me to -- to live there, and I lived there with another German Jewish man, who was two years\nolder than I, and -- and there was a very old man also living there as a lodger. Now, this lady\nrented rooms, and she provided meals. It was pretty primitive, but all right, I -- I didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] I d -- the -- the job which I had accepted, w-w-was technically very good, but it\nagain, the circumstances of -- of cleanliness, and toilet facilities were just d-disgusting. But I th -\n- | thought this 1s part of living like this, and I was living on the -- during the week I was living in\nthe poverty of a working class atmosphere, and on weekends I was going to the Steinats for\npractically all my meals, and living in a very, very high class atmosphere. Undoubtedly the\nSteinats were richer even than my father was. And I -- I thought it was greater -- a great\nexperience. So I -- I think I have to take another trip to the toilet.",
        "Q: Sure. [tape break] So where were you when the war began?",
        "A: Well, just let me tell you about one more item that was also very significant in my life. It --\nfirst of all, as you may remember or may know, I think it was in February, 1939, Hitler marched\nand took over the rest of Czechoslovakia. Of course, everybody thought the war was going to\nbreak out immediately then, but I -- I was sure it wouldn\u2019t. Because now the attitude of France\nand England changed, and they started sending their foreign ministers to Moscow to try and get a\ner-great alliance with the Russians going. And of course that was their big hope, that they\neventually would pull that off, and pull it off together. And -- and all the workers in -- in the\nfactory where I worked said we\u2019ll be in war -- at war in a week or so, and I say, no you won\u2019t be.\nThey going to try this, and they\u2019re going to be -- do their best effort to -- to pull a -- make alli -- a\nmajor alliance with the Russians. And this is very much what happened. So nothing much\nhappened politically, every -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a\nwar. But the -- these two elephants were not in -- on the way yet. Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was\nat the Steinats again, and so I mentions that I had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi from\nManchester, Dr. Altman, who was, not to me, but to other people, a well known rabbi from\nBerlin. Quite young, he was in middle 30\u2019s, or -- at the time, and sa -- for the [indecipherable]\nafter the synagogue ceremony, th -- the Steinats had invited Dr. Altman and his wife, together\nwith a few other very prominent people of the Jewish community. The day was glorious, the\nweather was glorious, the food was incredible. Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot,\nand this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who later on became the head of the -- head of the\nInstitute of Advanced Jewish Studies at Brandeis University. And he -- we became friends right\nthere and then, and he is being -- he being -- he was my mentor, from whom I learned an awful\nlot, until the time he died in, I don\u2019t know, some times in the 80\u2019s. He was professor at Harvard,\nsame time professor at Jerusalem University. And but that\u2019s -- basically he was a fantastic\nthinker, with tremendous ideas, and I attended a lot of lectures which he gave, mostly in\nManchester, and then later on here, in this country. And he set me on a path of -- of studies, and\nviews that have sur -- very much influenced my life and gave me a much deeper understanding\nof Judaism than I could have possibly gotten in any other way. So that was sometime on May,\n1930 -- ?39. And then, actually on -- so then, in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly\ntranspired that Germany had made a pact with the Soviet Union, or the Soviet Union had made a\npact with Germany that they were going to divide up Poland between the two of them. I don\u2019t\nknow whether we were a hundred percent aware of it, that they were going to divide up Poland at\nthat time, but you know, that\u2019s what it amounted -- amounted to. And now the road was clear for\nHitler to march into Poland, and -- which he did on September first, 1939. England declared war\non the following Sunday, this was -- September first was a Friday, and England declared war on\na -- on a Sunday night. And I happened to be at the Steinats at that time, listen -- listened to the\nspeech which Chamberlain made, over the radio, which he pointed out that I ca -- I -- I wish I\nhad the -- the exact text of this. I\u2019ve asked people to look it up, I think I want to look it up, it\u2019s\nvery worthwhile. He said these [indecipherable] evil things we\u2019ll be fighting against, bad faith,\nsomething something, and oppression, but I can\u2019t remember exactly any more. And against\nthese, I\u2019m sure the right will prevail. So --",
        "Q: Is it [inaudible]",
        "A: That\u2019s this here. So the -- the first thing -- the first thing we experienced at the time, was that\nwe all had to register, we German Jews, and we were, in a typical British fashion, put before a\ntribunal, which [indecipherable] each case individually, and people were classified into a categ --\nGerman -- you know, we were off -- t-to the British we were all German. There were -- category\nA went straight into interment camp, category B could go on living under certain circumstances,\nand category C were totally free, and being treated like British people. Of course with my\nconnections to the Steinats and all that, I had no difficulty in being assigned to c-category C. So\n1-it didn\u2019t affect me in the beginning, at all. The -- there now was a -- a c-call-up. Conscription\nwas enacted, people were called to the services, and obviously the country was getting on a war\nfut -- footing slowly. This was the period which we call the phony war because nothing\nhappened. There was a British expeditionary force sent into France but not into Belgium. And th-\nthey were very -- an-and the western front was extremely inactive, nothing happened there at all.\nHitler was occupied in the east, conquered Poland, and this was a -- and apparently things were\nvery quiet, but everybody realized this was a quiet before -- before the storm. I continued to\nwork in the same place I was, and in January ni -- 1940, I managed to pass the high school\ncertificate, which I had continued preparing -- prepared in pravin -- largely in private class,\nprivate pa -- private tuition, and not -- not even going to any classes at all. I had a pr -- civil pri --\ndifferent private teachers. I -- I had a very heavy German bicycle, which -- with which I run\naround all over the place, at all times of the days and nights. And somehow this way I -- I\nmanaged to -- to -- to survive. In -- now, you know, jobs became freely available. There was a\nshortage of workers everywhere, and after awhile I decided I wanted to go and do something\ncloser to what I -- my long term aim was, and I got myself a job in a factory that manufactured\nagricultural machinery. They -- actual -- in actual fact, the actu -- the experience was -- I felt was\nnot very good, and the agricultural machinery was very crude compared with what I had been\ndoing up to that time, and I didn\u2019t think I was learning too much from getting -- being exposed to\nthis machinery, and I have -- wuf -- had more or less made up my mind to give all this up, and go\ninto a different direction, for to -- to go into machine tools, which were th -- at the height of -- of\nwhat has -- one has to know as a mechanical engineer. But then of course, came the invasion of -\n- first of Norway and Denmark, and after that the invasion of the lowlands, and the attack on the\nwestern front, and now everything changed. Obviously with the -- the use of secret sympathizers,\nNazi sympathizers that suddenly rose up in Holland and in Belgium, in -- in less -- to a lesser\nextent in Denmark, but to a larger extent in Norway, now the British public became a -- very,\nvery concerned about people like ourselves. The first affected --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nManfred Gans. This is tape number three, side A.",
        "A: So, after the invasion of the lowlands, and Hitler\u2019s victory in the west, and after the British\nexpeditionary force had been brought back to England via Dunkirk in the famous Dunkirk\nretreat, it -- our life was made a lot harder. As I said, I had to given -- I had to give up my\nbicycle. Luckily it was summer, so I could do everything by bus, and the days were long. But\nvery soon thereafter, we were interned -- put into an internment camp. The first internment camp\nI was in was near Manchester. It was an old disused factory, terribly filthy. It was in Bury, B-u-r-\ny, and there were about -- there must have something like two or 3,000 people in it. They ranged\nfrom German merchant sailors, so ver -- real Germans who had been taken prisoner on the high\nseas, to us, the ultra Orthodox Jew, or the Orthodox Jews. There was a whole big group of\nOrthodox people there, and we all stuck together. We of course didn\u2019t participate in the -- the\ngeneral food, we -- we did our own cooking, and looked after ourselves, which meant no meat,\nand of course there were no such things as eggs, so f-food was pretty short. I don\u2019t -- can\u2019t\nremember how long we were in this disused factory. We were lucky that the weather was perfect,\nfor England, and this was a beautiful summer, because I -- I -- thinking 1 -- in case of rain, I don\u2019t\nthink the roof would -- would have held up.",
        "Q: How did you first learn that you were going to be sent to this internment place?",
        "A: Well, the police came around, you know, the police came around and said oh sorry, you ha --\nyou have to pack up and you have to go -- you\u2019Il be interned. The -- first they had come around\nbefore, and you know, told me to se-sell the bicycle, which I did, I sold it to a neighbor who --\nwho was a bicycle nut. He l-loved bicycles, and then they came around later on again, and said\nsorry, we have to intern you. So this was from one day to the other, pack up, and I --",
        "Q: And when was this, when did this begin?",
        "A: This must have been something like June, July, 19 -- 1940. Sis -- so we were in this place in\nBury, this -- this used factory, tried to make ourselves useful by working, it\u2019s one thing or the\nother. That was a lot of time to spend, but a lot of people had bor -- brought good books, and tis -\n- there were interesting discussions. As I said, I -- I think there must have been something like\n2,000 people in that camp. From there we were eventually shipped to a place near Shrewsbury,\nwhich was an internment camp which was all tents, so we lived in tents. Again, the Orthodox ] --\nJews kept together and had a very organized life. There were enough rabbis amongst that group\nto organize all this. And we kept to our -- ourselves, and everybody tr-tried to he -- help, and\nmake -- make a go of it. [indecipherable] I -- I did feel -- I became quite weak because of the\nlack of food. The one main instance I remember is that when the son-in-law of the famous chief\nrabbi of England, Dr. Hertz, whose -- you know, who has written that book [indecipherable]\nTorah -- underneath the green you'll find the -- that\u2019s the Hertz Bible. And he came around and\nhe -- he sort of assured us that they would see to it that the -- the food situation would improve.\nBut, of course, it couldn\u2019t be for a very long time in this tent camp, and I think some time in --\nprobably in September or so, maybe it was later, I can\u2019t remember exactly any more, every --\nthese -- we were all shipped over to the Isle of Mann, where they had fenced off whole districts\nof the town and some [indecipherable] were converted into -- into internment camps. Again,\nthere were houses with -- for Orthodox Jews, and we all kept to ourselves. But life was quite\norganized there. It was -- 1t was before Rosh Hashanah, because I remember, you know, the --\nthe houses were right on the seaside. For Rosh Hashanah, a lot of people went into the ocean for\nlike a -- you know, doing the cleaning, for a mikvah. So --",
        "Q: This is all 1940 still?",
        "A: 1940, yeah.",
        "Q: Who -- was it only Germans there, and were there any women, or only men?",
        "A: There -- there was a women\u2019s camp somewhere. I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t know -- can\u2019t remember\nwhere it was any more, but there were only men, you know, in case -- there were only men in the\ninternment camp. The -- yeah, the -- as I said, the life was very -- start getting very organized,\nthere were a lot of classes. You could learn anything you wanted, people taught just about any\nsubject you could think about. And of course there were a lot of aus -- Austrians there. There\nwere very good lectures on psychology, and very intensive classes on -- on -- also Jewish\nsubjects. Mathematics classes. I remember I started learning mechanical drawing there, and there\nwere people who were teaching automobile design and things of that nature [indecipherable] was\nvery -- intellectually very, very active.",
        "Q: These are just classes taught by the other people who were being kept there?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s right. All self organized. Well, I don\u2019t know when it was, I think it was\nOctober, November, they had the -- there was an announcement that the age of entry into the\narmy for enemy aliens, whi-which we were, had been lowered from 20 years to 18, I think. So, I\nhad actually tried to volunteer for the army before that, but because I -- I still saw that eventually\nwe wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid it, but I was too young. Then they lowered the age, and a few\nBritish Jewish officers came around, and organized meetings. Had a big meeting in -- in the\ninternment camp and told us to come and volunteer for the army. Well, I -- I volunteered. It was\nsomewhat resented by some people. A lot of people said that they will join if they were free men,\nbut they wouldn\u2019t join from internment camp, things of that nature. But I thought that was\nneither one way or the other, and that they eventually will have to go one way or the other\nanyhow, so might as well g-go and do it sooner than later. I d-definitely wanted to get out of\ninternment camp. And --",
        "Q: Was it a -- was it also a -- even though it was intellectually a -- a per -- you know, a period of\nfruitful intellectual activity, was it also just very harsh conditions, living conditions? What were\nthe living conditions like?",
        "A: No. Living conditions were pretty good, except again for this food business [indecipherable]\nthe living conditions were quite good. We -- we lived in houses. Of course, every room had --\nwas full of beds, you know, and there was one common room, a dining hall where everybody\ncollected for anything that\u2019s -- what wasn\u2019t sleeping. And -- and it -- it -- 1t was not -- it was not\na great hardship, no way.",
        "Q: Did you feel that it was unfair to -- to keep you 1n an internment camp?",
        "A: Well, maybe I did, but I -- you know, I -- I -- I felt a sympathy, with all the things you\u2019d read\nabout the -- the Quisling regimes, and the traitors that had been in Fr-France -- in -- in Holland,\nor Norway and Belgium, I -- somehow I -- I -- I sympathized with the British, that they had to do\nthis in order to make sure -- they couldn\u2019t j-justify -- before their own people they couldn\u2019t\njustify having us run around free in their country. So it -- it was more -- it was definitely done\nmore for morale and propaganda than for actually being afraid that things might -- sas -- there\nmight be spies amongst ourselves, and so on, so forth. So I -- I was willing to accept this affect,\nthat this w-was a necessary move that the government had to make. And then in -- I think it was\nbeginning of December 1940, it was my turn to -- to leave, and we -- I joined the Pioneer Corps,\nbut actually what was happening was we were -- we were ju -- went by boat and train from the\nIsle of Mann, first to Liverpool, and then to Ilfracombe, which is corn -- Cornwallis, or -- you\nknow, it\u2019s just -- just south -- in the far southwest of England. That was the headquarters for the\nPioneer Corps, the -- Pioneer co -- the alien man -- Pioneer Corps. The other members of the\nPioneer Corps were British s- soldiers, who had -- actually were very -- had come 1 -- were not --\nnot completely trusted because of legal difficulties, or were people who had -- were not fit at all.\nSo we had these German Austrian companies of the Pioneer Corps, that were made up of very f -\n- relatively very fit German Austrian Jews. And -- and the Pioneer Corps stayed there in\nIlfracombe in the southwest for a few weeks, for some sort of basic training, which of course did\nnot involve weap -- weapons. We were not trusted with weapons. And from there we went to\nYorkshire, my company went to Yorkshire, and -- which there w-was a big army camp, Ketray\ncamp, and from there we went to a very nice place in the -- the lake district, beautiful place\nwhere we build a -- a petroleum dump for storing gasoline. You know, it was all labor work. In\nKetray camp, I don\u2019t think we did that much labor yet, but then we went to this Sedberg. Now\nSedberg was in the lake district, a beautiful town with -- which had a -- one of these what\u2019s\ncalled public schools, which of course are these very, very private schools in England. And 1-1t\nwas pleasant, very pleasant to be there, first time a chance to go out and go to dances, and go to\nm-mix with the population, started having a girlfriend, things of that nature. Also, the other thing\nwas my father had a cousin in York. And I\u2019d never met them, but I knew they were there. And so\none Sunday I hitchhiked to York, and I came to know my father\u2019s cousin, who was the owner of\na very, very successful factory in -- 1-1n -- in England. I\u2019d heard about him, but I\u2019d never been\nthere, I\u2019d never been in touch with these people, but I just happened to go there. And on -- ona\nSunday afternoon, and I happened to find them at home. He had bought up a patent in Italy for a\nplastic which has what we would now call -- basically the structure of nylon. But he made it -- he\nmade it out of the milk that was rejected from the chocolate ma -- making process. And he sold\nthis -- his idea to Roundtree in York, the famous chocolate company, and he ec -- he got -- got\ntheir waste product, and he made this plastic which was called not Bakolite, but Gansolite,\nbecause his name was Gans, too. And they had this big factory there, very successful, and his\nhome really -- which was also one of these beautiful estates, almost in the center of York, his\nhome was sort of the rallying point for all of us Gans and related families from the American and\nBritish army, who happened to be in England. And this was -- this was a very, very nice c-\ncontact, and a very nice connection. I volunteered for every -- every damn thing that could be, to\nget me out of the Pioneer Corps. England was now alone. You know, the United States was not\nin -- not in the war, and Russia was -- had successfully divided Poland with hi -- with Hitler. So\nthey were not in the war. So the 1 -- the British had the idea that the only way they could possibly\ninflict a lot of damage on Germany was to have a huge Air Force. So they were looking for\nvolunteers for people to go into the Air Force. Well, I went to the examination, and all -- the\nexamination was in Blackpool, which was -- was about two or three hours by train ride from\nwhere -- from where I was. Passed the examination, was accepted in, but of course they -- they\ndidn\u2019t understand. When they f -- looked at my nationality they refused to let me in. But I had\nthe -- I ha -- for ye -- for a long time I carried around this piece of paper which showed that I had\npassed the part of the acceptance process for the Air Force. So that didn\u2019t work out.",
        "Q: And when is this now? What point?",
        "A: This is n -- this is now -- now, wait a minute, let me see. This is 19 -- it\u2019s nine 1940 -- four ni\n-- \u00b04]. It\u2019s 1941. And this -- you know, in -- in the meantime of course, th -- round about -- I\nthink it was in the spring of 1941, there was this meeting between Elizabeth and chur -- Churchill\non the high seas. America was still not in the war, but America had -- was giving for free, 50\ndestroyers to Great Britain on generally supporting -- supporting the British war effort. But th --\nRoosevelt could of course not go and -- and join in the war. There was far too much isolationism\nin the United States to allow him to declare war, but he was actually supporting the British in\ntheir war effort. And then in the summer of 1941, I don\u2019t know the exact date any more -- of\ncourse, from one minute to the other, Hitler moved his armies against Russia. It\u2019s apparently just\ntotally expected by both the British and the Americans. They had made all the provisions just\nwhat -- what they were going to do when this event would happen. I wish I would have copy\n[indecipherable] if you could get it off the streets that Churchill made that night when -- when\nGermany invaded Russia. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very applicable to our present situation in Iraq. He said\nsomething like I won\u2019t take back anything I have said against Communism, but I see a people\nnow being faced with a totally different ideology. I see the ordinary Russian people, and -- be --\nbeing faced with an -- a representative of an ideology that 1s totally alien to them, and I\u2019m sure\nthey will resist against it. [indecipherable] all this was -- I -- I -- I have to find the actual speech.\n[-I-It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very, very significant.",
        "Q: And this whole time you were in the Pioneer Corps, still?",
        "A: Yes. Now -- I were -- things were loosening up. They allow -- we were allowed to -- we were\ngetting weps -- we were now subject to weapons training, and felt more -- by this time, I think\nwe were in Edinburgh. As a matter of fact, I -- we were working in a anti-aircraft unit that was\nthe first mixed sex -- sex mixed anti-aircraft unit in the -- in -- in Great Britain. And it was a\nvery, very interesting experience, too. Also some very lovely girls there, no doubt. And later on\nwe went to -- to Glasgow, and we worked -- we started working building an ammunition dump\nfor -- let me see, can\u2019t remember exact date any more. I think by this time -- can\u2019t remember the\ndate, six -- ha-have -- have to think this out, but I have a feeling that we were building this\nammunition dump for the Americans. So that must have been after Pearl Harbor then.",
        "Q: And when did you get this rare opportunity that then came your way?",
        "A: Well, as I said, I -- I volunt -- volunteered for everything, and I think it was the end of 1942, I\nthink. By that time I had made my name in the -- in the unit. See, you know, th-these -- these\nPioneer Corps units were full of people who were -- who knew how to boast, and push\nthemselves forward very much. They were all experts at everything, you know. And I -- I, of\ncourse, I never participated very much in -- in -- in sports that were open to many people, things\nlike that. Well, one day I remember we had a -- they were -- they had a fo -- a race, a su -- sort of\nlike a sports day, and the -- you know, running a 400 meter, you know, this is actually one round\non -- and that was the major event there. And of course there were all these guys there who had\nbeen such champions in all their Maccabee clubs, and God knows, all over the place. Well, I did\nthe run, and I won it so easily. And now I had made my name, you know. I -- I -- I hadn\u2019t\nrealized myself how -- how -- how f -- much better I was at sports than all these people who were\nso -- boasting continuously about their powers, you know? A-And I knew when w-we were near\nGlasgow at the time, and we were billeted on pr -- in private homes -- you know, we were not\neating there, but were -- just slept there. Had a -- had a -- when -- I remember when I went home,\nI knew this was going to be the change of my life. And so it went. When eventually the call came\nfor people to go to something very, very special, I was one of the first who was s-selected to --\nbut there being -- after this event, we started a -- we competed in many, many different sports\nevents, and I was always very much the center of everything of the team that was sent by our\nunit, to all these sports event -- events, and I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve -- I was running on -- on -- on a cloud,\nyou know? So I think it was at the end of 1942 that I was -- went to London, and I was\ninterviewed by a man who had the uniform of a captain, and who obviously knew an awful lot,\nand knew what he wanted, and that turned out to be eventually the skipper, you know, he\u2019s --\nhe\u2019s all on the pictures there. I -- I s-should have gone through these pictures before with you.",
        "Q: Yeah, well you can show me at the end.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: We can look at them.",
        "A: And also then, we were interviewed by somebody from MI-five, who was supposed to make\nsure all on your background, and -- very knowledgeable people, very, very knowledgeable. You\nknow this [indecipherable] combination of the CIA and the FBI. And I was absolutely sure that I\nhad been accepted. I had no doubts about it whatsoever. And then, a few weeks later, or two\nweeks later, the [indecipherable] called to the [indecipherable] told me, and maybe three or four\nothers to go to the Pioneer Corps center in -- in Yorkshire. I think it was in Yorkshire, horrible\nplace. And there -- from there we were taken on a train by night, and the next morning we\narrived in Abu Dhabi, which was the training pl-place for [indecipherable] commando. And there\nwe changed our names, changed our identities. Within two hours, we all -- we had a false\nhistory, a false name, and that was it. And that was the beginning of the -- being in the\ncommandoes.",
        "Q: What was your false name and your background, your identity you were given?",
        "A: My name was Fred Gray. I spelled it a-y. And we were all s-supposed to say that we were\nBritish by -- by nationality, but that our fathers, our parents had been assigned to such and such a\n-- m-my case it was, of course, Holland, since I spoke some Dutch, it was easy to do, had been\nassigned to -- to -- had -- had lived in -- in other countries. And so that\u2019s the reason why we had\ngrown up in -- abroad, but we were British by nationality.",
        "Q: What was the main qualifying factor for being part of this troop?",
        "A: That you spoke German without an accent. This was extremely important. We didn\u2019t realize it\nat that time, how important this would [indecipherable] be. I only can ta -- give you one statistic.\nI must have caused the surrender of about 10,000 Germans [indecipherable] without a fight. I\ndidn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t realize it at the time. We were supposed to do long distance patrols,\nwe were supposed to do interrogation on -- on the battlefield, which we did, and which were very\nimportant. No doubt these were very important, because you know, we could interrogate the\nprisoners right there and then on the battlefield. And we had been trained for that. I had been to\nthe intelligence school in Cambridge, in -- in England. And so -- and that -- that was extremely\nimportant, no doubt about it. But the ability to walk into a German position and persuade people\nto surrender without fighting, proved more important than anything else. A-Anything else we\nlearned. After all, we learned everything. Mountaineering, parachute jumping. Anythi -- we\u2019d\ndone any -- everything there was to be done. But it -- the -- the ability to walk into a ger -- walk\ninto a German position and talk to them as if you were one of them, this was the main\ncontribution, as it turned out to be, for the war for us.",
        "Q: They would see you, of course, in your uniform, and you would appear to be, you know, a\nBritish, you know, soldier, or -- you know, but -- but you\u2019re saying the fact that you spoke\nwithout an accent was also more convincing to them, somehow, to get them to surrender?",
        "A: Yeah, ju -- obviously there had to be some sort of infiltration and some fights before that,\nwhich you may have read about in the stories in which I wrote about [indecipherable] when we\ndid this repeatedly, or in France. You -- there had to be some sort of infiltration before that, but\nonce you were in that position, you -- then we were very, very persuasive. Don\u2019t threaten them\nwith a gun, just tell them quick how many --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nManfred Gans. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "A: Again, they said that was not necessarily what was planned for us, but this was what turned\nout to be our greatest asset.",
        "Q: Who was in this troop, the numbers of people, and what was their background?",
        "A: There were 87 people in the troop, and they were all, I think this -- with the exception of one\nor two, they were all German or Austrian Jews, meaning Jews by the t -- by Hitler\u2019s definition. A\nlot of them by wh-what we call Halachak definitions are not Jewish, because they had a -- a\nJewish father, and a non-Jewish mother. Quite a number of those, quite a number. Of course you\nknow a couple like that had to leave Germany very early, otherwise life was impossible for them,\nand a lot of them did leave very early. So by what we used to call Halachak Jewish law, Jewish\n[indecipherable] maybe 75 percent of us were Jewish.",
        "Q: And was this -- do you think this was an important qualification that -- that they were looking\nfor, that the British actually chose Jews?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t choose Jews, no. Those -- Montgomery -- I\u2019m sorry, Lord Mountbatten. Lord\nMountbatten, who was in charge of combat operation, who was -- you know, he\u2019s -- is the uncle\nof, you know, Prince Philip, the husband of the queen, he da -- his -- I think his parents had gone\nthrough some sort of experience in World War One, and he was in combat -- in charge of\ncombined operation, which consisted of the units of the army, largely commanders, Air Force,\nand Navy. And he came up with the idea that he had to have German speakers somewhere, and\nthat he needed really good German speakers, so he -- he sold that idea to Churchill, and\nChurchill was very enthused about it, and Churchill said that the troops should be called X-\ntroops. But of course that name had to be dropped, it was too suspicious. And then, you know,\nwe became a [indecipherable] of the inter-allied commando. That\u2019s how we were -- were -- how\nwe were known. Was a commando which had units, Belgian units, French units, Polish unit --\nunits, Norwegian unit, and well, that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: So previously I never knew about this troop, do y -- and I\u2019m wondering if -- 1f it seems like\nit\u2019s been -- not only at the time, I guess it was kept secret, and -- but has it been sort of a well\nkept secret even -- even now?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s just -- not kept secret, but you know, we all went our different ways. The -- the\nskipper, the head of the troop got injured in France, you know, on a long term patrol, and he was\ntaken prisoner, and he was -- did not return until after the war. He wrote a very nice assessment\nof the troop back in 1946 or so. And -- you know, we were all, after the war we were all -- we --\nwe didn\u2019t particular think that we had done such great things. We were -- we were involved in\nour own careers, had to make a living. Potential wives, girlfriends, were not interested in what\nwe had done during the war. What they wanted was to get married and make sure that we had\nenough money to -- to have children and all that. And particularly this was the attitude of -- of\nthe parents of all our potential wives and girlfriends. So the whole idea was not really -- we da --\nwe -- we didn\u2019t care to -- we didn\u2019t have any reunions until maybe the 40\" anniversary of D-\nDay, and wh-what was that? That would have been in 1984, right? Yes. I -- I think that the first\none was 1984. And of course it\u2019s the -- Peter Maas\u2019s book that really brought all this out into the\nopen, better than anything else.",
        "Q: Did you realize at the time how unusual this was, that you were, you know, Jewish, and able\nto train to fight and obviously eventually go to an area where, you know, Jews were so\npersecuted?",
        "A: Yes, we -- I was very much aware of it. I was very much aware, and so were my friends, that\nthis was something totally unique. My -- my closest friends were very, very supportive of all\nthis, and they realized what were -- what had happened. But it -- but 1t remained a unique\nexperience. We -- and, you know, my experience of course was very -- almost very different\nfrom everybody else\u2019s experience. First of all, I refused to go to the officer\u2019s training school. I\ndidn\u2019t want to miss the war. My -- my closest friends in the [indecipherable] troop went in to\nofficer training school for four months just before D-Day, and of course they missed most of the\nwar. I absolute refused to go. I wer -- and then there came an order from the British army\ncommand that people were not to be promoted to officers in their field without going to officer\u2019s\ntraining school. Well, I didn\u2019t care two hoots about it, but 1t so happens that of course I was\nattached to a Marine unit. And the Marines didn\u2019t have to take any notice of all these army un1-\nunits. I was with the Marine commando, and one day they colonel said, \u201cTell me who you really\nare. I -- I want to make -- I want to put you in for be-becoming an officer.\u201d",
        "Q: So speaking of your other identity, what was that like to assume a different identity?",
        "A: Oh, it was very handy. You know, I -- I had no difficulty with it. And you have -- in England\nyou have the desire to submerge yourself. It\u2019s not like American society. You know, if you tell --\nin those days, it\u2019s very different now, very different now, in those days if you told a British\nperson -- a British person, I\u2019m going to be naturalized, and become British, and they would say,\n\u201cYou? You\u2019re not British.\u201d You know, tha -- but here, people -- you come in this country, and\nit\u2019s -- the people ask you when are you going to get your naturalization, or have you gotten it\nalready, you know? And braka -- hurry up, and so on, so forth. Totally different attitude in this\ncountry. But -- so. you had a desire in England to submerge yourself and pretend that -- were --\nto be something that you were not. And -- so that suited in very, very handily. Of course, I had to\ngive up being an Orthodox Jew, in doing that, you know? But --",
        "Q: How difficult was that for you?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s -- it was part of -- this was part of the sacrifice you make. I want to tell you a story\nwhich is very, very interesting, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve not told it before. When we were in the Isle of Mann\nin the inte -- internment camp -- as I said, we were Orthodox Jews living together, there was a\nman there by -- he was the son of Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg. Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg\nwas known as a great Talmudist, very ultra-Orthodox who had come out of Hungary to become a\n-- arabbi, chief rabbi of -- of Hamburg, in Germany. His son was regarded to be far superior to\nthe father, as far as brain and knowledge was concerned. And one day t -- one day to the other,\nthe son decided that a rabbinical career was not for him, and he wanted to go into law. He knew\nTalmudic law fantastically, and he then went and became -- took his legal papers in Germany. Of\ncourse he couldn\u2019t practice by the time he\u2019d finished. So, you know, he couldn\u2019t be a lawyer,\nJewish lawyer in Germany any more. But he was with me in there, in the same house in which I\nwas in -- on the Isle of Mann. And he -- he was a tall man, good looking man, always -- he did\nnot run around with a yarmulke, he run -- was running around with [indecipherable] golf cap --\ngolf cap [indecipherable], but I mean, he was a ultra, ultra-Orthodox Jew. Extremely well versed.\nI mean, a lot of the things which I have learned, attitudes which I have taken on Halachak and\nJewish law, I\u2019ve learned from him. Well, the day when we -- we volunteered, when I and two or\nthree other people in the house volunteered for the British army, it came out -- we went into our\ndining room where -- which was the only common room there was, and we announced to people\nthere that -- what we had done, that we volunteered for the army. There was a fellow there by the\nname of Josele. Well, Josele was a devoted Yeshiva student, absolute -- not too brilliant,\nabsolutely devoted to -- to [indecipherable]. He got very, very upset, and he said, \u201cIf y -- you --\nwhat you doing 1s you will have to work on Saturdays, you\u2019ll hardly be able to eat kosher food.\nYou will have to starve yourself to go. This -- the fact that you volunteer for this army, it just\ngoes to show that you put your secular existence far above your Jewish consciousness.\u201d And in\nthe corner was this ra -- Spitzer, the lawyer rabbi, and he was sitting behind his books. And he\ncame out, he -- he looked up from his book, and he said, \u201cBut Josele,\u201d -- remember, this in 1940,\n\u201cit\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s not a mitzvah -- mitzvah to fight Hitler?\u201d Josele, he had a totally different -- totally\ndifferent attitude to this -- to -- he saw the larger implication, in spite of the fact that by that time\nthere had no -- not been concentration camps, mass extermination and all that sort of thing. You\nknow, after all this was all st -- still to come. But it stuck -- stuck -- stuck into my mind, and --",
        "Q: Did that influence you at the time, too?",
        "A: Yeah, and this, you know, this is -- this is why I was willing to accept -- accept whatever it\nmeant, or whatever I had to do, because -- including giving up being an Orthodox Jew, when the\ntime came to be at the commandoes.",
        "Q: Now, while you were in the commando, did you still, in your own personal and private way,\nwas religion important to you as -- as you went through those war time experiences?",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- ina sort of general way, yes. But you know, there was too many other things we had\nto concentrate on to -- to even start thinking about all this. I -- I -- to me the Jewish religion is a\nset of ideas which I practice, and it\u2019s -- I -- I\u2019m not that comfortable in praying because the\nprayers to me are -- have a great depth, but they are an idiom that we cannot relate to. And just as\nyou find in a lot of ultra Orthodox Jews, they rather sit down and study the Talmud than go and\ndo -- do prayers. And -- and you know, this is -- so you had a guidance there, and -- when it was\nabsolutely needed, but that wasn\u2019t very often. And I -- when I was in difficult situations, I did not\n-- not pray. I remember that one [indecipherable] one -- you may have read this story I written\nabout Pontlivek, when I suddenly found myself in this German artillery fire, very much exposed,\nand I just -- I -- you know, I s -- I sort of said, get me out of this. Bus -- was addressing wa -- I\nwas obviously addressing a higher authority, like God or so. And -- but it -- 1t required moments\nof that nature to make -- to make me -- to make me even think about -- about religion. Normally\nthe concentration had to be all on techniques. Going through a minefield, doing this and that and\nthe other. Always a technique we had [indecipherable] out. You had to concentrate. There was\nno time to -- to think of anything else. And that\u2019s [indecipherable] made it all possible.",
        "Q: So tell me about D-Day. You -- is this the first time that you -- you entered --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- into actual war time fighting?",
        "A: Yes, it -- yes. We had -- we had been -- we had tried to do certain raids on France before D-\nDay, by parachute, and certain missions were planted, or didn\u2019t come off, some of them, bec --\nbecause we always -- when you were -- when a -- when a force like that went out by parachute,\nthey had to go out with the massive bombers that attacked the American and British bombers that\nattacked [indecipherable] Germany at the time. So you had to blend in, and then you drop -- you\ndrop out and do certain things. Well, none of these things came off, partially because of bad\nweather, partially because the information was obtained from different means and so on, so forth.\nSo, though we had been prepared for certain raids, and some of us had been on certain raids, I\npersonally had not been in any actual fight until D-Day. We were sequestered -- oh, let me go\nback a little bit. The -- our troop, the German speaking inter-allied commando troop was split up\njust before D-Day, when there were four or five of us attached to every invading commando\ntroop. I was assigned together with a fellow by the name of Morris Latimer, whose -- and the\nSergeant Major of the troop, O\u2019 Neill, and a fellow by the name of Tommy sw-Swenton. These\nare all these cover names of course. Morris Latimer, for instance, was Morris Levi from the\nSudetenland before he joined that troop. So we were assigned to 41 [indecipherable] Marine\ncommando. And we were held in camps for I think two or three weeks while we were being\nbriefed about the landing. And w -- we couldn\u2019t communicate with anybody outside because\nthose -- they were -- didn\u2019t tell us where we would land. We knew -- we had -- we saw maps, for\nwhich people who really knew France well could have guessed where this was. But I\u2019m -- we\npersonally, we didn\u2019t know where it was going to be. We didn\u2019t know we were going to land in\nNormandy. So we were in these camps for about two or three weeks, and then one evening, total\ndarkness, we were -- we embarked into little boats, infantry landing boats, which had -- each\nboat had maybe something like 80 people. And the -- all flotilla set out without light, without any\nintercommunication, in a pitch dark night. And as far as I know there were no -- no accidents.\nWe sailed past the Isle of Wight in total darkness, couldn\u2019t see anything at all. And -- and that\nwas it. The sea was not too rough, it was acceptable, and we -- as we approached, as we came\ncloser to the coast in the morning, well, it must have been about six or seven o\u2019clock in the\nmorning by the time we landed. But before that we could start to see the massive bombardment\nof the coast, and the shooting back of -- of the -- of the German guns back to us. And one of us\nalways sat on the steps, so that s -- way you could look out and sort of gave a running\ncommentary on what was happening, what he was seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the\nGerman [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells started falling nearer to us. Lucky tha --\nluckily we were not hit. And now, before all this, while we were in the camps, Montgomery, the\na -- the British commander had come around, and he had said, \u201cLook, every time there\u2019s a\nlanding, everybody sticks to the beach because they want to be protected by the Navy. Get off\nthe beaches. You can -- don\u2019t,\u201d -- and that struck me as being very, very significant. The really\ntr-trust that the British have in their Navy, that I could see that the soldiers wouldn\u2019t get away\nfrom the beach. And I was absolutely set I was not going to let this happen to me. So, when --\nwhen the -- the -- the -- our boat approached the -- the coast -- and of course as I said, we now\nwere under direct fire -- as soon as I could, I run down the gangway, and I got -- got down -- was\non the beach, and lo and behold, I saw about 25 German soldiers who had been taken prisoner by\nthe engineer\u2019s unit that has preceded us, who were supposed to blow up the obstacles, the anti-\ntank obstacles that were on the beach. And so I run over to those Germans, and I say to them,\n\u2018\u201c\u2018Where\u2019s the pass through the minefields?\u201d Well, you know, at that time -- a few days later I\ndidn\u2019t have any fear of mines any more, but at that time I still was very much aware. And lo and\nbehold, when I didn\u2019t threaten them, and, you know, about being -- talking their own language,\nthe first thing that occurred to me is these guys look exactly like us German Jews. Different\nuniform and they could be on our side. And lo and behold they told me. I didn\u2019t threaten them, I\nhad the tommy gun down. I just said, in a very calm way, \u201cWhere\u2019s the pass through the mine\nfields?\u201d And they pointed it out to me. And so I gathered as many people as I could, and I\u2019d\ngotten through the -- gotten off the beach, and gotten into Lyon sur Mer without a single\ncasualty. So the -- the -- the -- that -- that was, that part of it, that was off, and actually we lost 50\npercent of the unit. Out of 450 people we lost 50 percent on that day. Later on, when we made\nthe landing in Washoe, in -- which was much more heavily defended than the Normandy\nbeaches, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the\nlanding. But by that time we were so experienced that nobody could come equal to us. And\neverybody did the same as I did, get off the boat, get over the beaches, forget about it and get\nout.",
        "Q: So this was the -- the end of D-Day for you?",
        "A: No, not at all. This was the beginning of D-Day. Now, they -- we n -- we knew where the\nGerman strong points were, and we were at the other end of the village. Luckily, the pass\nthrough the mine field was at one end of Lyon sur Mer, and the German strong point was in the\nother. I had no doubt where we were. You know, we had studied the maps sufficiently. I knew\nwe were at the other end, we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong\npoint. Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their strong points. Why should they be\nout on the road, in the French villages? The French who have murdered them, you know? So, the\nfirst thing, I gather up a few guys, we started making our way along the road that was le -- going\ntowards the German strong point. But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the streets, I -- and\n-- when it -- when it comes to -- when there\u2019s so much artillery fire and mortar fire. It\u2019s -- the\nsplinters will carry. So you have to go from one door to the other, dive in and dive out. And of\ncourse the population was on our side. They willingly opened the doors for us. So I says you\nknow, you couldn\u2019t do this in Germany. We knew that we would never be able to do this type of\nstreet fighting in Germany, and we didn\u2019t intend to do it, and the British high command saw to it\n-- had come to the same conclusion. So we were diving from one house into the other. In some\nhouses actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment\nby one side or the other. In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the road first, there were some\nBritish soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the street when the -- when a\nshell exploded. You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditions. So we worked our way\n-- a few of us worked our way towards the strong point. When we got into this position where we\nthought we were about in the view of the strong point, we knew there was an anti-tank gun\npointing at us down the road, we got off the street, we got into [indecipherable] abandoned\nhouses, which was quite obviously that we were now very close to the strong point. And I went\nupstairs and tried to look out and look into the strong point, but some German sniper must have\nseen me there, and he fired at me, but thank God he missed. So I rushed downstairs again. I think\nI -- so I went down into the house, and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next,\nwhen we heard a loud bang on the house next door. And ta -- so -- obviously some missile was\ngoing from our side into the strong point. So we really didn\u2019t know what the hell this was. We\nwere absolutely sure that apart from our -- our people there could be nobody there. So we went\nthere, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed\nthe Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that. And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war\nfront loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German\nstrong point. So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient\nin those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the\nmeantime. But we persuaded him that he should join us, which he gladly did. And he was with\nus for -- until the winter of 1944 -- \u00b045. So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go\nwith him and look at all the different positions which the different troops of 41 commandos had\nnow taken up around the German strong point. And I went with him. And he was one of those\nguys who wouldn\u2019t take no notice of any German fire. He was running around with a briefcase.\nHis name, I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spelled it with e-y, and not a-y like I did. And he --\nhe wouldn\u2019t throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a\nmortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn\u2019t going to do this, so I dodged the way I\u2019d\nlearned to dodge it, and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured, he was\nout of the war. So, so much for somebody taking such incredible risks, were totally unjustified.\nBut then we had -- I -- a troop of South African armored vehicles came up and came into the\nvillage from the beach, and the colonel persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main\nroad to -- on -- on to the German strong point. Which was crazy. The way we did this later on,\nwe used armored vehicles, and even tanks, only as mobile guns. We had them -- h-hid them\nsomewhere in the field, and had them shoot and lay down covering fire while we went in.\nAnyhow, this attack totally failed. I didn\u2019t participate in it because I knew it would -- would be\npractically suicide to do that. But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando,\nY troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack,\nbecause as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was\na German [indecipherable] tank pointing right down the road. There was no chance that an\narmored car could get by that. So we hadn\u2019t -- we hadn\u2019t -- we had not succeeded in taking the\nstrong point on that day. By now it was getting late. We were in a -- on a farm outside Lyon\nsomewhere, and I also was getting extremely hungry, and I -- I found myself of -- a ditch that\nhad a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I took cover, and start -- started to prepare some of\nthe food which we had, it was -- I hadn\u2019t eaten all day long. I don\u2019t think we had eaten during the\nnight either. There was cocoa. There was -- I mean, there were drinks available, but I -- I didn\u2019t\ntake strong drinks because they slow down your reaction too much. And jus -- just at that time,\nthe -- there was a magnificent sight of massive numbers of allied gliders, British gliders come --\nbeing pulled by airplanes coming over, to land on the other side of Lyon canal, and they were\nsort of -- you know, you could see them being detached, going on their own, and coming down.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nManfred Gans. This is tape number four, side A.",
        "A: So this shows that things were proceeding along the way they were planned. Also, by this\ntime a German fighter came over and flew right along the beaches. And you know it says in the\nbook the longest day? That\u2019s -- he got away with it, nobody shot at him, but that wasn\u2019t true, lots\nof people shot at him, of course, nu -- none of us hit him. But, you know, it -- one fighter alone\ncould not make much of a difference, probably sent in to scare people off, but it didn\u2019t --\ncouldn\u2019t -- it wouldn\u2019t work in our case. So this was the first -- this was D-Day, it was the end of\nD-Day. I slept very well that night in my ditch. I needed it. Next morning, we continued what we\nwere supposed to do on D-Day, we were supposed to conquer German headquarters, move it\ninland. We were supposed to get the Lyon sur Mer strong point, and we were supposed to get\ninto Luc sur Mer. We had to -- not succeeded doing in any idle -- any of these things. So, next\nmorning the first thing we -- it was decided we\u2019 ll attack the German headquarters in -- inland.\nWell, that didn\u2019t tu-turn -- it wasn\u2019t much of a headquarters. This happens to be a battalion that\nhad just come from the Russian front and they were pretty decimated. And we decided we were\nnot going to go with covering fire, we were just going to run in and surprise them, and s -- which\ncame off beautifully. And s -- I found three Germans there who were obviously volgama -- the\nGermans call volgadeutshe, the German nationals from -- from Russia or Poland, they\u2019re -- very\nhard to understand them. I tried to get some more information from them, but they proved t-\ntotally useless. So then I turned around to take part in the attack on the Luc sur Mer strong point\n-- the Lyon sur Mer strong point, but by the time I arrived there, the strong point had given up.\nAnd th -- so, I was late. They -- I don\u2019t exactly know how -- I think it was B troop of 41\ncommando that was under the leadership of -- of very, very good officer, whom I had\naccidentally met already a year ago before that. And he managed to apparently get -- infiltrate his\npeople into the strong point, and get the strong point to surrender. So we went on, and the next\nstage was very simple. We got into Luc sur Mer very easily, and this -- this was the far end of the\nBritish Canadian landing, and now we were at the border of the American and British beach\nhead. And that was supposed to be our D-Day assignment, so this was the end of -- of our D-Day\nassignment.",
        "Q: Now for the rest of the war, if you could give me a sense just generally, the kind of\nmovements where you -- where you -- you know, what kind of territory you covered in general,\nand maybe there are a few things that -- that come to mind that particularly illustrate the kinds of\nthings you were doing. I\u2019m also interested, especially when you were able to get Germans to\nsurrender, were you able to learn important information from them along the way?",
        "A: I can say that important information that had strategic significance, I ca -- don\u2019t think I ever --\never was in that position. My idea was get as many of them to surrender as you can -- can get.\nFind some high ranking officer who will go with you and make everybody surrender. This -- this\nhas worked out to be ex -- excellent strategy, and this worked ma-many, many times. Now, I\nmust say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this\nand did not succeed in -- and -- and -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost\nwas in a similar situation, too. Well, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a\nrather unique experience besieging two underground German radar stations. They had been left\nbehind in the allied advance, and they were fully manned, and they were hev -- very, very\nheavily fortified, incredibly heavily fortified. And it was just decided that it was not worthwhile\nto make an attack -- a direct attack on them. So we were positioned around them, near -- near\nthem, and we were just as -- supposed to keep them on their toes, make believe that they were\nabout to be attacked. The -- the tra -- the trouble was that the allies were building -- had planned\nto build an air -- airp -- airport, an air [indecipherable] abou -- only about maybe a mile away\nfrom these radar stations. And that plan had to go ahead, you know, there were fields there that\nwere suitable for landing aircrafts on it, and this had to go ahead. And they couldn\u2019t take any\nnotice of the fact that these ger -- these underground fortifications were still there. So our task\nwas to make them believe that they were just about to be attacked. And -- which we -- which we\nsuccessfully managed to do for about a week or so. There were a lot of adventures that we had,\nwhere we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two\nlater when we had much more experience. But luckily most of the time we were -- we got away\nwith it. Eventually enough equipment was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a\ndaylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful. Again, I managed to get these guys out, to\nsurrender. So you had -- we took 450 people prisoner on -- on that day, and we marched them\ndown to the beach, to the -- t-to -- to the prisoner camps of which there were there, but we\nshipped out. That was an interesting experience which I\u2019ve written up in great detail. If you want\nto read, you can read it. After that experience, we went to the -- what we might call the eastern\nfront of the Normandy beach head, which was on -- we -- we were in the part that was hev --\nvery heavily fortified, which was still the extension of what the Germans call the Atlantic wall.\nAnd, of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war, because the -- we were always going along or\nthrough some hedgerows to get to our -- to find the German alliance, so [indecipherable], a-and\nth-this was a -- a -- oh, of course you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- of a experience, but we managed\nto keep the Germans on their toes with lots of patrols, and usually I had to go out on every damn\npatrol there was, because by na -- by now the troops, the Marines would hardly ever go out\nunless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La -- or I was present, Morris Latimer had been injured on the\nradar stations and he had went back to -- to England. The Sergeant Major O\u2019Neill was still with\nme, swent -- Tommy Swentin had gone home on deeplus two or three, he said he was shell-\nshocked. And O\u2019Neill was still there, but he was largely with the officers, so I hardly ever saw\nthem -- saw him.",
        "Q: Now let me ask you, the Germans you encountered along the way, did any of them question\nyou and th -- and even, you know, wonder if you\u2019re Jewish, and -- did you -- that ever come up,\nwas that ever a problem?",
        "A: No, no, no. As a matter of fact, that was the un -- unbelievable attitude. If somebody spoke to\nthem in fluent German, they thought that well, you know, we are -- we have -- of such high\nculture, of course other people speak our language.",
        "Q: So they wouldn\u2019t even guess that you were originally German?",
        "A: No, no, not at all. Not at all. Nobody even dreamt of it. It was -- it was unbelievable. And that\nI think is a -- a -- you know, of course ga -- cultured pe-people speak German, naturally, right?\nAnd I\u2019m sure you speak German, too. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not cultured.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. So -- yeah, and from -- from that -- so we got on the -- on the northeastern part of the --\nof the -- of the Normandy beach head. From there we shifted over to something absolutely\nterrible, the southeastern part, the southeastern corner of the beach head. Again, this was the --\nthe only thing that was lucky about it is there ha-had been a British guards battalion there before\nus, they had dug some way with trenches. We were now something like, maybe maximum 200 -\n300 yards away from the German lines. And the bombardment was day and night, mortars,\nartillery. Artillery is all right because you know it goes off and you can hear it coming and you\nknow what to do, throw yourself into a ditch. But the mortar fires were -- could be very\nsurprising, you know. We -- we -- we le -- it was o -- it was a lot like being in World War One, it\nwas trench warfare practically. But at night again, we went out on patrol, shot up patrols, we got\nshot up on -- on patrol and things like that until one day -- of course we were very much aware of\nthe fact of what was happening on the other fronts. The fact that the Americans were breaking\nthrough and going south, that they were going west into Brittany, and that they were swinging\naround as the British -- had been a terrible mass I-losses of germ -- of two and a half German\ndivisions in one night with that -- were poised for counterattack on -- on the British advance, th -\n- the Germans had not -- thought that they could keep this counterattack of two and a half\nGerman divisions secret, but they -- but of course it was all seen from the air, with the ability that\nthe British Air Force had to -- to look at all German movements, and so it came in with a very\nheavy -- before the -- the Germans could even start to move, came in with a very, very heavy\nthousand bombers attack. And most of these two and a half -- the people of the two and a half\ndivisions -- SS divisions, they -- they died through lack of ox -- oxygen, or lack of -- or ho -- of\nhi -- excessively high pressure that they ex-experienced being out in the open, being ready for\ncounterattack. That was -- then -- that was a -- none of these divisions appeared again for the rest\nof the war. They were SS divisions.",
        "Q: What was the most frightening episode that you experienced?",
        "A: I think that, you know, sus-sustained frightening, was the position we were in in Pontlivek,\nbecause we were a cross place, the Germans are at one side in a railway -- in a railway station\nand we were on the other side, and we were be -- behind walls at [indecipherable] but we knew\nthe walls were -- would not stand -- would not stand a anti-tank gun shot, and we knew that the\nGermans usually left -- with their rear guards they usually left an anti-tank gun. And that would\nhave gone right through us. But v-very soon -- th-this was realized that we were in too exposed a\nposition, and we were told to get -- get out of this position and just -- because also, the Germans\nhad left devices in -- in all the bedrooms of the houses, which w -- suddenly all the -- all the\nhouses around us went on fire, and -- you know, this was a sustained, longer experience. But we\nmanaged to get out of this, and get out and then we did what we did -- always did, we defeated\nma -- we made 10 night attacks in 10 days in that -- that -- during that time. So we were taken\nout of Pontlivek, was decided what we\u2019ll do is we -- we\u2019ll go around on the night attacks, and we\nsa -- we go past them, and don\u2019t do a frontal assault anywhere.",
        "Q: So, were you at some point starting to imagine that the war might be coming to an end? When\ndid you start to get a feeling that -- you know, that -- that this might actually be close to the end\nof the war?",
        "A: Not until very, very much later. I -- even when I -- the first time I got back into my own\nhometown in Borken, which was Easter Saturday, the town had been taken on the Thursday,\nThursday, that Thursday before Easter. I knew about it, and you know, by that time I -- I was an\nofficer, I could move around as I wanted to. Everybody supported me, and I went into Borken,\nand we -- even at that time we realized that things were not over. And you know, actually there\nwere quite a number of people from sweep of troop -- tank commandoes, who were killed before\nHannover. You know, this is hundred miles away, this is almost on the -- on the line with --\nwhere the two armies, the Russian and the -- a-and the ar -- western forces met. Even there, there\nwas still resistance. It -- 1t was just unbelievable. We knew this fa -- and they were fanatics, these\npeople. And the closer it was getting home to them, the c-ca -- th-the worse it got, and we had\nabsolutely no illusion about it, that -- that there was still some heavy fighting ahead of us at all\ntimes. We had -- we si -- it so happens that they -- they -- you know, we were on the Dutch --\nDutch front, it never lit up. We -- we never personally were involved. But at any moment we\ncould have been told get over to this and this and this position, and that would have been -- and\nthere would have been real fanatical resistance. There was a very good friend of mine, a German\nwriter, who wrote a -- a book called, \u201cFive Minutes Before Midnight,\u201d where he describes how\nthere\u2019s last minute resistance in this area, all the time, and of course he says this -- this led to the\ndestruction of all these towns in -- in our home district, because there were always some fanatics\nwho said they could hold out, and you had -- you had to -- had to take care of it. Quite apart from\nthe fact that we just knew if there was going to be an invasion of Japan, we were going to be in\nit. This unit had been in the invasion of Sicily, had been in the inva -- invasion of Italy, had -- we\nhad been in Normandy. We had done the invasion of Washoe. There -- no way was there going\nto be an invasion of Japan without us. So, the war was not over.",
        "Q: And you were -- were you able to, you know, have enough strength throughout? Was this --\nyou know, did you get used to living with just always having a certain amount of fear, or did that\nfear go away after awhile?",
        "A: No, w-we [indecipherable] particularly after we -- we felt very much experienced, battle\nexperienced, superior to the -- to the Germans. Better -- we were better equipped, we knew how\nto move better. A lot of their strength had gone out by too fanatical resistance. The fear -- the\nfear was not a real condition any more. Ve -- very, very confident what we could do, particularly\nafter the -- during and after the Washoe invasion. It was a -- was a terrific morale booster for us\nthat everything had gone so smoothly against incredible fortifications. So -- so --",
        "Q: Where were you at the end of the war? Where had you gotten to at that point?",
        "A: We were still in the south of Holland, in -- you know, the -- that part of Holland never\nsurrendered. Th-the Germans never surrendered at all until I don\u2019t know wh -- well after -- even\nafter we left. So, you know, I had heard through people who had been -- go-gotten to Switzerland\nin this exchange of Eichmann\u2019s, of Jews against trucks, that my parents were in Theresienstadt,\nso I was set to go there at the earliest possible moment.",
        "Q: When is the last time you had actually heard from them, or corresponded with them?",
        "A: I would say in 1941. There were still Red Cross letters, you know. 1941. A -- long before I\nwent into the commandoes. That was the last time I [indecipherable] then they went -- they went\ninto hiding too, but of course they got betrayed. That\u2019s one story I\u2019ve never written up and my\nbrother is always telling me to write that up, that story, because I confronted that guy, and he\nfinally got 10 years prison for -- but he done a lot of other things apart from betraying my\nparents. He had s-sold all the weapons of the Dutch underground to the Communists. When -- he\nwasn\u2019t a Communist, no way, but he was after money. He was state detective. So --",
        "Q: So at the end of the war, you -- you didn\u2019t know what had happened to your parents, but you\nstarted to hear. How did you hear about them? Who -- who told you?",
        "A: Well, as I said, there was this exchange of Jews against trucks, and some of these had gotten\nto -- family had gone to Switzerland. They wrote to my uncle in -- in New York, saying that my\nparents were in ter -- Terezin, and he wrote it t -- to my younger brother, who was still -- whose\naddress he still knew. Of course that nobody knew what I was doing, or where I was. I had a\ncover address and all that, and eventually that news got to me, that they were in -- probably in\nTerezin. And this is why I decided I want to try to get there. So after -- soon as I got permission\nto do that, I took a Jeep and a driver, and we drove all across Germany into the Sudetenland,\nwhich had not surrendered yet, still German divisions, it was still real German. Then we drove\ninto the Russian lines, and Terezin had been liberated by the Russians just two days before I\ncame there.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: This was -- I think I got to Terezin on May 12\", so I think it was -- must be May 12\" I got\nthere, or May 11\", something like -- or maybe it wa -- somewhere around that time. It was two --\ntwo or three days after -- after V-E Day.",
        "Q: So, first of all tell me a little bit about the journey to get there. Was it a -- a difficult journey,\nwhat -- what was it like, and what did you see along the way?",
        "A: The -- the journey was hard for us because we had so much trouble with the Jeep. But you\nknow, you could always drive into some British or American repair station, and they didn\u2019t fuss\naround very much, they gave you new wheels, they gave you new -- new shock absorbers, new\nbrakes, whatever you have -- whatever you needed could always be obtained pretty rapidly. But\nthen, you know, once we left there, w-we ca -- first we came accidentally into the Russian line. I\nhadn\u2019t wanted to do this, so I went back into the -- went back to American lines, spent the night\nthere. I described it in great detail in my report. And then, next morning we set out and we\ncrossed over into unconquered territory, the -- Germany has [indecipherable] to be. That\u2019s the\nnorthern foothills of the Atz mountains of the Sudeten mountains. And it was an interesting\nexperience to see Germany as it had been, officers strutting around and so on, but of course I\ncouldn\u2019t stop. And we went up into the mountains and came across two and a half German\ndivisions that were still there, f-fully armed. And they, I\u2019m sure, are the same divisions as I menti\n-- as I mentioned -- as -- as mentioned in the story of -- Schindler. You remember the Schindler\nstory? That when -- when they -- when he was going [indecipherable] to be rushed into the\nAmerican lines from the Russian lines, they -- he -- he -- he came across two -- two and a half\nGerman divisions. I\u2019m sure that those were the same divisions. Anyhow, we crossed that, went\ndown, and finally hit the Russian lines, and it was -- the Russians were so enthused when they --\neverybody wants to shake hands, and embrace you. You know, the [indecipherable] was a\nmanifestation of these two armies, western armies, and the Russian armies having -- having\ncome together, you know, there must have been millions of such encounters. But particularly\nthese people whom we met there, they had -- they had not been through this experience at all,\nand therefore they -- they were just delighted to see a western allied vehicle fully armed, with\npeople in it. This was their meeting of east and west, you know. Fa -- I forgot [indecipherable]\nthey looked as if they had come all -- all the way from Stalingrad, and this was, you know, the\nfirst German defeat in the f -- major German defeat in -- in Russia, and we had come all the way\nfrom the Normandy beaches.",
        "Q: Was it a very emotional time for you as well?",
        "A: N-No, I can\u2019t say so. I -- I -- I -- I was -- didn\u2019t feel emotional in those days, I really didn\u2019t.\nTher -- they were happy, we were happy, it was a great experience. This is what we had looked\nforward to, and -- [interruption]. Yeah, the attitude, thank God, was -- that I had was different,\nthat\u2019s right. ... I am -- when -- when -- when I got into the camp -- into the camp there, you\nknow, and again the officer at the entrance of the troops who were guarding the exit there, he\nwanted to shake hands, you know, make his contact with the western allied army, and then he\nsaid, \u201cLook, there\u2019s one area in this camp in which there\u2019s the -- what you call the zoif --",
        "Q: Typhus?",
        "A: Typhus, yeah, but he called it zoisha, of course, in German. And if your parents are in that,\nyou have to promise me that you\u2019|l come out and not go -- go, forget about seeing them.\nOtherwise I can\u2019t let you go back into your own army. So --",
        "Q: Was this trip dangerous, do you think, to go to Theresienstadt at that time?",
        "A: Yeah. Now that I think about it, it was just incredible what risks we took. Incredible. Was all\nthese -- first of all there\u2019s -- there\u2019s the danger of the car breaking down, what are you going to\ndo? And the second thing is, the Germans up in the Sudetenland. They were fully armed. They --\nyou know, they were there to -- to fight. But I -- like -- just like on -- on the -- some of the patrols\nI did, in open daylight. You rely on the fact that they\u2019re not going to shoot at a single vehicle.\nThey\u2019re too surprised to see just a single vehicle, just like they are too surprised to see -- see a\nsingle person coming, approaching them in a friendly way, you know? So people don\u2019t have\ntheir finger on the trigger in a position of that nature. So that -- that was the second danger. Now,\nthe Russians I think were very, very cooperative, but I also -- there were certain situations which\nI carefully avoided, such as ch -- taking girls out of the -- out of the concentration camp\n[indecipherable] be very inviting to do that, but we would have never -- would have never gone\nback with the Russians, you know. This is -- you couldn\u2019t do any of those things. So there\u2019s\nquestion of having enough gasoline, you know, there was no gasoline, and we -- we -- we were\njust loaded up with gasoline and we had to rely on the fact that we would get back into American\nlines before we run out of -- of gas. So --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nManfred Gans. This is tape number four, side B. So tell me about your first impressions when\nyou arrived to Theresienstadt.",
        "A: Well, first bi -- 1t was -- 1t was a -- pretty shocking experience to see people like this, you\nknow, in their -- their starved state. Some of them -- quite a number of them too weak to even get\nup -- get out of the way for our car. That\u2019s -- it was a -- that was [indecipherable] impressions,\nthe next impression I had is this -- these are all very familiar faces. These are the Jews amongst\nwho I\u2019ve lived all my life. So n-not that it struck me as being so emotional at the time, but this is\nwhat I realized. And I don\u2019t know who told me, maybe the Russian guards told me that there\u2019s a\nregistry where I could find out whether my parents were still there, or whether they -- or where\nthey would be. You know, I asked around and found my way to this central registry. And there\nwas still one girl working -- by now it was something like five o\u2019clock in the evening I think. We\nhad been traveling all day long without a break, without stopping for food anywhere. And I p --\nasked this girl -- gave her my name of my parents and she s -- she said, \u201cYou are extremely\nlucky. They\u2019re still here.\u201d So she said, \u201cI\u2019Il] come with you.\u201d So then went to the house where\nthey were. They were supposed to live in, you know, again you saw this terrible overcrowding,\nwent to -- I left the driver outside of course, and went upstairs. It was like people everywhere,\nyou know? There was just -- there was just no space for anything. It was like having people\nmove around you. So the girl then went to my parents, she found them, and [indecipherable] and\nshe told them, \u201cI have good news for you, your son 1s here.\u201d",
        "Q: Was it overwhelming to you at the time?",
        "A: No. No feeling. I was shocked to see my parents in the state they were, particularly my father.\nI wouldn\u2019t have recognized him, I -- a bit of a shock, y -- 1t was not -- it was not emotional\nexperience at the time. Now it is, when you think back about it.",
        "Q: Why wasn\u2019t it emotional at the time, do you -- do you know?",
        "A: No, I just -- Ij -- managed to f-fight down all my feelings for things. Shock yes, but deep\nemotional, no. Now -- now y -- now you remember this and you cry. Most of the time I couldn\u2019t\nhave done that. There was no -- no way. There was no -- were not my feelings.",
        "Q: Do you think it\u2019s because you had to be so strong and focused on fighting in the war?",
        "A: Yeah, yes. Yeah, I mean you had to do without your feelings. I mean, you know, it\u2019s -- you\nhave to overcome your feelings when you jump out of an airplane, you know? Particular if -- if\nyou jump out of an airplane through the bottom, and not through the side door. And things of that\nnature. Y-Y-You had to s -- just have to s -- s -- concentrate on technique and not -- not get\ncarried away with any emotion. Yeah, there\u2019s a good saying was -- they had in the parachute\nschool, the instructors, they told us always, if you start feeling sorry for yourself, get out of here,\nyou won\u2019t jump. Ge -- get out before you have -- before you\u2019re going to get your badge, because\nyou can still ge -- if you get frightened when you -- this was the British army [indecipherable]\nsays, \u201cIf you get frightened and want to get out, get out.\u201d They let you get out, but once you had\nyour badge, of course, it was your du-duty to go ahead and -- and jump. And th-tha-that\u2019s\nsomething -- something worthwhile remember, I -- I very often quote -- quote that, if you start\nfeeling sorry for yourself, you won\u2019t jump. Y-You know, you can\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves.\nWe\u2019re in the position where -- where we are, just our own choice. Maybe not by own choice, but\nthen we can\u2019t help it, and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: You say that you were shocked the way that your --",
        "A: My father looked like.",
        "Q: -- father looked, and what di --",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t have recognized him. If I had met him on the street I wouldn\u2019t have recognized\nhim.",
        "Q: What -- what was so different?",
        "A: Well, I mean, he -- he was, you know, he -- he was a well fed man before the war, and people\nshrivel up, you know, particularly in that situation in which they had been. They totally shrivel\nup. And he -- you can hardly recognize. They age. I mean that -- you know, after my father had\nbeen back in Holland for two or three weeks, he looked his former self again, you know? But\npeople changed totally.",
        "Q: What about your mother?",
        "A: She somehow -- somehow she was slightly different, she was more -- you see, my father not\nbe -- having only one lung and one leg, was probably more subject to -- to these hardships. And\nmy mother somehow had managed to live through it. She worked in the S.S. kitchen, stole -- s-\nstole the potatoes. Had no fear of these people, and somehow got through in a more positive way.",
        "Q: So what was it like, your -- your first, you know, reunion, what did you talk about? And --\nand tell me about that.",
        "A: Well, just about everything of course, you know. They had been totally cut off from the\nworld. They obviously wanted to ri -- wanted to know what -- what wa -- what had hap -- what\nwas happening to my brothers, and they wanted -- wanted to know about all the other relatives,\nmy mother\u2019s sisters, and my -- my fathers relatives. You know, we\u2019re family oriented family.\nAnd they had a -- they -- they were amazed that I was an officer. Of course they couldn\u2019t\nrecognize British ranks. They were amazed that I was a paratrooper. They had no idea what wa --\nall these insignia meant. And were absolutely in-incredible. And they want -- want -- and to --\nthey told a lot about their experiences, and what had happened, and in the camp on the -- then\nthey eventually were joined by other people who wanted to know what was happening in\nHolland. They were living in what was called the Dutch colony of the Terezin camp. You may\nhave heard about the group of young girls, [indecipherable] young girls, who were in Terezin.\nMy mother was very friendly with them because ya -- ha -- eventually was -- was going to be\nIsrael. And these -- a lot of these girls came to congratulate my mother, you know, and all that.\nMainly they wanted to know what had happened. They had no idea about the Normandy\ninvasion, only vaguely what -- what had happened there. They didn\u2019t know about the total\ndestruction in Germany, they couldn\u2019t believe it. I -- you know, I -- I -- I -- Ij -- I-- I -- I told my\nfather -- he -- he had one [indecipherable] he said, \u201cWe can never get r-revenge for this, because\nwe can\u2019t be that cruel.\u201d So I said to him, \u201cThe revenge has been, it\u2019s finished. It\u2019s not what we\nwanted, but this is ha -- this is what happened.\u201d And I tell him -- told him, in -- there is not a\nsingle -- in Muenster, which was the capital of our county, there is not a single house standing\nany more between this boulevard and that boulevard. It\u2019s like telling you, look there\u2019s not a\nsingle house standing any more between -- between 72\" Street, and -- and city hall in New York.\nEverything is destroyed. That gave him a concept of -- of how incredible the destruction had\nbeen. When I drove through Muenster, which I had known, through this massive rubble, where --\nbut you know of course the roads had been cleared by American bulldozers, because after all, our\narmies had to get through, all I met was one woman who was crazy, was on -- on -- on a ha -- on\na -- on a -- in black -- in a black dress, with all around was -- that was Germany. That was the\nrevenge. I don\u2019t remember what the -- the divisions, the two and a half S.S. divisions that had\nbeen blasted out of the s -- from the sky, and that -- that -- that died for lacks of -- lack of\noxygen. And they were supposed to be counter-attack. That was revenge. Nuremberg trials, none\nof them -- none of us thought of them. The revenge had been. It was -- 1t was the end.",
        "Q: Did a lot of people at Terezin want revenge? Is that something they felt --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t talk to a lot of people. People who -- whom I talked to were t -- were\nlike the justice of -- The Hague court of justice, who gave me a letter to Princess Julianna. They -\n- they wanted to have some certain practical things solved, like repatriation in -- in a hurry, and\nso on and so forth, which -- which I managed to have a hand in arranging later on. You know, it\nwas -- everybody had his own practical needs, nevermind go-going after things like revenge.\nThis was a -- a concept that people whom I talked to were not concerned with. They wanted to --\nme to take letters back. I must have taken something like 500 letters back, which the wife of a\nfriend of mine gave to the Red Cross in London, because of course I didn\u2019t have a postage stamp\nto send all these things out. So I put them in -- 1n a big parcel, and I got back to my unit in -- in --\nin Holland, and she send them to -- to London, and the wife of my friend took them to the Red\nCross, and they sent them out. And apparently most of them did arrive. [phone ringing]",
        "Q: So how did other people react to you when you came to Terezin?",
        "A: Well, as I said, they were concerned with practical things like please take a letter for me, and -\n- or do this and this and this for us. One guy came along, and he said, I own two factories in\nGermany in the Zarund, which 1s not very far from our -- my home, Borken, and I want you to be\nthe -- the manager of these two plants, because if you can come here and win, it\u2019s everything.\nAnd I told him, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not out of the army yet, you know? It\u2019s a long time pi -- we still have\na long war ahead of us.\u201d So people weren\u2019t -- the discussions were not -- not in any of these\nabstract subjects, they were very, very practical. Told them that in -- in Holland you had to pay a\ngilder, which is, you know, a lot of money, for just one potato, but the starvation was like in\nHolland, it -- 1t was occupied by the Germans, not in [indecipherable]. And th-those were the\nthings people were interested in, the practical things.",
        "Q: What about the fact that you\u2019d been part of this -- this British commando, and did that come\nup much, your involvement in -- in -- had they known, you know, anything about that?",
        "A: No. They -- they -- they had not known that they -- did not know that there was such a thing\nas a Jewish brigade, again. They thought it was of -- they -- a lot of them felt 1t was sort of\nnatural. We were in England, so we -- we -- we -- we did the fighting. As Peter Maas has once\nsaid, \u201c\u201cWe were the em-embodiment of all their dreams.\u201d",
        "Q: It seems like maybe it was, you know, an inspiration for them, a-at the end of this experience\nthey\u2019d gone through, to -- to see you. Did it feel that way?",
        "A: Yes. I think so, yes. I th -- I think it was -- some of the -- but some of they felt that they -- all\nright, this -- this is what you ha -- has to do, thank God you did it. We didn\u2019t have the chance to\ndo it.",
        "Q: What did you learn from your parents about what their experiences had been during the war,\nduring the time you weren\u2019t in contact with them?",
        "A: Well, they roughly told me what had happened to them when they were in hiding, and how\nthey had been -- how they were picked up, and they -- they went into this camp in Holland, in\nthis concentration camp, and they had a chance to -- my mother absolutely refused to let herself\nbe shipped out until she [indecipherable] forced to ship out. My father wanted to stay with a\ncertain group, but my mother thank God, refused, because that group went straight to Auschwitz\nto be gassed. And they -- my father had this letter, which he was hiding in his af -- artificial leg,\nwhere he were -- his deeds were acknowledged by the organization of the League of German\nWar Widows, Orphans and sa -- Injured People from World War One. He had a letter from them\nthat was written in 1934, thanking him for his fantastic service. [indecipherable] in view of the\ntime, you know, she has to give up that job. And se -- he -- he made the most out of this letter, to\nget himself promoted just in these -- these camps. The -- the fact that he kept his diary, which I\nhave in here by the way, he did -- didn\u2019t tell me at the time, but -- so there\u2019s something that was\ninteresting, and it came out later. Well, they -- they tried to -- they -- they tried to tell me -- th-the\nworst part for them had been these transports from one camp to the other. They had been in this\nDutch camp, and then they had been in Bergen-Belsen, and then after that they were shipped to\nTerezin, and it was this -- these long voyages on these horrible trains, on these cattle trains with\nthe S.S. in one of those, and -- and they were real -- that was a real horrible experience for them.",
        "Q: How long were they at Terezin?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So that first night, what -- what else happened the night that you -- you were at the -- at the\ncamp?",
        "A: Well, as -- as -- we -- we talked until about three or four o\u2019clock in the morning, and then we\ndecided to [indecipherable] myself down in someplace or the other, and decided to catch a little\nbit of sleep before it got daylight again. We had -- I had gone to the commandant of the camp --\nration commandant, and just to -- I don\u2019t know, can\u2019t remember what the motive was, but he was\nvery, very -- very, very friendly, and he -- but he also said, \u201cLook, you cannot stay here. By\ntomorrow morning, 10 o\u2019clock, you have got to be out of here, otherwise you\u2019re going to be\ninfected, and I can\u2019t let you -- can\u2019t let you go back to your own army.\u201d But he was very, very,\nvery friendly. Very warm feeling. His ti -- the mayor was very -- doctor [indecipherable] lady\ndoctor who speak -- spoke fluent German, or Russian. She did the translating. Thi -- thi -- that\nwas it. He [indecipherable] and I reported to him. I said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve come to look for my\nparents,\u201d he -- he wou -- turns to the lady doctor and said, \u201cHere, how -- how do we find his\nparents for him?\u201d And then she said [indecipherable] in the meantime already he was very\nconcerned about it. Very, very friendly atmosphere.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you go there thinking that if you found your parents you would try to -- to\nbring them out?",
        "A: I was absolutely settled not doing that, it was far too dangerous. The roads were dangerous.\nPeople threw hand grenades, fired shots, did all sorts of crazy things. Quite apart from that, I felt\nI had a duty to pick up as many American and British soldiers as I could. In the end when we --\nin the end when we crossed the American lines, the Jeep -- we had 18 people on the Jeep. Si --\nthe ex-prisoner of war, Americans and British, who -- who wants to get back and absolutely\nsettled on making it. Some of them were in very, very bad shape, too. And we managed to get\nthem across, and get them onto the buses to go to the Nuremberg airport for repatriation to\nEngland. Returned to England.",
        "Q: But your parents were not infected with typhus, right, they were generally healthy at the time?",
        "A: Yes, yes. They did not have any of the contagious diseases, so I had been spared that. People\nwho had these diseases were in what they called the -- the [indecipherable] the -- the castle.\nListen, I\u2019ve got to [indecipherable] now.",
        "Q: Okay. [tape break] Okay, if you could just tell me about then -- your -- after you leave, and --\nand what you -- what you do to -- to help people leave Theresienstadt eventually -- Terezin.",
        "A: Okay. So, I left, I picked up all these [indecipherable] of wars, went back into the American\nlines, and then th-the generals from these two and a half German divisions, which I had met in\nthe Sudeten mountains came into the American lines, and the American com -- local American\ncommander asked me to come with him to make these people surrender to the Russians, because\nthey had fought the Russians and therefore had to surrender to the Russians, that was the\nagreement we had. That\u2019s -- every German division surrenders to those whom they -- whom they\nhave been fighting. So the Americans could not accept their surrender, wouldn\u2019t accept their\nsurrender. So we returned them to the Russians. Now, so we eventually got back to my unit, and\nit\u2019s in the south of Holland, and I na -- went to see Princess Julianna, who was in ch -- chas --\ncharge of repatriation, and I gave her the letter, which the justice of [indecipherable] court had\ngiven me, and she said she wants to talk to me, but I didn\u2019t have a chance to do that. That\u2019s it --\nlater on, because by the time my unit moved on to Germany, and nobody to this day believes that\n-- believes me, but the first town we moved into was my hometown, and I had absolutely nothing\nto do with it, nothing. Nobody will believe this. What an experience. And there we actually -- we\nwere -- we weren\u2019t even the occupation force. The idea was for us to be equipped with new\nweapons to get ready for the invasion of Japan. So it wa -- it -- it was of course was incredible\nexperience to be right there in that town. We confiscated the best houses in town, to which Jews\nwould never have even been invited before Hitler, and -- [phone ringing] -- Yeah that -- that was\nquite -- quite an experience, to be back, out of all places, in my hometown. Well, I just don\u2019t\nwant to get into all the details, but actually [indecipherable] were -- my last job in the army was\nto be the deputy intelligence officer of a 12,000 people camp, 10,000 men, 2,000 women of high\nranking Nazis, largely preparing for the Nuremberg trials. A very interesting experience, from\nevery point of view, which I have rarely told anybody about, because even in Germany today,\npeople do not like some of the things that their relatives experienced while being in this camp,\nnot -- not that in my opinion they didn\u2019t deserve them, but this is what it was.",
        "Q: Such as -- such as what? What\u2019s an example?",
        "A: Well, you know, people were held in these camps, and -- who were -- who had been say of\n[indecipherable] of my hometown had been a guy who -- I only learned about this afterwards,\nactually -- who -- who had been a judge in Poland. You know, that\u2019s an automatic arrest\ncategory. Somebody goes to the judge, German judge in Poland, can you imagine that? And, you\nknow, you j -- obviously we were -- w-we prepared a case like that, we pec -- practically\ncondemned the guy to death already. He di -- that\u2019s not what they did to him in Nuremberg, but\nthey di -- they did get, you know, like the long sentences. So somehow or the other, I think\nthere\u2019s still too many Germans around who, if they know it at all about what went on at that\ntime, think that a lot of these things are very unfair. And they still cannot imagine all the crimes\nthat were committed in -- by say a guy who was a judge in Poland.",
        "Q: How did you feel talking to the Germans, interrogating them? What\u2019s the name of this place\nwhere you were, and how did you feel about it?",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Well, again, we had a job to do. Th-The British had a very good system of\nmaking us filling in certain questionnaire interrogating people. I filled in all the questionnaire\nwith a typewriter, because I typed on a German typewriter quite well in those days. And I -- I -- I\nhad no pity on any of these people. Most of them really deserved it. We had Mr. Armeyer from\nAuschwitz, and you know, he had been a commandant of the -- of Auschwitz for a while. And I\ndon\u2019t think before too long, I thought, hey, he was a common criminal, who was in prison with\nHitler. Hitler was in prison in the 20\u2019s. He was in prison for murder. And so, you know, he stuck\nto his Nazi regime, that\u2019s how -- how he made his career. We had 500 high ranking German\nofficers, who had spent their time in Norway during the war, who wouldn\u2019t believe all these\nstories that were being circulated around about concentration camp. So we made up a\n[indecipherable] I give them a lecture on what happens in Auschwitz. He describes it in great\ndetail, of how people came in, were -- were -- were -- were put into these so-called showers,\nwhich were of course the gas showers. [indecipherable] and we told [indecipherable] who was --\nthank God was stupid enough to believe that, that you know, he had got nothing to fear, because\nafter all, he only followed orders. And he described all this to these 500 high ranking German\nofficers. And these guys were stunned. Th-They don\u2019t -- there\u2019s a film, \u201cJudgment at\nNuremberg,\u201d where some -- something similar is being done. But you know, we did it. Ours was\nnot fiction.",
        "Q: Did you feel a lot of resentment?",
        "A: To whom?",
        "Q: To the Germans that you interrogated?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know what -- what you mean by resentment. What about y -- I -- I felt that these\nguys had to be brought to justice, you know. That we had -- had a to -- a totally different subject.\nWe had a major investigation of the attempt on Hitler\u2019s life in -- in -- when was it, in -- in June\n1944 -- July 1944? Was -- was after the invasion, wasn\u2019t it? Was it -- yeah, yeah, it was in July,\nso it must have been in July 1944, do you remember that?",
        "Q: I know you wrote a --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nManfred Gans. This is tape number five, side A. So I think we were just finishing up talking\nabout when you were interrogating Germans, and I was wondering if you had any other feelings\nor encounters with not the -- those who had been high S:S. officials, but sort of more the ordinary\nGermans, and if there were any kind of different feelings you had, or did you kind of hold them\nresponsible in the same way\u201d?",
        "A: I wa -- while I was -- the short time I was an -- actually a military [indecipherable], I -- of\ncourse I met a lot of ordinary Germans, and it -- I didn\u2019t have any prejudice against them. I was\nwilling to judge people on the basis of who they -- what they were, and who they were. It was the\n-- | -- we were go -- gotten quite friendly, I mean not friendly from the point of view of\nfraternization, but ma -- with s -- with some of the Germans who were obviously had been -- not\nbeen [indecipherable] Nazis, and who were constructive. We had to work for them. Certainly in\nmilitary government we did. Then, of course, they made the rule, very wisely, that no extra --\nextra Jew, or extra [indecipherable] could be in military government. It would be a very good\nidea if the United States had the same rule for Iraq now. It -- it -- it just 1s -- became -- was a bit\nof a shock that we had to leave military government, one day to the other, but I think it was an\nextremely wise decision. They wanted to show the military how -- the British authorities and\nAmerican authorities wanted to show -- no, I think it\u2019s only the British who did this, they wanted\nto show that they had confidence in the political leaders who were coming up wer -- like\nAdenauer and Schumacher, who were now coming up in Germany, and that they would not be\nsidetracked by anybody who had been -- who had left the country and who had not gone through\nthe same experience as these political leaders had gone through.",
        "Q: So when were you discharged, and how old were you?",
        "A: I was discharged in August, in ni -- 1946. At that time I was 24 years old, and wa -- in -- from\none day to the other I changed my name back, I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t [indecipherable] to Manfred\nGans from Fred Gray, and I was discharged on a Saturday night, and on Sunday morning I\nstarted studying for my entrance examination for the university, which I -- you know I had of\ncourse been back in England once or twice on -- on leave, and I tried to make arrangements for\ngetting into university. Now I wanted to go for chemical engineering because I -- there was a\ngovernment grant for se -- ex-servicemen, and now all these things that I had thought were not\npossible before the war, were now possible. The results of getting these -- what we -- you c-call\nin this country, G.I. grants.",
        "Q: And by now where\u2019s the rest of your family?",
        "A: Well, you know, my parents, of course died in the meantime. They -- they -- my -- my parents\nwent to -- c-came to Israel in 19 -- they were here fif -- that must have been [inaudible] I don\u2019t\nknow, 1950 something. I ca -- and you know they lived in Israel until they died. My father died\nwa -- he was 95, so -- yeah, in ni -- 1980 he died. So they lived a -- a very full life in Israel. Very\nfull, very good life. Course they -- you know, th-they had pensions, and -- and the restitution\nfrom Germany, my father fought like blazes for all those things, and he knew how to do it. So\nthey had a pretty good life.",
        "Q: And your brothers wound up in Israel, too?",
        "A: My -- ma -- my older brother, of course, was in Israel all the time. My younger brother went\nto Israel in 1952, I think. Yeah, \u201951 -- it must have been 1952, yes. Yeah, I think my parents went\nto Israel in 1953 or 54.",
        "Q: And when did you emigrate to the United States?",
        "A: I came here for the first time in 1948. I got married, and I went back to England, and came to\nUnited States for good in 1950.",
        "Q: So I just have a couple overall questions and then we\u2019re done, I think. When did you decide to\nwrite your memoirs about your experiences, and how long did that take you, and was that a\ndifficult process or -- or not.",
        "A: Well it -- you know, par -- part of it I had written before. I had written it for my niece in\nIsrael, the one who drew your -- your attention to my story. When she was doing -- she was\ngoing in for a master degree, and she felt that all she had to do was to translate my -- my holo --\nmy tere -- Terezin story, that will be enough. But the authorities didn\u2019t let her get away with that,\nso she had to pose a large number of questions to me, and I answered those. And a lot of it came\nout as such at that time. I -- you know, it [indecipherable] about -- must have been in 2002 or so\n[inaudible], about 2002 sometime, I started to write, sitting down and writing things up on the\ncomputer. And it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s been growing ever since.",
        "Q: Has it been hard to do, to write about these things?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes. It\u2019s ver -- ver -- th -- the main -- as I said, the main -- main hardship is not\nrecounting all the experience, but realizing what terrible risks we took. We were so\ninexperienced in the -- in the fighting stage, in the beginning. We learned pretty fast, I suppose,\nbut we -- we did things that were crazy, that -- that we would never have done if we had been\nmore experienced. That -- that part of it gave me nightmares, re-realizing how -- what -- what\nwrong steps we took.",
        "Q: Although it seems amazing to me that you have such detailed and vivid recall. Have you\nalways had that memory all along of -- of all these incidents?",
        "A: Well, I -- I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t think so, but I mean, these were very special experiences I have\nwritten up, and th-they -- you know, I recall them. If I was to recall all the experience I\u2019ve had in\nmy professional life, I don\u2019t think it would be quite that experience, but I\u2019ve had a very, very\nadventurous career in my professional life, too, and maybe if I sit down -- would -- would have\nsat down a year or two ago, and shud -- conjured up some of those experience again, 1t would\nhave been -- would -- they would have come back. But you know, you start concentrating, and as\nyou know, of course, these were very unique experiences. And so the -- Peter Maas\u2019s book has\nbeen quite an ex -- quite a motivation for it.",
        "Q: Are there certain sounds or smells that take you back to that time period?",
        "A: Mm, I don\u2019t know. I -- I -- personally I don\u2019t have a very good smell -- sense of smell any\nmore. No, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think that there -- that any of that nature would -- would take me\nback.",
        "Q: And when did you write about your journey to -- to find your parents? That was at a different\ntime, right?",
        "A: To find my parents? When I wrote up the story? The night I came back from the trip. I wrote\nthis whole story 1n one night.",
        "Q: And why -- why did you feel so motivated to do it right away?",
        "A: Because I wanted to inform all my friends of what I had -- what I had done. I didn\u2019t think that\nwas a historical document. Luckily, the guy who typed it up, who was in -- with my -- who had\nalso been in the unit already on D-Day, he said this is a historical document, I want to keep a\ncopy of it. So I wrote it up, and it took him about four or five days before he finished the typing\nof it all. And I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve given you one of the originals. I -- I can ge -- probably get a\ncopy of one of the originals, the way it was originally typed up. It\u2019s -- one of them is in Terezin,\nmy cousin deposited it in Terezin on one of their trips, the or -- original type, what this guy did.\nOf course, has mistakes in it. This one you have in there 1s -- which was done on a computer by\nmy secretary is -- 1s more correct.",
        "Q: And finally, do you feel that there have been things 1n your life, decisions, or the way that\nyou\u2019ve approached things in your life that come directly from, you know, the experiences, what\nyou went through during the war, what also, in general, the Holocaust, you know, that\nexperience?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s hard for -- it\u2019s hard for non-technical people to realize that, but the fact of the\nmatter is that I\u2019ve had a few -- if -- if -- as I\u2019ve done, if you put a large chemical plant on line,\nwith a new process, new, untried equipment, and all that sort of thing, the -- the experience is\nmore telling than almost anything I\u2019d done in the war. As I said in one of the comparison, on the\nnight of the fifth or sixth of June 1944, we landed in fra -- landed in Normandy, 1944, in the\nnight of the fifth and sixth of June 1957, I put a high pressure, or elevated pressure chlorination\nplant on line in -- in southern France, and I sweated more blood in 1957 than I did in 1944. But\nit\u2019s very hard for non-technical people to realize what 1s involved in the invention, development,\ndesign and start-up -- a commercialization start-up of a chemical process. That -- that\u2019s one -- on\naspect of it. So there have been very -- a lot of very interesting experiences. The highlight of my\nprofessional career, I suppose, was my giving a lecture in the University of Hanoi in 1986, to a\ntotally hostile -- hostile audience, trying to persuade them to give up doing basic research, when\nthey should do applied research, and you know, as I -- as I said, they were totally hostile, not\nwilling to listen. I -- as I said, in one state I was in the University of Hanoi lecturing 13 years\nbefore Mr. Clinton did so, and the atmosphere was still very different then. But --",
        "Q: I -- Is -- I think I read somewhere that you -- you\u2019ve also been back to Germany and have\nspoken to students there.",
        "A: Yes, regularly.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s -- what\u2019s that been like for you?",
        "A: Regularly. Oh that\u2019s a very interesting experience, very worthwhile. In 1988, on the\nanniversary -- or was it the -- the 50\" anniversary of Kristallnacht, they invited us back from my\nhometown, and we, the Jews, or a lot of us came back. My two brothers came from Israel with\ntheir wives. Everybody could bring one companion, my wife came along. And we -- I made a\ncondition for coming back, we made that we were going to be allowed to lecture in the schools.\nAnd the people were so enthused about what we did, that they kept on inviting us again and\nagain. I\u2019ve been there almost every second year, my younger brother, while he was alive, he s --\nhe died in the meantime, he went there back every year to lecture, and it was a very worthwhile\nexperience. I insisted on not only lecturing on my war experience, and the Holocaust and all that,\nbut also on Judaism, and the basic concepts of Judaism, which went down extremely well. It\u2019s a\ngreat privilege to do that.",
        "Q: And students you found were receptive?",
        "A: Oh very. Extremely receptive. They -- well, of course it depended a little bit as to who the\nteacher was. If there was a teacher that had prepared them for this, they were very much more\n[indecipherable] than if it was just somebody who let us cu-cut in. But this was a very\nworthwhile experience. And as I said, they paid for it. They gave us all expenses. I\u2019ve written up\na lot about these experiences. Unfortunately I have not [indecipherable] but when the BBC\nthought of making a film about my life, they wanted to incorporate this into their -- into that film.\nAnd no -- and just -- and th-they -- they, in fact they asked me, think you can get us some non --\nex-Nazis, who have not -- non -- what do -- ho-how do you call it, non-regenerated? The wa -- y-\nyou know? I said I can, yes I can. I know we -- we can produce it. It\u2019s still there. So --",
        "Q: Did you enjoy going back to Germany? Was there a part of you that enjoyed going back?",
        "A: I did, I enjoyed it very much, after the first experience. My wife in the -- the first time -- she\nonly went along once, she was very apprehensive about it, very apprehensive. She somewhat\nfrightened, but maybe she was already coming down with the sickness at the time. So --",
        "Q: And your -- in the house where you grew up, tell me just about the different stages it went\nthrough during the course of the war.",
        "A: Well, when my parents left 1t became Gestapo headquarters. And they even had a torture\nchamber in our wine cellar. And then it was taken over by the mili -- British military government\nas the headquarters for the district. This was when I came back there, only two days after -- after\nthe town has been liberated, the advance people were just mo -- moving in. It stayed that way for\nawhile, and after that they sold it, or they -- it was handed over to the German police. It became\npolice headquarters in the town for a little while, not very long. And then it went back into\nprivate possession. At the moment it\u2019s largely -- there are four lawyers in it, I think it\u2019s\n[indecipherable] their offices in there.",
        "Q: Do you remember the address?",
        "A: Yes, of course, Bochholderstrasse 48.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add?",
        "A: Yeah, can talk for a few more volumes if you want to.",
        "Q: I know you have a lot of experiences.",
        "A: I want to tell you one other little story that\u2019s very interesting. You know, when I was in --\npreparing these, we were in the zenolager, with high ranking Nazis who had to investigate the\nattempt on Hitler\u2019s life, inter -- interviewing some of these generals, you know? And I was\nasking them exactly what they went through in order to get into a conference with Hitler. These\nguys were hardly searched at all. It -- unbelievable, you know? I -- so I took all this down, and\ndidn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t say anything [indecipherable]. And I said -- said to one of those guys.\n\u201cYou goddamn idiots. You were not willing to take the risks which we on the -- soldiers on the\nfield had to take. It would have been so easy of you to -- for you to take out a pistol and shoot\nthis guy, and pilt -- ge -- get rid of him, and get rid of the war, and all that sort of thing. And if\nyou -- you -- after all, you had free access to him.\u201d So the guy said, \u201cBut captain, in view of\nField Marshall Sbaten, the spine becomes rubber.\u201d I -- I [indecipherable] understand. That\u2019s all --\nall they wanted to be, get a field Marshall, become a field Marshall.",

        "Q: They would see you, of course, in your uniform, and you would appear to be, you know, a\nBritish, you know, soldier, or -- you know, but -- but you\u2019re saying the fact that you spoke\nwithout an accent was also more convincing to them, somehow, to get them to surrender?",

        "Q: Who was in this troop, the numbers of people, and what was their background?",
        "Q: And was this -- do you think this was an important qualification that -- that they were looking\nfor, that the British actually chose Jews?",
        "Q: So previously I never knew about this troop, do y -- and I\u2019m wondering if -- 1f it seems like\nit\u2019s been -- not only at the time, I guess it was kept secret, and -- but has it been sort of a well\nkept secret even -- even now?",
        "Q: Did you realize at the time how unusual this was, that you were, you know, Jewish, and able\nto train to fight and obviously eventually go to an area where, you know, Jews were so\npersecuted?",
        "Q: So speaking of your other identity, what was that like to assume a different identity?",
        "Q: How difficult was that for you?",
        "Q: Did that influence you at the time, too?",
        "Q: Now, while you were in the commando, did you still, in your own personal and private way,\nwas religion important to you as -- as you went through those war time experiences?",

I\u2019m also interested, especially when you were able to get Germans to\nsurrender, were you able to learn important information from them along the way?",
        "Q: Now let me ask you, the Germans you encountered along the way, did any of them question\nyou and th -- and even, you know, wonder if you\u2019re Jewish, and -- did you -- that ever come up,\nwas that ever a problem?",

        "Q: When was this?",
        "Q: So, first of all tell me a little bit about the journey to get there. Was it a -- a difficult journey,\nwhat -- what was it like, and what did you see along the way?",
        "Q: Was it a very emotional time for you as well?",

        "Answer: Okay, my name is Manfred Gans. I was born in a little town in West Germany near the\nDutch frontier, the name of that town 1s Borken, it\u2019s -- at the time it used to be called Borken in\nWestfarn -- in Westphalia. And I was born in there on the 27\" of April, 1922. My father\u2019s family\nhad lived in that town at least since 1610. The town records showed that his -- the fa -- his -- his\nmother\u2019s family, by the name of Windmiller, were allowed to live inside the walled city of that\ntown in 1610, which was very exceptional, because Jews generally were not allowed within\nwalled ci -- cities.",
        "A: No, I can -- can\u2019t remember why, exactly what the reason was why -- but -- why they were\nallowed to live there. But basically Jews had lived in that area, or in that town since sometime --\nsomething like 1246. The exact history of the Jewish community has been reworked now, and is\nfully available in the -- in a group that has been formed in -- since 1988 in that town, who -- a\nsmall group of people who have occupied themselves with the history of the Jews. And they\nhave fabulous documents about everything. So if you have to clear up something, this 1s where\nyou can go, and anybody who wants to research the subject should go to these -- to these people.",
        "A: There were -- about 25 Jewish families lived in the town itself. And there were Jewish\nfamilies in every -- all the little villages around it. The town was a -- you know, was the county\nseat, and the -- all these other Jew -- little Jewish communities in the villages, some of them had\ntheir own synagogues, but none of them had schools. And -- so everybody had to come to -- to p\n-- all the Jewish children had to come to Borken for the Jewish schools. We -- oh, I had one towa\n-- want to mention one more thing which I -- this third thing is very important. So the Jews in a --\n1-in effect, had lived in this town for 750 years. And though it was a free town, that means it was\n-- it was -- it had -- it was an independent town, which could make its own decisions, my father\nwas the only Jew who was ever elected into the town council. There have been no Jews before\nthat, and no Jews, of course, since that -- since itch -- there are no Jews living in the town now.\nEverybody emigrated, or perished in the Holocaust.",
        "A: Okay. My father\u2019s name was Maurice Gans. He was born in 1885, and he went to -- like a --\nall the Jewish kids in na -- in -- in the town, he went into the Jewish school for the first four years\nof his schooling, which we can suppo -- suppose we can calculate when that was. And then, at\nthe age of 10, he went into the high school, which actually was a larger, Catholic school. And he\ngraduated from there at the age of, I think about 16. He did -- he did not finish up as a full\nmatriculation because there -- there was certain stages. And from there on s -- from then he -- he\nwent into the textile trade, and he was an apprentice in a wholesale textile ware -- company in\nFrankfurt, 1-1-in -- in Germany. He -- when World War One broke out, he was a -- drafted into\nthe German army. He was in Italy, and his unit was continuously short of food, and supplies, and\nhe made it his business to go into the Italian towns and get provisions there. And coming back\nfrom one of those expeditions, a -- a -- he was shot at by his own people, who hadn\u2019t recognized\nhim, and as a result he lost a leg, and as a result of a big loss of blood, he lost a lung, and so he --\nhis whole like -- life from there on, he had only one leg, and one lung. He was extremely brave.\nHe was lucky that he was sent to a Jewish home for recuperation in Switzerland because of\nhaving lost the lung. Of course the -- you know what -- the --the -- the -- he was treated as if he\nhad tuberculosis, which he did not have, and there he got involved in founding a Jewish\nrecuperation home. I think it was called Itania, which was Orthodox and had kosher food and all\nthose -- those things. When he eventually returned to his hometown, he set up his own company,\nand my mother was his partner. Now, ma -- tell you a little bit about my mother, because she had\na totally different background.",
        "A: Yeah, he was -- I think he was elected to the town council only in -- either in 1930 -- 1930 or\n\u00b031. Then, of course when -- when the -- when the -- there were so many elections just before the\nHitler period, and he of -- he was the chairman of the social democ -- democratic party in town.\nWhen the social democratic party was reduced to only one representative in the town council, I --\nmy father decided that his non-Jewish social democratic -- what trying to say?",
        "A: A colleague -- colleague should stay, rather than he. And so that he was out of it. Now, how\ndid he get into this position that people voted for him? When he returned to the town, after\nWorld War One, and set up his own business, he also took a very active part in the league of war\norphans, widows. And -- I\u2019m trying to find a -- find a English wor -- when people who had been\ninjured in the war, there was a -- a -- a league like that, and he beca -- soon became the head of\nthat league. He had his staff work on all the applications which were necessary so that these war\norphans, war widows, and people who had -- war injured could apply to the various government\noffices for the support to which they were entitled. And he never charged anybody for all these\nservices, and therefore he became very, very popular. His staff was -- his office staff, which was\nconcerned, of course with wholesale textiles, was a-accustomed to service the members of the\nleague of war orphans, widows, and people who had been injured in the war. Oh, I also started to\ntell about my mother\u2019s family, right? My mother\u2019s family lived in a little town called Falksen,\nwhich was near Hannover. And my grandfather, Maurice Frankel, had come from somewhere in\nthe Brunswick area, Braunschweig at the time. He had set up his own business, and this is a\ntown, he was a total free thinker, didn\u2019t believe in organized religion at all. But -- and his wife,\nmy grandmother had the same attitude, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they were hiding the fact that\nthey were Jews, they were not at all hiding, but they just didn\u2019t believe in organized religion.\nTheir ideal were opera, and theater, German [indecipherable] you know, that sort of thing. In\nfact, one of the sisters of my grandfather was an actress in Hannover, and she was a paramour of\nthe king of Hannover. She was very good looking. Even I remember her, though vaguely. And of\ncourse, I\u2019ve seen pictures of her. So, it was totally different type of upbringing, but nevertheless\nmy mother also had to go to Hebrew school two or three times a week, in -- this was a town\ncalled Springer, which was a -- probably only about four or five miles away. There -- you know,\nin those days of course there were plenty of trains. They went to and fro by train all the time. So\nshe too had a smattering of Jewish education. And then when she finished elementary school, her\nparents sent her to a finishing school, to Belgium, a Jewish finishing school where essentially\nladies learned to be good housewife, and as a result my mother was an outstanding cook, very\nmuch oriented towards the French cuisine, which she had learned in -- in Belgium. For a short\nwhile, she actually worked, after the [indecipherable] she -- she was a -- a companion lady or\nwhatever you call this, in the house of Rosensweig, was a German philosopher, Jewish\nphilosopher who -- who -- usually his name is connected with Buber, who was in -- who was --\nwho was later on a professor in -- 1n Israel, at the [indecipherable] university. Of course, Franz\nRosensweig was at that time already very sick. He had contact -- contract-tacted syphilis while\nhe was in the German army in -- in Poland. And sa -- but he was an outstanding thinker, and ve-\nvery famous in his interpretation of general philosophy and Judaism.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Else Frankel. E -- E-l-s-e Frankel. Now --",
        "A: She was, I think, five years younger than my father, so she must have been what, 18 - 19, yes.\nwhich it had when we lived in it. At the time when my parents bought it, and it was not\ndeveloped around it, gradually they, you know, they planted trees and bushes, and things like\nthat. So we had two maids as servants, we had people looking after the vegetable gardens, and\nafter the flower gardens. And above all, my father had a chauffeur, since he couldn\u2019t drive\nhimself. He was always on the road for -- during the whole week. Usually he came back at night,\nsometimes he did not come back at night, but he usually came back at night and then went out\nagain in the morning, into the rural district, to sell the specialty textiles to people who make\ncustom clothing. So it -- it -- it -- 1 -- it wa-was certainly upper class. I think we had a higher\nstandard of living than anything I have achieved since then, or my brothers have achieved since\nthen. My older brother was called Karl, and he -- he was two years older than I. He\u2019s still alive\nnow, he lives in Israel. Now he\u2019s called Gashom Kadar. He\u2019s changed his name during wor --\nWorld War Two, when he was serving 1n a mixed Arab Jewish unit in the British army. And my\nyounger brother, his name was Tayol, and when he went -- went -- went to Israel in 1950 -- let\nme see, he went to Israel in 1952. He too changed his name from Gans to Kadar. I have to excuse\nmyself.",
        "A: Well the routine obviously was we go to school every day. Until the age of 10, we went to the\nJewish school, Jewish elementary school, where we learned both the secular subjects and the\nbasic parts of the Jewish service, including the translation of the five books of Moses and things\nlike that. So w-we had a systematic education in learning classical Hebrew. Then, at the age of\n10, since our parents were well enough to do to -- they could send us to high school, we shifted\nover to the high school. Now, th -- the routine at home was that we\u2019d all be in school until about\none o\u2019clock and then came home and had the -- the main meal of the day. In the afternoon we\nwere supposed to do our homework. Had some sort of other activities, we were essentially free.\nAnd the -- the -- yeah, the up -- of c-course it\u2019s -- is a -- home was essentially Orthodox. Not --\nwe wouldn\u2019t call this strictly Orthodox, call it like the modern Orthodox in the United States now\nhere. And Friday evenings we would go to the service. After the service there would be a very\nfestive meal. My -- my father would be home most of the time on s -- on Friday -- on the\nweekends. Saturday morning we would go to synagogue again. The synagogue would finish at\nabout half past 10, 11 o\u2019clock. We then would go home and have a very festive breakfast, and\nafter that we were obligated to go and visit our grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, who was living\nin town. And at that time she was beginning to be about 75 - 80 years old. And we had to visit\nher every Saturday. And after that we\u2019d go back to synagogue for the afternoon service, a --\nwhich was at about one o\u2019clock, and about two o\u2019clock was the main meal, and in the evening at\nthe end of the -- of the holiday, or Saturday, we would again go to synagogue and participated\nwhat\u2019s called the Havdalah service. So, it was a -- a life that revol-revolved largely around the\nJewish religion. On Sunday we had to go to Sunday school, which was strictly devoted to\nHebrew and Jewish history. The Jewish elementary school was a one room school with eight\ngrades in it. Of course, we who -- whose parents were well off and could afford to send us to the\nhigh school only stayed in it for four years. But there were people -- Jewish kids in the school\nwho -- whose parents could not afford to send them to high school, and who did all the eight\ngrades in the -- in the one room school, this was a one room school. Which was very interesting\nbecause it -- it almost was like self education. There was only one teacher, and h-he would attend\nto all -- to everybody, set tasks for everybody. But when he taught history, or when he taught\nsomething to somebody else, of course you could always listen in. And I think [indecipherable]\nthat was very, very good for our development. That\u2019s in my -- in my days, the name of that first\nteacher we had, his name was Gunsberg, and he became an outstanding person in the\n[indecipherable] s-service, or [indecipherable] organization in Israel, when he finally em-\nemigrated to Israel, some time before World War Two.",
        "A: We started high school at the age of te -- 10. Before the Hitler period, we mixed fairly freely.\nNot hundred percent te -- hundred percent freely, but fairly freely with everybody. And there was\nnot much of a distinction made between Jews and -- and non-Jews, and you could communicate\nvery easily with everybody else. In my case, of course, this only lasted for one year. And then in\n1933, when I was 11 years old, Hitler came to power. But in the case of my older brother, this\nstate of affairs had much -- lasted much longer. My cousin -- my oldest cousin, who was of -- the\noldest amongst all of us who was at that time, he must have been already about 16 or 17, he had\ngone through that whole school, and of course had been totally integrated into the class in which\nhe was. So th-tha -- there wa -- there was not much -- there was not much distinction made, but\nthere -- there -- there was -- always was a certain amount of anti-Semitism. And the really\nwealthy families in town, non-Jewish wealthy families did not mix with Jews, basically. So there\nwere certain --",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, oh yes. First of all, it was already 1932, the Nazi movement was already very\nactive, and certain -- let\u2019s say parents of certain -- of children have -- were already very active\nNazis. And they already came out with some objections to Jews. It didn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t very\nserious, and we didn\u2019t take it very serious, and we also had -- always had already answers to\neverything. We always fought back.",
        "A: Well, some of the [indecipherable] I remember somebody say to him -- said to me, you\nGoddamn Jew, you have a bend in your nose, you know, Jewish nose? And I said better -- I said\nit\u2019s much better than having a bird in your brain like you do. I said -- that\u2019s the German\nexpression for -- for being a nut, 1s to have, you know -- so -- but it -- 1t more or less stopped\nthere.",
        "A: Well now, are you talking about f -- before Hitler, or after Hitler?",
        "A: Before Hitler, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think -- I personally had no encounters of physical\nharassment. Maybe it was just lucky, but I -- I don\u2019t think it was very common to have physical\nharassment before Hitler.",
        "A: The town had 8,000 in habitants, and as I said before, there were about 25 Jewish families in\nit. The relationships were, I think, pretty good. There were, of course, very Jewish businesses,\nand there were certain people who were anti-Semitic, who were just avoided. You just didn\u2019t\ncon-contact them. Of course, the -- the point of our town with 8,000 inhabitants is that everybody\nknows everybody. You couldn\u2019t hide. But by and large, I think it was a pretty peaceful life.",
        "A: Well, my father was the -- was very, very respected by -- by us. He was our greatest friend,\nand w-we three sons had a extremely good relationship with him when he was home.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: My mother, of course, had a hard job educating three sons, and no daughter. And she was --\ncould be quite volatile at times, and put on quite some scenes when we wouldn\u2019t go along with\nwhat she preached. And w-we could at times form a united front against her, and she would\ncomplain like hell to my father, who w-would get very upset about it, when he heard about it.\nBut -- and I don\u2019t want to underestimate the fact that, of course, my mother was in the afternoon\nin -- in my father\u2019s business, and we were somewhat educated by the maids we had in the house,\ntoo. We had two maids, as I said before, and we had other se-servants, and that had some sort --\nquite a bit of influence on us, too. Which I suppose is the usual experience of people who have\ngrown up in -- in we-wealthy homes where there were servants. My older brother was -- he was\nvery much the intellectual. He we -- he -- he was what you called a bookworm. And he -- he\nloved reading, and it came -- came -- c-came in very handy later on. I can go into the fine details\nafterwards. And my younger brother, he was outstandingly good looking. So -- and my mother\nalways said that I\u2019m -- I was her only s -- d-daughter. I had to learn all the practical skills. I had\nto do all the stuff in the kitchen, helping and so on, so forth. My -- my older brother was shielded\nfrom that -- he was quite awkward, too, that\u2019s because he was so bookish. My younger brother,\nof course, was spoiled like hell because he was so good looking, and so I had to have all the\npractical skills to -- to help everybody. So those -- those were the personalities, and they\nsomewhat remained that way all our lives, too.",
        "A: Well, of course it wasn\u2019t a -- it was not unexpected. There had been so many elections, and\nevery election Germany was going further and further to the right. More and more people were\nvoting for Hitler, or voting for the right wing parties, some of which were eventually merged into\nthe Nazi party. Another thing, another point I have to point out why all this was not so\nunexpected. When we visited my grandparents in Falksen near Hannover, they lived in -- ina\ntown that was largely Protestant. And that town was very radically in with the Nazi before Hitler.\nSo already in -- before Hitler, before 1933, when we went visiting there, there were a lot of kids\nwho didn\u2019t play with us because we were Jews. And they were already converted. So it\u2019s a -- a --\nth-they -- this is where the indic -- these were the indications of things changing. This a -- well, I\nnever forget the day Hitler came to power. We were having lunch, and we were listening to the\nradio, which was on because we listened to the one o\u2019clock news. And the newscast came out,\nand then suddenly the announcer said, \u201cAnd here is a little message, which has just fallen on my\ndesk, the president of Germany, Hindenburg, has appointed Adolf Hitler as the chancellor of --\nas the next chancellor of the German state.\u201d And I remember my mother was very, very shocked\nto hear this, and somehow we took it and said -- said well, that wa -- this was just one of the\nthings we had to face. The full implication of it, well I suppose we didn\u2019t ful -- fully realize -- at\nthe time the kids didn\u2019t, but my mother obviously did. My father was not home. I can\u2019t\nremember whether he came home that night. But soon -- he certainly came home very soon after.\nNow -- things changed in school now very -- I would say very rapidly. There -- some of the cra -\n- oO -- some of our classmates were keen to join the Hitler youth. There was no Hitler youth in our\ntown, and every time they had a demonstration, they had to call out the high school, which\nincluded us, for all their -- their demonstration, and whatever they were celebrating at the time.\nEventually my father got us out of there, we didn\u2019t have to attend those blasted ca -- wh-what --\nwhat do they call it? It\u2019s called in German [indecipherable]. Had the torchlight parades and all\nthat sort of things. We didn\u2019t have to go -- go along with that any more, but in the beginning we\ndid, because the school just said everybody come tonight, there\u2019Il be a torchlight parade to\ncelebrate this, that, and the other. And so we had to go.",
        "A: Oh yeah, definitely, we had absolutely no identity cris -- crisis. That, I think is the advantage\nof having grown up as a -- as an Orthodox Jew. My father\u2019s father had come from Holland to\nmarry my -- marry my grandmother. And he had grown up with the Sephardic Jews in Holland,\nthough he was not Sephardic himself. In fact they were from the part of Holland that borders on\nGermany. And -- but he -- he was -- he was very much aware of the Sephardic experience. And\nevery time the word Spain was used, he spit. I didn\u2019t know him personally any more. He -- he\ndied in 1917. He had a hernia [indecipherable] there was misop -- mis-operation, unfortunately.\nAnd -- but h -- so we were very, very much aware of the fact that expulsion, flight, and all that\nsort of things was part of the Jewish tradition. And there were two Jewish families living in\ntown, who had come from either Poland or Russia, and who had been exposed to this whole\nbusiness of pogroms, and -- and ma -- Jewish persecution in the east. So again, everybody was\nOrthodox, so just was part again -- was accepted as being part and parcel of one\u2019s history. We\nhad absolutely no identity crisis when all this came. People find that hard to believe, particularly\nI -- of course, later on in life, I came across a lot of Jews, who f -- German Jews, who were not\nbrought up Orthodox, who had all sorts of clashes, including the -- the people who -- when\nsomeone was in the army, and people [indecipherable] working professionally, and who had --\nwho -- who were -- whose -- had terrific identity crisis of -- of -- wh-when hi -- Hitler came to\npower, and when they were excluded from the social life which they had practiced up to that\ntime. But as I said -- of course, the other point was we couldn\u2019t socialize that well with other pe -\n- with non-Jews, even before Hitler, because we were kosher, and we couldn\u2019t eat in their homes.\nAnd so it was -- it would be very rare if any of them would come to our homes, and eat with us.\nAs one of my schoolmates told me back in -- in the 1988 -- 1992, when I went back to -- to the\nha -- we first went back to our hometown, this -- we -- homes were not that comfortable in those\ndays, and we all were friends because we played on the street. So the -- the intimacy that one\nnow can experience in being in each other\u2019s home, we had -- we did not have that in any case.",
        "A: Yeah. The -- of course the town was largely Catholic, and most of our classmates before\nHitler belon -- belonged to a Catholic youth movement. That was the standard thing to do, for\neverybody to belong to the Catholic youth movement. That of course we -- we were already\nautomatically excluded. We did not, at that time, have a Jewish youth movement to which we\nbelonged, but we did later on. Now, all these -- of course, now the pressure became very strong\non all these members of the Catholic youth movement to change over to the Hitler youth, and\nmost of them did, eventually. It took a little while for everybody to go along that line, but this is -\n- this is where they went, eventually. And our attitude to them was you are wrong and we are\nright. Well, it\u2019s a -- things came to a head on the first of April, 1933. Now, this was only what,\nthree months after Hitler came to power? He come to power on the 13\" of January, 1933. The --\nthey started this boycott movement against Jewish businesses. And it was a Saturday, and there\nwere storm troopers in front of every Jewish business to make sure that people wouldn\u2019t buy at --\nin Jewish shops. And w-we of course had to go to school on Saturday, we didn\u2019t write, we didn\u2019t\nca-carry our satchel because we were Orthodox, but we had to go to school and listen to the\nschool classes. And while we were in school, the -- one of the teachers -- of the most trusted\nteachers, [indecipherable] was trusted most, came and called us out, and he said -- he said to us, I\nremember there were four Jewish boys in my grade, \u201cLook, you know what\u2019s happening to you.\nI think it\u2019d be safer for you to go home now.\u201d So, when we went home, and well, you know, this\n-- this was the dramatic, the most dramatic change you can imagine. Course our parents were -- I\nwon\u2019t say shocked, but they were stunned. And my father wasn\u2019t going to take it. So he\nimmediately [indecipherable] the Shabbat was out, he got on the telephone to the headmaster of\nthe school, and he says, \u201cHey, what\u2019s happening? I\u2019m not going to send my children back to the\nschool if you can\u2019t guarantee their safety.\u201d I am convinced that that headmaster then had to\ncontact all the necessary party lines. I don\u2019t think there was a Gestapo in this town yet, at that\ntime. I was very much aware of the Gestapo when it finally came, because of course, they -- they\n-- later on, at the outbreak of World War Two, they took over our house as Gestapo headquarters.\nBut I\u2019m sure he -- he couldn\u2019t give my father a direct answer, he had to square this away with all\nthe authorities. Anyhow, by Monday morning he told my father that all the Jewish students could\ncome back to the high school, and they could guarantee their -- our safety.",
        "A: Not in the least. Not in the least for it. They were wrong, we were right.",
        "A: Yeah, I have to get my medicine.",
        "A: So that was April first, and the next lightning bolt struck on May first. Of course May first is\nalways celebrated in -- in Europe by all labor unions and people who have anything to do with\nlabor, you know, which the Nazis thought they were -- were too. This was a big celebration. And\nof course there again, we had to have a -- a parade, and again, since there was no Hitler youth, so\nwe -- we ha-had to collec -- come together again. There wasn\u2019t a big demonstration, but we\nsuddenly -- one of the teachers came out with a swastika emblem, which showed that he\u2019d been -\n- been a member of the Nazi party for quite awhile. I don\u2019t know whether it was true. There\u2019s a\nlong history attached to this character. He was a dis -- teacher of mathematics, bio -- and\nparticularly of biology, and he eventually was charged with teaching the signs of a racist, a\nsubject -- new subject, which the -- the Nazis had thought out. Anyhow, on May first it turned\nout, he -- he came out with a swastika emblem on his coat, which showed that he had been a long\ntime member of the Nazi party.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I have a long history with this man, who of course now, by now he\u2019s dead. But\nhe was an invalid. I can\u2019t remember from what any more, but he -- he -- he walked av -- one of\nhis legs wasn\u2019t functioning properly, so he was never called into the war, he stayed in the town\nthrough the whole war period, and as I said, I had quite a history with this character. Anyhow,\nnow m-my older brother, who decided that we should not communicate with our classmates any\nmore. We -- we shouldn\u2019t wait. He was -- my older brother was the sort of leader of the Jewish\nkids. My cousin, who as I said, who was about at that time was 16 - 17 years old. When he died\nlast year he -- in New York. He was -- he -- he wasn\u2019t in school any more, anyhow, so my older\nbrother became the leader of the Jewish children, and he decided that we\u2019re not going to wait\nuntil we\u2019re excluded, we\u2019re going to separate ourselves. So from that time on was -- we did not\ncommunicate with our schoolmates any more in -- in the -- in the a -- in the periods between\nlessons. Well -- we -- communication was absolutely at a -- at a minimum. You know, without\nany degree of intimacy between them and us. So, and this how I went to school for five years.\nMy older brother, who left in 1935, who -- which was three years later, and went to, at that time,\nPalestine, Israel. And so he was out, and so other Jewish children were taken out of school and\nsent abroad, or didn\u2019t continue high school. Emigrated and gone [indecipherable]. So eventually,\nby the time -- by the time I left, there -- there were only very few Jews -- Jewish children left in\nthe school, in the high school.",
        "A: Yeah, the Nuremberg laws as far as we were concerned meant that we couldn\u2019t have any non-\nJewish maids any more. We then managed to get some maids whose nationality -- we-were\nDutch by nationality, you know, it\u2019s in a -- in a fr-frontier area like that wasn\u2019t that difficult to\nfind. But that was the na -- the major effect it had -- had on us. I am not aware of any other of\nthese, you know, manifestation of the Nuremberg laws.",
        "A: My father reduced his business considerably, and he started -- he -- he concentrated all his\nefforts on getting cash out of Germany. And he set up a new business which sold vacuum\ncleaners, and irons, and you know, for -- for pressing clothing, things of that nature, because he\nsaw a chance to do business of that nature, to get a lot of his money out of Germany, which of\ncourse, was illegal. There were schemes of that nature. I know my uncles had had schemes of\nthat nature. My father\u2019s brothers who were -- all of them were doing very well financially. And -\n- and including my father\u2019s best friend, who became my father-in-law later on, he too had a\nscheme of this nature, and this is how people who had money managed to get some of their\npossessions out of the country, some of their cash out of the country. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a complicated\nway of doing it. Might be interesting to investigate it some time, but I think it goes too far to talk\nabout it in great detail here.",
        "A: Yeah, to -- largely to Holland. And he -- he went to Holland very frequently. He had a cousin\nin Winterswijk who cooperated with him. And I don\u2019t know all the details about it -- it -- but\nthere -- there always was some money available for us. He bought a house in -- in Israel in the\nearly stage, when he -- he went on a trip to Israel, I think in -- first time in 1936, or 1937, and\nyou know my -- of course my older brother was there, and he obviously had to pay for the\nschool, my brother went to Ben Shemen together with all the -- a lot of the famous leaders of --\no-of -- a lot of the men who became the famous leaders later on in Israel.",
        "A: Including -- in -- and amongst these -- his classmates were people like Rabin and Dayan. So\nhe -- so, as I said, money was available from -- for him to attend these schools.",
        "A: Interesting question. Was a -- what were we -- what were we talking about? Well, I don\u2019t\nthink the subjects changed that dr-drastically. My parents were still very much interested in\nliterature, talking about s-sub -- subjects of culture. And they -- they did occasionally discuss\nwhat we should and should not do, and what we should and should not say in public. And -- and\nif you had to be cautious and all that. At a very early stage of 1933, of course they came and --\nthe police and the storm troopers came into our house, and they went through my father\u2019s library,\nbut they weren\u2019t -- weren\u2019t enough educated to even find the books that -- that were of dubious\nbackground. So my mother, too, had no -- absolutely no fear of these people. So I call them a\nbunch of drunkards who -- who belong to a club of dr-dr-drunkards, meaning the storm troopers.\nAnd I\u2019m sure they -- my parents are not afraid of them and nothing close to -- very radically\nhappened. But my father was in the -- interesting point, my father was in the town council. He\nhad advocated that the high school for girls, which only had 50 students in it, should be\ncombined with the high school of boys. Now, of course, in a Catholic town that was out of the\nquestion. My father had always based this on the huge expense the 50 student school was for the\ntown to support, and they said there should -- there should be a combination of that. Well would\nyou believe that within two months after the Nazis came to power, they combined the two\nschools? My father was away, I think in Hannover at the time, and my mother -- I remember my\nmother telling him on the telephone that this has happened, but of course she didn\u2019t say it direct\nbecause the telephones were probably listened to. But she said -- she used some Jewish\nexpression to -- to make him aware of that this was -- was happening. Finally his scheme was\nbeing translated into reality. So from one day to the other we had girls in the class.",
        "A: It was largely the same as before, except that [indecipherable] we cou -- we couldn\u2019t show our\nfaces any more at sports events, you know? You know, these sort of sports events that are\norganized, what shall we say, by kids themselves. There was a certain amount of exclusion there,\nand that it got worse. But there were -- there were classes to teach aircraft design in the\nafternoon, which I participated in and I\u2019m sure we were allowed to participate in. So it\u2019s -- 1-1t\ndidn\u2019t change too drastically, except now, the other thing was of course that now we had a\ndifferent teacher, who was very, very keen to -- to st -- to teach much about -- we had a different\nteacher -- teacher of the Jewish elementary school, and he was very, very keen that we should go\ninto much -- to greater depths in -- in Hebrew. And eventually we went to Hebrew classes. Now,\nI\u2019m talking about modern Hebrew speaking classes, every -- every day, except Friday. Every\nafternoon we had Hebrew classes. So that -- that was a radical change. And of course it did us a\nlot of good, and -- because go -- got us much into greater depths into Hebrew. This teacher, who\nalso later on was -- became the headmaster of the Mizrachi high school in Tel Aviv, he started\nthe -- also the [indecipherable] movement to which we then belonged, and so then it was sort of a\nlittle bit of a organization which was -- through which we met other Jewish kids from other\ntowns occasionally, and so we were -- became the members of the Mizrachi. Now it\u2019s a national\nreligious party, but it wasn\u2019t as radical as that in those days. The youth movement, and we were\npart of that.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, it was a Zionist -- Zionist group. That must have started round about 1934 or\nso, because my older brother was still in town when we started it, and he became one of the\nmotivators of it. And as I said before, he left in 35, I think, to go to Israel. So that -- that was\nanother connection which we had --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: My mother\u2019s sister had gone to the Jewish agricultural school near Hannover, as -- when she\nhad finished elementary school. And there she met the man whom she eventually married, Alex\nMo. And who was one of the teachers in the school. And both my uncle, Alex Mo, and my aunt,\nspend all their lives until they emigrated from Germany, being in charge of agricultural training\nschools for Jews. Now, in 1932, I think it was, I spent a summer in the school which they ran at\nthe time, which was near Berlin, it was called Gutwinkle, and we somewhat participated a little\nbit in the work they did, and ma -- we were rewarded for it. But then, in 1933, they took over a\nvery large, what we called a hashavah camp, a cultural training camp for Jews who were\nchanging professionally to agriculture. [indecipherable]. And I spent almost every summer there,\nuntil I left Germany. And this of course, 1t was a fantastic influence on all our lives. We -- we\nloved the ti -- to go there. Since my uncle was in charge, we had, of course, a lot of privileges.\nOne of them was that we did a lot of horseback riding, and s-systematically learned horseback\nriding from one -- one of the teachers who was there, non-Jewish, who had been in the German\narmy cavalry. My uncle himself, who rode around all the time, supervised the work that was\nbeing done in the fields by these trainees, who were changing from all sorts of profession over\ninto agriculture. And to a child this was an absolutely 1 -- ideal way of -- of living. We -- I have\ninterest stories of the -- of the life we led there, and it was a -- a [indecipherable] connected with\nthe work and play, and it was a terrific experience. And I had -- it\u2019s of -- very much set the\natmosphere, both for my brothers and for myself, as to wh-where we wanted to go\nprofessionally, eve-eventually. Some --",
        "A: Well, my uncle thought well, of -- you know, he -- he put -- put us into whatever we wanted\nto do, and was -- wherever we could be used. We -- in the morning we always worked, and he\nsoon found out that I was very, very handy, so he assigned me to the repair shop which they had\nthere. And that sort of set me on my -- on my aim to become an engineer for repairing -- for\nagricultural machinery. I played around already at that time a little bit with the idea of becoming\na chemical engineer, but it was -- there was -- everybody said you can\u2019t do that without doing it\nfull time. And I always felt that I would never have the money to go to a full time university. So,\nthere -- that was, of course, my idea, and I\u2019ve already mentioned, my older brother went to an\neke -- went to Israel, went to Ben Shemen, which was the agricultural school in -- in Israel. So\nthat set his life, too. And my younger brother, he -- when he finished school in -- in England,\neventually he also took up -- there was a -- a job in -- in agriculture, and stayed in that field all\nhis life. He later on became a specialist of fertilizers and things of that nature. So all our\ndirections were set by this agricultural experience, which we had in the training schools run by\nour uncle and a-aunt.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, Bar Mitzvah to us was not a big deal really, because we knew so much Hebrew, and\nlearned so much. And my older brother was Bar Mitzvahed in 1933, yeah \u201933, that\u2019s right. And\nat the time -- at the time my -- my mother\u2019s father had just died. So my parents didn\u2019t -- for that\nreason, and also because the Hitler business, did not want to make a huge Bar Mitzvah for him.\nBut, you know, he had a f -- it was a very nice Bar Mitzvah and all that sort of thing. Very\nluxurious, but it was kept relatively small. You know, we had a huge family because my -- my\ngrandmother had five boys and five girls. And we al -- and they all married, and they all had\nkids, you know, so th -- wa -- it was somewh -- somewhat resented by all these relatives that they\n-- they weren\u2019t -- the invitations were relatively kept to a small [indecipherable]. Now, by the\ntime I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1930 -- it\u2019s 22 and 13 is 35, right? Yes, that\u2019s right. \u201933 to thir --\nyeah, \u201935. By the time I was Bar Mitzvahed in 1935, w -- we had a really huge Bar Mitzvah, with\nall the trimmings on it, and of course people coming to our town, they had to be fed three times\non as -- Saturday, you know? On Friday nights, on Saturday morning, and s -- then somehow\nagain something -- something again in the afternoon. We were expected to do the whole Torah\nreading for that day, of sh -- was no -- no difficulty to me at all. And we were expected to do the\nwhole reading from the prophets, the Haftorah readings for the day. Again, no -- no -- no\nparticular -- wa -- and we were expected to make a speech. And I made a f -- apparently made a\nspeech which upset my parents very much, because I -- politically it was unwise.",
        "A: Well, yeah, I think I started off by saying we are being accused of -- of such and such, and\nsuch and such things now, and I\u2019Il teach you that this is totally against our laws, and that we\ncouldn\u2019t be like this. And so it\u2019s a so -- so anyhow --",
        "A: Yes, yes. But you know, the speech was made at home, not in the synagogue. And the\nservants of course that were around, were non-Jews, who served the meals, so -- I don\u2019t think\nthat my parents had e -- invited any non-Jews -- non-Jewish friends to any of these occasions.",
        "A: Oh, I would say Pesach, Passover. Best food. You know, cause of my mother, being such a\nfabulous cook, all these things were -- were -- were on a -- on a Scale that wer -- was gour -- real\ngourmet eating. I mean, even the -- you know, that we -- we of course did not eat meat on the\nnine days before Tisha B\u2019 Av. But it was wonderful, the stuff my mother cooked was just out of\nthis world. No meat in it, and this being summer, you know, you have all the fruits you want.\nAnd she made the most fantastic fruit soups, and vegetable soups tha -- vegetable dishes,\nanything you could think of. And this way it was no hardship at all. The only hardship was that\nwe also couldn\u2019t go swimming in those -- in those nine days. And in the summer, you know\u201d? So\nwe were waiting for Tisha B\u2019 Av to be gon -- be gone so we could go back to the s -- to the swim\nbaths, you know, go swimming.",
        "A: Yeah, actually it\u2019s a -- the -- the -- the pool was not forbidden to us, except for certain times.\nThey had to, you know, there was sort of a mixture between Catholic and Nazi. They had periods\n[indecipherable] was women only, and -- where women were allowed. Those periods we did not\n-- we were not allowed to go into the swimming pool, the town swimming pool. But then they\nalso had periods when the -- the pool was open to men only, and those periods -- in those periods\nwe could still sneak in and take a swim. So we had to be carefully attuned to what could and\nwhat could not be done.",
        "A: Yeah, not -- not -- not -- not complete exclusion. The exclusion was only for the periods when\nwomen were allowed, or mixed swimming was allowed. So we managed to ge -- to gets -- to\nsneak in still.",
        "A: They -- the -- the -- you know, there was only one movie house in town, and that put up a sign\nfairly soon saying we don\u2019t want any Jews, Juden [indecipherable]. And when that sign went up,\nmy parents would not allow us to go in any more because this is -- you know, that -- that was\nthat.",
        "A: We decided that -- not to go, yeah. I think if you could have sneaked in, nobody would have\nobjected very much.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Violent, too. I mean, it started to get dangerous to -- to walk in the -- 1 -- you know,\nin the very beautiful woods around that town. You know, on Saturday afternoon we would go for\na walk, and sha -- would want to play, and there were certain guys who -- who it was dangerous\nto meet. And they were beating us up and God knows what. That\u2019s -- we had to be very, very\ncareful.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes, yes. Once a guy hit me in the face with a burning rubber -- rubber what do\nyou call it, a rubber stick, and I, you know, I had an injury from it for quite awhile. And there\nwas another, you know, usually it was just beating up, or stones being thrown, and things of that\nnature. You just had -- had to be very, very careful. And you just -- nothing you could do. You\nhad to recognize that there was superior force on the other side. You don\u2019t stand and fight\nsuperior force. You just have to flee from it, go into an area where gro -- you have enough\ngrown-ups who would interfere with what these kids were doing.",
        "A: Actually, my parents wanted to get me into a Jewish high school in Berlin in 1938. On -- on\none of the many trips to this farm, that training farm which my uncle and aunt -- aunt were in\ncharge of, I had to -- come to know two of these schools. They had to -- they had come to visit\nthe farm, and I was there. I got very, very friendly with some of the teachers, and some of the\nkids. And as a matter of fact I went to one of the schools, and well, for a day or two in Berlin,\nand listened in, and from -- and then my parents said in 1938, that I should leave the school in\nour hometown and go to one of those schools. And it was decided that since all these schools are\nvery far advanced in teaching English, I will need enough English to ca -- catch up with the other\nme-members of the school.",
        "A: We had been -- we had, apart from Hebrew, of course, which we did not learn in public\nschool, our education was Latin. We -- we -- ever since we were 10 years old, every day we\nlearned -- had at least one or two hours of Latin. Latin was the foundation of our -- of our\nknowledge. Now, I learned some English, I learned some French, but certainly not -- not to a\nvery high degree. Anyhow, my parents wanted to send me to England for the summer, and -- to\nlearn English, and then I -- I would come back to -- to -- to Germany. But while I was in\nEngland, my parents wrote saying that they have talked with other people, and they\u2019 ve come to\nthe conclusion that it\u2019s not wise for me to go back to Germany. And they said what would you do\nif we were tell you, you just stay where you are. So --",
        "A: Wonderful. I was free. I had -- I had made friends, again thr -- through my relatives with other\nf-family where the gentleman was very active in the Jewish agency, Adler Rudell. And I went to\nthem, and I told them that -- what my parents had written, and -- and what should I do? And we\ndecided that the thing to do was, since my means were limited, was to go to an intensive tutorial\ncollege, and try and do metric, you know, high school cer -- equivalent to a high school\ncertificate, in that fashion. And I -- I loved the idea to do this.",
        "A: Yeah. This was 1938, so I was 16 years old, and -- I liked the idea of trying to make it in\nabout four or five months, to try and get -- get a equivalent of a high school certificate, and then\ngo and start working. Since I knew exactly what I wanted to do, I would get myself a job, and I\nwould go on and learning in -- in evening classes. I didn\u2019t have any doubts as to what to do, and I\nlike -- as I said, I like the idea to be on my own. Now my parents did come over occasionally, my\nfather or my mother, or both of them, during all this time when I first came to England, and --\nuntil the outbreak of the war. They -- on and off there, they were in England.",
        "A: It was very easy for me to leave, because we all had been living so close to the frontier, we all\nhad passes to cross the frontier. It took a long while to get a passport wh-which could take me\npast the frontier areas of Holland. But we -- we -- we all passports at the time. One more thing,\nalready at that age, I had learned to drive the car. My father wanted me to do that in case we\nsuddenly had to get out in the middle of the night. So by the age of 16, and of course t-totally\nillegal, I knew how to drive a car already. And I -- I left home on a Friday afternoon, Friday\nmorning, I crossed the frontier, went to my c -- my father took me to his cousin, I stayed there\nfor the weekend, and on Sunday I traveled on to Hoek van Holland, took the night boat over to\nEngland, and arrangements had been made by my parents for me to live temporarily with a\nfamily, a very nice family in -- in London.",
        "A: Yes, yes, in my mi -- we came to the con -- conclusion that things were really getting worse\nand worse, and that it wasn\u2019t worthwhile to take the risk of sticking around. So -- and since I was\nout of the country anyhow, my parents felt that I should stay out, because as I said before, my\nolder brother had been in -- in -- in Israel since 1935, so it wa -- it wasn\u2019t such a big sh -- idea for\nme to get out, too.",
        "A: Yes. My father somehow just couldn\u2019t make -- give himself the push to cut off everything. He\nsaw more and more chances to get at least some of his money out, and he was going to stick it\nout to the -- to the end and get the maximum amount, you know, of course that probably was the\nwrong decision to make. My younger brother also stayed at home. My parents were rather\nreluctant to let him go because he was not independent yet, and so he stayed until after\nKristallnacht.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a -- you know, this became wu -- practically headline news in the British papers,\nwhen this Kristallnacht happened, and some of the papers tried to say that this was spontaneous,\nyou know, and other papers, like the new scr -- new [indecipherable] liberal paper, they said no,\nthis is organized. I discussed -- discussed it with my friends, the Adler Rudell, and he said, \u201cNo,\nthis was organized by the state, there was nothing spontaneous about that.\u201d This was an assertion\nof power, a first sign, and if you had no doubts about it, where all this was going to -- to -- to\nlead. The fact that so many people had been put into prison, some in concentration camp, and so\non, so forth, I mean I don\u2019t think that anybody, at least I didn\u2019t have any doubts this was the\nbeginning of an absolute disaster. So --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think I was worried about my parents because I knew that they could always get\nout when they wanted to get out, and this is what they intended to do. And -- and that they had\nenough means to -- to -- to get out when they wanted to do. So from -- personally we didn\u2019t -- I\ndidn\u2019t feel this was a -- was to -- go -- going to be so critical. But you know, the [indecipherable]\nthe stateless Jews [indecipherable] family in our town, people who had come from Poland, and\nnever -- never become citizens, and you know, they were picked up, and shipped away, and put\nat the border of Poland and -- and -- and Germany. That time we were very much aware of what\nwas happening to them. You should -- you know, the Poles didn\u2019t want to let them in, and the\nGermans wouldn\u2019t have them. And, you know, these were families whom we knew.\n[indecipherable] 35 families in a town, of course you know everybody.",
        "A: Absolutely. Already when I left Germany I knew I would never -- never return. And I was -- I\n-- I was convinced that this German experiment would last for ages and ages and we would never\nbe allowed to return. I never mentioned that this was all going to be over and done with in -- in\nwhat was it? ?38? Fa -- \u201945? That\u2019s seven years, right? We got back to Germany in \u201945. It\u2019s\nincredible. It\u2019s incredible, except that it didn\u2019t seem so incredible after Munich, you know. After\nMunich we knew that war was coming, and -- and that Hitler would go too far. So -- but befo --\nbut when I left, I thought I will never see the place again.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I did, you know. I -- after all, we had traveled a lot in Germany, we had been in\nvarious children\u2019s camps, things of that nature, and I -- I -- I loved the beautiful landscapes, the\nbeautiful woods and all. [indecipherable] very much trave -- traveled along the Rhine. Was a\nbeautiful area, by -- into -- by train, and so we were very much aware of what the place looked\nlike, and definitely had -- definitely had a certain attachment to it. Felt very bad about never\nbeing able to see it again.\nwithin one or two blocks of the [indecipherable] synagogue, which was a big synagogue, and\nthat\u2019s where Mr. Jacobs belonged. And -- and I concentrated on learning English, very much\nhelped by Mrs. Jacobs, who had no hesitation to correct me, telling me what to do. And ever\nsince I love reading newspapers, and the Jacobs, since they were liberals, you know, with a\n[indecipherable], course the newspaper was a news chronicle, and I u-used to translate\nnewspaper articles and then learn them by heart, and this is how I si -- taught myself English, to\na large extent, very much helped, as I said, by Mrs. Jacobs, as I was there. Was a wonderful time\nI had there. Was a little bit expensive, and so I couldn\u2019t stay there any length of time, but while it\nlasted it was -- was very nice.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Well, one incident that actually I think is worthwhile recording is one day Mr. Jacobs went to\nthe library, and he said, \u201cDo you want anything from the library?\u201d And I said \u201cYes, get me\n\u201cMein Kampf,\u201d Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d in German.\u201d Of course, while I was in Germany, I would\nnever do them the honor of reading this, but I felt I had to read it, and I\u2019m very, very grateful that\nI did read it at the time when I -- whe -- because it made it so clear, totally clear as to what was\ngoing to happen, from reading that book. And this -- all this -- the propaganda methods, the way\nto achieve their aim. This business of expanding Germany into the eastern [indecipherable] and\nsh -- chasing all Slavic nations behind the euro -- and all this was all -- the all -- all set out there,\nyou know? It -- 1-1t was shus -- it was oka -- I don\u2019t know why I did it, but I did read \u201cMein\nKampf\u2019 in German while I was there. Then occasionally we went to the movies, Mr. Jacobs took\nme to the movies, which was, of course, in English. And that -- that was a good experience too.\nAnd generally ha-have a wonderful time. Eventually, when my parents say cha -- that I should\nstay, I realized I couldn\u2019t stay with the Jacobs because it was far too expensive, and I had to go\nand look for cheaper accommodation. An -- but -- but of course, by that time my English had\nimproved a lot, too. I had made up my mind to go to the tutorial college in Euston -- it -- 1s it\nEuston? It is near -- I know it\u2019s near Bushhaus in -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s Euston, which is spelled E-u-s-t-o-\nn. And so I made the arrangements to find a new home, or new digs with se -- with those factors\nin mind of having to go to -- to the tutorial college every day, a-and obviously I still wanted to be\nnear a synagogue and all that, and I had to live kosher. So that\u2019s -- determined where I settled.",
        "A: Well, the signs were the demands which Germany made on Czechoslovakia. There was the\ngathering of the party -- I can\u2019t remember any more where it was, where they -- where they\ncelebrated the presence of the S-Sudeten German people, and their demands for incorporating the\nSudeten area into Germany became very, very loud and forceful, and it was quite obvious what\nthey wanted to do. They wanted to annex the Sudetenland. And this led to the Munich gathering,\nwhich -- in which France and Germany agreed -- France and England agreed that Hitler could go\ninto -- could annex the Sudetenland without France and England going to war. Well, of course,\nHitler signs a piece of paper saying that this would be his last demand, and it will be peace in our\ntime. That\u2019s the famous peace in our time. And Chamberlain came home to England, he says\npeace in our time, the memo in his hand, and I remember next Saturday, next Shabbat in\nsynagogue -- I still went to the [indecipherable] synagogue, Mr. Jacob saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like this\nwhole thing.\u201d And of course, there was the famous speech by Churchill in Parliament, where he\ntold Chamberlain y- you had to -- you had to choose between dishonor and war, you chose\ndishonor, that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to have war.",
        "A: No, no, it\u2019s a -- you know, it no -- it became -- it -- it just said it was all inevitable. This 1s all -\n- what\u2019s going to happen and so there was nothing we could do about it, and we just had to fit\nourselves into this -- into this -- into this situation. Before the Munich agreement, a lot of people\nhad left London, including my landlady and her daughters, [indecipherable] and I was sort of\nasked to look after myself, which I didn\u2019t mind at all. And they -- they returned after the Munich\nagreement had been signed, and it was pretty sure that a war would not break out immediately.\nPeople we -- were divided. They ca -- people who were conservatives, conservative Jews, I\nmean, you know, this conservative party of England. There were a lot of those in a rich\ncommunity like Goldaskreen, and they took the attitude Chamberlain did the right thing. We\nhave not got the means to go to war at the moment. He s -- fo-fought for time. The people who\nwere liberal like Mr. Jacobs said it was a dishonor which we shouldn\u2019t have gone in for. And the\npeople who were lesstich labor, they -- they had been such you Jews, they had been such\npacifists, that they -- they -- they wouldn\u2019t hear about -- about any requirements such as having a\ndraft and mobilizing, and any of those things. They -- they couldn\u2019t get used to this idea\n[indecipherable]. And, as I said, I was very much influenced by the views of people like Mr.\nJacobs, who were liberals, who -- who thought this was a --a dishonor. So we\u2019ve faced reality, as\nbest as we could. And -- and of course the pressure on -- on the German Jews which -- other\nJews became larger, until more and more refugees coming into England, and a lot of -- and the\ndifficulty of getting jobs for people, and getting a way of finding money to live on became larger\nand larger, but the British Jewish community was a [indecipherable] and an extremely well\norganized, largely by volunteers. They had money available, and they -- I think they, in my\nopinion they took care of this refugee program in an excellent -- in a wonderful way, in spite of\nthe fact of course, obviously everybody finished up living at a standard of living which was far,\nfar below the sort of standard of living they had experienced in -- in Germany.",
        "A: Well, you know, the point was that I had enough money to live on. All I had to look after was\nt -- to do, was to work and work and work and try and get this high school simetric in four\nmonths, which I didn\u2019t succeed to do eventually, but nevertheless, that effort [indecipherable]\nwas the only thing I -- I was going for. It\u2019s -- I -- I did not have to share in a lot of the hardships\nwhich other people were exposed to, because after all, my father could send me some money --\ncarefully, you know, didn\u2019t squander it in any way, lived very simple. But it gave me certain\npride to -- to live in a frugal way. And as I said, my aim was to -- was concentrated on qualifying\nfor the high school certificate.",
        "A: All right. After I finish the tutorial college, and have not passed the examination, I -- I passed\neverything except the English, I just wasn\u2019t good enough. But I -- I decided I was not going to go\nback to school full time. And I registered as the [indecipherable] I -- I went into the German\nJewish aid committee, and saw what went on there for a whole day. And in the evening, one of\nthe ladies, she was from the Shief fam -- family -- you know, these were all volunteers, people\nwho did this. She had -- obviously has a tough day, and she says, \u201cWould you like to go to\nManchester?\u201d I said, yes, I\u2019ll go. I thought it was very important that we -- we refugees would\nnot all congregate in London, and so -- so I -- together with a few other people, a few days later,\nI went to Manchester, and again, there was a organized German Jewish aid committee, first liv --\nfirst lived in a -- in -- what do you call -- would you call it, I don\u2019t know. Some sort of communal\nhouse, which again it was, you know, had to be kosher, and -- and it was very nicely organized,\nand all that, and of course we had to work and keep it clean and all that. And the c-committee\nwent out and to tr-try to find us jobs. And -- and through them, eventually, I got a -- a job which\n-- which I liked very much. In fact, this was the first non-Jewish offer which the committee had\nhad for jobs. And I wanted to go into machinery repair, and it turns out that this, we -- this part of\nthis -- this plant was not -- the repair shop was not unionized, so I could go -- go -- go into that,\nand fit myself into that. And it turned out to be an extremely good experience. It\u2019s an interesting\nstory, you can tell it in great details. Again, I had to make it clear that I wouldn\u2019t work on\nSaturday, I wouldn\u2019t work on Friday afternoons, or would go home early on Friday afternoons.\nBut they -- they didn\u2019t mind at all, they said, \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get paid. If you\nclock in and you clock out, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Initially the German Jewish aid committee subsidized\nmy -- my salary a little bit, and after I found -- I had started working in this job, they told me in\nthe home where we were, that I should go to a certain place, to a certain address where I would\nbe able to make arrangements to finding a place -- permanent place to live, a lodging to -- to live.\nI went to this place, I had hardly changed from my work clothes, and I went to the right address,\nand to my great surprise I was in -- at a beautiful estate, very rich, obviously very rich people. I\ndidn\u2019t know what it was all about, but I was hope [indecipherable] the right address. It turned out\nthat my friend Mr. Jacobs had made arrangements for this very well-to-do family to go and be\nintroduced to me. These were the Steinats. They were, you know, the Laskeys, the famous\nLaskeys were the richest family in Manchester, Jewish family in Manchester. And the Steinats\nwere the second richest families. And they were -- s-started my relationship with that -- that\nfamily. The brother of Mrs. Steinats had also been an officer in the Jewish brigade in World War\nOne, and that -- so the connection between Mrs. Jacobs and the Steinats. So you see it\u2019s just all --\nall a question of connection with -- and it was very important in England, everything 1s c-\nconnection. It\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s whom you know. And the Steinats made arrangements\nfor me to be billeted, to -- to -- to rent a room from a lady who had been the second driver of Mr.\nSteinats father. Mr. Steinats hated her like the guts. He didn\u2019t like her at all. But it came in handy\nfor me to -- to live there, and I lived there with another German Jewish man, who was two years\nolder than I, and -- and there was a very old man also living there as a lodger. Now, this lady\nrented rooms, and she provided meals. It was pretty primitive, but all right, I -- I didn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] I d -- the -- the job which I had accepted, w-w-was technically very good, but it\nagain, the circumstances of -- of cleanliness, and toilet facilities were just d-disgusting. But I th -\n- | thought this 1s part of living like this, and I was living on the -- during the week I was living in\nthe poverty of a working class atmosphere, and on weekends I was going to the Steinats for\npractically all my meals, and living in a very, very high class atmosphere. Undoubtedly the\nSteinats were richer even than my father was. And I -- I thought it was greater -- a great\nexperience. So I -- I think I have to take another trip to the toilet.",
        "A: Well, just let me tell you about one more item that was also very significant in my life. It --\nfirst of all, as you may remember or may know, I think it was in February, 1939, Hitler marched\nand took over the rest of Czechoslovakia. Of course, everybody thought the war was going to\nbreak out immediately then, but I -- I was sure it wouldn\u2019t. Because now the attitude of France\nand England changed, and they started sending their foreign ministers to Moscow to try and get a\ner-great alliance with the Russians going. And of course that was their big hope, that they\neventually would pull that off, and pull it off together. And -- and all the workers in -- in the\nfactory where I worked said we\u2019ll be in war -- at war in a week or so, and I say, no you won\u2019t be.\nThey going to try this, and they\u2019re going to be -- do their best effort to -- to pull a -- make alli -- a\nmajor alliance with the Russians. And this is very much what happened. So nothing much\nhappened politically, every -- except that everybody was sure that eventually there would be a\nwar. But the -- these two elephants were not in -- on the way yet. Then on Shavuot, 1939, I was\nat the Steinats again, and so I mentions that I had just -- had bu -- gotten a chief rabbi from\nManchester, Dr. Altman, who was, not to me, but to other people, a well known rabbi from\nBerlin. Quite young, he was in middle 30\u2019s, or -- at the time, and sa -- for the [indecipherable]\nafter the synagogue ceremony, th -- the Steinats had invited Dr. Altman and his wife, together\nwith a few other very prominent people of the Jewish community. The day was glorious, the\nweather was glorious, the food was incredible. Of course it had to be non-meat, being Shavuot,\nand this is where I came to know Dr. Altman, who later on became the head of the -- head of the\nInstitute of Advanced Jewish Studies at Brandeis University. And he -- we became friends right\nthere and then, and he is being -- he being -- he was my mentor, from whom I learned an awful\nlot, until the time he died in, I don\u2019t know, some times in the 80\u2019s. He was professor at Harvard,\nsame time professor at Jerusalem University. And but that\u2019s -- basically he was a fantastic\nthinker, with tremendous ideas, and I attended a lot of lectures which he gave, mostly in\nManchester, and then later on here, in this country. And he set me on a path of -- of studies, and\nviews that have sur -- very much influenced my life and gave me a much deeper understanding\nof Judaism than I could have possibly gotten in any other way. So that was sometime on May,\n1930 -- ?39. And then, actually on -- so then, in beginning of September, 1939, it suddenly\ntranspired that Germany had made a pact with the Soviet Union, or the Soviet Union had made a\npact with Germany that they were going to divide up Poland between the two of them. I don\u2019t\nknow whether we were a hundred percent aware of it, that they were going to divide up Poland at\nthat time, but you know, that\u2019s what it amounted -- amounted to. And now the road was clear for\nHitler to march into Poland, and -- which he did on September first, 1939. England declared war\non the following Sunday, this was -- September first was a Friday, and England declared war on\na -- on a Sunday night. And I happened to be at the Steinats at that time, listen -- listened to the\nspeech which Chamberlain made, over the radio, which he pointed out that I ca -- I -- I wish I\nhad the -- the exact text of this. I\u2019ve asked people to look it up, I think I want to look it up, it\u2019s\nvery worthwhile. He said these [indecipherable] evil things we\u2019ll be fighting against, bad faith,\nsomething something, and oppression, but I can\u2019t remember exactly any more. And against\nthese, I\u2019m sure the right will prevail. So --",
        "A: That\u2019s this here. So the -- the first thing -- the first thing we experienced at the time, was that\nwe all had to register, we German Jews, and we were, in a typical British fashion, put before a\ntribunal, which [indecipherable] each case individually, and people were classified into a categ --\nGerman -- you know, we were off -- t-to the British we were all German. There were -- category\nA went straight into interment camp, category B could go on living under certain circumstances,\nand category C were totally free, and being treated like British people. Of course with my\nconnections to the Steinats and all that, I had no difficulty in being assigned to c-category C. So\n1-it didn\u2019t affect me in the beginning, at all. The -- there now was a -- a c-call-up. Conscription\nwas enacted, people were called to the services, and obviously the country was getting on a war\nfut -- footing slowly. This was the period which we call the phony war because nothing\nhappened. There was a British expeditionary force sent into France but not into Belgium. And th-\nthey were very -- an-and the western front was extremely inactive, nothing happened there at all.\nHitler was occupied in the east, conquered Poland, and this was a -- and apparently things were\nvery quiet, but everybody realized this was a quiet before -- before the storm. I continued to\nwork in the same place I was, and in January ni -- 1940, I managed to pass the high school\ncertificate, which I had continued preparing -- prepared in pravin -- largely in private class,\nprivate pa -- private tuition, and not -- not even going to any classes at all. I had a pr -- civil pri --\ndifferent private teachers. I -- I had a very heavy German bicycle, which -- with which I run\naround all over the place, at all times of the days and nights. And somehow this way I -- I\nmanaged to -- to -- to survive. In -- now, you know, jobs became freely available. There was a\nshortage of workers everywhere, and after awhile I decided I wanted to go and do something\ncloser to what I -- my long term aim was, and I got myself a job in a factory that manufactured\nagricultural machinery. They -- actual -- in actual fact, the actu -- the experience was -- I felt was\nnot very good, and the agricultural machinery was very crude compared with what I had been\ndoing up to that time, and I didn\u2019t think I was learning too much from getting -- being exposed to\nthis machinery, and I have -- wuf -- had more or less made up my mind to give all this up, and go\ninto a different direction, for to -- to go into machine tools, which were th -- at the height of -- of\nwhat has -- one has to know as a mechanical engineer. But then of course, came the invasion of -\n- first of Norway and Denmark, and after that the invasion of the lowlands, and the attack on the\nwestern front, and now everything changed. Obviously with the -- the use of secret sympathizers,\nNazi sympathizers that suddenly rose up in Holland and in Belgium, in -- in less -- to a lesser\nextent in Denmark, but to a larger extent in Norway, now the British public became a -- very,\nvery concerned about people like ourselves. The first affected --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: So, after the invasion of the lowlands, and Hitler\u2019s victory in the west, and after the British\nexpeditionary force had been brought back to England via Dunkirk in the famous Dunkirk\nretreat, it -- our life was made a lot harder. As I said, I had to given -- I had to give up my\nbicycle. Luckily it was summer, so I could do everything by bus, and the days were long. But\nvery soon thereafter, we were interned -- put into an internment camp. The first internment camp\nI was in was near Manchester. It was an old disused factory, terribly filthy. It was in Bury, B-u-r-\ny, and there were about -- there must have something like two or 3,000 people in it. They ranged\nfrom German merchant sailors, so ver -- real Germans who had been taken prisoner on the high\nseas, to us, the ultra Orthodox Jew, or the Orthodox Jews. There was a whole big group of\nOrthodox people there, and we all stuck together. We of course didn\u2019t participate in the -- the\ngeneral food, we -- we did our own cooking, and looked after ourselves, which meant no meat,\nand of course there were no such things as eggs, so f-food was pretty short. I don\u2019t -- can\u2019t\nremember how long we were in this disused factory. We were lucky that the weather was perfect,\nfor England, and this was a beautiful summer, because I -- I -- thinking 1 -- in case of rain, I don\u2019t\nthink the roof would -- would have held up.",
        "A: Well, the police came around, you know, the police came around and said oh sorry, you ha --\nyou have to pack up and you have to go -- you\u2019Il be interned. The -- first they had come around\nbefore, and you know, told me to se-sell the bicycle, which I did, I sold it to a neighbor who --\nwho was a bicycle nut. He l-loved bicycles, and then they came around later on again, and said\nsorry, we have to intern you. So this was from one day to the other, pack up, and I --",
        "A: This must have been something like June, July, 19 -- 1940. Sis -- so we were in this place in\nBury, this -- this used factory, tried to make ourselves useful by working, it\u2019s one thing or the\nother. That was a lot of time to spend, but a lot of people had bor -- brought good books, and tis -\n- there were interesting discussions. As I said, I -- I think there must have been something like\n2,000 people in that camp. From there we were eventually shipped to a place near Shrewsbury,\nwhich was an internment camp which was all tents, so we lived in tents. Again, the Orthodox ] --\nJews kept together and had a very organized life. There were enough rabbis amongst that group\nto organize all this. And we kept to our -- ourselves, and everybody tr-tried to he -- help, and\nmake -- make a go of it. [indecipherable] I -- I did feel -- I became quite weak because of the\nlack of food. The one main instance I remember is that when the son-in-law of the famous chief\nrabbi of England, Dr. Hertz, whose -- you know, who has written that book [indecipherable]\nTorah -- underneath the green you'll find the -- that\u2019s the Hertz Bible. And he came around and\nhe -- he sort of assured us that they would see to it that the -- the food situation would improve.\nBut, of course, it couldn\u2019t be for a very long time in this tent camp, and I think some time in --\nprobably in September or so, maybe it was later, I can\u2019t remember exactly any more, every --\nthese -- we were all shipped over to the Isle of Mann, where they had fenced off whole districts\nof the town and some [indecipherable] were converted into -- into internment camps. Again,\nthere were houses with -- for Orthodox Jews, and we all kept to ourselves. But life was quite\norganized there. It was -- 1t was before Rosh Hashanah, because I remember, you know, the --\nthe houses were right on the seaside. For Rosh Hashanah, a lot of people went into the ocean for\nlike a -- you know, doing the cleaning, for a mikvah. So --",
        "A: 1940, yeah.",
        "A: There -- there was a women\u2019s camp somewhere. I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t know -- can\u2019t remember\nwhere it was any more, but there were only men, you know, in case -- there were only men in the\ninternment camp. The -- yeah, the -- as I said, the life was very -- start getting very organized,\nthere were a lot of classes. You could learn anything you wanted, people taught just about any\nsubject you could think about. And of course there were a lot of aus -- Austrians there. There\nwere very good lectures on psychology, and very intensive classes on -- on -- also Jewish\nsubjects. Mathematics classes. I remember I started learning mechanical drawing there, and there\nwere people who were teaching automobile design and things of that nature [indecipherable] was\nvery -- intellectually very, very active.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s right. All self organized. Well, I don\u2019t know when it was, I think it was\nOctober, November, they had the -- there was an announcement that the age of entry into the\narmy for enemy aliens, whi-which we were, had been lowered from 20 years to 18, I think. So, I\nhad actually tried to volunteer for the army before that, but because I -- I still saw that eventually\nwe wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid it, but I was too young. Then they lowered the age, and a few\nBritish Jewish officers came around, and organized meetings. Had a big meeting in -- in the\ninternment camp and told us to come and volunteer for the army. Well, I -- I volunteered. It was\nsomewhat resented by some people. A lot of people said that they will join if they were free men,\nbut they wouldn\u2019t join from internment camp, things of that nature. But I thought that was\nneither one way or the other, and that they eventually will have to go one way or the other\nanyhow, so might as well g-go and do it sooner than later. I d-definitely wanted to get out of\ninternment camp. And --",
        "A: No. Living conditions were pretty good, except again for this food business [indecipherable]\nthe living conditions were quite good. We -- we lived in houses. Of course, every room had --\nwas full of beds, you know, and there was one common room, a dining hall where everybody\ncollected for anything that\u2019s -- what wasn\u2019t sleeping. And -- and it -- it -- 1t was not -- it was not\na great hardship, no way.",
        "A: Well, maybe I did, but I -- you know, I -- I -- I felt a sympathy, with all the things you\u2019d read\nabout the -- the Quisling regimes, and the traitors that had been in Fr-France -- in -- in Holland,\nor Norway and Belgium, I -- somehow I -- I -- I sympathized with the British, that they had to do\nthis in order to make sure -- they couldn\u2019t j-justify -- before their own people they couldn\u2019t\njustify having us run around free in their country. So it -- it was more -- it was definitely done\nmore for morale and propaganda than for actually being afraid that things might -- sas -- there\nmight be spies amongst ourselves, and so on, so forth. So I -- I was willing to accept this affect,\nthat this w-was a necessary move that the government had to make. And then in -- I think it was\nbeginning of December 1940, it was my turn to -- to leave, and we -- I joined the Pioneer Corps,\nbut actually what was happening was we were -- we were ju -- went by boat and train from the\nIsle of Mann, first to Liverpool, and then to Ilfracombe, which is corn -- Cornwallis, or -- you\nknow, it\u2019s just -- just south -- in the far southwest of England. That was the headquarters for the\nPioneer Corps, the -- Pioneer co -- the alien man -- Pioneer Corps. The other members of the\nPioneer Corps were British s- soldiers, who had -- actually were very -- had come 1 -- were not --\nnot completely trusted because of legal difficulties, or were people who had -- were not fit at all.\nSo we had these German Austrian companies of the Pioneer Corps, that were made up of very f -\n- relatively very fit German Austrian Jews. And -- and the Pioneer Corps stayed there in\nIlfracombe in the southwest for a few weeks, for some sort of basic training, which of course did\nnot involve weap -- weapons. We were not trusted with weapons. And from there we went to\nYorkshire, my company went to Yorkshire, and -- which there w-was a big army camp, Ketray\ncamp, and from there we went to a very nice place in the -- the lake district, beautiful place\nwhere we build a -- a petroleum dump for storing gasoline. You know, it was all labor work. In\nKetray camp, I don\u2019t think we did that much labor yet, but then we went to this Sedberg. Now\nSedberg was in the lake district, a beautiful town with -- which had a -- one of these what\u2019s\ncalled public schools, which of course are these very, very private schools in England. And 1-1t\nwas pleasant, very pleasant to be there, first time a chance to go out and go to dances, and go to\nm-mix with the population, started having a girlfriend, things of that nature. Also, the other thing\nwas my father had a cousin in York. And I\u2019d never met them, but I knew they were there. And so\none Sunday I hitchhiked to York, and I came to know my father\u2019s cousin, who was the owner of\na very, very successful factory in -- 1-1n -- in England. I\u2019d heard about him, but I\u2019d never been\nthere, I\u2019d never been in touch with these people, but I just happened to go there. And on -- ona\nSunday afternoon, and I happened to find them at home. He had bought up a patent in Italy for a\nplastic which has what we would now call -- basically the structure of nylon. But he made it -- he\nmade it out of the milk that was rejected from the chocolate ma -- making process. And he sold\nthis -- his idea to Roundtree in York, the famous chocolate company, and he ec -- he got -- got\ntheir waste product, and he made this plastic which was called not Bakolite, but Gansolite,\nbecause his name was Gans, too. And they had this big factory there, very successful, and his\nhome really -- which was also one of these beautiful estates, almost in the center of York, his\nhome was sort of the rallying point for all of us Gans and related families from the American and\nBritish army, who happened to be in England. And this was -- this was a very, very nice c-\ncontact, and a very nice connection. I volunteered for every -- every damn thing that could be, to\nget me out of the Pioneer Corps. England was now alone. You know, the United States was not\nin -- not in the war, and Russia was -- had successfully divided Poland with hi -- with Hitler. So\nthey were not in the war. So the 1 -- the British had the idea that the only way they could possibly\ninflict a lot of damage on Germany was to have a huge Air Force. So they were looking for\nvolunteers for people to go into the Air Force. Well, I went to the examination, and all -- the\nexamination was in Blackpool, which was -- was about two or three hours by train ride from\nwhere -- from where I was. Passed the examination, was accepted in, but of course they -- they\ndidn\u2019t understand. When they f -- looked at my nationality they refused to let me in. But I had\nthe -- I ha -- for ye -- for a long time I carried around this piece of paper which showed that I had\npassed the part of the acceptance process for the Air Force. So that didn\u2019t work out.",
        "A: This is n -- this is now -- now, wait a minute, let me see. This is 19 -- it\u2019s nine 1940 -- four ni\n-- \u00b04]. It\u2019s 1941. And this -- you know, in -- in the meantime of course, th -- round about -- I\nthink it was in the spring of 1941, there was this meeting between Elizabeth and chur -- Churchill\non the high seas. America was still not in the war, but America had -- was giving for free, 50\ndestroyers to Great Britain on generally supporting -- supporting the British war effort. But th --\nRoosevelt could of course not go and -- and join in the war. There was far too much isolationism\nin the United States to allow him to declare war, but he was actually supporting the British in\ntheir war effort. And then in the summer of 1941, I don\u2019t know the exact date any more -- of\ncourse, from one minute to the other, Hitler moved his armies against Russia. It\u2019s apparently just\ntotally expected by both the British and the Americans. They had made all the provisions just\nwhat -- what they were going to do when this event would happen. I wish I would have copy\n[indecipherable] if you could get it off the streets that Churchill made that night when -- when\nGermany invaded Russia. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very applicable to our present situation in Iraq. He said\nsomething like I won\u2019t take back anything I have said against Communism, but I see a people\nnow being faced with a totally different ideology. I see the ordinary Russian people, and -- be --\nbeing faced with an -- a representative of an ideology that 1s totally alien to them, and I\u2019m sure\nthey will resist against it. [indecipherable] all this was -- I -- I -- I have to find the actual speech.\n[-I-It\u2019s -- it\u2019s very, very significant.",
        "A: Yes. Now -- I were -- things were loosening up. They allow -- we were allowed to -- we were\ngetting weps -- we were now subject to weapons training, and felt more -- by this time, I think\nwe were in Edinburgh. As a matter of fact, I -- we were working in a anti-aircraft unit that was\nthe first mixed sex -- sex mixed anti-aircraft unit in the -- in -- in Great Britain. And it was a\nvery, very interesting experience, too. Also some very lovely girls there, no doubt. And later on\nwe went to -- to Glasgow, and we worked -- we started working building an ammunition dump\nfor -- let me see, can\u2019t remember exact date any more. I think by this time -- can\u2019t remember the\ndate, six -- ha-have -- have to think this out, but I have a feeling that we were building this\nammunition dump for the Americans. So that must have been after Pearl Harbor then.",
        "A: Well, as I said, I -- I volunt -- volunteered for everything, and I think it was the end of 1942, I\nthink. By that time I had made my name in the -- in the unit. See, you know, th-these -- these\nPioneer Corps units were full of people who were -- who knew how to boast, and push\nthemselves forward very much. They were all experts at everything, you know. And I -- I, of\ncourse, I never participated very much in -- in -- in sports that were open to many people, things\nlike that. Well, one day I remember we had a -- they were -- they had a fo -- a race, a su -- sort of\nlike a sports day, and the -- you know, running a 400 meter, you know, this is actually one round\non -- and that was the major event there. And of course there were all these guys there who had\nbeen such champions in all their Maccabee clubs, and God knows, all over the place. Well, I did\nthe run, and I won it so easily. And now I had made my name, you know. I -- I -- I hadn\u2019t\nrealized myself how -- how -- how f -- much better I was at sports than all these people who were\nso -- boasting continuously about their powers, you know? A-And I knew when w-we were near\nGlasgow at the time, and we were billeted on pr -- in private homes -- you know, we were not\neating there, but were -- just slept there. Had a -- had a -- when -- I remember when I went home,\nI knew this was going to be the change of my life. And so it went. When eventually the call came\nfor people to go to something very, very special, I was one of the first who was s-selected to --\nbut there being -- after this event, we started a -- we competed in many, many different sports\nevents, and I was always very much the center of everything of the team that was sent by our\nunit, to all these sports event -- events, and I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve -- I was running on -- on -- on a cloud,\nyou know? So I think it was at the end of 1942 that I was -- went to London, and I was\ninterviewed by a man who had the uniform of a captain, and who obviously knew an awful lot,\nand knew what he wanted, and that turned out to be eventually the skipper, you know, he\u2019s --\nhe\u2019s all on the pictures there. I -- I s-should have gone through these pictures before with you.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And also then, we were interviewed by somebody from MI-five, who was supposed to make\nsure all on your background, and -- very knowledgeable people, very, very knowledgeable. You\nknow this [indecipherable] combination of the CIA and the FBI. And I was absolutely sure that I\nhad been accepted. I had no doubts about it whatsoever. And then, a few weeks later, or two\nweeks later, the [indecipherable] called to the [indecipherable] told me, and maybe three or four\nothers to go to the Pioneer Corps center in -- in Yorkshire. I think it was in Yorkshire, horrible\nplace. And there -- from there we were taken on a train by night, and the next morning we\narrived in Abu Dhabi, which was the training pl-place for [indecipherable] commando. And there\nwe changed our names, changed our identities. Within two hours, we all -- we had a false\nhistory, a false name, and that was it. And that was the beginning of the -- being in the\ncommandoes.",
        "A: My name was Fred Gray. I spelled it a-y. And we were all s-supposed to say that we were\nBritish by -- by nationality, but that our fathers, our parents had been assigned to such and such a\n-- m-my case it was, of course, Holland, since I spoke some Dutch, it was easy to do, had been\nassigned to -- to -- had -- had lived in -- in other countries. And so that\u2019s the reason why we had\ngrown up in -- abroad, but we were British by nationality.",
        "A: That you spoke German without an accent. This was extremely important. We didn\u2019t realize it\nat that time, how important this would [indecipherable] be. I only can ta -- give you one statistic.\nI must have caused the surrender of about 10,000 Germans [indecipherable] without a fight. I\ndidn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t realize it at the time. We were supposed to do long distance patrols,\nwe were supposed to do interrogation on -- on the battlefield, which we did, and which were very\nimportant. No doubt these were very important, because you know, we could interrogate the\nprisoners right there and then on the battlefield. And we had been trained for that. I had been to\nthe intelligence school in Cambridge, in -- in England. And so -- and that -- that was extremely\nimportant, no doubt about it. But the ability to walk into a German position and persuade people\nto surrender without fighting, proved more important than anything else. A-Anything else we\nlearned. After all, we learned everything. Mountaineering, parachute jumping. Anythi -- we\u2019d\ndone any -- everything there was to be done. But it -- the -- the ability to walk into a ger -- walk\ninto a German position and talk to them as if you were one of them, this was the main\ncontribution, as it turned out to be, for the war for us.",
        "A: Yeah, ju -- obviously there had to be some sort of infiltration and some fights before that,\nwhich you may have read about in the stories in which I wrote about [indecipherable] when we\ndid this repeatedly, or in France. You -- there had to be some sort of infiltration before that, but\nonce you were in that position, you -- then we were very, very persuasive. Don\u2019t threaten them\nwith a gun, just tell them quick how many --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Again, they said that was not necessarily what was planned for us, but this was what turned\nout to be our greatest asset.",
        "A: There were 87 people in the troop, and they were all, I think this -- with the exception of one\nor two, they were all German or Austrian Jews, meaning Jews by the t -- by Hitler\u2019s definition. A\nlot of them by wh-what we call Halachak definitions are not Jewish, because they had a -- a\nJewish father, and a non-Jewish mother. Quite a number of those, quite a number. Of course you\nknow a couple like that had to leave Germany very early, otherwise life was impossible for them,\nand a lot of them did leave very early. So by what we used to call Halachak Jewish law, Jewish\n[indecipherable] maybe 75 percent of us were Jewish.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t choose Jews, no. Those -- Montgomery -- I\u2019m sorry, Lord Mountbatten. Lord\nMountbatten, who was in charge of combat operation, who was -- you know, he\u2019s -- is the uncle\nof, you know, Prince Philip, the husband of the queen, he da -- his -- I think his parents had gone\nthrough some sort of experience in World War One, and he was in combat -- in charge of\ncombined operation, which consisted of the units of the army, largely commanders, Air Force,\nand Navy. And he came up with the idea that he had to have German speakers somewhere, and\nthat he needed really good German speakers, so he -- he sold that idea to Churchill, and\nChurchill was very enthused about it, and Churchill said that the troops should be called X-\ntroops. But of course that name had to be dropped, it was too suspicious. And then, you know,\nwe became a [indecipherable] of the inter-allied commando. That\u2019s how we were -- were -- how\nwe were known. Was a commando which had units, Belgian units, French units, Polish unit --\nunits, Norwegian unit, and well, that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s just -- not kept secret, but you know, we all went our different ways. The -- the\nskipper, the head of the troop got injured in France, you know, on a long term patrol, and he was\ntaken prisoner, and he was -- did not return until after the war. He wrote a very nice assessment\nof the troop back in 1946 or so. And -- you know, we were all, after the war we were all -- we --\nwe didn\u2019t particular think that we had done such great things. We were -- we were involved in\nour own careers, had to make a living. Potential wives, girlfriends, were not interested in what\nwe had done during the war. What they wanted was to get married and make sure that we had\nenough money to -- to have children and all that. And particularly this was the attitude of -- of\nthe parents of all our potential wives and girlfriends. So the whole idea was not really -- we da --\nwe -- we didn\u2019t care to -- we didn\u2019t have any reunions until maybe the 40\" anniversary of D-\nDay, and wh-what was that? That would have been in 1984, right? Yes. I -- I think that the first\none was 1984. And of course it\u2019s the -- Peter Maas\u2019s book that really brought all this out into the\nopen, better than anything else.",
        "A: Yes, we -- I was very much aware of it. I was very much aware, and so were my friends, that\nthis was something totally unique. My -- my closest friends were very, very supportive of all\nthis, and they realized what were -- what had happened. But it -- but 1t remained a unique\nexperience. We -- and, you know, my experience of course was very -- almost very different\nfrom everybody else\u2019s experience. First of all, I refused to go to the officer\u2019s training school. I\ndidn\u2019t want to miss the war. My -- my closest friends in the [indecipherable] troop went in to\nofficer training school for four months just before D-Day, and of course they missed most of the\nwar. I absolute refused to go. I wer -- and then there came an order from the British army\ncommand that people were not to be promoted to officers in their field without going to officer\u2019s\ntraining school. Well, I didn\u2019t care two hoots about it, but 1t so happens that of course I was\nattached to a Marine unit. And the Marines didn\u2019t have to take any notice of all these army un1-\nunits. I was with the Marine commando, and one day they colonel said, \u201cTell me who you really\nare. I -- I want to make -- I want to put you in for be-becoming an officer.\u201d",
        "A: Oh, it was very handy. You know, I -- I had no difficulty with it. And you have -- in England\nyou have the desire to submerge yourself. It\u2019s not like American society. You know, if you tell --\nin those days, it\u2019s very different now, very different now, in those days if you told a British\nperson -- a British person, I\u2019m going to be naturalized, and become British, and they would say,\n\u201cYou? You\u2019re not British.\u201d You know, tha -- but here, people -- you come in this country, and\nit\u2019s -- the people ask you when are you going to get your naturalization, or have you gotten it\nalready, you know? And braka -- hurry up, and so on, so forth. Totally different attitude in this\ncountry. But -- so. you had a desire in England to submerge yourself and pretend that -- were --\nto be something that you were not. And -- so that suited in very, very handily. Of course, I had to\ngive up being an Orthodox Jew, in doing that, you know? But --",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s -- it was part of -- this was part of the sacrifice you make. I want to tell you a story\nwhich is very, very interesting, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve not told it before. When we were in the Isle of Mann\nin the inte -- internment camp -- as I said, we were Orthodox Jews living together, there was a\nman there by -- he was the son of Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg. Rabbi Spitzer from Hamburg\nwas known as a great Talmudist, very ultra-Orthodox who had come out of Hungary to become a\n-- arabbi, chief rabbi of -- of Hamburg, in Germany. His son was regarded to be far superior to\nthe father, as far as brain and knowledge was concerned. And one day t -- one day to the other,\nthe son decided that a rabbinical career was not for him, and he wanted to go into law. He knew\nTalmudic law fantastically, and he then went and became -- took his legal papers in Germany. Of\ncourse he couldn\u2019t practice by the time he\u2019d finished. So, you know, he couldn\u2019t be a lawyer,\nJewish lawyer in Germany any more. But he was with me in there, in the same house in which I\nwas in -- on the Isle of Mann. And he -- he was a tall man, good looking man, always -- he did\nnot run around with a yarmulke, he run -- was running around with [indecipherable] golf cap --\ngolf cap [indecipherable], but I mean, he was a ultra, ultra-Orthodox Jew. Extremely well versed.\nI mean, a lot of the things which I have learned, attitudes which I have taken on Halachak and\nJewish law, I\u2019ve learned from him. Well, the day when we -- we volunteered, when I and two or\nthree other people in the house volunteered for the British army, it came out -- we went into our\ndining room where -- which was the only common room there was, and we announced to people\nthere that -- what we had done, that we volunteered for the army. There was a fellow there by the\nname of Josele. Well, Josele was a devoted Yeshiva student, absolute -- not too brilliant,\nabsolutely devoted to -- to [indecipherable]. He got very, very upset, and he said, \u201cIf y -- you --\nwhat you doing 1s you will have to work on Saturdays, you\u2019ll hardly be able to eat kosher food.\nYou will have to starve yourself to go. This -- the fact that you volunteer for this army, it just\ngoes to show that you put your secular existence far above your Jewish consciousness.\u201d And in\nthe corner was this ra -- Spitzer, the lawyer rabbi, and he was sitting behind his books. And he\ncame out, he -- he looked up from his book, and he said, \u201cBut Josele,\u201d -- remember, this in 1940,\n\u201cit\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s not a mitzvah -- mitzvah to fight Hitler?\u201d Josele, he had a totally different -- totally\ndifferent attitude to this -- to -- he saw the larger implication, in spite of the fact that by that time\nthere had no -- not been concentration camps, mass extermination and all that sort of thing. You\nknow, after all this was all st -- still to come. But it stuck -- stuck -- stuck into my mind, and --",
        "A: Yeah, and this, you know, this is -- this is why I was willing to accept -- accept whatever it\nmeant, or whatever I had to do, because -- including giving up being an Orthodox Jew, when the\ntime came to be at the commandoes.",
        "A: It\u2019s a -- ina sort of general way, yes. But you know, there was too many other things we had\nto concentrate on to -- to even start thinking about all this. I -- I -- to me the Jewish religion is a\nset of ideas which I practice, and it\u2019s -- I -- I\u2019m not that comfortable in praying because the\nprayers to me are -- have a great depth, but they are an idiom that we cannot relate to. And just as\nyou find in a lot of ultra Orthodox Jews, they rather sit down and study the Talmud than go and\ndo -- do prayers. And -- and you know, this is -- so you had a guidance there, and -- when it was\nabsolutely needed, but that wasn\u2019t very often. And I -- when I was in difficult situations, I did not\n-- not pray. I remember that one [indecipherable] one -- you may have read this story I written\nabout Pontlivek, when I suddenly found myself in this German artillery fire, very much exposed,\nand I just -- I -- you know, I s -- I sort of said, get me out of this. Bus -- was addressing wa -- I\nwas obviously addressing a higher authority, like God or so. And -- but it -- 1t required moments\nof that nature to make -- to make me -- to make me even think about -- about religion. Normally\nthe concentration had to be all on techniques. Going through a minefield, doing this and that and\nthe other. Always a technique we had [indecipherable] out. You had to concentrate. There was\nno time to -- to think of anything else. And that\u2019s [indecipherable] made it all possible.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, it -- yes. We had -- we had been -- we had tried to do certain raids on France before D-\nDay, by parachute, and certain missions were planted, or didn\u2019t come off, some of them, bec --\nbecause we always -- when you were -- when a -- when a force like that went out by parachute,\nthey had to go out with the massive bombers that attacked the American and British bombers that\nattacked [indecipherable] Germany at the time. So you had to blend in, and then you drop -- you\ndrop out and do certain things. Well, none of these things came off, partially because of bad\nweather, partially because the information was obtained from different means and so on, so forth.\nSo, though we had been prepared for certain raids, and some of us had been on certain raids, I\npersonally had not been in any actual fight until D-Day. We were sequestered -- oh, let me go\nback a little bit. The -- our troop, the German speaking inter-allied commando troop was split up\njust before D-Day, when there were four or five of us attached to every invading commando\ntroop. I was assigned together with a fellow by the name of Morris Latimer, whose -- and the\nSergeant Major of the troop, O\u2019 Neill, and a fellow by the name of Tommy sw-Swenton. These\nare all these cover names of course. Morris Latimer, for instance, was Morris Levi from the\nSudetenland before he joined that troop. So we were assigned to 41 [indecipherable] Marine\ncommando. And we were held in camps for I think two or three weeks while we were being\nbriefed about the landing. And w -- we couldn\u2019t communicate with anybody outside because\nthose -- they were -- didn\u2019t tell us where we would land. We knew -- we had -- we saw maps, for\nwhich people who really knew France well could have guessed where this was. But I\u2019m -- we\npersonally, we didn\u2019t know where it was going to be. We didn\u2019t know we were going to land in\nNormandy. So we were in these camps for about two or three weeks, and then one evening, total\ndarkness, we were -- we embarked into little boats, infantry landing boats, which had -- each\nboat had maybe something like 80 people. And the -- all flotilla set out without light, without any\nintercommunication, in a pitch dark night. And as far as I know there were no -- no accidents.\nWe sailed past the Isle of Wight in total darkness, couldn\u2019t see anything at all. And -- and that\nwas it. The sea was not too rough, it was acceptable, and we -- as we approached, as we came\ncloser to the coast in the morning, well, it must have been about six or seven o\u2019clock in the\nmorning by the time we landed. But before that we could start to see the massive bombardment\nof the coast, and the shooting back of -- of the -- of the German guns back to us. And one of us\nalways sat on the steps, so that s -- way you could look out and sort of gave a running\ncommentary on what was happening, what he was seeing, and soon -- of course pretty soon the\nGerman [indecipherable] guns started -- the shells started falling nearer to us. Lucky tha --\nluckily we were not hit. And now, before all this, while we were in the camps, Montgomery, the\na -- the British commander had come around, and he had said, \u201cLook, every time there\u2019s a\nlanding, everybody sticks to the beach because they want to be protected by the Navy. Get off\nthe beaches. You can -- don\u2019t,\u201d -- and that struck me as being very, very significant. The really\ntr-trust that the British have in their Navy, that I could see that the soldiers wouldn\u2019t get away\nfrom the beach. And I was absolutely set I was not going to let this happen to me. So, when --\nwhen the -- the -- the -- our boat approached the -- the coast -- and of course as I said, we now\nwere under direct fire -- as soon as I could, I run down the gangway, and I got -- got down -- was\non the beach, and lo and behold, I saw about 25 German soldiers who had been taken prisoner by\nthe engineer\u2019s unit that has preceded us, who were supposed to blow up the obstacles, the anti-\ntank obstacles that were on the beach. And so I run over to those Germans, and I say to them,\n\u2018\u201c\u2018Where\u2019s the pass through the minefields?\u201d Well, you know, at that time -- a few days later I\ndidn\u2019t have any fear of mines any more, but at that time I still was very much aware. And lo and\nbehold, when I didn\u2019t threaten them, and, you know, about being -- talking their own language,\nthe first thing that occurred to me is these guys look exactly like us German Jews. Different\nuniform and they could be on our side. And lo and behold they told me. I didn\u2019t threaten them, I\nhad the tommy gun down. I just said, in a very calm way, \u201cWhere\u2019s the pass through the mine\nfields?\u201d And they pointed it out to me. And so I gathered as many people as I could, and I\u2019d\ngotten through the -- gotten off the beach, and gotten into Lyon sur Mer without a single\ncasualty. So the -- the -- the -- that -- that was, that part of it, that was off, and actually we lost 50\npercent of the unit. Out of 450 people we lost 50 percent on that day. Later on, when we made\nthe landing in Washoe, in -- which was much more heavily defended than the Normandy\nbeaches, much more heavily defended, we lost, out of 450 people, we lost 11 people in the\nlanding. But by that time we were so experienced that nobody could come equal to us. And\neverybody did the same as I did, get off the boat, get over the beaches, forget about it and get\nout.",
        "A: No, not at all. This was the beginning of D-Day. Now, they -- we n -- we knew where the\nGerman strong points were, and we were at the other end of the village. Luckily, the pass\nthrough the mine field was at one end of Lyon sur Mer, and the German strong point was in the\nother. I had no doubt where we were. You know, we had studied the maps sufficiently. I knew\nwe were at the other end, we had nothing to be afraid of, not until we would get to the strong\npoint. Obviously the Germans are go -- going to be in their strong points. Why should they be\nout on the road, in the French villages? The French who have murdered them, you know? So, the\nfirst thing, I gather up a few guys, we started making our way along the road that was le -- going\ntowards the German strong point. But, you know, you -- you cannot be out in the streets, I -- and\n-- when it -- when it comes to -- when there\u2019s so much artillery fire and mortar fire. It\u2019s -- the\nsplinters will carry. So you have to go from one door to the other, dive in and dive out. And of\ncourse the population was on our side. They willingly opened the doors for us. So I says you\nknow, you couldn\u2019t do this in Germany. We knew that we would never be able to do this type of\nstreet fighting in Germany, and we didn\u2019t intend to do it, and the British high command saw to it\n-- had come to the same conclusion. So we were diving from one house into the other. In some\nhouses actually there were people who had been quite badly injured, with all the bombardment\nby one side or the other. In fact as -- as we got out, you know, to the road first, there were some\nBritish soldiers who had obviously been killed by being out on the street when the -- when a\nshell exploded. You know, y-you cannot stay out under these conditions. So we worked our way\n-- a few of us worked our way towards the strong point. When we got into this position where we\nthought we were about in the view of the strong point, we knew there was an anti-tank gun\npointing at us down the road, we got off the street, we got into [indecipherable] abandoned\nhouses, which was quite obviously that we were now very close to the strong point. And I went\nupstairs and tried to look out and look into the strong point, but some German sniper must have\nseen me there, and he fired at me, but thank God he missed. So I rushed downstairs again. I think\nI -- so I went down into the house, and we were sort of milling around, deciding what to do next,\nwhen we heard a loud bang on the house next door. And ta -- so -- obviously some missile was\ngoing from our side into the strong point. So we really didn\u2019t know what the hell this was. We\nwere absolutely sure that apart from our -- our people there could be nobody there. So we went\nthere, and we found an Arab, who had the typical look of what the -- how the Germans portrayed\nthe Jews, you know, black hair, crooked nose and all that. And he had a 19 [indecipherable] war\nfront loader rifle, which he somehow had gotten hold of, and he was firing this into the German\nstrong point. So -- because nobody spoke French, ik -- yeah, my own French was very deficient\nin those days, I now speak French much better [indecipherable] transfer two years in the\nmeantime. But we persuaded him that he should join us, which he gladly did. And he was with\nus for -- until the winter of 1944 -- \u00b045. So, after that, the colonel of the unit wanted me to go\nwith him and look at all the different positions which the different troops of 41 commandos had\nnow taken up around the German strong point. And I went with him. And he was one of those\nguys who wouldn\u2019t take no notice of any German fire. He was running around with a briefcase.\nHis name, I think, was Colonel Grey, but he spelled it with e-y, and not a-y like I did. And he --\nhe wouldn\u2019t throw himself down and her -- heard an artillery shell come over, and we heard a\nmortar come, and -- and [indecipherable] but I wasn\u2019t going to do this, so I dodged the way I\u2019d\nlearned to dodge it, and as a matter of fact the next day the colonel was severely injured, he was\nout of the war. So, so much for somebody taking such incredible risks, were totally unjustified.\nBut then we had -- I -- a troop of South African armored vehicles came up and came into the\nvillage from the beach, and the colonel persuaded them to make a straight attack along the main\nroad to -- on -- on to the German strong point. Which was crazy. The way we did this later on,\nwe used armored vehicles, and even tanks, only as mobile guns. We had them -- h-hid them\nsomewhere in the field, and had them shoot and lay down covering fire while we went in.\nAnyhow, this attack totally failed. I didn\u2019t participate in it because I knew it would -- would be\npractically suicide to do that. But there was one of the troops of 41 [indecipherable] commando,\nY troop, and they lost about half the troop of what they still had, in trying to do this attack,\nbecause as we knew well from our -- from the maps we had been given before D-Day, there was\na German [indecipherable] tank pointing right down the road. There was no chance that an\narmored car could get by that. So we hadn\u2019t -- we hadn\u2019t -- we had not succeeded in taking the\nstrong point on that day. By now it was getting late. We were in a -- on a farm outside Lyon\nsomewhere, and I also was getting extremely hungry, and I -- I found myself of -- a ditch that\nhad a sort of stone lining on both sides, which I took cover, and start -- started to prepare some of\nthe food which we had, it was -- I hadn\u2019t eaten all day long. I don\u2019t think we had eaten during the\nnight either. There was cocoa. There was -- I mean, there were drinks available, but I -- I didn\u2019t\ntake strong drinks because they slow down your reaction too much. And jus -- just at that time,\nthe -- there was a magnificent sight of massive numbers of allied gliders, British gliders come --\nbeing pulled by airplanes coming over, to land on the other side of Lyon canal, and they were\nsort of -- you know, you could see them being detached, going on their own, and coming down.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: So this shows that things were proceeding along the way they were planned. Also, by this\ntime a German fighter came over and flew right along the beaches. And you know it says in the\nbook the longest day? That\u2019s -- he got away with it, nobody shot at him, but that wasn\u2019t true, lots\nof people shot at him, of course, nu -- none of us hit him. But, you know, it -- one fighter alone\ncould not make much of a difference, probably sent in to scare people off, but it didn\u2019t --\ncouldn\u2019t -- it wouldn\u2019t work in our case. So this was the first -- this was D-Day, it was the end of\nD-Day. I slept very well that night in my ditch. I needed it. Next morning, we continued what we\nwere supposed to do on D-Day, we were supposed to conquer German headquarters, move it\ninland. We were supposed to get the Lyon sur Mer strong point, and we were supposed to get\ninto Luc sur Mer. We had to -- not succeeded doing in any idle -- any of these things. So, next\nmorning the first thing we -- it was decided we\u2019 ll attack the German headquarters in -- inland.\nWell, that didn\u2019t tu-turn -- it wasn\u2019t much of a headquarters. This happens to be a battalion that\nhad just come from the Russian front and they were pretty decimated. And we decided we were\nnot going to go with covering fire, we were just going to run in and surprise them, and s -- which\ncame off beautifully. And s -- I found three Germans there who were obviously volgama -- the\nGermans call volgadeutshe, the German nationals from -- from Russia or Poland, they\u2019re -- very\nhard to understand them. I tried to get some more information from them, but they proved t-\ntotally useless. So then I turned around to take part in the attack on the Luc sur Mer strong point\n-- the Lyon sur Mer strong point, but by the time I arrived there, the strong point had given up.\nAnd th -- so, I was late. They -- I don\u2019t exactly know how -- I think it was B troop of 41\ncommando that was under the leadership of -- of very, very good officer, whom I had\naccidentally met already a year ago before that. And he managed to apparently get -- infiltrate his\npeople into the strong point, and get the strong point to surrender. So we went on, and the next\nstage was very simple. We got into Luc sur Mer very easily, and this -- this was the far end of the\nBritish Canadian landing, and now we were at the border of the American and British beach\nhead. And that was supposed to be our D-Day assignment, so this was the end of -- of our D-Day\nassignment.",
        "A: I can say that important information that had strategic significance, I ca -- don\u2019t think I ever --\never was in that position. My idea was get as many of them to surrender as you can -- can get.\nFind some high ranking officer who will go with you and make everybody surrender. This -- this\nhas worked out to be ex -- excellent strategy, and this worked ma-many, many times. Now, I\nmust say that I know of others who j -- of -- from [indecipherable] commando, who had tried this\nand did not succeed in -- and -- and -- and who got killed in one of these attempts, and I almost\nwas in a similar situation, too. Well, the -- after we -- we -- after this D-Day experience, we had a\nrather unique experience besieging two underground German radar stations. They had been left\nbehind in the allied advance, and they were fully manned, and they were hev -- very, very\nheavily fortified, incredibly heavily fortified. And it was just decided that it was not worthwhile\nto make an attack -- a direct attack on them. So we were positioned around them, near -- near\nthem, and we were just as -- supposed to keep them on their toes, make believe that they were\nabout to be attacked. The -- the tra -- the trouble was that the allies were building -- had planned\nto build an air -- airp -- airport, an air [indecipherable] abou -- only about maybe a mile away\nfrom these radar stations. And that plan had to go ahead, you know, there were fields there that\nwere suitable for landing aircrafts on it, and this had to go ahead. And they couldn\u2019t take any\nnotice of the fact that these ger -- these underground fortifications were still there. So our task\nwas to make them believe that they were just about to be attacked. And -- which we -- which we\nsuccessfully managed to do for about a week or so. There were a lot of adventures that we had,\nwhere we did things that were totally wrong, that you would never have done a month or two\nlater when we had much more experience. But luckily most of the time we were -- we got away\nwith it. Eventually enough equipment was saved for us -- spared for us that we could do a\ndaylight attack on it, and -- and it was successful. Again, I managed to get these guys out, to\nsurrender. So you had -- we took 450 people prisoner on -- on that day, and we marched them\ndown to the beach, to the -- t-to -- to the prisoner camps of which there were there, but we\nshipped out. That was an interesting experience which I\u2019ve written up in great detail. If you want\nto read, you can read it. After that experience, we went to the -- what we might call the eastern\nfront of the Normandy beach head, which was on -- we -- we were in the part that was hev --\nvery heavily fortified, which was still the extension of what the Germans call the Atlantic wall.\nAnd, of course this -- I call it the Hedgerow war, because the -- we were always going along or\nthrough some hedgerows to get to our -- to find the German alliance, so [indecipherable], a-and\nth-this was a -- a -- oh, of course you got a -- a tiring sort of a -- of a experience, but we managed\nto keep the Germans on their toes with lots of patrols, and usually I had to go out on every damn\npatrol there was, because by na -- by now the troops, the Marines would hardly ever go out\nunless I -- I or -- mo -- Morris La -- or I was present, Morris Latimer had been injured on the\nradar stations and he had went back to -- to England. The Sergeant Major O\u2019Neill was still with\nme, swent -- Tommy Swentin had gone home on deeplus two or three, he said he was shell-\nshocked. And O\u2019Neill was still there, but he was largely with the officers, so I hardly ever saw\nthem -- saw him.",
        "A: No, no, no. As a matter of fact, that was the un -- unbelievable attitude. If somebody spoke to\nthem in fluent German, they thought that well, you know, we are -- we have -- of such high\nculture, of course other people speak our language.",
        "A: No, no, not at all. Not at all. Nobody even dreamt of it. It was -- it was unbelievable. And that\nI think is a -- a -- you know, of course ga -- cultured pe-people speak German, naturally, right?\nAnd I\u2019m sure you speak German, too. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not cultured.",
        "A: Yeah. So -- yeah, and from -- from that -- so we got on the -- on the northeastern part of the --\nof the -- of the Normandy beach head. From there we shifted over to something absolutely\nterrible, the southeastern part, the southeastern corner of the beach head. Again, this was the --\nthe only thing that was lucky about it is there ha-had been a British guards battalion there before\nus, they had dug some way with trenches. We were now something like, maybe maximum 200 -\n300 yards away from the German lines. And the bombardment was day and night, mortars,\nartillery. Artillery is all right because you know it goes off and you can hear it coming and you\nknow what to do, throw yourself into a ditch. But the mortar fires were -- could be very\nsurprising, you know. We -- we -- we le -- it was o -- it was a lot like being in World War One, it\nwas trench warfare practically. But at night again, we went out on patrol, shot up patrols, we got\nshot up on -- on patrol and things like that until one day -- of course we were very much aware of\nthe fact of what was happening on the other fronts. The fact that the Americans were breaking\nthrough and going south, that they were going west into Brittany, and that they were swinging\naround as the British -- had been a terrible mass I-losses of germ -- of two and a half German\ndivisions in one night with that -- were poised for counterattack on -- on the British advance, th -\n- the Germans had not -- thought that they could keep this counterattack of two and a half\nGerman divisions secret, but they -- but of course it was all seen from the air, with the ability that\nthe British Air Force had to -- to look at all German movements, and so it came in with a very\nheavy -- before the -- the Germans could even start to move, came in with a very, very heavy\nthousand bombers attack. And most of these two and a half -- the people of the two and a half\ndivisions -- SS divisions, they -- they died through lack of ox -- oxygen, or lack of -- or ho -- of\nhi -- excessively high pressure that they ex-experienced being out in the open, being ready for\ncounterattack. That was -- then -- that was a -- none of these divisions appeared again for the rest\nof the war. They were SS divisions.",
        "A: I think that, you know, sus-sustained frightening, was the position we were in in Pontlivek,\nbecause we were a cross place, the Germans are at one side in a railway -- in a railway station\nand we were on the other side, and we were be -- behind walls at [indecipherable] but we knew\nthe walls were -- would not stand -- would not stand a anti-tank gun shot, and we knew that the\nGermans usually left -- with their rear guards they usually left an anti-tank gun. And that would\nhave gone right through us. But v-very soon -- th-this was realized that we were in too exposed a\nposition, and we were told to get -- get out of this position and just -- because also, the Germans\nhad left devices in -- in all the bedrooms of the houses, which w -- suddenly all the -- all the\nhouses around us went on fire, and -- you know, this was a sustained, longer experience. But we\nmanaged to get out of this, and get out and then we did what we did -- always did, we defeated\nma -- we made 10 night attacks in 10 days in that -- that -- during that time. So we were taken\nout of Pontlivek, was decided what we\u2019ll do is we -- we\u2019ll go around on the night attacks, and we\nsa -- we go past them, and don\u2019t do a frontal assault anywhere.",
        "A: Not until very, very much later. I -- even when I -- the first time I got back into my own\nhometown in Borken, which was Easter Saturday, the town had been taken on the Thursday,\nThursday, that Thursday before Easter. I knew about it, and you know, by that time I -- I was an\nofficer, I could move around as I wanted to. Everybody supported me, and I went into Borken,\nand we -- even at that time we realized that things were not over. And you know, actually there\nwere quite a number of people from sweep of troop -- tank commandoes, who were killed before\nHannover. You know, this is hundred miles away, this is almost on the -- on the line with --\nwhere the two armies, the Russian and the -- a-and the ar -- western forces met. Even there, there\nwas still resistance. It -- 1t was just unbelievable. We knew this fa -- and they were fanatics, these\npeople. And the closer it was getting home to them, the c-ca -- th-the worse it got, and we had\nabsolutely no illusion about it, that -- that there was still some heavy fighting ahead of us at all\ntimes. We had -- we si -- it so happens that they -- they -- you know, we were on the Dutch --\nDutch front, it never lit up. We -- we never personally were involved. But at any moment we\ncould have been told get over to this and this and this position, and that would have been -- and\nthere would have been real fanatical resistance. There was a very good friend of mine, a German\nwriter, who wrote a -- a book called, \u201cFive Minutes Before Midnight,\u201d where he describes how\nthere\u2019s last minute resistance in this area, all the time, and of course he says this -- this led to the\ndestruction of all these towns in -- in our home district, because there were always some fanatics\nwho said they could hold out, and you had -- you had to -- had to take care of it. Quite apart from\nthe fact that we just knew if there was going to be an invasion of Japan, we were going to be in\nit. This unit had been in the invasion of Sicily, had been in the inva -- invasion of Italy, had -- we\nhad been in Normandy. We had done the invasion of Washoe. There -- no way was there going\nto be an invasion of Japan without us. So, the war was not over.",
        "A: No, w-we [indecipherable] particularly after we -- we felt very much experienced, battle\nexperienced, superior to the -- to the Germans. Better -- we were better equipped, we knew how\nto move better. A lot of their strength had gone out by too fanatical resistance. The fear -- the\nfear was not a real condition any more. Ve -- very, very confident what we could do, particularly\nafter the -- during and after the Washoe invasion. It was a -- was a terrific morale booster for us\nthat everything had gone so smoothly against incredible fortifications. So -- so --",
        "A: We were still in the south of Holland, in -- you know, the -- that part of Holland never\nsurrendered. Th-the Germans never surrendered at all until I don\u2019t know wh -- well after -- even\nafter we left. So, you know, I had heard through people who had been -- go-gotten to Switzerland\nin this exchange of Eichmann\u2019s, of Jews against trucks, that my parents were in Theresienstadt,\nso I was set to go there at the earliest possible moment.",
        "A: I would say in 1941. There were still Red Cross letters, you know. 1941. A -- long before I\nwent into the commandoes. That was the last time I [indecipherable] then they went -- they went\ninto hiding too, but of course they got betrayed. That\u2019s one story I\u2019ve never written up and my\nbrother is always telling me to write that up, that story, because I confronted that guy, and he\nfinally got 10 years prison for -- but he done a lot of other things apart from betraying my\nparents. He had s-sold all the weapons of the Dutch underground to the Communists. When -- he\nwasn\u2019t a Communist, no way, but he was after money. He was state detective. So --",
        "A: Well, as I said, there was this exchange of Jews against trucks, and some of these had gotten\nto -- family had gone to Switzerland. They wrote to my uncle in -- in New York, saying that my\nparents were in ter -- Terezin, and he wrote it t -- to my younger brother, who was still -- whose\naddress he still knew. Of course that nobody knew what I was doing, or where I was. I had a\ncover address and all that, and eventually that news got to me, that they were in -- probably in\nTerezin. And this is why I decided I want to try to get there. So after -- soon as I got permission\nto do that, I took a Jeep and a driver, and we drove all across Germany into the Sudetenland,\nwhich had not surrendered yet, still German divisions, it was still real German. Then we drove\ninto the Russian lines, and Terezin had been liberated by the Russians just two days before I\ncame there.",
        "A: This was -- I think I got to Terezin on May 12\", so I think it was -- must be May 12\" I got\nthere, or May 11\", something like -- or maybe it wa -- somewhere around that time. It was two --\ntwo or three days after -- after V-E Day.",
        "A: The -- the journey was hard for us because we had so much trouble with the Jeep. But you\nknow, you could always drive into some British or American repair station, and they didn\u2019t fuss\naround very much, they gave you new wheels, they gave you new -- new shock absorbers, new\nbrakes, whatever you have -- whatever you needed could always be obtained pretty rapidly. But\nthen, you know, once we left there, w-we ca -- first we came accidentally into the Russian line. I\nhadn\u2019t wanted to do this, so I went back into the -- went back to American lines, spent the night\nthere. I described it in great detail in my report. And then, next morning we set out and we\ncrossed over into unconquered territory, the -- Germany has [indecipherable] to be. That\u2019s the\nnorthern foothills of the Atz mountains of the Sudeten mountains. And it was an interesting\nexperience to see Germany as it had been, officers strutting around and so on, but of course I\ncouldn\u2019t stop. And we went up into the mountains and came across two and a half German\ndivisions that were still there, f-fully armed. And they, I\u2019m sure, are the same divisions as I menti\n-- as I mentioned -- as -- as mentioned in the story of -- Schindler. You remember the Schindler\nstory? That when -- when they -- when he was going [indecipherable] to be rushed into the\nAmerican lines from the Russian lines, they -- he -- he -- he came across two -- two and a half\nGerman divisions. I\u2019m sure that those were the same divisions. Anyhow, we crossed that, went\ndown, and finally hit the Russian lines, and it was -- the Russians were so enthused when they --\neverybody wants to shake hands, and embrace you. You know, the [indecipherable] was a\nmanifestation of these two armies, western armies, and the Russian armies having -- having\ncome together, you know, there must have been millions of such encounters. But particularly\nthese people whom we met there, they had -- they had not been through this experience at all,\nand therefore they -- they were just delighted to see a western allied vehicle fully armed, with\npeople in it. This was their meeting of east and west, you know. Fa -- I forgot [indecipherable]\nthey looked as if they had come all -- all the way from Stalingrad, and this was, you know, the\nfirst German defeat in the f -- major German defeat in -- in Russia, and we had come all the way\nfrom the Normandy beaches.",
        "A: N-No, I can\u2019t say so. I -- I -- I -- I was -- didn\u2019t feel emotional in those days, I really didn\u2019t.\nTher -- they were happy, we were happy, it was a great experience. This is what we had looked\nforward to, and -- [interruption]. Yeah, the attitude, thank God, was -- that I had was different,\nthat\u2019s right. ... I am -- when -- when -- when I got into the camp -- into the camp there, you\nknow, and again the officer at the entrance of the troops who were guarding the exit there, he\nwanted to shake hands, you know, make his contact with the western allied army, and then he\nsaid, \u201cLook, there\u2019s one area in this camp in which there\u2019s the -- what you call the zoif --",
        "A: Typhus, yeah, but he called it zoisha, of course, in German. And if your parents are in that,\nyou have to promise me that you\u2019|l come out and not go -- go, forget about seeing them.\nOtherwise I can\u2019t let you go back into your own army. So --",
        "A: Yeah. Now that I think about it, it was just incredible what risks we took. Incredible. Was all\nthese -- first of all there\u2019s -- there\u2019s the danger of the car breaking down, what are you going to\ndo? And the second thing is, the Germans up in the Sudetenland. They were fully armed. They --\nyou know, they were there to -- to fight. But I -- like -- just like on -- on the -- some of the patrols\nI did, in open daylight. You rely on the fact that they\u2019re not going to shoot at a single vehicle.\nThey\u2019re too surprised to see just a single vehicle, just like they are too surprised to see -- see a\nsingle person coming, approaching them in a friendly way, you know? So people don\u2019t have\ntheir finger on the trigger in a position of that nature. So that -- that was the second danger. Now,\nthe Russians I think were very, very cooperative, but I also -- there were certain situations which\nI carefully avoided, such as ch -- taking girls out of the -- out of the concentration camp\n[indecipherable] be very inviting to do that, but we would have never -- would have never gone\nback with the Russians, you know. This is -- you couldn\u2019t do any of those things. So there\u2019s\nquestion of having enough gasoline, you know, there was no gasoline, and we -- we -- we were\njust loaded up with gasoline and we had to rely on the fact that we would get back into American\nlines before we run out of -- of gas. So --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: Well, first bi -- 1t was -- 1t was a -- pretty shocking experience to see people like this, you\nknow, in their -- their starved state. Some of them -- quite a number of them too weak to even get\nup -- get out of the way for our car. That\u2019s -- it was a -- that was [indecipherable] impressions,\nthe next impression I had is this -- these are all very familiar faces. These are the Jews amongst\nwho I\u2019ve lived all my life. So n-not that it struck me as being so emotional at the time, but this is\nwhat I realized. And I don\u2019t know who told me, maybe the Russian guards told me that there\u2019s a\nregistry where I could find out whether my parents were still there, or whether they -- or where\nthey would be. You know, I asked around and found my way to this central registry. And there\nwas still one girl working -- by now it was something like five o\u2019clock in the evening I think. We\nhad been traveling all day long without a break, without stopping for food anywhere. And I p --\nasked this girl -- gave her my name of my parents and she s -- she said, \u201cYou are extremely\nlucky. They\u2019re still here.\u201d So she said, \u201cI\u2019Il] come with you.\u201d So then went to the house where\nthey were. They were supposed to live in, you know, again you saw this terrible overcrowding,\nwent to -- I left the driver outside of course, and went upstairs. It was like people everywhere,\nyou know? There was just -- there was just no space for anything. It was like having people\nmove around you. So the girl then went to my parents, she found them, and [indecipherable] and\nshe told them, \u201cI have good news for you, your son 1s here.\u201d",
        "A: No. No feeling. I was shocked to see my parents in the state they were, particularly my father.\nI wouldn\u2019t have recognized him, I -- a bit of a shock, y -- 1t was not -- it was not emotional\nexperience at the time. Now it is, when you think back about it.",
        "A: No, I just -- Ij -- managed to f-fight down all my feelings for things. Shock yes, but deep\nemotional, no. Now -- now y -- now you remember this and you cry. Most of the time I couldn\u2019t\nhave done that. There was no -- no way. There was no -- were not my feelings.",
        "A: Yeah, yes. Yeah, I mean you had to do without your feelings. I mean, you know, it\u2019s -- you\nhave to overcome your feelings when you jump out of an airplane, you know? Particular if -- if\nyou jump out of an airplane through the bottom, and not through the side door. And things of that\nnature. Y-Y-You had to s -- just have to s -- s -- concentrate on technique and not -- not get\ncarried away with any emotion. Yeah, there\u2019s a good saying was -- they had in the parachute\nschool, the instructors, they told us always, if you start feeling sorry for yourself, get out of here,\nyou won\u2019t jump. Ge -- get out before you have -- before you\u2019re going to get your badge, because\nyou can still ge -- if you get frightened when you -- this was the British army [indecipherable]\nsays, \u201cIf you get frightened and want to get out, get out.\u201d They let you get out, but once you had\nyour badge, of course, it was your du-duty to go ahead and -- and jump. And th-tha-that\u2019s\nsomething -- something worthwhile remember, I -- I very often quote -- quote that, if you start\nfeeling sorry for yourself, you won\u2019t jump. Y-You know, you can\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves.\nWe\u2019re in the position where -- where we are, just our own choice. Maybe not by own choice, but\nthen we can\u2019t help it, and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: My father looked like.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t have recognized him. If I had met him on the street I wouldn\u2019t have recognized\nhim.",
        "A: Well, I mean, he -- he was, you know, he -- he was a well fed man before the war, and people\nshrivel up, you know, particularly in that situation in which they had been. They totally shrivel\nup. And he -- you can hardly recognize. They age. I mean that -- you know, after my father had\nbeen back in Holland for two or three weeks, he looked his former self again, you know? But\npeople changed totally.",
        "A: She somehow -- somehow she was slightly different, she was more -- you see, my father not\nbe -- having only one lung and one leg, was probably more subject to -- to these hardships. And\nmy mother somehow had managed to live through it. She worked in the S.S. kitchen, stole -- s-\nstole the potatoes. Had no fear of these people, and somehow got through in a more positive way.",
        "A: Well, just about everything of course, you know. They had been totally cut off from the\nworld. They obviously wanted to ri -- wanted to know what -- what wa -- what had hap -- what\nwas happening to my brothers, and they wanted -- wanted to know about all the other relatives,\nmy mother\u2019s sisters, and my -- my fathers relatives. You know, we\u2019re family oriented family.\nAnd they had a -- they -- they were amazed that I was an officer. Of course they couldn\u2019t\nrecognize British ranks. They were amazed that I was a paratrooper. They had no idea what wa --\nall these insignia meant. And were absolutely in-incredible. And they want -- want -- and to --\nthey told a lot about their experiences, and what had happened, and in the camp on the -- then\nthey eventually were joined by other people who wanted to know what was happening in\nHolland. They were living in what was called the Dutch colony of the Terezin camp. You may\nhave heard about the group of young girls, [indecipherable] young girls, who were in Terezin.\nMy mother was very friendly with them because ya -- ha -- eventually was -- was going to be\nIsrael. And these -- a lot of these girls came to congratulate my mother, you know, and all that.\nMainly they wanted to know what had happened. They had no idea about the Normandy\ninvasion, only vaguely what -- what had happened there. They didn\u2019t know about the total\ndestruction in Germany, they couldn\u2019t believe it. I -- you know, I -- I -- I -- Ij -- I-- I -- I told my\nfather -- he -- he had one [indecipherable] he said, \u201cWe can never get r-revenge for this, because\nwe can\u2019t be that cruel.\u201d So I said to him, \u201cThe revenge has been, it\u2019s finished. It\u2019s not what we\nwanted, but this is ha -- this is what happened.\u201d And I tell him -- told him, in -- there is not a\nsingle -- in Muenster, which was the capital of our county, there is not a single house standing\nany more between this boulevard and that boulevard. It\u2019s like telling you, look there\u2019s not a\nsingle house standing any more between -- between 72\" Street, and -- and city hall in New York.\nEverything is destroyed. That gave him a concept of -- of how incredible the destruction had\nbeen. When I drove through Muenster, which I had known, through this massive rubble, where --\nbut you know of course the roads had been cleared by American bulldozers, because after all, our\narmies had to get through, all I met was one woman who was crazy, was on -- on -- on a ha -- on\na -- on a -- in black -- in a black dress, with all around was -- that was Germany. That was the\nrevenge. I don\u2019t remember what the -- the divisions, the two and a half S.S. divisions that had\nbeen blasted out of the s -- from the sky, and that -- that -- that died for lacks of -- lack of\noxygen. And they were supposed to be counter-attack. That was revenge. Nuremberg trials, none\nof them -- none of us thought of them. The revenge had been. It was -- 1t was the end.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t talk to a lot of people. People who -- whom I talked to were t -- were\nlike the justice of -- The Hague court of justice, who gave me a letter to Princess Julianna. They -\n- they wanted to have some certain practical things solved, like repatriation in -- in a hurry, and\nso on and so forth, which -- which I managed to have a hand in arranging later on. You know, it\nwas -- everybody had his own practical needs, nevermind go-going after things like revenge.\nThis was a -- a concept that people whom I talked to were not concerned with. They wanted to --\nme to take letters back. I must have taken something like 500 letters back, which the wife of a\nfriend of mine gave to the Red Cross in London, because of course I didn\u2019t have a postage stamp\nto send all these things out. So I put them in -- 1n a big parcel, and I got back to my unit in -- in --\nin Holland, and she send them to -- to London, and the wife of my friend took them to the Red\nCross, and they sent them out. And apparently most of them did arrive. [phone ringing]",
        "A: Well, as I said, they were concerned with practical things like please take a letter for me, and -\n- or do this and this and this for us. One guy came along, and he said, I own two factories in\nGermany in the Zarund, which 1s not very far from our -- my home, Borken, and I want you to be\nthe -- the manager of these two plants, because if you can come here and win, it\u2019s everything.\nAnd I told him, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not out of the army yet, you know? It\u2019s a long time pi -- we still have\na long war ahead of us.\u201d So people weren\u2019t -- the discussions were not -- not in any of these\nabstract subjects, they were very, very practical. Told them that in -- in Holland you had to pay a\ngilder, which is, you know, a lot of money, for just one potato, but the starvation was like in\nHolland, it -- 1t was occupied by the Germans, not in [indecipherable]. And th-those were the\nthings people were interested in, the practical things.",
        "A: No. They -- they -- they had not known that they -- did not know that there was such a thing\nas a Jewish brigade, again. They thought it was of -- they -- a lot of them felt 1t was sort of\nnatural. We were in England, so we -- we -- we -- we did the fighting. As Peter Maas has once\nsaid, \u201c\u201cWe were the em-embodiment of all their dreams.\u201d",
        "A: Yes. I think so, yes. I th -- I think it was -- some of the -- but some of they felt that they -- all\nright, this -- this is what you ha -- has to do, thank God you did it. We didn\u2019t have the chance to\ndo it.",
        "A: Well, they roughly told me what had happened to them when they were in hiding, and how\nthey had been -- how they were picked up, and they -- they went into this camp in Holland, in\nthis concentration camp, and they had a chance to -- my mother absolutely refused to let herself\nbe shipped out until she [indecipherable] forced to ship out. My father wanted to stay with a\ncertain group, but my mother thank God, refused, because that group went straight to Auschwitz\nto be gassed. And they -- my father had this letter, which he was hiding in his af -- artificial leg,\nwhere he were -- his deeds were acknowledged by the organization of the League of German\nWar Widows, Orphans and sa -- Injured People from World War One. He had a letter from them\nthat was written in 1934, thanking him for his fantastic service. [indecipherable] in view of the\ntime, you know, she has to give up that job. And se -- he -- he made the most out of this letter, to\nget himself promoted just in these -- these camps. The -- the fact that he kept his diary, which I\nhave in here by the way, he did -- didn\u2019t tell me at the time, but -- so there\u2019s something that was\ninteresting, and it came out later. Well, they -- they tried to -- they -- they tried to tell me -- th-the\nworst part for them had been these transports from one camp to the other. They had been in this\nDutch camp, and then they had been in Bergen-Belsen, and then after that they were shipped to\nTerezin, and it was this -- these long voyages on these horrible trains, on these cattle trains with\nthe S.S. in one of those, and -- and they were real -- that was a real horrible experience for them.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Well, as -- as -- we -- we talked until about three or four o\u2019clock in the morning, and then we\ndecided to [indecipherable] myself down in someplace or the other, and decided to catch a little\nbit of sleep before it got daylight again. We had -- I had gone to the commandant of the camp --\nration commandant, and just to -- I don\u2019t know, can\u2019t remember what the motive was, but he was\nvery, very -- very, very friendly, and he -- but he also said, \u201cLook, you cannot stay here. By\ntomorrow morning, 10 o\u2019clock, you have got to be out of here, otherwise you\u2019re going to be\ninfected, and I can\u2019t let you -- can\u2019t let you go back to your own army.\u201d But he was very, very,\nvery friendly. Very warm feeling. His ti -- the mayor was very -- doctor [indecipherable] lady\ndoctor who speak -- spoke fluent German, or Russian. She did the translating. Thi -- thi -- that\nwas it. He [indecipherable] and I reported to him. I said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve come to look for my\nparents,\u201d he -- he wou -- turns to the lady doctor and said, \u201cHere, how -- how do we find his\nparents for him?\u201d And then she said [indecipherable] in the meantime already he was very\nconcerned about it. Very, very friendly atmosphere.",
        "A: I was absolutely settled not doing that, it was far too dangerous. The roads were dangerous.\nPeople threw hand grenades, fired shots, did all sorts of crazy things. Quite apart from that, I felt\nI had a duty to pick up as many American and British soldiers as I could. In the end when we --\nin the end when we crossed the American lines, the Jeep -- we had 18 people on the Jeep. Si --\nthe ex-prisoner of war, Americans and British, who -- who wants to get back and absolutely\nsettled on making it. Some of them were in very, very bad shape, too. And we managed to get\nthem across, and get them onto the buses to go to the Nuremberg airport for repatriation to\nEngland. Returned to England.",
        "A: Yes, yes. They did not have any of the contagious diseases, so I had been spared that. People\nwho had these diseases were in what they called the -- the [indecipherable] the -- the castle.\nListen, I\u2019ve got to [indecipherable] now.",
        "A: Okay. So, I left, I picked up all these [indecipherable] of wars, went back into the American\nlines, and then th-the generals from these two and a half German divisions, which I had met in\nthe Sudeten mountains came into the American lines, and the American com -- local American\ncommander asked me to come with him to make these people surrender to the Russians, because\nthey had fought the Russians and therefore had to surrender to the Russians, that was the\nagreement we had. That\u2019s -- every German division surrenders to those whom they -- whom they\nhave been fighting. So the Americans could not accept their surrender, wouldn\u2019t accept their\nsurrender. So we returned them to the Russians. Now, so we eventually got back to my unit, and\nit\u2019s in the south of Holland, and I na -- went to see Princess Julianna, who was in ch -- chas --\ncharge of repatriation, and I gave her the letter, which the justice of [indecipherable] court had\ngiven me, and she said she wants to talk to me, but I didn\u2019t have a chance to do that. That\u2019s it --\nlater on, because by the time my unit moved on to Germany, and nobody to this day believes that\n-- believes me, but the first town we moved into was my hometown, and I had absolutely nothing\nto do with it, nothing. Nobody will believe this. What an experience. And there we actually -- we\nwere -- we weren\u2019t even the occupation force. The idea was for us to be equipped with new\nweapons to get ready for the invasion of Japan. So it wa -- it -- it was of course was incredible\nexperience to be right there in that town. We confiscated the best houses in town, to which Jews\nwould never have even been invited before Hitler, and -- [phone ringing] -- Yeah that -- that was\nquite -- quite an experience, to be back, out of all places, in my hometown. Well, I just don\u2019t\nwant to get into all the details, but actually [indecipherable] were -- my last job in the army was\nto be the deputy intelligence officer of a 12,000 people camp, 10,000 men, 2,000 women of high\nranking Nazis, largely preparing for the Nuremberg trials. A very interesting experience, from\nevery point of view, which I have rarely told anybody about, because even in Germany today,\npeople do not like some of the things that their relatives experienced while being in this camp,\nnot -- not that in my opinion they didn\u2019t deserve them, but this is what it was.",
        "A: Well, you know, people were held in these camps, and -- who were -- who had been say of\n[indecipherable] of my hometown had been a guy who -- I only learned about this afterwards,\nactually -- who -- who had been a judge in Poland. You know, that\u2019s an automatic arrest\ncategory. Somebody goes to the judge, German judge in Poland, can you imagine that? And, you\nknow, you j -- obviously we were -- w-we prepared a case like that, we pec -- practically\ncondemned the guy to death already. He di -- that\u2019s not what they did to him in Nuremberg, but\nthey di -- they did get, you know, like the long sentences. So somehow or the other, I think\nthere\u2019s still too many Germans around who, if they know it at all about what went on at that\ntime, think that a lot of these things are very unfair. And they still cannot imagine all the crimes\nthat were committed in -- by say a guy who was a judge in Poland.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Well, again, we had a job to do. Th-The British had a very good system of\nmaking us filling in certain questionnaire interrogating people. I filled in all the questionnaire\nwith a typewriter, because I typed on a German typewriter quite well in those days. And I -- I -- I\nhad no pity on any of these people. Most of them really deserved it. We had Mr. Armeyer from\nAuschwitz, and you know, he had been a commandant of the -- of Auschwitz for a while. And I\ndon\u2019t think before too long, I thought, hey, he was a common criminal, who was in prison with\nHitler. Hitler was in prison in the 20\u2019s. He was in prison for murder. And so, you know, he stuck\nto his Nazi regime, that\u2019s how -- how he made his career. We had 500 high ranking German\nofficers, who had spent their time in Norway during the war, who wouldn\u2019t believe all these\nstories that were being circulated around about concentration camp. So we made up a\n[indecipherable] I give them a lecture on what happens in Auschwitz. He describes it in great\ndetail, of how people came in, were -- were -- were -- were put into these so-called showers,\nwhich were of course the gas showers. [indecipherable] and we told [indecipherable] who was --\nthank God was stupid enough to believe that, that you know, he had got nothing to fear, because\nafter all, he only followed orders. And he described all this to these 500 high ranking German\nofficers. And these guys were stunned. Th-They don\u2019t -- there\u2019s a film, \u201cJudgment at\nNuremberg,\u201d where some -- something similar is being done. But you know, we did it. Ours was\nnot fiction.",
        "A: To whom?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know what -- what you mean by resentment. What about y -- I -- I felt that these\nguys had to be brought to justice, you know. That we had -- had a to -- a totally different subject.\nWe had a major investigation of the attempt on Hitler\u2019s life in -- in -- when was it, in -- in June\n1944 -- July 1944? Was -- was after the invasion, wasn\u2019t it? Was it -- yeah, yeah, it was in July,\nso it must have been in July 1944, do you remember that?\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: I wa -- while I was -- the short time I was an -- actually a military [indecipherable], I -- of\ncourse I met a lot of ordinary Germans, and it -- I didn\u2019t have any prejudice against them. I was\nwilling to judge people on the basis of who they -- what they were, and who they were. It was the\n-- | -- we were go -- gotten quite friendly, I mean not friendly from the point of view of\nfraternization, but ma -- with s -- with some of the Germans who were obviously had been -- not\nbeen [indecipherable] Nazis, and who were constructive. We had to work for them. Certainly in\nmilitary government we did. Then, of course, they made the rule, very wisely, that no extra --\nextra Jew, or extra [indecipherable] could be in military government. It would be a very good\nidea if the United States had the same rule for Iraq now. It -- it -- it just 1s -- became -- was a bit\nof a shock that we had to leave military government, one day to the other, but I think it was an\nextremely wise decision. They wanted to show the military how -- the British authorities and\nAmerican authorities wanted to show -- no, I think it\u2019s only the British who did this, they wanted\nto show that they had confidence in the political leaders who were coming up wer -- like\nAdenauer and Schumacher, who were now coming up in Germany, and that they would not be\nsidetracked by anybody who had been -- who had left the country and who had not gone through\nthe same experience as these political leaders had gone through.",

At that time I was 24 years old, and wa -- in -- from\none day to the other I changed my name back, I didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t [indecipherable] to Manfred\nGans from Fred Gray, and I was discharged on a Saturday night, and on Sunday morning I\nstarted studying for my entrance examination for the university, which I -- you know I had of\ncourse been back in England once or twice on -- on leave, and I tried to make arrangements for\ngetting into university. Now I wanted to go for chemical engineering because I -- there was a\ngovernment grant for se -- ex-servicemen, and now all these things that I had thought were not\npossible before the war, were now possible. The results of getting these -- what we -- you c-call\nin this country, G.I. grants.",
        "A: Well, you know, my parents, of course died in the meantime.

I ca -- and you know they lived in Israel until they died. My father died\nwa -- he was 95, so -- yeah, in ni -- 1980 he died. So they lived a -- a very full life in Israel. Very\nfull, very good life. Course they -- you know, th-they had pensions, and -- and the restitution\nfrom Germany, my father fought like blazes for all those things, and he knew how to do it. So\nthey had a pretty good life.",

        "A: Well it -- you know, par -- part of it I had written before. I had written it for my niece in\nIsrael, the one who drew your -- your attention to my story. When she was doing -- she was\ngoing in for a master degree, and she felt that all she had to do was to translate my -- my holo --\nmy tere -- Terezin story, that will be enough. But the authorities didn\u2019t let her get away with that,\nso she had to pose a large number of questions to me, and I answered those. And a lot of it came\nout as such at that time. I -- you know, it [indecipherable] about -- must have been in 2002 or so\n[inaudible], about 2002 sometime, I started to write, sitting down and writing things up on the\ncomputer.

        "A: Oh yeah, yes. It\u2019s ver -- ver -- th -- the main -- as I said, the main -- main hardship is not\nrecounting all the experience, but realizing what terrible risks we took. We were so\ninexperienced in the -- in the fighting stage, in the beginning. We learned pretty fast, I suppose,\nbut we -- we did things that were crazy, that -- that we would never have done if we had been\nmore experienced. That -- that part of it gave me nightmares, re-realizing how -- what -- what\nwrong steps we took.",
        "A: Well, I -- I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t think so, but I mean, these were very special experiences I have\nwritten up, and th-they -- you know, I recall them. If I was to recall all the experience I\u2019ve had in\nmy professional life, I don\u2019t think it would be quite that experience, but I\u2019ve had a very, very\nadventurous career in my professional life, too, and maybe if I sit down -- would -- would have\nsat down a year or two ago, and shud -- conjured up some of those experience again, 1t would\nhave been -- would -- they would have come back. But you know, you start concentrating, and as\nyou know, of course, these were very unique experiences. And so the -- Peter Maas\u2019s book has\nbeen quite an ex -- quite a motivation for it.",

        "A: To find my parents? When I wrote up the story? The night I came back from the trip. I wrote\nthis whole story 1n one night.",
        "A: Because I wanted to inform all my friends of what I had -- what I had done. I didn\u2019t think that\nwas a historical document. Luckily, the guy who typed it up, who was in -- with my -- who had\nalso been in the unit already on D-Day, he said this is a historical document, I want to keep a\ncopy of it. So I wrote it up, and it took him about four or five days before he finished the typing\nof it all. And I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve given you one of the originals. I -- I can ge -- probably get a\ncopy of one of the originals, the way it was originally typed up. It\u2019s -- one of them is in Terezin,\nmy cousin deposited it in Terezin on one of their trips, the or -- original type, what this guy did.\nOf course, has mistakes in it. This one you have in there 1s -- which was done on a computer by\nmy secretary is -- 1s more correct.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, it\u2019s hard for -- it\u2019s hard for non-technical people to realize that, but the fact of the\nmatter is that I\u2019ve had a few -- if -- if -- as I\u2019ve done, if you put a large chemical plant on line,\nwith a new process, new, untried equipment, and all that sort of thing, the -- the experience is\nmore telling than almost anything I\u2019d done in the war. As I said in one of the comparison, on the\nnight of the fifth or sixth of June 1944, we landed in fra -- landed in Normandy, 1944, in the\nnight of the fifth and sixth of June 1957, I put a high pressure, or elevated pressure chlorination\nplant on line in -- in southern France, and I sweated more blood in 1957 than I did in 1944. But\nit\u2019s very hard for non-technical people to realize what 1s involved in the invention, development,\ndesign and start-up -- a commercialization start-up of a chemical process. That -- that\u2019s one -- on\naspect of it. So there have been very -- a lot of very interesting experiences. The highlight of my\nprofessional career, I suppose, was my giving a lecture in the University of Hanoi in 1986, to a\ntotally hostile -- hostile audience, trying to persuade them to give up doing basic research, when\nthey should do applied research, and you know, as I -- as I said, they were totally hostile, not\nwilling to listen. I -- as I said, in one state I was in the University of Hanoi lecturing 13 years\nbefore Mr. Clinton did so, and the atmosphere was still very different then. But --",
        "A: Yes, regularly.",
        "A: Regularly. Oh that\u2019s a very interesting experience, very worthwhile. In 1988, on the\nanniversary -- or was it the -- the 50\" anniversary of Kristallnacht, they invited us back from my\nhometown, and we, the Jews, or a lot of us came back. My two brothers came from Israel with\ntheir wives. Everybody could bring one companion, my wife came along. And we -- I made a\ncondition for coming back, we made that we were going to be allowed to lecture in the schools.\nAnd the people were so enthused about what we did, that they kept on inviting us again and\nagain. I\u2019ve been there almost every second year, my younger brother, while he was alive, he s --\nhe died in the meantime, he went there back every year to lecture, and it was a very worthwhile\nexperience. I insisted on not only lecturing on my war experience, and the Holocaust and all that,\nbut also on Judaism, and the basic concepts of Judaism, which went down extremely well. It\u2019s a\ngreat privilege to do that.",
        "A: Oh very. Extremely receptive. They -- well, of course it depended a little bit as to who the\nteacher was. If there was a teacher that had prepared them for this, they were very much more\n[indecipherable] than if it was just somebody who let us cu-cut in. But this was a very\nworthwhile experience. And as I said, they paid for it. They gave us all expenses. I\u2019ve written up\na lot about these experiences. Unfortunately I have not [indecipherable] but when the BBC\nthought of making a film about my life, they wanted to incorporate this into their -- into that film.\nAnd no -- and just -- and th-they -- they, in fact they asked me, think you can get us some non --\nex-Nazis, who have not -- non -- what do -- ho-how do you call it, non-regenerated? The wa -- y-\nyou know? I said I can, yes I can. I know we -- we can produce it. It\u2019s still there. So --",
        "A: I did, I enjoyed it very much, after the first experience. My wife in the -- the first time -- she\nonly went along once, she was very apprehensive about it, very apprehensive. She somewhat\nfrightened, but maybe she was already coming down with the sickness at the time. So --",
        "A: Well, when my parents left 1t became Gestapo headquarters. And they even had a torture\nchamber in our wine cellar. And then it was taken over by the mili -- British military government\nas the headquarters for the district. This was when I came back there, only two days after -- after\nthe town has been liberated, the advance people were just mo -- moving in. It stayed that way for\nawhile, and after that they sold it, or they -- it was handed over to the German police. It became\npolice headquarters in the town for a little while, not very long. And then it went back into\nprivate possession. At the moment it\u2019s largely -- there are four lawyers in it, I think it\u2019s\n[indecipherable] their offices in there.",
        "A: Yes, of course, Bochholderstrasse 48.",
        "A: Yeah, can talk for a few more volumes if you want to.",
        "A: I want to tell you one other little story that\u2019s very interesting. You know, when I was in --\npreparing these, we were in the zenolager, with high ranking Nazis who had to investigate the\nattempt on Hitler\u2019s life, inter -- interviewing some of these generals, you know? And I was\nasking them exactly what they went through in order to get into a conference with Hitler. These\nguys were hardly searched at all. It -- unbelievable, you know? I -- so I took all this down, and\ndidn\u2019t say anything, didn\u2019t say anything [indecipherable]. And I said -- said to one of those guys.\n\u201cYou goddamn idiots. You were not willing to take the risks which we on the -- soldiers on the\nfield had to take. It would have been so easy of you to -- for you to take out a pistol and shoot\nthis guy, and pilt -- ge -- get rid of him, and get rid of the war, and all that sort of thing. And if\nyou -- you -- after all, you had free access to him.\u201d So the guy said, \u201cBut captain, in view of\nField Marshall Sbaten, the spine becomes rubber.\u201d I -- I [indecipherable] understand. That\u2019s all --\nall they wanted to be, get a field Marshall, become a field Marshall.",
