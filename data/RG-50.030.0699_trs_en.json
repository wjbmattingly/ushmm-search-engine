        "Q: For the Middle Ages, unheard of.",
        "A: Unheard of. Unheard of even during the later ages. So Poland was an open\ncountry.

And returned to France when NapoleonMay 8, 2013\nwas gone already.

And so that was one of these tragic events in the history. BecauseMay 8, 2013\nthere is a big gap 1n his history, which I suspect that is \u2014 not to mention anywhere,\nbecause it for \u2014 afraiding \u2014 yeah, they were afraid of talking about this, after the\n[indecipherable] in \u00b069, or something like that.",

        "Q: Oh, wow.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 who did not have any special education. In fact, the World War I prevented her\nfrom finishing her high school even, because as a French family, they were\nevacuated from \u2014 from Poland to Moscow.",

But th-the French\ncitizens who were evacuated to Moscow stayed there until \u201916 \u2014 1916 - 717, but\nthen the revolution erupted in Russia, and they were again evacuated through theMay 8, 2013\n[indecipherable] the northern sea, to France. And they came back to Poland in\n1919. That\u2019s where my father met my mother.",

And so I was born in \u2014 under that period, but, you know, few years\nlater, it \u2014 the tragedy struck, and my mother, against wi-wi \u2014 advice of everybody;\nfamily and friends, and acquaintances well placed here and there, decided that she\nwill run the business herself. So she began to work alone as a worker in her own\nestablishment. From all the stages of production, you know, from the lowest\n[indecipherable] and afternoon she was sitting on \u2014 behind my father\u2019s desk, with\nthe accountant and business manager, and was learning how to run a business.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Tell me, how did the war \u2014 how did you learn about the war happening? That is,\nwhen it happened, the day that it happened, where were you?",

And one day in April \u201939, we were gathered in the auditorium where we used\nto have a theater productions and so forth, there was a lo \u2014 radio and the\nloudspeakers connected, and we heard the announcement of the foreign minister\nfrom the Polish parliament, the same refusal of accept Hitler\u2019s request to give in to\nthe \u2014 to German reg \u2014 demand of some \u2014 some territorial \u2014 and we were, of course,\ncheering in support, but this teacher told us, boys, you don\u2019t know what is going to\nhappen, but everything is not going well. So you can cheer, and \u2014 so w-we \u2014 we had\nthe sense that somebody warned us, of course not \u2014 so we \u2014 the vacation came later,\nin \u2014 on June or July, and we had the great time during vacation.

Please step in, we have food, we\ncan wash and so forth. So we went to this corner, kind of a wine cellar, under the\narcades of very beautiful, gorgeous, historic city square.

And he gave us \u2014 went to wash, and you know, and \u2014 and\nsomehow, after all night of driving, and there was a discussion, it\u2019s in the book,\nabout my stepfather and \u2014 and him, he was inquiring, what \u2014 what does \u2014 what is\nhappening, what is happening? I don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t have any paper, no papers,\nnothing, no radio. Well, we think that we were escaping because the Germans are\nbehind us, you know. And \u2014 and \u2014 and then, when we were leaving, after you know,\nrefreshments and food, he didn\u2019t want to accept any money. He brought a bottle of\nTawki(ph) which is an old, old musty, you know, dry \u2014 de \u2014 an ancient bottle. He\nsays, this is the oldest bottle I have in my wi-wi \u2014 cellar. Will you be kind enough to\ndrink with me this, you know? So we drank, too. And he says, remember me\nalways. And he didn\u2019t want to leave. He said, look, this is ordained by the God, and\nI cannot change what has been ordained, so to stay, to go, it doesn\u2019t matter. It is\ngoing to happen, something, so I have to g \u2014 and \u2014 and he refused to \u2014 to go, you\nknow, that\u2019s ju \u2014 that\u2019s another, this little jewel of \u2014 of the \u2014 of the count \u2014 of the\ndiscussions, like that, with people, threatened, obviously, or maybe they did \u2014 were\nnot fully aware of what is going to happen, but \u2014",

        "A: I am fully aware of that, and I made the drawing the next day of that \u2014 of that\nrestaurant, on that corner, yes.",
        "Q: And did he tell you his name?",
        "A: Festendik(ph), that was his name.",
        "Q: Oh, that was his name.",

So \u2014 so we went there. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you meet any o \u2014 did you meet up with any armies at all, any soldiers at all?",
        "A: Well, th-this is the situation, that at one point we \u2014 w-we \u2014 we stayed in a \u2014 in \u2014\nin a little manor house, or farm of some Germans, who were there for generations,\nliving in \u2014 close to the Slovak border already, or Romanian border. And\n[indecipherable] and \u2014 and then we \u2014 we \u2014 we repaired old cars, and things like\nthat. I was making drawings of all these activities, and \u2014 and then Mr. Byger(ph)\nsaid don\u2019t worry, d-don\u2019t worry. Here I am German, if the Germans come, I will tell\nthem that you are my family, so nobody will happen to you, nothing will \u2014\neverything will be all right.

And we were\nsort of waiting couple days, deciding what to do, then suddenly two policemen\ncame on the bicycle, you know, they came and they started talk to the driver of one\nof the cars, we were two cars, and the other family had a s \u2014 a chauffeur. So it was a\nkind of a luxury escape.",

So the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the chauffeur came running, said, they want to \u2014 they came to req \u2014\nrequisition the cars. So di\u2014 so why did they go ba \u2014 I told them I need something on\npaper [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So this was the Russians who came?",
        "A: No, the Polish a \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 with a stamp. So they \u2014 they went on the bicycles to \u2014 to bring this paper, and\nwe packed and left, and that was the only thing to do.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And as we arrived 0-on a\u2014 on a boat there, we were joi \u2014 we joined actually a \u2014\na big column of the air push \u2014 air force maintenance crews 1n trucks. And among\nthis passengers there in the trucks were pilots, who were telling that they lost all the\nplanes already. They were fighting as long as they could, but no new planes arrived,May 8, 2013\nso wi \u2014 they were told to evacuate to Romania, because the French are flying the\nplanes to Romania. Again, naivet\u00e9. So they lost all the \u2014 that \u2014 but these pilots were\nwith us, finally we\u2019ve crossed the border when somebody came on a motorcycle\ndressed half in the uniform, half in civilian. And he said, the Bolsheviks are over\nthere, 10 kilometers from here. I escaped. The Bolsheviks? So, then the commotion,\nand the Romanians opened the border, and we crossed.",
        "Q: So, until that point, they wouldn\u2019t have done it?",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "Q: Until that point, they would not have \u2014",
        "A: I wa \u2014 no, because they\u2019re the bo \u2014 this was like s \u2014 a small border crossing, not\nused by many.",

        "Q: Instructions.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, yeah. And so we were standing in front of that barrier, and the whole\ncolumn, couple hundred trucks, full of equipment, mechanics, and pilots. And this\nis \u2014 was the beginning of the Polish air force, in France and in England.",
        "Q: Really?May 8, 2013",
        "A: Which counted 15,000 men eventually, in England, 15,000. That\u2019s what the\nRoyal Air Force museum wanted to know, ho-how did you manage to get 15,000\nPolish pilots in England in \u00b043 - \u201944?",
        "Q: And it was \u2014",
        "A: While the French only had 300? I said, ask the French.",
        "Q: And they \u2014 it was because they were able to cross the border at that time?",
        "A: Because \u2014 because this was the only \u2014 the only segment of the Polish armed\nforces who could \u2014 who was most precious, because they were very well trained,\nwith experience in fights during that two weeks of war, three weeks. And they were\nimmediately formed into squadrons in France, when they got from Romania. The\nRomanians closed their eyes, looked the other way, and they all went by train,\nthrough Yugoslavia and Italy, which was neutral still, to France. And some wents\nto the Middle East. And later, an \u2014 a year later, I followed to the Middle East.",
        "Q: So tell me, what happened to you, and your stepfather and whoever you were\nwith in the small group?",
        "A: Well, after fi \u2014 few exciting days, meeting with the Jewish family, in the little\ntown of Falticeni, where they had this \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",

        "A: \u2014 after crossing the border. And \u2014 and of course the \u2014 the grownups started to\nlook \u2014 walk, and ask for someplace to stay. And there was a little \u2014 a young man\nwalking alongside, and \u2014 and talking something to \u2014 to them, in broken French. So\nthey said, no, no, no, they didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, thought he was\nbegging, or something. But he was persistent, he was foreign, and they couldn\u2019t find\nany \u2014 anyplace. A hotel? Never \u2014 never heard of a hotel in Falticeni. And he was\nsaying \u2014 so they finally followed him, and he ca \u2014 they know that he was the son of\nthe owner of a beautiful, sort of bourgeois villa, with all these paintings, you know,\nall the naked not \u2014 nymphs bathing in the streams, you know, flowers, you know,\nthick gilded frames, crystal chandel \u2014 chandeliers.",
        "Q: In the middle of such chaos and war.",
        "A: Yes. And he \u2014 in this Falticeni, a very rich, local Jewish family gives us this\nshelter because they son found us, and he considered that this is honor to do this,\nand duty. And then they found it \u2014 we found this black woman housekeeper, who\nlooked like Mammy.",
        "Q: Looked like who?",
        "A: Mammy, from the \u201cGone With the Wind.\u201d",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: Just later she seemed \u2014 that\u2019s the analogy you make, okay. And \u2014 and what \u2014",
        "A: After a few \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 like to know, what did you \u2014 what kind \u2014 do you remember what you talked\nabout with this man, and this family?",
        "A: No.",

        "A: No, I don\u2019t re \u2014 I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And frankly, I \u2014 I was so excited about this adventure, because there \u2014 there was\nvery nice \u2014 nice girl with us in that group, you know, from \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, really?",
        "A: Yeah, which we found \u2014 I mean, Lwow, you know, friends. So, in other words,\nnot the \u2014 the issue. So, we \u2014 we reached Bucharest finally.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And now, remind me, was anything happening in Romania, or was\nRomania quiet, and on the side, and politically not involved, not [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, Romania was in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n close alliance with Poland, that they will\nget help, and \u2014 and fight together, and the invasion come, and so on. NothingMay 8, 2013\nhappened over there, absolutely nothing. They \u2014 and they were in deep trouble.\nAlthough they were living very well. Romania was rich with oil. The Ploiesti oil\nfields, which we crossed, were pumping oil all the time, and that\u2019s why Germans\nfinally occupied Romania, to get their oil. And Bucharest was amazing city, much\nmore \u2014 maybe not that historical, but much more beautiful than Warsaw, frankly. It\nwas planned very well, it had the Arc of Triumph on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the big\nsquare, like in Paris, you know, big avenues full of trees and st \u2014 1-1t was \u2014 it was\nvery elegant, the Royal Palace, and all that. But later, when \u2014 when \u2014 when we\nstayed there, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the fascist school came.",
        "Q: So how long were you in wa \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] I went to school there.",
        "Q: Oh, so tell me again, give me a sense, how long did you stay in Romania in\ntotal?",
        "A: We traveled a little bit, back and forth, but part of our group left for France.\nThey got visas. We were 1n contact with my uncles who lived in France then, my\nmother\u2019s brothers. And they were both in the ar \u2014 French army, but they were\nwriting very, very dramatic letters. They said th-the French do not want to fight. So\nI \u2014I don\u2019t know what to advise you, frankly. It doesn\u2019t look good here, so why\ndon\u2019t you stay in Romania? And about New Year\u2019s day, 1940, we finally received\nMay 8, 2013\npost cards from my mother, from Warsaw, saying, you know, with all this German\nstans \u2014 censorship and so forth, very vague about [indecipherable] said, we are\nfine, I hope you are too. Let \u2014 let\u2019s wait til spring, you know, this type of saying\nstay there, do not come back. So we knew a little bit, but that was the last contact\nwe had with my family until five and a half years later. There was no \u2014 no \u2014 no way\nto com \u2014 communicate. So we stayed. My father got involved with some kind of\nintelligence work, with some Armenians from Lwow, I believe, who had contacts\nwith the \u2014 with the Soviet s-sphere of \u2014 so I believe that they were working on a \u2014\nwhat\u2019s happening after the Germans invaded, or occupied Romania actually, after\nthe fascist school, and what was happening in the Soviet zone, and they were\ncontacting this Polish government in \u2014 in \u2014 in Paris, and then in London. There\nwas a ki-kind of network of spies, and Polish had \u2014 government had a very well-\nestablished network there. So a friend of ours, who was one of those people before\nthe war, engaged my stepfather into this and some other people; I was kind of\nwitnessing these gatherings, were always very funny, very fancy, who dressed\naround. But that was the cover of some meetings, which later, after the war, my\nstepfather told me that this was a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Ah, so he told you after the war \u2014",
        "A: YeahMay 8, 2013",
        "Q: \u2014 about what these were.",
        "A: \u2014 I met him in France, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But if he \u2014 because he stayed, he didn\u2019t return to Poland, because he \u2014 because\nof his past, he was also in the inter \u2014 military intelligence in \u2014 in Italy, where the\nPolish army came from the Middle East, yes.",
        "Q: So you even started going to school there?",
        "A: And then I \u2014 then we d \u2014 he discovered that there is a public school being formed\nin Bucharest, and that\u2019s where I went, because I still had two years to go before the\n\u2014 th-the end. So I went to this school, a-and the teachers were mostly people who\nknew something about some subjects, not a prof \u2014 professional teachers. There were\nno books and things, but there was mostly by memory. But I did my second cl \u2014 my\n\u2014 my first \u2014 my \u2014 my class of [indecipherable] which it was \u2014 and \u2014 and then we\nhad to flee the Germans when they came, so we were es \u2014 escaped.",
        "Q: Give me a sense of dates, if you can.",

        "Q: So, you know, in some ways in your telling it, I \u2014 I have the impression that\nthere is all this war, there is this chaos, there is this fear, and yet, at the same point,\nyou\u2019re a teenager, and you\u2019re growing up.",
        "A: Exactly. Exactly, exactly, you are right. This is what I want to tell people now\n[indecipherable] it was not only blood and sweat and suffering, but it was normal\nlife. And it was so much more precious, because it was happening in terrible times.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But you cannot suppress \u2014 I mean, the \u2014 the force of life. And probably it\nhappened everywhere, even in the camps. Very human, humorous situations, and\npeople pick up on that, and love and enjoy, even if they suffering. But there are\ndecent moments when they suddenly say, why not?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We can laugh also. It will help, or not, but this is our nature. And not \u2014 that\u2019s\nwhat was happening. We escaped finally from Romania, through Turkey, and we\nended up in Palestine.",

        "Q: So, if your stepfather was involved, does he \u2014 would he \u2014 did he have some extra\ninformation?",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he had \u2014 it was all organized for us, but it was \u2014 it could not have been\norganized for everybody who was with us, because we left Constanta, which is a\nport on the red \u2014 Black Sea, in luxury, on a \u2014 a cruise ship, Transylvania. And\nthere were about 600 people there, all Polish refugees. And we met many of them\nwhom we knew from Bucharest, from caf\u00e9s, from streets, from cinemas, and so\nforth. So, I \u2014I still say this is one story that is not explored how this was organized,\nthis whole evacuation. Somebody bought the whole ship, and \u2014 and we didn\u2019t have\nany money. We were living in a very luxurious apartment, yes, with the Otis\nelevators, electric then, and they had the Mercury car, Ford, waiting for us on the\nby \u2014 you know, because \u2014 because of my stepfather\u2019s environment he \u2014 he lived in.\nAnd I was going to school there. But who provide this? Who provide it, who\norganized this? Who gave us a word, get packed immediately, and move to this\nMay 8, 2013\nsmall hotel. Here is a address. Huh? Where we moved, you know? And few days\nagain, six 0\u2019clock in the morning on the station, and somebody gives a bag, and in\nthe bag are tickets for this express train to \u2014 to the ports. Who organized? And then\nI find 600 people on that \u2014 on the boat. I made lot of sketches in my notebooks, of\nthese evacuees. It\u2019s a caricatures I was drawing you know, what they were doing,\nyou know. Sitting in the bar, vomiting across the deck. Watching sun \u2014 sunsets, you\nknow, on the Black Sea. And we ended up in Constantinople, in Istanbul. Again,\nevacuation, a boat across the Bosporus. A villa on \u2014 on the shore of \u2014 Sea of\nMarmara. Lots of people here \u2014 here and there. And then one day, again notice\neverybody to the station, railroad station on the Asiatic shore. Tickets for the \u2014 for\nthe cars, and we go, 24 hours across Turkey to the southern port of Mersin. Two\nweeks there, again, sitting on the beach, eating oranges from the trees, a novelty.\nWaiting, waiting, waiting, suddenly a ship comes, and \u2014 and is anchored on the\n[indecipherable]. So everybody is parked, okay, here, on this hour, in the dock,\nbarges take us to the ship. As we aboard the ship it says, Polish flag, is says\nMarshaba(ph), the name of the ship. One of the merchant ships who was, at the\nbeginning of the war, serving the eastern Mediterranean. So it was organized that\nit will take the \u2014 the \u2014 the refugee somewhere. And there is this story that one of\nthis crew was telling us how he remembers the evacuation of \u2014 escape of Jews in \u2014\nMay 8, 2013\nin \u2014 in old, worn out boats, who were unworthy of \u2014 not sea \u2014 to go into sea. So\nthey were just sailing toward Palestine, and their crew was abandoning, so they \u2014\nthey became victims of a accident, and as a \u2014 survivors of sea, they had to be\naccepted by the British, with \u2014 that was how they were going around the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nBritish blockade, for Jews to go to Palestine.",
        "Q: And this is what year?",
        "A: That was \u00b040 - \u00b041. Well, I read about this on the second day of the war, about\nthis story, about this ship who \u2014 two ships, actually, beached on the f\u2014 on Tel Aviv.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and \u2014 and on your own [indecipherable] you met with one of the people\nwho\u2019d been the crew, on the crew.",
        "A: No, not the crew, but they knew about this story, because they were \u2014 they were\nserving the \u2014 they were sh \u2014 serving eastern Mediterranean.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And that became a known story.",

        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah. That\u2019s very strange.",
        "A: Well, because this might have arrived few days before.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",

        "A: \u2014 no information ready to print about the fact that the war was already on.",
        "Q: So you were on this ship and then you \u2014 you \u2014 do you \u2014 how do you get to\nPalestine? What is the procedure?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we thought that we are going to Cyprus from \u2014 from Turkey.\nThe \u2014 us \u2014 the joke was we are going to the British concentration camp for the\nPolish refugees. But it was next morning when we woke up, we were in Haifa\nsuddenly, not Cyprus, Haifa. And that\u2019s where we were unloaded from the ship.",
        "Q: What did you see when you were unloaded? What \u2014 what was the vision in front\nof you? Sounds like you were an artistic person who \u2014 who saw \u2014 you know.May 8, 2013",
        "A: You know, it was Haifa, it was not the Haifa of today, but 1t was a small town. I\nremember the green hill, which was called Carmel(ph), huh? And there was an\neastern Orthodox cathedral on top of that. I remember the white towers. And then \u2014\nand \u2014 and the British military police directing us how to go to a wooden barrack, or\nsomething like that, you know? And I don\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any papers, I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: But something \u2014 something must have been organized. But this is, to me, a big\nmystery how this was organ \u2014 it was beautifully organized, everything. Every day \u2014",
        "Q: And what was the purpose for \u2014 what was the purpose of this organization to\nevacuate \u2014",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "Q: \u2014 these particular refugees to Palestine? Did you ever figure \u2014",
        "A: I have no idea, but because there were many refugees who had the families, and\nthere were some Jewish families, like the Wolfgangs [indecipherable] from\nLwow. I mean, Juleg(ph) Wolfgang is now in \u2014 in \u2014 it was a class below me,\nbecause my whole school from bu \u2014 Budape \u2014 Bucharest was found in Tel Aviv,\nrecreated, with better teachers, because we found a lot of Jewish teachers from\nMay 8, 2013\nbefore the war in Poland, who couldn\u2019t find a job, and were no \u2014 the one was\nCecilia Hubber(ph), who was teaching us Polish literature from memory.",

And we\nwere going somewhere, I don\u2019t know, there were some buses or something, I don\u2019t\nknow, because we ended up in some kind of small hotel, I remember. And \u2014 but\nbefore we reached this transportation, means of transportation, we were surrounded\nby the people who lived there, the Jews, who had a heartbreaking moment, because\nthey came and they held photographs of people, of their relatives from \u2014 from\nbefore the war, and the names of towns from which they\u2019re came before the war, as\nimmigrants to Palestine. And they were trying to show and ask whether anybodyMay 8, 2013\nknows about \u2014 about these people, whom they left behind when they emigrated.\nAnd of course, this was a\u2014 so moving.",

But\nwe quickly \u2014 I remember my stepfather found this friend who was in the\nintelligence before the war, who \u2014 they worked together on \u2014 in \u2014 in Bucharest.\nAnd he was already in new uniform, because in Palestine there was a PolishMay 8, 2013\nbrigade, Polish independent brigade, about 4,000 men, who crossed over from\nSyria. They were in \u2014 in that first wave of immigration and distribution of the army\nmen, immediately, to France, to \u2014 to England. And when France stopped\naccepting because they did not want to fight a war, really. So they send these people\nfrom the Balkans to Syria, which was under the French protectorate at that time,\nLebanon and Syria. And the brigade was formed from all these army types over\nthere in allet \u2014 in Homs, where you hear the name now, Homs, in Syria, one of the\ntowns which is now being bombarded. And that\u2019s where the brigade was formed.\nAnd when the [indecipherable] collapsed, the French wanted to disarm them. And\nthere was a confrontation between the French general, and the Polish general,\ncommander of the brigade, who said, if you touch any \u2014 any of our guns which we\nhave, we will fight. And with the \u2014 for the first time in the history that the French \u2014\nthat the Poles will fight the French. But we will fight and win. And they decided to\n\u2014 to move everyth \u2014 with every equipment they had, they \u2014 to move to Palestine.\nAnd they went through the Golan Heights, through the \u2014 through the Sea of\nGalilee. So this is how they were, and of course they were a-accepted with open\narms by the British, who did not have anything in the Middle East, anything\nsubstantial. There were 60,000 British forces from Palestine, all the way to Kenya.\nThe British empire. And mostly of them were colonial troops, or Indian troops. So\nMay 8, 2013\nhere is something that comes about 5,000 Poles, with officers, everybody trained,\nand so on, you know, ki \u2014",
        "Q: And motivated.",
        "A: \u2014 and motivated. No other country 1-1n occupied Europe every organized this\ntype of a evacuation formation of large number of troops, which ended up about \u2014\nover 200,000 at the end of the war, of Polish troops in that navy, paratroopers and\n15 squadrons of the air force, all \u2014 all branches, from bombers to fighters.",

So we were \u2014 we \u2014 we approach the ship, it was like\nthat, like a skyscraper, what is \u2014 Queen Mary, which was completely empty,\nbecause this Queen Mary brought 10,000 Scottish troops for General Montgomery\nfor this offensive, and it was going back empty. So what about this Italian rifles?\nBecause you have 1400 German prisoners which you took in Libya. You have to\nescort them. Where? Don\u2019t ask questions. No questions answered, yeah. And we\nhad 1400 young boys like ourselves, from the Rommel army. Germans. And you\nknow, and they were down on the \u2014 at the bottom of the ship, on the third class. We\nwere occupying second class, where they removed only the beds, and put the, you\nknow, bunks, so more people can sleep. And that was the luxurious trip on board of\nQueen Mary.",
        "Q: Did you have any interaction with them?",
        "A: Well, s-some, because we went to south a \u2014 through south Africa, and then\nacross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro. And we didn\u2019t know why, but three of them\nescaped from the ship in the Rio de Janeiro, and they were caught on the beach by\nthe Brazilian police, and they were brought back. So, there were some rough\nmoments when one of the \u2014 our sergeant, who was fluent in German, interrogated\nMay 8, 2013\nthem, and so forth, you know. And it turn out that one of the crew \u2014 they were\nmostly Australians, must have given them a big wrench, so they can \u2014 they opened\nthe screws of the \u2014",
        "Q: Portholes.",
        "A: \u2014 portholes, yes, which were screwed in. So that was a first. But then, from Rio\nd\u2019aneiro(ph), we went along the af \u2014 Americas coast, to New York. We didn\u2019t\nknow where are we going, it was all secret, but we ended up in New York. And we\nunloaded the Germans here, and \u2014 on the lower Hudson, on Jersey City, again in\nbarges. And on those barges, when we were sailing with the \u2014 our segment of the\nprisoners, now we began to \u2014 to smile at each other. You know, we were about 19 -\n20, all a \u2014 both sides. So they had some piece of paper, they wanted an autograph,\nand I had some photographs, and some drawings that they made, gave \u2014 given to\nme, you know, as a kind of exchange. And we handed them over to the Canadians.\nPut them in the elegant passenger cars, and took them to the prisoners\u2019 camp in \u2014 in\nCanada.",
        "Q: My goodness.",
        "A: And we stayed for two weeks in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in New York, having a ball,\nabsolutely ball. We were the first unit of 300 Polish ar \u2014 uniforms men, for the first\ntime in history, seven officers, one [indecipherable] and \u2014 and we were almost torn\nMay 8, 2013\napart by all these organizations, like that one that took a couple soldiers for this, for\nthis, for dinner, for a dance, and \u2014 and we stayed for just two weeks, and then sailed\non \u2014 on \u2014 in a big convoy, and then I decid \u2014 discovered that there are oh,\nAmericans on these ships. And then we \u2014 we \u2014 when we learned that America is in\nwar. And that was summer of \u201942.",
        "Q: America was in the war \u2014",
        "A: Since December 41.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: When \u2014 when \u2014 when we entered Tobruk, the officer told me, by the way,\nAmerica was attacked by the Japanese somewhere, the Pacific, and America will\njoin the war, hooray. And that was it. And then secrets. Nobody, no newspapers,\nnothing, until New York, where I found out that America is in the war, because 11\nhuge ships were taking troops to \u2014 to England.",
        "Q: Now, amongst the recruits that were with you, were any of those original Polish-\nJewish young men also part of this?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure they were, yeah. Now \u2014 now, there were 50 of us from the officers\u2019\ntraining school, who were with the di \u2014 high school diplomas \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.May 8, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 selected, okay? Fifty. And we were from the brigade, we were from the Libyan\nfront. Two hundred-fifty were those who came from Russia in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u00b041, after\nthe General Sikorski and Stalin made a deal that Poland will help, if you release\nthe prisoners. That was before Katyn was discovered. But this young guys were\nfrom \u2014 from \u2014 mostly from gulags and from prisoner camps. A-And we started to\ntalk to them on that fantastic journey from Rio de Janeiro to New York, you know,\nacross the equator and to Tropics of Cancer, and \u2014",
        "Q: And what were they telling you?",
        "A: Oh, they were telling about Russia. About there \u2014 with the \u2014 for \u2014 for the first\ntime, because they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they came out of Russia. Soviet Union.",
        "Q: What were the things that you found most memorable?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: What were the things that they were telling you, that you found the most\nmemorable?",
        "A: Well, they were t-telling horrendous stories of life in \u2014 in \u2014 in the camps. A-A-\nAnd \u2014 and \u2014 and the miracle of them being released at one point. That was a deal\nbetween \u2014 between Polish government in London, and \u2014 and the Soviets, prodded\nby Churchill, you know. You have come to some conclusion of all these disputes,\nyou know, so 1\u2014 you were very dramatic \u2014 in our may \u2014 in my age no, I was not\nMay 8, 2013\nreally very much understanding the \u2014 th-the \u2014 all this implication, but I was a\nwitness of this.",
        "Q: Well, you know, how could one expect you to?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How could wa \u2014 it\u2019s just that one \u2014 it\u2019s one \u2014 1n your telling it\u2019s one dramatic\nincident after another, without even stopping, you know? And they come over each\nother.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: It\u2019s not like one starts \u2014 one stops and another begins.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Another takes place while the first one\u2019s still going on.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly, exactly.",
        "Q: So, as you\u2019re crossing that boat to go to \u2014 crossing the Atlantic again, and you\nsee there are Americans on the ship, what\u2019s that \u2014 what\u2019s that stage like? What \u2014 is\nthere anything memorable from that crossing?",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he talk \u2014 it took us 15 days. Thi \u2014 this whole sea strip from Suez, via\nsouth Africa, Rio de Janeiro, New York, and this is \u2014 this took six weeks,\ntogether. And that was the only time when I had a little notebook and I was making\nMay 8, 2013\nnotes, and dates, and what happened then. Nothing important, but just as a\nreference. I still have it.",
        "Q: Do you still have the notebook?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. This 1s only the \u2014 the trip, you know, the \u2014 the sea voyage. Well,\nwe were a big sensation for the American troops on that troop carrier, because they\nwere young boys like us, going for the first time to Europe, abroad, you know?\nThey were from Kansas somewhere, from Missouri, you know, soldiers, G.Ls.\nAnd we were sleeping in hammocks because everything was removed to make more\nroom for troops, you know, this \u2014 on these transport ships. And eleven big ships,\nand the escorts, two cruisers and several destroyers, on \u2014 on all sides, cruising all\nhere, you know, watching for the submarines and U-boats. So it was a\n[indecipherable] pleasant, but mostly Americans were telling us, how is it in the\nwar? What do you do? You know? And we didn\u2019t want to talk about the war,\nfrankly, we were enjoying the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the trip. So, you know. But I \u2014 I\nlearn how to jitterbug on that ship. I met many American soldiers who were trying\nto say a prayer in Polish, you know? They remember what their grandmother what\ntold \u2014 told, you know? Terribly moving. Which I \u2014 moving now, but at that time,\nwas ha, ha, ha, you know, make fun.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.May 8, 2013",
        "A: The stars at night, are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas, that\u2019s what I\nlearned that time.",
        "Q: Yeah. When you got \u2014",
        "A: So we ended up in \u2014 in Liverpool.",
        "Q: Okay. [technical interruption, break] Okay, so you\u2019re in Liverpool, you arrive\nin Liverpool.",
        "A: We disembark, I think the first, because th \u2014 I remember Americans on the deck\nwaving back, full of soldiers still. And we went onto the train, which was waiting,\nand well, we were only 300, so there was some \u2014 somebody more than \u2014 than us.\nAnd then we went directly to Scotland, to a camp near [indecipherable], in\nnorthern Scotland, and we stayed there 10 days or something. We soon discovered\nthat every church has a dance hall, and twice a week there were dances at the\nchurch hall, where you could meet a lot of lonely girls. But mostly we were being\ninterviewed. Not us, from the brigade, where we were \u2014 had all our papers and army\nbooks and so forth, but mostly those who came from the Soviet Union. They were\ngrilled again and again, who they are. Later, later, after the war I discover\n[indecipherable] you don\u2019t know why, because the \u2014 the \u2014 the army intelligence\nwanted to know who these people really are. There was no time to interview them\nin \u2014 in Persia, or in Iraq, when they came, you know, from the Soviet Union, nor\nMay 8, 2013\nin Palestine. So they were sort of quickly selected who wanted to go, so they were\non the boat, and came. But the \u2014 the army wanted know exactly who they are, like \u2014\nlike you are asking me now. Where they came from, the addresses and \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 father \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and mother and so forth, you know, for security. Because there was already a\nwe \u2014 awareness that many, many Soviet agents could be smuggled this way.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So, they already knew that. So we stayed there, and then finally they \u2014 we were\nseparated into various arms forces, units that we volunteered for. Those for the air\nforce, those for the navy, those for the parachute brigades, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and we\nparted in different places of \u2014 and that\u2019s where I begun about almost a year and a\nhalf training in various, as it was called, stations of \u2014 of the air force. It was all\nmanned by the Polish ar \u2014 air force already, all instructors, all teachers. Except the\nteachers of English were \u2014 were Polish people. And then it \u2014 it \u2014 it took us about\nthat time to \u2014 to reach the \u2014 the \u2014 the level where we could be transferred to \u2014 to the\n\u2014 to the front.",
        "Q: So here\u2019s a question.May 8, 2013",
        "A: It was just after the D-Day.",
        "Q: So here\u2019s a question: do you think any of your trainers at the \u2014 during this year\nand a half were people you first might have met at the Romanian border, as you\nwere fleeing Poland?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: It was such a mixture of \u2014 of people, mixing all the time. But I always had very\ngood friends, and one of my best friends was a Ludwig Gutmeier(ph), speaking\nabout the Jewish people, who was with me from \u2014 from the time the brig \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nknow him at the time we were in \u2014 in Libya. We met on the boat, actually, in that\ngroup. And he was a son of a \u2014 of Aba(ph) Gutmeier(ph), a very well-known art\ndealer, and collector of Polish art, maybe better than this, in Warsaw. And he had a\nsister, whom he adored, he had a picture of \u2014 of her sister, was showing. And he\nescaped Warsaw during the, actually, German siege and bombardment, which\nmeans about 10 days after me. How he managed to \u2014 to escape, I don\u2019t know.\nBecause frankly, we never talked about this. Never. The discussions were about\ntoday, right now, and what we are going to do tomorrow. But never \u2014 never\nreminiscences, something \u2014",
        "Q: It was not that kind of time.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: No, nobody \u2014 nobody was interested, frankly. What are we talking? What are we\ngoing to do tomorrow? Have another beer. You know, this was \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s the lesson, but \u2014 which I learn only recently, when I started to write this \u2014 this\n\u2014 this \u2014 this books, this memoirs, were 50 years after the war when I started.",
        "Q: Why? Why did it take so long?",
        "A: I never \u2014 I was never interested in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in\u2014 while I was collecting all the\nphotographs, all the drawings of all these wanderings after the war \u2014 I saved\neverything, without even thinking about it. It was only the first Polish book, there\nwere three books, these are condensed three books here. It was printed in Poland in\n2003, and I probably started this writing about 2000, year 2000.",
        "Q: Yeah, 55 years after the war.",
        "A: And nobody ask me anything, and I don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t ask anybody after the war,\nand I came to the d\u2014 completely destroyed city, Warsaw, and we\u2019re planning how\nto spend the night \u2014 dancing night, you know? But nothing about \u2014 nobody told me\nabout the horrors of they went through, uprisings, and so on, the destruction,\nprisoner camps. Nobody. So this Ludwig Gutmeier(ph) was this very good friend,\nand he was with me on this first preliminary stages of tra \u2014 air force training, but at\none \u2014 one point, he said ah, you know, it takes so long. I want to \u2014 I want to \u2014 I\nwant to bomb the Germans. Said, how you going to do it? He said, well, I\u2014 you\nMay 8, 2013\nknow what? There is a \u2014 there is a special they call the bomber. On the \u2014 on the big\nbombers, there is a guy who looks at the target and pushes the button. I want to be\nthat guy. So he left area, because that was much more shorter training. And I met\nLudwig after the war, in Paris, where we spent a very exciting time. And in 1961,\nwhen I came on the Ford Foundation visit to America, on my second day in New\nYork, I met him face to face on Madison Avenue here. Yeah.",
        "Q: Amazing. Amazing. So, what were you trained for, and what was your job on the\nplane?",
        "A: I was pilot, fighter pilot. Which means, I was alone. My job was everything. And\nI was trained to be a speed fighter pilot. And I was posted soon after the D-Day to a\nPolish wing which consisted of three squadrons, 36 planes in France, on a field trip\n\u2014 airstrip. And we were in so-called tek \u2014 tactical air force, which means we were\nsupporting the ground troops. If you saw \u201cPrivate Ryan,\u201d there is a \u2014 there is a shot\nwhere airplanes are flying very low over this loop of Americans who are trying to \u2014\nto \u2014 to escape the encirclement. Well, that\u2019s what we were doing. Air support to the\nground troops, and \u2014 and bombing from the dive \u2014 dive bombing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So \u2014 and from time to time there was an air contact, but the Germans were very\nfew and \u2014 and sparse in those days, because the Luftwaffe was already \u2014 had theMay 8, 2013\nbroken back, during the Battle of Britain, and following years. Last October, I was\nin Washington, I was asked by the museum of the RAF in London to be a keynote\nspeaker on a yearly gala they have in Washington, in Willard Hotel, which is the \u2014\nthe luxury hotel, you know, on Pennsylvania Avenue. They have a yearly banquet\n\u2014 gala banquet for the f-foundation a \u2014 foun \u2014 American foundation of the Battle of\nBritain, where they are collecting money to build a monument at the museum in\nLondon to the pilots who fought the Battle of Britain, in 1940 - \u201941. And this was a\n\u2014a-\u2014a-\u2014a-\u2014adinner devoted to the role of the Polish fighter pilots, who actually, as\nmy friend Steve, air chief marshal Sir Steven Dalton, who sat next to me in all this\ngala, gilded things and medals, the commander of the Royal Air Force of today,\nsaid that, it is little known, but had it not been for those 120 Polish fighter pilots\nwho came to England in 1940, those who were emi \u2014",
        "Q: At the border.",
        "A: \u2014 at the border, whom I ma \u2014 who were shipped immediately to England and\nFrance, and later to England, we would not win this battle, he said, because our\nnumbers were dwindling. We had pilots after 15 hours in the plane, sent to this\nquadrant to fight the Luftwaffe.",
        "Q: Oh my gosh. That\u2019s nothing.",
        "A: It\u2019s nothing. So they were shot down like ducks, you know.May 8, 2013",
        "Q: Like chickens, yeah.",
        "A: And \u2014 and so the air chief marshal, and \u2014 then \u2014 and I was the keynote speaker\nfor that event. So that\u2019s like the coronation of this whole \u2014 my wartime events,\nwhich happened 50 \u2014 55 years later.",
        "Q: How many missions did you fly?",
        "A: Hundred.",
        "Q: A hundred?",
        "A: Yeah, just hundred, yes.",
        "Q: And do you \u2014 over what territories?",
        "A: Well, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany. And we were three squadrons,\n302, 308, my squadron, and 317, where I had this friend, this Jewish pilot,\nKazik(ph) Becker(ph). There is the photograph of him, and he had this name of his\nsister chalked on his cowling, you know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I had couple more Jewish pilots, yes. Th-Th-They were in every squadron, there\nwas Jewish and like that.",
        "Q: What was your last bombing mission?",
        "A: Last bombing mission, we\u2019re preparing for \u2014 the Polish armored division,\nbecause we are supporting the army on the ground, right? So, in the British sector,May 8, 2013\nthere were Canadian force, and \u2014 and British, moving on the northern front.\nAmericans were further south. And the Polish armored division, the tanks, arrived\nat Wilhelmshaven, which is the main base of the German Kriegsmarine.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Built in \u2014 in imperial time, and \u2014 and it was the \u2014 we were prepared to support\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the attack of this British armored division on Wilhelmshaven, which\nalready surrounded by the Polish army. When I made my hundredth, and that was\nthe end of my tour \u2014 the tour was 50, that was my second tour. So you would \u2014 you\ndon\u2019t fly tomorrow. Pack up, you can go. You have tickets and all that. And I was\nvery happy. But then, th-the next few days, they started this bombardment, and \u2014\nand it \u2014 and it \u2014 the war ended soon after that [indecipherable]. So \u2014 but \u2014 but \u2014 but\nthe capitulation of Wilhelmshaven was accepted by the Polish kal \u2014 kalner(ph) of\n\u2014 of the arms division.",
        "Q: That must have been satisfying.",
        "A: And this is an amazing coincidence because the war started in Gdansk, by the\nbombardment by Schleswig-Holstein, the German battleship of the Polish outpost\nin Gdansk called Westerplatte, with W. And the war ended Wilhelmshaven with\nthe Polish troops bombarding the Wilhelmshaven. An [indecipherable]\ncoincidence.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "Q: How did you \u2014 so that happened in April \u201945?",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 I was \u2014 I left this quadrant in April, and they were still flying\ntil they \u2014 til the first days of May, when the armistice was. And from \u2014 by that time,\nI was in Paris already, with my uncle.",
        "Q: So here \u2014 here\u2019s another question. Of those hundred mission \u2014 hundred missions,\nwere there any that you felt more in danger than in others, or were each \u2014 all of\nthem equally alike?",
        "A: Well, th-the \u2014 there were not all, because you know, sometimes you were going\non a patrol, very high up, escorting American bombers, the flying fortresses, few\ntimes. But most of the real danger was because we were coming down on German\npositions, which were very heavily defended by the anti-aircraft guns and machine\nguns. And when you were coming down there, everybody was shooting at you. So it\nwas touch and go. And sometimes we are flying two and three missions every day.",
        "Q: My gosh.",
        "A: Because we were very close, you know, it lasted one hour. You took off, one\nhour you were over the [indecipherable], you bomb, you \u2014 you come down, you \u2014\nyou shoot, and you come back. So it was \u2014 it was a lot of the sum \u2014 you were \u2014\nfound bullets in the fuselage. A couple friends were killed sa \u2014 many were killed\nbecause they landed in the fog, or something like that, you know.May 8, 2013",
        "Q: When the war started, you had had one year of Jesuit school, which knocked you\ninto shape after \u2014 after having been a troubled teenager, and when the war ended,\nyou were \u2014 you were a fighter pilot with a hundred missions under your belt. Were\nyou the same person? How had the war changed you?",
        "A: No much. No, but in between, I had two years of the refugee schools in\nBucharest and Tel Aviv.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Which were a salvation, because since that time, I did not read a single book\nduring the war. There was no way. I read some English books when I learned. But\naft \u2014 when I arrived in Warsaw after the war, and wanted to join the school of\narchitecture, I was accepted without any tests, or anything. But my \u2014 my level of\neducation was zero, I must tell you frankly, zero. Because I did not have full cycle\nof education like normal school. So I\u2014I-\u2014Is-\u2014I suppose I learned myself.",
        "Q: But as a person, you say you\u2019d \u2014 your \u2014 as a person you didn\u2019t feel like you had\nchanged much?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t feel that I have. I didn\u2019t, no, honestly.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. I asked the question, that\u2019s the answer, that\u2019s fine.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, I know. I don\u2019t think I changed, no.",
        "Q: Okay.May 8, 2013",
        "A: I\u2014I learned a lot, I suppose, about the world, about how people behave in\ndifferent situations. I had my opinion how to behave, which started in Bucharest\nwith saving these two Jewish girls. It was like nothing, but it is \u2014 1t made an imprint\nin me.",
        "Q: For you it was a significant threshold.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I was so happy later, that we did this, what we did. And they run away, so you\nknow \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: So when you met your stepfather in Paris, afterwards, is this the time when he\ntold you what he was involved with?",

        "Answer: All right.",
        "A: My name is pronounced Jerzy Glowezewski, that\u2019s in Polish. In English,\nGlowczewski, to make it easier. And I was born in November 19, 1922, so 1am\nover 90 now. And probably what we discussed with you is that I\u2019m one of the last\nliving witnesses, not to the Holocaust, but to the times of the Holocaust, as\nwitnessed by many of us who had to escape, occupation of Poland was by the\nGermans and the Soviets \u2014 Soviets. And we found ourselves in different parts of the\nworld.",
        "A: Well, my father\u2019s name was Kazimierz Glowczewski, or Casimir in \u2014 in\nEnglish. And he was from an old family who was probably a landed gentry\nsometime in the 18\" century, our area. And they found themselves also refugees in\n\u2014 in the 1770s, to Warsaw, when the part of the country in which they lived, which\nis Pomerania on the Baltic shore, was taken over by the Prussians. And that was\nthe beginning of the big, tragic Polish history, was through stupidity of the rulers\nand of the ruling classes, they run into the situation where the Poland was divided.\nIt was once a very \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 flourishing Polish-Lithuanian kingdom, very large, enormous amounts of\nterritory, from the Baltic to the Black Sea almost, which was a magnet for many\nforeigners who were written down as refugees or immigrants. Because Poland had\na unique in \u2014 in the European history, system of elected kings, and \u2014 and the\nparliament.",
        "A: Unheard of. Unheard of even during the later ages. So Poland was an open\ncountry. I always compare it to America, although 300 years later, but 1t was aMay 8, 2013\ncountry of immigrants. We had many, many nationalities, and foreigners as far from\nSweden, Scotland, Spain, tracking down, looking for freedom of location to live,\neducation, religion, and \u2014 and speech. It was \u2014 but that also requires some kind of\nrules.",
        "A: And they \u2014 the \u2014 they were so e-e-enchanted with the freedom that they forgot\nthat there are rules also, they have to contribute something to thi-this country. So\nthey did not pay taxes, for instance, they did not care about the army. So the Polish-\nLithuanian army was minimal, in \u2014 compared to the neighboring countries like \u2014",
        "A: Eighteen \u2014 na \u2014 Russia. But this is why so many people were displaced during\nthe \u2014 and my family was one of those, on my father\u2019s side. On my mother\u2019s side,\nentirely different story. My grand-grandfather was a Napoleonic officer \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 who went to Moscow with the Polish-Lithuanian army, to occupy Moscow.\nAnd they did, but then they were defeated by frost, and again quarrels among them.\nSo they retreated. My \u2014 my great-gran \u2014 grandfather was wounded on the present\nBelarusian border, and was saved by some people who lived in a \u2014 in a landed\nmanor. Landed gentry in mano \u2014 manner. And returned to France when NapoleonMay 8, 2013\nwas gone already. And he was so di-disenchanted with the re \u2014 resurgence of the\nroyal family in France, that he returned back to Poland where he met all the other\npeople who were also some kind of revolutionaries, too.",

        "A: In Warsaw, our house and our apartment survived the uprising and the war.",
        "A: Oh yes. So that\u2019s why I return after the war.",

        "A: Yes?",
        "A: We \u2014 we had a\u2014 we \u2014 my parents met soon after \u2014 I think right in \u201921, soon after\nthe big celebration after the \u2014 the victory of the \u2014 the Bolshevik war.",
        "A: Against the Bolsheviks, yes. And my father \u2014 I have a \u2014 photographs of him in\nthe uniform, on a horse, but \u2014 but I think he was released quickly, because he\ninherited from my grandfather, a big lithography and \u2014 and painting works, one of\nthe biggest in Warsaw, who specializes in painting, scientific albums \u2014",
        "A: Artistic lithography of Wladislaw(ph) Glowezewski.",
        "A: My grandfather.",
        "A: Was born in 1843, and I suspect that he was fighting 1n this 60 \u2014 in 1860s in this\n\u2014 one of these crazy insurrections, where the Polish-Lithuanian area a \u2014 gentry\nactually arose against the tsarist, you know, with pistols and sabers against the\nRussian army. And so that was one of these tragic events in the history. BecauseMay 8, 2013\nthere is a big gap 1n his history, which I suspect that is \u2014 not to mention anywhere,\nbecause it for \u2014 afraiding \u2014 yeah, they were afraid of talking about this, after the\n[indecipherable] in \u00b069, or something like that.",
        "A: But I saw his photographs in some kind of a patriotic, you know, uniforms and\nthing. So \u2014 so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s this part of the story, but \u2014 so my father\nactually inh \u2014 inherited all this business, very \u2014 one of the most well-noted painting\nworks, and, after the World War I, and he met my French mother, because all\n[indecipherable] were French citizens from Napoleonic times.",
        "A: But all the women who married lo \u2014 lost their French citizenship. So men\nmaintained this. So, I have this French connection, which was our life, until\nrecently.",

        "A: Childhood?",
        "A: Well, there were two phases. One was extreme pleasantness, and ease, and well-\nbeing, after the World War I, because of my father\u2019s ability to run this business\nexpanded. But unfortunately, he was killed in a car accident on September 1\u201c, 1929,\n10 years before the war was \u2014 the second war.",
        "A: I was a boy, seven years old, and of course, I barely survived this crash.",
        "A: Yes, I was in the car. And so, hard times arrived soon after, because next month\nafter this accident, the Wall Street went bust in New York. And since my father\nhad many, many business connections and plans and \u2014 and ec \u2014 of expansion, that\nloans, bank loans, property bought on credit and all that, collapsed with the \u2014 with\nthe crash in New York; worldwide, grand dep-depression descended. And here is\nreally a\u2014a very interesting, to me at least, the story of my mother \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 who did not have any special education. In fact, the World War I prevented her\nfrom finishing her high school even, because as a French family, they were\nevacuated from \u2014 from Poland to Moscow.",
        "A: Yes, because they were French, and the Germans were coming and occupying\nthe Russian held territories in 1915.",
        "A: Until they \u2014 they stopped confronting the Russian army, and what they decided\nthat, let\u2019s not fight any more, let\u2019s make a revolution everywhere. But th-the French\ncitizens who were evacuated to Moscow stayed there until \u201916 \u2014 1916 - 717, but\nthen the revolution erupted in Russia, and they were again evacuated through theMay 8, 2013\n[indecipherable] the northern sea, to France. And they came back to Poland in\n1919. That\u2019s where my father met my mother.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, she \u2014 she was a very beautiful young woman, surrounded always by elegant\nmen. And they returned to Warsaw in 1919-20, and met my father and began a\nvery happy life. And so I was born in \u2014 under that period, but, you know, few years\nlater, it \u2014 the tragedy struck, and my mother, against wi-wi \u2014 advice of everybody;\nfamily and friends, and acquaintances well placed here and there, decided that she\nwill run the business herself. So she began to work alone as a worker in her own\nestablishment. From all the stages of production, you know, from the lowest\n[indecipherable] and afternoon she was sitting on \u2014 behind my father\u2019s desk, with\nthe accountant and business manager, and was learning how to run a business.",
        "A: Amazing.",
        "A: And I have all that documented in the photographs, what my father was taking,\nwhich my mother was taking, and beginning in 1973, which I was taking. All these\nalbums survived the war, and are here \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on 66\" Street.",
        "A: Well, she pulled out an \u2014 an amazing feat of courage and \u2014 and goodwill from\npeople around, she saved the business, and actually established a very prosperous\nlife, and married for the second time in \u201937, when she \u2014 when she was sure that\neverything was going to work well.

And so, when he married\nin 30 s \u2014 \u00b037, in \u201938, they \u2014 me and my brother were kicked out of the house, we\nwent to a Jesuit boarding school, which was \u2014",

And the rumor was that he was serving in\nthe cavalry in ni \u2014 in \u2014 during the Bolshevik war. And he took part in a \u2014 last\nprobably in the history of mankind, cavalry charge between the Polish cavalry and\nthe Marshal Budyonny cavalry of \u2014",

        "A: I think \u2014 I think several thousands \u2014 thousands of cavalry was involved on both\nsides. So \u2014 so he was very much aware of the dangers of the war, and he, during his\nhistory classes was explaining to us what the present situation and \u2014 and \u2014 may\nbring. And one day in April \u201939, we were gathered in the auditorium where we used\nto have a theater productions and so forth, there was a lo \u2014 radio and the\nloudspeakers connected, and we heard the announcement of the foreign minister\nfrom the Polish parliament, the same refusal of accept Hitler\u2019s request to give in to\nthe \u2014 to German reg \u2014 demand of some \u2014 some territorial \u2014 and we were, of course,\ncheering in support, but this teacher told us, boys, you don\u2019t know what is going to\nhappen, but everything is not going well. So you can cheer, and \u2014 so w-we \u2014 we had\nthe sense that somebody warned us, of course not \u2014 so we \u2014 the vacation came later,\nin \u2014 on June or July, and we had the great time during vacation. And \u2014 and then\nsuddenly we were called back from the vacation on the \u2014 on the Baltic, on the\nbeaches, we were there, by \u2014 by somebody send a car with a driver, return\nimmediately and so forth. And \u2014 and as we were driving back, somebody bought a\nnewspaper and there it was, and I thi \u2014 this is \u2014 this is the date I know, it was\nAugust 234, \u201939, where there was a big news that the Hitler made a pact with the\nMay 8, 2013\nSoviet Union that there will be no war between them.

        "A: Somewhere between Wilno and Lwow, on that border, since Soviets are not\ngoing to interfere, and the new units will be formed there. And we need more\nvolunteers and so forth. So, we parked \u2014 unfortun \u2014 fortunately we had our cars, and\nwe parked this \u2014 and some friends, you know, and cavalcade of motorcars, full of\nmen. We left Warsaw at night. The roads were jammed, and my mother didn\u2019t\nwant to go, and my \u2014 she kept \u2014 my brother was 14.

Most of them were later\ncaught by the Soviets and deported to Siberia.",

The people who have cars, all the tax1 \u2014 taxi should help to bring\ndead people from the street, col \u2014 you know, this type of horror stories. We had no,\nabsolutely no contact with the family. And then \u2014 then the Germans came very\nclose, and they actually surrounded Lwow, so the gentleman in charge of our group\ndecided we have to move out quickly, because tomorrow the German will encircle\nthe \u2014 the city, and it will be it. So we left at three o\u2019clock in the morning \u2014",
        "A: Oh, we \u2014 we asked Schiffman(ph), of course, to join us, he said no way, we are\nnot moving. Nothing is going to happen. That\u2019s \u2014 of course, they perished in the\nHolocaust, but \u2014 but this was \u2014 this is my memories of these people, who are \u2014",

        "A: Before to Lwow, before, yes.",
        "A: Who?",
        "A: Oh yeah, well, we stopped on the markets square, which was actually empty. I\ndon\u2019t know, maybe refugees were going the other way. Yes, because we diverted\nfrom the main track where everybody was moving. We diverted to another place,\nwe had somebody to leave over there on the road, one of my uncles. And we were\nlook around, and then came a little Jewish boy with the \u2014 with the \u2014 with \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 side curls, yes, and \u2014 and had the white apron, and \u2014 and \u2014 and he said,\ngentlemen, can I\u2014 you need \u2014 you need some help. Please step in, we have food, we\ncan wash and so forth. So we went to this corner, kind of a wine cellar, under the\narcades of very beautiful, gorgeous, historic city square. And I remember the \u2014 the\nname was called Festendik(ph) in the Polish letters.",
        "A: Ye-Yeah, Festendik(ph) is \u2014 and as we entered there, we saw the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the boss, you know, with the long beard and \u2014 and \u2014 and he said welcome,May 8, 2013\nwelcome, sit down. And he gave us \u2014 went to wash, and you know, and \u2014 and\nsomehow, after all night of driving, and there was a discussion, it\u2019s in the book,\nabout my stepfather and \u2014 and him, he was inquiring, what \u2014 what does \u2014 what is\nhappening, what is happening? I don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t have any paper, no papers,\nnothing, no radio. Well, we think that we were escaping because the Germans are\nbehind us, you know. And \u2014 and \u2014 and then, when we were leaving, after you know,\nrefreshments and food, he didn\u2019t want to accept any money. He brought a bottle of\nTawki(ph) which is an old, old musty, you know, dry \u2014 de \u2014 an ancient bottle. He\nsays, this is the oldest bottle I have in my wi-wi \u2014 cellar. Will you be kind enough to\ndrink with me this, you know? So we drank, too. And he says, remember me\nalways. And he didn\u2019t want to leave. He said, look, this is ordained by the God, and\nI cannot change what has been ordained, so to stay, to go, it doesn\u2019t matter. It is\ngoing to happen, something, so I have to g \u2014 and \u2014 and he refused to \u2014 to go, you\nknow, that\u2019s ju \u2014 that\u2019s another, this little jewel of \u2014 of the \u2014 of the count \u2014 of the\ndiscussions, like that, with people, threatened, obviously, or maybe they did \u2014 were\nnot fully aware of what is going to happen, but \u2014",

        "A: The clever one.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, and then \u2014 then the only \u2014 the on \u2014 I was \u2014 I mean, they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 the\ngrownups were deciding where to \u2014 we have to head for \u2014 for the Romanian border,\nbecause there\u2019s nowhere to go.",
        "A: I mean, other people going to go \u2014 going to Lithuania because it\u2019s safer, and it \u2014\nno, no, it \u2014 too \u2014 too far away, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re too different dist \u2014 a great distance to\n\u2014 to go back around the eastern border, and so on. So \u2014 so we went there. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, th-this is the situation, that at one point we \u2014 w-we \u2014 we stayed in a \u2014 in \u2014\nin a little manor house, or farm of some Germans, who were there for generations,\nliving in \u2014 close to the Slovak border already, or Romanian border. And\n[indecipherable] and \u2014 and then we \u2014 we \u2014 we repaired old cars, and things like\nthat. I was making drawings of all these activities, and \u2014 and then Mr. Byger(ph)\nsaid don\u2019t worry, d-don\u2019t worry. Here I am German, if the Germans come, I will tell\nthem that you are my family, so nobody will happen to you, nothing will \u2014\neverything will be all right.

        "A: \u2014 of being \u2014 I tell them that you are my family, no \u2014 no problem. And we were\nsort of waiting couple days, deciding what to do, then suddenly two policemen\ncame on the bicycle, you know, they came and they started talk to the driver of one\nof the cars, we were two cars, and the other family had a s \u2014 a chauffeur. So it was a\nkind of a luxury escape.",
        "A: Yes, and the \u2014 and the \u2014 and they talk and they talked, and then they left. So the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the chauffeur came running, said, they want to \u2014 they came to req \u2014\nrequisition the cars. So di\u2014 so why did they go ba \u2014 I told them I need something on\npaper [indecipherable]",

        "A: \u2014 you have to bring me something on \u2014 on paper \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with a stamp. So they \u2014 they went on the bicycles to \u2014 to bring this paper, and\nwe packed and left, and that was the only thing to do.",

And among\nthis passengers there in the trucks were pilots, who were telling that they lost all the\nplanes already. They were fighting as long as they could, but no new planes arrived,May 8, 2013\nso wi \u2014 they were told to evacuate to Romania, because the French are flying the\nplanes to Romania. Again, naivet\u00e9. So they lost all the \u2014 that \u2014 but these pilots were\nwith us, finally we\u2019ve crossed the border when somebody came on a motorcycle\ndressed half in the uniform, half in civilian. And he said, the Bolsheviks are over\nthere, 10 kilometers from here. I escaped. The Bolsheviks? So, then the commotion,\nand the Romanians opened the border, and we crossed.",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "A: I wa \u2014 no, because they\u2019re the bo \u2014 this was like s \u2014 a small border crossing, not\nused by many.",
        "A: So they didn\u2019t know what to do, and they were waiting for the telephone \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, yeah. And so we were standing in front of that barrier, and the whole\ncolumn, couple hundred trucks, full of equipment, mechanics, and pilots. And this\nis \u2014 was the beginning of the Polish air force, in France and in England.",
        "A: Which counted 15,000 men eventually, in England, 15,000. That\u2019s what the\nRoyal Air Force museum wanted to know, ho-how did you manage to get 15,000\nPolish pilots in England in \u00b043 - \u201944?",

And they were\nimmediately formed into squadrons in France, when they got from Romania. The\nRomanians closed their eyes, looked the other way, and they all went by train,\nthrough Yugoslavia and Italy, which was neutral still, to France. And some wents\nto the Middle East. And later, an \u2014 a year later, I followed to the Middle East.",
        "A: Well, after fi \u2014 few exciting days, meeting with the Jewish family, in the little\ntown of Falticeni, where they had this \u2014",

And there was a little \u2014 a young man\nwalking alongside, and \u2014 and talking something to \u2014 to them, in broken French. So\nthey said, no, no, no, they didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, thought he was\nbegging, or something. But he was persistent, he was foreign, and they couldn\u2019t find\nany \u2014 anyplace. A hotel? Never \u2014 never heard of a hotel in Falticeni. And he was\nsaying \u2014 so they finally followed him, and he ca \u2014 they know that he was the son of\nthe owner of a beautiful, sort of bourgeois villa, with all these paintings, you know,\nall the naked not \u2014 nymphs bathing in the streams, you know, flowers, you know,\nthick gilded frames, crystal chandel \u2014 chandeliers.",

        "A: Yeah, which we found \u2014 I mean, Lwow, you know, friends. So, in other words,\nnot the \u2014 the issue. So, we \u2014 we reached Bucharest finally.",
        "A: Well, Romania was in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 1n close alliance with Poland, that they will\nget help, and \u2014 and fight together, and the invasion come, and so on. NothingMay 8, 2013\nhappened over there, absolutely nothing. They \u2014 and they were in deep trouble.\nAlthough they were living very well. Romania was rich with oil. The Ploiesti oil\nfields, which we crossed, were pumping oil all the time, and that\u2019s why Germans\nfinally occupied Romania, to get their oil. And Bucharest was amazing city, much\nmore \u2014 maybe not that historical, but much more beautiful than Warsaw, frankly. It\nwas planned very well, it had the Arc of Triumph on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the big\nsquare, like in Paris, you know, big avenues full of trees and st \u2014 1-1t was \u2014 it was\nvery elegant, the Royal Palace, and all that. But later, when \u2014 when \u2014 when we\nstayed there, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the fascist school came.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I went to school there.",
        "A: We traveled a little bit, back and forth, but part of our group left for France.\nThey got visas. We were 1n contact with my uncles who lived in France then, my\nmother\u2019s brothers. And they were both in the ar \u2014 French army, but they were\nwriting very, very dramatic letters. They said th-the French do not want to fight. So\nI \u2014I don\u2019t know what to advise you, frankly. It doesn\u2019t look good here, so why\ndon\u2019t you stay in Romania? And about New Year\u2019s day, 1940, we finally received\nMay 8, 2013\npost cards from my mother, from Warsaw, saying, you know, with all this German\nstans \u2014 censorship and so forth, very vague about [indecipherable] said, we are\nfine, I hope you are too. Let \u2014 let\u2019s wait til spring, you know, this type of saying\nstay there, do not come back. So we knew a little bit, but that was the last contact\nwe had with my family until five and a half years later. There was no \u2014 no \u2014 no way\nto com \u2014 communicate. So we stayed. My father got involved with some kind of\nintelligence work, with some Armenians from Lwow, I believe, who had contacts\nwith the \u2014 with the Soviet s-sphere of \u2014 so I believe that they were working on a \u2014\nwhat\u2019s happening after the Germans invaded, or occupied Romania actually, after\nthe fascist school, and what was happening in the Soviet zone, and they were\ncontacting this Polish government in \u2014 in \u2014 in Paris, and then in London. There\nwas a ki-kind of network of spies, and Polish had \u2014 government had a very well-\nestablished network there. So a friend of ours, who was one of those people before\nthe war, engaged my stepfather into this and some other people; I was kind of\nwitnessing these gatherings, were always very funny, very fancy, who dressed\naround. But that was the cover of some meetings, which later, after the war, my\nstepfather told me that this was a [indecipherable]",

And \u2014 and his son, Michael became the king. But he was\nagain \u2014 but he was already degraded in his power, and there was \u2014 the \u2014 the General\nAntonescu, who was the military leader of this coup, and that\u2019s where the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe \u2014 the fascist regime was installed.

        "A: \u2014 passage of a certain threshold, you know, then?",
        "A: Iam a man, and I know what I am going to do. This is good, this is bad \u2014 this is\nbad. So that\u2019s what this \u2014 the moment.",
        "A: Exactly. Exactly, exactly, you are right. This is what I want to tell people now\n[indecipherable] it was not only blood and sweat and suffering, but it was normal\nlife. And it was so much more precious, because it was happening in terrible times.",
        "A: But you cannot suppress \u2014 I mean, the \u2014 the force of life. And probably it\nhappened everywhere, even in the camps. Very human, humorous situations, and\npeople pick up on that, and love and enjoy, even if they suffering. But there are\ndecent moments when they suddenly say, why not?",
        "A: We can laugh also. It will help, or not, but this is our nature. And not \u2014 that\u2019s\nwhat was happening. We escaped finally from Romania, through Turkey, and we\nended up in Palestine.",
        "A: Well, this was a \u2014\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 this was again an organized \u2014 organized de-deportation of the refugees, from\nRomania.",
        "A: By the Polish government 1-in exile. Probably in London by then.",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he had \u2014 it was all organized for us, but it was \u2014 it could not have been\norganized for everybody who was with us, because we left Constanta, which is a\nport on the red \u2014 Black Sea, in luxury, on a \u2014 a cruise ship, Transylvania. And\nthere were about 600 people there, all Polish refugees. And we met many of them\nwhom we knew from Bucharest, from caf\u00e9s, from streets, from cinemas, and so\nforth. So, I \u2014I still say this is one story that is not explored how this was organized,\nthis whole evacuation. Somebody bought the whole ship, and \u2014 and we didn\u2019t have\nany money. We were living in a very luxurious apartment, yes, with the Otis\nelevators, electric then, and they had the Mercury car, Ford, waiting for us on the\nby \u2014 you know, because \u2014 because of my stepfather\u2019s environment he \u2014 he lived in.\nAnd I was going to school there. But who provide this? Who provide it, who\norganized this? Who gave us a word, get packed immediately, and move to this\nMay 8, 2013\nsmall hotel. Here is a address. Huh? Where we moved, you know? And few days\nagain, six 0\u2019clock in the morning on the station, and somebody gives a bag, and in\nthe bag are tickets for this express train to \u2014 to the ports. Who organized? And then\nI find 600 people on that \u2014 on the boat. I made lot of sketches in my notebooks, of\nthese evacuees. It\u2019s a caricatures I was drawing you know, what they were doing,\nyou know. Sitting in the bar, vomiting across the deck. Watching sun \u2014 sunsets, you\nknow, on the Black Sea. And we ended up in Constantinople, in Istanbul. Again,\nevacuation, a boat across the Bosporus. A villa on \u2014 on the shore of \u2014 Sea of\nMarmara. Lots of people here \u2014 here and there. And then one day, again notice\neverybody to the station, railroad station on the Asiatic shore. Tickets for the \u2014 for\nthe cars, and we go, 24 hours across Turkey to the southern port of Mersin. Two\nweeks there, again, sitting on the beach, eating oranges from the trees, a novelty.\nWaiting, waiting, waiting, suddenly a ship comes, and \u2014 and is anchored on the\n[indecipherable]. So everybody is parked, okay, here, on this hour, in the dock,\nbarges take us to the ship. As we aboard the ship it says, Polish flag, is says\nMarshaba(ph), the name of the ship. One of the merchant ships who was, at the\nbeginning of the war, serving the eastern Mediterranean. So it was organized that\nit will take the \u2014 the \u2014 the refugee somewhere. And there is this story that one of\nthis crew was telling us how he remembers the evacuation of \u2014 escape of Jews in \u2014\nMay 8, 2013\nin \u2014 in old, worn out boats, who were unworthy of \u2014 not sea \u2014 to go into sea. So\nthey were just sailing toward Palestine, and their crew was abandoning, so they \u2014\nthey became victims of a accident, and as a \u2014 survivors of sea, they had to be\naccepted by the British, with \u2014 that was how they were going around the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nBritish blockade, for Jews to go to Palestine.",
        "A: That was \u00b040 - \u00b041. Well, I read about this on the second day of the war, about\nthis story, about this ship who \u2014 two ships, actually, beached on the f\u2014 on Tel Aviv.",
        "A: No, not the crew, but they knew about this story, because they were \u2014 they were\nserving the \u2014 they were sh \u2014 serving eastern Mediterranean.",
        "A: And that became a known story.",
        "A: It became known story because they printed it even in Krakow newspaper on\nthe second day of the war.",
        "A: On the newspaper, where there was nothing about the war.May 8, 2013",
        "A: But there was a story about this ship.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, because this might have arrived few days before.",
        "A: And there was no la \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 no information ready to print about the fact that the war was already on.",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we \u2014 we thought that we are going to Cyprus from \u2014 from Turkey.\nThe \u2014 us \u2014 the joke was we are going to the British concentration camp for the\nPolish refugees. But it was next morning when we woke up, we were in Haifa\nsuddenly, not Cyprus, Haifa. And that\u2019s where we were unloaded from the ship.",
        "A: You know, it was Haifa, it was not the Haifa of today, but 1t was a small town. I\nremember the green hill, which was called Carmel(ph), huh? And there was an\neastern Orthodox cathedral on top of that. I remember the white towers. And then \u2014\nand \u2014 and the British military police directing us how to go to a wooden barrack, or\nsomething like that, you know? And I don\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any papers, I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "A: But something \u2014 something must have been organized. But this is, to me, a big\nmystery how this was organ \u2014 it was beautifully organized, everything. Every day \u2014",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: I have no idea, but because there were many refugees who had the families, and\nthere were some Jewish families, like the Wolfgangs [indecipherable] from\nLwow. I mean, Juleg(ph) Wolfgang is now in \u2014 in \u2014 it was a class below me,\nbecause my whole school from bu \u2014 Budape \u2014 Bucharest was found in Tel Aviv,\nrecreated, with better teachers, because we found a lot of Jewish teachers from\nMay 8, 2013\nbefore the war in Poland, who couldn\u2019t find a job, and were no \u2014 the one was\nCecilia Hubber(ph), who was teaching us Polish literature from memory.",
        "A: No books, no books.",
        "A: Yes. Well, Tel Aviv was already sort of a Polish-Jewish community, I mean,\neven the \u2014 the signs above the shops were in Polish. It were \u20141\u2014 I mean, everybody\nspoke Polish, this was it.",
        "A: No, no, no. Absolutely not. In fact, you know, there was a very moving moment\nwhen we were \u2014 went through these customs, British customs in Haifa. And we\nwere going somewhere, I don\u2019t know, there were some buses or something, I don\u2019t\nknow, because we ended up in some kind of small hotel, I remember. And \u2014 but\nbefore we reached this transportation, means of transportation, we were surrounded\nby the people who lived there, the Jews, who had a heartbreaking moment, because\nthey came and they held photographs of people, of their relatives from \u2014 from\nbefore the war, and the names of towns from which they\u2019re came before the war, as\nimmigrants to Palestine. And they were trying to show and ask whether anybodyMay 8, 2013\nknows about \u2014 about these people, whom they left behind when they emigrated.\nAnd of course, this was a\u2014 so moving.",
        "A: Very dramatic moment.",
        "A: No, no. No. No, I knew before the war there was anti-Semitism, yes. Of course I\nknew. I \u2014 I saw the \u2014 the \u2014 the right wing, the [indecipherable] gangs like in\nBucharest, you know, harassing. Yes. But I had, of course, no idea what was\nhappening.",
        "A: In 1940 - 41.",
        "A: In December 1940.",
        "A: Hey, we lived \u2014 left Bucharest fort \u2014 November, then you know, these stopovers\nin \u2014 in Turkey, here and here, it was \u2014 it was December or early January 1941. But\nwe quickly \u2014 I remember my stepfather found this friend who was in the\nintelligence before the war, who \u2014 they worked together on \u2014 in \u2014 in Bucharest.\nAnd he was already in new uniform, because in Palestine there was a PolishMay 8, 2013\nbrigade, Polish independent brigade, about 4,000 men, who crossed over from\nSyria. They were in \u2014 in that first wave of immigration and distribution of the army\nmen, immediately, to France, to \u2014 to England. And when France stopped\naccepting because they did not want to fight a war, really. So they send these people\nfrom the Balkans to Syria, which was under the French protectorate at that time,\nLebanon and Syria. And the brigade was formed from all these army types over\nthere in allet \u2014 in Homs, where you hear the name now, Homs, in Syria, one of the\ntowns which is now being bombarded. And that\u2019s where the brigade was formed.\nAnd when the [indecipherable] collapsed, the French wanted to disarm them. And\nthere was a confrontation between the French general, and the Polish general,\ncommander of the brigade, who said, if you touch any \u2014 any of our guns which we\nhave, we will fight. And with the \u2014 for the first time in the history that the French \u2014\nthat the Poles will fight the French. But we will fight and win. And they decided to\n\u2014 to move everyth \u2014 with every equipment they had, they \u2014 to move to Palestine.\nAnd they went through the Golan Heights, through the \u2014 through the Sea of\nGalilee. So this is how they were, and of course they were a-accepted with open\narms by the British, who did not have anything in the Middle East, anything\nsubstantial. There were 60,000 British forces from Palestine, all the way to Kenya.\nThe British empire. And mostly of them were colonial troops, or Indian troops. So\nMay 8, 2013\nhere is something that comes about 5,000 Poles, with officers, everybody trained,\nand so on, you know, ki \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and motivated. No other country 1-1n occupied Europe every organized this\ntype of a evacuation formation of large number of troops, which ended up about \u2014\nover 200,000 at the end of the war, of Polish troops in that navy, paratroopers and\n15 squadrons of the air force, all \u2014 all branches, from bombers to fighters.",
        "A: So I was getting back to school for my last year.",
        "A: Yes. Well, because I \u2014 my \u2014 my stepfather said, you will not join the army until\nyou finish the school. He was accepted, although he had category D. But he was\nsome kind of clerk situation.",
        "A: Un-Un-Un-Unsuitable for military service, probably.",
        "A: Although I never expected \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 from his looks. Maybe heart or something, I don\u2019t know.May 8, 2013",
        "A: Anyway, he was put in some kind of a clerical work, and I saw him very little,\nexcept that he and \u2014 and this Polish officer of the intelligence, rented an apartment,\nwith two bedrooms. In one, I was sleeping, in the other, his young wife was\nsleeping. And in the middle was kitchen and bathroom. On the [indecipherable]\nstreet in Tel Aviv \u2014 in Tel Aviv. And that\u2019s where we were living. He was coming\nsometimes to visit us. He was already in Alexandria, I remember, in Egypt,\nbecause the brigade moved in while I was in school, to Egypt. And when I finish\nthe high school, I \u2014 I followed \u2014 that I \u2014 I \u2014 that\u2019s what I am describing in the book.\nI \u2014I went with a group of Polish-Jewish recruits for the army, because they were \u2014\nthey w \u2014 we were all recruits, there was no [indecipherable] and they were all\nJewish. And we went to \u2014 to this camp near \u2014 near Haifa for \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 being dressed in uniforms.",
        "A: Polish army uniforms.",
        "A: Well, we had British uniforms, of course, but we had Poland, and all the\ndistinctions, you know\u2019?May 8, 2013",
        "A: Of course British.",
        "A: A-And \u2014 and this is, in this camp, Bayjirjite(ph), was not far \u2014 not far from\nHaifa, where we got \u2014 where we were changed into soldiers, physically. And \u2014",
        "A: In those days we stayed there ab \u2014 only two weeks. It was mostly patrolling the \u2014\nthe shore of the sea. We didn\u2019t know what was happening, but there was German\ninvaded Greece \u2014 Greece, you know? And so there was a \u2014 always that something\nmay happen. So we were defending British empire there, on the beaches of \u2014 near\nHaifa. And \u2014 and later they packed us in the \u2014 in the train, and took us to\nAlexandria, and nearby in the big camp of the Polish brigade, who was already on\nthe other side of Alexandria, on the west side, and here we on the \u2014 on the\n[indecipherable] three months training in the desert warfare. And after that \u2014 which\nwas mostly marching in the sand \u2014 after that, many other sort of events, excursions\nhere and there, but we were finally \u2014 I was selected to go to Tobruk. And \u2014 and\nthen I participated in this Libyan campaign, after the liberation of Tobruk, went all\nthe way to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "A: Well, I perpi \u2014 my one big battle of three days, stor \u2014 storm of the Polish\nbrigades against a crack Italian division of Bersaglieri. It was the famous\nduches(ph) unit. They paraded by running. And \u2014 and that was \u2014 and actually,\nactual \u2014 this \u2014 this action by the Polish brigade, opened the \u2014 broke the front line of\nthe German-Italian forces. So they retreated past Benghazi, and we were sent to \u2014\nto \u2014 to Sri Lanka, which is then shore \u2014 shore \u2014 shore area of \u2014 of Libya, where\nthere were a lot of agriculture lands, where the Arabs were expelled by the Italian\ncolonists who lived in the little huts. And that\u2019s where we stayed. Ah, there were\nmany things of war I forgot about. Is \u2014 I spended fi \u2014 four, five months in the\ndesert, and then we were finally retre \u2014 rem \u2014 ordered to go back to \u2014 to Egypt,\nbecause it was too long to stay on the front line.",
        "A: We went back in April \u00b042.",
        "A: April \u201942, and as a graduate with my high school diploma, me and some other\nfriends were sent to the officers\u2019 training school in Palestine, in the Gaza strip. And\nMay 8, 2013\nthen we \u2014 we were a ter \u2014 we \u2014 under \u2014 when this, the training, special training, but\nsuddenly there came an \u2014 an \u2014 an order to make a choice. Either you want to\ncontinue the officers\u2019 school, or you volunteer to go to England, to air f \u2014 to the air\nforce, to the paratroopers, or to the navy, whichever. One, two, three desks under\nthe stands. One hour time to think about it. Go.",
        "A: No, [had no contact with him.",
        "A: He was in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u20141n Egypt later. I knew that he was in Egypt. But \u2014 but that\nwas the \u2014 th-the first decision which I had to make on my own, and I chose the air\nforce, but then somebody said, any questions? How are we going to get to\nEngland? None of your business. You will get there. Just say yes or no, which way\nyou want to go, one, two, three choices. Military secret, nothing. So again, one\ntransit come, another transit come, then across the Suez Canal, to \u2014 to the Suez\nport, another waiting few days, and then there are big ships in the harbor. What are\nthese? Well, these are this, they brought the British army for General Montgomery,\nto prepare the offensive. That was the Alamein, E] Alamein, big offensive with\nGeneral Montgomery.",
        "A: Who had pushed the Rommel out. So we were loaded again on barges, and we\nwere given Italian rifles. What do you \u2014 what do we need Italian rifles? You will\nfind out on the bow of the ship. So we were \u2014 we \u2014 we approach the ship, it was like\nthat, like a skyscraper, what is \u2014 Queen Mary, which was completely empty,\nbecause this Queen Mary brought 10,000 Scottish troops for General Montgomery\nfor this offensive, and it was going back empty. So what about this Italian rifles?\nBecause you have 1400 German prisoners which you took in Libya. You have to\nescort them. Where? Don\u2019t ask questions. No questions answered, yeah. And we\nhad 1400 young boys like ourselves, from the Rommel army. Germans. And you\nknow, and they were down on the \u2014 at the bottom of the ship, on the third class. We\nwere occupying second class, where they removed only the beds, and put the, you\nknow, bunks, so more people can sleep. And that was the luxurious trip on board of\nQueen Mary.",
        "A: Well, s-some, because we went to south a \u2014 through south Africa, and then\nacross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro. And we didn\u2019t know why, but three of them\nescaped from the ship in the Rio de Janeiro, and they were caught on the beach by\nthe Brazilian police, and they were brought back. So, there were some rough\nmoments when one of the \u2014 our sergeant, who was fluent in German, interrogated\nMay 8, 2013\nthem, and so forth, you know. And it turn out that one of the crew \u2014 they were\nmostly Australians, must have given them a big wrench, so they can \u2014 they opened\nthe screws of the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 portholes, yes, which were screwed in. So that was a first. But then, from Rio\nd\u2019aneiro(ph), we went along the af \u2014 Americas coast, to New York. We didn\u2019t\nknow where are we going, it was all secret, but we ended up in New York. And we\nunloaded the Germans here, and \u2014 on the lower Hudson, on Jersey City, again in\nbarges. And on those barges, when we were sailing with the \u2014 our segment of the\nprisoners, now we began to \u2014 to smile at each other. You know, we were about 19 -\n20, all a \u2014 both sides. So they had some piece of paper, they wanted an autograph,\nand I had some photographs, and some drawings that they made, gave \u2014 given to\nme, you know, as a kind of exchange. And we handed them over to the Canadians.\nPut them in the elegant passenger cars, and took them to the prisoners\u2019 camp in \u2014 in\nCanada.",
        "A: And we stayed for two weeks in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in New York, having a ball,\nabsolutely ball. We were the first unit of 300 Polish ar \u2014 uniforms men, for the first\ntime in history, seven officers, one [indecipherable] and \u2014 and we were almost torn\nMay 8, 2013\napart by all these organizations, like that one that took a couple soldiers for this, for\nthis, for dinner, for a dance, and \u2014 and we stayed for just two weeks, and then sailed\non \u2014 on \u2014 in a big convoy, and then I decid \u2014 discovered that there are oh,\nAmericans on these ships. And then we \u2014 we \u2014 when we learned that America is in\nwar. And that was summer of \u201942.",
        "A: Since December 41.",
        "A: When \u2014 when \u2014 when we entered Tobruk, the officer told me, by the way,\nAmerica was attacked by the Japanese somewhere, the Pacific, and America will\njoin the war, hooray. And that was it. And then secrets. Nobody, no newspapers,\nnothing, until New York, where I found out that America is in the war, because 11\nhuge ships were taking troops to \u2014 to England.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure they were, yeah. Now \u2014 now, there were 50 of us from the officers\u2019\ntraining school, who were with the di \u2014 high school diplomas \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 selected, okay? Fifty. And we were from the brigade, we were from the Libyan\nfront. Two hundred-fifty were those who came from Russia in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u00b041, after\nthe General Sikorski and Stalin made a deal that Poland will help, if you release\nthe prisoners. That was before Katyn was discovered. But this young guys were\nfrom \u2014 from \u2014 mostly from gulags and from prisoner camps. A-And we started to\ntalk to them on that fantastic journey from Rio de Janeiro to New York, you know,\nacross the equator and to Tropics of Cancer, and \u2014",
        "A: Oh, they were telling about Russia. About there \u2014 with the \u2014 for \u2014 for the first\ntime, because they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they came out of Russia. Soviet Union.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Well, they were t-telling horrendous stories of life in \u2014 in \u2014 in the camps. A-A-\nAnd \u2014 and \u2014 and the miracle of them being released at one point. That was a deal\nbetween \u2014 between Polish government in London, and \u2014 and the Soviets, prodded\nby Churchill, you know. You have come to some conclusion of all these disputes,\nyou know, so 1\u2014 you were very dramatic \u2014 in our may \u2014 in my age no, I was not\nMay 8, 2013\nreally very much understanding the \u2014 th-the \u2014 all this implication, but I was a\nwitness of this.",
        "A: No.",

        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Exactly, exactly, exactly.",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he talk \u2014 it took us 15 days. Thi \u2014 this whole sea strip from Suez, via\nsouth Africa, Rio de Janeiro, New York, and this is \u2014 this took six weeks,\ntogether. And that was the only time when I had a little notebook and I was making\nMay 8, 2013\nnotes, and dates, and what happened then. Nothing important, but just as a\nreference. I still have it.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. This 1s only the \u2014 the trip, you know, the \u2014 the sea voyage. Well,\nwe were a big sensation for the American troops on that troop carrier, because they\nwere young boys like us, going for the first time to Europe, abroad, you know?\nThey were from Kansas somewhere, from Missouri, you know, soldiers, G.Ls.\nAnd we were sleeping in hammocks because everything was removed to make more\nroom for troops, you know, this \u2014 on these transport ships. And eleven big ships,\nand the escorts, two cruisers and several destroyers, on \u2014 on all sides, cruising all\nhere, you know, watching for the submarines and U-boats. So it was a\n[indecipherable] pleasant, but mostly Americans were telling us, how is it in the\nwar? What do you do? You know? And we didn\u2019t want to talk about the war,\nfrankly, we were enjoying the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the trip. So, you know. But I \u2014 I\nlearn how to jitterbug on that ship. I met many American soldiers who were trying\nto say a prayer in Polish, you know? They remember what their grandmother what\ntold \u2014 told, you know? Terribly moving. Which I \u2014 moving now, but at that time,\nwas ha, ha, ha, you know, make fun.",
        "A: The stars at night, are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas, that\u2019s what I\nlearned that time.",
        "A: So we ended up in \u2014 in Liverpool.",
        "A: We disembark, I think the first, because th \u2014 I remember Americans on the deck\nwaving back, full of soldiers still. And we went onto the train, which was waiting,\nand well, we were only 300, so there was some \u2014 somebody more than \u2014 than us.\nAnd then we went directly to Scotland, to a camp near [indecipherable], in\nnorthern Scotland, and we stayed there 10 days or something. We soon discovered\nthat every church has a dance hall, and twice a week there were dances at the\nchurch hall, where you could meet a lot of lonely girls. But mostly we were being\ninterviewed. Not us, from the brigade, where we were \u2014 had all our papers and army\nbooks and so forth, but mostly those who came from the Soviet Union. They were\ngrilled again and again, who they are. Later, later, after the war I discover\n[indecipherable] you don\u2019t know why, because the \u2014 the \u2014 the army intelligence\nwanted to know who these people really are. There was no time to interview them\nin \u2014 in Persia, or in Iraq, when they came, you know, from the Soviet Union, nor\nMay 8, 2013\nin Palestine. So they were sort of quickly selected who wanted to go, so they were\non the boat, and came. But the \u2014 the army wanted know exactly who they are, like \u2014\nlike you are asking me now. Where they came from, the addresses and \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 father \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and mother and so forth, you know, for security. Because there was already a\nwe \u2014 awareness that many, many Soviet agents could be smuggled this way.",
        "A: So, they already knew that. So we stayed there, and then finally they \u2014 we were\nseparated into various arms forces, units that we volunteered for. Those for the air\nforce, those for the navy, those for the parachute brigades, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and we\nparted in different places of \u2014 and that\u2019s where I begun about almost a year and a\nhalf training in various, as it was called, stations of \u2014 of the air force. It was all\nmanned by the Polish ar \u2014 air force already, all instructors, all teachers. Except the\nteachers of English were \u2014 were Polish people. And then it \u2014 it \u2014 it took us about\nthat time to \u2014 to reach the \u2014 the \u2014 the level where we could be transferred to \u2014 to the\n\u2014 to the front.",
        "A: It was just after the D-Day.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: It was such a mixture of \u2014 of people, mixing all the time. But I always had very\ngood friends, and one of my best friends was a Ludwig Gutmeier(ph), speaking\nabout the Jewish people, who was with me from \u2014 from the time the brig \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nknow him at the time we were in \u2014 in Libya. We met on the boat, actually, in that\ngroup. And he was a son of a \u2014 of Aba(ph) Gutmeier(ph), a very well-known art\ndealer, and collector of Polish art, maybe better than this, in Warsaw. And he had a\nsister, whom he adored, he had a picture of \u2014 of her sister, was showing. And he\nescaped Warsaw during the, actually, German siege and bombardment, which\nmeans about 10 days after me. How he managed to \u2014 to escape, I don\u2019t know.\nBecause frankly, we never talked about this. Never. The discussions were about\ntoday, right now, and what we are going to do tomorrow. But never \u2014 never\nreminiscences, something \u2014\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: No, nobody \u2014 nobody was interested, frankly. What are we talking? What are we\ngoing to do tomorrow? Have another beer. You know, this was \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014\nthat\u2019s the lesson, but \u2014 which I learn only recently, when I started to write this \u2014 this\n\u2014 this \u2014 this books, this memoirs, were 50 years after the war when I started.",
        "A: I never \u2014 I was never interested in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in\u2014 while I was collecting all the\nphotographs, all the drawings of all these wanderings after the war \u2014 I saved\neverything, without even thinking about it. It was only the first Polish book, there\nwere three books, these are condensed three books here. It was printed in Poland in\n2003, and I probably started this writing about 2000, year 2000.",
        "A: And nobody ask me anything, and I don\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t ask anybody after the war,\nand I came to the d\u2014 completely destroyed city, Warsaw, and we\u2019re planning how\nto spend the night \u2014 dancing night, you know? But nothing about \u2014 nobody told me\nabout the horrors of they went through, uprisings, and so on, the destruction,\nprisoner camps. Nobody. So this Ludwig Gutmeier(ph) was this very good friend,\nand he was with me on this first preliminary stages of tra \u2014 air force training, but at\none \u2014 one point, he said ah, you know, it takes so long. I want to \u2014 I want to \u2014 I\nwant to bomb the Germans. Said, how you going to do it? He said, well, I\u2014 you\nMay 8, 2013\nknow what? There is a \u2014 there is a special they call the bomber. On the \u2014 on the big\nbombers, there is a guy who looks at the target and pushes the button. I want to be\nthat guy. So he left area, because that was much more shorter training. And I met\nLudwig after the war, in Paris, where we spent a very exciting time. And in 1961,\nwhen I came on the Ford Foundation visit to America, on my second day in New\nYork, I met him face to face on Madison Avenue here. Yeah.",
        "A: I was pilot, fighter pilot. Which means, I was alone. My job was everything. And\nI was trained to be a speed fighter pilot. And I was posted soon after the D-Day to a\nPolish wing which consisted of three squadrons, 36 planes in France, on a field trip\n\u2014 airstrip. And we were in so-called tek \u2014 tactical air force, which means we were\nsupporting the ground troops. If you saw \u201cPrivate Ryan,\u201d there is a \u2014 there is a shot\nwhere airplanes are flying very low over this loop of Americans who are trying to \u2014\nto \u2014 to escape the encirclement. Well, that\u2019s what we were doing. Air support to the\nground troops, and \u2014 and bombing from the dive \u2014 dive bombing.",
        "A: So \u2014 and from time to time there was an air contact, but the Germans were very\nfew and \u2014 and sparse in those days, because the Luftwaffe was already \u2014 had theMay 8, 2013\nbroken back, during the Battle of Britain, and following years. Last October, I was\nin Washington, I was asked by the museum of the RAF in London to be a keynote\nspeaker on a yearly gala they have in Washington, in Willard Hotel, which is the \u2014\nthe luxury hotel, you know, on Pennsylvania Avenue. They have a yearly banquet\n\u2014 gala banquet for the f-foundation a \u2014 foun \u2014 American foundation of the Battle of\nBritain, where they are collecting money to build a monument at the museum in\nLondon to the pilots who fought the Battle of Britain, in 1940 - \u201941. And this was a\n\u2014a-\u2014a-\u2014a-\u2014adinner devoted to the role of the Polish fighter pilots, who actually, as\nmy friend Steve, air chief marshal Sir Steven Dalton, who sat next to me in all this\ngala, gilded things and medals, the commander of the Royal Air Force of today,\nsaid that, it is little known, but had it not been for those 120 Polish fighter pilots\nwho came to England in 1940, those who were emi \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 at the border, whom I ma \u2014 who were shipped immediately to England and\nFrance, and later to England, we would not win this battle, he said, because our\nnumbers were dwindling. We had pilots after 15 hours in the plane, sent to this\nquadrant to fight the Luftwaffe.",
        "A: It\u2019s nothing. So they were shot down like ducks, you know.May 8, 2013",
        "A: And \u2014 and so the air chief marshal, and \u2014 then \u2014 and I was the keynote speaker\nfor that event. So that\u2019s like the coronation of this whole \u2014 my wartime events,\nwhich happened 50 \u2014 55 years later.",
        "A: Hundred.",
        "A: Yeah, just hundred, yes.",
        "A: Well, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany. And we were three squadrons,\n302, 308, my squadron, and 317, where I had this friend, this Jewish pilot,\nKazik(ph) Becker(ph). There is the photograph of him, and he had this name of his\nsister chalked on his cowling, you know.",
        "A: I had couple more Jewish pilots, yes. Th-Th-They were in every squadron, there\nwas Jewish and like that.",
        "A: Last bombing mission, we\u2019re preparing for \u2014 the Polish armored division,\nbecause we are supporting the army on the ground, right? So, in the British sector,May 8, 2013\nthere were Canadian force, and \u2014 and British, moving on the northern front.\nAmericans were further south. And the Polish armored division, the tanks, arrived\nat Wilhelmshaven, which is the main base of the German Kriegsmarine.",
        "A: Built in \u2014 in imperial time, and \u2014 and it was the \u2014 we were prepared to support\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 the attack of this British armored division on Wilhelmshaven, which\nalready surrounded by the Polish army. When I made my hundredth, and that was\nthe end of my tour \u2014 the tour was 50, that was my second tour. So you would \u2014 you\ndon\u2019t fly tomorrow. Pack up, you can go. You have tickets and all that. And I was\nvery happy. But then, th-the next few days, they started this bombardment, and \u2014\nand it \u2014 and it \u2014 the war ended soon after that [indecipherable]. So \u2014 but \u2014 but \u2014 but\nthe capitulation of Wilhelmshaven was accepted by the Polish kal \u2014 kalner(ph) of\n\u2014 of the arms division.",
        "A: And this is an amazing coincidence because the war started in Gdansk, by the\nbombardment by Schleswig-Holstein, the German battleship of the Polish outpost\nin Gdansk called Westerplatte, with W. And the war ended Wilhelmshaven with\nthe Polish troops bombarding the Wilhelmshaven. An [indecipherable]\ncoincidence.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 I was \u2014 I left this quadrant in April, and they were still flying\ntil they \u2014 til the first days of May, when the armistice was. And from \u2014 by that time,\nI was in Paris already, with my uncle.",
        "A: Well, th-the \u2014 there were not all, because you know, sometimes you were going\non a patrol, very high up, escorting American bombers, the flying fortresses, few\ntimes. But most of the real danger was because we were coming down on German\npositions, which were very heavily defended by the anti-aircraft guns and machine\nguns. And when you were coming down there, everybody was shooting at you. So it\nwas touch and go. And sometimes we are flying two and three missions every day.",
        "A: Because we were very close, you know, it lasted one hour. You took off, one\nhour you were over the [indecipherable], you bomb, you \u2014 you come down, you \u2014\nyou shoot, and you come back. So it was \u2014 it was a lot of the sum \u2014 you were \u2014\nfound bullets in the fuselage. A couple friends were killed sa \u2014 many were killed\nbecause they landed in the fog, or something like that, you know.May 8, 2013",
        "A: No much. No, but in between, I had two years of the refugee schools in\nBucharest and Tel Aviv.",
        "A: Which were a salvation, because since that time, I did not read a single book\nduring the war. There was no way. I read some English books when I learned. But\naft \u2014 when I arrived in Warsaw after the war, and wanted to join the school of\narchitecture, I was accepted without any tests, or anything. But my \u2014 my level of\neducation was zero, I must tell you frankly, zero. Because I did not have full cycle\nof education like normal school. So I\u2014I-\u2014Is-\u2014I suppose I learned myself.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t feel that I have. I didn\u2019t, no, honestly.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, I know. I don\u2019t think I changed, no.",
        "A: I\u2014I learned a lot, I suppose, about the world, about how people behave in\ndifferent situations. I had my opinion how to behave, which started in Bucharest\nwith saving these two Jewish girls. It was like nothing, but it is \u2014 1t made an imprint\nin me.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes.",
        "A: I was so happy later, that we did this, what we did. And they run away, so you\nknow \u2014 but \u2014",
        "A: Very little, but he told me that, you know, what you know is probably a fraction\nof what I would like to tell you, but there is no time now. One day when we meet in\nquiet, I can tell you yes, yes, I was involved in this, I was involved, yes, all these\npeople that you mention, yes, wa \u2014 it was a cover up for something, and suppose\nand suppose. And that\u2019s where I went to \u2014 to serve in the second army corps, which\nwas mostly composed of the army who came from \u2014 from Russia. Trained in the\nMiddle East, and \u2014 and they \u2014 they \u2014 they played a very important role in \u2014 1n the\nbattle of \u2014 in Italy. They \u2014 they \u2014 they took Monte Cassino, and Anzio, and \u2014 andMay 8, 2013\nliberated Bologna and so forth. They were a major force in \u2014 in \u2014 in the battle of\nliberating \u2014 liberating the Italians. So \u2014 so he \u2014 he served there, probably. He \u2014 he \u2014\nbut that\u2019s \u2014 he only confirmed what I was ec \u2014 he wanted to tell me more, but we\nnever got \u2014 because he did not return to Poland, my mother came to Paris for one\nmonth, on the permit \u2014 a passport, for one month, to get us back. Me and my\nbrother.",
        "A: Well, he was \u2014 he took part in the Warsaw uprising in \u00b044, and was taken as a\nprisoner, and s-stayed in Germany \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and was released. And he found his way to my uncle in Paris, near Paris,\nwhere I also found him, by coincidence. And that\u2019s where the whole family was\ngathering after the war.",
        "A: Me and my brother.",
        "A: No, he came, and they met \u2014 you know, they were married two years, actually,\nbefore the war. And \u2014 and he was involved in this situation politically, that he knew\nhe cannot come back. Plus he came already with a woman [indecipherable] Paris.May 8, 2013\nI mean, what do you want? A-And \u2014 and that\u2019s how they separated, very politely\nand friendly. And they \u2014 they eventually divorced by mail. By lawyers and so.",
        "A: What did I find?",
        "A: I found my home, mostly intact. Half of it was burned, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014\nthere was a four corners in a square, and the backyard. And so the front was where\nour house was, our apartment. The whole length of this nine windows, and \u2014 and the\nlithography, built by my grandfather in 1893 was on the left, for four stories high.\nAnd then the two other wings were residences three stories high, also built by him\nin the \u2014 in the end of 19\" century. That was burned. And apparently, the fire\nstopped by itself.",
        "A: Well, she was \u2014 she was serving pi \u2014 you know, with this insurgent during these\n\u2014 during this \u2014 well, first of all, the \u2014 the lithography was working, under German\nsupervision. And I know that they were printing a lot of illegal documents from the\nradio, from London, you know, what is going on. It was done like an underground\nprinting office, at the same time. But they were doing commercial things, whoever\nneeded something, like before the war. And since this survived the \u2014 the \u2014 the totalMay 8, 2013\ndestruction of Warsaw, is a miracle. I don\u2019t like to use the word, but it was. A-And\n\u2014and she was almost one of the first persons who returned to Warsaw, because\nGermans, after this uprising, expelled everybody. So it was a totally vacant ruin,\ncity of ruins. Over a million people were expelled. The dead were \u2014",
        "A: Hm\u2019?",
        "A: She went to suburban location somewhere. And \u2014 and survived that \u2014 that \u2014 that\nfew months there, and then came back, one of the first, and stood in front of the\nbuilding. She said, my \u2014 my mouth opened. How did it survive? And she went\nthrough the gates, you know, for the \u2014 and said, lith-lithography is also there. The\nother two wings are burned down. And then the \u2014 and then the workers started to\ntake in, you know, all the people from somewhere, who are coming, checking, and\nthey were finding, so she \u2014 she assembled a group of people who started to clean,\nand \u2014 and sort of revive the whole thing. And it was the communist government\nwho took it in \u201949, and \u2014 and really destroyed everything. They said there isn\u2019t a\nplace for any industrial in the cit \u2014 in the center of city. You know, it was this type\nof explanation. But it was obviously illegal for anybody outside the state to have\nany printing \u2014May 8, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 situation.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: For 15 years.",
        "A: Sixty \u2014 \u00b062. Or \u201961 I came to America because I had all kinds of achievements,\nthey were printed in foreign architectural press, in America, and so forth. So \u2014 so I\nwas Selected to go on the Ford Foundation, and I went for a trip for five months\nhere. I bought a car on Queens Boulevard here, for 250 dollars. No, 200 dollars, an\nOldsmobile, \u00b051. And I drove 16,000 miles, all around America. And when I arrive\nat this certain famous school of architecture, Raleigh, North Carolina, which was\nformed in \u201948 with a couple of \u2014 a couple, both architects from Poland, who were\nhere to work on a team for \u2014 to design the United Nations buildings. They were \u2014\nthey were picked up, and to write a new curriculum for this new school of\narchitecture, modern architecture, which was not very familiar word in \u2014 in\nAmerica, which was mostly Colonial, and Classical, as you know, in Washington.",
        "A: So \u2014 so, a modern architecture was oh, modern architecture. And here came\nthese two tac \u2014 this couple who were sort of very well known, and first of all, he\nspoke very well English, because he was in American schools in the 30s, his father\nwas first consul in Chicago. Also they were \u2014 he was born in Siberia. So he was in\nthe American schools, so he spoke English, and \u2014 and he was a \u2014 kind of like a\nprophet of the modern architecture. And he was Lewis Mumford, a very famous\nwriter and \u2014 and he became enchanted with Maciej Nowicki and recommended him\nas a dean of the school of architecture, a new school which was being formed in\nNorth Carolina, of all the places. Deep south.",
        "A: So I drove by, and \u2014 and one day after, I was asked by the same dean, would you\nlike to join the faculty? I said, me? I never taught. That\u2019s very good. We need new\nthings, you know. And about, you know, two weeks ago I was in Raleigh on the\n50\" anniversary of my being \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 joining the faculty there, and 65\" anniversary of the creation of that school.",
        "A: Oh, I married in 1950, most beautiful woman. She is unfortunately now in the\nnursing home here in Manhattan, after brain tumors. And there are the \u2014 her\npicture is there. And \u2014",
        "A: Lenta(ph).",
        "A: Lenta(ph).",
        "A: Actually Irene, but Irena, but \u2014 but she was known as Lenta(ph).",
