        "Q: Were you religious? Did you come from a religious family?",
        "A: No, my father was sort of a liberal person and therefore I did not come from a religious\nhome. Of course every Jew went to temple on Friday and Saturday and all the holidays and\nso did my father.",

And we were\nalways, always friendly and so did they.",
        "Q: Your school?",
        "A: School, I went strictly to a Jewish school. It's a Yiddish school. Until I finished seventh\ngrade. My brothers, two of my brothers went to the yeshiva and two were too small, so they\ndidn't--they went to school. That's it. Also, my brother went to a religious school for boys,\nstrictly boys, no girls.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-semitism before Hitler?",
        "A: In our little town, I would say no because we had actions with the Polish priest. He was\nvery, very good to us and coming from where I was coming, this little town, he never let\nanything to do with the anti-semitism or whatever. Sure there was, you know, but basically\nas a whole we had none. I didn't feel it.",

Okay.\nThen we had a Yiddish school and we had the Polish school. So, we had a lot of schools.\nOur town most of the youth were educated, very educated. And everybody belonged to\nsomething. And I think as far as life itself, 1t was a cultural school, eh, city. Very lovely,\nand an exceptional city. We are all friends, even now. I know where everybody is and they\nknow where I am even though maybe they don't call me, you know, or I call them once a\nyear, but we know each other.",
        "Q: What made it so exceptional?",
        "A: An unusual city, unusual people. Very good people, nice people. We stick together and this\nis what it was.",

        "A: No, not me.",
        "Q: Before the war, actually before even the Russians came in, what did you know about what\nwas happening in Germany and Hitler and the Nazis. Did you know anything?",
        "A: In the, what happened in the 30s, I don't think so. I didn't, as a kid. We didn't have radios.\nMaybe there were a few people that had radios so I remember my father or a other people,\nthey used to stay on the outside from a house and a person had the radio. They used to put\non the radio and everybody was listening what's going on in the world, otherwise you\nwouldn't know.",

        "A: They came in in 1940 I believe. '39?",
        "Q: It is'39. What happened. What do you remember about the beginning of that period?",
        "A: While the Russians were there? Oh yeah. I was still in school because I had to learn\nRussian. That's number one. Life was different and you couldn't do what you want. They\ntell you what to do, what not to do. That means the grown ups and I suppose the kids too.\nWhat can I say.",
        "Q: What did they tell you you couldn't do?",
        "A: I am talking couldn't do, meaning as the grown ups, you know. They had to obey whatever\nthey did. My father was a shoemaker and they told him they have a business for him and\nthey put him in a furniture store. What does he know about furniture, but this is what it 1s.\nPrivate enterprises was not longer. So, anyway, whatever you did you almost worked for the\ngovernment. There was no more storekeepers that didn't belong to the government so this is\nthe way life was.",
        "Q: How did it impact your life as a young girl?",
        "A: Not much. No. I still went to school and came home, had lunch, or whatever, and that's it.",

        "Q: At what point, I remember you telling me before, at what point did your father didn't he have\nto go work in Wilno?",
        "A: No. Vegodnik (ph).",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: That was before the Russians came.",
        "Q: How come\u2019?",
        "A: Because his father was sick and we had to take him to a big city where they had big doctors\nso my father sold his sewing machine that he used to make a living to take my grandfather to\nthe big city. So, he took him and then he came back. I don't think he lived long enough and\nhe died. So, my father was without work and in those days in little towns, everybody was\nindependent. They worked for themselves. So, he had to go to a bigger city and get a job.\nHe worked there and he used to come I don't know how often once a week, but once in two\nweeks he used to come home.",
        "Q: Did you and your mother have to do anything to kind of help the family?",
        "A: Yes, we used to sell in the markets produce.",
        "Q: You grew the produce?",
        "A: Yes. We used to sell it.",
        "Q: So you had sort of a farm or plot of land or something?",
        "A: Yes. We leased it for the season and she used to take care of it and I used to help her\nbecause father wasn't there. My two brothers were younger ones, and the oldest one couldn't\ndo it. He wasn't home at all. He was in a sanitarium. So, this was how life was.",
        "Q: It was hard. Did you have to work hard?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did you have to work hard?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So, when, what do you remember about the German occupation? What do you remember\nabout the beginning of that period?",
        "A: Well, one morning, you got up in the morning and you find out that the Germans have you\nand that's it. That is the beginning. And they came in and in the beginning wasn't as bad\nuntil the SS came and that's when they started to do things and tell everybody what's going to\nhappen, what's going to be, you know what I'm talking? But... They used to tell us to come\non the market place. They took out x amount of Jews and they took them out of the city and\nthey killed them. So, therefore people were afraid to do anything or say anything and this is\nhow it went day by day. And then they started to ask all the Jews who's got copper, gold,\nsilver, whatever they should bring it to them. If they knew that you have it and didn't bring\nit, they put you against the wall and shoot you. That's all there is to it. In front of everybody.",
        "Q: So you saw this?",
        "A: Yes. And then they, and of course they had -- when they came in was I think was in the fall,\nso they used to tell us, ask us, I mean tell us, better, to go and dig out the potatoes because it\nwas already a fall and it was cold. The farmers couldn't take it out because the Germans\nwanted it. They needed potatoes. So, they used to come and whoever wanted to go went\nand of course I did, because I didn't want my mother to go. So, I went. That was in the\nbeginning. Then when the winter came, they were taking people to clean the highways for\nthem to go through so of course I went with my brothers. I didn't let mother or father go and\nwe walked on the snow all night and when we finished we came home. I don't know how\nmany months later, we had a ghetto. They made a ghetto, and certain streets were in the\nghetto, some of them weren't in the ghetto. Like our house was not in the ghetto.",
        "Q: I want to stop you before we get to the ghetto part. I'm trying to get another sense. When\nthe Germans came in, they came in first, not SS? Just troops?",
        "A: No, just troops, yes, yes.",
        "Q: This was when, the beginning of September of '41?",
        "A: The 30th of June 1941 they came in.",
        "Q: And then the SS came in a few weeks later?",
        "A: A few weeks or maybe a few months. I have no idea. It's so many years ago I can't\nremember.",
        "Q: The first troops who came in, were they mean? Were you afraid of them?",
        "A: No, no in the beginning before they did what they did we were not afraid of them because it\nwas the regular army and they were not bad, as bad, but then came the rest of them and that's\nwhen it started.",
        "Q: And they were bad?",
        "A: I couldn't walk on the sidewalk. We had to wear the lattis(ph), you know, the yellow and\nyou couldn't walk after 7 o'clock on the street unless you have a permit. Then it started.\nEvery few months, they used to ask for something else. We also had a Judenrat, that means\nsome of the Jews, they were the responsible people for all the Jews from the town, and\nwhatever they asked the Judenrat came to the Jews and said, \"Look, we have to do that or\nelse.\" So that's what the Judenrat was for. But, was there maybe the ghetto and also you had\nto have a permit to go out. They send you to work, otherwise you couldn't get out.\nWhat else can I tell you. We didn't have it too good, believe me. One morning they told us\nto get out again, and the market place and they took out 120, 140 Jews and they killed them.\nMostly was they were like teachers, nurses, more educated people. They had at least they\nknow who to take out and that was the end of this. And also in'41, the end of '41 they made\na shreta (ph), you know. They took everybody out of the houses and they are to go to the old\ncemetery. We had an old and a, a young one, or whatever. But the old cemetery. And they\nput us one by one and they took out the disabled, either kids or grownups. Some of them are\nhalf crazy or whatever it is and they just killed them, and then they brought in big trucks,\narmy trucks and they took about a thousand of Jews. They dug a pit, a big one, and from one\nend of the pit to the other, a wooden board. A big one. They used to put you up there in the\nmiddle. Give you a shot and you fell in. Do you know what I'm talking. So, a thousand\nJews they killed in that one.",
        "Q: Did you see this or people told you about it?",
        "A: No,no, no. We know where they're at. My father was there and my mother and my two\nbrothers. But I have an uncle that was making him for the Germans boots. All kinds of\nstuff. He was the best and therefore he was with them just like this day. So, he was happy.\nSo anyway, he came to where the graves were. He saw my father and mother and my two\nbrothers so he told the zundenfuhrer (ph) he was the head of the city and told him he needs\nmy father to make the uppers, you understand. So they let him out and they came home.\nThat was still the ghetto. What can I tell you.",
        "Q: I have a question for you. All of these Gentiles you were sort of friendly with before the\nwar, what were they doing? What was their role?",
        "A: Nothing. They didn't do nothing, they didn't say nothing. It was a Jewish problem and this\nis what it was. They had nothing to say.",
        "Q: Did you still talk to them?",
        "A: Well, to a neighbor yes. Ask me a question. I don't know what you want me to say, what\nyou want to know.",
        "Q: So somehow you still maintained a relationship with your neighbors, a neighborly relation?",
        "A: A neighborly, yes, sure. You said hello and they said to us hello and that's it.",
        "Q: Now were you still in school at this point?",
        "A: School? As soon as they came in there was no school for us. Jews could, will not go to\nschool. They would not let them in. They closed up the schools.",
        "Q: When did they decide you had to go to a ghetto?",
        "A: 1942, the 22nd of February.",
        "Q: What happened? Where did you go, where did you live?",
        "A: Well, we lived with an uncle of ours, my father's brother. His home was in the ghetto, so we\ncame down and we stayed there. In each room, and they had four rooms and there were four\nfamilies, five families whatever it is. And we stayed there for the duration of the Ghetto or\nyou may say for the duration of the Jews being 1n that little town.",
        "Q: Four families to a room?",
        "A: Yes. The more the better. Because they were only putting so many houses in the ghetto in\nother words, and the rest were empty.",
        "Q: So your family was all together at this point?",
        "A: At that point, yes, except for one of my brothers. He was sent to work and he was working\nsomewhere in a little town so he wasn't with us. But I saw him later.",
        "Q: What were the conditions like other than being crowded?",
        "A: Food, you need food and it was crowded and the fear itself.",
        "Q: What were you afraid of?",
        "A: Any day they can kill you. What else?",
        "Q: Did you, when you were walking on the streets, did you see, were the Germans in the Ghetto\nitself?",
        "A: No,no, they were outside the Ghetto.",
        "Q: Did you have your own police?",
        "A: We didn't have any police. They were staying outside the Ghetto where the gates were and if\nyou're walking, you have a permit they let you out and then they brought you back in.",
        "Q: So, there weren't a lot of beatings or anything like that in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto? Unless you did something wrong for the time being they don't have to beat\nyou. They kill you nght there and then.",
        "Q: On the outside?",
        "A: On the outside, yes.",
        "Q: Was the Judenrat helpful? What did they do? What were their responsibilities?",
        "A: Well, anything the Germans wanted they talked to the Judenrat and they tell them look we\nwant so much of so much and we're going to get it. So, the Judenrat had to go to the Jews, to\nthe rest of them. Even the Judenrat was also in the ghetto and they used to discuss what to\ndo next, whatever they want. So, this is how it was.",
        "Q: Did you feel, do you remember if you felt that the Judenrat was trying to be helpful or\nwhether they were bad guys or good guys?",
        "A: From what I know or remember they were good guys because it was a small little town and\neverybody knew everybody and everybody had brothers, sisters, uncles, you know what I'm\ntalking. So it was different like in a big city. We knew each other by name, so I wouldn't\nsay they were working for them, but there were certain things they had to supply to them or\nthey're going to take out 20 Jews or 50 Jews and kill them if you don't get it.",
        "Q: Now when you described a few minutes ago some of your work assignments were those\nduring the ghetto time or before?",
        "A: Before.",
        "Q: While you were in the ghetto did you have to work for the Germans?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So how did you spend your time every day?",
        "A: We stayed in the house, that's all. We couldn't go anyplace so we stayed in.",
        "Q: Were there any activities or any secret activities?",
        "A: Well, before the ghetto specially the youth they were very organized. They used to get,\nthey, to be like a Russian guy by the name of Vanka (ph). He used to come in between. He\nwas a partisan and he used to come to our town by the ghetto and talk to some of the people,\nthe young ones, not the old ones and tell them that there's going to be a killing and let them\ncome. Most of the time everything was fine until the last time I remember he was like a\ndouble agent and he gave out some of the guys that were going to run away to the\nunderground. One of them they caught and they killed him. But the youth were organized,\nnot all of them, but alot of them, especially the boys, the men.",
        "Q: Did you or your brothers know about this or were you at all involved?",
        "A: My brothers were involved. I wasn't involved because girls were not involved but I used to\ntake notes. Somebody send a little note, we used to, my brother used to give me something.\nI should take it over to somebody else and give it to them. So this is how they were\norganized.",
        "Q: So, you served as kind of a messenger, a courier?",
        "A: That's right. We had, what's his name? He was a lawyer and he ran away from town the day\nbefore as soon as the ghetto started. They ran away about five guys or seven guys to the\nforest and they used to send the messenger or whatever it 1s, that we should come there, you\nknow. Not me, but somebody else and they used to run away. See if you run away you were\none person, two people, three people, they didn't notice it. So this is how some of them got\nout.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: So you were telling me there were small groups, some of them got away to the forest.",
        "A: Yes, before the ghetto.",
        "Q: That's before?",
        "A: Um-huh. And that was Boretsky (ph). He was a lawyer. In Poland they didn't get an\neducation. He went to Italy, I believe, or Germany and he became a lawyer. He was one\nchild. The parents had a store for leather. He and another few guys they were the organizers\nfor the partisans. They left first and they kept on getting a few guys here and there and every\ntime there was a shkita (ph), you know what it is? A killing, they knew. They used to send a\nduancar (ph) to tell us what's going to happen. So the second, the second killing was in 1942\non August 6, 1942.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: What happened is normally my mother used to give us packages, not with food, but she used\nto give us let's say a piece of material that you can make a dress or pair of pants whatever it\nis and a piece of leather which the farmers don't have it. Do you know what I'm talking?\nTherefore, in case there's a shooting and we have to run or split, you know, at least for that\nthey'll give you a piece of bread, some butter, or some milk. Something. You'll have\nsomething to eat. And everytime there was an the alarm, you used to take this little package\nand I started running and it was like a false alarm. You know what I'm talking? The day that\nwas really important because that was the day that no Jews allowed to be living in the town\nso they're going to make Judenrein. So how can you live there? You can't. So of course that\nmorning I didn't take nothing. What I had on me, this is it. Everybody. So, my brother, he\nlives in Northbrook, 1n Illinois, he was with me. My mother, father and youngest brother\nwere running one way. Me and this brother were running. I don't know where we were\nrunning but we were running and two houses from us was my uncle. That's my uncle that's\nthe uncle that makes my shoes, you know. So, my mother went the other way and then she\nremember half way running to the hideout, she forgot, she better go back home and get a loaf\nof bread. She just baked fresh bread in case you have to sit a day or two so you have\nsomething. By the time she got to the house she couldn't go back. So, my father and my\nlittle brother, the youngest one, they were hiding in an attic somewhere with another few\ncouples and after two nights I think, they ran away to the forest because the town was a lot of\nforest. As soon as you walk out of the city there were forests.",
        "Q: You were saying your brothers ran out, the city was surrounded by forest?",
        "A: And a lot of people are from farmers, from the little towns, the little villages, you know,\nwhere they got married in our town to somebody or vice a versa. So in other words, they\nknew the vicinity very well. So, my father, my brother and this guy and a few more, they\nwent to the forest. I was sitting with my brother knowing what my uncle did last time when\nthey were killing us that he spared his wife and kids and everybody, you know. So I don't\nknow, something told me I should go there. I went there with my brother and they also had a\nhideout, you know, down and we were hiding there. We were sitting. The first day was very\nquiet except they came in -- the Germans used to come in with a ball,a round ball, you\nunderstand, and we didn't have carpet so they used to take the ball and roll 1t over the floor.\nYou see, if you dug something underneath it would settle, do you know what I'm talking?\nSo, the ball would have to stop. So it means that underneath there is somebody. You\nunderstand? Do you understand what I'm saying?",
        "Q: Sort of.",
        "A: On a straight floor when you throw a ball, okay, it runs until it stops by itself, you know. But\nhere is not the case. You see if they dug underneath the dirt settled let the floor down. You\nknow what I'm talking? Okay. So, it makes just like a dent, it's lower, the floor. So they put\nthe ball and it stops in the middle of somewhere they figure they better check, you know.\nAnyway, things got..., everything was fine. Then my aunt she was the aunt, my mother's\nsister, her kids, four of them. They had two boys and two girls. We were all sitting. My\nuncle's sister, with the children, maybe ten people, or whatever, and my uncle comes back\nbecause the zungenfuhrer (ph) asks him, \"Where is your wife and kids?\" He says, \"I don't\nknow. I better go looking.\" And he told them he's going to try to spare them too this time.\nSo they told me, he come to us at night and took his wife out and the kids and he says that\nthe zungenfuhrer (ph) said he's going to let you live and he told us there's going to be\nJudenrein, no Jews, you better go away from here. Go somewhere else. So anyway the\nfollowing day we heard that my aunt and the kids got killed. They killed them right away.\nThey only let live my uncle and the son.",
        "Q: How did you hear these things. I'm trying to get a sense of what it was like. You said, \"we\nheard this.\" You said the following day \"we heard that my aunt was killed.\" How did you\nget this information?",
        "A: He came back. My uncle came back the following night and said they killed everybody\nexcept his son and he said we should better get out and that there was a little town that they\nhad still our ghetto. So, this 1s what we did the night he came telling us. We ran away, I\nmean I ran away. We walked all night and during the day we went somewhere. I don't even\nknow, on a farm, in an attic where they had the pigs and the cows whatever. We saw the\nGermans from far but you know your heart is in your mouth and you hope you survive. So,\nof course after the night, after the day got dark a little bit and we went walking to that little\ntown with the ghetto. So, we came to the ghetto.",
        "Q: What was the name of the town, Sonia?",
        "A: Dworitz (ph).",
        "Q: One other question. When you left your ghetto, was it easy to get out that night? Were there\nguards or were you just able to walk out?",
        "A: You could walk out, yes, because between shooting and killing so many people there was no\nmore ghetto. So, they used to put x amount of people, I don't know the amount, we had a\nmovie house and they stuffed them into the movie house and from there they used to take\nthem to the graves.",
        "Q: So, you got out, you slept in a barn or something that night and the next day you continued to\nthe other town?",
        "A: The evening. You couldn't walk during the day. Let's say if it was in the summer time,\nwhich it was, or in the winter time when the days are longer or shorter so by evening most of\nus knew how to go to these small towns because they were not, maybe they were ten miles\nall together. You understand. So, leaving there was no problem to go into a little town and\nknow how to get in there, you know. So, this is what we did. We came there in the morning\nand all the people. My brother was also the same place in the market place but he was also\nmaking shoes so they let him out. I mean not they let him out, they took all the people, all\nthe workers, what they need, and they send them over to another working.... It's like, a camp\nand the rest whoever did not make it they cut out with them. Some of them stayed in the\nhideout for four or five days because they had enough food.\nAnd then the Germans sooner or later the Germans got them. So, the people that ran away to\nthe forest which most of them are alive, and those that didn't, that was the end of it. So,\nwhen I came to Dworitz (ph), I found my cousin there that he came also from another town.\nMy brother was in that working camp about 30 kilometers. And my younger brother, he was\nthere too.",
        "Q: In the town or the working camp?",
        "A: In the working camp, not in town. So, I don't know how long it was, they went to the forest.\nI haven't seen him yet. I just had my younger brother with me. My father survived with the\nlittle brother and they came also in the forest. So, one of the guys heard that his sons are\nalive also in the same place where I was and he was also from a farm town so he knew\nexactly how to come. So, he came and took maybe ten of us, so he took me, and my brother,\nhe took his kids. They were there too, in that Dworitz, that I'm calling that little town, and\nwe went to the forest. Then I came to the forest I found my father, my three brothers and one\nI had with me, is four, you know, and what can I tell you? It was another time of life.",
        "Q: Let me just stop you. So, the forests were near by and this was early summer of '42?",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: When you got to the forest, were there a lot of people, what was going on?",
        "A: Well, it wasn't like a huge place you come in. No, forget it. He took us and he brought us\nwhere his wife and children are, okay, and he let us stay there. You stayed underneath the,\nthe, the sky. I mean, what? You got a home there? So, anyway, we came with what we\nhad. We used to make a fire at night to make something to eat because during the day we\ncouldn't make it in case the smoke from the fire the Germans will catch on to, you know. So,\nactually the nights was ours. We were not afraid for the nights because the Germans didn't\nwant to go in the woods in our territory because to them it's strange. You see? So, at night\nand of course the winter came, we used to make a fire. I slept in my coat and I woke up in\nthe morning and they were burned out, you know. And what can I tell you? That's all we\nhad. The following winter I think we made a tent, you know, like the army, I suppose, and\nthat's what we slept. We didn't have anything, nothing. We became like this and that's it.\nSo, the second year we were there and the Germans again started to kill us and made it again\nthe same thing, a killing. They used to come and whoever they caught they caught.",
        "Q: In the forest?",
        "A: In the forest, that's right. So, they caught my youngest brother. He was eight years old. And\nwhat they didn't do to him. And then they killed him. You know, they cut you up and they\nmutilate you and then they kill you. So, we ran away, we ran away from that place to\nanother place. In other words, we could move around in the forest but you still have to-- if\nthere is a big highway, it's a no no because you don't know who's driving and who's going\nby, you know. So, we learned how to go this way or that way and we didn't have a compass\nor nothing. Compass.",
        "Q: When they killed your brother, did they make you watch it or did you just hear about it?",
        "A: They took him away. Where are you going to go looking for him?",
        "Q: You just learned later what happened?",
        "A: Yes, yes. The Gentiles were there. The people there they tell us what they did with him and\nthat was it. So, he got killed.",
        "Q: How many, I'm just trying to get a sense of how many people were in your group at this\npoint?",
        "A: There was no such a thing as groups. The partisans they were organized just like my\nbrothers. The younger one -- both of them did but the younger one did by himself, he went\nback to the walking log(?), what's another name, and he and another boy they dug under the\nbarbed wire and he already knew because he was there. He ran away from there and he dug\nit and he came 1n and he talked to an uncle of ours, they wanted winter boots. He was there\nwith his son, you know, and he took up maybe 25 guys and he came back to the forest with\nthem and went another time and took out my uncle, this one. The first time he took the son,\nand the second time he took the uncle and more people and they came to the forest. So, you\nsee the people that were the partisans, they organized. We had nothing to do with them and\nthey had nothing to do with us. So in other words if you take here families, ten families, one\nwas living in this corner somewhere, the other one was living somewhere else. You didn't\npay rent. You can move around. Nobody told you not to move around. You know, so we\nmanaged.",
        "Q: How many were with you?",
        "A: Well, in the beginning maybe three families, that's all. When I say families it could be two\npeople out of the family, because the other ones they killed. You know what I'm talking? It\ndepends who survived. Sometimes let's say you hear about, oh your sister is..., somebody\ntold me that your sister is in this and this place. You know. They would pick themselves up,\nthey had nothing anyway, and they would go there.",
        "Q: So, from time to time maybe another family would join you or someone would leave?",
        "A: Yes, that's right, but we had nothing to do with the partisans.",
        "Q: Now, how did you get whatever you needed like food or supplies?",
        "A: I'll tell you. We used to go at night to the farmers to beg. My brother went, I went all of us\nwent wherever we wanted to eat. So, we used to go in different places and some of them\nused to give us something and this is how we survived. Of course in the forest we had\ncranberries, blueberries, boysenberries, you know that grows in forests, so we used to go--\nmushrooms--we used to go and pick them and we had something to eat. Bread we used to\nget sometimes from the farmers. What can I tell you? We didn't have an oven, we didn't\nhave nothing only the fire, you know, to make a fire that's all we had. Nothing else. Water,\nwe used to dig a little hole and dig deep enough until the water comes up. When it came up\nwe used to take it out and take a handkerchief and push it through, you know what I'm\ntalking, the dirt because otherwise you're going to drink dirt. This is how we had water.\nWe didn't starve to death. Nobody starved in the forest, but we didn't have enough to eat, but\nwe survived. It was enough. We used to go to the forest there, the outside and see potatoes\nso we used to take them out from the ground. Sometimes we used to bake them by the fire.\nSometimes we ate them raw, potatoes. We didn't have salt. So we didn't, okay. But we did\nsurvive, you see.",
        "Q: How did you know which farmers to trust?",
        "A: We didn't. The only thing 1s if the farmers knew if they're going to give out a Jew to the\nGermans, especially on the forest, the next day the partisan will be there and going to put\nthem, let them in the house, let them stay, take all the cattle and burn up the cows with them\ntogether.",
        "Q: But you weren't working with the partisans?",
        "A: The only -- my connection with the partisans is because my two brothers were fighting. My\nfather had two brothers they were there fighting. My other uncle his son -- like I said it was\na small little town so there was somebody that I went to school with, you know what I'm\ntalking. So when I used to go sometimes if they stayed close to us sometimes, you know, but\nif it's far we didn't, we couldn't go, so they used to give us food. But the majority we had to\ngo ourselves at night.",
        "Q: Were you ever, well, you found out sometimes where the people you knew in the partisans\nwere sort of a word of mouth tn the area?",
        "A: Sometimes we knew, not all the time and we wouldn't go risking our lives to go where\nthey're at. Let's say if it's within a few miles we'll go to see them, but anything further or\nmaybe I don't know we wouldn't go.",
        "Q: But you might come across other people who would say to you I ran into your cousin?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: How did you keep in touch at all? I mean how did you find each other occasionally?",
        "A: Well, like I said it was a small town, whoever came settled down in here the other went\nsomewhere else. So we used to go from one to the other place, depends. We didn't like to sit\nin the same place because in case somebody spot us, so we always kept on moving. But\nwhat I'm saying 1s not necessarily did we stay around the partisans. The partisans were\ndifferent. So this is then in 1943, January or February my younger brother got killed. The\nwhite Pollocks killed him; him and another boy, and they brought the boxes.\nHe was strictly with mines and railroading and mines, you know. He had 21, 21 times he\nmined railroads or whatever it is. And my other brother lived through the war, the oldest\none, and when the Russians came in they took most of the boys. Some ran away, and some\ndid not have to go because if the Russian what, major or whatever he was did not want to\ntake the partisans because they were not fighters, you know what I'm talking, not army\npeople. So, if he was different he said, \"No, I won't let you go boys.\" The Russian army\nwants him but you're not trained for war. This is what happened. My brother went, stepped\non a mine and he got killed. So I was left with one brother.\nAnd what can I tell you. We did have a doctor there.",
        "Q: In the forest, in your group, or just in a nearby group?",
        "A: No, no, he used to come from one place to the other. As a matter of fact the doctor lived\nthrough the war. He lived in Brighton Beach and all the people from my -- it's not only my\ntown, there were people from other small towns, you know, they used to go to him as a\ndoctor. He passed away. The partisans had a hospital, they had and it was camouflaged and\nthe Germans never found the place, and he was the doctor. As a matter of fact, I had typhoid\nfever. Most of us had typhoid fever from all the lice. You didn't have anything to change off\nso you used to take the top shirt, whatever you were wearing, shake it over the fire. The lice\nshould come out and get burned. You didn't have anything to wear. Nothing.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTAPE #3",
        "Q: You were describing to me the fact that there was this doctor. What other, you had--",
        "A: We had two doctors. One was an MD. As a matter of fact he pulled my teeth.",
        "Q: In the forest?",
        "A: In the forest, a medical doctor, so what? Now, the other doctor that I'm telling you, he was\nexceptional good, and we were lucky that our place where we stayed next to us was a rich\nfamily. Some people had money. So, he used to come because they were sick too. We were\nall sick with typhoid fever so he used to come there, but when he was already there and we\nlived next door to them, he came. He gave me comfer (ph). You know what comfer (ph)\nis? Okay, so, he gave me that. A lot of them died, you couldn't take--and there was no\nmedication, nothing. But he used to go if somebody was sick he used to help out. A very\nnice man, but he's not alive anymore.",
        "Q: What else did you have in the forest?",
        "A: For, In the beginning they had a bakery. I don't mean a bakery like you buy, you know. It's\nthe oven. It was a big oven, a baker's oven and when the boys came there and there was\nnothing to eat or whatever so they went to the farmers and got flour and they took it to the\nbakery. We called it bakery but it was just an oven, a baker's oven. They used to bake bread\nfor the partisans so if they lived close to me let's say, I would go over and they would give\nme, because we were all one family. You know what I'm trying to say? I wasn't afraid of\nanybody there and they were nice. We were all in trouble. What can I tell you? But after\nthat, the partisans used to go away farther, which way, either it was left or north or south. I\nwouldn't know, I'd never been there. But we survived, went at night and they gave us bread\nor flour or an egg or whatever it is, and we limited ourselves not to eat too much and what\ncan I tell you.",
        "Q: How did you spend the day time? What did you do?",
        "A: If, when we were in the forest, where we were, in other words, as long you did not go out to\nthe highway where somebody could spot you. We used to go for the mushrooms and the\nblueberries, you know. Now potatoes to go in the fields, we didn't go until it was half dark,\nthat you could see where you're going because the Germans never came during the day, you\nunderstand. Toward the evening, rather. They used to start in the morning. So, this way we\nwere not worried. And we managed. We were sitting one time, we're sitting when the--I\nbetter not say that. My husband said it.",
        "Q: You just tell me your own story.",
        "A: The, the Ukraines when they came to the forest they're like the white Russians, you know\nwhat I'm talking. They're not afraid of anybody. So, the Germans got him and they used to\ngo, the first one, to the small little passages in the forest. The Germans were afraid to go.\nThey only went with the highways, the big ones. But this ones, we had the Bundlehofsitz\n(ph), for the, you know, my husband said to you. And we had the Lithuanians. They were\nanother one, bastards. They killed more people in the forest, yeah, because they knew and\nthey were not afraid to go in the forest, inside.\nBut at night it was much easier for us. Now, talking about the Russian partisans, you see, the\nhead, eh I forgot how you say, groups, okay, of partisans. Maybe let's say 20 groups, 30\ngroups, I don't even know how many groups they were. Small ones, like, but they were\ngroups that they didn't like the Jews. As a matter of fact, that lawyer that I told you, he was\nthe first one, a teacher of ours and another, about five guys they went first. They didn't\nbother them because they spoke a good Polish and they did not tell them they were Jews, so\nthey stayed before all of us came in, you understand. When we came and they find out the\npeople, the Russian people, they killed them because they were Jews. That's why it's so--\nanother one. For us, what you're talking family camp, I'm talking we didn't have any guns,\nwe didn't shoot anybody. Some of the Russians, if Jewish boys, in other words.... We used\nto have this companies, the partisans had companies. If they went with some Jewish boys\nand some Gentile boys we didn't have to worry for nothing. But if the Russian soldiers,\nRussian boys, eh, partisans figured they'll come here wherever it was and they knew there\nwere girls so they figured they're going to rape them a few, you know. So, we had a place\nwhere we dug underneath like a dungeon, but what we did is we put walls on trees you\nknow, and we made the walls and then we had the slippen (ph) also from trees, the smaller\nbranches, the thinner one, and we put on the hay, you know what I'm talking, the slippen\n(ph). Well let me tell you, I had a, we had a place underneath the bed, what kind of bed, like\nthe barracks like you see soldiers sleep in the barracks. And some of the pieces of wood\nwould come out. When we knew that the Russians are here a few and no Jewish boys we\nused to run in, in there and hide, too. So, we had to, we as family like you, you're saying.\nWe were afraid for the Russians by themselves. We were afraid for the people that lived\naround the forest. We were afraid for the Pollocks that call themselves Poland without Jews.\nThey used to kill even the soldiers. It doesn't matter. So, we had to fight everybody and be\nafraid of. So I mean, it's a miracle. I'll tell you that we lived through.",
        "Q: You had a lot of enemies?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Was there any organization to your group? Did somebody sort of establish the order and\nwho did what?",
        "A: No, if you had a little tent you got the straw on the floor so you sleep on it and in front of that\ntent you make a little fire and if you have a pot, you put some flour in the pot with water with\nsalt if you have it, and you have soup. So, there was no such a thing as anybody taking care\nof anybody. Everybody was for themselves.",
        "Q: Well, but within your family, did you have a certain job that you did every day or anything\nlike that? Were you responsible for getting the berries?",
        "A: No, no, it's like, no. We were not responsible for anything. We couldn't be responsible for\nourselves.",
        "Q: Now, if some other people came along and they wanted to join your group, was that okay?",
        "A: Yes. If you want to have a little tent there, it's empty, I don't care. Anybody can come.",
        "Q: So, did your group change as time went on?",
        "A: Oh, we had a lot of them that some had a sister let's say five miles from there. There was\nalso a few couples that picked themselves up. They had nothing to take care with them, no\npillows, no covers, nothing. So, they went away. That's it. So I mean, my husband he used\nto come. We had one neighbor, I call him a neighbor, he had a tent too, and he knew all the\nlittle passages to get in and out to the forest from the forest into the villages. He's also from\nmy town. So there used to be a lot of partisans coming to him that he should take them\nwherever they want to go. He knew where to go. This is how we used to see somebody.\nOtherwise, it's only what we are the three, four couples or whatever it is and that's it. We\neven had a baby born.",
        "Q: In your group?",
        "A: Yes. A woman, look, yeah.",
        "Q: How did you meet your husband?",
        "A: Well, that's how I met him. That man used to go with them for you know they go to get\nsome food too. They still go and get food, cattle. But with them it was different. They were\nmen with rifles or automatics. My brother was wearing a, used to have an automatic and so\nfor them it was different than for us. We were isolated from everybody. The only thing 1s,\num, I, because I would, I had my uncles, my cousins there, so sometimes my brothers when\nthey were going from one place to the other if they're passing by they would come and bring\nus some bread or some whatever it is. So, we used to see them. But others and that, they\nwere on their own.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more about how you met your husband, how that came about.",
        "A: Oh, my husband? So he, one evening I was there in that, by the neighbors, or in the little\ntent, dungeon you want to call it. It was a dungeon, you know, and they came to pick up that\nguy. They should take him where they want to go. This is where I met my husband.",
        "Q: What happened. Tell me the story?",
        "A: What happened? Like young kids, girls, boys, you know what I'm talking. He used to come\nthere often enough until we got acquainted and of course he was on one side of the wall and I\nwas on the other side of the wall. I mean, he didn't come to see me. You know what I'm\ntalking? He came because they needed somebody should take him. Him and some old guys,\nand this is what had happened. Then liberation came. I don't know where he was. But then\nsomebody told me where he is and we got acquainted again and we got married.",
        "Q: But in the forest you kind of developed a special friendship, or not?",
        "A: He used to come to take that guy should take him wherever they want to go. And what, they\ncouldn't do things because it, they have so much time in the night to take care of their\nbusiness. So I mean no no, no. Not my husband.",
        "Q: In the forest, did people start having romances or anything like that?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. That they had. Some, most of them had. One of my girlfriends as a matter of\nfact she lives not far from my town, Slonyim (ph). She lived in my town after the war, but\nshe moved away to Slonyim (ph), it's a bigger city I suppose. He was the mayor of the city\nand he's a Russian soldier. My husband mentioned his name, Sergaibiele (ph). Dubakov\n(ph), sorry, Dubakov (ph). Was a very nice guy and she married him. And she stayed there.",
        "Q: What about religion in the forest? Did you pray, did you in any way observe special days?",
        "A: Nothing. What are you going to pray? They killed everybody already and you don't know if\neven in ten minutes you're going to be dead so what are you going to pray, for what. No, we\ndidn't pray, we didn't go anyplace. There was no place to go.",
        "Q: What was, did you have any kind of plan or goal or anything while you were there or were\nyou just there?",
        "A: We were like dummies. We just lived by the day and see that we have enough, something to\neat and survive that's all. Other than that nothing. First of all when we go in the forest he\ntold us no Jews in Poland all together. We thought, \"We are the only one survivors.\" We\ndidn't realize that there are, were people surviving like concentration camps, you know what\nI'm talking. We didn't know. We thought we were the only one who's surviving. So when\nthe Russian soldiers, when, I mean, the Russians came, liberated us, our part, you know\nbecause I walked with them just like you see the soldiers walking on the highway on both\nsides, you know, the tank or the pen, pensard (ph) truck, whatever it is, and they were\nwalking and I was walking because they were going to my town. We came home and this 1s\nit.",
        "Q: Okay, I want to stay in the forest a little bit longer.",
        "A: I'm glad you like tt.",
        "Q: Did you feel there was any difference between being a girl in the forest and a boy or a man.\nDid you feel more vulnerable?",
        "A: Not especially no. You see, most of the girls were looking for boyfriends or the boyfriends\nlooking for girls. I didn't have to look because I had my father and my brother with me. So,\nthe three of us and we had another family, I wasn't looking for that. But some, yes, it's like\nHarold said. You can make a novel out of what went on in the forest. There's no question\nabout it.",
        "Q: I'm just trying to get a sense because we really don't hear much about the differences\nbetween men and women but I suspect that there were, that women might have had a\ndifferent experience.",
        "A: There were girls that were fighting just like the men. And there were girls that stayed; they\nhad parents, like I had a father. They stayed with them. But some of them had boyfriends.\nMy husband 1s alive because he didn't accept an offer from another girl. I betcha he can\nhear. She hid, she--every boy she hid got killed or died, whatever you want to call it. See,\nshe wanted him to get married there and stay married and he said nothing doing. First I have\nto live through the war and then we'll see. She didn't want it so she picked up another few\nboyfriends, you know, and they all got killed. I said to Harold it's a good thing you ran away\nfrom her. No joke. I feel that way. Somebody is unlucky.",
        "Q: So what you're saying is that the girls in the forest wanted some sort of protection.",
        "A: And they mostly went to the Gentile soldiers, or partisans, they were more safer with them.\nBecause let's say if you are a pretty girl and you have a Jewish boyfriend, nght, and there\ncomes a, we used to call them Bostochnik (ph). That's the Russian, from west, you know, all\nthe way from the eastern part. So, if they had their eyes on somebody let's say it wouldn't do\nanybody any good, any Jewish boy to go with that girl because he's going to be there. He\ncan take a boy and kill him for that too, just to be able to go with that girl. So, there was,\nyes, yes, a lot of them.",
        "Q: What about when we talk about the partisans you made the point that you were really very\nseparate but you'd run into them from time to time.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You also said that sometimes you might make bread for them or they might bring you things.\nWas there any--",
        "A: I didn't make bread for them. I told you about a bakery. When we came in they had a\nbakery, a baker's oven.",
        "Q: Oh, it was a partisan bakery?",
        "A: Right, right. So and we, the first year we were close, too, so I used to come like I said. I\nused to go into the kitchen and there were the girls with this one I went to the school and\nwith this one was a neighbor of mine, whatever it is, you know, and they would give me\nfood. This is what I was saying.",
        "Q: So there was really no mutual help between your family and partisan groups?",
        "A: No, they were entirely separate from us.",
        "Q: Were you ever in a situation where somebody whether it was the local people or partisans or\nSoviet partisans who came and took the few things you had?",
        "A: The only thing I remember is one of the Russian guys was chasing my brother because he\nhad boots on and he wanted the boots. Yes, they would do things like that. That's why I said\nwe had to hide from everybody.",
        "Q: You never were really safe?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you have many close calls?",
        "A: Yes, one time they were chasing me and the bullet went into the tree instead of me. Yes.",
        "Q: Who is \"they?\"",
        "A: Meaning Germans.",
        "Q: They were nearby?",
        "A: Oh, they came, they came to see us yes, in the beginning. See, we were inexperienced how\nto live there and what to do there, you know what I'm talking. To us, it was new. Well, how\ndo you know how to, what to do and when to do. So in the beginning, yes they would. But\nlater on they didn't. They send those other ones, the Ukraines and the Lithuanians to do the\ndirty work. Oh, yes, we had it.",
        "Q: So as time went on this got easier or you learned how to live there better?",
        "A: No, the same thing, the same thing. Like I said we didn't think there was any Jews outside of\nthe forest because they made every city Judenrein, no Jews, so where are they? We didn't\nknow the concentration camps that they are alive or whatever it is. Sometimes the farmers\nused to come from the city and tell something, the partisans or whoever it is, you know,\nwhat's going on but other than that they didn't have radios.",
        "Q: When you talk about, I think that's really interesting that you say you thought you were the\nonly Jews alive.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: How did that make you feel or what did you think was going to happen in the future?",
        "A: I'll tell you something. When we saw the Red Army, this was it. Now we are alive, you\nunderstand. So it means the Germans are not here because the Russians are here so of course\nthis gave us a big boost.",
        "Q: But before that, when you thought we're the last Jews in Europe or in Poland--",
        "A: Yeah, Poland, yeah.",
        "Q: Did that make you feel -- give you more strength that you had to stay alive or make you\ndepressed? It's a strange feeling isn't it?",
        "A: Nope. You know why? Because we took it each day as it comes. We did not know what\ntomorrow's going to be and we knew that the Germans are here and how long it's going to\ntake for them to kill us all. So therefore we didn't have any hopes, anything. No hopes.",
        "Q: When, I guess in 1943 the Soviet army really took charge of the partisans did that make any\ndifference to you?",
        "A: Well, to me, no. But it made difference to everybody actually because they used to come\nwith airplanes for the partisans not for us and send down whatever food or instructions so it\nwas different. Sure, you felt a little bit like somebody's here to help. You know what I'm\ntalking? They didn't. They didn't come to the bottom of the, you know. They used to turn\ndown from the sky sort of, you know, and fly away. They never came to land. They did not\nland.",
        "Q: But you would find out about this through the partisans?",
        "A: Nope. You see they, I'll tell you why. Because they had a certain place where there's no\ntrees. It has to be a big place, okay, so they already knew where to come and the partisans\nknew where to wait for them so they used to drop whatever it is, ammunition, medication,\nwhatever it is and they went back up. But at least we knew that Russia knows that we're\nhere. You understand? SO, it gave us a different feeling. But eh...",
        "Q: I know, but how did you know that if you didn't have contact with the partisans? How did\nyou know this was happening?",
        "A: Because it happened in this part of Vivorg (ph) exactly then, you know, and what can I tell\nyou? They had to have a field where to drop it. You should see how the sky was lighting\nup. You can, you wanted to dance and sing, but you couldn't do nothing. But this, this 1s all.",
        "Q: So you saw it?",
        "A: Oh, yes with my own eyes. Yup, that I did.",
        "Q: Okay, that's what I was trying to understand. What do you think was the hardest thing about\nliving in the forest?",
        "A: The hardest thing is survival. This is an answer, I don't know. Survival was the hardest\nthing.",
        "Q: What was the most difficult thing to do in order to survive?",
        "A: God should be with you.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: How long were you in the forest?",
        "A: About two and a half, three years.",
        "Q: That's a long time. This is the Lipitrani (ph)?",
        "A: Yeah, Lipyanskipusch (ph). We didn't have toothbrushes. We didn't have soap. We had\nnothing.",
        "Q: Anything else you can tell me about the life in the forest or being on the run.",
        "A: Well, most of the time we did. We stayed in one place and then we run away to another\nplace and then we came somewhere else and then we come back here because my father\ndidn't like to stay either in one place.",
        "Q: Do you remember being nervous or ever having a nice day or anything like that?",
        "A: I didn't think of anything.",
        "Q: So, did you have a sense when you thought maybe liberation was possible; it was going to be\nsoon?",
        "A: All we knew is that they caught a partisan and they hung him. You know what I'm talking?\nThey found somebody, they hung them. That's all we remember. That's all we knew.",
        "Q: You were very aware that there were Germans around. Were there bombings or anything\nlike that?",
        "A: No. I was saying to my husband. I don't know, they had the airplanes, the Germans, why\ndidn't they bomb us. He has no answer, I have no answer. Do you have an answer?",
        "Q: Tell me about your liberation, what happened? When was this?",
        "A: In 1944. Uh-huh, 1944.",
        "Q: The summer?",
        "A: Summer.",
        "Q: What happened? What do you remember?",
        "A: Oh, I walked with the soldiers until we got to my town.",
        "Q: Wait a minute, you didn't walk with the soldiers. They had to find you somewhere. How\ndid you know you were liberated?",
        "A: Well, we saw them. That we did. From where we were, we saw the highway and we saw\nthe Russians and the Russians had, the infantry used to come to the bushes also and a lot of\ntimes you know a lot of people got killed from the Germans because the Germans they took\nover their uniforms and they walked through the same forest that we were. So, you had to be\nvery careful. The first thing we saw, the, the Russians. First of all, we spoke Russian, so\nthat was no problem as far as the language. When we tell them from where we are they saw\nus, you know. So I have no problem. We walked together all the way until we got into my\ntown.",
        "Q: Was this pretty exciting? I mean did you believe this?",
        "A: How could it be exciting? You are pleased that you are alive and came back to town, but we\nhad on both sides of the city two big graves that they made in the first time when the killing\nwas and the last time, so how can you be so happy. You were pleased for the time being. I\ndidn't know what was going to happen.",
        "Q: What, do you remember what you did first now that you were free and you were back in\nyour town?",
        "A: What I did?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. We saw each other, all my friends and everybody who ever had a house or the parents\nhad a house, they moved into the house. The Gentiles did not have our houses yet. That's\nanother story. So, we came there. Some of them were happy to see us and some of them\nwere not happy to see us. But I, me personally, my father since he was making the uppers\nfor the shoes he gave his sewing machine, he bought a sewing machine afterwards and he\ngave it to a Gentile who used to be a customer of his. And he came and got back the sewing\nmachine. So, he started right away to work. So, they found us. He was the only one left,\nalive. There was no other ones so they used to come and ask him to make them something.\nAfter all, they didn't have the leather because where are they going to get? So, if the guy 1s\nfrom the farms used to have the leather or whatever they had. They used to come. My father\nused to make him the shoes and they used to bring us butter and milk and flour and oil. You\nname it, and fish, everything. We had food up to here.\nI had a baker's oven. Of course I was already 17 years old. I wasn't a baby, you know, but I\nused to make pancakes and I used to make things and I used to bake and if the Russian\nsoldier were coming, you know, from one side and to the other side, I don't recall from\nwhere they came, I always had food to give. Even when my husband told you about the girls\nthat he was running around, you know, the three or four girls, they were not 1n their town\nbecause they had nothing there. When they came to ours, our house was open. Each one got\nto eat. They can eat whatever they want. We had enough of everything. That I did. I have a\ngirlfriend in Texas, Houston, Texas. We were together in the same hideout 1n the forest.\nShe and her brother used to come -- her brother went to school with my brother and I went to\nschool with her and I used to make two, three meals a day and they came. They had no\nmother, no father. They had a house but that's about all, but they had no access to anything\nand they had no money. You need, I don't think if you can get something with money. But,\nso, as far as that food, economical I had no problem.",
        "Q: What was left of, was the town in pretty good shape?",
        "A: Yes, the town was almost the same as we left.",
        "Q: Did you start going to the synagogue again after the war?",
        "A: You can go, you know, what the Russians did with the synagogue? They made it into\nwarehouses.",
        "Q: This was before the Germans came in?",
        "A: They made it before and when they came after the Germans it was the same thing.\nWarehouses, not Temples. We couldn't go any place.",
        "Q: Did you find an alternative way to practice your religion after the war or was that not\nimportant?",
        "A: The Russians wouldn't let you. They'll arrest you, you're not supposed to.",
        "Q: So not even secretly?",
        "A: No. If you want in your own house if you want to say a prayer I suppose nobody can tell\nyou not to, but outside forget it.",
        "Q: So how long did you stay in your town after liberation?",
        "A: In my town I stayed... We came, what? '44 in June, July, somewhere, in '44 until May the\n27th or 25th of 1945. We got married in '45.",
        "Q: How did you find each other?",
        "A: Well, I had a girlfriend in a city, Baronovitch (ph), from my town, but her mother married\ninto somebody from the other town so they lived there. She was with me in the forest too\nbut she was in a different little forest or whatever it is. So, she was telling me, that Harold,\nmy husband, is here in town, you know. So one time she caught him, she saw him, she\ntalked to him and I came out. I stayed with her and we went to see him and he said hello and\nthis and that and that's when it started. I used to and then in '45, yeah '45, we got married. I\nused to, I worked for a newspaper. I was a setter on the newspaper. A little paper from our\ntown. He worked for the KGB. So they didn't let him move into my town and they didn't let\nme out to go to his town. So then they had the Russians said any Polish citizen that wants to\ngo home can go, except my husband. So, my father went and registered him in my town.\nBut they found that out. And they called him in and said, \"Hey, what is this?,\" you know,\nand I couldn't go there. Well, anyway we ran away from there. We left my father and my\nbrother there. My father was waiting for his brother that's coming from the front lines\nbecause he was being taken in the army. So, Harold wanted to leave so the second time\naround, he registered in a different way and we got out. They were chasing us, but we got\nout. Yup.",
        "Q: Where did you go?",
        "A: We went to Bialystok and then we went to Lodz. From Lodz we went to Austria.",
        "Q: What was the plan here? You kept going to these different cities. Did you have a plan or --",
        "A: No, you go. However you want to go you went.",
        "Q: One day you said I think we'll go to Lodz today, no idea why?",
        "A: No, there was organizations, you know, and they have stops here and there whatever it is. In\nthe beginning when we came to, from Lodz, yeah, from Lodz, we went to what do you call\nit? Hungary. See we were supposed to travel as Greek Jews because as Polish Jews where\nare you going? You understand? We already passed up Poland so you cannot do it. Now\nwhat are you going to speak? There is Russians a lot and if you speak Russian they'll find\nout that you should be going back, you know. So anyway we were going as Greeks. You\nsee, SO, we came to Hungary and the Jewish community there, it was very nice. They put us\nup where to sleep. They gave us food and we were supposed to go to Romania but the\nillegal, eh, the illegal, route to go to, eh, Romania, to go to Israel was closed. They couldn't\ndo it. So, we went from Hungary, we went to Austria.",
        "Q: Now, were you planning on going to Israel? Was that your goal?",
        "A: Yes, we were going to go to Israel. And from Austria we walked to the Alps, yeah, yeah,\nyeah, with the packages, whatever we had left and we came into the English side and they\nput up us to sleep and then came the Israeli, it was the English Fifth Army, but they were\nmade up of Israeli Jews. You understand? Okay. So, they were waiting for us by the border\nof Italy and they took us out from that little camp where we were and in closed trucks, you\nknow, army trucks and they took us to Treviso. That's the first place we were in Italy. And\nwhen we came there let me tell you. That was a sight. They set up long tables, long, long\ntables with all kinds of gems and scrambled eggs and butter. We ate like pigs. We were\nhungry, you know what I mean for the people that came tn Israel, eh, in Italy. And after that,\nthey started to assort us where somebody wants to go or doesn't want to go, where they want\nto stay, you know what I'm talking. They had places where we could go, stay, you know.\nSo, we chose to go in one place and this is how we came to Italy. We liked it there. It's very\nnice country, beautiful people.",
        "Q: Were you traveling with other people or just you and Harold?",
        "A: No, a whole group. Oh yeah.",
        "Q: So, how long were you in Italy?",
        "A: Oh, we came in in May, the 27th of May 1945 till 1948.",
        "Q: Where were you living in Italy then?",
        "A: Well, we were first if I tell you in a little place, Nonantolla (ph), Bologna, Modena. We\nwere in Venice. We were in Milan, and my husband was a madrich. You know what a\nmadrich? A head of a kibbutz. Then of course I got pregnant. They had a place in Florence\nthat was like a little clinic. So, downstairs was the clinic and the upstairs had let's say, five\nrooms, ten rooms. I don't even remember. We had a nurse, Theresa. She used to take care\nof us. The doctor used to come once a week I think and see the women, pregnant women.\nNo other women, but only pregnant women. And we stayed in Florence until we got a visa\nand we came to America.",
        "Q: When you were living in Italy in these different cities, were you living in an apartment?\nWere you living in a community, a camp?",
        "A: Villas.",
        "Q: Did you meet up with other refugees, people who had come from the camps?",
        "A: Oh sure, sure, there were a lot of people.",
        "Q: Was this a surprise to you?",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you something. We came in in '45 they just let out the concentration camps, so\nwe knew that they are liberated, were liberated just now and we were liberated more than a\nyear before. So it wasn't a-- I was surprised at that late, you know. Of course if the Russians\nwouldn't come to us, we would have to wait for the Americans. Who knows if we would be\nalive all together.",
        "Q: So you met some of these people that came straight out of the camps?",
        "A: Yes. And you had tables with people sitting at tables taking your name, who you are, where\nyou are, where you're going, when you're coming, you know. So, and this is the way it was.",
        "Q: Did you befriend any of these camp survivors?",
        "A: No, because we were going from one place to the other until we didn't come to Italy. We\ndidn't have any friends. Of course in Lodz, yes we had my cousin. He came there, another\none came. I see, yes, I did see a few but not too many.",
        "Q: But in Italy you saw them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were they in pretty bad shape?",
        "A: No, they were not. The only one that was in bad shape was my uncle's brother that I\nrecognized; I don't know how I did it. He came from Mauthausen and I told Harold, \"There\nis my uncle's brother.\" He said, \"You must be crazy.\" I said, \"No Harold.\" He lived in, he\ngot married in a different town so he used to come to my aunt. Once in a while if I was there\nI saw them, and sure enough it was him and we got together and he didn't walk away from us\nfor nothing. After all, his brother is my uncle, so.",
        "Q: It must have been pretty special to see him.",
        "A: Let me tell you, in the camps, what they brought in from the concentration camps there were\npeople that they were guards in the camps, you know, and they used to call them kapos. You\nheard the name kapos? They used to take -- the partisans used to take those guys and\nclobber them. That's right, and then they would give them away to the American soldiers\nand let them handle them. Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: This was in Italy?",
        "A: In one place we must have slept maybe 500 people were in one room, a big one, a real big\nroom. It was in Bologna or in Modena, I don't remember, and everybody slept on the floor.\nAll 500 and somebody had to go to the washroom so they went, but then on the way back\nthey don't know where their bunk is. Sometimes they came to the wrong place.",
        "Q: So, for a while you were in a camp, until you got your villas?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You did stay in a DP camp for a little while.",
        "A: Yeah, I don't call it a, yeah, a DP camp.",
        "Q: Some sort of camp?",
        "A: Yes. They gave you food to eat, you know. Yeah, they did.",
        "Q: There you were with a lot of these concentration camp survivors?",
        "A: Yes, we were mixed all together. I mean, there was no different --",
        "Q: They had a very different story than you did?",
        "A: Of course they did.",
        "Q: Was it surprising to you?",
        "A: No. Knowing what Hitler can do, I wasn't surprised of anything. But let me tell you one\nthing I know and I tell it to anybody, if you would not be fighting in a way, even though I\ndidn't, I personally didn't fight, or some other people, but if it wouldn't be for the fighters, we\nwould not survived. They would have killed us one by one. That's why I believe that people\nshould be ready and don't call me a, a killer. It's like, my husband says to me, \"You're\nalways afraid, even for a mouse. But you're not afraid for me. A fly you're afraid of, but not\nfor me.\" That's how much but no, no, no. If you're going to sit and do nothing, nothing will\nhappen, nothing will come good.",
        "Q: How many of the people who left your town and went to the forest, did most of them\nsurvive?",
        "A: No. No they didn't. Some of them got infections, gangrene, and died. Some of them had the\ntyphoid and died, and some of them got killed in the battle fighting. So there it is.",
        "Q: Okay, so you were in Italy, your original plan was to go to Palestine, but you came here.",
        "A: My husband has, had two uncles, three uncles and an aunt in Chicago so we changed our\nmind and we came here.",
        "Q: Let me ask you just a couple of questions.",
        "A: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: After all of this, is 1t important to you to be Jewish? How do you feel about religion after all\nof this?",
        "A: I am, I have mixed emotions. I really mean it. Why were we killed, for what? And if you\nask the rabbis that were sitting along the highway to wait to be killed, yes, ask them, they\nused to say we are the fortunate because they are going. We're going to have a tough life left\nof us, you understand. So, that's why I said I don't know. Sometimes it's good and\nsometimes-- now I'll say that much. I'm not a worldly person. I'm not educated to the point,\nyou know, where you can make a difference, but I think we Jews make our own problems. I\ngot, even though I'm wearing glasses, I can see very far and very good. I really mean it. Tell\nme something. Now I'll ask you a question. How come three million of the Jews were from\nPoland? Hungary started in '43 they started to take them. Now why?\nCzechoslovakia didn't have it as bad either in comparison to the amount of Jews they had\nthere. Didn't die as many as by us. They didn't kill them as much. How come Poland's got\nthree million and all the rest of the thirty little countries has three millions? Can you tell me?\nThat's 31 countries. Well, that's a good question, can you answer me that? Well I don't\nknow. I'm not that smart and if, maybe I'll tell you. Maybe this generation. See Polish Jews\nwere different than the Jews from Russia, even though they were locked up. We were\ndifferent people, Hungary, Romania I don't know. Still better than Poland. Polish Jews I\nthink are different all together, and I have a feeling this is why they killed three millions out\nof the Poles, Polish Jews. How come all the camps were in Poland? Most of the camps\nwere in Poland. You tell me why? And why they did not take from our sides, from Ukraine\nand Byelorussiadat, you know, that part. They didn't take us to concentration camps. Some\nof them fell in so that by I don't know by what. They needed so many people or something\nand they took them from one place and then they shipped them somewhere else so that\nmaybe they wind up in a concentration camp, but they did not come to this town and take out\nsO many on a train or whatever it is and send them to concentration camp. They used to\nmake in every city. You take Wilno, Pana (ph), Babi Yar, they killed them. I don't, you tell\nme why. Nobody can give me that answer.",
        "Q: We have just a very little bit left on this tape. Is there anything else you want to say, you\nwant to add to this?",
        "A: What can I tell you? We Jews are used to the pogroms, and pogroms, and pogroms. All of\nEurope, you know. That's why we ran away from Europe all together. We didn't want that\npart. Italy was a beautiful country and they were very nice to the Jews, even during the war.\nIf anybody had a business and left their manager run the business and if they did survive,\nthey got back the store. What did you get in Poland? And everybody -- Russians are in\nPoland, Germany, what for? I would make it a cemetery there. Itis. Anyway, a Jewish\ncemetery might as well be their cemetery too. Maybe I'm saying it wrong I don't know. I'm\nnot so smart but that's the way I feel. I don't like violence. It's not good, but if somebody\ngoes to kill me, I want to make sure I'll kill him first. This is my belief, but like I said.\nNobody can give me an answer why three million Polish Jews got killed.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: Now when you described a few minutes ago some of your work assignments were those\nduring the ghetto time or before?",
        "Q: While you were in the ghetto did you have to work for the Germans?",

        "Q: That's before?",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "Q: You were saying your brothers ran out, the city was surrounded by forest?",
        "Q: Sort of.",
        "Q: How did you hear these things. I'm trying to get a sense of what it was like. You said, \"we\nheard this.\" You said the following day \"we heard that my aunt was killed.\" How did you\nget this information?",
        "Q: What was the name of the town, Sonia?",
        "Q: One other question. When you left your ghetto, was it easy to get out that night? Were there\nguards or were you just able to walk out?",
        "Q: So, you got out, you slept in a barn or something that night and the next day you continued to\nthe other town?",
        "Q: In the town or the working camp?",
        "Q: Let me just stop you. So, the forests were near by and this was early summer of '42?",
        "Q: When you got to the forest, were there a lot of people, what was going on?",
        "Q: In the forest?",

        "Q: But you might come across other people who would say to you I ran into your cousin?",
        "Q: How did you keep in touch at all? I mean how did you find each other occasionally?",
        "Q: In the forest, in your group, or just in a nearby group?",
        "Q: You were describing to me the fact that there was this doctor. What other, you had--",

        "Q: Was there any organization to your group? Did somebody sort of establish the order and\nwho did what?",
        "Q: Well, but within your family, did you have a certain job that you did every day or anything\nlike that? Were you responsible for getting the berries?",
        "Q: Now, if some other people came along and they wanted to join your group, was that okay?",

        "Q: What was, did you have any kind of plan or goal or anything while you were there or were\nyou just there?",
        "Q: Okay, I want to stay in the forest a little bit longer.",
        "Q: Did you feel there was any difference between being a girl in the forest and a boy or a man.\nDid you feel more vulnerable?",
        "Q: I'm just trying to get a sense because we really don't hear much about the differences\nbetween men and women but I suspect that there were, that women might have had a\ndifferent experience.",
        "Q: So what you're saying is that the girls in the forest wanted some sort of protection.",
        "Q: What about when we talk about the partisans you made the point that you were really very\nseparate but you'd run into them from time to time.",
        "Q: You also said that sometimes you might make bread for them or they might bring you things.",
        "Q: Oh, it was a partisan bakery?",
        "Q: So there was really no mutual help between your family and partisan groups?",

        "Q: When you talk about, I think that's really interesting that you say you thought you were the\nonly Jews alive.",
        "Q: How did that make you feel or what did you think was going to happen in the future?",
        "Q: But before that, when you thought we're the last Jews in Europe or in Poland--",
        "Q: Did that make you feel -- give you more strength that you had to stay alive or make you\ndepressed? It's a strange feeling isn't it?",
        "Q: When, I guess in 1943 the Soviet army really took charge of the partisans did that make any\ndifference to you?",
        "Q: But you would find out about this through the partisans?",
        "Q: I know, but how did you know that if you didn't have contact with the partisans? How did\nyou know this was happening?",
        "Q: So you saw it?",

        "Q: The summer?",
        "Q: What happened? What do you remember?",
        "Q: Wait a minute, you didn't walk with the soldiers. They had to find you somewhere. How\ndid you know you were liberated?",

So, he took him and then he came back. I don't think he lived long enough and\nhe died. So, my father was without work and in those days in little towns, everybody was\nindependent. They worked for themselves. So, he had to go to a bigger city and get a job.\nHe worked there and he used to come I don't know how often once a week, but once in two\nweeks he used to come home.",

        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Well, one morning, you got up in the morning and you find out that the Germans have you\nand that's it. That is the beginning. And they came in and in the beginning wasn't as bad\nuntil the SS came and that's when they started to do things and tell everybody what's going to\nhappen, what's going to be, you know what I'm talking? But... They used to tell us to come\non the market place. They took out x amount of Jews and they took them out of the city and\nthey killed them. So, therefore people were afraid to do anything or say anything and this is\nhow it went day by day. And then they started to ask all the Jews who's got copper, gold,\nsilver, whatever they should bring it to them. If they knew that you have it and didn't bring\nit, they put you against the wall and shoot you. That's all there is to it. In front of everybody.",

And then they, and of course they had -- when they came in was I think was in the fall,\nso they used to tell us, ask us, I mean tell us, better, to go and dig out the potatoes because it\nwas already a fall and it was cold. The farmers couldn't take it out because the Germans\nwanted it. They needed potatoes. So, they used to come and whoever wanted to go went\nand of course I did, because I didn't want my mother to go. So, I went. That was in the\nbeginning. Then when the winter came, they were taking people to clean the highways for\nthem to go through so of course I went with my brothers. I didn't let mother or father go and\nwe walked on the snow all night and when we finished we came home. I don't know how\nmany months later, we had a ghetto. They made a ghetto, and certain streets were in the\nghetto, some of them weren't in the ghetto. Like our house was not in the ghetto.",

        "A: No, no in the beginning before they did what they did we were not afraid of them because it\nwas the regular army and they were not bad, as bad, but then came the rest of them and that's\nwhen it started.",
        "A: I couldn't walk on the sidewalk. We had to wear the lattis(ph), you know, the yellow and\nyou couldn't walk after 7 o'clock on the street unless you have a permit. Then it started.\nEvery few months, they used to ask for something else. We also had a Judenrat, that means\nsome of the Jews, they were the responsible people for all the Jews from the town, and\nwhatever they asked the Judenrat came to the Jews and said, \"Look, we have to do that or\nelse.\" So that's what the Judenrat was for. But, was there maybe the ghetto and also you had\nto have a permit to go out. They send you to work, otherwise you couldn't get out.\nWhat else can I tell you. We didn't have it too good, believe me. One morning they told us\nto get out again, and the market place and they took out 120, 140 Jews and they killed them.\nMostly was they were like teachers, nurses, more educated people. They had at least they\nknow who to take out and that was the end of this. And also in'41, the end of '41 they made\na shreta (ph), you know. They took everybody out of the houses and they are to go to the old\ncemetery. We had an old and a, a young one, or whatever. But the old cemetery. And they\nput us one by one and they took out the disabled, either kids or grownups. Some of them are\nhalf crazy or whatever it is and they just killed them, and then they brought in big trucks,\narmy trucks and they took about a thousand of Jews. They dug a pit, a big one, and from one\nend of the pit to the other, a wooden board. A big one. They used to put you up there in the\nmiddle. Give you a shot and you fell in. Do you know what I'm talking. So, a thousand\nJews they killed in that one.",
        "A: No,no, no. We know where they're at. My father was there and my mother and my two\nbrothers. But I have an uncle that was making him for the Germans boots. All kinds of\nstuff. He was the best and therefore he was with them just like this day. So, he was happy.\nSo anyway, he came to where the graves were. He saw my father and mother and my two\nbrothers so he told the zundenfuhrer (ph) he was the head of the city and told him he needs\nmy father to make the uppers, you understand. So they let him out and they came home.\nThat was still the ghetto. What can I tell you.",
        "A: Nothing. They didn't do nothing, they didn't say nothing. It was a Jewish problem and this\nis what it was. They had nothing to say.",
        "A: Well, to a neighbor yes. Ask me a question. I don't know what you want me to say, what\nyou want to know.",
        "A: A neighborly, yes, sure. You said hello and they said to us hello and that's it.",
        "A: School? As soon as they came in there was no school for us. Jews could, will not go to\nschool. They would not let them in. They closed up the schools.",
        "A: 1942, the 22nd of February.",
        "A: Well, we lived with an uncle of ours, my father's brother. His home was in the ghetto, so we\ncame down and we stayed there. In each room, and they had four rooms and there were four\nfamilies, five families whatever it is. And we stayed there for the duration of the Ghetto or\nyou may say for the duration of the Jews being 1n that little town.",
        "A: Yes. The more the better. Because they were only putting so many houses in the ghetto in\nother words, and the rest were empty.",
        "A: At that point, yes, except for one of my brothers. He was sent to work and he was working\nsomewhere in a little town so he wasn't with us. But I saw him later.",
        "A: Food, you need food and it was crowded and the fear itself.",
        "A: Any day they can kill you. What else?",
        "A: No,no, they were outside the Ghetto.",
        "A: We didn't have any police. They were staying outside the Ghetto where the gates were and if\nyou're walking, you have a permit they let you out and then they brought you back in.",
        "A: In the ghetto? Unless you did something wrong for the time being they don't have to beat\nyou. They kill you nght there and then.",
        "A: On the outside, yes.",
        "A: Well, anything the Germans wanted they talked to the Judenrat and they tell them look we\nwant so much of so much and we're going to get it. So, the Judenrat had to go to the Jews, to\nthe rest of them. Even the Judenrat was also in the ghetto and they used to discuss what to\ndo next, whatever they want. So, this is how it was.",
        "A: From what I know or remember they were good guys because it was a small little town and\neverybody knew everybody and everybody had brothers, sisters, uncles, you know what I'm\ntalking. So it was different like in a big city. We knew each other by name, so I wouldn't\nsay they were working for them, but there were certain things they had to supply to them or\nthey're going to take out 20 Jews or 50 Jews and kill them if you don't get it.",
        "A: Before.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We stayed in the house, that's all. We couldn't go anyplace so we stayed in.",
        "A: Well, before the ghetto specially the youth they were very organized. They used to get,\nthey, to be like a Russian guy by the name of Vanka (ph). He used to come in between. He\nwas a partisan and he used to come to our town by the ghetto and talk to some of the people,\nthe young ones, not the old ones and tell them that there's going to be a killing and let them\ncome. Most of the time everything was fine until the last time I remember he was like a\ndouble agent and he gave out some of the guys that were going to run away to the\nunderground. One of them they caught and they killed him. But the youth were organized,\nnot all of them, but alot of them, especially the boys, the men.",
        "A: My brothers were involved. I wasn't involved because girls were not involved but I used to\ntake notes. Somebody send a little note, we used to, my brother used to give me something.\nI should take it over to somebody else and give it to them. So this is how they were\norganized.",
        "A: That's right. We had, what's his name? He was a lawyer and he ran away from town the day\nbefore as soon as the ghetto started. They ran away about five guys or seven guys to the\nforest and they used to send the messenger or whatever it 1s, that we should come there, you\nknow. Not me, but somebody else and they used to run away. See if you run away you were\none person, two people, three people, they didn't notice it. So this is how some of them got\nout.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Yes, before the ghetto.",
        "A: Um-huh. And that was Boretsky (ph). He was a lawyer. In Poland they didn't get an\neducation. He went to Italy, I believe, or Germany and he became a lawyer. He was one\nchild. The parents had a store for leather. He and another few guys they were the organizers\nfor the partisans. They left first and they kept on getting a few guys here and there and every\ntime there was a shkita (ph), you know what it is? A killing, they knew. They used to send a\nduancar (ph) to tell us what's going to happen. So the second, the second killing was in 1942\non August 6, 1942.",
        "A: What happened is normally my mother used to give us packages, not with food, but she used\nto give us let's say a piece of material that you can make a dress or pair of pants whatever it\nis and a piece of leather which the farmers don't have it. Do you know what I'm talking?\nTherefore, in case there's a shooting and we have to run or split, you know, at least for that\nthey'll give you a piece of bread, some butter, or some milk. Something. You'll have\nsomething to eat. And everytime there was an the alarm, you used to take this little package\nand I started running and it was like a false alarm. You know what I'm talking? The day that\nwas really important because that was the day that no Jews allowed to be living in the town\nso they're going to make Judenrein. So how can you live there? You can't. So of course that\nmorning I didn't take nothing. What I had on me, this is it. Everybody. So, my brother, he\nlives in Northbrook, 1n Illinois, he was with me. My mother, father and youngest brother\nwere running one way. Me and this brother were running. I don't know where we were\nrunning but we were running and two houses from us was my uncle. That's my uncle that's\nthe uncle that makes my shoes, you know. So, my mother went the other way and then she\nremember half way running to the hideout, she forgot, she better go back home and get a loaf\nof bread. She just baked fresh bread in case you have to sit a day or two so you have\nsomething. By the time she got to the house she couldn't go back. So, my father and my\nlittle brother, the youngest one, they were hiding in an attic somewhere with another few\ncouples and after two nights I think, they ran away to the forest because the town was a lot of\nforest. As soon as you walk out of the city there were forests.",
        "A: And a lot of people are from farmers, from the little towns, the little villages, you know,\nwhere they got married in our town to somebody or vice a versa. So in other words, they\nknew the vicinity very well. So, my father, my brother and this guy and a few more, they\nwent to the forest. I was sitting with my brother knowing what my uncle did last time when\nthey were killing us that he spared his wife and kids and everybody, you know. So I don't\nknow, something told me I should go there. I went there with my brother and they also had a\nhideout, you know, down and we were hiding there. We were sitting. The first day was very\nquiet except they came in -- the Germans used to come in with a ball,a round ball, you\nunderstand, and we didn't have carpet so they used to take the ball and roll 1t over the floor.\nYou see, if you dug something underneath it would settle, do you know what I'm talking?\nSo, the ball would have to stop. So it means that underneath there is somebody. You\nunderstand? Do you understand what I'm saying?",
        "A: On a straight floor when you throw a ball, okay, it runs until it stops by itself, you know. But\nhere is not the case. You see if they dug underneath the dirt settled let the floor down. You\nknow what I'm talking? Okay. So, it makes just like a dent, it's lower, the floor. So they put\nthe ball and it stops in the middle of somewhere they figure they better check, you know.\nAnyway, things got..., everything was fine. Then my aunt she was the aunt, my mother's\nsister, her kids, four of them. They had two boys and two girls. We were all sitting. My\nuncle's sister, with the children, maybe ten people, or whatever, and my uncle comes back\nbecause the zungenfuhrer (ph) asks him, \"Where is your wife and kids?\" He says, \"I don't\nknow. I better go looking.\" And he told them he's going to try to spare them too this time.\nSo they told me, he come to us at night and took his wife out and the kids and he says that\nthe zungenfuhrer (ph) said he's going to let you live and he told us there's going to be\nJudenrein, no Jews, you better go away from here. Go somewhere else. So anyway the\nfollowing day we heard that my aunt and the kids got killed. They killed them right away.\nThey only let live my uncle and the son.",
        "A: He came back. My uncle came back the following night and said they killed everybody\nexcept his son and he said we should better get out and that there was a little town that they\nhad still our ghetto. So, this 1s what we did the night he came telling us. We ran away, I\nmean I ran away. We walked all night and during the day we went somewhere. I don't even\nknow, on a farm, in an attic where they had the pigs and the cows whatever. We saw the\nGermans from far but you know your heart is in your mouth and you hope you survive. So,\nof course after the night, after the day got dark a little bit and we went walking to that little\ntown with the ghetto. So, we came to the ghetto.",
        "A: Dworitz (ph).",
        "A: You could walk out, yes, because between shooting and killing so many people there was no\nmore ghetto. So, they used to put x amount of people, I don't know the amount, we had a\nmovie house and they stuffed them into the movie house and from there they used to take\nthem to the graves.",
        "A: The evening. You couldn't walk during the day. Let's say if it was in the summer time,\nwhich it was, or in the winter time when the days are longer or shorter so by evening most of\nus knew how to go to these small towns because they were not, maybe they were ten miles\nall together. You understand. So, leaving there was no problem to go into a little town and\nknow how to get in there, you know. So, this is what we did. We came there in the morning\nand all the people. My brother was also the same place in the market place but he was also\nmaking shoes so they let him out. I mean not they let him out, they took all the people, all\nthe workers, what they need, and they send them over to another working.... It's like, a camp\nand the rest whoever did not make it they cut out with them. Some of them stayed in the\nhideout for four or five days because they had enough food.\nAnd then the Germans sooner or later the Germans got them. So, the people that ran away to\nthe forest which most of them are alive, and those that didn't, that was the end of it. So,\nwhen I came to Dworitz (ph), I found my cousin there that he came also from another town.\nMy brother was in that working camp about 30 kilometers. And my younger brother, he was\nthere too.",
        "A: In the working camp, not in town. So, I don't know how long it was, they went to the forest.\nI haven't seen him yet. I just had my younger brother with me. My father survived with the\nlittle brother and they came also in the forest. So, one of the guys heard that his sons are\nalive also in the same place where I was and he was also from a farm town so he knew\nexactly how to come. So, he came and took maybe ten of us, so he took me, and my brother,\nhe took his kids. They were there too, in that Dworitz, that I'm calling that little town, and\nwe went to the forest. Then I came to the forest I found my father, my three brothers and one\nI had with me, is four, you know, and what can I tell you? It was another time of life.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "A: Well, it wasn't like a huge place you come in. No, forget it. He took us and he brought us\nwhere his wife and children are, okay, and he let us stay there. You stayed underneath the,\nthe, the sky. I mean, what? You got a home there? So, anyway, we came with what we\nhad. We used to make a fire at night to make something to eat because during the day we\ncouldn't make it in case the smoke from the fire the Germans will catch on to, you know. So,\nactually the nights was ours. We were not afraid for the nights because the Germans didn't\nwant to go in the woods in our territory because to them it's strange. You see? So, at night\nand of course the winter came, we used to make a fire. I slept in my coat and I woke up in\nthe morning and they were burned out, you know. And what can I tell you? That's all we\nhad. The following winter I think we made a tent, you know, like the army, I suppose, and\nthat's what we slept. We didn't have anything, nothing. We became like this and that's it.\nSo, the second year we were there and the Germans again started to kill us and made it again\nthe same thing, a killing. They used to come and whoever they caught they caught.",
        "A: In the forest, that's right. So, they caught my youngest brother. He was eight years old. And\nwhat they didn't do to him. And then they killed him. You know, they cut you up and they\nmutilate you and then they kill you. So, we ran away, we ran away from that place to\nanother place. In other words, we could move around in the forest but you still have to-- if\nthere is a big highway, it's a no no because you don't know who's driving and who's going\nby, you know. So, we learned how to go this way or that way and we didn't have a compass\nor nothing. Compass.",
        "A: They took him away. Where are you going to go looking for him?",
        "A: Yes, yes. The Gentiles were there. The people there they tell us what they did with him and\nthat was it. So, he got killed.",
        "A: There was no such a thing as groups. The partisans they were organized just like my\nbrothers. The younger one -- both of them did but the younger one did by himself, he went\nback to the walking log(?), what's another name, and he and another boy they dug under the\nbarbed wire and he already knew because he was there. He ran away from there and he dug\nit and he came 1n and he talked to an uncle of ours, they wanted winter boots. He was there\nwith his son, you know, and he took up maybe 25 guys and he came back to the forest with\nthem and went another time and took out my uncle, this one. The first time he took the son,\nand the second time he took the uncle and more people and they came to the forest. So, you\nsee the people that were the partisans, they organized. We had nothing to do with them and\nthey had nothing to do with us. So in other words if you take here families, ten families, one\nwas living in this corner somewhere, the other one was living somewhere else. You didn't\npay rent. You can move around. Nobody told you not to move around. You know, so we\nmanaged.",
        "A: Well, in the beginning maybe three families, that's all. When I say families it could be two\npeople out of the family, because the other ones they killed. You know what I'm talking? It\ndepends who survived. Sometimes let's say you hear about, oh your sister is..., somebody\ntold me that your sister is in this and this place. You know. They would pick themselves up,\nthey had nothing anyway, and they would go there.",
        "A: Yes, that's right, but we had nothing to do with the partisans.",
        "A: I'll tell you. We used to go at night to the farmers to beg. My brother went, I went all of us\nwent wherever we wanted to eat. So, we used to go in different places and some of them\nused to give us something and this is how we survived. Of course in the forest we had\ncranberries, blueberries, boysenberries, you know that grows in forests, so we used to go--\nmushrooms--we used to go and pick them and we had something to eat. Bread we used to\nget sometimes from the farmers. What can I tell you? We didn't have an oven, we didn't\nhave nothing only the fire, you know, to make a fire that's all we had. Nothing else. Water,\nwe used to dig a little hole and dig deep enough until the water comes up. When it came up\nwe used to take it out and take a handkerchief and push it through, you know what I'm\ntalking, the dirt because otherwise you're going to drink dirt. This is how we had water.\nWe didn't starve to death. Nobody starved in the forest, but we didn't have enough to eat, but\nwe survived. It was enough. We used to go to the forest there, the outside and see potatoes\nso we used to take them out from the ground. Sometimes we used to bake them by the fire.\nSometimes we ate them raw, potatoes. We didn't have salt. So we didn't, okay. But we did\nsurvive, you see.",
        "A: We didn't. The only thing 1s if the farmers knew if they're going to give out a Jew to the\nGermans, especially on the forest, the next day the partisan will be there and going to put\nthem, let them in the house, let them stay, take all the cattle and burn up the cows with them\ntogether.",
        "A: The only -- my connection with the partisans is because my two brothers were fighting. My\nfather had two brothers they were there fighting. My other uncle his son -- like I said it was\na small little town so there was somebody that I went to school with, you know what I'm\ntalking. So when I used to go sometimes if they stayed close to us sometimes, you know, but\nif it's far we didn't, we couldn't go, so they used to give us food. But the majority we had to\ngo ourselves at night.",
        "A: Sometimes we knew, not all the time and we wouldn't go risking our lives to go where\nthey're at. Let's say if it's within a few miles we'll go to see them, but anything further or\nmaybe I don't know we wouldn't go.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, like I said it was a small town, whoever came settled down in here the other went\nsomewhere else. So we used to go from one to the other place, depends. We didn't like to sit\nin the same place because in case somebody spot us, so we always kept on moving. But\nwhat I'm saying 1s not necessarily did we stay around the partisans. The partisans were\ndifferent. So this is then in 1943, January or February my younger brother got killed. The\nwhite Pollocks killed him; him and another boy, and they brought the boxes.\nHe was strictly with mines and railroading and mines, you know. He had 21, 21 times he\nmined railroads or whatever it is. And my other brother lived through the war, the oldest\none, and when the Russians came in they took most of the boys. Some ran away, and some\ndid not have to go because if the Russian what, major or whatever he was did not want to\ntake the partisans because they were not fighters, you know what I'm talking, not army\npeople. So, if he was different he said, \"No, I won't let you go boys.\" The Russian army\nwants him but you're not trained for war. This is what happened. My brother went, stepped\non a mine and he got killed. So I was left with one brother.\nAnd what can I tell you. We did have a doctor there.",
        "A: No, no, he used to come from one place to the other. As a matter of fact the doctor lived\nthrough the war. He lived in Brighton Beach and all the people from my -- it's not only my\ntown, there were people from other small towns, you know, they used to go to him as a\ndoctor. He passed away. The partisans had a hospital, they had and it was camouflaged and\nthe Germans never found the place, and he was the doctor. As a matter of fact, I had typhoid\nfever. Most of us had typhoid fever from all the lice. You didn't have anything to change off\nso you used to take the top shirt, whatever you were wearing, shake it over the fire. The lice\nshould come out and get burned. You didn't have anything to wear. Nothing.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTAPE #3",
        "A: We had two doctors. One was an MD. As a matter of fact he pulled my teeth.",
        "A: In the forest, a medical doctor, so what? Now, the other doctor that I'm telling you, he was\nexceptional good, and we were lucky that our place where we stayed next to us was a rich\nfamily. Some people had money. So, he used to come because they were sick too. We were\nall sick with typhoid fever so he used to come there, but when he was already there and we\nlived next door to them, he came. He gave me comfer (ph). You know what comfer (ph)\nis? Okay, so, he gave me that. A lot of them died, you couldn't take--and there was no\nmedication, nothing. But he used to go if somebody was sick he used to help out. A very\nnice man, but he's not alive anymore.",
        "A: For, In the beginning they had a bakery. I don't mean a bakery like you buy, you know. It's\nthe oven. It was a big oven, a baker's oven and when the boys came there and there was\nnothing to eat or whatever so they went to the farmers and got flour and they took it to the\nbakery. We called it bakery but it was just an oven, a baker's oven. They used to bake bread\nfor the partisans so if they lived close to me let's say, I would go over and they would give\nme, because we were all one family. You know what I'm trying to say? I wasn't afraid of\nanybody there and they were nice. We were all in trouble. What can I tell you? But after\nthat, the partisans used to go away farther, which way, either it was left or north or south. I\nwouldn't know, I'd never been there. But we survived, went at night and they gave us bread\nor flour or an egg or whatever it is, and we limited ourselves not to eat too much and what\ncan I tell you.",
        "A: If, when we were in the forest, where we were, in other words, as long you did not go out to\nthe highway where somebody could spot you. We used to go for the mushrooms and the\nblueberries, you know. Now potatoes to go in the fields, we didn't go until it was half dark,\nthat you could see where you're going because the Germans never came during the day, you\nunderstand. Toward the evening, rather. They used to start in the morning. So, this way we\nwere not worried. And we managed. We were sitting one time, we're sitting when the--I\nbetter not say that. My husband said it.",
        "A: The, the Ukraines when they came to the forest they're like the white Russians, you know\nwhat I'm talking. They're not afraid of anybody. So, the Germans got him and they used to\ngo, the first one, to the small little passages in the forest. The Germans were afraid to go.\nThey only went with the highways, the big ones. But this ones, we had the Bundlehofsitz\n(ph), for the, you know, my husband said to you. And we had the Lithuanians. They were\nanother one, bastards. They killed more people in the forest, yeah, because they knew and\nthey were not afraid to go in the forest, inside.\nBut at night it was much easier for us. Now, talking about the Russian partisans, you see, the\nhead, eh I forgot how you say, groups, okay, of partisans. Maybe let's say 20 groups, 30\ngroups, I don't even know how many groups they were. Small ones, like, but they were\ngroups that they didn't like the Jews. As a matter of fact, that lawyer that I told you, he was\nthe first one, a teacher of ours and another, about five guys they went first. They didn't\nbother them because they spoke a good Polish and they did not tell them they were Jews, so\nthey stayed before all of us came in, you understand. When we came and they find out the\npeople, the Russian people, they killed them because they were Jews. That's why it's so--\nanother one. For us, what you're talking family camp, I'm talking we didn't have any guns,\nwe didn't shoot anybody. Some of the Russians, if Jewish boys, in other words.... We used\nto have this companies, the partisans had companies. If they went with some Jewish boys\nand some Gentile boys we didn't have to worry for nothing. But if the Russian soldiers,\nRussian boys, eh, partisans figured they'll come here wherever it was and they knew there\nwere girls so they figured they're going to rape them a few, you know. So, we had a place\nwhere we dug underneath like a dungeon, but what we did is we put walls on trees you\nknow, and we made the walls and then we had the slippen (ph) also from trees, the smaller\nbranches, the thinner one, and we put on the hay, you know what I'm talking, the slippen\n(ph). Well let me tell you, I had a, we had a place underneath the bed, what kind of bed, like\nthe barracks like you see soldiers sleep in the barracks. And some of the pieces of wood\nwould come out. When we knew that the Russians are here a few and no Jewish boys we\nused to run in, in there and hide, too. So, we had to, we as family like you, you're saying.\nWe were afraid for the Russians by themselves. We were afraid for the people that lived\naround the forest. We were afraid for the Pollocks that call themselves Poland without Jews.\nThey used to kill even the soldiers. It doesn't matter. So, we had to fight everybody and be\nafraid of. So I mean, it's a miracle. I'll tell you that we lived through.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, if you had a little tent you got the straw on the floor so you sleep on it and in front of that\ntent you make a little fire and if you have a pot, you put some flour in the pot with water with\nsalt if you have it, and you have soup. So, there was no such a thing as anybody taking care\nof anybody. Everybody was for themselves.",
        "A: No, no, it's like, no. We were not responsible for anything. We couldn't be responsible for\nourselves.",
        "A: Yes. If you want to have a little tent there, it's empty, I don't care. Anybody can come.",
        "A: Oh, we had a lot of them that some had a sister let's say five miles from there. There was\nalso a few couples that picked themselves up. They had nothing to take care with them, no\npillows, no covers, nothing. So, they went away. That's it. So I mean, my husband he used\nto come. We had one neighbor, I call him a neighbor, he had a tent too, and he knew all the\nlittle passages to get in and out to the forest from the forest into the villages. He's also from\nmy town. So there used to be a lot of partisans coming to him that he should take them\nwherever they want to go. He knew where to go. This is how we used to see somebody.\nOtherwise, it's only what we are the three, four couples or whatever it is and that's it. We\neven had a baby born.",
        "A: Yes. A woman, look, yeah.",
        "A: Well, that's how I met him. That man used to go with them for you know they go to get\nsome food too. They still go and get food, cattle. But with them it was different. They were\nmen with rifles or automatics. My brother was wearing a, used to have an automatic and so\nfor them it was different than for us. We were isolated from everybody. The only thing 1s,\num, I, because I would, I had my uncles, my cousins there, so sometimes my brothers when\nthey were going from one place to the other if they're passing by they would come and bring\nus some bread or some whatever it is. So, we used to see them. But others and that, they\nwere on their own.",
        "A: Oh, my husband? So he, one evening I was there in that, by the neighbors, or in the little\ntent, dungeon you want to call it. It was a dungeon, you know, and they came to pick up that\nguy. They should take him where they want to go. This is where I met my husband.",
        "A: What happened? Like young kids, girls, boys, you know what I'm talking. He used to come\nthere often enough until we got acquainted and of course he was on one side of the wall and I\nwas on the other side of the wall. I mean, he didn't come to see me. You know what I'm\ntalking? He came because they needed somebody should take him. Him and some old guys,\nand this is what had happened. Then liberation came. I don't know where he was. But then\nsomebody told me where he is and we got acquainted again and we got married.",
        "A: He used to come to take that guy should take him wherever they want to go. And what, they\ncouldn't do things because it, they have so much time in the night to take care of their\nbusiness. So I mean no no, no. Not my husband.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes. That they had. Some, most of them had. One of my girlfriends as a matter of\nfact she lives not far from my town, Slonyim (ph). She lived in my town after the war, but\nshe moved away to Slonyim (ph), it's a bigger city I suppose. He was the mayor of the city\nand he's a Russian soldier. My husband mentioned his name, Sergaibiele (ph). Dubakov\n(ph), sorry, Dubakov (ph). Was a very nice guy and she married him. And she stayed there.",
        "A: Nothing. What are you going to pray? They killed everybody already and you don't know if\neven in ten minutes you're going to be dead so what are you going to pray, for what. No, we\ndidn't pray, we didn't go anyplace. There was no place to go.",
        "A: We were like dummies. We just lived by the day and see that we have enough, something to\neat and survive that's all. Other than that nothing. First of all when we go in the forest he\ntold us no Jews in Poland all together. We thought, \"We are the only one survivors.\" We\ndidn't realize that there are, were people surviving like concentration camps, you know what\nI'm talking. We didn't know. We thought we were the only one who's surviving. So when\nthe Russian soldiers, when, I mean, the Russians came, liberated us, our part, you know\nbecause I walked with them just like you see the soldiers walking on the highway on both\nsides, you know, the tank or the pen, pensard (ph) truck, whatever it is, and they were\nwalking and I was walking because they were going to my town. We came home and this 1s\nit.",
        "A: I'm glad you like tt.",
        "A: Not especially no. You see, most of the girls were looking for boyfriends or the boyfriends\nlooking for girls. I didn't have to look because I had my father and my brother with me. So,\nthe three of us and we had another family, I wasn't looking for that. But some, yes, it's like\nHarold said. You can make a novel out of what went on in the forest. There's no question\nabout it.",
        "A: There were girls that were fighting just like the men. And there were girls that stayed; they\nhad parents, like I had a father. They stayed with them. But some of them had boyfriends.\nMy husband 1s alive because he didn't accept an offer from another girl. I betcha he can\nhear. She hid, she--every boy she hid got killed or died, whatever you want to call it. See,\nshe wanted him to get married there and stay married and he said nothing doing. First I have\nto live through the war and then we'll see. She didn't want it so she picked up another few\nboyfriends, you know, and they all got killed. I said to Harold it's a good thing you ran away\nfrom her. No joke. I feel that way. Somebody is unlucky.",
        "A: And they mostly went to the Gentile soldiers, or partisans, they were more safer with them.\nBecause let's say if you are a pretty girl and you have a Jewish boyfriend, nght, and there\ncomes a, we used to call them Bostochnik (ph). That's the Russian, from west, you know, all\nthe way from the eastern part. So, if they had their eyes on somebody let's say it wouldn't do\nanybody any good, any Jewish boy to go with that girl because he's going to be there. He\ncan take a boy and kill him for that too, just to be able to go with that girl. So, there was,\nyes, yes, a lot of them.",
        "A: Yes.\nWas there any--",
        "A: I didn't make bread for them. I told you about a bakery. When we came in they had a\nbakery, a baker's oven.",
        "A: Right, right. So and we, the first year we were close, too, so I used to come like I said. I\nused to go into the kitchen and there were the girls with this one I went to the school and\nwith this one was a neighbor of mine, whatever it is, you know, and they would give me\nfood. This is what I was saying.",
        "A: No, they were entirely separate from us.",
        "A: The only thing I remember is one of the Russian guys was chasing my brother because he\nhad boots on and he wanted the boots. Yes, they would do things like that. That's why I said\nwe had to hide from everybody.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, one time they were chasing me and the bullet went into the tree instead of me. Yes.",
        "A: Meaning Germans.",
        "A: Oh, they came, they came to see us yes, in the beginning. See, we were inexperienced how\nto live there and what to do there, you know what I'm talking. To us, it was new. Well, how\ndo you know how to, what to do and when to do. So in the beginning, yes they would. But\nlater on they didn't. They send those other ones, the Ukraines and the Lithuanians to do the\ndirty work. Oh, yes, we had it.",
        "A: No, the same thing, the same thing. Like I said we didn't think there was any Jews outside of\nthe forest because they made every city Judenrein, no Jews, so where are they? We didn't\nknow the concentration camps that they are alive or whatever it is. Sometimes the farmers\nused to come from the city and tell something, the partisans or whoever it is, you know,\nwhat's going on but other than that they didn't have radios.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: I'll tell you something. When we saw the Red Army, this was it. Now we are alive, you\nunderstand. So it means the Germans are not here because the Russians are here so of course\nthis gave us a big boost.",
        "A: Yeah, Poland, yeah.",
        "A: Nope. You know why? Because we took it each day as it comes. We did not know what\ntomorrow's going to be and we knew that the Germans are here and how long it's going to\ntake for them to kill us all. So therefore we didn't have any hopes, anything. No hopes.",
        "A: Well, to me, no. But it made difference to everybody actually because they used to come\nwith airplanes for the partisans not for us and send down whatever food or instructions so it\nwas different. Sure, you felt a little bit like somebody's here to help. You know what I'm\ntalking? They didn't. They didn't come to the bottom of the, you know. They used to turn\ndown from the sky sort of, you know, and fly away. They never came to land. They did not\nland.",
        "A: Nope. You see they, I'll tell you why. Because they had a certain place where there's no\ntrees. It has to be a big place, okay, so they already knew where to come and the partisans\nknew where to wait for them so they used to drop whatever it is, ammunition, medication,\nwhatever it is and they went back up. But at least we knew that Russia knows that we're\nhere. You understand? SO, it gave us a different feeling. But eh...",
        "A: Because it happened in this part of Vivorg (ph) exactly then, you know, and what can I tell\nyou? They had to have a field where to drop it. You should see how the sky was lighting\nup. You can, you wanted to dance and sing, but you couldn't do nothing. But this, this 1s all.",
        "A: Oh, yes with my own eyes. Yup, that I did.",
        "A: The hardest thing is survival. This is an answer, I don't know. Survival was the hardest\nthing.",
        "A: God should be with you.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: About two and a half, three years.",
        "A: Yeah, Lipyanskipusch (ph). We didn't have toothbrushes. We didn't have soap. We had\nnothing.",
        "A: Well, most of the time we did. We stayed in one place and then we run away to another\nplace and then we came somewhere else and then we come back here because my father\ndidn't like to stay either in one place.",
        "A: I didn't think of anything.",
        "A: All we knew is that they caught a partisan and they hung him. You know what I'm talking?\nThey found somebody, they hung them. That's all we remember. That's all we knew.",
        "A: No. I was saying to my husband. I don't know, they had the airplanes, the Germans, why\ndidn't they bomb us. He has no answer, I have no answer. Do you have an answer?",
        "A: In 1944. Uh-huh, 1944.",
        "A: Summer.",
        "A: Oh, I walked with the soldiers until we got to my town.",
        "A: Well, we saw them. That we did. From where we were, we saw the highway and we saw\nthe Russians and the Russians had, the infantry used to come to the bushes also and a lot of\ntimes you know a lot of people got killed from the Germans because the Germans they took\nover their uniforms and they walked through the same forest that we were. So, you had to be\nvery careful. The first thing we saw, the, the Russians. First of all, we spoke Russian, so\nthat was no problem as far as the language. When we tell them from where we are they saw\nus, you know. So I have no problem. We walked together all the way until we got into my\ntown.",
        "A: How could it be exciting? You are pleased that you are alive and came back to town, but we\nhad on both sides of the city two big graves that they made in the first time when the killing\nwas and the last time, so how can you be so happy. You were pleased for the time being. I\ndidn't know what was going to happen.",
        "A: What I did?",
        "A: Yes. We saw each other, all my friends and everybody who ever had a house or the parents\nhad a house, they moved into the house. The Gentiles did not have our houses yet. That's\nanother story. So, we came there. Some of them were happy to see us and some of them\nwere not happy to see us. But I, me personally, my father since he was making the uppers\nfor the shoes he gave his sewing machine, he bought a sewing machine afterwards and he\ngave it to a Gentile who used to be a customer of his. And he came and got back the sewing\nmachine. So, he started right away to work. So, they found us. He was the only one left,\nalive. There was no other ones so they used to come and ask him to make them something.\nAfter all, they didn't have the leather because where are they going to get? So, if the guy 1s\nfrom the farms used to have the leather or whatever they had. They used to come. My father\nused to make him the shoes and they used to bring us butter and milk and flour and oil. You\nname it, and fish, everything. We had food up to here.\nI had a baker's oven. Of course I was already 17 years old. I wasn't a baby, you know, but I\nused to make pancakes and I used to make things and I used to bake and if the Russian\nsoldier were coming, you know, from one side and to the other side, I don't recall from\nwhere they came, I always had food to give. Even when my husband told you about the girls\nthat he was running around, you know, the three or four girls, they were not 1n their town\nbecause they had nothing there. When they came to ours, our house was open. Each one got\nto eat. They can eat whatever they want. We had enough of everything. That I did. I have a\ngirlfriend in Texas, Houston, Texas. We were together in the same hideout 1n the forest.\nShe and her brother used to come -- her brother went to school with my brother and I went to\nschool with her and I used to make two, three meals a day and they came. They had no\nmother, no father. They had a house but that's about all, but they had no access to anything\nand they had no money. You need, I don't think if you can get something with money. But,\nso, as far as that food, economical I had no problem.",
        "A: Yes, the town was almost the same as we left.",
        "A: You can go, you know, what the Russians did with the synagogue? They made it into\nwarehouses.",
        "A: They made it before and when they came after the Germans it was the same thing.\nWarehouses, not Temples. We couldn't go any place.",
        "A: The Russians wouldn't let you. They'll arrest you, you're not supposed to.",
        "A: No. If you want in your own house if you want to say a prayer I suppose nobody can tell\nyou not to, but outside forget it.",
        "A: In my town I stayed... We came, what? '44 in June, July, somewhere, in '44 until May the\n27th or 25th of 1945. We got married in '45.",
        "A: Well, I had a girlfriend in a city, Baronovitch (ph), from my town, but her mother married\ninto somebody from the other town so they lived there. She was with me in the forest too\nbut she was in a different little forest or whatever it is. So, she was telling me, that Harold,\nmy husband, is here in town, you know. So one time she caught him, she saw him, she\ntalked to him and I came out. I stayed with her and we went to see him and he said hello and\nthis and that and that's when it started. I used to and then in '45, yeah '45, we got married. I\nused to, I worked for a newspaper. I was a setter on the newspaper. A little paper from our\ntown. He worked for the KGB. So they didn't let him move into my town and they didn't let\nme out to go to his town. So then they had the Russians said any Polish citizen that wants to\ngo home can go, except my husband. So, my father went and registered him in my town.\nBut they found that out. And they called him in and said, \"Hey, what is this?,\" you know,\nand I couldn't go there. Well, anyway we ran away from there. We left my father and my\nbrother there. My father was waiting for his brother that's coming from the front lines\nbecause he was being taken in the army. So, Harold wanted to leave so the second time\naround, he registered in a different way and we got out. They were chasing us, but we got\nout. Yup.",
        "A: We went to Bialystok and then we went to Lodz. From Lodz we went to Austria.",
        "A: No, you go. However you want to go you went.",
        "A: No, there was organizations, you know, and they have stops here and there whatever it is. In\nthe beginning when we came to, from Lodz, yeah, from Lodz, we went to what do you call\nit? Hungary. See we were supposed to travel as Greek Jews because as Polish Jews where\nare you going? You understand? We already passed up Poland so you cannot do it. Now\nwhat are you going to speak? There is Russians a lot and if you speak Russian they'll find\nout that you should be going back, you know. So anyway we were going as Greeks. You\nsee, SO, we came to Hungary and the Jewish community there, it was very nice. They put us\nup where to sleep. They gave us food and we were supposed to go to Romania but the\nillegal, eh, the illegal, route to go to, eh, Romania, to go to Israel was closed. They couldn't\ndo it. So, we went from Hungary, we went to Austria.",
        "A: Yes, we were going to go to Israel. And from Austria we walked to the Alps, yeah, yeah,\nyeah, with the packages, whatever we had left and we came into the English side and they\nput up us to sleep and then came the Israeli, it was the English Fifth Army, but they were\nmade up of Israeli Jews. You understand? Okay. So, they were waiting for us by the border\nof Italy and they took us out from that little camp where we were and in closed trucks, you\nknow, army trucks and they took us to Treviso. That's the first place we were in Italy. And\nwhen we came there let me tell you. That was a sight. They set up long tables, long, long\ntables with all kinds of gems and scrambled eggs and butter. We ate like pigs. We were\nhungry, you know what I mean for the people that came tn Israel, eh, in Italy. And after that,\nthey started to assort us where somebody wants to go or doesn't want to go, where they want\nto stay, you know what I'm talking. They had places where we could go, stay, you know.\nSo, we chose to go in one place and this is how we came to Italy. We liked it there. It's very\nnice country, beautiful people.",
        "A: No, a whole group. Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh, we came in in May, the 27th of May 1945 till 1948.",
        "A: Well, we were first if I tell you in a little place, Nonantolla (ph), Bologna, Modena. We\nwere in Venice. We were in Milan, and my husband was a madrich. You know what a\nmadrich? A head of a kibbutz. Then of course I got pregnant. They had a place in Florence\nthat was like a little clinic. So, downstairs was the clinic and the upstairs had let's say, five\nrooms, ten rooms. I don't even remember. We had a nurse, Theresa. She used to take care\nof us. The doctor used to come once a week I think and see the women, pregnant women.\nNo other women, but only pregnant women. And we stayed in Florence until we got a visa\nand we came to America.",
        "A: Villas.",
        "A: Oh sure, sure, there were a lot of people.",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you something. We came in in '45 they just let out the concentration camps, so\nwe knew that they are liberated, were liberated just now and we were liberated more than a\nyear before. So it wasn't a-- I was surprised at that late, you know. Of course if the Russians\nwouldn't come to us, we would have to wait for the Americans. Who knows if we would be\nalive all together.",
        "A: Yes. And you had tables with people sitting at tables taking your name, who you are, where\nyou are, where you're going, when you're coming, you know. So, and this is the way it was.",
        "A: No, because we were going from one place to the other until we didn't come to Italy. We\ndidn't have any friends. Of course in Lodz, yes we had my cousin. He came there, another\none came. I see, yes, I did see a few but not too many.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, they were not. The only one that was in bad shape was my uncle's brother that I\nrecognized; I don't know how I did it. He came from Mauthausen and I told Harold, \"There\nis my uncle's brother.\" He said, \"You must be crazy.\" I said, \"No Harold.\" He lived in, he\ngot married in a different town so he used to come to my aunt. Once in a while if I was there\nI saw them, and sure enough it was him and we got together and he didn't walk away from us\nfor nothing. After all, his brother is my uncle, so.",
        "A: Let me tell you, in the camps, what they brought in from the concentration camps there were\npeople that they were guards in the camps, you know, and they used to call them kapos. You\nheard the name kapos? They used to take -- the partisans used to take those guys and\nclobber them. That's right, and then they would give them away to the American soldiers\nand let them handle them. Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: In one place we must have slept maybe 500 people were in one room, a big one, a real big\nroom. It was in Bologna or in Modena, I don't remember, and everybody slept on the floor.\nAll 500 and somebody had to go to the washroom so they went, but then on the way back\nthey don't know where their bunk is. Sometimes they came to the wrong place.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, I don't call it a, yeah, a DP camp.",
        "A: Yes. They gave you food to eat, you know. Yeah, they did.",
        "A: Yes, we were mixed all together. I mean, there was no different --",
        "A: Of course they did.",
        "A: No. Knowing what Hitler can do, I wasn't surprised of anything. But let me tell you one\nthing I know and I tell it to anybody, if you would not be fighting in a way, even though I\ndidn't, I personally didn't fight, or some other people, but if it wouldn't be for the fighters, we\nwould not survived. They would have killed us one by one. That's why I believe that people\nshould be ready and don't call me a, a killer. It's like, my husband says to me, \"You're\nalways afraid, even for a mouse. But you're not afraid for me. A fly you're afraid of, but not\nfor me.\" That's how much but no, no, no. If you're going to sit and do nothing, nothing will\nhappen, nothing will come good.",
        "A: No. No they didn't. Some of them got infections, gangrene, and died. Some of them had the\ntyphoid and died, and some of them got killed in the battle fighting. So there it is.",
        "A: My husband has, had two uncles, three uncles and an aunt in Chicago so we changed our\nmind and we came here.",
        "A: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "A: I am, I have mixed emotions. I really mean it. Why were we killed, for what? And if you\nask the rabbis that were sitting along the highway to wait to be killed, yes, ask them, they\nused to say we are the fortunate because they are going. We're going to have a tough life left\nof us, you understand. So, that's why I said I don't know. Sometimes it's good and\nsometimes-- now I'll say that much. I'm not a worldly person. I'm not educated to the point,\nyou know, where you can make a difference, but I think we Jews make our own problems. I\ngot, even though I'm wearing glasses, I can see very far and very good. I really mean it. Tell\nme something. Now I'll ask you a question. How come three million of the Jews were from\nPoland? Hungary started in '43 they started to take them. Now why?\nCzechoslovakia didn't have it as bad either in comparison to the amount of Jews they had\nthere. Didn't die as many as by us. They didn't kill them as much. How come Poland's got\nthree million and all the rest of the thirty little countries has three millions? Can you tell me?\nThat's 31 countries. Well, that's a good question, can you answer me that? Well I don't\nknow. I'm not that smart and if, maybe I'll tell you. Maybe this generation. See Polish Jews\nwere different than the Jews from Russia, even though they were locked up. We were\ndifferent people, Hungary, Romania I don't know. Still better than Poland. Polish Jews I\nthink are different all together, and I have a feeling this is why they killed three millions out\nof the Poles, Polish Jews. How come all the camps were in Poland? Most of the camps\nwere in Poland. You tell me why? And why they did not take from our sides, from Ukraine\nand Byelorussiadat, you know, that part. They didn't take us to concentration camps. Some\nof them fell in so that by I don't know by what. They needed so many people or something\nand they took them from one place and then they shipped them somewhere else so that\nmaybe they wind up in a concentration camp, but they did not come to this town and take out\nsO many on a train or whatever it is and send them to concentration camp. They used to\nmake in every city. You take Wilno, Pana (ph), Babi Yar, they killed them. I don't, you tell\nme why. Nobody can give me that answer.",
        "A: What can I tell you? We Jews are used to the pogroms, and pogroms, and pogroms. All of\nEurope, you know. That's why we ran away from Europe all together. We didn't want that\npart. Italy was a beautiful country and they were very nice to the Jews, even during the war.\nIf anybody had a business and left their manager run the business and if they did survive,\nthey got back the store. What did you get in Poland? And everybody -- Russians are in\nPoland, Germany, what for? I would make it a cemetery there. Itis. Anyway, a Jewish\ncemetery might as well be their cemetery too. Maybe I'm saying it wrong I don't know. I'm\nnot so smart but that's the way I feel. I don't like violence. It's not good, but if somebody\ngoes to kill me, I want to make sure I'll kill him first. This is my belief, but like I said.\nNobody can give me an answer why three million Polish Jews got killed.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n"
