        "Answer: Ah, yes. I was born as Isaac Klein. I\u2019m still planning \u2014 trying to get the\nexact date. Was in contact with the relevant offices in Poland, and somebody who is\ndoing research for it. Either in \u201926, 1926 or 1927, May the 30\". About May the 30\",\nI am sure.",

        "A: No, I have lived in Sieradz. Two older brothers. That I \u2014 I may be \u2014 and the out \u2014\nonset, I am the only one of the family left, there was a large family. But at the end of\nthe war, there was no one left but I. I know that because we have decided that\nwhoever survives wherever, our contact 1s people we know, distant relatives in\nPalestine \u2014 at that time Palestine, Erat Israel, and there was \u2014 no one appeared\nRG-50.030*0580 4\nexcept myself.

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 could you describe th \u2014 your family?",
        "A: My grandmother, grandfather, it looked to me like my f-family have lived many\ngenerations in the city, but this probably is a child\u2019s perception. Maybe it was the\nfirst generation; to me it was people who were settled there from who knows when,\nen antiquity. Where my grandfather, my grandmother had Alimarat(ph) and\nHannah. Hannah who had seven sons. My father was the oldest, Shmuel(ph), and\n\u2014 and then there were still two daughters. So, nine children all together, then older,\nextended family, the spouses and my cousins. And I am aware of many other names,\nfrom letters, photographs, occasional visits from out of town.",
        "Q: Well, d-do \u2014 do letters that you still have today, or those are the letters that you\nremember from the pre-war time?",
        "A: No, I think too many times I was, like I had to undress and throw all my \u2014\nwhatever I had and start from the beginning with \u2014 with nothing from before. I have\na picture of my family, it survived \u2014 it survived in someone\u2019s hands in Palestine,\nand I think that I have it on me.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, that\u2019s great.\nRG-50.030*0580 5",
        "A: Myself, there were two brothers, much older, and I. They perished as partisans,\nand a book depicts what they were doing, a book which was published in New\nYork, that was \u201cFrom the Forest.\u201d",
        "Q: So where \u2014 where were they, as partisans? Wh-What region?",
        "A: Originally \u2014 well, I just know that it was \u2014 they were in an area which was a\u2014a\npart of Poland once, taken over by the \u2014 by the Russians. The Russians put them on\na train, that\u2019s what I learned from others, because they register to come back, the\nRussians considered this a risky element of people, because they want to go back to\nGermany. They wanted to go back to Germany to fetch my parents and I. But all\nthat train was sent to Siberia. Would they have stayed, they would maybe survived.\nAs it is they ran away from the train, into the forest, hiding from the Russians,\nstarting to fight the Germans, even before the \u2014 officially the partisan organization\nwas \u2014 was known, or whatever \u2014 ever ge \u2014 organized.",
        "Q: So someone survived, who co \u2014",
        "A: One person su-survived, consider that, and he was later able to write about that,\nand that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how I learned that my brothers didn\u2019t die in \u2014 1n the conditions I\nexperienced, that they were fighting til the end. And this is the one [indecipherable]\nthat I can accept.",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what is your recollection of \u2014 what was \u2014 what was your father and\nyour mother doing, what were they doing before the war?\nRG-50.030*0580 6",
        "A: My \u2014 my father was a \u2014 a merchant, and my mother was home. We \u2014 I think my\nparents had to be careful with money, those were the times, and it was very often\ncoming up when I heard that they were worrying about tuition to \u2014 for me to\ncontinue education.",
        "Q: Well, he was \u2014 your father was a merchant?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: D-Do you recall what was he dealing in?",
        "A: Oh, he dealt for the area, I think, the soap maida,(ph) cosmetics of maida(ph).\nAt another \u2014 at another time, my grandparents had the wholesale grocery store, and\nfor awhile my parents were running also a similar store on the same street. My\nbrothers were \u2014 my oldest brother was in a hafshara(ph) in Rovno. And he was\nslated to go to \u2014 to Israel. Shell sided, lost his glasses in one of the battles and\ncouldn\u2019t see any more, was one of the first killed as a result.",
        "Q: Oh. So, he was already in that area, in Volhynia, in Rovno before the war, so this\nwas \u2014",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 yes, he was. But in the meantime he came to Sieradz during\nthe time they \u2014 th-the picture which I had was taken, this was the occasion. And\nwhen the war broke out, the family was together in Sieradz.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, so your brothers as well?\nRG-50.030*0580 7",
        "A: My brothers as well. This is \u2014 we were living Sieradz, as close to the German\nborder. We were advised to go to a forest in Zdunska Wola, six kilometers away to\navoid gas attacks, that\u2019s how World War I finished, and this was the big fear. But\nthe Germans have advanced \u2014 this was supposed to be an outing of a few hours,\ndaylight only, and at night we\u2019ll return. The Germans moved so quickly that we\ncouldn't go back, only we had to continue and march to Zdunska Wola. We\u2019re there\nwhen \u2014 when Zdunska Wola was attacked by bombing and two of my grandparents\ndied. We were just where they were sheltering in Zdunska Wola. My mother and I\nvisited them, and we left, there was an alarm when we \u2014 noise, when we looked\nback, the house in which they were was demolished. They were in the basement, and\nit went all three floors, so they were the first dead in the family.",
        "Q: And it \u2014 that happened in the very first days of September of 1939?",
        "A: And \u2014 in days. I believe it was a Sunday and ah \u2014 I know that because somebody\nspeculated that they probably wanted to catch as many civilians as possible in one\nplace, and initially went after the churches or whatever. The roads were machine-\ngunned and bombed, and it was \u2014 they were \u2014 they were making the road impass \u2014\nim \u2014 impassable. After one of those attacks, we couldn\u2019t find my brothers.\nNevertheless, they \u2014 they survived that first period, came to Sieradz, left for Russia\nto \u2014 to create a way for us to follow.\nRG-50.030*0580 8",
        "Q: And do you recall it was, you know, they were going to \u2014 to the Russian zone? It\nwas planned with your parents when they still were in Sieradz?",
        "A: Yes, we came to Sieradz, but the Germans were living in \u2014 in our house. A \u2014 a\nrelative left Lodz to go to Warsaw, family Eckstein(ph), I believe, from Poganica.\nAnd they have \u2014 we lived \u2014 we lived in their house. This was \u2014 the house was on\nPiotrkowska 82, which was the first street called Adolf Hitler Strasse, and the\nmain street in L\u00e9dz. And the first street to be cleaned of Jews. So we were put into\nthe ghetto at the very beginning, as it started, I don\u2019t remember the date, was it\nSeptember, or whatever.",
        "Q: I\u2014I just have few more questions that want to fill up \u2014",
        "A: Specific, yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 with \u2014 with the \u2014 with your pre-war time, and then please don\u2019t \u2014 because w-we\n\u2014 the point that we are at, it\u2019s very good. Your family was \u2014 what \u2014 what language\nwas spoken in your family, if you remember?",
        "A: It \u20141t was Yiddish and Polish. I was the \u2014 the exception. I was spoken only in\nPolish. I had a teacher, I had Mrs. Viner(ph) Tova(ph) whose husband was a\nhistorian, and she was a known Polish poet. And she thought that I have potential\nwith rhymes and \u2014 or whatever, I think. And she actually talked to my parents to \u2014\nnot to involve me in another language, chayder or otherwise, in order to keep my\nPolish intact.\nRG-50.030*0580 9",
        "Q: Do \u2014 do you still speak Polish, right?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Do you s \u2014 you still speak Polish?",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I still s-speak Polish, yes. I don\u2019t have much of an opportunity.",
        "Q: So, going back to \u2014 to the be \u2014 the beginning of the war \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014if\u2014if I recall what you said, and 1 \u2014 just to summarize, you \u2014 1n the beginning\nyou were told \u2014 th-the family was told to go into the woods outside of Sieradz \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 because of the fear of the \u2014 the gas attack \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and you landed close to Zdunska Wola.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And from there \u2014",
        "A: Six kilometers.",
        "Q: And from \u2014 and then Zdunska Wola was bombed, your grandparents were\nkilled, and then you went back to Sieradz.",
        "A: Not my grandparents. I believe to \u2014 this was the sister of my grandmother.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, the sister of your grandmother.",
        "A: Yeah, I think so.\nRG-50.030*0580 10",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Who was in that house that was bombed?",
        "A: Only them. That\u2019s \u2014 the people Zdunska Wola extended their hospitality to the\npeople who came from Sieradz. So the family that came was in different places,\ndepends who seen you, or who volunteered and so on.",
        "Q: And from there you went back to Sieradz?",
        "A: Oh no, not yet.",
        "Q: No, okay.",
        "A: From \u2014 from there we started to take ahead of the Germans. Terrible exposure,\nright away people killed, maimed, horses and the deaths \u2014 those are circumstance on\nwhich my brother and us separated and couldn\u2019t find each other. And we continued\nthat way just ahead of the Germans, til Warsaw. And we went through the\nbombardment of Warsaw, at which point th \u2014 a German unit rounded up the men\nand \u2014 young men and men in general, and was starting to marching them back in the\ndirection of L\u00e9dz. Who \u2014 already in that early date, who cannot \u2014 who couldn\u2019t keep\nup, was shot and left on the side of the road in a rainy ditch. My mother and I\nseparated. She was on the left ditch, I was on the right ditch, in order to facilitate\nfaster kind of search, if between the killed there is our father, you know, we \u2014 we\nmet the father when we caught up with \u2014 with the main group of men. So \u2014 so, you\nknow, it \u2014 it didn\u2019t finish with that first trek, to [indecipherable] if anything it was\nan \u2014 the beginning of a \u2014 a harrowing experience. The people in one of the places\nRG-50.030*0580 11\nwere Jews who got the Germans somehow to agree to feed the people. I don\u2019t\nremember what \u2014 what town it was. A cow was slaughtered and \u2014 and everyone was\nfed, including us, children, family and so on. And we continued \u2014 and I don\u2019t know\nwhere we continued because I begged a German soldier to allow my father not to\ncontinue, with my few words of German. I went in the house [indecipherable] and\n\u2014 and he allowed my father to stay in one of those places as we move on, so I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to the main group. But my father remained, and that\u2019s when\nwe returned to Sieradz to find the Germans in our house. That\u2019s when we came to\nLodz and found ourselves in \u2014 in a get \u2014 a ghetto life.",
        "Q: In Piotrkowska Street.",
        "A: Yeah. As a matter of fact, wh-what\u2019s happening now, I don\u2019t think that I \u2014 that I\never put it together in sequence, there \u2014 there are always scraps of memories.",
        "Q: Well, you just put in sequence, so that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 and here you \u2014 here you \u2014 you \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 this \u2014 this is perfect.",
        "A: \u2014 asked me in sequence, yeah.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014 I-I think that this is very clear now that we have that in sequence \u2014",
        "A: Yes, okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 cause this is important. So, probably at the end of September, you landed in the\n\u2014 L\u00e9dz in \u2014 in Piotrkowska, would you agree with that?\nRG-50.030*0580 12",
        "A: I didn\u2019t read, or I didn\u2019t read much at all, and they just gave me \u2014 so, I wouldn\u2019t\nknow. I know that when the ghetto \u2014 when the people with the ghetto things started,\nand the Germans came, and to \u2014 and to speed up the process shot a number of people\non Piotrkowska, where we were, we didn\u2019t stay around.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You were already in the ghetto, so that means \u2014",
        "A: No, no, we were \u2014 we were \u2014",
        "Q: Still on the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we moved to the ghetto, but we were between the first.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Because the \u2014 the creation of the ghetto was in \u2014 around March of 1940,\nSO \u2014",
        "A: Ah, I\u2014 I thought in \u2014 I thought that maybe we were \u2014 we were there a little bit\nbefore, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay. And you do remember the moving to the ghetto?",
        "A: I remember the moving of the ghetto, and things which emanated from \u2014 my very\nlife was saved at one point because of us staying on Piotrkowska 82. But this 1s \u2014\nthis 1s further in this story.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So it\u2019s \u2014 so, around March of 1940, you are already in the ghetto, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you recall where you lived in the ghetto?\nRG-50.030*0580 13",
        "A: Yes. We first got the house on Gnieznnienska. It will be a handful for you,\nGnieznnienska, yeah. Gnieznnienska \u2014 what language is my answer? Gnieznni \u2014\nGnieznnienska 29. This was near the wires. We were assigned \u2014 we were assigned\na room, a one room not heated. Two beds, iron beds. And while the ghetto was being\norganized, and the houses were \u2014 were given \u2014 were kind of being distributed, which\nagain played a role in my \u2014 another survival. Yeah, I was hesitant what I thor \u2014\nwhatever I would have, because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s like cinema, you know, like \u2014 like\nsomething is going to happen, and \u2014 and \u2014 and in the last minute something turns \u2014\nturns it around. So only when I look at it I say, I would hardly believe so many\nthings happening to so many people. Nevertheless, when I came to Israel on a \u2014 on\na ship, we were maybe a thousand of boys, we were more or less, all of us had the\nsimilar story. Many instances of survival against odds.",
        "Q: So, when you landed at Gnieznnienska, that was your father, your mother and\nyou, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In this, and you were in that room. Do you recall whether you went to school at\nall when you lived on Piotrkowska?",
        "A: I was vaguely a-aware that there was school, but I haven\u2019t been in \u2014 1n the school\ni-in the ghetto. It\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Also, before the ghetto, you were not in school?\nRG-50.030*0580 14",
        "A: N-No, no, definitely not. There was only a very short time before \u2014",
        "Q: Right",
        "A: \u2014 before the ghetto between.",
        "Q: So, do you recall anything from the early days o-of your life in the ghetto on\nGnieznnienska\u2019?",
        "A: Oh yes. Yes, I do remember. This was not the only address. We had to move and\nmove again. We were on Zgierska, right \u2014 right near the bridge. That\u2019s Koscielny.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But we were fortunate because on Gnieznnienska there was just a sidewalk and\nthe wires [indecipherable] of the ghetto. And we had to be careful on this side of\nthe sidewalk. Nobody was walking there, incidentally. Our window was\n[indecipherable] out, and also there was \u2014 there was ice on the walls, and I got\nsomething which they thought 1s \u2014 is tuberculosis. They checked me out, I didn\u2019t\nhave tuberculosis, but we \u2014 we \u2014 we were transferred in some way to that other\nhousing on \u2014 on, I believe number \u2014 Zgierska number maybe 40, I\u2019m not sure. A\nsmall time, for a short period. My \u2014 my next address after this was Rumkowski\u2019s\nhouse. It was on [indecipherable]",
        "Q: It was on Lagiewnicka.",
        "A: Lagiewnicka [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right, yeah.\nRG-50.030*0580 15",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, what \u2014 what were \u2014 were \u2014 were your parents employed, or were you\nemployed in the ghetto?",
        "A: My \u2014 my f-father was employed, but he was getting weaker, and\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you recall where was he employed?",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he was that labor which they had, let\u2019s say at one time say they \u2014 they\nhad to oblige people to dig in for potatoes for the winter and things like that, as it\nwas atriving. This \u2014 this was a very difficult experience for him, for all of us,\nbecause he felt this was killing him, because he knew the swelling was going up and\nup, which is very characteristic of the way people died in the ghetto, as you know.\nAnd I \u2014I got a job on a kosa(ph), which means sewing leather things, or whatever,\nrucksacks and so on, on [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and this \u2014 this provided enough\nfunds to buy \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to pay for our rations or whatever, which was \u2014 didn\u2019t play\naround, but working \u2014 working I was \u2014 where I received the soup, which I was able\nto share with my mother.",
        "Q: And your mother \u2014 your mother stayed home?",
        "A: I\u2014I cannot remember my mother being employed outside of home, I didn\u2019t even\nthink about that. But was she ever doing something?\nRG-50.030*0580 16",
        "Q: So, do you remember any \u2014 any contacts with your peers there, other people your\nage in the ghetto, or \u2014 or you were spending most of the time with the family?",
        "A: Yesterday I came here to show my family they \u2014 I have grandchildren. They are\ntriplets, they are 14 years old now. And \u2014 and \u2014 and I was trying to get to \u2014 that\u2019s\nwhat it is, I am \u2014 I am being \u2014 my head 1s being kidnapped to \u2014 to memories as I talk\nto you, and all at once, where was I?",
        "Q: We were \u2014",
        "A: I would \u2014 I am tal \u2014 talking about \u2014 about friends, and because I was here\nyesterday, and \u2014 and the magic happened all at once. I have a number from\nAuschwitz. It\u2019s the smallest number anyone ever seen, and there is a circumstance\nwhy the number is so miniature it\u2019s hard to read. And I say, is this the number,\nB11104. And it\u2019s one \u2014 because I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere when I looked for my\npresence in Auschwitz, and \u2014 and then \u2014 and the person who was \u2014 who was helping\nme just did her little magic, and my number jumped out from Auschwitz so\n[indecipherable]. And \u2014 and then I ask, my very next thing, to answer your question\nin a roundabout way, was that I was looking for a boy named [indecipherable] who\nwas where I was working on a kosa, the son of \u2014 of a well-to-do family before the\nwar. A small, a haseek(ph), small but fierce, with a \u2014 with a sense of fairness,\nwatching [indecipherable]. If he can help it, unfair things will not be happening. He\ncame with me when my father was \u2014 when my f\u2014 mother sent someone to say that\nRG-50.030*0580 17\nmy father is dying, he came with me, he stuck with me, I love him. I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to him. He was smaller than I, that means I can\u2019t be sure that he was\nkilled. I \u2014 I\u2019ve had \u2014 I had more \u2014 more people, needless to say. In addition to that, I\ngot very close to a group of pe \u2014 of youngsters. Those who were in a \u2014 in an\norphanage in the ghetto, a small orphanage. [indecipherable] well, 1t was on\n[indecipherable]. It was somewhere 1n the Marysin, and those became my friends,\nthose became the people I have spend my time on while I was with Dora, Dora\nFuchs, as kind of prot\u00e9g\u00e9e or whatever you call it. And have seen her \u2014 have seen\nthem day by day, that they are \u2014 I remember them all, some of them I like.",
        "Q: So this is the \u2014 so going back to the \u2014",

        "A: Yes. Anyhow, so \u2014 so he was involved and my daughter and I visited for three\ndays in Poland, just to look for my father\u2019s bones. At that time, although the \u2014 the\nPoles had an organization which they would find the bones and send, but most of the\ntime those were just bones. And \u2014 but research was going on, and it was possible\nbecause when \u2014 when people were buried, th-there was \u2014 there was a little piece of\nwood put in. Right after the war, while the wood was still there undisturbed, some\npeople came and put a standardized stone on this place with a name, which was a\nRG-50.030*0580 20\nstone or \u2014 or \u2014 or cement, or whatever. And now it was possible to extrapolate from\nthis na \u2014 the \u2014 a me \u2014 by measurement, who was buried, the rest. What \u2014 what was\nthe \u2014 very, very, very sad t-to \u2014 to me, because when we were looking at those\nbooks, the people who were entering the books, their handwriting was getting\nslighter and slighter. Not enough strength to \u2014 to \u2014 to write with the \u2014 with the right\npressure. So, that\u2019s the time, yeah.",

        "A: But I don\u2019t know if she was born in Konin. I \u2014 I tried to find her name, and so far\ndid not. May I ask you a question which may not relate to the \u2014 the particular thing\nthat we \u2014 Iam \u2014 I am looking, an-and in touch with someone in Poland. In order to\nget the \u2014 the birthdays, the birthdays of \u2014 of the members of my family, I can\u2019t \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know when they died, but they perished in the Holocaust. And I \u2014 and I want\nto \u2014 to engrave the names, since I am the only survivor and I will be the last there,\nbut just what I would have done with my time during \u2014 and it\u2019s difficult to get it\nfrom Poland, talking in Zdunska Wola when I was looking at the Yizkor thing\nlately, then [indecipherable] said the Zdunska Wola people have an Yizkor. But\nthere is also a mention that they had to go to Sieradz, which was the capital city, or\nwhatever, district city, in order to get it, and Sieradz told him, okay, you \u2014 you can\ndo it for your Jewish community, which was, if you also do it for the Sieradz\ncommunity. So\u2014so a Zdunska Wola book may now be at a [indecipherable] but\nit\u2019s slow digging, and I wonder \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 22",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: We also have in our library here, our Yizkor books, and I know that there is a \u2014\nif I recall, it\u2019s \u2014 there is a separate Yizkor book for \u2014 for Zdunska Wola, if I recall\nit well.",
        "A: Y-Y-Yes.",
        "Q: So, we can \u2014 we can revisit that, you know, aft \u2014 after our conversation here.",
        "A: This \u2014 this 1s \u2014 this 1s my hope, and \u2014 and a big part of my motivation in coming\nhere, that in one of your departments this will be possible. I went to the consul and \u2014\nand \u2014 twice in \u2014 in Montreal, and they tell me that I have to fill it out in triplicate\nand it will take at least one year, a-and what is the exact spelling, cause they will not\nbe able to find. All \u2014 all those things I didn\u2019t have available. And I met a consul in a\nsocial setting later on, I wrote it up, and he says, yeah, this 1s \u2014 this 1s like a big, big,\nbig task. At the same time, Enjay(ph), a \u2014 a new Polish writer, got in touch with me\nabout something, he wrote a book. Enjay(ph) Vart(ph), a new promising Polish\nwriter and he said he \u2014 he loves Sieradz, and if I need something for \u2014 for him or\nwhatever, he will \u2014 he will go, but I didn\u2019t want to impose on him, because there\nmay be a \u2014 really a bit of work to sort it out.

        "A: I\u2014Ihope for it, to \u2014 to give you a picture of me now, I am a heart patient. I\ncannot get health insurance. But being a heart patient doesn\u2019t stop me from\nwindsurfing \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 together with the youngsters, and so on. But at the same time, once you have a\nlook at the number of operations or medications that I am taking that \u2014 that keeps me\nactive, I\u2019d say you don\u2019t want to insure. The only exception in 11 years, was to\nRG-50.030*0580 24\ncome here.

        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: So the \u2014 this is the \u2014 but it \u2014 this 1s quite, I must say, uplifting, what you just said,\nthat, with your windsurfing and all that thing. I wish that we all did such an active\nlife \u2014 lead active life. Going back to the \u2014 to the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes.",

And \u2014 and once they \u2014 once they do \u2014\ndo that, and after separating children from grownups, taking away a number of the\ngrownups, my mother wasn\u2019t to be found any more.

She was in the window on the second\nfloor, I saw her. And a feat I couldn\u2019t duplicate ever since, whenever I see\nsomething that will be thrown directly on \u2014 in this direction, can I do it? I threw the\nbread and it came straight into her, and \u2014 and I [indecipherable] and she was\nworrying what will happen, talking to another woman, I heard every word. What\nwill happen to Adusha(ph)? I was Adusha(ph), a diminutive. But what \u2014 what \u2014",
        "Q: At that time you were 16 years old, 16 or 15, right?",

        "Q: So you were not taken to \u2014 with \u2014 with the other children, right?",
        "A: My \u2014 the \u2014 th-the wife of my uncle from Poganica was in the ghetto in \u2014 in the \u2014\nin those listings of pop \u2014 and movements of population and so on. And I had a\ncousin my age, approximately, and I\u2014 we were \u2014 we were \u2014 we were changing\nRG-50.030*0580 26\ndates. He was changing our dates all over the place, til I \u2014 til I got complicated with\nthose dates, and \u2014 and used the date which is convenient. And it bothered me,\nbecause you know, like sometimes you have to say [indecipherable] and I wish that\nI rather wouldn\u2019t be asked, and only after searching til I myself was this \u2014 searching,\nI \u2014 I \u2014I knew that I can extrapolate, ho \u2014 wh-when did I go to school, and when did\nI this \u2014 so I narrow it down to 20 \u2014 26 or 27, those \u2014 those two years, and \u2014 and then,\nbecause I \u2014 I also had the \u2014 a larger difference at the time which I was using, have \u2014\nhave documents, have life insurance on that and so on. And people told me just\nnobody is interested in your exact age, but \u2014 but I felt uncomfortable. So I am started\nthinking about now finally.",

        "A: My grandfather had a white beard. He was in the city, I believe, like for a time,\ncounselor or whatever. Spoke Polish. It was quite a circus, because this is the\nobviously Jewish man with a kippah around head, opening up in the middle of\nYiddish, and \u2014 and so on. And Polish to his different customers, and \u2014 and turning to\nme and \u2014 and talking in literary Polish, yeah.",

        "A: Yes. Do I remember?",
        "Q: Yeah, how far before that?",
        "A: Oh, all \u2014 all the time, but at \u2014 at the very beginning of \u2014 of the \u2014 of the ghetto,\nthere was optimism. We survived the shootings and the housings and so on. There\nwas enough food. Dark bread, very heavy, oil, enough oil. Some kind of a\nkashatsing(ph), and \u2014 and a biting optimism that the war is \u2014 1s just about to finish.\nAnd ther \u2014 there were no work, no factories organize yet, nothing. There was leisure.\nBut there were cultural evenings, and \u2014 and the cultural evenings, every\nRG-50.030*0580 28\nneighborhood \u2014 every neighborhood had the \u2014 had, you know, displaying whoever\nthey can, someone on an instrument, or someone this. I was pushed to read my\npoetry, so I did. It\u2019s \u2014 later on, it saved my life.",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 do you remember, or do you \u2014 were you able to recreate any of your\npoetry?",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014I was asked so many \u2014 there was be-bef-before \u2014 before the war there was\n[indecipherable] or something, a newspaper, which also has a section for the\nyoung, and for teenagers, or whatever. So I was a couple of time published there.\nAnd \u2014 and I remember this better, but in \u2014 in the ghetto, I didn\u2019t know what I was\nwriting, but the adults made the [indecipherable] to what I was writing, and they\nmade \u2014 th-they made like that they were thinking about that, as simple as there 1s,\nthere is a peasant and \u2014 and he \u2014 he seed \u2014 seeds of all kind of things. When those\nseeds grow up [indecipherable] this particular evil, a gardener and \u2014 and that \u2014\nwell, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s things like that.",

        "Q: \u2014I- you can say it in Polish.",
        "A: \u2014I am glad to forget them, because \u2014 because this was my ticket, that\u2019s what \u2014\nwhat kind of separated me from \u2014 from whatever, you know, like in school still, just\n\u2014 that\u2019s what it was. At \u2014 but I \u2014 I wrote spontaneously, I read and wrote before the\nRG-50.030*0580 29\nage of five, the age of five, just not learning formally, only reading \u2014 reading\nwhatever I could on the street, or wherever. So, there will be expectation. It was\ngetting quiet in the house when I was writing. Skindis(ph) schiven(ph), you know,\nI-I am going to this. And \u2014 and I \u2014 I\u2014I wrote for to make an impression. And \u2014 and\n\u2014 and I thought the time just I don\u2019t feel much, and that it\u2019s phony and \u2014 and later\nwhen \u2014 when a language had to be changed, I once, twice, three times, I \u2014 I seized \u2014\nI seized writing. But I have a \u2014 like everybody, sometimes everybody who is not\neducated, I have a creative streak, and that\u2019s how I made a li-living. And \u2014 and\ndesign of automation systems, things which don\u2019t exist yet. So \u2014 so I say yes, we \u2014\nmaybe every child 1s creative til public schooling knocks it out of him.",
        "Q: But you \u2014 do you think that any of your writings survived in the \u2014 in the\npublished form in the pre-war time you said about this Zev(ph) Nuardik(ph) \u2014",

You know,\nso some \u2014 some of that thinking, can something be taking out from a stack of\nnewspapers which were \u2014 which \u2014 which was done \u2014 it would be nice. I \u2014 I wonder\nRG-50.030*0580 30\nhow I would feel about \u2014 no, at that time, I was \u2014 I was writing because I felt like it,\nand the results were there. But later on I\u2014I\u2014",
        "Q: In the ghetto you were writing just to please \u2014",
        "A: Y-Yes. In \u20141n the ghetto that\u2019s how I survived, because of that. I will be able to\nrelate to you \u2014",
        "Q: Can you be more specific about this, cause 1\u2014 you referred [indecipherable]",
        "A: Y-Yeah, and it will also \u20141-1t will also maybe fit the narration of \u2014 of what\nhappened. On Piotrkowska 82, there was a \u2014 there was a family, their name was\nKrikos(ph), and she was a fashion designer, a known one, with international ties,\ntravels to [indecipherable] and so on. Her husband was taken away and killed in a\nprison. She remained alone and my father and I, my mother, were there helping her\nwith anything we could. I was \u2014 I was making sure that she has enough wood for the\nfireplace and things like that. Although it \u2014 it was just the beginning of the need of\nthe wood. In the \u2014 in the ghetto, we met at the beginning and \u2014 and then all at once\neverything got to be a problem, distance was a problem, time, energy mostly was a\nproblem, and so on. But she maintained \u2014 maintained contact with us, and aware to\nwhat\u2019s going on in our lives. She herself worked as one of the fashion designers or\nmanager in a Beschen(ph) \u2014 Beschen(ph) Kleider factory, one of six Beschen(ph)\nand Kleider factories. Now, when \u2014 when I brought the bread to my mother and I\ngave it to her, a Jewish policeman grabbed me, took me into \u2014 into an entrance of\nRG-50.030*0580 31\nthe house across Lagiewnicka and he beat me up. I was not supposed to be outside\non the street. And now I think maybe he saved my life at that time, because if I\nwould join them, I would be gone. But anyhow, it\u2019s \u2014 I was very humiliated. I think\nthis what hurt the most. And in the middle of the night, I went to \u2014 to M-Mrs.\nKrikosava(ph) where she lived in Marysin. A-And I told her what happened, and\ncan she either li \u2014 arrange for me to join my mother, or \u2014 or get my mother out of\nthat transport. I didn\u2019t hear much \u2014 much about that, but when my mother was\ntaking away, this was \u2014 this was my \u2014 oh, I t\u2014 I didn\u2019t feel that \u2014 that I want to go\non, especially. I wouldn\u2019t spend energy, I didn\u2019t have ener \u2014 I didn\u2019t go for my bread\nration, which is once in 10 days or something, which means death, dying, not \u2014 no \u2014\nand di\u2014 she appeared. And she took me to her office as a runner, in order to have a\nsoup a day, and to survive \u2014 to survive on that soup or whatever til \u2014 til the \u2014 til the\ntime comes for the regular allocation of food. And now \u2014 now my story gets\ninteresting, because as I was there, there was an inspection by the chief engi \u2014 by the\nchief of the Bescher(ph) and Kleider. To tell you also that when we came to the\nghetto, there was somebody who was distributing the apartments. The one who was\nthe manager of our area was a name by the name of Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph).\nBolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph) was now \u2014 was now in charge of those factories, and \u2014\nand Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph) is the one who entered, and he stopped near me,\nand kind of, I thought accusingly, he is ask me how do I \u2014 what do I know you f-\nRG-50.030*0580 32\nfrom? And I say, from the cultural evenings, because he was attending. So he \u2014 he\nwent ahead and I thought he 1s going to throw me out, he knows that this 1s\nfictitious, me being there, and eating the soup. But Krikosava(ph) followed, and\ntogether with other people, the manager, and she smiled to me, that me said nothing\nbad happened. And this continued for, I don\u2019t know, two or three days. After \u2014 after\nwhich, the droshka(ph) firm with Rumkowski with the white horse, stopped in the\nfront of the building, they called me out and they took me to Balucki Rynek. And\nBalucki Rynek was sitting Rumkowski, and on both side female secretaries and\npeople, and so on, and \u2014 and a \u2014 and they kind of \u2014- Rumkowski a-asked me a few\nwords, and the other people, and I z\u2014 I saw Anodinka(ph), the head, and I am being\ntaken to the house of Rumkowski, which was divided into four apartments. And in\napartment number one, was the apartment for Dora Fuchs. That\u2019s the first time I\nlearned about anybody like Dora Fuchs. Rumkowski, everybody sign \u2014 sings \u2014\nDora Fuchs was very often doing the things that they complained about, and that\nRumkowski fought against, but this wasn\u2019t known publicly, this I learned later. And\nBernard Fuchs, her brother, who died in Connecticut just a few years ago, his wife\nis still alive, Irena.",
        "Q: We \u2014- we do have an interview with \u2014 with him. You know, we conducted \u2014 he \u2014\nhe went by the name Bert Fleming.\nRG-50.030*0580 33",
        "A: Bert \u2014 Bert \u2014 Bert Fleming, yes, he found me. He found me when I was in\nFlorida at one time, an-and ...",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: He \u2014 he married Irena at that time, and a place became available for me. And\nthis was in Dora\u2019s \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Dora\u2019s apartment. So, although the house was \u2014 it\nwas a small house, Rumkowski, Jusef(ph) Rumkowski, Eric Yakobovitch\ndownstairs, Dora downstairs. Eric Yakobovitch had another house in Marysin, so\ndid Rumkowski, or whatever. So, I was given the place, my clothes were thrown\naway for a good reason. And people came to take measurements for my shoes, for\nmy pajamas, for my this, and so on. And all at once there was a \u2014 a \u2014 there was a \u2014\nfood, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and books. And that\u2019s how I came, because of Bolek(ph)\nbeing this \u2014 Rumkowski has given out a di-directive, I think, to the ones who are\nwell-off in the ghetto should \u2014 should adopt one of the \u2014 one of the children,\norphans, who remained orphans at that time. Dora was very much \u2014 very much\naware of what\u2019s the tone to give to herself and to her persona, and I was part of it,\nexcept I was in the house. In reality, I was mostly upstairs with Rumkowski,\nbecause there was a boy there, Stanislaw Stein(ph), not many people know about\nhim, and when I heard the story what happened to Rumkowski when he went to the\ncamp. They say that he \u2014 a brunette woman, younger woman, and a teenage boy,\nRG-50.030*0580 34\nblack hair, was on that open wagon, so I know yes, this must be the right version\nbecause this was Stanislaw, who wanted to come with Rumkowski.",
        "Q: Who was \u2014 who was Stanislaw, who was he?",
        "A: Stanislaw? He\u2019s a\u2014 he\u2019s a \u2014 his parents were dead, he \u2014 he was \u2014 he was a very\nquiet guy \u2014",
        "Q: Was he your age?",
        "A: \u2014 I was his only friend, I think. Pardon?",
        "Q: He was your age?",
        "A: He was younger.",
        "Q: Younger.",
        "A: And \u2014 and he had the Bar Mitzvah, as a matter of fact, at the beginning of 1944.",
        "Q: \u00b044.",
        "A: But things happened \u2014 happened in the meantime, and I \u2014 I did \u2014 that\u2019s not the\nfirst time that I did a self destructive thing, but I also did it at that time. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s a small item, but it\u2019s important because it took my train sideways towards not\nsurviving. And this was when I \u2014 the first time when \u2014 when Dora came home from\nwork, the same day, she passed without looking, she passed into her room. The\nhousekeeper brought a box of bonbons, and she said that I am a very nice boy, but\nshe wants \u2014 she wants to note that she\u2019s a very busy person, and she doesn\u2019t have\nany time away from her work. So it was \u2014 that means this \u2014 I didn\u2019t understand\nRG-50.030*0580 35\nexactly what it was, but there was food, and there was \u2014 and later \u2014 but \u2014 but I had\nmy idea with her moral \u2014",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: \u2014 more \u2014 more because she was such a good pretender. I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: So you \u2014 she \u2014 officially she was the one who adopted you, right? Dora Fuchs.",
        "A: It \u2014 it was never clear. It was floating in the air.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It was not \u2014 officially, I was sleeping in her place. Our \u2014 our lessons, the teacher,\nlunches and so on, were \u2014 were in upstairs in Rumkowski\u2019s study. When years,\nyears later I was in Tel Aviv, and there was an exhibition of things from the ghetto,\nand \u2014 and I recognized some of the things, and I said, I have never been to the Tel\nAviv University Museum of \u2014 of whatever, so how can it be that I say I have been\nhere? No, I haven\u2019t been there. So \u2014 but then I remember. Every time Stanislaw and\nI, we had to have our lessons, he would \u2014 he would \u2014 we would have to take off the\ntable all kind of gift that Rumkowski was getting all the time. Ta \u2014 they sang\n[indecipherable] to him, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was the greatest man in history. I \u2014 I think\nthat there are very few people in the world who can withstand endlessly that kind of\nflattery. With engravings, with here and there. We had to take off that things almost\nen masse, and put it \u2014 put it on the side to have place to do our lessons in his study.\nAnd we don\u2019t know if somebody put it back for his attention or not. No, 1t was \u2014 it\nRG-50.030*0580 36\nwas a job by itself just to follow \u2014 a \u2014a portrait of his would hang on the wall, and \u2014\nand a little item would be there, and the \u2014 the rest was a big accumulation. So our \u2014\nour teachers were Dr. Rabiner(ph) Berliner(ph) from \u2014 from \u2014 from doctor \u2014 Dr.\nRabiner(ph) Berliner(ph) from \u2014 a \u2014 a place in germa \u2014 Hannover, maybe. I\u2019m \u2014\nI\u2019m not sure. Dr. Rabiner(ph) Berliner(ph), he said that his wife has her dates til\nthis from the Spanish Inquisition still, his wife has a \u2014 this 1s \u2014 there was somebody\nfrom the \u2014",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what was he teaching you, the \u2014 the Dr. Berliner(ph)?",
        "A: Logic, math, German, things like that. They were \u2014 they were a \u2014 a calibr \u2014 a\ncaliber which is th \u2014 which is that they should have the graduate students there.\nWhat we are studying was very \u2014 he was applying himself like to everything. He\nwas applying himself, he was solid.",
        "Q: So Stasiuk(ph) was \u2014 was he \u2014 he was adopted by Rumkowski?",
        "A: He was eventually adopted, because in my case, my mother was taken away, but\ncouldn\u2019t say that my mother is dead. This \u2014 in the ghetto we didn\u2019t know, and the\npeople who knew, knew. This is number one. Number two, I will get it off my \u2014 my\nmind, but there was when \u2014 when Mrs. \u2014 when the Fuchses \u2014 the father Fuchs was a\ntailor, when \u2014 when the Fuchses came \u2014 came to \u2014 to L\u00e9dz, to the ghetto, a family\ntook care of them. And th-the family, this was Fryman(ph), and they provided\nwork, lodgings and so on for them. When they moved to the ghetto, Mrs.\nRG-50.030*0580 37\nFryman(ph), Mr. Fryman(ph) and Dora Fuchs and her father were there, and \u2014 and\nthose were the people who came with them, and were part of the people. And to \u2014\njust to be converted very, very quickly and forcefully into being the housekeeper,\ninto being like the maid and so on. She often cried, and I often talked to her. I was\nstill not to familiarize with the help, but Mrs. \u2014 Mrs. Fryman(ph) went to a doctor,\nand she had to go to a doctor maybe because she didn\u2019t want that Dora should know\nthat she went to a doctor at all, you know. And there was a louse, and she was bitten,\nand she had \u2014 and she had Fleck \u2014",
        "Q: Typhus.",
        "A: \u2014 Fleck typhus, yes.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Now, what happened at that time, said \u2014 this had t-to be announced to the\nGermans, and it was \u2014 when it was told to Beebow(ph), Krieger was their mark,\nKrieger was there, and \u2014 and he tried to remodel it and says, oh, this is Mrs.\nFryman(ph) from [indecipherable] or something. He says, she\u2019s [indecipherable]\nfor Frau Fryman(ph). And now many people were working Germans on the boats\nhere [indecipherable] and they were \u2014 and they were Baltic Germans, they were not\nvery clean very often. And Dora was afraid if anybody [indecipherable] sick, that\nwill get back to her. And she started an orgy of dressmaking. All kinds of dress \u2014\never \u2014 everything had to be crisp, crisp, white colors and so on, in order to project\nRG-50.030*0580 38\nthat meticulous, meticulous, meticulous freshness and \u2014 and cleanliness. People\ndidn\u2019t understand what was the whole thing, but I knew because I from inside the\nhouse. Not the end of the story because Mrs. Fryman(ph) was getting worse and\nworse, and \u2014 and eventually was dying. And Dora says that God had her\n[indecipherable]. God \u2014 God \u2014 God punish her for the problems she \u2014 she did \u2014 she\n\u2014 she did to me. And I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t look at her after that. This was \u2014 I was\npretending, but \u2014 but I was defensive.",
        "Q: So Mrs. Fryman(ph) and \u2014 and her husband, they were in L\u00e9dz.",
        "A: They were in L\u00e9dz. Mr. Fryman(ph), I once saw him in a bus passing by in Tel\nAviv. He wouldn\u2019t be alive now. He married the housekeeper of Eric Yakobovitch.\nEric Yakobovitch was in charge of all the \u2014 all the industry in the ghetto.",

        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: So what \u2014 if \u2014 what was your, if you can recall to put 1t in some kind of a frame\nafter \u2014 this is after the gaspara(ph), right?\nRG-50.030*0580 39",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: No-no \u2014 no, no, no, I didn't notice. I \u2014 I haven\u2019t explored yet, and I \u2014 I doubt that\n[indecipherable]",

        "A: And the \u2014 the \u2014 the next \u2014 the \u2014 the next thing 1s the \u2014 the television is quite\nsuccessful with the lives of the rich and the famous and things like that. Well, there\nwere the rich and the famous in the ghetto, but they were not exactly the people that\none expected they were. Even it was Stasiuk(ph) and I, and Marisha(ph)\nMazur(ph), a daughter of \u2014 of a doctor, would be \u2014 would be coached by Mrs. Dr.\nEliasburg(ph), in things like rhythmic. Like, she would play the piano and we\nwould go with sticks, and things like that. This was \u2014 this was in the ghetto as part of\n\u2014 of they considered the \u2014 the \u2014 the right thing to do and so on, and it was \u2014 it was\nkind of mindless, but what may be a surprise 1s that Rumkowski\u2019s house was\nmodest. His \u2014 his wife was \u2014 was nice, intelligent. Well, no matter how she was\ncoming through, I only saw with \u2014 not from Helena Rumkowski, who was a\nbattleaxe, but she was a \u2014 a\u2014 she was \u2014 I th \u2014 I think that they were going to the\ndentist, Dr. Smolowicz(ph), or Stolowicz(ph), who was a man who had a \u2014 a radio\nin the ghetto, which I didn\u2019t find out til Bernard Fuchs have \u2014 have to located me,\nand said \u2014 said an interview here, a kind of, you know, people didn\u2019t understand. I \u2014\nI told him, what do you expect? You kick people. So he went ahead, run ahead of his\nwife and I, you know, to live with that, that I came. He wanted me to say that he was\na nice person. He had nice \u2014 some of the nice qualities, some of them not, and I\nwasn\u2019t shy in telling him, he shouldn\u2019t be surprised why people saw what they saw\nand reacted to what he saw. And he better lives with that, he did.\nRG-50.030*0580 41",
        "Q: Going back to Marisha(ph) Mazur(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Oh, that \u2014 that Marisha(ph) Mazur(ph)? No, she was \u2014 she were \u2014 only came for\nthe \u2014",
        "Q: For the tutoring.",
        "A: For the tutoring, yeah. And of \u2014 of \u2014 of this \u2014 of this thing. N-Not tutoring in\nanything else. Her father was a known specialist which was brou \u2014 brought into the\nghetto from Warsaw in order to take care of Rumkowski\u2019s conditions. Something\nlara \u2014 laran [indecipherable]. There \u2014 there was \u2014 Dora Fuchs was doing like big\ndinners where I had to read my poetry, that I didn\u2019t feel like writing, and I didn't feel\nanything; but this was it, now it was me, I was sitting next to her, and the time was\ncoming traditionally to me. And of course, I didn\u2019t matter at all. At one time \u2014 at one\ntime, and \u2014 and I say it because m \u2014 because it \u2014 it \u2014 it will be so uncharacteristic of\nwhat people think. In the evening, one evening, Gertler is coming. Strutting Gertler\nwas the head of the police. And he 1s strutting in and the two people \u2014 the three\npeople outside, because there was already Gingka(ph), who was also coming to help\nout in the household. There were only three people in the household. There were \u2014\nthere were only at \u2014 most of the time, two people, Dora and I. And he comes in and\nRG-50.030*0580 42\n\u2014 and he \u2014 they started to bring in chocolate, and or-or-oranges, newspapers,\ncognacs, and all kind of drinks like that. Dora is going, Eric Yakobovitch and the \u2014\nthe brother, Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch wouldn\u2019t fit, he wasn\u2019t on the right level. So\nBeebow(ph) comes in, and meantime, while waiting for Beebow(ph), Dora is\nasking \u2014 asking Gertler, Dawid, how did you manage it? And he opens this, and he\nsays, inspector for the Gestapo. This was \u2014 this was Dawid Gertler, he was going\naround giving people something to eat, or whatever, and he was considered like an\nextraordinary fine person. But I know that people were killed all the time because of\nhim, and he knows what\u2019s going on here. I know about what was written on his\npapers, because he [indecipherable] a very valuable, or extraordinary valuable Jew,\nsomething like that. He had a nice wife, he adopted two small children, and he tried\nto be a rubaszny, that will [indecipherable] of Europe.",
        "Q: The rubaszny [indecipherable]",
        "A: Y-Yeah, ki-kind of. A-And \u2014 and so he \u2014 it \u2014 h-he said [indecipherable] it was a\n\u2014 the din of out \u2014 and he said that he has a balia, a container for water, for a tub, a\ntub for th \u2014 with swimming fish outside, okay, but this he didn\u2019t bring into the living\nroom. And Beebow(ph) was feeding me pieces of orange and \u2014 a-and so on. So, this\nwas \u2014 this was the \u2014 all those things were heard upstairs, because there were only a\nfew stairs. Windows were open, a truck pulls up, Rumkowski is in the house, and\nall this was done under his nose. Having nose to \u2014 to Rumkowski. And Dora raised\nRG-50.030*0580 43\nher voice and said wir werden \u2014 wir werden dem alten gar nicht geben. We will\nnot give anything to the old one. Anyhow, he says that all this is mine, all this 1s\nmine, everything is mine, and so on.",
        "Q: So-",
        "A: This was for me an illustration about a \u2014 a \u2014- Rumkowski part of the time was\nhelpless, and the things were done by a clique. And they allowed him to go around\nand \u2014 and get the darts thrown at the people who make hunger and everything. But\nhe, on the contrary, I \u2014 I \u2014 I know from hearing, because even if there was \u2014 there\nwas a [indecipherable] Rumkowski\u2019s courage, y-you know, in situation which\nwere dangerous to him, very dangerous to him, and \u2014 and nevertheless, he followed\nthrough, he put his life on \u2014 on line.",
        "Q: So, cou \u2014 could you explain little bit more about that truck that came, so that was\na \u2014a-\u2014 while the \u2014 the party was going on in the Rumkowski\u2019s apartment, the truck\npulled to take the patients out of the hospital, or \u2014 what was the \u2014",
        "A: No, no. Oh, you \u2014 you \u2014 with the truck?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: No, the truck was brought by Gertler from Warsaw \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: \u2014 with things which were not available even for the Germans.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, oh, okay, mm-hm.\nRG-50.030*0580 44",
        "A: This was probably his bonus because he brought many rich Jews probably to\ntheir deaths, you know, and [indecipherable]. So \u2014 so, Rumkowski was excluded.\nTo me, I didn\u2019t have to \u2014 at \u2014 at one time, and this I will not forget either, there was\n\u2014 there was \u2014 people were saying at the table, said, the Germans have left a ghetto,\nmaybe Kovno, maybe Rovno, | don\u2019t remember exactly, and they left the Jews\nintact. Now, we kind of had a feeling, I had a feeling that I\u2019m not going to live,\naround the corner there is death. I couldn\u2019t get rid of that feeling, that death is\nwaiting around the \u2014 but \u2014 but probably the \u2014 that means, like they killed the Jews\nbefore they leave the ghetto? One way or another, it \u2014 it \u2014 it was \u2014 this what came\naround. And people were talking about that, and continue with their dinner, with\ntheir galareta, with all those things that Dora was preparing; preparing \u2014 that she\nmade to be prepared.",
        "Q: So \u2014 but Rumkowski was not part of that feast?",
        "A: He was \u2014 he was \u2014 he was not a part of it, but in this case, in the afternoon, I\nwaited outside my house because Gertler said that he is going to buy me a bike.\nAccording to the historical book nobody had a bike. I had a bike. It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 so \u2014 so\nthe room \u2014 yeah, Rumkowski comes in and gets out of his dorozka and he grabs\nme by \u2014 by the [indecipherable] and he swirls me around him. He \u2014 he 1s radiant\nwith happiness. He \u2014 he \u2014 he walks straight. He \u2014 he shed 20 years off, when I saw\nhim at that time. Later in the evening I heard about \u2014 about the Jews remaining \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 45\nremaining alive, following which days later, we knew that it was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t true,\nthat the Germans didn\u2019t leave Jews alive, but at that time \u2014 but Rumkowski was del-\nde-delirious with happiness that \u2014 that the chances that the Jews were \u2014 and the other\npeople in the ghetto \u2014",
        "Q: Tho-Those were the Jews who were departed during the gaspara(ph), right?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Those were the Jew \u2014 he was happy because he learned that the Jews \u2014",
        "A: No, it said \u2014 said \u2014 said the Germans are likely to leave L\u00e9dz ghetto alone, okay,\nand not kill the people, okay. That was the big thing. But the people who were\nsitting at Dora\u2019s dinner, with me in attendance as well with, th-they \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t \u2014 they were not \u2014 y-you know, th-they were not moved. No \u2014 no one was\nhappy that they were talking about the ranks within the ghetto, the \u2014 the different\nlevels of career, res-res-resonsi \u2014 responsibilities and \u2014 and this, they \u2014 they did not\ncare. Rumkowski cared. Okay, there was no doubt in my mind that he cared. There\nis no doubt in my mind that he \u2014 he was a demigod. There was no one that \u2014 that he\nwas \u2014 that he was on a extraordinary ego trip. Most of the time he pretended.\n[indecipherable] because you know, you \u2014 you had to throw the fear in th \u2014 into\nthem. What \u2014 but actually he was \u2014 after the \u2014 the \u2014 the [indecipherable] there was\na situation that people had to say to \u2014 who worked there, had to say send less food\nbecause there are less people in the ghetto, because they were already \u2014 well,\nRG-50.030*0580 46\nRumkows \u2014 and no one wanted to sign, or whatever, which had to be signed. And\nRumkowski volunteered, and he signed, and he was beaten up for that, but he\nsurvived just the same.",
        "Q: So do \u2014 do you remember instances when Rumkowski would come from the\nmeetings with the Germans and be beaten up?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Re \u2014 because in the evening, I wasn\u2019t any more [indecipherable] ask me about\nwhat they ate on Friday, I forgot about that ...",
        "Q: Wh-Wh-What did someone ask you what \u2014 what they were eating on Friday?",
        "A: The Rumkowski \u2014 on Friday, I said usual, only to remember later, to remember\nthat actually I wasn\u2019t there on Friday night. This is \u2014 the distance is kind of\ntelescoping and \u2014 and [indecipherable] so actually, I wasn\u2019t there at night, at night I\nwas ac \u2014 ac \u2014 exhibited at Dora\u2019s, so \u2014 now \u2014 but \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, so tho-tho-those were the evenings where you had to recite her poetry.",
        "A: Ye-Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: On Friday evenings.",
        "A: Poe \u2014 po \u2014 poetry, yes. I wa \u2014 I was \u2014 how much time has passed? Pardon?",
        "Q: One hour and a half.",
        "A: Oh.\nRG-50.030*0580 47",
        "Q: But it is quite interesting what you are saying, so 1f you don\u2019t mind?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, sure, sure.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s continue.",
        "A: I will \u2014 ye-yeah. It\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 we are \u2014",
        "Q: Would you \u2014 would you like to take a break, because if \u2014 if you would like to\ntake a break, we could \u2014",
        "A: No, I\u2014I am fine. If you \u2014 if you see me kind of losing my think, it is because \u2014",
        "Q: We don\u2019t.",
        "A: I\u2014I want \u2014 I want to tell you that, I\u2014 I don\u2019t have an opportunity to talk about it,\nI don\u2019t.",
        "Q: I will definitely extract every opportunity.",
        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it-it \u2014 yeah, th-the 1 \u2014 the idea is that I \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t even \u2014 I don\u2019t even try. I\nbelong to a \u2014 to a book club which exists 50 years already, and whatever in Israel,\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and I \u2014 I thought that they are Holocaust deniers. They were Holocaust\ndeniers. I-I changed that one perception there, because they read some books and so\non. But \u2014 but gosh, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 they say there was nothing special about the\nHolocaust and this. Those were leaders of the communists at one time, and they\nwere \u2014 they were kind of thinking in a global terms to include everybody, and the \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 48\nso \u2014 so \u2014 actually, and I don\u2019t have friends who were \u2014 with who I can kind of\nrehash it. I-I know that in Israel people meet, and \u2014 if they were in the camp. I \u2014 I\nthink that I would like to \u2014 to \u2014 to save an insider\u2019s view, because I am actually \u2014 I\nhave to be grateful to Krikosava(ph), who died in the ghetto on tuberculosis, despite\neverything. I have to be grateful to Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch, who was the fianc\u00e9 for\nDora, h-he \u2014 he saved my life by pulling me out from there, you know, and putting\nmy ca-candidacy as \u2014 as the one. It\u2019s a \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it is \u2014 I\u2014 I would like \u2014 I would like\nas \u2014 personally that \u2014 that Rumkowski should be seen \u2014 should be seen no-not only\nin terms of \u2014 of being \u2014 what \u2014 what is th-the word, like that he \u2014 he \u2014 he tried, he\ntried. H-He \u2014 he tried. He was misguided lots of times. He tried his best, also most\nof the times. The \u2014 Gertler was bringing death to many Jews, he wound up as a hero\nafter the people were writing letters that he saved their life and things like that. The\n\u2014 the people who died, almost at his hands, which may count to hundreds and\nthousands, they cannot write letters that he saved them \u2014 their life. I think that there\nwas \u2014 there is an injustice in this one. There was a \u2014 Dora \u2014 D-Dora Fuchs, they\nwere locating me after the war, I \u2014 I wanted to go to the camp with my friends. We\nwere very \u2014 we were very, kind of connected. The [speaks foreign language here]\nthose 12 \u2014 12 or fi\u2014 15 [indecipherable] 12. Wa \u2014 wa \u2014 wa \u2014 over \u2014 over 10\nchildren who were there, some of them alive, Miraka(ph) is a writer, a writer in \u2014 in\nSweden. There is Majel(ph), there is Benek(ph), there is Chaim Kamalowski(ph)\nRG-50.030*0580 49\nfrom Wilna who \u2014 who died and so on. I \u2014 I was with them, so I wasn\u2019t any more\nparticipating on the daily things that Dora is doing or not doing. Neither did I know",
        "Q: But they were \u2014 they were \u2014 all those people whom you just mentioned, they\nwere part of the orphanage?",
        "A: Yeah, but Dora and 500 other people, less than 500, I think, left later on, this \u2014\nthis I already heard from \u2014 from Bernard, okay? And the fact is that they were left,\nthey were left under the tutelage of \u2014 of the Beebow(ph). And \u2014 and they were \u2014 and\nthey were \u2014 they had good condition. Eric Yakobovitch had a son, Mula. Mula\nwas five years old, and there were some \u2014 a few hours, they were not \u2014 they were\nnot delivering food, or whatever, so Mula says that he want chocolate, and Eric\nYakobovitch was raging. This was in the camp, in a concentration camp, for the\nprivilege, raging, my son is hungry, where 1s the chocolate? Where is the chocolate?\nMy son is hungry. The \u2014 the chances for survival in that group, I think that very few\nhave died. The father of \u2014 of Ita Salomon(ph), which is the wife of \u2014 of Bernard,\nand she is still alive, but with the \u2014 with the Alzheimer\u2019s, which I seem to be\ngetting, maybe.",
        "Q: Not \u2014 not a chance.",
        "A: Yeah. So, an-and say the survival \u2014 the survival was almost, almost complete, of\nthose people. Where I went, what I went through had \u2014 had very little chance for\nRG-50.030*0580 50\nsurvival. I came together very romantically wi-with the boys and the girls, and \u2014 and\nwe thought that we will live together, all of us, like a group of youngsters, but not\nmen or women yet. That we will share everything, that once we come to the labor\nthing and so on, we will support each other, and we will be strong and \u2014 and so on,\nSO \u2014 w-we came to be [indecipherable]. So, you know, in Birkenau right away,\nright away part of us didn\u2019t make it. I ma \u2014 I made it, I was small \u2014 I am small. And\nI don\u2019t know how I went through \u2014 through the initial selection. I think that I went\nthrough the initial selection because I couldn\u2019t believe I saw \u2014 we already knew, as\nwe were undressing, they already told us. When we went one way, already people\ntold us, you go to life. And \u2014 and I believer there were only maybe a hundred or 200\nfrom the whole train, and the rest \u2014 the rest went right away to \u2014 the train which\ncame a day before us, everybody went, the day after us, everybody else. Us, had a\nsmall \u2014 a small contingent of survivors. But then there was the selection, and this\ntime the selection was undressed. So, I have a white jacket, because see, it was\ncustom made still. I had from that time, so maybe I looked a little bit stronger. But\nthen we were \u2014 we were undress, and there was that figure in black going back and\nforth, and it really fascinated me, like that \u2014 that \u2014 that situation of a man deciding\nthat or \u2014 or \u2014 and I was \u2014 and I was looking at \u2014 at that \u2014 at that assessment, a-and I\nwas \u2014 I was staring. When I came there, there was kind of a movement of\nresignation that he \u2014 he put me there to \u2014 li-like he kind of o-okay, put me to, and I\nRG-50.030*0580 31\nthink was it, did my staring do 1t? My physic simply wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t like a person\nfor work yet, never \u2014 never did I see [indecipherable]. I will never know, nobody\nwould never know, but I had other occasions that I remained alive because of\nsomething unexplainable, some \u2014 somebody did something, somebody had \u2014 had a\nmoment of compassion, or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or whatever, again and again and again,\nbecause I came to Mauthausen later on. And \u2014 and Mauthausen was \u2014 and later\nthat it was [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and then there was \u2014 then there was the hospital,\nI went on the hospital. And \u2014 and the war finished for me, not on the fifth, the war\nfinished for me, I\u2014 I know when. On \u2014 I \u2014 I must have, in my delirium, I must have\nin the hospital in \u2014 in Austria, in the basement of the hospital, I must have, being\ndelirious, and I remember talking del \u2014 del \u2014 delirious. As a matter of fact, I\nremember that I was doing some \u2014 that I was e-engage and ar-articulate whatever\nspeeches. That\u2019s what I remember from my \u2014 from my be-being in a high delirium.\nBut I must have mentioned that \u2014 the 30\" of May. That\u2019s what I was so \u2014 so the 30\"\nof May must be my date, and \u2014 because in delirium wa \u2014 it came through. And \u2014 and\na nurse brought me \u2014 there were two nurses, one Ukrainian, one \u2014 one \u2014 one was\nAustrian. They brought me a \u2014 a\u2014a card with birthday. That\u2019s the first time during\nthe war that I cried. I never cried during the war, not once. And \u2014 and \u2014 and the war\nfinished, and the things started from that point on.",
        "Q: So, going back to \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 52",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 to we \u2014 we were still \u2014 we \u2014 you gave us very nice, very educating run-through\nwhat happened. But I just want to go into little details.",
        "A: Sure. S-Sorry, I think that I was \u2014",
        "Q: No, no, no, it was very good, but th-th \u2014",
        "A: I-It\u2014",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Right? Do you remember any circumstances which were around it, cause you\nwere in this privileged part of the ghetto, and how did that work?",
        "A: Oh, it \u2014 1n the ghetto?",
        "Q: In the ghetto, when \u2014 when you were deported to Auschwitz.",
        "A: I\u2014I was \u2014 I was not any more \u2014 I place myself outside the magic circle, okay? I\nwas \u2014 I wanted to go with my \u2014 with my friends and \u2014 and I didn\u2019t want to say that I\ndon\u2019t want to be with Dora, I \u2014 this would be crass, or whatever. And even more\nunder \u2014 I just said that I want to be with this \u2014 Gertler, just knowing that I have\nfriends, Gertler gave me \u2014 gave me a bike. Oh, incidentally, someone called me a\nRG-50.030*0580 53\ncouple of months ago, and his name is Walter Kelly(ph). He was one of the three\nmen who was sent from the United States by this organi \u2014 by your organization to \u2014\nto review, receive the \u2014 the \u2014 the rec-records, 18 kilometers of records.",

        "Q: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: \u2014 which \u2014 which was open, Walter was one of them. So, here a \u2014 here 1s some \u2014\nsomebody from there. And I say, Walter, do you remember something about a bike?\nAnd he says, sure, you were coming on a bike, and every time you were giving me a\nchance to \u2014 to drive around. So \u2014 so here is Walter the first person who says never\nmind what the historians write, there was at least one bike 1n the \u2014 in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you \u2014 you got \u2014 you got that bike, and were you riding your bike in\nthe ghetto?",
        "A: Sure, sure. Yeah, that\u2019s the idea. To Marysin, because this was the other end,\ngoing Lagiewnicka 63 was Radigosz(ph). Goes to Radigosz and I would \u2014",
        "Q: So you were constantly, de-despite the fact that you lived in the Rumkowski\u2019s\napartment, you were constantly in touch with your colleagues, with your friends, in\n\u2014 in Marysin, in the orphanage.\nRG-50.030*0580 54",
        "A: Ti-Til I created the situation that kind of things were dissipating and I was\nspending more and more time with my friends, and it was kind of accepted. And \u2014\nand Rumkowski from time to time, he would call me to see how I am making out,\nhow I am doing. So \u2014",
        "Q: D-Do you remember ever, the Rumkowski\u2019s visits to the \u2014 to Marysin, to the \u2014\nto the orphanage there?",
        "A: To \u2014 to the orphana \u2014 every day s \u2014 every second day to that orphanage, to the\nsmall t \u2014 orphanage. An interesting thing, that somebody looking for an orphanage\nlike that, there was a twin orphanage with some 12 \u2014 12 youngsters, which were\nchosen by \u2014 by Rumkowski, and she was looking for people from her group. Her\nname is Lucia Ailmer(ph), I think. And \u2014 and instead of finding her people, she\nfound the people in \u2014 in my group. So, we are \u2014 we are in contact act-actually now.\nSo somewhere there was that secret, second \u2014 like, there were two. I thought til now\nthat there was only \u2014 only \u2014 only one.",
        "Q: And there Rumkowski was taking care of \u2014 of the \u2014 o-of \u2014 of \u2014 of those\nyoungsters who were in those orphanages, right? He was \u2014",
        "A: Oh, the orphanages? Yes. And he was pushing for schools, and he was pushing\nfor \u2014 for young people who have a chance to survive, to \u2014 to have a \u2014 a better chance\nto survive through food or good work, or something. He was not God, he didn\u2019t have\na right to decide who is, who isn\u2019t. But he probably thought that he is doing exactly\nRG-50.030*0580 35\nthe right thing. Oh yes, when \u2014 when he was twirling me around about what \u2014 what\nhe thought history will say about him, he will \u2014 he will say \u2014 he \u2014 he s \u2014 he will say\nthat after the war, you \u2014 no, I and you will go in America, and I will give a\nreferaten \u2014 just the f-first time that I head the \u2014 the word referaten, which means\nlectures or something. So \u2014 so his \u2014 there \u2014 there was no question in my mind after\nthat little thing, that he was not afraid of \u2014 of \u2014 of history, but that he \u2014 he has done \u2014\nthat he has done his best.",
        "Q: And your \u2014 your feeling is among the \u2014 the people that Rumkowski, w-was he\naware of the fate that 1s awaiting everybody, including himself, or \u2014 or he was in\ndenial of that, or what \u2014 what would you think? How \u2014 how did he treat the \u2014 the tr \u2014\nthe truth, that he must have known, right?",
        "A: If \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he mu \u2014 he must have known, even because \u2014 even \u2014 he\u2019s twirling\nme around, and being happy. Was \u2014 I learned the same evening, was because the\nGermans have left the ghetto intact. This means that if he say intact, not killing\neverybody, this means that he must have known the alternative to leaving intact.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And how \u2014 how were the others, th-the Fuchses, the \u2014 the Gertler, they\nwere als \u2014 also aware?",
        "A: The Ge-Gertler was not only aware, he was a perpetrator. This is\n[indecipherable] was a smart man, nice man, gentle man, but he was the second kid\nto \u2014 to get \u2014 at one time in the ghetto, Krieger \u2014 after they took away Gertler,\nRG-50.030*0580 56\nKrieger and Dora Fuchs and Eric Yakobovitch were deciding everything about\nthe ghetto. No matter who was being blamed, they were deciding. I saw it, I saw the\nprocess, I saw the meeting, I saw them \u2014 I saw them say so that I am a fly on the\nwall. I didn\u2019t think that my memories will be historical in some way, but \u2014 but you\nknow, I also, you know, sometimes \u2014 sometimes they would \u2014 they would hush a\nlittle, and the child is there or something, you know. And \u2014 and we go back and \u2014\nand there was no way, the apartment wasn\u2019t very great. There was \u2014 Dora \u2014 Dora\nFuchs had her \u2014 her room with \u2014 with blocks of ice like bricks from ice, so you\ncouldn\u2019t see the counters. There was my room with \u2014 with a bed where Bernard\nFuchs was using, and that\u2019s what became available for me. I-Incidentally, an-\nanother thing which bothered me; there was \u2014 the-there were two \u2014 two machines in\nthe ghetto. They were called the diathermia. This is a word from that time. Dora\nhad some occasionally stomach cramps. And this was \u2014 this was prescribed for\npeople with diathermia. It was \u2014 it was said to me, I didn\u2019t count, that there were\ntwo diathermias in the ghetto. Dora, for herself and the rest of the 160,000 or\n100,000 people who had only the use of one diathermia machine, because\ndiathermia machine was in her room, just in case she feels like it on this is the date\nthat she wants to apply the diathermia, and so \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what was that machine? What \u2014 what was \u2014 can you describe \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 37",
        "A: Th-They\u2019re doing something good for her \u2014 fo-for her intestines or whatever, I\ndidn\u2019t go deeply into it. There was a cow in the ghetto, you were probably not \u2014 you\ndidn\u2019t hear about that, about the cow, possibly \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there are two people\nin the world who know about the cow. There was a cow in the ghetto. There was \u2014\nthere was an orchard in the ghetto. And everything very hush-hush, , but it was\nthere. But it was every morning, almost every morning, the chief of police,\nRozenblat or something, would bring eggs. At one time he forgot to bring eggs, and\nBolek(ph) Yakobovitch was sleeping over, he was sleeping over, af-after all, she \u2014\nshe was his fianc\u00e9, Bolek(ph) \u2014 Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch was eating breakfast, my\nfather died of hunger, this was early in the game. And I was eating breakfast, I \u2014 I\nfinished my breakfast, Dora\u2019s father, Papa was invited for breakfast. So he was\neating breakfast and \u2014 and he was \u2014 he packed lunch, a beautiful sandwich or\nsomething with an egg and sp \u2014 it was with, not egg, sprouts and things like that.\nAnd he unpacked it after I finished breakfast and says, would you like to eat my\nlunch? I didn\u2019t give it a second thought, I ate his lunch. But he was sending me \u2014 I\nalso got the message, you know? We \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we measure \u2014 we \u2014 we measure,\nsomehow, you know, what we \u2014 or whatever. At \u2014 Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch said,\nbecause the eggs were not delivered for \u2014 for breakfast, he says, you see? You can \u2014\nyou can live a day without eggs for breakfast, he says to Dora, or something like\nthat. You see, you can eat \u2014 the chil \u2014 children were born and died in the ghetto\nRG-50.030*0580 58\nwithout ever seeing an egg, without knowing what it is, or what it tastes. And he\nsays that it\u2019s possible to survive. Yakobovitch wife, Regina, dropped in just to have\na talk with me. Dropped in and she had a sandwich and she started over with her s \u2014\nshe started to \u2014 to eat the sandwich and \u2014 and wrapped it up and put it back. She\nsays, the doctors say \u2014 said the best \u2014 the best way \u2014 said, th-the \u2014 the best way to\neat, is to stop eating while you are still hungry. This was in the ghetto where \u2014 which\nhunger was \u2014 was giving everybody an unendurable pain, just the \u2014 the feeling of\nhunger. The doctor told her that it\u2019s the healthiest to stop while she is still hungry,\nand exercise and a diet, or something like that. And I \u2014 I\u2014 I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t\nstop, my father just died of hunger. My mother was \u2014 must have been very afraid of\nbeing \u2014 being taken away, as a person who cannot work any more, or whatever. And\nthen, okay, but then I \u2014 I prefer to be \u2014 to eat \u2014 which means, like I have my\nprinciples that I have to compromise with, but \u2014 an-and ne-nevertheless, it was \u2014 it\nwas good to \u2014 to eat that. At the same time when I went over to the other children,\nthere was less food and less [indecipherable] but, at that time it wasn\u2019t a question of\nhunger or no hunger, and it didn\u2019t make a difference.",
        "Q: So, it \u2014 and that was the basically everyday life after the gaspara(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and d-during 1943, up until the \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 59",
        "A: Concerts, reviews, theaters, th-there was e-entertainment, dinners. Dora Fuchs\nwas a big \u2014 was a big th \u2014 kind of dinner arran \u2014 arranger. She was very inventive.\nShe wasn\u2019t doing it by herself, but she was very, very inventive.",
        "Q: So who would be coming to those dinners? The \u2014 the Germans?",
        "A: No, th \u2014 but, they would \u2014 the people were coming who were always heads of\ndepartments in the ghetto. It \u2014 it was a\u2014 Dora was able to pull out \u2014 in \u2014 1n a setting\nof home, she was able to pull out anything, anything she wanted, without the people\n\u2014 without th-the people wanting or not wanting to say. She \u2014 she was a genius. She \u2014\nshe could draw out, people couldn\u2019t stop themselves, only blurted out, an-and she\nwas \u2014 she was the puppet master [indecipherable]. She \u2014 she was a much more,\nlet\u2019s say a \u2014 say, her job description. As a matter of fact, I-I saw it, Eric\nYakobovitch was sitting on a chair. I remember lying on the corner, and \u2014 and she\nwas standing over him, and she was shaking a finger at him, and \u2014 and she would\nsay, remember with some things, one German closed all the \u2014 all the food in the\nghetto, this, and no one is \u2014 was allowed to touch the food. This means punishing\nthe whole ghetto because he got angry about something. And it was a question of\nhunger and people dying and whatever, and things getting rotten at the same time.\nWell, Dora \u2014 Dora spend the night, and \u2014 in Lodz. She came back and \u2014 and she\nwas proud that she got the \u2014 she got that this was an example of Dora being able to\ndo some things, which amb \u2014 anyhow, she was shaking her finger at Eric\nRG-50.030*0580 60\nYakobovitch, who promised her that he will never do anything without first running\nit by her.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollections from that time of any of the Germans? You said th\n\u2014 at one point, that Genovine(ph) \u2014 not Genovine(ph), th-the Beebow(ph) came.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What are your recollections of Beebow(ph)? How did he behave there, how was",
        "A: Be-Beebow(ph)? Beebow(ph), I think that Dora \u2014 Dora admired Beebow(ph),\nbecause number one, she was changing his shirt every day.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: Number two, she saw what\u2019s written about him, that he 1s an extraordinary\norganizer. This was his freedom from the eastern front, needless to say.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, he had like a \u2014 a very high thing. I think \u2014 I think that Beebow(ph), a\u2014a\ndrunken, who probably attack anyone if he drinks, and he was very careful what he\ndoes publicly. That means that he wasn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t engage in any \u2014 in any beatings\nor this or being angry. He wouldn't \u2014 he \u2014 he was spending more time with\nYakobovitch, Eric Yakobovitch. A friend who was in L\u00e9dz after the war was\ntelling me that he attended the \u2014 Beebow\u2019s(ph) trial, and Beebow(ph) all the time\nsaid that they should ask Erici Yakobovitch, Eric Yakobovitch, like what Eric\nRG-50.030*0580 61\nYakobovitch will say, would \u2014 would \u2014 would have much importance after the war.\nWhich we said Beebow(ph) was naive in some \u2014 in some respect. I know that\nBeebow(ph) had lots of money, siphoned off from the ghetto, because I heard and I\nheard again, and it was obvious, and it was always kind of that we understood. I\nthink that Gertler, who all at once after the war was \u2014 he was the head of the\nunderworld before the war. So \u2014 at \u2014 it \u2014 I think that Gertler all at once, gets to be a\nbig manufacturer in Munich, and I think that he knew where Beebow\u2019s(ph) \u2014 where\nBeebow\u2019s(ph) stash of monies and [indecipherable] away, this is my wa \u2014 thi-this\nis nothing, this is just a feeling I\u2014 I have. But there were pilgrimages going to\nGertler, the murderer. This was un \u2014 unjust \u2014 he didn't deserve an-any of It.\nRumkowski didn\u2019t deserve all the contempt that he \u2014 that he encounters by\nsubsequent historians.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So, do you remember any other Germans coming there for \u2014 o-only\nBeebow(ph)?",
        "A: No, I remember \u2014 oh, I re \u2014 I re \u2014 I remember that tough talking, that they were\ntalking with Germans, but th-the names didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t dis \u2014 there was \u2014 somebody\nwas protecting \u2014 was protecting Rumkowski. Beebow(ph) \u2014 Beebow(ph) had to be\ncareful with Rumkowski. Any other Jew he could kill, he probably couldn\u2019t kill\nRumkowski, he would \u2014 he would \u2014 he would have to answer to \u2014 to some. I\nremember some name \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 62",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t know who that person was?",
        "A: Who that pers \u2014 after the war, it came to me \u2014 aft-after the war Dora \u2014 Dora was\nworking in UNRRA in \u2014 in \u2014 in Brooklyn. The Yakobovitches were there, Erik\nand this \u2014 Mula, meantime, got to be super-duper si \u2014 rich in \u2014 in Kissimmee, near\nKissimmee in Florida with horses and vintage cars and all kind of things. And he\ndid it at \u2014 at the record \u2014 the record speed, and guess where the money came from?\nA Krieger son, Malachi(ph) was in the \u2014 he was in South Africa, I think.\nEventually \u2014 eventually in \u2014 in Miami as well. We are talking about riches. Those\nare \u2014 those are old things of monies which accumulated in the hands of a few. There\nis no doubt in my mind that this \u2014 this was on \u2014 on different scales. Those monies\ndidn\u2019t just happen.",
        "Q: So when the time of \u2014 th-the final deportations in 1944 came, when did you learn\nabout that? Do you re \u2014 do you recall anything? What was the sequence of \u2014 you\nknow, of \u2014 of th \u2014 of the events in \u2014 at the \u2014 at the end of the liquidation of the\nghetto?",
        "A: I would say the liquidation of the ghetto at that time was not that the \u2014 that the\nsecond shoe has fallen, only that the second shoe 1s falling. So, it was something that\neveryone wanted to avoid. People complained about the ghetto, but were doing their\nutmost to avoid deportation from the ghetto. The \u2014 the worst dates that they ghetto\nhad, probably when Rumkowski was missing for two days. There was despair\nRG-50.030*0580 63\nthroughout the ghetto, everyone\u2019s nerves were this, because with all the\ncomplaining, they felt that at least there is some kind of a hand at work on behalf of\nsurvival. Must have felt it, because otherwise, why curse Rumkowski and be so\nterribly concerned when he is missing for two days? So, e-e-everybody knew, and \u2014\nand the rush was to resource which are likely to be needed by \u2014 by the Germans.\nResource means the factories.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So, let\u2019s say Himowicz(ph) fac-factory, which is metal [indecipherable]. Th-\nthen Zatlersort(ph), where I was working, this had a chance because it was for\nmilitary rucksacks, it had a chance to continue as a group working together. And this\nis the transport that we have chosen to go with. We probably got advice also, which\nto get of \u2014 of course, all this was nothing, the only group was Beebow\u2019s(ph) group\nthat he brought to Flossenbiirg and \u2014 and whatever, divided. So this \u2014 this was the\nonly \u2014 the rest, the rest, the moment \u2014 the moment people came into the camp, th-\nthey were \u2014 they were just meat for grinding. So this was the atmosphere of the\nghetto, that people hoped to be lucky and be at a place where their work will be\nneeded.",
        "Q: So y-you were deported how \u2014 when the deportations started, how many days, if\nyou remember at all, you were still there before y-your own deportation?\nRG-50.030*0580 64",
        "A: How \u2014 how \u2014 how long? I \u2014 I know that Rumkowski, Rumkowski came a week\nafter we arrived, our group. When did I learn about that, I don\u2019t read many books\nabout that or anything, but some \u2014 sometimes, here or there I notice a \u2014 a note,\nwhich rings a bell. So he \u2014 he came a week later. The story was that \u2014 that\nBeebow(ph) didn\u2019t want to release his brother to go with that select group. So\nRumkowski decided to \u2014 to \u2014 to be \u2014 it\u2019s the \u2014 the \u2014 the other part of the story.",
        "Q: To go with his brother?",
        "A: Mm, yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 he didn\u2019t \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and Rumkowski put many \u2014 just means\nBeebow(ph) put, after giving Rumkowski and his family, his very small family \u2014\nincidentally, Stanislaw looked like the brother of \u2014 of the \u2014 of Rumkowski\u2019s wife,\nMrs. Rumkowski. They say that she married Rumkowski in order to save her\nbrother, tuberculosis. And she couldn\u2019t save her brother, but Stasiuk, Stasiuk was \u2014\nlooked and was like her brother. It looked to me that Rumkowski kind of talks to\nme more than he talks to Stasiuk, maybe because Stasiuk was \u2014 Stasiuk was so\nvery serious and measured, I don\u2019t know. Nice, nice guy. You could build a house\non whatever he said.",
        "Q: And Stasiuk went together with Rumkowski, as far as you know?",
        "A: With Rumkowski, yes.",
        "Q: And so he didn\u2019t survive?",
        "A: He \u2014 he \u2014 he did not survive the first day.\nRG-50.030*0580 65",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 to this, did you have any clue where you were going? Did you know anything\nabout it, did you \u2014",
        "A: Abso \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 did you know what to expect?",
        "A: Absolutely nothing. Abso \u2014 the \u2014 the ghetto lived for \u2014 for four or five years on a\nwhat we called kaczki(ph). Kaczki(ph) means just something which flies by \u2014",
        "Q: The rumors.",
        "A: Yeah, and builds up a rumor into, like, something that they know. From my \u2014 my\npersonal story, the ghetto may be of interest, my real war, and you can say luck in\nsurvival, started actually at \u2014 at that time. Coming \u2014 coming into \u2014 into the\nconcentration camp, and \u2014 and winding up in \u2014 in Mauthausen, Braunskirsche(ph)\nand so on. If \u20141f\u20141if I would, and the war would be finished, at \u2014 at \u2014 at the times\nthat we talked about, I think that I would have suffered a quarter or less of a\u2014 ofa\nrisk of death and an ugly story of cannibalism, ways to escape \u2014 to escape sexual\nadvances, and remaining alive. Luck connected with it. And I don\u2019t know if we have\na \u2014 and I could \u2014 I could probably condense it in \u2014 in a number of sentences, but I\ndon\u2019t know if we still have \u2014 have place for that story. But this was \u2014 this was the\nreal war, and this was \u2014 I \u2014 my life was saved, because of different good people. At\nRG-50.030*0580 66\nleast on three occasions, my life was saved by German SS. On one of the occasions,\nby a\u2014 by a\u2014 a enthusiastic killer, a young SS man, who turned out to be a killer\nonce we were on a forced march. I shared his bread with me. Hard to understand.",
        "Q: So when \u2014 when you \u2014 when you got to \u2014 to Auschwitz \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",

        "Q: I\u2019m sorry\u201d?",
        "A: I was just wondering if you have some time, because I am \u2014 I am cruising around\nwhat happened at that point, and \u2014 and \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear.",
        "Q: We do ha \u2014 we do have all the time that 1s required for that. It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 th-this is\nquite important, if you recall \u2014 if you could recall what happened when you arrived\nto Auschwitz in a-as detailed as possible, you know.\nRG-50.030*0580 68",
        "A: Well, I\u2014I arrived at Auschwitz at \u2014 a few of us, the ones who were not taken to\nthis, we came to block 14, and block 14 they would chase us from place to place\nwith sticks, and just to have an occasion. A \u2014 a man came up on the chimney, saying\nthat there 1s only one way out, through \u2014 through the chimney, you know, so that we\nwould be \u2014 the \u2014 the old stories, horror story. Walter, of Russia, I have the name\nhere, I go \u2014 I have a calendar here \u2014 Walter himself was \u2014 was hit here with a stick,\nand he started to cry, not because of the stick, only because he didn\u2019t give us food\nthe whole day. And even at that point I found it like a \u2014 you know \u2014 you know, like\na little bit, you know, funny. He doesn\u2019t remember it. So the \u2014 at that certain point,\nthe \u2014 and a large man comes in the middle of tha-that speech, and so on, give up\nmoney and so on. A | \u2014 a [indecipherable] came over, and he was a butcher, I\nlearned from Pionki(ph), a nice person, from what I have seen. And \u2014 and he says,\ncan somebody peel potatoes? And everyone started to peel potatoes. I knew I have\nno chance, I \u2014 I was squashed by the people. I remained where I was, near the wall,\nand he pointed at me. And \u2014 and people started to pass me o-overhead to \u2014 to him,\nlike \u2014 and \u2014 and they say, oh you will survive, you will survive, like this would be,\nyou know, like peeling potatoes would mean survival. And I peeled potatoes, they\ncooked. What happened that \u2014 that night, the blockalteste, the blockalteste, which\nmeans the leader of the block, at the entrance to the main block, th-there was a little\n\u2014a little place which \u2014 which was the kitchen and also the blockalteste. In this\nRG-50.030*0580 69\nparticular place it was not only the blockalteste, but also the lagerfuehrer \u2014 the\nlagerfuehrer, this means the main \u2014 the main blockalteste, whose name was Willie.\nWillie, nobody had anything against Willie. He \u2014 he was going to Familienlager\nvery often. He was released early for \u2014 an-and sometimes people on a transport saw\nWillie, and \u2014 and it was like a friendly thing. He was a captain of a ship which sold\nthe load because of some romantic entanglement, they said. And \u2014 and \u2014 and he was\nwell known by \u2014 by the people. And the Familienlager who came from\nTheresienstadt, who were in the Potenkins(ph) village, feel it wasn\u2019t necessary any\nmore to \u2014 to present that theater to the cro \u2014 Red Cross, Swedish Red Cross. And th-\nthat Willie on one side. And now I \u2014I was working in the kitchen, doing whatever\nthey were telling me. It was getting late, but nobody told me what \u2014 what to do with\nmyself. At one point, a\u2014 a German \u2014 th-there was an SS invited that \u2014 into to those\nfestivities. Somebody there was a kapo who played on \u2014 on an accordion, or the \u2014\nand that officer comes, an officer, it looked to me like an important officer. But he\ncame over to the kitchen, and he is drunk, and he is asking for water, and I gave him\nwater, and I answer him in \u2014 in \u2014 in German. So he says, oh, I know German, how\ncome that I know German? I must be a Mischling or something, and I said n-no, but\nat home, this means at home, this means Dora Fuchs and so on, we spoke only\nGerman. My first book, [indecipherable] in British Columbia, I \u2014 I read there, you\nknow, the first German book. And \u2014 and I did the most stupid thing that anybody\nRG-50.030*0580 70\ncan do in one\u2019s life, because I was embittered by \u2014 I saw the smoke coming out from\n\u2014 from the chimneys, and because he asked me, do you also speak English? And I\nsay, what for, so I burn better? A-And I showing this a \u2014 I thought, 1-in a moment I\nwill \u2014 my head will be under his boot, or he will shoot me, or he will\n[indecipherable] I \u2014 I [indecipherable] already on \u2014 already this second day, I have\nseen people killed all over the place. So he says \u2014 he kind of sobered up, and he\nsays, oh no, not boys like you. We will \u2014 we will teach you a trade, and after the war\nyou will be working for the Reich. And \u2014 and that\u2019s how it finished. The next \u2014 the\nnext day, didn\u2019t finish \u2014 it didn\u2019t finish, I didn\u2019t tell to anyone that. And this is \u2014\nthen I don\u2019t know what to do. Willie, who \u2014 who occupied a cubicle, says \u2014 says\n[indecipherable] there is a bed. A bed? People were lying on the floor all over. But\nI went bed, and he sidles up in the bed, and I am petrified, completely. I don\u2019t move,\nI am frozen. He talks to me and so on, and \u2014 and I am \u2014 I am petrified. So he started\nto talk to his little dog, and he says that he is not a good burschak(ph), he is not this,\nand so on. He \u2014 he kind of turned around and I s \u2014 I \u2014I left the bed, and I didn\u2019t\nhave where to sleep. I didn\u2019t know if to go into the block if somebody will beat me\nup. So I remained in this section in the kitchen, a-and I slept there. In the morning I\nwas woken by the din of giving \u2014 giving the \u2014 giving bread \u2014 bread and something\n[indecipherable] or whatever, to the passing people. So I helped. It was \u2014 this time\nit was some cheese, and the one from Pionki(ph), the \u2014 the butcher from Pionki(ph),\nRG-50.030*0580 71\nwho was also the cook, was very nice to me and so on, so he also gave me some\npotato from the day before, which made a big difference. And later on, the boxes,\nthe crates remained with \u2014 with the \u2014 for \u2014 with some cheese gl-glued to it. Can I\ntake it and \u2014 and \u2014 to find my friends and give it to them? Well, my friends was \u2014\nWalter I didn\u2019t know so \u2014 so well yet, but other, Benek(ph) and Chaim and \u2014 and\nso on. Benek(ph) in Maryland, here, nearby, he lives nearby. It started to \u2014 I went\nout with the box, and people absolutely attacked me, to \u2014 broke the box into little\npieces. I never found him, and there was like between the blocks, you \u2014 you had like\na promenade. There was a time that you were in between things, and you could walk\nback and forth. And I don\u2019t know if it was the same day, or the second day or the\nthird day or the fourth day. After a very short time, all at once, everybody on one\nsection of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the promenade is being like taken \u2014 taking 1n a gauntlet,\nand put into a block, and some \u2014 some people, like stronger people would be put\naside, but small people, and old people, who \u2014 who somehow \u2014 some of them were\n[indecipherable] for some time \u2014 I was new \u2014 were pushed into \u2014 into that block,\nop-opposite the 14 block. Now, thi-this \u2014 this was \u2014 it \u2014 it was so tight that 1t was\nlike \u2014 it was difficult to breathe, because everything was squeezed. No sitting, no\nthis, you know, just trying to sit in each other\u2019s lap, fighting for breath. I remember\nmy chest hurting the way it hurt now, with a \u2014 with heart disease, like empty, empty\nhurting. And \u2014 and it was in the middle of the night, middle of the night or whatever,\nRG-50.030*0580 72\nthere are cries, the lights go on, flashlights coming to \u2014 to my row, showing no this,\nthis, people started to try and make space. I was taken out from that bunch of people,\nbrought to the door. At the door was the German officer, Willie, the guy who\nwanted me to \u2014 to \u2014 to do sexual things to him, and Karl, which was the \u2014 the main\nkapo, or \u2014 aft-after Willie, a man \u2014 a man \u2014 a lame \u2014 a lame person with a stick.\nAnd they pulled me out and they put me into block number two. In block number\ntwo there was a bunk to sleep, and \u2014 and this was the first block near the SS stuba\nentrance. And the Canada commando were there. Canada commando were actually\nthe people who were \u2014 not where they do the \u2014 I \u2014 I read something, clothing and so\non. Some of the things with the Canada commando, yes, those were clothing, things\nto sort out. But the people who were working at the receival \u2014 at th-the \u2014 re-\nreceiving the people on the train and emptying this and so on, this was the \u2014 the real\nCanada commando. Most of them at that time were from Holland, where \u2014 where I\nwas. They had food and all kind of things. I was brought there, and they pass\nwithout any resolution where I belong and what\u2019s my name, or whatever. And \u2014 and\nthen I am told that I will be \u2014 I will be the runner for the SS stuba, which was the\nnext, and the SS stuba, th \u2014 it means, like if there was a raport(ph), an appell, and\neveryone had to be in front of the block, and later they would make a tally of \u2014 of\nthe people, and \u2014 and I would \u2014 I would have to run along it, and bring the pieces of\npaper. The raport(ph) pier(ph) is standing in the middle, would correlate if th \u2014 all\nRG-50.030*0580 73\nthe people are there. If not, the thing has repeated itself. Sometimes it repeated just\nin order to show people, you know, to be punitive, or \u2014 or whatever. And that what I\nwas doing, and jobs were being piled up on me. One of the SS men had the rabbits,\nand he wanted me to bring greens. The greens were \u2014 were growing near the electric\nwire, where nobody would go. But I got a number, for the first time, I got a number,\nwhich yesterday here I was in the file with my number, which is already not visible,\nalmost not visible. It \u2014 1t was a small \u2014 a small portion of that. You \u2014 you probably\nhaven\u2019t seen a number that \u2014 and \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, yo-you said something?",
        "Q: W-We have to change for a second, just a moment. [break]",
        "Q: Yes, are we? Yeah, okay, it\u2019s done.",
        "A: This was \u2014 this was my life from that point on. I was vacillating between being\non the edge of \u2014 of death, to \u2014 to all at once being \u2014 being either better off than\neverybody else, or being worse than everybody else. And I was positioned\n[indecipherable]. So, that\u2019s what I was doing. I met there Dina Gottliebova, she\nfought about \u2014 about her paintings. So she was coming \u2014 she was coming with\nMengele in order to kind of paint characteristics of \u2014 of \u2014 of the twins 1n \u2014 in the\nghetto. When \u2014 when Mengele came to make a \u2014 a raport \u2014 a \u2014 that means just a\nselection, she would remain where I was, at the entrance to the block two, near the \u2014\nnear the stuba, and \u2014 and we talked. And we were in contact later \u2014 later on. I \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 74\nwhat coincidence, many, many years later. I think she is not well now, she wa \u2014 she\nis in California, and \u2014",
        "Q: She passed away.",
        "A: She passed away, yeah.",
        "Q: So when the \u2014 the block 14, both 14 and the block number two \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 were in Birkenau, and those were the brick barracks, right?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. They were on the other side.",
        "A: No \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 the \u2014 the brick barracks were in Auschwitz proper, and those\nwere \u2014 and those were the \u2014 th-the barracks built for horses.",
        "Q: For horses.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So how far \u2014 you mentioned before th-the family camp, the Terezin family\ncamp?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you in touch with that, or di \u2014 were you observing it, were you \u2014 what \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I\u2014 this \u2014",
        "Q: Do you have any recollections of that, other than the \u2014 what that Willie would be\ngoing to?\nRG-50.030*0580 715",
        "A: Ah \u2014 at that time, yeah. I\u2014 I \u2014 I heard talking, Karl and so on talking that the \u2014\nalso something else happened that \u2014 that I know. Once somebody came to me, that\u2019s\nmeans \u2014 those people were in \u2014 in Theresienstadt. Somebody came to me and says,\nI heard that you were in Birkenau at that \u2014 that time, and she said that they saw my\nbrother, from \u2014 from Theresienstadt, from Familienlager, there. Is it possible that\n\u2014 that he \u2014 that he was there? And \u2014 and I told her, yes, it\u2019s possible. Somebody\npassed on the same circumstances saying you shouldn\u2019t give people false hope. I \u2014 I\nfelt insulted. I didn\u2019t, but it was possible, why was it possible? On the last night,\nwhen \u2014 when they were taking out all the people from Theresienstadt, it was\nWillie, and his friend Karl, and probably contacts that he had, which allowed him to\nbring approximately a hundred \u2014 hundred people \u2014 hundred young men from \u2014 from\nthe Theresienstadt out into our end. And so they avoided being th-th-they \u2014 th-they\nremained alive. So yeah, her brother could have been \u2014 her brother survived this\nparticular person. But so \u2014 an-and then there was a dispute with those people. What\nhundred people, what are you sa \u2014 talking about? Only 22, we were the only ones\nwho remained, 22. My friend, he\u2019s a psychiatrist, and he was in this. And I said, no,\nthere were a hundred, I was there. Gilbert wer \u2014 wote \u2014 wrote a book, the \u2014 the boys\nof Birkenau, or something like that. A-And he writes about those \u2014 those children,\nand \u2014 and he \u2014 and he writes about those hundred and \u2014 there is a page for \u2014 for\nevery one of those hundred, and they are still in England, the ones who are alive,\nRG-50.030*0580 76\nmost of them are alive, and they are still in England. So this was \u2014 this was what I\nknew, that little, in the \u2014 in the camp, and \u2014 and the later, because I just met people\nfrom there and we were comparing notes on some occasion. Just how I learned, I\nthought that Dina Gottliebova is a \u2014 a \u2014 a\u2014I said that the-there was a \u2014 once, I said\n[indecipherable] I said \u2014 somebody sa \u2014 oh, I see you have a number from\nBirkenau. I said yes. So I say, I see you have a number, too. So, yes, yes, I was\nthere, in the Familienlager. And I said, there is someone on my mind that said, I\nwill probably never find out what happened to her. She was sent, so I thought she 1s\ngoing with \u2014 she is going with Mengele, she probably knows much more than the\nrest of us do. And probably \u2014 and \u2014 and she was sad. This also \u2014 this also doesn\u2019t\nallow me much hope. She \u2014 she [indecipherable] to \u2014 had a husband, Rudy, and \u2014\nand she says he is talking about Dina Gottliebova. Bobbit. I was in contact with her\nlater on, and Bobbit \u2014 Bobbit is a \u2014 is \u2014 is her husband\u2019s \u2014 her husband\u2019s name. And\nshe was fighting to get the \u2014 to get some \u2014 she was also somebody who not \u2014\nadmired her boss. And this is \u2014 she admired things about Mengele. Things were\ncoming all the time. When she talked abou \u2014 about Mengele, some kind of pride\ncame into her voice, you know? Like she would make an example. She says, I made\nhis portrait, she says. She was doing many portraits for his friends as gifts. And \u2014\nand then six or seven of those Gypsy paintings, and the wall, which 1s probably in\nIsrael, in Yad Vashem, the \u2014 the wall \u2014 the wall the seven dwarfs, that\u2019s what the\nRG-50.030*0580 77\nchildren wanted \u2014 wanted once they were there, in the Familienlager. They were in\na room, and she painted it. And \u2014 and, so the seven dwarfs. And actually, she\nmarried the man who was the author of one of the seven dwarfs, which is Bobbitt.\nSo, we are now with the \u2014 so I thought that there is no survival. There 1s absolutely,\nthere is absolutely no survival. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were you \u2014 were you the witness of the liquidation of the Terezin family camp?",
        "A: I-I \u2014 I was there when \u2014 when they took them, but this 1s the \u2014 this is the night\nthat they brought the almost hundred boys into \u2014 into the camp, into the\nZigeunerlager, the Gypsy camp. But my friends were there, and as a matter of fact,\nthey are in Montreal and now he re-retired as a \u2014 an \u2014 and he 1s writing his third\nbook in Czech, about those times, about a re \u2014 reminiscences. He 1s \u2014 their children\nare \u2014 were from childhood, with what happened, involved writing poetry on those sa\n\u2014 things. My children, I protected them as much as I could, especially since I lost her\n\u2014 their mother at the age of nine and 12. This is my daughter, she was nine when my\n\u2014 when my wife has died. So, the number \u2014 I said this is a telephone number, and so\non. Til today they don\u2019t know. Part of the fact that the family is meeting together\nhere and I am giving the testimony and will try also to leave the testimony for my\nfamily out there. This is the same, this \u2014 thi-this is part why we are here. But just an\naside, that it\u2019s good for the children to know rather to not know, because they \u2014 they\nknow anyhow, but in some dark and untouchable way. What \u2014 what happened \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 78\nwhat happened later on, I was lucky again. There was a \u2014 they were supposed to \u2014 to\ne-empty the Zigeunerlager, and I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know the \u2014 how \u2014 how those\nminds worked, but Willie was interested in my survival. Karl was nice to me. I-It\u2019s\n\u2014n-nobody bother me. I \u2014 I could help others. I knew two boys, and their father was\nput in \u2014 into a \u2014 into that \u2014 the same block where I was, and they wanted to get the\nfather out, and they gave me a\u2014 a diamond, I didn\u2019t want the diamond. And I went\nto \u2014 to one of the Dutch people that I knew, and I ask him for a couple of sardine\nboxes, so they can bribe the \u2014 the blockalteste. They went, they bribed, they got the\nfather out. Later they were \u2014 they were all going from some \u2014 on some assignment\nto work, hopefully. I gave him back the diamond and he accepted it. And \u2014 so the\nidea is, if I could, somebody was in the krankenbau, in the hospital, I will bring in\na metal container, food. But at one time the guard shot down the line. I \u2014 I was\nstartled, and I got electrified, and \u2014 and fell out while \u2014 while this happened. I also\nwas [indecipherable] flowing back, and disconnected, but it \u2014 1t was a fe \u2014 quite a\nfeeling to \u2014 to be the \u2014 I was going to \u2014 to look for Mrs. Feldman, who was the head\nof the orphanage before, that \u2014 the same orphanage. And she was not \u2014 she is an\nartist, a known person in my life, felt fine. Mrs. Feldstein. And I \u2014 I found other\npeople. They asked me for warm underwear, and \u2014 and I would be bringing to the\npeople warm underwear. One of them had the relative in Montreal, who said that\nher underwear that I brought saved her life. Whatever. It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s probably\nRG-50.030*0580 79\nmisconception with some people that it was dog eat dog and only dog eat dog. It\nwasn\u2019t. People were doing things when they could. I did too. It was almost\nsomething pushing me do something good, since, you know, like \u2014 so \u2014 so this was\nthe time, and \u2014 but I don\u2019t understand why Willie was so nice to me, after \u2014 after\ntrying to \u2014 to \u2014 to get me to be his plaything or whatever. He \u2014 he wasn\u2019t rough, or\nhe wasn\u2019t this. Talked to his dog that I am not a good boy. And \u2014 and later he is \u2014\nand I am \u2014 as the camp was going to be emptied, I am getting a letter from an SS,\nprobably the same officer, who I never, ever saw again. And that letter \u2014 with that\nletter, I was sent to Sosnowice. And in Sosnowice \u2014 in Sosnowice, I arrived and I\ngave the letter to the commandant of the camp. And he says, if you were look \u2014 you\nwere good enough to be a runner in \u2014 in Birkenau, you are good enough to be a\nrunner for me. One of the strangest things happened; if somebody would make a\nfilm, I would be the first one to say this is impossible: I was \u2014 I was running, stoking\nthe fires in all the SS have their barracks, I was stoking the \u2014 stoking the fire and \u2014\nand all that; ea-eating sometimes from the \u2014 from the SS kitchen. Everybody knew\nme, it was a small camp. I said that I was interested to see the machinery, always\ninterested me, machinery [indecipherable]. So I went for one shift, commandant\npraising me that I am interested. So I \u2014 I went to \u2014 to the factory. I liked what I saw.\nPoles were working together with the Jews from the camp, the relations were this. I\ndidn\u2019t see a Pole for years, five years, well, at that time. And it was very nice, I ti\u2014I\nRG-50.030*0580 80\nfell a little bit in love with one Polish woman who was in the center of the factory,\nwriting things down, reading poetry, so we have something \u2014 something in common.\nShe was talking something, so the youngsters that I said are running away they say,\nto \u2014 to the [indecipherable] to Warsaw, actually go into the forest, talking that\nmaybe I can go into the forest, but I will have to avoid the \u2014 the Polish partisans and\ngo 30 kilometers. It\u2019s \u2014 I made a little reading lamp in the workshop of the camp, for\nthe commandant, an SS man, a young SS man sees me and he says, oh, did you do\nit? And I said yes. So \u2014 so I say, take it. So he says, no, I will \u2014 di \u2014 you made it for\nthe \u2014 for the commandant, no I will not take it. So I say okay, so I will make you\nanother one. I \u2014 I make him \u2014 I made him another one later on. This is the young\none, who was later killing people on that \u2014 on that road and sharing the bread with\nme, and other things, which \u2014 which help me to survive. There was another SS man\nthere from Austria, who was crying his head off because he didn\u2019t hear from his\nwife, and he thought maybe they were bombed, a-and \u2014 and I \u2014 I put my arm on\nhim, saying that the \u2014 maybe the post doesn\u2019t work or things. He shared with me\nsome sugar cubes, also on the trip, on that long trip where so many people were \u2014\nwere \u2014 were killed, per we \u2014",
        "Q: The trip west from Sosnowice?",
        "A: From Sosnowice to Mauthausen, yeah. Part of 1t was by train.\nRG-50.030*0580 $1",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 do you recall any \u2014 anything in the \u2014 in the \u2014 where did you walk on\nthat \u2014",
        "A: No, to Gliwice, because \u2014",
        "Q: To Gliwice now.",
        "A: \u2014 because the commandant, a porky man, good-natured, but I never forgot that he\nreached his [indecipherable] in Dachau. Okay, he got to be a commandant in\nDachau, so he is not a gent-gentle \u2014 as a matter of fact, so gentle, his family, like,\nthey adopted me. I was running around the camp, I had the movement. The\ntelephone was ringing in the \u2014 in the office, I would pick it up and say, this is Camp\nSosnowice, so and so, and take a message. And \u2014 and now it looked to me \u2014 show it\nto me in a film and I don\u2019t believe it, you know? That \u2014 so this was the true. But \u2014\nbut that\u2019s how it was, that was the thing. I \u2014 I was a \u2014 a \u2014 decorating the \u2014 the\nChristmas tree. I took every candy out, as a joke, and \u2014 and have only empty candies\nthere, I didn\u2019t need the candies. But it was a joke, and it was accepted as a joke, but\nwhere did I come to do this [indecipherable] but I did survive. The \u2014 the gift that I\nbrought to the commandant that I made, was packed as a gift from \u2014 from me. The\nfamily had gifts \u2014 gifts for me for Passover. It\u2019s a \u2014 it was a crazy time out, a-at\ncrazy times, crazy places. Sosnowice was different, separate from \u2014 from anything\nelse you \u2014 you \u2014 you can say. Nobody was \u2014",
        "Q: What \u2014 what kind of a factory was that \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 82",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were in \u2014 in Sosnowice, they had to march a certain dis-\ndistance, and oh \u2014 oh \u2014 oh yes, I \u2014 when they started to tear with running away to \u2014\nto the partisans, I \u2014 I asked the \u2014 the commandant to be \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to free me from\nmy duties, because I want to learn a trade, to be useful. And he stopped the whole\ncolumn and praised me, because \u2014 and I actually wanted to see \u2014 to give a chance to\nrun away, and \u2014 and to see her more often. She was much older, with knowing eyes,\nshe knew exactly what it\u2019s doing to me. I was the hungry. I was rested. It\u2019s \u2014 so, that\nwas \u2014 that was \u2014 so one morning \u2014 one morning, everything is packed. I didn\u2019t have\nto worry any more what choice I am making, it was a difficult choice to be\ncourageous, to run away. I didn\u2019t know if I had the courage. And we started to \u2014 to\n[indecipherable] at Gliwice, the commandant unloaded his stuff, his furniture, and\n\u2014 and it occurred to me that I will ask him that \u2014 maybe to hide in the furniture and I\nwill help the family later on. But I chickened out on that as well. After \u2014 after that,\nthat young SS man was crazy, the \u2014 going around and shooting people; he had so\nmuch energy. He brought me \u2014 at the end of the day he brought me his coat,\nspattered with blood, to wash out the blood. And I was washing out the blood, and\nfelt sick over it, brought it to a place where \u2014 where they \u2014 where the SS were\nsleeping on the floor with \u2014 with \u2014 and there was a panzerfaust or something, you\nknow, a grenade, and I thought \u2014 I thought if I will grab the grenade and throw it,\nmaybe we\u2019ll change our \u2014 because we could hear the Russians in the back. And \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 83\nanyhow, I didn't know how to actuate it. It\u2019s \u2014 Is \u2014 I saw a movie only recently\nwhere \u2014 about a school for SS, and said that you unscrew the bottom. So for half a\ncentury I didn\u2019t know how I could have done it, but I saw the movie, right, yeah,\nnow, now. So, and \u2014 and that way we came to Mauthausen. Mauthausen was \u2014\nwas \u2014 I had, from sleeping on the ground, I had four large furuncles. I couldn\u2019t bring\nit down. I went through the selection, because it was in \u2014 in two days it swelled up\nmore and more. We had the \u2014 the \u2014 that thing written, that\u2019s me \u2014 somebody was\ngoing around writing down the names of the ones who have to go to the hospital.\nThe hospital actually was the Russian lager, and actually it was a place where they\nkill people. Put people in, and bottles of chlorinated water, phenol injections, al-all\nkind of things. So, on the way \u2014 and this might be of interest, on \u2014 on the way there,\nthere is the lageralteste from \u2014 from Sosnowice, and the lageralteste was \u2014 was a \u2014\na delegate to the \u2014 to the Reichsdeutsche\u2019s Reichstag, wha-whatever the na \u2014 the\nname was. And \u2014 and he was held in very high esteem by the raportfuehrer. I heard\nwhat\u2019s going on, the bombing, because the two of them talked, and \u2014 and later I saw\nthis lageralteste, but he was hiding his \u2014 his red \u2014 red triangle, because the \u2014 the\nkapos in Mauthausen were criminals, and not political. And \u2014 and this kapo\ncriminal was actually in charge of the Jehovah Witnesses. They have some tailoring\nblocks, or whatever. So he talked \u2014 he talked to \u2014 to that kapo as we pass. My group\nwas halted, and \u2014 and they\u2019d say talk to the Yugoslav, and I was brought to that \u2014 to\nRG-50.030*0580 84\nthat hospital, which I didn\u2019t know, only that it\u2019s not a good place. I didn\u2019t know that\nI will go to death. And some SS put me on a table from \u2014 from stone, and he started\nto cut and I started to faint. He sprayed something and I fainted again. And I was\nbrought to the block. I was brought to \u2014 I don\u2019t know when and how I was brought\nto the block.",
        "Q: But it was in Mauthausen?",
        "A: It was in Mauthausen, and \u2014",
        "Q: Not gunski \u2014 Gunskirchen?",
        "A: No, it \u2014 1t was Mauthausen, it was \u2014 it was the \u2014 the quarantine, two \u2014 two \u2014",
        "Q: Uh-huh, the quarantine.",
        "A: \u2014 two \u2014 two blocks were quarantined.",
        "Q: Right, yeah.",
        "A: So\u2014so I was \u2014 I was lying there, I didn\u2019t have to stand up for a \u2014 to be counted.\nBefore that, she helped me to stand and I was collapsing the moment. But that \u2014 they\nlet me recover, I wrote poetry again. There were some Poles there again. And again I\nwas helped, and \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2014I didn\u2019t take myself the luxury that actually\nwhat I write is empty phrases, you know. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 was good to have their\nsupport. And \u2014 and then \u2014 then, one \u2014 one \u2014 one evening, I\u2019m sleeping inside there,\nan-and somebody gets to me and signals to me to go. This 1s the blockalteste of this\nblock, the quarantine, an Austrian. And I heard that two days before, he killed a\nRG-50.030*0580 85\nHungarian boy in the washing \u2014 washing \u2014 where y \u2014 where you wash hands of \u2014\nyou kno \u2014 you know that? And he \u2014 and he tells me to go to his cubicle, also a\ncubicle with \u2014 with clothes. And I made \u2014 I made noise to wake up people and he\nretreated. And the next morning everyone goes to the appell to \u2014 to that count, to the\n\u2014 we knew that we are going to the count to the big square, not the \u2014 for counting\neveryone. And as I am passing by, he is waiting with a milkmaid\u2019s stool, and he\nthrows it straight on my head. A-And I managed to sneak out from under it, and run\nout, but \u2014 but this was \u2014 this was my last \u2014 last day of life. I was standing there for\nhours, and \u2014 and I knew it\u2019s the last day of \u2014 of my \u2014 my life, and I was making\npeace with it; everybody died, everybody died, and \u2014 and now I\u2019m going to die, and\n\u2014 and that\u2019s it. We were standing, and later separated Jews from non-Jews. We were\nsome 300 Jews. They brought us down to lager number \u2014 number three, which is a\n[indecipherable] lager. We were there maybe a couple of days, I don\u2019t know, it was\nvery, very cold, freezing at that time. And later they brought us over to a\u2014 toa\n[indecipherable] lager. This means there were so many people coming from the\nfront, Hungarians mostly, and many Mischlings, with families, w-women and\nchildren, that they brought those o \u2014 those [indecipherable] in those tents \u2014 tents,\ncircus tents, and tha \u2014 they were overflowing. There were [indecipherable] and \u2014",
        "Q: But it was still in \u2014 in Mauthausen?",
        "A: It was still in Mauthausen, but just the temporary [indecipherable]\nRG-50.030*0580 86",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: \u2014 all around. And then a small plane comes. And \u2014 and the plane \u2014 those people\nwere working at the front, and \u2014 and this hit them, the hunger and everything, and\nwith the families they were, the families were lying in front of their families \u2014 of the\nother member. And a small plane comes and it shoots up the towers in Mauthausen.\nSome wer \u2014 somebody must have written about that, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: It was a Soviet plane, or \u2014",
        "A: A Soviet plane, they think. They think that one Soviet was there, and he says, I\nwill be here later. This means like he\u2019s going to run away. It was a Soviet \u2014 a Soviet\nplane, shot on the towers. And later, through two rooms on the \u2014 on the SS barracks.\nWhat he didn\u2019t know, he couldn\u2019t have known, that near the barracks now are those\ntents, and the bombs fell into the tents. So, there was that all over, and pieces of\nflesh. There was no place for everybody in the tent. Flesh on the wires around that.\nThe next day there was \u2014 there were cooking fires, that the people still had utensils\nfrom their trip. Kaduk(ph), a raportfuehrer from Auschwitz was going around.\nWherever he saw something in a pot which was suspicious, he would kick it over\nand shoot a few people. Other fires were going, people were not exactly running\naway. It was extraordinary, it was not like from living people running away,\nscurrying away, and him going and sh-shooting people. Later on, there was no \u2014\nthere were no bombs, and you could see missing buttocks on people still alive, still\nRG-50.030*0580 87\nthe \u2014 the mouth is still moving. I didn\u2019t tell it to anyone. And when I wrote I only\nwrote that those were \u2014 well, from \u2014 from \u2014 from Mauthausen, from this place, we\nwere sent \u2014 and we \u2014 we were \u2014 we \u2014 we had lice right away. The ones from the\ncamp didn\u2019t have lice, but the ones from the trip never had a chance to \u2014 to wash\nthem \u2014 wash themselves. And we were taken over to \u2014 to Gunskirchen. Gun-\nGunskirchen not \u2014 not far from Linz and so on. Th-The weather was better, we \u2014\nwe \u2014 we ate grass. We ate some escargots from the grass. Came to Gunskirchen,\nGunskirchen was \u2014 was the place to die. I was dying. There was no place to lie\ndown inside, outside it was rain. So people went on and use \u2014 use the belt to remain\non the rafters. I did, too, but you couldn\u2019t go out, if you go out, they would not allow\nyou to come back. Some people didn\u2019t care. I crawled down, I couldn\u2019t come back.\nRemained there near the \u2014 near the dig-out, which was from before, with feces and\nso on, and \u2014 and in the rain. And \u2014 and the Americans came. Hesitated a little bit,\nwhat they will do, whatever. And that\u2019s how I wound up in the hospital. And th-\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014- I\u2014 I have never \u2014 never had a chance to \u2014 to say all the things\nthat I am saying now. It 1s \u2014 like, people don\u2019t know \u2014 don\u2019t know, and it \u2014 and \u2014\nand it\u2019s \u2014 and it\u2019s probably hard on everybody.

        "A: Well, it\u2019s not a question of \u2014 of a break. I could be more concise, but it was in \u2014\nin a way I don\u2019t know how noticeable it was, but it was like a \u2014 a stream of \u2014 of\nconsciousness. I never thought about \u2014 about the \u2014 the willu \u2014 the Willie, the one\nwho probably saved my life, o-or wanted me to \u2014 to be a s-sex \u2014 must have been\ndrunk, because he had a woman, and \u2014 and this.

        "A: It \u20141t was an Austrian hospital, as far as I know. The upper \u2014 the uppist \u2014 the\nthird floor was for wounded German soldiers or SS. The second \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the\nsecond \u2014 the lower floor from that was for the \u2014 for the citizens of Linz. The ones\nfrom the concentration camp and the hospital, around by an American captain or\nsomething, but with the old crew of doctors and nurses, or whatever, the wa \u2014 the\nones in the \u2014 1n the lowest thing, this was the basement, this was us. The Ukrainian\nnurse and the \u2014 was going around to give injections, she had a basket with\ninjections. There was no time to go around the bed, there was no place to go around\nthe bed.

Maybe the captain wanted to be\nnice, a nice occupier and we were an unknown species, whatever, we had the worst\ntreatment.

        "A: There was either Lin-Linz or where else I don\u2019t know, although I remember the\nname of the place, Alpenjager Caserne. And I don\u2019t remember how long I was\nRG-50.030*0580 92\nthere to \u2014 to continue a story just a little bit beyond, 1s when I could, I got a paper\nfrom the \u2014 from the city hall, by an American, and who wa \u2014 who was there in city\nhall, to \u2014 to afford me a assistance as I look for my mother, because there was still\ntime for illusion about her right away then. So, I-I \u2014 I-I was \u2014 I was going around\nwith that paper, and then I see a group of people [indecipherable] you have to sleep\nover, eat something. They were going to Switzerland, and they told me to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nlower my age, because they were supposed to take youngsters to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nSwitzerland, about the school \u2014 school level, a certain school level. They didn\u2019t\nknow much either about what was happening. School level. So she told me, just put\n\u2014 put less [indecipherable]. And I was later on those \u2014 I was stumbling over those\ndates. Once you have a piece of paper, everything starts to emanate from the piece\nof paper, and \u2014 and then you leave it alone, and then you find su \u2014 as I, that I was\ngoing around with a \u2014 a incorrect date, which, it shouldn\u2019t matter much.",
        "Q: So, did you go to Switzerland?",
        "A: So I\u2014I registered to go to Switzerland, but a little bit further, there was another\nlegation, English. Okay, and \u2014 and they were \u2014 and \u2014 and some of the English are\nthe ones that jer \u2014 Gilbert is writing about from the boys of Birkenau. Now, th-the\nnext legation was American. As \u2014 so I had to sleep over, and so on. They were\nencourage \u2014 they didn\u2019t have enough \u2014 enough youngsters. They all came out with a\ngoodwill gesture, but they didn\u2019t have enough, at this area, there, they didn\u2019t have\nRG-50.030*0580 93\nenough young people survivor that they can \u2014 that\u2019s why they say \u2014 say \u2014 say that\nyou are less in age. And then I saw a soldier, a soldier surrounded by people,\nspeaking Yiddish. A pole that here was written Palestine. And then I rem \u2014 then I\nremember how I talked to him at length, or where \u2014 when there was a chance I\nwaited out a \u2014 the crowd and so on. He told me the best way to find relatives is to go\nto Israel, once they have a specialized \u2014 a specialized facility, they call it\nmabrodliki(ph) puskravym(ph), the Institute for Finding Relatives. And \u2014 and\nthen, you know, you don\u2019t have a telephone, you don\u2019t have this, you don\u2019t have\ncommunication. You \u2014 it \u2014 it really, it has to be a chance once to a thousands that\nyou touch base with someone who knows something. As \u2014 an-and then, I remember\nthat during the war we also said that if we separate, then \u2014 then those people will be\nour contact. So I went to Israel, and that\u2019s where I was for 11 years. I was there a\nstudent, I was a volunteer in the pel-mah(ph). I was later a \u2014 a teacher, for some\nthree years. My wife was from Canada, we \u2014 we were not sure where we will be,\nbut decided to give one year to Canada, which with the birth of my son and so on,\nturned into a permanent thing. So \u2014 so that \u2014 that\u2019s what happened after the \u2014 the \u2014\nthat means the fact that \u2014 that I found myself in Canada.",

The Russians put them on\na train, that\u2019s what I learned from others, because they register to come back, the\nRussians considered this a risky element of people, because they want to go back to\nGermany. They wanted to go back to Germany to fetch my parents and I. But all\nthat train was sent to Siberia. Would they have stayed, they would maybe survived.\nAs it is they ran away from the train, into the forest, hiding from the Russians,\nstarting to fight the Germans, even before the \u2014 officially the partisan organization\nwas \u2014 was known, or whatever \u2014 ever ge \u2014 organized.",

        "A: From \u2014 from there we started to take ahead of the Germans. Terrible exposure,\nright away people killed, maimed, horses and the deaths \u2014 those are circumstance on\nwhich my brother and us separated and couldn\u2019t find each other. And we continued\nthat way just ahead of the Germans, til Warsaw. And we went through the\nbombardment of Warsaw, at which point th \u2014 a German unit rounded up the men\nand \u2014 young men and men in general, and was starting to marching them back in the\ndirection of L\u00e9dz.

So \u2014 so, you\nknow, it \u2014 it didn\u2019t finish with that first trek, to [indecipherable] if anything it was\nan \u2014 the beginning of a \u2014 a harrowing experience. The people in one of the places\nRG-50.030*0580 11\nwere Jews who got the Germans somehow to agree to feed the people. I don\u2019t\nremember what \u2014 what town it was. A cow was slaughtered and \u2014 and everyone was\nfed, including us, children, family and so on. And we continued \u2014 and I don\u2019t know\nwhere we continued because I begged a German soldier to allow my father not to\ncontinue, with my few words of German. I went in the house [indecipherable] and\n\u2014 and he allowed my father to stay in one of those places as we move on, so I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to the main group. But my father remained, and that\u2019s when\nwe returned to Sieradz to find the Germans in our house. That\u2019s when we came to\nLodz and found ourselves in \u2014 in a get \u2014 a ghetto life.",

I know that when the ghetto \u2014 when the people with the ghetto things started,\nand the Germans came, and to \u2014 and to speed up the process shot a number of people\non Piotrkowska, where we were, we didn\u2019t stay around.",

This was near the wires. We were assigned \u2014 we were assigned\na room, a one room not heated. Two beds, iron beds. And while the ghetto was being\norganized, and the houses were \u2014 were given \u2014 were kind of being distributed, which\nagain played a role in my \u2014 another survival. Yeah, I was hesitant what I thor \u2014\nwhatever I would have, because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s like cinema, you know, like \u2014 like\nsomething is going to happen, and \u2014 and \u2014 and in the last minute something turns \u2014\nturns it around. So only when I look at it I say, I would hardly believe so many\nthings happening to so many people. Nevertheless, when I came to Israel on a \u2014 on\na ship, we were maybe a thousand of boys, we were more or less, all of us had the\nsimilar story. Many instances of survival against odds.",

And \u2014 and then I ask, my very next thing, to answer your question\nin a roundabout way, was that I was looking for a boy named [indecipherable] who\nwas where I was working on a kosa, the son of \u2014 of a well-to-do family before the\nwar.

At the same time, Enjay(ph), a \u2014 a new Polish writer, got in touch with me\nabout something, he wrote a book. Enjay(ph) Vart(ph), a new promising Polish\nwriter and he said he \u2014 he loves Sieradz, and if I need something for \u2014 for him or\nwhatever, he will \u2014 he will go, but I didn\u2019t want to impose on him, because there\nmay be a \u2014 really a bit of work to sort it out.

At \u2014 but I \u2014 I wrote spontaneously, I read and wrote before the\nRG-50.030*0580 29\nage of five, the age of five, just not learning formally, only reading \u2014 reading\nwhatever I could on the street, or wherever.

And \u2014 and\ndesign of automation systems, things which don\u2019t exist yet. So \u2014 so I say yes, we \u2014\nmaybe every child 1s creative til public schooling knocks it out of him.",

        "A: Y-Yes. In \u20141n the ghetto that\u2019s how I survived, because of that. I will be able to\nrelate to you \u2014",
        "A: Y-Yeah, and it will also \u20141-1t will also maybe fit the narration of \u2014 of what\nhappened. On Piotrkowska 82, there was a \u2014 there was a family, their name was\nKrikos(ph), and she was a fashion designer, a known one, with international ties,\ntravels to [indecipherable] and so on. Her husband was taken away and killed in a\nprison. She remained alone and my father and I, my mother, were there helping her\nwith anything we could. I was \u2014 I was making sure that she has enough wood for the\nfireplace and things like that. Although it \u2014 it was just the beginning of the need of\nthe wood. In the \u2014 in the ghetto, we met at the beginning and \u2014 and then all at once\neverything got to be a problem, distance was a problem, time, energy mostly was a\nproblem, and so on. But she maintained \u2014 maintained contact with us, and aware to\nwhat\u2019s going on in our lives. She herself worked as one of the fashion designers or\nmanager in a Beschen(ph) \u2014 Beschen(ph) Kleider factory, one of six Beschen(ph)\nand Kleider factories. Now, when \u2014 when I brought the bread to my mother and I\ngave it to her, a Jewish policeman grabbed me, took me into \u2014 into an entrance of\nRG-50.030*0580 31\nthe house across Lagiewnicka and he beat me up. I was not supposed to be outside\non the street. And now I think maybe he saved my life at that time, because if I\nwould join them, I would be gone. But anyhow, it\u2019s \u2014 I was very humiliated. I think\nthis what hurt the most. And in the middle of the night, I went to \u2014 to M-Mrs.\nKrikosava(ph) where she lived in Marysin. A-And I told her what happened, and\ncan she either li \u2014 arrange for me to join my mother, or \u2014 or get my mother out of\nthat transport. I didn\u2019t hear much \u2014 much about that, but when my mother was\ntaking away, this was \u2014 this was my \u2014 oh, I t\u2014 I didn\u2019t feel that \u2014 that I want to go\non, especially. I wouldn\u2019t spend energy, I didn\u2019t have ener \u2014 I didn\u2019t go for my bread\nration, which is once in 10 days or something, which means death, dying, not \u2014 no \u2014\nand di\u2014 she appeared. And she took me to her office as a runner, in order to have a\nsoup a day, and to survive \u2014 to survive on that soup or whatever til \u2014 til the \u2014 til the\ntime comes for the regular allocation of food. And now \u2014 now my story gets\ninteresting, because as I was there, there was an inspection by the chief engi \u2014 by the\nchief of the Bescher(ph) and Kleider. To tell you also that when we came to the\nghetto, there was somebody who was distributing the apartments. The one who was\nthe manager of our area was a name by the name of Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph).\nBolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph) was now \u2014 was now in charge of those factories, and \u2014\nand Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch(ph) is the one who entered, and he stopped near me,\nand kind of, I thought accusingly, he is ask me how do I \u2014 what do I know you f-\nRG-50.030*0580 32\nfrom? And I say, from the cultural evenings, because he was attending. So he \u2014 he\nwent ahead and I thought he 1s going to throw me out, he knows that this 1s\nfictitious, me being there, and eating the soup. But Krikosava(ph) followed, and\ntogether with other people, the manager, and she smiled to me, that me said nothing\nbad happened. And this continued for, I don\u2019t know, two or three days. After \u2014 after\nwhich, the droshka(ph) firm with Rumkowski with the white horse, stopped in the\nfront of the building, they called me out and they took me to Balucki Rynek. And\nBalucki Rynek was sitting Rumkowski, and on both side female secretaries and\npeople, and so on, and \u2014 and a \u2014 and they kind of \u2014- Rumkowski a-asked me a few\nwords, and the other people, and I z\u2014 I saw Anodinka(ph), the head, and I am being\ntaken to the house of Rumkowski, which was divided into four apartments. And in\napartment number one, was the apartment for Dora Fuchs. That\u2019s the first time I\nlearned about anybody like Dora Fuchs. Rumkowski, everybody sign \u2014 sings \u2014\nDora Fuchs was very often doing the things that they complained about, and that\nRumkowski fought against, but this wasn\u2019t known publicly, this I learned later. And\nBernard Fuchs, her brother, who died in Connecticut just a few years ago, his wife\nis still alive, Irena.\nRG-50.030*0580 33",
        "A: Bert \u2014 Bert \u2014 Bert Fleming, yes, he found me. He found me when I was in\nFlorida at one time, an-and ...",
        "A: He \u2014 he married Irena at that time, and a place became available for me. And\nthis was in Dora\u2019s \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Dora\u2019s apartment. So, although the house was \u2014 it\nwas a small house, Rumkowski, Jusef(ph) Rumkowski, Eric Yakobovitch\ndownstairs, Dora downstairs. Eric Yakobovitch had another house in Marysin, so\ndid Rumkowski, or whatever. So, I was given the place, my clothes were thrown\naway for a good reason. And people came to take measurements for my shoes, for\nmy pajamas, for my this, and so on. And all at once there was a \u2014 a \u2014 there was a \u2014\nfood, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and books. And that\u2019s how I came, because of Bolek(ph)\nbeing this \u2014 Rumkowski has given out a di-directive, I think, to the ones who are\nwell-off in the ghetto should \u2014 should adopt one of the \u2014 one of the children,\norphans, who remained orphans at that time. Dora was very much \u2014 very much\naware of what\u2019s the tone to give to herself and to her persona, and I was part of it,\nexcept I was in the house. In reality, I was mostly upstairs with Rumkowski,\nbecause there was a boy there, Stanislaw Stein(ph), not many people know about\nhim, and when I heard the story what happened to Rumkowski when he went to the\ncamp. They say that he \u2014 a brunette woman, younger woman, and a teenage boy,\nRG-50.030*0580 34\nblack hair, was on that open wagon, so I know yes, this must be the right version\nbecause this was Stanislaw, who wanted to come with Rumkowski.",
        "A: Stanislaw? He\u2019s a\u2014 he\u2019s a \u2014 his parents were dead, he \u2014 he was \u2014 he was a very\nquiet guy \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I was his only friend, I think. Pardon?",
        "A: He was younger.",
        "A: And \u2014 and he had the Bar Mitzvah, as a matter of fact, at the beginning of 1944.",
        "A: But things happened \u2014 happened in the meantime, and I \u2014 I did \u2014 that\u2019s not the\nfirst time that I did a self destructive thing, but I also did it at that time. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014\nit\u2019s a small item, but it\u2019s important because it took my train sideways towards not\nsurviving. And this was when I \u2014 the first time when \u2014 when Dora came home from\nwork, the same day, she passed without looking, she passed into her room. The\nhousekeeper brought a box of bonbons, and she said that I am a very nice boy, but\nshe wants \u2014 she wants to note that she\u2019s a very busy person, and she doesn\u2019t have\nany time away from her work. So it was \u2014 that means this \u2014 I didn\u2019t understand\nRG-50.030*0580 35\nexactly what it was, but there was food, and there was \u2014 and later \u2014 but \u2014 but I had\nmy idea with her moral \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 more \u2014 more because she was such a good pretender. I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: It \u2014 it was never clear. It was floating in the air.",
        "A: It was not \u2014 officially, I was sleeping in her place. Our \u2014 our lessons, the teacher,\nlunches and so on, were \u2014 were in upstairs in Rumkowski\u2019s study. When years,\nyears later I was in Tel Aviv, and there was an exhibition of things from the ghetto,\nand \u2014 and I recognized some of the things, and I said, I have never been to the Tel\nAviv University Museum of \u2014 of whatever, so how can it be that I say I have been\nhere? No, I haven\u2019t been there. So \u2014 but then I remember. Every time Stanislaw and\nI, we had to have our lessons, he would \u2014 he would \u2014 we would have to take off the\ntable all kind of gift that Rumkowski was getting all the time. Ta \u2014 they sang\n[indecipherable] to him, he \u2014 he \u2014 he was the greatest man in history. I \u2014 I think\nthat there are very few people in the world who can withstand endlessly that kind of\nflattery. With engravings, with here and there. We had to take off that things almost\nen masse, and put it \u2014 put it on the side to have place to do our lessons in his study.\nAnd we don\u2019t know if somebody put it back for his attention or not. No, 1t was \u2014 it\nRG-50.030*0580 36\nwas a job by itself just to follow \u2014 a \u2014a portrait of his would hang on the wall, and \u2014\nand a little item would be there, and the \u2014 the rest was a big accumulation. So our \u2014\nour teachers were Dr. Rabiner(ph) Berliner(ph) from \u2014 from \u2014 from doctor \u2014 Dr.\nRabiner(ph) Berliner(ph) from \u2014 a \u2014 a place in germa \u2014 Hannover, maybe. I\u2019m \u2014\nI\u2019m not sure. Dr. Rabiner(ph) Berliner(ph), he said that his wife has her dates til\nthis from the Spanish Inquisition still, his wife has a \u2014 this 1s \u2014 there was somebody\nfrom the \u2014",

This \u2014 in the ghetto we didn\u2019t know, and the\npeople who knew, knew. This is number one. Number two, I will get it off my \u2014 my\nmind, but there was when \u2014 when Mrs. \u2014 when the Fuchses \u2014 the father Fuchs was a\ntailor, when \u2014 when the Fuchses came \u2014 came to \u2014 to L\u00e9dz, to the ghetto, a family\ntook care of them.

And to \u2014\njust to be converted very, very quickly and forcefully into being the housekeeper,\ninto being like the maid and so on. She often cried, and I often talked to her. I was\nstill not to familiarize with the help, but Mrs. \u2014 Mrs. Fryman(ph) went to a doctor,\nand she had to go to a doctor maybe because she didn\u2019t want that Dora should know\nthat she went to a doctor at all, you know.

He says, she\u2019s [indecipherable]\nfor Frau Fryman(ph). And now many people were working Germans on the boats\nhere [indecipherable] and they were \u2014 and they were Baltic Germans, they were not\nvery clean very often.

In the evening, one evening, Gertler is coming. Strutting Gertler\nwas the head of the police. And he 1s strutting in and the two people \u2014 the three\npeople outside, because there was already Gingka(ph), who was also coming to help\nout in the household. There were only three people in the household. There were \u2014\nthere were only at \u2014 most of the time, two people, Dora and I.

So\nBeebow(ph) comes in, and meantime, while waiting for Beebow(ph), Dora is\nasking \u2014 asking Gertler, Dawid, how did you manage it? And he opens this, and he\nsays, inspector for the Gestapo. This was \u2014 this was Dawid Gertler, he was going\naround giving people something to eat, or whatever, and he was considered like an\nextraordinary fine person. But I know that people were killed all the time because of\nhim, and he knows what\u2019s going on here. I know about what was written on his\npapers, because he [indecipherable] a very valuable, or extraordinary valuable Jew,\nsomething like that. He had a nice wife, he adopted two small children, and he tried\nto be a rubaszny, that will [indecipherable] of Europe.",
        "A: Y-Yeah, ki-kind of. A-And \u2014 and so he \u2014 it \u2014 h-he said [indecipherable] it was a\n\u2014 the din of out \u2014 and he said that he has a balia, a container for water, for a tub, a\ntub for th \u2014 with swimming fish outside, okay, but this he didn\u2019t bring into the living\nroom. And Beebow(ph) was feeding me pieces of orange and \u2014 a-and so on. So, this\nwas \u2014 this was the \u2014 all those things were heard upstairs, because there were only a\nfew stairs. Windows were open, a truck pulls up, Rumkowski is in the house, and\nall this was done under his nose. Having nose to \u2014 to Rumkowski. And Dora raised\nRG-50.030*0580 43\nher voice and said wir werden \u2014 wir werden dem alten gar nicht geben. We will\nnot give anything to the old one.

        "A: This was for me an illustration about a \u2014 a \u2014- Rumkowski part of the time was\nhelpless, and the things were done by a clique. And they allowed him to go around\nand \u2014 and get the darts thrown at the people who make hunger and everything. But\nhe, on the contrary, I \u2014 I \u2014 I know from hearing, because even if there was \u2014 there\nwas a [indecipherable] Rumkowski\u2019s courage, y-you know, in situation which\nwere dangerous to him, very dangerous to him, and \u2014 and nevertheless, he followed\nthrough, he put his life on \u2014 on line.",

        "A: This was probably his bonus because he brought many rich Jews probably to\ntheir deaths, you know, and [indecipherable]. So \u2014 so, Rumkowski was excluded.\nTo me, I didn\u2019t have to \u2014 at \u2014 at one time, and this I will not forget either, there was\n\u2014 there was \u2014 people were saying at the table, said, the Germans have left a ghetto,\nmaybe Kovno, maybe Rovno, | don\u2019t remember exactly, and they left the Jews\nintact. Now, we kind of had a feeling, I had a feeling that I\u2019m not going to live,\naround the corner there is death. I couldn\u2019t get rid of that feeling, that death is\nwaiting around the \u2014 but \u2014 but probably the \u2014 that means, like they killed the Jews\nbefore they leave the ghetto? One way or another, it \u2014 it \u2014 it was \u2014 this what came\naround. And people were talking about that, and continue with their dinner, with\ntheir galareta, with all those things that Dora was preparing; preparing \u2014 that she\nmade to be prepared.",
        "A: He was \u2014 he was \u2014 he was not a part of it, but in this case, in the afternoon, I\nwaited outside my house because Gertler said that he is going to buy me a bike.\nAccording to the historical book nobody had a bike. I had a bike. It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 so \u2014 so\nthe room \u2014 yeah, Rumkowski comes in and gets out of his dorozka and he grabs\nme by \u2014 by the [indecipherable] and he swirls me around him.

        "A: No, it said \u2014 said \u2014 said the Germans are likely to leave L\u00e9dz ghetto alone, okay,\nand not kill the people, okay. That was the big thing.

No \u2014 no one was\nhappy that they were talking about the ranks within the ghetto, the \u2014 the different\nlevels of career, res-res-resonsi \u2014 responsibilities and \u2014 and this, they \u2014 they did not\ncare. Rumkowski cared. Okay, there was no doubt in my mind that he cared. There\nis no doubt in my mind that he \u2014 he was a demigod. There was no one that \u2014 that he\nwas \u2014 that he was on a extraordinary ego trip.

        "A: It\u2019s \u2014 it-it \u2014 yeah, th-the 1 \u2014 the idea is that I \u2014 I\u2014I don\u2019t even \u2014 I don\u2019t even try. I\nbelong to a \u2014 to a book club which exists 50 years already, and whatever in Israel,\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and I \u2014 I thought that they are Holocaust deniers. They were Holocaust\ndeniers. I-I changed that one perception there, because they read some books and so\non. But \u2014 but gosh, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 they say there was nothing special about the\nHolocaust and this. Those were leaders of the communists at one time, and they\nwere \u2014 they were kind of thinking in a global terms to include everybody, and the \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 48\nso \u2014 so \u2014 actually, and I don\u2019t have friends who were \u2014 with who I can kind of\nrehash it. I-I know that in Israel people meet, and \u2014 if they were in the camp. I \u2014 I\nthink that I would like to \u2014 to \u2014 to save an insider\u2019s view, because I am actually \u2014 I\nhave to be grateful to Krikosava(ph), who died in the ghetto on tuberculosis, despite\neverything. I have to be grateful to Bolek(ph) Yakobovitch, who was the fianc\u00e9 for\nDora, h-he \u2014 he saved my life by pulling me out from there, you know, and putting\nmy ca-candidacy as \u2014 as the one. It\u2019s a \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it is \u2014 I\u2014 I would like \u2014 I would like\nas \u2014 personally that \u2014 that Rumkowski should be seen \u2014 should be seen no-not only\nin terms of \u2014 of being \u2014 what \u2014 what is th-the word, like that he \u2014 he \u2014 he tried, he\ntried. H-He \u2014 he tried. He was misguided lots of times. He tried his best, also most\nof the times. The \u2014 Gertler was bringing death to many Jews, he wound up as a hero\nafter the people were writing letters that he saved their life and things like that. The\n\u2014 the people who died, almost at his hands, which may count to hundreds and\nthousands, they cannot write letters that he saved them \u2014 their life. I think that there\nwas \u2014 there is an injustice in this one. There was a \u2014 Dora \u2014 D-Dora Fuchs, they\nwere locating me after the war, I \u2014 I wanted to go to the camp with my friends. We\nwere very \u2014 we were very, kind of connected. The [speaks foreign language here]\nthose 12 \u2014 12 or fi\u2014 15 [indecipherable] 12. Wa \u2014 wa \u2014 wa \u2014 over \u2014 over 10\nchildren who were there, some of them alive, Miraka(ph) is a writer, a writer in \u2014 in\nSweden. There is Majel(ph), there is Benek(ph), there is Chaim Kamalowski(ph)\nRG-50.030*0580 49\nfrom Wilna who \u2014 who died and so on. I \u2014 I was with them, so I wasn\u2019t any more\nparticipating on the daily things that Dora is doing or not doing. Neither did I know",
        "A: Yeah, but Dora and 500 other people, less than 500, I think, left later on, this \u2014\nthis I already heard from \u2014 from Bernard, okay? And the fact is that they were left,\nthey were left under the tutelage of \u2014 of the Beebow(ph). And \u2014 and they were \u2014 and\nthey were \u2014 they had good condition. Eric Yakobovitch had a son, Mula. Mula\nwas five years old, and there were some \u2014 a few hours, they were not \u2014 they were\nnot delivering food, or whatever, so Mula says that he want chocolate, and Eric\nYakobovitch was raging. This was in the camp, in a concentration camp, for the\nprivilege, raging, my son is hungry, where 1s the chocolate? Where is the chocolate?\nMy son is hungry. The \u2014 the chances for survival in that group, I think that very few\nhave died. The father of \u2014 of Ita Salomon(ph), which is the wife of \u2014 of Bernard,\nand she is still alive, but with the \u2014 with the Alzheimer\u2019s, which I seem to be\ngetting, maybe.",
        "A: Yeah. So, an-and say the survival \u2014 the survival was almost, almost complete, of\nthose people. Where I went, what I went through had \u2014 had very little chance for\nRG-50.030*0580 50\nsurvival. I came together very romantically wi-with the boys and the girls, and \u2014 and\nwe thought that we will live together, all of us, like a group of youngsters, but not\nmen or women yet. That we will share everything, that once we come to the labor\nthing and so on, we will support each other, and we will be strong and \u2014 and so on,\nSO \u2014 w-we came to be [indecipherable]. So, you know, in Birkenau right away,\nright away part of us didn\u2019t make it. I ma \u2014 I made it, I was small \u2014 I am small. And\nI don\u2019t know how I went through \u2014 through the initial selection. I think that I went\nthrough the initial selection because I couldn\u2019t believe I saw \u2014 we already knew, as\nwe were undressing, they already told us. When we went one way, already people\ntold us, you go to life. And \u2014 and I believer there were only maybe a hundred or 200\nfrom the whole train, and the rest \u2014 the rest went right away to \u2014 the train which\ncame a day before us, everybody went, the day after us, everybody else. Us, had a\nsmall \u2014 a small contingent of survivors. But then there was the selection, and this\ntime the selection was undressed. So, I have a white jacket, because see, it was\ncustom made still. I had from that time, so maybe I looked a little bit stronger. But\nthen we were \u2014 we were undress, and there was that figure in black going back and\nforth, and it really fascinated me, like that \u2014 that \u2014 that situation of a man deciding\nthat or \u2014 or \u2014 and I was \u2014 and I was looking at \u2014 at that \u2014 at that assessment, a-and I\nwas \u2014 I was staring. When I came there, there was kind of a movement of\nresignation that he \u2014 he put me there to \u2014 li-like he kind of o-okay, put me to, and I\nRG-50.030*0580 31\nthink was it, did my staring do 1t? My physic simply wasn\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t like a person\nfor work yet, never \u2014 never did I see [indecipherable]. I will never know, nobody\nwould never know, but I had other occasions that I remained alive because of\nsomething unexplainable, some \u2014 somebody did something, somebody had \u2014 had a\nmoment of compassion, or \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 or whatever, again and again and again,\nbecause I came to Mauthausen later on. And \u2014 and Mauthausen was \u2014 and later\nthat it was [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and then there was \u2014 then there was the hospital,\nI went on the hospital. And \u2014 and the war finished for me, not on the fifth, the war\nfinished for me, I\u2014 I know when. On \u2014 I \u2014 I must have, in my delirium, I must have\nin the hospital in \u2014 in Austria, in the basement of the hospital, I must have, being\ndelirious, and I remember talking del \u2014 del \u2014 delirious. As a matter of fact, I\nremember that I was doing some \u2014 that I was e-engage and ar-articulate whatever\nspeeches. That\u2019s what I remember from my \u2014 from my be-being in a high delirium.\nBut I must have mentioned that \u2014 the 30\" of May. That\u2019s what I was so \u2014 so the 30\"\nof May must be my date, and \u2014 because in delirium wa \u2014 it came through. And \u2014 and\na nurse brought me \u2014 there were two nurses, one Ukrainian, one \u2014 one \u2014 one was\nAustrian. They brought me a \u2014 a\u2014a card with birthday. That\u2019s the first time during\nthe war that I cried. I never cried during the war, not once.

This was in the ghetto where \u2014 which\nhunger was \u2014 was giving everybody an unendurable pain, just the \u2014 the feeling of\nhunger.

And\nthen, okay, but then I \u2014 I prefer to be \u2014 to eat \u2014 which means, like I have my\nprinciples that I have to compromise with, but \u2014 an-and ne-nevertheless, it was \u2014 it\nwas good to \u2014 to eat that. At the same time when I went over to the other children,\nthere was less food and less [indecipherable] but, at that time it wasn\u2019t a question of\nhunger or no hunger, and it didn\u2019t make a difference.",

I know that\nBeebow(ph) had lots of money, siphoned off from the ghetto, because I heard and I\nheard again, and it was obvious, and it was always kind of that we understood. I\nthink that Gertler, who all at once after the war was \u2014 he was the head of the\nunderworld before the war.

Coming \u2014 coming into \u2014 into the\nconcentration camp, and \u2014 and winding up in \u2014 in Mauthausen, Braunskirsche(ph)\nand so on.

A \u2014 a man came up on the chimney, saying\nthat there 1s only one way out, through \u2014 through the chimney, you know, so that we\nwould be \u2014 the \u2014 the old stories, horror story.

And I peeled potatoes, they\ncooked. What happened that \u2014 that night, the blockalteste, the blockalteste, which\nmeans the leader of the block, at the entrance to the main block, th-there was a little\n\u2014a little place which \u2014 which was the kitchen and also the blockalteste. In this\nRG-50.030*0580 69\nparticular place it was not only the blockalteste, but also the lagerfuehrer \u2014 the\nlagerfuehrer, this means the main \u2014 the main blockalteste, whose name was Willie.\nWillie, nobody had anything against Willie. He \u2014 he was going to Familienlager\nvery often. He was released early for \u2014 an-and sometimes people on a transport saw\nWillie, and \u2014 and it was like a friendly thing. He was a captain of a ship which sold\nthe load because of some romantic entanglement, they said. And \u2014 and \u2014 and he was\nwell known by \u2014 by the people. And the Familienlager who came from\nTheresienstadt, who were in the Potenkins(ph) village, feel it wasn\u2019t necessary any\nmore to \u2014 to present that theater to the cro \u2014 Red Cross, Swedish Red Cross. And th-\nthat Willie on one side. And now I \u2014I was working in the kitchen, doing whatever\nthey were telling me. It was getting late, but nobody told me what \u2014 what to do with\nmyself. At one point, a\u2014 a German \u2014 th-there was an SS invited that \u2014 into to those\nfestivities.

But he\ncame over to the kitchen, and he is drunk, and he is asking for water, and I gave him\nwater, and I answer him in \u2014 in \u2014 in German. So he says, oh, I know German, how\ncome that I know German? I must be a Mischling or something, and I said n-no, but\nat home, this means at home, this means Dora Fuchs and so on, we spoke only\nGerman. My first book, [indecipherable] in British Columbia, I \u2014 I read there, you\nknow, the first German book. And \u2014 and I did the most stupid thing that anybody\nRG-50.030*0580 70\ncan do in one\u2019s life, because I was embittered by \u2014 I saw the smoke coming out from\n\u2014 from the chimneys, and because he asked me, do you also speak English? And I\nsay, what for, so I burn better? A-And I showing this a \u2014 I thought, 1-in a moment I\nwill \u2014 my head will be under his boot, or he will shoot me, or he will\n[indecipherable] I \u2014 I [indecipherable] already on \u2014 already this second day, I have\nseen people killed all over the place. So he says \u2014 he kind of sobered up, and he\nsays, oh no, not boys like you. We will \u2014 we will teach you a trade, and after the war\nyou will be working for the Reich. And \u2014 and that\u2019s how it finished. The next \u2014 the\nnext day, didn\u2019t finish \u2014 it didn\u2019t finish, I didn\u2019t tell to anyone that. And this is \u2014\nthen I don\u2019t know what to do. Willie, who \u2014 who occupied a cubicle, says \u2014 says\n[indecipherable] there is a bed. A bed? People were lying on the floor all over. But\nI went bed, and he sidles up in the bed, and I am petrified, completely. I don\u2019t move,\nI am frozen. He talks to me and so on, and \u2014 and I am \u2014 I am petrified. So he started\nto talk to his little dog, and he says that he is not a good burschak(ph), he is not this,\nand so on. He \u2014 he kind of turned around and I s \u2014 I \u2014I left the bed, and I didn\u2019t\nhave where to sleep. I didn\u2019t know if to go into the block if somebody will beat me\nup. So I remained in this section in the kitchen, a-and I slept there. In the morning I\nwas woken by the din of giving \u2014 giving the \u2014 giving bread \u2014 bread and something\n[indecipherable] or whatever, to the passing people. So I helped. It was \u2014 this time\nit was some cheese, and the one from Pionki(ph), the \u2014 the butcher from Pionki(ph),\nRG-50.030*0580 71\nwho was also the cook, was very nice to me and so on, so he also gave me some\npotato from the day before, which made a big difference. And later on, the boxes,\nthe crates remained with \u2014 with the \u2014 for \u2014 with some cheese gl-glued to it. Can I\ntake it and \u2014 and \u2014 to find my friends and give it to them? Well, my friends was \u2014\nWalter I didn\u2019t know so \u2014 so well yet, but other, Benek(ph) and Chaim and \u2014 and\nso on. Benek(ph) in Maryland, here, nearby, he lives nearby. It started to \u2014 I went\nout with the box, and people absolutely attacked me, to \u2014 broke the box into little\npieces. I never found him, and there was like between the blocks, you \u2014 you had like\na promenade. There was a time that you were in between things, and you could walk\nback and forth. And I don\u2019t know if it was the same day, or the second day or the\nthird day or the fourth day. After a very short time, all at once, everybody on one\nsection of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the promenade is being like taken \u2014 taking 1n a gauntlet,\nand put into a block, and some \u2014 some people, like stronger people would be put\naside, but small people, and old people, who \u2014 who somehow \u2014 some of them were\n[indecipherable] for some time \u2014 I was new \u2014 were pushed into \u2014 into that block,\nop-opposite the 14 block. Now, thi-this \u2014 this was \u2014 it \u2014 it was so tight that 1t was\nlike \u2014 it was difficult to breathe, because everything was squeezed. No sitting, no\nthis, you know, just trying to sit in each other\u2019s lap, fighting for breath. I remember\nmy chest hurting the way it hurt now, with a \u2014 with heart disease, like empty, empty\nhurting. And \u2014 and it was in the middle of the night, middle of the night or whatever,\nRG-50.030*0580 72\nthere are cries, the lights go on, flashlights coming to \u2014 to my row, showing no this,\nthis, people started to try and make space. I was taken out from that bunch of people,\nbrought to the door. At the door was the German officer, Willie, the guy who\nwanted me to \u2014 to \u2014 to do sexual things to him, and Karl, which was the \u2014 the main\nkapo, or \u2014 aft-after Willie, a man \u2014 a man \u2014 a lame \u2014 a lame person with a stick.\nAnd they pulled me out and they put me into block number two. In block number\ntwo there was a bunk to sleep, and \u2014 and this was the first block near the SS stuba\nentrance. And the Canada commando were there. Canada commando were actually\nthe people who were \u2014 not where they do the \u2014 I \u2014 I read something, clothing and so\non. Some of the things with the Canada commando, yes, those were clothing, things\nto sort out. But the people who were working at the receival \u2014 at th-the \u2014 re-\nreceiving the people on the train and emptying this and so on, this was the \u2014 the real\nCanada commando. Most of them at that time were from Holland, where \u2014 where I\nwas. They had food and all kind of things. I was brought there, and they pass\nwithout any resolution where I belong and what\u2019s my name, or whatever. And \u2014 and\nthen I am told that I will be \u2014 I will be the runner for the SS stuba, which was the\nnext, and the SS stuba, th \u2014 it means, like if there was a raport(ph), an appell, and\neveryone had to be in front of the block, and later they would make a tally of \u2014 of\nthe people, and \u2014 and I would \u2014 I would have to run along it, and bring the pieces of\npaper. The raport(ph) pier(ph) is standing in the middle, would correlate if th \u2014 all\nRG-50.030*0580 73\nthe people are there. If not, the thing has repeated itself. Sometimes it repeated just\nin order to show people, you know, to be punitive, or \u2014 or whatever. And that what I\nwas doing, and jobs were being piled up on me. One of the SS men had the rabbits,\nand he wanted me to bring greens. The greens were \u2014 were growing near the electric\nwire, where nobody would go. But I got a number, for the first time, I got a number,\nwhich yesterday here I was in the file with my number, which is already not visible,\nalmost not visible. It \u2014 1t was a small \u2014 a small portion of that. You \u2014 you probably\nhaven\u2019t seen a number that \u2014 and \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, yo-you said something?",
        "A: This was \u2014 this was my life from that point on. I was vacillating between being\non the edge of \u2014 of death, to \u2014 to all at once being \u2014 being either better off than\neverybody else, or being worse than everybody else. And I was positioned\n[indecipherable]. So, that\u2019s what I was doing. I met there Dina Gottliebova, she\nfought about \u2014 about her paintings. So she was coming \u2014 she was coming with\nMengele in order to kind of paint characteristics of \u2014 of \u2014 of the twins 1n \u2014 in the\nghetto. When \u2014 when Mengele came to make a \u2014 a raport \u2014 a \u2014 that means just a\nselection, she would remain where I was, at the entrance to the block two, near the \u2014\nnear the stuba, and \u2014 and we talked. And we were in contact later \u2014 later on. I \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 74\nwhat coincidence, many, many years later. I think she is not well now, she wa \u2014 she\nis in California, and \u2014",
        "A: She passed away, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 the \u2014 the brick barracks were in Auschwitz proper, and those\nwere \u2014 and those were the \u2014 th-the barracks built for horses.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I\u2014I\u2014 this \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 715",
        "A: Ah \u2014 at that time, yeah. I\u2014 I \u2014 I heard talking, Karl and so on talking that the \u2014\nalso something else happened that \u2014 that I know. Once somebody came to me, that\u2019s\nmeans \u2014 those people were in \u2014 in Theresienstadt. Somebody came to me and says,\nI heard that you were in Birkenau at that \u2014 that time, and she said that they saw my\nbrother, from \u2014 from Theresienstadt, from Familienlager, there. Is it possible that\n\u2014 that he \u2014 that he was there? And \u2014 and I told her, yes, it\u2019s possible. Somebody\npassed on the same circumstances saying you shouldn\u2019t give people false hope. I \u2014 I\nfelt insulted. I didn\u2019t, but it was possible, why was it possible? On the last night,\nwhen \u2014 when they were taking out all the people from Theresienstadt, it was\nWillie, and his friend Karl, and probably contacts that he had, which allowed him to\nbring approximately a hundred \u2014 hundred people \u2014 hundred young men from \u2014 from\nthe Theresienstadt out into our end. And so they avoided being th-th-they \u2014 th-they\nremained alive. So yeah, her brother could have been \u2014 her brother survived this\nparticular person. But so \u2014 an-and then there was a dispute with those people. What\nhundred people, what are you sa \u2014 talking about? Only 22, we were the only ones\nwho remained, 22. My friend, he\u2019s a psychiatrist, and he was in this. And I said, no,\nthere were a hundred, I was there. Gilbert wer \u2014 wote \u2014 wrote a book, the \u2014 the boys\nof Birkenau, or something like that. A-And he writes about those \u2014 those children,\nand \u2014 and he \u2014 and he writes about those hundred and \u2014 there is a page for \u2014 for\nevery one of those hundred, and they are still in England, the ones who are alive,\nRG-50.030*0580 76\nmost of them are alive, and they are still in England. So this was \u2014 this was what I\nknew, that little, in the \u2014 in the camp, and \u2014 and the later, because I just met people\nfrom there and we were comparing notes on some occasion. Just how I learned, I\nthought that Dina Gottliebova is a \u2014 a \u2014 a\u2014I said that the-there was a \u2014 once, I said\n[indecipherable] I said \u2014 somebody sa \u2014 oh, I see you have a number from\nBirkenau. I said yes. So I say, I see you have a number, too. So, yes, yes, I was\nthere, in the Familienlager. And I said, there is someone on my mind that said, I\nwill probably never find out what happened to her. She was sent, so I thought she 1s\ngoing with \u2014 she is going with Mengele, she probably knows much more than the\nrest of us do. And probably \u2014 and \u2014 and she was sad. This also \u2014 this also doesn\u2019t\nallow me much hope. She \u2014 she [indecipherable] to \u2014 had a husband, Rudy, and \u2014\nand she says he is talking about Dina Gottliebova. Bobbit. I was in contact with her\nlater on, and Bobbit \u2014 Bobbit is a \u2014 is \u2014 is her husband\u2019s \u2014 her husband\u2019s name. And\nshe was fighting to get the \u2014 to get some \u2014 she was also somebody who not \u2014\nadmired her boss. And this is \u2014 she admired things about Mengele. Things were\ncoming all the time. When she talked abou \u2014 about Mengele, some kind of pride\ncame into her voice, you know? Like she would make an example. She says, I made\nhis portrait, she says. She was doing many portraits for his friends as gifts. And \u2014\nand then six or seven of those Gypsy paintings, and the wall, which 1s probably in\nIsrael, in Yad Vashem, the \u2014 the wall \u2014 the wall the seven dwarfs, that\u2019s what the\nRG-50.030*0580 77\nchildren wanted \u2014 wanted once they were there, in the Familienlager. They were in\na room, and she painted it. And \u2014 and, so the seven dwarfs. And actually, she\nmarried the man who was the author of one of the seven dwarfs, which is Bobbitt.\nSo, we are now with the \u2014 so I thought that there is no survival. There 1s absolutely,\nthere is absolutely no survival. And \u2014",
        "A: I-I \u2014 I was there when \u2014 when they took them, but this 1s the \u2014 this is the night\nthat they brought the almost hundred boys into \u2014 into the camp, into the\nZigeunerlager, the Gypsy camp. But my friends were there, and as a matter of fact,\nthey are in Montreal and now he re-retired as a \u2014 an \u2014 and he 1s writing his third\nbook in Czech, about those times, about a re \u2014 reminiscences. He 1s \u2014 their children\nare \u2014 were from childhood, with what happened, involved writing poetry on those sa\n\u2014 things. My children, I protected them as much as I could, especially since I lost her\n\u2014 their mother at the age of nine and 12. This is my daughter, she was nine when my\n\u2014 when my wife has died. So, the number \u2014 I said this is a telephone number, and so\non. Til today they don\u2019t know. Part of the fact that the family is meeting together\nhere and I am giving the testimony and will try also to leave the testimony for my\nfamily out there. This is the same, this \u2014 thi-this is part why we are here. But just an\naside, that it\u2019s good for the children to know rather to not know, because they \u2014 they\nknow anyhow, but in some dark and untouchable way. What \u2014 what happened \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 78\nwhat happened later on, I was lucky again. There was a \u2014 they were supposed to \u2014 to\ne-empty the Zigeunerlager, and I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know the \u2014 how \u2014 how those\nminds worked, but Willie was interested in my survival. Karl was nice to me. I-It\u2019s\n\u2014n-nobody bother me. I \u2014 I could help others. I knew two boys, and their father was\nput in \u2014 into a \u2014 into that \u2014 the same block where I was, and they wanted to get the\nfather out, and they gave me a\u2014 a diamond, I didn\u2019t want the diamond. And I went\nto \u2014 to one of the Dutch people that I knew, and I ask him for a couple of sardine\nboxes, so they can bribe the \u2014 the blockalteste. They went, they bribed, they got the\nfather out. Later they were \u2014 they were all going from some \u2014 on some assignment\nto work, hopefully. I gave him back the diamond and he accepted it. And \u2014 so the\nidea is, if I could, somebody was in the krankenbau, in the hospital, I will bring in\na metal container, food. But at one time the guard shot down the line. I \u2014 I was\nstartled, and I got electrified, and \u2014 and fell out while \u2014 while this happened. I also\nwas [indecipherable] flowing back, and disconnected, but it \u2014 1t was a fe \u2014 quite a\nfeeling to \u2014 to be the \u2014 I was going to \u2014 to look for Mrs. Feldman, who was the head\nof the orphanage before, that \u2014 the same orphanage. And she was not \u2014 she is an\nartist, a known person in my life, felt fine. Mrs. Feldstein. And I \u2014 I found other\npeople. They asked me for warm underwear, and \u2014 and I would be bringing to the\npeople warm underwear. One of them had the relative in Montreal, who said that\nher underwear that I brought saved her life. Whatever. It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s probably\nRG-50.030*0580 79\nmisconception with some people that it was dog eat dog and only dog eat dog. It\nwasn\u2019t. People were doing things when they could. I did too. It was almost\nsomething pushing me do something good, since, you know, like \u2014 so \u2014 so this was\nthe time, and \u2014 but I don\u2019t understand why Willie was so nice to me, after \u2014 after\ntrying to \u2014 to \u2014 to get me to be his plaything or whatever. He \u2014 he wasn\u2019t rough, or\nhe wasn\u2019t this. Talked to his dog that I am not a good boy. And \u2014 and later he is \u2014\nand I am \u2014 as the camp was going to be emptied, I am getting a letter from an SS,\nprobably the same officer, who I never, ever saw again. And that letter \u2014 with that\nletter, I was sent to Sosnowice. And in Sosnowice \u2014 in Sosnowice, I arrived and I\ngave the letter to the commandant of the camp. And he says, if you were look \u2014 you\nwere good enough to be a runner in \u2014 in Birkenau, you are good enough to be a\nrunner for me. One of the strangest things happened; if somebody would make a\nfilm, I would be the first one to say this is impossible: I was \u2014 I was running, stoking\nthe fires in all the SS have their barracks, I was stoking the \u2014 stoking the fire and \u2014\nand all that; ea-eating sometimes from the \u2014 from the SS kitchen. Everybody knew\nme, it was a small camp. I said that I was interested to see the machinery, always\ninterested me, machinery [indecipherable]. So I went for one shift, commandant\npraising me that I am interested. So I \u2014 I went to \u2014 to the factory. I liked what I saw.\nPoles were working together with the Jews from the camp, the relations were this. I\ndidn\u2019t see a Pole for years, five years, well, at that time. And it was very nice, I ti\u2014I\nRG-50.030*0580 80\nfell a little bit in love with one Polish woman who was in the center of the factory,\nwriting things down, reading poetry, so we have something \u2014 something in common.\nShe was talking something, so the youngsters that I said are running away they say,\nto \u2014 to the [indecipherable] to Warsaw, actually go into the forest, talking that\nmaybe I can go into the forest, but I will have to avoid the \u2014 the Polish partisans and\ngo 30 kilometers. It\u2019s \u2014 I made a little reading lamp in the workshop of the camp, for\nthe commandant, an SS man, a young SS man sees me and he says, oh, did you do\nit? And I said yes. So \u2014 so I say, take it. So he says, no, I will \u2014 di \u2014 you made it for\nthe \u2014 for the commandant, no I will not take it. So I say okay, so I will make you\nanother one. I \u2014 I make him \u2014 I made him another one later on. This is the young\none, who was later killing people on that \u2014 on that road and sharing the bread with\nme, and other things, which \u2014 which help me to survive. There was another SS man\nthere from Austria, who was crying his head off because he didn\u2019t hear from his\nwife, and he thought maybe they were bombed, a-and \u2014 and I \u2014 I put my arm on\nhim, saying that the \u2014 maybe the post doesn\u2019t work or things. He shared with me\nsome sugar cubes, also on the trip, on that long trip where so many people were \u2014\nwere \u2014 were killed, per we \u2014",
        "A: From Sosnowice to Mauthausen, yeah. Part of 1t was by train.\nRG-50.030*0580 $1",
        "A: No, to Gliwice, because \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because the commandant, a porky man, good-natured, but I never forgot that he\nreached his [indecipherable] in Dachau. Okay, he got to be a commandant in\nDachau, so he is not a gent-gentle \u2014 as a matter of fact, so gentle, his family, like,\nthey adopted me. I was running around the camp, I had the movement. The\ntelephone was ringing in the \u2014 in the office, I would pick it up and say, this is Camp\nSosnowice, so and so, and take a message. And \u2014 and now it looked to me \u2014 show it\nto me in a film and I don\u2019t believe it, you know? That \u2014 so this was the true. But \u2014\nbut that\u2019s how it was, that was the thing. I \u2014 I was a \u2014 a \u2014 decorating the \u2014 the\nChristmas tree. I took every candy out, as a joke, and \u2014 and have only empty candies\nthere, I didn\u2019t need the candies. But it was a joke, and it was accepted as a joke, but\nwhere did I come to do this [indecipherable] but I did survive. The \u2014 the gift that I\nbrought to the commandant that I made, was packed as a gift from \u2014 from me. The\nfamily had gifts \u2014 gifts for me for Passover. It\u2019s a \u2014 it was a crazy time out, a-at\ncrazy times, crazy places. Sosnowice was different, separate from \u2014 from anything\nelse you \u2014 you \u2014 you can say. Nobody was \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 82",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were in \u2014 in Sosnowice, they had to march a certain dis-\ndistance, and oh \u2014 oh \u2014 oh yes, I \u2014 when they started to tear with running away to \u2014\nto the partisans, I \u2014 I asked the \u2014 the commandant to be \u2014 to \u2014 to \u2014 to free me from\nmy duties, because I want to learn a trade, to be useful. And he stopped the whole\ncolumn and praised me, because \u2014 and I actually wanted to see \u2014 to give a chance to\nrun away, and \u2014 and to see her more often. She was much older, with knowing eyes,\nshe knew exactly what it\u2019s doing to me. I was the hungry. I was rested. It\u2019s \u2014 so, that\nwas \u2014 that was \u2014 so one morning \u2014 one morning, everything is packed. I didn\u2019t have\nto worry any more what choice I am making, it was a difficult choice to be\ncourageous, to run away. I didn\u2019t know if I had the courage. And we started to \u2014 to\n[indecipherable] at Gliwice, the commandant unloaded his stuff, his furniture, and\n\u2014 and it occurred to me that I will ask him that \u2014 maybe to hide in the furniture and I\nwill help the family later on. But I chickened out on that as well. After \u2014 after that,\nthat young SS man was crazy, the \u2014 going around and shooting people; he had so\nmuch energy. He brought me \u2014 at the end of the day he brought me his coat,\nspattered with blood, to wash out the blood. And I was washing out the blood, and\nfelt sick over it, brought it to a place where \u2014 where they \u2014 where the SS were\nsleeping on the floor with \u2014 with \u2014 and there was a panzerfaust or something, you\nknow, a grenade, and I thought \u2014 I thought if I will grab the grenade and throw it,\nmaybe we\u2019ll change our \u2014 because we could hear the Russians in the back. And \u2014\nRG-50.030*0580 83\nanyhow, I didn't know how to actuate it. It\u2019s \u2014 Is \u2014 I saw a movie only recently\nwhere \u2014 about a school for SS, and said that you unscrew the bottom. So for half a\ncentury I didn\u2019t know how I could have done it, but I saw the movie, right, yeah,\nnow, now. So, and \u2014 and that way we came to Mauthausen. Mauthausen was \u2014\nwas \u2014 I had, from sleeping on the ground, I had four large furuncles. I couldn\u2019t bring\nit down. I went through the selection, because it was in \u2014 in two days it swelled up\nmore and more. We had the \u2014 the \u2014 that thing written, that\u2019s me \u2014 somebody was\ngoing around writing down the names of the ones who have to go to the hospital.\nThe hospital actually was the Russian lager, and actually it was a place where they\nkill people. Put people in, and bottles of chlorinated water, phenol injections, al-all\nkind of things. So, on the way \u2014 and this might be of interest, on \u2014 on the way there,\nthere is the lageralteste from \u2014 from Sosnowice, and the lageralteste was \u2014 was a \u2014\na delegate to the \u2014 to the Reichsdeutsche\u2019s Reichstag, wha-whatever the na \u2014 the\nname was. And \u2014 and he was held in very high esteem by the raportfuehrer. I heard\nwhat\u2019s going on, the bombing, because the two of them talked, and \u2014 and later I saw\nthis lageralteste, but he was hiding his \u2014 his red \u2014 red triangle, because the \u2014 the\nkapos in Mauthausen were criminals, and not political. And \u2014 and this kapo\ncriminal was actually in charge of the Jehovah Witnesses. They have some tailoring\nblocks, or whatever. So he talked \u2014 he talked to \u2014 to that kapo as we pass. My group\nwas halted, and \u2014 and they\u2019d say talk to the Yugoslav, and I was brought to that \u2014 to\nRG-50.030*0580 84\nthat hospital, which I didn\u2019t know, only that it\u2019s not a good place. I didn\u2019t know that\nI will go to death. And some SS put me on a table from \u2014 from stone, and he started\nto cut and I started to faint. He sprayed something and I fainted again. And I was\nbrought to the block. I was brought to \u2014 I don\u2019t know when and how I was brought\nto the block.",

But that \u2014 they\nlet me recover, I wrote poetry again. There were some Poles there again. And again I\nwas helped, and \u2014 and I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2014I didn\u2019t take myself the luxury that actually\nwhat I write is empty phrases, you know. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 was good to have their\nsupport. And \u2014 and then \u2014 then, one \u2014 one \u2014 one evening, I\u2019m sleeping inside there,\nan-and somebody gets to me and signals to me to go. This 1s the blockalteste of this\nblock, the quarantine, an Austrian. And I heard that two days before, he killed a\nRG-50.030*0580 85\nHungarian boy in the washing \u2014 washing \u2014 where y \u2014 where you wash hands of \u2014\nyou kno \u2014 you know that? And he \u2014 and he tells me to go to his cubicle, also a\ncubicle with \u2014 with clothes. And I made \u2014 I made noise to wake up people and he\nretreated. And the next morning everyone goes to the appell to \u2014 to that count, to the\n\u2014 we knew that we are going to the count to the big square, not the \u2014 for counting\neveryone. And as I am passing by, he is waiting with a milkmaid\u2019s stool, and he\nthrows it straight on my head. A-And I managed to sneak out from under it, and run\nout, but \u2014 but this was \u2014 this was my last \u2014 last day of life. I was standing there for\nhours, and \u2014 and I knew it\u2019s the last day of \u2014 of my \u2014 my life, and I was making\npeace with it; everybody died, everybody died, and \u2014 and now I\u2019m going to die, and\n\u2014 and that\u2019s it. We were standing, and later separated Jews from non-Jews. We were\nsome 300 Jews. They brought us down to lager number \u2014 number three, which is a\n[indecipherable] lager. We were there maybe a couple of days, I don\u2019t know, it was\nvery, very cold, freezing at that time. And later they brought us over to a\u2014 toa\n[indecipherable] lager. This means there were so many people coming from the\nfront, Hungarians mostly, and many Mischlings, with families, w-women and\nchildren, that they brought those o \u2014 those [indecipherable] in those tents \u2014 tents,\ncircus tents, and tha \u2014 they were overflowing. There were [indecipherable] and \u2014",

        "A: \u2014 all around. And then a small plane comes. And \u2014 and the plane \u2014 those people\nwere working at the front, and \u2014 and this hit them, the hunger and everything, and\nwith the families they were, the families were lying in front of their families \u2014 of the\nother member. And a small plane comes and it shoots up the towers in Mauthausen.\nSome wer \u2014 somebody must have written about that, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: A Soviet plane, they think. They think that one Soviet was there, and he says, I\nwill be here later. This means like he\u2019s going to run away. It was a Soviet \u2014 a Soviet\nplane, shot on the towers. And later, through two rooms on the \u2014 on the SS barracks.\nWhat he didn\u2019t know, he couldn\u2019t have known, that near the barracks now are those\ntents, and the bombs fell into the tents. So, there was that all over, and pieces of\nflesh. There was no place for everybody in the tent. Flesh on the wires around that.\nThe next day there was \u2014 there were cooking fires, that the people still had utensils\nfrom their trip. Kaduk(ph), a raportfuehrer from Auschwitz was going around.\nWherever he saw something in a pot which was suspicious, he would kick it over\nand shoot a few people. Other fires were going, people were not exactly running\naway. It was extraordinary, it was not like from living people running away,\nscurrying away, and him going and sh-shooting people. Later on, there was no \u2014\nthere were no bombs, and you could see missing buttocks on people still alive, still\nRG-50.030*0580 87\nthe \u2014 the mouth is still moving. I didn\u2019t tell it to anyone. And when I wrote I only\nwrote that those were \u2014 well, from \u2014 from \u2014 from Mauthausen, from this place, we\nwere sent \u2014 and we \u2014 we were \u2014 we \u2014 we had lice right away. The ones from the\ncamp didn\u2019t have lice, but the ones from the trip never had a chance to \u2014 to wash\nthem \u2014 wash themselves. And we were taken over to \u2014 to Gunskirchen. Gun-\nGunskirchen not \u2014 not far from Linz and so on. Th-The weather was better, we \u2014\nwe \u2014 we ate grass. We ate some escargots from the grass. Came to Gunskirchen,\nGunskirchen was \u2014 was the place to die. I was dying. There was no place to lie\ndown inside, outside it was rain. So people went on and use \u2014 use the belt to remain\non the rafters. I did, too, but you couldn\u2019t go out, if you go out, they would not allow\nyou to come back. Some people didn\u2019t care. I crawled down, I couldn\u2019t come back.\nRemained there near the \u2014 near the dig-out, which was from before, with feces and\nso on, and \u2014 and in the rain. And \u2014 and the Americans came. Hesitated a little bit,\nwhat they will do, whatever. And that\u2019s how I wound up in the hospital. And th-\nthat\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 I \u2014- I\u2014 I have never \u2014 never had a chance to \u2014 to say all the things\nthat I am saying now. It 1s \u2014 like, people don\u2019t know \u2014 don\u2019t know, and it \u2014 and \u2014\nand it\u2019s \u2014 and it\u2019s probably hard on everybody.

        "A: Well, it\u2019s not a question of \u2014 of a break. I could be more concise, but it was in \u2014\nin a way I don\u2019t know how noticeable it was, but it was like a \u2014 a stream of \u2014 of\nconsciousness.

So, I-I \u2014 I-I was \u2014 I was going around\nwith that paper, and then I see a group of people [indecipherable] you have to sleep\nover, eat something. They were going to Switzerland, and they told me to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nlower my age, because they were supposed to take youngsters to \u2014 to \u2014 to\nSwitzerland, about the school \u2014 school level, a certain school level.

Once you have a piece of paper, everything starts to emanate from the piece\nof paper, and \u2014 and then you leave it alone, and then you find su \u2014 as I, that I was\ngoing around with a \u2014 a incorrect date, which, it shouldn\u2019t matter much.",
        "A: So I\u2014I registered to go to Switzerland, but a little bit further, there was another\nlegation, English. Okay, and \u2014 and they were \u2014 and \u2014 and some of the English are\nthe ones that jer \u2014 Gilbert is writing about from the boys of Birkenau. Now, th-the\nnext legation was American. As \u2014 so I had to sleep over, and so on. They were\nencourage \u2014 they didn\u2019t have enough \u2014 enough youngsters. They all came out with a\ngoodwill gesture, but they didn\u2019t have enough, at this area, there, they didn\u2019t have\nRG-50.030*0580 93\nenough young people survivor that they can \u2014 that\u2019s why they say \u2014 say \u2014 say that\nyou are less in age. And then I saw a soldier, a soldier surrounded by people,\nspeaking Yiddish. A pole that here was written Palestine. And then I rem \u2014 then I\nremember how I talked to him at length, or where \u2014 when there was a chance I\nwaited out a \u2014 the crowd and so on. He told me the best way to find relatives is to go\nto Israel, once they have a specialized \u2014 a specialized facility, they call it\nmabrodliki(ph) puskravym(ph), the Institute for Finding Relatives. And \u2014 and\nthen, you know, you don\u2019t have a telephone, you don\u2019t have this, you don\u2019t have\ncommunication. You \u2014 it \u2014 it really, it has to be a chance once to a thousands that\nyou touch base with someone who knows something. As \u2014 an-and then, I remember\nthat during the war we also said that if we separate, then \u2014 then those people will be\nour contact. So I went to Israel, and that\u2019s where I was for 11 years. I was there a\nstudent, I was a volunteer in the pel-mah(ph). I was later a \u2014 a teacher, for some\nthree years. My wife was from Canada, we \u2014 we were not sure where we will be,\nbut decided to give one year to Canada, which with the birth of my son and so on,\nturned into a permanent thing.
