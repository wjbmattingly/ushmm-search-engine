        "Q: Tell me about when you were very little, growing up. What was it like to be a little child in\nthat family in Copenhagen.",
        "A: Well, I have very pleasant memories. I remember, well I was very young, and I remember\nwhen the Germans came\u2014",
        "Q: Let's do before.",
        "A: Before the Germans came?",
        "Q: Let's back up. You were very little. You were a child. What did your father do? What was\nhis business?",
        "A: My father had a business, men's clothing business, on the main street in Copenhagen. We\nwere \u2014 he was \u2014 we were what you call pretty well-to-do. And, my mother didn't work, and I\nwas little and my sister I think she was in school. Yeah, we were both young. It was a very\npleasant life. We had a maid. We lived in an apartment and I just have very good memories.",
        "Q: Tell me, did you have lots of friends? What did you do?",
        "A: Well.... You talking about before the war?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Yes.",
        "A: I was just four years old. I don't \u2014 I just remember going downstairs and playing with a\ntricycle on the street. People weren't afraid of letting the children out alone, and I have only\ngood memories. I don't remember the other friends. It is a long time ago, but just pleasant\nmemories.",
        "Q: What do you remember of when the Germans came?",
        "A: Well, I know that my uncle called up \u2014 my, my mother's brother called us up. I remember\nthat. And he said, \"Go downstairs on the street and look up in the sky. The Germans are\ninvading Denmark.\" And I remember very \u2014 like it was yesterday going down with my\nfather and my mother and my sister looking up and all of a sudden seeing sky was full of\nblack airplanes. That was April 9, 1940 \u2014 1940, April 9th, and the Germans were coming and\n\u2014 like a little kid was excitement. I didn't realize what will happen. And the Danes fought for,\nI think, two hours and then they were occupied. They were taken over. Denmark is a small\ncountry.",
        "Q: Was there any change in your life once the Germans occupied?",
        "A: Not that I can remember. No. Denmark went on as usual. Nothing happened to the Danes or\nthe Jews and Germany was sort of a friendly takeover. The Danes cooperated. The police\nwas still \u2014 I mean they hated the Germans, but they didn't, you know they didn't fight them\nbecause there was still Danish police stay \u2014 still stayed for few years. And the government\nstayed. It was really like sort of a benign takeover for a few years.",
        "Q: Did you go to school? By that time you would be six?",
        "A: Yeah. I went to first grade. I went to Jewish school. Carolineskolen, it was called. I think I\nwent to first grade and second grade before we fled.",
        "Q: Tell me about it. Tell me about that school. What was it like?",
        "A: It was only Jewish. We were girls and boys in the class. And I liked it. It was a nice school. I\njust, I just remember now that it was Chanukah time. I remember learning the \u201cMa\u2019oz Tzur\u201d!\nin class. And I remember just one instance that \u2014 you know, although we weren't religious,\nbut it was still when you sat in Denmark in those days, you had to sit with your hands folded\nlike when you were quiet. But being it was a Jewish school and we shouldn't make a cross,\n'Ma\u2019oz Tzur Yeshu\u2019ati [Stronghold and Rock of My Salvation] (Hebrew); popular Chanukah\nsong.\nwe Sat with our hands without, without folding them, like this. It was just a, a little memory,\nbut it was interesting. And we went to school, I think it was from eight to two, like all other\nschools. And I don't know if we learned Hebrew. Denmark is really not a religious \u2014 even\nthe Jews weren't religious in those days, but 1t was a Jewish school. I, I remember some of\nmy friends. I remember one friend from the class kept saying \u2014 this was only in like 1941 or\n'42 \u2014 that she heard rumors that the Germans were going to do something to the Jews. But\nthat was like a year before it really happened that there were big boats waiting in the harbor\nto take the Jews. But we sort of didn't believe her. It proved to be right in the long run, but\nthis was like a year before. One of my classmates\u2014",
        "Q: What was your impression, as a child, of the Germans?",
        "A: Well, nothing at all oppressive. I have no \u2014 we didn't know what was going on the world and\nthe Germans did nothing to the Jews. My father had an open store with our name. My\nmaiden name is Schenbaum, which is sort of Jewish or German. And he had a, you know,\nstore with his name on and it was going on, and nothing at all happened to the Jews. We\nwent to Jewish schools. All, all Christian schools, whatever public schools, whatever. I mean\nmaybe because I was so young. Maybe my husband has different memories, but I don't\nremember anything negative at all about the occupation.",
        "Q: What did you and your friends do to play, say after school? Did you go to ballet lessons? Did\nyou take piano lessons?",
        "A: I did, yeah. But I don't know now if I am thinking if it was after we came back from Sweden\nor before. But I did a lot. I went to tap dancing, acrobatics \u2014 yes, acrobatics in Danish. I took\ndancing lessons after school. We went skiing. You know there are not that many hills in\nDenmark, but we went with a train. We went to small hills. I had a very good childhood. I\nplayed tennis. My father was an avid tennis player so we would always rent houses at the\nbeach where there were tennis courts. And we always had a maid and I just remember\neverything as being very pleasant and nice. Some of the memories are, I am sure, from when\nwe came back, because you have to remember I was young when we fled.",
        "Q: When did you get a sense of something changing?",
        "A: Only the day we heard that we shouldn't go home that night.",
        "Q: Tell me what happened.",
        "A: Well, we were told, I think it came from the synagogue, from the Rabbi. He had heard that\nthe Germans were going to round up the Jews. It was on a Friday night and we shouldn't \u2014\nnone of us should go home to our apartments or houses. And I remember we had a maid and\nshe just took care of the apartment. She stayed home, and we went. I remember, my father,\nmother, sister and I and an uncle who was married to a non-Jew, he also wanted to flee with\nus, and his wife stayed home \u2014 stayed in their apartment because they wouldn't \u2014 they\nweren't going to touch, touch the non-Jews. So the five of us \u2014 I remember, I \u2014 we put on\ntwo, two dresses and a toothbrush in the pocket. That's all we fled with. And we went and....\nWould you like to hear about how we fled? We went to the train. No. First \u2014 I remember \u2014\nfirst, we knew it would cost to flee. We would have to pay. We knew that fisherman were\ngoing to charge about 2,000 crowns a head. That's what we were told. So my father took a\ncab. On the same day in Copenhagen he went to the bank and he took money out and I\nremember he brought my mother also. We were told that we shouldn't take money to\nSweden because we weren't going to use them. And he bought a bracelet, as a matter of fact,\nfor my mother. And when I was 50, she sent me \u2014 she send it to me. And this is the one that\nshe sent me. And that is what he bought and I saw it had gotten smaller, narrower, but I\nthought maybe as a child I remember it as being bigger. But now that my mother passed\naway two years ago and I inherit the other bracelet which is exactly the same, but just much\nwider. I have that at home. But I remember that. He went to the bank, took the money,\nbought bracelet for my mother and the rest of the money he took in his pocket to pay the\nfisherman. And then he went home and we all got dressed and like I said, we had two dresses\non. It was October so I guess a coat you would wear. Remember was two dresses instead of\none. And my father probably had two suits. That I don't remember, but my sister and I had\ntwo dresses on and a\u2014 we each had a toothbrush. We bought new toothbrushes and put in\nour pockets and then we went to the train station. And strangely enough, nobody stopped us.\nNot the Germans either. I mean you could see people coming out on the train and there was\nno, no, no\u2014nobody stopped us and we went up from Copenhagen to Snekkersten, which is a\nplace that's closest at the seashore to Sweden. I mean, my father took care of everything. We\nwere kids.",
        "Q: Sure. What do you remember of that train ride?",
        "A: I remember sitting there and being a little scared, but I didn't really know what being scared\nmeant because we hadn't experienced anything bad. So it was a little bit of an excitement for\nme. And I also think we did have one suitcase along, but I am not 100 percent sure. But I just\nknew that nobody stopped us. Nobody came over and there were no Germans on the train to\ninspect it. Later on, you see all these stories of people being asked to show passports. It\nwasn't \u2014 didn't happen. The only thing that happened was, while we were away that they\nwould \u2014 they came to our apartment to ask for us. That I know and I know that our maid said\nwhen she opened the door. They knocked, Friday night, on the door. We weren't home. This\nis just what we heard. They knocked on everybody's door. They had a list from the\nsynagogue about all the Jews, where we lived and she said \u2014 when she opened and asked for\nus, she said, \"They wouldn\u2019t be so stupid to stay home.\" And she just closed the door. They\ndidn't go in. They didn't \u2014 maybe they went in to look, but they didn't take anything from the\napartment. They left everything intact. And as a matter of fact, I don't know if I am\nwondering if I should continue. My father had bought a house. We lived 1n an apartment in\nthe suburb of Denmark [Copenhagen], and he had bought a house meanwhile. But we didn't\nget to move into it and when, when we came back from Sweden, we moved into the house. It\nwas furnished and everything and he rented it out to a woman before we left, and that\nwoman married a German soldier or Kommandant.\u201d So when we came home from Sweden \u2014\nmy memories are coming back now \u2014 there were Hitler's picture all over the wall. And the\nmovers were, you know, like the Danish movers, they kicked and it was like they kicked all\nthe pictures down from the wall and you know they were very angry. But otherwise the\nhouse was standing and, you know, a lot of furniture was there and then we moved into\nwhen we came back from Sweden.",
        "Q: Okay. Let's go back to the train ride.",
        "A: Meanwhile, let's go back to the train ride. We were on the train ride. It takes about 30\nminutes, the train ride from Copenhagen to Snekkersten. I don't know why my father knew\nto get off at from Snekkersten. He didn't know anybody there except that he was closest to\nSweden, and we got off the train station, went down the stairs, you know, out off the train\nand a man comes to us. Tall, I don't remember his face exactly. He was \u2014 he looked he would\nbe about 40 years old at that time. And he said, \"I know why you are here. I am Mr. Bagge,\nHerr Bagge.\u201d Please come with me.\u201d And we just followed him and we came into a big white\nhouse and he said, \"Just stay with me. I'll take care of you \u2018til we find you a fishing boat to\ntake you to Sweden.\" And he took about a week. We stayed there and you know, we had \u2014 it\nwas upstairs. We stayed in his house. And everyday \u2014 my father's blond so he didn't look\nJewish, so he and Mr. Bagge would go \u2014 I mean my mother and I were dark or I wouldn't\nhave gone. But my father was blond and he went with Mr. Bagge every day down to the \u2014 to\nsee if you could get a fishing boat to take us to Sweden. You know, you had to get a man that\nwould take us and pay and everything. And it was hard because everybody was trying to flee\nat the same time. And one day my father came home and said he got a rowboat instead. He\ncouldn't get a fishing boat. He got a rowboat. So we would go that night. And we all got\ndressed and were ready to leave and then he didn't come to pick us, the man. And they said\nthat \u2014I think he did come and he shows his hands and they had big blisters on it from the\nnight before and he couldn't row again he said. So we couldn't go. And then, I think it took\none or two more days, my father came back and he said \u2014 I mean, he came back every time\nwith Mr. Bagge \u2014 that they found somebody would take us the next day at three o'clock. It\nwas during the day, which itself was strange that we were able to flee during the day, but I\nwas told later on that the Germans were paid off. So, the Germans that were guarding the\nharbor, it was a harbor, wouldn't say anything. So that day we just walked down from Mr.\nBagge's house. I remember when we left, I remember his kitchen had a big picture window\n* Commander (German)\n* Mr. Bagge (Danish)\nand he turned around and he cried and he just hoped we would get over there safely. He was\nsuch a wonderful man. I mean he risked his life and he didn't do it just for us. He did it, lots\nof people went through his house. And every October second \u2014 we fled October second, and\nthat day my father would always send him a present in silver to commemorate the day. I just\nheard that he had died now. But I don't know when, but he died an old man. But he really\nsaved many, many people. So we walked down to the fishing boat and I remember was the\ngoing down \u2014 you know this fishing boat has where the fish is usually square opening? We\nwent way downstairs and we were with 14 people. It took more than us, and it was a family\nthat I knew and I met the children. They were the same age as me. I just met them in Israel.\nTheir name was Marcus. I remember and they had an old aunt along and she \u2014 I remember\nher putting her foot down, in the fishing boat to go down and she said, \"Oh, I forgot my\numbrella. I have to go home and get it.\" And my father took her leg and pulled it down and\nsaid, \"You are not going back home. We are leaving.\"\nAnd, and then we all sat around, you know, was very dark down there, and they closed up\nthe, the opening of the boat and then the fisherman came on board and we left. And I\nremember everybody being seasick and I was a little child. I mean how old I was in '40? Six\nyears old? And I remember I was so proud of myself. I was the only one not being seasick.\nAnd we stayed very quietly and the boat went out. And when we were in the middle of the\nocean between Sweden \u2014 it was about 30 minutes into Sweden \u2014 between Sweden and\nDenmark, a big boat came and we were afraid it was Germans because there were soldiers\non it. They were dressed \u2014 they looked just like Germans. But it was a Swedish patrol boat\nthat came to pick us up. They came in Swedish waters. They were allowed to go out and the\nGermans couldn't.... And then we were safe. The Germans couldn't do anything. They came\na big boat and they helped us up from the fishing boat and we stayed on the deck. Then we\nwere, we were saved. And we went into a little harbor in Sweden. I think it was right outside\nof Helsingborg. Yeah, Helsingborg. And, you know, they're welcoming us; and they all look\nlike Germans because the Swedes \u2014 they were wearing the same dresses and we came in and\nwe got coffee, tea and they told us where we could stay. They put us actually in the Grand\nHotel. It's called the Grand Hotel. They paid for the suites, paid for everything and they said\nwe could stay there \u2018til if we had any relatives in Sweden we could go to them. I think we\nstayed about a week. Every day my parents would go down to the harbor to see if my\ngrandparents had come. They will still \u2014 and an old aunt I had, my grandfather's sister, they\nwere still in Denmark when we fled. And a few days later, four, five days later they came on\nanother fishing boat. I am not sure where they came from, but I know that everyday my\nparents went down to hear if they had come. And we were all saved. And we stayed in the\nhotel, until my father \u2014 my mother had relatives, an uncle in Malmo, so we went to them.\nAnd I remember in that apartment there were lots of other Danes, relatives and I remember\nwe slept on one of these beds you pull out for two, and we slept all four in them. And, and\nthe only sad thing I remember from there was \u2014 remember I was only six or seven \u2014 that the\nother children that were there, they had some relatives that bought them a little doll and I\ndidn't get a doll. I remember still that I was very unhappy I didn't get that doll. But we stayed\nwith this family. You see my father was young. My father must have been at that time when\nhe's born in 1906 so he was 30, 40 years old at that time. He got out and got a job. First, he\ngot an apartment for us, \u201ccause he had some money along, and he got us an apartment \u2014\n\u201cVastergatan,\u201d small apartment. I remember we had to buy it furnished with real junky,\nfurniture we bought it and we stayed there.",
        "Q: Where did your father get the money?",
        "A: Well, he had money. Well, he had taken some money along, but actually it cost 2,000 for\nevery \u2014 we paid 8,000, 10,000 crowns for the five of us. I remember my uncle was there too.\nBut I think that they did give us money. That's right. The Swedes gave us money. They gave\nus coupons to eat so we could go into a beautiful restaurant to eat. And they gave us money,\npocket money until we got ourselves \u2014 I mean they were wonderful, the Swedes \u2014 \u2018til we got\nourselves established. My father got a job right away selling artificial teeth. He would travel.\nI remember the little package with the teeth and he would travel and come home and he got,\nyou know, salary for that. My mother got a job in a store. What is that called? With women's\nclothes, lingerie? These were Swedish people either that we knew before. I think that my\nparents must have known them. And my sister got a job. My sister was five years older. I\nthink she was watching children, little children. And I, I just played and we lived in that\napartment the whole \u2014 in Vastergatan \u2014 during the war we lived. We moved and then we\nmoved away from our relatives moved into the apartment. Now I know my father \u2014 the first\njob was not with the artificial teeth. The first job was in a chocolates \u2014 chocolate factory\ncalled Mazetti. It is a very famous Swedish chocolate factory. And they would always give\nhim chocolate when he left to go home to us every day to the \u2014 you know they always call us\nthe \u201cflykting,\u201d\u201d in Swedish. \u201cFlykting,\u201d which means, \u201cthe refugees.\u201d And they were very\nnice to us.",
        "Q: What did you do as a child at this point? You are in Sweden?",
        "A: In Sweden? Well, the first \u2014 I don't remember when they made the Swedish school, but I\nwould say at the first half year I just played. I didn't \u2014 my best friend I remember had another\napartment. Her parents had another apartment. At the same street they rented another\napartment. We would get together to play and \u2014 so, I didn't do anything \u2018til they started\nopening a school in Sweden, a Danish school in Lund. I think it was after we had been there\na few months or maybe even half a year. They opened the school and I would go and I went\ninto third grade. And my sister was five grades ahead of me. And then we would go\neveryday to school like in Denmark. They would make it with the Principal was Danish. Her\nname was Lachman. And there was another very good teacher. His name was Bertelsen. He\n* Refugee (Danish)\nwrote a book later on about it. He wrote a book called October 2, 1943. Aage Bertelsen. He\nwas a head teacher, the headmaster. And she was the Principal. And we went to a little \u2014 I\nwent to a little school. It was like a school and a big school, probably like elementary and\nmore of a high school. And it was very pleasant. It was a 20-minute ride with a train to\nVastergatan, from Malmo to Lund. And we had regular school \u2014 we work. And my sister, of\ncourse, stopped working also. She went to school. She went to \u2014 it's called mellemskole,\u201d the\nmiddle school. Probably like ninth or 10th grade. And I remember for lunch, they had a place\nwhere we all would go to eat. It would be for kosher and non-kosher. A big place! And I also\nremember I had piano lessons in Sweden after hours, I remember. So we lived a pretty\nregular life. And then my father got this other job, which was better paid, I guess, working\nfor his friends selling teeth. That he did the rest of the, of the occupation. And, I mean, life\nwent on. It was a very good time for us. There was nothing, no hardship. We, you know,\nthey \u2014 like they gave us money \u2018til we could \u2014 very soon my father, you know, got the job,\nand my mother. We didn't need to get any money from Sweden. And also a very strange\nthing 1s that my father's business in Denmark continued, with a Jewish name, continued\ngoing, and they sent us money over.",
        "Q: How did they do that?",
        "A: I don't know how they sent the money. I just know that the Germans did not touch any\nJewish store, any Jewish home. Everything stood intact and went on as before, which is very\nstrange even after they, you know, so to speak got rid of all the Jews. I don't know how they\nsent money over, but they did. Curious. I really don't know. And I know that it went on and\nmy father's \u2014 all his employees \u2014 he had like about 20 people working for him \u2014 and they all\ntook care of it and they were very honest. They sent money over or kept it. I mean there was\nno stealing, no looting. You know, wasn't \u2014 the Danes are good people. They didn't only save\nus. They saved our things. Saved our things. So, like I said, it was, it was not a bad life in\nSweden for us. It was a good life",
        "Q: Did you hear at all about what was going on in Denmark?",
        "A: In Denmark, not so much. We didn't know the bad things that were going on in the world\nor.... No, I don't think anybody believed it or knew it. No. That's why we weren't really\nafraid either when the Germans were occupying Denmark. We weren't scared because we\nnever.... I don't think we knew or maybe because I was so young, I didn't know. But I don't\nthink we knew what was going on in the world at all.",
        "Q: What \u2014 you are in Sweden. You are going to school. By then you would have been seven,\n> Middle school (Danish)\neight, nine. You didn't hear anything about what was happening, about even in terms of\nDenmark, their attempts to round up the Jews? You didn't know about any of that?",
        "A: No. No. Well, we knew they were going to \u2014 that they were attempting and we knew that 99\npercent of the Jews were saved, because we knew \u2014 you know, we met people and, and the\nonly ones that were taken were the ones that didn't believe it and stayed home. Which was\nabout 400 people. And those 400 people were all sort of taken care of specially. I don't know\nif you want to hear about that, but they weren't.... No. Where they went \u2014 no, that's not\u2014",
        "Q: No. What we want is just your story at this point.",
        "A: Right. Well, I mean my whole family was saved. My grandparents, they also went to\nMalmo. They lived there in an apartment. My mother's parents and my mother's brothers and\nsisters with their family. Everybody was saved and they all lived either in Malmo or in\nStockholm. Somebody lived near Lund. And we got together with them, and we had like a\nnormal life there.",
        "Q: Did your parents or did any member of your family that you know of have any connections\nor involvement with the resistance or with any groups that were?",
        "A: Well, my father became a brigadier. I think it's called a brigadier \u2014 Brigade\u00ae in Danish. He\nwas 40 years old and they, they trained them in Sweden. They trained them to go back when\nthe Germany \u2014 when they, when they capitulated. When they knew that it was going towards\nthe end of the war and they were going to send them back to help round up the Germans and\nso my \u2014 the minute the war was over, my father left with the whole battalion of soldiers. And\nwe stayed in Sweden. We didn't go back to Denmark \u2018til May 28th. The war was over May\nfifth, I believe. Germany gave up. But we stayed \u2018til, you know \u2014 I guess we all, all the\nDanes went back on one big boat to Sweden \u2014 to Denmark, on May 28. And I remember that\nvery well.",
        "Q: Describe that trip.",
        "A: That trip \u2014 I just remember standing on this tremendous boat, being very happy going back.\nYou know, this was just my mother and my sister and I. And I remember when we came\ntowards the shore, all the Danes \u2014 millions of Danes, thousands of Danes were standing there\nwith red and white flags, the Dannebrog\u2019 waving, welcoming us back. And they were\nwonderful all the way. And I just remember we went to, to the house we had my father had\nbought before the war. And that's why I remember all, all these pictures that were broken on\nthe floor from German soldiers and, and I also know my sister stayed back because she\n\u00b0 Brigadier, general (Danish)\n\u2019 Danish flag (Danish)\nstayed for another month to graduate. She was in a middle school where you had \u2018til \u2014 I\nguess it's like high school here. So, in order to graduate they had to finish the year. So they \u2014\nshe stayed. I think they went to Lund and stayed there. It was like about 30 people, from that\nclass, that had to stay. And when she came back her classmates from school came to\nwelcome her in the house. I remember that. She \u2014 in our house and they came all over to\nwelcome her back. And\u2014",
        "Q: What was the\u2014? You came back to Denmark. You found this house. Did you go to your\napartment, as well?",
        "A: No, because my father had bought it before and I think that the maid probably had moved all\nthe furniture or I am not sure. But we never went to the apartment. That was rented out. But\nall our stuff was completely where we \u2014 nothing was stolen. And I know my father had a car\nbefore the war. It was still standing there. And his business was still running, with the same\nforeman and same people working there.",
        "Q: Did he get his business back?",
        "A: Yeah. He just, he just started back. And it was just running as if he had been there, there all\nthe time. Which was strange, that they \u2014 it was strange that the German's didn't close down\nthe Jewish businesses. They didn't. And I started school, and then I must start in a new\nschool. I went to a public school then, in the fourth grade. Fourth, fifth grade I stayed there.\nAnd, you know, everybody was asking us, \u201c\u201cWhat happened in Sweden? How were you\u2019re\nexperiences?\u201d And everybody was curious.",
        "Q: Did you either before or after the war, what did it feel like being Jewish particularly in\nDenmark\u2019?",
        "A: Well, there was no\u2014 the way I look at it, there was no difference between being Jewish and\nnot Jewish. And I did not come from a religious background so maybe I never felt anything\nand I remember very \u2014 I mean today I feel differently, but I remember standing outside our\nhouse with some friends. We had just been going to dance class and we were discussing\nwhether one should marry \u2014 one should stay and marry only Jewish people, and they all felt\nsure, and they were not Jewish. I remember they were saying that they felt that Jews should\nmarry Jews. And I say, \u201cWhy you marry? You are in love with them.\u201d This is my\nbackground I guess. You don't marry for religion. You marry. But we really did not feel any\ndifference, there was \u2014 of being Jewish or not Jewish in Denmark didn't. My husband might\ntell you different stories. I don't know \u2014 because he comes from a religious background. So\nit's different. But I, I didn't feel any discrimination ever. Never heard the word \u201cJew\u201d said.\nAnd I went to \u2014 well, the first few years I went to Jewish schools and when I came back, I\nwas \u2014 there was one more boy that was Jewish in the class. When I went to the higher\nschools, there was another girl. I went to an all girls\u2019 school then from sixth grade \u2018til I\ngraduated. And there were two Jews in the class: me and another girl.",
        "Q: Did you feel any difference because there were only two of you?",
        "A: No, I never even thought \u2014 it\u2019s just that I knew her and I knew her family, that I know she\nwas Jewish. But no, I never felt anything different between being Jewish and not Jewish.",
        "Q: What was it like immediately after the war in Denmark?",
        "A: How I remember that, we couldn\u2019t get chocolate. Because I knew my father would buy\nthings that nobody could get, so he would like buy \u2014 you know, it was rationing, and he\nwould get it for us. But it was not a hard life. We went to school and just classes \u2014 I know\npeople didn\u2019t have as many cars as we do now. I would go by bicycle to school always, like\neverybody else.",
        "Q: Is there anything you want to add?",
        "A: No, not really. Except that I love the Danes and I think the best part that happened to me, is\nthat I\u2019m Danish. I\u2019ve always been \u2014 I feel very fortunate to be born there and I love the\ncountry. What they did for the Jews, the way they \u2014 later on I realized what other countries\nhad done to their people, and I realized that it was not that the Germans were better in\nDenmark, it was because the Danes were better. So, I think that should be known always,\nnever forgotten. Alright?",

        "A: I was born in Copenhagen.",
        "A: October 8, 1934.",
        "A: Well, I have a mother and sister, one sister. Mother and father and one sister. She 1s five\nyears older than me. She leaves in Copenhagen still. She is married. She has two children.\nAnd I lived there until I got married. Then we moved to America.",
        "A: Well, I have very pleasant memories. I remember, well I was very young, and I remember\nwhen the Germans came\u2014",
        "A: Before the Germans came?",
        "A: My father had a business, men's clothing business, on the main street in Copenhagen. We\nwere \u2014 he was \u2014 we were what you call pretty well-to-do. And, my mother didn't work, and I\nwas little and my sister I think she was in school. Yeah, we were both young. It was a very\npleasant life. We had a maid. We lived in an apartment and I just have very good memories.",
        "A: Well.... You talking about before the war?",
        "A: I was just four years old. I don't \u2014 I just remember going downstairs and playing with a\ntricycle on the street. People weren't afraid of letting the children out alone, and I have only\ngood memories. I don't remember the other friends. It is a long time ago, but just pleasant\nmemories.",
        "A: Well, I know that my uncle called up \u2014 my, my mother's brother called us up. I remember\nthat. And he said, \"Go downstairs on the street and look up in the sky. The Germans are\ninvading Denmark.\" And I remember very \u2014 like it was yesterday going down with my\nfather and my mother and my sister looking up and all of a sudden seeing sky was full of\nblack airplanes. That was April 9, 1940 \u2014 1940, April 9th, and the Germans were coming and\n\u2014 like a little kid was excitement. I didn't realize what will happen. And the Danes fought for,\nI think, two hours and then they were occupied. They were taken over. Denmark is a small\ncountry.",
        "A: Not that I can remember. No. Denmark went on as usual. Nothing happened to the Danes or\nthe Jews and Germany was sort of a friendly takeover. The Danes cooperated. The police\nwas still \u2014 I mean they hated the Germans, but they didn't, you know they didn't fight them\nbecause there was still Danish police stay \u2014 still stayed for few years. And the government\nstayed. It was really like sort of a benign takeover for a few years.",
        "A: Yeah. I went to first grade. I went to Jewish school. Carolineskolen, it was called. I think I\nwent to first grade and second grade before we fled.",
        "A: It was only Jewish. We were girls and boys in the class. And I liked it. It was a nice school. I\njust, I just remember now that it was Chanukah time. I remember learning the \u201cMa\u2019oz Tzur\u201d!\nin class. And I remember just one instance that \u2014 you know, although we weren't religious,\nbut it was still when you sat in Denmark in those days, you had to sit with your hands folded\nlike when you were quiet. But being it was a Jewish school and we shouldn't make a cross,\n'Ma\u2019oz Tzur Yeshu\u2019ati [Stronghold and Rock of My Salvation] (Hebrew); popular Chanukah\nsong.\nwe Sat with our hands without, without folding them, like this. It was just a, a little memory,\nbut it was interesting. And we went to school, I think it was from eight to two, like all other\nschools. And I don't know if we learned Hebrew. Denmark is really not a religious \u2014 even\nthe Jews weren't religious in those days, but 1t was a Jewish school. I, I remember some of\nmy friends. I remember one friend from the class kept saying \u2014 this was only in like 1941 or\n'42 \u2014 that she heard rumors that the Germans were going to do something to the Jews. But\nthat was like a year before it really happened that there were big boats waiting in the harbor\nto take the Jews. But we sort of didn't believe her. It proved to be right in the long run, but\nthis was like a year before. One of my classmates\u2014",
        "A: Well, nothing at all oppressive. I have no \u2014 we didn't know what was going on the world and\nthe Germans did nothing to the Jews. My father had an open store with our name. My\nmaiden name is Schenbaum, which is sort of Jewish or German. And he had a, you know,\nstore with his name on and it was going on, and nothing at all happened to the Jews. We\nwent to Jewish schools. All, all Christian schools, whatever public schools, whatever. I mean\nmaybe because I was so young. Maybe my husband has different memories, but I don't\nremember anything negative at all about the occupation.",
        "A: I did, yeah. But I don't know now if I am thinking if it was after we came back from Sweden\nor before. But I did a lot. I went to tap dancing, acrobatics \u2014 yes, acrobatics in Danish. I took\ndancing lessons after school. We went skiing. You know there are not that many hills in\nDenmark, but we went with a train. We went to small hills. I had a very good childhood. I\nplayed tennis. My father was an avid tennis player so we would always rent houses at the\nbeach where there were tennis courts. And we always had a maid and I just remember\neverything as being very pleasant and nice. Some of the memories are, I am sure, from when\nwe came back, because you have to remember I was young when we fled.",
        "A: Only the day we heard that we shouldn't go home that night.",
        "A: Well, we were told, I think it came from the synagogue, from the Rabbi. He had heard that\nthe Germans were going to round up the Jews. It was on a Friday night and we shouldn't \u2014\nnone of us should go home to our apartments or houses. And I remember we had a maid and\nshe just took care of the apartment. She stayed home, and we went. I remember, my father,\nmother, sister and I and an uncle who was married to a non-Jew, he also wanted to flee with\nus, and his wife stayed home \u2014 stayed in their apartment because they wouldn't \u2014 they\nweren't going to touch, touch the non-Jews. So the five of us \u2014 I remember, I \u2014 we put on\ntwo, two dresses and a toothbrush in the pocket. That's all we fled with. And we went and....\nWould you like to hear about how we fled? We went to the train. No. First \u2014 I remember \u2014\nfirst, we knew it would cost to flee. We would have to pay. We knew that fisherman were\ngoing to charge about 2,000 crowns a head. That's what we were told. So my father took a\ncab. On the same day in Copenhagen he went to the bank and he took money out and I\nremember he brought my mother also. We were told that we shouldn't take money to\nSweden because we weren't going to use them. And he bought a bracelet, as a matter of fact,\nfor my mother. And when I was 50, she sent me \u2014 she send it to me. And this is the one that\nshe sent me. And that is what he bought and I saw it had gotten smaller, narrower, but I\nthought maybe as a child I remember it as being bigger. But now that my mother passed\naway two years ago and I inherit the other bracelet which is exactly the same, but just much\nwider. I have that at home. But I remember that. He went to the bank, took the money,\nbought bracelet for my mother and the rest of the money he took in his pocket to pay the\nfisherman. And then he went home and we all got dressed and like I said, we had two dresses\non. It was October so I guess a coat you would wear. Remember was two dresses instead of\none. And my father probably had two suits. That I don't remember, but my sister and I had\ntwo dresses on and a\u2014 we each had a toothbrush. We bought new toothbrushes and put in\nour pockets and then we went to the train station. And strangely enough, nobody stopped us.\nNot the Germans either. I mean you could see people coming out on the train and there was\nno, no, no\u2014nobody stopped us and we went up from Copenhagen to Snekkersten, which is a\nplace that's closest at the seashore to Sweden. I mean, my father took care of everything. We\nwere kids.",
        "A: I remember sitting there and being a little scared, but I didn't really know what being scared\nmeant because we hadn't experienced anything bad. So it was a little bit of an excitement for\nme. And I also think we did have one suitcase along, but I am not 100 percent sure. But I just\nknew that nobody stopped us. Nobody came over and there were no Germans on the train to\ninspect it. Later on, you see all these stories of people being asked to show passports. It\nwasn't \u2014 didn't happen. The only thing that happened was, while we were away that they\nwould \u2014 they came to our apartment to ask for us. That I know and I know that our maid said\nwhen she opened the door. They knocked, Friday night, on the door. We weren't home. This\nis just what we heard. They knocked on everybody's door. They had a list from the\nsynagogue about all the Jews, where we lived and she said \u2014 when she opened and asked for\nus, she said, \"They wouldn\u2019t be so stupid to stay home.\" And she just closed the door. They\ndidn't go in. They didn't \u2014 maybe they went in to look, but they didn't take anything from the\napartment. They left everything intact. And as a matter of fact, I don't know if I am\nwondering if I should continue. My father had bought a house. We lived 1n an apartment in\nthe suburb of Denmark [Copenhagen], and he had bought a house meanwhile. But we didn't\nget to move into it and when, when we came back from Sweden, we moved into the house. It\nwas furnished and everything and he rented it out to a woman before we left, and that\nwoman married a German soldier or Kommandant.\u201d So when we came home from Sweden \u2014\nmy memories are coming back now \u2014 there were Hitler's picture all over the wall. And the\nmovers were, you know, like the Danish movers, they kicked and it was like they kicked all\nthe pictures down from the wall and you know they were very angry. But otherwise the\nhouse was standing and, you know, a lot of furniture was there and then we moved into\nwhen we came back from Sweden.",
        "A: Meanwhile, let's go back to the train ride. We were on the train ride. It takes about 30\nminutes, the train ride from Copenhagen to Snekkersten. I don't know why my father knew\nto get off at from Snekkersten. He didn't know anybody there except that he was closest to\nSweden, and we got off the train station, went down the stairs, you know, out off the train\nand a man comes to us. Tall, I don't remember his face exactly. He was \u2014 he looked he would\nbe about 40 years old at that time. And he said, \"I know why you are here. I am Mr. Bagge,\nHerr Bagge.\u201d Please come with me.\u201d And we just followed him and we came into a big white\nhouse and he said, \"Just stay with me. I'll take care of you \u2018til we find you a fishing boat to\ntake you to Sweden.\" And he took about a week. We stayed there and you know, we had \u2014 it\nwas upstairs. We stayed in his house. And everyday \u2014 my father's blond so he didn't look\nJewish, so he and Mr. Bagge would go \u2014 I mean my mother and I were dark or I wouldn't\nhave gone. But my father was blond and he went with Mr. Bagge every day down to the \u2014 to\nsee if you could get a fishing boat to take us to Sweden. You know, you had to get a man that\nwould take us and pay and everything. And it was hard because everybody was trying to flee\nat the same time. And one day my father came home and said he got a rowboat instead. He\ncouldn't get a fishing boat. He got a rowboat. So we would go that night. And we all got\ndressed and were ready to leave and then he didn't come to pick us, the man. And they said\nthat \u2014I think he did come and he shows his hands and they had big blisters on it from the\nnight before and he couldn't row again he said. So we couldn't go. And then, I think it took\none or two more days, my father came back and he said \u2014 I mean, he came back every time\nwith Mr. Bagge \u2014 that they found somebody would take us the next day at three o'clock. It\nwas during the day, which itself was strange that we were able to flee during the day, but I\nwas told later on that the Germans were paid off. So, the Germans that were guarding the\nharbor, it was a harbor, wouldn't say anything. So that day we just walked down from Mr.\nBagge's house. I remember when we left, I remember his kitchen had a big picture window\n* Commander (German)\n* Mr. Bagge (Danish)\nand he turned around and he cried and he just hoped we would get over there safely. He was\nsuch a wonderful man. I mean he risked his life and he didn't do it just for us. He did it, lots\nof people went through his house. And every October second \u2014 we fled October second, and\nthat day my father would always send him a present in silver to commemorate the day. I just\nheard that he had died now. But I don't know when, but he died an old man. But he really\nsaved many, many people. So we walked down to the fishing boat and I remember was the\ngoing down \u2014 you know this fishing boat has where the fish is usually square opening? We\nwent way downstairs and we were with 14 people. It took more than us, and it was a family\nthat I knew and I met the children. They were the same age as me. I just met them in Israel.\nTheir name was Marcus. I remember and they had an old aunt along and she \u2014 I remember\nher putting her foot down, in the fishing boat to go down and she said, \"Oh, I forgot my\numbrella. I have to go home and get it.\" And my father took her leg and pulled it down and\nsaid, \"You are not going back home. We are leaving.\"\nAnd, and then we all sat around, you know, was very dark down there, and they closed up\nthe, the opening of the boat and then the fisherman came on board and we left. And I\nremember everybody being seasick and I was a little child. I mean how old I was in '40? Six\nyears old? And I remember I was so proud of myself. I was the only one not being seasick.\nAnd we stayed very quietly and the boat went out. And when we were in the middle of the\nocean between Sweden \u2014 it was about 30 minutes into Sweden \u2014 between Sweden and\nDenmark, a big boat came and we were afraid it was Germans because there were soldiers\non it. They were dressed \u2014 they looked just like Germans. But it was a Swedish patrol boat\nthat came to pick us up. They came in Swedish waters. They were allowed to go out and the\nGermans couldn't.... And then we were safe. The Germans couldn't do anything. They came\na big boat and they helped us up from the fishing boat and we stayed on the deck. Then we\nwere, we were saved. And we went into a little harbor in Sweden. I think it was right outside\nof Helsingborg. Yeah, Helsingborg. And, you know, they're welcoming us; and they all look\nlike Germans because the Swedes \u2014 they were wearing the same dresses and we came in and\nwe got coffee, tea and they told us where we could stay. They put us actually in the Grand\nHotel. It's called the Grand Hotel. They paid for the suites, paid for everything and they said\nwe could stay there \u2018til if we had any relatives in Sweden we could go to them. I think we\nstayed about a week. Every day my parents would go down to the harbor to see if my\ngrandparents had come. They will still \u2014 and an old aunt I had, my grandfather's sister, they\nwere still in Denmark when we fled. And a few days later, four, five days later they came on\nanother fishing boat. I am not sure where they came from, but I know that everyday my\nparents went down to hear if they had come. And we were all saved. And we stayed in the\nhotel, until my father \u2014 my mother had relatives, an uncle in Malmo, so we went to them.\nAnd I remember in that apartment there were lots of other Danes, relatives and I remember\nwe slept on one of these beds you pull out for two, and we slept all four in them. And, and\nthe only sad thing I remember from there was \u2014 remember I was only six or seven \u2014 that the\nother children that were there, they had some relatives that bought them a little doll and I\ndidn't get a doll. I remember still that I was very unhappy I didn't get that doll. But we stayed\nwith this family. You see my father was young. My father must have been at that time when\nhe's born in 1906 so he was 30, 40 years old at that time. He got out and got a job. First, he\ngot an apartment for us, \u201ccause he had some money along, and he got us an apartment \u2014\n\u201cVastergatan,\u201d small apartment. I remember we had to buy it furnished with real junky,\nfurniture we bought it and we stayed there.",
        "A: Well, he had money. Well, he had taken some money along, but actually it cost 2,000 for\nevery \u2014 we paid 8,000, 10,000 crowns for the five of us. I remember my uncle was there too.\nBut I think that they did give us money. That's right. The Swedes gave us money. They gave\nus coupons to eat so we could go into a beautiful restaurant to eat. And they gave us money,\npocket money until we got ourselves \u2014 I mean they were wonderful, the Swedes \u2014 \u2018til we got\nourselves established. My father got a job right away selling artificial teeth. He would travel.\nI remember the little package with the teeth and he would travel and come home and he got,\nyou know, salary for that. My mother got a job in a store. What is that called? With women's\nclothes, lingerie? These were Swedish people either that we knew before. I think that my\nparents must have known them. And my sister got a job. My sister was five years older. I\nthink she was watching children, little children. And I, I just played and we lived in that\napartment the whole \u2014 in Vastergatan \u2014 during the war we lived. We moved and then we\nmoved away from our relatives moved into the apartment. Now I know my father \u2014 the first\njob was not with the artificial teeth. The first job was in a chocolates \u2014 chocolate factory\ncalled Mazetti. It is a very famous Swedish chocolate factory. And they would always give\nhim chocolate when he left to go home to us every day to the \u2014 you know they always call us\nthe \u201cflykting,\u201d\u201d in Swedish. \u201cFlykting,\u201d which means, \u201cthe refugees.\u201d And they were very\nnice to us.",
        "A: In Sweden? Well, the first \u2014 I don't remember when they made the Swedish school, but I\nwould say at the first half year I just played. I didn't \u2014 my best friend I remember had another\napartment. Her parents had another apartment. At the same street they rented another\napartment. We would get together to play and \u2014 so, I didn't do anything \u2018til they started\nopening a school in Sweden, a Danish school in Lund. I think it was after we had been there\na few months or maybe even half a year. They opened the school and I would go and I went\ninto third grade. And my sister was five grades ahead of me. And then we would go\neveryday to school like in Denmark. They would make it with the Principal was Danish. Her\nname was Lachman. And there was another very good teacher. His name was Bertelsen. He\n* Refugee (Danish)\nwrote a book later on about it. He wrote a book called October 2, 1943. Aage Bertelsen. He\nwas a head teacher, the headmaster. And she was the Principal. And we went to a little \u2014 I\nwent to a little school. It was like a school and a big school, probably like elementary and\nmore of a high school. And it was very pleasant. It was a 20-minute ride with a train to\nVastergatan, from Malmo to Lund. And we had regular school \u2014 we work. And my sister, of\ncourse, stopped working also. She went to school. She went to \u2014 it's called mellemskole,\u201d the\nmiddle school. Probably like ninth or 10th grade. And I remember for lunch, they had a place\nwhere we all would go to eat. It would be for kosher and non-kosher. A big place! And I also\nremember I had piano lessons in Sweden after hours, I remember. So we lived a pretty\nregular life. And then my father got this other job, which was better paid, I guess, working\nfor his friends selling teeth. That he did the rest of the, of the occupation. And, I mean, life\nwent on. It was a very good time for us. There was nothing, no hardship. We, you know,\nthey \u2014 like they gave us money \u2018til we could \u2014 very soon my father, you know, got the job,\nand my mother. We didn't need to get any money from Sweden. And also a very strange\nthing 1s that my father's business in Denmark continued, with a Jewish name, continued\ngoing, and they sent us money over.",
        "A: I don't know how they sent the money. I just know that the Germans did not touch any\nJewish store, any Jewish home. Everything stood intact and went on as before, which is very\nstrange even after they, you know, so to speak got rid of all the Jews. I don't know how they\nsent money over, but they did. Curious. I really don't know. And I know that it went on and\nmy father's \u2014 all his employees \u2014 he had like about 20 people working for him \u2014 and they all\ntook care of it and they were very honest. They sent money over or kept it. I mean there was\nno stealing, no looting. You know, wasn't \u2014 the Danes are good people. They didn't only save\nus. They saved our things. Saved our things. So, like I said, it was, it was not a bad life in\nSweden for us. It was a good life",
        "A: In Denmark, not so much. We didn't know the bad things that were going on in the world\nor.... No, I don't think anybody believed it or knew it. No. That's why we weren't really\nafraid either when the Germans were occupying Denmark. We weren't scared because we\nnever.... I don't think we knew or maybe because I was so young, I didn't know. But I don't\nthink we knew what was going on in the world at all.\n> Middle school (Danish)\neight, nine. You didn't hear anything about what was happening, about even in terms of\nDenmark, their attempts to round up the Jews? You didn't know about any of that?",
        "A: No. No. Well, we knew they were going to \u2014 that they were attempting and we knew that 99\npercent of the Jews were saved, because we knew \u2014 you know, we met people and, and the\nonly ones that were taken were the ones that didn't believe it and stayed home. Which was\nabout 400 people. And those 400 people were all sort of taken care of specially. I don't know\nif you want to hear about that, but they weren't.... No. Where they went \u2014 no, that's not\u2014",
        "A: Right. Well, I mean my whole family was saved. My grandparents, they also went to\nMalmo. They lived there in an apartment. My mother's parents and my mother's brothers and\nsisters with their family. Everybody was saved and they all lived either in Malmo or in\nStockholm. Somebody lived near Lund. And we got together with them, and we had like a\nnormal life there.",
        "A: Well, my father became a brigadier. I think it's called a brigadier \u2014 Brigade\u00ae in Danish. He\nwas 40 years old and they, they trained them in Sweden. They trained them to go back when\nthe Germany \u2014 when they, when they capitulated. When they knew that it was going towards\nthe end of the war and they were going to send them back to help round up the Germans and\nso my \u2014 the minute the war was over, my father left with the whole battalion of soldiers. And\nwe stayed in Sweden. We didn't go back to Denmark \u2018til May 28th. The war was over May\nfifth, I believe. Germany gave up. But we stayed \u2018til, you know \u2014 I guess we all, all the\nDanes went back on one big boat to Sweden \u2014 to Denmark, on May 28. And I remember that\nvery well.",
        "A: That trip \u2014 I just remember standing on this tremendous boat, being very happy going back.\nYou know, this was just my mother and my sister and I. And I remember when we came\ntowards the shore, all the Danes \u2014 millions of Danes, thousands of Danes were standing there\nwith red and white flags, the Dannebrog\u2019 waving, welcoming us back. And they were\nwonderful all the way. And I just remember we went to, to the house we had my father had\nbought before the war. And that's why I remember all, all these pictures that were broken on\nthe floor from German soldiers and, and I also know my sister stayed back because she\n\u00b0 Brigadier, general (Danish)\n\u2019 Danish flag (Danish)\nstayed for another month to graduate. She was in a middle school where you had \u2018til \u2014 I\nguess it's like high school here. So, in order to graduate they had to finish the year. So they \u2014\nshe stayed. I think they went to Lund and stayed there. It was like about 30 people, from that\nclass, that had to stay. And when she came back her classmates from school came to\nwelcome her in the house. I remember that. She \u2014 in our house and they came all over to\nwelcome her back. And\u2014",
        "A: No, because my father had bought it before and I think that the maid probably had moved all\nthe furniture or I am not sure. But we never went to the apartment. That was rented out. But\nall our stuff was completely where we \u2014 nothing was stolen. And I know my father had a car\nbefore the war. It was still standing there. And his business was still running, with the same\nforeman and same people working there.",
        "A: Yeah. He just, he just started back. And it was just running as if he had been there, there all\nthe time. Which was strange, that they \u2014 it was strange that the German's didn't close down\nthe Jewish businesses. They didn't. And I started school, and then I must start in a new\nschool. I went to a public school then, in the fourth grade. Fourth, fifth grade I stayed there.\nAnd, you know, everybody was asking us, \u201c\u201cWhat happened in Sweden? How were you\u2019re\nexperiences?\u201d And everybody was curious.",
        "A: Well, there was no\u2014 the way I look at it, there was no difference between being Jewish and\nnot Jewish. And I did not come from a religious background so maybe I never felt anything\nand I remember very \u2014 I mean today I feel differently, but I remember standing outside our\nhouse with some friends. We had just been going to dance class and we were discussing\nwhether one should marry \u2014 one should stay and marry only Jewish people, and they all felt\nsure, and they were not Jewish. I remember they were saying that they felt that Jews should\nmarry Jews. And I say, \u201cWhy you marry? You are in love with them.\u201d This is my\nbackground I guess. You don't marry for religion. You marry. But we really did not feel any\ndifference, there was \u2014 of being Jewish or not Jewish in Denmark didn't. My husband might\ntell you different stories. I don't know \u2014 because he comes from a religious background. So\nit's different. But I, I didn't feel any discrimination ever. Never heard the word \u201cJew\u201d said.\nAnd I went to \u2014 well, the first few years I went to Jewish schools and when I came back, I\nwas \u2014 there was one more boy that was Jewish in the class. When I went to the higher\nschools, there was another girl. I went to an all girls\u2019 school then from sixth grade \u2018til I\ngraduated. And there were two Jews in the class: me and another girl.",
        "A: No, I never even thought \u2014 it\u2019s just that I knew her and I knew her family, that I know she\nwas Jewish. But no, I never felt anything different between being Jewish and not Jewish.",
        "A: How I remember that, we couldn\u2019t get chocolate. Because I knew my father would buy\nthings that nobody could get, so he would like buy \u2014 you know, it was rationing, and he\nwould get it for us. But it was not a hard life. We went to school and just classes \u2014 I know\npeople didn\u2019t have as many cars as we do now. I would go by bicycle to school always, like\neverybody else.",
        "A: No, not really. Except that I love the Danes and I think the best part that happened to me, is\nthat I\u2019m Danish. I\u2019ve always been \u2014 I feel very fortunate to be born there and I love the\ncountry. What they did for the Jews, the way they \u2014 later on I realized what other countries\nhad done to their people, and I realized that it was not that the Germans were better in\nDenmark, it was because the Danes were better. So, I think that should be known always,\nnever forgotten. Alright?",
