        "A: Okay. Now we're on tape. Would you tell me your name please?",
        "Q: My name is Max Haber. I was born on the 31st of December, 1904, in Essen on the Ruhr\n[River], Germany.",
        "A: Tell me about your childhood as you were growing up.",
        "Q: My childhood up to the First World War, which started when I was 9 years old, was a nice\none, a happy one. In fact, my father took us and my uncle to visit our grandparents in\nKolomier. In other words, 1n those 5 weeks that I was there, I met my grandparents and I still\nremember when we went back to Germany, he asked me, \"What is your name?\" I said,\n\"Max. Max.\u201d He said, \"No.\u201d He said, \"Moshe.\u201d Uh...then he said, this what I wanted to\nknow from you. When you go to Germany, I'd like to stay a good Jew. And I think my father\ndid everything and myself to follow his advice. After then during the war time, we were very\nhungry. We did have very little to eat. There was a blockade against Germany. My father\nwas in the army, and my brother was taken a little bit later into the army. But they came back\nin 1918, 19 and life was normal. I learned my trade. Was an ____ export refinery for non-\nferrous metals. We had different....we had different...uh...uh... departments and I chose to be\nin the metal department. By the way this trade I continued here when I came to Chicago.",
        "Q: Max. Excuse me. Tell me about...before we go on, being a Jew, being raised as a Jew.\nUh...What kind of school did you go to?",
        "A: The school I attended was an orthodox school, real orthodox school, __\u2014. Our teachers\nwere good Germans, but they were good Jews too. We were very knowledgeable. The\nteacher that taught us math or geography was at the same time teacher __. After finishing\n5th school, it was not very hard to get a position as a apprentice. So you had to work 3 years\nwith a little pay in order to become a businessman. Interestingly as you asked me these\nquestions, something comes to mind. At the Christmas time, after I was | and a half years\nemployed, I was called...little bit over | and a half years, I was called to the personnel office\nand I was told...up to now they called you Haber, Haber. From now on your name will be\nHerr Haber. We let you... consider you that you finish your apprenticeship, but under the\nconditions that you stay with us the full 3 years, but your salary will be as of a full-\nfledged...uh...uh...employee. This reminds me about how Germany has changed. He was not\nJewish. He was very friendly. He was knowing that I was Jewish because I did not work on\nSaturday. I came Sundays. Sunday morning half a day, and Saturday I had off. Well, after a\ncertain years being offering them a buyer...",
        "Q: In what city?",
        "A: In Homburg. Everything is Homburg. Everything is Homburg because as...uh...when I was\nstill a baby, we moved from Essen on the Ruhr to Homburg. In...uh...I became a\nbusinessman and was even for myself in business until I had to give it up when Hitler came\nto power. And end of 1933, my father having passed away and buried now in Homburg, I\nremained with my mother because my brother and my sister lived already in the East.\nMy...my sister married and my brother had to...in order to be...to be a doctor, practicing\ndoctor, had to go there where he was born. He was...when he was born, it was Austria, as I\nmentioned before, but it became after the first world...world war, Polish territory. In 1933, I\ntried to go to the United States. I had relatives there, an uncle, brother of my mother, and\ncousins. It was...I did not get an answer so that means I could not get any papers and go\nhere...go to the United States. So I decided in Germany I cannot stay and I went to Poland\nbecause my brother and sister lived there and they said there are three and a million Jews\nlive. You can live too. When I came to Kolomier where my sister lived, was a city not far\naway from Rumania border, and there I could make a living because I needed a territory\nwhere there was industry. So I figured it out and I went to Katowice. For two reasons. First\nof all, there was the so-called Polish industry, and the other one was that I did not speak\nPolish and I could help myself with a lot of German and a little Polish. And I even went to an\nevening school to know a little bit more of the language. I made a living, but in 39 we heard,\nin May 39, that there will come probably a war between Germany and Poland. So I decided\nto get out of Poland. But, as I mentioned, before you couldn't go anywhere. I met a young\nman on the street and I told him we had to talk. And I told him I think we get...have to get\nout from here, somewhere. So he just said..uh...(clearing throat) well, you have a Polish\npassport, you cannot go anywhere. You have the will to go, but nobody lets you in. A few\nweeks later I joined the ___ party on advice of friends and they told me that they will\nhave an illegal transport to Palestine some day in August. I jotned them, paid in, and we\nwent in this transport to the Rumanian border. In order to be told we cannot get\nfarther...farther, at that time the English Ambassador to Rumania told the Rumanians to\nwithdraw the visa to go through Rumania because they don't want illegal ships to come on\nthe...on the...on the borders of the Arab Palestine.",
        "Q: Tell me about the people on the transport and tell me about...I believe you met Begin.",
        "A: I did not meet Begin because he kept himself incognito. He was afraid because the transport\nwas not...was not legal. I...he was pointed out later to me when we went...got through that\nthis is Begin. This was in August of 1939, and my sister lived in that city. I came back and I\nhad nowhere to go. And when the war broke out I was in Kolomier, the city that my sister\nlived and my mother was there because I left her there because I was going to Palestine. We\nwere very surprised when on the Ist of September the war broke out and nobody came to the\nhelp of the Poles. Neither the English nor the French. We know that 2 days later, they\ndeclared war against Germany, but no help. And we thought, \"Where is Russia?\" Nobody\ncame to help, and as you all...as everybody knows, Poland was overrun by the Germans and\nin 14 days Warsaw was taken. My brother who was at that time in Krakau, and on the way to\nWarsaw because he hoped that there will be the least possibility that the Germans will get it,\nbut then he saw that in...1n 10 days, they were already close to Warsaw they changed their\nroutine and went to the Rumanian border and so we were reunited in Kolomier altogether the\nwhole family once more except my father who was not anymore alive. Thirteen or 14 days\nlater the Russians came in. And I remember so well because they came with tanks, slowly in,\nand every second tank did not function. A few days later we saw trains going day and night\nout of Poland with everything they could get...put their hands on and they were at that time\nmaking the Ribenthrow-Molotov Pact and felt obliged to give them food and assistance to\nkill everything that 1s...uh...capitalist. Soon thereafter you had to stand for bread in line.\nEverything was...you couldn't get. The businessmen were forced to sell everything they had\nfor was declared as null, as...of no value. And when I looked at all these\nthings, I decided I will get out from here whatever. And so my brother-in-law joined me and\nwe went to the border and hoped to help to get to the Rumanian side. Instead, I landed in\nRussian hands because the people that wanted to brings us over there, agents of the Russians.\nI went to several prisons, smaller prisons.",
        "Q: Wait a second. Tell us what happened when you fell into Russian hands. What did that\nmean? How were you handled? What did they say to you?",
        "A: I went to several prisons, smaller prisons, and within 8 or 10 days...I don't remember exactly,\nwe were back in Kolomier in the prison of Kolomier. There I was interrogated twice at\nmidnight. But I made it very simple. I said, \"I am a Jew from Germany and I lived in Poland\nbecause I could not stay anymore in Germany and here in Poland I was not even at home and\nI wanted to go to Palestine. That was, of course, for the Russians already a prison term of 5\nto 10 years because as a Zionist you were already not considered a nice person. Then from\nthere we went to Stanislav...Stanislav, of course, and from there to Limburg __, and there\nmost of the people once more interrogated I was not. I had a clear case. A Zionist! A man\nwho didn't like Russia. We came to...to free them and to make a better life for them and he\nwanted to get away. And according to that, they gave me paragraph 58, which means they\ncannot be anything worse than as a politician...uh...political prisoner. That's what they had in\nthe paragraph 58. From there, we were several months in prison. Of course, the prison was\nnot clean. We got a lot of lice and...uh...the food was not good, but later on this was good\nfood. Then we were taken to Kiev from there. It took us about 10 to 15 days to get there. I\ndon't know exactly the days.",
        "Q: How were you taken and what...",
        "A: In cars, in...1n animal cars. Uh...42 a car. Uh...It was the 18th of March 1940 that we arrived\nin Kiev. Uh...There we were taken into an office and we thought of course, it would be right\nto take the hat off, and he told us in Russian, \"This is not a church. You can have the hat on.\u201d\nHe had his on. But we slept on the floor, on a stone floor and they didn't give us anything to\neat until we went into a cell. That was about 24 hours later. There they started to get...not to\ninterrogate us and that...this...this room was made for eight people and we were 40. The few\nstrong people slept on the bed. The other slept on the floor. When we came, there was a\nRussian man in there, and they took him pretty soon out because a big part of the people\nwere Jews that fled Poland from the other side where the Germans came and they took them\nprison...as prisoner anyhow if they didn't do anything either. Then 2 days later there was an\nother man with us who was Jewish. His name was Mesha. He was very friendly and we...he\nsaid...we asked him what are you here doing...doing here. He said, \"I am a leather cutter and\nI stole a little bit of leather. He gave me 2 years.\u201d But he used to get packages. He used to be\nvery friendly, and he heard what we talked and up to the time when Paris fell to the Germans\nthat means somewhere in June or July...don't know exactly, we didn't know that people that\nare interrogators take nights out and I was not, as I told you before, I had a clear case what I\nam. A Zionist! They told me there were a lot of papers in different languages. He was very\nfriendly...gave him cigarettes. ___ in German. And...uh...looked to...looked to it that they\nshould see that Paris was taken by the Germans. So he told them, \"You see. Now the\ncapitalist are gone. Now we will fight the fascist. That 1s our purpose.\u201d So he came back to\nthe cells and I...I.... heard from anybody of them...from all of them the same...the same news.\nAnd in August 1940 they took us all down in the former church of the Kiev prison and told\nus we will judge...be judged now and get the sentence. I was called and there were three men\nsitting there, not dressed very nicely. , proud of it and said in Russian language. May I say it\nin language which I talk you know? ___ CCS. That meen,\n\"The judges of three gave you 5 years.\u201d When I asked _____ for what? The answer was\n.. \"You will find out.\u2019___ \u201cYou will go into a camp and then you don't\nwithstand it, you just die like an animal. We got double rations and prepared for the transport\nto the camp. Uh...Somewhere beginning of September we were taken out and went to a place\nnot far away from...from Kiev farther north I imagine. It was north. And there we were\nprepared to be shipped to different kind of places. Chernigov was the name of that place\nand...uh...there was a woman doctor, a Jewish woman doctor and I told her that I suffer\nfrom...uh...ulcers. \"Oh,\" she said, \"Everybody has here something and nobody wants to go to\nwork.\u201d And that was it. But 2 or 3 days later, a transport went and two or three of us stayed.\nWas not sent out. Was not for the better. Was not for the worst. We were retransported to\nKiev. And there we went into that big church that was not any more a church in the prison,\nand we were among real, real thieves, murderers...6, 7 of us. There it happened to become\nRosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. How did we know it? By the moon. Jews have the\nmoon calendar. We were knowing when it was full moon and so on and so on and so on. But\nwe had...we were not 10 people, and we were in one corner. All of a sudden that afternoon,\nthe day before Rosh Hashanah, they threw us in three young men like...looking like Hasidim\nwith the beard, with Patots, and they came from the ditches, and they were originally from\nGalicia, taken prisoners and were kept in the ditches but were now prepared to go with the\ntransport probably with us a new transport into concentration camp. The man that was on the\ntable who was directing everybody, the main man, the chief of the criminals, wanted to know\nwho they are. They considered them like angels. He never saw people like that and he\nwanted to know from us and we told them we have a holiday and they were sent to us and so\nthey made peace with us and did not touch us, did not bother us for 2 days...the criminals.\nBut before that they took...when I had...uh...handkerchief or whatever I had, they took\neverything from us because they had nothing and everything was dealt with like on the black\nmarket. You exchanged tobacco for this or that. Between Rosh Hashanah Yom Kippur, we\nare put in a train. The train was not...uh...a car..uh...animal car, but it had grates and it was\nsimilar to the first class of prewar Germany. Hard seats and outside was both sides soldier\nwith a gun, and we were transported through Russian Europe. To show it is nor so bad, we\nwere in a train like humanbeings. But as soon as we atrived...as we reached the ___, we\nwere put again in those wonderful trains and it took us several weeks. On the transport there,\nthere was a day when we didn't get...more than a day when we didn't get nothing to eat. The\nfood was handed out every morning to the leader of that car...car...of that...uh...of\nthat...uh...animal car. And he was a Pole...he was...uh... uh...a criminal. They never put a\npolitician in charge. He had a dirty handkerchief which he used for everything and in that\nthey gave him this little bit of sugar. 40 people got so and so much sugar, and it was\nmeasured in a...in a little...uh...match box. A little match box was measured out to\neverybody. And then we got the bread. The bread was good at that time. When you were\nhungry, you could eat it, and it was 5 or 6 hundred grams. Little bit more than a pound of\nbread. We arrived in Yetsevel. It was called Yetsevel. That was originally a point where the\nfirst prisoners came. It was only a forest. They got...all they got was a saw and a hammer,\nwhatever, to build there a station. They lived in...under 30 degrees...they lived in...in tents\nuntil it was built. And that was the place that the Germans used to call the umschlagplatz,\nwhich is the same thing. And there we were gathered together. And when we arrived...of\ncourse, hungry, exhausted, with lice, first met a Jewish fellow and he was in charge of the\nsauerkraut...of the sauerkraut...uh...basins. There were big basins and that was...this...this\nplace has mostly cabbage. And so they made that as a diet for prisoners. The bread, the\ncabbage, and the...and the cabbage soup day in and day out. But we didn't stay very long\nthere. He told us it's very bad here and he... uh...managed to see already a month here but\nthen they sent you away it's so bad there and somebody come back he...he cannot tell us\nanything good. So the next morning, we went out...1t was about...was not more than Il or 12\nkilometers from there and we went on the railroad siding because there was no street. There\nwas no other way but by the railroad went once a day or went every two days, to and back on\nthe same...same...uh...same...uh...same...same thing. When we arrived in that....that camp, by\nthe name of Meuselwitz. In my opinion there were there not less than 3 or 4 thousand\nprisoners. There were already Polish prisoners there or Jewish prisoners there and first when\nwe came we were put in a barrack or call it...uh...to... to...where...where you...where you live\nand where you sleep, and that was like made out of a few boards and the wind was blowing\nin. In the middle was a big furnace, iron furnace and the prisoners came home wet from work\nand everybody and I...I...around the oven warmed himself and dried his clothes. Otherwise, it\nwas cold all...all over and the only light that was there was about in a big, big place, a little\nabout maybe... The next day we had to go to work. How do we get the soup? You don't get\nanything in Russia. Don't get the fork. Don't get the spoon. You have to see that you get it,\nthat you make it yourself. So there were prisons who said I will first go and then you...give it\nto you when it's empty and you go. But you have to be 1n time outside to go to work. They\nmade spoons out of wood and the can that was an empty American can...uh...meat was\neventually in...packed in, and that was made to...uh...to a can where you received your...your\nsoup. Standing in line, you got your soup and we went out early at 6 o'clock in the morning\nand music was playing...prisoners. And they played. When they saw there was a lot of Jews,\nthey played Jewish songs. Like ____. When we went out to work, we went over | and a\nhalf hours til we got there where I work was. And what was the work? To cut trees. Not with\nelectric cuts, but two men with a saw and others had to transport it and so on and so on. I was\nnot able to do that work and I was when I came back I did a little something in order not to\ngo to prison...in prison and I got...uh...300 grams of bread. Others got 700 because they\nworked good. But it showed after them that after 2 years of that kind of work that I was\nbetter off than the others because they got more bread, but they died too from the hard work,\nand I somehow survived. I became so thin. I lost a lot of weight. You could see all my ribs.\nIn June of 1900...0f 1941 when the Germans attacked Russia, we heard it in the camp on\nloud speaker and the...uh...all the foreigners were told they're going to freedom if they are\nPolish citizens because of the attack on...on...on...on Russia. I was not called. Most of them\nwere called, and every day so and so many disappeared to so-called freedom. Three months\nlater, I was called. Was one of those cases that they didn't know what to do with. I was\ncaught...taken on Polish territory, had relatives that were Polish...Polish citizens and I, on the\nother hand, was German born. So I was sent back and was...that was the most terrible time in\nmy life. I was beaten up by other prisoners because they thought I was too...too happy to\ngo...to go away but I was still one of them. These prisoners were...had the same faces like\n____ today and Armenian but were there and accused Jews that because of us they are here.\nThe Jews are the leaders of communism and as I am a Jew, they beat me up. When I see\ntoday on television those faces, these were the people they did it to me. In the camp the man\nthat cut the bread was sentenced in 37 to 10 years because he was ___. There was a time\nwhen Stalin cleaned out and then he found somebody _____ and got 10 years. I got only 5\nyears. The doctor was a ____, and the other doctor was a_. And when there came Yom\nKippur I went to the doctor and I told him I cannot go to work. That was the first Yom\nKippur I...the first Yom Kippur I was in the train. The second one I had to go to work, but I\ndid not work, but when I came back I got 10 days prison in prison for not working. So I\nspent 10 days with young boys age 10 to 14 or 16 who played cards on my rags that I had\nthere and they made me sleep at the latrine. I had to take it out, and I got my bread...instead\nof picking it up I got it 3 hours later and the soup cold. In day time I went to work and when\nI came back from work this was a 10-days prison in prison. The...uh...second Yom Kippur I\ndid not work because I complained again and this doctor shouted at me. His name was Ilia\nSelimonowitz. I don't have the family name. And he said you don't want to work and that's it,\nand you will go to work, that's it, and get out. The next day the marchik is the...that is a man\nwho drives you to work, that sees to it that nobody stays inside. It's usually a criminal and\nmany years of experience there and if necessary, he beats you up, then...then you have\nenough. You will remember next time not to hide. He...uh...called out my name that I am not\ngoing because I'm sick. So this whole scene was made by the doctor in order not to be under\nsuspicion that he is on a high holiday...on a high holiday, Jewish high holiday freeing\nprisoners not to work. The third Yom Kippur...I came before that already an invalid\nbecause I was weighing....I did not know my weight, but I was so thin and so weak that they\ncould not push me to work. So the doctors, Polish doctor declared me an invalid of _._That\nmeans I have the right to sleep on the bunker. I get a piece of the bread and the soup and I\ndon't have to go to work. So that Yom Kippur I did not go to work because I didn't have to. I\nmention that because it was...at that time when I started to give a account, I had a home. I\nhad a family. I had a mother, a brother, a sister, relatives. And all probably looked where I\nam, hungry and almost dying. My body was going. It was my soul. My knowledge of my\nreligion, my education from Homburg that made me think I will survive, gave me hope. I\nused to cover myself and forget where I am and dreaming that today is holiday. The fourth\nYom Kippur I was in a camp because Russia lost a lot of people at Stalingrad and in the war\nat all, and they started to empty out prisons...prison camps, especially those people that could\nnot work. And they want them out maybe to replace the men that were killed. So I was sent\nto a camp. There I was told I cannot go out. He looked at me and he said in Russian\nlanguage,\"___\u2014\u2014.\u201d\u201d He is such a bird. They don't know what to do with.\u201d There is such an\nexpression in Russian, __. Such a bird! So I was sent back and a few days later I was\ncalled to the gate and I was told to go take my few things, less than I brought here today.\nAnd there was a horse and wagon waiting and a woman was sitting on it. She's going to have\na child. And I...and the...the man with the gun, __, went with us to go to another camp.\nCould see it from far away. It was a workers' camp. In contrast to this camp which was an\nassembly place for those they took eventually go out. I couldn't walk that far so I told him I\ncannot. I was sitting down in the snow. I cannot. So he told the woman to go up...down, and\nput me up because the horse could not pull that much. Such a horse wasn't fat either. We\nfinally arrived after | and a half hours there and there I was taken to the office and in the\noffice there was sitting a woman that...uh...told me, \"Grandpa.\u201d And I looked at her because I\nhad a beard and I walked with a cane which I bought for a piece of bread...that somebody\nmade out of wood. And she said, \"Take a look.\u201d I said, \"I'm not a grandpa. I'm 39 years old,\nand I...\u201d And she said, \"Take a look at the mirror.\u201d And it was the first time in many years\nthat I saw a mirror and I didn't recognize myself. Being friendly to me...she was a ___, she\nwas a prisoner too. She told me...uh...I told her, \"I'm hungry. I didn't get anything to eat from\nthe morning til now. It's afternoon.\u201d She said, \"I cannot give you anything I don't have.\u201d And\nit was Christmastime, and nobody was there of the high ranking. And she said, \"Evenings\nwhen they give everybody to eat again.\u201d So I had to wait. And I got the piece of bread and I\nwent..before that I went to the ___, so called hospital of the camp and told the doctor I\nhardly can walk. I'm hungry. And he looked at me and he never saw somebody with the ribs\nout like this and he put me on the scale and I weigh...weighed 40 kilo, which you know is 88\npounds. It was the first time in 4 years I found out how much I weigh. So he put me in the so\ncalled sick... sick...uh...place, and there I got twice a day soup. The bread was\nbrought...brought to me, and one spoonful of oil. What kind of oil I don't know. After 14\ndays...it's the most time a man can be there, I didn't gain because he weighed me again. I\ndidn't weigh...weigh...uh...gain any weight, but he told me he has to sign me out. And I was\nsigned out. I was put in a barrack and the people there...working people. They went out. And\nwhen they saw somebody weak, never from the outside where you're beaten. They didn't\ntouch you. When you stood before them, you had to have your hands in the back and that\nwas it. Never! Never! Never! They told you only in nasty words but otherwise you were not\nbeaten. The prisoners were among themselves because so many nationalities which hated\nthemselves and they were altogether there in those camps. Uh...One tried to take away this\nlike can that I had where I got my...my...my soup. The other one saw my...my jacket which\nwas rags was better than his, and he wanted me to exchange. But lucky enough towards\nevening...quite a bit of people came back from work and among them boys from Vienna.\nJewish boys from Vienna. Oh, I said...and I am bad on Germans and working there. This is a\nworking camp and I will not go free. And that was very sad. But they had flour because they\nworked unloading flour and they brought flour with them. And they took water and flour and\nmade it because our soup was watery. The spoon did not stand, but there the spoon stood.\nAnd they gave me as much as I wanted of flour and water and with a spoon to eat. And I told\nthem about what the others do to me and they went over and told them, \"You are talking here\nto soldiers. You will get it.\u201d And they let me go. Let me go. They called me uncle. Was 20.\n21 years boys that were expelled from Vienna. Children of...probably of parents that once\nwere from Galicia and lived in Vienna and the children are born there and they were\nprisoners there. What happens to them I don't know. Anyhow, after a short while I was\ncalled back to the other camp. When I came to the other camp it was empty. Only a few\npeople from...uh...which you see now on television from this..from those Republic that wants\nto be by themselves. They...we had there to sleep. The food was not good. Again a piece of\nbread and that soup. So I had no other way. I lived everyday in and out, but I didn't go to\nwork. It was in February. It was Christmastime. It was in February. We didn't have the\ncalendar. I cannot tell you exactly the date and it was very hard winter, of course there 40\nbelow. And...uh...but one nice day, that is a nice day in 44, in March 44, I went somewhere. I\nwent to the man of the kitchen, in charge and he was from White Russian, a Polish citizen\nfrom White Russia and he wanted to learn how to speak German. So he will give me a little\nbit of bread and soup. So I spent my time with him. As soon as he didn't cook I spent my\ntime with him. When I came back to the barrack, \"Where are you? Where have you been?\"\nThe _ looked for you. I said to him, \"I'm free to go. I don't have to go...be where...I'm in the\ncamp. I was in the camp.\u201d The _____ came back, called my name. Always that same way,\n\"Maxim S\u2014C.\"\" Max, the son of Solomon. _ You go to freedom. I didn't believe it\nbecause I was once sent there before. He said, \"You are the bird.\u201d And he didn't let me out.\nThat was in March of 1944. In other words, I was 4...and 4...and 4 years and 5 months about\nin prison. He told me I have to go and get a shave, a haircut, and a so-called bath. That\nmeans a little bit of water with...with almost no soap and the second one to put...to put over\nme, to clean me up from the soap. They gave me a different jacket than I had on. It had no\nholes and it was very good. It suited me so that the next 2 years at my house as everything\nwhere I slept on there, where I kept my bread, where I kept everything. The next\nmorning...and I must tell you according...1t was the 27th of March...of April...of April. I'm\nhere...I'm here wrong. On the 27th of April, Yom Ha-Shoah falls on the same date today\nwhen I was liberated and I was knowing it that it was the 27th day of Mishnah, because of\nthe moon again. I went to freedom. How? The __, elderly Russians...among them one\nJew, a lawyer from Leningrad who got 10 years as a Troskiers, and he was have to serve...he\nserved for 47, but they let him out because of sickness in 44. Like several others. We went to\nthe station. They gave us a loaf of bread, but we considered that it's too weighing too much.\nWe cut off one piece for the two days trips. And a herring...not a herring that you buy.\nThere's everything in. There's nothing taken out, but you like it you ate everything. Ate even\nthe bones you chewed down all the way. One herring and this piece of bread and that was it.\nSo we came to the station quite a bit from the camp. There the window was closed and after\na certain time she opened it up. There was...uh...uh...a station made of wood. Everything is\nwood there. They have nothing else, but wood. And it was, of course, cold. Worse than\noutside because the cold inside is usually worse when it's not heated. And she opened up.\nShe said, \"Children.\u201d In Russian they talked that way. \"The Biata...I have no tickets for you\ntoday. The train will come through in half an hour and they have no space on that train. The\ntrain from Blabiwostick to go...went through there and we were going\nCity of Kotanich. That is the city where the Czar used to send all people that didn't behave\nlike politically sent there, and there everything was encumbered there. There were more\nencumbered there than free people. There we were sent. The next day we complained it is\ncold. What shall we do? She said, \"I have a saw. I have everything. Go to the forest. It's not\nfar...far from here. Get some wood and heat it. I will be glad to.\u201d I said, \"Are you kidding?\nWhen we take the wood from today, it will take months to dry to be able to make fire with it.\nYou want us to make for you wood. We'll let you have it later. So all of us went up...up\nthere. There was a gallery and one next to the other warmed himself. The food was gone.\nThe bread was gone. The herring was gone. Before we went into the train. Who keeps bread?\nBecause it was immediately stolen by somebody else. When you kept it, he took it away\nfrom you. If you slept for 1 minute there were among them thieves enough, and they took it.\nIt took ...uh...I think 3...no 2 days...2 days, the 27th...29th yal, we came to Kotenish. On the\nway...uh...to...uh...where they told us to go, we met...we met a man with one foot. And he\nwas in...he was in the...in the army and lost his foot. He was shoeless. He ask...he asked us,\n_____. Are you Jewish? ___. The lawyer and I. Then he changed into Yiddish. He didn't\nknow much. First he said, \"Shalom.\u201d He said, \"The lawyer told him he 1s from Leningrad\nand he got 10 years.\u201d He told him a little bit of his story, and his wife and daughter and other\nchildren are here and here but he cannot go now because it's frozen. And he will have to be\nin Kotenish. They wrote him about it until he can make it by boat because he had no horses\nto go on the ice. __, a German Jew. He sent me to a butcher who had goose there in the\nmarketplace. All I had what my papers was that I was come from a concentration camp,\nParagraph 58, that means Russianary...a man who can be a spy, everything the worse that\nexists. And I came to this goose and I told him that a man with one foot who had by the way\nthe Lenin...uh... Medal for bravery sent me to you. And he said to me, \"German Jew? You\nfrom the concentration camp you come out now.\u201d All the Jews came out in 41. He was a\nPolish...but he was not in a concentration ever because he was a communists and he went by\nthat means by free will when the Russians came in he reg...registered he wants to go\nwhere the Messiah 1s. There he had the butcher...the butcher thing there, butcher store. From\nhere he gave to the workers every week or every two weeks a piece of meat that was allowed\nto them because of work. If they worked they got...except Vodka, a piece of bread. And he\nsaid, \"The German Jews were not nice to us.\u201d I said, \"It is true I was born in Germany, but\nmy parents were not born and to prove to you I speak fluently Yiddish.\" Start talking\nYiddish and he thought it over and he looked here and there, couldn't make his heart giving\nin to give me something. But then we looked and as far as three times from here to the door,\nthe other side of the marketplace was a young man looking like a Haludient and he looked\nand he called him because he was knowing him. So he told him...uh...a German Jew, __,\nuh...1s here and he wants...and he wants to...uh...to...uh...make me to help him. He comes\nfrom the concentration camp. So he took out 300 rubles and gave it to him to give it to me.\nWhen he did that he went and bought me...brought me a piece...a little piece of a...of a roll,\nblack roll and some milk. So I told him I cannot use the milk. I haven't had it for several...for\n5 years almost. I'm afraid to drink it. But the bread...so he brought me _____ which is\nboiled water. In Russia, as soon as they came in occupied they put a kettle on the...up in the\nmiddle of the city and constantly burning and to that you have hot water but no sugar. So\n[...I...1 came about early afternoon and I made him, as I talk to you, I think I am capable to\nconvince him that I am not so bad and he should help me. He brought me more bread and he\ntold me, \"I am living with a Russian woman. She has a...they all had their own one room or\ntwo room home, and sometimes a cow. Sometimes! And he even made the remark if she's at\nhome she should burn...and in Yiddish it sounds even different...then I cannot give you\nanything. But if she is not at home I will give you potatoes....uh...fried potatoes. I was lucky.\nShe was not at home.",
        "Q: Excuse me. I want to stop. We're going to change tapes and then we'll pick up from there.",
        "A: Fine. I have to go to the washroom.",
        "A: Okay. How it 1s so far. I have it still a long to talk. It will be more than 2 hours.",
        "Q: That's fine.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: We're back on camera. Now? Okay. Uh...Tell me...the butcher gave you food or did the\nbutcher take you home? Tell me about the butcher.",
        "A: When we talk about the butcher, he had not a butcher's store. It was a booth with an open\nwindow and nights locked. You couldn't go into it. From the street, you showed your\nthat means to prove that you are entitled to so and so much meat. And he gave it to you and\nhe saw to it that he didn't give you everything to you was yours because he needed some for\na black market so that he could exchange it. The...he took me home and he wanted to help\nme. All of a sudden, his Jewish heart came out. He wasn't an educated man, but his Jewish\nheart came out and he said, \"Stop suffering.\u201d I did not know...I thought he...I said, \"You went\nby one of the _____ and they were nice to you. You were a friend. I wasn't considered a\nfriend.\u201d So he went with me to another Jewish place. The man was not married and he lived\nina small __ there. I said, \"All I can do....I cannot sleep here. I can give him bread.\u201d And that\nwas like giving you blood. Because it was rationed. And he gave me a big piece of bread. I\nhad, as I told you before...uh... ___ called and there I put in with the piece of rag a big\npocket. And needles we made ourselves. Got a piece of wire and yarn we got from other\nmaterials and I sewed a big pocket in and there I kept all the things that I hoped I will have\nwhen I...get...don't get anything I will not die from hunger. Of course, I couldn't eat anymore\nbread so I put the bread away. Then he continued...he needed from me where to go to sleep.\nOutside was still 30 below, and it was end of May. So we went to a place. Her name was\nSara. I never was her...know her name. And there was somebody living there by the name of\nShiem, Shier. And her so called husband...don't know, Samuel...I don't know. Don't\nremember. She was...she had two rooms. One was like this window here where we are look\non it, that you could look out and there was a big scale inside a scale...outside the scale and\ninside to read up how much it weighs. The farmers used to bring their product...delivered,\nthat they had to deliver and she rated...and in the other room there slept. And he told her,\n\"Sara, the man has to sleep somewhere. You know I cannot take him to me.\u201d She wouldn't\ngive. But here he is among Jews...you understand, and she said, \"When Shier comes home\nfrom work, she will talk to him. So I waited...he went home in the meantime and left me\nthere...get rid of me, and then the others will take over. So when Shier came home he said,\n\"No. We don't know you. You may have lice.\u201d\u2019 They had the lice. I was deloused. When I\nwent out I was deloused. So they had lice. And he cannot...no...and he gave and he gave me\na piece of bread. It is blood and a drink. And they let me be on the hayloft. There I went up\nand I thought maybe the hay...when I go under the hay I will not...I will be not too cold. It\nwill be not so bad. But after 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes I had to get up. Couldn't stand there. I started\nto exercise, do whatever I could and I was waiting because I went to bed 6 o'clock,\ngot...got...got night there and... uh...in the morning...the nights were short. Came already\ntowards June and there was already sometimes when it had only half a hour night. And I was\nwaiting for the morning to see again the butcher. Shier came up before he went to work and\nhe told me in Yiddish, \"___\u2014_.\u201d\u201d So I told him, \"It's cold and I am almost frozen and so\non and so.\u201d He cried and he gave me 500 rubles. He said for 500 rubles, could buy 2 and a\nhalf loaf of bread on the black market. It 1s not so much, but 2 and a half loaves of bread. I\nwent to the butcher and I told him everything and he went...he brought me a hot soup. Not\ngood, not that soup. It was bitter, bitter flour. I don't know what's tn it...what it...what it was.\nProbably a food that they give to animals but...uh...you cannot die from it. And I\nhad...uh...the hot soup and the bread again and he was...he told me he made an arrangement\nwith a Russian Jew who has chil...children that are...uh...manager of a cohorse. Cohoss is\nlike the kibbutz. When he came and he start to talk to me, I went with him because he started\nfrom Kanaa and he wanted to know this and that. \"Oh,\" he said, \"Yal. Yal. Yal.\u201d And he\nshowed me his wife is standing on the black market and sell things. They were fleeing the\nGermans, and he pretended that they always...that they took the last things with them and he\nsells it day after day so that they can live. But in fact, he was a black marketing. Things she\nbought, got and they lived. So he took me home and I got the first time after 4 and a half\nyears of my life, I got a hot dinner. That means a piece of meat, a soup with beans and..and\nnoodles. But sleeping he couldn't give me. He was tight, and they didn't know who I am from\na concentration camp. Didn't know. And I had a beard and I walked with a cane. I didn't look\nlike I look today. Came back and the man, the butcher went home and he couldn't do\nanything for me so I went to the railroad station. Because the railroad station you wait for a\ntrain and there 1s an oven. So I went there to sit down and warm myself until the next night\ngoes through and then I had an appointment with a Ukrainian manager where the children\nsaid he should get in touch with me to go to the cohoss. There IJ had...there had a hat... had\nto sleep and where to live. I was sitting there and fell asleep at the oven, at the belly oven\nbecause I didn't sleep the night before and I was always on my feet. I wonder today how I\ndid it. And I was awake by...uh...by...uh... . And he said, \"What are you doing here? Where is\nyour papers?\" Papers mean that everybody that was over those years had to have a passport.\nSo I had to have something to show who I am and why I am in this city. If I'm allowed in this\ncity or in this village. You couldn't go from one city to one village without permission of the\n_____. When he looked it...oh, he said, Paragraph 58, come on with me. And he took me to\nhigher...like you see him today on television was a nicer camp. You know, you see them\ntoday. And he told me...he told me..uh...what are you doing here. Where.... I said, and I told\nhim about that...what I told right now. I said I was released from a concentration camp and I\nhave nowhere to be and I'm frozen. Why it was much better in the camp. I got a little bit of\nsoup and a piece of bread, but there I couldn't lay down. It's worse than freedom in here. He\nsaid...and I showed him...I said I have to work. I said where should I work? If I cannot work\nin the camp and I showed him I was only bones. Think he...he cried or anything? He told,\n\"Get out of here. This time I let you out. Otherwise, we give you another 10 years. Get out of\nhere. When I find you once more, then you go back to a...to a camp.\u201d So I was afraid to go\nback and I spent the rest of the night up and down on the street. Snow! Winter! Siberia! The\nnext day I hardly could wait for the butcher again. There was my place where I met my\nfuture helper. And the Ukrainian manager came. He was quite nice. Ukrainians were not so\nnice to Jews, but he was at that time quite nice to me. He said, \"Can you teach me German?\"\nI said, \"Yes.\u201d \"So come on to...with me to our cohoss and I will see to it that you have\nsomething to eat.\u201d And he took from the newspaper a little piece of paper because they have\nno paper there...from a newspaper and wrote down to the kibbutz manager there, a woman,\nto give me 4 or 5 potatoes...I don't remember the details, 4 or 5 potatoes and a bowl of\nsauerkraut. So I waited because I will go with several other people, with their girl who had\nbeen to the marketplace, brought there something from the village to take home, salt,__,\nand he told that one girl, \"See to it that he goes there and there...there to this village,\"\nbecause she lived not far away. She didn't know if I was Jewish. She didn't know who I was.\nShe saw that I'm a grandpa. Good looking, strong, not educated girl. And she helped me to\ncarry that little wooden case where I had nothing in. I...1...1 threw it away after that. (clearing\nthroat) And when I came they were all sleeping because it took us a long time. They were\nall sleeping. She woke up. I gave her this little ticket. She gave me the potatoes. She gave the\nsauerkraut and in the farm house always benches along in Russia, where they sleep. They\nsleep on the oven and all on the benches all high up because the heat goes up. So I laid down\nand I couldn't... couldn't get up anymore. I couldn't get up anymore because in walking so\nfar, I had pains here, my bones. I think close to the...to the first of May. I made there a\nmistake. It was the first of May...1t was the end of April and not May. I have got to correct\nthat. I was...was right originally that it is...uh...it is the 27th of April and...uh...not May.\nUh...uh...I got...they were sitting down that day over meat, bread, soup and I didn't get\nanything. Uh...She told me in Russian, she told me ___\u2014S\u2014S\u2014\u2014\u201c \"Whoever does not work\ndoes not get.\u201d She had red hair and all the people that worked in that cohoss came to that\nparty and she had I think 3 or 4 or 5 children from different men. There was one...I think he\nwas 16 years old. Red hair like his mother, and he didn't like it what she talked to me. And\nhe took something from the table when she went away for a minute and gave it to me and\nsaid, \"Cover yourself and eat.\u201d And that was it. The next day I was waiting for the man, the\nmanager of the cohoss, Ukrainian. That day I got so much soup, so much bread. Course\nmeals, but so much but after then I was afraid I will fall sick. Everything was bloated, not\nused anymore to such food because it was all chunked together. For the first next few days, I\ndid not work. I taught him German. And he gave me a piece of sausage which was not good\nfor me because it was fat. I couldn't...I wasn't used to anything...any that, and...uh...I...1...1\nmight...may make a joke. | lived all the way...all the time kosher. We never got any meat. All\nwe got was a cabbage and a piece of bread and sometimes a a head of a fish. A head of fish\nor a herring. And I didn't want it. For two reasons! I was afraid I cannot digest it and on the\nother hand, I break...I break dietary laws. I thought to myself. Then I\nbecame...uh...uh...watching the field evenings, nights...uh...as a watchman that nobody takes\nout the newly put in potatoes or whatever. Of course, it was cold and all night and it was that\nreason...for that you got a piece of bread, like in the camp and the soup and...uh...and every\ntwo weeks a bottle of vodka, a liter of vodka. I didn't stay very long there because I couldn't.\nIt was too cold outside. So he transferred me to the hospital for the...to the state hospital of\nthat city for the people that were not quite healthy and there were quite a bit of German\nsoldiers there that ____ and they talked freely. Hitler will win and all that because they were\nnot normal. And there I couldn't stay very long because there was a night service and they\nwanted me to clean up there what they did on the floor and all that, and they had no soap\neither. So I didn't stay very long, but the doctor in charge over there, the Russian woman,\nsaw that I...uh...must be...some...somewhere...some...she wanted to know more about me.\nAnd...uh...she gave me cigarettes but she could not help me. I had to go back to work.\nEverybody has to work and I had to go to the field again. There I fell asleep and I had some\npotatoes already prepared to take home and somebody that checked on me told them about\nme. That would be 5 or 10 years again for doing that. She got me out of it...got me out it, and\nI left that hospital. And I did not work. I went on the black market again. But there was a\nbookkeeper that gave me at that time what I had to come for that work and she was a Jewish\nwoman from Kiev. Her husband was...uh...State Attorney in Kiev and he was sentenced for\n10 years by Stalin as not reliable. And she had a daughter living with her 8 or 9 years and\nnever heard from her husband again. We became friendly. I visited her. So what I got more\nfrom her was an onion or a garlic and a little bit more bread and we had talks. In the\nmeantime, I had company with that Mr. Becker who became after then the conservative\nrabbi of Memphis that gave me the...the money...that gave me the money. I met him at\nservices. He made a Minyan in 1944 in September at Sara's place because she had an extra\nroom. Now he prayed the Musaf service and I pray...I prayed the Shofer service. And at that\nplace we were four people, all foreign Jews but one. It was a Russian Jews. He was...name\nwas Matowich. He was in his high 70s. He fled Ukraine, and he had a prayer book. Didn't\ntake anything this prayer book, the Moosberg. And from that we prayed and all the other\nsaid, yes...yes...harman or. When he heard me pray...Becker, he decided he wants to be more\nfriendly to me, wants to know about me. He was afraid of anybody because he\nwas...uh...every 3 months checked if he can go to the front line again because he came from\nRovno which not far away from Limburg and there they took him into the army and they\nretreated and you know where he __ in 14 days the Germans were before Moscow. And all\nof those people there that army, they're taken to camps. Not concentration camps, but not\ntransports. And every 3 months he was checked for his health and he played the crazy one.\nSo he could not tell me and he didn't have the con...I could be linked up with their men. He\ndid not know. But then he got confidence in me. He told me that has _____ from the Yeshiva\nin ___, and he was writing for The Moment in Warsaw and was a friend of Begin. Begin was\nretired the Youth Movment, and he wrote for The Moment __ articles. Now, he doesn't\nknow about his family anymore and that was it. He is here. He became so friendly I told,\n\"Why do you read the Russian paper. Learn English. One nice day we will be in Western\nEurope, the Western Hemisphere, and English will be it and not Russia.\u201d So the girl where I\nlived had a book, an English book, was a first 2 years used. And we talked. I forgot to tell\nyou that a man...man by the name of Smiger, a photographer, helped me more than anybody\nelse. The butcher told me, \"Go to Smiger. Tell him who you are. I told him already that you\nare here.\u201d And he gave me, of course, something to eat. Bread and butter, and some\nfruit...fruit, had some fruit. He had...he was a photographer because, as I'd mentioned before,\nanybody after the age of 12 has to have a passport. So he was making these pictures for\npassports and had to give him for 5 rubles. But then...when you wanted more pictures, you\nhad to give 50 or a hundred rubles and there where he has the money. Here he got money for\nmore pictures or he got a piece of chicken or a piece of ___, or a piece of bread. I helped\nSmiger developing the pictures. So he set me up with an elderly woman that was on the\nblack market and she had a room...an apartment...a room, and there I slept on the floor. It\nwas summertime so it was not so bad. Then came, as I mentioned before, Rosh Hashanah\nand we prayed there and the next year...the whole year, there was a war over in May, but we\ndid not know anything what to do and when we will be repatriated. So one nice day, Becker,\nwho was not...not ____...he was from the Army. He was _____.. They were all, as we say,\n________. They could...he said to...to Sara...she was...she was in addition, she was a\ndressmaker, and she made all the dresses for the ___ women. So he told her, I got the\npuputska. That means the so-called passport to go home to Rovno to see where my parents\nare. But there is room. - which will never get out of here. Can you see that the man there...we\nare a friend...write your name. There's room for both of us that we go on the same trip with\nher. She listened. The next day we came and she said, \"You did me a very bad service. They\nwanted almost to kill me. To take someone with paragaraph 58 they had you...his papers,\nyour papers there and...uh...want to smuggle him out from here?\" So that was it. That was\nOctober 1945. And we said goodbye, but we made out he's going over Moscow and in case\nhe can find out if I go, then he will let me...with one word, give me a cable,___\u2014_. That\nmeans okay. And that will mean that I go. Uh...He asked him...that was Gomulka. You heard\nabout Gomulka? He was after then the main chief in the new government. He was the\nSecretary. He was in Moscow waiting for the...for the creation of the new Polish Posusky\narmy against the London army _____ army.

And\nwhen...when...when Becker said to me, \"Come on with me. What do you have to lose?\" I\nsaid, \"Aw, what shall I sit down there.\u201d He said, \"You know piece of choc you get and a\npiece of sugar.\u201d So I went. I went with him two or three times. And you had to fill out your\nname like he told me, \"Here sign.\u201d And I signed my name. So when he asked Becker in\nMoscow...Gomulko asked him, \"What did he do for Poland? Who is he?\" So he gave him\nthe name and do you know they had the register of everybody who came to the meetings.\nWhen he saw that I came three times, two or three times to the meeting he said to him, \"He\nwill go.\u201d And I got the letter ____. I was very happy.",
        "Q: Explain what that means?",
        "A: That means...not everybody was repatriated. I was sent not as a Pole. I was sent as a German.\nThen to them I was a German. And only Polish people were repatriated. So...but we\nexplained to him that my parents were born in Poland and I am not a German. I am a Jew.\nAnd when he saw that I was to these meetings, he said, \"He will go. I put him on the list.\"",
        "Q: Gomulka himself?",
        "A: Gomulka himself but him on the list. That what he told me that he will say I wasn't there.\nThat was somewhere November of 45. I went on with my life. Black market. I lived with\nSmiger.

And she said she knows only from her youth time that\nin Kotenich was a doctor and the pharmacist were Jewish, sent by the Czar because of not\nbehaving. But otherwise she knows only from the holy writings that we killed Jesus. But\nthese are Jews? She doesn't want us to go. She wants us to say. For me, she had her sister.\nWell, we listened. What should we say? It was very nice. He went and he went over Moscow\nand he went to Rovno. There was nothing left. Everything burned and as you know from the\nhistory, there was everywhere Judenrein.",

They should prepare themselves that 1n...uh ...uh...April or\nMay, when it gets warmer, we will go. It's the last transport because the big transport went\nalready and during these strong winter months, they stopped it because they wouldn't survive\nunder the circumstances and it took too long and I called up one day again, and she told me,\n\"Good, go up to the ___ and tell him for next week to have a car, you know, animal car for\nyou to come to Keof to join in that transport. When I came home with the goods that she\ngave me...and somebody helped me to carry it. I couldn't carry it. At the station Koternish,\nthe _______ was there. And it was already dark, and they lit up there things there and to see\nwho I am. They see so much goods in private hands. They took me to the police and there\nthey kept me from 6 or 7 o'clock til 12 o'clock night and there were a lot of people there they\ngot from the street and they started to open up and everybody wanted to take something. I\nwarned them this is this and this, for those and those people and I'm not responsible. When I\ngave the address of the office, the office had no telephone. The office was closed, and then\nthey sent a man on a bicycle to her apartment. And she confirmed that this is from her and I\ngot two policemen that brought me home where I lived and I distributed all those things the\nnext day. I who talked the worse Prussian was made as a leader of 30 or 40 people...I don't\nremember. When I came to the ______, to tell him I need the car, and to stamp the ___, they\ntold me, \"The car will be there.\u201d\u2019 But it wasn't. So I called her and complained and afternoon\nthere was...1t was there. And we went away. Of course, a few friends that I made cried,\nespecially the bookkeeper that was in charge there of the hospital. She came out to see me\noff. Uh...Her brother...the landlady's brother there where Smiger and I lived...uh...told me\nthat...uh...why I don't stay? They will me a...uh...home and his daughter is not married. She\nwas a teacher and a sergeant in the army. Very good looking and healthy, you know. And I\ndid not know that she took an eye on me because she passed there. I...I did live in the room\nand she passed there and saw me. But during that time, there was a law given out that\nanybody that is...that care...has a right to be repatriated when he is married from wherever\nshe comes, she can go with. So there was a young lady. I can say really a lady. Her husband\nwas the transport minister in Estonia. And her father was a banker. And they were taken the\nfirst day when the Russians came in and they never saw them again, and her mother and\nherself and several children, they sent to Kotenish. When she heard that I speak\nGerman...you know, these Lithuanian, Estonia, and Latvia, there...uh...the language was\nGerman. And she made my acquaintance and she told me that she has a lot of money in\nbanks in Western Europe. If I take her out and get married to her, either we stay married if I\nwant; otherwise...but she will help me with a lot in business as a businessman. So, of course,\nI denied it. I didn't want to go into ____ perform a marriage. But was I myself considered\nmyself very..very weakly patriation man.. I was always a question...question mark if I go\nback not to connect myself with another dark person. I can endanger and I don't come out\nagain. So I told her I cannot do it. Finally, when we came to Keof, very happy I have my\npaper with me, and I have some rubles from the black market and I went to buy some\ncigarettes on the market and other things, and my paper was stolen. I got so frightened and I\nwent to that woman from the office there. Said, \"Your fault. You will stay here. What you\nthink? I can make paper for you? Why do you go on the black market? Aren't you glad to get\nout from here?\" And shouted at me and all that. So I was told have to go to the office where\nthey lose and find and that was closed and after 4 o'clock it opened, and she didn't have\nanything and I had to bring...uh...uh...uh ...uh...little piece of paper that I was there. If she had\nno paper, so I went without the paper and I went back to her. Broken! Heart broken! 6\no'clock. And this is not just here, and there's a taxi or anything. All or a piece of bread. When\nyou have to you have to. So she told me, \"I'll tell you what. I go with you night to the __.\nMaybe they give you another paper.\u201d I just called them and told them about. She said, \"Let\nme see. Come over. I don't promise you anything.\u201d So night at 10 I met her, and we went\nover there. And I was sitting on the stairs of the ___, outside. Told me to come in. Took a\nlook. But she told me before to make pictures again, but the office was closed...the picture\nstores were closed, so I got on the black market a picture. I have still this little picture at\nhome. One...one of them. I paid a good price for it, and I got 4, 5 little pictures and I was\nafraid the passport will not accept it, will not be the right picture. Somehow, midnight I was\ncalled in. I gave him the picture and I was told to wait outside and in an hour I had a new\npaper with the picture on. I thanked her and I made my way and I hitchhiked to the station.\nThat was far away. So I was on one...on one car and then he set me off. He cannot go farther.\nAnd I got the second one and the third one. I arrived at the station 5 o'clock in the morning\nand I didn't see the car where we were in the train where we were in. So I met somebody that\nI was knowing from the train. He said, \"They changed...the last two days overnight on\nanother...another...another line.\u201d\u201d When I came there most of the people had given money.\nJewish people. When I come back, they said I will not get out from here. It can take a year or\nnot...never, and they took all money together and gave it to me. So I did not accept it. I said,\n\"I have papers.\u201d A day later I didn't go out anymore. I stayed in the car. Didn't even go out.\nThe next day we moved, and it took quite some time to get to the Polish border. I think 14\ndays or something like that. I arrived in July...in July. We left...left in June...beginning of\nJune. I arrived in July. Uh...There at the Polish border I went...the first station they let us out.\nWe wanted Bicksley, was Bresleytos. And I remember from my school years during the war\nthat Hindenberg made the first peace with the Russians in Bresleytos. And I was curious to\nknow how Bresleytos looked because there was ____. It was very famous. And I went to\nthe...to the marketplace, and there I saw women with the _____as their hair...head gear, all\naround with the scarf and they had rings and they had watches. You could buy everything if\nyou had money. So I said, \"Where did you get it all from?\" \"Oh, from the Jews.\u201d You know,\n____ Jews anymore. I said...when I asked him if see anywhere a synagogue. Synagogue? All\nburned.\u201d So with a heavy heart... didn't look at the watches. I didn't look at what has\nhappened. I went back to the train and about a few hours later we were at the Polish border.\nThe Polish border was already an officer...Polish officer standing and he called out, \"Who 1s\nCatholic in this train?\" We have for you help? I said, \"Who helps us?\" He said, \"The Joint\nin German, not here.\u201d What do you say to that? So we went on and in that train I made again\nthe acquaintance of a man who was from Poland and he went there by ____., by free will and\nhis two sons were in the Polish army and were officers even the army now. And he married.\nHe was a widower and he married another young woman with a child and he took her\nwith...one of these marriages to take out from Russia. When we arrived in Breslow,\nnow, well I as knowing Breslow, I was several times there during my youth time. There was\na famous...uh...rabbinical college, ___, interpreter of our thing. Uh...The policeman didn't\nlet us out. Let him out with his wife and child because the son was waiting for him and the\nofficer...uh...dressed in a Polish officer. So I went down nevertheless and I told him that I\nwas born in Germany. All I wanted was get back to Germany and he should be so kind to tell\nthe policeman to let me go. I am not going into that new territory that is between Breslow,\nbetween Katowice, between Krakau and the Oder River, you know, that is now Polish. And\nthere they want us to settle. The apartments were empty. Furniture was there. Everything!\nThe people they pushed out. When I came to Breslow he took us in...into his apartment, not\napartment. Had a big balcony. That balcony he let us live. He said, \"When you want to go to\nthe washroom you can come in. Otherwise you cannot come in. If you come in, then I have\nto tell you to go.\u201d That was a Friday afternoon some day in July.",
        "Q: ____ very clear. Who 1s taking you into the apartments?",
        "A: The son of that man that married the Jewish woman. He had two sons in the Polish army. He\nlived very nice. Half of the house was ruined but there was still some apartments in tact. It\nwas in the nicest neighborhood of Breslow. I was in that...in that train of the 30 of us or even\n40, but I was the manager of the 30...was a young man. He was learned Yeshiva, and he was\ngoing back. And the man by the Ginselman. Ginselman lived in Kotenish and he had always\na big ___. And he didn't...didn't associate himself with...uh...the Jews. In the train when he\nwas already on the way back to Poland, he said he is Jewish? I said, \"What do you have the\ncross on?\" And he explained it. They let him live. He worked. They let him live. So the\nYeshiva ___, and Ginselman and I were the three people that went in Breslow up on that\nbalcony. We prayed for each other that these are two people they let them come with me.\nAnd the other one said,\"____\u2014_\u2014.\u201d Let me...as always Jews...Jews are...and he said, \"Yes.\u201d\nThat Friday evening we decided...we had bread, and the Yeshiva __ had honey. How he\nhad it I don't know. And we ate honey and bread and we felt great. And not...not the one time\ndid they come out to ask us how we are, and only they watched us that we don't go farther\nthan the outside there to the washroom. Inside the apartment, but outside of the balcony.\nGinselman was not religious and he decided he's going to look on Sabbath morning what's\ngoing on in Breslow. What do we need him, he said. And the two of us said, \"God had gotten\na few months freedom in a way we will not violate the Sabbath. We'll stay here till the\nSabbath is out and tomorrow morning so God will be ____.. Ginselman came back evenings\nlate. He told us there is a so-called ghetto that the Jews were...uh..were kept, but it's better\nfor them that it would seem and the people they kept there, secure because there was always\na Jewish...uh..policeman ...uh...24 hours. You couldn't get in. There was still one synagogue\nleft in the rear. They didn't burn it because it was between buildings...an old, little synagogue\nand...uh...he got soup from the Joint. I never got 1t. When I came it was already out. I have\nnot quite such a good heart from that help to tell you the truth. Tell you later about it.\nAnd...uh...on the marketplace, we met a man that wasn't looking quite normal. And he had\nan apartment in a poor workers' neighborhood. He was..uh..repatriated too. He was...and his\nwife and he had two children. And he had a room where we could sleep. He said, \"You can\nsleep.\u201d He had two beds. Aw, come to get, but not on the streets, like in Russia. So we took\nit. But before I went to sleep, I went to the marketplace. What did I find out and you will be\nsurprised. A man by the name of Rosenberg, who was born in Poland, as a child came to\nHomburg. We went together to school, and he went to Russia by free will and his mother\nand his sister. He said to me, \"Max, you are born in Germany. You have a good chance to\nget out of here. I wish I had your birth certificate.\u201d I said, \"I have no birth certificate. I have\nno papers. The paper I had was paragraph 58 and I threw it away that nobody should even\nknow. So what should I do? I remembered I lived in Katowice. And when you live in Poland\nor in Germany, within 24 hours you have to go to the office to register. It's not the United\nStates. So I said, \"I will get an ____ certification that I was born in Germany.\u201d Because I\nwent up to the man of the Jewish community...he was a German Jew and he told me, \"You\nhave to bring papers.\u201d I said so and so. He said, \"I cannot do anything for you unless you\nhave a birth certificate. And my birth certificate was in the French zone. Essen on the Ruhr\n____. So I did not know what to do. So Rosenberg in the meantime introduced me to a\nwoman who had a ticket, a seat, number 64 in that train to go to Germany. She was a\nGerman Jewess from Breslow and she has a right to go. She has the papers. Elderly woman.\nShe said she would like to go later. She needs money. She needs something to buy to eat.\nAnd I had from the black market a suit. You wouldn't put on today, but it was a suit. I sold it\nfor six thousand...six thousand slota on the black market. I did this when I came back with\nthe papers...with the papers already. How did I get my papers? The afternoon I took a train\nfrom Breslow to Katowice. It was quite...uh...all night and it was Saturday, Friday evening\nwhen I arrived. Friday evening I had the card from Becker that he 1s in a kibbutz and I was\nknowing the address. I was knowing Katowice because I did business there. And I went to\nthat kibbutz. Oh, was he surprised to see me. And I got a good dinner. Chicken and the\ntraditional Jewish Friday evening dinner. And how did I sleep? We slept...they slept all over\nthe floor, but clean in___. So I said...they had no room, so the other one said, \"We'll push\ntogether. One...one Jew more. Oh...let him sleep there.\u201d But when they saw I had no ____.\nYou know what ___ 1s? I have it at home. My wife told me to take it with me. I'll give it to\nyou tonight. Uh...uh...they didn't want me to sleep without it. So I got it...she washed it last\nweek. I was looking for something else for my brother. Didn't find it, and I found that. And I\ngot the ____ which I will give you and...uh...slept the night. In the morning I had to wait for\nservices, and then they honored me in lifting the Torah and I didn't do it the proper way\nbecause you should turn around at least three chapters...have to show the...the community. I\nwas not there for that. I was for the paper to get out from here. And they closed at 12 o'clock\nso I made...I got out. I didn't wait for kiddish. I got out and they were very polite. I gave\nthem 200 slota, and I got a paper this and this born, there and there, lived here from that and\nthat time. He's the son of that and that, and he came from Germany that and that day. It was\nSaturday. Took me a whole day to go back. Saturday afternoon that I took the train back. It\nwas not yet night. It was dangerous for Jews on the street. It was 1946. Two young man said,\n\"He didn't kill them all. There's another one.\u201d And I went among...mingled among the\npeople. Had no...no luggage. I stood all night. The train was crowded. Had to stay...stand all\nnight, and I arrived the next morning and I went with my paper and I was looking for the\nwoman that wanted to sell me for 200 or three thousand dollars there the seat, and I found\nher and she got the 3...I sold the suit, and I gave her 3 thousand slota, and the other 3\nthousand slota I used for food to keep me over until I get somewhere where I get something\nto eat. He didn't want. He said, \"Why should this poor woman not stay here, and give it to\nyou. Give her the seat.\u201d The man from the ___ that was in charge of letting people go. And\non the other hand, \"This is not a birth certificate.\u201d I said, \"You make me ____.\u201d\u201d This tells\nyou I was from Germany and I speak to you in German. I speak to you...let me to say\ntoday...in English it has a German accent, but my German had no accent. You could see\nimmediately from where I come and I gave you the paper and the picture to it. Finally, he\nagreed and Monday morning I was on my way. I quickly bought bread and something to eat\nand...uh... I must tell you it was salted bacon. We couldn't have anything else. And before I\nwent into the train, three quarter of the bacon was taken away by the Polish checkpoint, and\nthe bread I... could keep, and I went into the train and I was one Jew among...among all\nGermans who was...were pushed out from that territory to make room for the Poles to take it\nover. Today, they don't think that way with Israel. They make it the point not there. Not\nthere! Because this is not given to you. But they...they did it at that time. I arrived at the...in\nthe zone in the Amer...in the Russian zone in Berlin. A German nurse was there. Blonde, and\nof course, friendly, and I told the English man, \"I don't want her to serve me. I don't want\nthat.\u201d And he insisted, \"She is here in charge, and you will have to.\u201d First of all, papers...1\ngave you the papers. Okay. \"You are one of them,\" he said, \"Yal.\u201d I said, \"I don't want any\nGermans. I heard what they did, and what they did to me.\u201d So I was deloused with DDT,\nwhich is today forbidden as you know. And I felt after that so fine, so relieved. Never had\nany lice anymore. Waiting on the other side, we decided to go to the English zone. There\nwere 5, 6, 7 people, quite intelligent Polish Jews. Not those three Jews that talk only Yiddish,\nbut educated with degrees and they were so glad to find a German. Somebody that speaks\nGerman that they...they will make no trouble. Said, \"You will speak Polish and I will speak\nGerman.\u201d So we went to the English zone, and there they gave us..they gave us a place...\nuh...if it wouldn't be summer, 1t would be very bad. It was the dancing hall of a hotel. And\nthere we got our things and we laid down and then we went for ticket to get food. As we\nwere refugees, they gave us double rations. Germans _____ double ration. The double ration\nwas not enough either. We put it together and the women started to cook.",

        "A: Stop, and I have to go to the washroom.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: What...what time is it? So sorry.",
        "Q: Okay, we have.....",
        "Q: Okay. Begin.",
        "A: To make it short, as soon as I came to...to Germany, I went from the English zone to the\nAmerican zone and that was the place where I was treated first as a humanbeing. Uh...I had\nto decide what to do. To wait to go to Palestine, to go to Cyrprus and not to Palestine so\nwhen I got a letter from my cousin of mine that lived in originally in Televiv but went\nafterward to Yonkers, New York, Dr. , Dr. Fred...Fred ____ and he told me I should come to\nthe United States. And he sent me immediately papers which I did not need because I had the\nright as a displaced person to go without papers if I had the quota. And the quota I had most\nof the people had to wait 10 to 12 years, and as I was in the German quarter, that start be\ngood for me to be from Germany. I waited only 4 months, and in 4 months I was on my way\nto the United States.

        "Q: How...uh...how did you feel about all this? How did all this experience affect you?",

It...uh...I\nhave no after affects. The only after affect is the way my mother, my sister, my nephew,\nniece were killed and how they...uh...took the health from my brother away that he died\nearlier than it was necessary. Otherwise, I...uh...survived with the hope that we will have\nhealthy State in Israel and...uh...I am busy with metals that concern Israel.",
        "Q: I thank you. You wanted to tell us about your brother.",
        "A: My brother...my brother very seldom wanted to talk about it because 1t was hurting him so\nmuch. He was an eye witness how our closest were killed. Uh...He was a doctor and...uh... he\nhad to flee Krakau where he was practicing ...uh...medicine when the war broke out in 1939,\nand he came to Kolomier, where he was born. He was the oldest. And...uh..he...he\ndescribed...he never wanted to talk about it but when he passed away among his...uh...papers,\nI found a letter reporting what has happened to the family and then... then one nice day,\nwhen he 1s not anymore here maybe I will have it and I will be the one that has to not let the\nworld forget what has happened to us during the HItler time. In the beginning when the\nGermans came in, after the Russians left, was occupied by the Russians, they...uh...took\nmy... my sister's apartment away. Uh...They...uh...they had to go to the ghetto\nand...uh...everything...everything was...uh... uh...taken...taken away. Uh...They were left just\nwith what they could carry in their hand. And only one person, as my brother worked for the\nGermans in the hospital for infectious diseases, the Germans didn't want to put one of their\ndoctors in for the danger, so they left there for the time being a Jew doing that work. So he\nhad the right to live outside of the ghetto, and one person with him who would take care of\nthe things in case he isn't there. So once my mother used to be there or my sister. They came\nout in order to have a bigger piece of bread because it wasn't even allowed to put a piece of\nbread into the...into the ghetto. And...uh...he smuggled always a piece of bread in and he\ncould risk his life that could be shot for that. But so once my mother had something to eat.\nOnce my mother had a little more...more bread. And the children, it had to be smuggled in.\nThen it didn't take very long and my sister was taken away under the...under the...that she\nwill be....uh...uh...how do they call? Resettled. And never came back. She was taken to\nBelzec. Then one nice day, the 2nd of February, 1943, my sister was taken away\nOshamaraba, 1942. And then...the 2nd of February of...of 1943...uh... my mother was taken\nout with the last 2,000 taken to Sheparowitz not far away from Kolomier, II kilometers as far\nas I know and there were already graves, mass graves prepared and she was shot and killed\nthere. When my brother came back evenings to this apartment where he had his so-called\npractice, Ukrainians were at the door and laughed him in his face. What? That's your\napartment? You must dream. He had night service and he came in the morning. And so they\nturned him back. Few days later he heard that he should be replaced by a Polish woman\ndoctor, should be finished up because there were only 4, 3 or 4 left of them in the whole city.\nDuring the Russian occupation, he helped a Polish woman...uh...professor of a\ngymnasium...uh... She...her father was a rich man. Had a lot of land, and her brother was a\npriest. They were taken and never heard of them when the Russians came. And she was...got\nout of that village in order to find work so that she wouldn't be taken without work into\ncaptivity. And she came to him without knowing him, and he was the manager of the\nhospital under the Russians before the Germans came in, and cried before him what should\nshe do? So he asked her, \"Can you be a cook? We need a cook.\u201d And she start to be the cook\nfor the hospital. She never forgot that. When the Germans came, she...uh...made...in her...in\nher apartment, they're living Italian officers. One was a doctor with the same specialty, Dr.\nRugoni, and she told him about my brother, that she heard that he is going to be replaced. So\nhe told her, \"Let him come to me.\u201d And that same day, afternoon, he took all his things off\nfrom him, and went to the Italian...uh... to the Italian soldier, to the barracks of the Italians,\nand there he was hiding him and they...their conversation was in Latin...whatever was\nnecessary. And he said he should not talk and he should make he cannot speak, that he was\nfor Stalingrad. He will say he was Stalingrad, and came out numb and dumb. Cannot hear,\ncannot talk, because he didn't talk Italian. Smuggled him into Italy and he worked for him in\nKosavecura, the doctor _____. And from there, he started to look for me and I start look\nfor him and through cousins in Israel, we were reunited in 1951. My brother had trouble with\nthe American doctors. They said, \"He probably has tuberculosis,\" and they kept him for 1\nyear back, and he was not on the German quota so I came in 1947. He came in June 51 to\nthe...to...to Chicago. So we were reunited. He lived with me for 20 years. He wouldn't get\nmarried because of circumstances and...uh...and he...1t took him 7 years again in Chicago to\nget a license. He had to go all everything through and internship which we went through\nand...uh...he practiced for 10 years medicine in Chicago until...then he was retired for 1 and a\nhalf or 2 years and...uh...he had a heart condition, but that didn't kill him. But he got cancer\nof the colon and he passed away in 1971, at the age of 73.

        "A: The school I attended was an orthodox school, real orthodox school, __\u2014. Our teachers\nwere good Germans, but they were good Jews too. We were very knowledgeable. The\nteacher that taught us math or geography was at the same time teacher __. After finishing\n5th school, it was not very hard to get a position as a apprentice. So you had to work 3 years\nwith a little pay in order to become a businessman. Interestingly as you asked me these\nquestions, something comes to mind. At the Christmas time, after I was | and a half years\nemployed, I was called...little bit over | and a half years, I was called to the personnel office\nand I was told...up to now they called you Haber, Haber. From now on your name will be\nHerr Haber. We let you... consider you that you finish your apprenticeship, but under the\nconditions that you stay with us the full 3 years, but your salary will be as of a full-\nfledged...uh...uh...employee. This reminds me about how Germany has changed. He was not\nJewish. He was very friendly. He was knowing that I was Jewish because I did not work on\nSaturday. I came Sundays. Sunday morning half a day, and Saturday I had off. Well, after a\ncertain years being offering them a buyer...",
        "A: In Homburg. Everything is Homburg. Everything is Homburg because as...uh...when I was\nstill a baby, we moved from Essen on the Ruhr to Homburg. In...uh...I became a\nbusinessman and was even for myself in business until I had to give it up when Hitler came\nto power. And end of 1933, my father having passed away and buried now in Homburg, I\nremained with my mother because my brother and my sister lived already in the East.\nMy...my sister married and my brother had to...in order to be...to be a doctor, practicing\ndoctor, had to go there where he was born. He was...when he was born, it was Austria, as I\nmentioned before, but it became after the first world...world war, Polish territory. In 1933, I\ntried to go to the United States. I had relatives there, an uncle, brother of my mother, and\ncousins. It was...I did not get an answer so that means I could not get any papers and go\nhere...go to the United States. So I decided in Germany I cannot stay and I went to Poland\nbecause my brother and sister lived there and they said there are three and a million Jews\nlive. You can live too. When I came to Kolomier where my sister lived, was a city not far\naway from Rumania border, and there I could make a living because I needed a territory\nwhere there was industry. So I figured it out and I went to Katowice. For two reasons. First\nof all, there was the so-called Polish industry, and the other one was that I did not speak\nPolish and I could help myself with a lot of German and a little Polish. And I even went to an\nevening school to know a little bit more of the language. I made a living, but in 39 we heard,\nin May 39, that there will come probably a war between Germany and Poland. So I decided\nto get out of Poland. But, as I mentioned, before you couldn't go anywhere. I met a young\nman on the street and I told him we had to talk. And I told him I think we get...have to get\nout from here, somewhere. So he just said..uh...(clearing throat) well, you have a Polish\npassport, you cannot go anywhere. You have the will to go, but nobody lets you in. A few\nweeks later I joined the ___ party on advice of friends and they told me that they will\nhave an illegal transport to Palestine some day in August. I jotned them, paid in, and we\nwent in this transport to the Rumanian border. In order to be told we cannot get\nfarther...farther, at that time the English Ambassador to Rumania told the Rumanians to\nwithdraw the visa to go through Rumania because they don't want illegal ships to come on\nthe...on the...on the borders of the Arab Palestine.",
        "A: I did not meet Begin because he kept himself incognito. He was afraid because the transport\nwas not...was not legal. I...he was pointed out later to me when we went...got through that\nthis is Begin. This was in August of 1939, and my sister lived in that city. I came back and I\nhad nowhere to go. And when the war broke out I was in Kolomier, the city that my sister\nlived and my mother was there because I left her there because I was going to Palestine. We\nwere very surprised when on the Ist of September the war broke out and nobody came to the\nhelp of the Poles. Neither the English nor the French. We know that 2 days later, they\ndeclared war against Germany, but no help. And we thought, \"Where is Russia?\" Nobody\ncame to help, and as you all...as everybody knows, Poland was overrun by the Germans and\nin 14 days Warsaw was taken. My brother who was at that time in Krakau, and on the way to\nWarsaw because he hoped that there will be the least possibility that the Germans will get it,\nbut then he saw that in...1n 10 days, they were already close to Warsaw they changed their\nroutine and went to the Rumanian border and so we were reunited in Kolomier altogether the\nwhole family once more except my father who was not anymore alive. Thirteen or 14 days\nlater the Russians came in. And I remember so well because they came with tanks, slowly in,\nand every second tank did not function. A few days later we saw trains going day and night\nout of Poland with everything they could get...put their hands on and they were at that time\nmaking the Ribenthrow-Molotov Pact and felt obliged to give them food and assistance to\nkill everything that 1s...uh...capitalist. Soon thereafter you had to stand for bread in line.\nEverything was...you couldn't get. The businessmen were forced to sell everything they had\nfor was declared as null, as...of no value. And when I looked at all these\nthings, I decided I will get out from here whatever. And so my brother-in-law joined me and\nwe went to the border and hoped to help to get to the Rumanian side. Instead, I landed in\nRussian hands because the people that wanted to brings us over there, agents of the Russians.\nI went to several prisons, smaller prisons.",
        "A: I went to several prisons, smaller prisons, and within 8 or 10 days...I don't remember exactly,\nwe were back in Kolomier in the prison of Kolomier. There I was interrogated twice at\nmidnight. But I made it very simple. I said, \"I am a Jew from Germany and I lived in Poland\nbecause I could not stay anymore in Germany and here in Poland I was not even at home and\nI wanted to go to Palestine. That was, of course, for the Russians already a prison term of 5\nto 10 years because as a Zionist you were already not considered a nice person. Then from\nthere we went to Stanislav...Stanislav, of course, and from there to Limburg __, and there\nmost of the people once more interrogated I was not. I had a clear case. A Zionist! A man\nwho didn't like Russia. We came to...to free them and to make a better life for them and he\nwanted to get away. And according to that, they gave me paragraph 58, which means they\ncannot be anything worse than as a politician...uh...political prisoner. That's what they had in\nthe paragraph 58. From there, we were several months in prison. Of course, the prison was\nnot clean. We got a lot of lice and...uh...the food was not good, but later on this was good\nfood. Then we were taken to Kiev from there. It took us about 10 to 15 days to get there. I\ndon't know exactly the days.",
        "A: In cars, in...1n animal cars. Uh...42 a car. Uh...It was the 18th of March 1940 that we arrived\nin Kiev. Uh...There we were taken into an office and we thought of course, it would be right\nto take the hat off, and he told us in Russian, \"This is not a church. You can have the hat on.\u201d\nHe had his on. But we slept on the floor, on a stone floor and they didn't give us anything to\neat until we went into a cell. That was about 24 hours later. There they started to get...not to\ninterrogate us and that...this...this room was made for eight people and we were 40. The few\nstrong people slept on the bed. The other slept on the floor. When we came, there was a\nRussian man in there, and they took him pretty soon out because a big part of the people\nwere Jews that fled Poland from the other side where the Germans came and they took them\nprison...as prisoner anyhow if they didn't do anything either. Then 2 days later there was an\nother man with us who was Jewish. His name was Mesha. He was very friendly and we...he\nsaid...we asked him what are you here doing...doing here. He said, \"I am a leather cutter and\nI stole a little bit of leather. He gave me 2 years.\u201d But he used to get packages. He used to be\nvery friendly, and he heard what we talked and up to the time when Paris fell to the Germans\nthat means somewhere in June or July...don't know exactly, we didn't know that people that\nare interrogators take nights out and I was not, as I told you before, I had a clear case what I\nam. A Zionist! They told me there were a lot of papers in different languages. He was very\nfriendly...gave him cigarettes. ___ in German. And...uh...looked to...looked to it that they\nshould see that Paris was taken by the Germans. So he told them, \"You see. Now the\ncapitalist are gone. Now we will fight the fascist. That 1s our purpose.\u201d So he came back to\nthe cells and I...I.... heard from anybody of them...from all of them the same...the same news.\nAnd in August 1940 they took us all down in the former church of the Kiev prison and told\nus we will judge...be judged now and get the sentence. I was called and there were three men\nsitting there, not dressed very nicely. , proud of it and said in Russian language. May I say it\nin language which I talk you know? ___ CCS. That meen,\n\"The judges of three gave you 5 years.\u201d When I asked _____ for what? The answer was\n.. \"You will find out.\u2019___ \u201cYou will go into a camp and then you don't\nwithstand it, you just die like an animal. We got double rations and prepared for the transport\nto the camp. Uh...Somewhere beginning of September we were taken out and went to a place\nnot far away from...from Kiev farther north I imagine. It was north. And there we were\nprepared to be shipped to different kind of places. Chernigov was the name of that place\nand...uh...there was a woman doctor, a Jewish woman doctor and I told her that I suffer\nfrom...uh...ulcers. \"Oh,\" she said, \"Everybody has here something and nobody wants to go to\nwork.\u201d And that was it. But 2 or 3 days later, a transport went and two or three of us stayed.\nWas not sent out. Was not for the better. Was not for the worst. We were retransported to\nKiev. And there we went into that big church that was not any more a church in the prison,\nand we were among real, real thieves, murderers...6, 7 of us. There it happened to become\nRosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. How did we know it? By the moon. Jews have the\nmoon calendar. We were knowing when it was full moon and so on and so on and so on. But\nwe had...we were not 10 people, and we were in one corner. All of a sudden that afternoon,\nthe day before Rosh Hashanah, they threw us in three young men like...looking like Hasidim\nwith the beard, with Patots, and they came from the ditches, and they were originally from\nGalicia, taken prisoners and were kept in the ditches but were now prepared to go with the\ntransport probably with us a new transport into concentration camp. The man that was on the\ntable who was directing everybody, the main man, the chief of the criminals, wanted to know\nwho they are. They considered them like angels. He never saw people like that and he\nwanted to know from us and we told them we have a holiday and they were sent to us and so\nthey made peace with us and did not touch us, did not bother us for 2 days...the criminals.\nBut before that they took...when I had...uh...handkerchief or whatever I had, they took\neverything from us because they had nothing and everything was dealt with like on the black\nmarket. You exchanged tobacco for this or that. Between Rosh Hashanah Yom Kippur, we\nare put in a train. The train was not...uh...a car..uh...animal car, but it had grates and it was\nsimilar to the first class of prewar Germany. Hard seats and outside was both sides soldier\nwith a gun, and we were transported through Russian Europe. To show it is nor so bad, we\nwere in a train like humanbeings. But as soon as we atrived...as we reached the ___, we\nwere put again in those wonderful trains and it took us several weeks. On the transport there,\nthere was a day when we didn't get...more than a day when we didn't get nothing to eat. The\nfood was handed out every morning to the leader of that car...car...of that...uh...of\nthat...uh...animal car. And he was a Pole...he was...uh... uh...a criminal. They never put a\npolitician in charge. He had a dirty handkerchief which he used for everything and in that\nthey gave him this little bit of sugar. 40 people got so and so much sugar, and it was\nmeasured in a...in a little...uh...match box. A little match box was measured out to\neverybody. And then we got the bread. The bread was good at that time. When you were\nhungry, you could eat it, and it was 5 or 6 hundred grams. Little bit more than a pound of\nbread. We arrived in Yetsevel. It was called Yetsevel. That was originally a point where the\nfirst prisoners came. It was only a forest. They got...all they got was a saw and a hammer,\nwhatever, to build there a station. They lived in...under 30 degrees...they lived in...in tents\nuntil it was built. And that was the place that the Germans used to call the umschlagplatz,\nwhich is the same thing. And there we were gathered together. And when we arrived...of\ncourse, hungry, exhausted, with lice, first met a Jewish fellow and he was in charge of the\nsauerkraut...of the sauerkraut...uh...basins. There were big basins and that was...this...this\nplace has mostly cabbage. And so they made that as a diet for prisoners. The bread, the\ncabbage, and the...and the cabbage soup day in and day out. But we didn't stay very long\nthere. He told us it's very bad here and he... uh...managed to see already a month here but\nthen they sent you away it's so bad there and somebody come back he...he cannot tell us\nanything good. So the next morning, we went out...1t was about...was not more than Il or 12\nkilometers from there and we went on the railroad siding because there was no street. There\nwas no other way but by the railroad went once a day or went every two days, to and back on\nthe same...same...uh...same...uh...same...same thing. When we arrived in that....that camp, by\nthe name of Meuselwitz. In my opinion there were there not less than 3 or 4 thousand\nprisoners. There were already Polish prisoners there or Jewish prisoners there and first when\nwe came we were put in a barrack or call it...uh...to... to...where...where you...where you live\nand where you sleep, and that was like made out of a few boards and the wind was blowing\nin. In the middle was a big furnace, iron furnace and the prisoners came home wet from work\nand everybody and I...I...around the oven warmed himself and dried his clothes. Otherwise, it\nwas cold all...all over and the only light that was there was about in a big, big place, a little\nabout maybe... The next day we had to go to work. How do we get the soup? You don't get\nanything in Russia. Don't get the fork. Don't get the spoon. You have to see that you get it,\nthat you make it yourself. So there were prisons who said I will first go and then you...give it\nto you when it's empty and you go. But you have to be 1n time outside to go to work. They\nmade spoons out of wood and the can that was an empty American can...uh...meat was\neventually in...packed in, and that was made to...uh...to a can where you received your...your\nsoup. Standing in line, you got your soup and we went out early at 6 o'clock in the morning\nand music was playing...prisoners. And they played. When they saw there was a lot of Jews,\nthey played Jewish songs. Like ____. When we went out to work, we went over | and a\nhalf hours til we got there where I work was. And what was the work? To cut trees. Not with\nelectric cuts, but two men with a saw and others had to transport it and so on and so on. I was\nnot able to do that work and I was when I came back I did a little something in order not to\ngo to prison...in prison and I got...uh...300 grams of bread. Others got 700 because they\nworked good. But it showed after them that after 2 years of that kind of work that I was\nbetter off than the others because they got more bread, but they died too from the hard work,\nand I somehow survived. I became so thin. I lost a lot of weight. You could see all my ribs.\nIn June of 1900...0f 1941 when the Germans attacked Russia, we heard it in the camp on\nloud speaker and the...uh...all the foreigners were told they're going to freedom if they are\nPolish citizens because of the attack on...on...on...on Russia. I was not called. Most of them\nwere called, and every day so and so many disappeared to so-called freedom. Three months\nlater, I was called. Was one of those cases that they didn't know what to do with. I was\ncaught...taken on Polish territory, had relatives that were Polish...Polish citizens and I, on the\nother hand, was German born. So I was sent back and was...that was the most terrible time in\nmy life. I was beaten up by other prisoners because they thought I was too...too happy to\ngo...to go away but I was still one of them. These prisoners were...had the same faces like\n____ today and Armenian but were there and accused Jews that because of us they are here.\nThe Jews are the leaders of communism and as I am a Jew, they beat me up. When I see\ntoday on television those faces, these were the people they did it to me. In the camp the man\nthat cut the bread was sentenced in 37 to 10 years because he was ___. There was a time\nwhen Stalin cleaned out and then he found somebody _____ and got 10 years. I got only 5\nyears. The doctor was a ____, and the other doctor was a_. And when there came Yom\nKippur I went to the doctor and I told him I cannot go to work. That was the first Yom\nKippur I...the first Yom Kippur I was in the train. The second one I had to go to work, but I\ndid not work, but when I came back I got 10 days prison in prison for not working. So I\nspent 10 days with young boys age 10 to 14 or 16 who played cards on my rags that I had\nthere and they made me sleep at the latrine. I had to take it out, and I got my bread...instead\nof picking it up I got it 3 hours later and the soup cold. In day time I went to work and when\nI came back from work this was a 10-days prison in prison. The...uh...second Yom Kippur I\ndid not work because I complained again and this doctor shouted at me. His name was Ilia\nSelimonowitz. I don't have the family name. And he said you don't want to work and that's it,\nand you will go to work, that's it, and get out. The next day the marchik is the...that is a man\nwho drives you to work, that sees to it that nobody stays inside. It's usually a criminal and\nmany years of experience there and if necessary, he beats you up, then...then you have\nenough. You will remember next time not to hide. He...uh...called out my name that I am not\ngoing because I'm sick. So this whole scene was made by the doctor in order not to be under\nsuspicion that he is on a high holiday...on a high holiday, Jewish high holiday freeing\nprisoners not to work. The third Yom Kippur...I came before that already an invalid\nbecause I was weighing....I did not know my weight, but I was so thin and so weak that they\ncould not push me to work. So the doctors, Polish doctor declared me an invalid of _._That\nmeans I have the right to sleep on the bunker. I get a piece of the bread and the soup and I\ndon't have to go to work. So that Yom Kippur I did not go to work because I didn't have to. I\nmention that because it was...at that time when I started to give a account, I had a home. I\nhad a family. I had a mother, a brother, a sister, relatives. And all probably looked where I\nam, hungry and almost dying. My body was going. It was my soul. My knowledge of my\nreligion, my education from Homburg that made me think I will survive, gave me hope. I\nused to cover myself and forget where I am and dreaming that today is holiday. The fourth\nYom Kippur I was in a camp because Russia lost a lot of people at Stalingrad and in the war\nat all, and they started to empty out prisons...prison camps, especially those people that could\nnot work. And they want them out maybe to replace the men that were killed. So I was sent\nto a camp. There I was told I cannot go out. He looked at me and he said in Russian\nlanguage,\"___\u2014\u2014.\u201d\u201d He is such a bird. They don't know what to do with.\u201d There is such an\nexpression in Russian, __. Such a bird! So I was sent back and a few days later I was\ncalled to the gate and I was told to go take my few things, less than I brought here today.\nAnd there was a horse and wagon waiting and a woman was sitting on it. She's going to have\na child. And I...and the...the man with the gun, __, went with us to go to another camp.\nCould see it from far away. It was a workers' camp. In contrast to this camp which was an\nassembly place for those they took eventually go out. I couldn't walk that far so I told him I\ncannot. I was sitting down in the snow. I cannot. So he told the woman to go up...down, and\nput me up because the horse could not pull that much. Such a horse wasn't fat either. We\nfinally arrived after | and a half hours there and there I was taken to the office and in the\noffice there was sitting a woman that...uh...told me, \"Grandpa.\u201d And I looked at her because I\nhad a beard and I walked with a cane which I bought for a piece of bread...that somebody\nmade out of wood. And she said, \"Take a look.\u201d I said, \"I'm not a grandpa. I'm 39 years old,\nand I...\u201d And she said, \"Take a look at the mirror.\u201d And it was the first time in many years\nthat I saw a mirror and I didn't recognize myself. Being friendly to me...she was a ___, she\nwas a prisoner too. She told me...uh...I told her, \"I'm hungry. I didn't get anything to eat from\nthe morning til now. It's afternoon.\u201d She said, \"I cannot give you anything I don't have.\u201d And\nit was Christmastime, and nobody was there of the high ranking. And she said, \"Evenings\nwhen they give everybody to eat again.\u201d So I had to wait. And I got the piece of bread and I\nwent..before that I went to the ___, so called hospital of the camp and told the doctor I\nhardly can walk. I'm hungry. And he looked at me and he never saw somebody with the ribs\nout like this and he put me on the scale and I weigh...weighed 40 kilo, which you know is 88\npounds. It was the first time in 4 years I found out how much I weigh. So he put me in the so\ncalled sick... sick...uh...place, and there I got twice a day soup. The bread was\nbrought...brought to me, and one spoonful of oil. What kind of oil I don't know. After 14\ndays...it's the most time a man can be there, I didn't gain because he weighed me again. I\ndidn't weigh...weigh...uh...gain any weight, but he told me he has to sign me out. And I was\nsigned out. I was put in a barrack and the people there...working people. They went out. And\nwhen they saw somebody weak, never from the outside where you're beaten. They didn't\ntouch you. When you stood before them, you had to have your hands in the back and that\nwas it. Never! Never! Never! They told you only in nasty words but otherwise you were not\nbeaten. The prisoners were among themselves because so many nationalities which hated\nthemselves and they were altogether there in those camps. Uh...One tried to take away this\nlike can that I had where I got my...my...my soup. The other one saw my...my jacket which\nwas rags was better than his, and he wanted me to exchange. But lucky enough towards\nevening...quite a bit of people came back from work and among them boys from Vienna.\nJewish boys from Vienna. Oh, I said...and I am bad on Germans and working there. This is a\nworking camp and I will not go free. And that was very sad. But they had flour because they\nworked unloading flour and they brought flour with them. And they took water and flour and\nmade it because our soup was watery. The spoon did not stand, but there the spoon stood.\nAnd they gave me as much as I wanted of flour and water and with a spoon to eat. And I told\nthem about what the others do to me and they went over and told them, \"You are talking here\nto soldiers. You will get it.\u201d And they let me go. Let me go. They called me uncle. Was 20.\n21 years boys that were expelled from Vienna. Children of...probably of parents that once\nwere from Galicia and lived in Vienna and the children are born there and they were\nprisoners there. What happens to them I don't know. Anyhow, after a short while I was\ncalled back to the other camp. When I came to the other camp it was empty. Only a few\npeople from...uh...which you see now on television from this..from those Republic that wants\nto be by themselves. They...we had there to sleep. The food was not good. Again a piece of\nbread and that soup. So I had no other way. I lived everyday in and out, but I didn't go to\nwork. It was in February. It was Christmastime. It was in February. We didn't have the\ncalendar. I cannot tell you exactly the date and it was very hard winter, of course there 40\nbelow. And...uh...but one nice day, that is a nice day in 44, in March 44, I went somewhere. I\nwent to the man of the kitchen, in charge and he was from White Russian, a Polish citizen\nfrom White Russia and he wanted to learn how to speak German. So he will give me a little\nbit of bread and soup. So I spent my time with him. As soon as he didn't cook I spent my\ntime with him. When I came back to the barrack, \"Where are you? Where have you been?\"\nThe _ looked for you. I said to him, \"I'm free to go. I don't have to go...be where...I'm in the\ncamp. I was in the camp.\u201d The _____ came back, called my name. Always that same way,\n\"Maxim S\u2014C.\"\" Max, the son of Solomon. _ You go to freedom. I didn't believe it\nbecause I was once sent there before. He said, \"You are the bird.\u201d And he didn't let me out.\nThat was in March of 1944. In other words, I was 4...and 4...and 4 years and 5 months about\nin prison. He told me I have to go and get a shave, a haircut, and a so-called bath. That\nmeans a little bit of water with...with almost no soap and the second one to put...to put over\nme, to clean me up from the soap. They gave me a different jacket than I had on. It had no\nholes and it was very good. It suited me so that the next 2 years at my house as everything\nwhere I slept on there, where I kept my bread, where I kept everything. The next\nmorning...and I must tell you according...1t was the 27th of March...of April...of April. I'm\nhere...I'm here wrong. On the 27th of April, Yom Ha-Shoah falls on the same date today\nwhen I was liberated and I was knowing it that it was the 27th day of Mishnah, because of\nthe moon again. I went to freedom. How? The __, elderly Russians...among them one\nJew, a lawyer from Leningrad who got 10 years as a Troskiers, and he was have to serve...he\nserved for 47, but they let him out because of sickness in 44. Like several others. We went to\nthe station. They gave us a loaf of bread, but we considered that it's too weighing too much.\nWe cut off one piece for the two days trips. And a herring...not a herring that you buy.\nThere's everything in. There's nothing taken out, but you like it you ate everything. Ate even\nthe bones you chewed down all the way. One herring and this piece of bread and that was it.\nSo we came to the station quite a bit from the camp. There the window was closed and after\na certain time she opened it up. There was...uh...uh...a station made of wood. Everything is\nwood there. They have nothing else, but wood. And it was, of course, cold. Worse than\noutside because the cold inside is usually worse when it's not heated. And she opened up.\nShe said, \"Children.\u201d In Russian they talked that way. \"The Biata...I have no tickets for you\ntoday. The train will come through in half an hour and they have no space on that train. The\ntrain from Blabiwostick to go...went through there and we were going\nCity of Kotanich. That is the city where the Czar used to send all people that didn't behave\nlike politically sent there, and there everything was encumbered there. There were more\nencumbered there than free people. There we were sent. The next day we complained it is\ncold. What shall we do? She said, \"I have a saw. I have everything. Go to the forest. It's not\nfar...far from here. Get some wood and heat it. I will be glad to.\u201d I said, \"Are you kidding?\nWhen we take the wood from today, it will take months to dry to be able to make fire with it.\nYou want us to make for you wood. We'll let you have it later. So all of us went up...up\nthere. There was a gallery and one next to the other warmed himself. The food was gone.\nThe bread was gone. The herring was gone. Before we went into the train. Who keeps bread?\nBecause it was immediately stolen by somebody else. When you kept it, he took it away\nfrom you. If you slept for 1 minute there were among them thieves enough, and they took it.\nIt took ...uh...I think 3...no 2 days...2 days, the 27th...29th yal, we came to Kotenish. On the\nway...uh...to...uh...where they told us to go, we met...we met a man with one foot. And he\nwas in...he was in the...in the army and lost his foot. He was shoeless. He ask...he asked us,\n_____. Are you Jewish? ___. The lawyer and I. Then he changed into Yiddish. He didn't\nknow much. First he said, \"Shalom.\u201d He said, \"The lawyer told him he 1s from Leningrad\nand he got 10 years.\u201d He told him a little bit of his story, and his wife and daughter and other\nchildren are here and here but he cannot go now because it's frozen. And he will have to be\nin Kotenish. They wrote him about it until he can make it by boat because he had no horses\nto go on the ice. __, a German Jew. He sent me to a butcher who had goose there in the\nmarketplace. All I had what my papers was that I was come from a concentration camp,\nParagraph 58, that means Russianary...a man who can be a spy, everything the worse that\nexists. And I came to this goose and I told him that a man with one foot who had by the way\nthe Lenin...uh... Medal for bravery sent me to you. And he said to me, \"German Jew? You\nfrom the concentration camp you come out now.\u201d All the Jews came out in 41. He was a\nPolish...but he was not in a concentration ever because he was a communists and he went by\nthat means by free will when the Russians came in he reg...registered he wants to go\nwhere the Messiah 1s. There he had the butcher...the butcher thing there, butcher store. From\nhere he gave to the workers every week or every two weeks a piece of meat that was allowed\nto them because of work. If they worked they got...except Vodka, a piece of bread. And he\nsaid, \"The German Jews were not nice to us.\u201d I said, \"It is true I was born in Germany, but\nmy parents were not born and to prove to you I speak fluently Yiddish.\" Start talking\nYiddish and he thought it over and he looked here and there, couldn't make his heart giving\nin to give me something. But then we looked and as far as three times from here to the door,\nthe other side of the marketplace was a young man looking like a Haludient and he looked\nand he called him because he was knowing him. So he told him...uh...a German Jew, __,\nuh...1s here and he wants...and he wants to...uh...to...uh...make me to help him. He comes\nfrom the concentration camp. So he took out 300 rubles and gave it to him to give it to me.\nWhen he did that he went and bought me...brought me a piece...a little piece of a...of a roll,\nblack roll and some milk. So I told him I cannot use the milk. I haven't had it for several...for\n5 years almost. I'm afraid to drink it. But the bread...so he brought me _____ which is\nboiled water. In Russia, as soon as they came in occupied they put a kettle on the...up in the\nmiddle of the city and constantly burning and to that you have hot water but no sugar. So\n[...I...1 came about early afternoon and I made him, as I talk to you, I think I am capable to\nconvince him that I am not so bad and he should help me. He brought me more bread and he\ntold me, \"I am living with a Russian woman. She has a...they all had their own one room or\ntwo room home, and sometimes a cow. Sometimes! And he even made the remark if she's at\nhome she should burn...and in Yiddish it sounds even different...then I cannot give you\nanything. But if she is not at home I will give you potatoes....uh...fried potatoes. I was lucky.\nShe was not at home.",
        "A: Fine. I have to go to the washroom.",
        "A: Okay. How it 1s so far. I have it still a long to talk. It will be more than 2 hours.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: When we talk about the butcher, he had not a butcher's store. It was a booth with an open\nwindow and nights locked. You couldn't go into it. From the street, you showed your\nthat means to prove that you are entitled to so and so much meat. And he gave it to you and\nhe saw to it that he didn't give you everything to you was yours because he needed some for\na black market so that he could exchange it. The...he took me home and he wanted to help\nme. All of a sudden, his Jewish heart came out. He wasn't an educated man, but his Jewish\nheart came out and he said, \"Stop suffering.\u201d I did not know...I thought he...I said, \"You went\nby one of the _____ and they were nice to you. You were a friend. I wasn't considered a\nfriend.\u201d So he went with me to another Jewish place. The man was not married and he lived\nina small __ there. I said, \"All I can do....I cannot sleep here. I can give him bread.\u201d And that\nwas like giving you blood. Because it was rationed. And he gave me a big piece of bread. I\nhad, as I told you before...uh... ___ called and there I put in with the piece of rag a big\npocket. And needles we made ourselves. Got a piece of wire and yarn we got from other\nmaterials and I sewed a big pocket in and there I kept all the things that I hoped I will have\nwhen I...get...don't get anything I will not die from hunger. Of course, I couldn't eat anymore\nbread so I put the bread away. Then he continued...he needed from me where to go to sleep.\nOutside was still 30 below, and it was end of May. So we went to a place. Her name was\nSara. I never was her...know her name. And there was somebody living there by the name of\nShiem, Shier. And her so called husband...don't know, Samuel...I don't know. Don't\nremember. She was...she had two rooms. One was like this window here where we are look\non it, that you could look out and there was a big scale inside a scale...outside the scale and\ninside to read up how much it weighs. The farmers used to bring their product...delivered,\nthat they had to deliver and she rated...and in the other room there slept. And he told her,\n\"Sara, the man has to sleep somewhere. You know I cannot take him to me.\u201d She wouldn't\ngive. But here he is among Jews...you understand, and she said, \"When Shier comes home\nfrom work, she will talk to him. So I waited...he went home in the meantime and left me\nthere...get rid of me, and then the others will take over. So when Shier came home he said,\n\"No. We don't know you. You may have lice.\u201d\u2019 They had the lice. I was deloused. When I\nwent out I was deloused. So they had lice. And he cannot...no...and he gave and he gave me\na piece of bread. It is blood and a drink. And they let me be on the hayloft. There I went up\nand I thought maybe the hay...when I go under the hay I will not...I will be not too cold. It\nwill be not so bad. But after 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes I had to get up. Couldn't stand there. I started\nto exercise, do whatever I could and I was waiting because I went to bed 6 o'clock,\ngot...got...got night there and... uh...in the morning...the nights were short. Came already\ntowards June and there was already sometimes when it had only half a hour night. And I was\nwaiting for the morning to see again the butcher. Shier came up before he went to work and\nhe told me in Yiddish, \"___\u2014_.\u201d\u201d So I told him, \"It's cold and I am almost frozen and so\non and so.\u201d He cried and he gave me 500 rubles. He said for 500 rubles, could buy 2 and a\nhalf loaf of bread on the black market. It 1s not so much, but 2 and a half loaves of bread. I\nwent to the butcher and I told him everything and he went...he brought me a hot soup. Not\ngood, not that soup. It was bitter, bitter flour. I don't know what's tn it...what it...what it was.\nProbably a food that they give to animals but...uh...you cannot die from it. And I\nhad...uh...the hot soup and the bread again and he was...he told me he made an arrangement\nwith a Russian Jew who has chil...children that are...uh...manager of a cohorse. Cohoss is\nlike the kibbutz. When he came and he start to talk to me, I went with him because he started\nfrom Kanaa and he wanted to know this and that. \"Oh,\" he said, \"Yal. Yal. Yal.\u201d And he\nshowed me his wife is standing on the black market and sell things. They were fleeing the\nGermans, and he pretended that they always...that they took the last things with them and he\nsells it day after day so that they can live. But in fact, he was a black marketing. Things she\nbought, got and they lived. So he took me home and I got the first time after 4 and a half\nyears of my life, I got a hot dinner. That means a piece of meat, a soup with beans and..and\nnoodles. But sleeping he couldn't give me. He was tight, and they didn't know who I am from\na concentration camp. Didn't know. And I had a beard and I walked with a cane. I didn't look\nlike I look today. Came back and the man, the butcher went home and he couldn't do\nanything for me so I went to the railroad station. Because the railroad station you wait for a\ntrain and there 1s an oven. So I went there to sit down and warm myself until the next night\ngoes through and then I had an appointment with a Ukrainian manager where the children\nsaid he should get in touch with me to go to the cohoss. There IJ had...there had a hat... had\nto sleep and where to live. I was sitting there and fell asleep at the oven, at the belly oven\nbecause I didn't sleep the night before and I was always on my feet. I wonder today how I\ndid it. And I was awake by...uh...by...uh... . And he said, \"What are you doing here? Where is\nyour papers?\" Papers mean that everybody that was over those years had to have a passport.\nSo I had to have something to show who I am and why I am in this city. If I'm allowed in this\ncity or in this village. You couldn't go from one city to one village without permission of the\n_____. When he looked it...oh, he said, Paragraph 58, come on with me. And he took me to\nhigher...like you see him today on television was a nicer camp. You know, you see them\ntoday. And he told me...he told me..uh...what are you doing here. Where.... I said, and I told\nhim about that...what I told right now. I said I was released from a concentration camp and I\nhave nowhere to be and I'm frozen. Why it was much better in the camp. I got a little bit of\nsoup and a piece of bread, but there I couldn't lay down. It's worse than freedom in here. He\nsaid...and I showed him...I said I have to work. I said where should I work? If I cannot work\nin the camp and I showed him I was only bones. Think he...he cried or anything? He told,\n\"Get out of here. This time I let you out. Otherwise, we give you another 10 years. Get out of\nhere. When I find you once more, then you go back to a...to a camp.\u201d So I was afraid to go\nback and I spent the rest of the night up and down on the street. Snow! Winter! Siberia! The\nnext day I hardly could wait for the butcher again. There was my place where I met my\nfuture helper. And the Ukrainian manager came. He was quite nice. Ukrainians were not so\nnice to Jews, but he was at that time quite nice to me. He said, \"Can you teach me German?\"\nI said, \"Yes.\u201d \"So come on to...with me to our cohoss and I will see to it that you have\nsomething to eat.\u201d And he took from the newspaper a little piece of paper because they have\nno paper there...from a newspaper and wrote down to the kibbutz manager there, a woman,\nto give me 4 or 5 potatoes...I don't remember the details, 4 or 5 potatoes and a bowl of\nsauerkraut. So I waited because I will go with several other people, with their girl who had\nbeen to the marketplace, brought there something from the village to take home, salt,__,\nand he told that one girl, \"See to it that he goes there and there...there to this village,\"\nbecause she lived not far away. She didn't know if I was Jewish. She didn't know who I was.\nShe saw that I'm a grandpa. Good looking, strong, not educated girl. And she helped me to\ncarry that little wooden case where I had nothing in. I...1...1 threw it away after that. (clearing\nthroat) And when I came they were all sleeping because it took us a long time. They were\nall sleeping. She woke up. I gave her this little ticket. She gave me the potatoes. She gave the\nsauerkraut and in the farm house always benches along in Russia, where they sleep. They\nsleep on the oven and all on the benches all high up because the heat goes up. So I laid down\nand I couldn't... couldn't get up anymore. I couldn't get up anymore because in walking so\nfar, I had pains here, my bones. I think close to the...to the first of May. I made there a\nmistake. It was the first of May...1t was the end of April and not May. I have got to correct\nthat. I was...was right originally that it is...uh...it is the 27th of April and...uh...not May.\nUh...uh...I got...they were sitting down that day over meat, bread, soup and I didn't get\nanything. Uh...She told me in Russian, she told me ___\u2014S\u2014S\u2014\u2014\u201c \"Whoever does not work\ndoes not get.\u201d She had red hair and all the people that worked in that cohoss came to that\nparty and she had I think 3 or 4 or 5 children from different men. There was one...I think he\nwas 16 years old. Red hair like his mother, and he didn't like it what she talked to me. And\nhe took something from the table when she went away for a minute and gave it to me and\nsaid, \"Cover yourself and eat.\u201d And that was it. The next day I was waiting for the man, the\nmanager of the cohoss, Ukrainian. That day I got so much soup, so much bread. Course\nmeals, but so much but after then I was afraid I will fall sick. Everything was bloated, not\nused anymore to such food because it was all chunked together. For the first next few days, I\ndid not work. I taught him German. And he gave me a piece of sausage which was not good\nfor me because it was fat. I couldn't...I wasn't used to anything...any that, and...uh...I...1...1\nmight...may make a joke. | lived all the way...all the time kosher. We never got any meat. All\nwe got was a cabbage and a piece of bread and sometimes a a head of a fish. A head of fish\nor a herring. And I didn't want it. For two reasons! I was afraid I cannot digest it and on the\nother hand, I break...I break dietary laws. I thought to myself. Then I\nbecame...uh...uh...watching the field evenings, nights...uh...as a watchman that nobody takes\nout the newly put in potatoes or whatever. Of course, it was cold and all night and it was that\nreason...for that you got a piece of bread, like in the camp and the soup and...uh...and every\ntwo weeks a bottle of vodka, a liter of vodka. I didn't stay very long there because I couldn't.\nIt was too cold outside. So he transferred me to the hospital for the...to the state hospital of\nthat city for the people that were not quite healthy and there were quite a bit of German\nsoldiers there that ____ and they talked freely. Hitler will win and all that because they were\nnot normal. And there I couldn't stay very long because there was a night service and they\nwanted me to clean up there what they did on the floor and all that, and they had no soap\neither. So I didn't stay very long, but the doctor in charge over there, the Russian woman,\nsaw that I...uh...must be...some...somewhere...some...she wanted to know more about me.\nAnd...uh...she gave me cigarettes but she could not help me. I had to go back to work.\nEverybody has to work and I had to go to the field again. There I fell asleep and I had some\npotatoes already prepared to take home and somebody that checked on me told them about\nme. That would be 5 or 10 years again for doing that. She got me out of it...got me out it, and\nI left that hospital. And I did not work. I went on the black market again. But there was a\nbookkeeper that gave me at that time what I had to come for that work and she was a Jewish\nwoman from Kiev. Her husband was...uh...State Attorney in Kiev and he was sentenced for\n10 years by Stalin as not reliable. And she had a daughter living with her 8 or 9 years and\nnever heard from her husband again. We became friendly. I visited her. So what I got more\nfrom her was an onion or a garlic and a little bit more bread and we had talks. In the\nmeantime, I had company with that Mr. Becker who became after then the conservative\nrabbi of Memphis that gave me the...the money...that gave me the money. I met him at\nservices. He made a Minyan in 1944 in September at Sara's place because she had an extra\nroom. Now he prayed the Musaf service and I pray...I prayed the Shofer service. And at that\nplace we were four people, all foreign Jews but one. It was a Russian Jews. He was...name\nwas Matowich. He was in his high 70s. He fled Ukraine, and he had a prayer book. Didn't\ntake anything this prayer book, the Moosberg. And from that we prayed and all the other\nsaid, yes...yes...harman or. When he heard me pray...Becker, he decided he wants to be more\nfriendly to me, wants to know about me. He was afraid of anybody because he\nwas...uh...every 3 months checked if he can go to the front line again because he came from\nRovno which not far away from Limburg and there they took him into the army and they\nretreated and you know where he __ in 14 days the Germans were before Moscow. And all\nof those people there that army, they're taken to camps. Not concentration camps, but not\ntransports. And every 3 months he was checked for his health and he played the crazy one.\nSo he could not tell me and he didn't have the con...I could be linked up with their men. He\ndid not know. But then he got confidence in me. He told me that has _____ from the Yeshiva\nin ___, and he was writing for The Moment in Warsaw and was a friend of Begin. Begin was\nretired the Youth Movment, and he wrote for The Moment __ articles. Now, he doesn't\nknow about his family anymore and that was it. He is here. He became so friendly I told,\n\"Why do you read the Russian paper. Learn English. One nice day we will be in Western\nEurope, the Western Hemisphere, and English will be it and not Russia.\u201d So the girl where I\nlived had a book, an English book, was a first 2 years used. And we talked. I forgot to tell\nyou that a man...man by the name of Smiger, a photographer, helped me more than anybody\nelse. The butcher told me, \"Go to Smiger. Tell him who you are. I told him already that you\nare here.\u201d And he gave me, of course, something to eat. Bread and butter, and some\nfruit...fruit, had some fruit. He had...he was a photographer because, as I'd mentioned before,\nanybody after the age of 12 has to have a passport. So he was making these pictures for\npassports and had to give him for 5 rubles. But then...when you wanted more pictures, you\nhad to give 50 or a hundred rubles and there where he has the money. Here he got money for\nmore pictures or he got a piece of chicken or a piece of ___, or a piece of bread. I helped\nSmiger developing the pictures. So he set me up with an elderly woman that was on the\nblack market and she had a room...an apartment...a room, and there I slept on the floor. It\nwas summertime so it was not so bad. Then came, as I mentioned before, Rosh Hashanah\nand we prayed there and the next year...the whole year, there was a war over in May, but we\ndid not know anything what to do and when we will be repatriated. So one nice day, Becker,\nwho was not...not ____...he was from the Army. He was _____.. They were all, as we say,\n________. They could...he said to...to Sara...she was...she was in addition, she was a\ndressmaker, and she made all the dresses for the ___ women. So he told her, I got the\npuputska. That means the so-called passport to go home to Rovno to see where my parents\nare. But there is room. - which will never get out of here. Can you see that the man there...we\nare a friend...write your name. There's room for both of us that we go on the same trip with\nher. She listened. The next day we came and she said, \"You did me a very bad service. They\nwanted almost to kill me. To take someone with paragaraph 58 they had you...his papers,\nyour papers there and...uh...want to smuggle him out from here?\" So that was it. That was\nOctober 1945. And we said goodbye, but we made out he's going over Moscow and in case\nhe can find out if I go, then he will let me...with one word, give me a cable,___\u2014_. That\nmeans okay. And that will mean that I go. Uh...He asked him...that was Gomulka. You heard\nabout Gomulka? He was after then the main chief in the new government. He was the\nSecretary. He was in Moscow waiting for the...for the creation of the new Polish Posusky\narmy against the London army _____ army.

And\nwhen...when...when Becker said to me, \"Come on with me. What do you have to lose?\" I\nsaid, \"Aw, what shall I sit down there.\u201d He said, \"You know piece of choc you get and a\npiece of sugar.\u201d So I went. I went with him two or three times. And you had to fill out your\nname like he told me, \"Here sign.\u201d And I signed my name. So when he asked Becker in\nMoscow...Gomulko asked him, \"What did he do for Poland? Who is he?\" So he gave him\nthe name and do you know they had the register of everybody who came to the meetings.\nWhen he saw that I came three times, two or three times to the meeting he said to him, \"He\nwill go.\u201d And I got the letter ____. I was very happy.",
        "A: That means...not everybody was repatriated. I was sent not as a Pole. I was sent as a German.\nThen to them I was a German. And only Polish people were repatriated. So...but we\nexplained to him that my parents were born in Poland and I am not a German. I am a Jew.\nAnd when he saw that I was to these meetings, he said, \"He will go. I put him on the list.\"",
        "A: Gomulka himself but him on the list. That what he told me that he will say I wasn't there.\nThat was somewhere November of 45. I went on with my life. Black market. I lived with\nSmiger. His wife went home to Leningrad, and he let me in..in a place to sleep on the side\nthere.

But otherwise she knows only from the holy writings that we killed Jesus. But\nthese are Jews? She doesn't want us to go. She wants us to say. For me, she had her sister.\nWell, we listened.

That's ___\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014. ~ And he wrote me a little card, and the card came where he\nis....to not to lose him where he is and what I do? So I answered him that I'm still here and I\ndidn't get my...didn't get my card. After 2 or 3 months he didn't get it, but I'm still here. It's\ncensored and then they don't...don't...didn't give it. His was different. So I went on with my\nblack marketing to have butter and bread and a even a piece of meat. I didn't care. Then I\nwent to Keof. Keof was the capital of that State, ____. And before Becker left, he got me\na coat, a military coat and a cap. When I had that on, nobody bothered me. I went with a\ncane, they were saying he 1s bobby, police from the army. So I went into that train to buy\nnewspaper because newspaper and matches were a black market item. And then I went to the\noffice of the Polish...uh...government that was installed there for repatriating. And I went up\nthere. There was a Jewish girl from Galicia, and...uh...I told her my story and she went back\nand she said, \"You are on the list. You will go.\u201d And she made me the man that takes back\nfor all the people, leather goods. I mean...things that you...they have no value but what they\ncountry had that they gave them. They should prepare themselves that 1n...uh ...uh...April or\nMay, when it gets warmer, we will go. It's the last transport because the big transport went\nalready and during these strong winter months, they stopped it because they wouldn't survive\nunder the circumstances and it took too long and I called up one day again, and she told me,\n\"Good, go up to the ___ and tell him for next week to have a car, you know, animal car for\nyou to come to Keof to join in that transport. When I came home with the goods that she\ngave me...and somebody helped me to carry it. I couldn't carry it. At the station Koternish,\nthe _______ was there. And it was already dark, and they lit up there things there and to see\nwho I am. They see so much goods in private hands. They took me to the police and there\nthey kept me from 6 or 7 o'clock til 12 o'clock night and there were a lot of people there they\ngot from the street and they started to open up and everybody wanted to take something. I\nwarned them this is this and this, for those and those people and I'm not responsible. When I\ngave the address of the office, the office had no telephone. The office was closed, and then\nthey sent a man on a bicycle to her apartment. And she confirmed that this is from her and I\ngot two policemen that brought me home where I lived and I distributed all those things the\nnext day. I who talked the worse Prussian was made as a leader of 30 or 40 people...I don't\nremember. When I came to the ______, to tell him I need the car, and to stamp the ___, they\ntold me, \"The car will be there.\u201d\u2019 But it wasn't. So I called her and complained and afternoon\nthere was...1t was there. And we went away. Of course, a few friends that I made cried,\nespecially the bookkeeper that was in charge there of the hospital. She came out to see me\noff. Uh...Her brother...the landlady's brother there where Smiger and I lived...uh...told me\nthat...uh...why I don't stay? They will me a...uh...home and his daughter is not married. She\nwas a teacher and a sergeant in the army. Very good looking and healthy, you know. And I\ndid not know that she took an eye on me because she passed there. I...I did live in the room\nand she passed there and saw me. But during that time, there was a law given out that\nanybody that is...that care...has a right to be repatriated when he is married from wherever\nshe comes, she can go with. So there was a young lady. I can say really a lady. Her husband\nwas the transport minister in Estonia. And her father was a banker. And they were taken the\nfirst day when the Russians came in and they never saw them again, and her mother and\nherself and several children, they sent to Kotenish. When she heard that I speak\nGerman...you know, these Lithuanian, Estonia, and Latvia, there...uh...the language was\nGerman. And she made my acquaintance and she told me that she has a lot of money in\nbanks in Western Europe. If I take her out and get married to her, either we stay married if I\nwant; otherwise...but she will help me with a lot in business as a businessman. So, of course,\nI denied it. I didn't want to go into ____ perform a marriage. But was I myself considered\nmyself very..very weakly patriation man.. I was always a question...question mark if I go\nback not to connect myself with another dark person. I can endanger and I don't come out\nagain. So I told her I cannot do it. Finally, when we came to Keof, very happy I have my\npaper with me, and I have some rubles from the black market and I went to buy some\ncigarettes on the market and other things, and my paper was stolen. I got so frightened and I\nwent to that woman from the office there. Said, \"Your fault. You will stay here. What you\nthink? I can make paper for you? Why do you go on the black market? Aren't you glad to get\nout from here?\" And shouted at me and all that. So I was told have to go to the office where\nthey lose and find and that was closed and after 4 o'clock it opened, and she didn't have\nanything and I had to bring...uh...uh...uh ...uh...little piece of paper that I was there. If she had\nno paper, so I went without the paper and I went back to her. Broken! Heart broken! 6\no'clock. And this is not just here, and there's a taxi or anything. All or a piece of bread. When\nyou have to you have to. So she told me, \"I'll tell you what. I go with you night to the __.\nMaybe they give you another paper.\u201d I just called them and told them about. She said, \"Let\nme see. Come over. I don't promise you anything.\u201d So night at 10 I met her, and we went\nover there. And I was sitting on the stairs of the ___, outside. Told me to come in. Took a\nlook. But she told me before to make pictures again, but the office was closed...the picture\nstores were closed, so I got on the black market a picture. I have still this little picture at\nhome. One...one of them. I paid a good price for it, and I got 4, 5 little pictures and I was\nafraid the passport will not accept it, will not be the right picture. Somehow, midnight I was\ncalled in. I gave him the picture and I was told to wait outside and in an hour I had a new\npaper with the picture on. I thanked her and I made my way and I hitchhiked to the station.\nThat was far away. So I was on one...on one car and then he set me off. He cannot go farther.\nAnd I got the second one and the third one. I arrived at the station 5 o'clock in the morning\nand I didn't see the car where we were in the train where we were in. So I met somebody that\nI was knowing from the train. He said, \"They changed...the last two days overnight on\nanother...another...another line.\u201d\u201d When I came there most of the people had given money.\nJewish people. When I come back, they said I will not get out from here. It can take a year or\nnot...never, and they took all money together and gave it to me. So I did not accept it. I said,\n\"I have papers.\u201d A day later I didn't go out anymore. I stayed in the car. Didn't even go out.\nThe next day we moved, and it took quite some time to get to the Polish border. I think 14\ndays or something like that. I arrived in July...in July. We left...left in June...beginning of\nJune. I arrived in July. Uh...There at the Polish border I went...the first station they let us out.\nWe wanted Bicksley, was Bresleytos. And I remember from my school years during the war\nthat Hindenberg made the first peace with the Russians in Bresleytos. And I was curious to\nknow how Bresleytos looked because there was ____. It was very famous. And I went to\nthe...to the marketplace, and there I saw women with the _____as their hair...head gear, all\naround with the scarf and they had rings and they had watches. You could buy everything if\nyou had money. So I said, \"Where did you get it all from?\" \"Oh, from the Jews.\u201d You know,\n____ Jews anymore. I said...when I asked him if see anywhere a synagogue. Synagogue? All\nburned.\u201d So with a heavy heart... didn't look at the watches. I didn't look at what has\nhappened. I went back to the train and about a few hours later we were at the Polish border.\nThe Polish border was already an officer...Polish officer standing and he called out, \"Who 1s\nCatholic in this train?\" We have for you help? I said, \"Who helps us?\" He said, \"The Joint\nin German, not here.\u201d What do you say to that? So we went on and in that train I made again\nthe acquaintance of a man who was from Poland and he went there by ____., by free will and\nhis two sons were in the Polish army and were officers even the army now. And he married.\nHe was a widower and he married another young woman with a child and he took her\nwith...one of these marriages to take out from Russia. When we arrived in Breslow,\nnow, well I as knowing Breslow, I was several times there during my youth time. There was\na famous...uh...rabbinical college, ___, interpreter of our thing. Uh...The policeman didn't\nlet us out. Let him out with his wife and child because the son was waiting for him and the\nofficer...uh...dressed in a Polish officer. So I went down nevertheless and I told him that I\nwas born in Germany. All I wanted was get back to Germany and he should be so kind to tell\nthe policeman to let me go. I am not going into that new territory that is between Breslow,\nbetween Katowice, between Krakau and the Oder River, you know, that is now Polish. And\nthere they want us to settle. The apartments were empty. Furniture was there. Everything!\nThe people they pushed out. When I came to Breslow he took us in...into his apartment, not\napartment. Had a big balcony. That balcony he let us live. He said, \"When you want to go to\nthe washroom you can come in. Otherwise you cannot come in. If you come in, then I have\nto tell you to go.\u201d That was a Friday afternoon some day in July.",
        "A: The son of that man that married the Jewish woman. He had two sons in the Polish army. He\nlived very nice. Half of the house was ruined but there was still some apartments in tact. It\nwas in the nicest neighborhood of Breslow. I was in that...in that train of the 30 of us or even\n40, but I was the manager of the 30...was a young man. He was learned Yeshiva, and he was\ngoing back. And the man by the Ginselman. Ginselman lived in Kotenish and he had always\na big ___. And he didn't...didn't associate himself with...uh...the Jews. In the train when he\nwas already on the way back to Poland, he said he is Jewish? I said, \"What do you have the\ncross on?\" And he explained it. They let him live. He worked. They let him live. So the\nYeshiva ___, and Ginselman and I were the three people that went in Breslow up on that\nbalcony. We prayed for each other that these are two people they let them come with me.\nAnd the other one said,\"____\u2014_\u2014.\u201d Let me...as always Jews...Jews are...and he said, \"Yes.\u201d\nThat Friday evening we decided...we had bread, and the Yeshiva __ had honey. How he\nhad it I don't know. And we ate honey and bread and we felt great. And not...not the one time\ndid they come out to ask us how we are, and only they watched us that we don't go farther\nthan the outside there to the washroom. Inside the apartment, but outside of the balcony.\nGinselman was not religious and he decided he's going to look on Sabbath morning what's\ngoing on in Breslow. What do we need him, he said. And the two of us said, \"God had gotten\na few months freedom in a way we will not violate the Sabbath. We'll stay here till the\nSabbath is out and tomorrow morning so God will be ____.. Ginselman came back evenings\nlate. He told us there is a so-called ghetto that the Jews were...uh..were kept, but it's better\nfor them that it would seem and the people they kept there, secure because there was always\na Jewish...uh..policeman ...uh...24 hours. You couldn't get in. There was still one synagogue\nleft in the rear. They didn't burn it because it was between buildings...an old, little synagogue\nand...uh...he got soup from the Joint. I never got 1t. When I came it was already out. I have\nnot quite such a good heart from that help to tell you the truth. Tell you later about it.\nAnd...uh...on the marketplace, we met a man that wasn't looking quite normal. And he had\nan apartment in a poor workers' neighborhood. He was..uh..repatriated too. He was...and his\nwife and he had two children. And he had a room where we could sleep. He said, \"You can\nsleep.\u201d He had two beds. Aw, come to get, but not on the streets, like in Russia. So we took\nit. But before I went to sleep, I went to the marketplace. What did I find out and you will be\nsurprised. A man by the name of Rosenberg, who was born in Poland, as a child came to\nHomburg. We went together to school, and he went to Russia by free will and his mother\nand his sister. He said to me, \"Max, you are born in Germany. You have a good chance to\nget out of here. I wish I had your birth certificate.\u201d I said, \"I have no birth certificate. I have\nno papers. The paper I had was paragraph 58 and I threw it away that nobody should even\nknow. So what should I do? I remembered I lived in Katowice. And when you live in Poland\nor in Germany, within 24 hours you have to go to the office to register. It's not the United\nStates. So I said, \"I will get an ____ certification that I was born in Germany.\u201d Because I\nwent up to the man of the Jewish community...he was a German Jew and he told me, \"You\nhave to bring papers.\u201d I said so and so. He said, \"I cannot do anything for you unless you\nhave a birth certificate. And my birth certificate was in the French zone. Essen on the Ruhr\n____. So I did not know what to do. So Rosenberg in the meantime introduced me to a\nwoman who had a ticket, a seat, number 64 in that train to go to Germany. She was a\nGerman Jewess from Breslow and she has a right to go. She has the papers. Elderly woman.\nShe said she would like to go later. She needs money. She needs something to buy to eat.\nAnd I had from the black market a suit. You wouldn't put on today, but it was a suit. I sold it\nfor six thousand...six thousand slota on the black market. I did this when I came back with\nthe papers...with the papers already. How did I get my papers? The afternoon I took a train\nfrom Breslow to Katowice. It was quite...uh...all night and it was Saturday, Friday evening\nwhen I arrived. Friday evening I had the card from Becker that he 1s in a kibbutz and I was\nknowing the address. I was knowing Katowice because I did business there. And I went to\nthat kibbutz. Oh, was he surprised to see me. And I got a good dinner. Chicken and the\ntraditional Jewish Friday evening dinner. And how did I sleep? We slept...they slept all over\nthe floor, but clean in___. So I said...they had no room, so the other one said, \"We'll push\ntogether. One...one Jew more. Oh...let him sleep there.\u201d But when they saw I had no ____.\nYou know what ___ 1s? I have it at home. My wife told me to take it with me. I'll give it to\nyou tonight. Uh...uh...they didn't want me to sleep without it. So I got it...she washed it last\nweek. I was looking for something else for my brother. Didn't find it, and I found that. And I\ngot the ____ which I will give you and...uh...slept the night. In the morning I had to wait for\nservices, and then they honored me in lifting the Torah and I didn't do it the proper way\nbecause you should turn around at least three chapters...have to show the...the community. I\nwas not there for that. I was for the paper to get out from here. And they closed at 12 o'clock\nso I made...I got out. I didn't wait for kiddish. I got out and they were very polite. I gave\nthem 200 slota, and I got a paper this and this born, there and there, lived here from that and\nthat time. He's the son of that and that, and he came from Germany that and that day. It was\nSaturday. Took me a whole day to go back. Saturday afternoon that I took the train back. It\nwas not yet night. It was dangerous for Jews on the street. It was 1946. Two young man said,\n\"He didn't kill them all. There's another one.\u201d And I went among...mingled among the\npeople. Had no...no luggage. I stood all night. The train was crowded. Had to stay...stand all\nnight, and I arrived the next morning and I went with my paper and I was looking for the\nwoman that wanted to sell me for 200 or three thousand dollars there the seat, and I found\nher and she got the 3...I sold the suit, and I gave her 3 thousand slota, and the other 3\nthousand slota I used for food to keep me over until I get somewhere where I get something\nto eat. He didn't want. He said, \"Why should this poor woman not stay here, and give it to\nyou. Give her the seat.\u201d The man from the ___ that was in charge of letting people go. And\non the other hand, \"This is not a birth certificate.\u201d I said, \"You make me ____.\u201d\u201d This tells\nyou I was from Germany and I speak to you in German. I speak to you...let me to say\ntoday...in English it has a German accent, but my German had no accent. You could see\nimmediately from where I come and I gave you the paper and the picture to it. Finally, he\nagreed and Monday morning I was on my way. I quickly bought bread and something to eat\nand...uh... I must tell you it was salted bacon. We couldn't have anything else. And before I\nwent into the train, three quarter of the bacon was taken away by the Polish checkpoint, and\nthe bread I... could keep, and I went into the train and I was one Jew among...among all\nGermans who was...were pushed out from that territory to make room for the Poles to take it\nover. Today, they don't think that way with Israel. They make it the point not there. Not\nthere! Because this is not given to you. But they...they did it at that time. I arrived at the...in\nthe zone in the Amer...in the Russian zone in Berlin. A German nurse was there. Blonde, and\nof course, friendly, and I told the English man, \"I don't want her to serve me. I don't want\nthat.\u201d And he insisted, \"She is here in charge, and you will have to.\u201d First of all, papers...1\ngave you the papers. Okay. \"You are one of them,\" he said, \"Yal.\u201d I said, \"I don't want any\nGermans. I heard what they did, and what they did to me.\u201d So I was deloused with DDT,\nwhich is today forbidden as you know. And I felt after that so fine, so relieved. Never had\nany lice anymore. Waiting on the other side, we decided to go to the English zone. There\nwere 5, 6, 7 people, quite intelligent Polish Jews. Not those three Jews that talk only Yiddish,\nbut educated with degrees and they were so glad to find a German. Somebody that speaks\nGerman that they...they will make no trouble. Said, \"You will speak Polish and I will speak\nGerman.\u201d So we went to the English zone, and there they gave us..they gave us a place...\nuh...if it wouldn't be summer, 1t would be very bad. It was the dancing hall of a hotel. And\nthere we got our things and we laid down and then we went for ticket to get food. As we\nwere refugees, they gave us double rations. Germans _____ double ration. The double ration\nwas not enough either. We put it together and the women started to cook.",
        "A: Stop, and I have to go to the washroom.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: To make it short, as soon as I came to...to Germany, I went from the English zone to the\nAmerican zone and that was the place where I was treated first as a humanbeing. Uh...I had\nto decide what to do. To wait to go to Palestine, to go to Cyrprus and not to Palestine so\nwhen I got a letter from my cousin of mine that lived in originally in Televiv but went\nafterward to Yonkers, New York, Dr. , Dr. Fred...Fred ____ and he told me I should come to\nthe United States. And he sent me immediately papers which I did not need because I had the\nright as a displaced person to go without papers if I had the quota. And the quota I had most\nof the people had to wait 10 to 12 years, and as I was in the German quarter, that start be\ngood for me to be from Germany. I waited only 4 months, and in 4 months I was on my way\nto the United States. I arrived here 2nd of October, 1947, and then to friends in New\nYork...uh...I was sent on a position to Chicago and that why I'm living...living today in\nChicago.",
        "A: Well, when I have sometimes days when I am not very happy then I go back and I say it\ncould have very much worse. Look where I got out from. I get from this out too. It...uh...I\nhave no after affects. The only after affect is the way my mother, my sister, my nephew,\nniece were killed and how they...uh...took the health from my brother away that he died\nearlier than it was necessary. Otherwise, I...uh...survived with the hope that we will have\nhealthy State in Israel and...uh...I am busy with metals that concern Israel.",
        "A: My brother...my brother very seldom wanted to talk about it because 1t was hurting him so\nmuch. He was an eye witness how our closest were killed. Uh...He was a doctor and...uh... he\nhad to flee Krakau where he was practicing ...uh...medicine when the war broke out in 1939,\nand he came to Kolomier, where he was born. He was the oldest. And...uh..he...he\ndescribed...he never wanted to talk about it but when he passed away among his...uh...papers,\nI found a letter reporting what has happened to the family and then... then one nice day,\nwhen he 1s not anymore here maybe I will have it and I will be the one that has to not let the\nworld forget what has happened to us during the HItler time. In the beginning when the\nGermans came in, after the Russians left, was occupied by the Russians, they...uh...took\nmy... my sister's apartment away. Uh...They...uh...they had to go to the ghetto\nand...uh...everything...everything was...uh... uh...taken...taken away. Uh...They were left just\nwith what they could carry in their hand. And only one person, as my brother worked for the\nGermans in the hospital for infectious diseases, the Germans didn't want to put one of their\ndoctors in for the danger, so they left there for the time being a Jew doing that work. So he\nhad the right to live outside of the ghetto, and one person with him who would take care of\nthe things in case he isn't there. So once my mother used to be there or my sister. They came\nout in order to have a bigger piece of bread because it wasn't even allowed to put a piece of\nbread into the...into the ghetto. And...uh...he smuggled always a piece of bread in and he\ncould risk his life that could be shot for that. But so once my mother had something to eat.\nOnce my mother had a little more...more bread. And the children, it had to be smuggled in.\nThen it didn't take very long and my sister was taken away under the...under the...that she\nwill be....uh...uh...how do they call? Resettled. And never came back. She was taken to\nBelzec. Then one nice day, the 2nd of February, 1943, my sister was taken away\nOshamaraba, 1942. And then...the 2nd of February of...of 1943...uh... my mother was taken\nout with the last 2,000 taken to Sheparowitz not far away from Kolomier, II kilometers as far\nas I know and there were already graves, mass graves prepared and she was shot and killed\nthere. When my brother came back evenings to this apartment where he had his so-called\npractice, Ukrainians were at the door and laughed him in his face. What? That's your\napartment? You must dream. He had night service and he came in the morning. And so they\nturned him back. Few days later he heard that he should be replaced by a Polish woman\ndoctor, should be finished up because there were only 4, 3 or 4 left of them in the whole city.\nDuring the Russian occupation, he helped a Polish woman...uh...professor of a\ngymnasium...uh... She...her father was a rich man. Had a lot of land, and her brother was a\npriest. They were taken and never heard of them when the Russians came. And she was...got\nout of that village in order to find work so that she wouldn't be taken without work into\ncaptivity. And she came to him without knowing him, and he was the manager of the\nhospital under the Russians before the Germans came in, and cried before him what should\nshe do? So he asked her, \"Can you be a cook? We need a cook.\u201d And she start to be the cook\nfor the hospital. She never forgot that. When the Germans came, she...uh...made...in her...in\nher apartment, they're living Italian officers. One was a doctor with the same specialty, Dr.\nRugoni, and she told him about my brother, that she heard that he is going to be replaced. So\nhe told her, \"Let him come to me.\u201d And that same day, afternoon, he took all his things off\nfrom him, and went to the Italian...uh... to the Italian soldier, to the barracks of the Italians,\nand there he was hiding him and they...their conversation was in Latin...whatever was\nnecessary. And he said he should not talk and he should make he cannot speak, that he was\nfor Stalingrad. He will say he was Stalingrad, and came out numb and dumb. Cannot hear,\ncannot talk, because he didn't talk Italian. Smuggled him into Italy and he worked for him in\nKosavecura, the doctor _____. And from there, he started to look for me and I start look\nfor him and through cousins in Israel, we were reunited in 1951. My brother had trouble with\nthe American doctors. They said, \"He probably has tuberculosis,\" and they kept him for 1\nyear back, and he was not on the German quota so I came in 1947. He came in June 51 to\nthe...to...to Chicago. So we were reunited. He lived with me for 20 years. He wouldn't get\nmarried because of circumstances and...uh...and he...1t took him 7 years again in Chicago to\nget a license. He had to go all everything through and internship which we went through\nand...uh...he practiced for 10 years medicine in Chicago until...then he was retired for 1 and a\nhalf or 2 years and...uh...he had a heart condition, but that didn't kill him. But he got cancer\nof the colon and he passed away in 1971, at the age of 73. And...uh...more details about it...it\nis in his..uh...document left to me...uh...about his...how he survived and how the\ncircumstances how my family lived the last few months and...uh...",
        "A: Hmmm?",
        "A: Yal. This is...uh...this is all I...all I have to tell you about my brother in short.",
        "A: The picture. The other things.",
        "A: This picture was taken in 1917 during the first world war. My brother got furlough after\nbeing for quite sometime as a front line, and surprised us for 14 days to be with us. My\nmother here on the picture was killed in February 1943. My sister and her children, husband\nwere killed in 1942 somewhere in October. And...uh...the only survivor today as the picture\nis Shown to you here am I.\nThen my brother left Kolomier or was smuggled out by the Italian officer. This what I have\nin my hands is the only one thing he had with him and what he had on.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Do I have to start again?",
        "A: This is the only one thing that my brother took with him when he was smuggled out from\nKolomier to Italy by the Italian officer and doctor. It is the medical bag that he used to treat\nthe patients in the German hospital.\nAt the Hebrew University, I met a professor by the name of Docnoyee.",
        "A: The picture you see here is by the Germans that ruled Kolomier during the German\noccupation and caused all these trouble and killings of Jews. This was given to me by\nProfessor Docnoyee from the Hebrew University who was born in Kolomier like my parents.\nThat's it. That's it.\n"
