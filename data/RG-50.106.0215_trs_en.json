        "A: No, they were reform Jewish. It is interesting. My father and mother considered themselves\nGermans. Their religion was Jewish, reform Jewish. But it was not an ethnic thing for them to\nbe Jewish. They were reform Jewish and I was bar mitzvah in 1937, a year before. And as a\nmatter of fact, I had a high soprano voice at that time. My mother was interested in that. And I\ndid the whole service in, and sang it.",

        "Q: What kind of neighborhood did you live in? Was it Jewish and non-Jewish?",
        "A: No, we lived in Aschaffenberger as I said, one block from Rathaus Aschaffenberger on the, in\nthe Bayerischer Firkel [ph] which was an sort of upper middle class area where you know we\nwere in a nice apartment. We had a large apartment which still exists. The building still exists.\nAnd we lived one block from Bayerischer Platz which was one of the squares of that area and\nwhere the Ubahn was, had a stop. And it was a very nice part of \u2014",
        "Q: Jewish and non-Jewish neighbors.",

        "Q: You did not know the people who lived in the building?",
        "A: Barely. No. We didn\u2019t. Actually, actually our, we had a fairly large apartment which in part\nwas my father\u2019s office. He had his office in front and then we had a fairly large apartment in the\nback. My relatives, my close relatives, uncles and aunts lived in the neighborhood within about a\nmile. They all lived in that particular area. My grandparents also.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 8",
        "Q: What about your school friends. Were they Jewish or non-Jewish?",
        "A: I really didn\u2019t have many school friends in either, I mean that I remember. I had a friend who\nlived in the same building, apartment building who was the son I think of the janitor. And we\nwere friends. We were close friends, but other than that I really had no German -- I don\u2019t\nremember having close school friends or other friends at all. Either in grade school or in high\nschool. It was in Hohenzollern gymnasium which was very close to where we lived on Martin\nLuther Strasse. And so I just really don\u2019t remember very much about my \u2014",
        "Q: What did you do after school? Were you interested in sports? Did you have any hobbies?",
        "A: I was at my gymnasium, I was interested in sports. That was swimming and track which I\nparticipated in. I was never very good at it. No, I had what you call letters in it and so forth. But\nthe one thing that I remember very, very closely is right across the street from us lived our\nphysical ed teacher who was an officer in the SS, who took to me. I was the best marcher. You\nknow when we marched and I also was the best saluter. And he was a very friendly to me. He\nlived right across the street. And every once in a while he wore his SS uniform. But I had\nabsolutely no fear or any kind of, other than that he was one of my teachers and he was friendly\nwith me. And I really didn\u2019t feel any kind of persecution or otherwise until I was told that you\nhad to leave the Hohenzollern gymnasium. And I was very disappointed because it was a very\ngood gymnasium. It was close to where we lived. And I had to go to the Jewish gymnasium, way\nacross town and I bicycled. But this was a really relatively short time.\nWhat happened was after my father died in 1936, my mother took over his business. We\nlived happily in Berlin. In 1937 her first cousin who lived, from Kansas City. They came to\nEurope. They didn\u2019t come to Germany. They met in Marienbad in Czechoslovakia. My mother\nwent down. She didn\u2019t take me along and I really don\u2019t know why because she sent me off to\ncamp. And they met in Marienbad in 1937. It was her first cousin. Interestingly about her first\ncousin who emigrated to the United States before World War I as a young person. He had\nworked for my grandfather and somehow he had gotten into financial trouble. So my\nerandfather said get out of here. I\u2019ll pay you to go to the United States and sent him abroad in\norder to keep him out of trouble. He never forgot that what my grandfather had done for him.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 9\nAnd therefore, they came to Germany, to Marienbad to Czechoslovakia. And met. It was sort of\na family reunion. He and his wife and their son Jeff who was my second cousin came to\nMarienbad.\nAnd they made the decision that the following year I was to go to Kansas City for one\nyear and my cousin Jeff was to come and stay with my mother for a year. Sort of be a family\nexchange. It developed during that following year he wasn\u2019t going to come but I was going to\ngo for good. And I had an affidavit and I had a visa. My mother did not yet. She had, she had an\naffidavit from her cousin but she didn\u2019t have a visa yet. It hadn\u2019t come up yet. So I went by\nmyself in 1938. She took me to Hamburg and put me onto the Manhattan ship and I went off as a\n14 year old to New York.\nYeah, but going back to Berlin.",
        "Q: Stay with Berlin.",
        "A: That so I really I should say something else about Berlin. I am sure that if my father had lived\nwe would have all succumbed in the Holocaust because he felt he wasn\u2019t German. He had served\nin World War I. He had an Iron Cross, actually an Iron Cross that was bestowed belatedly by\nHitler. So he was, this was never going to happen to us. We would have never left Berlin and we\nwould have all succumbed if he had not passed away. So this is one of the, my personal history\nthat I feel that the only way that we really survived is because he had passed away at an early\nage.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s now talk about you as a child in Germany. Did you experience any anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Only on one occasion and it was not really anti-Semitism. It was the week before I left. My\nmother had purchased for me a pair of long trousers, knowing that in the United States young\nboys wore knickers but also long trousers. And I had them on, was right across the street from\nwhere we lived and where I was accosted by four or five young boys who didn\u2019t like what I was\nwearing. Whether I was Jewish or not I have no idea. And they beat me up. And I came home\nand my mother, in her usual way, said this did you good so you had this experience of being beat\nup so you know what will happen to you if you know, things like this.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 10\nAnd that was the only occasion that I personally felt it was, that I had any kind of bad\nexperience in this. So I really never personally experienced the awful things that happened in\nGermany vis a vis the Jews.",
        "Q: When did you first start hearing about a man named Hitler? Do you remember your first\nimpression?",
        "A: Oh I think it was quite, I mean I was \u2014",
        "Q: In 1933 you were nine.",
        "A: Iremember my father being a veteran and Hindenburg was a former general. And a marshal.\nAnd he was a political father figure forme. Hindenburg was. Hitler came aboard and I certainly\nwas conscious about him. I don\u2019t remember that there were any things. Sorry. I don\u2019t remember\nthat there were any things that happened to us personally because in any way. I heard about him\npretty early but it was one of those things that my father said this doesn\u2019t concern us. We\u2019re\nGermans. He\u2019s not an important figure. Of course and actually his, while he was alive, his\nbusiness was fine. I mean he had no problems at all. This was 19, between 1933 and 1936. He\ndied in 1936. So I really had no bad experiences. Kristallnacht came two weeks after I left\nGermany. And there is a little story about that.\nBut so anyway \u2014",
        "Q: What about boycotts or book burnings, anything like that. You were not aware, is that what\nyou\u2019re saying.",
        "A: I was not aware, no not at all. I really was, I was not aware of the problems and the dangers\nthat came \u2014",

They were still there when my father died.\nMy mother\u2019s younger brother, actually in 1936, my mother\u2019s younger brother died of what 1s\nknown as hepatitis. He was 34 years old. She lost -- her father died in 1936. They all died my\nfather, grandfather and uncle all died in one year. And her older brother who was a physician\nwas the hardest hit by this because he lost his father, his brother and his, and his brother in law\nall in one year. And that I remember, very hard. And they all departed at the time when I left.\nMy mother was the only one who was left by herself. And what happened on Kristallnacht\nwhich was after, two weeks after I left. I didn\u2019t learn about this til oh about, ten, 15 years ago.\nShe never talked about it. She never told me, but when Kristallnacht came she had a large\napartment, she was a widow living by herself. Six of her cousins and relatives came to her and\nshe put them up in the apartment. And I heard about this only after she died. She never told me,\nfrom the cousins.\nOh she put us, actually not from the cousins, from their children. She put us up, she put\nus up for two weeks and we stayed in the apartment.",
        "Q: What was your reaction as a young boy seeing German soldiers and the swastika? Did it\nelicit any response?",
        "A: None, except I liked parades. I liked, I mean German soldiers. My father was a soldier in\nWorld War II. I found, attracted to military displays. The fact that there was a swastika and that\nyou did Heil Hitler, really was not particularly, did not impress me. I was a child.",
        "Q: I\u2019m trying to get what a child\u2019s reaction 1s to that?",
        "A: I was not, I was more impressed by military precision and military parades as a young boy\nand I was very interested in sports and the fact that German, especially in track and field. You\nknow they were very good at it and I was very interested in Foosball. in soccer and I had a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 12\nfavorite team which still exists and is doing pretty well this year.

My grandmother left with one of her \u2014 and went\nto Israel with a son and daughter, with her doctor. And his wife. They had one son born by that\ntime. And no, they all departed happily. My father\u2019s older brother was in America from 1933, 34\non. He was. And he was sort of an operator type and he was always doing very well but not\nreally doing very well. And he was in the United States much earlier. And then of course my\nmother\u2019s cousins in Kansas City with whom she was close. And he, I didn\u2019t realize this til much\nlater.

        "Q: On the Manhattan. And number one did you speak any English?",
        "A: Very little. I had had a few lessons when my mother decided that I was supposed, I was\ngoing to go. I had not had any English in school. I had Latin and French and I think she gave,\nhad me take some private lessons but I knew very little English. And as a matter of fact there is a\nfamily tale about my English knowledge. When I landed in New York, my uncle, he was actually\na cousin. My mother\u2019s first cousin but he was a generation higher. So he was uncle Julius. Uncle\nJulius. Met me at the pier. In New York and it was pretty late in the evening by the time I got off\nthe boat and he said. Are you \u2014 and he spoke German. He was the only member of my\nAmerican family who spoke German. And so he spoke German but not very well anymore.\nAre you hungry? And I said yes. And he took me to Penn Station where the Harvey\nrestaurants were open 24 hours a day. And he took me to Penn Station. He had a, my aunt in\nKansas City who was quite well to do, the family was well to do. Had a cousin in New York who\nlived in the Warwick Hotel, on 54\" and Sixth Avenue and had a limousine and a chauffeur. And\nthat limousine and chauffer came with my uncle to the pier. And we went to you know meeting\nsomeone that\u2019s just the way they live it. It was new to me. They took us to Pennsylvania Station\nand we went into the restaurant, Fred Harvey\u2019s. And there\u2019s a huge menu. And he says what\nwould you like to eat and I looked at this menu and I wanted to show off my English knowledge\nand I says I want apple pea. And apple pea became the sort of family -- Tom wants apple pea.\nSo that was my sort of introduction. Then we went by train \u2014",

Never having\nbeen to the United States. He was somewhat disreputable in his business dealings and I think he\nwas even in prison for a time. Debtors\u2019 prison or something. But he wrote about 40 books, many\nof them translated into English about the Wild West. And then he wrote another series of books\nabout 20, 25 about Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. And the books about the Wild West was\nthe bible of every young German boy. And unless you had read at least 20 of them, and they\nwere all 600 page books. You read them at night underneath your blanket with a flashlight. You\nwere, you were not accepted in your group of German \u2014 Karl May.",

        "A: M-A-Y. Karl May, yeah. And he\u2019s known in this country, he\u2019s translated, but it was one of\nthose things that Karl May was every young school boy\u2019s sort of Bible and you read about the\nWild West and the chief Indian of the Apache Indian tribe.

She was going to be my mother. I called her Aunt Helen but she treated me in\nexactly the same way as she treated her own son. There was absolutely no difference, so much\nso that she knew that I had been bar mitzvah in Germany. Her son, my cousin Jeff was going to\nbe confirmed in the reform Jewish in Kansas City. He was going to be confirmed the next spring.\nShe insisted that I would be confirmed again with him because she wanted me to have the same\nnumber of presents that he got. That I would \u2014 she treated me as her own family\u2019s son. And was\njust terrific. I was accepted you know completely into her family. She was well to do. Her father\nhad founded in St. Jo Missouri a company which moved to Kansas City. I think right after World\nWar I of cigars and pipes wholesale. And my uncle, my cousin was the executive vice president\nof that company and was that until he died. And my cousin Jeff took it over and finally, I mean\nsold it.

        "Q: What kind of correspondence did you have with your mother?",
        "A: I wrote to her every week and she saved the letters. As a matter of fact, I wrote to my mother\nthrough my service, until she came to the United States.

And I took out the photos and things like that. And I got rid of them. But I\nwrote to her and she wrote to me. She could not get out of Germany because she did not have a\nvisa until March 1940. After the war started. She got a visa to go to the Philippines while she\nwaited for \u2014 she had an affidavit but she didn\u2019t have a visa. So in March 1940 she went to the\nPhilippines by boat from Genoa.\nAnd spent a year in the Philippines where her younger brother and his wife were also\nalready waiting for a visa to the United States. So they were together and her younger brother\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 21\nand his wife had a child. No, no I\u2019m sorry.

        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: It was very interesting. I mean in retrospect. I was not, I was by that time an American.\nLiving with my American family and I was thoroughly Americanized language wise. I only\nspoke English. I would not speak German to my mother because you are in the United States.\nNow you learn English. And she did and the curious thing about my mother over the years, she\nspoke German with her friends. She could not speak German with me. She switched into\nEnglish when she talked to people and it\u2019s something psychological. She was never able to speak\nGerman with me. And I say mother speak German for heaven\u2019s sake. We were in the same, in\nBonn in Germany. We were in a department store and she would ask me to translate for her\nbecause she would not speak German in front of me. And it\u2019s obviously something\npsychologically but she absolutely learned German and she spoke only English. Learned English\nand she spoke only English with me. And learned English really very well. She became a\nbusinesswoman.\nShe was the credit manager of Carter and Hay meat packing company in Kansas City for\nmany, many years.",

And I, we walked into the country club\nwhere it was being held. And there were two people standing there. And one of them says Tom\nTuch, Hans Tuch. You were the kid who wouldn\u2019t speak English. And I mean this is how they\nremembered me as the kid who didn\u2019t speak English. And I was thrown into a high school. And\nit was probably the wisest decision that she ever made. Sink or swim. And I had a number of\nteachers who were very sympathetic.",

        "A: Yeah, yeah I\u2019m sure they did. I mean you know and, but I was sort of integrated into\nAmerican high school life. The interesting thing too was we lived on the Kansas side, across the\nstate line from Kansas City, Missouri. Across the state line. Just one block. There was no high\nschool in that area of Shawnee Mission Kansas. So we were permitted, Jeff and I to go across the\nstate line in Missouri, in Kansas City, go to high school. To get there, we got drivers licenses\nwhen we were 14 in Kansas so that we could go to school in, across to Southwest high school.\nAnd my cousin wasn\u2019t doing very well so he, after one year he went to private school,\nCumberland country day school.

        "Q: You move in with your mother and then you finish high school and then what?",
        "A: I was just 18 in 1942 and I started immediately after I graduated in June of 1942 at the\nUniversity of Kansas City which was then a private university and my aunt\u2019s brother in law was\nthe chairman of the board of the university. And I went there, started summer school. And I got\nin a year and three, and I went that fall and I went to night school at the same summer school\nthan winter. Because I was working in the cafeteria to earn money and I was working in the\nlibrary to earn money. And then I was working in the front office. 30 cents per hour. We, you\nknow, as a student.\nAnd I managed to enroll in night school at the same time when I was going to day school,\nwhich was not permitted. But I was able to because I was working at the registration department,\nI kept the two records separate. And so I got in a year and three quarters in one year at, of\ncollege.

        "Q: What were your thoughts about going into the American army? Were you upset or --",
        "A: No, no, no I was, I was, I didn\u2019t have a chance to volunteer. I was drafted. You know almost,\nI went in the army six months after I was 18. And I was in Camp Sibert in Alabama in chemical\nwarfare which meant you did everything in basic training with the, as the infantry does except\nwith gas masks on. You walked, jumped, ran with gas masks on. Then I guess the army decided\nthat there wasn\u2019t going to be any chemical warfare.in this war. So they closed the camp and I\nwas sent to New Orleans to be in a port battalion as a stevedore, loading and unloading ships,\narmy ships. And I was doing this and I said I\u2019ve got to get out of here.\nAnd so I applied for training, STAP, advanced specialized training program as a soldier. I\nwas a private. And I was accepted but you had to have some kind of security clearance\nand they came to me says you can\u2019t go to ASTP, you\u2019re an enemy alien. So they assigned a, my\nsergeant you know who supervised me and you know he said you will go down to New Orleans\nto the district court and you will be sworn in as a citizen. You will be made a citizen. But you\nhave to have a witness who has known you for three years to do this. And of course I knew\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 25\nnobody. My sergeant well I\u2019ve known him for three years. He\u2019s known me for three weeks. And\nwe went, he says I swear that I\u2019ve known him. I\u2019m a witness so he could get a day off that way\nand we went into the city of New Orleans and I was sworn in as an American citizen on that day.",

        "A: Yeah I was, well I mean I was able to get out of stevedoring.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what it meant.",
        "A: Exactly and I went to the University of Illinois for several months and did actually I was put\ninto a graduate program in German and I ended up with 12 hours of credit towards my bachelor\u2019s\ndegree later on. And I was there for about three months. And then I went to Camp Ritchie. That\nwas sort of my approach. My University of Illinois I went to Camp Ritchie, Maryland.",
        "Q: Now let\u2019s start talking a little bit about Camp Ritchie. Did you know what it was?",
        "A: Yes, it was the Army Intelligence school. And I was going to be an intelligence specialist.\nKnowing German and having German as my main qualification for going there. And it was a, I\nwas used to army life by that time. Camp Ritchie was different. It was a camp close to\nWashington where your training was not six days a week and one day off. It was seven days a\nweek and the eighth day off which was called ban day because the commanding general of Camp\nRitchie was a brigadier general by the name of Banfield. So you worked six, seven days and got\nthe eighth day off. And the course I think was eight weeks long.\nIt was also a sort of a peculiar camp because many of the soldiers there were privileged\nkids of senators and congressmen and people in the administration and on weekends very often,\non ban day, there were limousines coming up to take sons and daughters. There were some very\nfancy people who were soldiers there. The permanent staff at Camp Ritchie were primarily, they\nwere you know not, they were not German specialists or anything. They were not \u2014 there were a\nlot of refugee children. I mean youngsters at Camp Ritchie. And some of them were children of\nvery prominent people.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 26",
        "Q: When you say refugees, do you mean German Jewish young people?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. Because we all spoke German.",
        "Q: German was their native language.",
        "A: The previous element at Camp Ritchie was Italian speakers because they, initially there was\nplans to invade Europe through Italy. And they were training Italian speakers. And when it was\ndetermined that they were not going through Italy, they kept these youngsters, these Italian\nspeaking, as staff. And they were, became the enemy that we were trained to come to fight. They\nwere the enemy. They were all Italian speaking kids. Italian Americans.\nThe German speakers, there was a permanent staff there. And the man in charge, master\nsergeant, Manmar Hudeen [ph], a very well-known former wrestling champion was the master\nsergeant in charge of our barracks and so forth. His name was Manmar Hudeen. He was a huge\nguy and I do remember distinctly, he was a very nice person. And but his name was Manmar\nHudeen. There was the, there were some pretty well known children of well-known people. In\nthe camp.\nAnd I became, I just cannot remember him now, a well-known writer, author who later\non in late life was in East Germany. He defected to East Germany. I will be able to look it up but\nI just don\u2019t remember it now. But we were, and it was a pretty fancy kind of a camp. I mean\nbeing a private in the army in Camp Ritchie, I was very impressed. And our training consisted,\nour intelligence training, consisted of fighting the battle of Gettysburg from the intelligence point\nof view.\nAnd we were taken out at night and put on trucks and we were taken into the Gettys \u2014 we\nwere at Camp Ritchie is you know, in the Gettysburg area. And they let us out of the trucks and\nsaid find yourself back to Camp Ritchie within the next three hours. This is your compass. Well\nwe all had learned by that time from other kids, you went to the next farm, rang the door.\nFarmer would, saying we\u2019re from Camp Ritchie. What campus, what direction should I take.\nThey said take as with so and so and you will find your way back. Now they would ask what\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 27\nlanguage are you in. German, he says take such and such an, said and you will get back to camp\nand we all learned that and so that\u2019s what you did. To get.\nBut you fought the battle of Gettysburg from the intelligence point of view and that was\nin the Gettysburg area. And that was your part of the training.",
        "Q: Anything else you can tell me about the training that you\u2019re allowed to tell?",
        "A: Oh well there was nothing classified in those days. As I said you know you were treated\nreally very well. The food was good. You had, it was not like basic training.",

        "A: Many of, yeah I think. Practically all but you didn\u2019t know until you \u2014 this was not an element\nthat you know you were conscious of. As a matter of fact throughout my foreign service career, I\nhad many friends who were Jewish and I didn\u2019t have any idea that they were Jewish. Yeah it just\nwas not an element that was known. As a matter of fact one of my closest friends, his name was\nHartree and about ten years after we\u2019d known each other I found out he was born in Austria. I\nsaid Hartree, how come you know you\u2019re from Austria. He said it was Hertzbaugh. You know.\nI mean this is the way it worked.

        "Q: Anything else you want to \u2014",
        "A: I should interpret. I had no feeling or connection to Germany. I was absolutely an American\ncitizen. I was an American. The fact that I had a German background really came only into play\nbecause I was in Camp Ritchie and I spoke German. I had no feeling at all of having been a\nGerman citizen at one time. Forgotten that you know. I mean I was, I felt absolutely and\nthoroughly as an American, just like any other American. And by that time I probably didn\u2019t\nhave much of an accent anymore. Maybe slightly. But which I still have. But or we, which has\ncome back in my old age. I mean I notice it myself being sort of a linguist that Ihave. My,\nactually my accent sort of returns slightly now. Yeah.\nBut I had actually no feeling of ever having been a German you know at that time. I was\nso Americanized from Kansas City, Middle Western kid. And psychologically the other thing\nbeing going to Kansas City immediately in the Middle West I was thrown into an American\nMiddle Western family. There were no other German refugees around me. I had to learn English\nand I was, I had nobody to speak German with. So I didn\u2019t and I you know only spoke English,\nlearned to speak English. And I was if you, if I landed in New York and lived in New York\namong other refugees, I would have felt like Kissinger you know. With a German accent and so\nforth. I deliberately tried to lose my German accent because I didn\u2019t want to be, I wanted to be\nwith you know integrated so to speak.\nAnd therefore I had really lost any contact with Germany. My mother, for just a year, you\nknow a year and a half and then she left and she came to the United States. So my, I had\nabsolutely no feeling or contact for having really been a German. I was thoroughly\nAmericanized. And I never had anybody really to speak German with or to exper -- have related\nexperiences with and I didn\u2019t know anybody who \u2014 because I was thoroughly Americanized and\nmy family was American. My uncle was the only one who spoke German, well a little bit of\nGerman. And he was gone all day long.\nSo I was, I was Americanized and I had no feeling, not being an American.

It was during the time\nwhen there was in the north Atlantic it was so. And we were very crowded in this troop ship. We\nwere stacked up four in a level. And kept at night, you know it was dark and so forth and it was,\nI mean it was pretty crowded.\nAnd we got to Broadway, to England and we went to Broadway in Worcestershire and it\nwas a very nice place. It was the intelligence sort of assembly plant from which we were\nassigned to various divisions.",
        "Q: What month, what are we talking about here?",
        "A: March.",
        "Q: Of?",
        "A: 1944.",
        "Q: 44, what was \u2014",
        "A: March, April. March. Yeah March, April 44. April.",
        "Q: Did they have different classes at Camp Ritchie and what number were you in?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I think I was the eighth class.",
        "Q: It says class 18.",
        "A: 18, it\u2019s possible but I just \u2014 I just don\u2019t remember and we were and at this replacement camp,\nwe were there and recruiters came from the 101\u00b0 and 82\".\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 32",
        "Q: Airborne?",
        "A: Airborne divisions. Looking for people who were going to be interrogators of prisoners of\nwar. Intelligence specialists. And I know I was inebriated but I signed up for the paratroop, for\nthe 101 Airborne division. But it was \u2014",
        "Q: You hadn\u2019t had any of that training yet?",
        "A: No and I was as a, I was so inebriated I signed up my best friend also without him knowing it.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re all of 20 years old?",
        "A: No, Iwas 19. 19.",
        "Q: 19 and a half?",
        "A: And we were sent off to Leicestershire where the 101\u201c Airborne division was located, waiting\nfor, to for the invasion. I mean \u2014 no actually not. We went to Leicestershire and there was a sort\nof an ad hoc training camp for paratroopers. And I think yeah, the training camp was actually\nmaintained by the 82\" division. It was in Leicestershire. And we had seven days of nothing but\nphysical training. Seven, eight hours a day of physical training. And only jumped from\nplatforms. Learned how to jump from platforms. And the second week, five days, every day to\njump out of an airplane. Locally. And they took us up in the airplanes and the US Army had\npurchased a number of farms which were the landing areas.\nAnd we were told that when we jumped we had to jump in that area because if we\njumped across into another farm, they had to buy the farm or something like that. And so for five\ndays, we jumped, one jump a day. And we were qualified. One of which was a night jump and\nthat was scary. So we jumped. And then we were assigned to the 101\u201c Airborne division which\nwas south of London. In the area of Redding. In various camps because \u2014 and there we were\nwaiting for the invasion. I mean for the date and we jumped in Normandy.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 33",
        "Q: On June what?",
        "A: June sixth, June. We jumped before H hour. We landed you know two hours before H hour,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Were you aware of the magnitude of the invasion?",
        "A: No we were a soldier and this was part of, we were going to invade France you know and go\nin there. And the only thing and this is a story that I\u2019ve told and it is known, a little anecdote. We\nwere in this plane, the 20 people, 24 people in the plane. And we were flying towards the\ncontinent at night. With the plane had no doors because paratroopers, planes with paratroopers\nhad no doors. They were open because they couldn\u2019t, they so you just and there was a lot of\nnoise. And we were scared as hell. And we had been issued just before we left, new first aid.\nEverybody had first aid kits on their helmets. You know just strapped to their helmets. We had\nbeen issued new first aid kits which had a vial of morphine in them because if you jumped and\ngot hurt that you could inject yourself with morphine.\nWe were flying towards Normandy at night, scared. And somebody in our plane said\nwhy wait until you get hurt to use morphine and the whole plane broke open their first aid kits\nwith the vials and we jabbed our next door neighbor with morphine and all of us went out of the\nplane when we jumped, feeling no pain.",
        "Q: And where did you land?",
        "A: We landed, well I don\u2019t know exactly where we landed but our landing area was a, the city\nwas Carentan, Omaha Beach. Near Omaha Beach, a little bit inland. Carentan. We were\nsupposed to land and make, keep the road, block the road from German replacements from\ncoming into that area and replace German. That was our mission. And whether we accomplished\nthis or not, I have no idea.\nBut I must say that we had no idea where we were when we landed. When we landed.\nFortunately the assistant division commander of the 101\u2018 Airborne division by the name of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 34\nHiggins, apparently knew where we were and he sort of took us in hand and we managed to get\nyou know, do our thing. The interesting thing about the Normandy landing. We were in combat\nonly for nine days. And that was the plan, That the paratroopers would land. We had no\nequipment. We had no food with us or anything with us because we were supposed to be there\nfor eight or nine days. I mean we had a little bit of food with us. No equipment. But were to be\ntaken out immediately when the area was secured. And that is what happened. We were there I\nthink for nine days. And went back to England.\nAnd stayed in England, in that area.",
        "Q: Did you see any German soldiers when you were in Normandy?",
        "A: Yeah, a few. I mean they were as scared as we were, when \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have any physical reaction to seeing them, being German yourself?",
        "A: No, no, no. I was an American. I mean none whatsoever, none whatsoever. The German\nwas the enemy. The fact that I was of German origin. No, I was an American. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you speak to any of them?",
        "A: We took a few, we took a few prisoners and interrogated them. But it was really purely\ntactical interrogation. Where do you come from? What is the name of your unit? How many are\nin your unit? And things like that, just very simple questions. Because it was a very fluid\nsituation. But we actually got taken out very quickly. And went back to England and then we\nwaited. We were in England. I was in the Redding area in a camp until the Holland invasion, in\nSeptember 17\" I believe. September 17\" was the invasion of Holland. And that was a more\ndifficult jump because it was day time. And there were, the other thing I wanted to mention is\nwe also had glider troops. The 101\u201c Airborne division had a glider regiment and I was actually\nassigned to the glider regiment but as a jumper. And the replacements that we got after combat\nand injured were all soldiers who were from the glider regiment, because the gliders were much\nmore dangerous than jumping. You know and so people, you had to volunteer to be a jumper,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 35\nbut to be a glider rider, you were assigned. So after the Normandy invasion all the survivors of\nglider volunteered to become paratroopers because 1t was so much more dangerous to be a glider\nrider. And so we went into Normandy, into Holland and we, the 101\u201c Airborne Division was\nsituated around Eindhoven. The 82\" Division was Nijmagen and the Sixth British Paratroop\ndivision was across the river. I can\u2019t remember. And that was the occasion where the British\nwere annihilated. And the reason they were annihilated is we were supposed to, three divisions\nwere supposed to jump and maintain the road open for the second British army to move through\nand across the line and liberate Holland. What happened is Marshall Montgomery apparently\njust, they were so slow. And here we were holding the road open and the British came and they\nstopped and they had tea in the afternoon. They stopped, got off their tanks. And sat with us and\nhad tea and then they never made it to, to Arnhem. Arnhem. They never made it and the British\nwere annihilated across the river. The whole division was and it was, the reason was that\nMontgomery never came and did that. We were in Holland for 70 days. We were supposed to\nbe there for ten days at the most and then again were to be removed. We stayed there for 70 days.\nAnd the big problem was food. Because we hadn\u2019t brought any food with us. And we literally\nlived off the land. And the land were apple orchards. This whole area were in that part around\nEindhoven were apple orchards. And we lived off apples. And so did the local population\nbecause they didn\u2019t have anything much either.\nSo what there was of farmers and people who were around, they couldn\u2019t give us\nanything. For once in a while, they got a chicken or something like that but we were there for 70\ndays and before we were taken out. And brought back to rest camp in France called near Rels\n[ph] called Mumalo le Grand [ph]. That was our camp, was a French, old French, French camp\nwith actually straw mattresses still. And we were there briefly and then started to Bastogne to\ncounterattack, the British counter attacked and we went to Bastogne, and were there throughout\nthe siege of Bastogne.\nWe went there on the 18\" of December, 17\" of December and then we were completely\nisolated and Eisenhower declared Bastogne the expendable to stay there and not give up. We\nwere completely surrounded by Germans. And it was General Patton, the Third army decided he\nwas not going to, what Eisenhower had determined to make us expendable. He decided that he\nwas going to send in a tank battalion to rescue us. And that tank battalion was headed by Colonel\nAbrams who was later General Abrams, in Korea. And they came through with his tank\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 36\nbattalion and on Christmas morning reached us. And broke through the German \u2014 the Germans\nhad us completely surrounded and we didn\u2019t take any prisoners there because we were going to\nbe their prisoners. And my one claim to fame in the army was when they came to have a\nsurrender, the 101 Airborne surrender. I was working on, I mean I was with my colonel by the\nname of Harper, I was a regimental commander and we were actually right across from division\nheadquarters. And they sent, the Germans sent in a team to make a surrender. And what\nhappened was the surrender, the team two officers and two enlisted men were held when they\ncame across with the white flag. And they were held in an outpost. And brought in the letter to\nsurrender and my colonel and I were with our division commander. At the time was, he was\nassistant division commander because General Taylor was in Washington at the time. I mean he\nwas not there. And McAuliffe was the assistant division commander. And so they presented this\nsurrender demand to the commander and General McAuliffe and I were standing by them. He\nsaid oh nuts, what am I going to tell them. And no idea of \u2014 he said oh nuts, what am I going to\ntell them. And Colonel Kennard, his chief of staff stood by him and said tell them just what you\njust said. He said what did I say. He said you said nuts. He said all right, ok, nuts. And he\nwrote it out nuts. And then he sent my colonel, Colonel Harper and me back to the surrender\nplace with the German officers, two German officers waiting. And we went down there and\nhanded them the slip which said nuts. And the German officers said in German, what 1s this?",
        "Q: What does it mean?",
        "A: Nuts. I said, what is nuts. I said go to hell. And that you know that became the translation of\nnuts. And that was the end of that. They left and then on Christmas morning we were liberated\nand we had not been able to be supplied by air because the weather was very bad. It was snowing\nand raining. And on Christmas morning there was bright sunshine. And suddenly the C-47\"\ncame over massively, throwing down medical supplies. Food. And everything, all of a sudden\non Christmas morning. It was great.\nAnd then after a few days we were sent, we were liberate -- No, we were there for\nanother week or so. And then we moved out of Bastogne and we moved by that time we were\nvery much emaciated. I mean troop wise, we were one third of our strength. We moved over to\nthe right and down the line on the west side of the line, we moved down. We saw no combat.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 37\nPractically no combat. It was towards the end of the war. The last three weeks of the war. And\nwe went, we moved down and ended up on the day that the war ended, on May 6 at\nBerchtesgaden. We actually took Berchtesgaden. There was nothing to take. And being still\nprisoner of war specialists we headed immediately for Hitler\u2019s, and we went up to the Berghof\nand then we wanted to get up to the Eagle\u2019s Nest and we found out that we were not the first.\nThere was a French company that had preceded us and they had gone up to the Eagle\u2019s Nest and\ntaken all kinds of furniture and equipment and thrown it down the elevator shaft that had been\nthe elevator. So we had to crawl up there by foot to get to the Eagle\u2019s Nest. There was nothing\nthere anymore. But they had managed to throw stuff down the elevator shaft so you couldn\u2019t use\nthe elevator to the Eagle\u2019s Nest. That\u2019s the end of that story.\nAnd then we were there for about a month. Oh we ended up in the Berchtesgaden Hof\nwhich 1s the fancy hotel in Berchtesgaden. And we were there for I think four days. When we\nwere kicked out of the Berchtesgaden Hof and all the high level POWs, the generals and the\nministers that were captured around there were put into the Berchtesgaden Hof. This is where\nthey held them as prisoners.\nAnd we were in a hotel across from the Berchtesgaden Hof which was a lovely sort of a\ncountry hotel with cabins, you know individual cabins. And we landed in that hotel and we gave\nthe proprietor and the kitchen staff all of our K rations and everything we had and they provided\nus with food for a month.",
        "Q: Did you do any questioning of \u2014",
        "A: Not, in, after we got to Berchtesgaden it was over with. We were, as a matter of fact we were\nput in charge of securing Berchtesgaden but there was nothing to secure. You know, no problems\nat all.",
        "Q: But you had said there are all these high level prisoners?",
        "A: The prisoners were taken, we were not involved, not involved at all. Those were by that time\nyeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 38",
        "Q: And then where did you go?",
        "A: Well then briefly the 101\u2018 Airborne Division was taken south to Bad Gastein in Austria\nwhich is about an hour south of Salzburg. And we were there briefly and then I was detached. I\nwas able, because I had had enough points being in these various combat situation and having\ngotten by that time a Bronze star, and combat infantry badge. I had enough points to be one of\nthe first to get out. So I was sent back to a camp near Paris, Le Desine [ph], a suburb of Paris\nand I was there for about a week and then was shipped home. And I was actually got home by\nDecember eighth. You know I was one of the first people in my own acquaintance to get out of\nthe army and get back. And then I immediately enrolled back to go to college on the first of\nJanuary I was back in school. Most of my friends and relatives were, like Jeff, they were not\nhome yet.",
        "Q: And then when you finished college, where did you go?",
        "A: When I finished college in University of Kansas City I was persuaded by my, Henry Bertram\nHill. History professor. He said I should try to get to graduate school. At the school of\nadvanced, he suggested it was the school of advanced international studies.",
        "Q: Johns Hopkins.",
        "A: Which became Johns Hopkins. At that time it was still independent. And they had a summer\nschool in Peterborough, New Hampshire and occupied the residence of a women\u2019s boarding\nschool. I think they had Kendall Hall School for Girls or something in Peterborough, New\nHampshire. And I was admitted only for summer school. I was not admitted for the actual\ncollege at that time. So I went up there and don\u2019t think I distinguished myself academically.\nHowever, on the weekend before the fourth of July in some reason or other, the cooks of the\nschool quit. Left. And left, the school was without a cook for the long weekend. For the Fourth\nweekend. So before they could go down to Boston to hire a new chefs for that weekend, I\nvolunteered to cook for the school. And I think that is what got me into graduate school for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 39\nnext year because they couldn\u2019t refuse my application. So I went to SIAS and at the first week in\nWashington, my wife Mimi had come down. She had been graduated from Carleton College. She\nhad sort of a record there. She had a absolute A, four years of nothing but A\u2019s. She made Phi\nBeta Kappa in her junior year. And she was a valedictorian of her class. She had actually\nliterally never had anything but an A as long as she was going to school, until graduate school\nand we had met and that\u2019s when she got her first B and she blamed me for that.\nAnd so we really started going with one another after the first week at SIAS and we got\nour master\u2019s degrees.",
        "Q: And then what did you do?",
        "A: I looking for a job, I was hired by the Chase National Bank. And went into a program in\nNew York in international banking, training at the bank. And I was trained for, paid $200 a\nmonth plus lunch which was very important for ten months and then I was assigned to go to\nGermany where they had three branches, primarily serving the military in Germany, primarily.\nNot completely.\nBut they had three branches in Germany \u2014 in Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich. And I\nwent there and Mimi and I had decided rather than getting married in Washington and then\nimmediately being separated because there was no housing available, that we would wait, that I\nwould go over there and I would find housing for us and then she would come over if we married\nand live happily ever after. I went to Stuttgart and most of my customers were military. And\nthrough them I got a place, an apartment to live and I was going to be able to have an apartment\nand so I told the bank that I was bringing my fianc\u00e9e over and they said oh no you can\u2019t get\nmarried for three years. I said what? Says yes, we want to be able to move you around to the\nother branches, you can\u2019t get married. And I walked out of the bank, not having enough money\nto get back to the United States.\nFortunately the State Department was taking over from military government the\nadministration in Germany. In other words, we were establishing an embassy for military\ngovernment and they were hiring people on the spot and they preferred hiring people who had\nnot been with military government. And so I was hired. Practically from one day to the next and\nthey wanted to put me in finance and I didn\u2019t want to be in finance. I had been working for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 40\nbank and I didn\u2019t want to be in finance. So I was told that you don\u2019t want to be in finance. Would\nyou like to be in cultural and press affairs. And having been journalistically trained and worked\na little bit in journalism, I said yes. So they sent me out to Bad Hamburg which is a suburb of\nFrankfurt where there was to be the headquarters of the America house program in Germany.\nAnd the director of that program was a woman by the name of Patricia Van Douten and you go\nout and see her and maybe you\u2019ll get hired. So I went out there to and couldn\u2019t\u2019 see her but I was\nadmitted to her deputy, Max Kimenthal. And as we started to talk I had no idea what an America\nHouse was. This was an America House program. I didn\u2019t even know what an America House\nwas. But I was there to be interviewed. And he started talking to me and had a telephone call.\nAnd he said excuse me for five minutes. I\u2019m going to have to go out and see someone, but why\ndon\u2019t you sit here at the coffee table and then whatever you have, read and I'll be back in five\nminutes.\nAnd there was a paper which said the future of the America House program in Germany\nby Patricia Van Douten. I said so I can read this and see what, I write it. He came back and he\nsaid if you were a director of an America House what would you want to do. And I just\nregurgitated what I was reading and he stopped me after about four or five minutes and he says\njust a moment Mr. Tuch, I want to \u2014 and he came back, went out and came back with Patricia\nVan Douten who was a formidable middle aged woman and would you start again Mr. Tuch.\nAnd I told the story and they hired me on the spot. I was sworn in that day. It took me two years\nto admit to Pat Van Douten what I had done. But that\u2019s the way I got into the foreign service. I\nwas temporary and then after two years I took the exam and then I became a foreign service\nofficer.\nThe action by \u2014 or the same day that I was sworn in, another young man was also sworn\nin and his name was Natel, Wallace W. Natel. We were sworn in on the same day and were he\nwas just a year or two older than I was. But we were given certain rank, very low rank, the\nequivalent of a second lieutenant type of thing. But he wasn\u2019t even given that because he had\nbeen a conscientious objector in the war and he had been a fire fighter, a paratroop fire fighter in\nColorado. So a fellow paratrooper. So we immediately became close friends because we both\nwere paratroopers. And we remained friends our whole life. And he was assigned to Darmstadt\nand I to Wiesbaden and after three months he went to Hanover and I went to Frankfurt and that\u2019s\nhow he became.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 41",
        "Q: Where were you stationed during your diplomatic career?",
        "A: I start, as I said I started out in Wiesbaden. After three months was assigned to Frankfurt to\nrun the America house which was the US Information Center there. I was there for five years.\nAnd the reason I was assigned to Frankfurt 1s that the then director of the Frankfurt America\nhouse who was a frustrated conductor of music, musician. With the budget for his information\ncenter he went out and hired himself an orchestra and performed a performance with himself as\nthe conductor. He was fired the next day. Those were days when you know nothing was\npermanent. And I was assigned to replace him from Frankfurt. We were there for five years.\nAnd then I was in Washington and my job there became President Eisenhower had given his\natoms for peace speech and that became a major program issue, atoms for peace. And I was\nassigned to build atoms for peace exhibits in Japan, in India and Portugal and I was doing that.\nAnd at the end of that we were starting to assign officers to the Iron Curtain countries. And I\nvolunteered immediately for the Soviet Union. And I was given Russian language training. And\nthe State Department at that time did not have a good Russian language program so I was made\nan exception and I was sent to CIA which had a marvelous program.\nAnd at that time the CIA language program was in one of the temples behind the Lincoln\nMemorial on Ohio drive. And I started there and we were 12 students. I was the only outsider\nand we had five instructors. It was a marvelous course. We had five linguists. These were all\nRussian linguists of different backgrounds. There was a lawyer and different, and one linguist.\nAnd we were allowed to speak English only with the linguist, with the Russian lang -- And we\nhad two students and one linguist and we changed every hour for five hours every day. So the\ntwo of us were with a different linguist and the sixth hour was with the linguist. Well I was there\nfor a week and suddenly word came down that I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, at CIA. I wasn\u2019t\nallowed to know who people were.\nAnd they finally compromised. Since I had already been with my five colleagues for a\nweek, they finally compromised that I could stay there but I couldn\u2019t go into the cafeteria. So for\na year I had to bring my own lunch and I couldn\u2019t go into the cafeteria. But I had a terrific\nexperience in learning Russian.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 42",
        "Q: What were your other postings?",
        "A: And then I went, then for about a year they wouldn\u2019t give me the Russians, the Soviets\nwouldn\u2019t give me a visa because I was with this spy organization, USIA. So I resigned from\nUSIA. I was commissioned in the State Department. Before that happened I was actually, I was\nwith the Voice of America in Munich. As a correspondent and as a writer of commentaries and a\ncorrespondent in Munich with the Voice. And then finally I got a visa and was assigned in\nAugust 1958. August 58 I was assigned to Moscow. And we were there and I was the first\npublic affairs officer, the first we didn\u2019t call them that. I was the first cultural and press attach\u00e9 in\nMoscow since World War II. The first one because there was a break sort of in the ice. There\nhad been the Camp David meeting between Eisenhower and then Khrushchev had been to the\nUnited States and so they thought that there may be a break and we had signed the first US,\nUSSR cultural agreement in January of 1958. And I was there to, was assigned to carry out that\nprogram in August 58. And that\u2019s when we started having exchange programs.\nAnd actually my experience from then on is in my last book. And I was thinking I should\nprobably donate a copy of that book to the Holocaust Museum and give it to you and here it 1s.\nThis is my last book, my fourth book. And everything that transpired from Moscow onward is in\nthat book. My foreign service experience and so forth.",
        "Q: When did you retire?",
        "A: I retired in January 85. We served in Moscow for three years. There had been a strict State\nDepartment rule that foreign service officers should not serve longer than two years at that time\nbecause of the Cold War situation. But Tommy Thompson, our American ambassador, such a\nmarvelous person, always thought that two years is too short a time for us really to get involved\nand he asked, since I was actually still in USIA, I had been over. He asked George Allen who\nwas the director of USIA and a former ambassador, and foreign service officer and a close friend\nof Tommy Thompson. He asked him whether he could ask me to stay a third year. Unbeknownst\nto me.\nAnd he said yes of course and so Tommy Thompson asked me whether I would be\nwilling to stay for a third year. And I felt so flattered to be asked anything by Tommy\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 43\nThompson, I immediately said yes. And then I went home to confront Mimi and our two little\nchildren. But she was at that time such a conservative in her life style and even politically at that\ntime, she thought anything is better than a change. So let\u2019s stay for a third year. And we were\nthe first family to stay in Moscow for three years, which of course 1s standard now. It became\nstandard and so we stayed there for a third year. Then I came back to Washington and I became -\n- Ed Murrow was the director of USIA and I became one of his assistants, responsible for the\nSoviet Union at least in Europe and I was that for three years. I mean actually more. He died, he\npassed away.\nAnd then I was under, and I assigned myself since I was in charge of Soviet Union and\nEastern Europe I assigned myself to be public affairs officer in Warsaw. I went and stayed in the\narea, and we had a fairly large program in Warsaw and I wanted to go to Warsaw. And Mimi\nand I studied Polish for several months and the new director of USIA came in, Carl Rowan,\nformer you know. And he says he wouldn\u2019t let me go to Warsaw. You have to stay here in this\njob. Because there is nobody to replace you. So I stayed. I didn\u2019t go to Warsaw, but the next\nyear I assigned myself again to Warsaw and we studied Polish again. By that time Carl Rowan\nhad left and Leonard Marx became the director of USIA. And Leonard Marx called me in and\nsays I\u2019m going to make a proposal to you, an offer to you that you can\u2019t refuse. And I said\nwhat\u2019s that. I was ready to go to Warsaw. Within about three weeks. And he said you\u2019re going\nto go as deputy chief of mission to Bulgaria. To Sofia. And I couldn\u2019t refuse that.\nSo Mimi and I studied Bulgarian for two weeks. And went off to Sofia and where I was\nDCM, Deputy Chief of Mission. But we didn\u2019t have an embassy yet. We had a legation. So I\nwas consul of legation. And the minister who became a very close friend of mine, had to leave\nafter one year. He was recalled. It was a, well it\u2019s ok. He had an accident where he killed a\npedestrian when he was driving an embassy car. And this went on and the Bulgarians were awful\nabout this. There\u2019s this American killing our children and so forth. And he was finally withdrawn\nand I was charg\u00e9 of the legation for a long period because the person who was to replace him,\nJack McSweeney, didn\u2019t want to come to Sofia as a minister. He wanted to be an ambassador.\nAnd so he delayed and delayed and they finally told him if you don\u2019t go to Sofia, we\u2019re going to\ncancel your assignment and he finally came which was about five months, six months later. And\nso he came. And after Sofia, I got a plush post. I got to be PA or Public Affairs officer in Berlin,\nmy home town. And we were in Berlin for three years and we had a really personally a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 44\nwonderful time because theater, opera, everything was just gravy. However, the job was, became\nreally terrible because the situation in Germany, in Berlin specifically had turned entirely where\nthe young Berliners felt that we were, became the enemy in Berlin. And that\u2019s quite a bit in the\nbook. And the situation that developed and working in Berlin became very, very difficult. And\nfrustrating.\nAnd it really didn\u2019t turn around. Well after Berlin, oh after Berlin we \u2014",

And after that\nassignment, three years and I was, that was one of my fascinating assignments for me. Because I\nhad been with the Voice as a correspondent in 1957 before going to Moscow, so I was really\ncoming home to the Voice. And running the Voice to me was a wonderful assignment. A\ndifficult one but a wonderful assignment and I really, because journalism was really my thing.\nAnd I felt that this was a wonderful assignment. And after the Voice of America I decided well \u2014\noh I was an inspector. I became chief inspector of the USIA and I inspected Brazil. And being in\nBrazil four months, I decided that was going to be my next post. You know completely different\nand they said well you can\u2019t go to Brasilia. You speak Russian, German, French.

And\nbecoming a valued member of the international democratic community. I don\u2019t necessarily agree\nwith individual policies of the German government, especially now. But I feel sociologically\nand historically they have done a terrific job with the help of the United States. I must say what\nthe United States, what we did in the 1950s to reintegrate Germany into the international\ndemocratic society was also a very tough and very remarkable job, where we helped the\nGermans do it. I mean they had to do it themselves but we gave them a tremendous amount of\nassistance in doing it.\nAnd were very successful and were appreciated by the Germans for doing that. I would\nsay in the 19, especially in the 1950s. Until the early 1960s and I just have felt very personally\ncommitted to participating in the reorientation of the German society into a western democratic\nsociety. I mean that was a very, I\u2019m grateful for that and I participated in this. And I think 1t was\nsuccessful and I actually wrote about this, well it\u2019s in this book.

And my mother was widowed when she was 39 years old and never remarried.

        "A: No, they were reform Jewish. It is interesting. My father and mother considered themselves\nGermans. Their religion was Jewish, reform Jewish. But it was not an ethnic thing for them to\nbe Jewish. They were reform Jewish and I was bar mitzvah in 1937, a year before. And as a\nmatter of fact, I had a high soprano voice at that time. My mother was interested in that. And I\ndid the whole service in, and sang it.",

That was before I was bar mitzvah, I took his death\nvery seriously and I went to temple every night for 30 months I believe it was.

And we\nwere friends. We were close friends, but other than that I really had no German -- I don\u2019t\nremember having close school friends or other friends at all. Either in grade school or in high\nschool. It was in Hohenzollern gymnasium which was very close to where we lived on Martin\nLuther Strasse. And so I just really don\u2019t remember very much about my \u2014",
        "A: I was at my gymnasium, I was interested in sports. That was swimming and track which I\nparticipated in. I was never very good at it. No, I had what you call letters in it and so forth. But\nthe one thing that I remember very, very closely is right across the street from us lived our\nphysical ed teacher who was an officer in the SS, who took to me. I was the best marcher. You\nknow when we marched and I also was the best saluter. And he was a very friendly to me. He\nlived right across the street. And every once in a while he wore his SS uniform. But I had\nabsolutely no fear or any kind of, other than that he was one of my teachers and he was friendly\nwith me. And I really didn\u2019t feel any kind of persecution or otherwise until I was told that you\nhad to leave the Hohenzollern gymnasium. And I was very disappointed because it was a very\ngood gymnasium. It was close to where we lived. And I had to go to the Jewish gymnasium, way\nacross town and I bicycled. But this was a really relatively short time.\nWhat happened was after my father died in 1936, my mother took over his business. We\nlived happily in Berlin. In 1937 her first cousin who lived, from Kansas City. They came to\nEurope. They didn\u2019t come to Germany. They met in Marienbad in Czechoslovakia. My mother\nwent down. She didn\u2019t take me along and I really don\u2019t know why because she sent me off to\ncamp. And they met in Marienbad in 1937. It was her first cousin. Interestingly about her first\ncousin who emigrated to the United States before World War I as a young person. He had\nworked for my grandfather and somehow he had gotten into financial trouble. So my\nerandfather said get out of here. I\u2019ll pay you to go to the United States and sent him abroad in\norder to keep him out of trouble. He never forgot that what my grandfather had done for him.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 9\nAnd therefore, they came to Germany, to Marienbad to Czechoslovakia. And met. It was sort of\na family reunion. He and his wife and their son Jeff who was my second cousin came to\nMarienbad.\nAnd they made the decision that the following year I was to go to Kansas City for one\nyear and my cousin Jeff was to come and stay with my mother for a year. Sort of be a family\nexchange. It developed during that following year he wasn\u2019t going to come but I was going to\ngo for good. And I had an affidavit and I had a visa. My mother did not yet. She had, she had an\naffidavit from her cousin but she didn\u2019t have a visa yet. It hadn\u2019t come up yet. So I went by\nmyself in 1938. She took me to Hamburg and put me onto the Manhattan ship and I went off as a\n14 year old to New York.\nYeah, but going back to Berlin.",
        "A: That so I really I should say something else about Berlin. I am sure that if my father had lived\nwe would have all succumbed in the Holocaust because he felt he wasn\u2019t German. He had served\nin World War I. He had an Iron Cross, actually an Iron Cross that was bestowed belatedly by\nHitler. So he was, this was never going to happen to us. We would have never left Berlin and we\nwould have all succumbed if he had not passed away. So this is one of the, my personal history\nthat I feel that the only way that we really survived is because he had passed away at an early\nage.",
        "A: Only on one occasion and it was not really anti-Semitism. It was the week before I left. My\nmother had purchased for me a pair of long trousers, knowing that in the United States young\nboys wore knickers but also long trousers. And I had them on, was right across the street from\nwhere we lived and where I was accosted by four or five young boys who didn\u2019t like what I was\nwearing. Whether I was Jewish or not I have no idea. And they beat me up. And I came home\nand my mother, in her usual way, said this did you good so you had this experience of being beat\nup so you know what will happen to you if you know, things like this.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 10\nAnd that was the only occasion that I personally felt it was, that I had any kind of bad\nexperience in this.

I don\u2019t remember\nthat there were any things that happened to us personally because in any way. I heard about him\npretty early but it was one of those things that my father said this doesn\u2019t concern us. We\u2019re\nGermans. He\u2019s not an important figure. Of course and actually his, while he was alive, his\nbusiness was fine. I mean he had no problems at all. This was 19, between 1933 and 1936. He\ndied in 1936. So I really had no bad experiences.

I didn\u2019t learn about this til oh about, ten, 15 years ago.\nShe never talked about it. She never told me, but when Kristallnacht came she had a large\napartment, she was a widow living by herself. Six of her cousins and relatives came to her and\nshe put them up in the apartment.

So they were together and her younger brother\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 21\nand his wife had a child. No, no I\u2019m sorry. My mother got out of the Philippines in August 1941\nand came to Kansas City and that\u2019s when we were reunited.",
        "A: It was very interesting. I mean in retrospect. I was not, I was by that time an American.\nLiving with my American family and I was thoroughly Americanized language wise. I only\nspoke English. I would not speak German to my mother because you are in the United States.\nNow you learn English. And she did and the curious thing about my mother over the years, she\nspoke German with her friends. She could not speak German with me. She switched into\nEnglish when she talked to people and it\u2019s something psychological. She was never able to speak\nGerman with me. And I say mother speak German for heaven\u2019s sake. We were in the same, in\nBonn in Germany. We were in a department store and she would ask me to translate for her\nbecause she would not speak German in front of me. And it\u2019s obviously something\npsychologically but she absolutely learned German and she spoke only English. Learned English\nand she spoke only English with me. And learned English really very well. She became a\nbusinesswoman.\nShe was the credit manager of Carter and Hay meat packing company in Kansas City for\nmany, many years.",
        "A: I moved out and lived with her first in a very small apartment in Kansas City and then some\nyears later we moved into another apartment.",

        "A: I became so immediately, so my aunt when I came to Germany said right away she said let,\nfor two weeks let us have every morning, she took me to a teacher. Yeah they took me. They\nhad a chauffeur. They took me to a teacher to study English with her.",
        "A: Like a tutor for two hours every morning. She happened to be a friend of the family. And\nafter two weeks, she sent me to Southwest high school. And I was thrown into Southwest high\nschool and that was it.",
        "A: Not very much. I mean they just sort of, I was the new kid. But my 50\" high school reunion.\nMimi and I went to Kansas City and we went to this. And I, we walked into the country club\nwhere it was being held. And there were two people standing there. And one of them says Tom\nTuch, Hans Tuch. You were the kid who wouldn\u2019t speak English. And I mean this is how they\nremembered me as the kid who didn\u2019t speak English. And I was thrown into a high school. And\nit was probably the wisest decision that she ever made. Sink or swim. And I had a number of\nteachers who were very sympathetic.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah I\u2019m sure they did. I mean you know and, but I was sort of integrated into\nAmerican high school life. The interesting thing too was we lived on the Kansas side, across the\nstate line from Kansas City, Missouri. Across the state line. Just one block. There was no high\nschool in that area of Shawnee Mission Kansas. So we were permitted, Jeff and I to go across the\nstate line in Missouri, in Kansas City, go to high school. To get there, we got drivers licenses\nwhen we were 14 in Kansas so that we could go to school in, across to Southwest high school.\nAnd my cousin wasn\u2019t doing very well so he, after one year he went to private school,\nCumberland country day school. And I continued at Southwest and went there for four years.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 23",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I mean after, you know, yeah Kristallnacht became something that I was aware of but I\nwas not \u2014",
        "A: [heard from my mother. She was ok. And I was, I became more conscious as I grew older of\nwhat was going on. And but as I said, I had no personal contact in Germany anymore. No\nrelatives, no friends. My mother\u2019s friends, there were some but I was not aware of them. I was\nnot familiar with them.",
        "A: I was just 18 in 1942 and I started immediately after I graduated in June of 1942 at the\nUniversity of Kansas City which was then a private university and my aunt\u2019s brother in law was\nthe chairman of the board of the university. And I went there, started summer school. And I got\nin a year and three, and I went that fall and I went to night school at the same summer school\nthan winter. Because I was working in the cafeteria to earn money and I was working in the\nlibrary to earn money. And then I was working in the front office. 30 cents per hour. We, you\nknow, as a student.\nAnd I managed to enroll in night school at the same time when I was going to day school,\nwhich was not permitted. But I was able to because I was working at the registration department,\nI kept the two records separate. And so I got in a year and three quarters in one year at, of\ncollege. By May of the following year of 43, I was drafted into the army.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 24",
        "A: Oh yes, I do remember that. My family on Sunday had a lunch, a family lunch and we went\ninto the sun room where their radio was and we had the radio on when we heard about this.\nActually this was yeah that was Pearl Harbor. And then the next day the president\u2019s speech about\nit. Yeah, FDR\u2019s speech. I remember that. And then of course \u2014",
        "A: No that was, that is another story.",
        "A: I was drafted and I was at Camp Sibert in Gadsden Alabama in chemical warfare basic\ntraining.",
        "A: No, no, no I was, I was, I didn\u2019t have a chance to volunteer. I was drafted. You know almost,\nI went in the army six months after I was 18. And I was in Camp Sibert in Alabama in chemical\nwarfare which meant you did everything in basic training with the, as the infantry does except\nwith gas masks on. You walked, jumped, ran with gas masks on. Then I guess the army decided\nthat there wasn\u2019t going to be any chemical warfare.in this war. So they closed the camp and I\nwas sent to New Orleans to be in a port battalion as a stevedore, loading and unloading ships,\narmy ships. And I was doing this and I said I\u2019ve got to get out of here.\nAnd so I applied for training, STAP, advanced specialized training program as a soldier. I\nwas a private. And I was accepted but you had to have some kind of security clearance\nand they came to me says you can\u2019t go to ASTP, you\u2019re an enemy alien. So they assigned a, my\nsergeant you know who supervised me and you know he said you will go down to New Orleans\nto the district court and you will be sworn in as a citizen. You will be made a citizen. But you\nhave to have a witness who has known you for three years to do this. And of course I knew\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 25\nnobody. My sergeant well I\u2019ve known him for three years. He\u2019s known me for three weeks. And\nwe went, he says I swear that I\u2019ve known him. I\u2019m a witness so he could get a day off that way\nand we went into the city of New Orleans and I was sworn in as an American citizen on that day.",
        "A: Yeah I was, well I mean I was able to get out of stevedoring.",
        "A: Exactly and I went to the University of Illinois for several months and did actually I was put\ninto a graduate program in German and I ended up with 12 hours of credit towards my bachelor\u2019s\ndegree later on. And I was there for about three months. And then I went to Camp Ritchie. That\nwas sort of my approach. My University of Illinois I went to Camp Ritchie, Maryland.",
        "A: Yes, it was the Army Intelligence school. And I was going to be an intelligence specialist.\nKnowing German and having German as my main qualification for going there. And it was a, I\nwas used to army life by that time. Camp Ritchie was different. It was a camp close to\nWashington where your training was not six days a week and one day off. It was seven days a\nweek and the eighth day off which was called ban day because the commanding general of Camp\nRitchie was a brigadier general by the name of Banfield. So you worked six, seven days and got\nthe eighth day off. And the course I think was eight weeks long.\nIt was also a sort of a peculiar camp because many of the soldiers there were privileged\nkids of senators and congressmen and people in the administration and on weekends very often,\non ban day, there were limousines coming up to take sons and daughters. There were some very\nfancy people who were soldiers there. The permanent staff at Camp Ritchie were primarily, they\nwere you know not, they were not German specialists or anything. They were not \u2014 there were a\nlot of refugee children. I mean youngsters at Camp Ritchie. And some of them were children of\nvery prominent people.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 26",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah. Because we all spoke German.",
        "A: The previous element at Camp Ritchie was Italian speakers because they, initially there was\nplans to invade Europe through Italy. And they were training Italian speakers. And when it was\ndetermined that they were not going through Italy, they kept these youngsters, these Italian\nspeaking, as staff. And they were, became the enemy that we were trained to come to fight. They\nwere the enemy. They were all Italian speaking kids. Italian Americans.\nThe German speakers, there was a permanent staff there. And the man in charge, master\nsergeant, Manmar Hudeen [ph], a very well-known former wrestling champion was the master\nsergeant in charge of our barracks and so forth. His name was Manmar Hudeen. He was a huge\nguy and I do remember distinctly, he was a very nice person. And but his name was Manmar\nHudeen. There was the, there were some pretty well known children of well-known people. In\nthe camp.\nAnd I became, I just cannot remember him now, a well-known writer, author who later\non in late life was in East Germany. He defected to East Germany. I will be able to look it up but\nI just don\u2019t remember it now. But we were, and it was a pretty fancy kind of a camp. I mean\nbeing a private in the army in Camp Ritchie, I was very impressed. And our training consisted,\nour intelligence training, consisted of fighting the battle of Gettysburg from the intelligence point\nof view.\nAnd we were taken out at night and put on trucks and we were taken into the Gettys \u2014 we\nwere at Camp Ritchie is you know, in the Gettysburg area. And they let us out of the trucks and\nsaid find yourself back to Camp Ritchie within the next three hours. This is your compass. Well\nwe all had learned by that time from other kids, you went to the next farm, rang the door.\nFarmer would, saying we\u2019re from Camp Ritchie. What campus, what direction should I take.\nThey said take as with so and so and you will find your way back. Now they would ask what\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 27\nlanguage are you in. German, he says take such and such an, said and you will get back to camp\nand we all learned that and so that\u2019s what you did. To get.\nBut you fought the battle of Gettysburg from the intelligence point of view and that was\nin the Gettysburg area. And that was your part of the training.",
        "A: Oh well there was nothing classified in those days. As I said you know you were treated\nreally very well. The food was good. You had, it was not like basic training.",
        "A: Oh it\u2019s a lovely, you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean it\u2019s a, I mean they have guide tours through it. And it\u2019s next to Camp, it\u2019s next\nto the president\u2019s \u2014",

        "A: We were all, no. You see all they were all German speakers so most of them were refugee\nchildren. There were very few \u2014",
        "A: No we were army kids. I mean we were GIs. We spoke German and had similar backgrounds.\nWe, most of us came from Germany.",
        "A: Many of, yeah I think. Practically all but you didn\u2019t know until you \u2014 this was not an element\nthat you know you were conscious of. As a matter of fact throughout my foreign service career, I\nhad many friends who were Jewish and I didn\u2019t have any idea that they were Jewish. Yeah it just\nwas not an element that was known. As a matter of fact one of my closest friends, his name was\nHartree and about ten years after we\u2019d known each other I found out he was born in Austria. I\nsaid Hartree, how come you know you\u2019re from Austria. He said it was Hertzbaugh. You know.\nI mean this is the way it worked. Yes, that\u2019s the end of Ritchie.\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Hans Tuch. This is track number two and we were talking about Camp Ritchie\nand you said you stayed there for six weeks.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 29\nHans Tuch: Yes, I should \u2014",
        "A: I should interpret. I had no feeling or connection to Germany. I was absolutely an American\ncitizen. I was an American. The fact that I had a German background really came only into play\nbecause I was in Camp Ritchie and I spoke German. I had no feeling at all of having been a\nGerman citizen at one time. Forgotten that you know. I mean I was, I felt absolutely and\nthoroughly as an American, just like any other American. And by that time I probably didn\u2019t\nhave much of an accent anymore. Maybe slightly. But which I still have. But or we, which has\ncome back in my old age. I mean I notice it myself being sort of a linguist that Ihave. My,\nactually my accent sort of returns slightly now. Yeah.\nBut I had actually no feeling of ever having been a German you know at that time. I was\nso Americanized from Kansas City, Middle Western kid. And psychologically the other thing\nbeing going to Kansas City immediately in the Middle West I was thrown into an American\nMiddle Western family. There were no other German refugees around me. I had to learn English\nand I was, I had nobody to speak German with. So I didn\u2019t and I you know only spoke English,\nlearned to speak English. And I was if you, if I landed in New York and lived in New York\namong other refugees, I would have felt like Kissinger you know. With a German accent and so\nforth. I deliberately tried to lose my German accent because I didn\u2019t want to be, I wanted to be\nwith you know integrated so to speak.\nAnd therefore I had really lost any contact with Germany. My mother, for just a year, you\nknow a year and a half and then she left and she came to the United States. So my, I had\nabsolutely no feeling or contact for having really been a German. I was thoroughly\nAmericanized. And I never had anybody really to speak German with or to exper -- have related\nexperiences with and I didn\u2019t know anybody who \u2014 because I was thoroughly Americanized and\nmy family was American. My uncle was the only one who spoke German, well a little bit of\nGerman. And he was gone all day long.\nSo I was, I was Americanized and I had no feeling, not being an American.

And she said she spoke a little German but she\nspoke no English until she was six years old, she told. I mean told me. And so she understood\nGerman. For me as a 14 year old and she was wonderful, just a terrific person. And she was\nfairly young. I mean she was in her 30s at the time. So as a housekeeper in the family. And but\nunderstood me and she was really a great guide for me. and we became very close friends, until\nshe died.",

And then got an assignment to\ngo to England to be overseas into a intelligence replacement camp in Broadway in\nWorcestershire. We went by troop ship and that was a real troop ship. It was during the time\nwhen there was in the north Atlantic it was so. And we were very crowded in this troop ship. We\nwere stacked up four in a level. And kept at night, you know it was dark and so forth and it was,\nI mean it was pretty crowded.\nAnd we got to Broadway, to England and we went to Broadway in Worcestershire and it\nwas a very nice place.

        "A: And we were sent off to Leicestershire where the 101\u201c Airborne division was located, waiting\nfor, to for the invasion. I mean \u2014 no actually not. We went to Leicestershire and there was a sort\nof an ad hoc training camp for paratroopers. And I think yeah, the training camp was actually\nmaintained by the 82\" division. It was in Leicestershire. And we had seven days of nothing but\nphysical training. Seven, eight hours a day of physical training. And only jumped from\nplatforms. Learned how to jump from platforms. And the second week, five days, every day to\njump out of an airplane. Locally. And they took us up in the airplanes and the US Army had\npurchased a number of farms which were the landing areas.\nAnd we were told that when we jumped we had to jump in that area because if we\njumped across into another farm, they had to buy the farm or something like that. And so for five\ndays, we jumped, one jump a day. And we were qualified. One of which was a night jump and\nthat was scary. So we jumped. And then we were assigned to the 101\u201c Airborne division which\nwas south of London. In the area of Redding. In various camps because \u2014 and there we were\nwaiting for the invasion. I mean for the date and we jumped in Normandy.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 33",
        "A: June sixth, June. We jumped before H hour. We landed you know two hours before H hour,\nyeah.",
        "A: No we were a soldier and this was part of, we were going to invade France you know and go\nin there. And the only thing and this is a story that I\u2019ve told and it is known, a little anecdote. We\nwere in this plane, the 20 people, 24 people in the plane. And we were flying towards the\ncontinent at night. With the plane had no doors because paratroopers, planes with paratroopers\nhad no doors. They were open because they couldn\u2019t, they so you just and there was a lot of\nnoise. And we were scared as hell. And we had been issued just before we left, new first aid.\nEverybody had first aid kits on their helmets. You know just strapped to their helmets. We had\nbeen issued new first aid kits which had a vial of morphine in them because if you jumped and\ngot hurt that you could inject yourself with morphine.\nWe were flying towards Normandy at night, scared. And somebody in our plane said\nwhy wait until you get hurt to use morphine and the whole plane broke open their first aid kits\nwith the vials and we jabbed our next door neighbor with morphine and all of us went out of the\nplane when we jumped, feeling no pain.",
        "A: We landed, well I don\u2019t know exactly where we landed but our landing area was a, the city\nwas Carentan, Omaha Beach. Near Omaha Beach, a little bit inland. Carentan. We were\nsupposed to land and make, keep the road, block the road from German replacements from\ncoming into that area and replace German. That was our mission. And whether we accomplished\nthis or not, I have no idea.\nBut I must say that we had no idea where we were when we landed. When we landed.\nFortunately the assistant division commander of the 101\u2018 Airborne division by the name of\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 34\nHiggins, apparently knew where we were and he sort of took us in hand and we managed to get\nyou know, do our thing. The interesting thing about the Normandy landing. We were in combat\nonly for nine days. And that was the plan, That the paratroopers would land. We had no\nequipment. We had no food with us or anything with us because we were supposed to be there\nfor eight or nine days. I mean we had a little bit of food with us. No equipment. But were to be\ntaken out immediately when the area was secured. And that is what happened. We were there I\nthink for nine days. And went back to England.\nAnd stayed in England, in that area.",
        "A: Yeah, a few. I mean they were as scared as we were, when \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no. I was an American. I mean none whatsoever, none whatsoever. The German\nwas the enemy. The fact that I was of German origin. No, I was an American. And \u2014",
        "A: We took a few, we took a few prisoners and interrogated them. But it was really purely\ntactical interrogation. Where do you come from? What is the name of your unit? How many are\nin your unit? And things like that, just very simple questions. Because it was a very fluid\nsituation. But we actually got taken out very quickly. And went back to England and then we\nwaited. We were in England. I was in the Redding area in a camp until the Holland invasion, in\nSeptember 17\" I believe. September 17\" was the invasion of Holland. And that was a more\ndifficult jump because it was day time. And there were, the other thing I wanted to mention is\nwe also had glider troops. The 101\u201c Airborne division had a glider regiment and I was actually\nassigned to the glider regiment but as a jumper. And the replacements that we got after combat\nand injured were all soldiers who were from the glider regiment, because the gliders were much\nmore dangerous than jumping. You know and so people, you had to volunteer to be a jumper,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 35\nbut to be a glider rider, you were assigned. So after the Normandy invasion all the survivors of\nglider volunteered to become paratroopers because 1t was so much more dangerous to be a glider\nrider. And so we went into Normandy, into Holland and we, the 101\u201c Airborne Division was\nsituated around Eindhoven. The 82\" Division was Nijmagen and the Sixth British Paratroop\ndivision was across the river. I can\u2019t remember. And that was the occasion where the British\nwere annihilated. And the reason they were annihilated is we were supposed to, three divisions\nwere supposed to jump and maintain the road open for the second British army to move through\nand across the line and liberate Holland. What happened is Marshall Montgomery apparently\njust, they were so slow. And here we were holding the road open and the British came and they\nstopped and they had tea in the afternoon. They stopped, got off their tanks. And sat with us and\nhad tea and then they never made it to, to Arnhem. Arnhem. They never made it and the British\nwere annihilated across the river. The whole division was and it was, the reason was that\nMontgomery never came and did that. We were in Holland for 70 days. We were supposed to\nbe there for ten days at the most and then again were to be removed. We stayed there for 70 days.\nAnd the big problem was food. Because we hadn\u2019t brought any food with us. And we literally\nlived off the land. And the land were apple orchards. This whole area were in that part around\nEindhoven were apple orchards. And we lived off apples. And so did the local population\nbecause they didn\u2019t have anything much either.\nSo what there was of farmers and people who were around, they couldn\u2019t give us\nanything. For once in a while, they got a chicken or something like that but we were there for 70\ndays and before we were taken out. And brought back to rest camp in France called near Rels\n[ph] called Mumalo le Grand [ph]. That was our camp, was a French, old French, French camp\nwith actually straw mattresses still. And we were there briefly and then started to Bastogne to\ncounterattack, the British counter attacked and we went to Bastogne, and were there throughout\nthe siege of Bastogne.\nWe went there on the 18\" of December, 17\" of December and then we were completely\nisolated and Eisenhower declared Bastogne the expendable to stay there and not give up. We\nwere completely surrounded by Germans. And it was General Patton, the Third army decided he\nwas not going to, what Eisenhower had determined to make us expendable. He decided that he\nwas going to send in a tank battalion to rescue us. And that tank battalion was headed by Colonel\nAbrams who was later General Abrams, in Korea. And they came through with his tank\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 36\nbattalion and on Christmas morning reached us. And broke through the German \u2014 the Germans\nhad us completely surrounded and we didn\u2019t take any prisoners there because we were going to\nbe their prisoners. And my one claim to fame in the army was when they came to have a\nsurrender, the 101 Airborne surrender. I was working on, I mean I was with my colonel by the\nname of Harper, I was a regimental commander and we were actually right across from division\nheadquarters. And they sent, the Germans sent in a team to make a surrender. And what\nhappened was the surrender, the team two officers and two enlisted men were held when they\ncame across with the white flag. And they were held in an outpost. And brought in the letter to\nsurrender and my colonel and I were with our division commander. At the time was, he was\nassistant division commander because General Taylor was in Washington at the time. I mean he\nwas not there. And McAuliffe was the assistant division commander. And so they presented this\nsurrender demand to the commander and General McAuliffe and I were standing by them. He\nsaid oh nuts, what am I going to tell them. And no idea of \u2014 he said oh nuts, what am I going to\ntell them. And Colonel Kennard, his chief of staff stood by him and said tell them just what you\njust said. He said what did I say. He said you said nuts. He said all right, ok, nuts. And he\nwrote it out nuts. And then he sent my colonel, Colonel Harper and me back to the surrender\nplace with the German officers, two German officers waiting. And we went down there and\nhanded them the slip which said nuts. And the German officers said in German, what 1s this?",
        "A: Nuts. I said, what is nuts. I said go to hell. And that you know that became the translation of\nnuts. And that was the end of that. They left and then on Christmas morning we were liberated\nand we had not been able to be supplied by air because the weather was very bad. It was snowing\nand raining. And on Christmas morning there was bright sunshine. And suddenly the C-47\"\ncame over massively, throwing down medical supplies. Food. And everything, all of a sudden\non Christmas morning. It was great.\nAnd then after a few days we were sent, we were liberate -- No, we were there for\nanother week or so. And then we moved out of Bastogne and we moved by that time we were\nvery much emaciated. I mean troop wise, we were one third of our strength. We moved over to\nthe right and down the line on the west side of the line, we moved down. We saw no combat.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 37\nPractically no combat. It was towards the end of the war. The last three weeks of the war. And\nwe went, we moved down and ended up on the day that the war ended, on May 6 at\nBerchtesgaden. We actually took Berchtesgaden. There was nothing to take. And being still\nprisoner of war specialists we headed immediately for Hitler\u2019s, and we went up to the Berghof\nand then we wanted to get up to the Eagle\u2019s Nest and we found out that we were not the first.\nThere was a French company that had preceded us and they had gone up to the Eagle\u2019s Nest and\ntaken all kinds of furniture and equipment and thrown it down the elevator shaft that had been\nthe elevator. So we had to crawl up there by foot to get to the Eagle\u2019s Nest. There was nothing\nthere anymore. But they had managed to throw stuff down the elevator shaft so you couldn\u2019t use\nthe elevator to the Eagle\u2019s Nest. That\u2019s the end of that story.\nAnd then we were there for about a month. Oh we ended up in the Berchtesgaden Hof\nwhich 1s the fancy hotel in Berchtesgaden. And we were there for I think four days. When we\nwere kicked out of the Berchtesgaden Hof and all the high level POWs, the generals and the\nministers that were captured around there were put into the Berchtesgaden Hof. This is where\nthey held them as prisoners.\nAnd we were in a hotel across from the Berchtesgaden Hof which was a lovely sort of a\ncountry hotel with cabins, you know individual cabins. And we landed in that hotel and we gave\nthe proprietor and the kitchen staff all of our K rations and everything we had and they provided\nus with food for a month.",
        "A: Not, in, after we got to Berchtesgaden it was over with. We were, as a matter of fact we were\nput in charge of securing Berchtesgaden but there was nothing to secure. You know, no problems\nat all.",
        "A: The prisoners were taken, we were not involved, not involved at all. Those were by that time\nyeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 38",
        "A: Well then briefly the 101\u2018 Airborne Division was taken south to Bad Gastein in Austria\nwhich is about an hour south of Salzburg. And we were there briefly and then I was detached. I\nwas able, because I had had enough points being in these various combat situation and having\ngotten by that time a Bronze star, and combat infantry badge. I had enough points to be one of\nthe first to get out. So I was sent back to a camp near Paris, Le Desine [ph], a suburb of Paris\nand I was there for about a week and then was shipped home. And I was actually got home by\nDecember eighth. You know I was one of the first people in my own acquaintance to get out of\nthe army and get back. And then I immediately enrolled back to go to college on the first of\nJanuary I was back in school. Most of my friends and relatives were, like Jeff, they were not\nhome yet.",
        "A: When I finished college in University of Kansas City I was persuaded by my, Henry Bertram\nHill. History professor. He said I should try to get to graduate school. At the school of\nadvanced, he suggested it was the school of advanced international studies.",
        "A: Which became Johns Hopkins. At that time it was still independent. And they had a summer\nschool in Peterborough, New Hampshire and occupied the residence of a women\u2019s boarding\nschool. I think they had Kendall Hall School for Girls or something in Peterborough, New\nHampshire. And I was admitted only for summer school. I was not admitted for the actual\ncollege at that time. So I went up there and don\u2019t think I distinguished myself academically.\nHowever, on the weekend before the fourth of July in some reason or other, the cooks of the\nschool quit. Left. And left, the school was without a cook for the long weekend. For the Fourth\nweekend. So before they could go down to Boston to hire a new chefs for that weekend, I\nvolunteered to cook for the school. And I think that is what got me into graduate school for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 39\nnext year because they couldn\u2019t refuse my application. So I went to SIAS and at the first week in\nWashington, my wife Mimi had come down. She had been graduated from Carleton College. She\nhad sort of a record there. She had a absolute A, four years of nothing but A\u2019s. She made Phi\nBeta Kappa in her junior year. And she was a valedictorian of her class. She had actually\nliterally never had anything but an A as long as she was going to school, until graduate school\nand we had met and that\u2019s when she got her first B and she blamed me for that.\nAnd so we really started going with one another after the first week at SIAS and we got\nour master\u2019s degrees.",
        "A: I looking for a job, I was hired by the Chase National Bank. And went into a program in\nNew York in international banking, training at the bank. And I was trained for, paid $200 a\nmonth plus lunch which was very important for ten months and then I was assigned to go to\nGermany where they had three branches, primarily serving the military in Germany, primarily.\nNot completely.\nBut they had three branches in Germany \u2014 in Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Munich. And I\nwent there and Mimi and I had decided rather than getting married in Washington and then\nimmediately being separated because there was no housing available, that we would wait, that I\nwould go over there and I would find housing for us and then she would come over if we married\nand live happily ever after. I went to Stuttgart and most of my customers were military. And\nthrough them I got a place, an apartment to live and I was going to be able to have an apartment\nand so I told the bank that I was bringing my fianc\u00e9e over and they said oh no you can\u2019t get\nmarried for three years. I said what? Says yes, we want to be able to move you around to the\nother branches, you can\u2019t get married. And I walked out of the bank, not having enough money\nto get back to the United States.\nFortunately the State Department was taking over from military government the\nadministration in Germany. In other words, we were establishing an embassy for military\ngovernment and they were hiring people on the spot and they preferred hiring people who had\nnot been with military government. And so I was hired. Practically from one day to the next and\nthey wanted to put me in finance and I didn\u2019t want to be in finance. I had been working for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 40\nbank and I didn\u2019t want to be in finance. So I was told that you don\u2019t want to be in finance. Would\nyou like to be in cultural and press affairs. And having been journalistically trained and worked\na little bit in journalism, I said yes. So they sent me out to Bad Hamburg which is a suburb of\nFrankfurt where there was to be the headquarters of the America house program in Germany.\nAnd the director of that program was a woman by the name of Patricia Van Douten and you go\nout and see her and maybe you\u2019ll get hired. So I went out there to and couldn\u2019t\u2019 see her but I was\nadmitted to her deputy, Max Kimenthal. And as we started to talk I had no idea what an America\nHouse was. This was an America House program. I didn\u2019t even know what an America House\nwas. But I was there to be interviewed. And he started talking to me and had a telephone call.\nAnd he said excuse me for five minutes. I\u2019m going to have to go out and see someone, but why\ndon\u2019t you sit here at the coffee table and then whatever you have, read and I'll be back in five\nminutes.\nAnd there was a paper which said the future of the America House program in Germany\nby Patricia Van Douten. I said so I can read this and see what, I write it. He came back and he\nsaid if you were a director of an America House what would you want to do. And I just\nregurgitated what I was reading and he stopped me after about four or five minutes and he says\njust a moment Mr. Tuch, I want to \u2014 and he came back, went out and came back with Patricia\nVan Douten who was a formidable middle aged woman and would you start again Mr. Tuch.\nAnd I told the story and they hired me on the spot. I was sworn in that day. It took me two years\nto admit to Pat Van Douten what I had done. But that\u2019s the way I got into the foreign service. I\nwas temporary and then after two years I took the exam and then I became a foreign service\nofficer.\nThe action by \u2014 or the same day that I was sworn in, another young man was also sworn\nin and his name was Natel, Wallace W. Natel. We were sworn in on the same day and were he\nwas just a year or two older than I was. But we were given certain rank, very low rank, the\nequivalent of a second lieutenant type of thing. But he wasn\u2019t even given that because he had\nbeen a conscientious objector in the war and he had been a fire fighter, a paratroop fire fighter in\nColorado. So a fellow paratrooper. So we immediately became close friends because we both\nwere paratroopers. And we remained friends our whole life. And he was assigned to Darmstadt\nand I to Wiesbaden and after three months he went to Hanover and I went to Frankfurt and that\u2019s\nhow he became.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 41",
        "A: I start, as I said I started out in Wiesbaden. After three months was assigned to Frankfurt to\nrun the America house which was the US Information Center there. I was there for five years.\nAnd the reason I was assigned to Frankfurt 1s that the then director of the Frankfurt America\nhouse who was a frustrated conductor of music, musician. With the budget for his information\ncenter he went out and hired himself an orchestra and performed a performance with himself as\nthe conductor. He was fired the next day. Those were days when you know nothing was\npermanent. And I was assigned to replace him from Frankfurt. We were there for five years.\nAnd then I was in Washington and my job there became President Eisenhower had given his\natoms for peace speech and that became a major program issue, atoms for peace. And I was\nassigned to build atoms for peace exhibits in Japan, in India and Portugal and I was doing that.\nAnd at the end of that we were starting to assign officers to the Iron Curtain countries. And I\nvolunteered immediately for the Soviet Union. And I was given Russian language training. And\nthe State Department at that time did not have a good Russian language program so I was made\nan exception and I was sent to CIA which had a marvelous program.\nAnd at that time the CIA language program was in one of the temples behind the Lincoln\nMemorial on Ohio drive. And I started there and we were 12 students. I was the only outsider\nand we had five instructors. It was a marvelous course. We had five linguists. These were all\nRussian linguists of different backgrounds. There was a lawyer and different, and one linguist.\nAnd we were allowed to speak English only with the linguist, with the Russian lang -- And we\nhad two students and one linguist and we changed every hour for five hours every day. So the\ntwo of us were with a different linguist and the sixth hour was with the linguist. Well I was there\nfor a week and suddenly word came down that I wasn\u2019t allowed to be there, at CIA. I wasn\u2019t\nallowed to know who people were.\nAnd they finally compromised. Since I had already been with my five colleagues for a\nweek, they finally compromised that I could stay there but I couldn\u2019t go into the cafeteria. So for\na year I had to bring my own lunch and I couldn\u2019t go into the cafeteria. But I had a terrific\nexperience in learning Russian.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 42",
        "A: And then I went, then for about a year they wouldn\u2019t give me the Russians, the Soviets\nwouldn\u2019t give me a visa because I was with this spy organization, USIA. So I resigned from\nUSIA. I was commissioned in the State Department. Before that happened I was actually, I was\nwith the Voice of America in Munich. As a correspondent and as a writer of commentaries and a\ncorrespondent in Munich with the Voice. And then finally I got a visa and was assigned in\nAugust 1958. August 58 I was assigned to Moscow. And we were there and I was the first\npublic affairs officer, the first we didn\u2019t call them that. I was the first cultural and press attach\u00e9 in\nMoscow since World War II. The first one because there was a break sort of in the ice. There\nhad been the Camp David meeting between Eisenhower and then Khrushchev had been to the\nUnited States and so they thought that there may be a break and we had signed the first US,\nUSSR cultural agreement in January of 1958. And I was there to, was assigned to carry out that\nprogram in August 58. And that\u2019s when we started having exchange programs.\nAnd actually my experience from then on is in my last book. And I was thinking I should\nprobably donate a copy of that book to the Holocaust Museum and give it to you and here it 1s.\nThis is my last book, my fourth book. And everything that transpired from Moscow onward is in\nthat book. My foreign service experience and so forth.",
        "A: I retired in January 85. We served in Moscow for three years. There had been a strict State\nDepartment rule that foreign service officers should not serve longer than two years at that time\nbecause of the Cold War situation. But Tommy Thompson, our American ambassador, such a\nmarvelous person, always thought that two years is too short a time for us really to get involved\nand he asked, since I was actually still in USIA, I had been over. He asked George Allen who\nwas the director of USIA and a former ambassador, and foreign service officer and a close friend\nof Tommy Thompson. He asked him whether he could ask me to stay a third year. Unbeknownst\nto me.\nAnd he said yes of course and so Tommy Thompson asked me whether I would be\nwilling to stay for a third year. And I felt so flattered to be asked anything by Tommy\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 43\nThompson, I immediately said yes. And then I went home to confront Mimi and our two little\nchildren. But she was at that time such a conservative in her life style and even politically at that\ntime, she thought anything is better than a change. So let\u2019s stay for a third year. And we were\nthe first family to stay in Moscow for three years, which of course 1s standard now. It became\nstandard and so we stayed there for a third year. Then I came back to Washington and I became -\n- Ed Murrow was the director of USIA and I became one of his assistants, responsible for the\nSoviet Union at least in Europe and I was that for three years. I mean actually more. He died, he\npassed away.\nAnd then I was under, and I assigned myself since I was in charge of Soviet Union and\nEastern Europe I assigned myself to be public affairs officer in Warsaw. I went and stayed in the\narea, and we had a fairly large program in Warsaw and I wanted to go to Warsaw. And Mimi\nand I studied Polish for several months and the new director of USIA came in, Carl Rowan,\nformer you know. And he says he wouldn\u2019t let me go to Warsaw. You have to stay here in this\njob. Because there is nobody to replace you. So I stayed. I didn\u2019t go to Warsaw, but the next\nyear I assigned myself again to Warsaw and we studied Polish again. By that time Carl Rowan\nhad left and Leonard Marx became the director of USIA. And Leonard Marx called me in and\nsays I\u2019m going to make a proposal to you, an offer to you that you can\u2019t refuse. And I said\nwhat\u2019s that. I was ready to go to Warsaw. Within about three weeks. And he said you\u2019re going\nto go as deputy chief of mission to Bulgaria. To Sofia. And I couldn\u2019t refuse that.\nSo Mimi and I studied Bulgarian for two weeks. And went off to Sofia and where I was\nDCM, Deputy Chief of Mission. But we didn\u2019t have an embassy yet. We had a legation. So I\nwas consul of legation. And the minister who became a very close friend of mine, had to leave\nafter one year. He was recalled. It was a, well it\u2019s ok. He had an accident where he killed a\npedestrian when he was driving an embassy car. And this went on and the Bulgarians were awful\nabout this. There\u2019s this American killing our children and so forth. And he was finally withdrawn\nand I was charg\u00e9 of the legation for a long period because the person who was to replace him,\nJack McSweeney, didn\u2019t want to come to Sofia as a minister. He wanted to be an ambassador.\nAnd so he delayed and delayed and they finally told him if you don\u2019t go to Sofia, we\u2019re going to\ncancel your assignment and he finally came which was about five months, six months later. And\nso he came. And after Sofia, I got a plush post. I got to be PA or Public Affairs officer in Berlin,\nmy home town. And we were in Berlin for three years and we had a really personally a\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 44\nwonderful time because theater, opera, everything was just gravy. However, the job was, became\nreally terrible because the situation in Germany, in Berlin specifically had turned entirely where\nthe young Berliners felt that we were, became the enemy in Berlin. And that\u2019s quite a bit in the\nbook. And the situation that developed and working in Berlin became very, very difficult. And\nfrustrating.\nAnd it really didn\u2019t turn around. Well after Berlin, oh after Berlin we \u2014",
        "A: No, not yet.",
        "A: 67 to \u2014 yeah, after Berlin we, I was assigned as diplomat in residence at the Fletcher School\nof Diplomacy. And after that we, well I was, that was a two year assignment and I only lasted\none year because I was called back to become deputy director of the Voice of America and then\nalmost very shortly thereafter, acting director of the Voice of America. And after that\nassignment, three years and I was, that was one of my fascinating assignments for me. Because I\nhad been with the Voice as a correspondent in 1957 before going to Moscow, so I was really\ncoming home to the Voice. And running the Voice to me was a wonderful assignment. A\ndifficult one but a wonderful assignment and I really, because journalism was really my thing.\nAnd I felt that this was a wonderful assignment. And after the Voice of America I decided well \u2014\noh I was an inspector. I became chief inspector of the USIA and I inspected Brazil. And being in\nBrazil four months, I decided that was going to be my next post. You know completely different\nand they said well you can\u2019t go to Brasilia. You speak Russian, German, French. You don\u2019t have\nPortuguese. I said --. I never did learn it very well. But we were in Brazil for five years. And\nwith a marvelous, who became a very close friend, with a marvelous person who was our\nAmerican ambassador in Brazil by the name of Crimmens, Jack Crimmens. And he was a career\nofficer. And while we were there, should I go on.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 45",
        "A: After Brazil.",
        "A: After Brazil we were in Bonn. And we were in Bonn for four and a half years and that\u2019s\nwhen I retired.",
        "A: The thing is I felt like practically, probably like any other American because I had had no\npersonal losses in the Holocaust. So I thought what had happened was horrible and I was aware\nof death camps. I mean the concentration camps. We were, I was never in a concentration camp.\nYes, I was in Dachau but only visited it. I mean I saw what was, but it never professionally.\nAnd so I felt really just like any other American did. I had no personal losses so therefore this\nwas not a felt like maybe just like you. You know like any other person.",
        "A: Even though I was born in Berlin, I had no, I had no feeling being personally involved and\nagain I think the main thing was that I had no direct personal losses. I felt like any other\nAmerican who looked at this horrible thing that had happened. No, the aftermath. But it wasn\u2019t\nanything personal.",
        "A: It had really nothing to do. I wrote a paragraph about my being Jewish. I personally feel that I\nwas brought -- I was brought up Jewish. I, as my religion. My ethnic or I was German and I was\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 46\nJewish because, by religion. After I left my Jewish feelings or beliefs, I\u2019m actually I\u2019m an\natheist by \u2014 I had no feeling about being in any way related to being Jewish. My Jewish was not\nethnic at all. My Jewish, this was my religion. As others are Catholic, as others are Protestant.\nSo when I feel that my entire background is German. And I have never identified in any way\nwith being Jewish at this stage.",
        "A: They were, actually Mimi was a Methodist, she\u2019s Christian and they were both baptized, but\nboth entirely left any religious feelings. They have no religion at all, either one of them as adults.\nBut they went to Sunday school you know as kids.",
        "A: I feel, I have a deep feeling the fact that the post war German government starting with\nAdenauer and subsequently have done a terrific job of redemocratizing their society. And\nbecoming a valued member of the international democratic community. I don\u2019t necessarily agree\nwith individual policies of the German government, especially now. But I feel sociologically\nand historically they have done a terrific job with the help of the United States. I must say what\nthe United States, what we did in the 1950s to reintegrate Germany into the international\ndemocratic society was also a very tough and very remarkable job, where we helped the\nGermans do it. I mean they had to do it themselves but we gave them a tremendous amount of\nassistance in doing it.\nAnd were very successful and were appreciated by the Germans for doing that. I would\nsay in the 19, especially in the 1950s. Until the early 1960s and I just have felt very personally\ncommitted to participating in the reorientation of the German society into a western democratic\nsociety. I mean that was a very, I\u2019m grateful for that and I participated in this. And I think 1t was\nsuccessful and I actually wrote about this, well it\u2019s in this book. But it\u2019s more actually in my\nprevious book which is on public diplomacy and is a \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 47",

But I\u2019m not sure that other societies are aware and have learned from it.\nYou know what is happening in Africa and other societies. I don\u2019t think so. But I know we have\nand I think most people in Europe have also but I\u2019m not sure that other societies have. As a\nmatter of fact I feel not.",
        "A: Oh it\u2019s a great institution. I think it\u2019s a marvelous institution. And actually what they do in\ntheir out, yeah is wonderful and yeah it\u2019s great. I just have not been like the Ritchie boys and\nanything with the US Army is sort of lost on me, but that\u2019s ok. But I, and the other thing 1s that I\nthink some people will disagree with me on this but I have no feeling of either having been a\nGerman or Jewish. I think personally \u2014",
        "A: Iam an American of German origin. That\u2019s the way I feel you know. Of German origin. And\nI think as I said in the beginning, I think my father, it was inculcated by my father because we\nnever discussed when I was a child. But he also felt so strongly about being a German. World\nWar I veteran.",
        "A: No, no, no. He was, the only time that I ever felt him being Jewish is on the holidays period.",
        "A: Iam very critical of Israeli politics. I felt that the establishment of Israel, Zionism was a\nabsolutely marvelous thing and a very, for the world a very, very positive development. I\ndisagree very much with Israeli politics at the moment. I have close relatives. I have a cousin in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nNovember 7, 2013 48\nJerusalem. Actually the cousin, he passed away last year but he was a very well-known\nphysiologist who came to the United States I think almost every year to lecture at different\nuniversities. And his claim to fame was that when the hiyacking of the first TWA plane, he was\nthe one hostage that they kept. They kept him and he was finally released. He was exchanged.\nFinally was a TWA flight that was I think was in I think Lebanon. And he was the first hostage\nof the plane. But his wife who was a cousin once removed of mine, about ten years younger.\nShe is. And we are in touch with one another.",
        "A: Yes. I visited, Mimi and I visited them when my mother\u2019s younger sister who lived in\nJerusalem was still alive. We went there for her 90\" birthday. I had my mother\u2019s oldest brother,\nthe physician moved with his family and his mother with his wife to Tel Aviv. Their children,\ntwo boys, I have lost complete touch with them. And it\u2019s their fault. I tried my damnedest to be\nin touch with them. They just don\u2019t answer. And when my aunt who happened to be my favorite\naunt, their mother, died in Tel Aviv, they didn\u2019t even call me about it. I found out from my\ncousin in Jerusalem about it and I was mad. And because when we visited Israel we visited Tel\nAviv and we were with them but they just decided not to be in touch with me.",
        "A: During the Eichmann trial, I mean it was the worst that could come. I mean what happened\nto him was actually the right thing and what the Mossad did in getting him fine, great. You\nknow just like picking up Osama Bin Laden. But no I just, I feel that our Secretary of State in\ncurrently in his efforts to get the \u2014 is fighting an uphill battle and I so disagree with Israeli\npolitics at the moment. And I must say I disagree with the American, the lobby.",

        "A: If you want to take a look at this book. And before, and add it to the library. It 1s very\nanecdotal and I did mention the fact that I had the feeling that 1f my father had lived we would\nhave never come out of this alive. But no I think what you\u2019re doing, I think is \u2014 what I did do\nparticipate. Do you know Edith Fierst [ph]. She lives here and I worked with her on the ten years\nago when we started this program, I interviewed a couple of the people, and my job really was to\ntry to place the tapes in schools and I did manage it in Kansas City. I worked with her at that.\nShe\u2019s marvelous and she\u2019s still very with it. She runs our public affairs program here. Edith\ndoes. So at any rate I feel what you\u2019re doing 1s terrific because you are getting at people and their\nexperiences. I mean I don\u2019t think I have terribly much to contribute to this program.\n"
