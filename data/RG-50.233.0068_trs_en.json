        "UNAUTHENTICATED\nINTERVIEW WITH FANNY LEBOVITS\nTELEPHONE-TONY YOUNG\nOkay, we\u2019re ready. Let me ask you a few questions. Why don\u2019t we start with your parents?\nThat will be the easiest thing, | think.\nTony, | better go into another room now.\nOkay, that\u2019s fine.\nNo, it\u2019s okay now, he closed the door.\nIt\u2019s alright? Okay. Let me ask you about your parents first. Why don\u2019t you just state for the\ntape, their names, their full names and where, if you can remember, where and when they\nborne\nMy father\u2019s name was Herman Judelowitz and | don\u2019t need to tell you the spelling.\nRight, | have the spelling.\nHe was born in Latvia, | think, in Aizpute or Hazenpot.\nCan you spell that for me?\nDo you want the spelling as they write it now or the way |\u2014we were very Germanized.\nWhy don\u2019t you give them both to me? Both spellings.\nWell Aizpute is A-i-z-p-u-t-e and then you could write down, maybe in parentheses, Hazenpot,\nH-a-z-e-n-p-o-t. That was a small town near Liepaja, L-i-e-p-a-j-a, Latvia which is (21)\nin German. He was born there, | think in 1896.\nDo you remember the birthdate?\nNo.\nOkay. How about your mother?\nMy mother was born in Liepaja in Latvia and | think my mother must have been born in 1899 or\n1900 but | think more like 1899. Her name was Sarah Gamper, G-a-m-p-e-r.\n1\nLebovits, Fanny Intrvw (Tony Young)",
        "Let me start with your father. Did he tell you anything about him growing up, about things he\nused to do before the war and before he got married? Things like that about his childhood, do\nyou remember anything that he might have told you?\nYeah. He was one of nine children. In fact his mother had ten children but the first-born died\nand then my father was born. So he was the oldest of nine.\nHis parents, what did they do for a living?\nHis parents had, | think they had a bakery in this small town, in Hazenpot. They had a bakery.\nThey both ran it, as far as you remember?\nMy grandmother baked and | think they had a bakery and a grocery store.\nDo you know if they ran it out of the house or if they had a store?\n| think it was more like\u2014not out of the house\u2014but the store was there and then maybe in the\nback was a house. But I\u2019m not too sure about that. It was, they had a bakery and it was a small\ntown, more like a village. At that time when my father was born and | think it was a grocery\nshop and their living quarters were in the back.\nWas your father\u2014let\u2019s see. He would have been probably an age to be involved in World War I?\nYeah.\n| Was he a veteran?\nYes, he went to war once, enlisted | suppose, and was captured by the Germans. In fact, |\nbrought you a picture of him.\nIn the uniform?\nIn the uniform, remember it? At the back was his writing.\nThat\u2019s right. | remember that.\nSo he was captured in WWI.\nHe was in the Czarist\u2019s army, right? In the Russian army?\nWait a minute, yes he must have been in the Russian army, of course. He was captured by the\nGermans and he was a captive until the war ended, 1918. In fact, because he spoke German so\nwell, he was in charge of farms, for the baron in Germany. That\u2019s what he says here on the\n2",
        "card, on his picture he writes. When he came back in 1918, he fought for the liberation of\nLatvia.\nHe did?",
        "Yes, he was a liberation fighter, what we call in German, | don\u2019t know how you would call it in\nEnglish, Freiheikamster (62). Frei means liberty and Kam means fighter. He used to,\n| every year, they used to have a parade in our city. They used to celebrate liberation of Latvia. |",
        "Do you remember what the date of that was, the liberation?\n| know it was in 1918 but the date | don\u2019t remember. | should know because I\u2019m in school and it\nshows you it\u2019s 50 or whatever, more than 50, 60 years ago.\nThat\u2019s definitely something we can look up, that\u2019s no problem. Since he was in a German camp\nin WWI\u2014?\nWell, | wouldn\u2019t call it a camp.\nBut he was captured?\nOh, yeah. He was captured, he couldn't leave.\nBut he wasn\u2019t in a camp or anything?\nOh, no. He was working, he was in charge of a baron\u2019s farm. One of those big farms that the\nbarons had. He was in charge of those laborers and | supposed those laborers must have been\nprisoners-of-war. He was a prisoner-of-war.\nDid he ever say anything to you or do you remember anything about him talking about the\nGermans, what kind of people they may have been?\n| know that that particular baron was very good to him. When he came out, of course he was\nrather thin. But then he was a young man and very tall. My father was six-foot, just over six-\nfoot. But he said at the time that this baron was very kind to him. He was very lucky to have\u2014\nto do that. He was in charge of a little\u2014I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t have it that bad. In those days they\nadhered to International Red Cross rules.",
        "| Right, the conventions, sure.\nBut I didn\u2019t hear him say anything, | don\u2019t remember anyway hearing that he said anything bad\nat the time about the Germans. | know that he said that he was lucky at the time he was\ncaptured, because of his language and because he spoke such perfect German that he was in\ncharge of the (90).",
        "3",
        "Did your family speak German at home?\nYeah.\nThat was the main form of communication that you had at home, German?\nWe spoke German and Yiddish and we spoke Latvian. My parents spoke Russian.\nMulti-lingual family. When did your parents get married, do you remember?\n| think | was born maybe two years after they were married but I\u2019m not too sure about that.\nMaybe they were married in 1920 or in\u201921, maybe \u201921.\nWhat was your father doing after he came back and fought for the liberation in Latvia? What\ndid he settle down to work as, what was he doing for a living?\nHe was designing, making patterns for the tops of shoes. Like you make a pattern for a dress,\nmake a pattern for the part of the leather of the shoe, not the soles but a pattern for a shoe,\nwhich is then cut out of leather. So he learned to be a pattern-maker.\nHe hadn\u2019t studied to do that, he just apprenticed or something like that?\n| really don\u2019t know, maybe before the war he learned it already, he was apprenticing to do that.\nBut | know that that was his, that\u2019s what he was doing when | was growing up.\nDo you remember, did your parents ever tell you when you said in your testimony that your\n| father owned, well your parents owned a factory and also a workshop? A shoe factory and\nworkshop?",
        "_ In the workshop, what | meant by the workshop was mostly that there the patterns were made\nand the leather got to the workshop first. It was cut out and like shoes are made now of lots of\nfancy leather and all different colors and things, that\u2019s what they did in the workshop first and\nthen it went when it was all cut out and all kind of put in packages together or whatever, then it\nwent to the factory to be sold to together on lasts. What you call it, a last, right? And the\n| (123) we call itin German. Then you do make the sole, the sole when you make\nboots. First, you have the pattern, then you cut the leather and then you sew it. Then it will be\nthen, the bottom is done. Part of the bottom is done. You know it wasn\u2019t the kind of a factory\nlike on American standards, not such a one. We had quite a number of people working there\nbut it wasn\u2019t a huge, big factory. But in our instance, it was a factory. It wasn\u2019t one of those\nmodern, huge, big ones with thousands of people. We had also a shoe shop.",
        "A shoe shop, outside?\n4",
        "Yeah, we call it a store. My mother was in it and when we were kids sometimes after school we\nused to go there.\nWas that attached to the workshop, also?\nYeah, all like in one place. But my father also produced things for other people, for other shoe\nshops. That\u2019s why we called it a (141) you put your things for other people. So he\nproduced for other shoes shops, certain models, certain things that they wanted.\nYour parents had the factory and also the shoe shop as long as you can remember?\nOh, year, until the Russians came in.\nDuring the thirties, when you were a young girl, what were your parents doing? Was there\nanything of note that you remember going on at that time. Do you remember being frightened\nof what was going on in Germany at the time, your parents maybe?\nWell, we got to be\u2014. | remember when we got our first radio which was a telephone crystal\nradio. | think it was German or Polish, | think it was German. We were then very much more in\ntouch and antisemitism wasn\u2019t anything really that great news, new for us in Latvia because the\nLatvians too were great anti-Semites. They always had something bad to say about the Jews.\nThe Jews gave their lives to fight for their country, for our country, because we considered it our\ncountry. Like the Americans consider their country no matter where they come from and no\nmatter what their religious beliefs are. But many of the Latvians didn\u2019t think that way because\nthat\u2019s why\u2014they were terrible collaborators with the Germans. But even before in my\nchildhood, | want to tell you that |, myself, in my childhood when | was small, | can\u2019t really\nremember that anybody was hurting me or\u2014. They did say, you Jew, you Jew, or Zhid or\ndetrimental things about the Jews. But physically | was never hurt. | heard it but that was\nnothing that made such a great impression on me. Only when | started going to a Zionist\norganization, it made me more realize it. Then | really understood the difference, it\u2019s not that |\ndidn\u2019t understand the difference before but | didn\u2019t understand how detrimental it was and how\ndegrading they meant it. The name Jew is not a\u2014is just a description of some people but the",
        ": way they meant it, Zhid or whatever, they used to say it. I\u2019m sure you heard this from others.\nVery derogatory way.",
        "| Yes, derogatory is right. The thing is that | did, as a very young girl, | did have some little Latvian\nfriends that were neighbors. Because they lived in the same apartment house that | did which\nbelonged to my grandfather, my maternal grandfather, and we were little friends. But | never\nwent to a Latvian school, | went to Jewish school. | went to a Jewish high school and the only",
        "5",
        "time | really mixed with Jewish and non-Jewish teenagers or older a little bit teenagers is when |\nwent to university and nursing school.\nDo you remember, we were talking about anti-Semitism, do you remember any anti-Semitism\ndirected against your parents?\nNo, | can\u2019t remember.\nNothing overt that you remember?\nNot really that |remember. We were, my parents were Zionists too. | was brought up in that\natmosphere when | started to understand after | was five, six years, seven years old. Well, they\ndid talk about it | suppose, how nasty some of the Latvians are. But | can\u2019t, myself! can\u2019t think\nany particular incident. That\u2019s going too far back.\nNow you said your parents were also Zionist? Were they part of any groups or specific groups\nof Zionists?\nNo, not at the time. By saying Zionist, they\u2014.\nThat was just a particular viewpoint they had?\nIt was a viewpoint they had. We collected money for karen ayem (205) and we had one of\nthose little cans that we collected money for Israel at the time, to buy the land. Those boxes\nwhere we collected money so that the pioneers that went to Israel could buy land. They didn\u2019t\nhave money so the Jewish people all over the world had these little tins and one of them had\nthat viewpoint. Put constantly pennies or whatever else they had into the tins. Those were\nemptied out and that money was sent to Israel to buy land.\nIs this how that you got involved in the Zionist movement? Through your parents or was it more\nfrom your own?\n| don\u2019t know if they really pushed me but | was always in a Jewish circle and you know how boys\nand girls get together and you hear about different ideas. Time went on and Israel was more in\nour focus constantly. That\u2019s when | joined. Our parents encouraged us because for us there\nwas no, really no other outlet. We couldn\u2019t join the, shall we say, the Scouts or something like\nthose. We had to be on our own. In those time it was already kind of like a ghetto. They didn\u2019t\nforce into a ghetto but they didn\u2019t accept us.\nThey didn\u2019t associate with you?\nYeah, so we liked to be with our own.\n6",
        "Why don\u2019t you tell me a little bit about what your parents had to go through when the Russians\ncame in, in 1940?\nWell, the only thing what happened was, | was at the time in Riga. | was studying but they took\naway my parents\u2019 factory and the shop. My father had to give them the keys. They insisted that\nhe runs the place.\nHe had to continue to run it even though they had taken it away?\nYeah, continue running the place but it wasn\u2019t his place anymore. He had superiors to answer\nto.\nRight. | know that in some places, in Poland especially, the Russians, when they came in, seized\nmany people, especially intellectuals and what they termed enemies of the state and deported\nthem. Did that happen in Latvia also?\nIt did happen in Latvia, I\u2019ll tell you. It happened in Latvia a lot just before the Germans came in,\nin 1941. They deported a lot of people to Siberia and they started with the very, very wealthy\nones. | don\u2019t know if they went down by alphabet, | don\u2019t think so because | know some of my\nfriends, they were sent out. We were packed to go.\nThat\u2019s right. | remember you said something about that.\nWe were all packed to go but they didn\u2019t send us out.\nThey never came for you?\nNot yet, we were packed and | was working in the hospital. My parents didn\u2019t want to go\nwithout me. If the Russians would have come and forced them to go onto the trains and send\nthem out and | wouldn\u2018t have been there, then they would have had to go. But to go on their\nown, a lot of people were fleeing because the bombs were coming, the war was on. They were\ngoing all east. But when | wanted to go, | wasn\u2019t allowed to go because | was working in the\nhospital. They said if they find you on the way, you are a deserter and they'll shoot you on\nsight. Because being in the hospital, you were mobilized, you were like a soldier so | couldn\u2019t\nleave. My parents didn\u2019t go east and the Russians, at the time, didn\u2019t get to them to send them\nout. In fact, | had an aunt that was living with us at the time. She was rather wealthy, very\nwealthy too and she had packed her bags with her children and her husband. They didn\u2019t get to\nher either, the Germans killed her but they were all waiting to be sent out. Where they were\ngoing, they didn\u2019t know but they knew that they were being sent out to some kind of work\ncamps or whatever because they were considered the enemies of the state. But | want to tell\nyou that they didn\u2019t send them out that early. It was just before the Germans occupied Latvia.\n7",
        "Just before the war started?\nYeah, just before it. They came in, in June and | think they sent them out in about May or April, |\ndon\u2019t know when they started sending them out. I\u2019m really not familiar because | was working\nat the time. | don\u2019t know when it started but around that time. It was just before the Germans\noccupied Liepaja.\n| forgot to ask you a little bit earlier when we were talking. After your parents got married,\nwhen did they moved to Liepaja?\nLia-pa-yah. Well they married in Liepaja, they didn\u2019t really move, | suppose my father must have\nlived in Liepaja before they got married. |\n| So they just decided to settle in her hometown?\nYeah but my mother during the Second World War was in Russia.\nDuring the Second World War?\nYeah. No, the First World War, the First World War. No, the Second World War, she was\nunfortunately\u2014.\nShe was in Russia?\nYeah and she went to\u2014she used to play the piano...\nAnd that was in Russia?\nYeah, but she came back afterwards. | don\u2019t know if she came back still during the war or she\ncame back when the war was over, I\u2019m not sure about that.\nCan you describe to me what happened to your parents when the war with\u2014when Germany\ninvaded the Soviet Union and occupied Latvia? What happened then?\nAt Liepaja?\nRight.\nWell, they came in, in June and as soon as they in, they gave an order for all men at the age that\ncan work, to come to a platz (306), the huge big, you know what the platz is?\nUm-hm.\nThe place, the plaza. We used to have parades on that plaza, that place. All the men had to go\nthere and they rounded them up and they said that they would be sending them to work. But\n8",
        "of course we know that they never sent them. It was one month after the Germans came in\nthat my father went there and never came back. He was killed, they took them all to the forest\nand killed them. Made them dig their own graves and killed them. But we, at the time of this\nleaving, didn\u2019t know about that. We were hoping that they were sent to a labor camp; that\u2019s\nwhat the Germans kept on saying, they sent all the able men to work. That was the last time\nthat | saw my father.\nThat was one month after the Germans came and occupied Liepaja?\nYeah, the (326) at that time was 1000 left.\nWas that the first about\u2014when your father was taken, was that the first time that people had\nbeen rounded up, that men had been rounded up or was that one of the\u2014?\n| think that was the beginning. | don\u2019t know if it was a month or three weeks, or exactly but that\nwas the beginning. They gave an order, either in the newspaper or wherever, | don\u2019t remember\neven how the order came. But they knew that they had to, all the Latvian aisarte, the Latvians,\nthey organized, the anti-Semites, they had a military group which was called aisarge. You want\nto know how to spell it? | think it\u2019s a-i-s-a-r-g-e. This was a group that collaborated with the\nGermans, particularly well. They did the job better than the Germans sometimes. | think they\nwere the ones that came around to tell\u2014to round up the people, to find them whatever, with\nthe order of the Germans of course. But the ones that pushed and shoved at the time, to start\noff was the aisarge with one German overseeing. When they came to the platz, | understand, |\nwasn\u2019t there, there also were just several Germans, say like maybe ten Germans and maybe 100\naisarge. I\u2019m just giving you an instance, a proportion. These aisarge were Latvians, right?\nRight, | understood that. Was the aisarge like a military brigade or something?\nWas like a military group. | don\u2019t even know what | can compare it to here now, neo-nazis, but\nmuch more (364).\nThey were actually armed?\nYeah, much more visible. It was a big brigade. Have you heard of them before in any of your\ninterview?\nIf \u2019ve heard of them?\nYeah.\n| haven\u2019t heard of the actual, the name that you\u2019re telling me, the aisarge but I\u2019ve definitely\nheard of Latvians who collaborated with the Germans when they came into Latvia and also in\nother places but Latvia was definitely the place where there were many collaborationists. Let\n9",
        "me go back and get a little bit of background information about your mother. We've talked a\nlittle bit about your mother, along with your father obviously, but let me ask you a few\nquestions about her childhood, if you remember. Did she tell you anything about her childhood,\nabout how many brothers and sisters she had?\nYeah, | knew my uncles and aunts. She was one of four. She had another sister, | even\nremember her name. Do you want the name?\nSure.\nHer name was Yetta, Y-e-t-t-a. Elterman, E-I-t-e-r-m-a-n. That was her married name but she\nwas Yetta Gamper but her married name was Yetta Elterman. One uncle\u2019s name was Julius\nGamper and my other uncle\u2019s name was Willie Gamper, William, Willie in the German. My\nmother, | think, was the second one or the third one, I\u2019m not sure, in the family\u2014either the\nsecond or the third one. | know my aunt was the youngest. She had two boys.\nYetta did?\nYeah, well you know young children at the time the German occupation came. My other uncles\ndidn\u2019t live in Liepaja. My Uncle Julius lived in Hazenpot (402) and he had three sons. My other\nuncle, Willie, lived in Riga and he had four children. .\nWhat did your mother\u2019s parents do for a living?\nWell, my mother\u2019s parents also had a store, a shop. | really don\u2019t remember very well. | don\u2019t\nremember my maternal grandmother very well. | only remember her funeral somehow. | was\nabout ten years old at the time but of course | remember my grandfather very well because he\nlived with us. They had, at the time, then, he was already retired, he didn\u2019t work any more. But\n| think they had like a second-hand clothing store or something like that. Maybe they had new\nthings and second-hand things, I\u2019m not sure. But what they had, the apartment house that we\nlived in, belonged to my grandfather and my grandmother. They had some income from that. It\nwasn\u2019t an apartment house that he visualized it but it had some apartments. We lived in it too.\nlt was a two-story apartment house and we had our own apartment which was also a two-story.\nit went from the ground floor with a (430) which means stairway, could go upstairs\nand we had rooms upstairs. But other people that lived had either ground\u2014no first floor, what\nthey call it here from first floor. There were about another, about eight apartments and our\nown.\nYou said that your parents got married probably about 1920 or\u201921?\nYeah, | think so.",
        "10",
        "Pretty much from there, your mother helped your father with the store?\n| No, not when we were small. My mother didn\u2019t go to work when we were small. | don\u2019t\nremember her going to work because at that time | also don\u2019t remember that we had somebody |\nin the house to help. Maybe occasionally but not full-time help. But when we were bigger and\nmy little sister was born, we had full-time help by then. My mother used to go to business.\nMaybe she helped him but | don\u2019t\u2014.\nShe didn\u2019t do it full-time though?\nWhen, afterwards?\nNo, when you were growing up, she didn\u2019t help full-time?\nNo, definitely not.\nCan you explain to me what happened when your father left, he did not\u2014, when he was taken\nand killed? After that what did your mother do?\nWell, my mother was at home and she, everybody had to go to work. She also had to come to a\ncertain place\u2014this was German order, you had to come to a certain place and they made you\nwork. She worked for the sch (469) and my sister, Jennie, too.\nWhat were they doing, do you remember?\nShe was sewing buttons and buttonholes and things like that. You know on uniforms, German\n. uniforms. They had these workshops there and they sewed uniforms ad fixed uniforms and\ncleaned uniforms and all those sort of things. They found a job for each and every Jew that they\ndidn\u2019t kill.\nAt this time was there a ghetto in Liepaja?\nNo. The ghetto came to be only later in 1942.\nHow long did your mother work at doing this, at the sewing? Or was forced to work?\nAll the time.\nUp until\u2014until how long?\nUntil the ghetto.\nUntil the ghetto, 1942?\nUh-huh.\n11",
        "Do you remember when the ghetto was set up, what month?\n| think it is (492).\nOkay, I\u2019ll look it up.\n| can\u2019t think of it right now. | think sometime in July but I\u2019m not sure.\n| can look that up. What was your mother doing in the ghetto?\nI\u2019m just thinking back. i\u2019m absolutely taken back with myself that | don\u2019t remember. | don\u2019t\nknow if she went out to work or not. I still had a little sister and | don\u2019t think she went out, |\ndon\u2019t think so. I think she stayed home and did something inside the ghetto, maybe, | don\u2019t\nknow what. Maybe she did something inside. Our ghetto wasn\u2019t that huge. You\u2019re talking\nabout Lodz or Warsaw or anything like this\u2014we were only 800 souls.\nThat\u2019s what was left after they took most of the people away?\nYeah, after the 15\" of December, 1941. It\u2019s amazing how these dates, how you can even\nremember after all this time.\nCan you describe to me a little bit about the ghetto, what it was like there?\nWell, the ghetto was several blocks which was cordoned off in the middle of our city, in part of\nour city, shouldn\u2019t say the middle of our city; it\u2019s part of our city. | think it was like four blocks\nand was guarded by the sch (521) but not by the ones that wore the black\nuniforms. What do they call them\u2014l\u2019ll come to it. The people had to move in there. They had\nan order to move in there so we had to leave all our belongings there. In fact some of the\nbelongings were taken away beforehand because the Germans came in and for instance, they\ntook our pianos. We had two pianos that they took out, they took some of our light fixtures\nout, the carpets. Even before we left for the ghetto. We took only the necessities because each\nfamily had just one room and some didn\u2019t even have one room. Some of it was one big room,\nthey had to take some other people in.\nDo you remember about how long you were in the ghetto?\nYeah, till 1943. In October, it was Yom Kippur when they took us out.\n, Where were you sent?\nWe were sent to\u2014we were put into cattle cars and sent to Riga-Kaiserwald (580).\nNow you were all still together?\n12",
        "Yeah.\nCan you tell me a little bit about Kaiserwald, what it was like getting off the trains there?\nWell, we got off the trains and there were the Germans and their dogs. Not only the Germans\nin uniforms but they had those kapos. They wore like black jackets and britches, you call them\nbritches when you go riding?\nOh, the riding pants?\nYeah, the riding pants and the Russians put them (576). Of course the\nGermans in the uniforms and the kapos and they separated us, to the one side, to the other\nside. My little sister had to\u2014because she was only eight years old at that time. Yah, she had\njust turned eight, when the Germans came in, she was six\u2014no, what was she? She was born\u2014.\nShe was born in 1935 so yes she would have been\u2014.\nSix years, she was 6 years old. So she was 8 years old and they took her to, they told her to go\nto the one side, that she had to go to one side. Of course, my mother wouldn't let her go by\nherself. My mother went with her, wouldn\u2019t let her little girl go by herself. They said that\nthey\u2019re going to send them to another place, where they don\u2019t have to work. They said sure\nbecause they were children and they were going to send them to another place. The ones that\ncould work, to one side, the ones that\u2014the elderly and the children and the parents with the\nchildren, that wouldn\u2019t let their children go went on that other side. They were sent, |\nunderstand that they were sent to the ghetto but | can\u2019t be sure.\nTo the Riga Ghetto?\nTo the Riga Ghetto but how can | be sure, | never heard from my mother and | never heard from\nmy little sister. I think this is a phone for me, could you hold a moment?\nSure, no problem.\nEND OF SIDEA\n... told me anything about my mother or myself.\nWhy don\u2019t | ask you about your grandfather, your mother\u2019s father who lived with you?\nIt was Jacob?\nYeah.\n13",
        "Gamper. | think he must have been born in Liepaja but I\u2019m not sure, | can\u2019t tell you. | should\nthink so because they were all very different, Latvia-related. We, of course, lived under the\n| Germans, under the Russians and under all kinds of different regimes because Latvia was\nconstantly occupied but his mother tongue was German. Just for the record, the only\nnewspaper he read was a German newspaper.\nDo you remember what it was called?\nDe Lei (13).\nIs that all one word or Lei (15)?\nDo you remember when he was born? No? Do you remember about how old he was when\nyou\u2014?\nWhen he was killed?\nYeah.\n| think he was in his seventies.\nYou don\u2019t know for sure though?\nNo, but | should think his early seventies because my mother was alive. [| think it was in 1943.\nShe was like 44 years old, 44 or 45 years old. | think he was at least in his early seventies. ,\nDo you remember\u2014? |\u2019m trying to figure out because the date of birth is one of the important\nthings for the ID and I\u2019m trying just to figure it anyway that we might be able to deduce how old\nhe was.\n| think he was about 70 or 71,\nYou said your mother was 44 or 45, do you remember how old your grandfather was when your\nmother was born?\nWell, she was the second one. | think they were about two years apart, the children, my uncles\nand aunts. They weren't every year like. Even my father\u2019s parents too were like | think every\ntwo years they had a child. | think with my grandfather, | think also two or three years\ndifference. So\u2014can figure that out.\nWhat was your grandfather doing before the war?\n| told you.\n, He was living with you?\n14",
        "What do you mean by before the war? Before the second war?\nHe was living with you?\nWith my mother, yah. Or we were living with him because it was his apartment house, you\nknow.\nWas he too old to fight in WWI or did he fight?\n| don\u2019t know. | don\u2019t think he was in WWI. Neither was my other grandfather. | think only my\nfather was.\nYou said that your mother\u2019s parents owned a second-hand clothing store? When the Russians\ncame in, was that also seized or was he already retired at that point?\nHe was retired long before that. | think that at first maybe it was a regular clothing store. But\nthey got older and maybe they\u2014I really don\u2019t know too much about that. | know more my\ngrandfather from the time when he was with us, retired, than before that.\nYou said that your grandfather read exclusively from this German language paper. Did that\nhave, in the thirties and things when you were a young girl, did that have stories about what\nwas going on in Germany at the time?\nWell, - likely.\nDo you ever remember him telling you about things that were going on in Germany or talking\nabout them? What was going on there?\nNot in the early thirties. | remember like for instance, my late husband left South Africa in 1937.\nHe left Liepaja not so much because of the German, if the Germans (55) time, | don\u2019t\nthink. Also he wasn\u2019t prepared to go and be in the Latvian army. He wanted to make a better\nlife for himself. | don\u2019t think there was much of a future. Maybe at the time he also thought\nabout Hitler becoming stronger. Who knew about that they would run over Latvia, we never\nthought that. Because at the time, some German people came to Liepaja to escape Hitler, like\nin 1936, 1937. There were some German Jews that came from Germany to Latvia to escape\nhim. Who was thinking that he would overrun the whole world.\nWhen the Russians came in, in 1940, did they also seize your grandfather\u2019s apartment building?\nNationalize it or\u2014?\nWe still lived there. | don\u2019t know who got the rent, | really can\u2019t say.\nWhat happened to your grandfather after the war started? When the Germans invaded?\n15",
        "Well he was at home, most of the time, until the 13\" of December. The 13\" of December we all\nhad to get out of our house and march to the prison. We all marched to the prison that night\nand they took him away. They took away my aunt and the two little boys and my grandfather. |\nonly and my mother and my little sister, Jennie, they were standing on the side but when | came\nout after speaking to that guy and | said, I\u2019m not going out till my mother and my sister come.\nThat\u2019s how they came out, otherwise they would have gone with the same batch. | couldn't ask,\nnot that | wasn\u2019t concerned about the others but that was my first thought, my mother and my\nsister, that | wanted to be together.\nSure. Then you never heard from him again or about him?\nNo. They were killed, they were killed. They put them on sleighs and they took them to\nSc . That\u2019s a place near (88).\nThat was in the forests?\nYah, outside of the city. Sc . [think it was Sc . [don\u2019t know where they\ntook them because | wasn\u2019t there but | had a friend. She\u2019s not alive any more but she jumped\nfrom the sleigh and she could only jump because the aisarge or the German whoever it was on\nthat particular sleigh, kind of allowed her to do that. He kind of encouraged her.\nWhen you say \u201cslates\u201d, is that like trucks or \u2014?\nNo, you know a big sleigh like in winter?\nOh, asled, I\u2019m sorry, | misunderstood you.\nWell it\u2019s sled and not slate, sled. She said that they were going to Sc . She jumped from\nthat but where my grandfather and my aunt and the two boys went, | can\u2019t say but it must have\nbeen Sc because that\u2019s where they did it.\nLet me ask you about your father\u2019s parents. Can you give me their names also? | think we\u2019ve\ngot Daniel Judelowitz and Bella.\nYeah, born Hirshorn.\nNow, when we spoke about a month ago, a month and a half ago, you said that her married\n: name was Bookbinder?\nNo, it was Hirshorn.\nHirshorn, okay.\nShe had lots of family by the name of Bookbinder but she was born Hirshorn not Bookbinder.\n16",
        "Do you have another call, you want to get off?\nJust amoment. No Bookbinder was a\u2014actually the Bookbinders are there in Israel and they\nwere cousins of my grandmother because her cousin, Estelle, was married to (114)\nBookbinder, to ;\n|see. Can you spell Hirshorn for me?\nLike they spell the museum.\nOkay, it\u2019s the same way, okay.\nYeah, it\u2019s exactly the same way.\n| Now the tough questions. Do you remember where and when they were born?\nNo. But! know that my grandfather must have been also over seventy, maybe about 75, 74, my\ngrandmother maybe a few years younger. Maybe he was 76. I\u2019m not sure.\nWere the born in Liepaja? Do you know?\nNo, | think my grandmother was born in Kuldiga (128), K-u-I-d-i-g-a, Kuldiga. In German it\u2019s\ncalled Goldingen, you know gold, like gold, ingen i-n-g-e-n. | think my grandfather, | don\u2019t know\nwhere he was born, but | think in Aizpute or in Liepaja but I\u2019m no sure.\nBut it was definitely in Latvia?\nOh, yes, definitely Latvia. They were all what they call from our province, our province was\ncalled Kurland, K-u-r-l-a-n-d, Kurland in German, they called it Kurland. In Latvian it\u2019s called\nKurzent, K-u-r-z-e-n-t. But we all called it Kurland and it\u2019s still a joke that the people from Latvia,\nif you said you are a Kurlander, it gives you a certain kind of a status in western culture because\nwe were so close to Germany.\nPeople from Kurland are more western than the others? | see.\nUh-hun and almost more stupid.\nIs that true or\u2014?\nNo, the Kurlanders were very\u2014they are described as very straight. Not over-smart, they tell the\ntruth in business on a level which some people kind of think they\u2019re stupid because they do\nthat.\nThey\u2019re just very upstanding?\n17",
        "Pardon?\nVery upstanding citizens then?\nWell, they were very-they are known to be very on the level. Some people considered that\nstupid.\nWhat did your grandparents do for a living? Do you remember?\nWell, | told you they had this bakery shop and grocery shop. When they came to live in Liepaja,\nthey had a\u2014you call it here a dry goods store. What\u2019s a dry goods\u2014does that mean you sell\nbuttons and cottons and embroidery stuff? They had all kinds. They sold those shirts and\nstockings and underwear and bras and things like that and ties. We called it a haberdashery\nstore but | don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the description, you know what it means. Haberdasher and\nunderwear and scarves and that kind of things. Not dresses but stockings, underwear and shirts\nfor men and ties. They had a big store.\nYou said that that was after they moved to Liepaja?\nYeah. That was actually\u2014! never knew my grandparents when they lived in Aizpute.\nBut that\u2019s where they lived before you were born? |\n| think so, yah. When my father was a child, that\u2019s when they lived in Aizpute, in Hazenpot, But\nwhen | was growing up, when | was a child, | don\u2019t remember them ever living in Hazenpot.\nThey always lived in Liepaja.\nHow far away from where you lived in Liepaja did they live?\nAbout ten minutes or 15 minutes to go. We didn\u2019t have cars, we walked. They lived in\nBodastrasse (173) which means Boss Street.\nWhich street did you live on, do you remember?\n| lived on Birkenstrasse, B-e-r-z- with a little accent on top like a triangle (176).\nWhen the Russians came in in 1940, did they seize the dry goods store, the haberdashery?\nI\u2019m sure it must be. | really don\u2019t know. I'll tell you | don\u2019t know all these very great details\nbecause | was in Riga studying so | wasn\u2019t there for so many things. But I\u2019m sure they took it.\nMy aunts had to run it. You see my grandfather and my grandmother were at the time already\nkind of retired. My aunts, their daughters, ran it, One daughter was married and the other one\nwasn\u2019t married and they ran it. Actually three daughters ran it and a son-in-law.\n18",
        "Can you tell me what happened to them when the Germans came?\nYah. They were around the docks also Yom Kippur.\nIn October, 1941?\nUh-huh. | think it was if | said it in my oral, | don\u2019t know which date it was exactly but it was\nYom Kippur in 1941 before the big .(195) Everybody was killed on the 15\" of\nDecember but | think beforehand because they rounded up all the older people in the homes,\nthat were at home. They just got them out of their homes, they went from house to house,\nJewish houses. Because you know you had to register, now | remember. When the Germans\ncame, you had to register. You had to go to the polezai (198) and register.\nWhen the Germans came in?\nYah and register and tell them where you live and your name and bring all your jewelry. You\nhad to come to the police station and bring all that. Give all these things, all valuables, let\u2019s put\nit that way. First, | think jewelry they wanted. They knew where all the people lived.\nThat\u2019s how they knew how to find people?\nThat\u2019s how they went to the houses. They took my grandparents out and | said also in my\ntestimony that | had an aunt who lived in Kharkiv (210).\nYeah, in Russia.\nIn Russia and she came with her daughter and she went also because she said that\u2014she put on\na yellow star even though she didn\u2019t have to. | don\u2019t know if she registered in the first place.\nShe just said she\u2019s a Russian but she said no, if her brothers and sisters are wearing the yellow\nstars, she is too. She paid with her life. She went with my grandparents but her daughter did\nnot. Her daughter did not; she opted not to go. She opted not to put on a yellow star. She, |\ndon\u2019t know, if she survived or not but she, | understand, was working as a laborer somewhere\non a Latvian farm. She looked very Aryan, she had blonde hair\u2014.\nShe could pass as a non-Jew then?\nNot that\u2014 (225) said that Jews have a certain look, | don\u2019t think so but\nanyway she looked very Aryan, blonde hair.\nShe didn\u2019t fit the stereotype?\nThey went on Yom Kippur in 1941. That was the last time we heard of them.\nAnd they were taken away on sleds like the others?\n19",
        "| don\u2019t know if they were taken away with sleds or trucks. No, | think trucks, or sleds or\nwhatever. | don\u2019t remember seeing any sleds in the prison. | think there were more trucks. But\nmaybe they took them by truck and coming first as closer to the woods, the trucks couldn't go,\nthey put them on sleds. | don\u2019t know but | know that some of them went on sleds for sure\nbecause of my girlfriend, she was telling me that.\nOne more, your cousin. Can | ask about him?\nHis name was Solly {zikowitz and he was a year older than | was. He also had finished high\nschool and studying.\nDo you remember his birthday, what month?\nNot exactly but | think he was born in 1921.\nAnd he was born in Liepaja?\nYah.\nThis is a cousin on your father\u2019s side or your mother\u2019s side?\nNo, on my father\u2019s side.\nOn your father\u2019s side?\nYah. It was my father\u2019s sister\u2019s son. | think that his mother was the second one in the family.\nMy father was the oldest of nine and she was the second one.\nWhat did his parents do for a living, do you remember?\nYah, they had a\u2014actually he was born in Liepaja but they lived in Aizpute. When the Russians\noccupied Latvia, they came back to Liepaja because his parents had a material store, what do\nyou call it here?\nLike a cloth store, | know what you\u2019re talking about.\nQuite a big store. They had it with a partner also a Hirshorn.\n: Did they have the storein __?\n, Aizpute.\nAizpute, okay.\nBut his father, my cousin, Solly\u2019s father, was a leftist. He was very left.\n20",
        " ,",
        "Like a communist?\n| don\u2019t know if he was a communist, he had very liberal ideas. | think that when they closed the\nstore, or they gave the store away, or they took the store away from them; they came to\nLiepaja. | know that my uncle, | understand left to go to Russia. But you know at the time it\nwasn\u2019t easy but | supposed he left Liepaja and he went to another town and another town to\nget closer to Russia. | don\u2019t know if he survived, no idea. I\u2019ve never heard of him. He left home\nbefore everybody else, apparently.\nHe left his family?\n| think he left his family but I\u2019m not too sure. Again, I\u2019m telling you at the time | wasn\u2019t home, |\nwas very absorbed in my studies. Eventually when | came home and | worked in the Kendrall\n(289) Hospital, | too, it was during the war. Things were going on and | just didn\u2019t have much\ncontact. | do know that they lived in Liepaja; he was my favorite cousin, in fact, because we\nwere so close in age. Here it tells you\u2014on the picture it says Liepaja, 1940. It must be during\nthe summer vacation.\nThat was the swimsuit? The one where you\u2019re in the swimming suits?\nYah, that must have been\u2014. Except it wasn\u2019t a swim suit, they were shorts and a top. No, it\u2019s\nnot, it doesn\u2019t say Liepaja, it says Aizpute, 1940. It says Aizpute, 1940 and it was vasara (302)\nand vasara means in the summer. That\u2019s what it says and my cousin must have written it. You\nknow the cousins that lived in Israel gave me that picture and it says Aizpute in 1940, vasara,\nwhich means summer. So that was in Aizpute so he must have come just before the Germans\ncame in.\nCome to Liepaja, you mean?\nTo Liepaja, they must have come to visit, maybe my grandparents or something and he was in\nLiepaja when he was killed. In fact, he was with a friend and he was crossing the street and they\ncaught him in the street and they shot him.\nThis was in Liepaja?\nYah, he was going across to my other aunt.",
        "When did this happen?",
        "That was right in the beginning of 1941, in June. That was even before my father was killed.",
        ", Right when the war broke, when they occupied Liepaja and he came out of the apartment\nwhere he was. He wanted to cross the street, to go across the street and they caught him in the\nstreet and shot him right off. But he was still in Aizpute in 1940.",
        "21",
        "Do you remember, did he go to Jewish school, or did he go to public school?\nFirst when they lived in Liepaja, they lived for some time in Liepaja. | think my uncle was\nemployed in one of those material stores. Then afterwards when he was already growing up,\nthey went to Aizpute which they opened their own store in partnership with somebody, with a\ncousin. He went to a Jewish school. He went to a school, to a Jewish school, where the main\nlanguage, all the subjects were taught in German, German-speaking and | think the high school\nmaybe he went to in Aizpute. That\u2019s possible but I\u2019m not sure, | think so. | think when he was in\nhigh school, he definitely finished in Aizpute.\nYou said that he finished high school before the war started?\nOh, yah. He\u2019s a year older than me.\nWas he planning on going to university anywhere?\nYah, | think he did want to go to university. | think he did study something but I\u2019m not sure.\nMaybe he was with his father in business, | can\u2019t really say, | don\u2019t remember.\nYou said that he was killed right as the war was starting in 1941?\nWell, the war was starting\u2014as the Germans occupied Liepaja, that was in June, 1941. First they\nbombed Liepaja and then they came in. As he was crossing the road, so they shot him.\n| think that\u2019s all the questions | have.\nOkay.\n22",
