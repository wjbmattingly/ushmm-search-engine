        "October 8, 1996\nI: what was your name at birth?\nS: My name at birth was Noemi Donath\nI: and where were you born?\nS: I was born in Onod, which is the county of Borshod(?). It is about nine kilometer or\nnine mile from Mishkoltz.\nI: And what was your date of birth?\nS: My date of birth was April 10th 1931\nI: Would you talk about your childhood?\nS: Yes, I grew up as the daughter of a rabbi, my father was a rabbi and twenty six little\ntowns belonged to his congregation. I had a beautiful childhood growing up among three\nbrothers and sisters. The name of my brother was Joseph, and my sister is Esther who 1s\nalive and is living in Montreal. My parents were very educated people and they looked\ninto it that the children should be going to the best schools. I attended a Lutheran school\nbecause there was no more Jewish school at the time that I grew up. However, we had\nbeen learning Jewish studies in the afternoons. Also I had a private teacher who was\nteaching the German language. That was the language that more advanced people, more\nintellectual people had been learning and my father was originally from Bratislava\nCzechoslovakia and he wanted his children to be very cultured. And we were always\ngoing to the library, picking up books. My father would see what we are reading, he\nwould discuss with us. I come from a very religious background but yet very open\nminded. We had lots of celebrations. The holidays, Purim, everybody would come to the\nhouse.\nI: Everybody. Who? Relatives, friends...\nS: Friends. Friends and people who lived in the town. The whole town had only fifty",
        "1",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Jewish families.\nI: And how many. How large was the town?\nS: The population of the town was less than 3000 people. And from that about 300 were\nJewish people. Fifty families, but you know, large families. Mostly the Jewish people in\nthe town, they were store keepers. A lot of the people, they had big farms. There were\ndoctors, some lawyers, but mainly really shopkeepers.\nI: And your father was the rabbi in the town?\nS: My father was the rabbi of the town and they really loved him. He had a special school\nfor big boys, which is what we called yeshiva. And I remember very clearly the beautiful\ntimes when they were baking the matzah near to the house, you know, singing and I used\nto love as a young kid to walk around and all these lovely boys used to pet me and I used\nto tell them leave me alone. So they named me \u201cleave me alone\u201d in Hungarian.",
        "We had a beautiful house. Lots of fruit trees. About fifty fruit trees. My momma\nused to cook all the fruits. You know it wasn\u2019t like today you go to the store and buy the\ncanned goods, she would be putting into jars, making her own jams and prewn-de-qua(\u2019?),\nall these things, it was all a lot of fun. At the end of our house was a river named Shayo.\nAnd we used to go to the bank of the river. It had a lot of grass, and cousins would come\nfrom the big city of Budapest and we would giggle there. And we would be dancing\nthere, going swimming there. So we had a lovely upbringing.",
        "I remember that my mother used to bring a sewing lady and she would be sewing\nfor us beautiful outfits for the holidays. She was a very devoted mother to her children. I\nused to tell \u201cmama you need also something new\u201d but first was her three children. She\nhad a lot of pride, and two daughters. My sister\u2019s name is Judit Esther and my brother\u2019s\nname was Joseph. And my brother was educated in the big city in Budapest. And we used\nto love when he came home and he told us beautiful stories about his experience in the\nbig city. I can thank him for who I am today because he was always the one introducing\nme to a lot of things about science, and books. He would come home and he would\nencourage that \u201cwhatever you have you can lose one day but what you have in your\nmind, that nobody can take away\u201d. So that was our life in the small town.",
        "We had been very friendly with the gentile people.",
        "I: You went to a Lutheran school\n2",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "S: I went to a Lutheran school. And we were very friendly with the minister. We were\nvery friendly with the doctor of the town. We were very friendly with our simple\nneighbors too, who would love to come. And my mother was called the midwife of the\ntown because when anybody gave birth to a child my mother was rushing and helping.\nWarming water for them, giving them some kind of food.\nI: So this was not just Jews, but also gentiles\nS: Also gentiles, we were very friendly, we went to schools. A matter of fact I happened\nto be in my childhood very good in arithmetic. And there was the daughter of the so\ncalled \u201cmayor\u201d of the town, she had difficulty and I used to go to her house, or she would\ncome to our house. There was no separation between us except religiously. They went to\ntheir church and we went to our temple. But there was such a friendship.",
        "Or we would go to the farmer to fetch our milk, because in those days you didn\u2019t\nhave milk in the store. So we would go and we would sing with them while they were\nmilking the milk. Or they would come over to us and taste the cookies. My mother was\nan excellent baker. And we didn\u2019t feel that there was any kind of hostility between us and\nour gentile people in the town until about 1942/43 when they started to throw bad words\ntowards us.",
        "I: Now before 1942 were you aware that there was anything different going on?\nS: No. Nothing that was going on except a certain kind of restriction such as that the\nJewish people could not anymore have beef because they did not allow any more to kill\ncows according to the rituals of the Jewish faith. So that was the very\u2014\nI: So this was the Hungarian government that said you can no longer kill cows according\nto the Jewish faith.\nS: That\u2019s right. That was the very first thing that I recall. And then later on when we\nstarted to feel that there 1s something going on, us as children, we went on Shabbat\nSaturday afternoon we went for a walk and we were singing some kind of Jewish song,\nand the first time that lots of the town people started to scream \u201cdirty Jew go to\nPalestine\u2019. At that time Israel was called Palestine.\nI: Were these people that you knew?",
        "3",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "S: These were not people that we really knew. These were people, you can call them\nsometimes, hoodlums who were in the street. So we didn\u2019t pay too much attention to that.\nYet I have to state it, that my father had brothers and sisters living in Bratislava\nCzechoslovakia and he used to receive some letters from them. I as a young child, who\nhad to be hardly ten years old at that time, I remember hearing my father \u201coh poor brother\nof mine, he has to be in a bunker.\u201d Or \u201cpoor brother of mine, they don\u2019t know where he\nis.\u201d",
        "But I think being the youngest of the family. Or maybe if I wouldn\u2019t be the\nyoungest, maybe they wanted to shield us children and they were not much talking about\nwhat was going on in the world. I remember very vividly that my father used to listen to\nthe secret radio. There were certain channels that brought news from out of Hungary.\nAnd they would come home and tell \u201coh thank goodness the Americans are advancing\u201d\nor \u201cthe British are advancing, they are hoping they are going to succeed to win the war\nagainst Germany.\u201d That I remember. But being a young kid, they did not involve to much\ninto the politics. But here and there I gathered that there must be something going on and\nmust be very important that the German people should not be able to capture more and\nmore countries.",
        "I also remember, that is already in 1943, that a lot of people smuggled into\nHungary Jewish people from Poland. Not in small towns, because in a small town they\nright away would notice if somebody is foreign. But we had relatives. My mother had\ntwo brothers and a sister in the city of Budapest and they wrote that \u201cwe have some guest\nfrom a different country and they are telling us terrifying stories\u2019. But what exactly they\nwere telling, my momma and father would not tell us. So I assume, remembering these\nlittle episodes that my parents were to a certain degree aware of it. That there is\nsomething bad going on in Poland and Czechoslovakia.",
        "Also in 1942/43 a lot of girls came over from Czechoslovakia who escaped from\nbunkers where they were hiding and could not hide anymore certain relatives who arrived\nto the big city. And that was the other sign that something was going on there. That they\nhad to run away from home and abandon even their own family\nI: Now you said that you would not be able to hid Jews in a small town where you lived.\nIf a Jew had suddenly shown up and started to live in your house what would have\nhappened?",
        "S: Well they, the local police would come, and they would arrest them. Now when we are",
        "talking about hiding in a small town, now this is really a story for later on but this is",
        "related to this. In 1944 when the Germans marched into Hungary, my parents approached\n4",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "the catholic priest \u201cwould he hide the children\u201d. So that is also telling that my parents\nwere aware that something bad was waiting for us. And at first the catholic priest was\nthinking of it, that he would hide us children, and then he said \u201chow can I do that, they\nwould right away know that these are the children of the rabbi.\u201d That\u2019s number one.\nNumber two, he said \u201cI have no wife, I have no children. How can I have children\nsuddenly in my household.\u201d But my father told him \u201cafter all, you can have some\nstudents\u201d. But the end of the story is that he refused to hide us.\nI: So back in 1942 if extra Jews had appeared would anybody had done anything about it\nthen?\nS: Yes. Yes, in \u201942 already.\nI: But your family, as Jews were living as they had before?\nS: We had been living as before.\nI: But if knew Jews would arrive something would happen?\nS: Something would happen, the police would arrive. They would have to identify\nthemselves, who are they. A matter of fact, in 1942, we had a cantor who was singing in\nour temple, and since he had no Hungarian nationality.. In Hungary it takes much longer\nthan in America. In America in five years you can become a citizen. He was not a citizen\nbecause it takes 25 years, I\u2019m not sure what the laws are today, but in those days you had\nto live in Hungary25 years in order to get citizenship. And this fellow was from Poland.\nAnd he had no Hungarian citizenship. He had to leave the country. And we were crying\nthat he is leaving the country and where is he going. He went to Palestine. And today he\nis alive with all his family and with grandchildren and so on and my family is in ashes.\nSo in a way it was luck if you were not a citizen and you had to leave, but that was the\nlaw. If you were not a Hungarian citizen you could not live in the country.\nI: If you were not Jewish you also could not live in the country?\nS: If you were not Jewish, also.\nI: So it wasn\u2019t just Jews who had to..\n)",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "S: Well I don\u2019t really know what happened with the people if you were just a temporary\ncitizen you were allowed to live except if you were a Jew. If you were Jewish and you\ndid not have a citizenship, that was the first thing that came out in 1942, that you had to\nleave the country.\nI: So that applied to Jews only.\nS: To Jews, yes. Only. Yeah only to Jews.\nI: So you were saying that you were aware that something bad was happening.\nS: Yes I was sensing. I was sensing the tenseness. I was sensing that my father was\nalways secretly talking with momma. And when they noticed that the children are coming\nthey would change the subject. I was noticing that my parents were shielding us more\nthan before. If it was going to the streets, or traveling. They were much more alert to\nwhat was going on than before. Until 1942/43, we were a fairly free happy life, traveling,\ngo to the theatre, going to the circus. Anywhere we wanted to go. Then later on, I am\naware of it, I mean I remember it, the parents did not want the children too much to be in\nthe streets and not to go to public places. We were not questioning why. But that\u2019s you\nknow, what I remember.\nI: And what do you remember next?\nS: The next thing that I remember, in 1943, September, my sister, my oldest sister. I was\nthe youngest in the family. She went to study also in Budapest 1n a special school, and\nmy brother was away also in a special school. And I remember that the parents were very\nworried \u201care they ok?\u201d. When before, they were also away, except till this time they were\nnot so concerned if everything is going ok with them. And in 1944, when the Germans\nmarched into Hungary, my parents wanted the children to come home. There was a\nrestriction, the Jews could not travel anymore by train. We were very worried if ever my\nsiblings would be able to come home. One morning my father was stepping out from the\ncongregation, the temple, and here is my sister. \u201cHow did you get home from Budapest?\u201d\nAnd she told us the story that my aunt had dressed her to look like a gentile because the\ngentile people were a little differently dressed. We were a little more fashionably dressed,\nthe Jewish people. She should look more like a peasant. It\u2019s really not right to say gentile,\nshould say she should look more like a peasant girl. And she shouldn\u2019t be too attractive,\nshe was a very beautiful girl.\n6",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "And my father was asking \u201chow did you get home\u2019\u2019? And she said \u201clets go home\nquickly\u201d. And she went home and she told us the story that her relatives put her on the\ntrain and luckily it went smooth. When they saw her looking like a little peasant girl they\ndidn\u2019t approach her. When she arrived, well there was no train station in Onod. It was\nabout seven kilometer from us a train station. And when she unboarded, when she came\ndown from the train, she thought \u201cit\u2019s night, what do I do? A young girl? How do I get\nhome? I can\u2019t walk this in the night.\u201d She remembered that there is a Jewish family near\nby. She knocked on the door. Low and behold there was the headquarter of the German\nSS army. She\u2019s opening the door and saying \u201coh I\u2019m so sorry, I don\u2019t want to disturb you.\nI just wanted a little bit of water.\u201d She quickly went out. Here she\u2019s wandering and\nwandering and suddenly she remembered there is another Jewish family living in the\ntown. She went there, and they told her \u201cyou sleep over\u201d. The next morning they brought\nher home. So that\u2019s how my sister arrived. And later my brother arrived home too, also in\na very special way. He got some papers from a gentile friend and he arrived too.",
        "At that time we already knew that we were occupied by the Germans in Hungary.\nYet Horti, who was the head of the Hungarian government was refusing to let to do\nanything to the Jewish people. But it didn\u2019t take too long. The Germans override him.\nThey fought against that. The new decree that came out was that we had to have the\nyellow star on our clothing, that we are not allowed to be on the street, only at certain\ntimes of the day. The gentile people are not allowed to sell us any merchandise. We are\nnot allowed to hire any non-Jewish people working for us. And slowly and surely later on\ncame out that we have to make an inventory of whatever we have in our house and\nsubmit it to the mayor of the town.",
        "I remember that my mother was taking out from the closet a beautiful tablecloth.\nIn those days, years before a girl was married they were embroidering and having the\nmonograms on the tablecloths and on the bedsheets and the pillowcases. Each one that\nshe was folding and writing down, her tears were running from her eye. And my brother\nwas helping her to make the inventory.\nI: And you were watching?\nS: And I was watching all this because I was a very curious little girl. I think that I did\nnot grasp it in the depth that this is not going to be ours any more. I was just admiring to\nsee the beautiful colors and the beautiful embroidery and the counting. And my brother\nwas saying \u201cmommy don\u2019t worry, we come back I will buy you the most beautiful\nlinens\u201d. That is ringing in my ear to this day.",
        "rf",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "I: He said when we come back\nS: When we come back. That time I understood that 1t means we have to leave our house\nand hopefully we would come back. I have to tell that my father has been chosen to be\nthe head of the ghetto, which one was located not far from Mishkoltz. Called the place\nDiossjer. It was a town that they had factories for iron. They emptied the worker\u2019s\nhouses. That was very poor, like one room and kitchen kind of apartments and they had\nto organize that place to become the Jewish ghetto. At the time when we were doing this\ninventory my father was away because he had to go and organize this ghetto in Diossjer.\nI: Do you know how they chose your father to be the head of the ghetto?\nS: I have no idea why he was chosen to be because not only people from Onod but from\nall the surrounding towns. Except that he was the chief rabbi for all these towns. So\nmaybe that\u2019s the reason they had been choosing him to be the head of the ghetto. And we\nwere expecting the father should come back from there after he is doing the job\norganizing the place. But he never came back from the ghetto. After a few days the\ninventory was made. My mother succeeded to take a few precious pictures from the\nfamily and us children and a few tablecloth and a few silverware, such as which one she\nwas lighting the Shabbat candles some Kiddush cups, some silver cups, one of them I\nhappen to have it here. To our neighbor, who was very devoted neighbor to us as well we\nwere very devoted, good friends helpful for each other all the time. And she asked her\n\u201cdo me a favor Martha, put these things away. And we have to most probably leave the\ntown. But when come back, you will give these back to me. And if I am not coming back,\nthen please would you give these to my children.\u201d",
        "So all these little things indicate that my mother and father, they were informed\nsomehow that elderly people are killed or that elderly people they don\u2019t make it. They\nhad prayer and hope that the children will remain and she wanted us to have some\nmementos. Something that is from our household.",
        "I: At the time you did not realize what your parents did but looking back on what they\nsaid, you can see what they knew.\nS: At that time I couldn\u2019t understand why mother was hiding jams in the attic. Why was\nshe putting away certain things or giving away some money to another gentile family in a\nsmall town who came to see if we had everything. I mean they, we call them \u201cchasidei\nomot ha\u2019olam\u201d we call them the righteous gentiles who were worried and they",
        "8",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "understood and endangered themselves, such as that family from a little town Hidveg,\ncoming in and bringing some potato knowing that we can\u2019t any more buy food.\nI: and this was before you went to the ghetto\nS: Before we went to the ghetto. Before we went to the ghetto. So that family, my parents\nused to have a collection of silver coins. You know today people are investing in stock or\nputting in bank. In those days if you had a little money you put them in silver coins. The\nvalue didn\u2019t go down. For the children, education later, or if a child has to get married. So\nmy father had a collection of silver money and he gave it to this gentile family.",
        "Shortly after we had been submitting the inventory, giving to our neighbor certain\nitems to keep, it came an enouncement. In those days it was in the market place, they\nused to announce in a loud speaker: ALL THE JEWISH FAMILIES. THEY HAVE TO\nPACK UP. THEY ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE ONLY CERTAIN AMOUNT OF\nCLOTHING WITH THEM. THEY HAVE TO GO INTO THE GHETTO.",
        "Now we had to pay with our own money, horseman, buggy, pack up and go. We\nhad to leave the keys and all the inventory at the house of the mayor. We had to be at 9 in\nthe morning, in 1944, end of May, I don\u2019t exactly remember completely the date, but I do\nremember it was in May, we had to go into the ghetto in Diossjer.",
        "I: Now the mayor was the father of your good friend, is that right?",
        "S: Yes",
        "I: Now what happened to your friendship with her?",
        "S: We were friendly until the last minute. However, at the time when the yellow star\ncame out, that we had to wear it on our clothing, our relationship was off. And the last\nthing that I remember him saying, the mayor, was that \u201cI am sorry, I am not in a position\nof helping you.\u201d In other words, he must have had some kind of emotions, and yet he was\nreally, maybe in a position where he was watched by the German occupying army. That\nhe could not do anything. Since he was the only one important person in the town. So I\nam not able to blame him. It hurt at the time. But you have to put yourself in the shoe of\nthe other person. And I have to state here that the Hungarian police department, the\nJundermaren, they were worse than the Germans. They were more brutal. They were\nmore beating us up. They were more hostile. In every way.",
        "So we hire the buggy. We packed up my mother took with her one chicken. You",
        "9",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "have to understand that we lived in a town, and in the backyard my mother was growing\nchickens and ducks, and turkey, and somehow she was so sentimental with her little\nchickens that one chicken she wanted to take with her. So she took a basket, she took\nsome straw, and she took one chicken with us to the ghetto. Some dishes, some little\nleftover potatoes, some flower, whatever we had left in the house. And we each of us\npacked up some suitcase with some clothing and here we went with the buggy arriving to\nthe ghetto.\nI: And did you take some favorite things that you wanted?\nS: Only our personal jewelry. But we were not allowed to. We had to leave everything.\nSuch as clothing, books. It had to be 1n the inventory. We had to write down how many\nbooks we had, or how many lamps we had. How many furniture with us. But we could\nnot take with us..\nI: You couldn\u2019t take a favorite book.\nS: No, we couldn\u2019t take a favorite book. The only thing we took with us was really our\npersonal jewelry and my father took with him, at the beginning he went, he took some\nbooks, to study. When we left the house we had to leave everything in the house, and the\nofficers statement of the German was: you will come back, and that\u2019s why we are doing\nthe inventory, so you can claim when you come back, what is missing from the house. It\nwas known that behind all these decrees, and the organization of the German Jews to go\ninto the ghetto in Hungary was Eichman. Eichman was in Budapest, and he was the one\nwho was organizing the departure of the Jewish people from Hungary. And the inventory,\nand what you can take, and what you can\u2019t take, this was all from the Eichman office.\nAnd the Jewish organization was hoping to have some kind of dialogue with him, some\nkind of agreement with him that if people are going to give you a certain amount of\nmoney, would you leave the Jewish people to stay in the ghetto in Hungary. Or some of\nthem even in their homes.",
        "We arrived to the ghetto and we were shocked to see how many Jewish people had\nbeen occupying already. And the headquarters that was given to us was at one time a\nsmall room, with a tiny eency teency little kitchen, and yet I have to say that ours was a\nluxurious apartment compared to many other people who had to sleep together, two three\nfamilies in one room.\nI: And do you think this was maybe because your father was the head of the ghetto?",
        "10",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "S: Maybe. And maybe they felt after all, maybe a rabbi 1s still somebody important. I\nreally think that was the reason for it. My mother placed the little basket with the chicken\nin the kitchen. This way she felt that there was some part with her from her childhood.\nShe was brought up, she was born in Onod, she was the the daughter, her father, my\ngrandfather was the previous rabbi before my father became the rabbi there. So\neverything from that town, the river, the grass, the chicken, the fruit. Everything was a\npart of her life. So this piece, the chicken, reminder her. And the chicken is a very special\nstory because usually chickens, they lay eggs every other day. Except today when they\nare in incubators and the food is different. But in the primitive way of feeding them and\nraising them, chickens used to lay egg every other day. While we were in the ghetto, that\nchicken laid an egg every single day. And I remember that my mother would say \u201cthis\negg is for my youngest daughter because she 1s so skinny\u201d. (Hahaa in those days). She\nshould be eating, and I refused. So sometimes she made a scrambled egg and I divided it\nbetween all of us. Sometimes she collected at least two eggs and she baked a cake with\nthe little left over flour that she brought with her. And then we celebrated shavuot, which\none is the holiday of receiving the Torah from sinai, mountain Sinai. We celebrated. That\nwas the last holiday that I was with my parents together. And before that there went a\nwhole discussion: what should we prepare for the holiday? We were used to have nice\nmeal. My mother started to cry and she said \u201cshould we kill the chicken and I make a\nnice meal? or should we keep the chicken?\u201d\u2019.",
        "So the decision was that they killed the chicken because you don\u2019t know what will\nbe really our fate. Apparently they sensed, again, it\u2019s an indication which at that time I\ndidn\u2019t understand, but looking back. And mother made from that one chicken, you name\nit, everything. She made chicken soup, she made roast chicken, she made hamburger\nfrom the white part. And that was the last chicken soup that my mother made.\nI: And what was your religious life like in the ghetto?\nS: In the ghetto the religious life was that my father had a special room where the people\nwent to pray, and\u2014\nI: This was for everyone in the ghetto?\nS: For everyone in the ghetto. But it didn\u2019t take too long, and the Hungarian police came\nto the ghetto and they came to pressure and question the people where did they hide\nthings. And where did you put certain things. You didn\u2019t have everything in the",

And many times they would very brutally beat up people, think\nthat if they are really hiding some things, seeing that they are so tortured, they will give\nin and they will tell. And the headquarters of the police department was behind our\nwindow. And my mother used to hear the screaming of the people when they were beaten\nup. And she just fainted, she just couldn\u2019t take. She grew up with all these people, from\nher childhood on. Seeing them, that they are blue and that they are losing blood and they\nare beaten up so severely she just couldn\u2019t take it. Either she was sitting and praying. Or\nshe was crying. And once I remember when she fainted. I do remember when that took\nplace, when our doctor who was helping the whole town. Giving birth to children, he was\neverything. A general doctor who helped heal children and birth children and what not.\nHe was beaten up very severely. To that extent that my father had to intervene and had to\nget permission to take him to a hospital. Unfortunately he died from the beating.",

Nothing on the ground except some leftover bricks. And as we are arriving to\nthat place we hear some men screaming to us. We thought that we hear the voice of my\nfather. But we couldn\u2019t recognize him. Low and behold he was there. They sheared his\nbeard, they took off his hair completely. He did not have anymore his nice suite. He was\nin a pants and a shirt.

        "I: Did you have anything to eat?",
        "S: Only some leftover bread that momma baked in the ghetto. Maybe a few potatoes. I\nremember that my mother went out on the ground and she collected some woods and she\nhad still with her one pot. She cooked some kind of a potato soup but it was more water\nthan potato or anything else. But at least it was warm. Really what we ate, mainly it was\nstale bread that we had still with us. One day the German soldiers came in and said that\nthey need some few hundred girls to work in their headquarters. To clean and to shine\nshoes. So my mother thought that here my girls are going to die from starvation, let them\ngo to work, maybe they will be fed, maybe they can bring home some food for the rest of\nthe family. We were taking with army truck. My mother gave a whole speech, be careful,\nyou\u2019re going with soldiers. And they said they\u2019d bring us back in an afternoon. We went\nwith the soldiers two times. Two days. And our work was to clean dishes, to wash\nclothing, to iron for them, to shine their shoes. They threw us some bread and some\ncooked potato, which was luxurious for us. And we brought home, we hide it in our\npocket a few potatoes, a little bit bread, and we brought it back to the factory. The third\nday we were waiting and waiting that they come to pick us up again because at least we\nwere occupied, we were doing something. Plus to eat, we were given a little something to\neat. They didn\u2019t come, and instead of that, again, they announced that we have to march\nfrom the factory, which was very close to the railroad. We have to march to the railroad.\nWe can take as many things we have still left over, and we are now going to travel to the\nreal good place, we are going to travel to the factory in Czechoslovakia. To a camp, a\nworking camping, not to a factory but to a working camp.",
        "So little we understood, or really we really knew what it meant to go to the\nrailroad. Again the Germans with their huge dogs this time, they were the ones who were\ntaking care of us, watching over us. Whoever who was collapsing, the dog would just tore",

They pushed us in, 70 people into one cattle train.\nThey gave us two bottles, in one was water, and the other one instead of bathroom. Old\npeople, screaming and crying, squeezed like sardines. They closed the door.",

And I heard my mother crying, and my father said \u201cI wish\nthat at least the children should remain alive.\u201d So again, I am sure they sensed it, they\nknew it, they had kind of information.

        "S: No. I was not thinking of.. For sure I was thinking of my mother, because I saw that\nshe is really not feeling good anymore. I was very close to my mother. I used to pet her\nand calm her and say to her \u201cGod is with us and it will be good\u201d. And my mother would\nsay \u201cfor sure you will yet have yet a beautiful life\u201d.

        "When we got to the city of koshitze, which is a border city between Hungary and\nCzechoslovakia\nI: What was the name of it?",
        "S: Koshitze. They opened the wagon, the train, the cattle train. And they said that one\nperson can go down and fetch some water and empty the bathroom bucket. So nobody\nwas daring to do that. They thought that this is some kind of a trick. That the Germans are\ntrying to have some person to go down and they will kill that person. My brother\nvolunteered. He went down, and he looked around and he saw that we are in a city. From\nthe train station he could sense it or recognize it. He fetched the water.

By the way I forgot to tell that before\nwe went away from the ghetto they already took away all the Jewelry except each one of\nus was trying to hide a memento. A ring. Or my mother, her wedding band. Or my father\nhad a very special gold watch that he had in his pocket. They came and they screamed\nand said \u201cyou better give it because otherwise we beat you to death\u201d. So everybody got\nscared and the last jewelry, the last possession that we had we gave it right away. They\nclosed the door and the train was going like mad, was rushing. Where is the train rushing\nso much? The noise was tremendous, and the crying. People died. Old people in the train.\nAfter three days, three and a half days actually, traveling in a not normal kind of\nsituation. The bucket was full with what people made. The smell, the starvation, the\ncrying the screaming, on and on. People were completely washed out. Some old people\nwho died, they smelled. Suddenly they open the train. We are in Auschwitz.",
        "When we arrived to Auschwitz, first the German soldiers with their dog they came\nto the door. And they said that \u201cyou have to get off very fast from the train because you\nare going to start to work. Leave your belongings, that will be shipped to your camp, why\nshould you carry it?\u201d Then there were some striped clothed men who were screaming\nalso that \u201cgo fast, you have to line up five in a row.\u201d And in between screaming to us\nthey talked to us in Yiddish. A few words in the Jewish language, saying to us that \u201cdon\u2019t\ngo the mothers with the babies. Give the babies to the grandmothers.\u201d And we thought\nthey\u2019re crazy. Why are they saying this? Why should a mother give up her child and give\nit to an old grandmother who hardly can walk anymore. We all looked pale, hungry, tired,\nthe un-none(?). The mental facilities were not working properly anymore, when you\u2019ve\nstarved for such a long time. When you suffer with the darkness. We didn\u2019t want to\nbelieve what they are saying to us. Or to do what they are telling. There were people\nthough whose mind was maybe working better, who took the babies and gave it to the\ngrandmother, which saved many people\u2019s lives. But we didn\u2019t want to depart from\nmomma. They said \u201cdon\u2019t go families together\u201d. Then they would holler in German. But\nin between, each time they would give us some little advice. Something that later on we\nunderstood how much they wanted to try and help us and to save us. Then when they\nnoticed that the German soldier with the big dog is coming they would holler \u201cschnell\nschnell, los los\u2019. You have to go fast and line up the men separate from the women.",
        "We lined up and we were standing momma in the middle, my sister and me and\nthen two other girls from our home town. And the men in a separate line. I remember my\nfather screaming my name. He was very worried because I was the youngest.",

When I was a child I just happened to be very slim. And my father\nwas screaming my name and I turned around and he said \u201cwhatever happens, wherever\nyou go, you continue to believe in God.\u201d And that\u2019s the last words of my father. That\u2019s\nringing each time in my ear. Apparently he knew that terrible things are coming and he\nwanted to reassure. That we should continue that the faith should give us strength.\nI: you were talking about the last words your father spoke to you at the entrance of\nAuschwitz\nS: Yes. Then we were walking and there was a huge tall beautiful man in army uniforms.\nHe had white gloves on his hands. Shiny boots and a silver stick in his hand. When our\nturn came to approach him he pointed my mother to the left. Me and my sister and the\ntwo other sisters, Solomon, from my home town, to the right. When I noticed that my\nmother was pointed to the left I grabbed her skirt and I wanted to pull her.

They said that we have to take off\nour clothing, we are traveling for a long time, we have to have some shower. We should\npile up nicely our clothing. We were taken into a shower, when we came back, no more\nclothing was waiting. We were naked. We had to stand. German soldiers came to count\nus, naked, without hair. I remember screaming, \u201cEsther! Esther!\u201d. That\u2019s the name,\nYehudit Esther my sister. She said \u201cI\u2019m standing next to you.\u201d I couldn\u2019t recognize her\nwithout hair.

Why are they painting our dress? Well, in case we might in some miracle try to\nescape from Auschwitz we can\u2019t because we will be noticed from far away that we are\ninmates from Auschwitz.",
        "From the bathing house we were marched into Birkenau. Which was the camps for\nthe women. That\u2019s a sub-camp of Auschwitz, Auschwitz Birkenau. We were given to go\ninto a huge bunk. It was about the length of two, times three times my living room.\nWhere we had been pushed in one thousand girls. No beds, no blankets. Nothing was in\nthat room. They again called us to stand for \u201cseil aper\u201d which 1s roll call. I happened to\nwant to make, and I asked the head of the camp where can I go, and she said \u201cin the back.\nBut do it fast.\u201d So until I find it, and until I made it and I came back and they were\nalready coming the Germans there again to count us, she became very angry and she gave\nme. She beat me up in my face that I could not see for days. I got so swollen in my face,\nbecause she is blamed that there 1s missing one person from the counting.",
        "Then I was standing in the row and they counted again and everything was ok. We\nwere given food and the food consisted of black coffee and a little piece of bread, the size\nof half of my palm. We ate and we asked \u201cwhere are we going to sleep\u2019. So the head of\nthe bunk said to us, \u201cwhat do you think, you are in Budapest? What do you mean beds?\nYou go and lay down on the bare floor\u2019. And she threw for every two girls a blanket.\nAnd she said \u201cthat is it, that\u2019s for covering and whatever you want to do with it.\u201d We\nwere so exhausted from the trip, from the separation, from the shearing our hair, from the\nstarvation, that we all fell asleep with the blanket, two to one blanket.",
        "The next day they took us to a different bunk and that bunk had some kind of\npreach beds. Like how you call, children have those kind of bed..",
        "I: Bunk beds?\nS: Bunk beds, that\u2019s right. So we were taken there and again counting, and this counting\nbusiness went sometimes three four times in a day, sometimes we had to be standing\noutside early in the morning. And in Auschwitz even though it was June, when we\narrived, the nights were very cold. Sometimes we were standing for four hours. Until the\nGermans, they arrived and counted us. The dogs surrounding us. Jumping. If they saw\nsomeone looked to them too pale or too skinny they would call out. At that time we did\nnot understand where they are taking them. Each day we were less and less. This was a\ncamp that it\u2019s called \u201cfirnektuslager\u201d, which means \u201celimination camp\u201d. Nobody was\nworking, nobody was doing nothing.

My best friend from my childhood,\nher name \u201cAniko weiss\u201d, who came down with scarlet fever after a few days we were in\nAuschwitz. We tried to hide her. We tried to hold her. We tried to massage her. We tried\nto give up our little bit of warm stew that we were given just to make sure that she should\nnot go to the hospital. But nothing helped, one day she collapsed from the high fever and\nshe went over to the hospital. But luckily there was one German nurse who had pity on\nher. She was a very beautiful 13 year old cheerful little girl, whose mother happened to\nbe with us. And she told her \u201cyou are enough good, go back. Don\u2019t stay here in the\nhospital.\u201d",

After we had been maybe, two three weeks in the concentration camp, lager B3\nBirkenau, they announced that all those children who are under the age of 16. From age,\nwhatever, they will remain alive, they should be lining up, they will be united with their\nparents, they will be given better food, they are going to have milk and cake and bread.\nWho didn\u2019t want to be united with the parents?

        "I: Now was Esther under sixteen also?",
        "S: Yes, Esther is two years older than I am. So we lined up. The two other sisters, the\nSolomon sisters, who were members of my father\u2019s congregation. They said, \u201coh you are\ngoing away, we will remain here\u201d because they were older. One of them was already\nmarried and the other one was 22, 23 years old.

I believe\nthat the German lady soldier, she would be saying this to me? Why is she saying this to\nme?

        "Many times, until this day, I feel guilty. Why I have been the one who was told if\nit was by the German soldier or by the soul of my mother or by an angel, or whatever.\nWhy the other girls had to go to their death. But that\u2019s fait, and perhaps god had a special\nreason to save us from that time from the death. So a lot of miracle things happened in\nAuschwitz.",
        "After a while we were taken over in the same camp to a different headquarters and\none night, I would never forget that, we heard tremendous screaming. There were no\nwindows. Only through the cracks of the wooden bunk we could be looking out. And we\nsaw a lot of fires and a lot of smoke going. All the gypsies who had been also taken to\nAuschwitz have been gassed that night. And the gypsies were very different in that\nmatter. The Jewish people, when they were taken to the gas chambers they were singing,\n\u201c\u201cshema yisrael\u201d they were saying their prayer. The gypsy people have no religion. They\nvery primitive people. They were trying to fight. They were trying to take their nails and\nattack the soldiers. It was such a night that it\u2019s still ringing in my ear the screaming of the\ngypsy people who were gassed that night. And the fire that we saw was their bodies that\nwere burned to ashes. That was the very first time that we really saw with our own eyes,\nthat there is a gas chamber and that there is fire. And from that day on we knew, that if\nyou are taken from this camp you are taken to the gas chamber and you are being burned.\nSO we were very much aware what is going on in Auschwitz.",
        "In about end of August, beginning of September, because the dates are not so\nclear, you know. Except that through some miraculous way, we were aware when is our\nholiday coming. There was always one girl, if we were marching, they used to take us to\nthe bath, to the collective bath, we would march near to the men\u2019s camp. They would\nalways used to scream names \u201cmaybe there is one relative, did you see this, did you see\nthat?\u201d They would also scream to us \u201cdid you know tomorrow is Shabbat?\u201d Or \u201cdid you\nknow that tomorrow is the new year?\u201d",
        "One day we were marching, and one of my uncle was screaming and asking if we\nsaw his wife Olga. So we knew that he is still alive. The mens were mainly in Auschwitz\nand they had been a little bit working. But what their work was exactly it\u2019s hard for me to\nknow.",

        "are going to choose some people for work. I had no choice because this time not age not\ngroup, not one part of the camp but the entire camp had to be naked, stand, and the\nGerman soldiers, and the head of them, Dr. Mengele that we called the Angel of Death,\nhe came. He started to count and after he was counting the entire camp, that was a few\nthousand girls. He started to point to the right again and to the left.\nI: How did you know that it was Dr. Mengele?\nS: We know it because when we arrived, the striped soldiers, the striped inmates, they\ntold us that there is a doctor whose name is Dr Mengele. And then later on the head of the\ncamp, who happened to be a Jewish girl, who was working for the Germans, she used to\nthrow this \u201coh wait till you meet this Dr. Mengele\u2019\u2019. So we knew that was Dr. Joseph\nMengele. He came and he started to point people, but this time the left meant that you\nremain still in Auschwitz and the right is the group that is going to leave the camp and is\ngoing to be taken to some kind of a factory to work. They said soldiers are very busy on\nthe front, they are fighting the war, and there are no more able people working in the\nfactories.",
        "So my sister has been chosen to go to work, and I to remain in the camp. Well I\ndidn\u2019t want to get separated from my sister and somehow I felt that if I were to remain\nhere I would not be able to endure anymore. Being together gave strength. Each one was\nstrengthening the other. We were each of us giving faith and strength to continue. So\nwhat should I do? I started to crawl on my stomach towards the group that has been\nchosen. One of the SS soldiers noticed me and beat with his bayonet on my back which\none there is still a mark of it. And he said in German \u201cuver fruchte yuden so vi vosh\ntard\u2019. \u201cYou devil jew, you will anyway die. Go where you want to go.\u201d I crawled into the\ngroup and again they started to count and count. Somehow I was very lucky that even\nthough they had counted again and again there has to be only three hundred 1n the group,\nhow it happened it was three hundred with me together. Now if somebody left because\nher sister was.. I can\u2019t tell you. At that time they took us to a train and we left Auschwitz.",
        "They planned to take us to a factory but the allies were by that time bombing.\nAmerican and British soldiers were already heavily fighting. And I remember that the\ntrain was going back and forth and back and forth. They couldn\u2019t really go advance\nbecause each time when the bombing was they would ship the train backwards to\nAuschwitz. So we didn\u2019t know, is this a new method of killing us? Because in the train\nwe again didn\u2019t have air, didn\u2019t have food. And we thought that we are going to die and\nno one will ever know what happened to us because we are in the train. However after\nthree four days of being shifting back and forth we arrived to a camp called Bergen-",

        "Belsen. And when we arrived to Bergen-Belsen that was exactly a day before our most\nholy day of the year, Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur is the atonement of the Jewish people,\nand we made a decision that we are going to fast.\nI: You and Esther decided\nS: That\u2019s right, and a few other friends who were with us in the camp. And the German\npeople there in Bergen-Belsen, they didn\u2019t do really nothing with us. No working, not so\nmuch roll calls. But in Bergen-Belsen the other problem existed that a lot of people came\ndown with typhoid fever. Dysentery. The food was a tiny bit even better than in\nAuschwitz. The day we requested that we want to fast, would they give us two portions.\nThey said, what are you crazy? Where you think you are back in Hungary? However, we\nfasted. We were in Bergen-Belsen sleeping on the bare floor. Little bit of straw somehow\nwe collected, and I remember that I came down with infection of my gums. My whole\nface was swollen from it. Yet I did not dare go to the infirmary because by that time we\nhad enough knowledge that if you go to the infirmary that\u2019s the end of you.\nI: Back to Yom Kippur, so you and Esther and some friends fasted, and did you observe\nin any other way the fast?\nS: No we couldn\u2019t. Except there were a few prayers that we remembered. Some older\ngirls who remembered some little part of the prayer. We would be singing together, or\nsaying together. On Yom Kippur. And we remained in Bergen-Belsen for a couple\nweeks. And then at last we were taken to another camp called Rochlitz where there was\nreally a factory, and it amazes me until this day that not only that they took us to work,\nbut they were teaching us certain technical measurements. We were schooled. They were\nhoping, the Germans, that the war would take such a long time, or that they will be\nenslaving us for such a duration of time, or just this is the way of the Germans to educate\nall the time, it was amazing. Every evening we were taken to a school for two weeks and\nwe were learning special kinds of measurements of little airplane appliances. The factory\nwhere we were working was doing all kind of little tools and gadgets for airplanes.",
        "In that factory we worked three shifts. Each time eight hours. Sometimes in the\nnight, sometimes in the day, sometimes in the evening. And the foreman, who happened\nto be a German fellow, was having such a pitty on me, and I am until this day very\nthankful for him that he used to call me in into his office, and close the door, and give me\na little bit of his fareena. He was always eating cooked fareena in the morning. So I\nalways looked forward to the shift when I worked in the morning because that day I new",

        "One day while I was in his office, eating the farina, the German soldiers who came\nonce in a while to observe if we are working, if we are producing, if we are doing our job\ncomes. And she sees me inside. He quickly grabbed the plate and threw it down. He\nstarted to scream at me \u201cso tomorrow you know better how to measure the appliance that\nyou have to do!!?\u201d I understood that that was a cover up. He himself could be in trouble\nfavoring or doing anything for me.",
        "While we were in that camp, it came our holiday Hanukah. The holiday of lighting\nthe menorah. We wanted so much to light because we were so broken by then.\nSpiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically. We thought that maybe that would cheer\nus up. That would give us some kind of a hope. Thinking how the war between the\nGreeks and the Jewish people took place many years ago. Maybe that light would bring\nin some kind of warmth. But where do we have, where do we have a menorah? Where do\nwe have oil? What can we do?",
        "There were girls who were working in the kitchen, that was cooking for us that\nlittle bit of food. And one of the girls said, \u201cyou know girls let\u2019s not talk about it. I\u2019m\ngoing to bring home some kind of potato. We will cut the potato and carve it and make\nfrom it a menora. Low and behold, every evening she put one potato until she had four\npotatoes, cut it in half, scooped it out. I don\u2019t know how we did it but we did it. And now\nis the problem where we have to get some kind of an oil to light the menorah. So the\nother girl who was working, she said \u201cjust don\u2019t talk about it, \u2019m going to find\nsomething\u201d. She found an old bottle, she filled it in a little bit of oil that was used for\ncooking. So now we have potato and oil but we don\u2019t have the wicks. What are we going\nto do? So we tore from our one dress that we had. We had no underwear. We tore and we\nmade wicks. And we put it in the oil. Dipped it. We had no matches. There was one\nsoldier who every evening used to come and go by the little houses and the time we were\nput up four to a little house. This was a camp that was taken away, a working for a\nsummer camp or some sort of thing. It had small tiny little houses and four girl to each\ntiny little house. And the soldier used to come to see if it was quiet if everybody is doing\nwhat they are supposed to do. I went out and I said to the soldier \u201cyou know what? I need\ndesperately just one match if you would give me.\u201d",
        "He says \u201cfor what?\u201d I said \u201cwell don\u2019t ask too many questions, could you give me\none match and he threw his match. We lit the Hanukah candle the next evening. And we\nwere all crying. And the whole camp came to that one house and they said \u201chow did you\nget this? how did you make it?\u201d And we remembered one Hanukah song and we were\nsinging the song and that gave us strength. We are human, we are celebrating a holiday.\nWe are not completely oppressed.",
        "23",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "And the soldiers who came to check this evening was a different one. Well he was\nhimself, a few came started to knock on the door. \u201cWhat are you doing? Where do you\nthink you are? You are inmates. This is an N. O. No you can\u2019t have Hanukah candle\u201d.\nThey didn\u2019t say Hanukah candle, they said you can\u2019t have fire in your house. Out. Out.",
        "And we had to kneel on our knees for four hours as punishment that we dared. But\nwe were all smiling to each other. Never mind this kneeling. What we did, we showed to\nthe Germans that we are still human beings. And what they are aiming, to completely\ndestroy us, our emotions, our spirit, they did not succeed.",
        "Many times when I am asked \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you revolt?\u201d Our main revolt was\nshowing that we are human. Physically we couldn\u2019t. We were surrounded with barbed\nwires with electric wires. We could never escape. But we always tried to remain human.\nTo help each other. To try to celebrate here and there a certain holiday. This way\nrevolted, we showed to them that as much you try to destroy us, you can\u2019t completely\ndestroy our spirit.",
        "I: so your religion really helped you to keep going?\nS: A lot, a lot.\n[break]\nI: You were talking about how important religion was for helping you survive\nS: well all the time that we had been in the camp, religion gave us a lot of strength. And\nthe devotion to keep religion, and the devotion to each other, the helpfulness of one to\nanother gave strength. And wherever we could observe any of the customs or holidays, I\nthink that spiritually, mentally, emotionally, gave us uplift and strength. I remember\nthere was in Bergen Belsen a girl who was with us remains in Jerusalem, who would\ncollect in an old broken can some rain water in order that she could wash her hand to that\nlittle rationed tiny bit of bread and bless over it so she can thank god for sustaining her\nlife and giving food. I remember celebrating in Auschwitz the day that we call tisha be\u2019av\nand we are remembering the destruction of the holy temple in Jerusalem. We fasted. And\nbeing able to do all these things gave us a lot of emotional strength as well spiritual\nstrength. I would say that most of the people who had faith, who had religion, who tried\nto say certain prayers that they remembered or here and there smuggled in people a\nprayer book. And we were at least once in a week saying some kind of a prayer, they\nwere the ones who could take the suffering. And they were the ones who were able to",
        "24",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "overcome a lot of the hardship. I would say that people who had no faith, and mainly\npeople who came from very spoiled backgrounds, very well to do people who never\nknew any kind of hardship, they were the first one. At least from my experience, the ones\nwho came from mischkoltz, who came from Onod, if 1 look and I see who remained from\nthe holocaust. Definitely from my hometown all the girls who came from very well to do\nfamilies, not one of them came back. Even though that I come from a middle class family\nand I had a maid. My mother always made sure that we have some kind of job such as\nmaking beds, washing the dishes, and we always used to ask her, why not morishka our\nmade? Why do we have to do? And mother said you never know when you will need it.",
        "And I am very thankful for her, having this foresight. If it was for Auschwitz or\nfor my life later on, I think it was very beneficial and very special. I thank for my parents\nthat they raised me to have faith in god and whenever anything very bad happened I knew\nalways to whom to turn. It was my god.",
        "Now I am going to go back to my camp where I had been working and where we\ncelebrated Hanukah. In the middle of January, one day we were just roaming around in\nthe camp. The group that was in the factory was in the factory. The girls who were\nworking in the kitchen. And the group that was off, we were just roaming, trying to\nbreath a little fresh air. Suddenly from far away we see a column of men marching. And\nthey were very very tired, very weak, some of them in striped clothing. They were\nscreaming, the \u201cwar is over.\u201d We thought they were crazy. How could the war be over if\nwe are still in a camp and they are marching? But they probably had some kind of\nknowledge that the allies are advancing.",
        "They passed by, we didn\u2019t know nothing what their fait was. We continued to\nwork. However, about two three weeks later, we were told we have to empty this camp\nand we are to be taken to a new concentration camp. We were taken to a new\nconcentration camp called graslitz.",
        "Graslitz was a jailhouse. We were put up, it was emptied or it was an old jailhouse\nI do not know. But we were 1800 girls. We were put up in a jail house. They had bunk\nbeds. We were given very meager food there. Only twice in a day. The German soldiers\nkept on saying \u201cwe don\u2019t have any more food either so we can\u2019t provide for you\u201d. Every\nmorning they would march us a few kilometers away from the jailhouse under the\nsupervision, the guard of the SS soldiers to a huge mountain. We had to chainline from\nthe top of the mountain to the bottom of the mountain. On the top of the mountain was a\nhuge pile of stones. We had to take those stones down. But how? One was throwing it to\nthe other person. And if you dropped it, you were beaten up. And we thought at least we\nare instrumental, we are going to help to build something, that\u2019s why we are taking the\nstones down. But the next day came our surprise, we had to pile the stones and take up",

        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "from the bottom to the top of the mountain. And this went on for a couple of weeks. It\nwas just to destroy us. Cause even if you are enslaved and you work and you see that\nsomething is growing from it something this built from it, you have a certain kind of\nmeaning, satisfaction, you feel that you are instrumental. But just to work, to make fun of\nus, to belittle us, to make a mockery of us was very bad for our morale. And some of the\ngirls said \u201c1 wish 1 collapse already, who wants to live anymore? there is no end to this.\nwe are not going to make it, we have no family anymore.\u201d",
        "We have been in that camp and doing this work about middle of march, end of\nmarch. One day the SS group of soldiers comes in and they said stand up next to your\nbed, we have to have a serious talk. We thought that they are going to shoot us. Why\ndon\u2019t they take us to work anymore. They said \u201cwell we have to tell you you have a\nchoice. either you stay in this jailhouse, but we leaving the building, and we don\u2019t\nprovide you with any food or guarding you. What will happen to you will happen to you.\nOr you line up five in a column and you march with us. We have to leave this place.\u201d",
        "We didn\u2019t understand why they had to leave the place. Why they are offering for\nus that we can stay. No one of us dared to remain. Because who 1s going to provide us\nfood? They may lock the door, we won\u2019t ever be allowed to go out. The windows had\niron bars. The door had iron bars. If they close us we will suffocate us. So everybody\nmarched out, one thousand eight hundred girls and they were marching with us, which is\ncalled the death march. For six weeks. Marching every single day. Sometimes 40\nkilometers, sometimes 35 kilometers. And we were sometimes sleeping outside on the\nbare ground, sometimes I remember this was sude deuitchland this was the cold still in\nMarch and in April fairly heavy. Sometimes on the top of the snow we went to sleep. We\nwere licking the snow because we were not given any kind of drink. No food. We were\ncollecting some of the grass.",
        "Once in a while they would take us to a big barn where we were given some straw.\nThe animals on one side and we on the other. And I don\u2019t have to describe to you what\nsmells we had there. And we went to sleep. We collapsed, hungry, wet, sometimes from\nrain or snow. Without food. In the morning many times I wanted to get up when they\ncalled us to get up and I couldn\u2019t move. People laying on me. I would call \u201cplease would\nyou get up, would you move, we have to line up\u201d. They don\u2019t move, they are dead. Each\nday, less and less of us remained. My sister, who was two years older than I am. She just\nasked me \u201cplease leave me here, I don\u2019t want to go anymore.\u201d Her leg was all swollen,\nshe lost her shoe. She had swollen legs, she had pus in her leg. She couldn\u2019t move any\nmore. I used to grab her. I the young one the skinny one. But very determined. My\npersonality I am very active, until this day. I used to put her on my shoulder and a little\nbit carry her and I would say to her \u201cI can\u2019t carry you more but you have to go because",

If we were lucky,\nonce in a while they would be able to ask the farmer if they have some leftover potato\nthat they cook for the pigs. And we would be jumping on it. That would be a feast for us.\nMany times we were given flour and we would just lick the flour. Once I remember we\nwere going, marching and by the roads in Germany, in sude deutchland there are ditch\nnext to the road and we would find some rotten apple we would pick up and we would be\njust eating. Sometimes if the Germans, they noticed that you went off from the road even\nfor one single minute to grasp an apple, they would shoot the person. If some person\ncould walk any more, couldn\u2019t march, they would be shooting the people.",
        "One evening we arrived to a farm and before we were even given the opportunity\nto go to sleep in the barn, one of the German soldiers and the rest somehow, they were\nnot there. One of the soldiers, a very handsome young fellow, he starts to talk to us.\nBefore they wouldn\u2019t talk to us we were like dogs in their eyes, even the dogs they were\ntalking better than to us. But this time he comes over and he says \u201cI have to tell you a big\nsecret. I am actually Jew. My mother was a Jewish person, my father was a German. And\nI enlisted to the SS in order that I can help you.\u201d",
        "We were shocked, you know, \u201cyou helped us? you used to beat us up? you used to\nshoot the girls who were standing who could not move any more and now you are telling\nus.. what is the reason you are telling us that you want so much for us to find favor in our\neyes.\u201d But we could not think anymore clearly. He said \u201cbut I am going to get for you\ntonight also food. And I am good, right I am good to you?\u201d",
        "So we were not responding to it. We just waited if he really is going to give us\nfood. At that moment the only thing that we wanted was to drink something to eat\nsomething and to be able to go to sleep a bit. So low and behold he brought us again\nsome kind of cooked potato that was half rotten, was cooked always. Those days that\u2019s\nwhat they fed usually the pigs. We ate and we went to sleep.",
        "The next day we were marching and in the morning we left that barn and we went\nby a bridge. And we looked, how beautiful that water and how lovely it would be to go\ndown and just wash our face. We are full with lice, our clothing is full with lice, we are\ndirty we haven\u2019t been drinking, we haven\u2019t been washing ourselves for weeks already.\nCould we go down? No, the German soldiers are surrounding us with their huge dogs and\nthey are keeping us, telling us go fast, we have to march, we have to get to a place. We\nare marching, and then towards the evening we see that we are back in that very same\nplace. And this went on a few days, that they surrounded us in that very small spot maybe\ntwo three little towns but each time we are back to the same spot. So we started to think it\nmust be something going on that they can\u2019t take us further away. But still we didn\u2019t",

The rest collapsed either died during the night in the barns or were\nshot by the Germans.\nI: Esther was still with you?\nS: Esther was all the time, and the two sisters. That what I think gave a lot of strength to\neach other. That we remained all the time from day one to the end of the war together. As\nwe are walking, each one of us feels that any minute we are going to collapse. And what\nwill happen to us if we collapse, we will be shot or we will expire anyway from no food\nno strength nothing. One of the Solomon sisters, the older one, Mindy, she said \u201cI am\ngoing to sit down in the ditch. If they kill me they kill me. I have been married already, I\ntasted life already. But if they don\u2019t shoot, then you all come and join me later.\u201d So she\nsits down in the ditch, and no German soldier is coming back or shooting or counting or\nseeing who is here. And we don\u2019t see the German soldiers. They went ahead of the\ncolumn. So we went back and we sat down with her. And we\u2019re sitting all four of us in\nthe ditch next to the road. We hear some shooting and we got very scared. We thought,\noh, this is a trick they just let us to sit but they will return back and they are going to kill\nus. So we look around, where can we go? Who will take us? There are no houses.\nOpposite of the road we see a little forest. We say lets go into the forest and hide there.\nWe go over the road. We go into the forest. We are hiding in the forest.",

But\nthe first thing, we look around in the forest. Maybe we find something, grass an apple,\ngarbage. Nothing we find. We shake out our blanket, which was full with lice and lets sit\ndown. Because if we are going to walk around we are wasting what little strength we\nhave. We sitting down and we hear some kind of little noise. So we see a little creek. We\nwent, we drank from that water. We washed our face. We started to say a little prayer that\nwe remembered by heart. We sat down and we started to cry. What will be our fait? What\nwill happen to us? As we are sitting, and we are quiet holding each other hand, suddenly\nwe hear a rooster and the mooing of a cow.

And they were going according to the noise of\nthe cow. And thank god that it was not far really, it was at the edge of the forest, a little\nfarm. And they went and they begged and they got some mashed potato and in a little jar\na little bit of milk. They came back, we had a feast. We sat down and we ate and then we\nmade a decision that we can\u2019t sleep all in one time because just in case we hear that the\nGerman\u2019s coming back we have to go more deep maybe we have to hide whatever, two\neach time was sleeping, two each time was sitting and waiting. We rotated. It was early in\nthe morning, about 4:30, 5:00 in the morning. It was still dark outside. Suddenly we hear\na tremendous noise between the trees.

He said ok, and he points to the barn that we should be going there. We\ndidn\u2019t want to go into the barn so we went into the yard and we sat down in the grass.\nThe woman who was his cook, she brought out again mashed potato and this time warm\nmilk and we eat and we very happy and we sitting in the fresh air.",

For a few days until I got used to it, first the pillow and slowly I got back\nand I slept in the bed.",
        "About three days later unfortunately my sister came down with a very high fever\nand the two other sisters. All three had to be put in leibeshitza, a nearby city. And they\nhad to be put up in a hospital, they all came down with typhoid fever. And I started to\ngain weight and my hair started to grow and I started to look human. These priest was\nvery kind, every day he wanted to learn with me. He was learning with me Hebrew. He\nsaid \u201chow about you become my daughter, you become catholic. I will provide you with\neverything\u201d. I told him I really appreciate everything but I am the daughter of a rabbi and\nI promised my parents that whatever will happen I will remain faithful to my own faith.\nFrom that day on he never bothered me, he was very kind to me. Then there were\nCzechoslovakian soldiers in the town who had a special headquarter and you could go to\ntheir headquarter if you were a refugee, if you were an inmate from a camp and they\nwould give you a little bit of clothing. They would direct you a little bit. I told them only\none thing that I am requesting is if I could get a bicycle so I can go in to the other city\nwhere my sister and my friends are in the hospital so I can go and visit them. Low and\nbehold they gave me, how they got for me a bicycle I really don\u2019t know. They gave me a\nbicycle, they gave me a scarf that until this day I think I never got such a scarf in my life.\nI started to put around my head, around my neck. The humanity started to come back.\nThe woman in me. To look decent, to look human. The lady who was the cook of the\npriest, she would bake with me cookie that I should take to the hospital. I was at first\nshaking, how can I ride the bike? I haven\u2019t been riding the bike for over a year.",

Until one day I felt this is\nquite dangerous on the road. There were still Russian army coming in and they were not\nthe nicest. Except this one fellow who liberated us, the rest were not so nice. There\u2019s a lot\nwhat to talk about. I just felt very bad, also my sister was very very sick. Her mind wasn\u2019t\nanymore there. So I begged the head doctor if he could give me some job in the hospital\nso I can be near to my sister. I told him otherwise she will die.\nI: you were talking about asking for a job in the hospital where your sister was\nS: so the doctor looked at me and he said \u201cwhat do you think, you look skeleton, you\nwant to have a job?\u201d I explained to the doctor the need that I have to be near to my sister.\nHe told me that it\u2019s ok I can be in the hospital, I can be in a... he said to me \u201cI understand\nthe need for you to be near to your sister and I tell you, there is a little porch that is\nenclosed. I am going to provide there a little bed. You be there, you don\u2019t have to work\nhere, unless if you want to cheer up the sick people here. I see that you have some special\nability in you, and that you are a very cheerful type of a person\u2019. I said \u201cyes indeed I\nshould be cheerful, do you know what I went through and look, I am here and I am\nnormal\u201d. So they made me a little room and that was very near to the bed of my sister.\nShe was unconscious and yet I used to rub her feet. And I used to talk to her, and slowly\nand surely she came back to her self. The other two girls also got better. I used to go to\nthe other sick people and sing for them songs that I remembered from my childhood. My\nsister got better.",
        "When she was released from that hospital they told us we are not allowed to leave.\nGoing back, we wanted to go back to Hungary, we wanted to see maybe somebody\nremained from the family. We hoped for my brother, who was the oldest, he was 17 years\nold. We thought that maybe he came back. Maybe our father because he went from\nAuschwitz to Mauthausen. We didn\u2019t know that he perished later on. Maybe someone is\nalive, but they said that we can\u2019t travel, she\u2019s much too weak for such a trip. How they\norganized it I really don\u2019t know, but we were given a room and a kitchen and every few\ndays we had to go back to the hospital to check up with my sister. At that time I came\ndown also with some kind of, I had stapylococcus infection, all over , all kind of things\non my body. The Russian doctor came, and without any anesthesia without anything she\ncame and cut, I have marks. Painful, but at least I got healed.

Two of them were in the Jewish\nghetto. In a miraculous way they remained with their whole family. But they didn\u2019t have\nplace for us because after the war, everybody was living together.

        "We were put into an orphanage home. Our education began right away. It\u2019s\namazing how people survived and were right away active and organized schooling for\nchildren. We both went to school. Although my sister had to be in a sanatorium for a\ncouple more months but once she was released from there, you see the typhoid fever was\nso strong that once it attacked her lungs and she had to recuperate fully from the sickness.\nWe both had been in school. In 1946 at the beginning of the year, they were talking about\nthat all the orphan children should go to Israel because the memories are much too heavy\nto be in Hungary. We can\u2019t return to our hometown, we have no parents. Maybe if we are\nin anew environment, maybe if we are in a new country we will be easier to forget,\npsychologically it would be easier to transition from the terrible experience that we went\nthrough. I didn\u2019t want so much to go yet because I wanted at least that one school year to\nend. I felt that 1t was deprived so much from my education. However they said that even\nthough I didn\u2019t finish the year, since I was doing very good, they are going to give me\ncredit for that year.",

Even though the Britains knew what we went through, they were\nnot much fond to admit us to Israel. We were a lot of orphans and a lot of broken people\nand we went on the deck of the boat and the British boat came to great us. They wanted\nto send us to Cyprus. We begged them that please we are so broken, we need to get out\nfrom here. We need to be in the country. After a whole long discussion they admitted us\nto Israel. We were put in a camp again for three weeks. But then some teachers from the\nJewish agency came and released first the young children, and I arrived in 1946 in June\nto Jerusalem. I was put up in an orphanage home and I went to school.",

        "So now I would like to tell, I have first been in the ghetto in resyur, then I was in\nthe brick factory in mishkoltz, we were taken to Auschwitz, I was in the Birkenau lager,\nand the camp was named B3 which one was meant a camp of elimination. Every day they\neliminated it was called the fernichtemslager, it was death camp. From there, luckily it\nwas the end of September I was taken to Bergen Belsen. In December from Bergen\nBelsen to rochlitz where we worked in a munition factory. We made little appliances for\nairplanes, from rochlitz we were taken to graslitz.

So I said to\nthem Naomi because in my papers it said the official name. They said \u201coh this is not a\nJewish girl\u201d.

It was like a\nvocational school, they learned also some kind of trade. Either being a tailor or being a\nshoemaker or carpenter. My grandfather believed that a person should have some kind of\na trade. Not depend on it that somewhere he is going to have an income. I am very proud\nof him, that\u2019s how I think we should be in life, combining the two. It\u2019s one thing not\nenough. You have to have both.

        "that you and your sister Esther went to Prague for a day and then to Budapest. Can we\npick up there and then you tell what happened when you arrived in Budapest?\nS: First I want to go back to a minute to Prague. The main reason that we went back to\nPrague (A) it was on the way but mainly because that was a center for information, who\nthe people survived. There were charters already put up in the Jewish center and the\ntemple there and we looked if our father and brother survived. Somehow we knew that\nmother perished at the very beginning there in Auschwitz. However we didn\u2019t find their\nnames and we still had slight hope. We didn\u2019t want to spend any more time in Prague.\nWe took the very first opportunity of train and we went to Budapest. As we arrived to\nBudapest by the train station was big trucks waiting for the survivors, which was\norganized by the joint. Joint is an organization from America, Jewish Organization\nhelping refugees. I really don\u2019t know the details of the name, but it\u2019s a well known\norganization. It\u2019s in existence until this day. They help out in the diaspora in many many\nother countries people who are in need of help. They greeted us, they took us to a\nheadquarters that they established in a school for the refugees that came back and had no\nfamily. As we were going through the streets of Budapest, suddenly I noticed that we\nwere passing by the house where my aunt lived and I started to scream this 1s \u2018hunadeter\u2019,\nthis is the street where my aunt lives. However they did not let anybody to get off\nbecause they were not sure that anybody survived in that address, if that aunt is really\nalive. So we continued and we went to that place that was established for the refugees\nand after a day somebody from that orphanage home visited the place, her name is Esther\nEckshtein who today is still alive and lives in Israel in the city of Bnei Brak. She was the\nhead of that orphanage home and she made every effort to collect as many Jewish girls\nwho remained after the holocaust and try to bring them to the orphanage home that she\nestablished in Budapest immediately after the liberation. To try to reeducate again those\npeople who lost over a year, some of us more of schooling. So the orphanage home was\nlocated in Budapest and she took us, not only me and my sister, but a lot of girls who\narrived in the transport back to Budapest and we were put up in the orphanage home\nwhere we had regular schooling during the day. How she organized this, from where she\ngot the money and the energy, herself a survivor, who was for many years first hiding in\nBudapest, then caught and sent to a concentration camp in Theresienstadt. Upon her\nreturn, that was her aim and dream that as many children that survived she wants to see\nthem being educated again.",

So we were studying\u2014\nI: How did that feel to you to be 1n that situation?\nS: In that situation, in a way I was missing the home atmosphere. Having my home. Also\nI have to tell you, two uncles and one aunt remained alive in Budapest. I had been\nvisiting them once in a while. We had free time we could go visiting museums or books\nin the library. Each time that we had that kind of period I would jump over and go to visit\nmy aunt. It was very traumatic to see that they lived in their own home, they had their\nown furniture, it was a family life. Here we had no family life whatsoever.\nI: Did you wish that your aunt would invite you to live with her?\nS: Not really. Because not being in the camps, she had not enough understand what we\nwent through. In a way I cherished that I am together with people that had the very same\nfait that we had. We had more understanding of our moods, our crying, our not being\nable to cope sometimes with the regular daily situation. Because we were together. We\nhad all together that very same background that very same kind of fait and we helped\neach other to overcome.\nI: What were the moods and the crying and the difficulty coping like?\nS: well it was very difficult, we had no mommy with whom we could discuss. In a simple\nway our menstruation our monthly period did not return yet back because of our\nstarvation and the medication that we got in Germany. It would be lovely to talk over it\nthe mommy and to hear from a mother, don\u2019t worry eventually it will happen. Or\nmommy would say lets go to a doctor. We had to deal with all little and big problems by\nour self. Even though we had teachers and the mother of the orphanage home. But it\u2019s not\nthe same with talking to your own mother.\nI: So you were able to talk to these people but it was not as helpful as talking to your own\nmother.\nS: It was not as easy. Maybe helpful it was because they did seek out doctors to take us\nand have checkups but it wasn\u2019t the same like talking with your own mother. You are shy\n36",

So we were missing family very much so. In the light that Budapest family life\nmore or less returned to normalcy, because the ones who remained, remained intact. To\nsee was a contrast to the life that we maintained in an orphanage home. But really I have\nto praise that there were three teachers beside this Esther Eckshtein, whose name today is\nEsther Weinberg. There were two other teachers, who she really recruited them, very\nknowledgeable girls and they all are still alive. One of them in Brooklyn New York and\nthe other is in Israel.\nI: Do you have contact with them?\nS: Ido have contact with them. In fact this past summer I was in Israel and Esther, who\nwas the head teacher and the head of this whole organization of the orphanage home and\nseeking, looking after us. She put together an evening in honor of my visiting Israel. It\nwas very moving because some, very few who remained still from that school that\norphanage, came to greet me. I am in very strong contact with Esther. However the other\nteacher, Rachel, was also there. The third one, Miriam Gross, she is less involved with\nthe group. If it has to do with it that she moved away from the circle of the girls. The\nmajority of the students from that orphanage home are living in Israel. But I visit often\nIsrael so I am in touch with the teachers. Each time very interesting reminder of the era\nthat we all went through together after the war.\nI: Is it partly upsetting to you to visit again with them?\nS: Really not. In fact as the years pass by I am more and more admiring their mission\ntheir undertaking and all the effort and attention they gave us. For instance I remember\nthat Esther went to a sewing lady and ordered for all of us beautiful blouse and beautiful\nskirt in honor of one celebration. To give back to us a feeling of humanity. To feel good\nabout our self and to look good! Which was very important we had no clothing. We came\nback from the concentration camp, a matter of fact my winter coat was a German soldiers\narmy coat that I shortened and somebody helped me to change the buttons that I should\nfeel a little bit better. Here was a woman, you have to understand that at the time the\nsituation in Budapest was very difficult. I\u2019m talking about time that it was still under\nregime of the Russian army. People were standing for bread in the street. Clothing was a\nrarity. So we didn\u2019t feel that outcast with out poor clothing, and yet she was driving and\ndoing everything to get for us some dresses some blouses some skirt that we should be\n37",

Just stopping when the train stopped, stopping these girls of continuing\ntheir trip. Grabbing them and taking them down. Whatever they did with them, that could\nbe understood.\nI: Were you frightened to travel by yourself on the train?\nS: Very much so and I rarely traveled if at all. The only trip that I took once was with my\naunt to Onod. I don\u2019t know if I told you this that my mother before we left, she hid some\nof the family pictures and some silverware by a gentile lady. My aunt wanted very much\nthat we should have some mementos from our parents. So we traveled together and my\naunt was putting a babushka on me. I should not look decent, I should look very\nfrightened, very skinny which I was anyway, and very pale. But she was protecting me. I\ndon\u2019t think that ever I would travel by myself, at all in those days.\nI: When you had time off by the orphanage did you walk by yourself to your aunts.\nS: We walked, but never alone. Never alone. We would never walk alone. Never in the\nevening. It was mainly in the daytime. Luckily it wasn\u2019t too far from my aunt. If I visited\nmy aunt I would always watch my watch that if it\u2019s starting in winter already to be dark,\nwe would be heading to go back to the orphanage home.\nI: So you were very cautious.\nS: Very cautious, yes.\nI: And when you went back to Onod with your aunt to see if you could find the mementos\nwhat happened?\nS: When we went back to Onod to find the mementos we came in and she was a neighbor\nof us and she greeted us very friendly.

That somehow I couldn\u2019t grasp it. Why would the Russian\narmy take pictures? I do know that they took usually watches or jewelry that they were\nlooking for. But the pictures I couldn\u2019t understand. But I think that she felt that if she\u2019s\nlooking in the drawer for the pictures then other things will come up, I really can\u2019t figure\nout exactly, I don\u2019t want to accuse.

They did find their little home. They\nwere somehow not afraid of living in the hometown. One of them who was married found\nher husband. He came back. So was a man protecting them. You know it was a very\ndifferent kind of a situation. They lived together the husband and the wife and the sister.\nEventually after a very short time being in Onod they moved to a bigger city called\nMishkoltz, which 1s the nearest city to Onod. There were many Jewish people who either\ncame back and found someone of the family or they established again a family life. Some\npeople got married a couple months after the holocaust. They were at the age of marriage\nand they wanted to have some kind of a family life. A home life. So in Mishkoltz there\nwas already a fairly dynamic Jewish life again. They established school, they had a\ntemple, they had a visiting rabbi. I never participated in any of the activities there because\nI was in Budapest, but even until today there are a few families who are in Mishkoltz who\nhappened to be from Onod and survivors.

        "I: In a previous interview you talked some about your faith, but what was your religious\nlife like now in Budapest?\nS: In Budapest the orphanage home was an orthodox religious home. We had been\nconducting the same type of life that I was brought up at home. Praying, blessing over the\nbread, rest according to the code of the religion. It was more or less the very same one. It\nis really amazing because a lot of people who survived they like, so to say, turned away\nfrom God. As the head of yeshiva university, Dr. Lam, once I had a very interesting\ndiscussion with him, and he said to me \u201cyou know Yaffa, I am not surprised the ones who\nturned away after the holocaust. To me it is most surprising the ones who remained\nfaithful such as you.\u201d Many of them who really completely turned away eventually\nrecovered from the traumatic experience and slowly came back to the realization that\neven though this terrible thing happened, still there is God. It could be that for some kind\nof a reason he turned away. Or he let things to happen in the world. But definitely there is\na God. Unfortunately a lot of people just can\u2019t cope with it. They have so much anger and\nso much disappointment in God that they can\u2019t return back again. I feel very lucky and\nvery fortunate that it did not effect me and I remained the same faithful person that my\nparents brought me up. I pity the ones that can\u2019t recognize the hand of God because I\nthink that it gives me a certain strength. In my whole life, if it has to do with coping with\nwhat I went through or the daily life today. To see the creation and not to believe that it\nwas created by God. To see a beautiful day like today, the sun is shining, the renewal of\nnature. How all this is taking place, yes science has to do with it, but definitely above all\nis God. I pity the ones who can\u2019t see and recognize his presence.\nI: How do you explain to yourself all the terrible things that happened?\nS: You\u2019re asking me a very difficult question because I am all the time trying to answer\nto myself this tremendous puzzling question. Why it took place. Why I had to lose my\nparents. Why 6 million Jews and so many gentiles and so many gypsies who were\ninnocent. Mainly the most hurting and painful for me is whenever I think of the 1.5\nmillion children who were completely innocent. Even if we want to blame or put any\nkind of pressure on people, or to say it came to them because they did something, but\nwhat did children do, they are innocent. So that is most puzzling. The only way that I can,\nis that it\u2019s above my human understanding. Because there is no explanation for it. The\ngreatest nation, the most cultured, the most educated people were the Germans. The\npeople of science, the people of so many good things, music, you name it, they really\nknew. That they could go down to such a level and to be so cruel and so systematically\n41",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "and in so organized a way, to kill out so many people it\u2019s beyond my human\nunderstanding. I feel that is for me the best answer. There are things that we know, we\nhave a great sage, his name was Rambam. One of our great scholars in Judaism who said\nthat \u201cyou are allowed to search the ways of God, but when there is no answer that means\nthat it\u2019s above a human ability to understand.\u201d I can cope with that answer. I don\u2019t buy\nany kind of answer that they were mad, that they killed the Jews because the Jews were\nrich or all kind of other explanation. They took away their jobs.. There is no justification\nwhatsoever to kill so many million people in such a cruel way except this is one of the\nthings that we don\u2019t understand.\nI: So your very strong faith continued throughout\nS: I think so, that that helped me all the time. Wherever I have been I always felt the\npresence of God. All the miracles that happened to me during the holocaust and after. I\nfeel that he was watching over me. We all survivors have that kind of question, why me\nand not others? It\u2019s not always the easiest thing to live with that kind but you have to\nbelieve that there is a special reason. Why some of us and so few of us remained after the\nholocaust, perhaps to tell the story, to teach people to be careful. When you are angry you\nhave to calm down. It\u2019s a lesson. If it\u2019s not taken as a lesson for humanity, to be careful\nand to know how to conduct yourself in daily life too, with your neighbors with your\nfriends, with your family, then the holocaust was in vain. If we learn from it if we better\nour way our way of life and the whole of humanity is learning from it than at least it\nwasn\u2019t completely in vain. Otherwise, why so many people?\nI: So that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re doing today.\nS: Yeah.\nI: So you were in the orphanage until about May \u201946?\nS: Until about end of April. It was very interesting, teaching a little bit, even though I was\nfourteen years old, but what I learned I was teaching to younger children. In the\norphanage home.\nI: What subject were you teaching?\nS: All kind of subjects, mainly math. From childhood on I was a very good student in\n42",

It just so happened that\nwas my best subject. So I was teaching to the younger group and then one evening they\ngathered us in our social hall and they said that there is an organized group that is going\nto Palestine, who would like to join? They told us that it\u2019s a difficult journey, it\u2019s not\nlegal, the British people don\u2019t want Jewish people to come to Palestine but we are going\nto organize and you will be put into schools and orphanage home. It was something that\nappealed very much to us. You have to understand that wherever we turned it reminded\nus the hostility and the abandonment and the cruelty of people. How did they let all this\nto happen? Why didn\u2019t they try to hide us? Why didn\u2019t they try to go against the German\nregime? Why didn\u2019t they try to fight for us? So we were not happy to be in Europe. We\nwanted to get away from there. It reminded us too much. Wherever we turned. I\nremember going in the street and suddenly crying, why? because I remembered that the\nlast time that I was in Budapest was when my father and mother took me to the big zoo.\nIn a way we were happy because we had clothing, we had food, we had good friends, we\nhad been in school. But everything reminded us of the tragedy that had happened to our\nnation. We arranged just to leave. So when this announcement came that we can go to\nPalestine, we were very happy.",

From there to\ngo to Israel. We joined it.",
        "I: Who was organizing this group?\nS: It was a zionist group organizing this group, based in Budapest.\nI: They wanted to help children get to Palestine.\nS: That\u2019s right. They knew that emotionally, it would be the best for the children. To be\naway from all the environment that reminds them constantly of what took place. To go to\na new country where most of the year is spring, that alone, being more free.\nI: The group was going to be all children.\nS: The group was mainly children or young people.

They put some\nbenches in a truck, closed the truck with blankets. During the night we went through the\nborder. I really don\u2019t know how they arranged this with the Romanian government that\nthey closed their eyes that these refugees are going through the border. We were stranded\nthen in Bucharest, which is the capital of Romania, for about six weeks. Also in a Jewish\norganized home. Again, just girls together, and our teachers were with us. We continue\neven on the truck, we were continuing learning. They were very much into that that the\nkids should not suffer any lack of education. That all what had been deprived from us\nduring the year or some were longer in the camp, should be given back to them, to\neducate again, in a way to be also busy with knowledge instead of too much time\nthinking.\n[break]\nI: You were talking about stopping in Bucharest for six weeks, and how the lessons\ncontinued during the trip.\nS: Yes we had been stranded in Bucharest because the dealing with the boat company\ntook a long time till they organized and purchase the boat, till they find a person who was\nready to maintain the boat and take the group to Palestine.\nI: How many were in the group?\nS: We were 1800. Half of it or the majority of 1t were girls, and the other group was boys.\nWe joined together with another orphanage home which was boys home. They were\noutskirt of Bucharest in a little city, put up. After six weeks of living in Bucharest where\nwe constantly continued to learn, and all the time looked for it that life should be as\nnormal as is possible for us. We were told one day that at last we are going to the port\ncity and we are going to board the ship. I can\u2019t tell you how joyful it was for us. We were\nlooking forward of living. Not knowing where we would be going, and how good it will\nbe or how bad it will be. Difficult, or what is waiting for us.\nI: Did you have some imaginings of what Israel would be like?\nS: Very little, except the uncle who lived in Jerusalem and during the war when we were\nstill living in Onod, he would write to us and he would describe the mountains of\n44",

Or they would be telling us stories about the\nprophets who used to walk in the streets of Jerusalem. Or the temple that was in existence\nonce upon a time and there is a remaining wall. So a little bit of a taste or a little bit of an\nunderstanding we had. However, I wouldn\u2019t say that we were very knowledgeable about\nwhat life is there. Nevertheless we had understanding that the Jewish people who were\npresent at that time in Palestine, which is called today Israel, that they were seeking the\nBritains to leave the country and that there is conflict there. Because I don\u2019t think that at\nthat point we wanted to go to anywhere where life would be a conflict again or war again,\nor hostility again. What we wanted was to be just in nature and to see positive things. To\nsee peacefulness among people, and love. Mainly really what we were seeking for was\nthat the people love each other. Because a lot of us lost that faith that people can still\nlove. That people care for each other. Except the united-ness of our people here and there\nduring or after the holocaust.",

Somehow just to go and renew life in a different\nplace, it was connected with a lot of hope. We were hoping that we are going to establish\na new type of life. We are on the boat and water is coming in to the ship, we are\nfrightened we are going to sink.

        "to go back to Europe anymore. Whatever is waiting for us, just not back to Europe. So we\nwere begging. Each one of us had the opportunity to speak in the loudspeaker and beg to\nthe Britons, we are refugees who lost everybody. We suffered so much. We have nobody.\nWe want to come to this country, we want to start a new life, please let us in. So this went\non for three four hours, the yelling, \u2018yes\u2019 \u2018no\u2019. Are you having a lot of mens? Are they\nmilitary people? Do you bring any kind of ammunition. They were frightened that the\nJewish people would be strong and they are going to oust the Britons from Palestine.\nAfter four hours about, or maybe it was a little bit longer, they agreed that they let us into\nPalestine. The boat came to the port of Haifa. Just from the deck to see the beautiful\nmountains of Carmel, which is a huge mountain in Haifa, was very moving, very\nemotional. The nature. It was springtime it was end of May. It\u2019s beautiful in Israel, all the\nflowers are blooming already. As we came down from the boat our people, they were\ngreeting us and they were throwing to us all kinds of bags of goodies. The singing and the\nhugging. Some people found some relatives, some friends. But the Britons did not allow\nus to go out to the city. We were put in a camp, which was not a concentration camp, it\u2019s\nnamed Atlit. It was surrounded with gates and fence. It was a fenced in camp with army\nbarracks. It was a very emotional kind of arrival to Israel which represents in our eye the\nfreedom. That\u2019s what we are dreaming that now we are going to be free from soldiers and\nfrom being observed all the time, and here we are again enclosed in a closed camp\nsituation.\nI: So what did that feel like?\nS: It brought anger. It brought anger because we felt that the world still did not learn from\nthe experience and from the tragedy. We felt that we are people who actually all of us\nneeded to be pampered, needed to be loved, needed so to say, in a resort place and given\nall what we could be given and here we are in a situation where we are closed in, we have\nno contact with the outside world again.\nI: So again you hoped, and again you had been disappointed.\nS: In a way, yes. Still, it\u2019s not to compare. Because we knew that eventually they are\ngoing to fight for our freedom. They, the people who organized this trip. It\u2019s called the\nYouth Aliyah, the Youth \u2018going up to Israel\u2019. Lovely movement who wanted to save the\nchildren from remaining in Europe with the memories. They felt that that\u2019s the right thing\nto do for them.\n46",

        "I: So you had confidence they would be able to do this for them?\nS: Yes we had confidence. Still, we could move in the premises, we couldn\u2019t leave the\ncamp. It\u2019s not to compare to the camps in Germany. We were given food. Some people\nhad visitors. We slowly contacted our uncle in Jerusalem who sent is son in law and he\nsent goodies for us and he brought us my very first silk scarf. I got from my uncle who\nsent it through the camp to us. He wanted that we should feel human, we should feel as\ngirls should feel that you beautify a little yourself so he sent a scarf for me and for my\nsister. I by nature cherish every little new thing. I don\u2019t have to have big things. Every\nlittle new thing I can be happy. In those days for sure that scarf meant so much. I was\ntrying to put it around neck and my head and around my face. All kind of different things.\nI: What color was it?\nS: It was a blue with white and pink. I remember because I had one nice dress and it\nmatched. The dress was blue. So we were in that situation but not too long because then\nfrom the Jewish agency, which has branches in America too, and it\u2019s subsidized I think\nthe money from here as well from Palestine. They came in and they demanded from the\nBritish that young children should be let out. After three weeks being in that camp we\nwere let out. They gave us some ticket for a bus that would take us to Jerusalem. Because\nthey asked \u201cwhere is your destination, where do you want to go?\u201d My uncle who lived in\nJerusalem, he corresponded with my uncle in Budapest. Prior to my trip in Palestine the\ntwo of them made a decision, since we had no parents, that we should be attending a\ncertain kind of religious school in Jerusalem. That school happened to have a dormitory.\nIn that dormitory were the refugees, the survivors, the orphans. It was a kind of\norphanage dormitory, still you didn\u2019t feel like you were in a real orphanage home. It was\nmore like a school dormitory.\nI: How did you feel about that decision?\nS: Well, in a way I felt that it was somebody that was making the decision I didn\u2019t have\nto break my head where to head and what to do. Later on, I wished that they wouldn\u2019t\nmake that decision for me. Perhaps I would have chosen a different school. This was a\nlittle bit more religious than I. It was a little bit too pious, you know what I mean. It was a\nlittle bit too strict kind of a school. I wanted to go to a lesser. It\u2019s like you go to a regular\npublic school, or you go to the church school. This was more like a church school. Very\nrestricted, orders. Very restricted how, code of dressing and code of behavior.\n47",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "I: What kinds of behavior and dress?\nS: Very little freedom in the evening, you could not leave the premises. You had to be\nhome a certain time. In school you had to go with long sleeves and long skirts.\nI: Were there any boys in the school?\nS: No, only girls.\nI: You had to be very covered.\nS: Very much so, yes. So I wouldn\u2019t have mind a little bit less strict kind of situation.\nI: Was there more religious training? More services?\nS: Yes, more than I was exposed at home. Though I am coming from a rabbinical family.\nBut this was a little bit more to the right. But the learning was on a high level. So I can\u2019t\ncomplain. Because educationally I got what I wanted. I wanted very much to further my\neducation. In the beginning we had difficulty with the language.\nI: You and Esther.\nS: Yes me and Esther.\nI: And the language was Hebrew.\nS: Yes\nI: Were the other girls in the school survivors, or some of them not survivors?\nS: The majority of the students were local. Who lived, who were born and raised in\nIsrael. In that time it was called Palestine. The refugees were trained by private teachers\nin order that they can cope with the material that the rest of the group was learning. They\nsubsidized our learning sessions by taking us out some time from the regular class then\nprivately teaching us. However, in many things such as science or math or geography, we\nwere ahead of the Israelis. Apparently the education in Europe was on a high level in\n48",

        "certain areas and the religious education was much behind. So we needed mainly in\nlanguage and religious studies such as the bible or the prophets, we needed a lot of help at\nthe beginning. Or Jewish history. But in many other subjects we were much ahead of the\nlocal people.\nI: You had told me in an earlier interview that your father had arranged Hebrew lessons\nfor you and your sister and brother. Did that include spoken Hebrew\u2019?\nS: That included spoken Hebrew but that was so little. It was really.. We knew certain\nexpressions, you know. But we were not able to converse in Hebrew.\nI: So not only did you have trouble with the classes because of spoken Hebrew, but was it\nhard for you to make friends also because of the language?\nS: It was in a way maybe, but it wasn\u2019t really because the girls were very outgoing. I\nremember being invited to several of my friends who were very outgoing to help us and\nto try to make us feel good and being in homes sometimes. Not only to be in the\ndormitory. We were invited to their homes.\nI: Were they day students or boarder students?\nS: They were day students. Only the refugees were the ones who lived in the dormitories.\nOnly the orphans. It wasn\u2019t easy at the beginning. Certain subjects took us a long long\ntime to be able to join in with the rest of the group. But they made us feel good that in\nother subjects we were ahead. Such as math or science. They always used to say \u201cwe\nteach you Hebrew, we teach you prophets, and you teach us other things\u201d.\nI: Did you have much contact with your family at that point, with your uncle?\nS: With my uncle we were most of the time on the Shabbat, on the holiday, visiting here\nor there for a meal. We never slept over by my uncle. For different reasons. The boarding\nschool didn\u2019t like the idea that we are not back in the evenings. Also, they lived in a very\npoor condition. Housing was very difficult in those days in Israel. My uncle who had\nthree children lived in a two bedroom apartment. It would mean that we would be living\nor sleeping in the living room, which we didn\u2019t want to cause such a commotion in the\nhouse. But we went usually for a meal here and there.

They had certain quotas. I remember that in this\ncountry also you have quotas, how many people can come from Hungary, how many\nrefugees can come from other country. Now lot of times we hear other stories. When I\ncame to this country I also came on a quota. So my uncle went from Frankfurt amein to\nPalestine in 1939 right after Kristal Nacht. They were also not too long in the country. A\nfew years. But they established a nice kind of a life. It was very refreshing to talk with\nmy uncle. He would tell us beautiful stories about our parents. He reminded us those days\nwe came to visit.\nI: So you had known him before.\nS: Yes. We had known him. Both of them very outstanding people, I remember that one\nday my uncle took me and my sister to a store in Jerusalem and he bought a pocketbook\nfor us. There were more important things maybe, but he wanted so much to give us the\nfeeling that we are girls.

Yet for him it was very important to\ngive as many things as we could in order to make us feel that yes we live a normal life,\nand we are human beings, and we are just like all the other girls after the war. We walked\nwith that pocketbook so proud. I wish to see today teenagers would cherish something\nthat we get as we cherished those pocketbooks. For years, I think only a couple years ago\nI gave it away. I kept that pocketbook even though I was not using it because I couldn\u2019t\ndepart from it. Because it was so meaningful, so special. That was the very first, the scarf\nthat he sent to the camp.

And low and behold it was a very\nmeaningful experience and I want her to come for a meal to visit me also.\nI: Had you wished that someone would do that for you when you first arrived in Israel?\nS: Very much so.\nI: So giving her the pocketbook was really very meaningful for you.\nS: Very much so.

I remember one thing that I wanted to tell, when we\nwere let out from the camp, we were just given money to take the bus to Jerusalem. There\nwas no straight bus from the camp situated next to Haifa to go to Jerusalem. We had to\nstop over in Tel Aviv. As we are standing waiting for the connecting bus a lady\napproaches us, she heard me talking to Esther in Hungarian, she approaches us and she\u2019s\nsaying \u201cwho are you?\u201d We told her our story, we are children of the rabbi of Onod.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d \u201cWe are going to Jerusalem\u2019.

However she ran and she bought\nfor us some cake and she bought for us some candy and chocolate and she pushed into\nour pocket a very small amount of money but that was the very first money that we had in\nour pocket. She hugged us and she said \u201cgod bless you, thank god I see some young\npeople who survived the concentration camps\u201d. A million times I wanted to find out who\nthis lady was? What was she doing at the bus stop? She wasn\u2019t traveling. Later on when I\ntold, many times when I repeated this story because I was very moved by it, that\nsomebody specially found for her task to go to stations of bus or ships or wherever,\nmaybe maybe she will find some survivors and she would be able to give them a few\nthings to cheer them up. Once I told this story to a cousin of mine and she said, \u201cyou\nknow who this was? this lady was a sister in law of my sister who died after the war in\nBudapest.\u201d She didn\u2019t know that we are related, I mean it\u2019s not real relation there 1s\ncontact whatever. Many times I learned from this, not many times, but I learned from this\nI also like to go places where I know there is a need to cheer up people, if its an old age\nhome or an orphanage home because I always feel I remember. It was little, it was small,\nbut it was very much on time. That little bit of package that she had given to us and the\nfew pennies that she put in our pocket. So I hope that I will be able for many years to\ncheer up people and continue to do what I learned from that one experience.",
        "Back to Jerusalem. I had difficulties learning in the beginning but slowly it got\neach time better thanks to lots of the girls who came and learned with us and invited to\ntheir houses, it was not only the learning session but being invited into normal homes and\nseeing that there are families. That not everything had been wiped away during the\nholocaust, gave us a lot of strength. A good meal here and there sometimes because it\nwas a very poor time in Israel.

But I saw that life was going on and families were together and\nthey built homes. They were working and they were learning. It was a normal kind of a\nlife. Unfortunately I had to go through again a war in Israel in 1947. The independence\nwar of Israel. Then the British were ousted and the Arabs attacked us. I have been visiting\na friend of mine in Jerusalem and as I was returning back on the road to the orphanage\nhome, I see that somehow the street is empty. That was very unusual for a Saturday\nafternoon. People used to stroll in the street, that\u2019s the day of rest. I hear boom boom\nboom, and I don\u2019t see nobody. So I ran to a ditch in the road and I was just hiding myself\nthere knowing this kind of things from the experience in the holocaust. Then I hear from\none window somebody screaming \u201ccome in! come in!\u201d So I went into the house and they\ntook me down to the basement which was a semi-kind of a shelter. They told me that I\ncan\u2019t continue to go. \u201cYou can\u2019t go back to your orphanage place, the dormitory because\nthe Arabs attacked us\u201d.

There was no way to get\nout from the city to come back. And yet, I don\u2019t know, with all that suffering I never gave\nup. And it wasn\u2019t so depressing, because you were together with many people. You saw\nfamilies. It wasn\u2019t that we had to be surrounded. It wasn\u2019t that we had to be hearing the\ngas chamber or smelling the smoke of the gas. Here we were fighting for our own\nindependence. It was a very different kind of a feeling. It wasn\u2019t easy. It was not pleasant.\nBut not to compare.",

Food was very poor. The main problem in Jerusalem\nwas water. They used to give out a bucket of water per family. That\u2019s how difficult it\nwas.

        "S: We had no classes because we were attacked and they were afraid to have children in\nthe street. In those days children were walking to school. Even on the bus it was not safe.\nBut after a while they reopened back the school. I left Jerusalem during the siege with an\narmor car. They took down some children to Tel Aviv because they felt that it was very\ndangerous to be in Jerusalem. Esther, my sister, by that time was working in Tel Aviv. So\nI went there.\nI: So she was not in school.\nS: She wasn\u2019t in the school with me. She was only for one year and she learned to sew.\nShe went to a vocational school. I went to regular gymnasium.\nI: So Esther did not go to the same school in Jerusalem that you did.\nS: No. Not to the same school.\nI: But she was in Jerusalem.\nS: She was in the same dormitory. They established for girls who were unable to do\nspiritual kind of things or scholastic kind of things. Who were more broken from the war.\nEsther was, even though she was much brighter, for her learning is very easy, I had to\nwork on my studies all the time all my life. Still she just couldn\u2019t go back to the books.\nThey found that it\u2019s the best thing for certain girls to be busy with their hands instead of\nbeing busy with their minds.\nI: So you were separated from Esther again.\nS: I was separated from Esther. The first time separated after. Because after the camp she\nwas in a sanatorium but I was not really separated because we were both in Budapest.\nHere we were also not separated, we lived together in the dormitory. Then we were\nseparated because once she learned her profession, sewing, she got a job and she went to\nTel Aviv.

        "was the first time that you were separated. How did you take that, being separated from\nEsther, even though you knew that it was important for her to be doing what she was\ndoing?\nS: In a way it was very difficult because I had nobody except her. Being the older sister\nwho all the time felt a certain kind of responsibility and being a substitute mother in a\nway, as much she could. But by that time, perhaps due to my friends that were very very\ncareful and very giving and very supporting, it was a little bit easier to take that\nseparation. We were in constant touch with each other. But then when Jerusalem was\nsurrounded I could not leave and she could not come to visit. That was a little bit\ndifficult, because the fear was there. There was hope but there was a fear too, who knows\nhow long will be this separation and when will I be able to see her again. She was the one\nwho initiated that I should be leaving Jerusalem. It wasn\u2019t easy because you could not as\na civilian leave the city. Soldiers were going in secret ways and they organized that once\nin a while to unite sisters or unite families they would take each time a few people. So\nhappened that she made this arrangement with a convoy of soldiers I went from\nJerusalem. Which was kind of a dangerous trip to do, from Tel Aviv. She made\narrangement in Tel Aviv for me that I could continue in the same kind of school setting\nthat I had been attending in Jerusalem and also in an orphanage home. There were\norphanage homes established by the Jewish agency in different cities all over in Israel. So\nI went back to school. I continued my learning. Esther was visiting me on a daily basis.\nShe was learning a little bit of money so she bought a blouse for me or some extra little\nfood. Eventually after being in that orphanage home for about a year, we rented a little\nroom with a privilege of using a little bit a kitchen. We joined together again and lived on\nour own. This was about 1948.\nI: So you were 16.\nS: Yes. I continued to go to school and Esther continued to go to her work. We lived by a\nfamily who rented out one little room and we were able to use one little burner in our\nroom. Make once in a while food or a little bit of soup. It was an interesting kind of\nsituation because we felt that we are again independent. That one little room, even though\nit was a rented room. But we felt that we are no more orphans. That we are like living a\nnormal life like other people are living. We were very friendly with the people who\nrented us the place out. They were very nice to us, very intelligent people who helped me\na lot with my learning also. Then we made friends, neighbors.

I wanted some other foreign language to learn because I always\nwanted to be a teacher and I knew that eventually need more languages to know.\nI: Did you assume that you would live in Israel for the rest of your life?\nS: At that time I assumed that I would be in Israel and I am going to establish a family\nlife eventually. It is very interesting to note that he was teaching me and he was always\nlooking my handwriting. This is the brother of the music teacher who were the neighbors\nof where we had been living.

I didn\u2019t notice that\nactually he is teaching because he is in love with me not because he really was interested\nto teach me.\nI: Why did you think he wasn\u2019t charging you?\nS: I thought that so many people wanted to help, all the refugees in many different ways.\nSome who could help financially, some who could help educating them.

So here was the opportunity but that had to stop after I learned\nthat there are other alternative motivations than just giving us the extra lessons.\nI: So after you figured out what was going on you stopped the lessons?\nS: I stopped the lessons. I stopped the lessons.\nI: Was that hard for you to do?\nS: It was because I wanted very much to further in any way, in every way, my education.\nBut I was involved in the school and eventually I learned a little bit music from other\nsources.

It was an apartment of three rooms and in each room\none couple was living and the kitchen we divided and three women were sharing that\nkitchen.

I was\nmainly in charge of cleaning and ironing. I was not so much interested in cooking. I was\nmore into books in those days.\nI: How was it after you got married in those days?\nS: After I got married it was difficult. I remember that once I tried to make a cake\nbecause my husband said that it would be nice on the day of Shabbat to have a cup of\ncoffee with a piece of homemade cake. Bakeries were not in existence. It was too\nexpensive if it was here and there a bakery. Who could afford? I attempted to make a\ncaked. It was a yeast cake and it wouldn\u2019t rise. So what should I do? It\u2019s already\nafternoon and it\u2019s nothing moving, it\u2019s soon the holiday coming, the Shabbat, I am not\nable to bake anymore. So I took that dough and I put it in the garbage can, and one thing I\nforgot was that I should have been wrapping it or hiding it more, that was the task of my\nhusband that he came home that he helped me to take down the garbage from the\napartment and into the dumpster to put it.

But slowly, I don\u2019t know, very little. I\nam not a big cook today either. I am admiring how my daughter is cooking, she 1s a really\ngourmet cooking. I do simple things. The taste I think came back, remembering from the\nhome. I remember how it tasted, a good potato soup. I remember the dill that mother was\nusing, or the petrosil. Or seeing her doing things. Eventually, certain things come back to\nyou. And from experience. As my husband says I experimented on him. He had to be the\none to eat certain foods that was not so good. But thank god, he survived. Forty seven\nyears we will be married in April. So apparently something went good.\nI: So back to your schooling. You were in school when you were married.\nS: I was in school after I got married. I was in school for a very long time, and at the very\nearly age I was still in school and married. I went to teach in outskirt in Tel Aviv. At that\ntime the head of the country of Israel was Ben Gurion, which is a known name. He asked\nall the students who went to teach a seminar, to volunteer and go out to teach because the\ninflux of the immigration was so high and Israel was not ready and prepared with enough\nteachers. So it was counted to a certain degree as credit towards our learning. We went\nout to teach in remote places, outskirt, my job was in a slum area of Tel Aviv, my first\njob. I had forty two students in the class. Not being an experienced teacher was not really\nan easy task. I was teaching first grade. Reading. I remember, I counted that at least thirty\ndifferent countries were the children from and many different languages. But I still\ncherish that year. Because it was not only teaching those children, but helping them to\nadjust to a new life again. Later on I was teaching, mainly that they came from Morocco.\nI remember, I wasn\u2019t yet married when I was already helping out in that special\nobservation center to teach children and I used to take home to bathe children. I was not\nonly teaching, but I was teaching the parents because they came from Morocco from\ncaves that they lived in and they had very little knowledge to maintain hygiene life at\nhome. I used to take home children for the weekend, that they should have a little bit\nbetter food, better home. A matter of fact I got sick from one of the children, they had a\nlot of problems with eye infections. Trachoma. And I developed from this one little\ngorgeous beautiful child a bathed her, I put her next to me in bed, I didn\u2019t have extra bed\nanyway, and she was sleeping with me.

Or walking with us near to the bank of the river. He\nwould always tell us stories. So I used those stories and calmed the children. And they all\ntook to me during the trip of the few days. At that time I somehow, it went through my\nmind that maybe one day that would be my profession. Even though my parents\nencouraged that I go into medicine. But maybe that would be better for me. So when I\ncame back from the war, I started. I always have been tutoring younger children or\nhelping the ones who needed in certain areas. It came to me very naturally.\nI: So teaching has always been an important part of your life, and you go back to the time\nyou were in the cattle car with the children. You\u2019ve been teaching for most of your life I\ngather.\nS: That\u2019s very right. I have been teaching for most of my life, and I hope to continue for\nmany years. What I like, that I want to give to my students, not only knowledge, but\nstrength, and hope and stamina, just to teach them. That they should always cherish the\npositive and not to dwell on the negative. I think that comes from my experience as a\nholocaust survivor. And to tell them the story on their own level.\nI: Well I think you have lots more to tell us. I think we will conclude this interview with\nyou and then pick up on another day with more of your story. Thank you very much, Mrs.\nMunk for giving your testimony today.\nS: You are very welcome and I look forward to being with you again and tell as much I\ncan for the future generation to know.\nI: This concludes the Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Yaffa Munk.\n65",
