        "Q: Would you state your name and birth date please?",
        "A: My name Klaus Meier, and I was born on March 29 in 1932. I was born in Switzerland, near\nthe city of Zurich, where my parents lived in a kind of a community, socialist, agnostic,\nsemi-religious, because they felt that the only way people can live together in peace and\nharmony is by each one giving what he can and receiving only what he needs for life. My\nfather will tell his own story. My mother has passed away already, but he was seeking for a\nlong time to find this justice between people. As I said, I was born in a little farm there which\nthey had rented. And while they were living in community there, they got to...1nto contact\nwith another community which started in Germany 1920. I want to give a brief history of this\ncommunity because it's important. Everett Arnold, a son of a missionary in Africa, sent there\nby the Arnold family from North America had also had this great longing in his heart to find\nwhat the way of Jesus 1s, the way of justice, peace and love, which the prophets and the\nTennah speak all about all the time. And after much searching and seeking, (clearing throat)\npassing through the first World War, he felt that what is told in Acts 2 and 4, that they were\none heart and one soul should be lived and practiced to meet this need for justice and love\nand peace. He started in Germany 1920, and he was always on the look, this man Everett\nArnold and his wife, on the look out for other people who had similar longings. So he got\ninto contact with my parents on the little community in Switzerland near Zurich. My father\n(clearing throat) was ...uh...he rejected...he took part in the military in Switzerland, but\nrejected it. He couldn't see killing people as being just and so he lost his...all his possibility\nfor higher paid work. And on this farm they were milking cows, working in a cooperative\nand so on. The community in Germany called Bruderhof heard about his stand of non-\nviolence, his refusal of military service, his going to prison for this in Switzerland, and\nEverett visited my father in prison and later on had contact always tried to encourage him not\nto give up community. The problem was that in a socialist agnostic community like my\nparents were in...as my father says, there's always as many ideas as there are idealists, and\nunless you find unity in community it will break apart. The tensions are too great. So in this\nSwiss community, they didn't find unity. The question of education, how to spend the\nmoney, how to work, what to...what part to take politically, all these questions divided the\nmembers. Whereas in the Bruderhof, the community in Germany, there was a unity which\nwas possible. You could feel it, but it was Christian and my father couldn't stand Christianity\nas preached by the big world churches, the Catholics and the Protestants. Well, when I was\n10 months old, my parents...this community in Switzerland didn't dissolve exactly, but one\ncouple after the other went..uh...because they were disappointed with the life of that\ncommunity and joined the Bruderhof in Germany. And my parents joined that community in\n1933, in February, a month after Hitler came to power. Right from the beginning...now this\nis what my parents tell me. Right from the beginning, Everett Arnold said to the whole\ncommunity, to the members, \"Hitler has come to power. Now we have to decide will we\nreject that nationalistic spirit? Are we willing to give our lives for what we believe or not?\nAnd on this question, some left. My parents stayed. On...I...] had three other brothers born to\nmy family in Germany. Andreas Meier, my second brother; Hansjurk Meier, and Daniel\nMeier. I do not remember any kind of persecution in Germany itself, but I remember fear.\nJust fear. And when I talked to my parents later about this whole question, they told me that\nalready in 1933, there was six policeman who searched the community. Later on, in 1933,\nthere was a referendum in Germany about whether....Hitler wanted to know if the German\npeople support his policies. The members of the Bruderhof put little slips on the...on the\nvoting papers, on the referendum papers, saying, \"We respect the government, but we have a\nleader who is Jesus and we will not...we will serve only him.\u201d When the...5 days after this\nreferendum which was in November I believe...uh...there was a big group of Nazi of\nGestapo...Nazi soldiers and policemen came and raided the community. They took away\nbooks with red covers, proving that we were communists. They took away minutes of our\nmeetings and...uh...so this went on. My father then was sent to take important documents to\nSwitzerland out of the reach of the Nazis. My father was then sent with another Swiss man to\nthe Gestapo headquarters in Berlin to find out what they had in mind with us. Everett Arnold\nalways felt we have to go to top men to find out, and not to the second, third or fourth\nechelon in the power structure. In Berlin, my father went to the headquarters and they got in\nthere which was also a fearful thing I think, and the man there told them that he had enough\nreason to dissolve the Bruderhof right because in one of our meetings, Everett had said that\nthe Nazi state shows the character of all states, but it showed it clearest of being from the\nbeast of the ___, which according to CHristian beliefs in the book of Revelation is the\nopposite of God's love. The beast of the ___ is the opposite of God...of God. So this Nazi\nman said, \"Just for having said that, we must dissolve you because you are against\neverything which the Nazi government represents.\u201d Then...so I heard this from my father,\nand then I know that in 1934, the Nazis sent a school inspector into our private school which\nthey had asked the children to sing the national anthem which they couldn't. We had not\ntaught that. And they said, \"We will close your school or send German teachers.\u201d This we\ncould not tolerate, so we took our children to Germany. My father was instrumental in this.\nIn Switzerland, our school children were rejected. They did not get permission to enter\nSwitzerland. The Swiss government said, \"Be obedient to your government. Why take your\nchildren out?\" So they did not understand us. And for this...",
        "Q: You recall...what part do you recall as how it affected you?",
        "A: I was then...uh...2, 3 years old. I was not in this school children who left who were in\nBruderhof. I stayed on the _Bruderhof with my parents being Swiss and in some way\nprotected from the...from the Nazis, from the German officials. But I remember then for\nmyself as the death of my fourth...third brother, Daniel Meier. He was born in __ on March\n29, 1937. And I remember my father taking me to my mother in the Fulda hospital to see this\nlittle baby. And the 14 days after he was born, came the raid which... where the\nGestapo...uh...confiscated and destroyed the community as such. They occu...they came in\nthe early morning. I remember that. They surrounded the whole community and they told\neverybody to get into the dining room. Leave the rooms, the kitchen, the laundry. Just leave\neverything and be in the dining room. I don't remember getting and ask questions or so but I\nremember the picture and the fear which...which I had. And the governments...the...the Nazis\nsaid, \"Leave right away.\u201d But there was my mother 14 year old baby...and the weather was\nbad. There was some sick people. So we asked them to let us go when the weather is a bit\nbetter and we...so they let us stay there | day longer. And then I remember how with a bundle\non the shoulder, we all got...they took us into buses and they took us to a train...I believe in\nFulda. I'm not ...I'm not quite clear to which city. I think it was Fulda. And on the train, then\nthey took us to the Dutch boundary and pushed us over the border. I've often wondered why\nmy father went to the...to prison in Fulda for various reasons, the Nazis can't close the\ncommunity as because they figured we were enemies of the state. But when they found out\nthere were two Hutterian brothers and I have to explain this, present from North America,\nthey changed the accusation into criminal bankruptcy to have a legal handle to get rid of us.\nNow I remember these two brothers. And they are descendants of ...uh...people that in the\n60th Century in Austria, Switzerland, Moravia, which is today Czechoslovakia, began a life\nin community like we live it today. And they were persecuted by the Catholics to death. By\nthe Catholics, the Protestants, the churches and the governments. They found refuge in\nMoravia because hundred years before this,___, there was a spiritual awaking and\nthere was more tolerance in Czechoslovakia than in the rest of the Austrian empires. And we\nHutterians were persecuted. I think more than two thousand were burned, killed, decapitated\nor drowned, whatever they did, and they fled from Moravia into Hungary, then later on to\nRussia. They lost the community life on two occasions, and it started again. On hundred\nyears ago, in 1874, they migrated to the United States because the Russian who had\npromised them exemption of military service, wanted to force them to do military service.\nBut they refused and migrated. Now, two of these...excuse me, I have to go back now.\nEverett Arnold and the Bruderhof in Germany, when they heard in 1928 about that there\nwere...that none of the Hutterian brothers had done military service in the world war; that\nthey had been persecuted economically and with hate and in the United States for not being\nanti-German in the first world war, many of them were taken prisoners and two of them were\ntaken to Alcatraz and later on to Fort Levinsworth, and they died from exposure because of\nthe treatment they got from the American military. After they had died, there were...they put\nthe uniforms on and sent the bodies home. They refused to put the uniform on while they\nlived. This we heard in Germany, published in the Mennonite newspaper. And Everett and\nthe Bruderhof felt here is a group that unanimously stick to their principles, even unto death.\nThis is something we have to know. So Everett himself went in 1930 to the Hutterian\ncommunities in South Dakota, North Dakota, and I believe some over in Canada; visited\nthem all and united with them, 1930. He came back in at the end of 30, I think, or at\nbeginning of 31. Hitler came to power in 33. And in 1937, two of these American and\nCanadian brothers were visiting the community in Germany just the time when the\nNazis...uh...confiscated the whole lot. When...the Gestapo searched everything, they met up\nwith these two and they pulled out their American passports and said, \"Sorry, we don't allow\nthis. You cannot search us. We are American citizens.\u201d And there the Gestapo got afraid\nabout propaganda in...1n America and changed the accusation from, as I said, enemy of the\nstate to criminal bankruptcy which my father can tell how that worked. So we left then\nGermany in 1937 and I...I thought a lot about why...why is it that all of us escaped without a\nsingle one dying in the concentration camp or in prison? And I don't really know the answer\nexcept that I believe God protected us. But I know from our side we did not compromise at\nany point with the Nazis. We did not raise an arm in salute. We did not go along with his\npolitics. We didn't try to...uh... sort of inch our way in and be friends. We all...not I. I was a\nchild. But the brothers and sisters and always said clearly where they stood.",
        "Q: How...how did it affect you at this point?",
        "A: As I said, I was 5 years old. I was just afraid. That's all I know, and from...from Germany. At\ncertain times, I was afraid. And other times, I was a child growing up in this community very\nmuch cared and loved for.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of what was going on in the community to your community that\ncaused this fear in you?",
        "A: Uh...I...I'm told that also before 37, there were different raids going on. And my father was\naway often for the community in Switzerland finding refuge for the children. Later on in 35,\nwhen the general conscription started, he was off trying to help people. His absence I feel I\nmust have felt that as a child. This 1s...this is what I can say. But apart from...from this fear\nI'm talking about, I had a very protected childhood. It was in...within the community, it was\nprotected.",
        "Q: How did the community protect you?",
        "A: I...bY the...I think it was by the...by the love and the confidence that God would led this...see\nthis thing through.",
        "Q: How did your community live at this point?",
        "A: Our community lived on a farm. I'm not quite sure how many acres. They were farming.\nThey were learning to farm because in the beginning 1920, they were all city people,\nprofessors and intellectuals, but they were determined to ...to agriculture, and the farming\nwas difficult. The land was hard and they had a lot of work needed to establish a farm. We\nlived in community houses like the kibbutz do today. We had our own school and preschool\nand kindergarten. Children were educated in their age groups by members of the community.\nSo the influence from the outside was very low or nothing.",
        "Q: Was the community self sufficient?",
        "A: It was self sufficient up to a point. We took...the community took in any kind of\nwayfarer...overnight gave him food and lodging. Asking them to work, which they did\nmostly rejected. We had many visitors, and economically we were doing bad. Not\nbecause...so much because of inexperience, but right from 1933 on, the Nazi government\ntried to strangle us economically. How this exactly worked, I'm not sure, but I heard that at\none point they...they forbid...they didn't give us the license to sell our products. We farmed.\nWe had wood tannery, and we printed books. And the sale of books and tannery was part of\nthe cash income, where as the farm was the food. We...we never sold food. We always just\ngrew food for our own use. And when the...when police...uh...prohibited us from selling then\nthis took away cash and that made it difficult. There was a time in Germany when we had\nfriends outside Germany who gave us money, which was stuck in Germany. I forget what\nthe term is. They didn't allow foreign...foreign currency to get out of Germany, so friends\ngave us that money and the banks in Germany would not give us the money. So they made\nour life more and more diffuclt. We took in children from broken homes and needy\nsituations, which the German government of the Weimer republic had paid for. They gave a\ncertain amount of money. Well, this was stopped. And so here we were with the children and\nnot getting an help either. So this is what made the economic situation very difficult and\nmore and more so. They forbid guests of staying overnight which we didn't listen to. We\ndidn't accept that. And...uh... (clearing throat) so now I think I got to the point that we came\nto Holland, and my personal story.",
        "Q: How old were you?",
        "A: I was then 5 years. And I remember one of the Hutterian brothers carrying my little brother\nof 2 weeks....of 2 weeks of age in his arms, and my mother...we all had a bundle on our back\nand left. I'm very thankful that we could leave. Many, many others could not leave or did not\nleave in time. In Holland, the group called the Mennonites took us in very warmly. The\nMennonites are a group that also started in the 16th Century and belonged to the so-called\nanti-baptist movement, and they started in Switzerland if I remember correctly, but fled to\nHolland whereas the Hutterians went to Moravia and Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: How many of you did they take in in Holland?",
        "A: I think we were about 50 people. Let me say something. In 1933, we were about 120, but\nwhen the children had to be... had to leave Germany, we started a new community in\nLichenstein. And members of the German community had to move over to Lichenstein to\nsupport this group of children. So that was also a weakening of the economic situation, to\nhold...to maintain two communities is much more difficult than one. So when the Nazis\nconfiscated the place, I think we were about 50 people...children and grownups. Some when\nto the Lichenstein community called __ Bruderhof, and the others went to England where\nwe had already started a community because of the tense political situation in Germany. The\nyoung men who received military service in Germany escaped illegally across the boundary\nand went to Lichenstein. And in Lichenstein the government was very friendly to us, and\ngave us refuge. And when Hitler started to put his fingers out for these resisters in\nLichenstein, they let us know about it, and they said, \"Get out of here fast. Hitler is asking\nabout...not Hitler personally, but the German government.\u201d So when this happened we\nneeded to find a place somewhere else to go to. And this place we found in German...in\nEngland. So as we left Germany in 1937, there was already a community in England. We\ntried to get into England, but couldn't because they wanted an affidavit of support, the British\ngovernment. So the Mennonites took us in for 2 months, and they...we slept in their church\nbuildings, in their homes. They gave us toys. They made collection amongst themselves for\ntoys, for blankets, for food. Everything they...they simply supported us for 2 months. I\nremember very well we never had any roller scooters 1f...1f that's what you call two wheels\non a board and a handle. In Germany, we...we didn't have enough money for such things, but\nin Holland, there were nice, black topped paths and roads and we got these roller scooters\nwith rubber tires. Not wooden, but rubber, and we scouted around. That was wonderful. Now\n(clearing throat) I'm told that I wrote a letter from Holland to my father who was in prison\nwith the Nazis in Fulda, and in that letter I did...I didn't write, I dictated this to my mother\nsaying, \"If the government...German government doesn't let my father free, I'm going to\ncome with the whole...and knock the prison down.\u201d My father received this letter in prison\nand everybody laughed about it. And then I remember when we traveled to England, we\ncrossed the channel on a boat. And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children, mostly\nchildren and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from England came over to help us. And\none of them was called Adolph Brown. He was a very hugh man, 6 feet or more, and quite\na...quite heavyset, and he took...he took care of me and my brother because my father wasn't\nthere. And I remember crossing the Channel on a boat. Then we came to England. And in\nEngland, we had started this community called the ______ Bruderhof, near _.. I'm not\nquite sure geographically where it's situated. And this community was also a agricultural\ncommunity, and we started farming right away. We built houses and in England then all, the\nwhole community gathered. From Lichenstein, Germany 150 people about altogether. There\nwas an increasing war fever because Hitler was doing his thing, and everybody was getting\nready. And so it was a time of decision. And many English people felt that violence is not\nthe answer to human problems, and so in the 4 years we spent in England from 37 to 40...or\n36 to 40, the size of the community doubled with English..uh...men and women, married and\nsingle, old and young, who felt that a life in community without wages, working together,\nserving each other instead of expecting service, was the answer to our human needs. And so\nthe community doubled in this size. We had this one community, ___. We had another\nfarm close by, 5 miles, called Telling farm, and ____ Bruderhof,, the third one. And I\nremember this time quite well. I was 5 to 9...9 years of age. And maybe what could help\nmost for the...for my story now 1s that there was a time when in England when all the\nwindows had to be black outed. I believe that was when the war started. And so we did this.\nWe had built three houses 1n willow trees along the brooks. All these tree houses were taken\ndown because the English people were afraid we would be signaling the German airplanes.\nBeing Germans. They forgot we had escaped. They just saw us as Germans. The...I wasn't\nGerman. I'm Swiss. But they..they made us take all these treehouses down. They took...put\nconcrete pillows in the meadows so we wouldn't let the German airplanes land and they\neven...uh...made ditches so that nothing could... They were very scared of us. And I...I'm\nvery sorry for that because I...I don't understand it. They were so scared of us that this fear\nturned into hatehood, and on one occasion, at least, the surrounding...some of the\nsurrounding population came half drunk, enraged, to burn the community down. The\natmosphere in England was very warlike atmosphere. You either were for the English and\nagainst the Germans or you were an enemy. This kind of thing. The community supported\nitself partly also by having a merry-go-ground, a vegetable ground, bread, butter, eggs. This\nwas finished from one day to the other nearly, because they feared...rumors were going\naround that we were putting poison in the milk to kill English children. So this atmosphere\nalso I felt as a child living in England. We had many air raid practices, living in the 3rd\nfloors of the manor house getting into the bottom. I remember packages of dried banana and\nsome chocolate and nuts in case we were stuck down there. And I remember also that...uh...a\nGerman bomb dropped very close or on our property while we were in England. This all\nmade an atmosphere of fear, which I also felt. But within the community I...I felt safe. It...1t\nwasn't a personal feeling. It was a general...a feeling of...of...uh..of war. Now, I also\nremember that while we were in England, we were approached by a Zionist group and asked\nif we could train some Jewish people in the _____, preparation for kibbutz life. And I think\n40 or 50 came and spent some time with us, learning to work in agriculture. And when I\nwent to Israel now in 1985, I came to kibbutz Hasara, with my father and some others, and\nwe met some of these who have been in our community 40 years ago, which was very\ninteresting.",
        "Q: Do you know where these people came from?",
        "A: Where they came from? No. But I think...no, I don't. And from Europe, from Germany,\nAustria, probably I think. Then the community also took in Jewish orphan children from\nAustria, from Vienna. We had friends who asked if we could help and we...I'm not sure of\nthe number. I hear about maybe 12 children. And one of them, Lotta Berger, who came\nVienna who had lost her parents....they were killed...came to us and she is still with us today.\nShe married. She became a member and she married under the family, a very good friend of\nmine. And (clearing throat) so we lived there in England. And then in 1940, and in 1939,\nbecause of the antagonism of the surrounding people...the government was friendly to us, but\nthe people were very afraid of anything German. So the government hinted to us it might be\nbetter to leave the country because if the tension grew, they would have to intern us for our\nown sake. Another thing which happened to us in England was because of this war fever\nwhich could be compared to what happened in North America with the Japanese and the\nWest Coast after Pearl Harbor, this kind of psychosis or whatever it is, made it that the...the\npolice said, 'No Bruderhof member could pass the radius of 5 miles outside the community.\u201d\nAnd when somebody did that they, this was illegal. They got us...we could get permission to\nleave further than 5 miles, but we had to get permission every time. This was another thing I\nremember. I remember the German airplanes flying overhead. You could hear by the noise\nof the motors that they were German airplanes. I don't...I cannot explain it. I was told this.\nAnd they...they bombed Coventry, of course and Birmingham and many cities. In our\ncommunity, we always represented that we have to love the enemy. Not only the fellow man,\nbut also the enemy because only love can break the vicious cycle of violence. I kill you. You\nkill me. This kind of thing can only be broken and this is what I understand 1s God's will for\nus actually, that we should love people and leave the revenge to God as is spoken about\nmany times by the prophets especially. So then when the government hinted that it's better\nfor us to leave, my father was sent to North America in 1940 to find out 1f we could come to\nNorth America or Canada, because we are brothers over here. And in Canada they wouldn't\nlet us in. They had enough trouble with those COs, conscientious objectors living in Canada.\nOur brothers in South Dakota offered us a whole farm, ready with housing, machinery and\neverything. So my father went to the...came to New York, came to Washington, lived in the\nstudent union down here in Washington for 3 months and from there traveled with another\nbrother to Canada, South Dakota, trying to find the help that we could immigrate to the\nUnited States. The government was very much in favor. My father breakfasted with Eleanor\nRoosevelt. She was in favor of us coming, but she said her husband needs to make the\ndecision. There was different Senators who tried to help us, but there was a _ election\ncampaign of President Roosevelt, and we were advised it's not good to come at this point.\nWait til January or February after the inauguration. As I think about this, the question comes\nwhy? Well, we all have clothing like I have it now. Black clothing, beards, which in those\ndays were very rare. We don't salute the flag. I don't salute the flag. I have respect for the\ngovernment, but I can't pledge allegiance for instance. It goes against my conscience. And so\nall these things made the government aware that 1t might not be a good moment to come in.\nAnd then my father went to the Mexican government to see if he could go there. It didn't\nwork out. And then the Mennonites again helped us to find a place in Paraguay, South\nAmerica, which is in the heart of South America. We didn't know where this place was. We\nlooked it up on the map. Now, my father was in America. I was still in England in the\ncommunity. And when we heard we could travel to South America, Paraguay, we started\nreading books about the place because we'd never even heard of it. And we read about\nsnakes and jungles and monkeys and...uh...diseases, all kind of things. And then the British\ngovernment made possible for us to sell everything, get the value of it, and they made it\npossible for us to take everything we needed out of the country. And I and my family\nwith...together with, I think, 70 of the community, we were on the first group. We left\nEngland in 1940 I think. 39 or 40, I'm not quite sure. We went...traveled in buses to Burn, to\nLiverpool, spent the night there in a hotel which I remember from...went to the third floor.\nThere was big beds and everything, but there was always the danger of bombers, of course,\nin the night so we had to be ready to...to run down the stairs and into the shelters. Nothing\nhappened that night, and I remember getting on to this ship called _____, which the\nBritish government used to bring meat in from Argentina specially. And they had one class,\nwhich was first class, and then it was a freight ship actually. So 80 of us got on this ship and\nthen everything was black out. And I remember the ship sailing or steaming or whatever you\ncall it...criss-crossed their way sub...uh...submarine attacks. This was at the height of the\nsubmarine war when the Germans more or less controlled the ocean around England. So\nit...that was also dangerous, and we were aware of this. I was 9 years, and I remember how\non this ship then, I once had...I had a flashlight and I took it out in the gun ware and shone it,\nand everybody came and really hushed me up because that was a dangerous thing to do. I\nwasn't aware of what I was doing, but there was great fear of anything like that. We had a\nvery nice time on the ship. I enjoyed it very much. They gave us very good food in the first\nclass, and there was a big library and films and everything. I was aware of the situation but\nnot to the depth of it. As a child...I was a 9 year old, I enjoyed it also very much. We crossed\nthe Equator and came to Rio de Janeiro, the first city we saw in full lights at night. It was a\nwonderful sight. Then we went to Buenos Aires, transferred from the oceanliner to a river\nboat, and there I saw my father again. He had gone through Brazil and Paraguay and looked\nat different possibilities and met us in Argentina, but you couldn't come on the ship because\nwe were only...they'd only...uh...pass us through...cross Argentina. We...we couldn't...this\nwas under police escort and we were put on a bus with all the luggage and police escorted us\nfrom the oceanliner to the river boat, so that nobody could run away and get into Argentina.\nSo we traveled up this river, Paraguay Parana, 4, 5 days at least. Third class. It got hotter and\nhotter and hotter and hotter. We ended up in Ascunion, Paraguay, I think at Christmas time,\nwhich is south of the equator; therefore, it's the hottest time of the year. And then we\ntransferred to another boat and went up the Paraguay River another 4 or 5 days til we came\nto ____, which 1s very close to northern...to Brazil in the northern part of Paraguay. There\nwe got...uh...unto to a train without bump...without cushion bumpers without...it was a\nfreight train. We couldn't drink water. It all had to be coffee. So I was trying...I was\nremember the part of Paraguay Ascunion. The...the food on the living conditions on this boat\nwas very bad. We were on the bottom of the boat. I think there were three or four tiers of\nbeds, or bunks, and I remember now, there are no lights on this river. The Captain has to\nsteer the boat by the seat of his pants, as one says. The river rises and falls and the sand\nbanks come and go. It's wild. And the boat gets...the boats gets stuck sometimes on sand\nbanks and ...uh...so we were the only one that traveled in the bottom of the boat. The next\ngroups and there were maybe 10 more, they traveled first class or second class for safety's\nsake. So we got up to this Chaco station...uh... __, and there we took the train 144 to\nkilometer 144. Now you can imagine. There were young babies, mothers, expecting mothers,\nfathers, everything...old people, young people, on this train traveling 144 kilometers into the\nbush. Another name for the Chaco is Green Hell. And I can't confirm it is...1t is Hell. Many\nsand storms; hardly any water; very hot, and very inhos...inhospitable; poisonous snakes.\nYou name it. Tarantulas, diseases. All this is there. And kilometer 144 we had to wait. We\nwere heading toward Mennonite colonies, and if you remember I said that in Holland,\nMennonites had helped us. When our immigration to the United States was not possible,\nagain, Mennonites helped us find this place in Paraguay and they alerted their members there\nto...we are coming and so kilometer 144, we waited. It got dust. Some horses wagons were\nsupposed to arrive to fetch us. They didn't come. They didn't come. But in the end they came.\nI think there must have been 20 wagons. Horse wagons from 2 horses to a wagon with\nwooden wheels, metal rimmed. We put our baggage on and everybody got on and we started\noff. It was so dusty you choked and could hardly see anything. We drove...we went through\nthe night and stopped for a couple of hours. Around midnight, scared of snakes, but\nno...nobody got bit. And the next day, we arrived at this colony in the Gran Chaco of\nParaguay called Sanheim, where Mennonites who had fled from Russia and who had come\nfrom Canada I think to avoid public education by the government. They wanted their own\nschools. They'd come to this place in the Chaco in 19...1n the 20s, so by 1940, they were\nquite well established. But they told us about many difficult hardships which they\nexperienced there. Now, when we got there, they had prepared a banquet for us in their\nchurch. Long tables, white table cloths, coffee with milk and sugar, home baked bread with\nbutter, and home made cheese, and I can still taste it to this day if I think of it. It was so\ngood. The families slept in the school houses which the Mennonites had. It was holidays\nand...uh...I remember we stayed about 2 months. And while we were staying there,\nthe...the...my father and others looked around for a suitable place where the community\ncould settle, where we could start building houses and live a community life again. And they\ntraveled around. This I hear. I...I didn't do it myself. They traveled around. It was very\ndifficult to find any place, because wherever you go, you needed water. And the water in that\nChaco part is all brackish water, very hard, but bitter and to find a sweet water well was a\nrare thing. The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months, we heard that\nthe whole Chaco is a military area under the...under the government of the military\ninstitution, which we also didn't like too much. Now, I remember as a child...oh, yeah. When\nwe were there, my...let me think. I have three brothers...four brothers live in Germany, and in\nEngland a sister was born in my family, Verena, and then another sister, Hannabeth, and the\nthird sister was born in the Chaco right there in the Mennonites...there with the Mennonites.\nThey had a hospital there. Our communities had brought 3 doctors who had joined the\ncommunity in England, and they came out with us and this doctor was there, and helped my\nmother in...in the time of delivering. Other children were born there. So I would like to say\nthat in this whole process of fleeing for conscious sake, there were quite a few things to\nconsider. Pregnant mothers, little babies. These things. I remember meeting Indians in the\nChaco. They were so-called wild Indians with loin cloth and...uh...the feathers they had in\ntheir hair, but they were all very friendly. And as I was told, these Indians also had a type of\ncommunity life. They...1f somebody got something, they brought it to the oldest woman in\nthe tribe, and she would then distribute to each one as you needed. They cared for each other\nand helped each other. And for this reason, we felt quite close to them. My father tells me\nthat he met some of the...of the leaders of the ___, of the Indian tribe, and they gave us\nsome land. And my father asked him, \"How much do we pay?\" And the Indian said, \"One\ndollar.\u201d And then the brothers asked shall we sign a document, the Indian said, \"No. Shake\nhands on this. That's enough. We feel...we feel something from you which doesn't require\nany legal documents.\u201d In the end, we decided not to stay in the Chaco. It was too difficult.\nThe agriculture __ was too bad. It was too hot, and then this military question played also\ninto it. So then the brothers went to what is called East...east Paraguay, __ Paraguay, and\nthere along side some other Mennonite colonies, we found a big...not an estate, a\nbig...uh...cattle ranch. I think four thousand acres or something like that, maybe more. And\nthe man wanted to sell us and we bought part of this. And we called it...it was called Priwara,\nwhich means Spring. So when this became clear, we all got on a truck and they drove us out\non the truck to the train station. We got back to kilometer 144, drove to Kasaro, got on a\nboat, and went down 2 days I think...2 days and a night, to a place called Protorosario, which\nmeans Rosario Port, and there again Mennonites fetched us with their horse wagons. We\ndrove 60 kilometers inland to this new place which we had acquired. There were no\nbuildings on this place. It was nothing. It was just wild woods...uh...plains, swamp, and while\nthe members of the...the men of the community start to build houses, we children stayed with\nthe Mennonites in their schools, in their homes...I think again for at least | or 2 months. And\nthen finally we could all move up to the Primiwara, and start our community life again. As I\nthink about the whole thing, from the sake of conscious, my parents started from scrap just\nabout every 10 years. In Switzerland were scrapped and they went to Germany, they started\nfrom with nothing, with the Bruderhof, and the left that, went to England. So and that is a\ndifficult thing, to start with nothing, everything 10 years is quite something. Now in\nPrimawara, we started building houses. Uh...In that country, there is a lot of timber, so we\nhad to get timber. You cut the trees yourself. You can't buy it. You cut the trees 1n the forest.\nYou bring them out what they call__, which 1s a contraption consisting of two\nenormous wheels 6 feet high, big wheels with an axle, pulled by 12 oxens and the log maybe\n30, 50 60 feet long is balanced under this axle and the oxen pull it out of the wood and then\nyou cut it up by hand. You can imagine this was all a lot of work for everybody. We built\nfour big halls, a roof, no walls, no interior walls, and with just curtains separating the\ndifferent families and there we stayed until we could build better housing. We started right\naway with agriculture, which 1s basically all we knew. We start with tannery, wooden\ntannery. In Paraguay, there's some wonderful woods, exotic woods, which make beautiful\nvases, sugar bowls, candle holders, things like that which people buy. So we went into\ntannery and agriculture. We started our own school there, and I remember that there were 3\nwoods. It's hot in Paraguay. It's sub-tropical country, and...uh...summer it goes up to 100,\nvery humid. Every day a thunderstorm, and winter it goes down to 32 degrees, 33 fahrenheit.\nThere was a little bit of ice, no snow, but cold because we were not used...having hot\nweather all the time...to this cold weather. So in this place called Priawara, there were three\nwood islands. The first one...the first one we cleared and built a dining room, communal\nkitchen and a store house. And the second little wood which was maybe 100, maybe 200\nyards away, was the preschool and the kindergarten (clearing throat) and in the third one we\ncleared...and I remember with machetes we cleared the cactus on the brush, and then\nwe...there we built some school houses, school rooms, where all the children were educated.\nWe had our own teachers which we always wanted. We...we feel that in this community life,\nwe want to have certain values. Values of love, peace, justice, and we...(clearing throat) we\nknow that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a school to\nbe...uh....wholeheartedly going 1n one direction. So this we had our own school with our own\nteachers. It was difficult, but other people died so simply by being able to live, it was a\ngreat...a great thing already. In Paraguay we stayed til 1960. I lived there for 20 years. I also\nlived part of my life in Uruguay, and also a country in South America, Montediveo.\n(Clearing throat) While we were in Paraguay, there were some revolutions. There're always\nrevolutions somewhere going on. And we were on the...on the battle line...uh...different\nparties winning and losing. They always asked us to help them supply wagons with horses to\ncarry the ammunition and the soldiers. We always refused this. If a soldier's hungry, we give\nhim food. If he's hurt, we'll help him, but we will not take part in furthering military\nobjectives in any way. And this was dangerous. My father, again, was...he had to meet these\nofficers and they threatened to kill him more than once by not...by refusing to help. But I feel\nthat by holding on to values which one has, it's the best thing we can do. If one starts\ncompromising, it gets...one gets on slippery ground very fast.",
        "Q: What was the government's reaction...",
        "A: The Paraguayan government was...is a Catholic government complete. The whole country is\nCatholic. They took us in because they needed people on the...on the land working\nagriculture. Paraguay is a country which lost...I don't know exact the figures, but they had a\nbig war with Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil, and they lost enormous amount of people there,\nespecially men and boys. So they needed people to come to the country. Not business people\nin the cities, but on the country. And therefore the Paraguayan government gave us religious\nfreedom. We were not Catholics. They gave us complete authority in our villages. No\npoliceman had any business there. They gave us freedom of school...of teaching children\nhow we wanted, and they freed us from military service...uh...for generations. And this...this\nwas...this made us very happy that this was possible. So the government was very friendly in\nthat way. And we worked hard. We started an industry of...uh...wood saw...sawing logs, and\nthis tannery and printing from...We worked together with a speaker, an organization from the\nUnited States, which helps third world countries improve cattle...uh...corn, soybeans.\nDifferent things like that. They came to us, and we had some very good agronomists\namongst members, and so they had a station on our land where they experimented to\nimprove peanuts, corn, soybeans, and so on. So we worked with them, and that also helped\nus, of course. In the beginning, the cow...we needed milk for the children. The cows were all\nwild cows. They gave half a cup of milk if you were lucky. So we needed to improve the\ndairy, and this took year but it got improved eventually. For us children, it was actually a\nnice time. We never suffered hunger. We...we didn't get to eat meat, but we had bread. We\nhad beans. This is fine. One doesn't need to live in big luxury to feed comfortable. We had\nthe school there. We were cared for. There was a lot of sickness at first. Eye\ndiseases....uh...tropical sores, hookworm, malaria. All these things happened.\nBut...uh...standing together and helping each other and supporting each other made it\npossible to get over this time. Now, the...the school was all in...in English I think. I'm not\nquite sure. In Germany, we spoke only German. In England we switched over from German\nand English. In Paraguay, it was German and English and then English I think and Spanish,\nso I grow up in three languages. That's why...that's why my spelling to this day is a little\nwobbly as Pooh Bear would say. So we had this school there, and we had 9 years of school\nto the 9th grade, and then I was asked with another boy...another boy from the community, to\ngo to public school, to go to high school but you had to need, you need Spanish for this. So\nhe and I went to Ascuncion, the capitol, where some other people were studying to be\nteachers. Uh...Mainly teachers actually we needed. We went there to what's called the\nKindergrotto, 5th grade, which is the...the last year of the primary school. In Paraguay,\nthey...I think they use a French system. Six years primary education, six years high school,\nand then six or seven years university. That's how the system works. So we were quite\nold,...uh...but we had to do this last year's primary education, kindergrotto. We didn't know\nany Spanish hardly, and we had...we had a heck of a time. (Laughing) Even in the State-run\nschools, they hardly had any...any...uh...notebooks. No textbooks, so the teacher dictated. I\nremember writing everything down as fast I could. They speak very fast, and then I went\nhome. He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the community who was\nstudying to be a teacher. He tried to decipher what we had written down so we could learn it\nlater. And I stayed in this community in the...the Bruderhof house as we call it for quite a\nnumber of years trying to get this education. This Bruderhof served a number of functions. In\nParaguay you can't just.. uh...order something and UPS brings it. It doesn't work like that. It\ndoesn't work like that, so all the buying and selling went on in the capitol and then you had\nto organize transport from the capitol to the colony. And especially in the beginning years,\nwe had to buy sugar, the soap, the wheat. Everything had to be bought in the capitol and then\ntransported to the colony.",
        "Q: Okay. They're changing tapes.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: So this house which we had in..uh...1n Ascunion, the capitol, was a building which we rented\nand later bought. And this study was the young people studying, mainly to be teachers or\ngoing to secondary school, high school and maybe could be compared to high school. We\nalso had some people there. We had a...store, where we sold tanned goods from the...from\nthe community in the country. And we sold quite of these tanned things out of wood. Mainly\ntourists, Americans who came through brought these. We also made there orange juice,\nconcentrated orange juice and sold it there. And this capitol also, all the business was\ntransacted. As I said, sugar, flour, soap, matches, all the things we didn't make ourselves.\nCloth. All the things we didn't make ourselves had to be bought somehow and then\ntransported up to this colony which we had. To get from Ascunion to the colony took about 2\ndays...a day, a night and a day. One night traveling with a little river boat, maybe...yeah..to\n_____ and then a day's travel with a horse wagon from the port to the colony...to the\ncommunity. While being in..1n Ascunion, I remember a time of revolution which happened\nevery now and then and there was wild shooting. They have...uh...metal telephone on power\npoles, sheet metal and you could...they were like sieves sometimes at the end of these\nrevolutions. You know the bullets going right through them. This all made me...made one\nremember the times of Germany, England, so this kind of thing went on. We...I stayed in\nAscunion, together with the other people for the whole school year, because things started in\nJanuary and ended maybe in October and then for the summer holidays I went back to my\nfamily in the community in the country. Another important thing that...that happened to us\nwas since we had three doctors on the pharmacists and the helper on the pharmacy who\ncame with us to Primaware, this community in Paraguay, when the...when the surrounding\nneighbors found out that we had three doctors, they came flocking because there was not a\ndoctor in a hundred miles circumference. They had no where to go with their disease and\nthere's plenty of tropical diseases there. Leprosy, ___, hookworms. I tell you it was terrible.\nSo these people all came for help. We...we did what we could, but also lacked help. So very\nearly in the game, then we sent people to North America, brothers and sisters to go to visit\nbig pharmacological places here in the States and beg for medical equipment, medication,\nmoney, whatever to start to help these people down there. And bit by bit we built a hospital. I\nthink at the highest point it had maybe 30 or 40 beds. The doctors did all kinds of operations.\nUh...People came when the children were born, hookworm treatment...uh...Saturday night\nbrawls. All this kind of thing came to the hospital, and we did what we could. We asked\npayment insofar as the people could...could pay, but I don't think we ever insisted. We didn't\ngo to court to demand payment. That we never did. Some people paid with eggs or a pig or a\ncow, but we have to realize that in Paraguay the people living in the country are very poor.\nThey don't have any money. They have very few things. And so we just helped basically. We\njust helped. But food...sending people to the United States...the people coming here found\nother people interested in a different way of life where the rat race is cut out. You know\nrunning after money, spending it, having to spend it. Day and night keeping going ...and this\nkind of frenzy some people didn't want anymore. And they were looking for a different way\nof life altogether. So when we sent people up there, they met some who were interested and\nthey came to visit us in Paraguay which is very important because we were very isolated in\nthe country, and we never wanted to live for ourselves, for our own edification, for our own\nsalvation. That is not our purpose. Our purpose is to show everybody that people can live in\npeace and justice and harmony together. That this 1s possible right now. And we are.... am\nnot better than anybody else. I've got the same inclinations, temptations in my heart, but the\nquestion is where do I call it... where do I say stop? And living in community, having this\ngoal of love to each other...a true love which admonishes which helps. This kind of love is\nwhat actually every human being longs for. And so we did never wanted to live for\nourselves. We wanted...we hoped that we can be a witness to other people that the life and\nbrotherhood is possible. To Catholics, to Protestants, to Jews, to Moslems, to Agnostics, to\nAtheists, it doesn't matter. To bums to rich men. And so when these people came from North\nAmerica, they asked many questions. Why you do this? Why you this? And this is good for\nus. We need to see what we're doing also through other people eyes and...and see if we are\nstill true to what we want to do. And so this was good. In 1954, I think, well we had people\nthen in the States traveling all the time, meeting with interested people. There was an\nintentional community movement in the United States in the 50s, and so we visited these\npeople and some wanted to join and some said, \"You're too far away in Paraguay. Why don't\nyou start a community up here?\" So in 1954, we started a community in New York State\nnear...between Kingston and Poughkeepsie. There's a little town called Roseton, near\nNewport, and there we bought some land and some houses and started Hutterian Bruderhof\nwhere people could come and see if they were ready to join or if they wanted it all, and so\nthis was very good. (Clearing throat) Now back to Paraguay. I went to school and then I\nwent to University. I was training to become a doctor, a medical physician. And as I said,\nthere were different revolutions going on so when I was in first, second year in medicine,\nthere was a big upheaval in the university and South American altogether and also in\nParaguay. The students are active social movement. They...the young people protest\ninjustice, the political oppression. And so the students were always in a... in a revolt, you\nknow, in a stir, in a commotion, asking for justice. But one day the police came and closed\nthe university down because the government didn't like this social upheaval. They called it\ncommunists. And...uh...so the closed the university down and the Brother decided that I\nshould go to Montediveo in Uruguay to continue with the studies. And so I went down there\nand finished up later on. And it was in Uruguay, the little community called there called\nEldorado, about 10 miles out of Montediveo, where the...where we started another little\ncommunity. It started just with a few people working in a dairy farm and then we felt it's\nbetter not to be employed, but really start a community so we did that. We bought, I think,\nmaybe 20, 30 acres with some housing on it. We sent families down there. Because we\nwanted to be near..near a place where people...where we could talk to people and meet\npeople. We didn't want to live for ourselves. And also in Ascunion, we didn't find enough\nplaces for the young people to be educated in different things, and so this community in\nElarado, near Montediveo, Uruguay was supposed to be another center for young people to\ngo to and train. Maybe I should say at this point that in our community we, the children born\ninto the community are not members. There's no automatic birthright membership. The\nyoung people they are born there. They grow up and we try to give them as good education\nas we can which varies. In Paraguay it was very limited. Here in the States, we're very\ngrateful for the education into high school which is free of charge. But this wasn't so in\nParaguay, so...so these children as they grow up, they...they get educated. They get to know\nwhat this community life is all about, but then we're very interested to let them experience\nhow other people live so they can come to a decision seeing both sides of the picture, so to\nsay, and come to a personal decision. If you want to join in the Bruderhof, it cannot be\nfor..for the parents\u2019 sake. It cannot be for brothers and sisters. It can't be for a good life which\nwe now have. We have a good life now. It can't be for any kind of...uh...comfort. It can only\nbe for the sake to show the people can live together. And we found that 1f we do what Jesus\nsaid, it happens. Now, I want to go back to the time in Germany. When my father and I and a\ngroup of others visited Israel in 1985, we knew that the question of the Holocaust wold come\nup and there our Jewish friends asked, \"What do you think of the Holocaust?\" And my\nfather answered after a moment of silence...I was there. I heard it. He said, \"The Holocaust is\na judgment on the Christians. Because (clearing throat) all the Germans who did the killing\nwere nominal Christians. Catholics and Protestants. And I know that Jesus did not say kill\nyour enemy. He didn't even say kill the handicapped. He didn't say kill the imbecile, the\nmentally handicapped. He said love your fellowman which is told in the Tennah by God\nhimself. So this...this love is what we need, and so therefore we said in Israel and kibbutz\nHasara in 85, \"It is a judgment on the Christians because they did not do what they said they\nwere.\u201d (Clearing throat) And then my father went on to say, \"But if we Christians and you\nJews don't take a lesson, don't learn from this Holocaust experience, the Holocaust will come\nthat takes all of us.\u201d And I think the present day world situation is just about that.",
        "Q: Have you been back to Germany?",
        "A: Yes. I went back in 88 once. We had gone again to Israel, invited by the kibbutz movement\nto visit them. We stayed there 3 weeks and then back to Germany. And I remember going to\nthe train station there and I had all these memories coming back from 1937. (Crying) So I\nremember that. We have a little...I hope it doesn't matter if I skip around a bit. So this was\nthe answer my father gave about the Holocaust. Now for the last few...since | year we have\nstarted a community in Germany again in Bernba, near Frankfort, in the ___. And we went\nto this...we went to this village and we bought a property which used to belong to the\nCatholic CHurch. It was a children's home. It was very well suited to community life. It had\nplans for three or four more big buildings, community-type buildings. And so we bought this\nproperty and then a resistance developed from the inhabitants of this small village of Bernba,\n400 people maybe, which was so...uh...strong against us coming and against us extending\nthat a Lutheran...Angelical minister in Bernba said publicly in a church, \"Have we forgotten\nwhat happened 50 years ago? That we are so antagonistic and hateful to people who are not\nfit into our system?\" She was referring to 1937...uh...to the whole Nazi time where\nforeigners, Jews...uh...second class citizens were simply hated and exterminated. She...she\nsaid, \"Is...are we there again? Have we not learned?\" There was a real confrontation there\nand we..we don't know what to do. We invite the neighbors to come and see and talk. We\nsing together, but there 1s a real little circle there that wants to get us out of Bernba. This\ncaused an uproar in the newspapers. Television companies came and made, you know,\ntelevisions and...uh...programs which were broadcast all over Germany. So we think again\nthis attack on us in the end served something good. People hear about the brotherly way of\nlife.",
        "Q: Is the community still in existence?",
        "A: Yes. In Germany, we are still holding on. We don't know how to go, but we're still holding\non. We have no permission to build. We have no...we can't do a thing because the village\nauthority hasn't given permission yet. But we hope it will mellow. We heard that the place\nwe bought in Bernba was a real Nazi center for Nazi, you know, so maybe their spirit 1s still\nthere. Personally, I don't think that the Nazi spirit or this hate spirit can be eliminated by\nkilling the people who represent it. I heard that Cohan was killed...murdered yesterday or\ntwo days ago. And he was...he was very right wing and...and hateful to other people, but I\ndon't think killing him kills the spirit he was serving. And this 1s...this 1s what we think all\nthe time. And it...on the ____ Bruderhof, I remember that the brotherhood which we called\nthe Committed Members, they wrote letters to Hitler, to Goring, to the Gestapo, to the Nazi\nofficials in Kassel, stating our situation very clearly. We respect the government. We are not\nintending to overcome it with violence, but we can have nothing to do with certain values\nthey uphold. So we want to love the enemy, but without killing him, without hurting him.\nThis is...this is what we aim for. But this 1s a struggle for every person. I...I can be committed\nto a goal, but it still is harder for me to work towards, because I'm just a humanbeing. So\nhere I digressed a little. (Clearing throat) Now, let me think a moment. So we started a\ncommunity in the...1n North America and we...(clearing throat) in 1960, then we decided to\nclose down all the Paraguayan communities and all come up to the States. We went through\na difficult time in our communities which I maybe can explain best by saying our Hutterian\nforefathers from the 16th Century compare a community to a lantern, a glass lantern with a\ncandle in the middle like they used to have. And the community is a lantern, but the\nimportant thing in the lantern is the light in the lantern. The lantern serves only to let the light\nshine out. And this light for us is Jesus as love, justice and unity. That is the light. And we\nlost this light. And...uh..(clearing throat) so the things that destroy community life---self-will,\nselfishness, egotism, huddling, back biting--all these things that destroy community life\ncame in. And in 1960, we went through a time where we (clearing throat) everyone was\nfaced with the question what do I want with my life? Do I want to serve love or do I want to\nserve myself? And on this then (clearing throat) a large number left us. And the rest we came\ntogether in North America here, and then we started the community in Connecticut in\nNorfolk, Connecticut and that's the northwestern corner. And we were...we bought an old\nplace...it is a castle. We don't like castles, but this was a place where a hundred people could\nfind lodging right away. And so we bought this place and 50 acres and in a feel for different\ngroups, we moved up from Paraguay to North America. Because we needed to...together to\nfind the way to work for the values we had set. And as humanbeings, we have goals but we\nalways liable to...to move either to the left or to the right and lose the way, but we are\ndetermined to find it. And so that's why we came together in North America again. While in\nUruguay, I met my future wife, Elana. She was there studying music. She's part...she's a\ndaughter of the family of the community. She came down to study music, and we got\nengaged down there. And we were engaged for 3 years, because it was in this...this whole\ntime that we closed one community after the other and moved up to the States so there was\nno time for a marriage. But when she came up in January 1962...1 came up in November\n1961...(clearing throat) we decided to marry. And when I say we, I mean my wife and I and\nthe whole community because all such actions are take...the decisions are made together.\nAnd so we married in June... 24th of June 1962. (Clearing Throat) We had a...1t was a\nwonderful occasion. Then we had two children in Connecticut and then we were asked to\nmove to our community in Pennsylvania which had also started. Maybe I should say here\nthat (clearing throat) when we decide free willing...when I decide free willingly to become a\nmember of this community, I declare my readiness to serve wherever it's needed. So I can\nwork in the shop making toys for children. I could clean bathrooms. I could work in the\ndining room. Where...wherever I'm needed. I don't want to fulfill my gifts specially. I'm here\nto serve. And so in this sense my family moved to the Pennsylvania community, and I\nworked there in the shop. I worked in the school. And then in 1972, we moved again to the\nConnecticut community 1973 to be with my father, my mother, and the parents of my wife.\nThey were getting older.

        "A: My name Klaus Meier, and I was born on March 29 in 1932. I was born in Switzerland, near\nthe city of Zurich, where my parents lived in a kind of a community, socialist, agnostic,\nsemi-religious, because they felt that the only way people can live together in peace and\nharmony is by each one giving what he can and receiving only what he needs for life. My\nfather will tell his own story. My mother has passed away already, but he was seeking for a\nlong time to find this justice between people. As I said, I was born in a little farm there which\nthey had rented. And while they were living in community there, they got to...1nto contact\nwith another community which started in Germany 1920. I want to give a brief history of this\ncommunity because it's important. Everett Arnold, a son of a missionary in Africa, sent there\nby the Arnold family from North America had also had this great longing in his heart to find\nwhat the way of Jesus 1s, the way of justice, peace and love, which the prophets and the\nTennah speak all about all the time. And after much searching and seeking, (clearing throat)\npassing through the first World War, he felt that what is told in Acts 2 and 4, that they were\none heart and one soul should be lived and practiced to meet this need for justice and love\nand peace. He started in Germany 1920, and he was always on the look, this man Everett\nArnold and his wife, on the look out for other people who had similar longings. So he got\ninto contact with my parents on the little community in Switzerland near Zurich. My father\n(clearing throat) was ...uh...he rejected...he took part in the military in Switzerland, but\nrejected it. He couldn't see killing people as being just and so he lost his...all his possibility\nfor higher paid work. And on this farm they were milking cows, working in a cooperative\nand so on. The community in Germany called Bruderhof heard about his stand of non-\nviolence, his refusal of military service, his going to prison for this in Switzerland, and\nEverett visited my father in prison and later on had contact always tried to encourage him not\nto give up community. The problem was that in a socialist agnostic community like my\nparents were in...as my father says, there's always as many ideas as there are idealists, and\nunless you find unity in community it will break apart. The tensions are too great. So in this\nSwiss community, they didn't find unity. The question of education, how to spend the\nmoney, how to work, what to...what part to take politically, all these questions divided the\nmembers. Whereas in the Bruderhof, the community in Germany, there was a unity which\nwas possible. You could feel it, but it was Christian and my father couldn't stand Christianity\nas preached by the big world churches, the Catholics and the Protestants. Well, when I was\n10 months old, my parents...this community in Switzerland didn't dissolve exactly, but one\ncouple after the other went..uh...because they were disappointed with the life of that\ncommunity and joined the Bruderhof in Germany. And my parents joined that community in\n1933, in February, a month after Hitler came to power. Right from the beginning...now this\nis what my parents tell me. Right from the beginning, Everett Arnold said to the whole\ncommunity, to the members, \"Hitler has come to power. Now we have to decide will we\nreject that nationalistic spirit? Are we willing to give our lives for what we believe or not?\nAnd on this question, some left. My parents stayed. On...I...] had three other brothers born to\nmy family in Germany. Andreas Meier, my second brother; Hansjurk Meier, and Daniel\nMeier. I do not remember any kind of persecution in Germany itself, but I remember fear.\nJust fear. And when I talked to my parents later about this whole question, they told me that\nalready in 1933, there was six policeman who searched the community. Later on, in 1933,\nthere was a referendum in Germany about whether....Hitler wanted to know if the German\npeople support his policies. The members of the Bruderhof put little slips on the...on the\nvoting papers, on the referendum papers, saying, \"We respect the government, but we have a\nleader who is Jesus and we will not...we will serve only him.\u201d When the...5 days after this\nreferendum which was in November I believe...uh...there was a big group of Nazi of\nGestapo...Nazi soldiers and policemen came and raided the community. They took away\nbooks with red covers, proving that we were communists. They took away minutes of our\nmeetings and...uh...so this went on. My father then was sent to take important documents to\nSwitzerland out of the reach of the Nazis. My father was then sent with another Swiss man to\nthe Gestapo headquarters in Berlin to find out what they had in mind with us. Everett Arnold\nalways felt we have to go to top men to find out, and not to the second, third or fourth\nechelon in the power structure. In Berlin, my father went to the headquarters and they got in\nthere which was also a fearful thing I think, and the man there told them that he had enough\nreason to dissolve the Bruderhof right because in one of our meetings, Everett had said that\nthe Nazi state shows the character of all states, but it showed it clearest of being from the\nbeast of the ___, which according to CHristian beliefs in the book of Revelation is the\nopposite of God's love. The beast of the ___ is the opposite of God...of God. So this Nazi\nman said, \"Just for having said that, we must dissolve you because you are against\neverything which the Nazi government represents.\u201d Then...so I heard this from my father,\nand then I know that in 1934, the Nazis sent a school inspector into our private school which\nthey had asked the children to sing the national anthem which they couldn't. We had not\ntaught that. And they said, \"We will close your school or send German teachers.\u201d This we\ncould not tolerate, so we took our children to Germany. My father was instrumental in this.\nIn Switzerland, our school children were rejected. They did not get permission to enter\nSwitzerland. The Swiss government said, \"Be obedient to your government. Why take your\nchildren out?\" So they did not understand us. And for this...",
        "A: I was then...uh...2, 3 years old. I was not in this school children who left who were in\nBruderhof. I stayed on the _Bruderhof with my parents being Swiss and in some way\nprotected from the...from the Nazis, from the German officials. But I remember then for\nmyself as the death of my fourth...third brother, Daniel Meier. He was born in __ on March\n29, 1937. And I remember my father taking me to my mother in the Fulda hospital to see this\nlittle baby. And the 14 days after he was born, came the raid which... where the\nGestapo...uh...confiscated and destroyed the community as such. They occu...they came in\nthe early morning. I remember that. They surrounded the whole community and they told\neverybody to get into the dining room. Leave the rooms, the kitchen, the laundry. Just leave\neverything and be in the dining room. I don't remember getting and ask questions or so but I\nremember the picture and the fear which...which I had. And the governments...the...the Nazis\nsaid, \"Leave right away.\u201d But there was my mother 14 year old baby...and the weather was\nbad. There was some sick people. So we asked them to let us go when the weather is a bit\nbetter and we...so they let us stay there | day longer. And then I remember how with a bundle\non the shoulder, we all got...they took us into buses and they took us to a train...I believe in\nFulda. I'm not ...I'm not quite clear to which city. I think it was Fulda. And on the train, then\nthey took us to the Dutch boundary and pushed us over the border. I've often wondered why\nmy father went to the...to prison in Fulda for various reasons, the Nazis can't close the\ncommunity as because they figured we were enemies of the state. But when they found out\nthere were two Hutterian brothers and I have to explain this, present from North America,\nthey changed the accusation into criminal bankruptcy to have a legal handle to get rid of us.\nNow I remember these two brothers. And they are descendants of ...uh...people that in the\n60th Century in Austria, Switzerland, Moravia, which is today Czechoslovakia, began a life\nin community like we live it today. And they were persecuted by the Catholics to death. By\nthe Catholics, the Protestants, the churches and the governments. They found refuge in\nMoravia because hundred years before this,___, there was a spiritual awaking and\nthere was more tolerance in Czechoslovakia than in the rest of the Austrian empires. And we\nHutterians were persecuted. I think more than two thousand were burned, killed, decapitated\nor drowned, whatever they did, and they fled from Moravia into Hungary, then later on to\nRussia. They lost the community life on two occasions, and it started again. On hundred\nyears ago, in 1874, they migrated to the United States because the Russian who had\npromised them exemption of military service, wanted to force them to do military service.\nBut they refused and migrated. Now, two of these...excuse me, I have to go back now.\nEverett Arnold and the Bruderhof in Germany, when they heard in 1928 about that there\nwere...that none of the Hutterian brothers had done military service in the world war; that\nthey had been persecuted economically and with hate and in the United States for not being\nanti-German in the first world war, many of them were taken prisoners and two of them were\ntaken to Alcatraz and later on to Fort Levinsworth, and they died from exposure because of\nthe treatment they got from the American military. After they had died, there were...they put\nthe uniforms on and sent the bodies home. They refused to put the uniform on while they\nlived. This we heard in Germany, published in the Mennonite newspaper. And Everett and\nthe Bruderhof felt here is a group that unanimously stick to their principles, even unto death.\nThis is something we have to know. So Everett himself went in 1930 to the Hutterian\ncommunities in South Dakota, North Dakota, and I believe some over in Canada; visited\nthem all and united with them, 1930. He came back in at the end of 30, I think, or at\nbeginning of 31. Hitler came to power in 33. And in 1937, two of these American and\nCanadian brothers were visiting the community in Germany just the time when the\nNazis...uh...confiscated the whole lot. When...the Gestapo searched everything, they met up\nwith these two and they pulled out their American passports and said, \"Sorry, we don't allow\nthis. You cannot search us. We are American citizens.\u201d And there the Gestapo got afraid\nabout propaganda in...1n America and changed the accusation from, as I said, enemy of the\nstate to criminal bankruptcy which my father can tell how that worked. So we left then\nGermany in 1937 and I...I thought a lot about why...why is it that all of us escaped without a\nsingle one dying in the concentration camp or in prison? And I don't really know the answer\nexcept that I believe God protected us. But I know from our side we did not compromise at\nany point with the Nazis. We did not raise an arm in salute. We did not go along with his\npolitics. We didn't try to...uh... sort of inch our way in and be friends. We all...not I. I was a\nchild. But the brothers and sisters and always said clearly where they stood.",
        "A: As I said, I was 5 years old. I was just afraid. That's all I know, and from...from Germany. At\ncertain times, I was afraid. And other times, I was a child growing up in this community very\nmuch cared and loved for.",
        "A: Uh...I...I'm told that also before 37, there were different raids going on. And my father was\naway often for the community in Switzerland finding refuge for the children. Later on in 35,\nwhen the general conscription started, he was off trying to help people. His absence I feel I\nmust have felt that as a child. This 1s...this is what I can say. But apart from...from this fear\nI'm talking about, I had a very protected childhood. It was in...within the community, it was\nprotected.",
        "A: I...bY the...I think it was by the...by the love and the confidence that God would led this...see\nthis thing through.",
        "A: Our community lived on a farm. I'm not quite sure how many acres. They were farming.\nThey were learning to farm because in the beginning 1920, they were all city people,\nprofessors and intellectuals, but they were determined to ...to agriculture, and the farming\nwas difficult. The land was hard and they had a lot of work needed to establish a farm. We\nlived in community houses like the kibbutz do today. We had our own school and preschool\nand kindergarten. Children were educated in their age groups by members of the community.\nSo the influence from the outside was very low or nothing.",
        "A: It was self sufficient up to a point. We took...the community took in any kind of\nwayfarer...overnight gave him food and lodging. Asking them to work, which they did\nmostly rejected. We had many visitors, and economically we were doing bad. Not\nbecause...so much because of inexperience, but right from 1933 on, the Nazi government\ntried to strangle us economically. How this exactly worked, I'm not sure, but I heard that at\none point they...they forbid...they didn't give us the license to sell our products. We farmed.\nWe had wood tannery, and we printed books. And the sale of books and tannery was part of\nthe cash income, where as the farm was the food. We...we never sold food. We always just\ngrew food for our own use. And when the...when police...uh...prohibited us from selling then\nthis took away cash and that made it difficult. There was a time in Germany when we had\nfriends outside Germany who gave us money, which was stuck in Germany. I forget what\nthe term is. They didn't allow foreign...foreign currency to get out of Germany, so friends\ngave us that money and the banks in Germany would not give us the money. So they made\nour life more and more diffuclt. We took in children from broken homes and needy\nsituations, which the German government of the Weimer republic had paid for. They gave a\ncertain amount of money. Well, this was stopped. And so here we were with the children and\nnot getting an help either. So this is what made the economic situation very difficult and\nmore and more so. They forbid guests of staying overnight which we didn't listen to. We\ndidn't accept that. And...uh... (clearing throat) so now I think I got to the point that we came\nto Holland, and my personal story.",
        "A: I was then 5 years. And I remember one of the Hutterian brothers carrying my little brother\nof 2 weeks....of 2 weeks of age in his arms, and my mother...we all had a bundle on our back\nand left. I'm very thankful that we could leave. Many, many others could not leave or did not\nleave in time. In Holland, the group called the Mennonites took us in very warmly. The\nMennonites are a group that also started in the 16th Century and belonged to the so-called\nanti-baptist movement, and they started in Switzerland if I remember correctly, but fled to\nHolland whereas the Hutterians went to Moravia and Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: I think we were about 50 people. Let me say something. In 1933, we were about 120, but\nwhen the children had to be... had to leave Germany, we started a new community in\nLichenstein. And members of the German community had to move over to Lichenstein to\nsupport this group of children. So that was also a weakening of the economic situation, to\nhold...to maintain two communities is much more difficult than one. So when the Nazis\nconfiscated the place, I think we were about 50 people...children and grownups. Some when\nto the Lichenstein community called __ Bruderhof, and the others went to England where\nwe had already started a community because of the tense political situation in Germany. The\nyoung men who received military service in Germany escaped illegally across the boundary\nand went to Lichenstein. And in Lichenstein the government was very friendly to us, and\ngave us refuge. And when Hitler started to put his fingers out for these resisters in\nLichenstein, they let us know about it, and they said, \"Get out of here fast. Hitler is asking\nabout...not Hitler personally, but the German government.\u201d So when this happened we\nneeded to find a place somewhere else to go to. And this place we found in German...in\nEngland. So as we left Germany in 1937, there was already a community in England. We\ntried to get into England, but couldn't because they wanted an affidavit of support, the British\ngovernment. So the Mennonites took us in for 2 months, and they...we slept in their church\nbuildings, in their homes. They gave us toys. They made collection amongst themselves for\ntoys, for blankets, for food. Everything they...they simply supported us for 2 months. I\nremember very well we never had any roller scooters 1f...1f that's what you call two wheels\non a board and a handle. In Germany, we...we didn't have enough money for such things, but\nin Holland, there were nice, black topped paths and roads and we got these roller scooters\nwith rubber tires. Not wooden, but rubber, and we scouted around. That was wonderful. Now\n(clearing throat) I'm told that I wrote a letter from Holland to my father who was in prison\nwith the Nazis in Fulda, and in that letter I did...I didn't write, I dictated this to my mother\nsaying, \"If the government...German government doesn't let my father free, I'm going to\ncome with the whole...and knock the prison down.\u201d My father received this letter in prison\nand everybody laughed about it. And then I remember when we traveled to England, we\ncrossed the channel on a boat. And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children, mostly\nchildren and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from England came over to help us. And\none of them was called Adolph Brown. He was a very hugh man, 6 feet or more, and quite\na...quite heavyset, and he took...he took care of me and my brother because my father wasn't\nthere. And I remember crossing the Channel on a boat. Then we came to England. And in\nEngland, we had started this community called the ______ Bruderhof, near _.. I'm not\nquite sure geographically where it's situated. And this community was also a agricultural\ncommunity, and we started farming right away. We built houses and in England then all, the\nwhole community gathered. From Lichenstein, Germany 150 people about altogether. There\nwas an increasing war fever because Hitler was doing his thing, and everybody was getting\nready. And so it was a time of decision. And many English people felt that violence is not\nthe answer to human problems, and so in the 4 years we spent in England from 37 to 40...or\n36 to 40, the size of the community doubled with English..uh...men and women, married and\nsingle, old and young, who felt that a life in community without wages, working together,\nserving each other instead of expecting service, was the answer to our human needs. And so\nthe community doubled in this size. We had this one community, ___. We had another\nfarm close by, 5 miles, called Telling farm, and ____ Bruderhof,, the third one. And I\nremember this time quite well. I was 5 to 9...9 years of age. And maybe what could help\nmost for the...for my story now 1s that there was a time when in England when all the\nwindows had to be black outed. I believe that was when the war started. And so we did this.\nWe had built three houses 1n willow trees along the brooks. All these tree houses were taken\ndown because the English people were afraid we would be signaling the German airplanes.\nBeing Germans. They forgot we had escaped. They just saw us as Germans. The...I wasn't\nGerman. I'm Swiss. But they..they made us take all these treehouses down. They took...put\nconcrete pillows in the meadows so we wouldn't let the German airplanes land and they\neven...uh...made ditches so that nothing could... They were very scared of us. And I...I'm\nvery sorry for that because I...I don't understand it. They were so scared of us that this fear\nturned into hatehood, and on one occasion, at least, the surrounding...some of the\nsurrounding population came half drunk, enraged, to burn the community down. The\natmosphere in England was very warlike atmosphere. You either were for the English and\nagainst the Germans or you were an enemy. This kind of thing. The community supported\nitself partly also by having a merry-go-ground, a vegetable ground, bread, butter, eggs. This\nwas finished from one day to the other nearly, because they feared...rumors were going\naround that we were putting poison in the milk to kill English children. So this atmosphere\nalso I felt as a child living in England. We had many air raid practices, living in the 3rd\nfloors of the manor house getting into the bottom. I remember packages of dried banana and\nsome chocolate and nuts in case we were stuck down there. And I remember also that...uh...a\nGerman bomb dropped very close or on our property while we were in England. This all\nmade an atmosphere of fear, which I also felt. But within the community I...I felt safe. It...1t\nwasn't a personal feeling. It was a general...a feeling of...of...uh..of war. Now, I also\nremember that while we were in England, we were approached by a Zionist group and asked\nif we could train some Jewish people in the _____, preparation for kibbutz life. And I think\n40 or 50 came and spent some time with us, learning to work in agriculture. And when I\nwent to Israel now in 1985, I came to kibbutz Hasara, with my father and some others, and\nwe met some of these who have been in our community 40 years ago, which was very\ninteresting.",
        "A: Where they came from? No. But I think...no, I don't. And from Europe, from Germany,\nAustria, probably I think. Then the community also took in Jewish orphan children from\nAustria, from Vienna. We had friends who asked if we could help and we...I'm not sure of\nthe number. I hear about maybe 12 children. And one of them, Lotta Berger, who came\nVienna who had lost her parents....they were killed...came to us and she is still with us today.\nShe married. She became a member and she married under the family, a very good friend of\nmine. And (clearing throat) so we lived there in England. And then in 1940, and in 1939,\nbecause of the antagonism of the surrounding people...the government was friendly to us, but\nthe people were very afraid of anything German. So the government hinted to us it might be\nbetter to leave the country because if the tension grew, they would have to intern us for our\nown sake. Another thing which happened to us in England was because of this war fever\nwhich could be compared to what happened in North America with the Japanese and the\nWest Coast after Pearl Harbor, this kind of psychosis or whatever it is, made it that the...the\npolice said, 'No Bruderhof member could pass the radius of 5 miles outside the community.\u201d\nAnd when somebody did that they, this was illegal. They got us...we could get permission to\nleave further than 5 miles, but we had to get permission every time. This was another thing I\nremember. I remember the German airplanes flying overhead. You could hear by the noise\nof the motors that they were German airplanes. I don't...I cannot explain it. I was told this.\nAnd they...they bombed Coventry, of course and Birmingham and many cities. In our\ncommunity, we always represented that we have to love the enemy. Not only the fellow man,\nbut also the enemy because only love can break the vicious cycle of violence. I kill you. You\nkill me. This kind of thing can only be broken and this is what I understand 1s God's will for\nus actually, that we should love people and leave the revenge to God as is spoken about\nmany times by the prophets especially. So then when the government hinted that it's better\nfor us to leave, my father was sent to North America in 1940 to find out 1f we could come to\nNorth America or Canada, because we are brothers over here. And in Canada they wouldn't\nlet us in. They had enough trouble with those COs, conscientious objectors living in Canada.\nOur brothers in South Dakota offered us a whole farm, ready with housing, machinery and\neverything. So my father went to the...came to New York, came to Washington, lived in the\nstudent union down here in Washington for 3 months and from there traveled with another\nbrother to Canada, South Dakota, trying to find the help that we could immigrate to the\nUnited States. The government was very much in favor. My father breakfasted with Eleanor\nRoosevelt. She was in favor of us coming, but she said her husband needs to make the\ndecision. There was different Senators who tried to help us, but there was a _ election\ncampaign of President Roosevelt, and we were advised it's not good to come at this point.\nWait til January or February after the inauguration. As I think about this, the question comes\nwhy? Well, we all have clothing like I have it now. Black clothing, beards, which in those\ndays were very rare. We don't salute the flag. I don't salute the flag. I have respect for the\ngovernment, but I can't pledge allegiance for instance. It goes against my conscience. And so\nall these things made the government aware that 1t might not be a good moment to come in.\nAnd then my father went to the Mexican government to see if he could go there. It didn't\nwork out. And then the Mennonites again helped us to find a place in Paraguay, South\nAmerica, which is in the heart of South America. We didn't know where this place was. We\nlooked it up on the map. Now, my father was in America. I was still in England in the\ncommunity. And when we heard we could travel to South America, Paraguay, we started\nreading books about the place because we'd never even heard of it. And we read about\nsnakes and jungles and monkeys and...uh...diseases, all kind of things. And then the British\ngovernment made possible for us to sell everything, get the value of it, and they made it\npossible for us to take everything we needed out of the country. And I and my family\nwith...together with, I think, 70 of the community, we were on the first group. We left\nEngland in 1940 I think. 39 or 40, I'm not quite sure. We went...traveled in buses to Burn, to\nLiverpool, spent the night there in a hotel which I remember from...went to the third floor.\nThere was big beds and everything, but there was always the danger of bombers, of course,\nin the night so we had to be ready to...to run down the stairs and into the shelters. Nothing\nhappened that night, and I remember getting on to this ship called _____, which the\nBritish government used to bring meat in from Argentina specially. And they had one class,\nwhich was first class, and then it was a freight ship actually. So 80 of us got on this ship and\nthen everything was black out. And I remember the ship sailing or steaming or whatever you\ncall it...criss-crossed their way sub...uh...submarine attacks. This was at the height of the\nsubmarine war when the Germans more or less controlled the ocean around England. So\nit...that was also dangerous, and we were aware of this. I was 9 years, and I remember how\non this ship then, I once had...I had a flashlight and I took it out in the gun ware and shone it,\nand everybody came and really hushed me up because that was a dangerous thing to do. I\nwasn't aware of what I was doing, but there was great fear of anything like that. We had a\nvery nice time on the ship. I enjoyed it very much. They gave us very good food in the first\nclass, and there was a big library and films and everything. I was aware of the situation but\nnot to the depth of it. As a child...I was a 9 year old, I enjoyed it also very much. We crossed\nthe Equator and came to Rio de Janeiro, the first city we saw in full lights at night. It was a\nwonderful sight. Then we went to Buenos Aires, transferred from the oceanliner to a river\nboat, and there I saw my father again. He had gone through Brazil and Paraguay and looked\nat different possibilities and met us in Argentina, but you couldn't come on the ship because\nwe were only...they'd only...uh...pass us through...cross Argentina. We...we couldn't...this\nwas under police escort and we were put on a bus with all the luggage and police escorted us\nfrom the oceanliner to the river boat, so that nobody could run away and get into Argentina.\nSo we traveled up this river, Paraguay Parana, 4, 5 days at least. Third class. It got hotter and\nhotter and hotter and hotter. We ended up in Ascunion, Paraguay, I think at Christmas time,\nwhich is south of the equator; therefore, it's the hottest time of the year. And then we\ntransferred to another boat and went up the Paraguay River another 4 or 5 days til we came\nto ____, which 1s very close to northern...to Brazil in the northern part of Paraguay. There\nwe got...uh...unto to a train without bump...without cushion bumpers without...it was a\nfreight train. We couldn't drink water. It all had to be coffee. So I was trying...I was\nremember the part of Paraguay Ascunion. The...the food on the living conditions on this boat\nwas very bad. We were on the bottom of the boat. I think there were three or four tiers of\nbeds, or bunks, and I remember now, there are no lights on this river. The Captain has to\nsteer the boat by the seat of his pants, as one says. The river rises and falls and the sand\nbanks come and go. It's wild. And the boat gets...the boats gets stuck sometimes on sand\nbanks and ...uh...so we were the only one that traveled in the bottom of the boat. The next\ngroups and there were maybe 10 more, they traveled first class or second class for safety's\nsake. So we got up to this Chaco station...uh... __, and there we took the train 144 to\nkilometer 144. Now you can imagine. There were young babies, mothers, expecting mothers,\nfathers, everything...old people, young people, on this train traveling 144 kilometers into the\nbush. Another name for the Chaco is Green Hell. And I can't confirm it is...1t is Hell. Many\nsand storms; hardly any water; very hot, and very inhos...inhospitable; poisonous snakes.\nYou name it. Tarantulas, diseases. All this is there. And kilometer 144 we had to wait. We\nwere heading toward Mennonite colonies, and if you remember I said that in Holland,\nMennonites had helped us. When our immigration to the United States was not possible,\nagain, Mennonites helped us find this place in Paraguay and they alerted their members there\nto...we are coming and so kilometer 144, we waited. It got dust. Some horses wagons were\nsupposed to arrive to fetch us. They didn't come. They didn't come. But in the end they came.\nI think there must have been 20 wagons. Horse wagons from 2 horses to a wagon with\nwooden wheels, metal rimmed. We put our baggage on and everybody got on and we started\noff. It was so dusty you choked and could hardly see anything. We drove...we went through\nthe night and stopped for a couple of hours. Around midnight, scared of snakes, but\nno...nobody got bit. And the next day, we arrived at this colony in the Gran Chaco of\nParaguay called Sanheim, where Mennonites who had fled from Russia and who had come\nfrom Canada I think to avoid public education by the government. They wanted their own\nschools. They'd come to this place in the Chaco in 19...1n the 20s, so by 1940, they were\nquite well established. But they told us about many difficult hardships which they\nexperienced there. Now, when we got there, they had prepared a banquet for us in their\nchurch. Long tables, white table cloths, coffee with milk and sugar, home baked bread with\nbutter, and home made cheese, and I can still taste it to this day if I think of it. It was so\ngood. The families slept in the school houses which the Mennonites had. It was holidays\nand...uh...I remember we stayed about 2 months. And while we were staying there,\nthe...the...my father and others looked around for a suitable place where the community\ncould settle, where we could start building houses and live a community life again. And they\ntraveled around. This I hear. I...I didn't do it myself. They traveled around. It was very\ndifficult to find any place, because wherever you go, you needed water. And the water in that\nChaco part is all brackish water, very hard, but bitter and to find a sweet water well was a\nrare thing. The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months, we heard that\nthe whole Chaco is a military area under the...under the government of the military\ninstitution, which we also didn't like too much. Now, I remember as a child...oh, yeah. When\nwe were there, my...let me think. I have three brothers...four brothers live in Germany, and in\nEngland a sister was born in my family, Verena, and then another sister, Hannabeth, and the\nthird sister was born in the Chaco right there in the Mennonites...there with the Mennonites.\nThey had a hospital there. Our communities had brought 3 doctors who had joined the\ncommunity in England, and they came out with us and this doctor was there, and helped my\nmother in...in the time of delivering. Other children were born there. So I would like to say\nthat in this whole process of fleeing for conscious sake, there were quite a few things to\nconsider. Pregnant mothers, little babies. These things. I remember meeting Indians in the\nChaco. They were so-called wild Indians with loin cloth and...uh...the feathers they had in\ntheir hair, but they were all very friendly. And as I was told, these Indians also had a type of\ncommunity life. They...1f somebody got something, they brought it to the oldest woman in\nthe tribe, and she would then distribute to each one as you needed. They cared for each other\nand helped each other. And for this reason, we felt quite close to them. My father tells me\nthat he met some of the...of the leaders of the ___, of the Indian tribe, and they gave us\nsome land. And my father asked him, \"How much do we pay?\" And the Indian said, \"One\ndollar.\u201d And then the brothers asked shall we sign a document, the Indian said, \"No. Shake\nhands on this. That's enough. We feel...we feel something from you which doesn't require\nany legal documents.\u201d In the end, we decided not to stay in the Chaco. It was too difficult.\nThe agriculture __ was too bad. It was too hot, and then this military question played also\ninto it. So then the brothers went to what is called East...east Paraguay, __ Paraguay, and\nthere along side some other Mennonite colonies, we found a big...not an estate, a\nbig...uh...cattle ranch. I think four thousand acres or something like that, maybe more. And\nthe man wanted to sell us and we bought part of this. And we called it...it was called Priwara,\nwhich means Spring. So when this became clear, we all got on a truck and they drove us out\non the truck to the train station. We got back to kilometer 144, drove to Kasaro, got on a\nboat, and went down 2 days I think...2 days and a night, to a place called Protorosario, which\nmeans Rosario Port, and there again Mennonites fetched us with their horse wagons. We\ndrove 60 kilometers inland to this new place which we had acquired. There were no\nbuildings on this place. It was nothing. It was just wild woods...uh...plains, swamp, and while\nthe members of the...the men of the community start to build houses, we children stayed with\nthe Mennonites in their schools, in their homes...I think again for at least | or 2 months. And\nthen finally we could all move up to the Primiwara, and start our community life again. As I\nthink about the whole thing, from the sake of conscious, my parents started from scrap just\nabout every 10 years. In Switzerland were scrapped and they went to Germany, they started\nfrom with nothing, with the Bruderhof, and the left that, went to England. So and that is a\ndifficult thing, to start with nothing, everything 10 years is quite something. Now in\nPrimawara, we started building houses. Uh...In that country, there is a lot of timber, so we\nhad to get timber. You cut the trees yourself. You can't buy it. You cut the trees 1n the forest.\nYou bring them out what they call__, which 1s a contraption consisting of two\nenormous wheels 6 feet high, big wheels with an axle, pulled by 12 oxens and the log maybe\n30, 50 60 feet long is balanced under this axle and the oxen pull it out of the wood and then\nyou cut it up by hand. You can imagine this was all a lot of work for everybody. We built\nfour big halls, a roof, no walls, no interior walls, and with just curtains separating the\ndifferent families and there we stayed until we could build better housing. We started right\naway with agriculture, which 1s basically all we knew. We start with tannery, wooden\ntannery. In Paraguay, there's some wonderful woods, exotic woods, which make beautiful\nvases, sugar bowls, candle holders, things like that which people buy. So we went into\ntannery and agriculture. We started our own school there, and I remember that there were 3\nwoods. It's hot in Paraguay. It's sub-tropical country, and...uh...summer it goes up to 100,\nvery humid. Every day a thunderstorm, and winter it goes down to 32 degrees, 33 fahrenheit.\nThere was a little bit of ice, no snow, but cold because we were not used...having hot\nweather all the time...to this cold weather. So in this place called Priawara, there were three\nwood islands. The first one...the first one we cleared and built a dining room, communal\nkitchen and a store house. And the second little wood which was maybe 100, maybe 200\nyards away, was the preschool and the kindergarten (clearing throat) and in the third one we\ncleared...and I remember with machetes we cleared the cactus on the brush, and then\nwe...there we built some school houses, school rooms, where all the children were educated.\nWe had our own teachers which we always wanted. We...we feel that in this community life,\nwe want to have certain values. Values of love, peace, justice, and we...(clearing throat) we\nknow that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a school to\nbe...uh....wholeheartedly going 1n one direction. So this we had our own school with our own\nteachers. It was difficult, but other people died so simply by being able to live, it was a\ngreat...a great thing already. In Paraguay we stayed til 1960. I lived there for 20 years. I also\nlived part of my life in Uruguay, and also a country in South America, Montediveo.\n(Clearing throat) While we were in Paraguay, there were some revolutions. There're always\nrevolutions somewhere going on. And we were on the...on the battle line...uh...different\nparties winning and losing. They always asked us to help them supply wagons with horses to\ncarry the ammunition and the soldiers. We always refused this. If a soldier's hungry, we give\nhim food. If he's hurt, we'll help him, but we will not take part in furthering military\nobjectives in any way. And this was dangerous. My father, again, was...he had to meet these\nofficers and they threatened to kill him more than once by not...by refusing to help. But I feel\nthat by holding on to values which one has, it's the best thing we can do. If one starts\ncompromising, it gets...one gets on slippery ground very fast.",
        "A: The Paraguayan government was...is a Catholic government complete. The whole country is\nCatholic. They took us in because they needed people on the...on the land working\nagriculture. Paraguay is a country which lost...I don't know exact the figures, but they had a\nbig war with Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil, and they lost enormous amount of people there,\nespecially men and boys. So they needed people to come to the country. Not business people\nin the cities, but on the country. And therefore the Paraguayan government gave us religious\nfreedom. We were not Catholics. They gave us complete authority in our villages. No\npoliceman had any business there. They gave us freedom of school...of teaching children\nhow we wanted, and they freed us from military service...uh...for generations. And this...this\nwas...this made us very happy that this was possible. So the government was very friendly in\nthat way. And we worked hard. We started an industry of...uh...wood saw...sawing logs, and\nthis tannery and printing from...We worked together with a speaker, an organization from the\nUnited States, which helps third world countries improve cattle...uh...corn, soybeans.\nDifferent things like that. They came to us, and we had some very good agronomists\namongst members, and so they had a station on our land where they experimented to\nimprove peanuts, corn, soybeans, and so on. So we worked with them, and that also helped\nus, of course. In the beginning, the cow...we needed milk for the children. The cows were all\nwild cows. They gave half a cup of milk if you were lucky. So we needed to improve the\ndairy, and this took year but it got improved eventually. For us children, it was actually a\nnice time. We never suffered hunger. We...we didn't get to eat meat, but we had bread. We\nhad beans. This is fine. One doesn't need to live in big luxury to feed comfortable. We had\nthe school there. We were cared for. There was a lot of sickness at first. Eye\ndiseases....uh...tropical sores, hookworm, malaria. All these things happened.\nBut...uh...standing together and helping each other and supporting each other made it\npossible to get over this time. Now, the...the school was all in...in English I think. I'm not\nquite sure. In Germany, we spoke only German. In England we switched over from German\nand English. In Paraguay, it was German and English and then English I think and Spanish,\nso I grow up in three languages. That's why...that's why my spelling to this day is a little\nwobbly as Pooh Bear would say. So we had this school there, and we had 9 years of school\nto the 9th grade, and then I was asked with another boy...another boy from the community, to\ngo to public school, to go to high school but you had to need, you need Spanish for this. So\nhe and I went to Ascuncion, the capitol, where some other people were studying to be\nteachers. Uh...Mainly teachers actually we needed. We went there to what's called the\nKindergrotto, 5th grade, which is the...the last year of the primary school. In Paraguay,\nthey...I think they use a French system. Six years primary education, six years high school,\nand then six or seven years university. That's how the system works. So we were quite\nold,...uh...but we had to do this last year's primary education, kindergrotto. We didn't know\nany Spanish hardly, and we had...we had a heck of a time. (Laughing) Even in the State-run\nschools, they hardly had any...any...uh...notebooks. No textbooks, so the teacher dictated. I\nremember writing everything down as fast I could. They speak very fast, and then I went\nhome. He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the community who was\nstudying to be a teacher. He tried to decipher what we had written down so we could learn it\nlater. And I stayed in this community in the...the Bruderhof house as we call it for quite a\nnumber of years trying to get this education. This Bruderhof served a number of functions. In\nParaguay you can't just.. uh...order something and UPS brings it. It doesn't work like that. It\ndoesn't work like that, so all the buying and selling went on in the capitol and then you had\nto organize transport from the capitol to the colony. And especially in the beginning years,\nwe had to buy sugar, the soap, the wheat. Everything had to be bought in the capitol and then\ntransported to the colony.",
        "A: So this house which we had in..uh...1n Ascunion, the capitol, was a building which we rented\nand later bought. And this study was the young people studying, mainly to be teachers or\ngoing to secondary school, high school and maybe could be compared to high school. We\nalso had some people there. We had a...store, where we sold tanned goods from the...from\nthe community in the country. And we sold quite of these tanned things out of wood. Mainly\ntourists, Americans who came through brought these. We also made there orange juice,\nconcentrated orange juice and sold it there. And this capitol also, all the business was\ntransacted. As I said, sugar, flour, soap, matches, all the things we didn't make ourselves.\nCloth. All the things we didn't make ourselves had to be bought somehow and then\ntransported up to this colony which we had. To get from Ascunion to the colony took about 2\ndays...a day, a night and a day. One night traveling with a little river boat, maybe...yeah..to\n_____ and then a day's travel with a horse wagon from the port to the colony...to the\ncommunity. While being in..1n Ascunion, I remember a time of revolution which happened\nevery now and then and there was wild shooting. They have...uh...metal telephone on power\npoles, sheet metal and you could...they were like sieves sometimes at the end of these\nrevolutions. You know the bullets going right through them. This all made me...made one\nremember the times of Germany, England, so this kind of thing went on. We...I stayed in\nAscunion, together with the other people for the whole school year, because things started in\nJanuary and ended maybe in October and then for the summer holidays I went back to my\nfamily in the community in the country. Another important thing that...that happened to us\nwas since we had three doctors on the pharmacists and the helper on the pharmacy who\ncame with us to Primaware, this community in Paraguay, when the...when the surrounding\nneighbors found out that we had three doctors, they came flocking because there was not a\ndoctor in a hundred miles circumference. They had no where to go with their disease and\nthere's plenty of tropical diseases there. Leprosy, ___, hookworms. I tell you it was terrible.\nSo these people all came for help. We...we did what we could, but also lacked help. So very\nearly in the game, then we sent people to North America, brothers and sisters to go to visit\nbig pharmacological places here in the States and beg for medical equipment, medication,\nmoney, whatever to start to help these people down there. And bit by bit we built a hospital. I\nthink at the highest point it had maybe 30 or 40 beds. The doctors did all kinds of operations.\nUh...People came when the children were born, hookworm treatment...uh...Saturday night\nbrawls. All this kind of thing came to the hospital, and we did what we could. We asked\npayment insofar as the people could...could pay, but I don't think we ever insisted. We didn't\ngo to court to demand payment. That we never did. Some people paid with eggs or a pig or a\ncow, but we have to realize that in Paraguay the people living in the country are very poor.\nThey don't have any money. They have very few things. And so we just helped basically. We\njust helped. But food...sending people to the United States...the people coming here found\nother people interested in a different way of life where the rat race is cut out. You know\nrunning after money, spending it, having to spend it. Day and night keeping going ...and this\nkind of frenzy some people didn't want anymore. And they were looking for a different way\nof life altogether. So when we sent people up there, they met some who were interested and\nthey came to visit us in Paraguay which is very important because we were very isolated in\nthe country, and we never wanted to live for ourselves, for our own edification, for our own\nsalvation. That is not our purpose. Our purpose is to show everybody that people can live in\npeace and justice and harmony together. That this 1s possible right now. And we are.... am\nnot better than anybody else. I've got the same inclinations, temptations in my heart, but the\nquestion is where do I call it... where do I say stop? And living in community, having this\ngoal of love to each other...a true love which admonishes which helps. This kind of love is\nwhat actually every human being longs for. And so we did never wanted to live for\nourselves. We wanted...we hoped that we can be a witness to other people that the life and\nbrotherhood is possible. To Catholics, to Protestants, to Jews, to Moslems, to Agnostics, to\nAtheists, it doesn't matter. To bums to rich men. And so when these people came from North\nAmerica, they asked many questions. Why you do this? Why you this? And this is good for\nus. We need to see what we're doing also through other people eyes and...and see if we are\nstill true to what we want to do. And so this was good. In 1954, I think, well we had people\nthen in the States traveling all the time, meeting with interested people. There was an\nintentional community movement in the United States in the 50s, and so we visited these\npeople and some wanted to join and some said, \"You're too far away in Paraguay. Why don't\nyou start a community up here?\" So in 1954, we started a community in New York State\nnear...between Kingston and Poughkeepsie. There's a little town called Roseton, near\nNewport, and there we bought some land and some houses and started Hutterian Bruderhof\nwhere people could come and see if they were ready to join or if they wanted it all, and so\nthis was very good. (Clearing throat) Now back to Paraguay. I went to school and then I\nwent to University. I was training to become a doctor, a medical physician. And as I said,\nthere were different revolutions going on so when I was in first, second year in medicine,\nthere was a big upheaval in the university and South American altogether and also in\nParaguay. The students are active social movement. They...the young people protest\ninjustice, the political oppression. And so the students were always in a... in a revolt, you\nknow, in a stir, in a commotion, asking for justice. But one day the police came and closed\nthe university down because the government didn't like this social upheaval. They called it\ncommunists. And...uh...so the closed the university down and the Brother decided that I\nshould go to Montediveo in Uruguay to continue with the studies. And so I went down there\nand finished up later on. And it was in Uruguay, the little community called there called\nEldorado, about 10 miles out of Montediveo, where the...where we started another little\ncommunity. It started just with a few people working in a dairy farm and then we felt it's\nbetter not to be employed, but really start a community so we did that. We bought, I think,\nmaybe 20, 30 acres with some housing on it. We sent families down there. Because we\nwanted to be near..near a place where people...where we could talk to people and meet\npeople. We didn't want to live for ourselves. And also in Ascunion, we didn't find enough\nplaces for the young people to be educated in different things, and so this community in\nElarado, near Montediveo, Uruguay was supposed to be another center for young people to\ngo to and train. Maybe I should say at this point that in our community we, the children born\ninto the community are not members. There's no automatic birthright membership. The\nyoung people they are born there. They grow up and we try to give them as good education\nas we can which varies. In Paraguay it was very limited. Here in the States, we're very\ngrateful for the education into high school which is free of charge. But this wasn't so in\nParaguay, so...so these children as they grow up, they...they get educated. They get to know\nwhat this community life is all about, but then we're very interested to let them experience\nhow other people live so they can come to a decision seeing both sides of the picture, so to\nsay, and come to a personal decision. If you want to join in the Bruderhof, it cannot be\nfor..for the parents\u2019 sake. It cannot be for brothers and sisters. It can't be for a good life which\nwe now have. We have a good life now. It can't be for any kind of...uh...comfort. It can only\nbe for the sake to show the people can live together. And we found that 1f we do what Jesus\nsaid, it happens. Now, I want to go back to the time in Germany. When my father and I and a\ngroup of others visited Israel in 1985, we knew that the question of the Holocaust wold come\nup and there our Jewish friends asked, \"What do you think of the Holocaust?\" And my\nfather answered after a moment of silence...I was there. I heard it. He said, \"The Holocaust is\na judgment on the Christians. Because (clearing throat) all the Germans who did the killing\nwere nominal Christians. Catholics and Protestants. And I know that Jesus did not say kill\nyour enemy. He didn't even say kill the handicapped. He didn't say kill the imbecile, the\nmentally handicapped. He said love your fellowman which is told in the Tennah by God\nhimself. So this...this love is what we need, and so therefore we said in Israel and kibbutz\nHasara in 85, \"It is a judgment on the Christians because they did not do what they said they\nwere.\u201d (Clearing throat) And then my father went on to say, \"But if we Christians and you\nJews don't take a lesson, don't learn from this Holocaust experience, the Holocaust will come\nthat takes all of us.\u201d And I think the present day world situation is just about that.",
        "A: Yes. I went back in 88 once. We had gone again to Israel, invited by the kibbutz movement\nto visit them. We stayed there 3 weeks and then back to Germany. And I remember going to\nthe train station there and I had all these memories coming back from 1937. (Crying) So I\nremember that. We have a little...I hope it doesn't matter if I skip around a bit. So this was\nthe answer my father gave about the Holocaust. Now for the last few...since | year we have\nstarted a community in Germany again in Bernba, near Frankfort, in the ___. And we went\nto this...we went to this village and we bought a property which used to belong to the\nCatholic CHurch. It was a children's home. It was very well suited to community life. It had\nplans for three or four more big buildings, community-type buildings. And so we bought this\nproperty and then a resistance developed from the inhabitants of this small village of Bernba,\n400 people maybe, which was so...uh...strong against us coming and against us extending\nthat a Lutheran...Angelical minister in Bernba said publicly in a church, \"Have we forgotten\nwhat happened 50 years ago? That we are so antagonistic and hateful to people who are not\nfit into our system?\" She was referring to 1937...uh...to the whole Nazi time where\nforeigners, Jews...uh...second class citizens were simply hated and exterminated. She...she\nsaid, \"Is...are we there again? Have we not learned?\" There was a real confrontation there\nand we..we don't know what to do. We invite the neighbors to come and see and talk. We\nsing together, but there 1s a real little circle there that wants to get us out of Bernba. This\ncaused an uproar in the newspapers. Television companies came and made, you know,\ntelevisions and...uh...programs which were broadcast all over Germany. So we think again\nthis attack on us in the end served something good. People hear about the brotherly way of\nlife.",
        "A: Yes. In Germany, we are still holding on. We don't know how to go, but we're still holding\non. We have no permission to build. We have no...we can't do a thing because the village\nauthority hasn't given permission yet. But we hope it will mellow. We heard that the place\nwe bought in Bernba was a real Nazi center for Nazi, you know, so maybe their spirit 1s still\nthere. Personally, I don't think that the Nazi spirit or this hate spirit can be eliminated by\nkilling the people who represent it. I heard that Cohan was killed...murdered yesterday or\ntwo days ago. And he was...he was very right wing and...and hateful to other people, but I\ndon't think killing him kills the spirit he was serving. And this 1s...this 1s what we think all\nthe time. And it...on the ____ Bruderhof, I remember that the brotherhood which we called\nthe Committed Members, they wrote letters to Hitler, to Goring, to the Gestapo, to the Nazi\nofficials in Kassel, stating our situation very clearly. We respect the government. We are not\nintending to overcome it with violence, but we can have nothing to do with certain values\nthey uphold. So we want to love the enemy, but without killing him, without hurting him.\nThis is...this is what we aim for. But this 1s a struggle for every person. I...I can be committed\nto a goal, but it still is harder for me to work towards, because I'm just a humanbeing. So\nhere I digressed a little. (Clearing throat) Now, let me think a moment. So we started a\ncommunity in the...1n North America and we...(clearing throat) in 1960, then we decided to\nclose down all the Paraguayan communities and all come up to the States. We went through\na difficult time in our communities which I maybe can explain best by saying our Hutterian\nforefathers from the 16th Century compare a community to a lantern, a glass lantern with a\ncandle in the middle like they used to have. And the community is a lantern, but the\nimportant thing in the lantern is the light in the lantern. The lantern serves only to let the light\nshine out. And this light for us is Jesus as love, justice and unity. That is the light. And we\nlost this light. And...uh..(clearing throat) so the things that destroy community life---self-will,\nselfishness, egotism, huddling, back biting--all these things that destroy community life\ncame in. And in 1960, we went through a time where we (clearing throat) everyone was\nfaced with the question what do I want with my life? Do I want to serve love or do I want to\nserve myself? And on this then (clearing throat) a large number left us. And the rest we came\ntogether in North America here, and then we started the community in Connecticut in\nNorfolk, Connecticut and that's the northwestern corner. And we were...we bought an old\nplace...it is a castle. We don't like castles, but this was a place where a hundred people could\nfind lodging right away. And so we bought this place and 50 acres and in a feel for different\ngroups, we moved up from Paraguay to North America. Because we needed to...together to\nfind the way to work for the values we had set. And as humanbeings, we have goals but we\nalways liable to...to move either to the left or to the right and lose the way, but we are\ndetermined to find it. And so that's why we came together in North America again. While in\nUruguay, I met my future wife, Elana. She was there studying music. She's part...she's a\ndaughter of the family of the community. She came down to study music, and we got\nengaged down there. And we were engaged for 3 years, because it was in this...this whole\ntime that we closed one community after the other and moved up to the States so there was\nno time for a marriage. But when she came up in January 1962...1 came up in November\n1961...(clearing throat) we decided to marry. And when I say we, I mean my wife and I and\nthe whole community because all such actions are take...the decisions are made together.\nAnd so we married in June... 24th of June 1962. (Clearing Throat) We had a...1t was a\nwonderful occasion. Then we had two children in Connecticut and then we were asked to\nmove to our community in Pennsylvania which had also started.
