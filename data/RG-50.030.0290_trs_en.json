        "Q: Will you begin by telling me your maiden name, when you were born, where you were\nborn?",
        "A: Well, my maiden name was Fletcher, and I was born in ;",
        "Q: Was your name Henny Fletcher?",
        "A: My name was Henny Fletcher, and I was born in Kovno, Lithuania, in 1924.",
        "Q: The date?",
        "A: November 25, 1924. Well, are you already recording me? Yes? I had a younger brother,\nwho was three years younger than I was, and I suppose we could be considered an upper\nmiddle class family, because we had a lovely apartment and my brother and I went to a\nprivate school which was a rarity. Basically, I was not lacking in anything. I was pretty\nhappy go lucky young kid, and we were both growing up like average two children. We\nused to go to the country in the summer time, and in the winter time, I used to spend my\ndays after school on the ice skating rink in Macobie (ph) because I like gymnastics. And\nmy brother was a nuisance, like all the other little brothers who were always in the way. I\ncannot tell you that I had any difficulty growing up.",
        "Q: What was your father's business?",
        "A: My father was a businessman. He was actually in manufacturing. He didn't, he people\nwho did it for him, educational toys, like chess, dominoes and all the other ones and also\nchildren's games. The highlight of my life was in December, my father used to deliver all\nthe -- have the orders delivered to the stores on our main street, which is the equivalent of\nPark Avenue in Kovno, which , and all these stores were Gentile stores\nmostly, and I was the one who used to deliver all these packaged orders. And I had\nfriends of mine who were looking forward every year in December to accompany me\nbecause my father used to hire a sled with two horses and a driver, not a driver actually,\nwhatever you call him, and he used to put all the boxes in the sled and put my friend, the\none which I picked, and me in the seat cover with a heavy fur cover, and then we used to\nstop near every store. I used to walk out. He used to deliver the box. And I used to say I\nam Fletcher's daughter in Lithuania, and they used to give me the money. It was the\nhighlight of me and my friends period usually before Christmas time. I had an\nexceptional father, really, because he had tremendous confidence in me. He just thought\nat the age of 10 or 11 that I could do anything. And I remember when I was 11 years old,\nhe called me into his room, and he opened up the desk drawer, on the right side, second\ndrawer, and he showed me a bank book and there was money in there, written down how\nmuch money. And I said to him, \"what's that for?\" He said, \"that's for you, for your\ndowry.\" And I said to him, \"dowry, you're not going to pay anybody to marry me.\" I was\nso furious then. As I said, he instilled in me tremendous confidence, self confidence, and\nI think that helped me a lot during the war and after the war because he was a great\noptimist. He was a very funny man. He always had interesting jokes and interesting\nstories. He also designed calendars -- in Lithuania -- I don't know Lithuania-- but every\nsingle day you tore off a page. I think they have it here, too, I'm not sure. And on the\nback of the page of each day there was a joke, and my father was the one who wrote all\nthe jokes on the other side of each day. So, I grew up in a household with almost like a\nfunny man and he always made life very happy and amusing.",
        "Q: Were you close with your mother, too?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I had a wonderful mother. She was the opposite, very quiet, very refined lady\nwho always looked for me to help out, but I was never around because I was busy, as I\nsaid, having fun. But she had help, but she was a lovely lady, unassuming and very gentle\nand very kind and I loved her very much. She was a very pretty lady. I remember on high\nholidays she used to get dressed up always in a grey wool suit with a silver fox fur for not\na collar, but it was called a shawl. And she was blond, and every year she used to go to\nthe women who used to make hats and the hat was always open on top so her blond hair\nwould show and an large, large brim. And whenever she used to walk in the synagog for\nthe high holidays, people looked at her. She was tall and a very nice lady.",
        "Q: Were you religious?",
        "A: No. Well of course we were kosher in the house. I wouldn't say we were ultra religious,\nbut we were kosher at home, and we celebrated the high holidays and Hanukkah and\nPassover and traditional, I would call it. Then, of course, when the Russians came into\nLithuania, we were kind of on pins and needles, because my father was a businessman.\nHe was afraid they were going to send us to Siberia. So, he started planning on how we\nshould get out of Lithuania. It wasn't easy, actually, for people who are more or less\nestablished to just throw away everything and pick up the family and leave. That was in\n1939, and at that time, we had relatives in Germany, and one time they sent us a letter\nasking us to help them, because they had this store. They were store keepers and one day\nthe Germans came in -- that was written in the letter -- the Germans came in, took away\nthe head of the family from the store and told the wife, he's going to be back in a few\ndays. We just want to interrogate him. The next day, two days later, they came back with\na little box, which in Lithuania peppercorns came in little boxes, and they came back and\nhanded her the box, put it on the counter and said, \"this is your husband.\" So, this was the\nletter we received in '39. And of course, my parents tried to help them to leave, and they\ndid arrive in Kovno, but is didn't sound real. It just didn't sound that people could do that\nto other people. So, my mother definitely felt that something was wrong with her, but my\nfather kind of believed it because there were quite a number of Polish Jews who kept on\nrunning away at that time from Poland. So, he started somehow plotting things out how\nto get out. So, the first thing he did, which he wasn't silly, but he went to to\nsee his family because he came from Vilna. I'm just digressing because I just wanted to\nshow you what a great man he was in a way. He wasn't actually, he wasn't demonstrative,\nbut he was exceptionally supportive of me. I don't know, but he really was. Before the\nRussians came in, I had a beautiful coat made for me. It was grey wool, fur collar, a\ntrench coat with a belt, very sharp. So, my father took the coat and said he was going to\nsee his family in Vilna, and he came back and the lining of the coat was removed and\nbehind the lining was all mink -- filled in with mink. He felt that in case something 1s\ngoing to happen to him, I should have something to fall back on, to sell the coat or sell\nthe mink for my mother and my brother and myself. That is the kind of family I grew up.\nI really and truly feel personally that I cannot, how should I say it, I could not let this four\nyears, or actually three years, actually horrible three years, ruin my life, ruin me for the\nrest of my life. It was a period where actually the world went mad, and I happened to be\ncaught in between. It could have happened to anybody who was there. That to destroy the\nrest of my life and to feed my children with experiences of madmen after the war and live\nin the past, I couldn't do that, because my upbringing was great.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a little bit more about Kovno before the war. Was it a great place to grow\nup?",
        "A: Yes, I had no difficulties.",
        "Q: The city, I mean, were there things to do?",
        "A: Yes. There was this school we went to, they had all kind of functions. It was a very good\nschool. And then of course in the winter time we had the ice skating rinks with the music,\nand we used to go outside and play and dance and do all these wild things, which were\nwild then. Then I belonged to Macabe, which is an organization, which is a sport\norganization. I used to spend my days there. I was the ping pong champion. And in the\nsummer we went to the country where I used to hike. I really, maybe I never encountered\nany problems. I was always exposed to Jewish people, Jewish school, except for the\npeople who were dealing with my father, who were exceptionally nice, too, because\napparently they needed his product.",
        "Q: So you didn't have any difficulties?",
        "A: I really didn't, but it turned out worse with the Germans, eventually.",
        "Q: You had a nice life. Did it ever occur to you that that would be taken away?",
        "A: No, no. Not only did it never occur me, but even when I was in concentration camp, I\nalways expected to survive. And I really attributed it to my father. I'm serious, because in\nretrospect, I mean I thought about it before you came. He really instilled in me a\ntremendous amount of self assurance and confidence, and if you just do your thing, you'll\nmake it if you want it badly enough.",
        "Q: Now, you were mentioning that you were starting to get concerned after the Russians\ncame in.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: What sorts of opportunities were taken away from you at that time? How did your life\nchange?",
        "A: You mean to leave Lithuania?",
        "Q: No, just in Kovno when the Russians were there, were certain things prohibited to you?\nCould you continue to practice your religion. Did you still go to school? Was everything\nbasically the same, or did it change?",
        "A: Well, the first thing that changed was the Russians had a theory that they had to relocate\nthe people. Never to leave the same people in the same area. So, what they did, the first\nthing they did was to move me from my school to another school where I didn't know\nanybody. I did know some, but -- and the people from the other school were moved to my\nschool. So, they kind of mixed the whole thing up. And, they also, of course introduced\nall Russian history and Russian, and we were fed with all the Russian propaganda. I\nwouldn't say -- the only problem as far as I recall is that we were fearful that any day\nthey'll come and just take us to Siberia because everybody around us, whoever was in\nbusiness, that's where they wound up. The truck used to come, just like the Germans\nactually. They had the same system. Without warning, they used to knock at your door\nand say, \"Come, take whatever you can just take with you.\" Put you on a truck, put you\non a train, and send you to Siberia. So, that was our only fear at that time.",
        "Q: Did you know people that were going to Siberia, did you know where they were going?",
        "A: Well, they knew, they knew that's what the Russians are doing. They did have some\ninclination of what they were doing. The people, especially who are in business, who are\nemploying people. So, that was the only fear which I recall my father had. But,\notherwise, and as I said, I got used to being in the new school, and I kept on doing my\nown thing.",
        "Q: Did you continue to practice Jewish holidays and all?",
        "A: I don't really recall, because we were not that religious that it affected us. Probably the\npeople who were religious it affected them. But I don't recall going to Temple that year\nfor all the high holidays. That's something that is kind of murky in my mind.",
        "Q: Do you remember the first day of the war in Kovno?",
        "A: Yes, I do, very much so. It was 1941, June 21, 1941. That was a day that I was supposed\nto go to my school, my original school to pick up my diploma because I had graduated\nfrom high school. I had a pair of silk stockings, which I kept for that special occasion, to\nput on a pair of silk stockings. I walked to school, which was quite a distance, and I\npicked up my diploma. It was all rolled up with a ribbon, and I walked home, and as I\npassed where the President of Lithuania lived, suddenly something fell out from an\nairplane, because they bombed the President's quarters. I fell on the sidewalk. I got up. I\nwasn't really concerned about the bomb more than that I tore my stockings. I came home,\nand we knew something was going to happen because we really -- in spite of the fact that\nwe did not want to believe that the Germans are going to come into Lithuania, and we\nhoped that it would just pass us by, we knew that they are there and we had no choice at\nthat time. We were already caught between the devil and the .",
        "Q: Can you describe the atmosphere in the street at that point?",
        "A: It was chaotic. It was very, very chaotic. It's very difficult to describe the chaos. People\nreally didn't know what to do, because they were trapped. We were really just trapped.\nWe couldn't do anything. We didn't have weapons. We didn't have anything. We didn't\nhave anybody on our side. It wasn't only the Germans that were against us, it was actually\nthe Lithuanians started before the Germans started. So, they started looting and\nscreaming and yelling and beating us up. So, we didn't know which way to turn.",
        "Q: You saw this and this was just all around?",
        "A: Oh, all around us, all around us, yes. We kept our door locked, and we were lucky that\nthey must have got enough from the people around so they didn't manage to break down\nour door. They were terrible, unbelievable. It was such like, like I said, I never had any\ncontact with them before, but they turned like animals. It was just neighbors, people who\nyou dealt with. They suddenly -- it was almost like they waited for it, like hungry dogs\nand so it was rough. It was really rough. You know, I read a book by an author by the\nname of Bothenheimer (ph). He's a Jew. I'm just telling you a little story about it. I belong\nto a study group, and in the book it described about a bunch of Jews who believed they\nwere being taken by the Germans to a hotel and that eventually they would be staying\nthere until after the war. I was the only survivor. The rest of the people in the group were\nAmericans. And after reading the book the discussion was going on, how stupid could\nyou be. Couldn't you just stand up against the Germans? Couldn't you just stand up\nagainst the Lithuanians? There were so many and there were only three or four soldiers\naround you. And I was absolutely furious, because it wasn't a matter that we were weak,\nor that we were like sheep. We had no choice. How can you just protect yourself against\na bunch of mad dogs. You just can't do that. I mean people did it, and they were\nimmediately killed in front of you. So you just hoped against hopes that you will make it\nwithout making any waves.",
        "Q: Now, in the first few days after the bombs were dropped and the Lithuanians were\nrunning around beating people, can you describe what else was happening?",
        "A: Not really, not really. Just trying to figure out what's going to be next, and we were at\nhome most of the time. We wouldn't dare walk out of the house until they came around\nwith those loud speakers directing us what to do. But we packed. We packed mostly\nsilver and mostly valuable things because, you know, in spite of the fact that we hadn't\nexperienced things like that since almost 1924, for I'd say almost 20 years or so, or less\nthan that, we lived a relative normal life. Really, a normal life, but when something\nhappens to you you kind of know it's the survival of the fittest. You kind of know what to\ndo. And you start thinking, you don't need a pillow, you don't need extra clothes, you\nneed something that you can trade eventually. So, we took the silver and some of the\njewelry, which my mother had and every upper middle class family had something,\nbecause there was no stainless steel and there was no other kind of this stuff which is sold\nhere now, so whatever you had was kind of silver or gold. It was not synthetic. And we\nknew that the farmers outside in the country will be glad to acquire it, to exchange. Not\nthat we ever experienced it before, but like I said, it's something that you just know.",
        "Q: Now, I know a lot of people were herded up, right away taken outside of the city and\nkilled. Was this something that you were aware of at the time?",
        "A: No, no I found out later on. Like I said, we were just lucky.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with the Jewish part of the city, Slobotka (ph), at this point, or\nwere you separated?",
        "A: No, no. We did not live -- we lived in Kovno. Actually we lived behind the Post Office.\nThere was the front of the Post Office and behind was the interior where they had\nbuildings. We lived in one of the apartment buildings behind the Post Office. So, maybe\nthat's why, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe they just didn't want to destroy the Post\nOffice. They thought maybe the Post Office not too many Jews live. I don't know, but we\nwere not bothered. We just waited to hear what the next step would be.",
        "Q: It was several weeks, and then did you have to move from where you were living?",
        "A: Yes. Then we were told that we had to go to the Ghetto because they were going to have\na separate place, a Ghetto, for the Jews. All they kept on yelling was and we\ntook whatever we could. Now, I don't remember how we got there. I totally forget. I\nmean I remember so many details, but this is one thing that I just do not remember how\nwe got there. I know we didn't walk. It was quite a distance, and I know that we had quite\na lot of stuff by the time we came to the Ghetto, so maybe Father arranged -- I can't really\n-- it's blank. All I know is that we wound up in a small apartment, which was called at\nthat time the Small Ghetto and which was actually this is where most of the Jews were\nbrought in that particular part of the town. And then after a short period of time, they\nstarted coming in and asking for silver and whatever you have, all your valuables, the\nones who brought there, and I remember my parents handing over a box of something\nwith stuff. They saved some of the other ones and then after that there was the big\nwhich was called, they decided to shrink, that was their method to shrink up\nthe area, and we were told to come out on the field, four in a row. Actually eight in a row.\nWe started out, and my best friend and her brother and her father and mother were in the\nsame row with the four of us, and they were the other four. And they said, everybody\neight in a row and just walk. And the Germans, young, absolutely young faces, must be\n18 or 19, inconceivable how you can motivate young people to be so cruel. They just\nwalked and they separated in half, four and four, and they send my friend and her family\non one side and my father and mother and brother on the other side. We didn't know what\nhappened. It turned out that her side was the bad side, and these people from that\nparticular side never came back. They were taken and they were killed. Now, all I can\ncontribute it to is luck. She certainly -- I wasn't certainly better than she was and her\nfamily. We were both the same people and so, I'm here probably because I was just\nlucky. So, when they shrunk it, when they eliminated almost half of the population, we\nhad to move to another area in the Ghetto.",
        "Q: This was when, do you remember?",
        "A: This was only 1941. It was quite early.",
        "Q: Soon after the Ghetto was formed?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because at the same time they also called out, they asked for 500 people who\nare, I mean, personalties, who speak German, who are educated, who are so on and so\nforth. They had names and these people who were actually dealing with Germany for\nyears, my father almost went because he represented a Germany company too in 1932,\nand who were professional people. They all went, hoping that they would be able to do\nsomething to negotiate with the Germans or influence them. They were called out, and\nthey were killed. This was known as the 500, the top, the cream really of the Jewish\npopulation. So, that was all in the same period of time, and they were trying somehow, in\nretrospect that's the only way I can understand, to kind of shrink the population.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Now this action that you were talking about where 500 people were taken away, this was\nin the beginning days of the Ghetto?",
        "A: Yes. My uncle actually was one of them. He was taken away, and his wife and a child\nlived with us in the same apartment.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about when you lived in the Ghetto. Who was with you?",
        "A: Well, we had a kitchen, a bedroom and a dining room. My brother and my mother and\nmy father and my aunt, who's husband was taken away with the first 500, and her child\n, who was five years old. My father worked for the guild it was\ncalled, and I went in the morning to the area where they set up people to go to work, and\nI used to get up in the morning. My mother used to stay home, and my brother was\nyounger, so he also stayed home for a short period of time with her. I used to get up and\ngo out to, what do you call it? It was a large area where everybody got together near the\ngate, and there there were leaders. The Germans needed people, and it was like groups\nthat they took them outside of the Ghetto to do some labor. I was lucky enough to fall\ninto the group where my husband was heading that particular group.",
        "Q: You mean you met him? He wasn't your husband then?",
        "A: No, of course not. I was standing there, actually I was standing there 1n the group, and he\nhad a group of men, and he said he needed a secretary, and he asked me to join him. So, I\nwas lucky. So, I was working in his group. What I was doing at that time, I wasn't doing\nsecretarial work. I was working at an airport at that time. They were building the airport,\nand we had to carry wood and drag things and so on and so forth. But, it was not too\ndifficult because eventually I helped him to other things.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: Well, the Germans, they were kind of decent, and they said if you will accomplish your,\nwhat do you call it, if you'll accomplish what you're supposed to do, your quota, you will\nbe able to get some extra flour from the farmers around. So, that is what everybody\nworked very hard. Whether you do or you don't, you don't get anything, but here you are\ntold what you will be getting. We certainly were very conscientious. So, we got flour,\nand what I had to do, I had to divide and kind of weigh the flour and divide the portions\nto every single person. But, I was so generous that a few times there was none left for me.\nSo, my husband told me, at that time he wasn't my husband, he said don't be so generous.",
        "Q: You were also doing the heavy manual labor?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, I did. But this is once in a while that they wanted to be kind they would\nsay, yes, but I was working.",
        "Q: What other kind of work brigades were you on?",
        "A: That's the only one. I was waiting most of the time, and then, of course, I was taken to the\nfarm, a farm. The Germans needed, for what reason I don't know, a group of young\nwomen to take on a farm to apparently pick vegetables or plant vegetables on the farm.\nThey dragged me out of this group, and we found ourselves on this farm. I got up in the\nmorning and walked out on the farm and a German came galloping on a horse, a nice big\nhorse with a saddle, and he looked at all of us. We were about 18, 20 women\napproximately and he picked me and he said to me \"Have you ever ridden a horse?\" I\nsaid no. He said, \"Good, it's time to learn.\" So he got off the horse, and he removed the\nsaddle, and he made me get up on the horse, and he must have talked to the horse or did\nsomething to him because the horse started running like a madman, and I thought to\nmyself, you're not going to lose me off that horse, and I made it. Then I finally came\ndown, he said, \"Now you learn, now you can pick vegetables.\" So, I was there for a\ncouple of days, and then I was lucky enough, because I don't think they came back.",
        "Q: Why did he ask you to do that?",
        "A: It was fun for them. I mean, can you imagine a young woman going on a bare back horse\nwho has never ridden a horse, and a wild one. You know what it means to holding onto\nthe horse, not to fall off and break your neck, because that was what he was probably\nhoping. Who knows, they were mad. They were creatures from hell. They were\nabsolutely mad. I don't think they looked at us as humans and that was exactly what I\ndecided at one time. They didn't look at us as humans. I never looked at them as humans,\nand I'll just try plain and simple to survive because you couldn't look them in the eye. I\nknow a young woman looked them in the eye. They slapped her to death. They couldn't\ntouch us, thank goodness, because they were told they would be poisoned. Otherwise\nthey would have raped every single one of us. We were 18 year old kids. That's what they\ndid. They did all kind of things for recreation.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more of what life was like in the Ghetto itself?",
        "A: Well, life went on when it was quiet, kind of normal in a way. We met, we kissed, we\ndrank, we had fun when we had the opportunity. The young ones, we really tried to live\nas normal a life as you could. You're talking about people who are 18 or 19 years old. We\nhave no responsibilities, we have no children. We have no family. Now, my mother had a\nstroke. I mean she just, as a matter of fact, her brother was killed, and then they had the\nchildren here, and they made my aunt take her child to be killed. She saw her child being\nkilled, being put on a car, on a truck and I think -- I don't know, I heard gasoline. I don't\nknow. When my aunt came back, she was mad for a short period of time, and my mother\nhad a stroke. But she survived, and she was pretty good and that's thanks to my brother.\nHe really came through. He was three years younger than I was, but he was a very smart\ndetermined young boy. First of all, he was tall. He was blond and didn't look Jewish at all\nand that was in his favor because every time he used to go to work, he used to just leave\nthe place and go to Lithuanians, whom he knew, and traded some silver or whatever my\nmother gave him. My mother used to give him a piece of silverware at a time so they\nwould wait for the next piece. He really supported the family. When my mother had her\nstroke, I was married then already, so when my mother had the stroke, he was really there\nfor her, and he brought her everything, and he brought her to the point where she could\nwalk and talk. So, you ask me how was life, if you asked me or all my friends, it's\ndifferent. Because you know youth, we'll overcome. You cannot help it, so we'll do it. It's\ncareless, I don't think 1t was an adventure because it was probably miserable because this\none is gone and that one is gone. The whole thing was kind of scary, and the guys also,\nthey are afraid they were going to die tomorrow, let's have fun. For young people it was\nbad, but not as bad as for my parents.",
        "Q: Were there cultural activities, political activities?",
        "A: No, no. No cultural activities, no political activities, you just try to live from day to day\nand work, and if you have a chance to have some fun, get married because you were\nsafer. I think we got married after that incident on the farm because I wouldn't say it was\nsafer to be married. I mean, I liked my husband and he liked me and he asked my father\nfor my hand and my father said by all means if anybody will take care of you, he's the\none who will, and my father was absolutely right. So, we got married. Not that it\nmattered much eventually, because they separated us eventually. But everybody felt that\nif you were married you were kind of safer.",
        "Q: Did you move in with his family or he came where you were?",
        "A: No. We got married on a Saturday, must have been because we worked on Friday, and I\nmoved in -- actually I couldn't move in right away with his family. His family consisted\nof his mother, a brother and a sister-in-law, and they lived in one room. His mother was\nin the corner. I remember an iron bed. She was a semi-invalid. She had arthritis, a very\nbad case. She was 1n bed most of the time. My husband used to sleep on a cot, and then\nmy brother-in-law and sister-in-law slept in the corner on a bed. When we decided to get\nmarried, my husband decided to build a second bunk, above my brother-in-law's bed. He\nbuilt a very good one. He even cut in the wood a step for me to get up and down. So, it\ntook him a while to build it. So, eventually I moved in with my husband in the upper\ndeck, and he built a little shelf so I could bring my dowry with me, which my mother\ngave me before I left the house. She gave me about a pound of hard sugar, which was\nvery valuable, more so than diamonds. I don't know how she kept it or where she kept it,\nand I brought my dowry up there on the second shelf.",
        "Q: You had mentioned a little while ago, about the Small Ghetto being liquidated. That's\nwhere you were living at the time, wasn't it?",
        "A: When?",
        "Q: When did you first move into the Small Ghetto?",
        "A: Actually first we moved -- it wasn't the Small Ghetto, it was where everybody was. I\ndon't know if it was called the Small Ghetto. Eventually they eliminated one and maybe\nthe second one was called the Small Ghetto. Are you talking before the liquidation?",
        "Q: Yes. In the beginning you said you were moved to the Small Ghetto, and even in the\nbeginning, as I understand it, the Ghetto was in two parts joined by a bridge or\nsomething, do you know?",
        "A: I don't think so. There was no bridge.",
        "Q: Well, I don't know, there was some sort of street, but there were two parts.",
        "A: Yes, right, you're right, there were two parts. I must have been in the small one\noriginally.",
        "Q: The one that they got rid of?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you there the day they decided to liquidate it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: What happened is, they called everybody out in the field and there were eight in a row --",
        "Q: Oh, this was that that you mentioned already, I'm sorry.",
        "A: That's okay.",
        "Q: Do you remember a hospital in there that burned?",
        "A: No. I heard something about it, but I don't remember. This is when they liquidated the\nsmall one, and they separated my friend and her family from us, and we wound up in the\nother part.",
        "Q: Also in that month, a little later in that month, there was a very large action, right?",
        "A: Later that month?",
        "Q: In October, do you remember this?",
        "A: Do you mean when they took children and old people?",
        "Q: No, there was, I believe at the end of October, they took about nine or ten thousand\npeople out, took them to the Ninth Fort, I believe. Do you remember this?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay, then I won't ask you about it.",
        "A: Because, you know, I remember it vaguely, but I really can't contribute much to it. I do\nknow many people disappeared.",
        "Q: All of a sudden a third of the Ghetto is gone?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: So you had to have noticed something?",
        "A: Oh, yes, I noticed it, but I don't remember. I cannot give you any details about it.",
        "Q: Was there a point in all of this when the atmosphere changed and people started to\nbecome more frightened, trying to make plans or hiding places or anything like that?",
        "A: Not then. After the old people and children action, this was when the people realized that\nsomething has to be done.",
        "Q: When was that, can you tell me?",
        "A: This was the most horrendous time. It must have been in 19-- we got married in 1943, in\nNovember. It must have been in the beginning of 1944. It was -- I don't know the exact\ndate, which is immaterial really. I wasn't working at that time. I was off that day, and my\nbrother-in-law, my husband's brother was also home. So, the two of us were home with\nmy husband's mother. Suddenly the loud speaker started screaming all the people and\nchildren out. And my mother-in-law, as I said was a semi-invalid, a wonderful woman,\nan exceptional lady. She used to teach me how to make gourmet dishes. She was a\nfabulous cook. She was a pharmacist by education, a wonderful lady. We didn't know\nwhat to do. We knew she could not walk, so I looked at my brother-in-law, and he looked\nat me, and I said, let's hide her someplace. But before we had a chance to do anything,\nthey just broke into the room. As I told you, we were in one room, all five us, and they\nsaid out to her from bed and I stood in front of her and I said, \"She can't walk.\" So they\ngave me a Slap. She can't walk, so carry her. So I said to Miska, my brother-in-law, let's\nput something on her. She was wearing a nightgown. Anyway, they wouldn't let us do\nanything. They made my brother-in-law grab her by the shoulders, and I had to grab her\nby the foot. I tried to pull down her dress-- it would break my husband's heart-- her\nnightgown, and we carried her out and the street was a nightmare because all you could\nsee were young people carrying these old people like animals. And we carried her to the\nplace where the busses were stationed, and he told my brother-in-law -- they are so\nyoung, it is unbelievable, the milk was still on their lips -- to stay, and I'm the one who\nshould carry her out. Now, she was a frail woman. I must have picked her up, and I\nwalked up on the bus, and I figured that's the end of me too. There was no seat, so I had\nto put her in the aisle, and I covered her up. They looked around to find a seat for me. So,\nthey pushed me down the stairs and said, \"you get out of there.\" That was my memory of\nthis particular day. And I think this 1s when they took them to the Ninth Fort.",
        "Q: You had a little brother at this time. What happened to him?",
        "A: He wasn't so little anymore. You grow up awfully quick. He must have been 15. He was\nan organizer. He kind of supported the family. Immediately after I got off the bus and I\nstarted running, because I was hysterical, because I was sure that my mother was gone\nalso. So, I ran back to my mother's home, and there's my mother sitting in the chair with\nmakeup. I don't know where by brother found makeup. She was 39 years old, my mother,\nor 40. My father was completely beside himself. My father got lost in himself rather, so\nmy brother who is the one who fixed up her hair and put makeup on her and told her to\nsit in this chair and don't move and smile. So, when the Germans came in, she was young,\nyou know. She didn't get up, she didn't blink, so they just let her be this time. What\nhappened to him, was when the Kovno Ghetto was liquidated, we all were taken to the\ntrain, and he walked out from the march, he removed his yellow sign, and apparently he\nhad friends, we knew he had friends, because he kept on dealing with them, but he\ndisappeared. We don't know if a Lithuanian saw him walking out and immediately\narrested him and some of his so called friends, but we never heard from him again. That\nwas the end of my brother.",
        "Q: Were there sort of regular arrests or beatings or brutalities that you had to notice on a\nregular basis?",
        "A: In the Ghetto?",
        "Q: Were there guards in the Ghetto?",
        "A: You know, I used to get up in the morning and go to work and then used to come back.\nHow much more brutal can it be what they did having to drag their mothers or fathers or\nchildren burning in front of you? I mean I didn't see it every day of my life. I don't think\nI'd be here. I'd be mad. I mean you can get hardened up to a point. They used to beat up\npeople. It became, they beat you if they didn't like your face, they used to slap you and\nhit you. They needed us because we were laborers, especially the young ones. And of the\nold ones, they just periodically got rid of. The only brutality which was cruel is out of the\nGhetto when we wound up in concentration camp.",
        "Q: When you just said that the children were burning, that was 1n the Ghetto?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you describe it?",
        "A: I don't know if I can describe it, but that's what my aunt said. I didn't see it. She said they\ndragged the kid away from her, a beautiful little girl, threw her literally into the truck.\nThey had a truck there, and they moved it away somehow, and then it started burning. I\ndon't know what they did. And then they just pulled it away. This was her description\nbecause she was beside herself. Or maybe they pulled it out of the Ghetto, and she saw\nthe flames, but it was in her presence she saw that.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the political organization of the Ghetto? I mean, how were\nthings run? Who was running it?",
        "A: No. I really wasn't --.",
        "Q: Did you know anybody who was in the underground?",
        "A: My brother-in-law.",
        "Q: But it was not something that you were involved 1n?",
        "A: Underground? No, I had a relative who wanted us to go to the underground right before\nthe Ghetto was liquidated, but my husband didn't want to. And we didn't go, lucky.\nApparently lucky, I don't know, whatever we did, it turned out we made it somehow.",
        "Q: Now you said after the children and old people were taken away which was I think\nMarch--?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That then you really knew you had to do something?",
        "A: That's right, but we didn't. We tried -- there was nothing we could do because the people\noutside were not willing to help. So, as I said, we were cornered. We couldn't do anything\nabout it. The underground -- there were all kinds of rumors going around. We just hoped\nthat the Russians were going to come back soon. I mean on the radios they kept on saying\nthe Germans are running for their lives, and they were already by then, so we were\nhoping they were just going to leave us alone while they were going to retreat. But they\ndecided to take us with them, and that is when the two of us decided maybe we should\nbuild a bunker for the two us, because the bunkers which some of the people built, were\nsophisticated bunkers which were under the ground. It took them quite a while to dig.\nWhen we came to ask if they would let us in, they said it was filled up. There 1s no more\nroom. So, we decided to do something on our own. So we decided to dig a hole for\nourselves because they kept on saying the Russians are at our doorstep. They are going to\nenter Lithuania any day. So, the two of us worked through the night, and we dug a nice\nhole in the yard, and we put a large pitcher of water and some crackers, and we made a\nseat for ourselves down there, and we covered up the hole with a green pillow to make\nsure it kind of blends in with the landscaping. And then the next day or two days later,\nthe Germans were rounding up the Jews to take them -- don't worry, wherever we take\nyou 1s going to be better than here. So, we got into our hole, and we covered it very\ngingerly. We put the pillow on top of it to make sure that some of the leaves and branches\ncould cover the pillow. We sat down, the two of us, and we figured we would last for a\ncouple of days. There was enough air and water. The next thing we heard were people\nwalking, making noise, Germans. They yelled, \"look here, look there, there must be\nsomebody here because there is a house and it looks like the door is open.\" And suddenly\nwe had a boot coming in. One of the Germans stepped their foot on the pillow, and they\nstarted screaming, \"come on out of there,\" and suddenly a rifle was put into the hole, and\nI came out absolutely muddy, dirty, and my husband came out absolutely muddy dirty,\nand luckily I have to say they were Austrians. Not that they are much -- not that I\nunderstand, I'm not sure, but one of them was an older man. He must have been 40, he\nsaid, \"how many more are there?\" I said, \"just the two of us.\" He became hysterical, it\nstruck him so funny. \"Why should you want to stay here and be dirty and filthy. Go get\nwashed and we'll take you to a nice place in Germany.\" That is how we were actually\nsaved, because when the Germans left, they completely destroyed the Ghetto by fire and\nby bombing it and by all kinds of things. So, the people who were in the sophisticated\nbunkers, they choked to death. We definitely wouldn't have made it.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: When you work outside of the Ghetto, you have an opportunity to bring in some more\nfood, because the food was limited in the Ghetto. So, therefore, one of us, when I didn't\nwant to work , | didn't have access to anything.",
        "Q: Do you remember there being any kind of qualitative change when the Ghetto became a\nconcentration camp? How that came about?",
        "A: Excuse me, the Ghetto did not become a concentration camp. The concentration camp\nwas in Germany.",
        "Q: I thought that Kovno they enclosed, and they called it an official concentration camp a\nlittle bit later on before the liquidation.",
        "A: Pardon, before what?",
        "Q: In November of '43?",
        "A: No, they called it an official concentration -- who called?",
        "Q: I don't know, the history books, the Germans.",
        "A: It was a Ghetto. We refer to concentration camp in Germany, but basically it was\ndifferent. Here we just lived in our homes. We had homes in Ghetto, despite of the fact\nthat they came around every so often to eliminate a number of population. But in\nconcentration camp, we were completely under their mercy. You lived in their quarters.\nYou got up in the morning, and you were given a little pail with some sort of a spoon,\nand you got a cup of water. So, it could be called concentration camp, I don't recall.",
        "Q: So, were there any other events that really strike you while you were still in the Ghetto?",
        "A: No, not really. This was the worst that could happen.",
        "Q: Towards the end, when they were trying to liquidate the Ghetto, I guess, what happened\nto you?",
        "A: Like I said, this is when we hid in the woods in our bunker, and they took us to where\neverybody was there. That is where I met my mother, and father and brother, because\nthey were already in that large area where they were going to take everybody to Germany\nor to Poland.",
        "Q: Where was this?",
        "A: This was in Ghetto. In Ghetto there was a large building which it, how should I call it --\nthey gathered everybody up there, and after they emptied out the Ghetto, they went from\nhome to home, told everybody to go. The streets were full of people, I mean the handful\nof people that were left. I don't know numbers. And we all went except for us, the two us.\nWe were the last, actually. Most of the people were gathered up already for the last two\ndays while we were busy trying to save ourselves. So, there was a large building and that\nis where they distributed old people in separate rooms, groups of them, and then took\nthem outside the Ghetto. And then my husband and I, the two of us, were brought to this\nplace. Lucky enough, I found my mother and father, and Ralph found his brother and\nsister-in-law. So, we all stuck together, and then the Germans -- it was like a parade --\nthey opened up the doors and said \"Now walk.\" And we walked out from the Ghetto to\ngo to the trains where they took us to Germany because the Russians were chasing them.",
        "Q: Did you take anything with you?",
        "A: Yes, that is what I wanted to say. Yes, you could take something with you, and I had my\ncoat which my father -- I had my coat with me which my father made for me, I mean\nfilled the lining up with mink skins. And we walked through the street, and as my brother\nwalked out, removed his sign, his yellow star, and walked out and disappeared. And\neventually we came to these trains, the cattle trains. And we got on the train, all of us, the\nwhole family, and they brought us to Stutthof.",
        "Q: Before we get to Stutthof, I want to understand a little bit what the train was like, how\nmany people were on it what that train ride was like?",
        "A: There were many people, like sardines. Everybody was pushed together. One woman was\nmad there. She was outrageous. And of course, everybody eliminated there. It was very\nvery bad. It was very bad. It was terrible. How can I describe it to you. It was hell. And I\nwas wearing my warm coat, wouldn't let go of it. And as we came to Stutthof, they told\nthe women to get out, and they said we don't need you. You'll meet up with your\nhusbands and fathers later on. So, my sister-in-law, the two of us got of the train, and I\nthink, I'm not sure if they had transportation -- I think they had open trucks where we\nwere piled in, and we were brought to Stutthof. And then we were told, of course, right\naway my coat was taken way, and whatever else I had, which was very little, I suppose,\nbecause I didn't have a chance to take anything with me. I held on to my mother, and then\nthey told us to disrobe. You know, they had all these tables and young Germans sitting\nbehind it. And they said to us, \"Okay, go into this large area and disrobe.\" I mean by\ndisrobe take everything off. So, here I am next to my mother, hundreds of women, and\nwe had to be totally naked coming in in front of a desk with a bunch of young hoodlums.\nSo, what do you think in a case like that. They are creatures from another planet. There\nwas no planet then, but creatures from hell. Why should I bother worrying about them,\nwhether they look at me. How demeaning can you even feel standing with your mother\nand relatives and families --my sister-in-law -- and here you're standing totally naked,\nand they look at you. So, I just stood there, and they just looked at us, and they told us to\ngo in the back to take showers, and they gave us the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and\nthis is how our ordeal started. This 1s concentration camp. Then they put us in those\nbunks which you have in the museum, it's exactly how the museum has it, in those bunks,\nand I don't know how long I was there, but it was awful. It was totally terrible, because\nmothers were taking the food of their children, not children, there were no small children.\nDaughters were eating up the food. I mean people were destroying each other. That was\nactually their idea. Whoever was weak and who could not overcome really were taking\nadvantage of their own kind. Anyway, I was holding on to my mother as long as I could,\nand then one day they told us to come out in one of those areas which is similar to\nfairground, except there was no fair, for them it must have been a fair, and they did the\nsame kind of system. We were walking, and I was holding onto my mother, and she\nwalked pretty well, and she looked pretty good, and they took her away from me. They\npushed me on one side, and they pulled my mother on the other side. I ran to my mother,\nand I was beat up pretty badly, and I was pushed away. That's the last I saw her. Then we\nwere put into open cars, trucks, my sister-in-law and myself, and we were taken to some\nsort of a --",
        "Q: I need you to say that sentence again.",
        "A: We were put into open trucks, always open trucks. This is why for the life of me I cannot\nunderstand how everybody around there didn't know what was happening. They always\nsaw us. The farmers around us, the people around us, they always saw it. And the\nGermans were showing off or whatever, and they were taking us to an area where they\ndivided us into groups. And there I was with my sister-in-law, and a very young woman\nabout my age, walked over to me and she said, \"Do you mind if I join you because\neverybody was taken away from me.\" I said sure, why don't you join us. And then about\nafter a half an hour or so, because we had to wait to be distributed wherever they were\ngoing to send us, two other woman came over, both of them actually were nurses, a little\nbit older. And they said,\" You look like three nice woman, do you think we can join your\ngroup so we can stick together.\" So, we spent the rest of our time together actually. So,\nthen they put us again in one of these open trucks, and took us to work in the fields, to\nbuild ditches for -- what do you call those things -- I can't think of the name at the\nmoment, but it will come to me. So what they did is they housed us in tents, in regular\ntents, as you see here. They housed about 50 women, and in the middle of the tent was a\nlittle stove, one of those wood burning stoves, and they gave us a space on straw which\nthis is -- so the five of us plopped down together in one corner, and we stuck together the\nfive of us.",
        "Q: Where were they from?",
        "A: All of them from Kaunas, and we really stuck together, really stuck it out.",
        "Q: Were most of the other prisoners from Lithuania?",
        "A: Lithuania, yes. This was -- you see we were the last ones to be taken out of eastern\nEurope, so basically Stutthof was the political concentration camp. So, probably it was\njust so late in the game that they didn't take us any other place. So there were some\ngentiles in Stutthof. So, we were taken there in one of the areas, which was kind of in the\nwoods, it was mostly in the woods, where we were digging ditches -- trenches, that 1s\nwhat it is, trenches. We dug very deep trenches, and that is really where the labor was\nhard, because they stood over you and made sure that you don't even take a breather.",
        "Q: And if you did?",
        "A: Oh, they hit you. They really hit you without any mercy.",
        "Q: Were you hit?",
        "A: I was never hit, because I worked. I told you I just decided at one time, especially when I\nwas standing there naked, that these are devils from some place, and I'm going to look at\nthem as such. So, this was my -- I brainwashed myself. I figured they are not going to\nbring me down to their level.",
        "Q: So you didn't stay in the camp of Stutthof that long?",
        "A: Exactly. Stutthof, I think they kept -- I was there I would say about three days,\napproximately. It wasn't long, or maybe a week. I mean time -- I cannot tell you time. It\nwas one thing I didn't think about. But it wasn't long, because I didn't work there. We\ndidn't work there, but the rumors were that they were going to sterilize us all. And we\nwere lucky to get out of there. Unfortunately, I couldn't get my mother out.",
        "Q: Were there any children there?",
        "A: No, but they wanted to sterilize us, because you know women, period. I mean, we didn't\nhave our period. Thank God there was something in heaven, somebody was watching\nover us. We didn't for two years, but the rumors were flying around that they were going\nto sterilize all the young women. So, when we finally got into the woods, got up every\nmorning and got our soup and went to work, and we dug those deep ditches, and then it\nwas winter. And it was cold, and I used to break up the ice when I went in. There was a\nbreak once in a while, and get into the ice and wash myself because the biggest killer\nalmost, and demoralizer, was the filth. The filth, the stench and the lice, and the five of us\ndecided we were going to try to eliminate it by hook or by crook, because the people\naround us were unbelievable. Especially older people, also many young ones that gave\nup. They just didn't care. That was the biggest destruction, the filth, and this 1s what we --\ntwo things we promised ourselves. We were going to keep our feet covered, and winter\nwas coming, and the snow and as soon as you got sick this was the end of you. They did\nnot tolerate anybody being sick. So, they watched how to kind of decrease the population\nthere. So, when somebody woke up sick, if you went to the infirmary, chances are you'd\nnever come back, or if you were too filthy. We decided we are going to keep clean, and\nwe did.",
        "Q: How?",
        "A: As I said, we broke up ice, got into the water and washed ourselves, and at night we used\nto dry our underwear on the pipe of the woodburning little thing. I think we were the only\nones who did that. And then, I was the brave one, I used to run out in the middle of the\nnight, when the soldiers were kind of resting or not expecting any kind of movement. I\nused to run out to -- if we were -- we were continuously being moved from one area to\nanother because we finished one to dig those trenches in another area, then we were\nmoved to another area. And you could see homes not too far away from us. I used to run\nout and go to the farmers. They used to give me some bread. At first I used to fill myself\nup with as much food as I possibly could, and then they used to give us loaves of bread,\nand I used to bring the bread to my four buddies.",
        "Q: You could just sneak out?",
        "A: You couldn't. It was a fence, but it was a tent. There was a large tent, a very primitive\nkind of a tent and around they had the very primitive kind of wires, which they were not\nconcerned about anybody going to run away. Where would you run, 50 women or\nwhatever.",
        "Q: And the guards were sleeping?",
        "A: It was -- they could have shot me, I'm sure, but as I said, I was a little bit of a daredevil I\nsuppose. I didn't do it too often, but I tried it quite a few times.",
        "Q: And the farmers were--?",
        "A: Yes. They give you a piece of bread and tell you get out of here. They were terrified you\nshouldn't stay long, that you shouldn't be caught--they shouldn't be caught, not I shouldn't\nbe caught. But they knew, they knew they were willing to give you bread and feed you. I\nnever had any problems. I stopped quite a number of them, maybe four.",
        "Q: They knew what was happening?",
        "A: Of course they knew what was happening. You had to be absolutely blind or live\nsomeplace, I don't know.",
        "Q: Who were your guards?",
        "A: Pardon?\nQ; Where were your guards from, what nationality?",
        "A: Oh my God, Germans. You never talked to them. You didn't even look them in the eye.\nYou look them in the eye you get beat up.",
        "Q: Did you have a like a block elder or somebody just in charge of your tent?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn't have that much --?",
        "A: No, no because we were mobile. They kept on moving us. We just kept our nose clean\nand worked, and that's about it. So the only time I was beat up was when I wanted my\nmother back. After that, I just figured I'm not going to mess around with them. I'm going\nto try to stay alive. And then the end came when they decided to take us on the \"death\nmarch.\" And they knew, rumors started flying around that the Germans are retreating.\nThe Russians are going to destroy them, so they decided to take us with them. To this\nday, I cannot understand why. I would really like to know what their -- they didn't have\nany reason for anything. They just did what they were told.",
        "Q: Did you know that's why they were moving you?",
        "A: Of course, absolutely we knew. And we started the \"death march\", it's called now. It\nwasn't called then, because we didn't even think about it. And they started taking us from\nvillage to village. We stopped in a bar at every village, and they kept on losing people on\nthe way, especially people who didn't have shoes. And I happened to have a good pair of\nshoes. Before, this was the most terrible experience of my life -- one of the most terrible\nexperiences of my life. Before we were taken on this death march, they delivered a truck\nwith shoes. Somehow, luckily some German threw me a pair of good shoes. I don't know\nif he meant me or he meant somebody else, but I grabbed it, and I had a good pair of\nshoes. And I could see people that we lose are the ones who freeze their feet. It was cold.\nIt was winter. It was in March or February, February I think, the end of February. And\nwe kept on losing them. We came to a barn. In the morning they used to wake us up, and\nwe walked again. They stopped in villages, the names that I happen to have, and one day\none of the women who were part of my group said to me, \"Why don't I try to go out and\nsee,\" -- it was after the third village -- \"to see if I can get some bread for us. You always\nare the one who has been supplying us with some extra food. Let me try, except my shoes\nare very bad. Why don't you lend me your shoes and I'll leave you mine,\" which were\nsmaller. She had a smaller foot that I did. She left. She never came back. And I got up in\nthe morning when I had to leave, and I looked at her shoes and I said, I'm not going. And\nmy friends say yes you are. And I said I'm not going to die like a dog on the street. Let\nthem shoot me here. I'm just not going because I knew this was going to be the end. You\ndon't walk out barefoot. Now, I just want to tell you about human nature. In the one of\nthe tents where we were, there was a woman who was a loud mouth and a very disliked\nperson, but she always seemed to be able to get more than anybody else. One of those,\nyou know, and everybody kind of stayed away from her because she yelled at everybody.\nShe was rude, she was common -- I don't even want to call her that. She was a very\ndisliked individual. And I'm standing there with my three buddies, and I said to them I'm\nnot going. She appears from no where, and she said to me, \"I have a pair of shoes for you.\nI have an extra pair for myself.\" She handed me a pair of shoes. She saved my life. I don't\nknow what happened to her. I've been looking for her for many years. I never spoke to\nher. I never exchanged a word with her through the months that we worked together. But\nshe saved my life. I put on my shoes, and I kept on walking. Eventually we wound up in\nthe , which was the last village of this \"death march.\" By then they knew, the\nGermans knew that they had lost the war and that the Russians were on their tail. They\nput us in a barn and that was really -- that was real hell because everybody was dying. I\nwouldn't be surprised that 85 percent of the people died there because the diarrhea and\nthe stench and the frozen bodies were unbelievable. Every place you sat next to a corpse.\nAnd one of my friends I went to school with, actually she was not in the same area I was,\nthis was kind of a -- they decided to gather all the rest of the area of these people in\n. It was like the last step, and she was in a different camp. She came over to\nme and she said, \"Henny you are still walking around. Would you help me bury my\nmother?\" And I helped her carry out her mother, because the first thing they did was\nmake us dig deep ditches because they knew. And I dropped the mother on a pile of\nbones. And I went back -- I went back to this barn and surrounded by death, except my\ntwo friends. One escaped, two escaped on the way. The one with the shoes and the other\none kind of also, she escaped. So two of them left, so the three of us, we're still holding\non to each other and suddenly we hear voices. They closed the barn doors, it was like\n10:00. I remember because we were liberated, it as an hour later. It was 10:00. They\nclosed all the doors of the barn. They poured gasoline around, all around, and they were\ngoing to burn the whole thing. The next thing, it was a matter of I don't know -- the next\nthing, we hear bagging on our barn doors and Russian spoken. And they opened up the\ndoors, and of course, the ones who could, walked out. I was one of them. And my friend,\nmy two friends, immediately ran out, and I don't know, not too many ran out because as I\nsaid, I wouldn't be surprised if 15, 20 percent of people made it, were able to walk out. I\nmean maybe they carried them out.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: I don't remember exactly but all I know is that when we were brought in there quite a\nnumber of people, but when we left, there were only a handful who could walk out. So, I\nran out. A Russian grabbed me, and he handed me a rifle and he had our guards, these\nyoung shnooks, I think two or three of them or four of them, I think four of them, few,\nbecause some of them run away, lined up along the wall. And he said, shoot them. He\nhanded me, it was clicked, the whole thing, he said go ahead. He said do it. I held the gun\nin my hand, and I thought to myself, that's ridiculous. Should I become like them? And I\nthrew away the rifle, and the Russian he yelled to me in Russian , Stupid.",
        "Q: Did other people shoot at the Germans?",
        "A: No, they didn't. I'm telling you, I was the first one to run out because I walked luckily. So\nthen they took my two friends, I think one of them could hardly walk, so we dragged her,\nand they went to the village. And the village, at that time, was deserted, because all the\nGermans ran away. And you could get in any house you wanted to. So, we found\nourselves a house. The three of us settled in this house. And the first thing I did, I went to\nmilk a cow. There was a cow in the back, and the cow kicked me, lucky, and she kicked\nthe whole milk out. And if that wouldn't have happened, we would have died, because\nthat was the first poison to drink milk or butter or anything of that sort. So, we opened up\nthe cabinets, and it was Germany there, it was under German occupation, this area. The\ncabinet, there was food there called , the things you put in jars for the winter\nwith the rubber seal, and they had all kinds of fruits, so we started with cook fruits, a\nlittle bit. And the next thing my two friends came down with typhoid. I didn't -- I wasn't\nvery sick, but I was also sick, so I took care of them. And then the Russians came. The\nRussians were in the Army, and they needed women, and they were going from house to\nhouse, disregarding anything. That time we decided we weren't going to let anybody in.",
        "Q: How did you know this was happening?",
        "A: You know, that's a very interesting question. You know everything. You really do. It's an\ninstinct. It's an instinct you find out. If your life depends on it or if it's something, you\njust find out. Probably somebody knocked on the door and said don't let in the Russians,\neven if they say they are Jews and they want to help you, because they are like animals.\nSo, finally somebody came to the door and kept on banging and banging and started\nspeaking Yiddish, \"please let me in. I've been on the front for so many years. I'm a mess.\"\nI said, \"we're all sick with typhoid. There is no place to sleep.\" They did not have any\nplace to sleep. They didn't have any place because the houses, some of the houses, were\ntaken up by the survivors which weren't many. And some of them, the Germans still were\nthere. I don't know, but they said they were exhausted and they had to sleep. And he kept\non speaking Yiddish and I decided I'll take a chance. So, we let him in, and he happened\nto be a very nice guy. And he laid down on the floor and slept. He was totally exhausted,\nand he just wanted to help us and see what he could do for us, and in the morning he left.\nAnd then I took sick, and then the three of us kind of made it, and we decided to keep on\ngoing. Now, I don't know -- the Russians, that's right. After we got well, they said they\nwere going to take us to . And from there they were going to send us\nwherever we want to go. Since we are from Lithuania, they'll send us back to Lithuania.\nAnd I knew that I wasn't going back to Lithuania ever. So, we came to , and\nwe worked there all of us. We actually watched the Germans load ships and boats, and\nwe were actually the drivers. We were guards.",
        "Q: For the Russians?",
        "A: For the Russians, yes. And then I decided, I heard rumors again, they were going to send\nus -- we were five women, they were going to send us back to Russia, not Lithuania.\nThey'll send us to Russia someplace on one of those farms, and I decided I'm not going\nthere. So, I took whatever I had, next to nothing, I threw it out of the window. There was\na guard watching the area where the buildings where we were actually housed, Russian\nstayed there and people who worked for them. And they had a guard and a gate, and you\njust had to announce before you go. There was a curfew there. You couldn't leave just\nwhenever you felt like it. But my window faced the outside, so I threw whatever a small\nbundle out, probably some underwear and whatever, and I just went to the guard, and I\ntold him I'm going to the movies, and he said okay, go ahead. So, I went. I picked up my\nlittle bundle, and I ran to the train. And trains were going anyplace, no matter where you\nwanted to go. And I really didn't know where I was going to go. I said I wanted to go\nwest. And I got on the train, and there were two underground soldiers sitting, and they\nsaid they come from Lodz, and they heard that in Lodz there 1s an organization, an\norganization was established to find out who survived. It's like what do you call those\ncenters, where everybody sends their family -- but it's a center for all survivors so they\ncan find people whoever tells them who they were looking for. There was no mail. I\nmean it was really only word by mouth, really. I said okay, I'll go to Lodz. So we arrived\nin Lodz at 6:00 in the morning, and they wanted to take me to a place to sleep over, and I\ndidn't particularly care for that. So, when I got out of the train, I decided to make it fast,\nand they yelled, \"we fed you with chocolate.\" They gave me chocolate, that's true. And I\nwent away, and I got on a bus at 6:00 in the morning. My Polish was kind of rusty, so I\nasked the driver where is the Jewish center, and he said, \"I'll take you there.\" So, I arrived\nthere, and I walked in there and that was around 7:00, 8:00, and I registered, and I told\nthem I want to work for you and they said okay, go behind there. So, that is where I\nwound up. I was bald then because we were all shaven. And I was wearing a turban\nusually. And then one afternoon when I got through working, I went upstairs in the\ncommon area where there are a couple of dozen women are sleeping on the floor in some\nkind of makeshift sleeping bags, and I removed my turban. I needed some fresh air, and I\nwalked out in the hall to go over to a friend of mine, and there was my husband. So, he\neven met me without my turban.",
        "Q: You must have been stunned.",
        "A: Yes, that's putting it mildly because I really didn't know what happened to him, and I was\ngoing to Israel. I figured what the heck, I speak the language. I don't have anybody any\nother place in the world so I might as well go to Israel. And they would have sent me\nawfully quickly because many Lithuania young people in '37 and '38, and I figured I\nwould try a nota , but I will try it, and then I will take it from\nthere. And then my Prince Charming appeared, and 1t was fun. And then we came to this\ncountry. We decided we were going to start our lives all over again. It's no use living in\nthe past because we had nothing to do with it. The world had gone mad so what should\nwe do. It could have happened to anybody. So we're not going to let that ruin us and\nbring up our children with complexes. They probably have other complexes, but certainly\nwe didn't spoon feed them about our experiences and about the world that everybody is\nterrible, because there are some decent people in the world. It was just a terrible\nexperience.",
        "Q: When you do think about this, because even though you want to live in the present, you\nhave to think about this?",
        "A: Well, sure I do.",
        "Q: Are there certain memories that haunt you?",
        "A: Except that time when I knew I was going to die without my shoes. That's my worst\nexperience in my life -- that's not the worst, but for personal -- I have never felt as close\nto death as this moment, never. Because, as I said I always think that things are going to\nturn out all right. Everybody calls me Polyanna, but I just hope it eventually will turn out\nall right.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a strange question. How did you feel about being Jewish throughout this?",
        "A: I never thought of it. I never thought specifically about being Jewish, why it happened to\nme you mean?",
        "Q: Well, I'm wondering did you wish you weren't Jewish? Did you feel more Jewish than\never?",
        "A: No, no I didn't feel more Jewish than ever. I'm going to tell you something. I don't if it\nhas something to do with this. We have a son, and a daughter and seven grandchildren.\nAnd our son married a catholic young woman from France. And my friends were telling\nme -- it was a long time ago 21 years ago -- friends were telling me my god it's terrible.\nHow can you take it? How can you live with it? I went to my rabbi and had a long\nconversation, and I said, you know intellectually I can understand it. She's a nice woman.\nThat's what he wants, what the heck, who am I am? Emotionally I don't think I can take it\nbut I'll probably take it. And as the years went on and people asked me I said, you know\nthe more we have on our side, the better off we are. So, that is my philosophy in life. The\nmore people think of Jews as equal people in this world, the more chance we have of not\nhaving something like that happen again. Because he was a madman and all his nation\nwent mad. I mean these people went mad and the ones -- there are a lot of nice ones there\nI'm sure. I'm not going to condemn the whole German population, but the majority of\nthem said they didn't know about it. How could they not know about it, and how couldn't\nthey foresee it, but I'm not a philosopher to try and figure out. But it's terrible that people\nin power can motivate young people to become so unfeeling, so beastly without any\nremorse, and they can really turn them into terrible human beings, so it shows you. So, I\ncan't tell you if I felt bad being Jewish or good being Jewish. I didn't think about 1t much.",
        "Q: Anything else you want to add?",
        "A: I'm glad you are here because I was going to write a book, and I know I'd never get to it.\nSo, I had very mixed feelings when you said you were going to come here. I knew I'd\nhave to go through that ordeal, but at least our family and all our grandchildren and great\ngrandchildren and so on and so forth, if they want to know something about us --\nalthough they all asked through the years, the little ones and the big ones, but we always\nanswered them what they asked. We never gave them more information. But now at least\nthey can go to the museum and press a button and listen to their grandparents if they want\nto. If they don't want to, just let them be nice human beings. That's all we want them to\nbe, and I thank you for coming.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "A: Well, my maiden name was Fletcher, and I was born in ;",
        "A: My name was Henny Fletcher, and I was born in Kovno, Lithuania, in 1924.",
        "A: November 25, 1924. Well, are you already recording me? Yes? I had a younger brother,\nwho was three years younger than I was, and I suppose we could be considered an upper\nmiddle class family, because we had a lovely apartment and my brother and I went to a\nprivate school which was a rarity. Basically, I was not lacking in anything. I was pretty\nhappy go lucky young kid, and we were both growing up like average two children. We\nused to go to the country in the summer time, and in the winter time, I used to spend my\ndays after school on the ice skating rink in Macobie (ph) because I like gymnastics. And\nmy brother was a nuisance, like all the other little brothers who were always in the way. I\ncannot tell you that I had any difficulty growing up.",
        "A: My father was a businessman. He was actually in manufacturing. He didn't, he people\nwho did it for him, educational toys, like chess, dominoes and all the other ones and also\nchildren's games. The highlight of my life was in December, my father used to deliver all\nthe -- have the orders delivered to the stores on our main street, which is the equivalent of\nPark Avenue in Kovno, which , and all these stores were Gentile stores\nmostly, and I was the one who used to deliver all these packaged orders. And I had\nfriends of mine who were looking forward every year in December to accompany me\nbecause my father used to hire a sled with two horses and a driver, not a driver actually,\nwhatever you call him, and he used to put all the boxes in the sled and put my friend, the\none which I picked, and me in the seat cover with a heavy fur cover, and then we used to\nstop near every store. I used to walk out. He used to deliver the box. And I used to say I\nam Fletcher's daughter in Lithuania, and they used to give me the money. It was the\nhighlight of me and my friends period usually before Christmas time. I had an\nexceptional father, really, because he had tremendous confidence in me. He just thought\nat the age of 10 or 11 that I could do anything. And I remember when I was 11 years old,\nhe called me into his room, and he opened up the desk drawer, on the right side, second\ndrawer, and he showed me a bank book and there was money in there, written down how\nmuch money. And I said to him, \"what's that for?\" He said, \"that's for you, for your\ndowry.\" And I said to him, \"dowry, you're not going to pay anybody to marry me.\" I was\nso furious then. As I said, he instilled in me tremendous confidence, self confidence, and\nI think that helped me a lot during the war and after the war because he was a great\noptimist. He was a very funny man. He always had interesting jokes and interesting\nstories. He also designed calendars -- in Lithuania -- I don't know Lithuania-- but every\nsingle day you tore off a page. I think they have it here, too, I'm not sure. And on the\nback of the page of each day there was a joke, and my father was the one who wrote all\nthe jokes on the other side of each day. So, I grew up in a household with almost like a\nfunny man and he always made life very happy and amusing.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I had a wonderful mother. She was the opposite, very quiet, very refined lady\nwho always looked for me to help out, but I was never around because I was busy, as I\nsaid, having fun. But she had help, but she was a lovely lady, unassuming and very gentle\nand very kind and I loved her very much. She was a very pretty lady. I remember on high\nholidays she used to get dressed up always in a grey wool suit with a silver fox fur for not\na collar, but it was called a shawl. And she was blond, and every year she used to go to\nthe women who used to make hats and the hat was always open on top so her blond hair\nwould show and an large, large brim. And whenever she used to walk in the synagog for\nthe high holidays, people looked at her. She was tall and a very nice lady.",
        "A: No. Well of course we were kosher in the house. I wouldn't say we were ultra religious,\nbut we were kosher at home, and we celebrated the high holidays and Hanukkah and\nPassover and traditional, I would call it. Then, of course, when the Russians came into\nLithuania, we were kind of on pins and needles, because my father was a businessman.\nHe was afraid they were going to send us to Siberia. So, he started planning on how we\nshould get out of Lithuania. It wasn't easy, actually, for people who are more or less\nestablished to just throw away everything and pick up the family and leave. That was in\n1939, and at that time, we had relatives in Germany, and one time they sent us a letter\nasking us to help them, because they had this store. They were store keepers and one day\nthe Germans came in -- that was written in the letter -- the Germans came in, took away\nthe head of the family from the store and told the wife, he's going to be back in a few\ndays. We just want to interrogate him. The next day, two days later, they came back with\na little box, which in Lithuania peppercorns came in little boxes, and they came back and\nhanded her the box, put it on the counter and said, \"this is your husband.\" So, this was the\nletter we received in '39. And of course, my parents tried to help them to leave, and they\ndid arrive in Kovno, but is didn't sound real. It just didn't sound that people could do that\nto other people. So, my mother definitely felt that something was wrong with her, but my\nfather kind of believed it because there were quite a number of Polish Jews who kept on\nrunning away at that time from Poland. So, he started somehow plotting things out how\nto get out. So, the first thing he did, which he wasn't silly, but he went to to\nsee his family because he came from Vilna. I'm just digressing because I just wanted to\nshow you what a great man he was in a way. He wasn't actually, he wasn't demonstrative,\nbut he was exceptionally supportive of me. I don't know, but he really was. Before the\nRussians came in, I had a beautiful coat made for me. It was grey wool, fur collar, a\ntrench coat with a belt, very sharp. So, my father took the coat and said he was going to\nsee his family in Vilna, and he came back and the lining of the coat was removed and\nbehind the lining was all mink -- filled in with mink. He felt that in case something 1s\ngoing to happen to him, I should have something to fall back on, to sell the coat or sell\nthe mink for my mother and my brother and myself. That is the kind of family I grew up.\nI really and truly feel personally that I cannot, how should I say it, I could not let this four\nyears, or actually three years, actually horrible three years, ruin my life, ruin me for the\nrest of my life. It was a period where actually the world went mad, and I happened to be\ncaught in between. It could have happened to anybody who was there. That to destroy the\nrest of my life and to feed my children with experiences of madmen after the war and live\nin the past, I couldn't do that, because my upbringing was great.",
        "A: Yes, I had no difficulties.",
        "A: Yes. There was this school we went to, they had all kind of functions. It was a very good\nschool. And then of course in the winter time we had the ice skating rinks with the music,\nand we used to go outside and play and dance and do all these wild things, which were\nwild then. Then I belonged to Macabe, which is an organization, which is a sport\norganization. I used to spend my days there. I was the ping pong champion. And in the\nsummer we went to the country where I used to hike. I really, maybe I never encountered\nany problems. I was always exposed to Jewish people, Jewish school, except for the\npeople who were dealing with my father, who were exceptionally nice, too, because\napparently they needed his product.",
        "A: I really didn't, but it turned out worse with the Germans, eventually.",
        "A: No, no. Not only did it never occur me, but even when I was in concentration camp, I\nalways expected to survive. And I really attributed it to my father. I'm serious, because in\nretrospect, I mean I thought about it before you came. He really instilled in me a\ntremendous amount of self assurance and confidence, and if you just do your thing, you'll\nmake it if you want it badly enough.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: You mean to leave Lithuania?",
        "A: Well, the first thing that changed was the Russians had a theory that they had to relocate\nthe people. Never to leave the same people in the same area. So, what they did, the first\nthing they did was to move me from my school to another school where I didn't know\nanybody. I did know some, but -- and the people from the other school were moved to my\nschool. So, they kind of mixed the whole thing up. And, they also, of course introduced\nall Russian history and Russian, and we were fed with all the Russian propaganda. I\nwouldn't say -- the only problem as far as I recall is that we were fearful that any day\nthey'll come and just take us to Siberia because everybody around us, whoever was in\nbusiness, that's where they wound up. The truck used to come, just like the Germans\nactually. They had the same system. Without warning, they used to knock at your door\nand say, \"Come, take whatever you can just take with you.\" Put you on a truck, put you\non a train, and send you to Siberia. So, that was our only fear at that time.",
        "A: Well, they knew, they knew that's what the Russians are doing. They did have some\ninclination of what they were doing. The people, especially who are in business, who are\nemploying people. So, that was the only fear which I recall my father had. But,\notherwise, and as I said, I got used to being in the new school, and I kept on doing my\nown thing.",
        "A: I don't really recall, because we were not that religious that it affected us. Probably the\npeople who were religious it affected them. But I don't recall going to Temple that year\nfor all the high holidays. That's something that is kind of murky in my mind.",
        "A: Yes, I do, very much so. It was 1941, June 21, 1941. That was a day that I was supposed\nto go to my school, my original school to pick up my diploma because I had graduated\nfrom high school. I had a pair of silk stockings, which I kept for that special occasion, to\nput on a pair of silk stockings. I walked to school, which was quite a distance, and I\npicked up my diploma. It was all rolled up with a ribbon, and I walked home, and as I\npassed where the President of Lithuania lived, suddenly something fell out from an\nairplane, because they bombed the President's quarters. I fell on the sidewalk. I got up. I\nwasn't really concerned about the bomb more than that I tore my stockings. I came home,\nand we knew something was going to happen because we really -- in spite of the fact that\nwe did not want to believe that the Germans are going to come into Lithuania, and we\nhoped that it would just pass us by, we knew that they are there and we had no choice at\nthat time. We were already caught between the devil and the .",
        "A: It was chaotic. It was very, very chaotic. It's very difficult to describe the chaos. People\nreally didn't know what to do, because they were trapped. We were really just trapped.\nWe couldn't do anything. We didn't have weapons. We didn't have anything. We didn't\nhave anybody on our side. It wasn't only the Germans that were against us, it was actually\nthe Lithuanians started before the Germans started. So, they started looting and\nscreaming and yelling and beating us up. So, we didn't know which way to turn.",
        "A: Oh, all around us, all around us, yes. We kept our door locked, and we were lucky that\nthey must have got enough from the people around so they didn't manage to break down\nour door. They were terrible, unbelievable. It was such like, like I said, I never had any\ncontact with them before, but they turned like animals. It was just neighbors, people who\nyou dealt with. They suddenly -- it was almost like they waited for it, like hungry dogs\nand so it was rough. It was really rough. You know, I read a book by an author by the\nname of Bothenheimer (ph). He's a Jew. I'm just telling you a little story about it. I belong\nto a study group, and in the book it described about a bunch of Jews who believed they\nwere being taken by the Germans to a hotel and that eventually they would be staying\nthere until after the war. I was the only survivor. The rest of the people in the group were\nAmericans. And after reading the book the discussion was going on, how stupid could\nyou be. Couldn't you just stand up against the Germans? Couldn't you just stand up\nagainst the Lithuanians? There were so many and there were only three or four soldiers\naround you. And I was absolutely furious, because it wasn't a matter that we were weak,\nor that we were like sheep. We had no choice. How can you just protect yourself against\na bunch of mad dogs. You just can't do that. I mean people did it, and they were\nimmediately killed in front of you. So you just hoped against hopes that you will make it\nwithout making any waves.",
        "A: Not really, not really. Just trying to figure out what's going to be next, and we were at\nhome most of the time. We wouldn't dare walk out of the house until they came around\nwith those loud speakers directing us what to do. But we packed. We packed mostly\nsilver and mostly valuable things because, you know, in spite of the fact that we hadn't\nexperienced things like that since almost 1924, for I'd say almost 20 years or so, or less\nthan that, we lived a relative normal life. Really, a normal life, but when something\nhappens to you you kind of know it's the survival of the fittest. You kind of know what to\ndo. And you start thinking, you don't need a pillow, you don't need extra clothes, you\nneed something that you can trade eventually. So, we took the silver and some of the\njewelry, which my mother had and every upper middle class family had something,\nbecause there was no stainless steel and there was no other kind of this stuff which is sold\nhere now, so whatever you had was kind of silver or gold. It was not synthetic. And we\nknew that the farmers outside in the country will be glad to acquire it, to exchange. Not\nthat we ever experienced it before, but like I said, it's something that you just know.",
        "A: No, no I found out later on. Like I said, we were just lucky.",
        "A: No, no. We did not live -- we lived in Kovno. Actually we lived behind the Post Office.\nThere was the front of the Post Office and behind was the interior where they had\nbuildings. We lived in one of the apartment buildings behind the Post Office. So, maybe\nthat's why, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe they just didn't want to destroy the Post\nOffice. They thought maybe the Post Office not too many Jews live. I don't know, but we\nwere not bothered. We just waited to hear what the next step would be.",
        "A: Yes. Then we were told that we had to go to the Ghetto because they were going to have\na separate place, a Ghetto, for the Jews. All they kept on yelling was and we\ntook whatever we could. Now, I don't remember how we got there. I totally forget. I\nmean I remember so many details, but this is one thing that I just do not remember how\nwe got there. I know we didn't walk. It was quite a distance, and I know that we had quite\na lot of stuff by the time we came to the Ghetto, so maybe Father arranged -- I can't really\n-- it's blank. All I know is that we wound up in a small apartment, which was called at\nthat time the Small Ghetto and which was actually this is where most of the Jews were\nbrought in that particular part of the town. And then after a short period of time, they\nstarted coming in and asking for silver and whatever you have, all your valuables, the\nones who brought there, and I remember my parents handing over a box of something\nwith stuff. They saved some of the other ones and then after that there was the big\nwhich was called, they decided to shrink, that was their method to shrink up\nthe area, and we were told to come out on the field, four in a row. Actually eight in a row.\nWe started out, and my best friend and her brother and her father and mother were in the\nsame row with the four of us, and they were the other four. And they said, everybody\neight in a row and just walk. And the Germans, young, absolutely young faces, must be\n18 or 19, inconceivable how you can motivate young people to be so cruel. They just\nwalked and they separated in half, four and four, and they send my friend and her family\non one side and my father and mother and brother on the other side. We didn't know what\nhappened. It turned out that her side was the bad side, and these people from that\nparticular side never came back. They were taken and they were killed. Now, all I can\ncontribute it to is luck. She certainly -- I wasn't certainly better than she was and her\nfamily. We were both the same people and so, I'm here probably because I was just\nlucky. So, when they shrunk it, when they eliminated almost half of the population, we\nhad to move to another area in the Ghetto.",
        "A: This was only 1941. It was quite early.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because at the same time they also called out, they asked for 500 people who\nare, I mean, personalties, who speak German, who are educated, who are so on and so\nforth. They had names and these people who were actually dealing with Germany for\nyears, my father almost went because he represented a Germany company too in 1932,\nand who were professional people. They all went, hoping that they would be able to do\nsomething to negotiate with the Germans or influence them. They were called out, and\nthey were killed. This was known as the 500, the top, the cream really of the Jewish\npopulation. So, that was all in the same period of time, and they were trying somehow, in\nretrospect that's the only way I can understand, to kind of shrink the population.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Yes. My uncle actually was one of them. He was taken away, and his wife and a child\nlived with us in the same apartment.",
        "A: Well, we had a kitchen, a bedroom and a dining room. My brother and my mother and\nmy father and my aunt, who's husband was taken away with the first 500, and her child\n, who was five years old. My father worked for the guild it was\ncalled, and I went in the morning to the area where they set up people to go to work, and\nI used to get up in the morning. My mother used to stay home, and my brother was\nyounger, so he also stayed home for a short period of time with her. I used to get up and\ngo out to, what do you call it? It was a large area where everybody got together near the\ngate, and there there were leaders. The Germans needed people, and it was like groups\nthat they took them outside of the Ghetto to do some labor. I was lucky enough to fall\ninto the group where my husband was heading that particular group.",
        "A: No, of course not. I was standing there, actually I was standing there 1n the group, and he\nhad a group of men, and he said he needed a secretary, and he asked me to join him. So, I\nwas lucky. So, I was working in his group. What I was doing at that time, I wasn't doing\nsecretarial work. I was working at an airport at that time. They were building the airport,\nand we had to carry wood and drag things and so on and so forth. But, it was not too\ndifficult because eventually I helped him to other things.",
        "A: Well, the Germans, they were kind of decent, and they said if you will accomplish your,\nwhat do you call it, if you'll accomplish what you're supposed to do, your quota, you will\nbe able to get some extra flour from the farmers around. So, that is what everybody\nworked very hard. Whether you do or you don't, you don't get anything, but here you are\ntold what you will be getting. We certainly were very conscientious. So, we got flour,\nand what I had to do, I had to divide and kind of weigh the flour and divide the portions\nto every single person. But, I was so generous that a few times there was none left for me.\nSo, my husband told me, at that time he wasn't my husband, he said don't be so generous.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, I did. But this is once in a while that they wanted to be kind they would\nsay, yes, but I was working.",
        "A: That's the only one. I was waiting most of the time, and then, of course, I was taken to the\nfarm, a farm. The Germans needed, for what reason I don't know, a group of young\nwomen to take on a farm to apparently pick vegetables or plant vegetables on the farm.\nThey dragged me out of this group, and we found ourselves on this farm. I got up in the\nmorning and walked out on the farm and a German came galloping on a horse, a nice big\nhorse with a saddle, and he looked at all of us. We were about 18, 20 women\napproximately and he picked me and he said to me \"Have you ever ridden a horse?\" I\nsaid no. He said, \"Good, it's time to learn.\" So he got off the horse, and he removed the\nsaddle, and he made me get up on the horse, and he must have talked to the horse or did\nsomething to him because the horse started running like a madman, and I thought to\nmyself, you're not going to lose me off that horse, and I made it. Then I finally came\ndown, he said, \"Now you learn, now you can pick vegetables.\" So, I was there for a\ncouple of days, and then I was lucky enough, because I don't think they came back.",
        "A: It was fun for them. I mean, can you imagine a young woman going on a bare back horse\nwho has never ridden a horse, and a wild one. You know what it means to holding onto\nthe horse, not to fall off and break your neck, because that was what he was probably\nhoping. Who knows, they were mad. They were creatures from hell. They were\nabsolutely mad. I don't think they looked at us as humans and that was exactly what I\ndecided at one time. They didn't look at us as humans. I never looked at them as humans,\nand I'll just try plain and simple to survive because you couldn't look them in the eye. I\nknow a young woman looked them in the eye. They slapped her to death. They couldn't\ntouch us, thank goodness, because they were told they would be poisoned. Otherwise\nthey would have raped every single one of us. We were 18 year old kids. That's what they\ndid. They did all kind of things for recreation.",
        "A: Well, life went on when it was quiet, kind of normal in a way. We met, we kissed, we\ndrank, we had fun when we had the opportunity. The young ones, we really tried to live\nas normal a life as you could. You're talking about people who are 18 or 19 years old. We\nhave no responsibilities, we have no children. We have no family. Now, my mother had a\nstroke. I mean she just, as a matter of fact, her brother was killed, and then they had the\nchildren here, and they made my aunt take her child to be killed. She saw her child being\nkilled, being put on a car, on a truck and I think -- I don't know, I heard gasoline. I don't\nknow. When my aunt came back, she was mad for a short period of time, and my mother\nhad a stroke. But she survived, and she was pretty good and that's thanks to my brother.\nHe really came through. He was three years younger than I was, but he was a very smart\ndetermined young boy. First of all, he was tall. He was blond and didn't look Jewish at all\nand that was in his favor because every time he used to go to work, he used to just leave\nthe place and go to Lithuanians, whom he knew, and traded some silver or whatever my\nmother gave him. My mother used to give him a piece of silverware at a time so they\nwould wait for the next piece. He really supported the family. When my mother had her\nstroke, I was married then already, so when my mother had the stroke, he was really there\nfor her, and he brought her everything, and he brought her to the point where she could\nwalk and talk. So, you ask me how was life, if you asked me or all my friends, it's\ndifferent. Because you know youth, we'll overcome. You cannot help it, so we'll do it. It's\ncareless, I don't think 1t was an adventure because it was probably miserable because this\none is gone and that one is gone. The whole thing was kind of scary, and the guys also,\nthey are afraid they were going to die tomorrow, let's have fun. For young people it was\nbad, but not as bad as for my parents.",
        "A: No, no. No cultural activities, no political activities, you just try to live from day to day\nand work, and if you have a chance to have some fun, get married because you were\nsafer. I think we got married after that incident on the farm because I wouldn't say it was\nsafer to be married. I mean, I liked my husband and he liked me and he asked my father\nfor my hand and my father said by all means if anybody will take care of you, he's the\none who will, and my father was absolutely right. So, we got married. Not that it\nmattered much eventually, because they separated us eventually. But everybody felt that\nif you were married you were kind of safer.",
        "A: No. We got married on a Saturday, must have been because we worked on Friday, and I\nmoved in -- actually I couldn't move in right away with his family. His family consisted\nof his mother, a brother and a sister-in-law, and they lived in one room. His mother was\nin the corner. I remember an iron bed. She was a semi-invalid. She had arthritis, a very\nbad case. She was 1n bed most of the time. My husband used to sleep on a cot, and then\nmy brother-in-law and sister-in-law slept in the corner on a bed. When we decided to get\nmarried, my husband decided to build a second bunk, above my brother-in-law's bed. He\nbuilt a very good one. He even cut in the wood a step for me to get up and down. So, it\ntook him a while to build it. So, eventually I moved in with my husband in the upper\ndeck, and he built a little shelf so I could bring my dowry with me, which my mother\ngave me before I left the house. She gave me about a pound of hard sugar, which was\nvery valuable, more so than diamonds. I don't know how she kept it or where she kept it,\nand I brought my dowry up there on the second shelf.",
        "A: When?",
        "A: Actually first we moved -- it wasn't the Small Ghetto, it was where everybody was. I\ndon't know if it was called the Small Ghetto. Eventually they eliminated one and maybe\nthe second one was called the Small Ghetto. Are you talking before the liquidation?",
        "A: I don't think so. There was no bridge.",
        "A: Yes, right, you're right, there were two parts. I must have been in the small one\noriginally.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: What happened is, they called everybody out in the field and there were eight in a row --",
        "A: That's okay.",
        "A: No. I heard something about it, but I don't remember. This is when they liquidated the\nsmall one, and they separated my friend and her family from us, and we wound up in the\nother part.",
        "A: Later that month?",
        "A: Do you mean when they took children and old people?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Because, you know, I remember it vaguely, but I really can't contribute much to it. I do\nknow many people disappeared.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: Oh, yes, I noticed it, but I don't remember. I cannot give you any details about it.",
        "A: Not then. After the old people and children action, this was when the people realized that\nsomething has to be done.",
        "A: This was the most horrendous time. It must have been in 19-- we got married in 1943, in\nNovember. It must have been in the beginning of 1944. It was -- I don't know the exact\ndate, which is immaterial really. I wasn't working at that time. I was off that day, and my\nbrother-in-law, my husband's brother was also home. So, the two of us were home with\nmy husband's mother. Suddenly the loud speaker started screaming all the people and\nchildren out. And my mother-in-law, as I said was a semi-invalid, a wonderful woman,\nan exceptional lady. She used to teach me how to make gourmet dishes. She was a\nfabulous cook. She was a pharmacist by education, a wonderful lady. We didn't know\nwhat to do. We knew she could not walk, so I looked at my brother-in-law, and he looked\nat me, and I said, let's hide her someplace. But before we had a chance to do anything,\nthey just broke into the room. As I told you, we were in one room, all five us, and they\nsaid out to her from bed and I stood in front of her and I said, \"She can't walk.\" So they\ngave me a Slap. She can't walk, so carry her. So I said to Miska, my brother-in-law, let's\nput something on her. She was wearing a nightgown. Anyway, they wouldn't let us do\nanything. They made my brother-in-law grab her by the shoulders, and I had to grab her\nby the foot. I tried to pull down her dress-- it would break my husband's heart-- her\nnightgown, and we carried her out and the street was a nightmare because all you could\nsee were young people carrying these old people like animals. And we carried her to the\nplace where the busses were stationed, and he told my brother-in-law -- they are so\nyoung, it is unbelievable, the milk was still on their lips -- to stay, and I'm the one who\nshould carry her out. Now, she was a frail woman. I must have picked her up, and I\nwalked up on the bus, and I figured that's the end of me too. There was no seat, so I had\nto put her in the aisle, and I covered her up. They looked around to find a seat for me. So,\nthey pushed me down the stairs and said, \"you get out of there.\" That was my memory of\nthis particular day. And I think this 1s when they took them to the Ninth Fort.",
        "A: He wasn't so little anymore. You grow up awfully quick. He must have been 15. He was\nan organizer. He kind of supported the family. Immediately after I got off the bus and I\nstarted running, because I was hysterical, because I was sure that my mother was gone\nalso. So, I ran back to my mother's home, and there's my mother sitting in the chair with\nmakeup. I don't know where by brother found makeup. She was 39 years old, my mother,\nor 40. My father was completely beside himself. My father got lost in himself rather, so\nmy brother who is the one who fixed up her hair and put makeup on her and told her to\nsit in this chair and don't move and smile. So, when the Germans came in, she was young,\nyou know. She didn't get up, she didn't blink, so they just let her be this time. What\nhappened to him, was when the Kovno Ghetto was liquidated, we all were taken to the\ntrain, and he walked out from the march, he removed his yellow sign, and apparently he\nhad friends, we knew he had friends, because he kept on dealing with them, but he\ndisappeared. We don't know if a Lithuanian saw him walking out and immediately\narrested him and some of his so called friends, but we never heard from him again. That\nwas the end of my brother.",
        "A: In the Ghetto?",
        "A: You know, I used to get up in the morning and go to work and then used to come back.\nHow much more brutal can it be what they did having to drag their mothers or fathers or\nchildren burning in front of you? I mean I didn't see it every day of my life. I don't think\nI'd be here. I'd be mad. I mean you can get hardened up to a point. They used to beat up\npeople. It became, they beat you if they didn't like your face, they used to slap you and\nhit you. They needed us because we were laborers, especially the young ones. And of the\nold ones, they just periodically got rid of. The only brutality which was cruel is out of the\nGhetto when we wound up in concentration camp.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don't know if I can describe it, but that's what my aunt said. I didn't see it. She said they\ndragged the kid away from her, a beautiful little girl, threw her literally into the truck.\nThey had a truck there, and they moved it away somehow, and then it started burning. I\ndon't know what they did. And then they just pulled it away. This was her description\nbecause she was beside herself. Or maybe they pulled it out of the Ghetto, and she saw\nthe flames, but it was in her presence she saw that.",
        "A: No. I really wasn't --.",
        "A: My brother-in-law.",
        "A: Underground? No, I had a relative who wanted us to go to the underground right before\nthe Ghetto was liquidated, but my husband didn't want to. And we didn't go, lucky.\nApparently lucky, I don't know, whatever we did, it turned out we made it somehow.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That's right, but we didn't. We tried -- there was nothing we could do because the people\noutside were not willing to help. So, as I said, we were cornered. We couldn't do anything\nabout it. The underground -- there were all kinds of rumors going around. We just hoped\nthat the Russians were going to come back soon. I mean on the radios they kept on saying\nthe Germans are running for their lives, and they were already by then, so we were\nhoping they were just going to leave us alone while they were going to retreat. But they\ndecided to take us with them, and that is when the two of us decided maybe we should\nbuild a bunker for the two us, because the bunkers which some of the people built, were\nsophisticated bunkers which were under the ground. It took them quite a while to dig.\nWhen we came to ask if they would let us in, they said it was filled up. There 1s no more\nroom. So, we decided to do something on our own. So we decided to dig a hole for\nourselves because they kept on saying the Russians are at our doorstep. They are going to\nenter Lithuania any day. So, the two of us worked through the night, and we dug a nice\nhole in the yard, and we put a large pitcher of water and some crackers, and we made a\nseat for ourselves down there, and we covered up the hole with a green pillow to make\nsure it kind of blends in with the landscaping. And then the next day or two days later,\nthe Germans were rounding up the Jews to take them -- don't worry, wherever we take\nyou 1s going to be better than here. So, we got into our hole, and we covered it very\ngingerly. We put the pillow on top of it to make sure that some of the leaves and branches\ncould cover the pillow. We sat down, the two of us, and we figured we would last for a\ncouple of days. There was enough air and water. The next thing we heard were people\nwalking, making noise, Germans. They yelled, \"look here, look there, there must be\nsomebody here because there is a house and it looks like the door is open.\" And suddenly\nwe had a boot coming in. One of the Germans stepped their foot on the pillow, and they\nstarted screaming, \"come on out of there,\" and suddenly a rifle was put into the hole, and\nI came out absolutely muddy, dirty, and my husband came out absolutely muddy dirty,\nand luckily I have to say they were Austrians. Not that they are much -- not that I\nunderstand, I'm not sure, but one of them was an older man. He must have been 40, he\nsaid, \"how many more are there?\" I said, \"just the two of us.\" He became hysterical, it\nstruck him so funny. \"Why should you want to stay here and be dirty and filthy. Go get\nwashed and we'll take you to a nice place in Germany.\" That is how we were actually\nsaved, because when the Germans left, they completely destroyed the Ghetto by fire and\nby bombing it and by all kinds of things. So, the people who were in the sophisticated\nbunkers, they choked to death. We definitely wouldn't have made it.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: When you work outside of the Ghetto, you have an opportunity to bring in some more\nfood, because the food was limited in the Ghetto. So, therefore, one of us, when I didn't\nwant to work , | didn't have access to anything.",
        "A: Excuse me, the Ghetto did not become a concentration camp. The concentration camp\nwas in Germany.",
        "A: Pardon, before what?",
        "A: No, they called it an official concentration -- who called?",
        "A: It was a Ghetto. We refer to concentration camp in Germany, but basically it was\ndifferent. Here we just lived in our homes. We had homes in Ghetto, despite of the fact\nthat they came around every so often to eliminate a number of population. But in\nconcentration camp, we were completely under their mercy. You lived in their quarters.\nYou got up in the morning, and you were given a little pail with some sort of a spoon,\nand you got a cup of water. So, it could be called concentration camp, I don't recall.",
        "A: No, not really. This was the worst that could happen.",
        "A: Like I said, this is when we hid in the woods in our bunker, and they took us to where\neverybody was there. That is where I met my mother, and father and brother, because\nthey were already in that large area where they were going to take everybody to Germany\nor to Poland.",
        "A: This was in Ghetto. In Ghetto there was a large building which it, how should I call it --\nthey gathered everybody up there, and after they emptied out the Ghetto, they went from\nhome to home, told everybody to go. The streets were full of people, I mean the handful\nof people that were left. I don't know numbers. And we all went except for us, the two us.\nWe were the last, actually. Most of the people were gathered up already for the last two\ndays while we were busy trying to save ourselves. So, there was a large building and that\nis where they distributed old people in separate rooms, groups of them, and then took\nthem outside the Ghetto. And then my husband and I, the two of us, were brought to this\nplace. Lucky enough, I found my mother and father, and Ralph found his brother and\nsister-in-law. So, we all stuck together, and then the Germans -- it was like a parade --\nthey opened up the doors and said \"Now walk.\" And we walked out from the Ghetto to\ngo to the trains where they took us to Germany because the Russians were chasing them.",
        "A: Yes, that is what I wanted to say. Yes, you could take something with you, and I had my\ncoat which my father -- I had my coat with me which my father made for me, I mean\nfilled the lining up with mink skins. And we walked through the street, and as my brother\nwalked out, removed his sign, his yellow star, and walked out and disappeared. And\neventually we came to these trains, the cattle trains. And we got on the train, all of us, the\nwhole family, and they brought us to Stutthof.",
        "A: There were many people, like sardines. Everybody was pushed together. One woman was\nmad there. She was outrageous. And of course, everybody eliminated there. It was very\nvery bad. It was very bad. It was terrible. How can I describe it to you. It was hell. And I\nwas wearing my warm coat, wouldn't let go of it. And as we came to Stutthof, they told\nthe women to get out, and they said we don't need you. You'll meet up with your\nhusbands and fathers later on. So, my sister-in-law, the two of us got of the train, and I\nthink, I'm not sure if they had transportation -- I think they had open trucks where we\nwere piled in, and we were brought to Stutthof. And then we were told, of course, right\naway my coat was taken way, and whatever else I had, which was very little, I suppose,\nbecause I didn't have a chance to take anything with me. I held on to my mother, and then\nthey told us to disrobe. You know, they had all these tables and young Germans sitting\nbehind it. And they said to us, \"Okay, go into this large area and disrobe.\" I mean by\ndisrobe take everything off. So, here I am next to my mother, hundreds of women, and\nwe had to be totally naked coming in in front of a desk with a bunch of young hoodlums.\nSo, what do you think in a case like that. They are creatures from another planet. There\nwas no planet then, but creatures from hell. Why should I bother worrying about them,\nwhether they look at me. How demeaning can you even feel standing with your mother\nand relatives and families --my sister-in-law -- and here you're standing totally naked,\nand they look at you. So, I just stood there, and they just looked at us, and they told us to\ngo in the back to take showers, and they gave us the uniforms, the striped uniforms, and\nthis is how our ordeal started. This 1s concentration camp. Then they put us in those\nbunks which you have in the museum, it's exactly how the museum has it, in those bunks,\nand I don't know how long I was there, but it was awful. It was totally terrible, because\nmothers were taking the food of their children, not children, there were no small children.\nDaughters were eating up the food. I mean people were destroying each other. That was\nactually their idea. Whoever was weak and who could not overcome really were taking\nadvantage of their own kind. Anyway, I was holding on to my mother as long as I could,\nand then one day they told us to come out in one of those areas which is similar to\nfairground, except there was no fair, for them it must have been a fair, and they did the\nsame kind of system. We were walking, and I was holding onto my mother, and she\nwalked pretty well, and she looked pretty good, and they took her away from me. They\npushed me on one side, and they pulled my mother on the other side. I ran to my mother,\nand I was beat up pretty badly, and I was pushed away. That's the last I saw her. Then we\nwere put into open cars, trucks, my sister-in-law and myself, and we were taken to some\nsort of a --",
        "A: We were put into open trucks, always open trucks. This is why for the life of me I cannot\nunderstand how everybody around there didn't know what was happening. They always\nsaw us. The farmers around us, the people around us, they always saw it. And the\nGermans were showing off or whatever, and they were taking us to an area where they\ndivided us into groups. And there I was with my sister-in-law, and a very young woman\nabout my age, walked over to me and she said, \"Do you mind if I join you because\neverybody was taken away from me.\" I said sure, why don't you join us. And then about\nafter a half an hour or so, because we had to wait to be distributed wherever they were\ngoing to send us, two other woman came over, both of them actually were nurses, a little\nbit older. And they said,\" You look like three nice woman, do you think we can join your\ngroup so we can stick together.\" So, we spent the rest of our time together actually. So,\nthen they put us again in one of these open trucks, and took us to work in the fields, to\nbuild ditches for -- what do you call those things -- I can't think of the name at the\nmoment, but it will come to me. So what they did is they housed us in tents, in regular\ntents, as you see here. They housed about 50 women, and in the middle of the tent was a\nlittle stove, one of those wood burning stoves, and they gave us a space on straw which\nthis is -- so the five of us plopped down together in one corner, and we stuck together the\nfive of us.",
        "A: All of them from Kaunas, and we really stuck together, really stuck it out.",
        "A: Lithuania, yes. This was -- you see we were the last ones to be taken out of eastern\nEurope, so basically Stutthof was the political concentration camp. So, probably it was\njust so late in the game that they didn't take us any other place. So there were some\ngentiles in Stutthof. So, we were taken there in one of the areas, which was kind of in the\nwoods, it was mostly in the woods, where we were digging ditches -- trenches, that 1s\nwhat it is, trenches. We dug very deep trenches, and that is really where the labor was\nhard, because they stood over you and made sure that you don't even take a breather.",
        "A: Oh, they hit you. They really hit you without any mercy.",
        "A: I was never hit, because I worked. I told you I just decided at one time, especially when I\nwas standing there naked, that these are devils from some place, and I'm going to look at\nthem as such. So, this was my -- I brainwashed myself. I figured they are not going to\nbring me down to their level.",
        "A: Exactly. Stutthof, I think they kept -- I was there I would say about three days,\napproximately. It wasn't long, or maybe a week. I mean time -- I cannot tell you time. It\nwas one thing I didn't think about. But it wasn't long, because I didn't work there. We\ndidn't work there, but the rumors were that they were going to sterilize us all. And we\nwere lucky to get out of there. Unfortunately, I couldn't get my mother out.",
        "A: No, but they wanted to sterilize us, because you know women, period. I mean, we didn't\nhave our period. Thank God there was something in heaven, somebody was watching\nover us. We didn't for two years, but the rumors were flying around that they were going\nto sterilize all the young women. So, when we finally got into the woods, got up every\nmorning and got our soup and went to work, and we dug those deep ditches, and then it\nwas winter. And it was cold, and I used to break up the ice when I went in. There was a\nbreak once in a while, and get into the ice and wash myself because the biggest killer\nalmost, and demoralizer, was the filth. The filth, the stench and the lice, and the five of us\ndecided we were going to try to eliminate it by hook or by crook, because the people\naround us were unbelievable. Especially older people, also many young ones that gave\nup. They just didn't care. That was the biggest destruction, the filth, and this 1s what we --\ntwo things we promised ourselves. We were going to keep our feet covered, and winter\nwas coming, and the snow and as soon as you got sick this was the end of you. They did\nnot tolerate anybody being sick. So, they watched how to kind of decrease the population\nthere. So, when somebody woke up sick, if you went to the infirmary, chances are you'd\nnever come back, or if you were too filthy. We decided we are going to keep clean, and\nwe did.",
        "A: As I said, we broke up ice, got into the water and washed ourselves, and at night we used\nto dry our underwear on the pipe of the woodburning little thing. I think we were the only\nones who did that. And then, I was the brave one, I used to run out in the middle of the\nnight, when the soldiers were kind of resting or not expecting any kind of movement. I\nused to run out to -- if we were -- we were continuously being moved from one area to\nanother because we finished one to dig those trenches in another area, then we were\nmoved to another area. And you could see homes not too far away from us. I used to run\nout and go to the farmers. They used to give me some bread. At first I used to fill myself\nup with as much food as I possibly could, and then they used to give us loaves of bread,\nand I used to bring the bread to my four buddies.",
        "A: You couldn't. It was a fence, but it was a tent. There was a large tent, a very primitive\nkind of a tent and around they had the very primitive kind of wires, which they were not\nconcerned about anybody going to run away. Where would you run, 50 women or\nwhatever.",
        "A: It was -- they could have shot me, I'm sure, but as I said, I was a little bit of a daredevil I\nsuppose. I didn't do it too often, but I tried it quite a few times.",
        "A: Yes. They give you a piece of bread and tell you get out of here. They were terrified you\nshouldn't stay long, that you shouldn't be caught--they shouldn't be caught, not I shouldn't\nbe caught. But they knew, they knew they were willing to give you bread and feed you. I\nnever had any problems. I stopped quite a number of them, maybe four.",
        "A: Of course they knew what was happening. You had to be absolutely blind or live\nsomeplace, I don't know.",
        "A: Pardon?\nQ; Where were your guards from, what nationality?",
        "A: Oh my God, Germans. You never talked to them. You didn't even look them in the eye.\nYou look them in the eye you get beat up.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no because we were mobile. They kept on moving us. We just kept our nose clean\nand worked, and that's about it. So the only time I was beat up was when I wanted my\nmother back. After that, I just figured I'm not going to mess around with them. I'm going\nto try to stay alive. And then the end came when they decided to take us on the \"death\nmarch.\" And they knew, rumors started flying around that the Germans are retreating.\nThe Russians are going to destroy them, so they decided to take us with them. To this\nday, I cannot understand why. I would really like to know what their -- they didn't have\nany reason for anything. They just did what they were told.",
        "A: Of course, absolutely we knew. And we started the \"death march\", it's called now. It\nwasn't called then, because we didn't even think about it. And they started taking us from\nvillage to village. We stopped in a bar at every village, and they kept on losing people on\nthe way, especially people who didn't have shoes. And I happened to have a good pair of\nshoes. Before, this was the most terrible experience of my life -- one of the most terrible\nexperiences of my life. Before we were taken on this death march, they delivered a truck\nwith shoes. Somehow, luckily some German threw me a pair of good shoes. I don't know\nif he meant me or he meant somebody else, but I grabbed it, and I had a good pair of\nshoes. And I could see people that we lose are the ones who freeze their feet. It was cold.\nIt was winter. It was in March or February, February I think, the end of February. And\nwe kept on losing them. We came to a barn. In the morning they used to wake us up, and\nwe walked again. They stopped in villages, the names that I happen to have, and one day\none of the women who were part of my group said to me, \"Why don't I try to go out and\nsee,\" -- it was after the third village -- \"to see if I can get some bread for us. You always\nare the one who has been supplying us with some extra food. Let me try, except my shoes\nare very bad. Why don't you lend me your shoes and I'll leave you mine,\" which were\nsmaller. She had a smaller foot that I did. She left. She never came back. And I got up in\nthe morning when I had to leave, and I looked at her shoes and I said, I'm not going. And\nmy friends say yes you are. And I said I'm not going to die like a dog on the street. Let\nthem shoot me here. I'm just not going because I knew this was going to be the end. You\ndon't walk out barefoot. Now, I just want to tell you about human nature. In the one of\nthe tents where we were, there was a woman who was a loud mouth and a very disliked\nperson, but she always seemed to be able to get more than anybody else. One of those,\nyou know, and everybody kind of stayed away from her because she yelled at everybody.\nShe was rude, she was common -- I don't even want to call her that. She was a very\ndisliked individual. And I'm standing there with my three buddies, and I said to them I'm\nnot going. She appears from no where, and she said to me, \"I have a pair of shoes for you.\nI have an extra pair for myself.\" She handed me a pair of shoes. She saved my life. I don't\nknow what happened to her. I've been looking for her for many years. I never spoke to\nher. I never exchanged a word with her through the months that we worked together. But\nshe saved my life. I put on my shoes, and I kept on walking. Eventually we wound up in\nthe , which was the last village of this \"death march.\" By then they knew, the\nGermans knew that they had lost the war and that the Russians were on their tail. They\nput us in a barn and that was really -- that was real hell because everybody was dying. I\nwouldn't be surprised that 85 percent of the people died there because the diarrhea and\nthe stench and the frozen bodies were unbelievable. Every place you sat next to a corpse.\nAnd one of my friends I went to school with, actually she was not in the same area I was,\nthis was kind of a -- they decided to gather all the rest of the area of these people in\n. It was like the last step, and she was in a different camp. She came over to\nme and she said, \"Henny you are still walking around. Would you help me bury my\nmother?\" And I helped her carry out her mother, because the first thing they did was\nmake us dig deep ditches because they knew. And I dropped the mother on a pile of\nbones. And I went back -- I went back to this barn and surrounded by death, except my\ntwo friends. One escaped, two escaped on the way. The one with the shoes and the other\none kind of also, she escaped. So two of them left, so the three of us, we're still holding\non to each other and suddenly we hear voices. They closed the barn doors, it was like\n10:00. I remember because we were liberated, it as an hour later. It was 10:00. They\nclosed all the doors of the barn. They poured gasoline around, all around, and they were\ngoing to burn the whole thing. The next thing, it was a matter of I don't know -- the next\nthing, we hear bagging on our barn doors and Russian spoken. And they opened up the\ndoors, and of course, the ones who could, walked out. I was one of them. And my friend,\nmy two friends, immediately ran out, and I don't know, not too many ran out because as I\nsaid, I wouldn't be surprised if 15, 20 percent of people made it, were able to walk out. I\nmean maybe they carried them out.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: I don't remember exactly but all I know is that when we were brought in there quite a\nnumber of people, but when we left, there were only a handful who could walk out. So, I\nran out. A Russian grabbed me, and he handed me a rifle and he had our guards, these\nyoung shnooks, I think two or three of them or four of them, I think four of them, few,\nbecause some of them run away, lined up along the wall. And he said, shoot them. He\nhanded me, it was clicked, the whole thing, he said go ahead. He said do it. I held the gun\nin my hand, and I thought to myself, that's ridiculous. Should I become like them? And I\nthrew away the rifle, and the Russian he yelled to me in Russian , Stupid.",
        "A: No, they didn't. I'm telling you, I was the first one to run out because I walked luckily. So\nthen they took my two friends, I think one of them could hardly walk, so we dragged her,\nand they went to the village. And the village, at that time, was deserted, because all the\nGermans ran away. And you could get in any house you wanted to. So, we found\nourselves a house. The three of us settled in this house. And the first thing I did, I went to\nmilk a cow. There was a cow in the back, and the cow kicked me, lucky, and she kicked\nthe whole milk out. And if that wouldn't have happened, we would have died, because\nthat was the first poison to drink milk or butter or anything of that sort. So, we opened up\nthe cabinets, and it was Germany there, it was under German occupation, this area. The\ncabinet, there was food there called , the things you put in jars for the winter\nwith the rubber seal, and they had all kinds of fruits, so we started with cook fruits, a\nlittle bit. And the next thing my two friends came down with typhoid. I didn't -- I wasn't\nvery sick, but I was also sick, so I took care of them. And then the Russians came. The\nRussians were in the Army, and they needed women, and they were going from house to\nhouse, disregarding anything. That time we decided we weren't going to let anybody in.",
        "A: You know, that's a very interesting question. You know everything. You really do. It's an\ninstinct. It's an instinct you find out. If your life depends on it or if it's something, you\njust find out. Probably somebody knocked on the door and said don't let in the Russians,\neven if they say they are Jews and they want to help you, because they are like animals.\nSo, finally somebody came to the door and kept on banging and banging and started\nspeaking Yiddish, \"please let me in. I've been on the front for so many years. I'm a mess.\"\nI said, \"we're all sick with typhoid. There is no place to sleep.\" They did not have any\nplace to sleep. They didn't have any place because the houses, some of the houses, were\ntaken up by the survivors which weren't many. And some of them, the Germans still were\nthere. I don't know, but they said they were exhausted and they had to sleep. And he kept\non speaking Yiddish and I decided I'll take a chance. So, we let him in, and he happened\nto be a very nice guy. And he laid down on the floor and slept. He was totally exhausted,\nand he just wanted to help us and see what he could do for us, and in the morning he left.\nAnd then I took sick, and then the three of us kind of made it, and we decided to keep on\ngoing. Now, I don't know -- the Russians, that's right. After we got well, they said they\nwere going to take us to . And from there they were going to send us\nwherever we want to go. Since we are from Lithuania, they'll send us back to Lithuania.\nAnd I knew that I wasn't going back to Lithuania ever. So, we came to , and\nwe worked there all of us. We actually watched the Germans load ships and boats, and\nwe were actually the drivers. We were guards.",
        "A: For the Russians, yes. And then I decided, I heard rumors again, they were going to send\nus -- we were five women, they were going to send us back to Russia, not Lithuania.\nThey'll send us to Russia someplace on one of those farms, and I decided I'm not going\nthere. So, I took whatever I had, next to nothing, I threw it out of the window. There was\na guard watching the area where the buildings where we were actually housed, Russian\nstayed there and people who worked for them. And they had a guard and a gate, and you\njust had to announce before you go. There was a curfew there. You couldn't leave just\nwhenever you felt like it. But my window faced the outside, so I threw whatever a small\nbundle out, probably some underwear and whatever, and I just went to the guard, and I\ntold him I'm going to the movies, and he said okay, go ahead. So, I went. I picked up my\nlittle bundle, and I ran to the train. And trains were going anyplace, no matter where you\nwanted to go. And I really didn't know where I was going to go. I said I wanted to go\nwest. And I got on the train, and there were two underground soldiers sitting, and they\nsaid they come from Lodz, and they heard that in Lodz there 1s an organization, an\norganization was established to find out who survived. It's like what do you call those\ncenters, where everybody sends their family -- but it's a center for all survivors so they\ncan find people whoever tells them who they were looking for. There was no mail. I\nmean it was really only word by mouth, really. I said okay, I'll go to Lodz. So we arrived\nin Lodz at 6:00 in the morning, and they wanted to take me to a place to sleep over, and I\ndidn't particularly care for that. So, when I got out of the train, I decided to make it fast,\nand they yelled, \"we fed you with chocolate.\" They gave me chocolate, that's true. And I\nwent away, and I got on a bus at 6:00 in the morning. My Polish was kind of rusty, so I\nasked the driver where is the Jewish center, and he said, \"I'll take you there.\" So, I arrived\nthere, and I walked in there and that was around 7:00, 8:00, and I registered, and I told\nthem I want to work for you and they said okay, go behind there. So, that is where I\nwound up. I was bald then because we were all shaven. And I was wearing a turban\nusually. And then one afternoon when I got through working, I went upstairs in the\ncommon area where there are a couple of dozen women are sleeping on the floor in some\nkind of makeshift sleeping bags, and I removed my turban. I needed some fresh air, and I\nwalked out in the hall to go over to a friend of mine, and there was my husband. So, he\neven met me without my turban.",
        "A: Yes, that's putting it mildly because I really didn't know what happened to him, and I was\ngoing to Israel. I figured what the heck, I speak the language. I don't have anybody any\nother place in the world so I might as well go to Israel. And they would have sent me\nawfully quickly because many Lithuania young people in '37 and '38, and I figured I\nwould try a nota , but I will try it, and then I will take it from\nthere. And then my Prince Charming appeared, and 1t was fun. And then we came to this\ncountry. We decided we were going to start our lives all over again. It's no use living in\nthe past because we had nothing to do with it. The world had gone mad so what should\nwe do. It could have happened to anybody. So we're not going to let that ruin us and\nbring up our children with complexes. They probably have other complexes, but certainly\nwe didn't spoon feed them about our experiences and about the world that everybody is\nterrible, because there are some decent people in the world. It was just a terrible\nexperience.",
        "A: Well, sure I do.",
        "A: Except that time when I knew I was going to die without my shoes. That's my worst\nexperience in my life -- that's not the worst, but for personal -- I have never felt as close\nto death as this moment, never. Because, as I said I always think that things are going to\nturn out all right. Everybody calls me Polyanna, but I just hope it eventually will turn out\nall right.",
        "A: I never thought of it. I never thought specifically about being Jewish, why it happened to\nme you mean?",
        "A: No, no I didn't feel more Jewish than ever. I'm going to tell you something. I don't if it\nhas something to do with this. We have a son, and a daughter and seven grandchildren.\nAnd our son married a catholic young woman from France. And my friends were telling\nme -- it was a long time ago 21 years ago -- friends were telling me my god it's terrible.\nHow can you take it? How can you live with it? I went to my rabbi and had a long\nconversation, and I said, you know intellectually I can understand it. She's a nice woman.\nThat's what he wants, what the heck, who am I am? Emotionally I don't think I can take it\nbut I'll probably take it. And as the years went on and people asked me I said, you know\nthe more we have on our side, the better off we are. So, that is my philosophy in life. The\nmore people think of Jews as equal people in this world, the more chance we have of not\nhaving something like that happen again. Because he was a madman and all his nation\nwent mad. I mean these people went mad and the ones -- there are a lot of nice ones there\nI'm sure. I'm not going to condemn the whole German population, but the majority of\nthem said they didn't know about it. How could they not know about it, and how couldn't\nthey foresee it, but I'm not a philosopher to try and figure out. But it's terrible that people\nin power can motivate young people to become so unfeeling, so beastly without any\nremorse, and they can really turn them into terrible human beings, so it shows you. So, I\ncan't tell you if I felt bad being Jewish or good being Jewish. I didn't think about 1t much.",
        "A: I'm glad you are here because I was going to write a book, and I know I'd never get to it.\nSo, I had very mixed feelings when you said you were going to come here. I knew I'd\nhave to go through that ordeal, but at least our family and all our grandchildren and great\ngrandchildren and so on and so forth, if they want to know something about us --\nalthough they all asked through the years, the little ones and the big ones, but we always\nanswered them what they asked. We never gave them more information. But now at least\nthey can go to the museum and press a button and listen to their grandparents if they want\nto. If they don't want to, just let them be nice human beings. That's all we want them to\nbe, and I thank you for coming.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n"
