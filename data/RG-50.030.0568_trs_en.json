        "A: They spoke Polish. They spoke Polish and Yiddish, and \u2014 and also some\nRussian, because at that \u2014 one point, the Russians were there, and that during the\nfirst World War, the Germans were in \u2014 were in Warsaw. My mother\u2019s father died\nwhen she was two years old, in 1902. Her father was one of three brothers, the\nAbramski(ph) brothers, Hainoch(ph), Mendel, and Pesach(ph). Hainoch(ph) and\nMendel were the Florsheim(ph) of Poland. And there was still a \u2014 a record of\nthem, who\u2019s who in business in 1939 in Europe. And they were listed, and they\nwere a corporation. They brought their machinery in Manchester and in Germany.\nThey had tanneries, and they had factories. They also sol \u2014 sold out of that \u2014 one of\nthe brothers, Mendel Abramski\u2019s(ph) house, my mother worked there, because\nwhen her father died, he was a contractor for them.",
        "Q: What was their company name?",
        "A: Of \u2014 oh, Abramski(ph) shoes.",
        "Q: Abramski(ph) shoes",
        "A: [indecipherable] in Polish",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, Abramski(ph) shoes and \u2014 and \u2014 and they were well known, and they had\nstores in \u2014 in Warsaw and in the provinces, and they also had people that went onto\nthe road to sell shoes. And my mother, as I said, sold for them until she got married.\nAnd \u2014 and she\u2019d met my father on one of the trips, that he came \u2014 he went twice a\nyear to see his mother and his siblings. And \u2014 and \u2014 and I guess they fell in love,\nand my mother\u2019s papers weren\u2019t ready to go to Germany, so they got married in\nDanzig, Gdansk. And then she \u2014 her two uncles escorted her there, and they had\njust a religious ceremony, they did not have the civilian one, so the uncles just\nwhisked her back to Warsaw. And so their marriage wasn\u2019t consummated until she\njoined him about six weeks later in Berlin. And that was 1924, and \u2014 August 1924,\nand in October of \u201925, I was born. And I was a very difficult birth and \u2014 and I had\nasthma. And mom \u2014 I th\u2014I wasn\u2019t sleeping and my mother would carry me around\nall night. And my father felt very badly for her. So when, in 1926, there was a well\nknown plastic surgeon, a Dr. Josef(ph), who had practiced medicine during the first\nWorld War, and some of his instruments were used throughout Europe. And she\nwent there to have a \u2014 to have a \u2014 a nose job, because when she was a little girl,\nduring the summer, and she was the youngest of nine, and she ran into a tree. And\nshe had a prominent nose, I have my mother\u2019s nose, but she broke the nose, she had\na bump on her \u2014 o-on her nose, so he said she should go there and have her nose\ndone. And my mother would tell how she \u2014 when she went in there, there were\nyoung men with big ears, and they came out with little shells. And there women and\nmen who went in with huge noses, and they came out with little s-snub noses. And\nwomen went in with humongous breasts, and came \u2014 they went in with brassieres\nand \u2014 and it was perfect. And my mother said her surgery was not a success. She\nremembered swallowing blood while they threw chocolate into her mouth. And\nprofessor Jusef(ph) wanted her to come back to do it over, and she said no, she\nwould live with that. So, I have my mother\u2019s nose, and then in \u2014 when we were\nalready in New York, I was 16 years old, and I wanted to have my nose done and\nmy mother would say [speaks German], the nose isn\u2019t that important. And then\nwhen I got married and I suggested this to my husband, I said, I married you not\nbecause of your nose, and you don\u2019t have to \u2014 so, here I am. I have \u2014 my son has\nmy nose.",

And he thought very highly of German\neducation, and that\u2019s how come when I started school in 1931 \u2014 of course, I went to\na German school, a Volksschule, and in 19 \u2014 my brother was born in 1930, and in\n1936, he started the Volksschule. And \u2014 and by 1936, I entered the first Bismarck\nLyzeum, which was in Berlin, it\u2019s right near where the tennis courts were.",
        "Q: You know what\u2019s in \u2014 sounds interesting \u2014 I\u2019m sorry for interrupting at this\npoint, but it sounds like you went from being a Polish Jewish family, to a German\nJewish family.",
        "A: Not really.",

Th-Those eastern\nEuropean Jews were different, and most of the [indecipherable] east European\nJews lived in east Berlin, Grenadierstrasse, etcetera, etcetera.

        "Q: Who did you socialize with then?",
        "A: Really, no one. I would a \u2014 my brother was lucky, he started school in 36 and \u2014\nand my mother was called to school that he wasn\u2019t doing well. And then they \u2014 and\nwhen you went to school in \u2014 in Germany, the teachers came to you, you didn\u2019t go\n\u2014 you didn't change classes, and yo \u2014 the teacher ca \u2014 you remained except for gym\nand \u2014 and lunch.",

He would take a \u2014 take his\nice cream money, and bought himself an [indecipherable]. This was to support \u2014\nthis was to support the National Socialist \u2014",

And that\u2019s where they ended\n\u2014 ended up having, even though they destroyed the synagogue, but that\u2019s where \u2014\nwhere they met, Judisch gemeinde would meet there. And Peter went to that\nschool.",
        "Q: The Jewish community, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, until \u2014 until we left, \u201939.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite \u2014 I mean, th-there are lots of questions as you\u2019re talking that \u2014 that\ncome to mind, and I will come to some of them later. But right now, one of those\nthat \u2014 that strikes me 1s, that school was allowed \u2014 a Jewish school was allowed to\nexist, and \u2014 from 736 to \u00b039.",
        "A: Oh, they \u2014 they existed until I \u2014 even in \u201939, now they \u2014 they threw me out of the\nDrusen(ph) Bismarck Lyzeum after Kristallnacht. I went \u2014 I went to that \u2014 I was\nthe only Jewish child in that school, and I was permitted to be there because I was\nconsidered a Polish citizen. You see, I was never a German ci \u2014 my brother and I,\nwe were always Polish citizens. We\u2019re on my parents\u2019 passports. I\u2019m on my\nmother\u2019s, and \u2014 and my brother is on my father\u2019s. And that\u2019s why our \u2014 the visas to\ncome to the United States were in here.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, I see.",
        "A: Ah \u2014 but \u2014 and you can see that my parents went regularly back \u2014 each one went\ntwice a year home to see their families. And \u2014 and so that presented no problem, but\nthat was fortunate we came out as a unit. We went \u2014 we were on the Polish quota\nnumbers, we \u2014 Peter and I were not on the German quota.",
        "Q: So you weren't considered Jews, as much as Poles?",
        "A: We were considered Poles, we were considered Polish. However, interestingly\nenough, Kristallnacht, thi \u2014 that \u2014 that happened at night, a-and \u2014 and then they\nsaid in the morning, the rumor started that they were coming to the apartments. So\nmy parents \u2014",
        "Q: Did it affect the store, the business?",
        "A: Oh, the store di \u2014 of course. And how did they know? How did they know that it\nwas a Jewish shopkeeper and not a Christian one? How would they know that?\nBecause Rosenbach(ph), Greenbach(ph), Silber(ph), Weiss, Brown, Schwarz,\nScharzman \u2014",
        "Q: They could be German names too.",
        "A: They \u2014 they were German names, they \u2014 those were German names.\nZimmerman.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They were occupation, they were color, they were animals. And ea \u2014 I think in\n\u00b037, it was after the Olympic games 1n \u201937, every Jewish shopkeeper had to take a\nmiddle name. If it was a male, his middle name was Israel, so my father was Elias\nIsrael Olejer. If it was a woman, her middle name was Sarah. And so it would\nhave been Cesia Sarah Olejer. That\u2019s how they knew. And it had to be so and so\nmany centimeters up from the floor, and so ma \u2014 1n \u2014 1n certain height of letters, in\nwhite. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how they knew who was Jewish and who was not. This\nwas plan \u2014 planned a long time ago, but they used the incident in Paris to do that\nbecause the mother called \u2014 called this a \u2014 it is \u2014 he was 18 years old, called him in\nParis, she said, I\u2019m so upset, they took Daddy away overnight, and I\u2019m so\nfrightened.",
        "Q: What incident in Paris are you talking about, just for our listeners. Excuse me\nfor a second.",
        "A: That\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: Okay, mm-hm.",
        "A: When \u2014 when the mo \u2014 what had happened was, my 13\" birthday was October\n29\", 1938, the night of October 28\" or the 29\", they rounded up all Polish Jewish\nmales [indecipherable] because you always listed with the \u2014 with the police\ndepartment.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, you do that throughout Europe.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: They know exactly where you are. And they shipped them off to no man\u2019s land,\nthe \u2014 Pozen [indecipherable]. And the \u2014 the Germans wanted them to go into\nPoland and Poland didn\u2019t want them, cause they were just Polish Jews. And so for\nawhile they remained there, in no man\u2019s land.",
        "Q: Your father amongst them?",
        "A: No, for some reason they overlooked my father. And all his friends were\ninvolved, everybody he knew was am \u2014 they overlooked him, because of the name?\nI have no idea. He went to the Gestapo the next day, to say, I have witnesses that I\nwas home. I did not try to hide. So he remained. He was the only man among all my\nparents\u2019 friends that \u2014 that lived in west Berlin. All their friends lived in west\nBerlin. So \u2014",
        "Q: Can I clarify that though, for a second? Their friends lived in west Berlin, but\nyou said that they didn't really have friends amongst German Jews.",
        "A: No, they were all Polish Jews.",
        "Q: So were they Polish Jews? Polish Jews.",
        "A: They were all Polish Jews. They were from L\u00e9dz and they were from some of\nthe smaller cities, Krakow, and \u2014 and they were from Warsaw. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And my parents had no relatives living in Berlin, they \u2014",

        "A: We spoke German. And they had befriended \u2014 my mother was a horrendous\ncook. She\u2019d be \u2014 she never learned how to cook because her mother lived with \u2014\nwith a ma \u2014 with a married, an older married daughter, and my \u2014 and my mother.\nAnd \u2014 an-and so my mother never learned how to cook, and she was a very bad\ncook. And my mother said that the first six weeks they were in Berlin, every day\nshe made chicken, boiled chicken with \u2014 with something, the oats, or what have\nyou, and \u2014 and boiled lima beans. I remember them, I\u2019d \u2014 I swear it\u2019s one of the\nreasons I got married, to get away from that Friday night dinner. But she made that\nevery day for six weeks. So my father said, that\u2019s schon genug. They \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s enough already.",
        "A: Yeah, and they befriended a German Jewish woman, Tante Lily Finkelstein.\nAnd she was married to a Polish Jew, and the \u2014 but a \u2014 they were only married like\na morganatic marriage, that\u2019s [indecipherable]. Was only a sib \u2014 a religious\nceremony, and they had a daughter Margot, and she became my best friend. And\nmy father was doing quite well in business, in this \u2014 in the 20s. And they \u2014 Tante\nLily would cook for my parents, and my father maintained her and Margot in an\napartment nearby. And why \u2014 why did I tell you this? And so, my mother \u2014",
        "Q: I was asking about who your parents friends were.",

And there\u2019s a very\nfunny story, one of my mother\u2019s cousins from Warsaw, a Tadeusz Abramski(ph).\nHe was Uncle Hainoch\u2019s(ph) son. And he came to visit them in Berlin, and they\ntook him to this nightclub, and he was dancing with this woman, and he \u2014 he was\nwining and dining her and buying her champagne and what have you. And my\nparents\u2019 friend said to my mother, when are you going to tell him that this 1s not a\nwoman, that this is a man? And when Tadeusz heard \u2014 found out, he was livid. He\ndidn't forgive her for many years. Your \u2014",

And then in\nApril of ?39, they decided the German \u2014 Jewish school should not be in the Adolf\nHitler Platz. That\u2019s a desecration, so they closed that one, and I went to the\nVietsnakaho(ph) schule, which was east. And I had to go there by subway, and I\nwent there until summer vacation began, June of \u201939, and June 20\", 1939, we were\ncalled to the American \u2014 well, we \u2014 in Berlin it was the embassy, not the city\u2019s, it\nwas the consulate.

They had made\narrangements right along, that if we were going to leave, we were going to go with\nthe SS Manhattan. It was the United States line. The manager of that office in\nBerlin was a Herr Hauptman. I forget his first name. And so \u2014 but they wanted to\ngo via \u2014 instead of leaving from Hamburg, they wanted to leave from Le Havre.\nAnd [II tell you why.",
        "Q: Belgium? Is that it?",
        "A: Le Havre is France.",
        "Q: Is France, mm-hm.",
        "A: Is France. And it\u2019s Hamburg, Le Havre, Southampton, Cope(ph), New York.\nAnd \u2014 and so he needed \u2014 they needed \u2014 here they had valid visas, Paris \u2014 France,\nnew \u2014 and then New York. And my father \u2014 my mother went to the French\nembassy and they would not give them transit visas, because what was happening,\npeople said oh, you know, we\u2019re going on to this place, that place, and they decided\nto stay in \u2014 in \u2014 1n \u20141n France. There were too many stateless people in \u2014 in\nFrance, and they wouldn\u2019t give it to them, so my parents were st \u2014 my dad had a\nreason, and I\u2019ll explain that in awhile. And so he \u2014 he went \u2014 he went to Mr. \u2014 they\nwent to Mr. Hauptman(ph) and he said, stay here, I have a friend at the embassy.\nAnd he went, in half an hour he came back, four visas to Paris. And so when we\nleft Berlin \u2014",
        "Q: Now, was he a Gentile?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, he was \u2014 he was a \u2014 an American \u2014 German American or\nAmerican German, whatever. But he was \u2014 was Christian. And \u2014 and \u2014 and we left\nJuly 31* from Berlin and we arrived in Paris, August first. And we stayed there til\nAugust 10\", and then we came \u2014 we \u2014 we boarded the ship. I-In Le Havre there\nwas a train that \u2014 that went directly to \u2014 to the port, and \u2014 and all our luggage was \u2014\nwas put on board, and \u2014 and that was that. And \u2014",
        "Q: I'd like to step back a little bit.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: And ask about two things. They\u2019re different, but I\u2019ll ask them while they\u2019re in\nmy mind. The first is, your experiences from 1931 til 1938, being in that Lyzeum,\nand what kind of thoughts you have, if you can remember, what kind of interaction\nthere was with the other kids, or the teachers, or how, after 1933 perhaps, things\nchanged, you know, with Hitler coming to power. That\u2019s one question. And the\nother one, I\u2019d like to concentrate a little bit more on your father\u2019s business and\nKristallnacht. What specifically happened there? How did he rebuild it? And if he\nkept it open for so long, was he able to save his assets, sell the business, or did he\nlose it all? So those two questions.",
        "A: Well, he \u2014 he had a \u2014 after awhile, a Christian clientele. One of them was a\nwoman whose husband had an important position in Goebbels \u2014",
        "Q: Ministry.",
        "A: \u2014 munistry. And she called him the afternoon of November ninth, and she said,\nHerr Olejer, my husband tells me that such and such is going to take place. He\nalways had a window well dressed. He \u2014 and the lights stayed on til about 11:30, 12\no\u2019clock and then they automatically went off. He commandeered a taxi, and he took\nout \u2014 he \u2014 he re \u2014 he redressed the window with inexpensive things, and he emptied\nout his stock, and with the taxi, they went back and forth, our apartment was two\nblocks away, and they got everything into the apartment. And \u2014 and he had a,\ninterestingly enough, he had a gate that was behind the plate glass. And it had\nsomething that you rolled it up, it \u2014 very heavy \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, I remember those types of window shutters.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you needed special shears. And when they \u2014 when they broke the\nglass, they did not have the \u2014 the \u2014 the shears to cut \u2014 to cut the wires, so they went\non. So they were never aware of what was in the back of the store or not. And \u2014 and\nso \u2014 and they didn\u2019t come into our apartment. Ah \u2014 you know, when we thought \u2014\nthe rumor had it that we were going to be \u2014 they were going to come into the\napartments, they never did.",
        "Q: So his losses were glass?",
        "A: Were glass. And of course, he had to replace that and \u2014 and \u2014 and there was a \u2014\nthere was also a special tax for that, etcetera, etcet \u2014 whatever he had to do, he did,\nand he reopened the store. But he was hoping at some point to get out of New\nYork, so he would go to \u2014 he would go to \u2014",
        "Q: Out of Berlin, you mean.",
        "A: Out of Berlin. So he would go to \u2014 to travel, and my mother would go to \u2014 or he\nwould go to travel agencies, and \u2014 and he was looking for \u2014 in South America, at \u2014\nwhere they have winter and summer, because you know, he was in the fur business.\nAnd the \u2014 and you n \u2014 you know what happened with the voyage of the damned,\nyou know, that they \u2014 they weren\u2019t permitted to land, and they would say Herr\nOlejer, now it\u2019s 2:15, what\u2019s going to be at three o\u2019clock, I really don\u2019t know. And\nmy dad said, costs a lot of money to take a family of four, etcetera, etcetera, and\nwithout any guarantees, I really don\u2019t know what to do. So, in 1937, remember that\nafter the Russian revolutions, the white Russians, where were they? They were in\nBerlin, and they were in Paris.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: And they had many, many connections with the \u2014 with \u2014 among the diplomats.\nSo my m\u2014 my father sent my mother to Paris in 1937. She had an aunt who \u2014 and a\nhusband and family, and they went to Paris from Warsaw, and \u2014 right after the first\nWorld War. And they opened a furniture factory. She had a first cousin from the\nWarsaw area who went to Paris after the first World War, and she opened a\nknitting factory. So my dad sent my mother to Paris to see both relatives, to as \u2014\nbecause he didn\u2019t want to have to wait too long to find out if what he was going to\nsend out, when \u2014 would the \u2014 would \u2014 would arrive in New York, because by then\nwe already had a quota number from my mother\u2019s oldest sister who lived in New\nYork, she couldn\u2019t support a d \u2014 a\u2014 a mouse. And this is the height of the\ndepression here. But we had the quota number, the low quota number, that\u2019s \u2014 that\nwas our saving grace. It was somebody else\u2019s papers that enabled us \u2014 that he said\nhe would \u2014 he was willing to support us. So he sent my mother to Paris to see both\nthe aunt and the cousin. And he decided, to the aunt he wanted to send fur. To the\ncousin he would send money. When the dollar was two and a \u2014 with the \u2014 the dollar\nwas two and a half marks, my father paid 14 marks for every dollar that he sent out.\nAnd that was sent to the cousin, and she was \u2014 she opened up a safe deposit box so\nthat when my parents, if they should get out \u2014",
        "Q: They have \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they could go and have money to get started with. To the aunt, she \u2014 since she\nhad a huge factory, she was to get the furs. So what he would do is, he would throw\ntogether [indecipherable] or Persian lamb, or mink or whatever it was, or fox,\nalmost without destroying it, just 1t looked like \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it looked like a coat ora\njacket. And \u2014 and she would st \u2014 and th-the \u2014 the relative was gonna come and visit,\nwas a\u2014 was a person by the name of Shapsa(ph). And my mother com \u2014\ncommunicated with them in Polish \u2014 in Yiddish, that Shapsa(ph) was coming to\nvisit and he doesn\u2019t know his way around, and will you please come and \u2014 and \u2014\nand help him with his luggage and pick him up at \u2014 at \u2014 and pick him up at the\nstation. So my dad would buy a train ticket from Berlin to Paris. That gave him\npermission to put a suitcase aboard the train. He would do \u2014 and when no one came\nto pick it up, they put it into storage in Paris. My mother would send a letter with\nthe receipt and the key to the aunt and say, Shapsa\u2019s(ph) coming, and you know, he\ndoesn\u2019t know his way around, would you help him with the luggage? And that\u2019s\nhow 14 suitcases were waiting for us when we came to Paris. And we came \u2014 we\nleft August \u2014 July 31%, and w-we crossed the border at Aachen. We went via \u2014 via\nBelgium into Paris, and you could see the Maginot Line and you could see that\nthey were massing on either side. You had them on the French si \u2014 on the \u2014 on the\nBelgian side, and you had them on \u2014 on \u2014",
        "Q: So you were \u2014 you sensed war was coming?",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 you could see it. You could see it, and \u2014 and \u2014 and so we arrived in\nParis August first, and we had dinner that night at my \u2014 at my mother\u2019s aunt and\nuncle, and they wined and dined us, and they were \u2014 made arrangements to bring \u2014\nhave all the suitcases brought to the ship \u2014 train, when we left August 10\". And we\nwere at a hotel, and the mam \u2014 Monday we saw the cousin, and \u2014 and by Tuesday\nmorning my dad said to the cousin\u2019s husband, Monsieur, let\u2019s go, and he said \u2014\nmeantime, the news had been terrible, coming out of \u2014 the \u2014 you know, they were \u2014\nthey were maneuvering, they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they \u2014 they were getting ready for\nwar, and they had a shortage, they had a cash flow problem, and they didn\u2019t think\nwe'd ever get out. So it was invested in their business, and there was no money.\nAnd my father said to my mother, you go with the children to New York, I\u2019m not\ndoing this here, I\u2019m \u2014 you know. And my mother said, nothing doing. We\u2019ve lost so\nmuch, we\u2019ll lose some more. We have our lives. We\u2019ll learn, and we\u2019ll \u2014 and when\nyou \u2014 and you have \u2014 you have the furs, and you\u2019ll do the best you can. And she\nconvinced him. So we \u2014 we left \u2014 we left as a family and we arrived here. And\ninterestingly enough, he took out \u2014 he took out all his machinery, etcetera, and it\nwas put into a crate. And in order to fill it up, to \u2014 to secure things inside, he used\nold patterns. Not a nickel was charged for all those suitcases with furs. Those\npatterns, that my dad had to pay for. And was just funny, but he wa \u2014 he \u2014",

To send their families out, to\nsave them. He didn\u2019t, he was \u2014 you know, he \u2014 he said, they would never touch me,\nbecause look who I am. And look, I\u2019m traveling in the highest circle. And that\u2019s\nwhat happened to some people.

Interestingly enough, my\nmother was the youngest of nine, my dad was the youngest of six. And one of his\nolder brothers, I have photographs, married one of my mother\u2019s older sisters.\nHowever, on \u2014 my dad would go once af \u2014 when the f-first World War was over, he\nwent to \u2014 he decided he was going to go to Germany. He didn't want to go to New\nYork. He did want to go where the weather was \u2014 where they would have winter,\nbecause he was 1-1n the fur business. He ended up as a furrier, and he made his\n[speaks German], he became a master furrier in Berlin. I have his diploma\nhanging on the wall 1-in my apartment.",
        "A: They spoke Polish. They spoke Polish and Yiddish, and \u2014 and also some\nRussian, because at that \u2014 one point, the Russians were there, and that during the\nfirst World War, the Germans were in \u2014 were in Warsaw. My mother\u2019s father died\nwhen she was two years old, in 1902. Her father was one of three brothers, the\nAbramski(ph) brothers, Hainoch(ph), Mendel, and Pesach(ph). Hainoch(ph) and\nMendel were the Florsheim(ph) of Poland. And there was still a \u2014 a record of\nthem, who\u2019s who in business in 1939 in Europe. And they were listed, and they\nwere a corporation. They brought their machinery in Manchester and in Germany.\nThey had tanneries, and they had factories. They also sol \u2014 sold out of that \u2014 one of\nthe brothers, Mendel Abramski\u2019s(ph) house, my mother worked there, because\nwhen her father died, he was a contractor for them.",
        "A: Of \u2014 oh, Abramski(ph) shoes.",
        "A: [indecipherable] in Polish",
        "A: Yes, Abramski(ph) shoes and \u2014 and \u2014 and they were well known, and they had\nstores in \u2014 in Warsaw and in the provinces, and they also had people that went onto\nthe road to sell shoes. And my mother, as I said, sold for them until she got married.\nAnd \u2014 and she\u2019d met my father on one of the trips, that he came \u2014 he went twice a\nyear to see his mother and his siblings. And \u2014 and \u2014 and I guess they fell in love,\nand my mother\u2019s papers weren\u2019t ready to go to Germany, so they got married in\nDanzig, Gdansk. And then she \u2014 her two uncles escorted her there, and they had\njust a religious ceremony, they did not have the civilian one, so the uncles just\nwhisked her back to Warsaw. And so their marriage wasn\u2019t consummated until she\njoined him about six weeks later in Berlin. And that was 1924, and \u2014 August 1924,\nand in October of \u201925, I was born. And I was a very difficult birth and \u2014 and I had\nasthma. And mom \u2014 I th\u2014I wasn\u2019t sleeping and my mother would carry me around\nall night. And my father felt very badly for her. So when, in 1926, there was a well\nknown plastic surgeon, a Dr. Josef(ph), who had practiced medicine during the first\nWorld War, and some of his instruments were used throughout Europe. And she\nwent there to have a \u2014 to have a \u2014 a nose job, because when she was a little girl,\nduring the summer, and she was the youngest of nine, and she ran into a tree. And\nshe had a prominent nose, I have my mother\u2019s nose, but she broke the nose, she had\na bump on her \u2014 o-on her nose, so he said she should go there and have her nose\ndone. And my mother would tell how she \u2014 when she went in there, there were\nyoung men with big ears, and they came out with little shells. And there women and\nmen who went in with huge noses, and they came out with little s-snub noses. And\nwomen went in with humongous breasts, and came \u2014 they went in with brassieres\nand \u2014 and it was perfect. And my mother said her surgery was not a success. She\nremembered swallowing blood while they threw chocolate into her mouth. And\nprofessor Jusef(ph) wanted her to come back to do it over, and she said no, she\nwould live with that. So, I have my mother\u2019s nose, and then in \u2014 when we were\nalready in New York, I was 16 years old, and I wanted to have my nose done and\nmy mother would say [speaks German], the nose isn\u2019t that important. And then\nwhen I got married and I suggested this to my husband, I said, I married you not\nbecause of your nose, and you don\u2019t have to \u2014 so, here I am. I have \u2014 my son has\nmy nose.",

        "A: Well, he \u2014 he had a \u2014 after awhile, a Christian clientele. One of them was a\nwoman whose husband had an important position in Goebbels \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 munistry. And she called him the afternoon of November ninth, and she said,\nHerr Olejer, my husband tells me that such and such is going to take place. He\nalways had a window well dressed. He \u2014 and the lights stayed on til about 11:30, 12\no\u2019clock and then they automatically went off. He commandeered a taxi, and he took\nout \u2014 he \u2014 he re \u2014 he redressed the window with inexpensive things, and he emptied\nout his stock, and with the taxi, they went back and forth, our apartment was two\nblocks away, and they got everything into the apartment. And \u2014 and he had a,\ninterestingly enough, he had a gate that was behind the plate glass. And it had\nsomething that you rolled it up, it \u2014 very heavy \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you needed special shears. And when they \u2014 when they broke the\nglass, they did not have the \u2014 the \u2014 the shears to cut \u2014 to cut the wires, so they went\non. So they were never aware of what was in the back of the store or not. And \u2014 and\nso \u2014 and they didn\u2019t come into our apartment. Ah \u2014 you know, when we thought \u2014\nthe rumor had it that we were going to be \u2014 they were going to come into the\napartments, they never did.",
        "A: Were glass. And of course, he had to replace that and \u2014 and \u2014 and there was a \u2014\nthere was also a special tax for that, etcetera, etcet \u2014 whatever he had to do, he did,\nand he reopened the store. But he was hoping at some point to get out of New\nYork, so he would go to \u2014 he would go to \u2014",
        "A: Out of Berlin. So he would go to \u2014 to travel, and my mother would go to \u2014 or he\nwould go to travel agencies, and \u2014 and he was looking for \u2014 in South America, at \u2014\nwhere they have winter and summer, because you know, he was in the fur business.\nAnd the \u2014 and you n \u2014 you know what happened with the voyage of the damned,\nyou know, that they \u2014 they weren\u2019t permitted to land, and they would say Herr\nOlejer, now it\u2019s 2:15, what\u2019s going to be at three o\u2019clock, I really don\u2019t know. And\nmy dad said, costs a lot of money to take a family of four, etcetera, etcetera, and\nwithout any guarantees, I really don\u2019t know what to do. So, in 1937, remember that\nafter the Russian revolutions, the white Russians, where were they? They were in\nBerlin, and they were in Paris.",
        "A: And they had many, many connections with the \u2014 with \u2014 among the diplomats.\nSo my m\u2014 my father sent my mother to Paris in 1937. She had an aunt who \u2014 and a\nhusband and family, and they went to Paris from Warsaw, and \u2014 right after the first\nWorld War. And they opened a furniture factory. She had a first cousin from the\nWarsaw area who went to Paris after the first World War, and she opened a\nknitting factory. So my dad sent my mother to Paris to see both relatives, to as \u2014\nbecause he didn\u2019t want to have to wait too long to find out if what he was going to\nsend out, when \u2014 would the \u2014 would \u2014 would arrive in New York, because by then\nwe already had a quota number from my mother\u2019s oldest sister who lived in New\nYork, she couldn\u2019t support a d \u2014 a\u2014 a mouse. And this is the height of the\ndepression here. But we had the quota number, the low quota number, that\u2019s \u2014 that\nwas our saving grace. It was somebody else\u2019s papers that enabled us \u2014 that he said\nhe would \u2014 he was willing to support us. So he sent my mother to Paris to see both\nthe aunt and the cousin. And he decided, to the aunt he wanted to send fur. To the\ncousin he would send money. When the dollar was two and a \u2014 with the \u2014 the dollar\nwas two and a half marks, my father paid 14 marks for every dollar that he sent out.\nAnd that was sent to the cousin, and she was \u2014 she opened up a safe deposit box so\nthat when my parents, if they should get out \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 they could go and have money to get started with. To the aunt, she \u2014 since she\nhad a huge factory, she was to get the furs. So what he would do is, he would throw\ntogether [indecipherable] or Persian lamb, or mink or whatever it was, or fox,\nalmost without destroying it, just 1t looked like \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it looked like a coat ora\njacket. And \u2014 and she would st \u2014 and th-the \u2014 the relative was gonna come and visit,\nwas a\u2014 was a person by the name of Shapsa(ph). And my mother com \u2014\ncommunicated with them in Polish \u2014 in Yiddish, that Shapsa(ph) was coming to\nvisit and he doesn\u2019t know his way around, and will you please come and \u2014 and \u2014\nand help him with his luggage and pick him up at \u2014 at \u2014 and pick him up at the\nstation. So my dad would buy a train ticket from Berlin to Paris. That gave him\npermission to put a suitcase aboard the train. He would do \u2014 and when no one came\nto pick it up, they put it into storage in Paris. My mother would send a letter with\nthe receipt and the key to the aunt and say, Shapsa\u2019s(ph) coming, and you know, he\ndoesn\u2019t know his way around, would you help him with the luggage? And that\u2019s\nhow 14 suitcases were waiting for us when we came to Paris. And we came \u2014 we\nleft August \u2014 July 31%, and w-we crossed the border at Aachen. We went via \u2014 via\nBelgium into Paris, and you could see the Maginot Line and you could see that\nthey were massing on either side. You had them on the French si \u2014 on the \u2014 on the\nBelgian side, and you had them on \u2014 on \u2014",
        "A: Well, that \u2014 you could see it. You could see it, and \u2014 and \u2014 and so we arrived in\nParis August first, and we had dinner that night at my \u2014 at my mother\u2019s aunt and\nuncle, and they wined and dined us, and they were \u2014 made arrangements to bring \u2014\nhave all the suitcases brought to the ship \u2014 train, when we left August 10\". And we\nwere at a hotel, and the mam \u2014 Monday we saw the cousin, and \u2014 and by Tuesday\nmorning my dad said to the cousin\u2019s husband, Monsieur, let\u2019s go, and he said \u2014\nmeantime, the news had been terrible, coming out of \u2014 the \u2014 you know, they were \u2014\nthey were maneuvering, they were \u2014 they were \u2014 they \u2014 they were getting ready for\nwar, and they had a shortage, they had a cash flow problem, and they didn\u2019t think\nwe'd ever get out. So it was invested in their business, and there was no money.\nAnd my father said to my mother, you go with the children to New York, I\u2019m not\ndoing this here, I\u2019m \u2014 you know. And my mother said, nothing doing. We\u2019ve lost so\nmuch, we\u2019ll lose some more. We have our lives. We\u2019ll learn, and we\u2019ll \u2014 and when\nyou \u2014 and you have \u2014 you have the furs, and you\u2019ll do the best you can. And she\nconvinced him. So we \u2014 we left \u2014 we left as a family and we arrived here. And\ninterestingly enough, he took out \u2014 he took out all his machinery, etcetera, and it\nwas put into a crate. And in order to fill it up, to \u2014 to secure things inside, he used\nold patterns. Not a nickel was charged for all those suitcases with furs. Those\npatterns, that my dad had to pay for. And was just funny, but he wa \u2014 he \u2014",
        "A: No, who knew 1s right.",
        "A: Well, you \u2014 you \u2014",
        "A: A-And yo \u2014 there was a movie called, in \u201cThe Gardens of Finzi-Continis.\u201d",
        "A: And remember, he was \u2014 he was ve \u2014 a very assimilated Jew, and he traveled in\nthe highest circles, with \u2014 with important people from Italy. And he did not,\nwhereas there were people in much lower segments of society, and th-the \u2014 the\nyoung men, in order to protect them, they \u2014 they went to Switzerland to see what\nthey could do, because they saw it coming, you know? To send their families out, to\nsave them. He didn\u2019t, he was \u2014 you know, he \u2014 he said, they would never touch me,\nbecause look who I am. And look, I\u2019m traveling in the highest circle. And that\u2019s\nwhat happened to some people. One of our neighbors in Berlin, he had been in the\nfirst World War, he still had hanging over his couch, his a \u2014 his sword \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 a-and \u2014 and his helmet, and \u2014 and Iron Cross. And he said to my father, July\n1939, I don\u2019t understand it. You eastern European Jews, you can go to North\nAmerica, and we German Jews, we can only go to Shanghai. And he had a 20 year\nold son, and an 18 year old daughter, and he wouldn\u2019t let them go, and I\u2019m sure\nthey were all destroyed.",
        "A: So they went \u2014 this is July of \u201939, and they were still thinking in those terms.",
        "A: And \u2014 and \u2014 and with everything else that took place, to go to Shanghai, Stalin\npermitted Jews to cross Russia.",
        "A: Siberia, to get to Shanghai. And they \u2014 and the Japanese treated those German\nJews, and Jews very well. My mother \u2014 my father had a \u2014 had a customer who\nended up in \u2014 in New York aft \u2014 into \u2014 after Shanghai. She had a son in England,\nso when we stopped in Southampton, he had \u2014 he had jewelry for her, that he gave\nto the son, and a ta\u2014 and a\u2014 and a bicycle. And the son came to the shi \u2014 came to\nthe ship and took that. And when Mrs. Turash(ph) ended up in New York, and she\ncame to see my parents to thank them for whatever it is they had done. She said\nwhen she got to \u2014 she was a handsome woman, she was a divorcee and she had one\nson who lived in England already. And \u2014 and she had a \u2014 a boyfriend who was a\nmember of the, I guess, Gestapo. And he helped her get to Shanghai, and she \u2014\nwhen she get \u2014 and she was a handsome lady. And she said she was telling the story\nwhen the \u2014 when the war broke out, what \u2014 what he said to her. I could like you. Do\nyou sleep single? That\u2019s how she worded it, that\u2019s what he said to her. I could like\nyou, do you \u2014 do you sleep single? I\u2019ll never forget that, I thought it was so funny, I\nwas \u2014 happened to be there when \u2014 when she \u2014 when she worded it that way.\nsomething, what he did, how much damage was done from Kristallnacht. And it \u2014\nit sounded very scary.",
        "A: But \u2014 but life went on.",
        "A: It went on, and as the German Jews had to \u2014 had to reduce their overhead and\nmove into smaller quarters, my father had a friend, a German Jewish friend who\nwas in ant \u2014 in ana \u2014 in antiques. And he took him and convinced him to buy two\nsets of china. One was a Limoges service for 24, and one was a German\nFurstenberg tea and coffee service for 20, and he bought that, and he brought that\nand it came a \u2014 some of it that was not broken, and some of \u2014 course, some stuff\nwas broken.

The furniture was left there, we didn\u2019t bring any furniture, he just\nbrought his machinery.",
        "A: The business he just closed.",
        "A: He just closed the door, and \u2014 and that was that. And then when we left,\neverything had to be in quadruplicate, so my mother hired a secretary to do that.\nEvery handkerchief, every pair of stockings had to be listed in quadruplicate. And\nin the middle of the packing, the Gestapo, two guys came from the Gestapo, they\nwouldn\u2019t even take a drink, nothing. They \u2014 they watched one another. In the\nmiddle of that we had an air raid, and \u2014 and everybody had to go down into the\nbasement. And then they finished packing. Somebody complained there was a lot of\nnoise, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and these two guys, with yelling, you know,\n[indecipherable] from Himmler, Judens an raus.

And next day, I think there was some snow. And \u2014 and that\u2019s where, of\ncourse, they had the final solution, in one of the villas. And \u2014 and the other favorite\nplace, of course, was the zoo, we went there every Sunday. That was my favorite\nplace, and there was a very well known gorilla in Berlin, he was known as the\ngorilla Bobby, Bobby. And he died in 30-something. And when we went in \u201988, we\nwent to the zoo, and we went in through the [indecipherable] tour. And then we\nended up the last thing we saw were the primates, and my children started yelling,\nMom, Mom, come here. And there was \u2014 and I have it \u2014 I have \u2014 I have a country\nhouse that I\u2019m no longer going to because my husband is on a walker now.

It was so clean.\nThe cages were clean, the animals were well taken care of. And I said, look at this.\nLook what they\u2019ve done for the \u2014 an-and they do nothing, nothing for human\nbeings. So difficult. So \u2014",

And my mother turned 74 in the hospital, and the few words that\ncame back, she \u2014 she could swallow, she could eat, but she couldn\u2019t speak. The few\nwords she babbled were in Polish, and my brother and I stood by like two dummies,\nand we didn't know what she was talking about, of course.",
        "A: Yeah, absolutely, and that\u2019s what comes back. For me to count and be accurate\nand fast, I count in German.",
        "A: Well, not really. \u2019'd \u2014 I?ve \u2014 ve come here from New York, and I went to the\nCharles E. Smith school to talk to them what it was like to grow up in Germany as\na Jewish child. I did that one day.",
        "A: You know, how did I di-da \u2014 did ha \u2014 what it was \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s hard for them to\nunderstand that \u2014 even that such a thing even exists. And it\u2019s \u2014 for me, it\u2019s difficult\nthat \u2014 having met survivors and \u2014 and some of them are \u2014 are not telling the truth,\neither. They \u2014 they \u2014 th-they \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 the \u2014 they\u2019re just not, they\u2019re a \u2014 they\u2019re\nimagining things, to a degree.",
        "A: They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re willing to testify that they were in particular places, when be \u2014\nthey \u2014 they admitted to me they were not. There are people that don\u2019t have numbers\non their arms, that I met in 1949 - \u201950, and you couldn\u2019t have been to that many\ncamps, and not have a number. So, it\u2019s \u2014 and th-then \u2014 then also, I we \u2014 I went to\nthe early Yom HaShoahs, so the first ones that were in New York, and \u2014 and\neverybody wanted to be, you know, the first \u2014 well \u2014 well, 1f you come very late,\nyou can\u2019t sit in the first row, and they liked to be where famous people were. But\nthat\u2019s human nature. And among \u2014 among those that \u2014 that [indecipherable] and\nthat they were part of, you know, controlling the sums of money that Switzerland\nwas willing to give, and Germany, and they don\u2019t want you to ask any questions.\nAnd that\u2019s human nature, because look at some of these people, look at these\nOrthodox Jews from New Jersey, that go to \u2014 that go to Israel and approach poor\npeople to sell them a kidney for 10,000 dollars and then peddle it off back home for\n160,000 dollars. They\u2019re not ashamed [indecipherable]. And \u2014 and this Mr. may \u2014\nMadoff, Woody Allen wrote a one page story in \u201cThe New Yorker\u201d called \u201cTails\nof Manhattan,\u201d t-a-i-l-s, where these two guys, these two guys are \u2014 have\ncoronaries and they come back as lobsters. And they are lobsters in this fancy\nrestaurant in New York. And in comes Madoff, and he wants two lobst \u2014 these two\nlobsters for himself and his wife, he wants to give her a nice dinner. And what\nhappens, a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 he has such an imagination, it is so funny.",

And it\u2019s octo \u2014\nit\u2019s November, and it\u2019s north. And \u2014 and boots had just come out. They were boots\nwith a\u2014 with a combination of leather and \u2014 and suede. And 1n the afternoon we\narrived there, and they tell my parents, you\u2019re Polish Jews, you\u2019re not Polish\ncitizens. And they permitted us, behind the wall, to walk. And it was quite cold.\nThen they permitted women and children to go inside. And one woman didn\u2019t have\nany children, so my mother gave her my brother. And she went and \u2014 with Peter\nand I \u2014 I went with my mother and my dad and the men remained outside. At six\no\u2019clock they permitted the men to come in also. And at eight o\u2019clock somebody\ncame out to say that Goebbels ministry called, that it was safe to go back home. So\nthere you are.",
        "A: Yeah, it was [indecipherable] that\u2019s just how it was. And \u2014 and yet, you know,\nPeter and I, to a degree we \u2014 we witnessed certain things, but we didn\u2019t question it,\nand \u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s how it was until \u2014 until we left. And we really, it was like the\nlast train out of Berlin.",
