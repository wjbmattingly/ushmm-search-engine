        "Q: Good morning.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: Could you tell us your full name and where and when you were born.",
        "A: I'm Gerda Haas, born Gerda Schild in Ansbach which 1s a small town in Germany \u2014 Bavaria\n\u2014 and I was born in November of 1922.",
        "Q: And can you tell us something about your family, your sister, your parents.",
        "A: Yes. Ansbach was \u2014 had a very religious Jewish community. We had some famous\nrabbanim\u2019 there \u2014 Elie Munk for instance who wrote The World Of Prayer, wrote it there in\nAnsbach while I was his student, and I was very friendly with him. We always experienced\nsome anti-Semitism in Bavaria \u2014 not outright \u2014 but we always felt we didn't belong to the\nwhole town, so it was a strong and purposeful Jewish community that we had. And almost\neverybody was deeply religious. My father was the Jewish butcher in town, naturally kosher.\nThere was nothing else. And we lived in a nice, heavy, solid stone house where we had lived\nfor many years. My grandmother lived with us, my Aunt Adelheid, an unmarried aunt and\nthere were two girls, myself and my sister Friedl. So 1t was a warm, extended, nice family.",
        "Q: Did your mother work?",
        "A: No. Mother only went into the butcher store when it got very busy. It wasn't done 1n those\ndays. Mothers didn't work.",
        "Q: Tell me what the relationships were like in the family.",
        "A: We were very close. It was understood that the younger generation took care of the older\ngenerations. There was never a question about it. We didn't even have any old age homes.\nThere was a little separate apartment for my grandmother where she could do her own\ncooking if she wanted to, but I have never seen \u2014 I never remember that she did. She always\nate and lived with us. And my Aunt Adelheid was \u2014 she had her own little business. She kept\nchickens and sold chickens, and I remember a lot how she took care of hens, and how she\ntook us out with her into the yard and we could feel for the eggs, and that was always a lot of\nfun. It was a very primitive, solid, early 1900's kind of a context that I grew up on.\n' Rabbis (Hebrew)",
        "Q: And were these hens in your yard?",
        "A: Yeah, right in the backyard of our house. It was a big house and you walked through and out\ninto the yard, and there were the hens on one side and my father's sausage making machinery\nwould be way down on the other side. And my mother's vegetable garden on this side over\nhere. And our swing where my sister and I swang and played ball was on this corner here,\nand it was fun. We had very happy childhood until Hitler came when I was ten.",
        "Q: Were you closer to one parent more than another?",
        "A: If possible, closer to my mother because she was more around. Father used to get up at four\nin the morning to buy the cows that he needed for his butcher shop, and then he had to go to\nthe next town to have them shekhted, the Jewish way of slaughtering the meat. And then he\nhad to come back and he cut up that whole animal right in the backyard. I wasn't squeamish\nabout it. And so he was always busy. And when he came home he was short tempered you\nknow \u2014 the customers aggravated him. Mother always was even tempered and sweet and\nkind and pleasant.",
        "Q: Did you ever work in the butcher store?",
        "A: No. I only went there to get some sausage \u2014 eat a little bit.",
        "Q: And did Aunt Adelheid provide chickens for your father?",
        "A: Yes. Aunt Adelheid provided Father with the chickens. They\u2019s also have to be shekhted the\nkosher way. I remember that quite well. At one time there was a phenomenon of a chicken\nrunning around with his head cut off already, the proverbial \u2014 he wasn't \u2014 somehow it didn't\ndie right away and flattered or flipped around for a few minutes.",
        "Q: Was your family religious?",
        "A: Yes, very religious \u2014 very Orthodox. There was nothing else in small towns. In fact, in all of\nGermany you were either very religious or you weren't aware of your Jewishness at all \u2014 you\nwere very, very Reformed. Conservative Judaism had not been invented, yet. So, yes, we\nwere very religious and interestingly enough, the religion was state supported. In other\nwords we always had to mark on taxes or on any forms \u2014 on birth certificates, wedding\nforms or anything \u2014 our affiliation. It was always Jewish because the state paid for the\nupkeep of the synagogue. The state paid for the salary of the Rabbi or the Hazan, or the\nShohet. So there was never a question that we were very Jewish, and everybody knew that\nand everybody, up to a certain point, respected it too.",
        "Q: Did you have non-Jewish friends growing up?",
        "A: Yes, we did have non-Jewish friends but not real good chums. They were just the kids on the\nblock that we played with. My parents didn't restrict us in going out with only Jewish people.\nIt didn't seem a problem. We knew so much where we belonged and who we were that there\nwas no danger for us to intermingle or anything. So, yes, we did have non-Jewish friends up\nto a certain point. But the real close friends were the Jewish people.",
        "Q: And when you went to school, it was a mixed school?",
        "A: Yes. In grade school. I don't remember too much about grade school, but then I went to the\nLyzeum \u2014 that was like it would here be maybe a high school, and then junior college. That\nwas already considered higher education. The girls went to the Lyzeum and the boys went to\nthe Gymnasium,\u201d which here is an athletic term, but over there 1t was an academic term. So,\nyes I do remember that very well. I was admitted in 1933 at the age of 10 only because I\ncould prove that my father was a World War I veteran. Already, Hitler had just come to\npower in January. I was admitted to school that fall. And I remember I had to bring some\nproof that my father had received the Iron Cross First Class in World War One and otherwise\nI could not have gone. I would have already been repelled as a Jewish student. So I did go,\nbut I didn't stay very long. In 1936 there was a law that \u2014 it was phrased in that way \u2014\nGerman students do no longer have to be subjected to sitting in the same room with Jewish\nstudents. So of course it was the Jewish students who had to leave. I always thought it was a\nvery interesting way of framing it. In those early years Hitler was still a little bit more\ncautious and modest in his demands on us than he was later on. But up to then we were\naccepted. We did not \u2014 slowly we did not chum around with the German children anymore. I\nremember there were two Jewish students in my class, myself and Matilda Adler(ph). How\nsome names will stay with you all your life! And she and I were, little by little, we were\nostracized. I remember us standing in the corner in the school yard. We couldn't mingle with\nthe other kids anymore. And they weren't mean to us, but they were not allowed to be\nfriendly to us. If they would, they were being punished. And I also remember that I was not\nallowed to answer questions in school, even if I knew the answer. After a while I didn't even\nraise my hand anymore because I knew the teacher could not possibly call on me. As a\nJewish student I was supposed to be stupid. I was supposed to be ignorant. I was not \u2014 Jews\n\u2014 Hitler declared Jews as stupid, so how could I know any answers? And that hurt a while\nbut then I got use to it. But finally in \u201836 we had to leave. And I got as far as fourth grade in\nthere instead of the ordinary sixth grade. I didn't graduate. And that hurt because I didn't\nknow what else to do. I couldn't stay at home \u2014 and I couldn't go to any other school, so that\nthe childhood years were happy, but the school years already were not. And my sister who\nwas a year ahead of me \u2014 same story. She was the only Jewish girl in her class and she was\neven more ostracized and picked upon \u2014 and she was more timid than I was. I was always\nmore the \u201ctomboy\u201d type and she was very much more gentle and introverted than I was. So\n* High school (German)\nshe suffered actually more than I did. And when we came home we talked a little about it,\nbut then we tried to forget it and just integrate into our family.",
        "Q: Did your parents give you any advice about what to do when you came home and talked\nabout this kind of abuse?",
        "A: Did my parents give me any advice? I would say \u201cno.\u201d My parents already were wrapped up\nin their own problems. Already, very early in Hitler's reign, the Schechtverbot\u2019 came \u2014 and I\nthink what you mean by that. The Jews were no longer allowed to kill their animals 1n the\nritualistic way by shekhting. And I always thought that was such an irony. The reason Hitler\ngave for that Schechtverbot was, it was inhumane to the animals. Think about that for a\nminute. For the animals he had pity, but for us \u2014 he put us into the gas. There was no more\ninhumanity involved there. So in \u201838, being very considerate for those poor animals, there\nwas the Schechtverbot. And then Father had his own problems. I remember how Father and\nMother and grandmother and Aunt Adelheid used to sit in the room and just try to figure out\nwhat the future will bring. Now all he had to sell were the chickens, you see. For a while\nthere was frozen meat from Argentina, but who's going to buy frozen meat in 1936. It was\nunheard of. Nobody would touch it \u2014 and so he gave that up very quickly. And then there\nwas no more income, except for that little bit that we made on the chickens. And they were\nhaving problems. For a long time I remember Father saying, \u201cMir gehen mit dem letzten\nZug.\" That was Bayerisch\u201d \u2014 that was Bavarian dialect for \"We're going to go with the last\ntrain. We're going to stick it out. We're not gonna leave here.\" But after a while he had to\nrealize that there was no \"letzten Zug.\" There was not gonna be a last train. So they had their\nown problems, and no, we didn't bother them with our problems. They couldn't have helped\nus anyway. If we ever confided into anyone it was Aunt Adelheid and grandmother. They\nseemed to \u2014 they were very close to us. Does that give you a little picture of my home life? It\nwas a nice, close, lovely family. And then came 1938 \u2014 Kristallnacht\u00ae. For a while the non-\nJews were moderate in their intercourse with us. They held back, but they weren't hostile.\nAnd I remember some of the closer non-Jewish friends used to come to the back door at\nnight when no one would see them and used to bring us maybe a little bread or some fruit\nbecause already we couldn't buy everything we wanted to. All of a sudden that was \u2014 the\nJews couldn't really buy what they wanted.",
        "Q: Can you explain that some because I \u2014 what kinds of restrictions there were, on movement\nand purchase\u2014\n* Shekht prohibition (German)\n* We are going with the last train (Bavarian German)\n> Bavarian (German)\n\u00b0 Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.",
        "A: Well, little by little the merchants would become hostile to us. And when they saw us\ncoming the better things would disappear under the counter, like the better fruits. I remember\nthere were always Blut Orangen\u2019 from America \u2014 that was those red oranges from America\nwhich was \u2014 that was just a delicacy for us. I remember that so much. Mother used to bring\nthat home once in a while. But then as time went on, there were no more Blut Orangen. They\ndisappeared the minute they saw us coming. And so, little by little, there was hostility. And\ndearth by us, after a little while, and we became poor. I remember how we used to sit around\nthat Blaupunkt radio that we had. I can still remember that so well. You used to turn the\nknob and the whole dial would zoom back and forth. You didn't have to turn the knob little\nby little. You just touched it a little and the dial would fly away from you and you had to\ncatch it to where you wanted it. But no matter which station you took, there was always\nHitler's voice on the radio \u2014 always this frightening voice \u2014 this loud, hypnotizing speech\nthat he gave \u2014 always against the Jews and how he would make the life of the Germans\nbetter and better if they would just follow him and do away with the Jews \u2014 and the Jews had\ntaken all their good things \u2014 and the whole Versailles Treaty was the fault of the Jews. The\nhuge banners that came up over Ansbach that used to say, \u201cDie Juden sind unser Ungliick*\u201d\n\u2014\"The Jews are our misfortune. Everything bad that happened to the Germans is the fault of\nthe Jews.\" And my sister and I used to slink by those huge banners that were all over the city\nand we used to try just not to see them, thinking if we didn't see them, they weren't there. But\nthey were there. Little by little that really took over. And I remember the torch parades that\ncame. Hitler visited Ansbach many times actually. It was a stronghold for the SA, the earlier\ngroup as you know. First came the SA and then came the SS The SA was the\nSturmabteilung\u201d and then the SS was the Schutzstaffeln\u2019\u201d. They actually \u2014 it started out as a\npersonal body guard of Hitler, but then the SA was pushed aside and the SS became the\ndominant military and civil force in Germany. But I remember still the SA going down our\ncobblestone streets with their large torches and singing and marching. And these were all\nyoung kids that we still knew at one time before they became SA It was always frightening.\nAnd when Hitler came into town the Jews, of course, were ordered to stay away \u2014 stay off\nthe streets. And also an interesting thing was, in the Nuremberg Laws what we thought was\nthe least ominous law was, that the Jews could not fly the German flag. That, you know, we\nthought that we could live with. Well, who wants it to fly the German flag? But it turned out\nthat was also a seminal law. Right away they could tell which house was Jewish because\neverybody else had to fly the flag. So that was also an interesting law. That was up to\nKristallnacht. After that 1t was no problem anyway.",
        "Q: Prior to Kristallnacht, do you remember seeing anyone beaten up? Were you ever in a\n\"Blood oranges (German)\n* The Jews are our misfortune (German)\n\u201d Storm troopers (German)\n\u201d Protection Squads (German)\ndifficult situation?",
        "A: No, except the kids used to \u2014 after a while they threw stones at us, or they made snowballs\nwith a stone inside you know and hit it at us, and we didn't know. And that was, of course,\nlike a missile. And we couldn't retaliate. We couldn't throw a snowball back. Number one,\nwe were much too timid, and number two, they would have just killed us if we had. They\nwere already \u2014 now the Hitlerjungend.\u2019' Both the boys and the girls had to be in the\nHitlerjungend, the youth organization of the SS, and they were all powerful. When they had\ntheir little Hitleryungend\u2019s uniforms on, they felt like they were God themselves. Otherwise,\nback to your question, no, I have not seen anyone being beaten up. But I will tell you, we\ndidn't provoke them. We stayed in our houses and we slunk around the streets and if we saw\nanyone\u2014",
        "Q: Mrs. Haas, can you go back to this time and talk a little bit about the intimidation that you\nwere feeling. You said that you would walk sort of in a frightened way and would stay in\nyour house. What was this doing to you and your sister?",
        "A: Well, when you are 10 years old and from that time on, and my sister was only a year and a\nhalf older, when you're constantly told that you are stupid, and \u2014 they called it \"\nUntermensch,'\u201c\" \u201csubhuman\u201d \u2014 and you personally are responsible for everything that's\ngoing wrong in all of Germany, and practically in all the world, and you can't shine in any\nway. You can't let your imagination, or your intellect, or your normal physical appearances\ncome up and speak for yourself \u2014 for itself, after a while that does something to you. After a\nwhile \u2014 after 10 years of this, you believe you are stupid. You believe you look Jewish and\nyou look ugly and you are not worthy of anything. And it really took a while to get over this.\nAnd you know I see some older people nowadays that have gone through this whole thing\nand it looks to me as if they haven't gotten over it yet. They still feel that they are the less\nhuman \u2014 the lesser human race \u2014 and I still \u2014 they look depressed to me. I think I got over it,\nbut during the time I believed I was no good. I believed I was a second rate human being. It\nwas a terrible thing to do. And you must understand, on the other hand, these very same kids\nthat went to school with me who up to then were nothing, they came from a downtrodden,\nbroken home, they had no clothes to wear, they \u2014 in many cases they had to come to the\nJewish families to beg for food and substances, they were suddenly dressed up in their Nazi\nuniforms and their \u2014 first in their Hitlerjungend uniforms, which were splendid. They were\nbeautiful, and later on they were dressed up in their SA and SS uniforms, underneath they\nwere still very mediocre, very pedestrian German people. But all of a sudden they were\nshining, they were beautiful. And don't forget, a uniform really does something to you\npsychologically. These people not only had their uniform on, but they felt they were the\nuniform. They felt they could do beautiful things just because they looked so great. And they\ndid. They got away with it.\n' Hitler youth (German)\n'* Sub-human (German); term used to refer to people deemed inferior according to Nazi racial\ntheory.\nAs you very well know, one of the very first laws that Hitler put onto the books in Germany\nwas the Gestapo Law of 1936 which stated that anyone in an SS, in a Nazi uniform, would\nstand above the law \u2014 could do anything they wanted to, could up to kill the Jews openly on\nthe street. As long as they were in their Nazi uniform the law could not touch them. Now if\nyou think of it, we on the other hand were since the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, staatenlos,\u2019\u201d\nstateless. That means we had no recourse to the law. Any injustice that was done to us, forget\nit. There was no law to go to, to complain. But they \u2014 and the psychological effect of that is\nnot to be underestimated. They were indeed the supermen the all powerful, unapproachable.\nNo law could touch them. And as we, when we were ten years old were told how low we\nwere, they were told how great they were \u2014 and by the time they were 20 and 25 and we met\nthem again in the killing centers, their psychology had changed just as much as ours had. I\ndon't know how to impress upon you what a uniform will do a person. It suddenly makes\nhim into a semi-god. And Hitler was no dummy about that. His uniforms were beautiful,\nshiny; those boots, those helmets, all those buttons and rows of things. And then the names,\nthey all of a sudden were \u2014 they weren't just Johann Schmidt anymore \u2014 they were\nOberscharfiihrer'* and they were Blockleiter.'\u201d And the kids already they were \u2014 I can't\nremember all the German names, but suddenly they got a title. They were somebody. And\nthey had quite forgotten that underneath the uniform there was really nothing much, but\nthat's \u2014 but you don't know that when you're stuck in it. You only know that 50 years later\nwhen you acquire a little overview and a little insight. But that was part of the success of the\nNazis \u2014 those uniforms, and the singing, and the torch parades. That was uplifting to them\nand to the spectators \u2014 to the people who watched. They suddenly belonged.",
        "Q: Did you ever get angry at this when you were \u2014 during this period?",
        "A: I don't think so. I don't think we were angry. I don't think we were allowed anger. We were\njust allowed fear, fear and trembling. I still remember so well when they sat around the table\nat night and worried, and worried, \u201cWhat are we going to do? What are we going to do with\nthe kids?\u201d We couldn't go to school anymore. \u201cHow are we gonna live?\u201d Anger was far\naway. Worry and fear was the dominant emotions. And then the belief in God, that never left\nus. \u201cGod will help. God will bring resolution. Hitler won't last long. Hitler's gonna be gone\nfrom the scene by Christmas. Hitler's gonna be gone from the scene by spring. No, he\nwasn't.\u201d We believed our own wishes. We didn't believe Mein Kampf \u00b0 and all the raging\nspeeches that he gave \u2014 that he prophesied that he would make Germany \u201cJudenrein.\u201d\u2019 That\n\"> Stateless (German)\n4 Upper crowd leader (German)\n'\u00b0 Block leader (German)\n'\u00b0 My Struggle (German)\nwas the big deal. It went in one ear and out the other for us. What does he mean \u201cJudenrein\u201d?\nThis is not a word we grew up with. So we ignored it. But he knew what he meant and he did\nit too. Now I get angry when I think about it, but in those days, no, there was no anger. There\nwas only great, great fear. And then we gathered around our Rabbi and he told us...\nEverybody was so short-sighted. Everybody was so blind. Even the Rabbi, whom we\nthought had real insight and foresight and a direct line to God you know, he said, \"Don't\nworry. Everything will be alright. Don't leave Ansbach. Stay, stay, stay.\" But unfortunately,\nthen he was the first to leave. He went and got a job in Paris as a Rabbi and he left. And that\nopened our eyes after that. We too began to leave. That hurt me more than anything else \u2014\nthat our Rabbi left us our beloved Rabbi. It's like your father leaving you. That was\ninteresting in retrospect.",
        "Q: When did he leave?",
        "A: I mustn't get too wound up in all my memories and emotions here.",
        "Q: When did he leave?",
        "A: When did he leave? He left \u2014 I think he left in \u201836 before Kristallnacht. I'm not sure on that\nanymore. It might have been after Kristallnacht. I'm not sure anymore. But I was especially\nclose to him and to all his children and to his wife, and I felt a great sense of loss when he\nleft so suddenly without telling us \u2014 and still preaching to the last minute \u2014 \u201cStay, be calm,\nGod will help, God will send rescue.\u201d And in the meantime he had already arranged for\nhimself a job in Paris.",
        "Q: Did that make you cynical?",
        "A: I'm sorry?",
        "Q: Did that make you cynical in some way?",
        "A: I was too young to know what cynical was. Those emotions you are mentioning are luxuries.\nWe were just plain, down to earth. We just dealt with the basics here \u2014 hope, anger and\nalways the belief in God. That never left us. And in a way it was a big help. It was a big help.\nWe would have despaired if we didn't have that, that hope for the future.",
        "Q: Did you maintain religious observance?",
        "A: Yes. I did. I did, but in a modified way. We grew up very religious, as I said. There was\nnothing else. And we adored our Rabbi. We would do anything he would tell us to. And I'm\nnot only speaking of my sister and myself. But that whole youth group whose picture you\nhave seen. We gathered around him every Shabbos and we were devoted to him. That great\nfaith, I think, helped me a great deal, because later on when things really got... What I'm\ntelling you now, that's not bad. That's just the beginning. But later on when things really got\nbad, then there was nothing else to cling to. And I wonder if people understand that, that you\ncan still be religious and believe in God even though you see what \u2014 let's say, what God is\ndoing all around you. I don't want to have to explain what I just said. But on the one hand\nyou see all the evil that \u2014 in our religious mind was still sent from God. And on the other\nhand, you come inward and you still believed he would help \u2014 and that was a big help. It\nreally was. It sounds like an irony, but it was a big help. And then later on when I was\nrescued, and I found my father again. Then again also my mother and my whole family had\ndied. Again there was at least that much reason to be grateful to God who had saved me, and\nhad saved my father. And then I married a religious man. I tried to bring up my children\nreligious. And it's a problem. You can't live without it and you can't live with it, but most of\nall you can't live without it. So it's a way of life now. It's a way of life.",
        "Q: When you got kicked out of Lyzeum, when you couldn't go anymore \u2014 when the Jewish\nchildren couldn't go \u2014 what was the decision of your parents?",
        "A: Yes. I remember that very well also. My sister was already old enough. First of all she had\ngraduated. She was two years ahead of me. She had graduated from the Lyzeum and now\nshe \u2014 there was nothing else to do. There was no post-graduate or college or anything \u2014\nforget it. She could either go to Hakhshara'\u2019 to prepare herself for Israel \u2014 for Palestine, but\nremember we were going with the last train so there was no need to go to Palestine. We\nweren't leaving Ansbach. So she went to a girls Landwirtschaftschule\u2019* \u2014 a girls preparation\nfor... just to be a wife and a mother. It wasn't Landwirtschaftschule, it was Wolfratshausen.\nHow can I explain it to you? It was a preparatory school for young women \u2014 for young\nladies. I remember she came back and she showed me how she learned how to fold linens so\nthat they would look like military in the shelves. You know, that's the kind of thing they\nlearned. Much good that did us. And I was too young to go there, so I went to the one Jewish\nschool that was still in existence. That was the Adass Jisroel Schule in Berlin. Now Berlin\nwas far from Ansbach. It was like 300 kilometers and that was far. Remember, we're in\n1930s in Europe. We're not in the 1990s in America. Berlin was far and I didn't know\nanybody. I had to live in the dormitory and I didn't know any kids. And now the bigger\nproblem was that I didn't have the correct preparation for a Jewish school. I had only gone to\nmy Rabbi during the section that was called \u201creligion,\u201d \u2014 \u201creligion,\u201d when the Catholics\nwent to their priests and the Protestants went to their father, to their religious leader, we went\nto Elie Munk, to Rabbi Munk. And that's all the religious education we had that one hour a\nweek where we had religion. So I was not prepared for that and of course I did very poorly.\nSo that reinforced my thinking that I really was stupid and minor, even in the Jewish school I\n'\u2019 Hakhshara He-Halutz [Pioneer Training] (Hebrew)\n8 Agricultural school (German)\n\u201d Religion (German)\ncouldn't excel, you see. So it was tough. And then I was called home after Kristallnacht. I\nremember driving through Berlin and seeing the synagogues in flames and all the glass on\nthe streets and the people huddled and depressed. And it was very obvious that what had\nimpacted upon me psychologically had impacted on all the Jews. They walked around like\nthe victims \u2014 like the hunted. And I was in the train, and I was going toward Ansbach, and\nthere my family had been taken to a collection center. Father had been sent to prison along\nwith all the men. And Mother and all the women had already been sent back home and were\npacking. And we couldn't take more than we had that we could carry, and we had to leave\neverything. And I remember the name of the man that was just \u2014 just a very simple little\nfellow who was ordered by the Nazis to take over our house. And he already had moved in\nwith his eight kids. And we were still packing and leaving and going to the railroad station,\nand then we realized really what was going on. Then Father didn't talk about the last train\nanymore. And, then we went \u2014 we could only go to certain cities. We couldn't just pick up\nand leave and buy a new house, or go to a new apartment \u2014 far from it. We were told which\ncities to go to and we were told to go to Munich, and we were also told to just find someone\nto live with. And we found a distant relative \u2014 well it doesn't matter \u2014 there was some\nrelationship there, who took us into one spare room that they had. And then Father and all\nthe uncles and cousins all came back, all their hair shorn. The Munich Jews had been sent to\nDachau, whereas the Ansbach Jews had been sent to, to prison in Nuremberg. And I\nremember how they all came back from the Dachau with their heads completely shorn, and\nthen we began to wake up. Then we still only thought that the men were in danger. Who\ncould think that they would kill women and children, or old people, or Rabbis, or respected\nbusiness people or anything? So then Father was lucky and he got onto a convoy that the\nBritish Jews had organized and he got into that convoy as a butcher, and they went to\nSandwich, England, to the Kitchener camps, with the hope \u2014 this was in July of 1939. There\nwas no talk of war, yet. Hitler kept that very secret. It was \u2014 that was like a bombshell when\nthe war started. So in July, a little more than one month before the beginning of the war in\nPoland, there was no fear of war. So we thought that my father could find domestic positions\nfor us and bring us over after him. But the war ended that.",
        "Q: Do you think there was any talk of all of you going at once or could only the men go?",
        "A: That was only a transport for men from 18 to 45 years old and Father was just 45. It was a\nmiracle he even got in.",
        "Q: So your father's in England and you're all in Munich.",
        "A: So Father left. It was very traumatic because families were sacred \u2014 were holy. You didn't\nseparate. You didn't divorce. That was not heard of. That was unheard of. You didn't leave\nyour family. You didn't separate. You didn't leave your family alone. So that was very\ntraumatic when my father left in that train in the railroad station in Munich. And my mother\nwho was a typical Orthodox Jewish woman with a shaytel\u201d\u201d on and completely helpless.\nEverything she did \u2014 she ever did, she was told by her husband. People were like that. I\nknow it sounds medieval, but they were married off as youngsters, completely natve and\nthen they were told, \"Your husband will tell you what to do.\" And my father always told her\nwhat to do. And all of a sudden she was alone. And I remember how devastated she was and\nhow helpless at first. But then she had to learn. The money \u2014 the little bit of money that she\nreceived from the house was put into an account and she was only allowed a little sum every\nmonth. And she had to go and humiliate herself and beg for that \u2014 her own money \u2014 to get a\nlittle money so she could live another month. And then she sent us away. She sent my sister\nto Frankfurt, to the Jewish hospital. It was called Gagernstrasse. And I was a little too young\nto be a nurse. I was just old enough to be a baby nurse. And there's a division we don't have\nin this country, but I became a baby nurse. I was barely seventeen, and I was to Berlin.",
        "Q: Can I go back for a moment. The day that your father left or the few days before when you\nknew that he was going to leave, did he talk with you in any particular way. Was there \u2014 or\ndo you just \u2014 you remember the train station?",
        "A: I remember the train station very vividly. I'm sure he talked with my mother, but the talk was\nnot \u2014 not morbid. The goodbye was not like a final thing \u2014 like a finite goodbye. It was, \"I'll\ndo all I can to get you positions.\" And the British helped. The British Jews helped. And it\nworked for many people in that transport. Later on in New York I met many comrades of my\nfather's who had gone with him into the transport and they were able to bring their wives and\nchildren, and mothers and fathers over to England still. But somehow it just didn't work for\nmy father. After he died I found his notebook that he wrote. Every day he went and tried to\nfind a family who would take us in. Of course he didn't speak English. He had no money. It\njust didn't work. But of course we also thought we had all the time in the world.",
        "Q: So your mother's decision was to get something practical for both of her daughters?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And I remember she couldn't quite manage with money because she had only so\nlittle bit. So she went to a cousin of mine who still was there and he helped her out so that\nshe could pay for me. It was such a small sum compared to now, but still she didn't have it.\nAnd so we left, and again it was \u2014 it was not a big goodbye. But as soon as I was in Berlin,\nthen we had to wear the star. Then there was a law that we couldn't travel. Then there was a\nlaw we couldn't use telephones \u2014 public telephone stations. So all of a sudden we were\ncompletely cut off from her. No way of going back and no way of talking with her \u2014 just\nletters, letters, letters, letters. And she \u2014 the letters that she wrote to my father, she always\ntried to include letters from us. And my father gave me that whole bunch of letters. I still\n*\u201d Wig (Yiddish)\nhave it at home. First she writes \u2014 and she writes always the same \u2014 \"How am I going to get\nout of here? What's my quota? Who is going to help me? How am I going to find the money\nto...\" Just this grinding, grinding worry all the time. And then the one ray of sunshine, \"And I\ninclude a letter from the children.\" So she always waited until she got mail from us, from my\nsister in Frankfurt and from me. And we wrote, more or less normal \u2014 how we enjoyed our\ntraining \u2014 especially I, I worked with children, you see. And my sister, how she liked being\ntrained as a nurse and how interesting 1t was, and how she made friends. This was a new life\nfor her. All of a sudden my sister had friends, and she could shine, and she was a great nurse.\nAnd she sent back a picture in her uniform. Now she too had a uniform. That was really\nsomething. Those were a couple of happy years that we had. And I too had a uniform.",
        "Q: So somehow or other, even the separations, and the restrictions being more heavier in some\nway, your life nevertheless was okay during those two years.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. I would say so. We wrote to my mother all the time and she wrote back. Of course\nto us she didn't write these \u2014 these heavy letters. To us she just told what she did and who she\nmet and how she manages. For the first time in her life she was alone. She grew up in a\nfamily with five sisters. She was never, never, never alone. She never went to school or\nanything. And all of a sudden she was quite alone. That was traumatic. So she wrote what\nshe did.",
        "Q: Did she remain in that apartment where you first came?",
        "A: Yes \u2014 No. Those people left \u2014 those distant relatives. They all left. And I remember how she\n\u2014 how hurt she was. They all left kind of secretly. All of a sudden, you know. There was a\ngreat jealousy among the Jews against those who could leave and those who could not leave.\nAnd there was a great rivalry also you see. The ships\u2019 places were very rare, and the quota\nwas coveted \u2014 to be on the quota was heaven \u2014 to finally reach the quota. So the people who\nwere lucky like that kept that very secret \u2014 very much to themselves. They didn't say. And\nthen all of a sudden, this family left. I met them again years later in New York and that was a\nbig blow to us. And we stuffed \u2014 they finally allowed us to put a few things into their lift \u2014\ninto their package \u2014 and that's how we saved a very few of our treasured things that weren't\nso valuable, but they were very much treasured by us. And when I met them again in New\nYork, of course I was also... In a way we were very grateful for them. They had taken us in.\nBut in another way we felt very hurt that they snuck out. So that apartment was confiscated\nby the Nazis and we had to find another Jewish family. Now it got much more difficult\nalready. So there was this Frau Frankel(ph) who took us in, who had \u2014 her husband was still\nalive. And I met them later in Theresienstadt again. She and my mother then became friends.\nShe was an elderly woman.",
        "Q: So did your mother move in to Mrs. Frankel's house?",
        "A: Frankel's house, yes. That was the only way you could live anywheres. You had to move in\nwith someone. You couldn't rent an apartment \u2014 please. You have to think how this was now\n\u201839. Hitler was very outspoken what he was going to do with us. And that whole, that whole\nconcentration into bigger cities, and to live with other Jews, that was nothing but a\npreparation for picking us up with greatest of ease to take us onto the deportations, you see.\nThey didn't have to go anymore to the little farmhouses and to the little hamlets and to the\nlittle towns. They were already Judenrein.\u201d\u2019 And you could see now, how that was a\nsystematic concentration of the Jews \u2014 to pick them up and take them to the cattle cars.",
        "Q: Were you in Berlin when your mother moved to Mrs. Frankel's?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You were?",
        "A: No. No. I still moved with her to Mrs. Frankel's, and my sister also. And that was just one\nroom, you see. So, in a way, it was great to go to Berlin. In a way I said goodbye to her with\nthe greatest of joy. She was with Mrs. Frankel. I knew she wasn't all alone. And I was\nlooking forward \u2014 we were still thinking we'd have a life. We weren't, we weren't aware that\nwe were all \u2014 that was the last year, or last two years of our lives. I was looking forward to\nbeing a nurse.",
        "Q: How did your mother get along during the ttme when you were away? Did she...\u201d Did she\nhave...? There was no work.",
        "A: She volunteered a little. She volunteered in the old age home. This was before deportation.\nIn fact my mother was on the first train out of Munich. But we didn't know from deportation\nat that point. The word was unknown to us \u201cDeportation\u201d did that mean? And the other word\n\u2014 the other term that was used was \u201cArbeitstransport.\u201d Those were all \u2014 there was a whole\nnew terminology coming up that meant very little to us. \u201cJudenrein,\u201d \u201cJudenfrage,~\u201d\n\u201cLosung der Judenfrage.~\u201d You know, there were \u201cOsttransport.\u201d\u2019\u201d What did that mean? So\n\u201cDeportation\u201d was not a word that was heard of when I left my mother. I thought she\nwould stay there. Now, by then, \u2014 no, not yet. A little later Father got to America. And then \u2014\nyes, Father already had gotten to America in \u201839. He was shipped out very quickly. And that\nwas \u2014 now we're talking about 1940. Mother is alone and the letters that she writes to Father,\n*! Jew Pure (German); Nazi term used to describe areas that had been completely purged of their\nJewish population.\n** Jewish question (German)\n*\u00b0 Answer to the Jewish question (German)\n* East transport (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Deportation (German)\nwhich Father gave me later on so I'm very much in the picture what was happening through\nthose letters. Now she goes to the immigration station daily, daily, daily. That was her daily\nwork \u2014 to see if she could get out. And he in America was begging for money to buy the visa\nand to buy the ship's cards for the three of us. And still there was this thinking that the three\nof us would stay together. And then in one letter, that's like an \u2014 that's like an, like an\nepiphany already. In one letter she writes, and that was already very late when it was already\nmuch too late \u2014 she writes, \"Siegfried, don't try to get the three of us out. Just get the children\nout. Forget about me,\" she says. So then she volunteered a little bit in an old age home. And\nthen in 1941, when she was 45 years old, she got into Transport. By then I was in Berlin at\nthe Jewish hospital. And then my sister also ended up in Berlin because the Gagernstrasse\nwas Closed. And for a short while we were together. And even when she goes into the\ntransport, the last letter to my father she says, \"Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.\nEverybody else is going too. And I'm packing all my warm clothes. And I'll see you when all\nthis 1s over.\" Now we can talk about Berlin.",
        "Q: Did you find out about your mother going on the transport soon after she\u2014?",
        "A: No. I found out that she was going in the transport just before she went. She called us. She\nhad to go to a public \u2014 she had to go to the Jewish Community to use the phone. She was not\nallowed into a public phone. So she could call us in the Jewish hospital. We still had a\nphone. And then we had to call her back, pre-arranged, that she'd be at the Jewish\nCommunity in Munich. And she \u2014 first we tried to go with her. And number one, we couldn't\nget onto a train, we already wore the star. And, and number two, she said, \"Don't go with\nme.\" She says, \u201cThere's no use. I'll work, and what's the use?\" And then somehow she knew\nthat the transport was going to Riga. That was on the 1 1th of November \u2014 on the ninth of\nNovember, 1941. It was one of the very first transports out of Germany. That was before,\nthat was before the Wannsee Conference, when the killing was not really automatic yet. And\nstill, in Riga, as I later found out, they were killed as soon as they got there. But still we\nhoped that we would see each other again. We had no idea that they were killed right away.\nWhen I got to Theresienstadt, I was so happy. I thought I would find my mother. I would\nfind people again. We didn't know there was such a widespread transport system\n\u201cTagersystem.\u201d\u201d We thought, \"Well,\" you know, \"Everybody will see each other again.\"",
        "Q: So now your sister comes to Berlin from Frankfurt. Is that right?",
        "A: The whole group of the Gagernstrasse Hospital from Frankfurt. First there were deportations\nout of there. And then when the hospital got smaller and smaller, 1t was closed. And the\n* Camp system (German)\nremaining people all came to Berlin to work Zwangsarbeit,\u201d\u2019 forced labor at the Siemens\nfactory. To this day I can't buy anything from Siemens, believe me. So my sister was one of\nthem. And later on that whole group went to Auschwitz. But for a short while we were\ntogether and we could see each other on our days off. We couldn't use the U-Bahn* or the\nCity Bahn~ transportation or anything. We had to walk. We had to walk with our star. And\none of the thousands of laws that concerned us, that are really not well known, was that Jews\ncould not walk in any greenery, in any park, in anything that was planted and was pretty.\nThat was for Aryans only. So where there was a park \u2014 the Tiergarten\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and no matter what\nwe had to walk around it. We couldn't go through it. So I remember walking and walking\nand walking to visit her and then walking back. And we had to be home at a certain hour, so\nit was very restricted. The Berlin years were difficult years. The Ansbach years were mostly\nhappy, and the Munich years were ignorance. Dominant emotion was naivet\u00e9. What was\ngoing on we had no idea and still a lot of hope. But Berlin and our eyes were opened and all\nthe many laws that we had to respect that Hitler made. The whole, the whole Losung der\nJudenfrage \u2014 the whole deportation of the Jews was done legally. That's the ironic part. First\nhe made a law, then he killed us. You see? But how did we know that? We knew the law and\nwe tried to live with it. Then we already were, were very much the victims. We looked very\nbad. We had no more \u2014 we couldn't get clothing coupons. I remember we couldn't get\ncoupons to have our shoes repaired. So we walked around in shoes that were ready to be\nthrown out. We couldn't get new ones. That's without even saying. But we couldn't get our\nold ones repaired either. So we had no clothes. We had bad shoes. We were not well\nnourished. We had the star. We didn't need the star. We marked as victims from the inside\nout, and from the outside as well. Where as they got better and better \u2014 well fed and more\nvictorious, and more triumphant every day.\nIn the hospital, first I was in Niedershonhausen and then that was dissolved, and then I went\nin Berlin. I'm telling you how bad everything was, and yet there was that little nucleus of\nhappiness still, you know. We were among Jews. We could talk with them. We had our own\nlittle kingdom. We had our own little hierarchy. I was just a student nurse. I was nobody, but\nthe hierarchy went to the Head Nurse, and it was heaven when the Head Nurse was friendly\nwith you, which was not the case in my case. I never got enough self-confidence up to talk to\na head nurse, and she wasn't that much older than I was. And then, of course, there was the\nwhole hierarchy \u2014 all the physicians that seemed like demigods. And then there was the\nwhole god; that was Lustig \u2014 Dr. Lustig \u2014 Dr. Walter Lustig. He had two Doctors. He called\nhimself Doctor Doctor Walter Lustig. He was a very prominent Jew before the Nazis came.\nHe was married to an Aryan woman \u2014 to an Aryan physician woman and that was why he\nwas saved for quite a while. I'll get back to Lustig in a minute, but as you know the Mischlin\n*\u2019 Forced labor (German)\n8 Untergrund Bahn [Underground train] (German); Subway.\n\u201d Train (German)\n*\u00b0 Zoological garden (German)\n\u2014 the Mischehe\u201d' and the Mischlinge\u201d were a big problem to Hitler, and in fact the hospital\nremained in existence because of that problem of the Mischlinge and the Mischehe. They\ncouldn't divorce. The Pope didn't allow that, and Hitler couldn't treat the Aryan person as a\nJew, and he couldn't really accept the Jew as an Aryan, so he tolerated them. And it was\nalways a.... I'm sure you're familiar with the history of the Mischlinge. That was obviously a\nthorn in his side. And the children of those Mischlinge were also a big problem. And\nTheresienstadt was partly organized for those Mischlinge. They couldn't very well go into\ntheir death. After all, in many cases they had a pure Aryan father or... who was fighting for\nHitler on the front. So anyway, Lustig was married to an Aryan woman and he got the job as\nleader of the Jewish hospital.",
        "Q: Let's break now.\nEnd of Tape #1\n*' Intermarriage (German)\n** Mixed breed (German); Nazi term used for individuals of mixed Jewish and non-Jewish\nheritage.\nTape #2",
        "A: It's so long ago. It still gets to me.",
        "Q: You can see it in your eyes. You were back there. You were seeing what was happening. So\nthat\u2019s not.... Okay. Mrs. Haas, can you talk a little bit more about what was going on with\nyour sister at Siemens, the kind of work she was doing \u2014 what you talked about \u2014 what her\ncondition was at the time.",
        "A: As much as I can remember. Let\u2019s see. I was of course involved in my own work at the\ntime? When she first came to Berlin I was still in Niedershonhausen and I remember the\nHead Nurse of Niedershonhausen who was a lovely old lady, whom I was very attached to,\nused to invite my sister on her day off to come to me because my sister lived 1n \u2014 they all\nlived together in a big room. Very Spartan, nothing there at all, just beds and a chair or what\nhave you. So it wasn't much fun to spend the day off there. So the Oberschwester, > the Head\nNurse of Niedershonhausen \u2014 as much as I loved her I forgot her name now, I don't recall her\nname \u2014 invited my sister. So my sister walked. And I remember the Head Nurse then\ninstructed the kitchen to serve my sister and me a fried egg. Now that \u2014 need I say more? In\n1940, the end of 1940, we were each eating a fried egg in Berlin. I remember how much that\nmeant to us, and also nutritionally, my sister was very much down. They didn't have good\nfood and they worked very hard. They did factory work. I don't exactly know what they did.\nShe never talked about it. But in one of the letters to my mother \u2014 and then she sent it to my\nfather \u2014 she writes that she has been chosen to be the camp nurse \u2014 that she's taking care of\nthe little injuries, etc., etc., and that apparently was quite an advantage for her, and she was\nvery proud of it also. And then all of a sudden they were detailed into a transport and I don't\nrecall too much about that. I remember going to her dormitory at the Siemens factory and\nthey had left. There was this empty big room with nothing there. There was one hat that I\nremember she wore and that was sitting on her bed, and I took that hat and walked back\nhome. I don't recall my emotions or anything. I probably blocked them out and, again, the\nhope was that we would all see each other when we all got deported. That was always the\none \u201cglimmer\u201d of the deportation. We always thought we would see each other again. We\nwould also get there \u2014 like death, and you see your people again up in heaven, but that was\nnot the way it worked \u2014 was the concentration camps.",
        "Q: Was she more frightened than you?",
        "A: I think she was a lot more realistic than I was. I, after all, lived in a little Jewish nucleus in\nthe middle of Nazism. We were served our meals. We didn't have to go scrounging around or\n* Head nurse (German)\ngo to the grocery stores, which by that time already were restricted. The Jews could only go\nto certain grocery stores 1n the city during certain hours, and buy only certain things with\ntheir rations. That was all spared to me. We got our meals served and we didn't much ask\nwhere they came from. So I was much better off. Her rations \u2014 she worked hard and I think\nher rations were minimal because I remember so clearly how she enjoyed that egg. So she\nmust have had very poor food. And I don't remember too much. I remember that we wrote to\nmy father a lot when we got together and I don't, I don't remember what we wrote, but I\nknow what we wrote from reading the letters 30 years later and she writes \u2014 I remember\nespecially in one letter she writes, \u201cKann denn niemand etwas fir uns tun?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cCan't\nanybody do anything for us?\" We had, after all by then, the major part of our family here and\none part of the family in particular that moved to Argentina with all their money didn't help\nus at all. And I've never quite forgiven them that. They could have helped us. They had the\nmoney and we could have gone into Argentina. The quota wasn't that strict. And I remember\nespecially from her letter, \u201cKann dem Tante Lina garnichts ftir uns tun??? \u2014 \u201cCan't Aunt\nLina\" \u2014 who was the one there \u2014 \"do anything for us.\" So she was much more realistic than I\nwas. I didn't write such things. I only wrote about my nursing and my friends that I made and\nhow much I liked it, and things like that. She was much more with the times than I was. And\nAunt Lina unfortunately did nothing either. That was very, very sad that my own family\ndidn't gather around and pulled out as much as, as many as they could.",
        "Q: Why do you think in the Jewish Community Hospital that you were working in, that the food\nwas simply available and you were getting a better diet?",
        "A: Well I think it was simply because they were a big institution and \u2014 I don't know. I never\nwondered. It never occurred to me to wonder. But we actually still had kosher food. That\nwas the amazing part. That whole business with the Jewish hospital 1s very intriguing indeed,\nand I'm doing some research on it now. Up to my deportation in *43, there was a kosher\nkitchen in the Jewish hospital, which is phenomenal. And there were a few people, one of\nthe housekeepers, a couple of the physicians and several of the nurses, who trotted there\nevery meal time and got their kosher meals served, so how? I don't know where they got it\nfrom. And why the Jewish hospital remained in existence and was \u2014 never even the name\nchanged, Das Jiidische Krankenhaus\u201d\u201d it was called \u2014 and on Iranische Strasse\u2019\u2019 number two\n\u2014and it's still there. You can still go there and see the same building \u2014 rebuilt. It was bombed\nout after I left. And now I haven't done the research yet, so whatever my opinions are at the\nmoment are my own speculations. I think, number one, Lustig, Dr. Lustig was very much in\nwith the Nazi supervision of the hospital. He was as much of a puppet as anybody else of\ncourse. And I am still friendly with one of the nurses now that was there, and she was\n* Can\u2019t anyone do anything for us? (German)\n* Can Aunt Lina do nothing for us? (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 The Jewish Hospital (German)\n*\u2019 Street (German)\nfriendly with him. And she tells of the story which I totally believe, which is completely\nwithin the context of what I remembered. She says many times she would be with him and\nhe would answer the telephone with, \"Hello. Dr. Lustig,\" and he would immediately put it\ndown again. Then the phone would ring again and he would say, \u201cDer Jude Lustig, hier.\u201d\nYou see. They didn't accept if he just... If they were calling him, they didn't want just \u201cDr.\nLustig.\u201d They wanted \u201cDer Jude Lustig, hier.\u201d So he was a puppet. There's no question\nabout it. Within the Jews he was all powerful naturally. He was the one that made up the\nlists. He was the one that put cross checks on who should go into transports of nurses,\ndoctors, personnel, patients. He was the all powerful one. But within the context of the\nNazis, he was a puppet. He was nothing. He did their doing. And if he didn't, he was the one\nthat was punished. So, it's hard to know how to judge him. I'm tempted to judge him\nbenevolently. Many people hated him. Many people feared him. He \u2014 of course, you know\nhe was such a powerful man, stories build up. And I remember so well, when we first came\nto the hospital, we were in Niedershonhausen, student \u2014 we were 17, 18 years old. And again\nI have to caution you to realize what that meant back in the 30s and in Berlin we were so, so\nsimple, so naive. And then when we were transferred to the big hospital, the rumor went that,\n\"Dr. Lustig will inspect all the student nurses completely naked. And only the ones that he\nlikes naked he would take in.\" Of course it was a stupid rumor, and it did not occur at all, but\nthat was his, his aura. That was his reputation. He was all powerful. He could demand\nanything he wanted and we had to do it. But 1t wasn't so. He was just a very nice man. He\nwas very powerful, yes, but also quite nice.",
        "Q: Did you have direct dealings with him?",
        "A: No, I never did. No, I never did. But the nurses that \u2014 he had many girlfriends among the\nnurses. And the general rule was to try to be very friendly with his girlfriends And I never\nmanaged that. And I always felt very ostracized and very badly. We lived in the nursing\nhome and we nurses, of course, chummed together. And you have to realize I am still\nfriendly with some of these people. My best friend \u2014 my best girlfriend whom I liked so\nmuch then, and whom I still like so much now. We're both in our 70s, but we're still like kids\ntogether \u2014 and again, an example of how naive we were. She and I roomed together in\nNiedershonhausen, and we were working hard. We had seven to seven shifts \u2014 seven in the\nmorning to seven at night, or vice versa. And then after the shift we had to do our theoretical\nwork, and we were tired. So we went into bed with each other, studied for a while, and then\nfell asleep just to save time. And we still chuckle over that, you know. We tell it to our\nhusbands. And in the morning, we were woken up by the night nurses because we didn't\nwake up by ourselves at all \u2014 forget 1t \u2014 and they found us in bed together. Well, we were\ncalled before the, the Leiter\u201d \u2014 I think back to German, to the German things \u2014 I sometimes\n*> The Jew Lustig, here. (German)\n*\u201d The Jew Lustig, here. (German)\n* Director (German)\nmiss my English \u2014 to the administrator of the Niedershonhausen Institution, and he scolded\nus, you know. But we didn't know why. We didn't know what we had done wrong. He\nthought we were fooling around together. That was the furthest thing from our minds. This\njust to show you how very naive we were. So here was that rumor we had to be undressed\nand we were fearful like anything, but it didn't happen. So then the next thing was we had to\nbe friendly with the girlfriends of Lustig. And somehow she managed it and I didn't. And\nthen we got together in the evening in our nursing dormitories and she would tell me\neverything \u2014 whatever was going on. They joked and they made friends and they laughed\nand they talked about the patients and the doctors. And I felt terrible. I never was included.\nAnd now I'm not so sorry anymore because this particular Head Nurse was not a very fine\nperson. She then fraternized with the SS, and I'm not a bit sorry that I was not one of her\nfriends. The SS man at the Jewish hospital was Dobberke(ph) \u2014 SS man Dobberke, and he\nwas feared. He walked around and he would send us into transport on his own without going\nthrough Lustig. If the star wasn't sewed on nicely, or if he could smell cigarettes on our\nbreath, or if we didn't stand up and greet him properly, or for any old reason, he would take\nus into transport. And I heard later on, after I left, that this particular Head Nurse from the \u2014\nfrom the Kinderstation*' \u2014 her nurse's name was Elly(ph), Schwester Elly, she then became\nhis girlfriend. And that was not something that sits easily with any of us. That was very bad.",
        "Q: When you say that Lustig had girlfriends, you mean \u2014 you don't mean they were simply\nfriends. You mean that they were his\u2014",
        "A: They were his girlfriends. They slept with him.",
        "Q: So there were a number of nurses.",
        "A: Yes. That was known knowledge. We didn't think much of that. We just stayed away. I mean\nwe who were still so rural and especially we who were religious, you know, we just stayed\naway, you know. We had nothing to do with it.",
        "Q: And what was your friend's name in the hospital?",
        "A: Golly \u2014 my friend Golly. I'm still very friendly with her. She then \u2014 you ought to get her and\nget her story sometime.",
        "Q: How come she became friends with these girlfriends and you didn't?",
        "A: She was just a very \u2014 She was a Mischlinge, first of all. She was a very outgoing, lovely,\nvery much liked person. And she was just a very sweet person. She and I liked each other\n*! Children\u2019s ward (German)\n* Nurse (German)\nvery much. We were very opposite from each other. She was so blond and outgoing, and I\nwas much more heavy and the worrying type. And we just needed each other. We were just\nvery friendly. She didn't put much stock into her acceptance into that inner circle at all. She\nwas a very wonderful girl and she \u2014 they liked her a lot, so they took her in.",
        "Q: Could you explain the structure of the hospital. What was going on, before we get into some\nparticular things? Was the SS man there every day?",
        "A: I wasn't so much aware of that. I don't know. Later on, after I left, I heard that he was there\nevery day \u2014 that he actually lived somewheres there in one of the buildings \u2014 that same\nDobberke. But while I was there, the thing I remember most, we had constant visits from the\nSS I remember Eichmann\u201d coming through many times \u2014 young, beautiful, smoking his\ncigarette, sleeked through like, like sleeked up with tongues almost \u2014 not a speck on him \u2014\nand very arrogant. And we had to stand up and leave whatever we were doing and stand\nwhile he was in the room. And then he left again \u2014 just harassing us and doing what he\nthought was wonderful, was great, harassing the Jews.",
        "Q: And how did you know that this was Eichmann?",
        "A: We knew that. We knew that. We met him again then \u2014 he, he \u2014 you see he, which I didn't\nknow then, he was in charge of the whole Amt\u201d 4B, the whole Jewish section \u2014 he and\nMurse(ph), but that, you know, we didn't know that. But we just knew that he was constantly\non our necks. That was his job. By then I believe the Jewish Community was already\ndissolved and so he had only us to play around with, and he did that job very nicely.",
        "Q: So you're in the hospital seven in the morning until...",
        "A: Ya. We had 12 hour duties. Then I was already a full nurse. I graduated. And then I was an\nemployee of the hospital. In October, 1941 I got my diploma and it says on it, \u201cJudische\nSauglings und Kleinkinder Schwester.\u201d\u00b0\" Now I have to switch into English, \"Permitted to\nwork only with Jewish children and babies,\" you see. That was the restriction. I could not go\nout anywheres and get a job. It was just for the Jews. I still have that as a matter of fact. And\nthen I was an employee. I drew a salary and I worked on the Kinderstation \u2014 on the baby \u2014\non the children's station, not on the baby station.",
        "Q: And you were living in the hospital all the time?\n* Adolf Eichmann\n\u201c Bureau (German)\n* Jewish Infants and Toddlers Nurse (German)",
        "A: In the hospital. And then we also had duties for a few Jewish, like daycare centers that were\naround the city, and we got a special permit to go to these centers as nurses and take care of\nthe children, but they were resolved very soon afterwards. But that was part of our nursing\nduty.",
        "Q: So could you explain what a day might be like?",
        "A: As much as I remember. We got up in the morning and went to the Speisesaal.\u201d\u00b0 We had a\ndormitory kind of a living where we lived and we called it der Reitsall*\u2019 \u2014 the horses station,\nit was so big you know. And Golly and I roomed close together, and we had to put our\nuniforms on, sew on the yellow star very quickly and neatly \u2014 it didn't leave any holes in it.",
        "Q: You mean daily you had to sew on the star?",
        "A: Whenever we changed the uniform. We got two stars that we had to buy from the Jewish\nCommunity for zehn Pfennigs,\u201d* for 10 pennies, and we better take care of them. If we didn't\nhave them, forget it, we were shot. And then we went to have breakfast, and then we started\nto work \u2014 whatever our duties use to be. The children were in long rows of beds and we were\nassigned to maybe six children that were ours that we had to take care of the whole day long.\nAnd then the doctors would come in and we had to report on the kids. It wasn't so\nsophisticated. Don't think we knew all that much. And then at noontime we had, I don't recall\n\u2014 I guess we went back to the Speisesaal for lunch, and then the inner circle always went into\nSchwester Elly's little room and smoked cigarettes with the doors closed. And then in the\nevening we went and had supper again. And we couldn't go out. There was a curfew. We had\nto be there at eight \u2014 back at eight. So everything that we did, we did within the hospital.\nAnd the hospital was a complex \u2014 a whole compound. So we did get out for fresh air just by\nwalking across the halls, across the \u2014 to the different buildings. And of course there were\nlittle romances with the young physicians. Everything was so \u2014 it was so enclosed. It was so\nunnatural you see. It was \u2014 everything was so confined. So naturally romances sprung up and\ndied down again, and many people left on transports, and once they were here one day and\nthe next day they were gone. We somehow got use to that.",
        "Q: Did you also have a boyfriend?",
        "A: I was friendly with one of the physicians. I wouldn't say he was a boyfriend, but I was\nfriendly with one of the physicians. Golly was very friendly with one of the physicians. And\none of the other nurses was very much involved with one of the housekeep\u2014 one of the male\n*\u00b0 Dinning hall (German)\n*\u2019 The riding stable (German)\n*\u00b0 Ten pfennigs (German)\nhousekeepers \u2014 and finally married. There were marriages. There were marriages there. So in\na way, as unnatural as it sounded, it was still a fairly normal existence. Well, I'm gonna take\nthat back. It wasn't normal with people disappearing every day to go on transports. And then\nmany people made secret plans to go underground. That was a big deal. And many people\nmade secret plans to go across the border into Switzerland, and many were caught. And then\nalso I'm going to take back what I said \u2014 that it was a normal life \u2014 because it wasn't.\nBecause the patients we got, most of them were suicides that we had to get back to life in\norder so we could ship them to the collection center to be going to transports. And you know\nwe sat and agonized over that. Is it really our duty to bring those people back to life? But,\nyes it was, or we were punished ourselves. The SS were always there to supervise us and do\nthis. It was a very unnatural time, and always the fear that we would be the next ones to have\nthe transport notice, and it was just a very bad time.",
        "Q: Did you work on the patients who came 1n?",
        "A: No. I didn't.",
        "Q: You were working with the children\u2014",
        "A: But the physician that I was friendly with was somebody in charge of that, and he always\ntold about it. And you know it was always food for conversation. What are we gonna talk\nabout, you know, and so what could we possibly talk about? We couldn't go to a movie. We\ndidn't know nothing of concerts, or any of the culture that normal people grow up with. We\ncouldn't go shopping. We didn't have any new clothes to show off. What are we going to talk\nabout? Transports and going underground, and we had no family left. We couldn't talk about\nfamily anymore, so we talked about that all the time. It was like ruminating \u2014 the same thing\nall the time. It was a very unnatural life actually.",
        "Q: Who were the children that you took care of?",
        "A: Those were children from the Jewish Community that were sick. And, little by little, that\nchanged, and little by little it was Mischlinge that came in \u2014 children of mixed marriages.\nAnd then by \u201843 I left. And little by little the whole complex of the nurses, and the whole\ncomplexion of the staff changed too. We were replaced by Mischlinge \u2014 by people who were\nfrom mixed marriages with whom they didn't know what to do with. They couldn't put them\non the lists yet. They did later. In fact, this nice Dr. Elkan(ph) that I was friendly with\ndumped me for a Mischlinge. I never forgot and forgave him. It was just as well. It was just\nas well. There was no time to form emotional bondages. And in fact I\u2014 she came to this\ncountry, too. I corresponded with her for a while. You formed such weird friendships \u2014 such\nweird relationships \u2014 and they lasted. They really lasted. I was very friendly with, with \u2014 not\nthe Head Nurse, but the one that came under her. I don't know what you would call her \u2014\nmaybe the Assistant Head Nurse \u2014 Schwester Lea(ph). And we picked each other up again\nhere in this country. We had really nothing in common otherwise, but that huge balloon of\nmemories. We could talk with each other and it was like in the comic strips, you know, over\nour heads was the same picture. You see? Was so weird. And then Golly would come in and\nover her head was the same picture, and we would talk about that. Does that give you some\nidea what it was like?",
        "Q: It was a particular intensity.",
        "A: It was very intense. When finally, when I got my notice, I was glad. It was like, \"finally.\"\nAnd then an SS man came, and I was on his list, and he came to the station where I was\nworking. It was in the middle of the day, when he told me that I was on his list. And he took\nme to my room in the dormitory, and everybody had their, their rucksack packed. My\nrucksack was packed, and he gave me just a few minutes. He timed me. And then I had to go\ninto that van that was downstairs. And it was like, \u201cfinally,\u201d you know \u2014 \u201cfinally I can go.\u201d\n\u2018Cause I knew I would be going. I knew I wasn't going to go underground. I had no chance,\nand I wasn't going to do that anyway. And I couldn't get into Switzerland over the border. I\nwas completely alone. Everybody had left already. Father was in America. Mother was in\nRiga \u2014 or so I thought. My sister in Auschwitz \u2014 or so I thought. And I thought I was coming\nto Auschwitz as well. There was no idea I was going to Theresienstadt. Everybody was\ngoing to Auschwitz \u2014 to Arbeitstransport or Osttransport. It wasn't called killing transport by\nany means. And so I thought I would see them all again. So I was very relieved. And I went\ninto that transport without a minute looking back.",
        "Q: Before we get on the transport, even though you brought us there, let's go back a little to the\nsituation and how it changes in Berlin with respect to your being brought to some assembly\nplace and selections are being done \u2014 so some people are chosen to leave \u2014 and then you\nkeep going back to work. And what was that like? What was happening with this constantly\nbeing brought back, and then you go back to work again?",
        "A: Are you talking about when we were called to the Jewish Community Center?",
        "Q: Umm [affirmative].",
        "A: Oh, that was difficult. And then Lustig was also very much involved. All these Befehle,\u201d\u2019 all\nthese SS orders to do things came through Lustig. The SS never spoke to anyone else, you\nsee. He was their man. So Lustig let it be known throughout the hospital \u2014 that was in\nOctober of \u201842, that \u2014 up to then it was sort of, you know, it was sort of dispersed. But now,\nall of sudden, it got general. It got bunched up together \u2014 that we were all going to be\nWo oe\nOrder (German)\nappearing the next morning at seven o'clock in full uniforms at the Jewish Community\nCenter on Oranien Strasse . And that was a big room. We got there of course. There was no\nway we would not go there. It didn't occur to us not to go. That's another thing. We were so\nconditioned to obey. If I look at those kids nowadays, they refuse to obey their mothers, or\ntheir teachers, or their governors, or their President... It was the furthest thing from our minds\nnot to obey an order, you see. And when I speak to students, I always encourage them to\ncontinue doing that. So we obeyed. We went in our uniform with our star, seven o'clock in\nthe morning, the whole bunch of us, and it was a big room, and we just stood there. We\ndidn't know why. We had no idea why we were called. Lustig didn't tell us and nobody else\nknew. And we stood and we stood, and it was, we couldn't go to the toilet, we couldn't get\nany coffee, and I'm quickly reaching for my nice cup of tea so it won't be taken away from\nme. We were desperate. At 12 o'clock, three SS men showed up. We knew Eichmann. He\nwas very familiar to us. We also knew Giinther.\u201d\u2019 He was also familiar. There were two SS\nGunthers \u2014 one from Berlin and one from Prague. This was Gunther from Berlin. And then\nthere were three Jews from Vienna. And then there was an SS man whom we didn't know.\nAnd of course we couldn't whisper among each other, \"Who was that? What's going on?\"\nThat was completely out. And at first they didn't talk to us at all. They just stood there in\nfront of us and smoked and laughed and joked. Very young, our age. I was 20 at that point.\nAnd then they called before them the heads of each of the Jewish departments \u2014 of each\ndepartment, including Lustig who was head of the hospital.\nAnd then, then first of all, that guy introduced himself. He was Brunner \u2014 Anton Brunner\u201d!\nfrom Vienna. And he had come from Vienna with those three Jews. Then he told us why he\nwas there, and in his own Viennese dialect, which is still ringing in my ears he said, and of\ncourse I'll say it in English, that he came to show the SS in Berlin how to deal with the Jews\n\u2014 how they had dealt with the Jews in Vienna. And that's why he came and brought the three\nJews with him. How to deal with the Jews? We thought they had been doing fine up to now.\nBut his innovation was \u2014 his fork in the road \u2014 was that from now on the Jews had to do the\ndirty work. And he demonstrated it right away. He told the leaders of each department to\npick their own, to pick their own \u2014 30 percent of each department to go into transport. He\nwasn't gonna bother picking anymore. He had each of the Jews pick their own Jews. And\nthat didn't sink in right away, but after it sank in it was really ein Wendepunkt\u201d \u2014 a turning\npoint \u2014 a pivotal point in the history of the Holocaust. From then on it was Jews stuffing\nJews into the, into the cattle cars. It was Jews taking the Jews out of the cattle cars, too, and\ndoing all the, all the agents of their own destruction they were from then on. And under that\nfalls the Kapos\u201d\u201d and the Jewish elders, and even we, we got white armbands. We had to go\n\u201d Rolf Giinther\n*' Alois (Anton) Brunner\n** Turning point, milestone (German)\n*\u00b0 Formen (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor\nsquadron of prisoners.\naround helping them and we had to do our own. That was very diabolic.",
        "Q: Can you explain what you mean \u2014 what it was that you had to do?",
        "A: Well we were sent home. Somehow I wasn't picked to go into transport so I was sent back to\nthe hospital, and a few weeks later we were sent again. We were sent three times. Yes, and\nthen the second time \u2014 the first time he took hostages. Brunner took hostages. The first time\nhe still let the people go home. The people had to pick their own people to go into transport\nand he allowed them to go home \u2014 to pack and to say \u201cgoodbye.\u201d But he kept 20 of the high\nofficials of the Jewish Community hostages. And he said that if not everybody would show\nup, those 20 people would be killed. At the time I still remembered their names and I think I\nwrote it into my, into my notes. I could look it up. But it\u2019s not important at the moment. And\nsome actually did either kill themselves \u2014 some of the people who were supposed to go to\ntransport either killed themselves or went underground, or just ran away. And he actually did\nkill those 20 people. He sent the ashes to their families. So we knew he meant business. And\nthat was the same thing later in Theresienstadt. If something went wrong \u2014 20, 200, 2,000 \u2014\nwere killed for one person. So that's the reason why I didn't \u2014 why we didn't think of, of\nobjecting, of doing anything against them. We couldn't be responsible for the death of our\nown people. But anyway, so then we were sent back, and the second time we were sent back,\nhe called the head of the Jewish Community before him \u2014 that was Dr. Kraindl \u2014 and Kraindl\nwas struck by a heart attack in front of these SS people and fell dead. And he said, \"Move\nhim. Go away. Take away that dead person. Just another dead Jew.\" And then the third time\nwe were told to go the Kasernen\u201d\u2019 \u2014 to the barracks to help with the transportation of the\nJews.\nNow that was in February of \u201843 during the big Fabrikaktion.\u201d\u00b0 The Fabrikaktion was that\nthey went into the \u2014 into those factories and took out the people who were working there\nwho thought they were protected \u2014 who had been promised protection because they worked\nfor the \u2014 for the military units. And they came by the thousands. They came in huge furniture\nvans stuffed with Jews, just they way they were from the factories \u2014 in their aprons \u2014 with\ntheir clothes \u2014 and always with the star of course. And we had to take care of them. We had...\nOne of my friends, her name was Klara, I remember it. We were assigned to the Rathenower\nKaserne in Berlin. I had never been there. We had to go there by special permit to use the\npublic transportation. And there was this huge barrack, and the Jews were not allowed to use\nthe toilets. That was the first thing. No food of course \u2014 no toilets \u2014 nothing. So then some\nJewish people came who dug a ditch in the backyard. That was the toilet. And then finally\nsome coffee came. But in between that we already had some thousands of Jews who were\n~* Barracks (German)\n\u00bb\u00b0 Factory action (German); factory round-up.\nbeside themselves \u2014 direct from the factory \u2014 without their mothers or fathers or children or\nhusbands, or anybody. That was really pandemonium in that \u2014 1n those barracks. Then I\nremember we had to go out and take in all these people that came by the hundreds. And I\nremember one van opened up and blood stained people fell out. They had resisted and the SS\nshot them. Big deal, you know. And we weren't allowed to do anything to them \u2014 we just...\nWe had no material anyway. So they were then shipped off too, the way they were \u2014\nbleeding. And then we were... We worked there for two days straight \u2014 for three days\nstraight, and then finally we were released from duty and some other nurses came with their\nwhite armbands and we got back. And then we went again the next three days. It was three\nday shifts. And then finally that Fabrikaktion was over \u2018cause there were no more Jews to\ntake. That was in February, \u201843, and then a few weeks later I was finally taken too. I had\nenough by then. Now you can understand why I say it was a relief.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were wearing white armbands \u2014 the nurses, the helpers were\nwearing white armbands. And you mentioned that in some way, you even had to help with\nwhat the Nazis were doing in terms of getting people. What did you mean by that?",
        "A: What did I mean by that? Well ordinarily they should have done that themselves. Why\nshould we \u2014 we Jews \u2014 do this? That was terrible. That was the worst of the whole thing.",
        "Q: No, I understand. That I understand. I mean, what in fact did you have to do?",
        "A: We had to take care of them. We had to put them onto straw mattresses. We had to get the\nstraw and put it around, and assign places to them. They didn't know what was happening.\nNeither did we for that matter, but at least we were told to make some order in this huge\nbarracks. This was like a, like a military barrack. It was a military barrack. And we were in\nthe big, big room, and we had to bring them in from the vans, and take them to a place, and\nsay, \"Now this is your place. You stay here until we come back to you and tell you what to\ndo.\" They had nothing with them. They came directly from work. And we didn't know very\nmuch either, so we did the best we could. We had no food to give them for a long while.\nWhat happened was they, they begged us to see that their children would be taken care of, or\ntheir old mothers would be taken care of. But how could we do that? We couldn't leave the\nbarracks either. So they scribbled on little notepads where to go to. But if the SS saw that\nthey would shoot right away. So we quickly stuck them into our pockets, and afterwards we\ndrove around and tried to help as much as we could. It was nothing that you can normally\nforesee. This \u2014 these Fabrikaktion involved 20,000 people that were shipped out of Berlin\nduring those three days.",
        "Q: You said that Lustig, Dr. Lustig, at a certain point began choosing people who would\nactually go on the transport.",
        "A: Yes. That was his job.",
        "Q: Now he was choosing inside the hospital, or\u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Just inside the hospital.",
        "A: Inside the hospital.",
        "Q: What did that mean for you as nurses?",
        "A: That any day we could be called up. That any day we would be on the list. He got us on a\ncertain quota, which we didn't know at the time. We didn't realize that at all. We knew\nsomehow he was involved with the SS, but just how, how the connections worked, we didn't\nknow. After we had heard Brunner say that the Jews had to pick their own Jews, then we\nknew. Then it was no longer so secretive. He got his orders to choose, let's say, 500 Jews for\ntomorrow morning at eight o'clock. The trucks would come and 500 Jews had to be ready.\nSo he just had to pick somebody. They weren't voluntarily going. So he probably had a quota\nof so many patients, and so many physicians, and so many nurses, and so many help \u2014\nhelpers.",
        "Q: Did you, as the staff, have to help in getting people to these transports?",
        "A: No, I didn't. I didn't. As a matter of fact, yes. When I went into the Theresienstadt transport,\nthen a lot of the kids from the children's station also went, and I simply was put in charge of\nthose kids. But at that point we didn't know it was a Theresienstadt transport. We only\nrealized that when we got to the Gerlach Strasse instead of to the Oranienburger Strasse. See\nwe knew we had to help in those places a number of times. I never did, but some of the other\nnur\u2014 I was sent to Rathenower Kaserne, but many of my colleagues were sent to those\ncollection centers, and so we knew where the trains were going to from the collection\ncenters, and I ended up at Gerlach Strasse, and I knew that was Theresienstadt. How come?\nHow come? And then I met some of the Jewish Community personnel that I was very\nfriendly with. Their names were Simmon \u2014 Werner and Eva Simmon \u2014 very close friends \u2014\nand they were there too. The first emotion was one of happiness. \"Oh, thank God I know\nsomebody. I'm not in a sea of unknown people.\" But of course the next emotion was, \u201cWhere\nare we going?\u201d And Werner Simmon who was an employee of the hospital \u2014 of the Jewish\nCommunity Center, said, \"We're going to Theresienstadt. We're lucky\" I didn't even ask how\ncome. Who cares?",
        "Q: Eva is the woman who had the\u2014",
        "A: I'm sorry?",
        "Q: Eva is the woman who had the baby in the Hospital.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: In the hospital.",
        "A: I became friendly with Werner and Eva Simmon because I delivered her baby. And I just\nwas very, very friendly with them. I walked through their house many times skirting all the\ngreenery, and when I saw them there, what a relief.",
        "Q: Tell me, how many people were, do you think approximately \u2014 were working or living in\nthis Jewish Community Complex where the hospital was? Do you have any idea? Was it a\nlot of people?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you think in the thousands?",
        "A: Yes. I would say in the thousands. It was a large, huge hospital \u2014 very many departments \u2014\nvery huge building for the dormitories for the nurses, and another huge building where the\ndoctors had their little apartments. And then there was Pathologie.\u201d\u00b0 That was a whole\nsection in itself \u2014 a whole building \u2014 which was later, actually after I left I was told \u2014 that\nwas later one of the collection centers too. And then there was like a house for the SS where\nD\u00e9bberke lived, and a whole house for Wirtschaft, \u201d\u2019 you know, where they cleaned and\nwhere the steam was generated, and where the laundry building was \u2014 really huge buildings.",
        "Q: And the Jewish Community leadership was there too?",
        "A: No. That wasn't there. That was on Oranienburger Strasse. That was also a huge complex.\nThat was under Rabbiner Baeck \u2014 Leo Baeck. No, not always. That was first under \u2014 I think\nit was under Kotzover.\u201d* I'm not sure. I wasn't that familiar with the Jewish Community. But\nwe always knew of and about Rabbiner Baeck, who was also a controversial figure. How\nmuch did he help the Nazis? How much did he know? How, if at all, did he protect the Jews?\nThose are questions that still bother me a great deal. Did they know, and if they knew what\ncould they have done? What would they have done? They couldn't all like, like\nCzerniakow\u201d\u2019 in Warsaw, kill themselves to end this all. And he only did it because his wife\n\u00b0\u00b0 Pathology (German)\n>\u2019 Trade and industry (German)\n8 Philip Kotzover\n\u00bb\u00b0 Adam Czerniakow\nwas taken hostage. It wasn't simple. It was not a white and black situation. It wasn't a simple\nsituation. These people had to do the Nazis' bidding. They had no way out in many cases.\nTheir own families were taken hostages. And in many cases they thought they were helping\nthe Jews. In many cases they thought they would deal much more kindly with the Jews than\nthe Nazis would, and they could ease our suffering in some ways. But those are all questions\nthat I want to research now and see if I can find any answers. But really there was no way\nout. There was just no way out.",
        "Q: Do you think you would have wanted someone to tell you what was really going on if they\nknew?",
        "A: You know we heard the word \u201cvergasung.\u201d\u201d\u201d I remember that so clearly. I almost remember\nthe place where I sat and the person who told it to me. \"Die werden alle vergast,\u201d\"\" said\nsomeone to me. You know it went in one ear and out the other. What is Vergasung?\u201d\u201d How\ndo you picture human beings being vergast?\u201d\u201d Didn't mean a thing.",
        "Q: Do you think if Leo Baeck had told you \u2014 not just this rumor, but a leader would have said\nsomething, would that have mattered, or would it have meant nothing because\u2014?",
        "A: That's a big question. That's a very big question. That's the very, very big question. If people\nasked him what to do he told them to go. Should he have? Should he not have? I don't know\nthe answer. I don't know the answer. We ourselves could have refused to help in those\nKaserne. Maybe we did the wrong thing too. It didn't occur to us not to obey.",
        "Q: Did anybody refuse to help that you know of?",
        "A: Nobody refused to help. It didn't occur to us. We were so conditioned to obey, and I think... I\nalmost think that's how Hitler got so powerful, because the Germans too were so conditioned\nto obey. They always obeyed one voice \u2014 the Kaiser for years, for centuries, for thousands of\nyears. They were always told what to do, so Hitler came and he told them what to do, so they\nobeyed. And we were no different. We were, we were Germans too. We were also\nconditioned to obey.",
        "Q: Was that typical in a German family?",
        "A: Yes, very typical \u2014 very, very typical. It was not a democracy. And Jewishly it was also very\ntypical. You always obeyed. You always... And historically it was typical. The Jews were\nOn\nGassing (German)\n| They will all be gassed. (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Gassing (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Gassed (German)\npersecuted before, but by laying low and by obeying \u2014 sure some were killed and some were\nstrung up and burned and mutilated, but the Jewish Community kept them going. It wasn't\nthe whole thing, but they were always conditioned to obey. And so you paid a little money,\nand you, you did something to let the cloud go over, and it always did. This was the first time\nit didn't work. We didn't know how to object \u2014 not as Germans and not as Jews, truly. And I\nreally think that was part of the problem. And if people ask me if it can happen here I say,\n\"No.\" The people here are conditioned to question, and conditioned to \u2014 they have an inborn\ncommon sense and they're always conditioned by hundreds of years of democracy to stand\nup for what they think is right. And I really don't think it could happen here. But it sure was\nhappening there.",
        "Q: Was your friend Golly \u2014 1s it Golly? Was she transported out before you?",
        "A: We went on the same transport, even though she was a Mischlinge. She volunteered. She\nwas friendly with one of the doctors and she followed him. She married him in\nTheresienstadt. She's wonderful \u2014 very unusual person. She volunteered. She didn't have to\ngO.",
        "Q: What did you think of that at the time?",
        "A: I loved her before and I loved her afterwards. She was just a very wonderful person. And\nthen we went together, but then she \u2014 before she married him we roomed together, too. And\nthen she married that guy and she went. In Theresienstadt you could live with your husband\nsomehow if you managed it well. And then I picked up a new friend, very soon. I picked up\nEva, as you know from my book. I was always very lucky with friends.",
        "Q: When you went on a transport, you had to take care of these children?",
        "A: We did, but there wasn't much to take care of. We had nothing to do \u2014 to give them. We had\nno food to give them. We had no medical equipment. We were not transported on a\u2014 ina\ncattle car. We were actually in a regular car \u2014 in a regular train with seats and all. So we just\nmade sure that the kids all sat quietly and didn't cry. There was very little to do. And when\nwe got to Theresienstadt, I still walked with them into the Ghetto, but then they were picked\nup and taken to the Children's Home and we were separated into \u2014 to the barracks there.",
        "Q: How many kids were there on that transport with you? Do you have any idea?",
        "A: I don't recall that. I actually had so little to do with them. Perhaps 30 \u2014 I'm gonna say 30 kids.",
        "Q: And these were the kids who had been hospitalized?",
        "A: Yes, those were the patients.",
        "Q: Were they orphans, or not necessarily?",
        "A: We only knew them as patients. It could well be that in many cases the people went\nunderground. Many people left their children. Many people went underground and hoped\ntheir kids would get by as orphans of Germans, you see. Then they could be picked up into\nGerman \u2014 into the German sector and could be saved. And it may have been some of that.\nAnd then I don't remember much about that.",
        "Q: Was it a difficult journey on this train?",
        "A: No, I felt good about the journey. Remember, I was still thinking I would see my mother and\nmy sister, and everybody. I had so many uncles and aunts, and.... My grandmother had died\nand my Aunt Adelheid had died, so \u2014 in Germany still. They were buried in Germany. But\nuncles and aunts, and all the friends that had gone before. And also remember, I was with\nEva and Werner and their child. It may not sound like much, but you sucked out every little\nbit of enjoyment, you know. That was enjoyment. Enjoyment was measured in decimals \u2014\nnot in going to the Opera. No, this was fun. I was going to be together with Eva and Werner\nfor a few hours \u2014 a few days. And I don't remember too much otherwise about the journey,\njust that we got there and we had to walk then from Bauschewitz to Theresienstadt. And then\nthe children were already taken care of. Somebody took the whole group of children, and we\nwere on our own. Then we turned and helped the older people. Don't forget there were also\nold patients out of the hospital, and people who couldn't walk. And then Eva and I helped the\nolder people. And she had her little boy with her anyway who was \u2014 see he was born in \u201841.\nHe was two years old. He was a little kid. And then I remember getting into Theresienstadt,\nand it looked all very, very foreign \u2014 very different. It was a fortress. It was a, it was a\nmedieval fortress \u2014 an enclosure with a moat, and you had go over a bridge to get in, and you\ndidn't see very much because there were these high walls. All I could see was the church\nsteeple. And around, there was this huge walls. And once we were inside we could tell that\nalong the walls, all around the ghetto in an octagon, were these barracks \u2014 these huge stone\nbuildings, two stories high \u2014 and they were again closed up toward the street, you see. You\nhad to go into the barracks just like you had to go into Theresienstadt to see what was inside.\nYou had to again go into the barracks, and then you ended up like in a huge courtyard, and\naround you again was barracks. Can you follow this? And you could \u2014 perhaps I can, I can\ncompare it to a monastery where you can walk all around and you still, you're still inside.\nYou're still \u2014 always facing that huge exercise grounds. It was a military barracks where the\npeople had to do their military exercises, you see, and you could almost watch that from\nevery point. And we were sent into the upstairs rooms, and we were laid on straws. That was\nall we had. And that was our Ubikation\u2122 it was called \u2014 unsere Wohnung\u201d \u2014 our residence\n\u201c Rooming space (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Our domicile (German)\nfor the moment.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Mrs. Haas, I want to go back so that you can help us understand something. When you were\nat the Kaserne with helping with Klara, helping the people. They gave you little notes and\nyou at some risk, you and Klara, went around giving these notes to parents, children.",
        "A: They mostly gave us their addresses \u201ccause they had kids at home, or old parents at home.\nThey were taken without any notice and they were panicked. They didn't know what their\nkids were doing. So we took those notes, and after we were through, we couldn't follow up\nall of them. There were thousands of people. But the few that we did, we took the children\nwith us to the children's station at the hospital, \u2018cause they were totally alone. In some cases,\nthey were, you know, little youngsters \u2014 three, four, five, six years old \u2014 and we took them\nwith us. And those were then the children that went on to the next transport. They were free\ngame. It was terrible.",
        "Q: And these were the children\u2014",
        "A: These were the transport\u2014",
        "Q: that you \u2014 that you were on the transport with?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. You were describing this moat and this fortress like structure at Theresienstadt when\nyou arrived. Now before you actually began to walk around and go wherever you had to go,\nthere was somebody you met when you first got off the train \u2014 some young man.",
        "A: Yes, the helpers that were suppose to help us. And he told us a little about Theresienstadt.\nWhat did we know about Theresienstadt? Not a thing. We only knew the name. And he told\nus a little bit about the history and what to expect. Like, for instance, he told us about the\nSchleusse.\u201d\u201d What on earth was the Schleusse? Nobody ever \u2014 you see, there was a whole\nnew vocabulary that grew up as I have mentioned before, and Schleusse was one of the\nwords that we never heard of. It was where they took everything away from us. What does\nSchleusse mean literally? It means a control point where you had to go through, like a toll\npoint where you were told in which barrack you were going to live. You were given your\nnumber. Everybody had a number, and if somebody asks us.... You see, any of the SS that\nsaw us in the camp could at any time ask us to identify ourselves. He didn't want to know our\nname. He didn't want to know I was Gerda Schild. He wanted to know my ghetto number.\nWhat was it? \u201cQ\u201d \u2014 I have it somewheres \u2014 \u201cQ 1,000\u201d or 11, 12 something. That's what we\nhad to memorize. And that was given to us in the Schleusse, and at the same time we were\n66 ay:\nSluice (German)\nrelived of most of our possessions.",
        "Q: Did you have to wear this number?",
        "A: No. We didn't wear that number. We just had to know it at all times. It was on a little slip of\npaper that we kept.",
        "Q: And this person's name who was explaining...",
        "A: Pavel, Paul \u2014 Pavel. I lost him after that. He was just one of the Czech youngsters who came\nand talked with me. Of course they were all very glad to have \u2014 to get out of the ghetto and\nhave someone to talk to.",
        "Q: Now when he first met you, you heard him say something like, \"Did you have any\ncontrabands?\"",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was he referring to?",
        "A: Well contraband \u2014 another new expression \u2014 was for us anything they didn't allow for Jews\nto possess \u2014 lipstick, money, cigarettes, chocolate, even female napkins \u2014 anything like that\nwas called contraband. As a matter of fact, anything that belonged to a Jew was not allowed\nto belong to him, so most everything was contraband.",
        "Q: And did he want some of this?",
        "A: No. No, no. He was a nice honest guy \u2014 just a nice guy, he was really helping me. No, the\nJews were alright. We didn't have any problems with the Jews.",
        "Q: Were you treated brutally when you first arrived?",
        "A: No, I was not. No, thank God, I was never hit or beaten or molested in any way. We always\nexpected it and we were always on guard, but I was lucky.",
        "Q: So how long were you waiting with this guy Pavel in this grouping to take you?",
        "A: Well, the walk from Bauschewitz to Theresienstadt was maybe a good half hour, so he hung\naround me. He was probably a little attracted to me. I was still young. I was nice looking. I\nwas not starving or I was not skeletal or anything. And I wouldn't be surprised that he was\nhoping to see me again later, but 1t was not the case. It was very casual. And then it took\nseveral hours. Then we had to sit on our knapsacks for a while in the barrack grounds until\nthat whole transport was absorbed and registered in and that took awhile. And then toward\nevening we got into the barracks. But somehow I don't think I ever saw him again\nafterwards. There was thousands of people, how could I?",
        "Q: Did you have your own clothes?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: They didn't take away your\u2014?",
        "A: No. We kept our own clothes. They took away a lot, but we could keep some.",
        "Q: And what was the barracks like when you\u2014?",
        "A: The barracks were military barracks, huge rooms, straw for each person. That's how\neverybody first was checked in. And then we had to go into Hundertschaft.\u201d\u201d Literally\ntranslated that means detail of a hundred. And it was always a hundred people that worked at\na certain task. I was in the Hundertschaft of cleaning \u2014 sweeping the streets at first. You\ndidn't get there to relax or anything. You were checked 1n, get into your straw, put your\nthings down and off to work, you see. And so I swept the streets for a long time \u2014 not for too\nlong. Then it occurred to me, and you know somebody told me all this. You weren't wise,\nghetto wise right of quick. So somebody told me, \"Why don't you try to get into the health\nsystem and become a nurse again.\" And of course that sounded like a super idea. And I\napplied to the Jewish self-government. The ghetto was completely self-governed, but again,\njust like in Lustig's case, they were complete puppets of the SS And so I applied to get into\nthe nursing phase of the ghetto, and I was lucky. I still have my, my little notice that I could\nbe a nurse and wear a nurse's uniform. That was wonderful. And with that came a little better\nfood also.",
        "Q: Is this when you met your friend\u2014?",
        "A: And then, yes, we were \u2014 then I could move out of those barracks. That was already a huge\nimprovement. I was so sick of those barracks, with all these women, and there was a hostile\nfeeling there because everybody was so \u2014 was so humiliated, and was so sad, and there was\nno spirit there at all. So I was already very happy to get out of that situation. And then I was\ndetailed to the, to the home for children on Bergstrasse. And in that basement we, the nurses,\ncould make a little nest for ourselves. The basement rooms themselves were, of course, you\nknow very, very poor, very stark. And we had a couple of these bunkbeds \u2014 not a couple,\ntwo on each lining the wall. There were many people. And I, by sheer luck, ended up sharing\nmy bunk with a nurse from Vienna \u2014 Eva, Eva Atlas. And apparently I attract light hearted\n\u00b0\u2019 Group of 100 (German)\npeople because I, myself, I'm on the serious side. So Eva was a very lighthearted, nice,\nround-faced nurse from Vienna, and we liked each other right away. And somehow\neverything is easier to bear when you have a friend. I think a lot of us who survived,\nsurvived because we had a good friend to share things with. At first, when things were very\nhard, Eva and I made sure that we always had a little bread. If she was out of bread, I shared\nmine with her. If I didn't have any more to eat, naturally it was the other way around. So that\nalready helped. And then as our rations \u2014 as we worked harder and harder, the rations\nbecame better and better. We had what was called S-Rationen.\u00b0* And at the moment I don't\nremember what the \u201cS\u201d stood for. Maybe for \u201csneziell\u201d\u201d \u2014 \u201cspecial rations\u201d or something.\nBut it meant a little more bread and a little more soup, and extra coffee. And then things\nwere not so bad anymore. And then we both had friends and admirers. And I had Jirca who\nworked in the bakery, and he made tiny little Gs for my first name in bread then, \u2018cause I\nshared that with Eva too. And then things got much better. And, again, we were in a terrible\nsituation. We were completely alone \u2014 Eva as well as myself. We had no hope for a future.\nWe were so worried about daily calls to the Auschwitz transports. That was the big, big\nSword of Damocles that was always hanging over. And yet we were young. We were 20, 21\nyears old. We weren't too badly off. We had a bed to sleep in. We had some food. We had\nsome admirers. What more do you want at 21? So we kind of sailed along, and we did our\nwork. I went a lot, by the way, to that, to that old age home that was right across the street\nfrom the nurse's \u2014 from the children's home. Because I had discovered that Frau Frankel,\nwith whom my mother shared an \u2014 who took my mother tn, in Munich \u2014 and I was able to\nhelp her out in turn a little bit with my little \u201cG-rations\u201d of bread. And that was good, that\nwas good. And I met other old people there. The old people were hopeless. They had nothing\nto live for. And they didn't work, so they had very poor rations. So Eva and I did what we\ncould over there after work.",
        "Q: Did the old people live separate from...? How were the barracks divided, or how were the\nliving situations divided?",
        "A: At first everybody had to go into the barracks and lie on the floor on straw. And then the old\npeople went into the old aged home which was miserable, miserable. The barracks were\nbetter than that. Dark and dirty and just hopeless, smelly. And that was a terrible situation.\nAnd the young people were taken to appropriate works. You see the ghetto was completely\norganized and taken care of by Jews. There was ghetto Jewish police and Jewish firemen,\nand we took care of the kids, and, of course, Jewish nurses and doctors, and Jewish street-\nsweepers and the whole works. And the Judeniiltester\u2019? \u2014 Eppstein! and Edelstein\u201d and\n\u00b0* S-Rations (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Special (German)\n\u201d Jewish elder (German); term used for Nazi appointed Jewish community leaders.\n\"' Paul Eppstein\n\u201d Jakob Edelstein\nMurmelstein\u201d \u2014 three stones. Does that explain it to you?",
        "Q: Three stones?",
        "A: Well, all their names ended with \u201cstein,\u201d which is in German a stone. But that was\ncoincidental. We knew Eppstein from Berlin, and it was best during his administration.",
        "Q: Edelstein or Eppstein?",
        "A: Edelstein \u2014 I'm sorry. Edelstein from Berlin.",
        "Q: When you say that Eva Atlas was lighthearted, what did that mean? Did she, she laughed\neasily?",
        "A: Yes. She wasn't worried the way I was. She wasn't constantly ruminating in pessimism. She\nlived for the moment. She had enough bread right now and she had her work, and she had\nme, and we could go out before the curfew. We stopped work at seven and the curfew was at\neight, so we always went out a little bit. And then, I'm sure you're familiar with the history of\nthe ghetto. By 1943 we had to do what was called \u201cGhetto versch\u00e9nerung\u201d\u201d\u201d \u2014 the\nbeautification of the ghetto. So we got involved in that. And why was there all of a sudden\nthis emphasis on having the ghetto beautiful and representative? As you know, there come \u2014\nthe International Commission came that following summer. But before the International\nCommission came, a German pre-commission already came. So the whole ghetto suddenly\nwas buoyed. We were suddenly involved in sowing grass and planting flowers \u2014 and\npainting the houses and sewing curtains to put into only the downstairs where this\ncommission could walk by. So we suddenly, in our little basement room, we had a little\ncurtain. And then there was cultural beautification as well. Suddenly the SS allowed, and not\nonly allowed, but ordered the Jews to sing and dance, so to say, as their little puppets on a\nstring. But we didn't look behind that. We just knew we could sing again, and walk around,\nand look at the flowers \u2014 and that's what we did. And Eva, who had a very nice voice, was\ntaken into the choir, and so she had a pass past the curfew to rehearse in the choir and I\nalways went with her. And so she rehearsed the Elijah another, another phenomenon of\nTheresienstadt. The Elijah is an oratorium which, first of all was written by a Jew \u2014\nMendelssohn\u2019? \u2014 secondly, the context is Jewish. It speaks of that glorification of God, who\nis \u2014 who punishes the wicked, you see \u2014 who doesn't give fire to the sacrifice of the Baalites,\nand he punishes them in the end, and they have to go and disappear \u2014 and elaborates and\nhonors, and rewards the Jews \u2014 Elyah and the Jews. How they ever allowed this in the\nghetto, I will never know, but I didn't ask any questions. I went and heard Eva sing in the\nchoir, and the melodies are still very much with me. So that was Eva. She took what came.\n\u201d Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein\nStone, rock (German)\n\u201d Embellishment (German)\n\u2019\u00b0 Felix Mendelssohn",
        "Q: Now you and Jirca would go and listen to the rehearsals I gather, and then walked back.",
        "A: Yes, we went to rehearsals. And then we also went to when she really sang. It was performed\n\u2014 the rehearsals were before the Commission, and then it was performed during the\nCommission, along with a lot of other things. And we took part in all of it. I saw Tosca, and I\nsaw Carmen. And you must understand that I saw and heard this with the most magnificent\nvoices there was. The Jewish \u2014 the top \u2014 the cream of the Jewish voices had come to\nTheresienstadt. The best of the Jewish musicians \u2014 of directors and conductors and\neverything. And we heard that. Of course it wasn't elaborate. It was in some attic room in\nthat ghetto close. But the voices! I still can't take a mediocre voice because in my youth I\nheard these magnificent sounds, and that stayed with me. And those people, after they were\ndone singing, went behind the (Inaudible) to the transports. That was the bad thing. But we\ndidn't worry about it so much anymore then. We just lived for the moment. We just lived for\nthat evening when we could go and hear that and enter a new world \u2014 a world of sound, and\nmusic, and voices \u2014 the human voice. That was nice. So we enjoyed that. And very soon\nJirca went on transport too, and Eva and I stayed. I don't know why. Miracle, just a miracle.",
        "Q: There were orchestras and chamber music as well, right?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. They had confiscated a lot of the musical instruments from Prague, and if they\nmissed anything they went to Prague and took it \u2014 the SS And then the Jews were ordered to\nrehearse a certain piece Smetana\u2019s, Bartered Bride. Ah, heaven! And a lot of Smetana\u2019\u2019 and\na lot of Dvorak\u2019* \u2014 The New World Symphony. They were sitting on a stage, on a podium, in\nthe middle of the square, in the middle of the ghetto, in the middle of Nazi Germany. It was\nabsurd. It was bizarre. And if we had thought about it, we would have gone mad. But we\ndidn't think about it. We just walked by, arm-in-arm, and listened to that heavenly music.\nNot even knowing that after the concert these people would all be shipped out \u2014 or after the\nCommission left. Even before the Commission left, because the ghetto was overcrowded \u2014\nhugely overcrowded. The ghetto always remained at 50,000, but it wasn't the same 50,000. It\nwas a constant new transport coming in and thousands and thousands of people being\nshipped out. So we were just lucky. We were never called to go into transport. And during\nthe pre-commission, the ghetto was overcrowded. There were probably 60,000 or 70,000,\nand they couldn't show the Commission an overcrowded ghetto, so they shipped out tens of\nthousands of people before the Commission came. And Jirca was in one of those transports.",
        "Q: Before?\n\"\u2019 Bedrich Smetana\n\u2019\u00ae Antonin Dvofak",
        "A: I think so. I think so, because Eva and I went alone to hear all these operas. Yes, I'm quite\nsure he was shipped out before. And then the Commission came, and then after that they\nfilmed all this, and after that there was no more music. Then everybody was transported.",
        "Q: So this culture stops after the Red Cross Commission comes?",
        "A: It went on a little bit more, but the enthusiasm and the purpose was gone.",
        "Q: Were you filmed when that film was being made of that\u2014?",
        "A: I'm not sure I was 1n the film, but the film was done. I remember that. I was part of the\ndeception while the Commission was there. I don't remember what Eva did. She may have\nbeen with me. I don't recall that, but I recall that I was detailed behind a hay wagon, and I\nwas told to put a little kerchief around my hair, and I got the rake over my shoulder. And\nbehind that filled up hay wagon, which we'd never seen before, we were walking \u2014 a group\nof us girls were walking and we had to sing. I'm sure Eva was with me, too, because she had\nsuch a nice voice. And we walked by the Commission, out of the ghetto, and in by the next\ngate, and then we were dissolved again \u2018cause the Commission had passed. It was all \u2014 all\njust a show. But we didn't know, and we didn't care. If we had any character, we would have\nrefused to do that. It didn't occur to us.",
        "Q: Now in your book you say that some people did refuse and they put them in a room for a few\nhours.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, some people did refuse, especially the Danes the Danish Jews. They had a lot\nmore spirit than we did. They were very different from us. And also, you see, we already had\nten years of Hitler and most of them didn't. They were still fresh from their King, and from\nthe authority of their King who was standing behind the Jews.",
        "Q: Can you repeat what you were saying about the Danes? You said the Danes were different\nthan you.",
        "A: Ya. The Danes were different. First of all they, they were treated differently. They lived in\nhouses and they didn't have \u2014 I don't think they had to work. I'm not sure on that now. And I\nhad one Danish girlfriend \u2014 one girl, Danish friend. I don't know how I got her, but somehow\nI was friendly with one of them. And she was very outspoken. And she said that she would\ntell the Commission that this was all just a farce, a comedy, a Potemkin Village. And she\nwas taken into custody during the time of the International Commission. And when she came\nout again, she told us she was together with a lot of other people who were outspoken, and\nwith a lot of people who looked very Jewish. And the explanation was later that they were\ntaken into this custody not by the SS, but by the Jewish ghetto governments because they\nwere afraid of any repercussions. And if anything had gone on the whole ghetto would have\nbeen severely punished.",
        "Q: What did you think of her actions at that time when she said that she was going to tell them\nthe truth?",
        "A: I admired her. I didn't have the guts to do that. It didn't even occur to me to do that. You were\ntold to do something and you did it. It was such a, it was such a different mentality. I don't\neven understand it myself anymore today. But it really didn't occur to any of us to do that. I\nwished I could, I wished I could have a simple, clean explanation for it, but I don't. It was the\nwhole business of \u2014 It all dragged after me \u2014 that whole 10 years of Hitler, and even before.\nMy whole 2,000 year history, that was all in me.",
        "Q: Could you explain your characterization of the barracks when you were in there with all\nthese women, and you said there was \u2014 there was hostility \u2014 in the barracks? Could you\nexplain more of\u2014?",
        "A: Yes, I'll try. I wasn't in the barracks for too long. I would think there was a very bad feeling,\nalready on my part. I had come to Theresienstadt actually with great expectations. Right\naway I was disappointed. Where's my mother? Not here. My sister? Never heard of her. All\nmy friends? Zero. So already my mood was very down. Then I get stuck into \u2014 I get\nseparated from Eva Simmon \u2014 from my friend, from all the kids, from all the people I knew,\nfrom Golly also. Golly was with me for a while, but we weren't together in \u2014 on the straw at\nall. She was somewhere else. And then these women, these were all older women whom I've\nnever seen before. And they were wrapped in their grief \u2014 in their separation from their\nfamilies. It just was no camaraderie there whatsoever. And I felt lonely, and maybe the\nhostility came from me, but I could not form a friendship on that straw there at all. And, I\nrepeat, it's very important, in a situation that we were in, to have a friend \u2014 to have someone\nto share things with.",
        "Q: Was your friendship with Eva typical or deeper than what you saw around you? Or was it\ncommon that people had very close ties with one person or two persons?",
        "A: That's a question I never asked myself. But as I think back, I would say it was not unusual to\nform a very close friendship. What else did we have? That was all that was allowed to us \u2014 a\npersonal friendship. And I would say it was not too uncommon. I could observe it looking\nback now. In that room where we then lived, in that basement, and where we worked\nupstairs with the children, most of the other inhabitants were Czech nurses, Czech girls.\nBecause we were, after all in Czechoslovakia. And, looking back, they were very tightly\nclose together. And there was a bit of a gulf between them and us. They considered\nthemselves in their own country, and we were the newcomers. So we didn't form friendships\nwith them at all. But they formed friendships with themselves.",
        "Q: When you think back, do you think that women had different sorts of friendships than men,\nor there's not a gender difference here?",
        "A: It's hard to say. I'm sure there were male-female friendships as well. First of all, as I\nmentioned before, marriages were permitted, and my friend Golly very soon married the\nman that she had followed, and then lived with him in a small little room somewheres \u2014 even\njust in a corner of a small room. It was not a luxurious way of living. So there was male-\nfemale relationships throughout the ghetto, and I would think, yes, there were friendships\neither way.",
        "Q: No. I would have asked you that question, but I was also asking a question about male\nfriendships with other men.",
        "A: Oh. I wasn't aware of that. No. I was not aware of that.",
        "Q: So you were separated from \u2014 the men were living separately from the women, except for\nthose people who were\u2014?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, that's correct. Oh, definitely. No, I was not afraid of \u2014 I was not aware of same sex\nfriendships. You know that was very, very taboo. Number one in the Jewish Religion, and\nnumber one in Germany. Hitler killed homosexuals. The list of hate was Jews, homosexuals,\nblacks and then everybody else. But that was not allowed. Ah, forget it.",
        "Q: No, I actually wasn't referring to sexual relations now. I really meant the friendships that\nwere like the friendship you had with Eva, because you're talking about a relationship that\nhelped you to survive, right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I was wondering whether you saw, among men, a similar kind of pairing of, you know.\nAnd were the pairings among men and women that weren't marriage, for instance, that were\nlove affairs, were they always love affairs, or was that because the men had access to things\nthat the women needed? In other words, were they not always just straight forward not that\nlove is straight forward? Do you know what I mean?",
        "A: I don't quite see what you're asking me. Are you asking me if the kind of friendship I had\nwith Eva, I could also observe between two men?",
        "Q: That's one question.",
        "A: Yeah. I'm wondering if I'm at all able to answer that because I had no insight into where the\nmen lived, but I would think \u201cyes.\u201d I would think they formed very close camaraderie as\nwell. How else could they survive? So I would think the question of that must be \u201cyes,\u201d but I\nwouldn't know from any personal experience. Now what was the other part of the question?",
        "Q: Well, I'll ask it in a balder \u2014 in a balder way. Was there prostitution in Theresienstadt?",
        "A: That's a good question, and I have often been asked that. I did not observe it while I was\nthere, but since then I have read a lot about it. But I don't think that there was because the\nNazis were strictly forbidden to fraternize with the Jews \u2014 strictly. And if anything like that\noccurred, it wasn't only the Jew that was punished, the Nazi was punished as well. But I have\nsince then heard so much of that, that I'm wondering if I was just not aware of it. But I don't\nthink so. It certainly wasn't so that I could observe it. The Nazis and Jews were strictly\nseparated.",
        "Q: How about among Jews?",
        "A: How about what?",
        "Q: Among Jews?",
        "A: Sex among Jews? I would think \u201cyes.\u201d I would think that went on. We were not in a situation\nlike Auschwitz, and also we were healthier. And fairly \u2014 there were babies born in the\nghetto. So that \u2014 so my answer is \u201cyes.\u201d",
        "Q: Did they survive?",
        "A: Yes. They came to us to the home. We took care of them, with their mothers. The mothers\nnursed and the fathers came to visit, so I would say \u201cyes.\u201d There was a normal life there.",
        "Q: Do you think these were pregnancies that occurred prior to arrival in Theresienstadt, or were\npeople well enough you think...",
        "A: Both. Both. Many came pregnant from their homes \u2014 from their original homes \u2014 very many,\nand I would think.... Also, officially, pregnancies had to be terminated, and were in the\nwhole Elbe Hospital. But yes, I think we had some babies there that were....",
        "Q: So there were abortions that were forced?",
        "A: Absolutely. That was... They were ordered.",
        "Q: And the Judenrat carried that out. There was no...",
        "A: No. There was no question \u2014 no problem.",
        "Q: Did you ever have to participate in any of these?",
        "A: No. I was not in that part of the health system. I was with the product \u2014 with the nurses with\nthe babies. We got quite attached to some of those babies. And that's how I met Jirca. He was\nthe brother of one of the nursing mothers there, you see. Otherwise, I don't think I would\nhave known him. And, you know, we were both young, and we went on walks together. One\nthing I remember so much from Theresienstadt is we got such a love and appreciation of the\nstars, of the firmament. You know that was one of the few things we were allowed to do. We\ncould look up and look, and he knew the stars very well, so he gave me a lasting appreciation\nof constellations, and of planets, and first magnitude stars, and I was very happy about that.",
        "Q: Wasn't there a situation where he took you to \u2014 he was ringing church bells?",
        "A: Yes. And then, during the International Commission, and already before, they decided that\nthe town would look more normal if that, up to then dead, clock up on the church tower\nwould spring to life. And somehow, I don't know why, he got the job of winding up that\nclock, and he took me with him a couple of times. And that was a permanent event in my\nlife. I can still see every steep step that I climbed, I climbed up there. And as I got higher and\nhigher, how the fragrant air came through that opening, \u2018cause there was nothing \u2014 1t was\nopen, you see, on the top, and how that wonderful air from the surrounding countrysides....\nThe ghetto of course had always bad air, also many people, and there was nothing to give air\nto. And here I came up this was this \u2014 and then the view \u2014 and he could see Prague in the\ndistance. I couldn't, but I think he kind of hoped he could see Prague. That was his home\ntown. But I could see the Elbe and the Eger. That was wonderful blue rivers, unpolluted, and\nI can still remember how I wished I could swim, and how I almost felt the cool water on my\nshoulders. We hadn't been swimming since I was a child, you see. And I can still remember\nhow I dreamt that I could dive into that water and feel the water go over my shoulders. And\nthen we heard bird sings. But also as we looked at the beautiful things, we also saw die\nKleine Festung.\u2019\u201d One of the features of the ghetto was what was called \"die Kleine\nFestung.\" That was \u2014 you see, Theresienstadt was a garrison town built in the 1600s or the\n1700s for soldiers, and naturally they had to have like a correction place for soldiers that\nneeded to be punished, and that was die \u2014 a medieval fortress \u2014 a medieval, almost like a\ntorture fortress, where they put the soldiers that needed to be isolated. And they recovered\nthis again from medieval times and put the Jews in there. Took terrible consequences. The\nJews there were \u2014 were never returned. It was also, by the way, a historical place. The young\nman by the name of Gavrilo Princip who shot the Crown Prince in 1914, and started World\nWar I in Sarajevo \u2014 I say \u201cSarajevo\u201d \u2014 You say it differently, don't you? How do you say it?\nSarajevo. Sarajevo, which is so much in the news now. That how World War I started as you\n\u201d The little fortress (German)\nprobably know. It was called, \u201cthe shot that went around the world.\u201d That young man \u2014 that\nyoung Princip was imprisoned in the Kleine Festung, and then he died just before the end of\nthe war, and he's buried outside the Kleine Festung. So it has a very historical side to it. So\nthis is what we saw from up on the tower and I only, reluctantly, always, went back down\ninto the ghetto after he took me up there.",
        "Q: It was more than once.",
        "A: I think it was a couple of times. It kind of kaleidoscoped into one because each time it was\nsuch a wonderful experience. It think 1t was maybe two, three times. And he was, naturally,\nnot allowed to take me up there, so by the time we came down into the, into the ground floor\nagain, he always had to look out first that no SS was around and then he could sneak me out.\nWe took pleasure where we could.",
        "Q: So there's always this combination of the background being so sad and deprived, and yet\u2014",
        "A: Yes. I always feel a little guilty because I did not go through that terrible hell that so many of\nother Jews went through. I never was in a gas chamber. I was never in real danger of my life.\nI was, of course, constantly, \u2018cause all the time those transports would go out \u2014 and I\nsurvived. And I that's \u2014 I think part of why I'm still religious \u2014 I did survive. Miracles did\nhappen.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a couple of other things. Did you menstruate in the ghetto, or did it stop?",
        "A: It stopped. It stopped. We were so worried when they took our, our napkins as contraband in\nthe Schleusse. And of course, by the way, those were not these elegant little contraptions that\nyoung women use today. It was something that we used, had to wash out afterwards, and\nused again. And we were so worried when it was... when those were taken from us, and then\nwe didn't need them for which reason I don't know. And it impacted us differently. Some of\nus became very heavy and very fat, and others became very thin after we lost our\nmenstruation \u2014 and I kind of got a little thin and Eva got a little heavier \u2014 I don't know why.",
        "Q: Tell me about Freddi Hirsch. What was your relationship with him?",
        "A: Nice. I met Freddi when I was still in the Hundertschaft because I was detailed to sweep in\nfront of his home \u2014 his children's home. He was the leader of the children's home. He was\nalready a prominent Zionist before, and he attracted the young people around himself. And\nthen when he got out of the Hundertschaft, he was detailed to the children's home to work\nwith the children. It was of course forbidden to have classes or real instructions, so he always\nwas able to lead and guide and instruct the children kind of on the sly. While they were\nsupposedly working, he would give instructions, and he was very much beloved. He was a\nvery lovely young man \u2014 a real Zionist \u2014 a real ethical figure. And the Germans respected\nhim for a long time, and then the reason he got into the next transport was \u2014 yes, I remember\nthat. A transport of children from Czechoslovakia showed up \u2014 from Slovakia showed up \u2014\nalone \u2014 barefoot, in terrible condition \u2014 and we heard about it. And they didn't speak\nanything but Polish, and he of course spoke Polish. And we... Eva went as a nurse to that\ntransport also. I didn't. I don't know why. That was the one time we didn't do things together.\nThat transport was a group of children whose parents had been shot, and these children had\nwitnessed that, and they were very frightened \u2014 very intimidated. And the order came from\nthe SS that we were not allowed to speak to them. We were not allowed to know that their\nparents were shot and killed, and the kids, not speaking any other language but Polish, were\nnot permitted to speak to us who spoke German. So Freddi Hirsch disobeyed that order and\nspoke to the children in a soothing way, and he was caught at that, and he was, of course, put\nonto the next transport. And he wrote a card back that I remember. After some time he wrote\nback that... First for a long time we didn't hear from him, and then he wrote back, \"We\nshould do all we can to stay in the ghetto and not to volunteer and not to provoke our\nentrance into an east transport.\" And we were puzzled about this because we thought we had\nit very bad. We had no news from Auschwitz. We did not know how bad they had it, and so\nwe, we got our first inkling how bad Auschwitz must be if he advised us to stay where we\nare.",
        "Q: So you heard no \u2014 did you continually hear rumors about gas chambers, or did they stop?",
        "A: That stopped. I heard that once in Berlin, \"Die werden alle vergast.\u201d And I thought that guy\nwas out of his mind to make such a statement, and then we didn't hear it anymore. We didn't\nhear it anymore. We heard only that they were working, and they couldn't write for a while\nthey could write, but only for a while. And I never heard from Eva and Werner Simmon. I\nsurely would have heard from them if they had lived. And when Golly was deported to\nAuschwitz, or rather when she followed her husband to Auschwitz, I didn't hear from her.\nSo, there was something fishy going on and we knew it. But also we \u2014 I think we purposely\nclosed our minds to it. We purposely \u2014 because we were so apt to go into the next transport,\nand why should we think we were going to be killed right away So, self preservation, we\ntook that out of our minds.",
        "Q: And who was choosing the people to go on transports? Also the Judenrat?*\u201d",
        "A: Yes. I have to assume so. Yes.",
        "Q: You're not sure?\n*\u00b0 Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis\nto oversee Jewish communities and ghettos.",
        "A: I'm not sure, but.... Yes, of course it was the Judenrat. I am sure, because when the October\ntransports \u2014 the one that Jirca went on, just before the Commission. Then all of a sudden\nEdelstein was taken prisoner, and his wife was told to bring food three times a day, and to\nbring fresh clothing once a week. And she never got any \u2014 any dishes back, and she never\ngot any dirty laundry back. He was, as we know now, he was already in the Kleine Festung\nand probably already dead. And the reason was that he did not want to cooperate in those\ntransports. He refused to put that many people up for transports. So the answer to your\noriginal question is \u201cyes.\u201d It was the Jews who made the transport. Of course it had to be.\nThe Germans didn't do it anymore. Why should they? And it was the Jews who worked in\nthe Schleusse. The Schleusse of course went both ways \u2014 in and out. And who took the\npeople to the cattle cars and everything else? Thank God I never had to do that. I only went\nto all the incoming transports to see if I would find anybody I knew. And, in fact, by then the\ntrains came right into the ghetto. And there was a certain barrack where we could go to and\njust look out the window and see the people come. Eva and I did that. We watched to see if\nwe knew anybody.",
        "Q: When the people worked in the Schleusse, do you think they stole things?",
        "A: Yes, I would think so. I would think so. I would think so. I don't think they considered it\nstealing \u2018cause\u2014",
        "Q: No, no\u2014",
        "A: \u2018Cause it was that \u2014 it was already stolen in the first place.",
        "Q: I didn't mean that in the derogatory sense.",
        "A: But I think so, yes. And then they could do a little good with it. And then often they would\nexchange these things for cigarettes. Cigarettes were very coveted. Everybody wanted to\nsmoke.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Don't ask me, I never smoked, and I never touched a cigarette \u2014 or maybe I touched one once\nor twice \u2014 but they loved cigarettes. I think it got them away from the ghetto. I think it made\nthem feel normal again.",
        "Q: And why didn't you smoke?",
        "A: I never did.",
        "Q: Did Eva?",
        "A: No. Never. No. It wasn't done. At home nobody smoked. It never occurred to me to smoke.\nMaybe I did once or twice, and I think I was very sick afterwards, so I never did it again. I\nstill don't smoke.",
        "Q: What was your food like? What was your daily\u2014?",
        "A: The food. When we came in, as our belongings were taken away from us, we got in return\none little thing \u2014 one little pot kind of a thing out of metal, that we had to hook onto\nourselves \u2014 and not to lose it, because we didn't get a second one. If we lost it, we just didn't\nget any food. So we hung onto it for dear life. And three times a day, while we were still in\nthe Hundertschaft \u2014 in the beginning \u2014 three times a day we went to the Essensausgabe Z\nthe distribution center for the food. And in the morning we got coffee, and they called it\neine\u201d buchta\u2019\u2019 \u2014 was kind of a square shaped piece of bread. And at noontime we got soup\nand bread, and a little margarine, I think. And in the evening we got soup, and a little sugar,\nand coffee. And that had to do us. And maybe a little bit bread again. But then when we\nworked in the children's home, then the food came to us already. It came into the home and it\nwas much better then.",
        "Q: Was it prepared in the home, or was it already prepared?",
        "A: No, no. There was one central station that did all the food.",
        "Q: And so there was a difference between the kind of food certain groups got and other groups.",
        "A: Only in the way that it was a little more that we got. A little more volume, quantity. And\nthese places where they distributed the food, mostly the old people had to go because they\nhad no place of work. The people who worked \u2014 I have to assume \u2014 that it was the same as in\nthe children's home \u2014 that the food was brought to them, rather they stopping their wor.... Of\ncourse, it had to be that way \u2018cause the Germans wouldn't allow the people to wander off at\nnoontime and go to lunch, huh? That wasn't done. So I have to assume, then the food came\nin a little better quantity. And later on, during and after the Commission, there was also\nbetter quality. There was sent much better food. I remember my agony when I saw for the\nfirst time some meat swimming in that soup. Up to then there was no meat. It was just \u2014 Eva\nand I always compared it to, to the dishwater that we threw out after washing our dishes.\nYou know, a little, little eyes of fat swimming on it, like it was from our dishes at home\nwhen we were still living normally. And then suddenly I found a piece of meat in there and I\ndidn't know what to do because I hadn't eaten meat up to then. In the hospital, in Berlin, up\nto \u2014 after I left was kosher, and up to then there was no problem, and suddenly I was\n*' Food distribution (German)\nA (German)\n*\u00b0 Baked yeasted dumpling (German)\nconfronted with a piece of meat, and I remember my agony. \u201cShould I eat it, or shouldn't I?\u201d\nEva had no such qualms because she was never kosher, and she ate it of course.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: I ate it too, but after a long struggle. And it didn't taste good. I was sorry I ate it. It was\nprobably horse meat and I shouldn't even have touched it.",
        "Q: Did you feel guilty?",
        "A: I didn't feel guilty, but I felt sorry. And Eva said, \"You have to keep your strength up, and\nyou have to eat it,\" and this and that, but I shouldn't have listened to her. I did okay without\nthe meat. I think I didn't eat it a second time. But I remember that so well because it was such\na such an opening into decision making all of a sudden. Up to now you didn't have to make\nany decisions, and all of a sudden you.... That was the first important decision, and then the\nnext important decision was to go on the Swiss transport or not.",
        "Q: Can you give an impression of sanitary conditions?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Water, toilets \u2014 I mean, what were those conditions like in Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Yes. I can give you a very clear picture of that. When we were still living in the barracks, at\nfirst \u2014 and you mustn't think that after I left, everybody else left in the barracks also. Oh, no.\nThe barracks were always constantly filled with newcomers. Every newcomer first had to\nstay in the barracks for quite a while, so it was very filthy there, very, very filthy. And it was\nlike some toilets for the whole barracks. It was directly taken over from when they used it as\nmilitary barracks, so whatever it was, that I don't remember that too well. It was just, you\nknow, very primitive. This was 1940ish and there was not very great luxury.",
        "Q: Like a latrine, or was there actually running water?",
        "A: There was no running water. I think it was a latrine. Yes, I believe it was. You see that was\nnot so strange to me because in Ansbach, way back when I was a child, that's all there was.\nSo it was not a culture shock that if somebody would have to go there today \u2014 you know -\u2014 it\nwas the outhouse. It was where we went, you see. Just Berlin was much more elegant there.\nWe had a real toilet. But, so I was back in my youth \u2014 so what? But in the home for the\nchildren, when Eva and I lived in the basement, I remember very well the way we showered\nand the way we washed our hair, it was just a low faucet, and we had to kind of crouch under\nit when there was warm water, or even had cold water. And I remember Eva and I washing\nour hairs, each other, \u2018cause she doesn't remember all of that. I have to tell her again and\nagain how I washed her hair and she washed my hair. And I remember that clearly, but about\nthe toilet I don't remember. I think we had running water in the home already. You see those\nthings didn't stay with me because, you know, it was something that just had to be done, and\nyou did it, and it didn't stay with me. I think we had a running toilet, although I'm not\npositive.",
        "Q: And what about soap and shampoo, and where did you get them?",
        "A: Soap? We had soap. We had some primitive soap, like Waschseife*\u2019 \u2014 these big bars that\nwere given to us. We had to have soap because we washed the children also. In the home it\nwas clean. Now you asked about sanitary conditions. We had, we had to keep that basement\nroom clean, naturally. There was no maid service. And we had to wash our own things in\nthat little faucet. But the big, big problem in Theresienstadt were the bedbugs, and we could\nnot rid ourselves of the bedbugs ever. In the summer, no matter how we tried to keep the\nbeds clean, or anything \u2014 naturally we didn't change beds all that often \u2018cause we had to\nwash the bedding under that little water and hang it out to dry in the winter. I don't think we\never changed beds. So we had enormous problem with bedbugs \u2014 the whole ghetto. And in\nthe summer we just took a blanket and slept outdoors. And there again it was always that\nbeautiful sky. There were no lights to interfere, you see. The whole, the whole ghetto was\nblacked out \u2014 number one because they wouldn't spend any of the \u2014 any electricity on us, and\nnumber two, it was wartime. We had to be blacked out. We couldn't attract enemy fire. So\nwe slept outdoors under that gorgeous sky. And once in a while the ghetto, house by house,\nwould be de-debugged, and it didn't do a thing. After a week or two the bugs were back. So\nthat was a really big problem. We scratched and scratched, and then those things got\ninfected, and it was a mess. There was nothing we could do, no matter how we tried. And\nyou asked about the water. I have no recollection of it. It was probably drinkable. I don't\nrecall.",
        "Q: You don't remember if you were thirsty?",
        "A: No, I don't remember feeling thirsty. I think once we were in the home there was always\nwater because of the children. We took very good care of those children, and I remember\nhow strict we were with, with the mothers to keep their children clean, and not to bring in\nanything, \u2018cause there was always lice and bedbugs.",
        "Q: Okay.\n** Washing soap (German)\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Mrs. Haas, can you tell us something about the hospital and the children, and what you and\nEva and the other nurses were doing.",
        "A: The children's home. It was not a hospital.",
        "Q: The children's home.",
        "A: The children's home. Yes, I can recollect that very well. We had from babies to \u2014 I would\nsay, two years old. Now these were children that came in transports. A lot of them were of\nmixed marriages \u2014 the so-called Mischlinge that the Germans didn't know what to do with.\nThese were not necessarily sick children. This was a regular children's home \u2014 babies' home\n\u2014 for which I actually was trained. That was my diploma. And we, we took care of them as\nbest we could. For instance, I remember we had to wash the diapers out all the time. You\nknow, naturally, I mean what do you expect in the \u201840s in Germany? And hang them up to\ndry and use them over and over again. And the children stayed with us day and night. The\nmothers could come and visit. In some cases they nursed and came three times a day, but in\nmost \u2014 in all cases they had to work otherwise, and just came to visit their kids. And I\nremember we were fairly strict with those mothers. We didn't let them \u2014 we were the bosses,\nnot the mothers, you see. We told them when they could take up their kids and not. We were\nalways afraid they would bring in lice, or bedbugs, or disease, or whatever \u2014 and these were\nour kids and we were keeping them nice and clean and healthy. We had a physician coming,\nI don't know how often now. But if one of the kids were sick we sent them to the hospital.\nAnd we worked very hard. We had to do everything. We had to clean the rooms, do the\nwashing, we had to feed the kids. The food came in. We didn't have to cook it. So it was an\nall around job. And we \u2014 in some cases when we got very attached to the children, it was\nterrible when they were called on transport. And then after a while we hardened against this.\nWe tried not to get attached, but that's hard to do.",
        "Q: I can't imagine if there was a mood over all the children, but can you describe something of\nwhat went on with the children and your actual interactions with each other?",
        "A: I remember we took them out into that little park. Just in front of the home \u2014 just in front of\nBergstrasse 14 there was a little park, just a little enclosure where there were greenery and a\ncouple of trees. And I remember we took them out into that park. We dressed them up\nwarmly if the weather was warm, and that was always so nice. We could sit in the park for a\nfew minutes watching our kids, but really we were sitting in the park \u2014 and just to get them\nsome fresh air and some normal activities. Otherwise, we didn't do anything with them. They\nslept, and were fed, and were cleaned, and bathed, and slept again. That was all we did. We\ncouldn't do anything with them. Later on when the Commission came, then they built in that\nsame little park, playgrounds, and swings, and rockinghorses, and everything. And we had to\ninstruct the kids what to do with them. And then the kids in turn, these were the older kids,\nwere instructed to play act \u2014 that they were always playing on these things.",
        "Q: What is the age range of these children in the home?",
        "A: The age range?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: From newborn to about three.",
        "Q: So, there's not a lot of \u2014?",
        "A: After they were three, then they got into that home that Freddi Hirsch was, was \u2014 or maybe\nfour I would think. No, we didn't keep them \u2018til four. There must have been another in-\nbetween step, because Freddi's children were also already much older. I think there was an\nin-between step. We had the small ones, and he had already the trainable ones. There must\nhave been one other step in between, but at the moment I don't know what it was.",
        "Q: Did they cry a lot?",
        "A: No. They were happy. They were cute. They were kids. What always surprised us was how\nhealthy they were. And also what surprised us was that the mothers could even produce kids.\nThe mothers themselves were dehydrated and undernourished, and they produced perfectly\nnice kids. No, I would think those kids were okay. They didn't know. They went into their\ndeaths without ever knowing.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you try not to be affectionate with them so as not to get close to them, or was\nthat not a\u2014?",
        "A: At first it wasn't a problem. At first we were very close to them, but don't forget they had\nmothers. We didn't need to be that close to them. And later on we tried not to be, not to be in\nlove with them at all, \u201ccause we knew they were going. Later on, as the transports escalated,\nthey were going as quickly as they came in, and then we didn't go too close to them\nanymore.",
        "Q: Do you think that affected the children? Did they notice? Or was the turnover so great\u2014?",
        "A: No. I don't think it affected the children. We still gave them all the care we wanted to, we\nneeded to, but we just didn't let our hearts go out to them. They were cute kids. It was\nterrible. That whole Theresienstadt was just another collection center, and it took us a while\nto realize that. It was just another center to go to your death. And some, of course, died there\ntoo. The old people died easily. And some of the children died too \u2014 and some of the other\npeople. Disease, malnutrition, severe depressions. I don't think there were many suicides. At\nleast I wasn't aware of it. I wasn't aware of suicides.",
        "Q: But in Berlin there were a lot of suicides.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: In Berlin there were a lot of suicides.",
        "A: Yes. In Berlin was a lot of suicide. I was not aware, maybe I was just not aware of it, I can't\ntell you of any suicides in Theresienstadt. No, I remember. And anyone who died was\nburned, and the ashes were put into little bags, and then \u2014 I was in that building once. I don't,\nI don't remember why. It was \u2014 you see, those, those walls that surrounded the ghetto were\nhollow inside, you see. You could walk into them. Those were huge walls \u2014 huge medieval\nwalls. They were hollow inside, and on top of them there was earth, and there was grass.\nThat was called die Bastei.\u201d\u2019 And later on you could plant vegetables up here, and you could\nwalk up there and have a ballgame up there. But what I'm thinking, at the moment, these\nurns, 1f you want to call them urns \u2014 it was just in little paper bags with a name on them,\nwere stored in those \u2014 between those huge walls. And for some reason or other I was 1n there\nonce. I don't know why or how I got there. But I remember being there and seeing those\nrows and rows of \u2014 of little packages with ashes. I have no recollection how I got there. And\nthen, after a while, there were so many that the SS ordered the Jewish government to dispose\nof them. And then they put them onto a barge, and the barge was taken out into the River\nElbe and was sunk. So a lot of people's ashes are sunk in the River Elbe.",
        "Q: Was there a crematory to burn the bodies?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Was there a crematory in Theresienstadt to burn the bodies?",
        "A: Yes there was. I don't know where it was, but yes there was. Ya. And after we left there was\nanother crematorium being built \u2014 actually before we left already. There were rumors that a\ncrematorium was being built, but then we left and I don't know what became of tt.",
        "Q: Did you dream?\n* The bastion (German)",
        "A: In Theresienstadt?",
        "Q: In Theresienstadt?",
        "A: No, not that I remember. I don't recall. It's a good question. I don't think so. Eva and I\nfantasized a lot. Eva and I, in our spare time, we, we built some huge dream castles. We\ncalled it \u2014 first of all we talked a lot about food \u201ccause we were always hungry, and we gave\nit a name. We called it \u201cMagenonanie.*\u201d\u201d It's really a name we made up. \u201cMagen\u201d is your\nstomach. So it was \u201cStomach-Onanie,\u201d and \u201cOnanie\u201d is masturbation. So we had a very nice\ntime masturbating our stomachs with dreams of food. Of all the things we had eaten, and all\nthe things we're going to be eating again. And that satisfied us for the moment. I think we\nmade up that name. I've never heard it before or since. And then we also dreamt that we\nwould get out. That kept us going. We always dreamt that we, we would survive all this. We\nwere hoping that we wouldn't get into a transport. If we would go into a transport, we knew\nthat was the end. But we were hoping very.... And the big question was if one of us would go\ninto a transport, would the other one voluntarily go along? And we kind of didn't make a\ndecision on that, and thank God it never came up. And then we dreamt that we would get\nout, and get married, and find love. You see, we were by now 22, 23. Love was not a thing\nwe were very familiar with, aside from these flirtations and these.... You know, somebody\nonce brought me a bunch of flowers that they had picked up on the Bastei, that, that was the\nheight of courtship. You know, that was fabulous. I still remember it, and the smell of them,\nand the look of them \u2014 and just the whole gesture of receiving flowers, you know. So\nanyway... So we dreamt we would lead a normal life, and have husbands, and have children\n\u2014 and then we let our fantasy go wild, and we said, \"And then our children will marry.\" And\nwe promised ourselves our children would marry each other. And, as you know, it did\nbecome true. My son \u2014 my daughter and her son married, but not because we wanted it to. I\nwas so surprised when my daughter called up and said, \u201cJoe and I are engaged.\u201d I was the\nmost surprised person in the world. Also, 30 years before that, Eva and I had dreamt about tt.\nThat was one of the miracles of my life.",
        "Q: Was this helpful to have these fantasies and these conversations about\u2014?",
        "A: I would think so. It certainly didn't do us any harm. I think it got us over some rough spots.\nAnd you know we had to fill the time. You couldn't just sit and chew your thumbs and bite\nyour nails all the time. You had to do something. Normal activities were far away, so we, we\ndreamt and talked and\u2014",
        "Q: Were these very detailed conversations about what your life would be like really?\n*\u00b0 Stomach masturbation (German)",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yes. I always did want to marry a doctor and have four children.",
        "Q: Is that true?",
        "A: Why not? I could dream. But it came true \u2014 that's the miracle. And I had two boys and two\ngirls, just like I dreamt, and visualized, and hoped for, and prayed for. And all of them are\nnow married. The youngest one just had a baby a couple of weeks ago. We went to the\nBrit,\u201d\u2019 and right here in Washington. It was very, very nice. I'm very fortunate. My husband\nis well and with me. So, it's really fortunate. And that's why I'm still religious. That's why I\nhave made peace with, with God. After all he has thrown a lot my way that other people can\nonly wish for. And so I live with that, with that multi-faceted God who can dispense great\nhardship, and great joy. Maybe that's the way it 1s.",
        "Q: So you never lost your faith?",
        "A: I struggled a lot. I struggled a lot, and I argued a lot with people, and I philosophized a great\ndeal with, especially, one of my cousins who also remained very religious. And I\nphilosophized a great deal with him. In fact I still have some of those letters that we wrote\nback and forth way back after I was released from Theresienstadt. And I struggled a great\ndeal, but then by the time I married a very religious man, then the struggle was over and I\nhad to come to some, to some peace within myself. And the peace is that there is no answer.\nThat I have to live with a God who 1s good, and not good at the same time. And the answer is\nthat there is no answer, that you have to just, just accept it. But the thing is you have to have\nsomething. I can't turn to, to drugs, or to hippy living, or to anything. You have to have\nsomething in your life. So my something 1s religion, and that's the answer for me. It's very\nunsatisfactory, but it's the best I can do.",
        "Q: Did you ever get depressed?",
        "A: Yes. I became very depressed after my first child was born. The interesting thing 1s, my\nmother was deported on the ninth of November, and my son was born on the ninth of\nNovember. My mother died on the eleventh of November, as I found out much later, and my\nsecond son was born on the eleventh of November. So there is this what I have just talked\nabout. How do you live with something like that? So, what was your question?",
        "Q: Did you ever get depressed?\n*\u2019 Circumcision (Hebrew)",
        "A: Did I ever get depressed? Yes. After my first son was born I fell into a deep depression. I\ndidn't function anymore. I had a home, I had a husband, I had a son. I was living in freedom.\nI had food on the table without end and I couldn't function any further. And my husband,\nwho is a physician, advised me to seek professional help, which was in those days, in the\nearly \u201840s, a stigma. You didn't go to a psychiatrist. You didn't go to a psychologist. You just\ndealt with your problems. But wisely enough he advised me to get professional help. And the\ninteresting answer was that I had a guilt complex. Now in the early \u201840s that was unheard of.\nWhat was a guilt complex? Nobody knew that. Now we know that most people who do go\nthrough a hard time come out with a guilt feeling. And my complex was, \"Why me? Why\nam I living this Life of Riley now? Why not my sister? Why not my husband's sisters? Why\nwasn't my mother alive to enjoy that baby with me? My husband's mother or father?\"\nEverybody was gone with the exception of my father, in both our families. And why was I\nalive? What did I do that guaranteed me such joy? And the normal reaction, as I now know\nof the mind and the body, is a depression. And I got over it because I got help. And then I\nalso got over it because I felt I had to do something for that gift of life, and I got over it then.",
        "Q: How did you get out of Theresienstadt?",
        "A: That was another miracle. That was another miracle. I can still see Eva and me sitting on our\nbunks. I can still see that in my mind. We were beginning to be very low, even Eva in all her\nViennese humor and gaiety. It was February 1, 1945, and we were sitting on the upper bunk.\nWe changed bunks every so often because the window was right at the upper bunk level, and\nwhy should one only look out the window all the time, so we changed bunks, and I don't\nknow whose, whose turn it was, but we were sitting on the upper bunk and watching the\ncobblestones out in the window, and then somebody came. And all we could see, of course,\nwas just up to their mid-calves. And anyone that ever came brought bad news, or God forbid\nthe slip to go into the transport, so naturally we were \u2014 we stopped our conversation and we\nwere very much afraid. And then the person that came said that the next transport would go\nto Switzerland, February 1, 1945. The war was on, killing was still in high gear, and\nsomebody was going to take us to Switzerland? And so at first we just ignored it. And then\nthe next morning, we heard it again. And then we heard it from people whom we trusted that\nwere in with the administration, and we heard \u2014 especially we, we young women who were\nstill looking pretty well, we heard, \"Go ahead. Go and register for that transport. Hurry up.\"\nAnd so after a while, Eva in her light \u2014 I would never have registered , I'm sure I thank my\nwhole life to her \u2014 she said, \"Come on, let's go. Let's go. Let's register. Why wait for\nanything else?\" And of course all we could think of was all those transports that they said\nwould go to Palestine, and they never got to Palestine. So I said, \"But what if we end up in\nAuschwitz?\" So she said, \"Then our problems are solved if we should join the other one.\nThen we're together already anyway. So, nothing to lose. We go.\"\nSo we went, and we had to register, which was very different from the other transports. We\nwere looked over. We had to answer questions, especially the question I remember was,\n\"Did any one of your family ever die in Theresienstadt, or was sent away to the East?\" And\nwe had nobody, you see. So we could say \u201cno.\u201d And then we saw him write down that we\ncould get into the transport. And then the next day \u2014 this was all packed into two days, you\nsee. There was no way of come back in two weeks or anything like that, no red tape of any\nkind. So then the next day we got that brown slip that I showed you before where it says that\nwe should appear on February the fourth, at seven o'clock in the evening, with one suitcase \u2014\nno bedrolls, no rucksacks, nothing of the kind \u2014 and nicely dressed and punctual. The\nGermans were very much for punctuality, whether that was for your liberation or for your\ndeath, you be punctual. So we went, and we left the rest of the people in the basement room,\nand we really didn't believe we were really going to Switzerland. We did believe something\nwas different. And in the train, it was not a cattle car this time, in the train we got packages\nof marmalade, and stuff that I didn't even know what to do with. And then we left, Eva and I\nvery much together, and we really got to Switzerland. And when we got to Switzerland, we\ncrossed the border into Switzerland I remember three things that stayed in my mind very\nmuch. We looked out the window. Number one, nobody yelled us, \"Get back in or you'll be\nshot,\" you know. And number two, the people smiled. I hadn't seen a person smile in 12\nyears. What was there to smile at? All through my youth and my growing up. The people\nsmiled at us. And the person that \u2014 then some Swiss people in uniform came tn and they\nwere nice to us, and that was unheard of, anyone 1n uniform being nice to Jews. What's this?\nGan Eden?\u201d\u00ae Already we're dead and we're in paradise. Was unheard of. And then the third\nthing I remember, night fell and the lights stayed on. There was no war in Switzerland, you\nsee. The lights purposely stayed on so the airplanes overhead could tell that it was\nSwitzerland and wouldn't bomb it. But to us it was an epiphany. It was unheard of. So then\nwe were allowed to pick one of the several places where we could go, and Eva and I stayed\ntogether and picked Les Avants, and then she fell in love with a French refugee who had also\ncome, and she followed him to France because she was completely alone. And I contacted\nmy father, and then he let me come over to America, and I married. And by gosh when our\nkids became teenagers they visited back and forth, and J ean\u201d fell in love with Polly\u201d \u2014 right\nunder my eyes, and I didn't see it happen. And I didn't know for many years just how that all\ncame about. May I tell you just very quickly.\nMaybe you know it already, but to me it was a very, very fascinating story because I\ndiscovered it myself. It wasn't told to me. I went to the National Archives. I had an advisor,\nTim Mulligan, to guide me through the whole process, and I discovered the documents and\nread them, and I found out that at the end of 1944, a Jewish-Swiss woman by the name of\nRecha Sternbuch, very religious woman.... I'll condense the story a little bit \u2014 approached\n\u00b0\u00b0 Garden of Eden (Hebrew)\n*\u00b0 Jean Hammel\n* Polly Haas-Hammel\nJean-Marie Musy, who was a Swiss \u2014 a former Swiss President. First she thought she wanted\nher mother and father to be taken out of Germany. Musy was a friend of Himmler's and he\nhad rescued a few Jews before, and she approached him to get her parents out. And then, she\nthought, \u201c\u201cWhy not try to get all the Jews out?\u201d It was late in the war, and she asked him to\ncontact Himmler, and she said she, in turn, would contact the Americans and see if for a\ncertain ransom he would let the Jews out of Germany. And by gosh he agreed. This is now,\nof course, I'm condensing this very much. He agreed. Musy went to Germany to meet him\nfirst in his railroad car, then at another secret location, and he agreed. And I saw the\ncorrespondence between him and \u2014 Himmler and Musy \u2014 and then later with Sternbuch. He\nwanted first \u2014 first he wanted lorries, trucks to continue the war, but the Americans of course\ndidn't do that. In the meantime Sternbuch had contacted the Va\u2019ad Ha-Hatsala, which 1s the\nUnion of Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada. And they had formed this Va\u2019ad, just for\nthe purpose of helping the Jews \u2014 the war was ending \u2014 whom they knew would come and\nneeded help, even in Europe. And when Sternbuch contacted them, they immediately agreed\nto collect money to buy out the Jews.\nIn the end, the first transport, it was exchanged for 5,000,000 American dollars, and was to\nbe of twelve hundred people out of Theresienstadt, because we still looked good, and as I\nhave said before, especially we young people were urged to, to come. And then Hitler \u2014 and\nthe condition that Himmler made was that he should get good publicity in Swiss and\nAmerican press. Why? Because he saw the war ending, and he saw his own fate clearly\nbefore him. After all, he was the originator of all that killing, and he now wanted to\nwhitewash himself. He wanted good publicity and good treatment when the war ended. And\nthis was done without Hitler's knowledge. And Hitler heard about it. When the first 1,200\nJews came out, he heard about it. And he immediately disinherited Himmler. Himmler had\nto flee, and he forbade every other contact \u2014 every other release \u2014 Jews or non-Jews \u2014\nnobody leaves Germany anymore. So we were the only transport. And Musy, who it is\nbelieved enriched himself from those 5,000,000 dollars went back into obscurity. Nobody\nheard from him. Then he died. He was already 76 years old at the time of his intercourse\nwith Himmler. But he died later. Mrs. Sternbuch was much honored and also died much later\n\u2014in \u201871. And Himmler had to flee first from Hitler, who was going to kill him \u2014 and he\nwandered around Luneburger Heide which 1s a place \u2014 a lonely place in Germany, and then\nhe had to flee from the Allies. It was the English \u2014 the British that captured that part of\nGermany. And when the Allies did capture him, not knowing whom they had, he took\ncyanide and killed himself. And then they knew it was Himmler. It was too late. And I was\nsaved. He tried to save himself and he saved me instead. Isn't that a miracle? I was number\n1,400\u2014 number 1,174 out of those 1,200.",
        "Q: And Eva was 1,100 and\u2014",
        "A: Seventy-five. She was right next \u2014 right behind me. It's really something.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to part from Eva when she got married \u2014 when she followed this\u2014?",
        "A: It was. I remember that quite well. She, she \u2014 we said \u201cgoodbye\u201d to each other at the, at the\ntrain station in Zurich, and well, of course, she was the happiest woman in the world. She\nwas very much in love with Eric, who \u2014 her future husband. The interesting thing 1s they\nwere married in Paris, and who would be the officiating Rabbi? My own Eli Munk from\nAnsbach. Isn't that something. And then when Jean and Polly got engaged and were about to\nmarry, Eli Munk was then a very old gentleman already and he was living in New York, and\nthe marriage was 1n Boston, and I wanted very much for him to marry our children. But then\nhe was already. He tried, but he was already too old. But, no, it wasn't all that hard for us to,\nto part. We knew we would stay friends, and we knew we would visit each other, and we\ndid. She and I had some great visits with each other. She lost her husband much too soon,\nand her son and my daughter had four children, and we are very devoted grandmothers.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk with Munk once you re-found him about his leaving and not telling\npeople?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I didn't say that to him. You can't say that to a beloved and respected Rabbi. That\nwas something that I, that I have to keep in my own mind because I'm still very friendly with\nhis sons and daughters \u2014 especially with his daughter who married the Chief Rabbi of Great\nBritain, Jakobovitz,\u2019' and I'm very friendly with Lady Emily(ph). And I still adore her father\nand her mother, although they're now gone. But you see when I got to Switzerland there's\nanother very interesting connection. They had to fleet Paris \u2014 Munks with all their children \u2014\nin \u201844 or \u201845. They had to flee Paris, and they fled to Geneva, and when he heard that I was\nin Les Avants, which is very close to Geneva, he came immediately to visit me. And you\nknow it was like a father coming. He was so associated with my youth, and so, so beloved by\nme that, that was a bond that never dissolved. And then they invited me their house, and the\nchildren were all very small, and it was a homecoming for me, you see. And now I have long\nforgiven him that. I didn't even think about it anymore. It just came back to me now as I was\nthinking about Ansbach. But you know, the normal measurements of ethics do not apply to\nthe years of the Holocaust. They just don't apply. Was everybody justified in trying to save\nhis or her own life? Were people justified in trying to save their own baby, knowing that if\nthat baby wasn't taken, another mother's baby would have to be substituted? Was I justified\nto let my mother and sister? Was my father justified to leave us? You cannot apply those\nnormal moral standards to the Holocaust years. You just can't. You just can't. So I have long\nforgiven him that he saved his life, and his whole family's life. Why should that whole family\nalso have disappeared? And he has since done so much good. He's been such an outstanding\nRabbi. And then we were not bound to obey him even though he said, \"Stay. Everything will\n*' Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovitz\nbe okay.\" Many people left. We could have left too, and we did after a while. So that's a\nwhole other philosophical problem that you just can't allow yourself to get into it. You get\nlost in the swamp.",
        "Q: What was it like to see your father after \u2014 what, six years?",
        "A: Oh, that was, that was after.... Let's see, he left in \u201839, and I saw him again in \u201846 \u2014 in April\nof \u201846, and it was very strange. I came by boat, and I arrived \u2014 I think it was during the\nPassover \u2014 during the Pesach holidays. And my father remained very religious. And he came\nto Boston to pick me up. I arrived at the Boston Harbor, and he couldn't travel to the boat to\npick me up. He sent somebody else, and that somebody took me then to an apartment where\nhe stayed and I saw him again. And I thought that I would see an old man because I had\ngone through so much. I had lived six lifetimes, you see, that to me it was like a 100 years.\nAnd I thought there would be this old, broken man full of grief, and full of sorrow and\nremorse. But it wasn't. There was a young, beautiful, dark haired, straight, upright man in his\nprime \u2014 50 years old \u2014 who greeted me. And that was \u2014 I had to adjust my inner vision and\nmy outer, and what I saw in reality. That took a little bit. And it took a while for us to\nbecome comfortable with each other. I will have to admit that. I will have to admit that.",
        "Q: For you had gone from a child in a way, right?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, yes. And you see he didn't really know what we went through. He had his own\nstruggles. It's not that he had a bed of roses. He came up from nothing, and he had great\nsorrow to try to get us over. I have seen his notes after his death, that he never showed me\nactually. But I saw how he went from \u201cPontius to Pilate,\u201d from one person to the other,\nbegging for help \u2014 and nobody helped him. And that wasn't easy either. That couldn't have\nbeen an easy task either \u2014 and knowing that his family....",
        "Q: And what did he end up doing in the United States?",
        "A: He remained a butcher. Remember he had no real education. He first worked for some other\nJewish kosher butchers in Washington Heights in New York, and then he and his brother\nopened their own little butcher shop \u2014 Schild Brothers \u2014 and they became quite successful,\nbut always within the German Jewish community. And you see his fear of anyone non-\nJewish also never left him. He also carried the scar even though he didn't go through the\nworst. But he told me once when somebody came into the store that spoke English, they\nimmediately were afraid. They immediately thought it was someone to inspect the store, or\nto make trouble, or to want something from them. You see, we all, we all have our scars.\nYou can't go through this without scars \u2014 you just can't. So he was always afraid of anyone\nnot Jewish as well. Those were the enemies. But he lived to a ripe old age. He married again\n\u2014a woman who was in Theresienstadt and lost her husband and two children there. I never\nknew her there \u2014 I couldn't, it was much too big to know people. We were so restricted and\nthen she was much older. I didn't readily associate or become friendly with people of my\nparents' age. I stayed very much with my own age, and possibly with the very old people that\nI went to visit. But I never knew her, and she was very good to him \u2018til the day he died. And\nhe only died about nine years ago at the age of 92. He remained very religious. We became\nvery close too at the end. He never spoke \u2014 I always thought he would say something, at\nleast on his deathbed still, that he shouldn't have left us, or something like that, but he never\ndid. This is another thing I, I don't understand.",
        "Q: Did you talk together about what had happened?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: Hardly ever. I won't say never, but hardly ever.",
        "Q: And did he know what had happened to your mother and sister?",
        "A: Barely. Barely. Barely. I don't think he wanted to know.",
        "Q: And did you live together for a while?",
        "A: Yes, but very short, only \u2014 I married very soon after I came over. I married within six\nmonths, and so those six months we, we \u2014 he roomed with a family. After all he was\ncompletely alone. And that family took me also in and gave me a room in the same latch\napartment. So we were together for a while. But during that time we were not close, not at\nall. I could not find a way to him, and he, he was obviously guilt ridden too. He never really\nasked. Then toward the very end he gave me my mother's letters, and then, then he was\nalready mellowed, and he gave me my sister's letters, and my own letters. And then he gave\nme also the letters that I wrote to him from Switzerland, so I have a huge bunch of letters\nwhich, which are very, very, very interesting.",
        "Q: The last question, maybe \u2014 or the penultimate question. You said that after you became \u2014\nafter you were depressed and went to a therapist, and then was better, or well\u2014",
        "A: By a psychiatrist, right?",
        "Q: Right. That you decided that you had to do something.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I decided\u2014",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: Well, two things \u2014 one egotistical and the other altruistic. The egotistical first. I got myself\nan education. I went to college. My husband, my husband was always very understanding of\nme. He could see, he could see my whole situation much better than I could. And by then \u2014\nthis took a while. My first depression occurred after my first baby was born. And then I still\nwas very timid, very much afraid of authority, very much reluctant to approach anyone that\nwas in authority \u2018cause that was dangerous up \u2018til then. So then after a while I missed very\nmuch that I didn't have an education. And after a while then I went to Bates College in\nLewiston, and they accepted me as one of the very first non-College age students. See now,\nthis is different. This was in the \u201850s \u2014 in the \u201860s. I graduated in \u201871. I was only the second\nperson of non\u2014 of not eighteen years old. I was like 46 or 47, and I did alright. I graduated\nwith a lot of honors and I loved every moment of it. And then I was done. And then I didn't\nknow what to do again, so my husband urged me and he said, \"Go to graduate school.\nBecome a librarian,\" \u2018cause I liked books. And I did that and again I graduated, so now\nwhat? So he said, \"Take a job. Be a librarian.\" And Bates College took me as a librarian, and\nI was very happy there during the years.\nAnd then the second part comes in \u2014 the altruistic part if I may say so. Then I began to\nrealize Bates College, up to not too long ago, was a very Baptist college. When my husband\nbecame college physician in \u2014 soon after our marriage, in the early \u201850s, he was only the\nsecond Jewish employee of that whole college, and the college was in existence for some\n150 years or so \u2014 and very limited Jewish students and no Jewish activities. And they didn't\nknow Jews or Jewish contexts or nothing about the Holocaust. So an opportunity presented\nitself, ready made, and I stepped in. I got myself funding from the National Humanities\nCounsel, and from Jewish organizations, and I began to educate the College. I did programs\nof Jewish contexts, and I made month-long informational college affairs where the people\ncould hear speeches and ask questions, have dialogues, and simply inform themselves,\n\"What is Judaism? What are Jews? What are the finer points of it?\" And really, I was quite\nsuccessful. I got a Jewish library into the college, when the Rabbi of the city where I lived\ndied. This was all back in Maine. We settled in Maine. When he died I was instrumental in\ngetting his whole library into the College, and it's known now as the Rabbi Barrend(ph)\nJewish Library, and it's a fine, fine library. I catalogued it, and integrated it as a special\nlibrary. And that drew Jewish interest. And from that library \u2014 I used that again as my\nplatform \u2014 I gave Jewish talks, and got Jewish persons in. I had Hilberg. \u201d\u201d I had Lansky\u201d of\nthe Yiddish Center. I had Velvel Pasternak of Jewish music. I\u2014 who me? I brought all these\n* Raul Hilberg\n* Aaron Lansky\npeople in and I educated them. Then finally I saw a need \u2014 the people wanted to teach the\nHolocaust and they didn't know what to do. They didn't know how to teach it. So out of that\nactivity, out of all those Jewish affairs that I had organized, was some money left over in the\nend, and I organized the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine for the purpose of\nhelping the teachers teach the Holocaust. And that was a very fine success. I moved out of\nMaine, but the Center stayed, and we have an oral history project, of course. We have a\nteachers' guidebook. We have all kinds of things, were successful. And then I felt better. I\ndon't have a \u2014 I still feel terrible about my losses, but I don't feel guilty anymore. And I speak\nall around the country. And I hear students \u2014 I see there is a necessity to speak, because the\nstudents know only democracy. The constant question is, \"Well, why didn't you just not go,\"\nyou know. Or, \"Why didn't you say you weren't Jewish?\" Or, \"How come you had to give\nyour house up?\" They don't understand this. They're living in a democracy. They don't\nunderstand what it is to live in an autocracy. So I still \u2014 I still feel a need to talk and to write,\nand to answer questions. And I wrote a second book, and I'm writing one now for even\nyounger children, because they need to know.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you'd like to, to say, that you haven't said?",
        "A: I'm exhausted. That's what I'd like to say. You were a great interviewer, but you got all the\nthings out of me that were long buried, and that had to come up again, and had to be talked\nabout. My life is a patchwork. But the nice thing 1s that the good parts are the quilted ones.\nAnd the not good parts, they just are there. They just are there, but.... I still have nightmares.\nI still, I still have nightmares today, but during the day I'm a very happy person. Thank you.",
        "Q: Thank you very much.",
        "A: That's it. I'll refer them to you.",
        "Q: What are we seeing here?",
        "A: That's Ansbach. That's the house I was born in \u2014 Turnitzstrasse fiinf\u2019 * and behind those\nwindows on the left hand side was the bedroom. And 1n the front here on the right hand side\nof the door was my father's butcher shop. Nice. My mother and my father in happy times\nwalking away there. I think that's in Ansbach \u2014 near our house. It's not in front of our house.\nSiegfried and Paula Schild \u2014 very clear. Oh, that's a picture in Ansbach in our back yard.\nThat's my grandmother Sophie on the one side, and my Aunt Berta and a cousin visiting.\nAnd that's in the, in the yard where the chickens ran around, and the very background there,\nthat was my father's sausage room where he made the sausage. And on the side, I think that\n** Five (German)\nwas our compost heap, if I'm not mistaken. That was very rural, but happy times. That was\nstill in grade school though. That's a class picture still in grade school \u2014 still happy. I'm the\none with the pigtails on the top row, fourth from the right, skinny little gal \u2014 and still quite\nhappy. That must have been.... How old could I have been there? Eight or nine? Oh, then\nwe're already 16 or so \u2014 no, not quite. I'm not on that picture. My sister Friedl is the one on\nthe right hand side with the short hair; one of the few pictures I have of her. Of that whole\ngroup only two survived, and I'm still friendly with them. And my poor sister was, of course,\none of the victims. Yep, that's my sister Friedl. Yes, that was the youth group we had, always\nclustered around our beloved Rabbi, Eli Munk, and his wife there with the shaytel on, on his\nright, and on the right of Mrs. Munk is my sister Friedl \u2014 there, there she is. That's Friedl.\nAnd I'm there too. I'm in back between Mrs. Munk and Friedl, with the pigtails, and those\nwere such happy times. It was probably Shabbos afternoon when we were singing zmiros >\nand he was telling us stories, and those were such happy times. Most everybody else is gone\nin that picture, but it was the same. And that's Elie Munk again in the back, and all the boys \u2014\nprobably having another session with him and Mrs. Munk. And that was our Hebrew teacher\nthat fellow in the back. Ya, and that's our group. How pretty she was.",
        "Q: Can you point out your sister and yourself?",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "Q: Can you point out your sister and yourself?",
        "A: Ya. My sister is the one on the right hand side. Her friend has her arm around her. You can\nsee the hand. And in front of that same friend, that's me. Huh? Oh yes. That was a Purim\nplay. I think we were a farmer and his wife or something like that. That's in our back yard.\nAnd the background is simply my mother's bedspreads hung up there with clothespins \u2014 to\nkeep out all the rest of the back yard. And that's my sister and me, Friedl and Gerda Schild.\nMy grandmother Sophie Jochsberger \u2014 a very dear woman. She looms large in my memory \u2014\nalways kind \u2014 always time for me. A very sweet person.",
        "Q: When did she die?",
        "A: She died, thank God, she still died a normal death with her daughter in Regensburg, the one\nwe saw before. And she's buried in Regensburg. It was 19\u2014 about \u2014 no, later than that \u2014\nabout 1939, before the transportations. Oh, another picture from my happy youth, also in our\nback yard, the smokestack between Friedl and me is where my father smoked all the\nsausages, and on my left shoulder there, that's my father's grinding stone. He sharpened up\n95\nSongs (Hebrew)\nhis butcher knives there. I can still see that, and that's really the chicken yard right there \u2014 the\nchicken house \u2014 in back of the grindstone \u2014 and my mother's laundry hanging there \u2014 and\nFriedl and I just hanging out, as they would say now... Just being happy. Too bad she had to\n\u2014 she couldn't have a life. That's a much photographed back yard, I'm telling you. You can\nsee a typical Fachwerkhaus\u2019\u2019 house in the back there. There's my father, and Friedl and I,\nand my cousin Edith, the same one that was in the picture before \u2014 a very sweet little girl.\nShe came to us for summer vacations every year, and we always were happy together. Ah,\nanother picture of my happy youth. That was an outing with the whole group. It was called\nthe JJA; the Jewish Youth Group of Ansbach. And that's Friedl, the very \u2014 the white figure\non the right hand side \u2014 on the very right. And that's me, the second from the left. There I'm\nalready a tall girl. Also, I was the younger one. I very soon was taller than Friedl as you can\nalready see here. I've already surpassed her in height, and probably also in width, and she\nnever held it against me. She was much too good-natured for that. And the rest of the gang, I\nremember them all. Very few of them are still alive, unfortunately. Friedl and I \u2014 just little\npictures that somebody snapped. I'm on the top of the frame, and she's on the bottom.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea when this \u2014 these photos were taken?",
        "A: I would say that was taken in Munich, just before we left for nurses training. It's very\npossible that those were our official pictures to get into nursing training. Ya, that's me with\nmy nurse's uniform on. I was so proud of it. It was probably the first picture I sent back when\nI got to Berlin.",
        "Q: So that's 1940?",
        "A: 1940, exactly. That was a picture that I had taken once I was liberated into Switzerland, and I\ntook care of that little boy. I'm still in tact with \u2014 in contact with his family. Of course he's\nnow a 50 year old man, and I took care of him for a while. That's the Jewish star I was\nattached to from September, 1941 to February 12, 1945, when I ripped it off in the train that\ntook me to Switzerland. And you can see then I didn't take care anymore of it. Up to then, I\nhad to be very careful with it. If it looked like that, if I had worn it, I could have been shot.\nBut once I ripped it off in Switzerland, I didn't care anymore what it looked like, and you can\nsee the writing on it is simulated Hebrew lettering. It's so evil.",
        "Q: And it's about, what do you think \u2014 two and a half \u2014 next to a pencil \u2014 maybe two and a half\ninches?",
        "A: It was still the size of the \u2014 of the palm of your hand.",
        "Q: Okay.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Framework house (German)",
        "A: Yes, that was my Theresienstadt box. That was given to me on my birthday by one of my\nfriends who worked in \u2014 who probably worked in a woodcarving factory or something. It\nhad a cover at one time, which I have long lost. It's made of wood, and lined with some\npaper, and on the back of it, it says, \"Ghetto Theresienstadt,\" and the date of my birth \u2014 \"23rd\nof November, 19\u2014\" well, that was in \u201843 \u2014 23rd of November is my birthday, and it was\ngiven to me on my 21st birthday \u2014 1943. I was born in 22. And that was my birthday gift,\nand I treasured it ever since.",
        "Q: Was this Jirca who gave you...?",
        "A: I think so. I'm not altogether sure anymore who gave it to me. I think it was Jirca. He was my\nmost fervent, and I think my sole admirer in Theresienstadt. He swore that as soon as he\nwould come back from the Osttransport he would find me, and then he wanted to marry me,\nbut I think deep down we both knew that he would never come back. Now what you're\nseeing here is my permission to be a nurse in the Ghetto of Theresienstadt. It says here,\n\"Gerda Schild,\" and there is my ghetto number \u2014 the name meant nothing, the number was\neverything \u2014 and Ubikation, that meant where I lived. I was in C-3. That was still in the\nHamburger Kaserne, and it says here that I can now work as a nurse, and am permitted to\nwear a uniform, and it was signed by Erich Munk \u2014 he was the health officer there \u2014 and\ndated as well. And my place of work was going to be Q 721. That was later renamed\nBergstrasse seven.",
        "Q: Can you just explain the lettering. It was Q, and there was another letter\u2014",
        "A: Q and L. Originally the whole Theresienstadt was divided into Q streets which went one\nway, and L... Q meant queer \u2014 Queer and Long \u2014 and the others were longitude \u2014 Longitude\nand Queer, and Q and L, that was all there was. But then when the Commission came,\nsuddenly there appeared beautifully decorated little wooden signs on each street with fancy\nnames \u2014 Bergstrasse and Wiesenstrasse(ph), and what have you, and Q was 7 \u2014 was then\nBergstrasse 7. And this is my permission to go into the Swiss transport with my number\n1,174 on the right hand corner, and it tells me not to bring any ugly bedrolls \u2014 just to bring a\nneat suitcase and be gone. Oh, that's finally a picture of my family. I defied Hitler and started\na family and brought new Jews into the world. My husband and I, and those are my four\nchildren. Polly was probably \u2014 12 then. She's the one that later married Jean. And that's\nLen\u2019\u2019 who's now in Utah, and Hedy, \u00b0 who is in Minneapolis \u2014 She's the reason we moved\nthere, and that's David\u201d who just had a baby here in Washington. What a lovely group of\nkids.\n*\u2019 Len Haas\n*\u00ae Hedy Haas-David\n\u201d David Haas",
        "Q: And Polly's on the far left behind you.",
        "A: That's right. That's our Polly. That was in Maine approximately 1965, I would guess. And\nafter I brought up the children and defied Hitler one way, I went ahead and defied him again\nand told the story of my life, and other people's lives, and the history of the Holocaust in two\nbooks. This is the second book, and I'm still writing now another third book. And this is just\ncoming out by Lerner Brothers '\u201d\u201d in Minneapolis. I'm pretty proud of it.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n T ermer Group Publishing\n"

        "Q: No, I actually wasn't referring to sexual relations now. I really meant the friendships that\nwere like the friendship you had with Eva, because you're talking about a relationship that\nhelped you to survive, right?",
        "Q: And I was wondering whether you saw, among men, a similar kind of pairing of, you know.\nAnd were the pairings among men and women that weren't marriage, for instance, that were\nlove affairs, were they always love affairs, or was that because the men had access to things\nthat the women needed?

        "A: Good morning.",
        "A: I'm Gerda Haas, born Gerda Schild in Ansbach which 1s a small town in Germany \u2014 Bavaria\n\u2014 and I was born in November of 1922.",
        "A: Yes. Ansbach was \u2014 had a very religious Jewish community. We had some famous\nrabbanim\u2019 there \u2014 Elie Munk for instance who wrote The World Of Prayer, wrote it there in\nAnsbach while I was his student, and I was very friendly with him. We always experienced\nsome anti-Semitism in Bavaria \u2014 not outright \u2014 but we always felt we didn't belong to the\nwhole town, so it was a strong and purposeful Jewish community that we had. And almost\neverybody was deeply religious. My father was the Jewish butcher in town, naturally kosher.\nThere was nothing else. And we lived in a nice, heavy, solid stone house where we had lived\nfor many years. My grandmother lived with us, my Aunt Adelheid, an unmarried aunt and\nthere were two girls, myself and my sister Friedl. So 1t was a warm, extended, nice family.",
        "A: No. Mother only went into the butcher store when it got very busy. It wasn't done 1n those\ndays. Mothers didn't work.",
        "A: We were very close. It was understood that the younger generation took care of the older\ngenerations. There was never a question about it. We didn't even have any old age homes.\nThere was a little separate apartment for my grandmother where she could do her own\ncooking if she wanted to, but I have never seen \u2014 I never remember that she did. She always\nate and lived with us. And my Aunt Adelheid was \u2014 she had her own little business. She kept\nchickens and sold chickens, and I remember a lot how she took care of hens, and how she\ntook us out with her into the yard and we could feel for the eggs, and that was always a lot of\nfun. It was a very primitive, solid, early 1900's kind of a context that I grew up on.\n' Rabbis (Hebrew)",
        "A: Yeah, right in the backyard of our house. It was a big house and you walked through and out\ninto the yard, and there were the hens on one side and my father's sausage making machinery\nwould be way down on the other side. And my mother's vegetable garden on this side over\nhere. And our swing where my sister and I swang and played ball was on this corner here,\nand it was fun. We had very happy childhood until Hitler came when I was ten.",
        "A: If possible, closer to my mother because she was more around. Father used to get up at four\nin the morning to buy the cows that he needed for his butcher shop, and then he had to go to\nthe next town to have them shekhted, the Jewish way of slaughtering the meat. And then he\nhad to come back and he cut up that whole animal right in the backyard. I wasn't squeamish\nabout it. And so he was always busy. And when he came home he was short tempered you\nknow \u2014 the customers aggravated him. Mother always was even tempered and sweet and\nkind and pleasant.",
        "A: No. I only went there to get some sausage \u2014 eat a little bit.",
        "A: Yes. Aunt Adelheid provided Father with the chickens. They\u2019s also have to be shekhted the\nkosher way. I remember that quite well. At one time there was a phenomenon of a chicken\nrunning around with his head cut off already, the proverbial \u2014 he wasn't \u2014 somehow it didn't\ndie right away and flattered or flipped around for a few minutes.",
        "A: Yes, very religious \u2014 very Orthodox. There was nothing else in small towns. In fact, in all of\nGermany you were either very religious or you weren't aware of your Jewishness at all \u2014 you\nwere very, very Reformed. Conservative Judaism had not been invented, yet. So, yes, we\nwere very religious and interestingly enough, the religion was state supported. In other\nwords we always had to mark on taxes or on any forms \u2014 on birth certificates, wedding\nforms or anything \u2014 our affiliation. It was always Jewish because the state paid for the\nupkeep of the synagogue. The state paid for the salary of the Rabbi or the Hazan, or the\nShohet. So there was never a question that we were very Jewish, and everybody knew that\nand everybody, up to a certain point, respected it too.",
        "A: Yes, we did have non-Jewish friends but not real good chums. They were just the kids on the\nblock that we played with. My parents didn't restrict us in going out with only Jewish people.\nIt didn't seem a problem. We knew so much where we belonged and who we were that there\nwas no danger for us to intermingle or anything. So, yes, we did have non-Jewish friends up\nto a certain point. But the real close friends were the Jewish people.",
        "A: Yes. In grade school. I don't remember too much about grade school, but then I went to the\nLyzeum \u2014 that was like it would here be maybe a high school, and then junior college. That\nwas already considered higher education. The girls went to the Lyzeum and the boys went to\nthe Gymnasium,\u201d which here is an athletic term, but over there 1t was an academic term. So,\nyes I do remember that very well. I was admitted in 1933 at the age of 10 only because I\ncould prove that my father was a World War I veteran. Already, Hitler had just come to\npower in January. I was admitted to school that fall. And I remember I had to bring some\nproof that my father had received the Iron Cross First Class in World War One and otherwise\nI could not have gone. I would have already been repelled as a Jewish student. So I did go,\nbut I didn't stay very long. In 1936 there was a law that \u2014 it was phrased in that way \u2014\nGerman students do no longer have to be subjected to sitting in the same room with Jewish\nstudents. So of course it was the Jewish students who had to leave. I always thought it was a\nvery interesting way of framing it. In those early years Hitler was still a little bit more\ncautious and modest in his demands on us than he was later on. But up to then we were\naccepted. We did not \u2014 slowly we did not chum around with the German children anymore. I\nremember there were two Jewish students in my class, myself and Matilda Adler(ph). How\nsome names will stay with you all your life! And she and I were, little by little, we were\nostracized. I remember us standing in the corner in the school yard. We couldn't mingle with\nthe other kids anymore. And they weren't mean to us, but they were not allowed to be\nfriendly to us. If they would, they were being punished. And I also remember that I was not\nallowed to answer questions in school, even if I knew the answer. After a while I didn't even\nraise my hand anymore because I knew the teacher could not possibly call on me. As a\nJewish student I was supposed to be stupid. I was supposed to be ignorant. I was not \u2014 Jews\n\u2014 Hitler declared Jews as stupid, so how could I know any answers? And that hurt a while\nbut then I got use to it. But finally in \u201836 we had to leave. And I got as far as fourth grade in\nthere instead of the ordinary sixth grade. I didn't graduate. And that hurt because I didn't\nknow what else to do. I couldn't stay at home \u2014 and I couldn't go to any other school, so that\nthe childhood years were happy, but the school years already were not. And my sister who\nwas a year ahead of me \u2014 same story. She was the only Jewish girl in her class and she was\neven more ostracized and picked upon \u2014 and she was more timid than I was. I was always\nmore the \u201ctomboy\u201d type and she was very much more gentle and introverted than I was. So\n* High school (German)\nshe suffered actually more than I did. And when we came home we talked a little about it,\nbut then we tried to forget it and just integrate into our family.",
        "A: Did my parents give me any advice? I would say \u201cno.\u201d My parents already were wrapped up\nin their own problems. Already, very early in Hitler's reign, the Schechtverbot\u2019 came \u2014 and I\nthink what you mean by that. The Jews were no longer allowed to kill their animals 1n the\nritualistic way by shekhting. And I always thought that was such an irony. The reason Hitler\ngave for that Schechtverbot was, it was inhumane to the animals. Think about that for a\nminute. For the animals he had pity, but for us \u2014 he put us into the gas. There was no more\ninhumanity involved there. So in \u201838, being very considerate for those poor animals, there\nwas the Schechtverbot. And then Father had his own problems. I remember how Father and\nMother and grandmother and Aunt Adelheid used to sit in the room and just try to figure out\nwhat the future will bring. Now all he had to sell were the chickens, you see. For a while\nthere was frozen meat from Argentina, but who's going to buy frozen meat in 1936. It was\nunheard of. Nobody would touch it \u2014 and so he gave that up very quickly. And then there\nwas no more income, except for that little bit that we made on the chickens. And they were\nhaving problems. For a long time I remember Father saying, \u201cMir gehen mit dem letzten\nZug.\" That was Bayerisch\u201d \u2014 that was Bavarian dialect for \"We're going to go with the last\ntrain. We're going to stick it out. We're not gonna leave here.\" But after a while he had to\nrealize that there was no \"letzten Zug.\" There was not gonna be a last train. So they had their\nown problems, and no, we didn't bother them with our problems. They couldn't have helped\nus anyway. If we ever confided into anyone it was Aunt Adelheid and grandmother. They\nseemed to \u2014 they were very close to us. Does that give you a little picture of my home life? It\nwas a nice, close, lovely family. And then came 1938 \u2014 Kristallnacht\u00ae. For a while the non-\nJews were moderate in their intercourse with us. They held back, but they weren't hostile.\nAnd I remember some of the closer non-Jewish friends used to come to the back door at\nnight when no one would see them and used to bring us maybe a little bread or some fruit\nbecause already we couldn't buy everything we wanted to. All of a sudden that was \u2014 the\nJews couldn't really buy what they wanted.\n* Shekht prohibition (German)\n* We are going with the last train (Bavarian German)\n> Bavarian (German)\n\u00b0 Crystal Night (German); Night of Broken Glass.",
        "A: Well, little by little the merchants would become hostile to us. And when they saw us\ncoming the better things would disappear under the counter, like the better fruits. I remember\nthere were always Blut Orangen\u2019 from America \u2014 that was those red oranges from America\nwhich was \u2014 that was just a delicacy for us. I remember that so much. Mother used to bring\nthat home once in a while. But then as time went on, there were no more Blut Orangen. They\ndisappeared the minute they saw us coming. And so, little by little, there was hostility. And\ndearth by us, after a little while, and we became poor. I remember how we used to sit around\nthat Blaupunkt radio that we had. I can still remember that so well. You used to turn the\nknob and the whole dial would zoom back and forth. You didn't have to turn the knob little\nby little. You just touched it a little and the dial would fly away from you and you had to\ncatch it to where you wanted it. But no matter which station you took, there was always\nHitler's voice on the radio \u2014 always this frightening voice \u2014 this loud, hypnotizing speech\nthat he gave \u2014 always against the Jews and how he would make the life of the Germans\nbetter and better if they would just follow him and do away with the Jews \u2014 and the Jews had\ntaken all their good things \u2014 and the whole Versailles Treaty was the fault of the Jews. The\nhuge banners that came up over Ansbach that used to say, \u201cDie Juden sind unser Ungliick*\u201d\n\u2014\"The Jews are our misfortune. Everything bad that happened to the Germans is the fault of\nthe Jews.\" And my sister and I used to slink by those huge banners that were all over the city\nand we used to try just not to see them, thinking if we didn't see them, they weren't there. But\nthey were there. Little by little that really took over. And I remember the torch parades that\ncame. Hitler visited Ansbach many times actually. It was a stronghold for the SA, the earlier\ngroup as you know. First came the SA and then came the SS The SA was the\nSturmabteilung\u201d and then the SS was the Schutzstaffeln\u2019\u201d. They actually \u2014 it started out as a\npersonal body guard of Hitler, but then the SA was pushed aside and the SS became the\ndominant military and civil force in Germany. But I remember still the SA going down our\ncobblestone streets with their large torches and singing and marching. And these were all\nyoung kids that we still knew at one time before they became SA It was always frightening.\nAnd when Hitler came into town the Jews, of course, were ordered to stay away \u2014 stay off\nthe streets. And also an interesting thing was, in the Nuremberg Laws what we thought was\nthe least ominous law was, that the Jews could not fly the German flag. That, you know, we\nthought that we could live with. Well, who wants it to fly the German flag? But it turned out\nthat was also a seminal law. Right away they could tell which house was Jewish because\neverybody else had to fly the flag. So that was also an interesting law. That was up to\nKristallnacht. After that 1t was no problem anyway.\n\"Blood oranges (German)\n* The Jews are our misfortune (German)\n\u201d Storm troopers (German)\n\u201d Protection Squads (German)\ndifficult situation?",
        "A: No, except the kids used to \u2014 after a while they threw stones at us, or they made snowballs\nwith a stone inside you know and hit it at us, and we didn't know. And that was, of course,\nlike a missile. And we couldn't retaliate. We couldn't throw a snowball back. Number one,\nwe were much too timid, and number two, they would have just killed us if we had. They\nwere already \u2014 now the Hitlerjungend.\u2019' Both the boys and the girls had to be in the\nHitlerjungend, the youth organization of the SS, and they were all powerful. When they had\ntheir little Hitleryungend\u2019s uniforms on, they felt like they were God themselves. Otherwise,\nback to your question, no, I have not seen anyone being beaten up. But I will tell you, we\ndidn't provoke them. We stayed in our houses and we slunk around the streets and if we saw\nanyone\u2014",
        "A: Well, when you are 10 years old and from that time on, and my sister was only a year and a\nhalf older, when you're constantly told that you are stupid, and \u2014 they called it \"\nUntermensch,'\u201c\" \u201csubhuman\u201d \u2014 and you personally are responsible for everything that's\ngoing wrong in all of Germany, and practically in all the world, and you can't shine in any\nway. You can't let your imagination, or your intellect, or your normal physical appearances\ncome up and speak for yourself \u2014 for itself, after a while that does something to you. After a\nwhile \u2014 after 10 years of this, you believe you are stupid. You believe you look Jewish and\nyou look ugly and you are not worthy of anything. And it really took a while to get over this.\nAnd you know I see some older people nowadays that have gone through this whole thing\nand it looks to me as if they haven't gotten over it yet. They still feel that they are the less\nhuman \u2014 the lesser human race \u2014 and I still \u2014 they look depressed to me. I think I got over it,\nbut during the time I believed I was no good. I believed I was a second rate human being. It\nwas a terrible thing to do. And you must understand, on the other hand, these very same kids\nthat went to school with me who up to then were nothing, they came from a downtrodden,\nbroken home, they had no clothes to wear, they \u2014 in many cases they had to come to the\nJewish families to beg for food and substances, they were suddenly dressed up in their Nazi\nuniforms and their \u2014 first in their Hitlerjungend uniforms, which were splendid. They were\nbeautiful, and later on they were dressed up in their SA and SS uniforms, underneath they\nwere still very mediocre, very pedestrian German people. But all of a sudden they were\nshining, they were beautiful. And don't forget, a uniform really does something to you\npsychologically. These people not only had their uniform on, but they felt they were the\nuniform. They felt they could do beautiful things just because they looked so great. And they\ndid. They got away with it.\n' Hitler youth (German)\n'* Sub-human (German); term used to refer to people deemed inferior according to Nazi racial\ntheory.\nAs you very well know, one of the very first laws that Hitler put onto the books in Germany\nwas the Gestapo Law of 1936 which stated that anyone in an SS, in a Nazi uniform, would\nstand above the law \u2014 could do anything they wanted to, could up to kill the Jews openly on\nthe street. As long as they were in their Nazi uniform the law could not touch them. Now if\nyou think of it, we on the other hand were since the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, staatenlos,\u2019\u201d\nstateless. That means we had no recourse to the law. Any injustice that was done to us, forget\nit. There was no law to go to, to complain. But they \u2014 and the psychological effect of that is\nnot to be underestimated. They were indeed the supermen the all powerful, unapproachable.\nNo law could touch them. And as we, when we were ten years old were told how low we\nwere, they were told how great they were \u2014 and by the time they were 20 and 25 and we met\nthem again in the killing centers, their psychology had changed just as much as ours had. I\ndon't know how to impress upon you what a uniform will do a person. It suddenly makes\nhim into a semi-god. And Hitler was no dummy about that. His uniforms were beautiful,\nshiny; those boots, those helmets, all those buttons and rows of things. And then the names,\nthey all of a sudden were \u2014 they weren't just Johann Schmidt anymore \u2014 they were\nOberscharfiihrer'* and they were Blockleiter.'\u201d And the kids already they were \u2014 I can't\nremember all the German names, but suddenly they got a title. They were somebody. And\nthey had quite forgotten that underneath the uniform there was really nothing much, but\nthat's \u2014 but you don't know that when you're stuck in it. You only know that 50 years later\nwhen you acquire a little overview and a little insight. But that was part of the success of the\nNazis \u2014 those uniforms, and the singing, and the torch parades. That was uplifting to them\nand to the spectators \u2014 to the people who watched. They suddenly belonged.",
        "A: I don't think so. I don't think we were angry. I don't think we were allowed anger. We were\njust allowed fear, fear and trembling. I still remember so well when they sat around the table\nat night and worried, and worried, \u201cWhat are we going to do? What are we going to do with\nthe kids?\u201d We couldn't go to school anymore. \u201cHow are we gonna live?\u201d Anger was far\naway. Worry and fear was the dominant emotions. And then the belief in God, that never left\nus. \u201cGod will help. God will bring resolution. Hitler won't last long. Hitler's gonna be gone\nfrom the scene by Christmas. Hitler's gonna be gone from the scene by spring. No, he\nwasn't.\u201d We believed our own wishes. We didn't believe Mein Kampf \u00b0 and all the raging\nspeeches that he gave \u2014 that he prophesied that he would make Germany \u201cJudenrein.\u201d\u2019 That\n\"> Stateless (German)\n4 Upper crowd leader (German)\n'\u00b0 Block leader (German)\n'\u00b0 My Struggle (German)\nwas the big deal. It went in one ear and out the other for us. What does he mean \u201cJudenrein\u201d?\nThis is not a word we grew up with. So we ignored it. But he knew what he meant and he did\nit too. Now I get angry when I think about it, but in those days, no, there was no anger. There\nwas only great, great fear. And then we gathered around our Rabbi and he told us...\nEverybody was so short-sighted. Everybody was so blind. Even the Rabbi, whom we\nthought had real insight and foresight and a direct line to God you know, he said, \"Don't\nworry. Everything will be alright. Don't leave Ansbach. Stay, stay, stay.\" But unfortunately,\nthen he was the first to leave. He went and got a job in Paris as a Rabbi and he left. And that\nopened our eyes after that. We too began to leave. That hurt me more than anything else \u2014\nthat our Rabbi left us our beloved Rabbi. It's like your father leaving you. That was\ninteresting in retrospect.",
        "A: I mustn't get too wound up in all my memories and emotions here.",
        "A: When did he leave? He left \u2014 I think he left in \u201836 before Kristallnacht. I'm not sure on that\nanymore. It might have been after Kristallnacht. I'm not sure anymore. But I was especially\nclose to him and to all his children and to his wife, and I felt a great sense of loss when he\nleft so suddenly without telling us \u2014 and still preaching to the last minute \u2014 \u201cStay, be calm,\nGod will help, God will send rescue.\u201d And in the meantime he had already arranged for\nhimself a job in Paris.",
        "A: I'm sorry?",
        "A: I was too young to know what cynical was. Those emotions you are mentioning are luxuries.\nWe were just plain, down to earth. We just dealt with the basics here \u2014 hope, anger and\nalways the belief in God. That never left us. And in a way it was a big help. It was a big help.\nWe would have despaired if we didn't have that, that hope for the future.",
        "A: Yes. I did. I did, but in a modified way. We grew up very religious, as I said. There was\nnothing else. And we adored our Rabbi. We would do anything he would tell us to. And I'm\nnot only speaking of my sister and myself. But that whole youth group whose picture you\nhave seen. We gathered around him every Shabbos and we were devoted to him. That great\nfaith, I think, helped me a great deal, because later on when things really got... What I'm\ntelling you now, that's not bad. That's just the beginning. But later on when things really got\nbad, then there was nothing else to cling to. And I wonder if people understand that, that you\ncan still be religious and believe in God even though you see what \u2014 let's say, what God is\ndoing all around you. I don't want to have to explain what I just said. But on the one hand\nyou see all the evil that \u2014 in our religious mind was still sent from God. And on the other\nhand, you come inward and you still believed he would help \u2014 and that was a big help. It\nreally was. It sounds like an irony, but it was a big help. And then later on when I was\nrescued, and I found my father again. Then again also my mother and my whole family had\ndied. Again there was at least that much reason to be grateful to God who had saved me, and\nhad saved my father. And then I married a religious man. I tried to bring up my children\nreligious. And it's a problem. You can't live without it and you can't live with it, but most of\nall you can't live without it. So it's a way of life now. It's a way of life.",
        "A: Yes. I remember that very well also. My sister was already old enough. First of all she had\ngraduated. She was two years ahead of me. She had graduated from the Lyzeum and now\nshe \u2014 there was nothing else to do. There was no post-graduate or college or anything \u2014\nforget it. She could either go to Hakhshara'\u2019 to prepare herself for Israel \u2014 for Palestine, but\nremember we were going with the last train so there was no need to go to Palestine. We\nweren't leaving Ansbach. So she went to a girls Landwirtschaftschule\u2019* \u2014 a girls preparation\nfor... just to be a wife and a mother. It wasn't Landwirtschaftschule, it was Wolfratshausen.\nHow can I explain it to you? It was a preparatory school for young women \u2014 for young\nladies. I remember she came back and she showed me how she learned how to fold linens so\nthat they would look like military in the shelves. You know, that's the kind of thing they\nlearned. Much good that did us. And I was too young to go there, so I went to the one Jewish\nschool that was still in existence. That was the Adass Jisroel Schule in Berlin. Now Berlin\nwas far from Ansbach. It was like 300 kilometers and that was far. Remember, we're in\n1930s in Europe. We're not in the 1990s in America. Berlin was far and I didn't know\nanybody. I had to live in the dormitory and I didn't know any kids. And now the bigger\nproblem was that I didn't have the correct preparation for a Jewish school. I had only gone to\nmy Rabbi during the section that was called \u201creligion,\u201d \u2014 \u201creligion,\u201d when the Catholics\nwent to their priests and the Protestants went to their father, to their religious leader, we went\nto Elie Munk, to Rabbi Munk. And that's all the religious education we had that one hour a\nweek where we had religion. So I was not prepared for that and of course I did very poorly.\nSo that reinforced my thinking that I really was stupid and minor, even in the Jewish school I\n'\u2019 Hakhshara He-Halutz [Pioneer Training] (Hebrew)\n8 Agricultural school (German)\n\u201d Religion (German)\ncouldn't excel, you see. So it was tough. And then I was called home after Kristallnacht. I\nremember driving through Berlin and seeing the synagogues in flames and all the glass on\nthe streets and the people huddled and depressed. And it was very obvious that what had\nimpacted upon me psychologically had impacted on all the Jews. They walked around like\nthe victims \u2014 like the hunted. And I was in the train, and I was going toward Ansbach, and\nthere my family had been taken to a collection center. Father had been sent to prison along\nwith all the men. And Mother and all the women had already been sent back home and were\npacking. And we couldn't take more than we had that we could carry, and we had to leave\neverything. And I remember the name of the man that was just \u2014 just a very simple little\nfellow who was ordered by the Nazis to take over our house. And he already had moved in\nwith his eight kids. And we were still packing and leaving and going to the railroad station,\nand then we realized really what was going on. Then Father didn't talk about the last train\nanymore. And, then we went \u2014 we could only go to certain cities. We couldn't just pick up\nand leave and buy a new house, or go to a new apartment \u2014 far from it. We were told which\ncities to go to and we were told to go to Munich, and we were also told to just find someone\nto live with. And we found a distant relative \u2014 well it doesn't matter \u2014 there was some\nrelationship there, who took us into one spare room that they had. And then Father and all\nthe uncles and cousins all came back, all their hair shorn. The Munich Jews had been sent to\nDachau, whereas the Ansbach Jews had been sent to, to prison in Nuremberg. And I\nremember how they all came back from the Dachau with their heads completely shorn, and\nthen we began to wake up. Then we still only thought that the men were in danger. Who\ncould think that they would kill women and children, or old people, or Rabbis, or respected\nbusiness people or anything? So then Father was lucky and he got onto a convoy that the\nBritish Jews had organized and he got into that convoy as a butcher, and they went to\nSandwich, England, to the Kitchener camps, with the hope \u2014 this was in July of 1939. There\nwas no talk of war, yet. Hitler kept that very secret. It was \u2014 that was like a bombshell when\nthe war started. So in July, a little more than one month before the beginning of the war in\nPoland, there was no fear of war. So we thought that my father could find domestic positions\nfor us and bring us over after him. But the war ended that.",
        "A: That was only a transport for men from 18 to 45 years old and Father was just 45. It was a\nmiracle he even got in.",
        "A: So Father left. It was very traumatic because families were sacred \u2014 were holy. You didn't\nseparate. You didn't divorce. That was not heard of. That was unheard of. You didn't leave\nyour family. You didn't separate. You didn't leave your family alone. So that was very\ntraumatic when my father left in that train in the railroad station in Munich. And my mother\nwho was a typical Orthodox Jewish woman with a shaytel\u201d\u201d on and completely helpless.\nEverything she did \u2014 she ever did, she was told by her husband. People were like that. I\nknow it sounds medieval, but they were married off as youngsters, completely natve and\nthen they were told, \"Your husband will tell you what to do.\" And my father always told her\nwhat to do. And all of a sudden she was alone. And I remember how devastated she was and\nhow helpless at first. But then she had to learn. The money \u2014 the little bit of money that she\nreceived from the house was put into an account and she was only allowed a little sum every\nmonth. And she had to go and humiliate herself and beg for that \u2014 her own money \u2014 to get a\nlittle money so she could live another month. And then she sent us away. She sent my sister\nto Frankfurt, to the Jewish hospital. It was called Gagernstrasse. And I was a little too young\nto be a nurse. I was just old enough to be a baby nurse. And there's a division we don't have\nin this country, but I became a baby nurse. I was barely seventeen, and I was to Berlin.",
        "A: I remember the train station very vividly. I'm sure he talked with my mother, but the talk was\nnot \u2014 not morbid. The goodbye was not like a final thing \u2014 like a finite goodbye. It was, \"I'll\ndo all I can to get you positions.\" And the British helped. The British Jews helped. And it\nworked for many people in that transport. Later on in New York I met many comrades of my\nfather's who had gone with him into the transport and they were able to bring their wives and\nchildren, and mothers and fathers over to England still. But somehow it just didn't work for\nmy father. After he died I found his notebook that he wrote. Every day he went and tried to\nfind a family who would take us in. Of course he didn't speak English. He had no money. It\njust didn't work. But of course we also thought we had all the time in the world.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. And I remember she couldn't quite manage with money because she had only so\nlittle bit. So she went to a cousin of mine who still was there and he helped her out so that\nshe could pay for me. It was such a small sum compared to now, but still she didn't have it.\nAnd so we left, and again it was \u2014 it was not a big goodbye. But as soon as I was in Berlin,\nthen we had to wear the star. Then there was a law that we couldn't travel. Then there was a\nlaw we couldn't use telephones \u2014 public telephone stations. So all of a sudden we were\ncompletely cut off from her. No way of going back and no way of talking with her \u2014 just\nletters, letters, letters, letters. And she \u2014 the letters that she wrote to my father, she always\ntried to include letters from us. And my father gave me that whole bunch of letters. I still\n*\u201d Wig (Yiddish)\nhave it at home. First she writes \u2014 and she writes always the same \u2014 \"How am I going to get\nout of here? What's my quota? Who is going to help me? How am I going to find the money\nto...\" Just this grinding, grinding worry all the time. And then the one ray of sunshine, \"And I\ninclude a letter from the children.\" So she always waited until she got mail from us, from my\nsister in Frankfurt and from me. And we wrote, more or less normal \u2014 how we enjoyed our\ntraining \u2014 especially I, I worked with children, you see. And my sister, how she liked being\ntrained as a nurse and how interesting 1t was, and how she made friends. This was a new life\nfor her. All of a sudden my sister had friends, and she could shine, and she was a great nurse.\nAnd she sent back a picture in her uniform. Now she too had a uniform. That was really\nsomething. Those were a couple of happy years that we had. And I too had a uniform.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. I would say so. We wrote to my mother all the time and she wrote back. Of course\nto us she didn't write these \u2014 these heavy letters. To us she just told what she did and who she\nmet and how she manages. For the first time in her life she was alone. She grew up in a\nfamily with five sisters. She was never, never, never alone. She never went to school or\nanything. And all of a sudden she was quite alone. That was traumatic. So she wrote what\nshe did.",
        "A: Yes \u2014 No. Those people left \u2014 those distant relatives. They all left. And I remember how she\n\u2014 how hurt she was. They all left kind of secretly. All of a sudden, you know. There was a\ngreat jealousy among the Jews against those who could leave and those who could not leave.\nAnd there was a great rivalry also you see. The ships\u2019 places were very rare, and the quota\nwas coveted \u2014 to be on the quota was heaven \u2014 to finally reach the quota. So the people who\nwere lucky like that kept that very secret \u2014 very much to themselves. They didn't say. And\nthen all of a sudden, this family left. I met them again years later in New York and that was a\nbig blow to us. And we stuffed \u2014 they finally allowed us to put a few things into their lift \u2014\ninto their package \u2014 and that's how we saved a very few of our treasured things that weren't\nso valuable, but they were very much treasured by us. And when I met them again in New\nYork, of course I was also... In a way we were very grateful for them. They had taken us in.\nBut in another way we felt very hurt that they snuck out. So that apartment was confiscated\nby the Nazis and we had to find another Jewish family. Now it got much more difficult\nalready. So there was this Frau Frankel(ph) who took us in, who had \u2014 her husband was still\nalive. And I met them later in Theresienstadt again. She and my mother then became friends.\nShe was an elderly woman.",
        "A: Frankel's house, yes. That was the only way you could live anywheres. You had to move in\nwith someone. You couldn't rent an apartment \u2014 please. You have to think how this was now\n\u201839. Hitler was very outspoken what he was going to do with us. And that whole, that whole\nconcentration into bigger cities, and to live with other Jews, that was nothing but a\npreparation for picking us up with greatest of ease to take us onto the deportations, you see.\nThey didn't have to go anymore to the little farmhouses and to the little hamlets and to the\nlittle towns. They were already Judenrein.\u201d\u2019 And you could see now, how that was a\nsystematic concentration of the Jews \u2014 to pick them up and take them to the cattle cars.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. No. I still moved with her to Mrs. Frankel's, and my sister also. And that was just one\nroom, you see. So, in a way, it was great to go to Berlin. In a way I said goodbye to her with\nthe greatest of joy. She was with Mrs. Frankel. I knew she wasn't all alone. And I was\nlooking forward \u2014 we were still thinking we'd have a life. We weren't, we weren't aware that\nwe were all \u2014 that was the last year, or last two years of our lives. I was looking forward to\nbeing a nurse.",
        "A: She volunteered a little. She volunteered in the old age home. This was before deportation.\nIn fact my mother was on the first train out of Munich. But we didn't know from deportation\nat that point. The word was unknown to us \u201cDeportation\u201d did that mean? And the other word\n\u2014 the other term that was used was \u201cArbeitstransport.\u201d Those were all \u2014 there was a whole\nnew terminology coming up that meant very little to us. \u201cJudenrein,\u201d \u201cJudenfrage,~\u201d\n\u201cLosung der Judenfrage.~\u201d You know, there were \u201cOsttransport.\u201d\u2019\u201d What did that mean? So\n\u201cDeportation\u201d was not a word that was heard of when I left my mother. I thought she\nwould stay there. Now, by then, \u2014 no, not yet. A little later Father got to America. And then \u2014\nyes, Father already had gotten to America in \u201839. He was shipped out very quickly. And that\nwas \u2014 now we're talking about 1940. Mother is alone and the letters that she writes to Father,\n*! Jew Pure (German); Nazi term used to describe areas that had been completely purged of their\nJewish population.\n** Jewish question (German)\n*\u00b0 Answer to the Jewish question (German)\n* East transport (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Deportation (German)\nwhich Father gave me later on so I'm very much in the picture what was happening through\nthose letters. Now she goes to the immigration station daily, daily, daily. That was her daily\nwork \u2014 to see if she could get out. And he in America was begging for money to buy the visa\nand to buy the ship's cards for the three of us. And still there was this thinking that the three\nof us would stay together. And then in one letter, that's like an \u2014 that's like an, like an\nepiphany already. In one letter she writes, and that was already very late when it was already\nmuch too late \u2014 she writes, \"Siegfried, don't try to get the three of us out. Just get the children\nout. Forget about me,\" she says. So then she volunteered a little bit in an old age home. And\nthen in 1941, when she was 45 years old, she got into Transport. By then I was in Berlin at\nthe Jewish hospital. And then my sister also ended up in Berlin because the Gagernstrasse\nwas Closed. And for a short while we were together. And even when she goes into the\ntransport, the last letter to my father she says, \"Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.\nEverybody else is going too. And I'm packing all my warm clothes. And I'll see you when all\nthis 1s over.\" Now we can talk about Berlin.",
        "A: No. I found out that she was going in the transport just before she went. She called us. She\nhad to go to a public \u2014 she had to go to the Jewish Community to use the phone. She was not\nallowed into a public phone. So she could call us in the Jewish hospital. We still had a\nphone. And then we had to call her back, pre-arranged, that she'd be at the Jewish\nCommunity in Munich. And she \u2014 first we tried to go with her. And number one, we couldn't\nget onto a train, we already wore the star. And, and number two, she said, \"Don't go with\nme.\" She says, \u201cThere's no use. I'll work, and what's the use?\" And then somehow she knew\nthat the transport was going to Riga. That was on the 1 1th of November \u2014 on the ninth of\nNovember, 1941. It was one of the very first transports out of Germany. That was before,\nthat was before the Wannsee Conference, when the killing was not really automatic yet. And\nstill, in Riga, as I later found out, they were killed as soon as they got there. But still we\nhoped that we would see each other again. We had no idea that they were killed right away.\nWhen I got to Theresienstadt, I was so happy. I thought I would find my mother. I would\nfind people again. We didn't know there was such a widespread transport system\n\u201cTagersystem.\u201d\u201d We thought, \"Well,\" you know, \"Everybody will see each other again.\"",
        "A: The whole group of the Gagernstrasse Hospital from Frankfurt. First there were deportations\nout of there. And then when the hospital got smaller and smaller, 1t was closed. And the\n* Camp system (German)\nremaining people all came to Berlin to work Zwangsarbeit,\u201d\u2019 forced labor at the Siemens\nfactory. To this day I can't buy anything from Siemens, believe me. So my sister was one of\nthem. And later on that whole group went to Auschwitz. But for a short while we were\ntogether and we could see each other on our days off. We couldn't use the U-Bahn* or the\nCity Bahn~ transportation or anything. We had to walk. We had to walk with our star. And\none of the thousands of laws that concerned us, that are really not well known, was that Jews\ncould not walk in any greenery, in any park, in anything that was planted and was pretty.\nThat was for Aryans only. So where there was a park \u2014 the Tiergarten\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and no matter what\nwe had to walk around it. We couldn't go through it. So I remember walking and walking\nand walking to visit her and then walking back. And we had to be home at a certain hour, so\nit was very restricted. The Berlin years were difficult years. The Ansbach years were mostly\nhappy, and the Munich years were ignorance. Dominant emotion was naivet\u00e9. What was\ngoing on we had no idea and still a lot of hope. But Berlin and our eyes were opened and all\nthe many laws that we had to respect that Hitler made. The whole, the whole Losung der\nJudenfrage \u2014 the whole deportation of the Jews was done legally. That's the ironic part. First\nhe made a law, then he killed us. You see? But how did we know that? We knew the law and\nwe tried to live with it. Then we already were, were very much the victims. We looked very\nbad. We had no more \u2014 we couldn't get clothing coupons. I remember we couldn't get\ncoupons to have our shoes repaired. So we walked around in shoes that were ready to be\nthrown out. We couldn't get new ones. That's without even saying. But we couldn't get our\nold ones repaired either. So we had no clothes. We had bad shoes. We were not well\nnourished. We had the star. We didn't need the star. We marked as victims from the inside\nout, and from the outside as well. Where as they got better and better \u2014 well fed and more\nvictorious, and more triumphant every day.\nIn the hospital, first I was in Niedershonhausen and then that was dissolved, and then I went\nin Berlin. I'm telling you how bad everything was, and yet there was that little nucleus of\nhappiness still, you know. We were among Jews. We could talk with them. We had our own\nlittle kingdom. We had our own little hierarchy. I was just a student nurse. I was nobody, but\nthe hierarchy went to the Head Nurse, and it was heaven when the Head Nurse was friendly\nwith you, which was not the case in my case. I never got enough self-confidence up to talk to\na head nurse, and she wasn't that much older than I was. And then, of course, there was the\nwhole hierarchy \u2014 all the physicians that seemed like demigods. And then there was the\nwhole god; that was Lustig \u2014 Dr. Lustig \u2014 Dr. Walter Lustig. He had two Doctors. He called\nhimself Doctor Doctor Walter Lustig. He was a very prominent Jew before the Nazis came.\nHe was married to an Aryan woman \u2014 to an Aryan physician woman and that was why he\nwas saved for quite a while. I'll get back to Lustig in a minute, but as you know the Mischlin\n*\u2019 Forced labor (German)\n8 Untergrund Bahn [Underground train] (German); Subway.\n\u201d Train (German)\n*\u00b0 Zoological garden (German)\n\u2014 the Mischehe\u201d' and the Mischlinge\u201d were a big problem to Hitler, and in fact the hospital\nremained in existence because of that problem of the Mischlinge and the Mischehe. They\ncouldn't divorce. The Pope didn't allow that, and Hitler couldn't treat the Aryan person as a\nJew, and he couldn't really accept the Jew as an Aryan, so he tolerated them. And it was\nalways a.... I'm sure you're familiar with the history of the Mischlinge. That was obviously a\nthorn in his side. And the children of those Mischlinge were also a big problem. And\nTheresienstadt was partly organized for those Mischlinge. They couldn't very well go into\ntheir death. After all, in many cases they had a pure Aryan father or... who was fighting for\nHitler on the front. So anyway, Lustig was married to an Aryan woman and he got the job as\nleader of the Jewish hospital.\nEnd of Tape #1\n*' Intermarriage (German)\n** Mixed breed (German); Nazi term used for individuals of mixed Jewish and non-Jewish\nheritage.\nTape #2",
        "A: It's so long ago. It still gets to me.",
        "A: As much as I can remember. Let\u2019s see. I was of course involved in my own work at the\ntime? When she first came to Berlin I was still in Niedershonhausen and I remember the\nHead Nurse of Niedershonhausen who was a lovely old lady, whom I was very attached to,\nused to invite my sister on her day off to come to me because my sister lived 1n \u2014 they all\nlived together in a big room. Very Spartan, nothing there at all, just beds and a chair or what\nhave you. So it wasn't much fun to spend the day off there. So the Oberschwester, > the Head\nNurse of Niedershonhausen \u2014 as much as I loved her I forgot her name now, I don't recall her\nname \u2014 invited my sister. So my sister walked. And I remember the Head Nurse then\ninstructed the kitchen to serve my sister and me a fried egg. Now that \u2014 need I say more? In\n1940, the end of 1940, we were each eating a fried egg in Berlin. I remember how much that\nmeant to us, and also nutritionally, my sister was very much down. They didn't have good\nfood and they worked very hard. They did factory work. I don't exactly know what they did.\nShe never talked about it. But in one of the letters to my mother \u2014 and then she sent it to my\nfather \u2014 she writes that she has been chosen to be the camp nurse \u2014 that she's taking care of\nthe little injuries, etc., etc., and that apparently was quite an advantage for her, and she was\nvery proud of it also. And then all of a sudden they were detailed into a transport and I don't\nrecall too much about that. I remember going to her dormitory at the Siemens factory and\nthey had left. There was this empty big room with nothing there. There was one hat that I\nremember she wore and that was sitting on her bed, and I took that hat and walked back\nhome. I don't recall my emotions or anything. I probably blocked them out and, again, the\nhope was that we would all see each other when we all got deported. That was always the\none \u201cglimmer\u201d of the deportation. We always thought we would see each other again. We\nwould also get there \u2014 like death, and you see your people again up in heaven, but that was\nnot the way it worked \u2014 was the concentration camps.",
        "A: I think she was a lot more realistic than I was. I, after all, lived in a little Jewish nucleus in\nthe middle of Nazism. We were served our meals. We didn't have to go scrounging around or\n* Head nurse (German)\ngo to the grocery stores, which by that time already were restricted. The Jews could only go\nto certain grocery stores 1n the city during certain hours, and buy only certain things with\ntheir rations. That was all spared to me. We got our meals served and we didn't much ask\nwhere they came from. So I was much better off. Her rations \u2014 she worked hard and I think\nher rations were minimal because I remember so clearly how she enjoyed that egg. So she\nmust have had very poor food. And I don't remember too much. I remember that we wrote to\nmy father a lot when we got together and I don't, I don't remember what we wrote, but I\nknow what we wrote from reading the letters 30 years later and she writes \u2014 I remember\nespecially in one letter she writes, \u201cKann denn niemand etwas fir uns tun?\u201d\u201d\u201d \u201cCan't\nanybody do anything for us?\" We had, after all by then, the major part of our family here and\none part of the family in particular that moved to Argentina with all their money didn't help\nus at all. And I've never quite forgiven them that. They could have helped us. They had the\nmoney and we could have gone into Argentina. The quota wasn't that strict. And I remember\nespecially from her letter, \u201cKann dem Tante Lina garnichts ftir uns tun??? \u2014 \u201cCan't Aunt\nLina\" \u2014 who was the one there \u2014 \"do anything for us.\" So she was much more realistic than I\nwas. I didn't write such things. I only wrote about my nursing and my friends that I made and\nhow much I liked it, and things like that. She was much more with the times than I was. And\nAunt Lina unfortunately did nothing either. That was very, very sad that my own family\ndidn't gather around and pulled out as much as, as many as they could.",
        "A: Well I think it was simply because they were a big institution and \u2014 I don't know. I never\nwondered. It never occurred to me to wonder. But we actually still had kosher food. That\nwas the amazing part. That whole business with the Jewish hospital 1s very intriguing indeed,\nand I'm doing some research on it now. Up to my deportation in *43, there was a kosher\nkitchen in the Jewish hospital, which is phenomenal. And there were a few people, one of\nthe housekeepers, a couple of the physicians and several of the nurses, who trotted there\nevery meal time and got their kosher meals served, so how? I don't know where they got it\nfrom. And why the Jewish hospital remained in existence and was \u2014 never even the name\nchanged, Das Jiidische Krankenhaus\u201d\u201d it was called \u2014 and on Iranische Strasse\u2019\u2019 number two\n\u2014and it's still there. You can still go there and see the same building \u2014 rebuilt. It was bombed\nout after I left. And now I haven't done the research yet, so whatever my opinions are at the\nmoment are my own speculations. I think, number one, Lustig, Dr. Lustig was very much in\nwith the Nazi supervision of the hospital. He was as much of a puppet as anybody else of\ncourse. And I am still friendly with one of the nurses now that was there, and she was\n* Can\u2019t anyone do anything for us? (German)\n* Can Aunt Lina do nothing for us? (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 The Jewish Hospital (German)\n*\u2019 Street (German)\nfriendly with him. And she tells of the story which I totally believe, which is completely\nwithin the context of what I remembered. She says many times she would be with him and\nhe would answer the telephone with, \"Hello. Dr. Lustig,\" and he would immediately put it\ndown again. Then the phone would ring again and he would say, \u201cDer Jude Lustig, hier.\u201d\nYou see. They didn't accept if he just... If they were calling him, they didn't want just \u201cDr.\nLustig.\u201d They wanted \u201cDer Jude Lustig, hier.\u201d So he was a puppet. There's no question\nabout it. Within the Jews he was all powerful naturally. He was the one that made up the\nlists. He was the one that put cross checks on who should go into transports of nurses,\ndoctors, personnel, patients. He was the all powerful one. But within the context of the\nNazis, he was a puppet. He was nothing. He did their doing. And if he didn't, he was the one\nthat was punished. So, it's hard to know how to judge him. I'm tempted to judge him\nbenevolently. Many people hated him. Many people feared him. He \u2014 of course, you know\nhe was such a powerful man, stories build up. And I remember so well, when we first came\nto the hospital, we were in Niedershonhausen, student \u2014 we were 17, 18 years old. And again\nI have to caution you to realize what that meant back in the 30s and in Berlin we were so, so\nsimple, so naive. And then when we were transferred to the big hospital, the rumor went that,\n\"Dr. Lustig will inspect all the student nurses completely naked. And only the ones that he\nlikes naked he would take in.\" Of course it was a stupid rumor, and it did not occur at all, but\nthat was his, his aura. That was his reputation. He was all powerful. He could demand\nanything he wanted and we had to do it. But 1t wasn't so. He was just a very nice man. He\nwas very powerful, yes, but also quite nice.",
        "A: No, I never did. No, I never did. But the nurses that \u2014 he had many girlfriends among the\nnurses. And the general rule was to try to be very friendly with his girlfriends And I never\nmanaged that. And I always felt very ostracized and very badly. We lived in the nursing\nhome and we nurses, of course, chummed together. And you have to realize I am still\nfriendly with some of these people. My best friend \u2014 my best girlfriend whom I liked so\nmuch then, and whom I still like so much now. We're both in our 70s, but we're still like kids\ntogether \u2014 and again, an example of how naive we were. She and I roomed together in\nNiedershonhausen, and we were working hard. We had seven to seven shifts \u2014 seven in the\nmorning to seven at night, or vice versa. And then after the shift we had to do our theoretical\nwork, and we were tired. So we went into bed with each other, studied for a while, and then\nfell asleep just to save time. And we still chuckle over that, you know. We tell it to our\nhusbands. And in the morning, we were woken up by the night nurses because we didn't\nwake up by ourselves at all \u2014 forget 1t \u2014 and they found us in bed together. Well, we were\ncalled before the, the Leiter\u201d \u2014 I think back to German, to the German things \u2014 I sometimes\n*> The Jew Lustig, here. (German)\n*\u201d The Jew Lustig, here. (German)\n* Director (German)\nmiss my English \u2014 to the administrator of the Niedershonhausen Institution, and he scolded\nus, you know. But we didn't know why. We didn't know what we had done wrong. He\nthought we were fooling around together. That was the furthest thing from our minds. This\njust to show you how very naive we were. So here was that rumor we had to be undressed\nand we were fearful like anything, but it didn't happen. So then the next thing was we had to\nbe friendly with the girlfriends of Lustig. And somehow she managed it and I didn't. And\nthen we got together in the evening in our nursing dormitories and she would tell me\neverything \u2014 whatever was going on. They joked and they made friends and they laughed\nand they talked about the patients and the doctors. And I felt terrible. I never was included.\nAnd now I'm not so sorry anymore because this particular Head Nurse was not a very fine\nperson. She then fraternized with the SS, and I'm not a bit sorry that I was not one of her\nfriends. The SS man at the Jewish hospital was Dobberke(ph) \u2014 SS man Dobberke, and he\nwas feared. He walked around and he would send us into transport on his own without going\nthrough Lustig. If the star wasn't sewed on nicely, or if he could smell cigarettes on our\nbreath, or if we didn't stand up and greet him properly, or for any old reason, he would take\nus into transport. And I heard later on, after I left, that this particular Head Nurse from the \u2014\nfrom the Kinderstation*' \u2014 her nurse's name was Elly(ph), Schwester Elly, she then became\nhis girlfriend. And that was not something that sits easily with any of us. That was very bad.",
        "A: They were his girlfriends. They slept with him.",
        "A: Yes. That was known knowledge. We didn't think much of that. We just stayed away. I mean\nwe who were still so rural and especially we who were religious, you know, we just stayed\naway, you know. We had nothing to do with it.",
        "A: Golly \u2014 my friend Golly. I'm still very friendly with her. She then \u2014 you ought to get her and\nget her story sometime.",
        "A: She was just a very \u2014 She was a Mischlinge, first of all. She was a very outgoing, lovely,\nvery much liked person. And she was just a very sweet person. She and I liked each other\n*! Children\u2019s ward (German)\n* Nurse (German)\nvery much. We were very opposite from each other. She was so blond and outgoing, and I\nwas much more heavy and the worrying type. And we just needed each other. We were just\nvery friendly. She didn't put much stock into her acceptance into that inner circle at all. She\nwas a very wonderful girl and she \u2014 they liked her a lot, so they took her in.",
        "A: I wasn't so much aware of that. I don't know. Later on, after I left, I heard that he was there\nevery day \u2014 that he actually lived somewheres there in one of the buildings \u2014 that same\nDobberke. But while I was there, the thing I remember most, we had constant visits from the\nSS I remember Eichmann\u201d coming through many times \u2014 young, beautiful, smoking his\ncigarette, sleeked through like, like sleeked up with tongues almost \u2014 not a speck on him \u2014\nand very arrogant. And we had to stand up and leave whatever we were doing and stand\nwhile he was in the room. And then he left again \u2014 just harassing us and doing what he\nthought was wonderful, was great, harassing the Jews.",
        "A: We knew that. We knew that. We met him again then \u2014 he, he \u2014 you see he, which I didn't\nknow then, he was in charge of the whole Amt\u201d 4B, the whole Jewish section \u2014 he and\nMurse(ph), but that, you know, we didn't know that. But we just knew that he was constantly\non our necks. That was his job. By then I believe the Jewish Community was already\ndissolved and so he had only us to play around with, and he did that job very nicely.",
        "A: Ya. We had 12 hour duties. Then I was already a full nurse. I graduated. And then I was an\nemployee of the hospital. In October, 1941 I got my diploma and it says on it, \u201cJudische\nSauglings und Kleinkinder Schwester.\u201d\u00b0\" Now I have to switch into English, \"Permitted to\nwork only with Jewish children and babies,\" you see. That was the restriction. I could not go\nout anywheres and get a job. It was just for the Jews. I still have that as a matter of fact. And\nthen I was an employee. I drew a salary and I worked on the Kinderstation \u2014 on the baby \u2014\non the children's station, not on the baby station.\n* Adolf Eichmann\n\u201c Bureau (German)\n* Jewish Infants and Toddlers Nurse (German)",
        "A: In the hospital. And then we also had duties for a few Jewish, like daycare centers that were\naround the city, and we got a special permit to go to these centers as nurses and take care of\nthe children, but they were resolved very soon afterwards. But that was part of our nursing\nduty.",
        "A: As much as I remember. We got up in the morning and went to the Speisesaal.\u201d\u00b0 We had a\ndormitory kind of a living where we lived and we called it der Reitsall*\u2019 \u2014 the horses station,\nit was so big you know. And Golly and I roomed close together, and we had to put our\nuniforms on, sew on the yellow star very quickly and neatly \u2014 it didn't leave any holes in it.",
        "A: Whenever we changed the uniform. We got two stars that we had to buy from the Jewish\nCommunity for zehn Pfennigs,\u201d* for 10 pennies, and we better take care of them. If we didn't\nhave them, forget it, we were shot. And then we went to have breakfast, and then we started\nto work \u2014 whatever our duties use to be. The children were in long rows of beds and we were\nassigned to maybe six children that were ours that we had to take care of the whole day long.\nAnd then the doctors would come in and we had to report on the kids. It wasn't so\nsophisticated. Don't think we knew all that much. And then at noontime we had, I don't recall\n\u2014 I guess we went back to the Speisesaal for lunch, and then the inner circle always went into\nSchwester Elly's little room and smoked cigarettes with the doors closed. And then in the\nevening we went and had supper again. And we couldn't go out. There was a curfew. We had\nto be there at eight \u2014 back at eight. So everything that we did, we did within the hospital.\nAnd the hospital was a complex \u2014 a whole compound. So we did get out for fresh air just by\nwalking across the halls, across the \u2014 to the different buildings. And of course there were\nlittle romances with the young physicians. Everything was so \u2014 it was so enclosed. It was so\nunnatural you see. It was \u2014 everything was so confined. So naturally romances sprung up and\ndied down again, and many people left on transports, and once they were here one day and\nthe next day they were gone. We somehow got use to that.",
        "A: I was friendly with one of the physicians. I wouldn't say he was a boyfriend, but I was\nfriendly with one of the physicians. Golly was very friendly with one of the physicians. And\none of the other nurses was very much involved with one of the housekeep\u2014 one of the male\n*\u00b0 Dinning hall (German)\n*\u2019 The riding stable (German)\n*\u00b0 Ten pfennigs (German)\nhousekeepers \u2014 and finally married. There were marriages. There were marriages there. So in\na way, as unnatural as it sounded, it was still a fairly normal existence. Well, I'm gonna take\nthat back. It wasn't normal with people disappearing every day to go on transports. And then\nmany people made secret plans to go underground. That was a big deal. And many people\nmade secret plans to go across the border into Switzerland, and many were caught. And then\nalso I'm going to take back what I said \u2014 that it was a normal life \u2014 because it wasn't.\nBecause the patients we got, most of them were suicides that we had to get back to life in\norder so we could ship them to the collection center to be going to transports. And you know\nwe sat and agonized over that. Is it really our duty to bring those people back to life? But,\nyes it was, or we were punished ourselves. The SS were always there to supervise us and do\nthis. It was a very unnatural time, and always the fear that we would be the next ones to have\nthe transport notice, and it was just a very bad time.",
        "A: No. I didn't.",
        "A: But the physician that I was friendly with was somebody in charge of that, and he always\ntold about it. And you know it was always food for conversation. What are we gonna talk\nabout, you know, and so what could we possibly talk about? We couldn't go to a movie. We\ndidn't know nothing of concerts, or any of the culture that normal people grow up with. We\ncouldn't go shopping. We didn't have any new clothes to show off. What are we going to talk\nabout? Transports and going underground, and we had no family left. We couldn't talk about\nfamily anymore, so we talked about that all the time. It was like ruminating \u2014 the same thing\nall the time. It was a very unnatural life actually.",
        "A: Those were children from the Jewish Community that were sick. And, little by little, that\nchanged, and little by little it was Mischlinge that came in \u2014 children of mixed marriages.\nAnd then by \u201843 I left. And little by little the whole complex of the nurses, and the whole\ncomplexion of the staff changed too. We were replaced by Mischlinge \u2014 by people who were\nfrom mixed marriages with whom they didn't know what to do with. They couldn't put them\non the lists yet. They did later. In fact, this nice Dr. Elkan(ph) that I was friendly with\ndumped me for a Mischlinge. I never forgot and forgave him. It was just as well. It was just\nas well. There was no time to form emotional bondages. And in fact I\u2014 she came to this\ncountry, too. I corresponded with her for a while. You formed such weird friendships \u2014 such\nweird relationships \u2014 and they lasted. They really lasted. I was very friendly with, with \u2014 not\nthe Head Nurse, but the one that came under her. I don't know what you would call her \u2014\nmaybe the Assistant Head Nurse \u2014 Schwester Lea(ph). And we picked each other up again\nhere in this country. We had really nothing in common otherwise, but that huge balloon of\nmemories. We could talk with each other and it was like in the comic strips, you know, over\nour heads was the same picture. You see? Was so weird. And then Golly would come in and\nover her head was the same picture, and we would talk about that. Does that give you some\nidea what it was like?",
        "A: It was very intense. When finally, when I got my notice, I was glad. It was like, \"finally.\"\nAnd then an SS man came, and I was on his list, and he came to the station where I was\nworking. It was in the middle of the day, when he told me that I was on his list. And he took\nme to my room in the dormitory, and everybody had their, their rucksack packed. My\nrucksack was packed, and he gave me just a few minutes. He timed me. And then I had to go\ninto that van that was downstairs. And it was like, \u201cfinally,\u201d you know \u2014 \u201cfinally I can go.\u201d\n\u2018Cause I knew I would be going. I knew I wasn't going to go underground. I had no chance,\nand I wasn't going to do that anyway. And I couldn't get into Switzerland over the border. I\nwas completely alone. Everybody had left already. Father was in America. Mother was in\nRiga \u2014 or so I thought. My sister in Auschwitz \u2014 or so I thought. And I thought I was coming\nto Auschwitz as well. There was no idea I was going to Theresienstadt. Everybody was\ngoing to Auschwitz \u2014 to Arbeitstransport or Osttransport. It wasn't called killing transport by\nany means. And so I thought I would see them all again. So I was very relieved. And I went\ninto that transport without a minute looking back.",
        "A: Are you talking about when we were called to the Jewish Community Center?",
        "A: Oh, that was difficult. And then Lustig was also very much involved. All these Befehle,\u201d\u2019 all\nthese SS orders to do things came through Lustig. The SS never spoke to anyone else, you\nsee. He was their man. So Lustig let it be known throughout the hospital \u2014 that was in\nOctober of \u201842, that \u2014 up to then it was sort of, you know, it was sort of dispersed. But now,\nall of sudden, it got general. It got bunched up together \u2014 that we were all going to be\nWo oe\nOrder (German)\nappearing the next morning at seven o'clock in full uniforms at the Jewish Community\nCenter on Oranien Strasse . And that was a big room. We got there of course. There was no\nway we would not go there. It didn't occur to us not to go. That's another thing. We were so\nconditioned to obey. If I look at those kids nowadays, they refuse to obey their mothers, or\ntheir teachers, or their governors, or their President... It was the furthest thing from our minds\nnot to obey an order, you see. And when I speak to students, I always encourage them to\ncontinue doing that. So we obeyed. We went in our uniform with our star, seven o'clock in\nthe morning, the whole bunch of us, and it was a big room, and we just stood there. We\ndidn't know why. We had no idea why we were called. Lustig didn't tell us and nobody else\nknew. And we stood and we stood, and it was, we couldn't go to the toilet, we couldn't get\nany coffee, and I'm quickly reaching for my nice cup of tea so it won't be taken away from\nme. We were desperate. At 12 o'clock, three SS men showed up. We knew Eichmann. He\nwas very familiar to us. We also knew Giinther.\u201d\u2019 He was also familiar. There were two SS\nGunthers \u2014 one from Berlin and one from Prague. This was Gunther from Berlin. And then\nthere were three Jews from Vienna. And then there was an SS man whom we didn't know.\nAnd of course we couldn't whisper among each other, \"Who was that? What's going on?\"\nThat was completely out. And at first they didn't talk to us at all. They just stood there in\nfront of us and smoked and laughed and joked. Very young, our age. I was 20 at that point.\nAnd then they called before them the heads of each of the Jewish departments \u2014 of each\ndepartment, including Lustig who was head of the hospital.\nAnd then, then first of all, that guy introduced himself. He was Brunner \u2014 Anton Brunner\u201d!\nfrom Vienna. And he had come from Vienna with those three Jews. Then he told us why he\nwas there, and in his own Viennese dialect, which is still ringing in my ears he said, and of\ncourse I'll say it in English, that he came to show the SS in Berlin how to deal with the Jews\n\u2014 how they had dealt with the Jews in Vienna. And that's why he came and brought the three\nJews with him. How to deal with the Jews? We thought they had been doing fine up to now.\nBut his innovation was \u2014 his fork in the road \u2014 was that from now on the Jews had to do the\ndirty work. And he demonstrated it right away. He told the leaders of each department to\npick their own, to pick their own \u2014 30 percent of each department to go into transport. He\nwasn't gonna bother picking anymore. He had each of the Jews pick their own Jews. And\nthat didn't sink in right away, but after it sank in it was really ein Wendepunkt\u201d \u2014 a turning\npoint \u2014 a pivotal point in the history of the Holocaust. From then on it was Jews stuffing\nJews into the, into the cattle cars. It was Jews taking the Jews out of the cattle cars, too, and\ndoing all the, all the agents of their own destruction they were from then on. And under that\nfalls the Kapos\u201d\u201d and the Jewish elders, and even we, we got white armbands. We had to go\n\u201d Rolf Giinther\n*' Alois (Anton) Brunner\n** Turning point, milestone (German)\n*\u00b0 Formen (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor\nsquadron of prisoners.\naround helping them and we had to do our own. That was very diabolic.",
        "A: Well we were sent home. Somehow I wasn't picked to go into transport so I was sent back to\nthe hospital, and a few weeks later we were sent again. We were sent three times. Yes, and\nthen the second time \u2014 the first time he took hostages. Brunner took hostages. The first time\nhe still let the people go home. The people had to pick their own people to go into transport\nand he allowed them to go home \u2014 to pack and to say \u201cgoodbye.\u201d But he kept 20 of the high\nofficials of the Jewish Community hostages. And he said that if not everybody would show\nup, those 20 people would be killed. At the time I still remembered their names and I think I\nwrote it into my, into my notes. I could look it up. But it\u2019s not important at the moment. And\nsome actually did either kill themselves \u2014 some of the people who were supposed to go to\ntransport either killed themselves or went underground, or just ran away. And he actually did\nkill those 20 people. He sent the ashes to their families. So we knew he meant business. And\nthat was the same thing later in Theresienstadt. If something went wrong \u2014 20, 200, 2,000 \u2014\nwere killed for one person. So that's the reason why I didn't \u2014 why we didn't think of, of\nobjecting, of doing anything against them. We couldn't be responsible for the death of our\nown people. But anyway, so then we were sent back, and the second time we were sent back,\nhe called the head of the Jewish Community before him \u2014 that was Dr. Kraindl \u2014 and Kraindl\nwas struck by a heart attack in front of these SS people and fell dead. And he said, \"Move\nhim. Go away. Take away that dead person. Just another dead Jew.\" And then the third time\nwe were told to go the Kasernen\u201d\u2019 \u2014 to the barracks to help with the transportation of the\nJews.\nNow that was in February of \u201843 during the big Fabrikaktion.\u201d\u00b0 The Fabrikaktion was that\nthey went into the \u2014 into those factories and took out the people who were working there\nwho thought they were protected \u2014 who had been promised protection because they worked\nfor the \u2014 for the military units. And they came by the thousands. They came in huge furniture\nvans stuffed with Jews, just they way they were from the factories \u2014 in their aprons \u2014 with\ntheir clothes \u2014 and always with the star of course. And we had to take care of them. We had...\nOne of my friends, her name was Klara, I remember it. We were assigned to the Rathenower\nKaserne in Berlin. I had never been there. We had to go there by special permit to use the\npublic transportation. And there was this huge barrack, and the Jews were not allowed to use\nthe toilets. That was the first thing. No food of course \u2014 no toilets \u2014 nothing. So then some\nJewish people came who dug a ditch in the backyard. That was the toilet. And then finally\nsome coffee came. But in between that we already had some thousands of Jews who were\n~* Barracks (German)\n\u00bb\u00b0 Factory action (German); factory round-up.\nbeside themselves \u2014 direct from the factory \u2014 without their mothers or fathers or children or\nhusbands, or anybody. That was really pandemonium in that \u2014 1n those barracks. Then I\nremember we had to go out and take in all these people that came by the hundreds. And I\nremember one van opened up and blood stained people fell out. They had resisted and the SS\nshot them. Big deal, you know. And we weren't allowed to do anything to them \u2014 we just...\nWe had no material anyway. So they were then shipped off too, the way they were \u2014\nbleeding. And then we were... We worked there for two days straight \u2014 for three days\nstraight, and then finally we were released from duty and some other nurses came with their\nwhite armbands and we got back. And then we went again the next three days. It was three\nday shifts. And then finally that Fabrikaktion was over \u2018cause there were no more Jews to\ntake. That was in February, \u201843, and then a few weeks later I was finally taken too. I had\nenough by then. Now you can understand why I say it was a relief.",
        "A: What did I mean by that? Well ordinarily they should have done that themselves. Why\nshould we \u2014 we Jews \u2014 do this? That was terrible. That was the worst of the whole thing.",
        "A: We had to take care of them. We had to put them onto straw mattresses. We had to get the\nstraw and put it around, and assign places to them. They didn't know what was happening.\nNeither did we for that matter, but at least we were told to make some order in this huge\nbarracks. This was like a, like a military barrack. It was a military barrack. And we were in\nthe big, big room, and we had to bring them in from the vans, and take them to a place, and\nsay, \"Now this is your place. You stay here until we come back to you and tell you what to\ndo.\" They had nothing with them. They came directly from work. And we didn't know very\nmuch either, so we did the best we could. We had no food to give them for a long while.\nWhat happened was they, they begged us to see that their children would be taken care of, or\ntheir old mothers would be taken care of. But how could we do that? We couldn't leave the\nbarracks either. So they scribbled on little notepads where to go to. But if the SS saw that\nthey would shoot right away. So we quickly stuck them into our pockets, and afterwards we\ndrove around and tried to help as much as we could. It was nothing that you can normally\nforesee. This \u2014 these Fabrikaktion involved 20,000 people that were shipped out of Berlin\nduring those three days.",
        "A: Yes. That was his job.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Inside the hospital.",
        "A: That any day we could be called up. That any day we would be on the list. He got us on a\ncertain quota, which we didn't know at the time. We didn't realize that at all. We knew\nsomehow he was involved with the SS, but just how, how the connections worked, we didn't\nknow. After we had heard Brunner say that the Jews had to pick their own Jews, then we\nknew. Then it was no longer so secretive. He got his orders to choose, let's say, 500 Jews for\ntomorrow morning at eight o'clock. The trucks would come and 500 Jews had to be ready.\nSo he just had to pick somebody. They weren't voluntarily going. So he probably had a quota\nof so many patients, and so many physicians, and so many nurses, and so many help \u2014\nhelpers.",
        "A: No, I didn't. I didn't. As a matter of fact, yes. When I went into the Theresienstadt transport,\nthen a lot of the kids from the children's station also went, and I simply was put in charge of\nthose kids. But at that point we didn't know it was a Theresienstadt transport. We only\nrealized that when we got to the Gerlach Strasse instead of to the Oranienburger Strasse. See\nwe knew we had to help in those places a number of times. I never did, but some of the other\nnur\u2014 I was sent to Rathenower Kaserne, but many of my colleagues were sent to those\ncollection centers, and so we knew where the trains were going to from the collection\ncenters, and I ended up at Gerlach Strasse, and I knew that was Theresienstadt. How come?\nHow come? And then I met some of the Jewish Community personnel that I was very\nfriendly with. Their names were Simmon \u2014 Werner and Eva Simmon \u2014 very close friends \u2014\nand they were there too. The first emotion was one of happiness. \"Oh, thank God I know\nsomebody. I'm not in a sea of unknown people.\" But of course the next emotion was, \u201cWhere\nare we going?\u201d And Werner Simmon who was an employee of the hospital \u2014 of the Jewish\nCommunity Center, said, \"We're going to Theresienstadt. We're lucky\" I didn't even ask how\ncome. Who cares?",
        "A: I'm sorry?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: I became friendly with Werner and Eva Simmon because I delivered her baby. And I just\nwas very, very friendly with them. I walked through their house many times skirting all the\ngreenery, and when I saw them there, what a relief.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. I would say in the thousands. It was a large, huge hospital \u2014 very many departments \u2014\nvery huge building for the dormitories for the nurses, and another huge building where the\ndoctors had their little apartments. And then there was Pathologie.\u201d\u00b0 That was a whole\nsection in itself \u2014 a whole building \u2014 which was later, actually after I left I was told \u2014 that\nwas later one of the collection centers too. And then there was like a house for the SS where\nD\u00e9bberke lived, and a whole house for Wirtschaft, \u201d\u2019 you know, where they cleaned and\nwhere the steam was generated, and where the laundry building was \u2014 really huge buildings.",
        "A: No. That wasn't there. That was on Oranienburger Strasse. That was also a huge complex.\nThat was under Rabbiner Baeck \u2014 Leo Baeck. No, not always. That was first under \u2014 I think\nit was under Kotzover.\u201d* I'm not sure. I wasn't that familiar with the Jewish Community. But\nwe always knew of and about Rabbiner Baeck, who was also a controversial figure. How\nmuch did he help the Nazis? How much did he know? How, if at all, did he protect the Jews?\nThose are questions that still bother me a great deal. Did they know, and if they knew what\ncould they have done? What would they have done? They couldn't all like, like\nCzerniakow\u201d\u2019 in Warsaw, kill themselves to end this all. And he only did it because his wife\n\u00b0\u00b0 Pathology (German)\n>\u2019 Trade and industry (German)\n8 Philip Kotzover\n\u00bb\u00b0 Adam Czerniakow\nwas taken hostage. It wasn't simple. It was not a white and black situation. It wasn't a simple\nsituation. These people had to do the Nazis' bidding. They had no way out in many cases.\nTheir own families were taken hostages. And in many cases they thought they were helping\nthe Jews. In many cases they thought they would deal much more kindly with the Jews than\nthe Nazis would, and they could ease our suffering in some ways. But those are all questions\nthat I want to research now and see if I can find any answers. But really there was no way\nout. There was just no way out.",
        "A: You know we heard the word \u201cvergasung.\u201d\u201d\u201d I remember that so clearly. I almost remember\nthe place where I sat and the person who told it to me. \"Die werden alle vergast,\u201d\"\" said\nsomeone to me. You know it went in one ear and out the other. What is Vergasung?\u201d\u201d How\ndo you picture human beings being vergast?\u201d\u201d Didn't mean a thing.",
        "A: That's a big question. That's a very big question. That's the very, very big question. If people\nasked him what to do he told them to go. Should he have? Should he not have? I don't know\nthe answer. I don't know the answer. We ourselves could have refused to help in those\nKaserne. Maybe we did the wrong thing too. It didn't occur to us not to obey.",
        "A: Nobody refused to help. It didn't occur to us. We were so conditioned to obey, and I think... I\nalmost think that's how Hitler got so powerful, because the Germans too were so conditioned\nto obey. They always obeyed one voice \u2014 the Kaiser for years, for centuries, for thousands of\nyears. They were always told what to do, so Hitler came and he told them what to do, so they\nobeyed. And we were no different. We were, we were Germans too. We were also\nconditioned to obey.",
        "A: Yes, very typical \u2014 very, very typical. It was not a democracy. And Jewishly it was also very\ntypical. You always obeyed. You always... And historically it was typical. The Jews were\nOn\nGassing (German)\n| They will all be gassed. (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Gassing (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Gassed (German)\npersecuted before, but by laying low and by obeying \u2014 sure some were killed and some were\nstrung up and burned and mutilated, but the Jewish Community kept them going. It wasn't\nthe whole thing, but they were always conditioned to obey. And so you paid a little money,\nand you, you did something to let the cloud go over, and it always did. This was the first time\nit didn't work. We didn't know how to object \u2014 not as Germans and not as Jews, truly. And I\nreally think that was part of the problem. And if people ask me if it can happen here I say,\n\"No.\" The people here are conditioned to question, and conditioned to \u2014 they have an inborn\ncommon sense and they're always conditioned by hundreds of years of democracy to stand\nup for what they think is right. And I really don't think it could happen here. But it sure was\nhappening there.",
        "A: We went on the same transport, even though she was a Mischlinge. She volunteered. She\nwas friendly with one of the doctors and she followed him. She married him in\nTheresienstadt. She's wonderful \u2014 very unusual person. She volunteered. She didn't have to\ngO.",
        "A: I loved her before and I loved her afterwards. She was just a very wonderful person. And\nthen we went together, but then she \u2014 before she married him we roomed together, too. And\nthen she married that guy and she went. In Theresienstadt you could live with your husband\nsomehow if you managed it well. And then I picked up a new friend, very soon. I picked up\nEva, as you know from my book. I was always very lucky with friends.",
        "A: We did, but there wasn't much to take care of. We had nothing to do \u2014 to give them. We had\nno food to give them. We had no medical equipment. We were not transported on a\u2014 ina\ncattle car. We were actually in a regular car \u2014 in a regular train with seats and all. So we just\nmade sure that the kids all sat quietly and didn't cry. There was very little to do. And when\nwe got to Theresienstadt, I still walked with them into the Ghetto, but then they were picked\nup and taken to the Children's Home and we were separated into \u2014 to the barracks there.",
        "A: I don't recall that. I actually had so little to do with them. Perhaps 30 \u2014 I'm gonna say 30 kids.",
        "A: Yes, those were the patients.",
        "A: We only knew them as patients. It could well be that in many cases the people went\nunderground. Many people left their children. Many people went underground and hoped\ntheir kids would get by as orphans of Germans, you see. Then they could be picked up into\nGerman \u2014 into the German sector and could be saved. And it may have been some of that.\nAnd then I don't remember much about that.",
        "A: No, I felt good about the journey. Remember, I was still thinking I would see my mother and\nmy sister, and everybody. I had so many uncles and aunts, and.... My grandmother had died\nand my Aunt Adelheid had died, so \u2014 in Germany still. They were buried in Germany. But\nuncles and aunts, and all the friends that had gone before. And also remember, I was with\nEva and Werner and their child. It may not sound like much, but you sucked out every little\nbit of enjoyment, you know. That was enjoyment. Enjoyment was measured in decimals \u2014\nnot in going to the Opera. No, this was fun. I was going to be together with Eva and Werner\nfor a few hours \u2014 a few days. And I don't remember too much otherwise about the journey,\njust that we got there and we had to walk then from Bauschewitz to Theresienstadt. And then\nthe children were already taken care of. Somebody took the whole group of children, and we\nwere on our own. Then we turned and helped the older people. Don't forget there were also\nold patients out of the hospital, and people who couldn't walk. And then Eva and I helped the\nolder people. And she had her little boy with her anyway who was \u2014 see he was born in \u201841.\nHe was two years old. He was a little kid. And then I remember getting into Theresienstadt,\nand it looked all very, very foreign \u2014 very different. It was a fortress. It was a, it was a\nmedieval fortress \u2014 an enclosure with a moat, and you had go over a bridge to get in, and you\ndidn't see very much because there were these high walls. All I could see was the church\nsteeple. And around, there was this huge walls. And once we were inside we could tell that\nalong the walls, all around the ghetto in an octagon, were these barracks \u2014 these huge stone\nbuildings, two stories high \u2014 and they were again closed up toward the street, you see. You\nhad to go into the barracks just like you had to go into Theresienstadt to see what was inside.\nYou had to again go into the barracks, and then you ended up like in a huge courtyard, and\naround you again was barracks. Can you follow this? And you could \u2014 perhaps I can, I can\ncompare it to a monastery where you can walk all around and you still, you're still inside.\nYou're still \u2014 always facing that huge exercise grounds. It was a military barracks where the\npeople had to do their military exercises, you see, and you could almost watch that from\nevery point. And we were sent into the upstairs rooms, and we were laid on straws. That was\nall we had. And that was our Ubikation\u2122 it was called \u2014 unsere Wohnung\u201d \u2014 our residence\n\u201c Rooming space (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Our domicile (German)\nfor the moment.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: They mostly gave us their addresses \u201ccause they had kids at home, or old parents at home.\nThey were taken without any notice and they were panicked. They didn't know what their\nkids were doing. So we took those notes, and after we were through, we couldn't follow up\nall of them. There were thousands of people. But the few that we did, we took the children\nwith us to the children's station at the hospital, \u2018cause they were totally alone. In some cases,\nthey were, you know, little youngsters \u2014 three, four, five, six years old \u2014 and we took them\nwith us. And those were then the children that went on to the next transport. They were free\ngame. It was terrible.",
        "A: These were the transport\u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, the helpers that were suppose to help us. And he told us a little about Theresienstadt.\nWhat did we know about Theresienstadt? Not a thing. We only knew the name. And he told\nus a little bit about the history and what to expect. Like, for instance, he told us about the\nSchleusse.\u201d\u201d What on earth was the Schleusse? Nobody ever \u2014 you see, there was a whole\nnew vocabulary that grew up as I have mentioned before, and Schleusse was one of the\nwords that we never heard of. It was where they took everything away from us. What does\nSchleusse mean literally? It means a control point where you had to go through, like a toll\npoint where you were told in which barrack you were going to live. You were given your\nnumber. Everybody had a number, and if somebody asks us.... You see, any of the SS that\nsaw us in the camp could at any time ask us to identify ourselves. He didn't want to know our\nname. He didn't want to know I was Gerda Schild. He wanted to know my ghetto number.\nWhat was it? \u201cQ\u201d \u2014 I have it somewheres \u2014 \u201cQ 1,000\u201d or 11, 12 something. That's what we\nhad to memorize. And that was given to us in the Schleusse, and at the same time we were\n66 ay:\nSluice (German)\nrelived of most of our possessions.",
        "A: No. We didn't wear that number. We just had to know it at all times. It was on a little slip of\npaper that we kept.",
        "A: Pavel, Paul \u2014 Pavel. I lost him after that. He was just one of the Czech youngsters who came\nand talked with me. Of course they were all very glad to have \u2014 to get out of the ghetto and\nhave someone to talk to.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well contraband \u2014 another new expression \u2014 was for us anything they didn't allow for Jews\nto possess \u2014 lipstick, money, cigarettes, chocolate, even female napkins \u2014 anything like that\nwas called contraband. As a matter of fact, anything that belonged to a Jew was not allowed\nto belong to him, so most everything was contraband.",
        "A: No. No, no. He was a nice honest guy \u2014 just a nice guy, he was really helping me. No, the\nJews were alright. We didn't have any problems with the Jews.",
        "A: No, I was not. No, thank God, I was never hit or beaten or molested in any way. We always\nexpected it and we were always on guard, but I was lucky.",
        "A: Well, the walk from Bauschewitz to Theresienstadt was maybe a good half hour, so he hung\naround me. He was probably a little attracted to me. I was still young. I was nice looking. I\nwas not starving or I was not skeletal or anything. And I wouldn't be surprised that he was\nhoping to see me again later, but 1t was not the case. It was very casual. And then it took\nseveral hours. Then we had to sit on our knapsacks for a while in the barrack grounds until\nthat whole transport was absorbed and registered in and that took awhile. And then toward\nevening we got into the barracks. But somehow I don't think I ever saw him again\nafterwards. There was thousands of people, how could I?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: No. We kept our own clothes. They took away a lot, but we could keep some.",
        "A: The barracks were military barracks, huge rooms, straw for each person. That's how\neverybody first was checked in. And then we had to go into Hundertschaft.\u201d\u201d Literally\ntranslated that means detail of a hundred. And it was always a hundred people that worked at\na certain task. I was in the Hundertschaft of cleaning \u2014 sweeping the streets at first. You\ndidn't get there to relax or anything. You were checked 1n, get into your straw, put your\nthings down and off to work, you see. And so I swept the streets for a long time \u2014 not for too\nlong. Then it occurred to me, and you know somebody told me all this. You weren't wise,\nghetto wise right of quick. So somebody told me, \"Why don't you try to get into the health\nsystem and become a nurse again.\" And of course that sounded like a super idea. And I\napplied to the Jewish self-government. The ghetto was completely self-governed, but again,\njust like in Lustig's case, they were complete puppets of the SS And so I applied to get into\nthe nursing phase of the ghetto, and I was lucky. I still have my, my little notice that I could\nbe a nurse and wear a nurse's uniform. That was wonderful. And with that came a little better\nfood also.",
        "A: And then, yes, we were \u2014 then I could move out of those barracks. That was already a huge\nimprovement. I was so sick of those barracks, with all these women, and there was a hostile\nfeeling there because everybody was so \u2014 was so humiliated, and was so sad, and there was\nno spirit there at all. So I was already very happy to get out of that situation. And then I was\ndetailed to the, to the home for children on Bergstrasse. And in that basement we, the nurses,\ncould make a little nest for ourselves. The basement rooms themselves were, of course, you\nknow very, very poor, very stark. And we had a couple of these bunkbeds \u2014 not a couple,\ntwo on each lining the wall. There were many people. And I, by sheer luck, ended up sharing\nmy bunk with a nurse from Vienna \u2014 Eva, Eva Atlas. And apparently I attract light hearted\n\u00b0\u2019 Group of 100 (German)\npeople because I, myself, I'm on the serious side. So Eva was a very lighthearted, nice,\nround-faced nurse from Vienna, and we liked each other right away. And somehow\neverything is easier to bear when you have a friend. I think a lot of us who survived,\nsurvived because we had a good friend to share things with. At first, when things were very\nhard, Eva and I made sure that we always had a little bread. If she was out of bread, I shared\nmine with her. If I didn't have any more to eat, naturally it was the other way around. So that\nalready helped. And then as our rations \u2014 as we worked harder and harder, the rations\nbecame better and better. We had what was called S-Rationen.\u00b0* And at the moment I don't\nremember what the \u201cS\u201d stood for. Maybe for \u201csneziell\u201d\u201d \u2014 \u201cspecial rations\u201d or something.\nBut it meant a little more bread and a little more soup, and extra coffee. And then things\nwere not so bad anymore. And then we both had friends and admirers. And I had Jirca who\nworked in the bakery, and he made tiny little Gs for my first name in bread then, \u2018cause I\nshared that with Eva too. And then things got much better. And, again, we were in a terrible\nsituation. We were completely alone \u2014 Eva as well as myself. We had no hope for a future.\nWe were so worried about daily calls to the Auschwitz transports. That was the big, big\nSword of Damocles that was always hanging over. And yet we were young. We were 20, 21\nyears old. We weren't too badly off. We had a bed to sleep in. We had some food. We had\nsome admirers. What more do you want at 21? So we kind of sailed along, and we did our\nwork. I went a lot, by the way, to that, to that old age home that was right across the street\nfrom the nurse's \u2014 from the children's home. Because I had discovered that Frau Frankel,\nwith whom my mother shared an \u2014 who took my mother tn, in Munich \u2014 and I was able to\nhelp her out in turn a little bit with my little \u201cG-rations\u201d of bread. And that was good, that\nwas good. And I met other old people there. The old people were hopeless. They had nothing\nto live for. And they didn't work, so they had very poor rations. So Eva and I did what we\ncould over there after work.",
        "A: At first everybody had to go into the barracks and lie on the floor on straw. And then the old\npeople went into the old aged home which was miserable, miserable. The barracks were\nbetter than that. Dark and dirty and just hopeless, smelly. And that was a terrible situation.\nAnd the young people were taken to appropriate works. You see the ghetto was completely\norganized and taken care of by Jews. There was ghetto Jewish police and Jewish firemen,\nand we took care of the kids, and, of course, Jewish nurses and doctors, and Jewish street-\nsweepers and the whole works. And the Judeniiltester\u2019? \u2014 Eppstein! and Edelstein\u201d and\n\u00b0* S-Rations (German)\n\u00b0\u00b0 Special (German)\n\u201d Jewish elder (German); term used for Nazi appointed Jewish community leaders.\n\"' Paul Eppstein\n\u201d Jakob Edelstein\nMurmelstein\u201d \u2014 three stones. Does that explain it to you?",
        "A: Well, all their names ended with \u201cstein,\u201d which is in German a stone. But that was\ncoincidental. We knew Eppstein from Berlin, and it was best during his administration.",
        "A: Edelstein \u2014 I'm sorry. Edelstein from Berlin.",
        "A: Yes. She wasn't worried the way I was. She wasn't constantly ruminating in pessimism. She\nlived for the moment. She had enough bread right now and she had her work, and she had\nme, and we could go out before the curfew. We stopped work at seven and the curfew was at\neight, so we always went out a little bit. And then, I'm sure you're familiar with the history of\nthe ghetto. By 1943 we had to do what was called \u201cGhetto versch\u00e9nerung\u201d\u201d\u201d \u2014 the\nbeautification of the ghetto. So we got involved in that. And why was there all of a sudden\nthis emphasis on having the ghetto beautiful and representative? As you know, there come \u2014\nthe International Commission came that following summer. But before the International\nCommission came, a German pre-commission already came. So the whole ghetto suddenly\nwas buoyed. We were suddenly involved in sowing grass and planting flowers \u2014 and\npainting the houses and sewing curtains to put into only the downstairs where this\ncommission could walk by. So we suddenly, in our little basement room, we had a little\ncurtain. And then there was cultural beautification as well. Suddenly the SS allowed, and not\nonly allowed, but ordered the Jews to sing and dance, so to say, as their little puppets on a\nstring. But we didn't look behind that. We just knew we could sing again, and walk around,\nand look at the flowers \u2014 and that's what we did. And Eva, who had a very nice voice, was\ntaken into the choir, and so she had a pass past the curfew to rehearse in the choir and I\nalways went with her. And so she rehearsed the Elijah another, another phenomenon of\nTheresienstadt. The Elijah is an oratorium which, first of all was written by a Jew \u2014\nMendelssohn\u2019? \u2014 secondly, the context is Jewish. It speaks of that glorification of God, who\nis \u2014 who punishes the wicked, you see \u2014 who doesn't give fire to the sacrifice of the Baalites,\nand he punishes them in the end, and they have to go and disappear \u2014 and elaborates and\nhonors, and rewards the Jews \u2014 Elyah and the Jews. How they ever allowed this in the\nghetto, I will never know, but I didn't ask any questions. I went and heard Eva sing in the\nchoir, and the melodies are still very much with me. So that was Eva. She took what came.\n\u201d Rabbi Benjamin Murmelstein\nStone, rock (German)\n\u201d Embellishment (German)\n\u2019\u00b0 Felix Mendelssohn",
        "A: Yes, we went to rehearsals. And then we also went to when she really sang. It was performed\n\u2014 the rehearsals were before the Commission, and then it was performed during the\nCommission, along with a lot of other things. And we took part in all of it. I saw Tosca, and I\nsaw Carmen. And you must understand that I saw and heard this with the most magnificent\nvoices there was. The Jewish \u2014 the top \u2014 the cream of the Jewish voices had come to\nTheresienstadt. The best of the Jewish musicians \u2014 of directors and conductors and\neverything. And we heard that. Of course it wasn't elaborate. It was in some attic room in\nthat ghetto close. But the voices! I still can't take a mediocre voice because in my youth I\nheard these magnificent sounds, and that stayed with me. And those people, after they were\ndone singing, went behind the (Inaudible) to the transports. That was the bad thing. But we\ndidn't worry about it so much anymore then. We just lived for the moment. We just lived for\nthat evening when we could go and hear that and enter a new world \u2014 a world of sound, and\nmusic, and voices \u2014 the human voice. That was nice. So we enjoyed that. And very soon\nJirca went on transport too, and Eva and I stayed. I don't know why. Miracle, just a miracle.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. They had confiscated a lot of the musical instruments from Prague, and if they\nmissed anything they went to Prague and took it \u2014 the SS And then the Jews were ordered to\nrehearse a certain piece Smetana\u2019s, Bartered Bride. Ah, heaven! And a lot of Smetana\u2019\u2019 and\na lot of Dvorak\u2019* \u2014 The New World Symphony. They were sitting on a stage, on a podium, in\nthe middle of the square, in the middle of the ghetto, in the middle of Nazi Germany. It was\nabsurd. It was bizarre. And if we had thought about it, we would have gone mad. But we\ndidn't think about it. We just walked by, arm-in-arm, and listened to that heavenly music.\nNot even knowing that after the concert these people would all be shipped out \u2014 or after the\nCommission left. Even before the Commission left, because the ghetto was overcrowded \u2014\nhugely overcrowded. The ghetto always remained at 50,000, but it wasn't the same 50,000. It\nwas a constant new transport coming in and thousands and thousands of people being\nshipped out. So we were just lucky. We were never called to go into transport. And during\nthe pre-commission, the ghetto was overcrowded. There were probably 60,000 or 70,000,\nand they couldn't show the Commission an overcrowded ghetto, so they shipped out tens of\nthousands of people before the Commission came. And Jirca was in one of those transports.\n\"\u2019 Bedrich Smetana\n\u2019\u00ae Antonin Dvofak",
        "A: I think so. I think so, because Eva and I went alone to hear all these operas. Yes, I'm quite\nsure he was shipped out before. And then the Commission came, and then after that they\nfilmed all this, and after that there was no more music. Then everybody was transported.",
        "A: It went on a little bit more, but the enthusiasm and the purpose was gone.",
        "A: I'm not sure I was 1n the film, but the film was done. I remember that. I was part of the\ndeception while the Commission was there. I don't remember what Eva did. She may have\nbeen with me. I don't recall that, but I recall that I was detailed behind a hay wagon, and I\nwas told to put a little kerchief around my hair, and I got the rake over my shoulder. And\nbehind that filled up hay wagon, which we'd never seen before, we were walking \u2014 a group\nof us girls were walking and we had to sing. I'm sure Eva was with me, too, because she had\nsuch a nice voice. And we walked by the Commission, out of the ghetto, and in by the next\ngate, and then we were dissolved again \u2018cause the Commission had passed. It was all \u2014 all\njust a show. But we didn't know, and we didn't care. If we had any character, we would have\nrefused to do that. It didn't occur to us.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, some people did refuse, especially the Danes the Danish Jews. They had a lot\nmore spirit than we did. They were very different from us. And also, you see, we already had\nten years of Hitler and most of them didn't. They were still fresh from their King, and from\nthe authority of their King who was standing behind the Jews.",
        "A: Ya. The Danes were different. First of all they, they were treated differently. They lived in\nhouses and they didn't have \u2014 I don't think they had to work. I'm not sure on that now. And I\nhad one Danish girlfriend \u2014 one girl, Danish friend. I don't know how I got her, but somehow\nI was friendly with one of them. And she was very outspoken. And she said that she would\ntell the Commission that this was all just a farce, a comedy, a Potemkin Village. And she\nwas taken into custody during the time of the International Commission. And when she came\nout again, she told us she was together with a lot of other people who were outspoken, and\nwith a lot of people who looked very Jewish. And the explanation was later that they were\ntaken into this custody not by the SS, but by the Jewish ghetto governments because they\nwere afraid of any repercussions. And if anything had gone on the whole ghetto would have\nbeen severely punished.",
        "A: I admired her. I didn't have the guts to do that. It didn't even occur to me to do that. You were\ntold to do something and you did it. It was such a, it was such a different mentality. I don't\neven understand it myself anymore today. But it really didn't occur to any of us to do that. I\nwished I could, I wished I could have a simple, clean explanation for it, but I don't. It was the\nwhole business of \u2014 It all dragged after me \u2014 that whole 10 years of Hitler, and even before.\nMy whole 2,000 year history, that was all in me.",
        "A: Yes, I'll try. I wasn't in the barracks for too long. I would think there was a very bad feeling,\nalready on my part. I had come to Theresienstadt actually with great expectations. Right\naway I was disappointed. Where's my mother? Not here. My sister? Never heard of her. All\nmy friends? Zero. So already my mood was very down. Then I get stuck into \u2014 I get\nseparated from Eva Simmon \u2014 from my friend, from all the kids, from all the people I knew,\nfrom Golly also. Golly was with me for a while, but we weren't together in \u2014 on the straw at\nall. She was somewhere else. And then these women, these were all older women whom I've\nnever seen before. And they were wrapped in their grief \u2014 in their separation from their\nfamilies. It just was no camaraderie there whatsoever. And I felt lonely, and maybe the\nhostility came from me, but I could not form a friendship on that straw there at all. And, I\nrepeat, it's very important, in a situation that we were in, to have a friend \u2014 to have someone\nto share things with.",
        "A: That's a question I never asked myself. But as I think back, I would say it was not unusual to\nform a very close friendship. What else did we have? That was all that was allowed to us \u2014 a\npersonal friendship. And I would say it was not too uncommon. I could observe it looking\nback now. In that room where we then lived, in that basement, and where we worked\nupstairs with the children, most of the other inhabitants were Czech nurses, Czech girls.\nBecause we were, after all in Czechoslovakia. And, looking back, they were very tightly\nclose together. And there was a bit of a gulf between them and us. They considered\nthemselves in their own country, and we were the newcomers. So we didn't form friendships\nwith them at all. But they formed friendships with themselves.",
        "A: It's hard to say. I'm sure there were male-female friendships as well. First of all, as I\nmentioned before, marriages were permitted, and my friend Golly very soon married the\nman that she had followed, and then lived with him in a small little room somewheres \u2014 even\njust in a corner of a small room. It was not a luxurious way of living. So there was male-\nfemale relationships throughout the ghetto, and I would think, yes, there were friendships\neither way.",
        "A: Oh. I wasn't aware of that. No. I was not aware of that.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, that's correct. Oh, definitely. No, I was not afraid of \u2014 I was not aware of same sex\nfriendships. You know that was very, very taboo. Number one in the Jewish Religion, and\nnumber one in Germany. Hitler killed homosexuals. The list of hate was Jews, homosexuals,\nblacks and then everybody else. But that was not allowed. Ah, forget it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don't quite see what you're asking me. Are you asking me if the kind of friendship I had\nwith Eva, I could also observe between two men?",
        "A: Yeah. I'm wondering if I'm at all able to answer that because I had no insight into where the\nmen lived, but I would think \u201cyes.\u201d I would think they formed very close camaraderie as\nwell. How else could they survive? So I would think the question of that must be \u201cyes,\u201d but I\nwouldn't know from any personal experience. Now what was the other part of the question?",
        "A: That's a good question, and I have often been asked that. I did not observe it while I was\nthere, but since then I have read a lot about it. But I don't think that there was because the\nNazis were strictly forbidden to fraternize with the Jews \u2014 strictly. And if anything like that\noccurred, it wasn't only the Jew that was punished, the Nazi was punished as well. But I have\nsince then heard so much of that, that I'm wondering if I was just not aware of it. But I don't\nthink so. It certainly wasn't so that I could observe it. The Nazis and Jews were strictly\nseparated.",
        "A: How about what?",
        "A: Sex among Jews? I would think \u201cyes.\u201d I would think that went on. We were not in a situation\nlike Auschwitz, and also we were healthier. And fairly \u2014 there were babies born in the\nghetto. So that \u2014 so my answer is \u201cyes.\u201d",
        "A: Yes. They came to us to the home. We took care of them, with their mothers. The mothers\nnursed and the fathers came to visit, so I would say \u201cyes.\u201d There was a normal life there.",
        "A: Both. Both. Many came pregnant from their homes \u2014 from their original homes \u2014 very many,\nand I would think.... Also, officially, pregnancies had to be terminated, and were in the\nwhole Elbe Hospital. But yes, I think we had some babies there that were....",
        "A: Absolutely. That was... They were ordered.",
        "A: No. There was no question \u2014 no problem.",
        "A: No. I was not in that part of the health system. I was with the product \u2014 with the nurses with\nthe babies. We got quite attached to some of those babies. And that's how I met Jirca. He was\nthe brother of one of the nursing mothers there, you see. Otherwise, I don't think I would\nhave known him. And, you know, we were both young, and we went on walks together. One\nthing I remember so much from Theresienstadt is we got such a love and appreciation of the\nstars, of the firmament. You know that was one of the few things we were allowed to do. We\ncould look up and look, and he knew the stars very well, so he gave me a lasting appreciation\nof constellations, and of planets, and first magnitude stars, and I was very happy about that.",
        "A: Yes. And then, during the International Commission, and already before, they decided that\nthe town would look more normal if that, up to then dead, clock up on the church tower\nwould spring to life. And somehow, I don't know why, he got the job of winding up that\nclock, and he took me with him a couple of times. And that was a permanent event in my\nlife. I can still see every steep step that I climbed, I climbed up there. And as I got higher and\nhigher, how the fragrant air came through that opening, \u2018cause there was nothing \u2014 1t was\nopen, you see, on the top, and how that wonderful air from the surrounding countrysides....\nThe ghetto of course had always bad air, also many people, and there was nothing to give air\nto. And here I came up this was this \u2014 and then the view \u2014 and he could see Prague in the\ndistance. I couldn't, but I think he kind of hoped he could see Prague. That was his home\ntown. But I could see the Elbe and the Eger. That was wonderful blue rivers, unpolluted, and\nI can still remember how I wished I could swim, and how I almost felt the cool water on my\nshoulders. We hadn't been swimming since I was a child, you see. And I can still remember\nhow I dreamt that I could dive into that water and feel the water go over my shoulders. And\nthen we heard bird sings. But also as we looked at the beautiful things, we also saw die\nKleine Festung.\u2019\u201d One of the features of the ghetto was what was called \"die Kleine\nFestung.\" That was \u2014 you see, Theresienstadt was a garrison town built in the 1600s or the\n1700s for soldiers, and naturally they had to have like a correction place for soldiers that\nneeded to be punished, and that was die \u2014 a medieval fortress \u2014 a medieval, almost like a\ntorture fortress, where they put the soldiers that needed to be isolated. And they recovered\nthis again from medieval times and put the Jews in there. Took terrible consequences. The\nJews there were \u2014 were never returned. It was also, by the way, a historical place. The young\nman by the name of Gavrilo Princip who shot the Crown Prince in 1914, and started World\nWar I in Sarajevo \u2014 I say \u201cSarajevo\u201d \u2014 You say it differently, don't you? How do you say it?\nSarajevo. Sarajevo, which is so much in the news now. That how World War I started as you\n\u201d The little fortress (German)\nprobably know. It was called, \u201cthe shot that went around the world.\u201d That young man \u2014 that\nyoung Princip was imprisoned in the Kleine Festung, and then he died just before the end of\nthe war, and he's buried outside the Kleine Festung. So it has a very historical side to it. So\nthis is what we saw from up on the tower and I only, reluctantly, always, went back down\ninto the ghetto after he took me up there.",
        "A: I think it was a couple of times. It kind of kaleidoscoped into one because each time it was\nsuch a wonderful experience. It think 1t was maybe two, three times. And he was, naturally,\nnot allowed to take me up there, so by the time we came down into the, into the ground floor\nagain, he always had to look out first that no SS was around and then he could sneak me out.\nWe took pleasure where we could.",
        "A: Yes. I always feel a little guilty because I did not go through that terrible hell that so many of\nother Jews went through. I never was in a gas chamber. I was never in real danger of my life.\nI was, of course, constantly, \u2018cause all the time those transports would go out \u2014 and I\nsurvived. And I that's \u2014 I think part of why I'm still religious \u2014 I did survive. Miracles did\nhappen.",
        "A: It stopped. It stopped. We were so worried when they took our, our napkins as contraband in\nthe Schleusse. And of course, by the way, those were not these elegant little contraptions that\nyoung women use today. It was something that we used, had to wash out afterwards, and\nused again. And we were so worried when it was... when those were taken from us, and then\nwe didn't need them for which reason I don't know. And it impacted us differently. Some of\nus became very heavy and very fat, and others became very thin after we lost our\nmenstruation \u2014 and I kind of got a little thin and Eva got a little heavier \u2014 I don't know why.",
        "A: Nice. I met Freddi when I was still in the Hundertschaft because I was detailed to sweep in\nfront of his home \u2014 his children's home. He was the leader of the children's home. He was\nalready a prominent Zionist before, and he attracted the young people around himself. And\nthen when he got out of the Hundertschaft, he was detailed to the children's home to work\nwith the children. It was of course forbidden to have classes or real instructions, so he always\nwas able to lead and guide and instruct the children kind of on the sly. While they were\nsupposedly working, he would give instructions, and he was very much beloved. He was a\nvery lovely young man \u2014 a real Zionist \u2014 a real ethical figure. And the Germans respected\nhim for a long time, and then the reason he got into the next transport was \u2014 yes, I remember\nthat. A transport of children from Czechoslovakia showed up \u2014 from Slovakia showed up \u2014\nalone \u2014 barefoot, in terrible condition \u2014 and we heard about it. And they didn't speak\nanything but Polish, and he of course spoke Polish. And we... Eva went as a nurse to that\ntransport also. I didn't. I don't know why. That was the one time we didn't do things together.\nThat transport was a group of children whose parents had been shot, and these children had\nwitnessed that, and they were very frightened \u2014 very intimidated. And the order came from\nthe SS that we were not allowed to speak to them. We were not allowed to know that their\nparents were shot and killed, and the kids, not speaking any other language but Polish, were\nnot permitted to speak to us who spoke German. So Freddi Hirsch disobeyed that order and\nspoke to the children in a soothing way, and he was caught at that, and he was, of course, put\nonto the next transport. And he wrote a card back that I remember. After some time he wrote\nback that... First for a long time we didn't hear from him, and then he wrote back, \"We\nshould do all we can to stay in the ghetto and not to volunteer and not to provoke our\nentrance into an east transport.\" And we were puzzled about this because we thought we had\nit very bad. We had no news from Auschwitz. We did not know how bad they had it, and so\nwe, we got our first inkling how bad Auschwitz must be if he advised us to stay where we\nare.",
        "A: That stopped. I heard that once in Berlin, \"Die werden alle vergast.\u201d And I thought that guy\nwas out of his mind to make such a statement, and then we didn't hear it anymore. We didn't\nhear it anymore. We heard only that they were working, and they couldn't write for a while\nthey could write, but only for a while. And I never heard from Eva and Werner Simmon. I\nsurely would have heard from them if they had lived. And when Golly was deported to\nAuschwitz, or rather when she followed her husband to Auschwitz, I didn't hear from her.\nSo, there was something fishy going on and we knew it. But also we \u2014 I think we purposely\nclosed our minds to it. We purposely \u2014 because we were so apt to go into the next transport,\nand why should we think we were going to be killed right away So, self preservation, we\ntook that out of our minds.",
        "A: Yes. I have to assume so. Yes.\n*\u00b0 Jewish council (German); term used for Jewish administrative boards appointed by the Nazis\nto oversee Jewish communities and ghettos.",
        "A: I'm not sure, but.... Yes, of course it was the Judenrat. I am sure, because when the October\ntransports \u2014 the one that Jirca went on, just before the Commission. Then all of a sudden\nEdelstein was taken prisoner, and his wife was told to bring food three times a day, and to\nbring fresh clothing once a week. And she never got any \u2014 any dishes back, and she never\ngot any dirty laundry back. He was, as we know now, he was already in the Kleine Festung\nand probably already dead. And the reason was that he did not want to cooperate in those\ntransports. He refused to put that many people up for transports. So the answer to your\noriginal question is \u201cyes.\u201d It was the Jews who made the transport. Of course it had to be.\nThe Germans didn't do it anymore. Why should they? And it was the Jews who worked in\nthe Schleusse. The Schleusse of course went both ways \u2014 in and out. And who took the\npeople to the cattle cars and everything else? Thank God I never had to do that. I only went\nto all the incoming transports to see if I would find anybody I knew. And, in fact, by then the\ntrains came right into the ghetto. And there was a certain barrack where we could go to and\njust look out the window and see the people come. Eva and I did that. We watched to see if\nwe knew anybody.",
        "A: Yes, I would think so. I would think so. I would think so. I don't think they considered it\nstealing \u2018cause\u2014",
        "A: \u2018Cause it was that \u2014 it was already stolen in the first place.",
        "A: But I think so, yes. And then they could do a little good with it. And then often they would\nexchange these things for cigarettes. Cigarettes were very coveted. Everybody wanted to\nsmoke.",
        "A: Don't ask me, I never smoked, and I never touched a cigarette \u2014 or maybe I touched one once\nor twice \u2014 but they loved cigarettes. I think it got them away from the ghetto. I think it made\nthem feel normal again.",
        "A: I never did.",
        "A: No. Never. No. It wasn't done. At home nobody smoked. It never occurred to me to smoke.\nMaybe I did once or twice, and I think I was very sick afterwards, so I never did it again. I\nstill don't smoke.",
        "A: The food. When we came in, as our belongings were taken away from us, we got in return\none little thing \u2014 one little pot kind of a thing out of metal, that we had to hook onto\nourselves \u2014 and not to lose it, because we didn't get a second one. If we lost it, we just didn't\nget any food. So we hung onto it for dear life. And three times a day, while we were still in\nthe Hundertschaft \u2014 in the beginning \u2014 three times a day we went to the Essensausgabe Z\nthe distribution center for the food. And in the morning we got coffee, and they called it\neine\u201d buchta\u2019\u2019 \u2014 was kind of a square shaped piece of bread. And at noontime we got soup\nand bread, and a little margarine, I think. And in the evening we got soup, and a little sugar,\nand coffee. And that had to do us. And maybe a little bit bread again. But then when we\nworked in the children's home, then the food came to us already. It came into the home and it\nwas much better then.",
        "A: No, no. There was one central station that did all the food.",
        "A: Only in the way that it was a little more that we got. A little more volume, quantity. And\nthese places where they distributed the food, mostly the old people had to go because they\nhad no place of work. The people who worked \u2014 I have to assume \u2014 that it was the same as in\nthe children's home \u2014 that the food was brought to them, rather they stopping their wor.... Of\ncourse, it had to be that way \u2018cause the Germans wouldn't allow the people to wander off at\nnoontime and go to lunch, huh? That wasn't done. So I have to assume, then the food came\nin a little better quantity. And later on, during and after the Commission, there was also\nbetter quality. There was sent much better food. I remember my agony when I saw for the\nfirst time some meat swimming in that soup. Up to then there was no meat. It was just \u2014 Eva\nand I always compared it to, to the dishwater that we threw out after washing our dishes.\nYou know, a little, little eyes of fat swimming on it, like it was from our dishes at home\nwhen we were still living normally. And then suddenly I found a piece of meat in there and I\ndidn't know what to do because I hadn't eaten meat up to then. In the hospital, in Berlin, up\nto \u2014 after I left was kosher, and up to then there was no problem, and suddenly I was\n*' Food distribution (German)\nA (German)\n*\u00b0 Baked yeasted dumpling (German)\nconfronted with a piece of meat, and I remember my agony. \u201cShould I eat it, or shouldn't I?\u201d\nEva had no such qualms because she was never kosher, and she ate it of course.",
        "A: I ate it too, but after a long struggle. And it didn't taste good. I was sorry I ate it. It was\nprobably horse meat and I shouldn't even have touched it.",
        "A: I didn't feel guilty, but I felt sorry. And Eva said, \"You have to keep your strength up, and\nyou have to eat it,\" and this and that, but I shouldn't have listened to her. I did okay without\nthe meat. I think I didn't eat it a second time. But I remember that so well because it was such\na such an opening into decision making all of a sudden. Up to now you didn't have to make\nany decisions, and all of a sudden you.... That was the first important decision, and then the\nnext important decision was to go on the Swiss transport or not.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Yes. I can give you a very clear picture of that. When we were still living in the barracks, at\nfirst \u2014 and you mustn't think that after I left, everybody else left in the barracks also. Oh, no.\nThe barracks were always constantly filled with newcomers. Every newcomer first had to\nstay in the barracks for quite a while, so it was very filthy there, very, very filthy. And it was\nlike some toilets for the whole barracks. It was directly taken over from when they used it as\nmilitary barracks, so whatever it was, that I don't remember that too well. It was just, you\nknow, very primitive. This was 1940ish and there was not very great luxury.",
        "A: There was no running water. I think it was a latrine. Yes, I believe it was. You see that was\nnot so strange to me because in Ansbach, way back when I was a child, that's all there was.\nSo it was not a culture shock that if somebody would have to go there today \u2014 you know -\u2014 it\nwas the outhouse. It was where we went, you see. Just Berlin was much more elegant there.\nWe had a real toilet. But, so I was back in my youth \u2014 so what? But in the home for the\nchildren, when Eva and I lived in the basement, I remember very well the way we showered\nand the way we washed our hair, it was just a low faucet, and we had to kind of crouch under\nit when there was warm water, or even had cold water. And I remember Eva and I washing\nour hairs, each other, \u2018cause she doesn't remember all of that. I have to tell her again and\nagain how I washed her hair and she washed my hair. And I remember that clearly, but about\nthe toilet I don't remember. I think we had running water in the home already. You see those\nthings didn't stay with me because, you know, it was something that just had to be done, and\nyou did it, and it didn't stay with me. I think we had a running toilet, although I'm not\npositive.",
        "A: Soap? We had soap. We had some primitive soap, like Waschseife*\u2019 \u2014 these big bars that\nwere given to us. We had to have soap because we washed the children also. In the home it\nwas clean. Now you asked about sanitary conditions. We had, we had to keep that basement\nroom clean, naturally. There was no maid service. And we had to wash our own things in\nthat little faucet. But the big, big problem in Theresienstadt were the bedbugs, and we could\nnot rid ourselves of the bedbugs ever. In the summer, no matter how we tried to keep the\nbeds clean, or anything \u2014 naturally we didn't change beds all that often \u2018cause we had to\nwash the bedding under that little water and hang it out to dry in the winter. I don't think we\never changed beds. So we had enormous problem with bedbugs \u2014 the whole ghetto. And in\nthe summer we just took a blanket and slept outdoors. And there again it was always that\nbeautiful sky. There were no lights to interfere, you see. The whole, the whole ghetto was\nblacked out \u2014 number one because they wouldn't spend any of the \u2014 any electricity on us, and\nnumber two, it was wartime. We had to be blacked out. We couldn't attract enemy fire. So\nwe slept outdoors under that gorgeous sky. And once in a while the ghetto, house by house,\nwould be de-debugged, and it didn't do a thing. After a week or two the bugs were back. So\nthat was a really big problem. We scratched and scratched, and then those things got\ninfected, and it was a mess. There was nothing we could do, no matter how we tried. And\nyou asked about the water. I have no recollection of it. It was probably drinkable. I don't\nrecall.",
        "A: No, I don't remember feeling thirsty. I think once we were in the home there was always\nwater because of the children. We took very good care of those children, and I remember\nhow strict we were with, with the mothers to keep their children clean, and not to bring in\nanything, \u2018cause there was always lice and bedbugs.\n** Washing soap (German)\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: The children's home. It was not a hospital.",
        "A: The children's home. Yes, I can recollect that very well. We had from babies to \u2014 I would\nsay, two years old. Now these were children that came in transports. A lot of them were of\nmixed marriages \u2014 the so-called Mischlinge that the Germans didn't know what to do with.\nThese were not necessarily sick children. This was a regular children's home \u2014 babies' home\n\u2014 for which I actually was trained. That was my diploma. And we, we took care of them as\nbest we could. For instance, I remember we had to wash the diapers out all the time. You\nknow, naturally, I mean what do you expect in the \u201840s in Germany? And hang them up to\ndry and use them over and over again. And the children stayed with us day and night. The\nmothers could come and visit. In some cases they nursed and came three times a day, but in\nmost \u2014 in all cases they had to work otherwise, and just came to visit their kids. And I\nremember we were fairly strict with those mothers. We didn't let them \u2014 we were the bosses,\nnot the mothers, you see. We told them when they could take up their kids and not. We were\nalways afraid they would bring in lice, or bedbugs, or disease, or whatever \u2014 and these were\nour kids and we were keeping them nice and clean and healthy. We had a physician coming,\nI don't know how often now. But if one of the kids were sick we sent them to the hospital.\nAnd we worked very hard. We had to do everything. We had to clean the rooms, do the\nwashing, we had to feed the kids. The food came in. We didn't have to cook it. So it was an\nall around job. And we \u2014 in some cases when we got very attached to the children, it was\nterrible when they were called on transport. And then after a while we hardened against this.\nWe tried not to get attached, but that's hard to do.",
        "A: I remember we took them out into that little park. Just in front of the home \u2014 just in front of\nBergstrasse 14 there was a little park, just a little enclosure where there were greenery and a\ncouple of trees. And I remember we took them out into that park. We dressed them up\nwarmly if the weather was warm, and that was always so nice. We could sit in the park for a\nfew minutes watching our kids, but really we were sitting in the park \u2014 and just to get them\nsome fresh air and some normal activities. Otherwise, we didn't do anything with them. They\nslept, and were fed, and were cleaned, and bathed, and slept again. That was all we did. We\ncouldn't do anything with them. Later on when the Commission came, then they built in that\nsame little park, playgrounds, and swings, and rockinghorses, and everything. And we had to\ninstruct the kids what to do with them. And then the kids in turn, these were the older kids,\nwere instructed to play act \u2014 that they were always playing on these things.",
        "A: The age range?",
        "A: From newborn to about three.",
        "A: After they were three, then they got into that home that Freddi Hirsch was, was \u2014 or maybe\nfour I would think. No, we didn't keep them \u2018til four. There must have been another in-\nbetween step, because Freddi's children were also already much older. I think there was an\nin-between step. We had the small ones, and he had already the trainable ones. There must\nhave been one other step in between, but at the moment I don't know what it was.",
        "A: No. They were happy. They were cute. They were kids. What always surprised us was how\nhealthy they were. And also what surprised us was that the mothers could even produce kids.\nThe mothers themselves were dehydrated and undernourished, and they produced perfectly\nnice kids. No, I would think those kids were okay. They didn't know. They went into their\ndeaths without ever knowing.",
        "A: At first it wasn't a problem. At first we were very close to them, but don't forget they had\nmothers. We didn't need to be that close to them. And later on we tried not to be, not to be in\nlove with them at all, \u201ccause we knew they were going. Later on, as the transports escalated,\nthey were going as quickly as they came in, and then we didn't go too close to them\nanymore.",
        "A: No. I don't think it affected the children. We still gave them all the care we wanted to, we\nneeded to, but we just didn't let our hearts go out to them. They were cute kids. It was\nterrible. That whole Theresienstadt was just another collection center, and it took us a while\nto realize that. It was just another center to go to your death. And some, of course, died there\ntoo. The old people died easily. And some of the children died too \u2014 and some of the other\npeople. Disease, malnutrition, severe depressions. I don't think there were many suicides. At\nleast I wasn't aware of it. I wasn't aware of suicides.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yes. In Berlin was a lot of suicide. I was not aware, maybe I was just not aware of it, I can't\ntell you of any suicides in Theresienstadt. No, I remember. And anyone who died was\nburned, and the ashes were put into little bags, and then \u2014 I was in that building once. I don't,\nI don't remember why. It was \u2014 you see, those, those walls that surrounded the ghetto were\nhollow inside, you see. You could walk into them. Those were huge walls \u2014 huge medieval\nwalls. They were hollow inside, and on top of them there was earth, and there was grass.\nThat was called die Bastei.\u201d\u2019 And later on you could plant vegetables up here, and you could\nwalk up there and have a ballgame up there. But what I'm thinking, at the moment, these\nurns, 1f you want to call them urns \u2014 it was just in little paper bags with a name on them,\nwere stored in those \u2014 between those huge walls. And for some reason or other I was 1n there\nonce. I don't know why or how I got there. But I remember being there and seeing those\nrows and rows of \u2014 of little packages with ashes. I have no recollection how I got there. And\nthen, after a while, there were so many that the SS ordered the Jewish government to dispose\nof them. And then they put them onto a barge, and the barge was taken out into the River\nElbe and was sunk. So a lot of people's ashes are sunk in the River Elbe.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Yes there was. I don't know where it was, but yes there was. Ya. And after we left there was\nanother crematorium being built \u2014 actually before we left already. There were rumors that a\ncrematorium was being built, but then we left and I don't know what became of tt.\n* The bastion (German)",
        "A: In Theresienstadt?",
        "A: No, not that I remember. I don't recall. It's a good question. I don't think so. Eva and I\nfantasized a lot. Eva and I, in our spare time, we, we built some huge dream castles. We\ncalled it \u2014 first of all we talked a lot about food \u201ccause we were always hungry, and we gave\nit a name. We called it \u201cMagenonanie.*\u201d\u201d It's really a name we made up. \u201cMagen\u201d is your\nstomach. So it was \u201cStomach-Onanie,\u201d and \u201cOnanie\u201d is masturbation. So we had a very nice\ntime masturbating our stomachs with dreams of food. Of all the things we had eaten, and all\nthe things we're going to be eating again. And that satisfied us for the moment. I think we\nmade up that name. I've never heard it before or since. And then we also dreamt that we\nwould get out. That kept us going. We always dreamt that we, we would survive all this. We\nwere hoping that we wouldn't get into a transport. If we would go into a transport, we knew\nthat was the end. But we were hoping very.... And the big question was if one of us would go\ninto a transport, would the other one voluntarily go along? And we kind of didn't make a\ndecision on that, and thank God it never came up. And then we dreamt that we would get\nout, and get married, and find love. You see, we were by now 22, 23. Love was not a thing\nwe were very familiar with, aside from these flirtations and these.... You know, somebody\nonce brought me a bunch of flowers that they had picked up on the Bastei, that, that was the\nheight of courtship. You know, that was fabulous. I still remember it, and the smell of them,\nand the look of them \u2014 and just the whole gesture of receiving flowers, you know. So\nanyway... So we dreamt we would lead a normal life, and have husbands, and have children\n\u2014 and then we let our fantasy go wild, and we said, \"And then our children will marry.\" And\nwe promised ourselves our children would marry each other. And, as you know, it did\nbecome true. My son \u2014 my daughter and her son married, but not because we wanted it to. I\nwas so surprised when my daughter called up and said, \u201cJoe and I are engaged.\u201d I was the\nmost surprised person in the world. Also, 30 years before that, Eva and I had dreamt about tt.\nThat was one of the miracles of my life.",
        "A: I would think so. It certainly didn't do us any harm. I think it got us over some rough spots.\nAnd you know we had to fill the time.

Maybe that's the way it 1s.",
        "A: I struggled a lot. I struggled a lot, and I argued a lot with people, and I philosophized a great\ndeal with, especially, one of my cousins who also remained very religious. And I\nphilosophized a great deal with him. In fact I still have some of those letters that we wrote\nback and forth way back after I was released from Theresienstadt. And I struggled a great\ndeal, but then by the time I married a very religious man, then the struggle was over and I\nhad to come to some, to some peace within myself. And the peace is that there is no answer.\nThat I have to live with a God who 1s good, and not good at the same time. And the answer is\nthat there is no answer, that you have to just, just accept it. But the thing is you have to have\nsomething. I can't turn to, to drugs, or to hippy living, or to anything. You have to have\nsomething in your life. So my something 1s religion, and that's the answer for me. It's very\nunsatisfactory, but it's the best I can do.",
        "A: Yes. I became very depressed after my first child was born. The interesting thing 1s, my\nmother was deported on the ninth of November, and my son was born on the ninth of\nNovember.

        "A: Did I ever get depressed? Yes. After my first son was born I fell into a deep depression. I\ndidn't function anymore. I had a home, I had a husband, I had a son. I was living in freedom.\nI had food on the table without end and I couldn't function any further. And my husband,\nwho is a physician, advised me to seek professional help, which was in those days, in the\nearly \u201840s, a stigma. You didn't go to a psychiatrist. You didn't go to a psychologist. You just\ndealt with your problems. But wisely enough he advised me to get professional help. And the\ninteresting answer was that I had a guilt complex. Now in the early \u201840s that was unheard of.\nWhat was a guilt complex? Nobody knew that. Now we know that most people who do go\nthrough a hard time come out with a guilt feeling. And my complex was, \"Why me? Why\nam I living this Life of Riley now? Why not my sister? Why not my husband's sisters? Why\nwasn't my mother alive to enjoy that baby with me? My husband's mother or father?\"\nEverybody was gone with the exception of my father, in both our families. And why was I\nalive? What did I do that guaranteed me such joy? And the normal reaction, as I now know\nof the mind and the body, is a depression. And I got over it because I got help. And then I\nalso got over it because I felt I had to do something for that gift of life, and I got over it then.",
        "A: That was another miracle. That was another miracle. I can still see Eva and me sitting on our\nbunks. I can still see that in my mind. We were beginning to be very low, even Eva in all her\nViennese humor and gaiety. It was February 1, 1945, and we were sitting on the upper bunk.\nWe changed bunks every so often because the window was right at the upper bunk level, and\nwhy should one only look out the window all the time, so we changed bunks, and I don't\nknow whose, whose turn it was, but we were sitting on the upper bunk and watching the\ncobblestones out in the window, and then somebody came. And all we could see, of course,\nwas just up to their mid-calves. And anyone that ever came brought bad news, or God forbid\nthe slip to go into the transport, so naturally we were \u2014 we stopped our conversation and we\nwere very much afraid. And then the person that came said that the next transport would go\nto Switzerland, February 1, 1945. The war was on, killing was still in high gear, and\nsomebody was going to take us to Switzerland? And so at first we just ignored it. And then\nthe next morning, we heard it again. And then we heard it from people whom we trusted that\nwere in with the administration, and we heard \u2014 especially we, we young women who were\nstill looking pretty well, we heard, \"Go ahead. Go and register for that transport. Hurry up.\"\nAnd so after a while, Eva in her light \u2014 I would never have registered , I'm sure I thank my\nwhole life to her \u2014 she said, \"Come on, let's go. Let's go. Let's register. Why wait for\nanything else?\" And of course all we could think of was all those transports that they said\nwould go to Palestine, and they never got to Palestine. So I said, \"But what if we end up in\nAuschwitz?\" So she said, \"Then our problems are solved if we should join the other one.\nThen we're together already anyway. So, nothing to lose. We go.\"\nSo we went, and we had to register, which was very different from the other transports. We\nwere looked over. We had to answer questions, especially the question I remember was,\n\"Did any one of your family ever die in Theresienstadt, or was sent away to the East?\" And\nwe had nobody, you see. So we could say \u201cno.\u201d And then we saw him write down that we\ncould get into the transport. And then the next day \u2014 this was all packed into two days, you\nsee. There was no way of come back in two weeks or anything like that, no red tape of any\nkind. So then the next day we got that brown slip that I showed you before where it says that\nwe should appear on February the fourth, at seven o'clock in the evening, with one suitcase \u2014\nno bedrolls, no rucksacks, nothing of the kind \u2014 and nicely dressed and punctual. The\nGermans were very much for punctuality, whether that was for your liberation or for your\ndeath, you be punctual. So we went, and we left the rest of the people in the basement room,\nand we really didn't believe we were really going to Switzerland. We did believe something\nwas different. And in the train, it was not a cattle car this time, in the train we got packages\nof marmalade, and stuff that I didn't even know what to do with. And then we left, Eva and I\nvery much together, and we really got to Switzerland. And when we got to Switzerland, we\ncrossed the border into Switzerland I remember three things that stayed in my mind very\nmuch. We looked out the window. Number one, nobody yelled us, \"Get back in or you'll be\nshot,\" you know. And number two, the people smiled. I hadn't seen a person smile in 12\nyears. What was there to smile at? All through my youth and my growing up. The people\nsmiled at us. And the person that \u2014 then some Swiss people in uniform came tn and they\nwere nice to us, and that was unheard of, anyone 1n uniform being nice to Jews. What's this?\nGan Eden?\u201d\u00ae Already we're dead and we're in paradise. Was unheard of. And then the third\nthing I remember, night fell and the lights stayed on. There was no war in Switzerland, you\nsee. The lights purposely stayed on so the airplanes overhead could tell that it was\nSwitzerland and wouldn't bomb it. But to us it was an epiphany. It was unheard of. So then\nwe were allowed to pick one of the several places where we could go, and Eva and I stayed\ntogether and picked Les Avants, and then she fell in love with a French refugee who had also\ncome, and she followed him to France because she was completely alone. And I contacted\nmy father, and then he let me come over to America, and I married. And by gosh when our\nkids became teenagers they visited back and forth, and J ean\u201d fell in love with Polly\u201d \u2014 right\nunder my eyes, and I didn't see it happen. And I didn't know for many years just how that all\ncame about. May I tell you just very quickly.\nMaybe you know it already, but to me it was a very, very fascinating story because I\ndiscovered it myself. It wasn't told to me. I went to the National Archives. I had an advisor,\nTim Mulligan, to guide me through the whole process, and I discovered the documents and\nread them, and I found out that at the end of 1944, a Jewish-Swiss woman by the name of\nRecha Sternbuch, very religious woman.... I'll condense the story a little bit \u2014 approached\n\u00b0\u00b0 Garden of Eden (Hebrew)\n*\u00b0 Jean Hammel\n* Polly Haas-Hammel\nJean-Marie Musy, who was a Swiss \u2014 a former Swiss President. First she thought she wanted\nher mother and father to be taken out of Germany. Musy was a friend of Himmler's and he\nhad rescued a few Jews before, and she approached him to get her parents out. And then, she\nthought, \u201c\u201cWhy not try to get all the Jews out?\u201d It was late in the war, and she asked him to\ncontact Himmler, and she said she, in turn, would contact the Americans and see if for a\ncertain ransom he would let the Jews out of Germany. And by gosh he agreed. This is now,\nof course, I'm condensing this very much. He agreed. Musy went to Germany to meet him\nfirst in his railroad car, then at another secret location, and he agreed. And I saw the\ncorrespondence between him and \u2014 Himmler and Musy \u2014 and then later with Sternbuch. He\nwanted first \u2014 first he wanted lorries, trucks to continue the war, but the Americans of course\ndidn't do that. In the meantime Sternbuch had contacted the Va\u2019ad Ha-Hatsala, which 1s the\nUnion of Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada. And they had formed this Va\u2019ad, just for\nthe purpose of helping the Jews \u2014 the war was ending \u2014 whom they knew would come and\nneeded help, even in Europe. And when Sternbuch contacted them, they immediately agreed\nto collect money to buy out the Jews.\nIn the end, the first transport, it was exchanged for 5,000,000 American dollars, and was to\nbe of twelve hundred people out of Theresienstadt, because we still looked good, and as I\nhave said before, especially we young people were urged to, to come. And then Hitler \u2014 and\nthe condition that Himmler made was that he should get good publicity in Swiss and\nAmerican press. Why? Because he saw the war ending, and he saw his own fate clearly\nbefore him. After all, he was the originator of all that killing, and he now wanted to\nwhitewash himself. He wanted good publicity and good treatment when the war ended. And\nthis was done without Hitler's knowledge. And Hitler heard about it. When the first 1,200\nJews came out, he heard about it. And he immediately disinherited Himmler. Himmler had\nto flee, and he forbade every other contact \u2014 every other release \u2014 Jews or non-Jews \u2014\nnobody leaves Germany anymore. So we were the only transport. And Musy, who it is\nbelieved enriched himself from those 5,000,000 dollars went back into obscurity. Nobody\nheard from him. Then he died. He was already 76 years old at the time of his intercourse\nwith Himmler. But he died later. Mrs. Sternbuch was much honored and also died much later\n\u2014in \u201871. And Himmler had to flee first from Hitler, who was going to kill him \u2014 and he\nwandered around Luneburger Heide which 1s a place \u2014 a lonely place in Germany, and then\nhe had to flee from the Allies. It was the English \u2014 the British that captured that part of\nGermany. And when the Allies did capture him, not knowing whom they had, he took\ncyanide and killed himself. And then they knew it was Himmler. It was too late. And I was\nsaved. He tried to save himself and he saved me instead. Isn't that a miracle? I was number\n1,400\u2014 number 1,174 out of those 1,200.",
        "A: Seventy-five. She was right next \u2014 right behind me. It's really something.",
        "A: It was. I remember that quite well. She, she \u2014 we said \u201cgoodbye\u201d to each other at the, at the\ntrain station in Zurich, and well, of course, she was the happiest woman in the world. She\nwas very much in love with Eric, who \u2014 her future husband. The interesting thing 1s they\nwere married in Paris, and who would be the officiating Rabbi? My own Eli Munk from\nAnsbach. Isn't that something. And then when Jean and Polly got engaged and were about to\nmarry, Eli Munk was then a very old gentleman already and he was living in New York, and\nthe marriage was 1n Boston, and I wanted very much for him to marry our children. But then\nhe was already. He tried, but he was already too old. But, no, it wasn't all that hard for us to,\nto part. We knew we would stay friends, and we knew we would visit each other, and we\ndid. She and I had some great visits with each other. She lost her husband much too soon,\nand her son and my daughter had four children, and we are very devoted grandmothers.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I didn't say that to him. You can't say that to a beloved and respected Rabbi. That\nwas something that I, that I have to keep in my own mind because I'm still very friendly with\nhis sons and daughters \u2014 especially with his daughter who married the Chief Rabbi of Great\nBritain, Jakobovitz,\u2019' and I'm very friendly with Lady Emily(ph). And I still adore her father\nand her mother, although they're now gone. But you see when I got to Switzerland there's\nanother very interesting connection. They had to fleet Paris \u2014 Munks with all their children \u2014\nin \u201844 or \u201845. They had to flee Paris, and they fled to Geneva, and when he heard that I was\nin Les Avants, which is very close to Geneva, he came immediately to visit me. And you\nknow it was like a father coming. He was so associated with my youth, and so, so beloved by\nme that, that was a bond that never dissolved. And then they invited me their house, and the\nchildren were all very small, and it was a homecoming for me, you see. And now I have long\nforgiven him that. I didn't even think about it anymore. It just came back to me now as I was\nthinking about Ansbach. But you know, the normal measurements of ethics do not apply to\nthe years of the Holocaust. They just don't apply. Was everybody justified in trying to save\nhis or her own life? Were people justified in trying to save their own baby, knowing that if\nthat baby wasn't taken, another mother's baby would have to be substituted? Was I justified\nto let my mother and sister? Was my father justified to leave us? You cannot apply those\nnormal moral standards to the Holocaust years. You just can't. You just can't. So I have long\nforgiven him that he saved his life, and his whole family's life. Why should that whole family\nalso have disappeared? And he has since done so much good. He's been such an outstanding\nRabbi. And then we were not bound to obey him even though he said, \"Stay. Everything will\n*' Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovitz\nbe okay.\" Many people left. We could have left too, and we did after a while. So that's a\nwhole other philosophical problem that you just can't allow yourself to get into it. You get\nlost in the swamp.",
        "A: Oh, that was, that was after.... Let's see, he left in \u201839, and I saw him again in \u201846 \u2014 in April\nof \u201846, and it was very strange. I came by boat, and I arrived \u2014 I think it was during the\nPassover \u2014 during the Pesach holidays. And my father remained very religious. And he came\nto Boston to pick me up. I arrived at the Boston Harbor, and he couldn't travel to the boat to\npick me up. He sent somebody else, and that somebody took me then to an apartment where\nhe stayed and I saw him again. And I thought that I would see an old man because I had\ngone through so much. I had lived six lifetimes, you see, that to me it was like a 100 years.\nAnd I thought there would be this old, broken man full of grief, and full of sorrow and\nremorse. But it wasn't. There was a young, beautiful, dark haired, straight, upright man in his\nprime \u2014 50 years old \u2014 who greeted me. And that was \u2014 I had to adjust my inner vision and\nmy outer, and what I saw in reality. That took a little bit. And it took a while for us to\nbecome comfortable with each other. I will have to admit that. I will have to admit that.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, yes. And you see he didn't really know what we went through. He had his own\nstruggles. It's not that he had a bed of roses. He came up from nothing, and he had great\nsorrow to try to get us over. I have seen his notes after his death, that he never showed me\nactually. But I saw how he went from \u201cPontius to Pilate,\u201d from one person to the other,\nbegging for help \u2014 and nobody helped him. And that wasn't easy either. That couldn't have\nbeen an easy task either \u2014 and knowing that his family....",
        "A: He remained a butcher. Remember he had no real education. He first worked for some other\nJewish kosher butchers in Washington Heights in New York, and then he and his brother\nopened their own little butcher shop \u2014 Schild Brothers \u2014 and they became quite successful,\nbut always within the German Jewish community. And you see his fear of anyone non-\nJewish also never left him. He also carried the scar even though he didn't go through the\nworst. But he told me once when somebody came into the store that spoke English, they\nimmediately were afraid. They immediately thought it was someone to inspect the store, or\nto make trouble, or to want something from them. You see, we all, we all have our scars.\nYou can't go through this without scars \u2014 you just can't. So he was always afraid of anyone\nnot Jewish as well. Those were the enemies. But he lived to a ripe old age. He married again\n\u2014a woman who was in Theresienstadt and lost her husband and two children there. I never\nknew her there \u2014 I couldn't, it was much too big to know people. We were so restricted and\nthen she was much older. I didn't readily associate or become friendly with people of my\nparents' age. I stayed very much with my own age, and possibly with the very old people that\nI went to visit. But I never knew her, and she was very good to him \u2018til the day he died. And\nhe only died about nine years ago at the age of 92. He remained very religious. We became\nvery close too at the end. He never spoke \u2014 I always thought he would say something, at\nleast on his deathbed still, that he shouldn't have left us, or something like that, but he never\ndid. This is another thing I, I don't understand.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Hardly ever. I won't say never, but hardly ever.",
        "A: Barely. Barely. Barely. I don't think he wanted to know.",
        "A: Yes, but very short, only \u2014 I married very soon after I came over. I married within six\nmonths, and so those six months we, we \u2014 he roomed with a family. After all he was\ncompletely alone. And that family took me also in and gave me a room in the same latch\napartment. So we were together for a while. But during that time we were not close, not at\nall. I could not find a way to him, and he, he was obviously guilt ridden too. He never really\nasked. Then toward the very end he gave me my mother's letters, and then, then he was\nalready mellowed, and he gave me my sister's letters, and my own letters. And then he gave\nme also the letters that I wrote to him from Switzerland, so I have a huge bunch of letters\nwhich, which are very, very, very interesting.",
        "A: By a psychiatrist, right?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, I decided\u2014",
        "A: Well, two things \u2014 one egotistical and the other altruistic. The egotistical first. I got myself\nan education. I went to college. My husband, my husband was always very understanding of\nme. He could see, he could see my whole situation much better than I could. And by then \u2014\nthis took a while. My first depression occurred after my first baby was born. And then I still\nwas very timid, very much afraid of authority, very much reluctant to approach anyone that\nwas in authority \u2018cause that was dangerous up \u2018til then. So then after a while I missed very\nmuch that I didn't have an education. And after a while then I went to Bates College in\nLewiston, and they accepted me as one of the very first non-College age students. See now,\nthis is different. This was in the \u201850s \u2014 in the \u201860s. I graduated in \u201871. I was only the second\nperson of non\u2014 of not eighteen years old. I was like 46 or 47, and I did alright. I graduated\nwith a lot of honors and I loved every moment of it. And then I was done. And then I didn't\nknow what to do again, so my husband urged me and he said, \"Go to graduate school.\nBecome a librarian,\" \u2018cause I liked books. And I did that and again I graduated, so now\nwhat? So he said, \"Take a job. Be a librarian.\" And Bates College took me as a librarian, and\nI was very happy there during the years.\nAnd then the second part comes in \u2014 the altruistic part if I may say so. Then I began to\nrealize Bates College, up to not too long ago, was a very Baptist college. When my husband\nbecame college physician in \u2014 soon after our marriage, in the early \u201850s, he was only the\nsecond Jewish employee of that whole college, and the college was in existence for some\n150 years or so \u2014 and very limited Jewish students and no Jewish activities. And they didn't\nknow Jews or Jewish contexts or nothing about the Holocaust. So an opportunity presented\nitself, ready made, and I stepped in. I got myself funding from the National Humanities\nCounsel, and from Jewish organizations, and I began to educate the College. I did programs\nof Jewish contexts, and I made month-long informational college affairs where the people\ncould hear speeches and ask questions, have dialogues, and simply inform themselves,\n\"What is Judaism? What are Jews? What are the finer points of it?\" And really, I was quite\nsuccessful. I got a Jewish library into the college, when the Rabbi of the city where I lived\ndied. This was all back in Maine. We settled in Maine. When he died I was instrumental in\ngetting his whole library into the College, and it's known now as the Rabbi Barrend(ph)\nJewish Library, and it's a fine, fine library. I catalogued it, and integrated it as a special\nlibrary. And that drew Jewish interest. And from that library \u2014 I used that again as my\nplatform \u2014 I gave Jewish talks, and got Jewish persons in. I had Hilberg. \u201d\u201d I had Lansky\u201d of\nthe Yiddish Center. I had Velvel Pasternak of Jewish music. I\u2014 who me? I brought all these\n* Raul Hilberg\n* Aaron Lansky\npeople in and I educated them. Then finally I saw a need \u2014 the people wanted to teach the\nHolocaust and they didn't know what to do. They didn't know how to teach it. So out of that\nactivity, out of all those Jewish affairs that I had organized, was some money left over in the\nend, and I organized the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine for the purpose of\nhelping the teachers teach the Holocaust. And that was a very fine success. I moved out of\nMaine, but the Center stayed, and we have an oral history project, of course. We have a\nteachers' guidebook. We have all kinds of things, were successful. And then I felt better. I\ndon't have a \u2014 I still feel terrible about my losses, but I don't feel guilty anymore. And I speak\nall around the country. And I hear students \u2014 I see there is a necessity to speak, because the\nstudents know only democracy. The constant question is, \"Well, why didn't you just not go,\"\nyou know. Or, \"Why didn't you say you weren't Jewish?\" Or, \"How come you had to give\nyour house up?\" They don't understand this. They're living in a democracy. They don't\nunderstand what it is to live in an autocracy. So I still \u2014 I still feel a need to talk and to write,\nand to answer questions. And I wrote a second book, and I'm writing one now for even\nyounger children, because they need to know.",
        "A: I'm exhausted. That's what I'd like to say. You were a great interviewer, but you got all the\nthings out of me that were long buried, and that had to come up again, and had to be talked\nabout. My life is a patchwork. But the nice thing 1s that the good parts are the quilted ones.\nAnd the not good parts, they just are there. They just are there, but.... I still have nightmares.\nI still, I still have nightmares today, but during the day I'm a very happy person. Thank you.",
        "A: That's it. I'll refer them to you.",
        "A: That's Ansbach. That's the house I was born in \u2014 Turnitzstrasse fiinf\u2019 * and behind those\nwindows on the left hand side was the bedroom. And 1n the front here on the right hand side\nof the door was my father's butcher shop. Nice. My mother and my father in happy times\nwalking away there. I think that's in Ansbach \u2014 near our house. It's not in front of our house.\nSiegfried and Paula Schild \u2014 very clear. Oh, that's a picture in Ansbach in our back yard.\nThat's my grandmother Sophie on the one side, and my Aunt Berta and a cousin visiting.\nAnd that's in the, in the yard where the chickens ran around, and the very background there,\nthat was my father's sausage room where he made the sausage. And on the side, I think that\n** Five (German)\nwas our compost heap, if I'm not mistaken. That was very rural, but happy times. That was\nstill in grade school though. That's a class picture still in grade school \u2014 still happy. I'm the\none with the pigtails on the top row, fourth from the right, skinny little gal \u2014 and still quite\nhappy. That must have been.... How old could I have been there? Eight or nine? Oh, then\nwe're already 16 or so \u2014 no, not quite. I'm not on that picture. My sister Friedl is the one on\nthe right hand side with the short hair; one of the few pictures I have of her. Of that whole\ngroup only two survived, and I'm still friendly with them. And my poor sister was, of course,\none of the victims. Yep, that's my sister Friedl. Yes, that was the youth group we had, always\nclustered around our beloved Rabbi, Eli Munk, and his wife there with the shaytel on, on his\nright, and on the right of Mrs. Munk is my sister Friedl \u2014 there, there she is. That's Friedl.\nAnd I'm there too. I'm in back between Mrs. Munk and Friedl, with the pigtails, and those\nwere such happy times. It was probably Shabbos afternoon when we were singing zmiros >\nand he was telling us stories, and those were such happy times. Most everybody else is gone\nin that picture, but it was the same. And that's Elie Munk again in the back, and all the boys \u2014\nprobably having another session with him and Mrs. Munk. And that was our Hebrew teacher\nthat fellow in the back. Ya, and that's our group. How pretty she was.",
        "A: Sorry?",
        "A: Ya. My sister is the one on the right hand side. Her friend has her arm around her. You can\nsee the hand. And in front of that same friend, that's me. Huh? Oh yes. That was a Purim\nplay. I think we were a farmer and his wife or something like that. That's in our back yard.\nAnd the background is simply my mother's bedspreads hung up there with clothespins \u2014 to\nkeep out all the rest of the back yard. And that's my sister and me, Friedl and Gerda Schild.\nMy grandmother Sophie Jochsberger \u2014 a very dear woman. She looms large in my memory \u2014\nalways kind \u2014 always time for me. A very sweet person.",
        "A: She died, thank God, she still died a normal death with her daughter in Regensburg, the one\nwe saw before. And she's buried in Regensburg. It was 19\u2014 about \u2014 no, later than that \u2014\nabout 1939, before the transportations. Oh, another picture from my happy youth, also in our\nback yard, the smokestack between Friedl and me is where my father smoked all the\nsausages, and on my left shoulder there, that's my father's grinding stone. He sharpened up\n95\nSongs (Hebrew)\nhis butcher knives there. I can still see that, and that's really the chicken yard right there \u2014 the\nchicken house \u2014 in back of the grindstone \u2014 and my mother's laundry hanging there \u2014 and\nFriedl and I just hanging out, as they would say now... Just being happy. Too bad she had to\n\u2014 she couldn't have a life. That's a much photographed back yard, I'm telling you. You can\nsee a typical Fachwerkhaus\u2019\u2019 house in the back there. There's my father, and Friedl and I,\nand my cousin Edith, the same one that was in the picture before \u2014 a very sweet little girl.\nShe came to us for summer vacations every year, and we always were happy together. Ah,\nanother picture of my happy youth. That was an outing with the whole group. It was called\nthe JJA; the Jewish Youth Group of Ansbach. And that's Friedl, the very \u2014 the white figure\non the right hand side \u2014 on the very right. And that's me, the second from the left. There I'm\nalready a tall girl. Also, I was the younger one. I very soon was taller than Friedl as you can\nalready see here. I've already surpassed her in height, and probably also in width, and she\nnever held it against me. She was much too good-natured for that. And the rest of the gang, I\nremember them all. Very few of them are still alive, unfortunately. Friedl and I \u2014 just little\npictures that somebody snapped. I'm on the top of the frame, and she's on the bottom.",
        "A: I would say that was taken in Munich, just before we left for nurses training. It's very\npossible that those were our official pictures to get into nursing training. Ya, that's me with\nmy nurse's uniform on. I was so proud of it. It was probably the first picture I sent back when\nI got to Berlin.",
        "A: 1940, exactly. That was a picture that I had taken once I was liberated into Switzerland, and I\ntook care of that little boy. I'm still in tact with \u2014 in contact with his family. Of course he's\nnow a 50 year old man, and I took care of him for a while. That's the Jewish star I was\nattached to from September, 1941 to February 12, 1945, when I ripped it off in the train that\ntook me to Switzerland. And you can see then I didn't take care anymore of it. Up to then, I\nhad to be very careful with it. If it looked like that, if I had worn it, I could have been shot.\nBut once I ripped it off in Switzerland, I didn't care anymore what it looked like, and you can\nsee the writing on it is simulated Hebrew lettering. It's so evil.",
        "A: It was still the size of the \u2014 of the palm of your hand.\n\u00b0\u00b0 Framework house (German)",
        "A: Yes, that was my Theresienstadt box. That was given to me on my birthday by one of my\nfriends who worked in \u2014 who probably worked in a woodcarving factory or something. It\nhad a cover at one time, which I have long lost. It's made of wood, and lined with some\npaper, and on the back of it, it says, \"Ghetto Theresienstadt,\" and the date of my birth \u2014 \"23rd\nof November, 19\u2014\" well, that was in \u201843 \u2014 23rd of November is my birthday, and it was\ngiven to me on my 21st birthday \u2014 1943. I was born in 22. And that was my birthday gift,\nand I treasured it ever since.",
        "A: I think so. I'm not altogether sure anymore who gave it to me. I think it was Jirca. He was my\nmost fervent, and I think my sole admirer in Theresienstadt. He swore that as soon as he\nwould come back from the Osttransport he would find me, and then he wanted to marry me,\nbut I think deep down we both knew that he would never come back. Now what you're\nseeing here is my permission to be a nurse in the Ghetto of Theresienstadt. It says here,\n\"Gerda Schild,\" and there is my ghetto number \u2014 the name meant nothing, the number was\neverything \u2014 and Ubikation, that meant where I lived. I was in C-3. That was still in the\nHamburger Kaserne, and it says here that I can now work as a nurse, and am permitted to\nwear a uniform, and it was signed by Erich Munk \u2014 he was the health officer there \u2014 and\ndated as well. And my place of work was going to be Q 721. That was later renamed\nBergstrasse seven.",
        "A: Q and L. Originally the whole Theresienstadt was divided into Q streets which went one\nway, and L... Q meant queer \u2014 Queer and Long \u2014 and the others were longitude \u2014 Longitude\nand Queer, and Q and L, that was all there was. But then when the Commission came,\nsuddenly there appeared beautifully decorated little wooden signs on each street with fancy\nnames \u2014 Bergstrasse and Wiesenstrasse(ph), and what have you, and Q was 7 \u2014 was then\nBergstrasse 7. And this is my permission to go into the Swiss transport with my number\n1,174 on the right hand corner, and it tells me not to bring any ugly bedrolls \u2014 just to bring a\nneat suitcase and be gone. Oh, that's finally a picture of my family. I defied Hitler and started\na family and brought new Jews into the world. My husband and I, and those are my four\nchildren. Polly was probably \u2014 12 then. She's the one that later married Jean. And that's\nLen\u2019\u2019 who's now in Utah, and Hedy, \u00b0 who is in Minneapolis \u2014 She's the reason we moved\nthere, and that's David\u201d who just had a baby here in Washington.
