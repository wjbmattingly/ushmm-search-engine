Because it wasn\u2019t -- it -- it still was not -- you couldn\u2019t\ngo as aci-civil person you couldn\u2019t go to any different country. And we had to go to\na different country. So our husbands went and they got our parents.",
        "Q: Okay, let me ask you about your husband. How did you meet him and what were\nthe circumstances?",
        "A: My husband I met when my sister married her husband. He was the best man. He\nwas a very, very nice gu-guy, and when I met him, my brother-in-law said, you can\nask him if you want to ride the horse. He can get it for you. And he was 10 years\nolder than me and he just put his hands on my cheek and he said, oh you are a nice\nlittle girl. I had braids and I really looked like a little girl in comparing to him. And\nanyway, that\u2019s how I met him, and then, in th -- when my sister got married and all,\nonce he sent my brother-in-law and my sister away and he came to visit me. I was in\nthe Czech army. Every officer had a spoika. A spoika means a helper, and I was\nleft in the place with a spoika. And when my late husband came to visit me, he told\nthe spoika that he cou -- has off. And he wanted to kiss me and I wouldn\u2019t allow\nhim, I really hit him, you know? And then he didn\u2019t come any more and then he\nJanuary 16, 2002\nwanted to marry me. And when we went -- it was after the war and when we went to\nget married, I couldn\u2019t because I was too young. So we didn\u2019t get married. But then\nhe was transferred to a place and he became them -- their -- he -- he was -- I -- I\ndon\u2019t really know how you say it in English. He was a biggest man the army had in\nthat town. And that was the town where was a German -- lot of Germans lived, and\nthey were transported away, to go back to Germany. And this is where -- where we\ncame, and he was the big shot there. We have number one, that we was the first ones\nto get married in that little town and nobody gave us a hard time. I had -- of course,\nI had to get -- what do you call it, somebody to take care of me because I didn't have\nmy -- my parents, and my sister couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t have done it. You know, you\nhave to have a -- |-like your father, you know, who would give you permission. And\nmy late husband had an uncle and gave me permission and we got married there, in\nthat little town. This was Freiwaldau in -- in -- in the czechoslo -- in\nCzechoslovakia. And that -- that happened only on August 28, 1945. The -- first we\nwanted to get married in June, when I turned 17, but we couldn\u2019t. So then when he\ngot transferred and all, and then, you know, when he got there he had us come and\nwe got married.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Robert Kauder, R-o-b-e-r-t K-a-u-d-e-r.\nJanuary 16, 2002",
        "Q: So all in all, how long did you know him before you married him?",
        "A: I knew him from March until I married him, until I -- I married him in August.\nYou see, you have to understand. When they came back, there was no Jewish girls,\nyou know, there were no Jews when they came back. He had an aunt there and that -\n- that\u2019s a whole story in itself you -- you know, she was at home and her husband\nwas in -- in Theresienstadt. He was in the camp the whole time, and he came back.\nBut when he went to see his aunt, he found out that his mother and his sister were\ntaken to Auschwitz and that -- that they died. And he was extremely sad. And then\nhe wanted to get married, when he found out that he doesn\u2019t have anybody. And\nthere really -- there really was nobody, we were -- it was very easy, really, to get\nmarried tha-that time, you know, I mean, it -- you didn\u2019t have anybody, like we\ndidn\u2019t have our parent, and I married him. I didn\u2019t know that my parents are alive.\nEven so, the war was over in May. We still had no idea until -- I was married\nalready to him when we found out where they are. That was through the Red Cross,\ncause we had no idea where my -- we didn\u2019t have any idea if our -- my parents are\nalive. And we did not find them where we left them, we found them in Bukarin,\nwhich is a capital of Romania and we left them in the Bukovina, completely\ndifferent place. But my uncle -- my father had three brothers in the United States\nand only one really cared to si -- send letters and checking if we are alive. And the\nJanuary 16, 2002\nfirst one they found was me, and I got a letter and there was 25 dollars in it. And\nthen my sister, I think got it, and then somehow we got to know that our parents are\nin Romania, and then when our husbands went to get. That must have been\nsomeplace either end of \u201945, or beginning of \u201946 because it was cold outside when\nthey came. But I -- I don\u2019t know the exact date when they came, I really can\u2019t\nremember. But I know I was married and I got married on August, like I said, 28,\n1945. So they weren't there. When they came, I was married, you know, so it could\nhave been end of the \u201945 or beginning of \u201946, I really don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: At the age of 17, did you feel you were ready for marriage?",
        "A: I had no idea what marriage 1s. I had absolutely no idea. I remember what I -- I\ndidn\u2019t have anything, and my late husband, a-and -- it was hard, you know, to buy\nsomething, and he wanted to make a me a dowry. And all I wanted was a -- a\nnightgown from flannel, because I never, ever wore a -- a nightgown. So I thought\nthat\u2019s what I need is a big, long nightgown. That\u2019s what I want. And he did ge -- get\n-- you -- you know, a dowry for me, because I didn\u2019t have anything, nothing. I\ndidn\u2019t have nothing, just what I wore. And go -- he got me whatever, and my -- my\nbrother-in-law got some lace and his sister, who came back from Auschwitz, she\nwas actually an -- you know, she used to make clothes. And she didn\u2019t have a\nmachine or anything. And she made me a gown for my wedding. It 1s a short gown.\nJanuary 16, 2002\nIt was a short -- wasn\u2019t enough material. And I don\u2019t think I -- I -- I don\u2019t know, I\ndon\u2019t feel I have -- I don\u2019t have a picture here, but it\u2019s very funny the way -- it looks\nnice. It\u2019s -- it was nice. It was really ve-very nice.",
        "Q: You mentioned a few moments ago that your husband was the -- the big boss in -",
        "A: The big boss, yeah, in -- in Freiwaldau, in Grafenberg-Freiwaldau it was\ncalled, where we were. Freiwaldau was the city and Grafenberg was a -- 1-it was\nthere an institution for people who have troubles with their brains. It was at\nGrafenberg. And we lived actually on the way up Grafenberg. We had a beautiful\nhouse, but we -- we -- 1-1t was a beautiful, beautiful house, and we lived there. And\nin 1997 I went with my granddaughter to see the place, I went back. And there lived\n-- there lived some people. And I said -- it was raining outside, and I have there a\ncousin and she took us. And when I rang the bell I said, I used to live here. He said,\nyou couldn\u2019t have lived here. Here lived a young girl who is a chief of the army. I\nsaid, that was me. And he let us go in. Was nice. It was really nice. I had my\ngranddaughter. Was very nice to go back.",
        "Q: Do you remember your husband\u2019s military rank?",
        "A: It -- here it was a -- a -- a captain or a -- a -- a major. I think he got the major\nafter, I don\u2019t really remember. I don\u2019t remember. It was not [indecipherable] he\nJanuary 16, 2002\nwas not -- I think he got -- he was a major. He was a captain when I met him, and I\nthink then he got -- he got a major. I\u2019m not hundred percent, I think that\u2019s what\nhappened.",
        "Q: When you got married and lived in this house that your remember so fondly --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: -- how were you treated by the -- by your neighbors?",
        "A: You know, I did not associate, actually, with the neighbors, only with the\nmilitary. And we -- but what we did have was a maid. And she was a Czech and she\nwas nice. I had no problem, and her husband did in the garden. We had a beautiful\ngarden with the pool and everything was very nice, very, very nice. I had no -- no\nproblems really. A matter of fact I had a lot of fun because when the -- when one of\nthe soldiers would come to us with something for my husband, and if I would go to\nthe door, if I would open the door, they always wanted to make a date with me,\nbecause I still had the braids, I still didn\u2019t cut my braids, and they didn\u2019t think that --\nthat I am the wife of -- of the -- of the velitel. Velitel, I don\u2019t know how you say it.\nYeah, the big shot, whatever. It was very nice. Very nice life there, very nice.",
        "Q: And what exactly were his duties and responsibilities?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know exactly his duties, but they were -- they -- they had to get rid\nof the Germans, which y-you know, take me away from there. It was the\nJanuary 16, 2002\nSudetenland where we were, you know, traveled over the Sudetenland. He did\nthat, and whatever else he had to do. I-I really never -- I never discussed it. I never\ndiscussed it. I -- what -- what we did first, before we did anything was we were\ntrying to -- we went to Freiwaldau and we also were trying to think that I will go\nback to school, because I didn\u2019t finish school. But then they told me that I won\u2019t\nhave any children. I didn't know if I could or I couldn\u2019t, I mean I had no idea. And\nwhen I heard no children, how could I be without no children, I always wanted 12.\nSo I went from one doctor to another, and that was when I was already -- when I\nwas in school already when I found out. And I started to go to medical school. I had\nno problems. I took a test and I started to go. But then there was one time, the first\ntime where we had an autopsy. It was a newborn baby, and when they took the\n[indecipherable] they cut the head, I started to m-move around a little, and\nprofessor said, Miss Kauder, will you please stand up straight? And I couldn\u2019t,\nbecause I wa-wa-was already crying when I w -- w-when I just tried to stand up.\nAnd he said, are you a -- a -- what do you say, a -- acry -- an hysterical woman, or -\n- or what -- wh-what\u2019s wrong with you? I said, I\u2019m a mother. I was pregnant\nalready. And then I did -- the first semester was over, and I didn\u2019t go then back.\nAlso my husband got sick and I didn\u2019t go back to school. But I was --\nJanuary 16, 2002",
        "Q: Why did you think you couldn\u2019t have children?",
        "A: I didn't know. It was the first time I went to a doctor, I had some problems. You\nknow, 1-1-1 -- I just had some problems and my husband wanted me to go, so I went.\nAnd we didn\u2019t want to have any children. We had no problems with having children\nor not having. We didn\u2019t -- because we said, first Il finish school and then we\u2019ll\nhave a family. But when they said I can\u2019t have any children, I don\u2019t have to worry\nabout that, I th -- to me that was a very big worry. I -- and I went from town to town\nuntil I got a very old doctor and he said, you are so young. He says, the only time\nyou can have it is now. And that was true because then I had -- after my daughter\nwas born, I had a -- two miscarriages, then I had my son. It\u2019s almost six years\ndifferent between my daughter and my son. And when I had my son it was really\nvery -- they told me that the only way I can have him, if I am going to lie quietly\nuntil I feel him, and then, you know, I could get up. And the doctor who knew me,\nh-he says, you know, you can do that. I said, of course I can do that. And I did it. I\ndidn\u2019t move until I felt him, and I had him.",
        "Q: You also mention that your husband was having health problems.",
        "A: My husband got the -- was wounded in 1944 at Dukla, that was in Russia. And\nwhen he was -- when he was -- it was so sad, his whole -- his whole wounding was a\nvery sad thing. They had what they called spoika, which meant that a soldier had to\nJanuary 16, 2002\ngo and tell another soldier that something is not right, you have to be careful. And\nthe soldier who was to go was Max Weiss. And he couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t, he -- he\njust collapsed. And the officer who was surrounded, wherever he was, was my late\nhusband\u2019s best friend. So he started to go, but he didn\u2019t have to go, he was the\nadjutant to Swoboda. He didn\u2019t have to go nowhere, and they said, don\u2019t go. You\nknow, the general told him, don\u2019t go. And he d -- he saw that yo-you know, Max\nWeiss couldn\u2019t go, he completely collapsed. So he run and when he ran, they say,\ncrawl. H-He was very tall, he says, you crawl. They -- when they ho-hollered at him\nand he -- he started to crawl, fell in -- in the -- in the bunker where his friend was\nand all, and he did tell them what happened. But then they didn\u2019t have any x-ray and\nwhat they looked was that he was wounded in the kidney. But the kidney wasn\u2019t\ntouched, it looked fine. So they just sewed him up. And that was in *44, and in \u00b046\nhe started to have problem, and he had terrible problems til the day he died. He had\neight operations. He had -- they didn\u2019t have at that time like now, you know, that\nthey can give you -- I forgot what it\u2019s called. He had artificial kidney and it didn\u2019t\nhelp. And he finally, you know, died only -- it was in 1957. It was a terrible, terrible\ntime. But he was good. He went in the hospital, he was in the hospital a month or\nwhatever. Came home, the first thing he did is made -- made ar-arrangements and\nwe went to the -- to a show, or whatever. Never, every complained. Never\nJanuary 16, 2002\ncomplained that he had to be in the hospital, that it -- at one time he had to have,\nyou know, to wear a thing, and nothing bothered him. But he couldn\u2019t make it. I\nalways said to the doctor. You just do what you can do, he\u2019Il do what he can do.\nAnd they couldn\u2019t -- they -- they just couldn\u2019t. He was -- one time -- my son,\nunfortunately inherited what my husband had -- had. And he was a year old when he\nwas taken to the hospital, and he had two stones. And he was breastfed. He was 13\nmonths old and then, six months later, he was taken again and they had to enlarge\nhim the passage from the kidney to the bladder. And the operation was taking about\nfour and a half hour. It was a very, very big operation. And he still has to go for --\nyou know, and he was, in 1949 -- \u201989, I was very ill and he had to go to the hospital\ntoo, he had problems. My son.",
        "Q: [ma little confused about something. Did your husband die as a result of this --\nof being wounded, or did he have another medical condition, or was it a\ncombination?",
        "A: No, he died of -- of his wounding. When they opened the -- the kidney, you\nknow, that happened in 1947, when they opened it. In \u201946 he started to have\nproblem, and when the couldn\u2019t find anything and they couldn\u2019t see anything, they\nopened him and the kidney was a piece of pus. And the other kidney was already\nattack, unfortunately. If they would have taken out the kidney in Russia when he\nJanuary 16, 2002\nwas wounded, nothing would have happened. He lived -- we -- I also live with one\nkidney. He could have lived the longest time for -- with one kidney. I wanted to give\nhim my kidney. I didn\u2019t know that I -- eventually I myself had kidney problems and\nI lost a kidney, I didn\u2019t know it then. But then I wanted to give him the kidney -- in\nFrance they had just made -- had a ki -- a case with twins, they gave from one twin\nto the other, and they didn\u2019t make it. And they wouldn\u2019t do it because at that point,\nyou know, I had already my daughter, I didn\u2019t have my son yet, but they would not\ndo that, they would not take my kidney and give it to him. And they couldn\u2019t do it --\nthey didn\u2019t do it because the only case they had was at that time in -- in France and\nit didn\u2019t work. What they didn't have is the -- what do you call -- I -- I can\u2019t\nremember. I?ll remember maybe in the course of th -- I will tell you what it\u2019s called.\nWhat -- his -- his case was called -- he had cystenuria. That -- that what this stones\nwere, cysten stones. But that was caused. They could -- they also didn\u2019t have any\nrelatives of his to check if, let\u2019s say there was something in the family, but they\ndon\u2019t know about anything. So they only -- they -- their case is that he died from the\nwounding.",

        "A: You know, I -- I was thinking about it. I really don\u2019t know if they knew. There\nwas no -- in that little town, there was no temple or anything, and you couldn\u2019t\nreally do there anything. Whatever you did, you did in the house. I mean, the -- the\nmaid could have known, but I -- I don\u2019t know. I really have no idea. I do -- I really\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Were there other Jews in the town?",
        "A: No. There were no -- except my aunt. We -- we took my aunt and my uncle,\nbecause my uncle, like I said, he was in -- in the camp, he came back to on -- that\nwas not -- they were living in Ostrow, not where we lived. So my husband took\nthem to Freiwaldau and he kept them there. But they -- he wasn\u2019t Jewish, her -- her\nhusband, she was the one who was Jewish.

And we lived on a hill up, and it\u2019s a -- we heard the car coming.\nAnd our -- our top was like a -- ju-just a plain top and we saw the car way down. So\nI started to run down and I ran three steps I took at once and my sister went slower.\nAnd I was there before my sister. And when the car didn\u2019t even stop when my father\ncame out.

Either \u201948 or\n\"49, because they were looking for it -- the reason my parents had to leave, my sister\nhad left. But my parents had to leave because they were looking for a German baron\nJanuary 16, 2002\nand he looked like my father, and my father, who knew the policeman who came to\nus, he says, you know me. He says, you know my -- my parents. You -- you know\nme, I\u2019m not from no baron. He says, all I have to do is take my pants down. He said\nnot with the Russians, you don\u2019t. He said, because some, you know, had it done too,\nyou know to -- so my -- they gave my father a diplomatic passport and he left for\nVienna. And five weeks later he died. And when he died he had the same thing\nwhich he -- which he had two times before. Once when he left our little town, first --\nhe had the first heart attack. Then he had one in Prague where I came.

He says, you know cannot say -- how can you take anybody else if your\nparents are alive? You know, I had a formant -- what -- what do you c -- I -- I don\u2019t\nJanuary 16, 2002\nknow what you call it, formant, you know, somebody who talks for me. But you\nhad to -- probably you had to say. I -- I didn\u2019t fill out any papers, my husband did. I\ndon\u2019t know what he said there, that I don\u2019t have my parents. They had to be dead,\nyou had to have -- and my father was a lawyer. He says, you know, I -- I\u2019Il have that\ndone in no time. But he loved my husband, but -- and I said, but I don\u2019t want it. I\nreally don\u2019t want it, and anyway he didn\u2019t do it. But then he w -- he -- he did one\nthing, which was so nice, when he, for me when I was 18, he aw -- w-went to court\nand he initiated the case that they should forgive me my age and give me -- because\nwe had still ta -- we got food on ration, because there was not food. And I got\nchildren\u2019s ration. I had already a daughter, I was breastfeeding. So -- and I couldn't\ngo with them anywhere for drink or anything. When they went I had to stay out\n[indecipherable] outside. So he -- he did that. I have that document.",
        "Q: When did you realize the full extent of the genocide?",
        "A: I -- I really realized that, I think very early, my sister and I. We never talked to\nour parents what we went through.

Neither does my\nsister, we never, ever talked about it. I think we all knew what happened. We all\nknew exactly what happened and we didn\u2019t want to talk about it. We just didn\u2019t. We\nJanuary 16, 2002\njust tried hard to make life as possible like other people. It wasn\u2019t easy, you know,\nit\u2019s very, very hard. And e-even when you ask me when I was 17 if I knew what the\nmarriage was, I had no idea what the marriage was, absolutely none. And we just\nwanted to be loved. And we tried to make life as best as we knew how. But I never\ntalked to my parents about it, never, and neither did my sister. Neither did they ca --\ntalk to us about it at all. And I know it was only because we knew what happened. I\nmean, at that point of course we knew what happened.",
        "Q: How did you know what had happened?",
        "A: From -- from what I went through, I -- I knew that. I -- I mean I knew what --\nwhat went on all along. I mean, I was there, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t -- if I would have\nbeen hidden or something they wouldn\u2019t have known, but I was exposed to it, and I\n-- so I knew it.",

        "A: After the war was over, yes, I remember too, was -- I heard that some people\nwho came back and they didn\u2019t find anybody, they committed suicide. And yeah, it\nw -- it was a terrible thing. It\u2019s -- yeah, I heard some people, you know they -- they\nJanuary 16, 2002\ncommit, you know, was -- it was a terrible thing. It was awful, I remember. Some of\nthe -- yeah, my father came in \u00b046, because in \u201946 was the first time we had\nPassover in our house, and the soldiers which work with my -- they -- they were\nofficers, you know, were in the same thing with my husband. They all came to our\nhouse, because we were the only ones who had parents. And my father was, of\ncourse, in -- in charge of the Passover. We -- he really -- och, tha-that was -- we\nhave two people who were with -- with us when my father conducted the Passover,\nand th-they are in New York. That was so nice, that was so nice, my father\nconducted -- that was in -- in \u00b046. Oh, that was such a nice Passover. Was very, very\nnice, and we had -- 1-1t was -- I don\u2019t even remember how many people were there,\nbut there were all, you know, his friends and all, they all came to us. He was the\nonly one who could make a Passover.",

I-I -- I really don\u2019t remember how many there were, but there were a -- there\nwere a lot, and they were talking about it for years to come and today if you talk to\nJanuary 16, 2002\nhim, he w -- he will tell you, you know, he was at -- for Passover, you know, at\nNeuman\u2019s house.",
        "Q: You were one of the few to have parents that come back. And you mention that\nyou did not speak about the war --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- with your parents. But did your parents offer you any guidance or any words\nof wisdom to help you rebuild life after the war?",
        "A: I -- I think, you know in their -- th-th-they were extremely loving and giving\npeople. And they gave you a lot without even you realizing. Th-They did help you,\nwithout you being aware of it, because I remember things, you know, where --\nwhere they would -- li-like for example, I remember when my daughter, she\nwouldn\u2019t eat at all. And I would sit there and sit and everything would fly. I would\nbake all kinds of things and she wouldn\u2019t eat -- she would put it in one cheek and\nthe other cheek. And when I hold her nose she spit it out. And I was sitting there and\nsitting and in one time, you know, when she spit it out, I just slapped her, you know,\non the face. And my father went white. I mean, he went white. I have never seen\nhim like that, and he walked away. And then later on he took me aside and he says,\nwhere did you ever see touching a child? I said, but she doesn\u2019t -- she doesn\u2019t\nswallow. And my father, you know, had a very long talk with me. And then the\nJanuary 16, 2002\nother long talk we had was when he realized that I did not speak German to my\nmother. And my mother, unfortunately didn\u2019t speak much Czech, she was not Czech\nand we never spoke Czech in the house, we always spoke German. And he sat me\nand my sister down and he had a talk with us. And he says, you can\u2019t be the way\nyou are. Why don\u2019t you speak with your mother the way you always spoke? And I\nsaid, I have nothing what to say in -- with my father I could speak Czech, because\nhe spoke Czech very well, too. And I said, m -- I -- I don\u2019t have anything to say in\nGerman, what -- why should I speak German? I don\u2019t want to speak German. He\nsaid, why don\u2019t you want to speak German? I said, because I don\u2019t like the\nlanguage. He said, what did the language do to you? I said, I don\u2019t want to talk\nabout it. He said, but I want to talk about it. I said, I don\u2019t. He said, do you realize\nthat if you hate, then Hitler won the war? He says, you can\u2019t do that. The language\ndidn\u2019t do anything to you. And he talked to us. My sister was always smarter than I,\nshe was also older, and she got it before I got it. And one time I was very bad,\nbecause he wouldn\u2019t let loose. My sister wasn\u2019t like me, she also spoke to my\nmother. And I g -- I just got up and left. And my mother immediately came to me\nand says, would you please go back and apologize? I said no. She said, will you go\nback and apologize? And I did go back and apologize, and I did si -- it took me\nawhile, and I started to speak to my mother in German. And it -- th-that was the\nJanuary 16, 2002\nonly time that we spoke about the war, and my father made sure that I have no hate\nin my heart, and I still don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what it is to really hate. I don\u2019t hate\nanybody. I never did and I can\u2019t hate. I don\u2019t like what happened. I am not, you\nknow, the person who can forgive anything. I\u2019m not such a big person, I don\u2019t like\nwhat happened. But I don\u2019t hate. And I tried to prove it to my father, too. He wasn\u2019t\nhere any more, and I st -- always try to do the right thing. I have always tried -- the\nfirst time that I came across a German girl in the school, I -- I did everything I had\nto do for her. And then she invited me to go to her wedding, and I went. But I said,\nDaddy, I\u2019m doing this for you, and anyway -- it wa -- they -- they were both very,\nvery loving, my parents. They were su -- such nice, easy people to get along with.\nVery, very nice people, very loving, very loving. That was very nice. Where am I\nnow\u201d? Where was I really when I told you?",
        "Q: In addition to the advice that your parents gave you after the war, did your\nparents -- you mentioned something about going back to school.",
        "A: Yeah, that --",
        "Q: Tell me where, exactly, you went back to school.",
        "A: I went back to school in Prague, because that was, you know, we left Prague, I\nthink it was in December or whenever, whenever he was -- he -- he was already in\nFreiwaldau, we got married in Freiwaldau, but I was still -- you know, I was with\nJanuary 16, 2002\nhim, and we -- I had -- just I took the test, you know. And the end -- the -- it started\nin September, started to school. And I went to school in Prague and I went to\nschool, you know, I continued. I was with my sister, she was in -- in Prague, I was\nwith her. And I went through the first -- the first part, and then I didn\u2019t go. And the\nprofessor I took where -- I mean, I took [indecipherable] I had, he came once to\nPrague -- to New York. A neighbor of ours was waiting for a niece who came from\nPrague, she was my friend. And he never knew her, he knew her as a little girl. And\nshe came with her husband and her son. And he wanted me to go with him if I\nwould recogni -- of course I recognized him. So I went with him and as we were\nstanding upstairs and the people go out -- come out, you know after they go through\nthe -- the -- wh-whatever they have to go when they come from a --",
        "Q: Customs?",
        "A: Customs. So I said, here she is. And right behind her was a man with a -- wi -- li-\nlike a moustache, and I look and I -- I know the guy. I mean, I know him. He 1s a\nprofessor I had years ago. So I was waiting, and when she came out her uncle went\nt-to her and my aunt was there and all. And I went over to the guy and I asked him\nin Czech if he 1s Czech. He says, of course I am, he says, how do you know? I says,\nI\u2019m your pupil. He said, I can\u2019t believe it. And then, you know, he -- slowly he\nremembered me and he went to Chicago. And I said, could you come and stay with\nJanuary 16, 2002\nus after you are finished? He went to a lecture. He said, I would love to, but I have\nno money. I said, doesn\u2019t matter, I says, I'll give you some money and you\u2019ll come\nand stay with us. And he came and he stayed with us. He was in my house and I was\nalready married to my husband, but my husband didn\u2019t have a job yet, you know,\nthat\u2019s a long story. Anyway --",
        "Q: This is with a different husband --",
        "A: It\u2019s a different --",
        "Q: -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re jumping a little bit ahead of you.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you want to stay in Czechoslovakia after the war?",
        "A: I had no choice, because my husband was very ill. I could not have gone\nanywhere. Because also what I didn\u2019t tell you, in -- in December of \u201944 --\n\"45, a cousin of my late husband came to Freiwaldau where we were, and he\nwanted to take ma -- he had every documents for my husband to go to the United\nStates. And at that time he wasn\u2019t ill yet. And my husband said he won\u2019t go, he\nwon\u2019t leave me. He says, you don\u2019t have to leave her. We\u2019ll -- we -- you\u2019Il divorce\nher and I\u2019m going to marry her, or my chauffeur is going to marry her, just you\nknow, for formal. And we go to -- they were in, I think in Belgium they were\nstationed. And my husband said, I am not going to divorce her and nobody is going\nJanuary 16, 2002\nto marry her but me. And he wouldn\u2019t go. And he didn\u2019t go. I would have liked to\ngo out. My sister left, my parents left. I was the only one I-left there.",
        "Q: You told me how your father left and went. What about your sister, when did she\nleave, an-and under what circumstances?",
        "A: My sister -- my -- my brother-in-law actually deserted the army, he was in the\narmy and he just left to Israel to help with the Haganah. And of course that\u2019s also\nanother story. When he came to Israel they wouldn\u2019t take him. He was 15 years\nolder than my sister, he was 38 or 39 when he came there and he didn\u2019t speak any\nHebrew. And he had a very hard time learning a language. He was from\nCzechoslovakia from the mountains, and he spoke Hungarian and Czech. We never\nspoke Hungarian, we were not from that part. And he couldn\u2019t learn right away the\nHebrew, so he had also problems in -- in Israel. What -- they left right when --\nwhen the communist came, because the o -- the other reason they le -- he left also\nwas that a lot of Jewish officers were killed right after the communists took over.\nNot only Jewish, but some were Jewish, you see, quite a few. Was right in there and\no-other, you know -- then Morovitz was there who was killed, he was married to a\nJewish lady who was pregnant when she -- when he got killed. It was terrible,\nbecause Swoboda did not go with -- with -- with the communists, he didn\u2019t do\nanything to help them, and the army didn\u2019t want to go. The army was already, I\nJanuary 16, 2002\nmean they could have taken them on. They were still in -- in gear. But they was -- so\neverybody who could, left. Because the officers who left didn\u2019t have no permission,\nthey didn\u2019t leave from the army, they just left. You know, not legally.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure I understood all that you just said. When the communists came --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- some of the Czech officers were -- were killed.",
        "A: All the [indecipherable] were killed. Some of the Czech officers were killed.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Why? They said they are against th-the prolat -- proletariat. They are against the\nRussians, or whatever, to -- you know, whatever they had -- whatever reason they\nhad, they -- they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t like them and they killed them. It was, you\nknow, they always -- they had a reason, you know, they said they were against -- I\nmean, it -- 1t was absolutely insane, what they did. Absolutely. I mean, these were\nall officers which were in Russia and fought with the Russians. And they were not\ncommunists, they said. Now, not all were, but I mean they -- it -- it was a terrible\ntime for us. A terrible time. My -- my husband was at that time already sick. So they\nwere, wh-what are we going to do with him, you know. They didn\u2019t expect him to\nstay alive as long as he did, you know, they didn\u2019t. So that was one of the reasons\nthey didn\u2019t do anything for him.\nJanuary 16, 2002",
        "Q: How did your life change, aside from your husband being sick, but when the\ncommunists came, how did that change your life, yours and your husbands?",
        "A: It-It changed a lot. My husband had to leave the army, because he also was sick,\nyou know, a lot. Then he had a very big problem getting a job. And finally he got a\njob. But you see, when he was -- when he got the job, he was not a communist, you\nknow, because a lot of them were in the, you know, a lot of them were really, you\nknow, communist wi -- and he was not. And there were others who were killed who\nalso were not, you know, communists. They were not really -- really communists.\nAnd they took him there and he had -- they asked him how come he doesn\u2019t read the\nRuda Pravel. And he said he was wounded, he can\u2019t hold the paper, it\u2019s too big to\nhold. And anyway, he didn\u2019t make to enter, so they always gave him a\npostponement. And then finally he got a job in Kovo -- th-that was in -- in a job\nwhich had to do with -- th-the -- the -- it has to -- had to do with other p-places, you\nknow, you had to go to Bulgaria or whatever, you know, in -- in the -- in the area of\nthe Russian things, he had to travel there, too. So he was -- he was working until he\ndied in that job, kovo, it was called.",
        "Q: What exactly was that?",
        "A: Kovo -- kovo is not a -- a name of anything, you know, it\u2019s not that I can tell you\nit was kava or -- I mean, coffee or anything. It was a sort -- a sort of something, you\nJanuary 16, 2002\nknow. I-It wa -- it was the import and export of a -- or tha-that\u2019s what it was, it was\nthe import and export of some foods. And you know, wherever there was, you\nknow, the most of the food went to -- to Russia. And whatever you could, you have\nfor the -- for the Czechs, you know, and you went also -- he went to Bulgaria -- to\nBulgaria he went. And then he had to go to Germany for -- for being a -- what do\nyou call it, a witness, you know, so -- so he went to Germany. And then he had to\ngo -- th-they also asked him if he would go to America. He said no, why would he\ngo to America? They said, you have a mother-in-law there. Course my mother,\nthat\u2019s ano -- another story. My mother ended up in the United States after my sister\nalready left Israel, she came there too. And he said he would never take his mother-\nin-law instead of his wife. He liked his wife. He was bad, he really was bad. But he\nwas so wounded they didn\u2019t -- you know, he was every year at least two months in\nthe hospital.",
        "Q: You mentioned he was called to Germany to testify. Would you explain that?",
        "A: Yeah. He wa -- he was called to Germany to testify to be a witness for -- 1-1t was\nfor Nuremberg. For Nuremberg he was called.",

        "Q: Did he actually testify or was he just there in case they needed him to testify?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know if he testified or he\nwas jus -- he was there in that whole thing when it was, but if he testified I don\u2019t\nknow. I have no idea. I --",

        "A: You see, I had there lots of friends. I really didn\u2019t have any relatives. This one\nrelatives which we had in [indecipherable] my uncle came, my aunt never came.\nAnd one of the cousins, there were four children, one came. And I had a ver -- like a\nmother there. It was the daughter of that lady who was a friend of my late husband,\nthey went to school together. And they took us in like we were family. And she did\nmore than I ever did anything. I was very quiet. I didn\u2019t -- 1-it was a military funeral.\nI was there, but I really didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody and I didn\u2019t just\ndo anything. And they used to come to my house, you know, the doctors who were -\nJanuary 16, 2002\n- some of them -- my late husband was a medical student before he went to the war.\nAnd one of the doctors was a friend of his, they went to same medical school. And\nhe came over and they were trying to -- when I had coffee, Babi would make coffee,\nor si -- mother, you know. And he would say do -- don\u2019t you want to break the cup?\nHe says, we\u2019ll have some noise. I didn\u2019t want to do nothing. I didn\u2019t talk to them,\nnothing. They came, they left. And then one day -- and I didn\u2019t take care of the kids,\nBabi took care of the kids. Never asked about the kids. And one day I -- every day\naround five o\u2019clock I used to go for the walk, for a long walk, after my late husband\ndied. And Babi always went with me. One day when I went to the door to go, she\nsaid, I\u2019m not going with you. And if you go yourself, she says, I\u2019m going put the\nchildren in a -- in a home for -- you know, without the -- for children without\nparents. I hesitated just a second, and I left. Wa -- when I walked, I said to myself,\nshe\u2019s not my mother. She is a strange woman. She doesn\u2019t care for my children. She\nwill put my children in a home [indecipherable] from home, because she doesn\u2019t\ncare. And I went home, I didn\u2019t say anything to her and I went into my daughter\u2019s.\nMy son was only five at the time. And she cried and I cried, and it really, you know,\nbroke everything between me and my children. My son was really too -- too young\nfor it. And then the doctor came and he talked to me. I didn\u2019t talk to Babi at all, I --\nI just didn\u2019t pay attention to her. And he came and he told me that if it wasn\u2019t for\nJanuary 16, 2002\nBabi, that time when I walked out by myself, they were all around me, they didn\u2019t\nknow what [Il do, and they were ready to put me away in Freiwaldau, you know,\nwhere I told you we were? And Babi said no, let me do it one more time. And she\nhad called and she said that I went to Elise and everything 1s all right between my\ndaughter and me. But otherwise I -- I just wasn\u2019t, you know, anything. And when I\nheard that, I went to Babi and I apologized. You know, it was so bad wha -- what I\ndid to her. And then I went to work, and -- and then came the time when I -- I\nimmediately applied to go to the United States and I was told immediately that I\nwill not go, that they will not let me go. That the children from a Czech officer will\nnot be beggars on Broadway. | didn\u2019t understand what that meant, but it was\nsomething it meant. And then -- then wa -- one t -- when I got the refusal that I\u2019m\nnot going to go, I went back one time. I asked again. And the guy there said, I told\nyou, you\u2019re not going to go. He says, what do you do -- lose, a man? He says, you\ndon\u2019t look so bad, you can get a man. And I got so mad. I got so mad, and I said, if\nit wasn\u2019t for my husband, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting here, and how dare you talk to me\nlike that? And I said, and I am going to the president. And I was with my little boy,\nhe didn\u2019t go to school yet, and I went to the president. When I came there, there was\nthe soldiers and they put the bayonet, they didn\u2019t talk to me. And I said to my son, I\nsaid, you stay right here. I said, if one hair is going to be crooked on this kid, I says,\nJanuary 16, 2002\nI cut both your heads off. And I went between the guns and I went in. They didn\u2019t\ndo nothing. I -- I made one step -- I went in and there was another guy. He says, can\nI help you? I said yes, I want to speak to the president. He says, do you have an\nappointment? I said, I thought the president is for the people, and I am a people and\nI wanted to talk to him. I have a grievance and I would like to tell him. He said okay\nand he took me in, and when I walked 1n, the president walked out. I said, he\u2019s\nleaving. I was all excited. I saw him and he\u2019s leaving. And the lady says, don\u2019t\nworry, he\u2019s here. He -- she says, you just come in and we\u2019 ll talk. And I complained\nto her and all and she says, do you need more money? Because I had a pension and\nmy children had a pension because we had military, you know. And I said no, I have\nmoney enough, I -- what could I have bought? There was nothing left to buy\nanyway. I said, I just wanted to see my mother, I says, I haven\u2019t see her. We went\nthrough the war and now I\u2019m not going to see her any more if I don\u2019t go now. She\nsays, I can\u2019t promise you to get -- go to the United States, but I can give you some\nmore money. And I left and I never, ever a-asked again to go until 1t was three years\nlater I got the letter that if I want to go I have to give up my pension and everything,\nand I can go. You know, it was so unfair to take the pension away from me, but I\nhad to -- I had to sign away my pension, my -- everything I had, and I could -- I\ncould go. And then when we -- before I went I had to go to court to sign for the\nJanuary 16, 2002\nchildren. And when I was ready to sign, a woman got up and she says she has a\ngrievance. She says, how can I sign away the things for the children? I got up and I\nhad with me one of the officers who -- who was a lawyer and he said, shut up and sit\ndown. I said, who is that woman? How dare she tell me I can\u2019t sign for the children?\nWhere was she all this time? Did she go with Mike to the hospital -- you know, my\nson wa-was sick, you know. And anyway, that was -- wh-which I didn\u2019t know, but\nmy kids had s -- whatever they took out, she was the guardian for my children. So\nanyway I signed and -- and we left. But it was -- it was a terrible thing, terrible.",

Like on s -- Fifth Avenue, in Prague\n[indecipherable], it was a bookstore for books. And all I had to do is take an exam\nfor -- for books for -- children books, medical books, whatever. And for poetry and\nall that. So I took it. My daughter was an ardent reader, so the children\u2019s books I\nhave had all color. Then I had a friend, she was a lawyer, she gave me all that. And I\nmade it except poetry I wasn\u2019t very good, I -- I couldn\u2019t remember who wrote \u201cThe\nJanuary 16, 2002\nRaven\u201d from all the things.

She said she is\nnot going to leave me. She is not going to leave me, and she stayed, and I had\nproblems because of her. Because she would call to -- to -- I -- I -- she would call to\nthe office and say, you know, can she speak to her [indecipherable] that\u2019s to my\nlady. And they said, who is that? I said, that\u2019s my aunt. She said she said she wants\nto speak. I said, she\u2019s nuts, I said. She used to be a maid, I said, but now she doesn\u2019t\nknow what she\u2019s talking about. I had a good ti -- oh, it wa -- 1t was a horrible time\nunder the communists.

My brother-in-\nlaw, he shook me, he says, don\u2019t worry, no communists came with you, you can talk\nhere. I says, there is nothing what I can talk about. He says, you -- are you going\ntalk to me or aren\u2019t you? I was so scared. I was so scared you can\u2019t even imagine,\nbecause you know, there was -- there -- there was also a widow, like I was, she was\nput away in -- in a jail and they took her kids.

        "Q: You were telling me about your -- your children --",
        "A: My children, yes.",
        "Q: -- adjusting, and you mentioned a Bar Mitzvah.",
        "A: The Bar Mitzvah, my nephew was just Bar Mitzvah in January and we came\nhere in April. And he had to, of course, give up his room and be with his brother and\nmy children had the other room. And then when they went to school they went to\nthe same -- same grade. And my son also, you know, he went to the first grade. First\nor second, I don\u2019t remember what he went. I think he went to the second grade. He\nwas a -- he was coming 1n the sec -- he went to the second grade. And you know, he\n-- my nephew, the oldest -- wh-when they went to school -- I have to ge -- start --\nwhen they went to school I wanted to give my daughter money, you know, for\nlunch. And my brother-in-law said absolutely not, that\u2019s my -- my job. And he gave\nJanuary 16, 2002\neach one 50 cents or whatever. And when they came to the bus my nephew would\nsay to my daughter, you give me some money, that\u2019s my money. And she never said\nthat to me tha-that -- I her -- heard that many, many years later, that she never had\nlunch, you know, because he wou -- he would take her money, you know, I mean he\n-- he -- it -- 1t was understandable. My son was -- also had problems because he --\nhe\u2019s a year older than the other kids and I said, don\u2019t you dare touch him, you know,\ndon\u2019t -- don\u2019t do anything. And my daughter cr -- told me once, she says, you better\ntell him that he can touch him, because he is really and truly taking advantage of\nhim and you told him don\u2019t touch, and he doesn\u2019t. So I took care of that situation\ntoo. And then my brother-in-law, he a -- what happened was with our crates what\nwe took with us, one crate was broken or -- or wasn\u2019t there and tha-that was the toys\nfrom my son. And he had a train and whatever, and it was all gone. So my brother-\nin-law said all the toys should be for the little -- little kid. And his older brother said\nto him, don\u2019t you dare touch anything, that\u2019s all ours, not yours. So I didn\u2019t know\nabout that either, of course. So then one day my daughter says, why don\u2019t you ask\nMike what he\u2019s doing when he comes home from school. So I asked him, I said,\nwhat are you doing when you -- he says, I do my homework. I says, and afterward?\nHe says, I do my homework. I said, don\u2019t you go outside and play? He said, I have\nnothing left to play with, I have no toys. So anyway, so I took my nephew aside one\nJanuary 16, 2002\ntime and I told him, I said, look, I know it\u2019s not easy for you and it\u2019s not easy for us.\nI says, your parents, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re not aware of it or whatever happened. I\nsaid, but one thing I can tell you. Don\u2019t do that to my children. I said, don\u2019t do that,\nbecause you'll be sorry. Pll beat the living daylights out of you if you ever do it\nagain. It took me years before I got him out of his -- oh, he was really scared of me.\nBut I would have never done it, but -- but anyway, and my son also got better. It -- it\nwa -- it was hard for them to adjust, it really was. They had a completely different\nlife, you know, and they had also a completely different life. It was just as bad for\nthem as for my kids, you know, they -- they weren't used to that, a whole family\nmoves in. So anyway, that\u2019s how -- and then we finally got our o-own apartment\nand that was -- that took care of -- th-that -- we were good -- we had -- we had a\nreally nice apartment. It -- 1t was a bachelor\u2019s apartment, but it was nice. My s -- my\ndaughter -- I had two jobs, I worked as a technician and my daughter was the one\nwho took care of the shopping, you know, I mean, in the meantime she was already\n14, and she was already a big girl. I never had a babysitter for my children when I\nhad my own apartment, I never. But I had an apartment in the building where there\nwas a porter, you couldn\u2019t get in there. That -- that\u2019s all I wanted really. And my --\nthen we got a -- an uncle of -- of mine gave me a dog, and oh we were so happy we\nhad the dog, but I -- that -- these were apartments only for people with -- with jobs,\nJanuary 16, 2002\nwho are -- with [indecipherable] jobs. So I had a job, I had no problem, but I\ncouldn\u2019t have the kids. So I took my daughter, she was almost as tall as I, you know,\nit was fun, it was no problem. But Mikey started to cry, he wanted to come home\ntoo. So I took him too, and I had the dog too. So -- so one day he came and he said,\nwho is that, to my daughter. I said, that\u2019s my sister. He says, and who is the little\nboy? I said, my son. He said, and she\u2019s your daughter? I says yes. I says, now I have\nto tell you a secret. He says, you know it doesn\u2019t go here, he says, but one thing --\nhe was also European, he says, one thing I tell you. Your kids behave, they can stay,\nbut something has to go, either the kids or the dog. So I let the dog go. But he was\nfunny, we had -- he was funny.",
        "Q: When you came to this country, did the Americans that you met ask you about\nyour life under communism?",
        "A: Yeah, well, they ask me about communism, but that\u2019s about all. They were never\ninterested if I went through a Holocaust, and if I wanted to say something -- if I\nwanted -- you know, I didn\u2019t really want to, but if I wanted, they said they are really\nnot interested.",

        "Q: Did you know enough English to follow what was happening?\nJanuary 16, 2002",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t. I -- I -- I mean I -- I will -- I knew the English I learned in school,\nyou know, but I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: You -- basically you learned English in school?",
        "A: Of course, I -- when I finished school I went to a -- to a school, to a regular high\nschool to learn English. And at that point they wouldn\u2019t take me. They said I know\ntoo much English and I never really learned.",
        "Q: What about your children, how did they learn English?",
        "A: They learned English, you know, time -- my daughter I took a -- a -- a girl, my\nson I didn\u2019t take anything, they learned English in no time.",
        "Q: You mentioned awhile ago another husband. Can you tell me how you met your\ncurrent husband and when\u2019?",
        "A: I met my current husband in 19 sif -- seve -- 62. The way I met him is through a\nfriend who was here, actually one of the friends what I mentioned that her husband\nwas killed. She was pregnant. He was killed when the communists took over\nCzechoslovakia. She had a sister here, and her brother-in-law was a -- a doctor and\nhe got me, actually, the per -- first job. And she came to visit, they lived on Fifth\nAvenue in an apartment, one floor was their apartment. She had her own room, her\nown bathroom, everything. And she came to visit me and she wanted to stay with\nme. I had one room, one. In that one room there was a tiny little kitchen, a tiny little\nJanuary 16, 2002\nrefrigera -- everything miniature and with a curtain. And then | had there two beds\nand a couch, and my son slept on the couch and Elise and I had a bed. And we had a\ntable and chairs and that was it. There was no room really for much more to go. And\nthen, anyway, when we bought the piano we had it -- you know, when you walked\nin there was a square and that\u2019s was a piano there. We were very crowded, actually\nin the -- in our apartment. And she wanted to go to Atlantic City. And I really\ndidn\u2019t want to go. I was busy, I had two jobs. And she said you can take one\nweekend, all you do is work. I said, doesn\u2019t matter, I said, and I don\u2019t have where to\nleave the kids and I am not going. She says, your sister will be happy to take the\nchildren. I said I don\u2019t want to. And anyway, I said, you can\u2019t sleep here either. You\nhave plenty of room where you are. So she said, can\u2019t I sleep once with you here? I\nsays, yo-you know, I -- you -- you don\u2019t realize it, I\u2019m already a widow for three\nyears, I says, if I sleep with anybody, you are the last person I\u2019d like to sleep with. I\nsaid, I don\u2019t want to sleep with you. She says, sleep with your daughter and then\ngive me her bed. Anyway, I slept with my daughter, I gave her ma -- the bed, and\nthen we did go. And I-I-I was so bad th-those days, really I was so bad. I didn\u2019t have\nmoney. I would take the money and give my daughter, you know, I mean she has to\nshop and do everything. So anyway, we went, th-that\u2019s how I met my husband. We\nwent to the -- on the beach and I told her that I want to sleep, you know, that I\u2019m\nJanuary 16, 2002\nreally very tired. I didn\u2019t -- I never realized how tired I was until I really got there.\nAnd so I went to sleep, and then she woke me, she says, can you show me how you\nuse your lighter. I used to smoke. And I showed her and she says, you\u2019re so stupid, I\nhave here such a nice guy, she says, he\u2019s looking at you all the time, but you thi --\nnever look. I said -- I didn\u2019t look, or I didn't open my eyes, I just showed her how\nand I kept sleeping. And then I hear a voice, you know, in English telling me, can I\nplease, you know, ask you a question? Could -- could -- I would like to take you and\nyour friend out tonight. I says, you can take my friend out, not me, but you can take\nher out. Tell me where, I\u2019ll bring her. She didn\u2019t speak any English. She spoke a\nlittle Jewish and he speaks a little Jewish and so they got along. So he gave me his\naddress, I said I\u2019Il bring her there and we brought her there, my friend where -- she\nhad a friend in Atlantic City, that\u2019s why we went there, I knew I won\u2019t have to pay\nhotel or anything. And when we came there we couldn\u2019t him, I mean, I didn\u2019t know\nhow he looks and she couldn\u2019t find him. Then she saw there is five dollars\nminimum. She says, can I go in? I said, no you can\u2019t. It\u2019s five dollars minimum,\nthat\u2019s not in my -- my thing to -- to spe-spend. So anyway, we went away and next\nday, Sunday when we came we saw -- I saw a guy and she said, that\u2019s him. And he\nlooked good. Boy, did he look good. He had a head of curls, you know, bl-blonde\ncurls and he was slender, you know, I -- he was really very slender and looked very\nJanuary 16, 2002\ngood. I said, I wouldn't even spit on him, I says, not -- I said he\u2019ll [indecipherable]\ncome. She says oh, don\u2019t be like that. And he came over to me and he says, you\nknow, I really and truly like you. I liked you yesterday and I like you today. I -- and\nI said, before you go any further, I want to tell you something. I says, you just met a\nwidow with two children, and that -- one of the women who have the least money in\nthe United States, that\u2019s me. And I am not interested in anybody. Not in you and\nnot in 10 like you. I said, I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not interested. So we went back, we sit down\nand then he says, will you come to my parents, my parents are here. And so I -- I\nwas sleeping and she says, come on, let\u2019s go over. I can\u2019t speak to hi -- his parents\nare from Russia and his mother really spoke some Russian, you know, and Kira\nspoke Russian, too. So we went over there and we met them. And then Monday\nwhen I came home from work the phone rang and my daughter answered the phone,\nsh -- she says, it\u2019s for you. I says who? She says a man. I said, what kind of man is\nfor me, I don\u2019t get no man calls. And I went to the phone, it was him. I said what are\n-- what do you want? I said, how did you get my number? He says Kira gave me\nyour number. So -- and then he wo -- said, can I come on the weekends? I says, you\ncan. I won\u2019t be home, but you can come. And he used to come and my son really\nfell in love with him, because he thought that ma -- it was somebody just for him,\nyou know. He was never married before. And he would come and come, I never saw\nJanuary 16, 2002\nhim, once maybe I saw him, or twice. And then a -- then I think Christmas it came,\nand then, you know, he started if I would marry him. And I said, why would I marry\nyou? I do -- I -- I really don\u2019t know you, you know, I -- I don\u2019t want to get married.\nAnd my daughter says to me, Mommy, you have to marry him. I says, why do I\nhave to marry him, I don\u2019t even love him. She says, you don\u2019t have to love him,\nMike loves him. I says, Mike loves him, let him marry him. And I got married. She\nsays I have to marry him, so I marry him. He -- I love him now. I didn\u2019t love him\nthen, but I love him now, he\u2019s a good man.",

We talked to each other. And I -- we -- we couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t really\nbelieve that we went through everything which we went through and we talked to\nour children.

        "Q: G.W. is George Washington University Hospital, is that what you\u2019re trying to\ntell me?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And so tha -- so my -- lucky for me my friend was with me, I\nworked at the [indecipherable] at that time. No, no, I -- I had just stopped; we -- we\nwere let go. But anyway, my girlfriend was there and she wanted I should go to\nMount Vernon, because | had heard that in Mount Vernon is a -- 1s a place where\nthey do the same thing like they do at -- at -- in -- here in Washington at what --\nwhat do you call? The -- the guy who was my -- my -- in college it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a\nhospital, told my husband that he called di -- W -- G du -- he called the place in\nNew York, you know, Sloan Caterer, he called the hospital in Baltimore, you\nknow, John Hopkins and the -- and here also, in Washington, and nobody would\ntake me. They couldn\u2019t take me, they were right, because I had no life left. I had less\nthan 25 percent of breathing, and there was nobody to take, you know, I -- it really\nwasn\u2019t. My girlfriend, she knew -- I had told her about Mount Vernon. What\nhappened was Dr. Rosenberg was in together with a Dr. Ayliss. And this Dr. Ayliss\nJanuary 16, 2002\nhad something with -- wi-with Rosenberg, whatever happened, it wasn\u2019t all right,\nand he got the grant in Mount Vernon and he had one floor there where he di -- did\nthe same thing they did at GW, and she wanted to take me there, and she took me\nthere.

And we went\nin, and he didn't want to take me, but he did examine me and he says he can\u2019t take\nme, you know, it\u2019s not even legal and he can\u2019t do it. So we left, my husband and I,\nand Diane, my friend, stayed there. So, it was in August and I was very, very hot,\nand I knew that I have a few hours to live. I wanted to call my children and\neverybody, my sister and you know, at least to see them. And I wanted to go home.\nAnd my husband said, I can\u2019t, you know, Diane is not here, she doesn\u2019t have a car,\nbecause she came with us. So he got out of the car to go and get her and that she\ncame out with the doctor and with the wheelchair, not to take mine and they took\nme in. And it took them three weeks to wa -- I didn\u2019t weigh enough, you know, I\nhad to weigh at least, I think 98 or a hundred pounds and I weighed like 95. And\nthey brought me up two pounds I was, I think two -- I still didn\u2019t have. And they ga\n-- put me o-on the study. And I was on the study and I was the only one left. There\nwas a lady left which came later on, she didn\u2019t have what I had, she had melanoma.\nAnd she survived, but for my tho -- who was with me, nobody survived.

Two -- two medications they\ngave me, I can\u2019t remember now what it was, but I couldn\u2019t take the one, I had a lot\nof problems with it and he took me off that and left me only on one medication.

        "A: Yeah, I was -- was -- it was a turbulent time here, too, you know, and I really and\ntruly could not take in everything the way I should have, because like I told you\nbefore, I had problems with my kids, I had problems with jobs, I had problems, and\nI really and truly could not give it as much time as I would have liked to. I just\ndidn\u2019t have it. I worked like y-you can\u2019t imagine. In my second job there I worked, I\nwas usually finished by 10 o\u2019clock and 10:20 because I worked two jobs.

They had what they called spoika, which meant that a soldier had to\nJanuary 16, 2002\ngo and tell another soldier that something is not right, you have to be careful. And\nthe soldier who was to go was Max Weiss. And he couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t, he -- he\njust collapsed. And the officer who was surrounded, wherever he was, was my late\nhusband\u2019s best friend. So he started to go, but he didn\u2019t have to go, he was the\nadjutant to Swoboda. He didn\u2019t have to go nowhere, and they said, don\u2019t go. You\nknow, the general told him, don\u2019t go. And he d -- he saw that yo-you know, Max\nWeiss couldn\u2019t go, he completely collapsed. So he run and when he ran, they say,\ncrawl. H-He was very tall, he says, you crawl. They -- when they ho-hollered at him\nand he -- he started to crawl, fell in -- in the -- in the bunker where his friend was\nand all, and he did tell them what happened. But then they didn\u2019t have any x-ray and\nwhat they looked was that he was wounded in the kidney. But the kidney wasn\u2019t\ntouched, it looked fine. So they just sewed him up. And that was in *44, and in \u00b046\nhe started to have problem, and he had terrible problems til the day he died. He had\neight operations. He had -- they didn\u2019t have at that time like now, you know, that\nthey can give you -- I forgot what it\u2019s called. He had artificial kidney and it didn\u2019t\nhelp. And he finally, you know, died only -- it was in 1957. It was a terrible, terrible\ntime. But he was good. He went in the hospital, he was in the hospital a month or\nwhatever. Came home, the first thing he did is made -- made ar-arrangements and\nwe went to the -- to a show, or whatever. Never, every complained. Never\nJanuary 16, 2002\ncomplained that he had to be in the hospital, that it -- at one time he had to have,\nyou know, to wear a thing, and nothing bothered him. But he couldn\u2019t make it.

He was -- one time -- my son,\nunfortunately inherited what my husband had -- had. And he was a year old when he\nwas taken to the hospital, and he had two stones. And he was breastfed. He was 13\nmonths old and then, six months later, he was taken again and they had to enlarge\nhim the passage from the kidney to the bladder. And the operation was taking about\nfour and a half hour. It was a very, very big operation. And he still has to go for --\nyou know, and he was, in 1949 -- \u201989, I was very ill and he had to go to the hospital\ntoo, he had problems. My son.",

In \u201946 he started to have\nproblem, and when the couldn\u2019t find anything and they couldn\u2019t see anything, they\nopened him and the kidney was a piece of pus. And the other kidney was already\nattack, unfortunately. If they would have taken out the kidney in Russia when he\nJanuary 16, 2002\nwas wounded, nothing would have happened. He lived -- we -- I also live with one\nkidney. He could have lived the longest time for -- with one kidney. I wanted to give\nhim my kidney. I didn\u2019t know that I -- eventually I myself had kidney problems and\nI lost a kidney, I didn\u2019t know it then. But then I wanted to give him the kidney -- in\nFrance they had just made -- had a ki -- a case with twins, they gave from one twin\nto the other, and they didn\u2019t make it. And they wouldn\u2019t do it because at that point,\nyou know, I had already my daughter, I didn\u2019t have my son yet, but they would not\ndo that, they would not take my kidney and give it to him.

Th-They did help you,\nwithout you being aware of it, because I remember things, you know, where --\nwhere they would -- li-like for example, I remember when my daughter, she\nwouldn\u2019t eat at all. And I would sit there and sit and everything would fly. I would\nbake all kinds of things and she wouldn\u2019t eat -- she would put it in one cheek and\nthe other cheek. And when I hold her nose she spit it out. And I was sitting there and\nsitting and in one time, you know, when she spit it out, I just slapped her, you know,\non the face. And my father went white. I mean, he went white. I have never seen\nhim like that, and he walked away. And then later on he took me aside and he says,\nwhere did you ever see touching a child? I said, but she doesn\u2019t -- she doesn\u2019t\nswallow. And my father, you know, had a very long talk with me. And then the\nJanuary 16, 2002\nother long talk we had was when he realized that I did not speak German to my\nmother. And my mother, unfortunately didn\u2019t speak much Czech, she was not Czech\nand we never spoke Czech in the house, we always spoke German. And he sat me\nand my sister down and he had a talk with us. And he says, you can\u2019t be the way\nyou are. Why don\u2019t you speak with your mother the way you always spoke? And I\nsaid, I have nothing what to say in -- with my father I could speak Czech, because\nhe spoke Czech very well, too. And I said, m -- I -- I don\u2019t have anything to say in\nGerman, what -- why should I speak German? I don\u2019t want to speak German. He\nsaid, why don\u2019t you want to speak German? I said, because I don\u2019t like the\nlanguage. He said, what did the language do to you? I said, I don\u2019t want to talk\nabout it. He said, but I want to talk about it. I said, I don\u2019t. He said, do you realize\nthat if you hate, then Hitler won the war? He says, you can\u2019t do that. The language\ndidn\u2019t do anything to you. And he talked to us. My sister was always smarter than I,\nshe was also older, and she got it before I got it. And one time I was very bad,\nbecause he wouldn\u2019t let loose. My sister wasn\u2019t like me, she also spoke to my\nmother. And I g -- I just got up and left. And my mother immediately came to me\nand says, would you please go back and apologize? I said no. She said, will you go\nback and apologize? And I did go back and apologize, and I did si -- it took me\nawhile, and I started to speak to my mother in German. And it -- th-that was the\nJanuary 16, 2002\nonly time that we spoke about the war, and my father made sure that I have no hate\nin my heart, and I still don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what it is to really hate. I don\u2019t hate\nanybody. I never did and I can\u2019t hate. I don\u2019t like what happened. I am not, you\nknow, the person who can forgive anything. I\u2019m not such a big person, I don\u2019t like\nwhat happened. But I don\u2019t hate. And I tried to prove it to my father, too. He wasn\u2019t\nhere any more, and I st -- always try to do the right thing. I have always tried -- the\nfirst time that I came across a German girl in the school, I -- I did everything I had\nto do for her. And then she invited me to go to her wedding, and I went. But I said,\nDaddy, I\u2019m doing this for you, and anyway -- it wa -- they -- they were both very,\nvery loving, my parents. They were su -- such nice, easy people to get along with.\nVery, very nice people, very loving, very loving. That was very nice. Where am I\nnow\u201d? Where was I really when I told you?",

And the\nprofessor I took where -- I mean, I took [indecipherable] I had, he came once to\nPrague -- to New York. A neighbor of ours was waiting for a niece who came from\nPrague, she was my friend. And he never knew her, he knew her as a little girl. And\nshe came with her husband and her son. And he wanted me to go with him if I\nwould recogni -- of course I recognized him.

He 1s a\nprofessor I had years ago. So I was waiting, and when she came out her uncle went\nt-to her and my aunt was there and all. And I went over to the guy and I asked him\nin Czech if he 1s Czech. He says, of course I am, he says, how do you know? I says,\nI\u2019m your pupil. He said, I can\u2019t believe it. And then, you know, he -- slowly he\nremembered me and he went to Chicago. And I said, could you come and stay with\nJanuary 16, 2002\nus after you are finished? He went to a lecture. He said, I would love to, but I have\nno money. I said, doesn\u2019t matter, I says, I'll give you some money and you\u2019ll come\nand stay with us. And he came and he stayed with us.

        "A: I had no choice, because my husband was very ill. I could not have gone\nanywhere. Because also what I didn\u2019t tell you, in -- in December of \u201944 --\n\"45, a cousin of my late husband came to Freiwaldau where we were, and he\nwanted to take ma -- he had every documents for my husband to go to the United\nStates. And at that time he wasn\u2019t ill yet. And my husband said he won\u2019t go, he\nwon\u2019t leave me. He says, you don\u2019t have to leave her. We\u2019ll -- we -- you\u2019Il divorce\nher and I\u2019m going to marry her, or my chauffeur is going to marry her, just you\nknow, for formal.

And he wouldn\u2019t go. And he didn\u2019t go. I would have liked to\ngo out. My sister left, my parents left. I was the only one I-left there.",
        "A: My sister -- my -- my brother-in-law actually deserted the army, he was in the\narmy and he just left to Israel to help with the Haganah. And of course that\u2019s also\nanother story. When he came to Israel they wouldn\u2019t take him. He was 15 years\nolder than my sister, he was 38 or 39 when he came there and he didn\u2019t speak any\nHebrew. And he had a very hard time learning a language. He was from\nCzechoslovakia from the mountains, and he spoke Hungarian and Czech. We never\nspoke Hungarian, we were not from that part. And he couldn\u2019t learn right away the\nHebrew, so he had also problems in -- in Israel. What -- they left right when --\nwhen the communist came, because the o -- the other reason they le -- he left also\nwas that a lot of Jewish officers were killed right after the communists took over.\nNot only Jewish, but some were Jewish, you see, quite a few. Was right in there and\no-other, you know -- then Morovitz was there who was killed, he was married to a\nJewish lady who was pregnant when she -- when he got killed. It was terrible,\nbecause Swoboda did not go with -- with -- with the communists, he didn\u2019t do\nanything to help them, and the army didn\u2019t want to go. The army was already, I\nJanuary 16, 2002\nmean they could have taken them on. They were still in -- in gear. But they was -- so\neverybody who could, left.

It was, you\nknow, they always -- they had a reason, you know, they said they were against -- I\nmean, it -- 1t was absolutely insane, what they did. Absolutely. I mean, these were\nall officers which were in Russia and fought with the Russians. And they were not\ncommunists, they said. Now, not all were, but I mean they -- it -- it was a terrible\ntime for us. A terrible time. My -- my husband was at that time already sick. So they\nwere, wh-what are we going to do with him, you know. They didn\u2019t expect him to\nstay alive as long as he did, you know, they didn\u2019t. So that was one of the reasons\nthey didn\u2019t do anything for him.\nJanuary 16, 2002",
        "A: It-It changed a lot. My husband had to leave the army, because he also was sick,\nyou know, a lot. Then he had a very big problem getting a job. And finally he got a\njob. But you see, when he was -- when he got the job, he was not a communist, you\nknow, because a lot of them were in the, you know, a lot of them were really, you\nknow, communist wi -- and he was not.

        "A: You see, I had there lots of friends. I really didn\u2019t have any relatives. This one\nrelatives which we had in [indecipherable] my uncle came, my aunt never came.\nAnd one of the cousins, there were four children, one came. And I had a ver -- like a\nmother there. It was the daughter of that lady who was a friend of my late husband,\nthey went to school together. And they took us in like we were family. And she did\nmore than I ever did anything. I was very quiet. I didn\u2019t -- 1-it was a military funeral.\nI was there, but I really didn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t talk to anybody and I didn\u2019t just\ndo anything. And they used to come to my house, you know, the doctors who were -\nJanuary 16, 2002\n- some of them -- my late husband was a medical student before he went to the war.\nAnd one of the doctors was a friend of his, they went to same medical school. And\nhe came over and they were trying to -- when I had coffee, Babi would make coffee,\nor si -- mother, you know. And he would say do -- don\u2019t you want to break the cup?\nHe says, we\u2019ll have some noise. I didn\u2019t want to do nothing. I didn\u2019t talk to them,\nnothing. They came, they left. And then one day -- and I didn\u2019t take care of the kids,\nBabi took care of the kids. Never asked about the kids. And one day I -- every day\naround five o\u2019clock I used to go for the walk, for a long walk, after my late husband\ndied. And Babi always went with me. One day when I went to the door to go, she\nsaid, I\u2019m not going with you. And if you go yourself, she says, I\u2019m going put the\nchildren in a -- in a home for -- you know, without the -- for children without\nparents. I hesitated just a second, and I left. Wa -- when I walked, I said to myself,\nshe\u2019s not my mother. She is a strange woman. She doesn\u2019t care for my children. She\nwill put my children in a home [indecipherable] from home, because she doesn\u2019t\ncare. And I went home, I didn\u2019t say anything to her and I went into my daughter\u2019s.\nMy son was only five at the time. And she cried and I cried, and it really, you know,\nbroke everything between me and my children. My son was really too -- too young\nfor it. And then the doctor came and he talked to me. I didn\u2019t talk to Babi at all, I --\nI just didn\u2019t pay attention to her. And he came and he told me that if it wasn\u2019t for\nJanuary 16, 2002\nBabi, that time when I walked out by myself, they were all around me, they didn\u2019t\nknow what [Il do, and they were ready to put me away in Freiwaldau, you know,\nwhere I told you we were? And Babi said no, let me do it one more time. And she\nhad called and she said that I went to Elise and everything 1s all right between my\ndaughter and me. But otherwise I -- I just wasn\u2019t, you know, anything. And when I\nheard that, I went to Babi and I apologized. You know, it was so bad wha -- what I\ndid to her. And then I went to work, and -- and then came the time when I -- I\nimmediately applied to go to the United States and I was told immediately that I\nwill not go, that they will not let me go. That the children from a Czech officer will\nnot be beggars on Broadway. | didn\u2019t understand what that meant, but it was\nsomething it meant. And then -- then wa -- one t -- when I got the refusal that I\u2019m\nnot going to go, I went back one time. I asked again. And the guy there said, I told\nyou, you\u2019re not going to go. He says, what do you do -- lose, a man? He says, you\ndon\u2019t look so bad, you can get a man. And I got so mad. I got so mad, and I said, if\nit wasn\u2019t for my husband, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting here, and how dare you talk to me\nlike that? And I said, and I am going to the president. And I was with my little boy,\nhe didn\u2019t go to school yet, and I went to the president. When I came there, there was\nthe soldiers and they put the bayonet, they didn\u2019t talk to me. And I said to my son, I\nsaid, you stay right here. I said, if one hair is going to be crooked on this kid, I says,\nJanuary 16, 2002\nI cut both your heads off. And I went between the guns and I went in. They didn\u2019t\ndo nothing. I -- I made one step -- I went in and there was another guy. He says, can\nI help you? I said yes, I want to speak to the president. He says, do you have an\nappointment? I said, I thought the president is for the people, and I am a people and\nI wanted to talk to him. I have a grievance and I would like to tell him. He said okay\nand he took me in, and when I walked 1n, the president walked out. I said, he\u2019s\nleaving. I was all excited. I saw him and he\u2019s leaving. And the lady says, don\u2019t\nworry, he\u2019s here. He -- she says, you just come in and we\u2019 ll talk. And I complained\nto her and all and she says, do you need more money? Because I had a pension and\nmy children had a pension because we had military, you know. And I said no, I have\nmoney enough, I -- what could I have bought? There was nothing left to buy\nanyway. I said, I just wanted to see my mother, I says, I haven\u2019t see her. We went\nthrough the war and now I\u2019m not going to see her any more if I don\u2019t go now. She\nsays, I can\u2019t promise you to get -- go to the United States, but I can give you some\nmore money. And I left and I never, ever a-asked again to go until 1t was three years\nlater I got the letter that if I want to go I have to give up my pension and everything,\nand I can go. You know, it was so unfair to take the pension away from me, but I\nhad to -- I had to sign away my pension, my -- everything I had, and I could -- I\ncould go. And then when we -- before I went I had to go to court to sign for the\nJanuary 16, 2002\nchildren. And when I was ready to sign, a woman got up and she says she has a\ngrievance. She says, how can I sign away the things for the children? I got up and I\nhad with me one of the officers who -- who was a lawyer and he said, shut up and sit\ndown. I said, who is that woman? How dare she tell me I can\u2019t sign for the children?\nWhere was she all this time? Did she go with Mike to the hospital -- you know, my\nson wa-was sick, you know. And anyway, that was -- wh-which I didn\u2019t know, but\nmy kids had s -- whatever they took out, she was the guardian for my children. So\nanyway I signed and -- and we left.

And for poetry and\nall that. So I took it. My daughter was an ardent reader, so the children\u2019s books I\nhave had all color. Then I had a friend, she was a lawyer, she gave me all that.

Because I thought -- God bless America, when I\ncame I didn\u2019t see my mother, I didn\u2019t see my sister, I didn\u2019t see my friend from --\nthat was a soldier who I also knew. I -- I didn\u2019t see anybody but men. All I saw were\nmen, so many men, and I said God bless America, they knew the widow is coming.\nI was already three years a widow, I mean, you know. And they were -- and they\nwanted to talk to me, I didn\u2019t speak English. So they wanted to an-another language.\nThat time I spoke Ru-Russian fluently and Romanian and German and Czech. They\nwanted German, but I didn't talk. I was too a -- too afraid to talk. And -- but I\nrealized, they didn\u2019t come for me. But I was in every newspaper in the United\nStates was my picture, reunion between mother and daughter. I -- I have the\npictures, they are really nice. I can show you someday.\nJanuary 16, 2002",

But my -- actually no, I did -- I didn\u2019t even -- tha-that wasn\u2019t\nJanuary 16, 2002\nreally th-the -- the thing. When -- when I came, my sister just moved in in her first\nhouse. My sister was here when I came here. She 1s here, I don\u2019t remember how\nmany years longer than me. I think five, six, whatever. You know, they both\nworked, and they finally got themselves a house. But I couldn\u2019t get the house, yi -- I\ncouldn\u2019t get no-nothing, I didn\u2019t have any money. So I stayed with my sister for a\nyear and it was really hard because the house was very nice. My sister, my brother-\nin-law, they would have lied down, you could have walked on them. But they -- it\nwas only a three room house. So she had to put two of her kids together and put two\nin -- my kids there. Then I slept in the living room.

And then my mother\nleft because my mother left with her husband to a place, because she didn\u2019t make no\n-- no holidays, you know. So they left for their place.

So that part what I -- I made it anyway, I answered all -- all their questions\nand I -- and I had the -- I got a job as a -- as a nurse.

        "A: Very much. Very much. My daughter had a lot of trouble with my nephew. My -\n- then -- my nephew, I mean, he was really a little boy, too, I mean, even if he was\n13. He was just after his Bar Mitzvah. He had Bar Mitzvah in -- he was born\nJanuary second. So he had sometimes in January and we -- we came that same\nApril.\nJanuary 16, 2002",

        "A: The Bar Mitzvah, my nephew was just Bar Mitzvah in January and we came\nhere in April. And he had to, of course, give up his room and be with his brother and\nmy children had the other room. And then when they went to school they went to\nthe same -- same grade. And my son also, you know, he went to the first grade. First\nor second, I don\u2019t remember what he went. I think he went to the second grade. He\nwas a -- he was coming 1n the sec -- he went to the second grade. And you know, he\n-- my nephew, the oldest -- wh-when they went to school -- I have to ge -- start --\nwhen they went to school I wanted to give my daughter money, you know, for\nlunch. And my brother-in-law said absolutely not, that\u2019s my -- my job. And he gave\nJanuary 16, 2002\neach one 50 cents or whatever. And when they came to the bus my nephew would\nsay to my daughter, you give me some money, that\u2019s my money. And she never said\nthat to me tha-that -- I her -- heard that many, many years later, that she never had\nlunch, you know, because he wou -- he would take her money, you know, I mean he\n-- he -- it -- 1t was understandable. My son was -- also had problems because he --\nhe\u2019s a year older than the other kids and I said, don\u2019t you dare touch him, you know,\ndon\u2019t -- don\u2019t do anything. And my daughter cr -- told me once, she says, you better\ntell him that he can touch him, because he is really and truly taking advantage of\nhim and you told him don\u2019t touch, and he doesn\u2019t. So I took care of that situation\ntoo. And then my brother-in-law, he a -- what happened was with our crates what\nwe took with us, one crate was broken or -- or wasn\u2019t there and tha-that was the toys\nfrom my son. And he had a train and whatever, and it was all gone. So my brother-\nin-law said all the toys should be for the little -- little kid. And his older brother said\nto him, don\u2019t you dare touch anything, that\u2019s all ours, not yours. So I didn\u2019t know\nabout that either, of course. So then one day my daughter says, why don\u2019t you ask\nMike what he\u2019s doing when he comes home from school. So I asked him, I said,\nwhat are you doing when you -- he says, I do my homework. I says, and afterward?\nHe says, I do my homework. I said, don\u2019t you go outside and play? He said, I have\nnothing left to play with, I have no toys. So anyway, so I took my nephew aside one\nJanuary 16, 2002\ntime and I told him, I said, look, I know it\u2019s not easy for you and it\u2019s not easy for us.\nI says, your parents, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re not aware of it or whatever happened. I\nsaid, but one thing I can tell you. Don\u2019t do that to my children. I said, don\u2019t do that,\nbecause you'll be sorry. Pll beat the living daylights out of you if you ever do it\nagain. It took me years before I got him out of his -- oh, he was really scared of me.\nBut I would have never done it, but -- but anyway, and my son also got better. It -- it\nwa -- it was hard for them to adjust, it really was. They had a completely different\nlife, you know, and they had also a completely different life. It was just as bad for\nthem as for my kids, you know, they -- they weren't used to that, a whole family\nmoves in. So anyway, that\u2019s how -- and then we finally got our o-own apartment\nand that was -- that took care of -- th-that -- we were good -- we had -- we had a\nreally nice apartment. It -- 1t was a bachelor\u2019s apartment, but it was nice. My s -- my\ndaughter -- I had two jobs, I worked as a technician and my daughter was the one\nwho took care of the shopping, you know, I mean, in the meantime she was already\n14, and she was already a big girl. I never had a babysitter for my children when I\nhad my own apartment, I never. But I had an apartment in the building where there\nwas a porter, you couldn\u2019t get in there. That -- that\u2019s all I wanted really. And my --\nthen we got a -- an uncle of -- of mine gave me a dog, and oh we were so happy we\nhad the dog, but I -- that -- these were apartments only for people with -- with jobs,\nJanuary 16, 2002\nwho are -- with [indecipherable] jobs. So I had a job, I had no problem, but I\ncouldn\u2019t have the kids. So I took my daughter, she was almost as tall as I, you know,\nit was fun, it was no problem. But Mikey started to cry, he wanted to come home\ntoo. So I took him too, and I had the dog too. So -- so one day he came and he said,\nwho is that, to my daughter. I said, that\u2019s my sister. He says, and who is the little\nboy? I said, my son. He said, and she\u2019s your daughter? I says yes. I says, now I have\nto tell you a secret. He says, you know it doesn\u2019t go here, he says, but one thing --\nhe was also European, he says, one thing I tell you. Your kids behave, they can stay,\nbut something has to go, either the kids or the dog. So I let the dog go. But he was\nfunny, we had -- he was funny.",
        "A: Yeah, well, they ask me about communism, but that\u2019s about all. They were never\ninterested if I went through a Holocaust, and if I wanted to say something -- if I\nwanted -- you know, I didn\u2019t really want to, but if I wanted, they said they are really\nnot interested.",
        "A: Yes.\nJanuary 16, 2002",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t. I -- I -- I mean I -- I will -- I knew the English I learned in school,\nyou know, but I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: Of course, I -- when I finished school I went to a -- to a school, to a regular high\nschool to learn English. And at that point they wouldn\u2019t take me. They said I know\ntoo much English and I never really learned.",
        "A: They learned English, you know, time -- my daughter I took a -- a -- a girl, my\nson I didn\u2019t take anything, they learned English in no time.",
        "A: I met my current husband in 19 sif -- seve -- 62. The way I met him is through a\nfriend who was here, actually one of the friends what I mentioned that her husband\nwas killed. She was pregnant. He was killed when the communists took over\nCzechoslovakia. She had a sister here, and her brother-in-law was a -- a doctor and\nhe got me, actually, the per -- first job. And she came to visit, they lived on Fifth\nAvenue in an apartment, one floor was their apartment. She had her own room, her\nown bathroom, everything. And she came to visit me and she wanted to stay with\nme. I had one room, one. In that one room there was a tiny little kitchen, a tiny little\nJanuary 16, 2002\nrefrigera -- everything miniature and with a curtain. And then | had there two beds\nand a couch, and my son slept on the couch and Elise and I had a bed. And we had a\ntable and chairs and that was it. There was no room really for much more to go. And\nthen, anyway, when we bought the piano we had it -- you know, when you walked\nin there was a square and that\u2019s was a piano there. We were very crowded, actually\nin the -- in our apartment. And she wanted to go to Atlantic City. And I really\ndidn\u2019t want to go. I was busy, I had two jobs. And she said you can take one\nweekend, all you do is work. I said, doesn\u2019t matter, I said, and I don\u2019t have where to\nleave the kids and I am not going. She says, your sister will be happy to take the\nchildren. I said I don\u2019t want to. And anyway, I said, you can\u2019t sleep here either. You\nhave plenty of room where you are. So she said, can\u2019t I sleep once with you here? I\nsays, yo-you know, I -- you -- you don\u2019t realize it, I\u2019m already a widow for three\nyears, I says, if I sleep with anybody, you are the last person I\u2019d like to sleep with. I\nsaid, I don\u2019t want to sleep with you. She says, sleep with your daughter and then\ngive me her bed. Anyway, I slept with my daughter, I gave her ma -- the bed, and\nthen we did go. And I-I-I was so bad th-those days, really I was so bad. I didn\u2019t have\nmoney. I would take the money and give my daughter, you know, I mean she has to\nshop and do everything. So anyway, we went, th-that\u2019s how I met my husband. We\nwent to the -- on the beach and I told her that I want to sleep, you know, that I\u2019m\nJanuary 16, 2002\nreally very tired. I didn\u2019t -- I never realized how tired I was until I really got there.\nAnd so I went to sleep, and then she woke me, she says, can you show me how you\nuse your lighter. I used to smoke. And I showed her and she says, you\u2019re so stupid, I\nhave here such a nice guy, she says, he\u2019s looking at you all the time, but you thi --\nnever look. I said -- I didn\u2019t look, or I didn't open my eyes, I just showed her how\nand I kept sleeping. And then I hear a voice, you know, in English telling me, can I\nplease, you know, ask you a question? Could -- could -- I would like to take you and\nyour friend out tonight. I says, you can take my friend out, not me, but you can take\nher out. Tell me where, I\u2019ll bring her. She didn\u2019t speak any English. She spoke a\nlittle Jewish and he speaks a little Jewish and so they got along. So he gave me his\naddress, I said I\u2019Il bring her there and we brought her there, my friend where -- she\nhad a friend in Atlantic City, that\u2019s why we went there, I knew I won\u2019t have to pay\nhotel or anything. And when we came there we couldn\u2019t him, I mean, I didn\u2019t know\nhow he looks and she couldn\u2019t find him. Then she saw there is five dollars\nminimum. She says, can I go in? I said, no you can\u2019t. It\u2019s five dollars minimum,\nthat\u2019s not in my -- my thing to -- to spe-spend. So anyway, we went away and next\nday, Sunday when we came we saw -- I saw a guy and she said, that\u2019s him. And he\nlooked good. Boy, did he look good. He had a head of curls, you know, bl-blonde\ncurls and he was slender, you know, I -- he was really very slender and looked very\nJanuary 16, 2002\ngood. I said, I wouldn't even spit on him, I says, not -- I said he\u2019ll [indecipherable]\ncome. She says oh, don\u2019t be like that. And he came over to me and he says, you\nknow, I really and truly like you. I liked you yesterday and I like you today. I -- and\nI said, before you go any further, I want to tell you something. I says, you just met a\nwidow with two children, and that -- one of the women who have the least money in\nthe United States, that\u2019s me. And I am not interested in anybody. Not in you and\nnot in 10 like you. I said, I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not interested. So we went back, we sit down\nand then he says, will you come to my parents, my parents are here. And so I -- I\nwas sleeping and she says, come on, let\u2019s go over. I can\u2019t speak to hi -- his parents\nare from Russia and his mother really spoke some Russian, you know, and Kira\nspoke Russian, too. So we went over there and we met them. And then Monday\nwhen I came home from work the phone rang and my daughter answered the phone,\nsh -- she says, it\u2019s for you. I says who? She says a man. I said, what kind of man is\nfor me, I don\u2019t get no man calls. And I went to the phone, it was him. I said what are\n-- what do you want? I said, how did you get my number? He says Kira gave me\nyour number. So -- and then he wo -- said, can I come on the weekends? I says, you\ncan. I won\u2019t be home, but you can come. And he used to come and my son really\nfell in love with him, because he thought that ma -- it was somebody just for him,\nyou know. He was never married before. And he would come and come, I never saw\nJanuary 16, 2002\nhim, once maybe I saw him, or twice. And then a -- then I think Christmas it came,\nand then, you know, he started if I would marry him. And I said, why would I marry\nyou? I do -- I -- I really don\u2019t know you, you know, I -- I don\u2019t want to get married.\nAnd my daughter says to me, Mommy, you have to marry him. I says, why do I\nhave to marry him, I don\u2019t even love him. She says, you don\u2019t have to love him,\nMike loves him. I says, Mike loves him, let him marry him. And I got married. She\nsays I have to marry him, so I marry him. He -- I love him now. I didn\u2019t love him\nthen, but I love him now, he\u2019s a good man.",

        "A: He skipped -- he skipped grades, yes. When we moved -- when I married my\nhusband then, you know, he got a job in Saint Louis, Missouri. And when we went\nto Missouri they put him back. He had skipped in New York and they put him back\nand then we went back to New York and he -- he had his skipping, you know. He is\ndoing very nicely.",
        "A: Oh yes, I did. My children actually asked us if we will talk to them. And one day\nmy sister and I sat down and I wished we would have had a tape and we talked\nabout it. We talked to each other. And I -- we -- we couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t really\nbelieve that we went through everything which we went through and we talked to\nour children. We didn\u2019t talk then -- we didn't do it again, but my children knew how\nmuch the whole thing meant to both of us. And when they started with the building\nof the museum, I was very sick. I got, in 1989 I had cancer of the -- of the kidney\nand I had lung cancer and I was [indecipherable] and by a sheer miracle I really\nJanuary 16, 2002\nmade it.

And was in the GW and they told me that I --\nthey can\u2019t do anything any more for me, and that I had to leave.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And so tha -- so my -- lucky for me my friend was with me, I\nworked at the [indecipherable] at that time. No, no, I -- I had just stopped; we -- we\nwere let go. But anyway, my girlfriend was there and she wanted I should go to\nMount Vernon, because | had heard that in Mount Vernon is a -- 1s a place where\nthey do the same thing like they do at -- at -- in -- here in Washington at what --\nwhat do you call? The -- the guy who was my -- my -- in college it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a\nhospital, told my husband that he called di -- W -- G du -- he called the place in\nNew York, you know, Sloan Caterer, he called the hospital in Baltimore, you\nknow, John Hopkins and the -- and here also, in Washington, and nobody would\ntake me. They couldn\u2019t take me, they were right, because I had no life left. I had less\nthan 25 percent of breathing, and there was nobody to take, you know, I -- it really\nwasn\u2019t. My girlfriend, she knew -- I had told her about Mount Vernon. What\nhappened was Dr. Rosenberg was in together with a Dr. Ayliss. And this Dr. Ayliss\nJanuary 16, 2002\nhad something with -- wi-with Rosenberg, whatever happened, it wasn\u2019t all right,\nand he got the grant in Mount Vernon and he had one floor there where he di -- did\nthe same thing they did at GW, and she wanted to take me there, and she took me\nthere. And I ha -- I was in a wheelchair, I couldn\u2019t walk or anything. And we went\nin, and he didn't want to take me, but he did examine me and he says he can\u2019t take\nme, you know, it\u2019s not even legal and he can\u2019t do it. So we left, my husband and I,\nand Diane, my friend, stayed there. So, it was in August and I was very, very hot,\nand I knew that I have a few hours to live. I wanted to call my children and\neverybody, my sister and you know, at least to see them. And I wanted to go home.\nAnd my husband said, I can\u2019t, you know, Diane is not here, she doesn\u2019t have a car,\nbecause she came with us. So he got out of the car to go and get her and that she\ncame out with the doctor and with the wheelchair, not to take mine and they took\nme in. And it took them three weeks to wa -- I didn\u2019t weigh enough, you know, I\nhad to weigh at least, I think 98 or a hundred pounds and I weighed like 95. And\nthey brought me up two pounds I was, I think two -- I still didn\u2019t have. And they ga\n-- put me o-on the study. And I was on the study and I was the only one left. There\nwas a lady left which came later on, she didn\u2019t have what I had, she had melanoma.\nAnd she survived, but for my tho -- who was with me, nobody survived. There were\n75 people, I was the only one who made it.\nJanuary 16, 2002",
        "A: Ina research study, yes. I signed up for it, I -- for me it was no problem.
