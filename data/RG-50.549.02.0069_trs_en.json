        "Question: -- States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This\nis an interview with Isaac Nehama, conducted by Margaret West on June the second,\n2003, in Bethesda, Maryland. This interview is part of the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and is a follow-up interview to\n2002. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff\nand Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.",
        "Answer: My name is Isaac Nehama. I was born in Athens, Greece, April 29,\nninetweent-- 1926. I returned to Athens from the partisans. I was stationed at that time\nin Thessaly, in the city of Lireza, which 1s the capital of Thessaly. I returned to Athens\nt -- either towards the very end of October, \u201944, or beginning of November \u201944.\nApproximately two or three weeks after the liberation of Greece -- actually, the\nGermans left Greece because the Russians were about to enter Yugoslavia, and\ntherefore their retreat would have been cut off. So the Germans essentially left Greece.",
        "Q: And when were you reunited with -- with your father?",
        "A: Well, I arrived in Athens on, I remember, a Sunday. And the reason this 1s\nprominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days,\nsometimes they are deserted. I arrived in Athens f -- with a bus that I had taken from\nLireza perhaps around four or five o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I called from the bus\nstation, and I was told to immediately come. I took a taxi, and when finally we were\napproaching our neighborhood, and my house, I expected to be greeted in the street by\nmy two younger brothers, but I saw no one. In fact, there was not a single person in the\nstreet. And I walked up to our apartment, I rang the door. A woman came out, who I\nrecognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in Lireza two weeks or so\npreviously, who had told me that she had been passing through, and she had a message\nfrom my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me,\nand she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back. Of course, I\n-- I now know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to\ngive me for the fare. In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I\nthink she didn\u2019t even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to\nthe apartment of our pre-war neighbors, a family called Shabitai. I didn\u2019t know what to\nmake of it, why would I have to go to the Shabitai\u2019s to see my family? So I went one\nmore flight, and I knocked on the door, and Mrs. Shabitai opened the door, and she\nembraced me, and I was shown into their living room, and then I saw my father, and\nonly my father, with Mr. Shabitai. I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked\nwhere 1s mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the\nyoungest brother. And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr.\nmi -- Shabitai said that th-they were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that\nthat wasn\u2019t the time to explain. They implied that I must have known that terrible\nthings happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught, and no one knows --\nknew where they went. That was the -- the reunion.",
        "Q: Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to\nbeginning to plan where you would live, and how you would put your lives together?",
        "A: Yeah, but I have to -- to cover 1v -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two\nweeks after my arrival. I -- in -- in the beginning of December of \u00b044, there was a brief\ncivil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British\nforces in Athens. And these troubles primarily occurred in Athens. There -- there was\nfighting in the street, and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured.\nThen, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I s -- even then we called it the\nevents, our neighborhood was liberated, and as I recall by a small group of English\nparachutists, I remember their red berets. So that was the beginning of what I thought\nwas going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in line to\nbuy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken,\ninterrogated. They wanted me to reveal names of known leftists. I explained to them I\nhad been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active. But\nit -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of\nAthens, and eventually to Africa. But very shortly, through the intervention of\nrelatives, I was freed, and came back. So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of\n45 that we even began to even think about the restoration of our lives. Since as soon\nas I finish high school in 1942, the universities were closed, and I couldn\u2019t go on, and\nmy father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large\ntextile firm in Athens. So he resumed hi-his -- his profession. Also, I must note that the\napar -- our apartment in Athens, where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a\nwife, one of them being the woman who gave me the money in -- in Lireza. They were\noccupying half of the apartment, they couldn\u2019t be evicted, or -- or -- 1t was out of the\nquestion to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action. So my father and I sort of lived in half\nof the apartment, until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and\nMrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, eventually left, and went, and found another -\n- another apartment. So immediately I -- I then began getting preparations for taking\nthe entrance exam to the Polytechnic Institute in Athens, which I -- this usually took\nplace in the end of August, beginning of September. And indeed, in -- in September of\n\"45, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the\nPolytechnic Institute, before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- ina\nmoment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously\nto find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and --\nbut that\u2019s ano -- a different chapter.",
        "Q: Yes. When you were a teenager, you had been working. What was the work that\nyou were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943?",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished high school in June of \u201942. Since the\nuniversities were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that\nI would simply remain idle. So I was -- my father found a job for me. Let me describe\nit as being the clandestine, or an illegal market in currency. There was a -- not a black\nmarket, but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in Greece during the\noccupation. What was exchanged were principally, and almost exclusively, gold coins,\neither British sovereigns, French gold francs, or Swiss francs. Occasionally -- and the\nonly non-metal currency that was acceptable were U.S. dollars. And also, occasionally,\nsmall bars of gold. So, this individual, who was originally from Salonika, and who was\na -- in the stock market in Salonika, the legal stock market, he had, with his family,\nescaped from Salonika, established himself in Athens, and then started a -- an office by\nhimself. A bureau conducting this sort of activity. Very briefly, the way it worked, if\nsomebody wanted to, let\u2019s say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because\ndrachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued. The -- the value of -- th --\nthe price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies. For instance, while\nRommel was advancing in North Africa, then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold\npound and the dollar, would then be def -- deflated. And when, on the contrary, when\nthe allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the\n-- the drachma would be more highly valued, because it would have s-some value\nother than what the piece of paper that was the currency during the occupation. So this\nis what, essentially, he was doing. And my job was -- I didn\u2019t do the trades, but I had\nto deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let\u2019s say, 10\ngold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go first to the seller, to his house, get the roll of\ncoins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer. It was, let\u2019s say,\na dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal. If I had\nbeen caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was. Even conducting\nthis sort of business was -- was illegal. So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we\n-- we had a number of shelves in the office with textiles. Woolens, and some silks,\npretending that it was that sort of business, but actually, the -- the business itself was\nthe -- the currency.",
        "Q: And was this a Jewish enterprise?",
        "A: Well, it -- the man, his name was Haim Romano, happened to be a Jew from\nSalonika, but th-the traders were both Christian Greeks, as well as Jews.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And when you mention your neighbors in the apartment above, were --\nwere they Jewish? And I know that your parents sort of social network was generally\nfamily contacts. I think people they knew from Monisteer, or --",
        "A: Relatives.",
        "Q: -- it was a -- a Jewish world in which they led their lives, would you say?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, and the Shabitais were Jews, but they were not Sephardim. Mr. and\nMrs. Shabitai -- Mrs. Shabitai was from Yarninar, and Mr. Shabitai was from Trikola.\nBoth of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as\nGreek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, not Judeo espanole speaking, or they were\nnot descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492. In contrast, my\nparents on both sides -- both of them were born in Monasteer, traced their ancestry to\nthe Sephardim who left Spain, and eventually ended up in that part of the Balkans,\nwhich was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you think that your group had any -- was there a Sephardim look? I\nmean would -- could you -- could you say that you were slight in build, and dark, and -\n- | mean, 1s -- was there a difference between the Sephardim and the Ashkenazis?",
        "A: Do you see any difference? No, no, I -- I -- I don\u2019t recall -- really I think that I\ncouldn\u2019t distinguish any surface difference between the looks of my family or our\nrelatives, and other Greeks. They all have, perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean\nlook, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration. Of course, a -- a --\nyou -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Greeks, or -- or Turks, or\nsouthern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people. But there were a few there, but otherwise\nthere were no such characteristics of Sephardim. The thing that was distinguishing, of\ncourse was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother,\nwho would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt\n-- a sister of my mother\u2019s, that\u2019s the only language that she understood, and we had to\nspeak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was Ladino your mother tongue?",
        "A: Not mine. Mine was, well dual, Greek primarily because of my friends and going to\nschool, but at home it was obligatory to speak French, bo -- my mother was a teacher\nof French, and my father had studied in Paris, or -- we -- we were obliged to speak in\nFrench.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t know what you spoke first as a child, or -- or fr -- from the very\nbeginning? Perhaps you were speaking Ladino and French right from infancy on.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t believe that I spoke Ladino. Perhaps, before I began to go to school, I\nbelieve, and I -- I seem to -- I recollect that I spoke to my parents in French.",
        "Q: I\u2019m backing away now and coming -- thinking again of your father at this time. Do\nyou have a sense of how he was coping? I mean, he had lost his -- at this particular\npoint, he had lost his wife and two sons. Do you have a sense of what gave him\nstrength, and what his state of mind was?",
        "A: I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it\nvery often. Or in discussions I have with people. And I always have to remind myself\nand my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part\nof the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate\nthings, with y-young children. I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- Ica -- I recollect from cousins\nthat they began to have conversation as between adults, and equals with their parents,\nafter they themselves had matured, and were married. So I don\u2019t think that there was,\nlet\u2019s say, reluctance. My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very\nseldom, o-o-other than in passing he would say how dinner was in -- on -- on high\nholidays in Monasteer, how the dinner would be prepared, and things like this. A\nepisode of things like this. But not very much about personal life. But coming back to\nyour question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I\ntold him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the\nGreek mountains with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly\nsuperficial. We didn\u2019t go into -- into that. Knowing my father as I recollect him, he\nwas an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he\nhad a club foot. So he was always hobbled. He always wor -- wor -- walked with a\ncane. But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely. I\nthink you -- you know the example of his urging me not to be caught alive by the\nGermans. So, I can only imagine the -- the pain that he had with the loss -- or at that\ntime, you know, we still had a very, very faint hope that perhaps they might return. We\n-- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April \u201945, so the\npictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the\ncamps was still totally unknown. So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although\nvery, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back. And the focus, therefore, was I\nthink a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best\nwe could, and so my father resumed his work, and I then resumed the preparations for\ntaking the exams.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You know, wh-when I asked you that question, I was thinking of his\nadmonishing you to not be taken by the Germans. And I think he spoke of that, I\u2019m\nassuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go\nto the mountains. And you were the oldest, and you\u2019d had your Bar Mitzvah. And\ntimes were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open\nin what he said to you.",
        "A: Well, but you have to remember that -- th -- it was such a special moment, I -- I\ncannot conceive of an -- a recollection -- let me back off, very quickly. In the summer\nof \u00b039, my father took me to a -- there\u2019s a -- a place about a hundred kilometers from\nAthens, it\u2019s called Lutrikey, and it\u2019s a -- sort of a spa, because it has water sources that\nare -- contain rad-radio activity, radium. And they were thought to be very beneficial\nfor whatever a-ails you. It was essentially a resort. And so we went ahead of the rest of\nthe family for three or four days. It was shortly after by -- my Bar Mitzvah, and I still\nremember the first time that -- so we were the two of us, and is the first instance that I\nrecall my father telling me, for example [indecipherable] personal plans, that he had\nbegun to -- I see -- remember telling me -- put some money aside, and part of plan was\nwe were going to leave the apartment where we had lived for -- since I rec -- I recall.\nAnd we\u2019re going to buy a house. So it was the first time that I had heard my father\ntelling me of something about his -- let\u2019s say dreams and plans for the future. So, in\nother words, it was the first instance where I think I was tr -- being treated as an adult.\nThe unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned, the war started, in September of\n\u00b039, so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of \u201939, it\u2019s the last\nsummer -- and that in 1940 because the war didn\u2019t touch Greece until the fall of 1940\nthat are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy, at least -- I have to\nuse a French word, insouciance, that we were not bothered. The war had started, it was\na terrible thing. My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World\nWar, and it\u2019s horrors in Monasteer, but it was so far away that it didn\u2019t yet begin to\ntouch us until the fall of 1940. So, it\u2019s a long detour to what\u2019s -- what -- what you ask.\nSo | -- I -- I think there was a tremendous amount of resilience, and strength that -- in\nmy father, which was not apparent on the surface. When he admonished me not to be\ncaught alive by the Germans, I think 1t was because he knew from all the reports of the\n30\u2019s, since the rise of Hitler in Germany, the history of the -- of the Jews in Gaspora,\nall these things, you know, get farely concentrated, and simply -- al-although I don\u2019t\nthink he -- no one knew at that time of concentration camps, but he knew that 1t was\nnot a good thing to be caught alive by the Germans. So he -- he -- it was a second\ninstance of I -- his addressing me as an adult, and telling me that it\u2019s better to -- to be\ndead, than be caught alive.",
        "Q: And I would assume then, that there might have been more confidences shared at\nthat stage in your life, were it not for the fact that I think you s -- you also talk earlier\nin your interview on videotape about the pall that descended, so that it became a\nsituation from your parents when they -- their fears were something they di -- they\nwanted to protect you from.",
        "A: F -- yo-your absolutely correct about the pall, because it was so palpable, I -- I can\nstill feel it. I don\u2019t re -- recall that there was, let\u2019s say, a smile on their faces after about\nmid or early April of 1943, because the news began to come in very quickly about\nboth Monasteer and Salonika. Those occur about two or three weeks apart. And the --\nalthough -- sou -- a few things were written up in the papers that was really not -- some\nthat was really spoken, but they knew from reports of relatives. And as I say, I -- from\nthen on, I don\u2019t recall their being a single smile in their faces. Now I\u2019ve lost track of\nwhat you asked.",
        "Q: Oh, and they wanted to protect you, I think, from their fears.",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. Ye-Yes. Really, I think it would be a stretch for me\nagain to say that that was the motivation. Surely -- I\u2019m sure that they wouldn\u2019t want to\nalarm us, especially my younger brothers. But even to me, they -- they didn\u2019t say\nthings because they knew that I would have -- I wouldn\u2019t have that much to contribute.\nBut it was -- it was a sort of shielding, but I think it was primarily because they\nthemselves were, first of all, not only so crushed by what they had heard, but the\nprinciple thing was that they be -- I\u2019m sure now, in retrospect, that they were mulling\nwhat to do in case so -- something like this would reach Athens. So I think their total\npreoccupation for all that time after beginning of April \u201943 was precisely what to do.\nThat\u2019s why when finally it did occur, September of \u201943, after the Italian armistice, then\nsuddenly, and for the first time, we had a family council, something that had never\noccurred before. And my father and mother sat us around the table, and with very few\nwords, told us what we had to do. Therefore, all these preparations must have been\npart of what they -- they were preoccupied in what they were preparing to do. Because\n1--]--[ --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Isaac Nehama. This is tape number one, side B.",
        "A: I believe we were talking about the situation a-after April \u201943, when the news from\nSalonika and Monasteer came, and I think I was alluding to the fact that although our\nparents did not take us into their confidence about their concern, their worries, but I\ncan only surmise, and I\u2019m almost positive now in checking with my brother, that a lot\nof the time, intervening time, was spent in preparing for -- not inevitability, but in -- in\nthe event that the same thing would occur in Athens. Because I cannot explain in any\nother way, the fact that practically as soon as the signal was given to disperse in\nAthens, the plan was already in place about where to go.",
        "Q: And the plan about where to go raises lots of questions for me about the -- the\nfriends, or the people with whom you -- your family, not -- not you, ultimately, sought\nshelter, or -- or -- or homes, and the extent to which those people took risks, or did not\ntake risks.",
        "A: All right. A couple of weeks before the dispersal, a friend of -- a sc-schoolmate -- I\n-- | would speak about my role first. Although again, I hadn\u2019t discussed this with my\nparents, but sensing what was happening, this school f-friend, Thanasis Mikalopoulus,\nwho is a Christian Greek, I had told him that there may come a time when I may have\nto go into hiding, and then -- we were close friends, but I hadn\u2019t even met his parents.\nHe says, \u201cThey\u2019ll be n-no question, you will come and stay with us.\u201d So that sort of\nwas done. When then we had this family council about where to go, I will tell you very\nquickly, my -- my father -- first of all, no Jewish family, really more than three or four\nat most, could possibly be hiding all together, because it would have been very\napparent, no matter where they were hiding, that neighbors would immediately see,\nsuddenly, not one or two, which you can justify as being my visiting relative from the\nprovinces. Well, not suddenly, you know, a whole -- a whole family. So, this person\nwas essential. My father went and -- and stayed for a certain period of time. Certainly\nuntil my departure from the mountains about a month later, with a -- a couple, they\nwere childless. Both the man and the -- the -- the woman -- his name was Tenasias, her\nname was Ellie, they were both working in the same company that my father did, so\nthey were both colleagues, as well as friends of long-standing. Next door to our house\nin Athens, to our apartment, was a man who had a small store that was really a mini\nvariety store. By that I mean he -- he sold tobacco, cigarettes, newspapers, but also in\nthe back o-of -- he had thread, and needles. It was that -- that sort of convenience\nneighborhood store. And over the years my father had become very, very friendly with\nthis individual, and he had a house in one of the suburbs on the eastern side of Athens,\nreally a -- a vi -- a far suburb. And that\u2019s where my mother and two brothers went. So\nwhen we dispersed, that\u2019s how we -- that\u2019s where we went.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: You ask about risks. Well, really all of them took risks, and the same risks, because\nthe Germans made it known that sheltering Jews, or sheltering people like members of\nthe resistance, whether arm resistance or the political resistance was a capitol offense,\nan -- and from time to time they would shoot them in the street. So taking risks was\nquite a -- a -- well-known, and all of them took risks, and the same risks.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I was interested 1n the -- what took place in Germany, and it seemed to me\nthat -- and I think you mentioned this, that Greeks helped the Jews, and they said,\n\u201cWe're all humans.\u201d It\u2019s common humanity. But I think it\u2019s worth you discussing that\nmore, just because something happened in Germany where -- perhaps it was baser\ninstincts of humans were worked on, but they began to see the Jews as not human. And\nthat enabled them to collaborate with the Nazis.",
        "A: Well yes, but remember, it took quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of history for\nthings of that sort to take place. Look at Bulgaria. In 1941 they pass a law, which has\nabout -- magnificent Orwellian title, the law for the protection of the state. But it was\nalmost patterned -- similar to the Nuremberg laws, and -- and most of it\u2019s provisions\nwere clearly anti-Semitic. Or what happened to the Romanian Jews? Half a million\npeople were -- most of them massacred by the Iron guard of Romanians themselves.\nOr the -- the Jews of Serbia and Croatia? Most of them died of starvation by the\nUstasha, th-th-th-th -- the -- the Croatian Fascists. So, the Germans, by no means had -\n- didn\u2019t have, you know, the exclusive patent to brutality and cruelty. They rose it to --\nto heights of subtlety and -- and demonic deviousness. [indecipherable] Salonika Jews,\nthey were telling them that they gonna send them to Krakow, and -- and un-\nunfortunately, the -- the chief rabbi, who was the leader of the community in Salonika\nwas a -- a gullible, naive, stupid individual, who then tried to reassure the -- th-the\nJews of Salonika that their brethren in Krakow were going to take care of them. Of\ncourse, the Germans didn\u2019t tell them that Krakow had already been totally eliminated.\nSo this kind of a thing hadn\u2019t reached Greece or Italy. Maybe -- I don\u2019t know, maybe\nthe ethnic character, 1t would never have taken root, but I have to admit that I often\nthink that we have failed miserably, in the last 50 or 60 years. When I was in the\nmountains we thought that that was going to be the end of this sort of brutality, and\none sees it repeated over, and over again, as if these things didn\u2019t happen. So I feel a\npersonal sense of failure, that my generation has done something terribly wrong.",
        "Q: Also, do you think that the role of the Greek church was very critical in being\noutspoken and saying that we oppose this?",
        "A: Look, le-le-let\u2019s put things perspective. There was really one extremely courageous\nvoice, that\u2019s was Thamskino\u2019s, the archbishop, who not only protested openly, and\nwho I think, perhaps -- I don\u2019t know if it was mentioned in the videotaping, he was\nthreatened by the German general Stupa that he would be shot, and Thamaskino said,\n\u201cGreek clergy traditionally have been hanged.\u201d And he expected Stupa to follow the\nsame tradition, yeah. But look, I know of no really massive -- by that I mean even in t -\n- in the [indecipherable] of Jews that were saved through the action of the Greek\nOrthodox church. The -- it is a fact that Thamaskinos, the archbishop said that Jews\nwould find refuge in monasteries, but I really don\u2019t know of a single case where Jews\nsurvived because they were sheltered in monasteries.",
        "Q: Yeah. There are not remarkable stories of righteous acts, then?",
        "A: Oh, there are -- there are lots, but they -- they -- they are not on the part of an\norganized body, wha -- be it the church. For example, the then chief of police, Evert,\nhe -- I mean, in the German occupation, he personally issued or gave orders, and faked\nid -- identity cards were issued to Jews. These -- these were acts of heroism that are --\nreally were individual. Other than Evert, and this act of Thamaskinos of open protest,\nall the other Jews who were saved was through the act of, I think, great humanity, first\nof all, and even at times against a -- a -- you know, a palpable danger on the part of\nindividual Greeks.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go on now to the reunion with your brother Samuel.",
        "A: Well, as you recall from the other tape, beginning in May, or June of \u201945 as I recall,\nwhen the first news of the liberation of concentration camps, then -- and -- and -- and -\n- and DP\u2019s -- displaced persons began to be processed, then there were both -- there\nwere reports both in the Greek newspapers, and also on the radio of rec-recitation of\nnames of the known people who were -- would be returning. And I found this out from\na neighbor in the -- in one morning, that she had heard my brother\u2019s name. But within\nreally t-two or three days shortly after this news, Sam already had been moved,\neventually from Germany to Italy, Bali, and then to Pardres, and then he called on the\nphone and told us that he was arriving, and I went to the station and -- and there he\nwas. Well, 1-1 -- first of all, I cou -- I didn\u2019t recognize him right away, because he had\ngrown so much in the brief year and a half that -- almost two years since I had see --\nwe had seen each other. And two things I think, or one thing s -- that struck me was\nthat his behavior, at least outwardly in the days and weeks after his return, to -- at least\nto me it appeared as if he had not really -- or -- or -- or all these horrors, and all these\nexperiences had not left such a -- a -- a mark on him, because he -- he would laugh,\nand sing, and -- and I remember he was into -- into jazz, and -- and -- and modern\nmusic, and going out with -- with friends. Whereas I had really, in the -- in the -- in the\nmonths in the mountains, I had spent a great deal of time just thinking about what had\nhappened, and also looking to a much better situation afterwards, and I had all kinds of\nplans, and especially about my mother, who was always a very demanding woman,\nand who I thought was not -- never satisfied with my accomplishments, and that she\nwould be very proud about things that I was going to do. And -- and -- and I had been,\nI think, much more touched by the events than I could see Sam. Of course, it\u2019s very\ndifficult to read what is really deep in -- in somebody\u2019s mind, or psyche. But at least\noutwardly, I was astounded at the resilience of human beings to go through this -- this\nhorror which you would begin to see in newsreels and read progressively in books,\nthat the term Holocaust hadn\u2019t even been invented yet. But I was astounded.",
        "Q: And did you -- were you able to come up with any explanation of how Sam could\nbe coping?",
        "A: Well, the only explanation was that -- that simply because he was not only young,\nabsolu -- in absolute terms, but that -- that in that period of 13 or 14, there was more\nelasticity in -- in -- in somebody\u2019s mind and character and emotions than there would\nbe -- we only had four years apart -- in any -- 1n any case, it -- it -- I was much more\naffected by the -- by the war experience, all the events, than I saw Sam being affected.\nAnd that\u2019s -- simply surprised me.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How did you view, subsequently, your decision not to remain in Athens,\nbut to go to the mountains? In a sense it seemed to me you -- your -- you were 1n\nhiding, but you were in hiding with the partisans in the mountains.",
        "A: All right. I have -- I have thought about this thing very, very much, but I -- I can\nreally tell you that 1t was not resolved of a great deal of rational thinking, and\nweighing of factors for and against. I can only ascribe it to pure instinct, number one,\nto a aspect of my personality that I simply -- when I thought about it, I re -- re-refused\nto -- to -- to -- to s -- to s -- to accept the possibility of remaining in hiding for an\nindeterminate period of time. I had never been away from home, although the\nMikalopoulus\u2019s were very kind to me, they accepted me, th-th -- Thanasis, my friend,\nwas the only child, the only son, and -- and there was never any hesitation, accepting\nme as another, but it wasn\u2019t really that I felt a stranger, simply that I could not\nwithstand a life of continuous hiding, which then made me an -- and the moment this\ntook root, then what I call personality, I -- P\u2019ve believe that what is referred to\nsometimes, I\u2019m goal oriented. That means I -- once I set a -- a target, then I -- I do\nwhatever I can to -- to -- to reach that -- that outcome. That was what propelled me.\nThe -- it wasn\u2019t really based on any other set of weighing of rational pieces of\ninformation for or against. That was going to be it, and I was going to a total unknown.\nI didn\u2019t even know where I was going.",
        "Q: Was part of it your wish to be actively resisting?",
        "A: No. The active wish was to survive.",
        "Q: And I wonder if you talked with your father about this, but it seems that for those in\nhiding, they must have been -- have felt imperiled. I mean, when they\u2019d go to sleep at\nnight, you never knew when you wou -- would be denounced. I think of how fearful a\ntime it must have been when the rest of your family, your mother, grandmother, and\nbrothers were taken for questioning. Did you talk to your father about what that stage\nwas like for him?",
        "A: The answer 1s, we didn\u2019t talk, but -- and I again, I surmise that -- l-let\u2019s put some\ndates, so we -- we -- we will know what we are talking about. My mother and brothers\nwere caught towards the end of June, beginning of July of 1944. They were\nincarcerated in the detention camp of Hithari. And on July 29, they were put on board\nthe last transport that ever left Greece, together with the 1800 Rhodesian Jews. I can\nimagine that my father learned about that not because anyone went and told him.\nThere was no such contact, but he must have surmised, because they say from a\nnegative side, lack of contact from time to time, my mother, or Sam would go to my\nfather, not so much alone to see him, but also to get money. Also, perhaps -- we didn\u2019t\ncover that, I don\u2019t believe in the video interview, but I know subsequently, that my\nfather changed hiding places three times, because -- you know, the -- you can only\nmaintain a -- a pretense of a visiting relative up to a certain point, all right? So there\nwould come a time when it was time to go. Some -- ok -- times there were o -- really\nostensible reasons that people would suspect, or even somebody would whisper and\nsay -- they begin to s -- to know that you are Jews, whereupon both the family who\nwere doing the sheltering, as well as the sheltered, knew that it was time to -- to move.\nSo my father moved three times. At the time of, I think, the capture of my mother,\ngrandmother and brothers, he -- it was finally in the last place, the third place, before\nthe liberation. And simply, he must have realized that something had happened,\nbecause there were no contact -- there was no contact. Of course, he found out\nimmediately after -- after the liberation.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What did Sam later tell you about that? I mean, were they -- were they\nbrutally treated, because I -- I think the Germans would want to find out where your\nfather and you were?",
        "A: Yes. Yes, this is a -- a -- really a very painful a-aspect to me, because of what Sam\ntold me. In their interrogation, the beatings that my mother and he were subjected --\nnot the young one, not the me -- Mekko. And they kept on asking them about my\nfather\u2019s and my whereabouts. Of course, in -- 1n a case for me, she did not know. And\nthen Sam told me that for months, and months, and months, my mother was really\ndestitute, and -- and -- a -- I mean, extremely concerned about what had happened to\nme. She did not know where I had gone. I\u2019m sure my father told her, \u201cHe\u2019s gone to the\nmountains.\u201d But even with my father I didn\u2019t com -- there was no way to communicate\nand -- and send notes from time to time, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m fine. There were no ways of doing\nthat. So the combination of her concern about my fate and whereabouts, and -- and the\nbrutality and the beatings, and -- and the other thing which is so revealing about my\nmother that Sam mentions in his interview, was her almost foolhardy defiance of the\nGestapo. Of cursing them, of calling them criminals, of telling them that their\ncomeuppance would come very soon. This -- I mean, either heroism -- you know,\nthat\u2019s un-unthinkable, or foolhardiness, another thing my mother was a foolhardy\nperson. But it\u2019s an aspect that\u2019s -- is so telling about -- about her. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s --\nI don\u2019t even know if my father knew about these events. They didn\u2019t come up. I didn\u2019t\nlearn about what I just related to you, until I saw Sam\u2019s interview with the sh -- the\nSpielberg foundation.",
        "Q: I think you had mentioned earlier that in that family, that one family council\nmeeting, you had agreed that you would never disclose where each of you were. And\nit\u2019s interesting therefore, your mother\u2019s defiance. But I wonder also if you had her\ndetermination. She was a strong personality, I think, and it may have been that spirit\nfrom her that drove you to go to the mountains.",
        "A: I would like to think that that\u2019s the case, but I have to also confess that it was not,\nagain, a conscious thing. In other words, I -- I -- I set my -- I became determined to do\nit. | even -- I mean, in -- in retrospect -- no, you know from my thi -- the other\ninterview, that I didn\u2019t even have an identity card. I -- I -- I manufactured one of them,\nwhich really would not pass scrutiny even by a -- an idiot, but fortunately we were not\nstopped. S -- the fact that -- that -- that I did it, that I didn\u2019t know where I was going to\nend up, it was something that -- that simply drove me, and if it was a part of -- a\nsimilarity in -- in character traits, that\u2019s what it is.",
        "Q: What did you later learn from Sam about your younger brother? I\u2019m wondering if\nyour mother protected him? I -- I -- I think he was -- he would be 10 when he died, I\nthink.",
        "A: He was nine.",
        "Q: I wonder if she would hide from him something of the horrors, and -- but I don\u2019t\nknow what you learned.",
        "A: Well, really very little. Mekko, as we used to call him, well, his name was --\nMechalmar was his first name, was too young. An eight year difference, as you know,\nis immense among young children, although I re -- I remember I -- when he was two,\nor three, or four, I was his protector, I would take him to walks, and to play ina\nnumber of places near our house. There was a square with -- in a garden, in a\nplayground. But we did not exchange things. I -- I don\u2019t th-think I [indecipherable] my\nmother. Obviously she protected him in the sense of making sure that he was fed, and -\n- and clothed while they are -- they are hiding, under those circumstances. But, you\nknow, as you -- as you know, children sense, even much younger, so I\u2019m sure that he\nknew that these were dire times, and I -- I think someone refers the fact that actually\nthe -- the capture, the denouncement was perhaps that both children, in the last place\nof their hiding, they went out to play in the streets. And maybe more than they should\nhave, and therefore, seeing strange faces, perhaps, gave some people who were not\nparticularly sympathetic to the situation, to spread the word. Not maybe maliciously,\nbut once these kinds of things came in, well, there are strangers in this neighborhood,\nyou gotta remember that the people who discovered them were Greeks collaborating\nwith the Germans, and who perhaps, a the -- I -- of -- out of ideological reasons, but in\norder to maintain their jobs, they became more zealous than -- or more\n[indecipherable] than the king, as the saying goes. So they went out of their way to --\nyou know, to -- to chalk up captures. And that\u2019s how it happened, because they\nexposed themselves a little bit more than -- than they should have. But at the same\ntime, they were young children, and they had to get out and play.",
        "Q: Have you felt a wish to f -- try to find out who revealed where your mother was? I\nmean, oh -- did you even feel a wish to do that?",
        "A: La -- I\u2019ve asked Sam about that. There is no -- no one knows who did -- if there was\nreally someone, or more than one who actually denounced. I think simply, as I say, the\nword spread around there were strangers in the neighborhood. This got picked up by\nthese roving collaborators. Now, what is known, however, is that when they were\ntaken to the detention -- to -- to the offices of the -- of the Gestapo, and -- and the\nnames are very well known, the two or three Jews, including this horrible man named\nHasson, who was a terrible collaborator with the Nazis, who made it his job to go and\ndiscover hiding Jews, and -- and -- and -- and capture them. So in -- in -- no one\nknows, really who -- single person, or other people who did the da -- see -- see -- see --\none of the unknowns.",
        "Q: When your mother was taken and -- well your, your mother with the -- the -- your\nbrothers and --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: -- 1s a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsaac Nehama. This is tape number two, side A. I was interested in knowing when\nyour mother was taken for questioning, with your family, where they were -- where\nthey -- that Gestapo questioning would take place.",
        "A: Yes, according to Sam, he -- they were taken to Gestapo headquarters. Now, let\u2019s\nnot think that they really went to the office of the chief of the Gestapo in Athens. The\nger -- the Germans, they had a -- a major office building in the center of Athens, not\nvery far from Constitution Square, which was known as the commandatura, which was\na c-combined office of the headquarters of the German occupation forces 1n -- in\nAthens, the Gestapo had. And because it was a large office building, it had also a -- a\nlarge basement. That\u2019s where they were -- they were taken for interrogation. Let me\njust simply tell you that I don\u2019t know if it is -- what kind of poetic justice, or anything\nlike this, when I was taken by the gendarmerie after -- that\u2019s where I was taken, in the\nsame place. But that\u2019s where they were taken.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, to what does Sam attribute his having survived?",
        "A: We have ta-talked about that. I think essentially, one -- if one has to take a single\nreason -- well, first of all, let\u2019s say two. One that at their arrival in Auschwitz, 1n the\nmorning of August 16, of 1944, parathetically -- can I say how I -- we know that? Yes,\nbecause I looked at the da -- the so-called danuta Auschwitz chronicles as they are\nknown, which is entries, almost like a diary every day of oc-occurrences. And the\nentry for August 16, it talks about the almost 2000 Rhodesian Jews. It doesn\u2019t tell the\ncomplete story, there were another har -- 600 non-Rhodesian Jews among them, my\nmother and -- and -- and brothers. They arrived there, and in the -- this of course,\nfamous separation, the re -- the single reason that he was moved to -- towards the labor\ncamp, was because of his height. He was only -- \u201944 -- he was 14 years old, but he was\na lot taller than his age, and he also credits the fact that the month detention in Hidari\noutside of Athens before the transport, where he was forced to do stupid, meaningless\nlabor of moving rocks from one place to the other, had -- and the food was good, also,\nthere, amazing because it was the Red Cross who were feeding them, that he -- he\ngained enough muscle so that in the separation, he was then pointed to be taken to\nlabor -- all right -- to the labor camp. Once then in the labor camp, after the famous\nthree or four weeks of so-called quarantine, then he was taken to a section of\nAuschwitz called the boodi, which was a set of farms that were being worked on by a\ncombination of Polish and German farmers, and the inmates were doing the -- the hard\nlabor. But the survival in boodi, in particular then the survival in the famous Death\nMarch in the winter of \u201945, when Auschwitz got shut down because of the Russians\ncoming in, and they were taken elsewhere. Sam credits it to the care of older men, who\ntook him, as they did also other, younger kids, under their wings. In particular in\nprotecting them about -- especially what not to do. And what to be a-a-aware of,\nbecause as we know, human beings in those circumstances did terrible things to each\nother, stealing bread, just sort of pure survival. So he believes very strongly that one or\ntwo people took him also under their wing, and -- and it was through them that he was\nable to survive.",
        "Q: I\u2019m interested in also in knowing of the roles you as brothers fulfilled later, as the\neldest son, and the winner of a scholarship, you came to the United States, Sam stayed\nwith your father, and I -- I\u2019m guessing that he felt an obligation to be -- to spend his\nlife close to your father, emigrating after your father\u2019s death. I just wondered if you\nfelt that you were a -- a cornerstone of the family, sort of succeeding in the -- in your\nnew life, but fulfilling one critical role?",
        "A: Well, re-re-recall that I came to the United States on a student scholarship,\ntherefore believing that after my studies were over, I would return to Greece, and\nresume my life there. Why Sam stayed, I have really mulled this very much, and I -- I -\n- I don\u2019t have a -- a -- you know, an answer that I can be a hundred percent sure, but\nboth my parents were really maniacal, I think, about making sure that we were well --\nwell educated. I -- the decision for me to become an engineer was cast at the -- I think\nthe moment I was born, I think, f -- by my father in particular.",
        "Q: Not a currency trader.",
        "A: R-Right, right. Or -- or an accountant, as -- as he was. And I think that there was a -\n- a particular event. In 1952, Sam had, I think, just barely finished high school. He --\nhe may have been thinking -- I think he did, about going to university, possibly for\ncommercial studies. But at the same time, coincidentally, my father retired from his\noccupation of -- his job that had gone on for 40 years, practically. And there were no\npension plans as we know them here, but he was given a large final severance amount,\nwhich he then decided to -- to -- to use to invest in going into business with somebody\nwho actually was the brother of my stepmother. My father had remarried, and so he\nstarted this business, and I think -- I think -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m almost sure, that it isn\u2019t that my\nfather didn\u2019t push Sam to continue, or to -- to -- to pursue university work, but starting\na business, he thought that it would be a wonderful thing to bring my brother in, so\nthat he would also learn the business, and grow with it, and eventually of course,\ninherit it. Unfortunately, it failed for many, many reasons, including the fact that my\nfather, while he was a wonderful accountant, was not a businessman. Plus also that his\nbrother-in-law and partner turned out to be a crook. And -- and in -- in the meantime\nthen, Sam had also married, and that\u2019s why I think he stayed.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. It wasn\u2019t a matter of his feeling that he was forfeiting the opportunity to\njoin you, perhaps?",
        "A: No, look, although by the time I left, and I -- I know now that my father had started\nall his efforts to secure a scholarship for me, or -- or some means for me to go and\nstudy abroad. He even wrote letters to Churchill, inflating -- I mean, the truth, beyond\n-- you know, any conceivable acceptable level of -- of -- of -- of recognition. It\u2019s true\nthat at one time, during the occupation, two Jews of the British army, that had, you\nknow, been stranded in Greece, and were hiding, w -- they -- we -- hi -- hid them in\nour house for overnight. In his letter to Churchill, he inflated these [indecipherable |\narrangement of British troops, and -- and -- and he was asking for no compensation of\nany kind, other then op -- an opportunity for his son to have an opportunity to study in\nEngland, if possible. The fact is that also he was starting the same thing with B\u2019nai\nBrith, because he was a member of the B\u2019nai Brith. In -- in fact, he kept all of these\nthings totally secret from me. I had no idea what was happening until one -- when it\nwas a done deal, essentially, and he told me at one time. And actually, my first\nreaction was to -- to say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to her -- leave you.\u201d You know. I\u2019m saying\nall of that -- forgive again the detour -- to tell you that -- I mean, my leaving, and --\nand -- and his decision that I go and study abroad, the sacrifices that my father would\nundergo to see his son educated, had no bounds. And I think that under other\ncircumstances, he would have pushed Sam to do the same thing, even if then that\nmeant that he would be left alone, you know, with two sons away. But as I said, the --\nthe -- this maniacal thing for education was so strong, the only countervaley thing, I\nthink was that -- that -- that coincidentally he was starting a business, and therefore he\nsaw that there was another avenue that would be open for my brother to advance. I\nspeculate -- and I was telling this to my wife last night, that if my mother had been\nalive, Sam would not have gone into that business, she would have pushed him,\nregardless, to go and -- and -- and -- and study.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, your story of your father\u2019s efforts on your behalf, cause I was\nthinking of when you were -- when you went to Libya, he had intervened then, and --\nsuccessfully, I think, either was a New York Times reporter that --",
        "A: Yes, well not -- not -- yes, of course, 1-1 -- my father immediately then contacted a\ncousin -- our cousins, and it was they who then knew the Times\u2019 correspondent who\nthen talked to -- to the archbishop, Thamaskinos. And it was that way that I was -- I\nwas set free.",
        "Q: Yeah, anyway, they\u2019re wonderful stories of a father\u2019s determination. Now, at this\ntime, would many of the Jews of Athens have been thinking actively of leaving for\neither Palestine or the United States?",
        "A: Very well -- ah, I -- I saw that question, I was laughing a little bit because I have --\nI have to tell you what -- what happened. There was not, as in for example, Bulgaria.\nYou know, in spite of all the talk about the Bulgarians saving 50,000 Jews, it\u2019s true\nthat -- that they were not killed, but not what then the Bulgarians began to claim. But\nthe Bulgarians, as you know, marched with their feet, and -- and from 48,000, there are\nonly 3000 left. There was less of the mass exodus from Greece, but th -- recall also,\nthat out of a population of 77,000 pre-war, only about six or 7000 survived. And I\nthink in one of your questions was how many wer -- were sheltered. The best numbers\nthat one has, about five or 6000 found shelter, either with Greek Christian families, or\nin the mountains. I don\u2019t mean the resistance, they just went up there, and were able to\nhide and lose themselves in -- in the population in the parts of Greece that they were\nknown as free Greece, which included the region where I was. About 1300 were the --\nin the resistance, in any case. But very shortly -- I mean, mid \u201945, immediately we had\nvisitors from Israel, and I still remember young Israelis, but Greek speaking Israelis,\nbut totally different, and -- and darkened from sun, and -- and full of muscle, and --\npeasants. I mean, things out there that you don\u2019t necessarily associate with the\nappearance of -- of -- of Jews, especially those that live in cities who are -- live soft\nlives. In any case, they had been sent on purpose to recruit young men to come to\nIsrael. And as you know, they did. Quite a few were then sent to what\u2019s called\nAkshara, which was sort of a preparatory school for three or four weeks, to teach the\nrudiments of living in a kibbutz. And then it was -- all of 1t was clandestine, because\none night, in -- at night -- and they were taken by boat to ships that were not in\nterritorial Greek waters, and there they were taken, and then taken to Greece again in\nsecret, because they didn\u2019t come as part of the British quotas, they were trying to\nviolate. And some of them were caught and incarcerated in Cypress, in any case. So I -\n- I was, and some of my friends, lobbied intensely by the Israelis to come to Palestine,\nbut the reason I\u2019m laughing 1s -- y-you -- it\u2019s -- I recollect, and -- and I -- I think it\u2019s so\nunreal. Most of our preoccupation in questi -- questioning the Israelis about what kind\nof government are we going to have, if eventually a state is formed. Because our\nexperience, you know, in the mountains, and things like this is we need to be\ndemocratic, and you know, almost Socialistic, and things like -- th-the Israelis would\nlook at us as though w-we were nuts, and say, \u201cLook, w-we have many things to do\nbefore w-we come to that point. The first thing to do is to try to -- to make sure that we\nbecome a state. When we become a state, then people will ha -- will -- will vote,\u201d and -\n- and we were surely looking for reassurances ahead of time. Well, and that was --\nthere was a very strong thing. The reason I didn\u2019t become extremely serious, you\nknow, to the point of taking action, what they say -- first of all, A, I couldn\u2019t leave my\nfather. Sam had not even yet appeared on the scene when these events of the contact\nwith the Israelis occurred. Sam had not e -- yet returned, number one, and two, of\ncourse, the Israelis had departed, and then of course the British clamped down, and it\nwasn\u2019t even possible to do that any more. And then of course, my departure from the\nUnited States, you know, made this thing a moot point. But yes, there was a very\nstrong period of I would say two or three months, where practically I got on the boat to\ngo to Palestine.",
        "Q: Now, how much of an honor was it to have that B\u2019nai Brith scholarship? W-Were\nthere -- were there many of them, or very few?",
        "A: Right. The first two were my scholarship, and -- and my second cousin, Jeff Levis.\nWe left at the same time. First of all we -- even after everything was put 1n place -- you\nknow, in addition to all the paperwork, visas, this and the other, examination by the\nAmerican consul that we were at least mildly proficient in -- in English, enough to --\nto claim that we were going to go and study in -- in an American university. But the\nmajor th -- thing that -- that -- that -- that one had to wait for -- and that nothing could\nbe done about it, was to wait for passage, because there were no -- there was not much\nshipping still, it hadn\u2019t been fully restored. So it took about another four or five\nmonths of waiting to get booking on -- on a ship. So there were two -- it wasn\u2019t done\non the basis, let\u2019s say, of competition.

Although it was B\u2019nai Brith money, which it certainly didn\u2019t last\nmore than one year. And I didn\u2019t know that. And -- and the only reason I was able to\ncontinue was because the university then picked up the -- the sc -- the scholarship. So\nthat\u2019s how it happened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Then how did you travel to the United States, by boat?",
        "A: Well by -- by boat, yes. The Volcania. It was two Italian ships that had been used\nduring the war as transports. It had a sister ship called -- Volcania -- not -- not\nLusitania, but it\u2019s is -- same Italian -- kind of Italian name, I\u2019ll -- \u20191l remember in a\nmoment. It took about 13 to 14 days because we stopped in Genoa to pick up other\npassengers, and -- you know, it wasn\u2019t a very fast ship. And it took about, you know,\nmaybe 12 days to get to the United States.",
        "Q: What did you take with you? And you thought then you would be there for several\nyears, for the degree.",
        "A: F-For at least four years, for any -- four years, for at least four years. Well, of\ncourse, other than -- than items of clothing, I took very little else. Two or three\nmementos. First of all, for the man who sponsored me, who had to sign an affidavit of\nsupport as it was called, who I never met in my life, he lived in Kalamazoo, Michigan,\nhis name was Osias Souvairdling, my father gave me a present to give him, which was\n-- must have been a very dear thing for him, it was a -- a cigarette case. He didn\u2019t even\nknow if the man smoked, but it was really done of silver filigree, I think of -- of -- of\nwire, intricately done, and which I eventually sent to Mr. Souvairdling to thank him\nprofoundly, when ha -- as I say, we never met. And so we came to New York, we\nstopped for three or four days, seeing relatives in New York. Jeff had a --",
        "Q: And that would be -- you had a -- your father\u2019s brother.",
        "A: Yes, Benjamin, and I stayed with him overnight. And then -- after all, we were also\nlate, because it was end of October, and this -- and the semester had already started, so\nwe were already a month and a half late. So we left New York to go to Chicago, and in\nChicago then we parted because, you see, both of us had no choice, we were not given\na choice about what schools to attend. We each told what we wanted to study and\nB\u2019nai Brith then found the appropriate schools. I was then sent to the University of\nIllinois. So in Chicago we said good-bye to each other, I took the train down to\nChampagne, and he took the train to Iowa, because he went to Iowa State.",
        "Q: And what are your memories of, the first impressions, of New York, of your\nuncle\u2019s home, of Illinois?",
        "A: Well, all right, they were distinct. New York was of course something that only one\nsaw in pictures, and in books, and still one had to -- to -- to really marvel at the c -- the\n-- the -- the sorts of things tha-that were hard to even imagine. Taken to the automat\nfor example, I mean, the idea of pushing a nickel and then being served a meal was --\nyou know, not only strange, but for -- for -- especially mechanically minded people\nlike myself. In Illinois it was very different because, you know, I arrived there the\nnight in -- on November the third or fourth of \u201946. It happened to be the day before the\nsemi -- the -- the biennial elections -- not presidential, but for two-thirds of the Senate,\nand the whole House of Representatives. And -- and -- and -- you know, naively, and -\n- and -- and I found out the following day that at that time, easily, about half of the\npeople in the fraternity where I was being given room and board -- which was another\nthing that the B\u2019nai Brith had arranged for me to do at the AEPi house, the majority of\nthem were veterans themselves, fliers, soldiers. And then when I asked them are they\nvoting tomorrow in the elections, and they said, \u201cWhat elections?\u201d I was -- it was the\nbiggest, first initial shock in my life, because one in Europe associated political\nawareness and movement always with university students. That\u2019s where also the\nferment would take place. And to -- to find out that the supreme indifference, and --\nand a -- and e-eventually, this 1s -- became really, from -- from a critical thing, became\nan endearing aspect of American life, that I liked.",
        "Q: What is it they say, if all 1s going well, you don\u2019t need to vote, but --",
        "A: [indecipherable] or something like that. Or -- or maybe the other thing that all\npoliticians are -- are -- are -- are not worth paying attention to.",
        "Q: How difficult was your adjustment to life at -- that would be Urbana, Champagne. I\nwas just thinking of language, and then all the other adjustments.",
        "A: Well, all right, language of course was really a bit of a problem, but it didn\u2019t take\nme very long to -- to acquire language. The nice thing a -- the ni -- the good aspect --\nnot the good, the -- the -- the tolerable aspect was that for engineering, really language\nwas not that essential. Or at least a very strong component. Some of the first courses\none had to take, which first of all amazed me, was that I had to take, you know,\nalgebra. Algebra. I had gone to a special high school in -- in Greece, preparatory to\nentering the Polytechnic Institute. What is -- algebra was already a foregone thing.\nAnd in fact, the first day I got to -- to that class, and I\u2019m sitting there, and -- and -- and\nI see the instructor laboring over a formula, and -- and -- and very diffidently I asked if\nI could show another way, and I went, and then I showed the solution, and afterwards,\nat the end of the session, he asked me to stay back, and he said he knew about my\narrival, and he knew that I was -- I came from Europe and education was stronger\nthere, and he asked me not to come back again. He says, \u201cIll give you an A, don\u2019t\nshow up in class any more.\u201d So I was able to overcome that. So I -- I believe that --\nthat I had some facility for languages, and so it didn\u2019t become that much of an\nobstacle.",
        "Q: What -- what were the most difficult areas of adjustment? I mean, were there --\nwere there cultural things that were hard? I mean, were you nostalgic for Greek food,\ndid you miss your friends and family badly?",
        "A: Really, I must a-admit that -- that -- that except for occasional bouts of -- not\nloneliness, of not really being with a relative or a friend, but there was so much to\nabsorb from every aspect. Life in it\u2019s little ins -- insignificant a-aspects, wa -- the\nshops, the stores, university life. Life in a fraternity, what young people did, what\ninterested them. It is -- it was so -- so -- there was practically no time to really begin to\nfeel any deprivation at all. The first time that happened was at the end of the first year,\nwhen suddenly the summer vacation [indecipherable] what am I gonna do?",
        "Q: And you were 20 then?",
        "A: Yes. So I really went to New York, and stayed with my uncle, and I was working in\nhis factory, he was a manufacturer of dresses. Well, when the people in B\u2019nai Brith\nfound out that that\u2019s what I was doing, they were horrified. I don\u2019t know why. So then\nthey arranged for me to go to a special camp that was run by the Quakers. They had\nsix or seven of them around the country, but typically what it would be, the Quakers --\nthe Friends -- the American Friends Service Committee would invite f -- foreign\nstudents, about 35 to 40, put them in a place, usually a -- a private school, the grounds\nfor a private school that -- since it was vacation time, and we would stay there for\nalmost eight weeks, and the idea was to talk about life and -- and f-foreign affairs, and\nthings like this, and we had every week some prominent individual from the\nuniversity, a professor would come, or -- either of political science, or psychology, and\nhe would lecture, and he would hold a -- a -- a -- a -- discussions under a tree. You\nknow, kind of a thing and exchange ideas. And then of course, play games, go\nswimming, and things like this, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s how tha -- th-th -- it was a first time\nwhen I suddenly found myself almost detached because the -- the house, the fraternity\nhouse closed, school was closed, I was going to go to summer school. And that\u2019s the\nfirst time that it hit me that now I\u2019m again alone and on my own.",
        "Q: What was your fraternity experience like?",
        "A: Well, since I had no -- I had a brief semester which I went to the Polytechnic and\nstill living at home, I -- I don\u2019t want to say it was strange, or -- or -- everything was\nstrange for me, everything was new, and I had nothing to compare -- of course I had\nthen, eventually a -- other schoolmates who didn\u2019t live in fraternities, who lived in\ndorms, or who lived in -- in rooming houses. What -- what I found --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Isaac Nehama. This is tape number two, side B. What was the fraternity\nexperience like?",
        "A: Well, as I said, I guess, since it was all new, I had to -- to absorb and ac -- and sort\nof accept, because I had no other frame of reference against which to compare. The\nonly thing that certainly was a bit peculiar, at least to me, was that so much time was\nspent in -- in games, and recreation, as compared to study. But even within this type of\nenvironment, one was not obligated to do anything. I mean, there were certain events\nthat one had to participate in, but what one did with one\u2019s free time, it was up to\nindividual. So again it was -- 1t was a very good introduction to an aspect of American\nlife, namely that you don\u2019t have to conform to exactly a particular pattern. It was some\nof it you had to do, some of it was entirely voluntary. And I -- I know that there were\nsome fraternity brothers who were Americans, and who, like me, did not participate in\nall the games, and superficial other activities, and who were much more serious in\nstudies, and things like that.",
        "Q: It would have given you acceptance by a group, and I wondered if that was a very\ngood feeling for a newcomer?",
        "A: Yes, and again, since I have no other way to compare it, I would have to ask myself\nwhere if I had simply had a room in it, or -- or a place in a dorm, or -- or -- or ina\nrooming house, would I be able to, al-almost in one fell swoop, be a brother to f -- to\n40 or 50 other people? I-It wouldn\u2019t have happened.",
        "Q: Yeah, it seems to me it was interesting that that was arranged.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I wondered too, when you were later in the U.S. army, years later, were there\nany similarities with your fraternity days? I -- I was just simply thinking of group\nacceptance.",
        "A: None, none. Of course, there -- there is a similarity, you know, whenever groups of\npeople do similar things together, there are ties and camaraderies, and of course I leave\nout a big -- I was in the mountains, that\u2019s a different story, and participated in an\naction, and so forth, but in the American army I was not in any battle situation.\nBecause there is a special ties that get formed when people share dangers. In the army,\nwhat was shared in the beginning was, during basic training, where you undergo a\nmixture of both discipline that 1s -- has some meaning, and a lot of mindless nonsense,\nwhich has even particular words in the -- in American army that we will not mention\nnow in -- you know, the tape.",
        "Q: Now, what fraternity was it, and what were the usual characteristics of that\nfraternity?",
        "A: All right, the fraternity was called AEPi, Alpha Epsilon Pi. It was a Jewish\nfraternity, one of about, if I recall at that time, either five or six Jewish fraternities on\nthe Champagne Urbana campus of the University of Illinois.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- and most of, I think of the 40 or 50 individuals, me -- students at that time, I\nthink 90 percent were residents of Illinois from various parts, mostly from Chicago.\nAnd the rest were really from practically other parts of the country, there were three or\nfour New Yorkers, one from -- two from outside of Boston. And obviously I was -- I\nwas the only -- the only foreigner.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you experience any anti-Semitism on the campus in general, or in\nthose years? Were you a -- aware of any\u201d?",
        "A: None. None.",
        "Q: Tell me more then -- let\u2019s go on to your -- your studies. Y -- it seems your\nadjustment was very straightforward. You did your first degree, and you stayed on at\nIllinois for your later degrees?",
        "A: Right, yes. After finishing the Bachelor\u2019s degree, 1 -- it coincided with the advent of\nthe Korean war, 1950. When I got my Bachelor\u2019s degree, then that summer, the war in\nKorea started. A -- a number of friends and so forth, who thought they were be of\nimminent draftable age, did a number of things, including going to graduate school\nwhich they never thought or intended to go, in order to get deferments. Other even\nwent to the length of quickly getting married, so they would be supporters of family.\nAnd then I -- I was told that I would be given a -- an assistanceship, a research\nassistanceship to continue to graduate school, which then enabled me to go through the\nMaster\u2019s degree. Then I decided to continue on for the doctorate. And I went for the\nadditional year, including then taking the oral exams. And the oral exams were -- were\n-- took place on June third, 1953, the date of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. So I\npassed the oral. So what was left to d -- to -- to do was to write the thesis, and in fact\nmy advisor and I had selected the topic, but I had run out of money. And there was no\n-- the assist-assistanceship funding was over. So it was a question of how I mi -- a --\ngoing to be able to support myself. My professor had arranged for me -- my advisor to\nwork for the summer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, just for the summer. And then,\nafter taking the orals, I was offered a permanent position at Bell Laboratories. Well, I\ntalked to my professor, and he said, \u201cAll right, it\u2019s a little -- rarely done, but it can be\ndone. You can arrange for to write the thesis in absentia.\u201d Which was the plan.\nUnfortunately I was drafted a year later, and -- although after my release from the\narmy, I intended to continue on -- to try to -- to write the thesis by -- in the meantime,\nat the University of Illinois, they stopped allowing thesis to be written in absentia,\nbecause of pressure from the legislature. And that sort of put an end to -- to that quest.",
        "Q: Yeah, what did you write your thesis on?",
        "A: What I was going to write the thesis on.",
        "Q: Well, yeah what -- what were you planning earlier, to write it on.",
        "A: Well, the topic we had selected was this, the realization of electrical networks, with\nreal components.",
        "Q: And did you work -- I mean, wa-was that an area you pursued in your work later?",
        "A: A little bit, because since I was drafted, less tha -- in about a year after my starting\narm -- permanent position at Bell Laboratories, there was a two year a -- in -- almost\ntwo years intervening in the army. When I returned, I changed departments, and I\njoined a completely brand new department, which really was going to, and did the\nwork in -- in -- in the totally new generation of telephone exchanges, digital instead of\nthe older variety. Which almost had nothing to do whatsoever with any of the special\nacademic interests that I had. It was -- it was a new universe, essentially of computers,\nand that\u2019s what to -- got me into that field.",
        "Q: Yeah. Going back to the army, now had you become an American citizen earlier?\nYou came here as a Yugoslav.",
        "A: Right. This is something that we have not covered at all because it was not covered\nin the earlier interview. While I -- I was studying for the orals, in April of 40 thre -- 40\n-- of \u00b053, my landlady tells me that somebody\u2019s -- wants to talk to me, a gentleman\nappears, hands me a letter, I open it up, it\u2019s from the immigration naturalization\nservice, I\u2019m to depart United States within two weeks. Why? He says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m only\nthe messenger.\u201d Well, you can understand my state of mind. I got on the train, went to\nChicago where I had friends, told them the situation. The long and the short is they\nintervened. I mean, they got me to talk to a congressman, who then talked to the\nimmigration department, immigration department renewed my stay for another year.\nSo I thought that was going to be the end of that, right? Without my knowing -- I had\ntold one of my professors what had happened , and while I was in Chicago, and even\nafter my return two or three days later, without my knowing, four professors wrote to\nthe then Senator Dograss of Illinois, who introduced a private bill in congress, and\neventually became a law, known as the law for the relief of Isaac Ne-Nehama. It was\nsigned by President Eisenhower, and by law I became a -- I was accepted as an\nimmigrant, outside of the student visa restrictions, because student visa is a restricted\nclass, where you are not allowed to -- to stay permanently. So I was now, because of\nthe special bill, I was now a special -- a -- a -- an immigrant. So I would have to wait\nfor my five years, you know, to be -- to gain citizenship. But being inducted into the\narmy, automatically within six months, then you become a citizen, for the very\nobvious reason that a country cannot ask you to defend it, and at the same time not\nrecognizing you as a citizen.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So I became a naturalized citizen in Colorado Springs, Colorado.",
        "Q: Yeah, now -- and they intervened on your behalf with that private legislation, just\nyou were a promising student, and they felt it was an injustice?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m eve -- I\u2019m very embarrassed to read the -- because I was\ninvestigated by the FBI, I mean, they had to go and interview them, and the glowing\nterms, I mean, make me blush even today when I read them.",
        "Q: And then after serving in the army, you returned to Bell Labs, and continued to\nwork in this exciting new field?",
        "A: Right. But 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- a personal aspect of my life is that it -- that just before I\nwent in the army, I got married. In fact, I lived with my first wife in Colorado Springs,\nbecause after basic training in New Jersey, I was then sent to the fifth army\u2019s headq --\nschool -- signal school in Colorado Springs. And since in the army it\u2019s very important\n-- Or even more important what you don\u2019t do, than what you do, instead of cleaning\npots or -- or -- or being in the trenches, I was teaching in the signal school, reserve\nofficers who were passing every three months, to take refresher courses in radio,\ntelephony, and things like that. So that\u2019s where I spent my -- my two years. Upon our\nreturn then, to New Jersey, I resumed my work at Bell Laboratories, but then there was\na -- arift, and in 1957, I was divorced.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Tell me about your first wife, what was her name and her background, and\nwhere you met, and so on.",
        "A: Her name was Ann Greenberg. I -- I -- I -- two summers -- after the first summer I\nmentioned to you earlier, with the Quaker camp, I worked in the Poconos in a camp\nfor boys and girls, as a waiter, to earn pocket money. And was very often sufficient to\n-- to -- to allow me to buy a -- an occasional movie ticket. Because the scholarship just\nsimply provided room and board, nothing else. But then I had a friend and when\nfinally I wa -- began to start working at Bell Laboratories stationed in New York City,\nthen this friend that I had met in the camp told me about a young lady who was an --\nan -- a friend of hers, and that\u2019s how I -- I met Ann. And so we were going out\ntogether, and in fact when I got my notice from the draft board to present myself for\ntraining, Ann -- I can only tell you subs -- from subsequent information -- her own\nparents were divorced, it was a -- arather unhappy marriage, and she convinced me. I\nmaybe n-not have taken a lot of convincing, I was a little bit hesitant because, you\nknow, going into the army, goodness knows where I could be shipped. But she was\npersuasive enough to tell me that she would accompany me wherever we went, if it\n[indecipherable] allowed. The long and the short is we -- we got married. And she\nwent to school in Colorado Springs, at the university because she eventually intended\nto go to medical school. When we return, lived in New Jersey, she enrolled at NYU.\nAnd she was -- began to have problems. First of all, academic problems, and then one\nday she disappeared. The long and the short is I found out through a physician who\nwas -- knew her from -- since childhood, that according to him, she was a\nschizophrenic. And he -- who -- and this -- this man urged me to simply get away as\nfast as I could. I was -- my reaction was, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re just telling me that I\u2019m\ndealing with a sick person, and you\u2019re telling me to abandon a sick person?\u201d But he\nconvinced me that it\u2019s the kind of a thing that has no hope for -- for cure, and -- and it\nwould have been almost an impossibility. The long and the short is that I got a quick\ndivorce in Mexico. It was consensual, it wasn\u2019t contested or anything like that. That\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. On to the next part of the story, yeah.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: W -- y -- in your years with Bell Labs, I\u2019m sure there were particular successes, and\ndifficulties, and -- I mean, how do you look back on those years, and what would you\nhave us know\u201d?",
        "A: All right, all right. Well, you know, there was always a kind of phrase to describe\nthe Bell system. We used to refer to 1 -- 1 -- to it as -- collectively as Mother Bell. So\none can conjure up a -- an older woman, rather buxom, you know. Warm, that you feel\nwarm in -- in -- in -- in -- near her. Well, in other words, 1t was a magnificent\npreparation for a career, because first of all you -- you were among individuals of\nextreme capability. Bell Laboratories recruited only the upper one percent of graduates\nin American universities. So there were no idiots there, and -- and you couldn\u2019t really\nmake it through with hot air, you would be found out right away. So it was a -- a very,\nvery demanding -- well, not demanding, but -- but really very mar-marvelous\npreparation. By the same token, it was a -- an extremely inbred thing. We -- we\nthought collectively that we knew everything. And -- so in -- there was a little bit of a\nstruggle because there was no formal thing. My dreams always were that when I\nstarted my career, I would be taken under the wing of an experienced person who\nwould take me slowly through the -- and it didn\u2019t happen. It isn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t learn\nthings from colleagues, I did, a great deal. But there was no former -- you were\nessentially left on your own. And there came times I think almost three or four weeks\nafter I started, that I really had terrible time believing that I was earning my paycheck\nunder false pretenses. That -- that I wasn\u2019t doing anything valuable. But I very quickly\ngot over that, because I began to do serious things. And then I got drafted, and I return,\na-and -- and then it happened that we were working on the first field trial of this first\never new telephone exchange, what has taken Bell Laboratories biggest department of\n400 people, six or seven years to prepare for the field trial in Modess, Illinois. And I\nstarted the -- the -- the system, and I came to the conclusion that it will not work. Not -\n- not that it will not work, that it -- it would not accommodate the kind of capacity that\nit was aimed to, something like 20,000 or 40,000 subscribers. My analysis showed that\nit would barely make it for 2000 subscribers. Well, it was solid enough thing that my\nown supervisor believed it, and f -- you know, typically then I was -- I gave it a -- a\npresentation. And of course the first reaction was one of horrible shock and -- and --\nand -- and -- and disdain, but the stuff was solid enough, and that was -- I became a --\nimmediately a rising star. I was almost, I think, thrown out into the street, and within a\nweek I became a fair haired boy, and I got promoted, became a first promotion\nsupervisor. But then I got the notion, a year after I became promoted that I really\nwanted to be in a higher stratum of research, and I left and went to the Rand\nCorporation in California, where I was going to work, believe it or not, it was a joke,\nreally to [indecipherable] subsequently on artificial intelligence, because two people\nwho had written some papers, told me that they had funding from the Air Force to start\nan effort, and I wanted to be a participant there. When I got there, simply the -- the\nplans were totally different, never as I said, and that experience at Rand was, in itself\nof a different kind, but equally rewarding. Your --",
        "Q: And how long did you stay with Rand?",
        "A: I stayed for two years. Then one f -- day I got a call from my former boss at Bell\nLaboratories, who was ready to retire, and who told me that the Bell system had been\nasked by the government to assist the government in the Apollo program. And he was\nsimply asking me where I would talk to him. And he asked me not to hang up on him.\nI said, \u201cI respect you too much to do that.\u201d The long and the short 1s they -- and I\u2019m\ntalking about -- I -- but I don\u2019t know anything about rockets is what -- I don\u2019t know\neither, and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m 65 and I\u2019m willing to learn. The long and the short 1s that -- do\nyou want to hear a interesting story?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: All right, good. I -- because I had a lot of leave coming, I flew to east, I spoke to\nthem, I came back, I spoke with Paulette, and I decided to reject their offer, that I was\nhappy what I was doing at Rand. That was a weekend. On Monday I go back to my\noffice at Rand, and the telephone rings, and it\u2019s the secretary of the president of the\nRand corporation. She says, \u201cFrank Wright to see you.\u201d I had met him once. What\u2019s\nthe president to do with me? I go to his office, he greets me, he says, \u201cI -- I understand\nyou\u2019re considering leaving us.\u201d I was, you know, f -- absolutely -- you know, and it\nshowed in my face. H-He saw it, he says, \u201cW-W-Wait,\u201d he said. \u201cit isn\u2019t anything\nnefarious, we don\u2019t have a -- a secret police. It\u2019s very simple. Julian West,\u201d who was\nthe vice president at Bell Laboratories with whom I had talked to that previous day or\ntwo, \u201cis a West Point classmate of mind, and he called me, he told me that they want\nyou. And so what do you think you are doing?\u201d So I told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to stay.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cFantastic.\u201d I sit down, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Well. He said, \u201cAnd what do you\nthink of the Apollo program?\u201d So I began to say, \u201cWell, this is probably the biggest\nthing since the building of the pyramids, the greatest,\u201d -- so I didn\u2019t know that he was\nalmost setting a -- a -- a trap, and I was waxing so eloquently about, you know, going\nto the moon. Then he said, \u201cI -- I th -- I think like you do.\u201d He says, \u201cLet m -- let me\ntell you -- let\u2019s do the following,\u201d he says. \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go? Within -- because if\nyou don\u2019t, you may regret it later that you didn\u2019t participate. But you go, and within\ntwo or three months, you will know whether it\u2019s really s-suits you. If 1t doesn\u2019t, come\nback. There\u2019|l always be a place for you here.\u201d\u201d What a wise individual. So I -- I --",
        "Q: An inter -- it is an interesting story.",
        "A: [indecipherable] and that was the end of it. I -- I didn\u2019t return.",
        "Q: So that you then continued to work on the Apollo program?",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "Q: Oh, well.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s why we came to -- to Washington.",
        "Q: Well tell me for how long you worked on it, and --",
        "A: Yes, from 1962, till 1968. And this is at what -- at that point where already the\nplans for Apollo already had matured. My department -- I was head of one of the five\ndepartments in the company. We were already beginning to think about voyages to\nMars, believe it or not. But another opportunity o -- arose. A friend of this boss of\nmine, who re -- who attracted me back to the -- to -- to the Bell system, then had a -- a\n-- a wealthy individual friend who lived in f -- in Philadelphia, and who was willing to\nfund new companies. And the long and the short is that I left the Bell system, and I\nfounded my own company.",
        "Q: This is very fascinating, I thought you\u2019d had a career, you know, an unbroken\ncareer with Bell Lab.",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: And this would have been a very exciting time with the Apollo program.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s an unmistakable time because I don\u2019t -- it ha -- is -- 1t has been studied, it\nhas been written up, namely how so much enthusiasm, because fo -- you could see --\nand I traveled a great deal, because this program was all over the United States, we\ndidn\u2019t think about nine to five, or working hours, weekends. The enthusiasm there, of\ngoing and doing something like this was so [indecipherable] and -- and -- and -- and it\n-- it encompassed practically hundreds of thousands of engineers, and -- and people\naround the country. The enthusiasm was -- was great. It has not been replicated. But if\nI may tell you that things like this have occurred, and I can assure you that I have not\nreally been an instrument in choosing the situations, but throughout my career, Bell\nLaboratories, the new telephone system, then the Apollo program, the Rand\nCorporation artificial intelligence. In other words, what I\u2019m trying to emphasize is that\nthese things occur both in companies as well as 1n -- even in countries, very rarely,\nwhere you undertake something where there is no precedent. Because when you are in\nsituations like this, then ideas flow freely. When you are in a -- 1n a environment with\na lot of tradition, and you say, \u201cWell, what about this thing?\u201d Then they\u2019ll say, \u201cLook,\nwe ve tried that.\u201d Or, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like this around here.\u201d When you are in a\nnew situation, then all ideas are given free reign. Now, all of them are not equally\ngood, and some could be good, or even better than what was -- which -- which was in,\nbut even countries don\u2019t have the luxury of pursuing two or three avenues in parallel.\nSo to be in a -- in -- in a -- in a -- in an environment like this, it\u2019s the -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nalmost like getting drunk, or smoking -- which I don\u2019t know what smoking pot or any\nof these things would be, but it\u2019s -- I remember the early 50\u2019s in the Bell Laboratories.\nUnless you are either under narcosis or an utter idiot, you couldn\u2019t help but stumble on\nnew inventions, on new ideas. It was a kind of a ferment that occurs very, very\ninfrequently in the lives of companies, or the survivors in -- in even the\n[indecipherable]. Somehow it occurred two or three times 1n my career. None because\nI chose them like this, just pure luck.",
        "Q: Yeah, so you\u2019ve been very privileged --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- to be in these sort of intellectually exciting --",
        "A: Right. Yes.",
        "Q: -- areas. Now, when you would be with the Apollo program, how would that fit\nwith Sputnik? I mean that -- Sputnik would have happened, and have --",
        "A: Oh yeah, [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- Kennedy, yes, and -- and we would have been sort of fast and furiously pursuing\nspace flight --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- just at the time you\u2019d be -- yeah, well --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- you\u2019d be working on part of that program.",
        "A: Well, Apollo was -- was -- was -- was done on purpose by the Kennedy speech in\nCongress --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- to send a man to the moon. The fact that it was done not so much in response to\nSputnik alone. I mean, we were pursuing manned space flight. The Russians beat us by\na year, but as events eventually showed, really, eventually the a -- the American\ntechnological superiority is what made -- made the difference.",
        "Q: Yeah, and a -- but -- was it -- well, I was just thinking of reading about someone\nnamed James Webb, I think, who --",
        "A: Oh, James Webb, yes. James Webb was the -- the -- the first administrator. A very\nfunny thing I will tell you. He --",
        "Q: Of na -- of -- of NASA.",
        "A: Of NASA, oh -- NASA. He was a very ki -- a -- he was primarily a --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.\nThis is tape number three, side A. We were talking about Kennedy\u2019s America space\nprogram, and James Webb.",
        "A: Right, James Webb, who was the first and really strongest NASA administrator.\nBut there -- there\u2019s a vignette about Webb which I think that you\u2019ll find amusing.\nAround 1954, he was interviewed by the New York Times, and there were many\nquestions, and one of the questions he was asked was phrased as follows, he said -- he\nwas -- he was told, \u201cMr. Webb, it\u2019s been said that the Russian space program 1s a very\nmethodical program, you know, because they had started with a manned thing, then\nyou send one individual, then a woman, then two. How would you characterize the\nAmerican program?\u201d He said, \u201cOur program is just as methodical, if not more so than\nthe Russian. Every step we take depends on the next.\u201d And that\u2019s Mr. Webb, all right?",
        "Q: Yeah, that was fun. Now, you formed your own company at -- in what year?",
        "A: All right. It was 1968. My revered, late, former boss Dr. Lovell, a prominent man,\ninventor with 300 patents to his name, prolific individual, and extremely wonderful.\nHe told me one day that his friend was looking to fund a starting company, was I --\nwas I interested? And the long and the short was that we made a deal, and essentially, I\nreally didn\u2019t even know what, specifically we were going to do other than to really get\ninto the area of computers, and -- and software, but not concrete ideas. But very\nquickly after our formation, a couple of fortuitous events occur. The first one was that\nmy former boss at the company that I worked, part of the Bell system that was doing\nthe work on the Apollo program, the company was called Bellcom, and it was, of\ncourse, situated in Washington, that\u2019s what brought us from California here. He also\nhad, later on, a year after I left, had moved on to other things, had become chief\nexecutive of another company. And he called me on the phone one day, and he said\nthat one of the -- the subsidiaries, who were doing work in -- around the country, they\nwere -- in fact they had almost a virtual monopoly of race track systems. That is to say\nthose systems where they display the odds, and also people go into the windows and\nbet. But that company, the subsidiary, had started an attempt to computerize their\ntotes, as they were called, it\u2019s also the same name in England, from tote boards. And\nwe -- we -- could we go and -- and see about their plans? So we thought that 1t was\ngoing to be a brief engagement of about a couple of months to look over their plans. It\nturned out to be a six or seven year affair, because when we reviewed their plans, and -\n- and -- and we are -- we told them not only what was done wrong, but how to do it\nright, they said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you do it for us?\u201d And the long and the short is, and\nwhat made my company was the horses. We -- we build the first computerized systems\nin the world, and it was really yeah -- to some extent a technological innovation\nbecause we used mini-computers, which were just beginning to come into -- into play,\nprimarily as laboratory instruments. No -- no such animal had ever been used in a\nvery, not only real life situation, but betting 1s a very, very technologically demanding\nsituation, because in the half hour period between races, where all the betting\u2019s taking\nplace, the number of transactions is very, very high. And so the system had to, you\nknow, keep up with the flow thing.",
        "Q: Now when you said mini-computers, would -- I mean, how small would they be?",
        "A: Well, a -- a mini-computer, the type that we used, would be about the size of a --\nlet\u2019s say an audio tape, no not -- not that small, but one of the units that you see on my\nshelf, possibly, let\u2019s say 20 inches wide, maybe 20 inches high, and about the same\ndepth. But as I said, they had very limited memory, and they were used only,\nprincipally at the time, tentatively as laboratory instruments to collect data on\nexperiments and things like this.",
        "Q: And what did -- what was your company called?",
        "A: It was called International Computing Company. My f -- boss, the man who\neventually engaged me asked me why that name. I said, \u201cWell, it would be too\nambitious to call it intergalactic, so I -- I chose International Computing Company.\u201d",
        "Q: Yeah. And then it was really venture capital behind you initially?",
        "A: Well, the venture capital was sink -- only one source, this individual, a-and that\u2019s\nall the funding that we got. There is no question that like any young company, young\ncompanies like young humans are vulnerable, they are not fragile. But not anything\nthat we did, but the circumstances within a year after w-we got formed, things were a\nbit dicey, and we almost came, practically to disbanding the company, but we -- we\nstayed and -- and the engagement with that company to do the -- the --",
        "Q: The horses.",
        "A: The horses, gave us enough staying power. Also our -- actually our first contract\nthat we won two months after our formation, was to win a -- a program funded by the\nnat -- National Institutes of Health, to try to see whether computers could be used in\nassisting the collection and dissemination of blood in blood banks. And we were allied\nin this particular contract with the -- the blood bank in Milwaukee, in Wisconsin. And\nit lasted for two years, and we were able to prove that indeed, because it\u2019s the -- a\nproblem of s -- not -- o-of -- of -- of inventory, because as you know, blood has a short\nlifetime of three weeks. So, it had -- computers were -- what we were able to do, ina\nreal life situation, because the Milwaukee blood center supplied about 23 hospitals in\nthe greater Milwaukee area -- the secret is the ability of the Milwaukee blood center --\nall information if a blood unit is wanted, of a particular type in one hospital, and the\ncomputer knew it was in another hospital is to transport it, sometimes even with a\ntaxicab. By contrast, the Red Cross, who was the -- and still is the biggest collector of\nblood -- privately I think it\u2019s a national disgrace, because the Red Cross doesn\u2019t, once\nit collects a unit of blood, if 1t then ships it to a hospital, it\u2019s responsibilities end there.\nNow the unit may eventually age, and then be thrown down the drain, but in -- in\nMilwaukee we -- we did not allow that, because we were able to, if something was\nneeded, then we could -- had enough authority because the Milwaukee blood center\nstill owned the blood unit.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But the long and the short of ICC was that after the horses, then we got involved in\nsatellite communications. And I can tell you -- perhaps you know enough about\ncomputers to know that computers really don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re dealing with\nblood, or -- or horses. It\u2019s information that you are -- are -- are exchanging, so very --\nwhen we got into satellite communications, we bodily lifted elements of software from\nthe racetrack systems into satellite communications. And you tell that to people who\ndon\u2019t understand, they say, \u201cWell, how can that be?\u201d Well, [indecipherable]\nunderstand.",
        "Q: Yeah, the horses paid for your knowledge that could be applied to other things.",
        "A: Right, and made -- made -- made the company. And -- and by -- by ni -- ni -- 1987,\nand that was about 11 or 12 years after our formation, we had reached a force of about\na hundred to 120 people. And then we became -- we were courted by a number of big\ncorporations. Eventually a company called Contel, Continental Telephone, cause it\nwas the third largest telephone company in the United States, bought us. And in a\nsense this was [indecipherable] completing the circle for me. I started my career in a --\nin a telephone company, and eventually gets bought out by another telephone\ncompany.",
        "Q: Meanwhile, let\u2019s go back to your family life.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: What was happening to you personally during this time, and also will --",
        "A: May I intervene for a moment to tell you about something else? Since you are\nfollowing a chronological thing. You did not ask me -- it did not occur to me to tell\nyou about some of my activities as a student in Illinois, which really are something I\ntreasure. Let me tell you --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- very briefly, all right? And then we can move to -- I got involved in -- in -- in an\n-- in an activity which was a -- a extramural, it had to do with studies. It was an\nactivity of students who run the concerts. The university had a season of concerts,\norchestras and soloists. And the students arranged for everything. I mean, there was a\nfaculty committee that they got involved in the transactions, who to invite, and the\ncontracts, and things like this, but the students then did everything else. Issuing the\ntickets, programs. And then when the concert took place, of -- ma -- and my job\nbecame of going to the train station and getting the visiting artist, taking them to their\nhotel, and then bringing them to the concert hall, and then afterwards for -- for dinner.\nAnd it was a very rewarding thing, because I met people like Igor Stravinsky. I was\ndispatched by the university to Chicago. He had come from New York with his wife,\nand he didn\u2019t want to take the train from Chicago to Champagne, so the president of\nthe university sent his limousine, so I went to get Igor down, and -- and I will tell you\na-- a--a little vignette, if you are interested. Shall I tell you?",
        "Q: Yeah, oh do, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, all right. Well we\u2019re -- it was February, and I picked him up from the\n[indecipherable] station, and we are getting in the limousine, we are driving, we are\ntalking in French, primarily. He was not that comfortable in English. At some point,\nabout an hour -- it\u2019s about a three hour drive, he was telling me that he had been\nsuffering from stomach problems, and his wife Vera, a magnificent Russian grand\ndame, was from time to time su -- supporting him, he said, \u201cYeah, yeah, oh she\u2019s been\nvery, very sick at times.\u201d But at some point he said, \u201cLook, I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m feeling some\npains now, would you ask the driver to stop at the next gas station, because I have a\nthermos bottle with milk in my valise, and I need to,\u201d -- of course, of course. So we\nstopped, and we opened the trunk, and -- and -- and opened the valise, the driver and I\nwere on the side, and we saw Stravinsky opening the thermos, pouring something, and\ndrinking. And after awhile he says, \u201cEverything is fine.\u201d And we got into the car, and\nthere was an unmistakable strong smell of Scotch whiskey. So, when about an hour\nlater he said he had pains again, we understood. This way I met, you know, people like\nStravinsky, and Stern, and -- and Metropolus, and Zell. Because I would go pick them\nup, and then we would always ask them, and in many cases they all did that. The only\nreward that we students had, about eight, 10 of us, for all the work was to be -- to have\ndinner after the concert with the visiting artist. That was, you know --",
        "Q: And -- and you enjoyed the concerts.",
        "A: Of course, and we enjoyed the concerts.",
        "Q: Yeah. You know, you played the violin as a child. Has music always --",
        "A: I -- I started the violin.",
        "Q: Ah. I just wondered what role music had played in your life.",
        "A: Oh, an extremely import -- I -- I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a passion. I don\u2019t play any\ninstruments, but you -- you -- I think you asked me the questions, what I -- I do for\npleasure. We can get into that, but music 1s one of them.",
        "Q: Yeah, and was that something that was -- meant a great deal to your parents, and\ntheir parents before them?",
        "A: Well, my father used to play the mandolin, and he at times would play, but mostly\nth-this work -- what, in Ladino and Sephardic culture, are called canteegass, from the\nSpanish word, which are -- believe ballads, although there are differences. Ballads tell\na story, canteegass mostly are usually about a love affair, or -- or one thing like that.\nBut it wasn\u2019t that they were s-so musically. We didn\u2019t have -- we had a -- a radio, but\nit wasn\u2019t a musical thing, but in the whole process of -- of being well rounded, then I\nwas sent to the conservatory in Athens, and I took classes 1n the violin, until \u201941 when\nalso again because of the occupation, the conservatory closed.",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m glad that you -- we went back to the story --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- about Urbana Champagne --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and -- and -- and music, but were there other things going on in those campus\nyears which were important, and tie in in some way with your -- your background? I --\nI was wondering what was happening politically in the country then, and would there\nbe much involvement at the university?",
        "A: The only thing that I recall distinctly -- and it didn\u2019t touch me personally, but in fact\nthe director of the school of music, Dr. Kyper -- in fact, the summer of graduation, I\nreturned to Champagne to retrieve a couple of personal belongings, and on the return -\n- he was there, it was July, so I was -- it was a little strange to see Dr. Kyper in the\ntrain. We sat together in the observation lounge, and he proceeded ga -- I -- I could see\nthat he was very troubled, and I felt both honored, and in the same time, it\u2019s a bit\nuncomfortable, because Dr. Kyper unloaded, or -- or told me, or related to me, the\nreason he has come back. And this it was simply that because of the McCarthy era,\nperhaps he had connections with leftist groups in the United States, I don\u2019t know. But\nessentially he had been sort of recalled from vacation by the president of the\nuniversity, and told that there were such suspicions, or accusations, whatever. The\n[indecipherable] fact was that he was dismissed from the di -- the directorship of the\nschool of music, but remained as a professor. And he was a -- a -- a first kind of\npersonal contact with a political atmosphere at that time. This is the main thing. I\nmean, after I went in the army and so forth, well then I -- I was always politically\ninterested, I -- because I remember, my first recollections as a -- as a boy, because my\n-- both my parents were extremely interested 1n political things and we used to discuss\nit, but my first political awareness was the Spanish civil war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. No, I -- I would have expected that because of your background, you\u2019d\nhave a particular sensitivity to the McCarthy era. Just -- really just you\u2019d experience\nthe pre -- well, you know, you\u2019d experienced the Holocaust, and so you understood\nthat.",
        "A: Sure, sure. Well, not only the Holocaust, but -- but even the [indecipherable] all of\nthese things, and the reading, and all the thinking, and it was a kind of a strange thing\nto be living those days in the United States, who -- f-for us in the liberation -- the\nUnited States and it\u2019s history was something so unique, so superior to anything else,\nthat at the beginning, you know, I found it really hard to reconcile how in the same\nplace that -- that -- where there was so much freedom of expression, everything else,\nthere was also something like this. Except that a little bit of understanding of what had\nhappened in the 30\u2019s in central Europe, in Germany, then s -- I began to -- to realize\nthat there wa -- there was no monopoly, and it could happen anywhere, and it had\nbegun to even infest the United States.",
        "Q: Yes, and I would think to see -- to have that insight that -- perhaps to appreciate the\ndanger it posed before many Americans would.",
        "A: Sure, of course, of course.",
        "Q: You had referred to your -- to y -- to your wife, Paulette in the -- as we spoke about\nyour -- your corporate years, so let\u2019s -- le-let\u2019s return now to that part of your family\nlife, and tell me how you met.",
        "A: All right. All right. Well, we go back, remember I was divorced 1n 57, and -- and\nagain, this is another period that harks back when you were asking me, when I first\ncame to the United States, did I feel lonely, or -- or nostalgic, which I hadn\u2019t, but again\nin this stressful period, I had lots of friends, but really not relatives near me, that is to\nsay people who, regardless of what you do, will always be on your side. So I had\nnowhere to turn, and I -- I had to -- to cope with the situation. In any case, the\nfollowing summer, and coincidentally because Sam was getting married, then I\ndecided that I needed a -- a change of scene. In fact at one point I -- I thought that\nperhaps I would go and -- and -- and live in Europe. And in fact I went to Paris first.\nAnd I had been given names of a number of companies, including IBM, and believe\nme, it took just one interview to completely settle the issue for me, that the only place\nfor me was the United States. So I then enjoyed my -- my vacation, and I didn\u2019t think\nof ever st-staying in Europe.",
        "Q: Yeah, let me -- let me ask two things. Going back, what were the main stresses at\nthat time, in 1957, which you mentioned before, but also -- and then -- then I\u2019m eager\nto know what it was about that IBM interview.",
        "A: All right. The stresses were strictly personal, the personal stresses of the divorce, of\n-- of -- of all it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a-aftermath, and then finding myself alone, and -- and a little\nbit lost, and -- and wounded, the way that things had -- had happened. And I -- I\nimagine it\u2019s either romantic or -- or -- or -- or whatever you want to call it, to s -- to --\nto -- to s -- really think that a change of scenery is what you need. So that\u2019s why then I\nsaid, \u201cOh, well, all right, let me look into the possibility of working overseas. So I\ncontacted a number of people. When I went to 1 -- to IBM offices, well they said,\n\u201cYeah, but you see we cannot hire you here, as an American, because that has all kinds\nof other ramifications. We have to pay you extra salary, allow you return every year\nfor vacation, and so forth and so on. So that\u2019s a totally different kettle of fish, you\ngotta be hired by IBM there and sent to Paris. But if to hire you here, you have to be\nhired as a local.\u201d And that meant a totally different situation. The moment I heard that,\n[ -- | -- I realized 1-it wasn\u2019t going to be for me and I\u2019m glad it -- that 1t occurred very\nquickly, because then I could enjoy the remaining two months. Because I went to\nSpain first, went to Greece for Sam\u2019s wedding. This is where I met Paulette, I mean\nthe first time. I mean she was in the receiving line. Then two days later, I got a call\nfrom her sister, whom I knew vaguely. I had met her vaguely. Her sister was having a\nfew people for dinner, would I like to come? Sure. So I\u2019m walking, and -- and I\u2019m\nreaching the -- the -- the block where her sister lived, and at the door is a young lady.\nWell, we\u2019re both waiting for the door to open, we go, we get into the elevator, and we\nboth realized that we stopped in the same door, and we ring the bell, and of course, it\nopens up, Yola, her sister, opened the door. They embraced. I thought there was -- she\nwas just another invitee, I had no idea of the relationship. And like an idiot, it was\nduring, really, dinner when a conversation is going between them like Yola is asking\nPaulette, how are the folks? I mean the parents. Fine. And then I said, naively, \u201cAre\nyou related?\u201d They said, \u201cWe are sisters.\u201d Well, so that was our first meeting. Then the\nfollowing day, or I di -- two days later, I forget, she called, and now she tells me that\nthis was a daring thing on her part, to tell me that she had tickets to a concert with\nIsaac Stern, would I like to go? I said, \u201cOf course.\u201d I had dinner with Isaac Stern\nduring my years -- in fact, we went to the concert and after the concert I went\nbackstage, and we had a little reunion with Stern. He remembered me because we had\ndinner together with his accompanist Zagin. And so we started going together, and\nwithin about a week, I proposed to her.",
        "Q: Now, t-tell me Paulette\u2019s last name --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and also her home would have been very close to the area where you were in the\nmountains -- in the Pindus mountains?",
        "A: No, no, no, let me -- her maiden name is Moudzoukos. Her family hail from a city\ncalled Volos, which although is in Thessaly, it\u2019s at least 200 miles from the area where\nI was. Volos is on the eastern part of Greece, and it\u2019s a port, because it\u2019s on the\nAegean Sea. Her family were prominent. Her father and -- and his brother, and the\nfamily had a large factory, textile manufacturers. In fact, I remember when I used to\ngo, at times, to my father\u2019s office some summers to help -- to b -- so to pass the time,\nand I remember photographs of the Moudzoukos factory, I can still see it\u2019s outlines.\nThe name was very familiar. In any case -- and they also, from Volos, they were\nRomaniots, also, they were not Sephardim in -- in the sense that we -- I explained\nearlier. She has a sister who\u2019s still alive, and in -- older, Yola, lives in Athens. She has\na son, and he\u2019s married, has a son, and expecting another one. I met her -- I mean, we\nwere engaged, then -- then a-arrangements were made for Paulette to join me, because\nshe couldn\u2019t come to United States. We had to be married outside of the United States,\nand then I would then invite her to come as an American citizen. But we had to be\nmarried outside of the continental United States. She stayed with friends in Montreal\nfor about two or three months. I would go from time to time to be with her, and also\nbecause my divorce was in Mexico, and it was not recognized in Quebec, in the\nprovince, because they only recognize religious marriages, and religious annulments or\ndivorces, we were married in Toronto. We knew no one. We went to the registry, and\nthey said, \u201cDo you ha -- do you have any witnesses?\u201d As it happened, there were\nanother couple behind us, also strangers in Toronto, and we became each other wis --\neach other\u2019s witnesses, and that\u2019s -- we were married then in -- in -- in June of \u201958.",
        "Q: And how old were you then?",
        "A: Well, I was 32.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: Right. And she came about two months later.",
        "Q: Now, as an observ -- as an outsider it would seem to me that this wa -- this\nmarriage had lots of qualities that would make it a success, of -- her sort of coming\nfrom -- from Greece, being Jewish and so on. Do you remember having any thoughts\nabout what you -- what -- what qualities you wanted in a wife, or shared background?\nWas it important that she shared your faith, and things of that kind? Or did it just\nhappen?",
        "A: I think it just happened, but really in -- in -- in -- in my own personal case, you --\nyou have t -- to also take into account that even at the time I went in Greece, I was still\nliving possibly in the tail end, fortunately, of my experience, the first marriage, which\nhad ended so -- so badly. Really, I think that -- 1t\u2019s one of the questions that I think I\nsaw in your notes, about religion. There 1s a woman named Jane Gerber, you know her\nwork. | -- I -- she invited me to give lectures in -- in Baltimore in July, which I will do.\nBut I just heard a lecture of hers because of the -- of a thing in the National Cathedral\nwhere they have some artifacts that came from Spain that -- of the Sephardim Jews\nthere. Wonderful lecture she gave. And a magnificent phrase of hers, I think it was in\nresponse to a question, and -- and her phrase was, the relative relaxed attitude of the\nSephardim towards religion. And this is as best I can also describe both my religious\nupbringing, which was not very strict. I mean, we were observant of all the major\nholiday -- Jewish holidays. Dietary laws are really almost impossible to apply in\nAthens, because there were 3000 Jews in a city of a million. There -- y-y -- there\nwasn\u2019t a place to -- to go buy kosher meat and things like this. But in the high\nholidays, then special arrangements were made for s -- special slaughterers to come,\nand to provide. So there were no -- there was -- when I -- there were never crustaceans\nin our house, or things like that. But the observances there, we were -- my job for\nexample, every Friday from the age of five or six, because the synagogue was only\nabout a block away from my house, was to carry the oil donation to the synagogue,\nbecause the Sephardim didn\u2019t burn candles. All the -- the lights were olive oil with\nwicks in there. And go to the synagogue on Sabbath, and of course, all the major\nholidays. And the -- the -- the prepara --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Isaac Nehama. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "A: Continue in that vein, so -- from a totally different thing, there is a -- a Greek\nsaying that it\u2019s better to -- to wear old shoes from your country, even if they are --\nhave been repaired. But again, I didn\u2019t got there to -- to -- to find a -- a wife, it just -- it\njust happened.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And, of course I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m glad that there was some commonality, first in\nanother language, to some shared experience. Paulette was too young, she was -- she\nwas only 33, and at the time of the hiding, she was barely nine or 10 years old. So she\ndoesn\u2019t have as vivid memories of -- I mean, she has vivid memories of the hiding, but\nI mean nothing compared to going to the mountains. And also, very fortunately, none\nof her relatives perished in -- in the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: One of her uncles also happened to be a Spanish citizen. He was taken to camp, but\nhe survived.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, does she remember being in hiding, though, her -- her family?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, oh yes. Not only that, but she was able a few years ago, I think four\nor five years ago, to re-establish contact with the daughters of the family that hid them.\nAnd in fact one of them was visiting a sister in the United States, and then came and\nstayed with us for -- for a week. So she has maintained this thing, and she has\nextremely strong recollections, because also, there -- there came a time when in maybe\nnot the first, but the second house where they were hiding, somebody already told\nthem, there\u2019re already suspicions that you me -- may be Jews, and that was a signal to\n-- for them to immediately leave and go someplace else.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: See, she remembers all of that.",
        "Q: Yes. Tell me about your children.",
        "A: All right. Well, we have three daughters. Sarah was born in New Jersey, because at\nthat time I was working at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, and when Sarah was a\nyear old, that\u2019s when I left, or we left, and we went to California, because of my\nengagement at the Rand Corporation. Then when we return, Maya, the second one,\nwas born in \u201963, three years after Sarah. And in \u201966, Nicole was born, and she was\nborn here. I think Is -- a little bit helped deliver her a little bit, because it occurred\nvery, very fast. It was a Saturday morning, and Paulette said that the time had come.\nWe notified the doctor, he said, \u201cAll ri -- okay, I\u2019Il meet you down -- down there.\u201d I\nwas going to drive her, initially. But I had made arrangements with neighbors to take\ncare of the two other children, but the pains are coming very, very fast. And so I call\nthe ambulance, but even then, she says, \u201cThe baby\u2019s coming out.\u201d And she lied on the\nbed, in fact I can see the head coming out. And out of the window I see our neighbor, a\npsychiatrist who is walking his dog, so I ran out, and -- and -- and I told him that --\nthat Paulette is having a baby, he dro-dropped the dog, and he came and deliver the\nbaby. We wrapped it in a -- in a blanket. He asked from something to cut the umbilical\ncord, and I go -- I got it, and brought the -- the poultry shears from the -- from the\nkitchen. And when we -- we were there, I mean Paulette, as if nothing had happened,\nher cheeks were a rosy color. I was -- I bel next in pallor holding the baby in this --\nthis dirty towel that we had wrapped it around. But the palest of all was Dr. Hoffman,\nbecause he hadn\u2019t done anything like this since --",
        "Q: Medical school.",
        "A: Medical school, yeah that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Yeah. Now, what are the names of your three daughters, Sarah --",
        "A: Sarah, the eldest, Maya, and Nicole is the -- the -- the -- the youngest.",
        "Q: Delivered at home.",
        "A: Delivered at home. She is an attorney, Nicole, in Chicago. She has three sons now.\nAnd Maya has two sons. So we have, of the three daughters, five grandsons.",
        "Q: Yeah, that must be wonderful.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Well [indecipherable]. So you\u2019ve been surrounded by women.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: For a long time.",
        "A: For a long time, and now I -- I -- I must say that I was really hoping for a -- a\ngranddaughter. But it\u2019s ma -- fine.",
        "Q: Just so you have to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "Q: How did both you and Paulette decide to raise the girls? I\u2019m thinking of bringing\nthem up to -- I mean, did you attend -- did they attend synagogue, did they have Bat\nMitzvahs?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you share openly your experiences?",
        "A: No, the -- we -- I -- look, 1 -- living in aside what I referred to earlier, Gerber\u2019s\nphrase of the relaxed atmosphere, but I mean both at university, and -- and -- and when\nI began to mature a little bit more, I am not religious. But some of the things we\nretained which were dear to me, primarily because it brought memories of the family\nand it\u2019s tradition. So we always had the lighting of candles in Hanukkah, and the high\nholidays we -- we used to go to the synagogue. But I did not insist on their going to\nSunday school, or -- or -- or this or the other. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s turned out that of the three,\nentirely spontaneously, Nicole is the one who is super Jewish than all the other -- all --\nall the -- the daughters. I think really if I think now in retrospect, I think the division of\nlabor in the upbringing was -- Paulette was much more -- her family more structured\nfrom a social standpoint. I mean, in my house, for instance, we never celebrated\nbirthdays. It was unknown. I don\u2019t even know my father\u2019s birthday, my mother\u2019s\nbirthday. The only reason I know my birthday, and my brother\u2019s is because I -- we\nhave records from -- birth certificates. But in those days, they did -- they did -- but so\nfrom the social upbringing, this was sort of Paulette\u2019s area. In my case, I think that I co\n-- I continue to try to inculcate the same things that I received from my parents, you\nknow, the tremendous reverence for -- for education and -- and -- and learning. Plus I\nthink something else, one other thing, it was -- this -- how can I phrase it? The -- the --\nthe a -- assuming of personal responsibility. I remember that in the case of all three\ngirls, when they were ready to now leave home and go to school -- to university, Maya\n-- Sarah going to Boston, Maya in Michigan, and Nicole in Wisconsin, I took them all\nfor a -- a long ride and lunch. And first of all, I told them about the fact that I had been\nmarried once before. And a -- a typically -- although they didn\u2019t tell each other,\nbecause I asked them not to, they all -- always asked the same question, what was her\nname? And did by any chance have a sibling that they didn\u2019t know? [indecipherable]\nnot -- no -- no such thing. And then I told them that as they are ready now to go and --\nand live their own lives, I told them that a part of the Hippocratic oath a doctors take,\none part which I -- I -- I think it\u2019s very important, is above all do no harm.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: So Is -- I used to say to them, \u201cLook, you may encounter all kinds of situations, all\nkinds of people. If you are asked to try something, whether it\u2019s drugs, or si -- do the\nfollowing. If you have any doubt about the possibility of doing harm, then don\u2019t. But\nwhatever it 1s that you do, take personal responsibility for that. Now, it will always be\na -- a-- I mean, we will always be with you, no matter what happens,\u201d but I tried in a\nnumber of little things that they used to do when -- when they were growing up. For\ninstance, how they would divide a labor, chores, how they would do. It was always\nthis aspect that -- and -- and although this got formalized really, after the war in\nFrance, with existentialism, and when it was finally given a kind of official thing, that\nnamely life is nothing but a -- a set of choices, and even not doing something 1s itself a\nchoice. But even before I had read Sartre, and -- and -- and -- and the periodicals that I\nused to get from my cousin, from Paris [indecipherable] moderne, I always felt, and I\nthink primarily the war years, because when I got to the mountains, then I knew that is\n-- is nothing -- I had no place else to go f -- to assume responsibility for whatever I did.\nSo that became something that\u2019s -- I sort of learned on the job, as it were, in the\nmountains. And I thought that 1t would be a very important and useful thing to -- to tell\nthem.",
        "Q: Yeah, and had -- had they been growing up in a -- 1n a strictly observant household,\ntheir guidance would have come from the sort of roles of their faith, I guess.",
        "A: Probably. Yes, probably, right.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s --",
        "A: [indecipherable] the ethical portion of the --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- of the faith, yes. You know, it\u2019s -- what I would say, either by recounting\npersonal examples or events in my life, the -- they were not meant really to be mini\nlessons in ethics, but simply that -- that I -- I trusted them enough -- I had differences\nwith Paulette, really sometimes really severe ones. Paulette would sometimes accuse\nme that I was too easy, that I -- she -- she -- she believed, and she still does that Sarah\nexperimented with pot when she was in high school. I tried to tell her that -- that all I\ntried to do, and all I think a -- a parent can do, is to make sure that the core of the\nperson is solid. Since I could not be on top of them in every place they went, I could\nonly concentrated in one pronouncement, do whatever you want, but be responsible for\nit. Fortunately they have all turn out to be magnificent persons.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Very different in many, many respects, but all of them quite good --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and solid.",
        "Q: I wondered if there\u2019s any -- wh-when we referred to Jane Gerber earlier, and I was\nreading something that spoke about this Sephardim psyche, which I -- I jotted down,\nbut I wonder if there is -- I wonder if you think there are any built in differences of\nattitudes that Sephardim might have, because they really have wandered so widely,\nthrough centuries of history, and -- and faced all sorts of upheavals, and -- I don\u2019t\nknow if there are people that are more resilient, less trusting, I have -- I -- I just\nwonder if there -- if anything comes to mind that\u2019s worth discussing here. And -- and\nif you --",
        "A: Well -- well, it may be, but I think that it again depended on individual households.\nWhat I can say that comes a little close to -- to -- to what you\u2019re alluding to, was my\nmother telling me about some -- for example, because her maiden name was\nColonomos, which, as you probably know -- who knows if there is any connection, but\none of the most famous rabbis of all time, not s-so much Sephardim, a [indecipherable]\nAshkenazis Germany was a Colonomos. And as you know the name means -- it has\nsome variance. The -- the basic variant is Colonimos, which in Greek means, of good\nname. And it\u2019s Hebrew equivalent is yom -- what\u2019s the name? Not -- yom -- yom --\nYomkesh. So, th-there -- people who are called like that. Now, why was she doing\nthat? Apparently there must have been a kind of tradition that was primarily oral --\nagain, through the ballads, and through the songs, that hark back to Spain. After all, of\nthe five synagogues, major synagogues in Monasteer, before the catastrophe, one was\nKal Aragon, the synagogue of -- from Aragon, the other was Kal Portugas. So there\nwas really in -- in the stories that they would say, and even sometimes I -- you know, I\n-- yo-you -- if I chance to read a -- a play of Calderone\u2019s, and you see phrases which\nare not longer existing in -- in modern Spanish, and I can hear my grandmother\npronounce it. Some of that was there, but 1t was not something that was cultivated so\nmuch, except simply in the oral tradition about how things were at home, how they\ndressed for holidays, how they ate. So I don\u2019t know if it 1s really what you -- you refer\nto as psyche. In Salonika, because of a stronger movement, and the fact that -- that --\nthat there was a lot more contact with other countries because of commerce, and in\ninismeer in Istanbul, there was much more of an intellectual fermented than there was\nin the monastileese. There is a mystique about monastileese that to this day I don\u2019t\nknow why it\u2019s there. In fact, a week or so ago, we went to an annual meeting on\nmonastileese, which is a group of 60 people in -- in -- in -- in New York, that it\u2019s a\nbureel society, they simply are descendants of a first congregation of monastileese\never established in New York. It doesn\u2019t exist any more. It\u2019s called the Congregation\nof Peace and Brotherhood. But they continue --",
        "Q: Their sort of proud tradition.",
        "A: Yeah, so there is, yeah, there is -- 1f you could see, I mean you go on the web, and\nyou -- Monasteer, when it comes -- [indecipherable] has his own website, the\nSephardic four, full of things again about -- Sephardic things, dishes, cooking,\ntraditions, names. I mean, you -- names which were strange names sometimes, very\nSpanish in many cases. Then strange mixes of Hebrew names, women, Soonho, which\nin Hebrew is Allegra. And then you see from -- from generation to generation how\nthings we [indecipherable] change. My mater -- paternal grandmother\u2019s name was\nEstraya -- Star, all right? But as is traditional in Jewish fa -- Sephardic families, the\neldest daughter, firstborn on the paternal side -- I mean born, takes the name of the\npaternal mother. And the boy -- that\u2019s why I\u2019m named after my grandfather. And --\nand -- an-and -- now that\u2019s -- [indecipherable] it was through the work that I\u2019d done\nfor the museum that I -- and some other things, that I found that my great-great\ngrandfather, Solomon, was one of the 13 signatories in Monasteer in 1864 for the\nbringing of the alliance fran\u00a2aise in Monasteer.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I would think that these things you found out about your family are\nwonderful for your daughters --",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: To connect, huh?",

        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s wonderful that there\u2019s gaps, I mean in I -- history over generations, it\u2019s\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Let me tell you what I regret, however. That there 1s practically no information\nabout my mother\u2019s side. I have a cousin, first cousin, Miriam, who lives 1n -- in Israel,\nshe -- her -- her -- her mother and my mother were sisters, and she has done a lot of\nresearch on the Colonomus family. I finally have decided that it\u2019s about time I asked\nMiriam to make as much of the connection -- the only thing I know about my mother\nwas because she was an extremely bright student, and she went to a French school, and\nin that meeting just last weekend, I found another woman, whose mother, although in\nSalonika, also went to an alliance francais school, and she also was very bright. Both\nof them were slated to be sent to Paris for further training, but unfortunately the war\nintervened. That\u2019s -- stopped it. But I remember even when I first came to the United\nStates, landed in New York, and saw my aunt, and I met another friend of hers, not a\nrelative now, but also from Monasteer, and she says, \u201cI remember your mother, she\nwas so clever.\u201d",
        "Q: And of course, we would expect such a mother to want her children to excel\nacademically. I mean, that\u2019s a -- I think a Jewish stereotype, but --",
        "A: That\u2019s a -- that\u2019s putting it very mildly, very mildly.",
        "Q: -- but her own abilities would want -- want it.",
        "A: Yes, she was a very driven person, right.",
        "Q: We were speaking about your mother and her abilities and her ambitions for her\nsons.",
        "A: Well yes, first th -- I mentioned earlier about the obligation to speak French at\nhome. Very frequently she would ask me to all -- give me assignments to read, books,\nFrench books. In the beginning children\u2019s stories, later on even plays of Racine. And I\nstill remember she\u2019s in the kitchen, maybe cooking something, and I would then read\npassages, or from some of -- of these plays. Now some of them, and I still remember,\nincluded situations which really -- now, they were not erotic, but for instance I still\nremember -- although I knew the -- the word -- 1t comes from when it was -- it says --\nhe says elaparlay arsematress. Well, she did not comment. Normally she would have\nexpected me to ask, \u201cWell, that does matress mean?\u201d You know, because matress has\nat least two meanings in French. One is a teacher, you know, or mistress, but mistress\nin the sense of hierarchy, and the other 1s the -- the lover connotation. So she was an\navid reader herself, 1n the little time that she had available running the house, although\n-- though we had a maid. And she read history, and she -- 1-it was a -- ak -- a kind of a\n-- of a situation where she -- she demanded, you know, excellence, and it was at times\nsometimes hard to know what her expectations were. My father on the other hand was\na lot more encouraging. He had ways of recompense. One of my earliest memories that\nI have to tell you, I was I think possibly barely -- four -- four and a half, and I had\nwritten from an assignment, you know, half a page. And I showed it to him, and he\nwas incredulous, he says, \u201cYou wrote that?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d I almost saw a -- a -- a look\nof disbelief, and he says, \u201cHere, here, takes -- take another piece of paper.\u201d He sat\ndown and he dictated a brand new passage from another book for me, and had me\nwrite it. So I finish that, he looked at it, he says, \u201cWhat a magnificent handwriting. All\nright, put your things together, we\u2019re going to go now to the patisserie, and have a\npiece of cake.\u201d So he had this nice thing about, you know, rewards. Wa -- my mother\nwas not really that free with -- with praise. She was always a lot more demanding.",
        "Q: Yeah, but your father was very warm and loving, it sounds like.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Now, you s -- you\u2019ve said different things in the earlier video interview that m-\nmade me feel there was often tension with your mother, and I\u2019m assuming that you,\nrather than Sam your brother, would be the one who would c-carry the burden of your\nmother\u2019s ambitions for you. But I -- I wondered if you\u2019d talk a bit more about that.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something, you know, if -- I know even from my own\nexperience with children, that by the time Maya was born, the second, one mellows,\nand -- and it becomes a different -- because obviously the first child has taught you\nhow to become a parent. And I think that probably from either a character or\npersonality strai -- trait, \u2019'm probably very much like my mother. I too, perfectionist,\ndemanding. Really I -- I cringe sometimes at being praised. I don\u2019t know why. Which I\nknow 1s a terrible defect, because it\u2019s almost the obverse side of the coin of claming\ntoo much. If you always reject praise as -- as if -- you know, you\u2019re asking for people\nto -- to continue doing that. So, you know, there were -- there -- there were -- there\nwere tensions at times, and she was, you know, quite severe with me. And it isn\u2019t that\nshe neglected the other two, but I think, again, 1t was a question of mellowing, and --\nand not asking as much from them as I did -- she did with me. But on the other hand,\nespecially in the mountains, when I began to reflect about the tensions, and her\ndemands, and things like this. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s then that I began to realize how much what\nwas, I thought, unfair, then was responsible for getting a certain amount of self\ndiscipline, and which in the beginning is a chore, then eventually becomes something\nthat you like, namely to go and find out things.

And -- and you know that\nthere are people I -- I know my youngest daughter began -- she had a -- she has perfect\npitch, and began to even play tunes in piano when she was barely two, two and a half\nyears old. And -- and later on -- I tell her sometimes, and she -- she rightly says it isn\u2019t\n-- wasn\u2019t laziness, she had other things to interest her. So she didn\u2019t pursue piano the\nway, you know, I thought that she -- she would from -- from that kind of promise in\nthe beginning. So similarly, what originally was a -- a compulsion, then I began to\nappreciate, and how much I owe her for what she eventually was able -- able to give\nme.",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "A: Right. And because a-again, see, the 40\u2019s was s-so different, and by the time that I\nthink Sam also came of age to really start to doing more serious studies, going into the\ngimnasium, the high school, the war had intervened, and -- and that changed things\nconsiderably. And I -- I -- and it -- I don\u2019t even by -- that -- tho -- the p -- the -- the\noccurrence of the war mellowed her. It was merely that -- that already other things\nbecame very important, and by that time already, I had then hit my stride, and it was\nnot necessary any more to be pushing.

        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Isaac Nehama. This 1s tape number four, side A. We\u2019ll go back to the things you\nwere doing for pleasure.",
        "A: Right. Well, again, you know, it\u2019s amazing how inconsequential events remain. I ha\n-- was about six or seven years old, or maybe eight, and I had become a boy scout, or -\n- or a cub scout, whatever it is. And part of -- of the thing was to get a uniform, but\nalso a staff. You know, the kind of a thing that you have to then use when you climb\nmountains and so on. Well, when the time came for me to -- to -- to get the staff, you d\n-- you couldn\u2019t go to a store and buy it, but next door, or two doors down from my\nhouse was a -- a lumberyard. I -- I went and -- and -- and bought a -- a long, square\npole, but now it has to be made into a cylinder. Well, it happened then again that\nanother two doors down was, in the basement, a -- a -- a man who used to make chairs,\nand he had a wooden lathe what he would turn, as the phrase goes, you know, the --\nthe -- the legs. And so I t -- I brought the -- that square piece of wood, and he made me\nwait, and was sit down, and he put it on the lathe. And then he began to explain to me\nwhile he\u2019s turning the wood, how this essentially amorphous piece of wood, just a\nsquare, long, piece of wood, with his cutter, he would be able to transform it and give\nit shape. So it -- it was like seeing something be revealed under the hands of a -- of a\ncraftsman in front of my eyes. So then the idea of making things with the hands, is a\ncompliment to the -- the other side of pleasure and discovery, which in -- in -- in\nmathematics does not require proo -- evidence to the physical world. If you solve a\nproposition in mathematics, you know when you\u2019ve solved it. You don\u2019t need\nsomebody to come and say yes, that\u2019s right, you know it. Unlike physics, or -- or\nscience where you may have an idea but then it needs to be corroborated by physical\nobservation, experiment. Which 1s then half wasted because it requires both intellect\nand observation, to then making things, which is entirely by hands, although it requires\nalso some training, which obviously involves the brain. So I -- from those early things\nthen, I wanted to build things. And so when we went to California for the first time, I\nbought a saw, a table saw, and drills, and began to work with wood because I\nremember how this craftsman was able to transform -- which is almost the equivalent\nof the Michelangelo statement that he does not make statues, he just removes the\namount of marble, and just reveals what\u2019s already there.",
        "Q: What about -- well --",
        "A: All right, so -- so -- so -- wha -- you asked me what I like to do for pleasure, and\npart of it was, when I was at Bell Laboratories for example, then I belonged to a\nBridge playing club, and 1 -- some of us at lunch hour, instead of going to the cafeteria\nto have lunch, would have a sandwich, take it with us, and go to the recreation room,\nand -- and play Bridge until the -- and so very quickly, and especially in Bridge as well\nas in chess, you have to have good tutors, especially wish have -- to have very good\npartners. I was able to gain 1800 master points, because we were starting to -- playing\nin tournaments. At the Rand Corporation, I got involved -- a very favory game, 1s -- it\nwas -- it\u2019s called Krikspiel, which is the German for war game, Krikspiel. This is a -- a\n-- a game with the following. It\u2019s essentially chess, and instead of a single board, there\nare two boards, with a wall in between the two players. So both boards are set\nindependently, and each player does not see what the other\u2019s board contains. And the\nmoves start. There is an observer, who sees both boards, and whose role 1s only to say\nwhether a move that you may attempt is permissible or not. Permissible in the sense if\nthere\u2019s an opponent piece, you cannot move, let\u2019s say, a square ahead, all right? And\nhis other role is to say whether you have captured a piece. That\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s\npermitted to say. And the whole notion is that you fight a war when you really don\u2019t\nknow the deployment of the opponent forces. Now, as you proceed with the game, and\npieces start getting a -- to be eliminated through capture, and the -- the board thins out,\nyou begin to have a pretty good idea what it 1s. So these are the things which are\nintellectual games that -- that -- that attracted me. But inc -- we moved to California, I\nbought a saw, and I started make -- making things. Making things out of wood, then\nwhen we came here I made the table which I showed you upstairs. I made some other\npieces. But now I don\u2019t do these things any more, now it -- it\u2019s -- a new toy has come\ninto my life, and that\u2019s th-the -- the computer, and making web sites, and things like\nthis. The other passion is music. I\u2019m a -- a musician monqu\u00e9 as they say in French. If I\nhad another life, this 1s what I would have liked to do.",
        "Q: And tell me more about the kind of music that you feel you most enjoy.",
        "A: Well, I have always thought that my eldest sa -- daughter Sarah really was born\nabout three or 400 years too late. Her li -- preferences, and the things that she likes in\n[indecipherable] are more suited to the Renaissance days of Italy, at least as I picture\nthem. Similarly, my tastes in music are really frozen, as it were, between the 17\" and\nthe beginning of the 20\" century. So I only listen to classical music. And although I\nstudied the violin, it is a terrible instrument. It\u2019s a punishing instrument because it\u2019s\nvery, very hard, even for experienced violinists to -- to make a good sound come out of\nthat instrument. And although I never took piano lessons, the piano attracts me a great\ndeal. Occasionally -- I have a keyboard, if I hear a melody, or a part of an opera and I\nwant to reconstruct it, and I -- I can go back to the keyboard and try to -- to -- to play.",
        "Q: Course you can do wonderful things with musical composition on the computer\nnow, too.",
        "A: Yes, but -- right, but I think -- and I\u2019m sure that some of that can be very creative,\nbut I don\u2019t have the training to -- to do that. So at times I try to play with programs that\n-- in the computer that do that, but I co -- quickly see that -- that -- that -- that this is\npurely mechanical.",

        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- has travel been an important part of your life?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I have not travel -- after my retirement in \u201991 -- in 90, sorry, even -- I did\nnot agonize very much about what I was going to do, I know many people who are\napproaching that age, or -- or time, they say oh, what am I going to do afterwards?\nWell, I thought for a little while, but then I said all right, P'Il try to do whatever\ninterests me, and -- and if I begin to climb walls in the -- Pl -- P'Il think of\n[indecipherable] then. All right. First of all, I was asked by my former boss to consult\nfor another year for the company, because there was still a piece of work that I had\nstarted, that was unfinished, and he was not planning to replace my position. So I did\nthat for a year. Then, coincidentally a friend of mine, a Greek who was working for the\nEuropean community, asked me and told me that they needed consultants for work\nwhich was being funded by the European community, but which dealt with\ntelecommunications, and it\u2019s future in Greece. I mean the telecommunication system.\nSo for four years, I traveled. I was practically on the plane every other month, through\nEurope, throughout Europe. I -- \u2019'm no -- I\u2019m talking about the east, but primarily the\nwestern part of Europe, and Greece, doing this consulting work. Then a year after that,\na big project that I started had come to a reasonable stopping point, and we had had the\nIrish telecommunications company, that which led me to go to Ireland a number of\ntimes, which I -- both Paulette and I love. Then we went to Israel. I have lots of\nrelatives there, who had migrated -- some of them migrated in the early 30\u2019s from\nSalonika to Israel. So there\u2019s a -- a lot of progeny that\u2019s -- that\u2019s now in -- in the tents.\nPlus also some cousins, among them Miriam, her last name is Kalahora, who was one\nof about an estimated 1500 Jews who were able to escape from Greece via boat to\nTurkey, and then go from Turkey, through Syria, and Lebanon, eventually to Palestine.\nNow some of them, and her sister, either -- I mean, drowned, that\u2019s for sure. What 1s\nnot known is whether they were drowned by the boatman to take their money and --\nand essentially kill them. Some of them were captured by the Germans, by some patrol\nboats. Some were also denounced. But one of them made it. But 1500 made it to -- to\nTurkey, to Palestine.",
        "Q: Now, do you f -- do you follow -- d -- do you have any comments on what\u2019s\nhappening in Israel now, and do you -- I -- I -- I\u2019m -- I wondered to what extent you\u2019re\nmore politically aware than many a -- sort of homegrown Americans may be, not just\nregarding Israel, but be interested to know your thoughts.",
        "A: All right, well, first of all, I -- I -- I think I\u2019m -- I -- I read avidly about current\naffairs, both in the press, and -- and in -- in magazines. I think about that, I talk to\npeople. What -- what has troubled me about Israel, I could not really understand even a\nwoman as -- as bright, and as capable as the former prime minister, what -- her -- what\nwas her name?",
        "Q: Golda Maier?",
        "A: Golda Maier, who at one point was asked about the Palestinians and says, \u201c\u201cWho are\nthey?\u201d And I really have not been able to understand the -- the mentality of some\npeople, both in Israel, and I think sometimes more of it among some of the leadership\nof the Jewish community in the United States to -- to almost ignore the existence of --\nof a group of people, namely the Palestinians. M-My own preference would have been\nthe kind of a thing that as we know from events, things came almost close to being\ndone, except at -- at the last moment, at the altar, one or the other di-didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t make it happen. I think personally both -- I think that\u2019s historical invisibility.\nThe end of it if it -- it will take place, it -- 1t would be along the lines of what Rabin\nand -- was attempting to do, or -- or Barak. But I -- I -- I -- I talk to my relatives, and I\n-- | find them on both sides of the issue, and I -- I hesitate -- although I do not hesitate\nto criticize the government, or -- or individuals in -- in the -- in the Israeli government,\nbecause sometimes I feel that they lack statesmanship, and -- and savvy. But then I\nalso realize that -- that since -- there\u2019s a Greek saying that if -- 1f you are not in the --\nin the dancing floor, don\u2019t attempt to teach those what -- what are the -- the right steps,\nand because I\u2019m not there, I -- I -- I -- I can voice certain observations and certain\nviews, but not t-to the point of -- of -- of being adamant about it, because I don\u2019t live\nthere.",
        "Q: How much time have you spent at the Holocaust Museum? I know of your work\nthere, but what -- ho -- what part --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- how much of your life has that work taken up, and -- and what are your thoughts\nabout it?",
        "A: All right. Well, the -- my things with the Holocaust Museum took really -- it took\nplace in two different times, and for two different reasons, and two different periods.\nOne was about five or eight years ago, when I was even trying to ascertain the date of\nmy mother\u2019s death. Now, I would ask Sam, when did you get to Auschwitz? Well, of\ncourse, I mean, I think it was -- you know, either -- either between the 17\", and the\n20\" of August. All right. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI need to find out.\u201d Well, I went, and I started\nlooking at the archives, and I found what\u2019s called -- I think I v -- we would -- we\ntalked about that --",
        "Q: We ju -- we just mentioned it, yes.",
        "A: Yes. The Danuta Chronicles, which were the -- a kind of -- of almost diary\nofficially that it was kept by a Czech inmate called Danuta --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- and eventually it was published, and they are known as the Danuta Chronicles.\nWell, you look at entries day by day as they -- they are there. Sometimes they are from\nthe sublime or the horrible, to the terribly mundane. For instance, okay, today 15,000\narrived and were taken to the crematoria. And then this individual was punished with\n10 lashes because he stole a piece of bread. I mean, these are the kinds of extremes of\nentries. Well, all right. Since I knew the approximate period, then I find an entry for 16\nAugust of \u201944, where he says, \u201c1600 or 2000 Rhodesian Jews come.\u201d Then he says\nhow -- so many males, so many females. Not of the total, but so many females were\ngiven numbers, and he has the range of the numbers, and the females were given the\nfollowing numbers. And I knew from Sam\u2019s number on his arm fits exactly in the\nrange that he\u2019s -- he cited there. So I know now that the date of the arrival, and when I\nasked Sam at what time of the day they arrived, he said, \u201cVery early, dawn.\u201d And that\nmakes me conclude that either they -- they were executed or -- or gassed the same day,\nbecause they didn\u2019t keep them around, or at the latest, the following day. So that was\nthe first thing. So I -- I did a little bit more of this personal kind of a thing. What drove\nme then to the later engagement, which would -- then became intense, was a similar\nthing. I always -- I -- although I knew the fate of my relatives in Macedonia, in mon --\nin Monasteer, but especially in s -- in s -- the Serbian Jews, in Serbia, very few ever\nreached the concentration camps. And now not that much had been written, so I was\nbeginning to get really curious, so I began to -- to read some sources. Now I know the\nGermans shot most of the Serbian Jews and buried them, or used mobile gas vans. It\nwas before the killing factories began to operate. Well, then I found in a book that the\nBulgarians who occupied Macedonia and Phrase, among other things, and -- and this\nbook which is called, \u201cA Town called Monasteer,\u201d makes the following assertion. That\nin the archives of Yad Vashem, there is a unique -- a -- 0 -- a -- an item unique to the\nHolocaust. But emphatically Pve concluded there is nothing unique about the\nHolocaust, everything is unique about the Holocaust. And so I contacted Yad Vashem,\neventually I got the microfilm, it came. But then, while I\u2019m waiting for that, I thought I\nwould to go the archives, and I asked Sharon there innocently, do you have anything\nfrom Monasteer? Yes, we have 1400 photographs. Well, here is two huge books, but\nyou couldn\u2019t -- th-they were just only photographs with numbers, no identification.\nBut together there was two rolls of 35 millimeter microfilm, so you take the books to\nthe library, put the -- thread the thing in the reader, and every frame has the same\nnumber as the photograph, and written in handwritten Cyrillic was the identity and\naddress of these persons. Well, very quickly, the first day, I advance the microfilm to\nmy relatives. Now though, since it\u2019s Cyrillic the first letter is k, then comes n, and at\nthe end is f. There\u2019s Colonomos from my mother\u2019s brother, I found my aunt. My uncle\nSalamone Hamma, my father\u2019s brother, and my father\u2019s sister, Oro, who had married a\nman named Franco. Well, I took copies of it, I -- I came home. I was a bit moved by\nthis discovery. Okay, marvelous things over the weekend, and then the following\nMonday I called the archives, and it was Sharon, she says, \u201cWell, Mr. Nehama, you\nknow, we wanted to call you, but I was hesitating, and,\u201d -- I said, \u201cLook, let me tell\nyou why I\u2019m calling. Since I was able to read about my [indecipherable] perhaps\nmaybe I can help.\u201d She said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we were going to ask you too, if you would\nbe willing to.\u201d And that\u2019s what got me started, and -- and that -- that initial piece of\nwork took almost a year, because now, for the first six months, I would go the museum\ncarrying my portable computer, and get the books, get the microfilm, sit in front of a\nreader, and as I read -- and some of these things are sometimes unreadable, I would\nthen transfer them to the computer. Then one day it dawned on me that instead of\ntrudging and getting all these things to the museum, maybe I would rent a microfilm\nreader, and bring it here to my house, and I don\u2019t have to -- to travel. But immediately\nthen I thought, there is a button on the microfilm reader, and if you press it, 1t gives\nyou a copy out of the printer. Well, that means that the stupid thing goes out digitally\nso that the printer can print it. If it goes out to the printer, it can sure go to a CD. So I\ntook the -- the microfilm, and I paid a co -- a company, and they transferred onto -- on\none -- on a CD, so I did the remaining other four or five months at home. Then after\nthat was finished, the -- the archives, the photo archives, I did the same thing with the\nYad Vashem register, which is even more difficult, because, you know, even if you\nmagnify, it begins to get distorted, but I can show you later, you can even see that\ndifferent clerks were writing, because you can see that the handwriting is changing\nover time. And it -- it was a-another almost eight or nine months of very eye breaking\ne-e-effort to -- to do the Yad Vashem thing. But it was --",
        "Q: But it was also very rewarding.",
        "A: Very rewarding.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What -- what are the other things that you want to do in the remaining time you\nhave? I mean not -- are there other interests that you have not yet pursued?",
        "A: Well, let me give you an example, all right? A few years ago, the -- after my first\ngrandson was -- was born, Ian, then I said, all right, there will come a time where, like\neveryone will -- will ask, wh-what is relativity about? So -- so I put together a little\nhandmade illustration like a film, that explains, I thought -- explains relativity --\nspecial relativity, not general relativity to a child. The truth is that it requires a little bit\nmore sophistication, although children grasp things much more quickly, because they\ndon\u2019t carry terrible baggage that they have to discard first. But there are certain aspects\nof special relativity that one has to be able to at least make a leap of [indecipherable]\nbecause one thing to which special relativity is key, namely the velocity of light, we\ncannot experience it. You can only think about it, and the -- in fact there have been\nbooks that tell you, supposing the velocity of light was not what it is. Suppose it was\non -- an every day kind of speed, like you drive you car -- say speed of light was 30\nmiles per hour. What would happen? You -- you go out in the street, and -- and you\nsee a person in a bicycle, and as he moves, you would see him squashed, because it\u2019s\none of the lengths in -- in -- in a -- in a direction of travel shrink because that\u2019s one of\nthe aspects of -- of special relativity. But because you can\u2019t make -- you know, but --\nso you have to be able to imagine this thing, and then -- but I made this film, so I\u2019m\nwaiting for a time when my grandsons would begin to ask questions about the\nrelativity, or about mathematics, and either I will make films for them, or -- or tell\nthem, or tell them other stories. Because I remember from childhood I would be\nfascinated I had certain heroes. Ulysses was one of them, or Odysseus. Or -- or\nHercules, or Eracles. Then later on, in the be -- when I started -- another hero was\nAlexander the Great. Now in subsequent reading now, I have concluded he was a thug\nin many respects. That\u2019s the kind of thing that I would like to do.",
        "Q: Yeah. So it sounds to me as if you -- there may be a market for those ideas.",
        "A: Right, sure.",
        "Q: I was thinking, I think Einstein said he asked the questions only a child would ask,\nand that ties in with something you said earlier about working in fields where you are\nfree of the sort of strictures sometimes placed by --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- certain workplaces, and so on.",
        "A: Yes. Well, you see, Einstein said that imagination is much, much more important\nthan even very sharp intelligence.",

        "A: Look, I -- I have felt, or I have thought about the Holocaust and what happened to\nmy mother, brothers, the other relatives, and I am absolutely certain that he has\ncolored part of my outlook to life, to other people. But can I make a connection, can I -\n- was there -- was there a time when I had personal difficulties? I mentioned to you the\ndivorce. But I -- I didn\u2019t find that -- that a, even if there was a connection, that I would\nbe able to -- to -- to get relief, to -- tying it to God. So it\u2019s one of the unanswered\nthings. I have been m-more impressed by the works of all of the writers of the\nHolocaust, there\u2019ve been quite a few. But the one that -- that I admire most is Primo\nLevi. Number one may be because he was both a -- a scientist and a chemist, as well as\na extremely sensitive individual, let alone a -- a wonderful writer. And you know,\nalthough most people now conclude that he committed suicide, rather than dying\nbecause of an accident falling down -- downstairs, I have not ever found it ne --\nessential, or at least that I could even remotely hypothesize that this particular personal\nproblem is tied -- and as far as looking for help, maybe it could be resolved, but it\nwould not be cause of that, not because of the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Right, yeah.",

        "A: We were talking about one aspect -- not that one aspect, but I think you used the\nword, and I almost at the same time, that the work that I was doing was very\nrewarding, and I-I -- I think it\u2019s very rewarding. But there were also some byproducts,\nif I can call them, which really would last a lot longer, because in the process I came\ninto contact with individuals of similar interests. There\u2019s a matter of me corresponding\nwith -- his name 1s Moses Hasson, he lives in Santiago, Chile, because the people from\nMonasteer were early settlers in 1916 in a small town called Temooko, in the lake\ndistrict in Chile. And -- and was one of the oldest Sephardic as well as monastilee\ncommunities in South America. Then I -- I met -- and I have not met yet in person, a\nman who wrote a book about Monasteer, his name is Mark Cohen, he lives in San\nFrancisco area. And it was through Mark\u2019s researchers that I found, and I fe -- I have\ncopies now of reasons the s -- s -- the declaration of 16 prominent Mo-Monasteer\nJews, among them my great-grandfather Solomon, to establish the alliance fran\u00a2aise in\n-- in Monasteer. Then in 1924, my grandfather, Isaac, whose name I bear, was the\npresident of the Monasteer communit -- the Jewish community of Monasteer, and we\nhave a facsimile of his letter from Yale, in Yale, where\u2019s he\u2019s addressing the illion\nisrallitany versell in Paris, thanking them for the donations of clothing and money to\nthe Jews of Monasteer who had been severely -- suffered through fierce bombardment\nduring the first World War, to almost the total destruction of Jewish homes. Then --\nthen my uncle Solomon was the secretary of the Joint Distribution Committee in\nMonasteer, thanking the Jews of America for a shipment of clothing. All of that, in\naddition to being gratifying that -- that I -- I -- I have some lineage of people who gave\nsomething to the community, which reminded me of a thing my father would tell me\nwhen I was growing up, that human beings, in their infancy, for self preservation are\nvery selfish. They don\u2019t think about anybody else. Then they go to school, they meet\nother people, so they begin to share. When they have a family, they begin to give to\nothers. But some people stop there. Now, very few people begin to give to a larger\ncircle, namely their immediate community. Still fewer give to even larger circle, the\ncountry to which they belong. And finally, extremely few, maybe one in million, give\nto the entire world. So the idea of -- of giving back harks back -- and I don\u2019t know\nwhether my father was saying it because of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the history\nthat he knew of the environment of his own ancestors in community affairs. So \u2019m\nglad that -- that -- that to some extent -- and I also believe that there is a kind of a\nledger that somebody keeps, and so I -- I like to make the books balance. So that\u2019s the\nkind of -- of reward that the work is -- that I\u2019ve done represents, and then finally that I\nmay be able, both through the video recording, as well as the audio recording, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- sort of relieves me from something else that my children have been asking me\ninsistently to do, to write my memoirs. So at least I -- 1f -- 1f I only write certain other\nparts, and I don\u2019t write others, as least there will still be part of the record that they can\nrefer to, 1f they choose to, after I\u2019m gone.

        "Q: And when were you reunited with -- with your father?",
        "Q: Tell me how you proceeded from -- from that im -- immediate reunion, to\nbeginning to plan where you would live, and how you would put your lives together?",
        "Q: Yes. When you were a teenager, you had been working. What was the work that\nyou were doing then, and you were doing it until 1943?",
        "Q: And was this a Jewish enterprise?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And when you mention your neighbors in the apartment above, were --\nwere they Jewish? And I know that your parents sort of social network was generally\nfamily contacts. I think people they knew from Monisteer, or --",
        "Q: -- it was a -- a Jewish world in which they led their lives, would you say?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you think that your group had any -- was there a Sephardim look? I\nmean would -- could you -- could you say that you were slight in build, and dark, and -\n- | mean, 1s -- was there a difference between the Sephardim and the Ashkenazis?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was Ladino your mother tongue?",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t know what you spoke first as a child, or -- or fr -- from the very\nbeginning? Perhaps you were speaking Ladino and French right from infancy on.",
        "Q: I\u2019m backing away now and coming -- thinking again of your father at this time. Do\nyou have a sense of how he was coping? I mean, he had lost his -- at this particular",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You know, wh-when I asked you that question, I was thinking of his\nadmonishing you to not be taken by the Germans. And I think he spoke of that, I\u2019m\nassuming, because you had shown your determination not to go into hiding, but to go\nto the mountains. And you were the oldest, and you\u2019d had your Bar Mitzvah. And\ntimes were times of duress, I -- which prompted me to think perhaps he was more open\nin what he said to you.",
        "Q: And I would assume then, that there might have been more confidences shared at\nthat stage in your life, were it not for the fact that I think you s -- you also talk earlier\nin your interview on videotape about the pall that descended, so that it became a\nsituation from your parents when they -- their fears were something they di -- they\nwanted to protect you from.",
        "Q: Oh, and they wanted to protect you, I think, from their fears.",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Isaac Nehama. This is tape number one, side B.",
        "Q: And the plan about where to go raises lots of questions for me about the -- the\nfriends, or the people with whom you -- your family, not -- not you, ultimately, sought\nshelter, or -- or -- or homes, and the extent to which those people took risks, or did not\ntake risks.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I was interested 1n the -- what took place in Germany, and it seemed to me\nthat -- and I think you mentioned this, that Greeks helped the Jews, and they said,\n\u201cWe're all humans.\u201d It\u2019s common humanity. But I think it\u2019s worth you discussing that\nmore, just because something happened in Germany where -- perhaps it was baser\ninstincts of humans were worked on, but they began to see the Jews as not human. And\nthat enabled them to collaborate with the Nazis.",
        "Q: Also, do you think that the role of the Greek church was very critical in being\noutspoken and saying that we oppose this?",
        "Q: Yeah. There are not remarkable stories of righteous acts, then?",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go on now to the reunion with your brother Samuel.",
        "Q: And did you -- were you able to come up with any explanation of how Sam could\nbe coping?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How did you view, subsequently, your decision not to remain in Athens,\nbut to go to the mountains? In a sense it seemed to me you -- your -- you were 1n\nhiding, but you were in hiding with the partisans in the mountains.",
        "Q: Was part of it your wish to be actively resisting?",
        "Q: And I wonder if you talked with your father about this, but it seems that for those in\nhiding, they must have been -- have felt imperiled. I mean, when they\u2019d go to sleep at\nnight, you never knew when you wou -- would be denounced. I think of how fearful a\ntime it must have been when the rest of your family, your mother, grandmother, and\nbrothers were taken for questioning. Did you talk to your father about what that stage\nwas like for him?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What did Sam later tell you about that? I mean, were they -- were they\nbrutally treated, because I -- I think the Germans would want to find out where your\nfather and you were?",
        "Q: I think you had mentioned earlier that in that family, that one family council\nmeeting, you had agreed that you would never disclose where each of you were. And\nit\u2019s interesting therefore, your mother\u2019s defiance. But I wonder also if you had her\ndetermination. She was a strong personality, I think, and it may have been that spirit\nfrom her that drove you to go to the mountains.",
        "Q: What did you later learn from Sam about your younger brother? I\u2019m wondering if\nyour mother protected him? I -- I -- I think he was -- he would be 10 when he died, I\nthink.",
        "Q: I wonder if she would hide from him something of the horrors, and -- but I don\u2019t\nknow what you learned.",
        "Q: Have you felt a wish to f -- try to find out who revealed where your mother was? I\nmean, oh -- did you even feel a wish to do that?",

        "Q: -- 1s a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsaac Nehama. This is tape number two, side A. I was interested in knowing when\nyour mother was taken for questioning, with your family, where they were -- where\nthey -- that Gestapo questioning would take place.",
        "Q: Yes. Now, to what does Sam attribute his having survived?",
        "Q: I\u2019m interested in also in knowing of the roles you as brothers fulfilled later, as the\neldest son, and the winner of a scholarship, you came to the United States, Sam stayed\nwith your father, and I -- I\u2019m guessing that he felt an obligation to be -- to spend his\nlife close to your father, emigrating after your father\u2019s death. I just wondered if you\nfelt that you were a -- a cornerstone of the family, sort of succeeding in the -- in your\nnew life, but fulfilling one critical role?",
        "Q: Not a currency trader.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. It wasn\u2019t a matter of his feeling that he was forfeiting the opportunity to\njoin you, perhaps?",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting, your story of your father\u2019s efforts on your behalf, cause I was\nthinking of when you were -- when you went to Libya, he had intervened then, and --\nsuccessfully, I think, either was a New York Times reporter that --",
        "Q: Yeah, anyway, they\u2019re wonderful stories of a father\u2019s determination. Now, at this\ntime, would many of the Jews of Athens have been thinking actively of leaving for\neither Palestine or the United States?",
        "Q: Now, how much of an honor was it to have that B\u2019nai Brith scholarship? W-Were\nthere -- were there many of them, or very few?",
        "Q: It was your father\u2019s letter writing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Then how did you travel to the United States, by boat?",
        "Q: What did you take with you? And you thought then you would be there for several\nyears, for the degree.",
        "Q: And that would be -- you had a -- your father\u2019s brother.",
        "Q: And what are your memories of, the first impressions, of New York, of your\nuncle\u2019s home, of Illinois?",
        "Q: What is it they say, if all 1s going well, you don\u2019t need to vote, but --",
        "Q: How difficult was your adjustment to life at -- that would be Urbana, Champagne. I\nwas just thinking of language, and then all the other adjustments.",
        "Q: What -- what were the most difficult areas of adjustment? I mean, were there --\nwere there cultural things that were hard? I mean, were you nostalgic for Greek food,\ndid you miss your friends and family badly?",
        "Q: And you were 20 then?",
        "Q: What was your fraternity experience like?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Isaac Nehama. This is tape number two, side B. What was the fraternity\nexperience like?",
        "Q: It would have given you acceptance by a group, and I wondered if that was a very\ngood feeling for a newcomer?",
        "Q: Yeah, it seems to me it was interesting that that was arranged.",
        "Q: And I wondered too, when you were later in the U.S. army, years later, were there\nany similarities with your fraternity days? I -- I was just simply thinking of group\nacceptance.",
        "Q: Now, what fraternity was it, and what were the usual characteristics of that\nfraternity?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you experience any anti-Semitism on the campus in general, or in\nthose years? Were you a -- aware of any\u201d?",
        "Q: Tell me more then -- let\u2019s go on to your -- your studies. Y -- it seems your\nadjustment was very straightforward. You did your first degree, and you stayed on at\nIllinois for your later degrees?",
        "Q: Yeah, what did you write your thesis on?",
        "Q: Well, yeah what -- what were you planning earlier, to write it on.",
        "Q: And did you work -- I mean, wa-was that an area you pursued in your work later?",
        "Q: Yeah. Going back to the army, now had you become an American citizen earlier?\nYou came here as a Yugoslav.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, now -- and they intervened on your behalf with that private legislation, just\nyou were a promising student, and they felt it was an injustice?",
        "Q: And then after serving in the army, you returned to Bell Labs, and continued to\nwork in this exciting new field?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Tell me about your first wife, what was her name and her background, and\nwhere you met, and so on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. On to the next part of the story, yeah.",
        "Q: W -- y -- in your years with Bell Labs, I\u2019m sure there were particular successes, and\ndifficulties, and -- I mean, how do you look back on those years, and what would you\nhave us know\u201d?",
        "Q: And how long did you stay with Rand?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: An inter -- it is an interesting story.",
        "Q: So that you then continued to work on the Apollo program?",
        "Q: Oh, well.",
        "Q: Well tell me for how long you worked on it, and --",
        "Q: This is very fascinating, I thought you\u2019d had a career, you know, an unbroken\ncareer with Bell Lab.",
        "Q: And this would have been a very exciting time with the Apollo program.",
        "Q: Yeah, so you\u2019ve been very privileged --",
        "Q: -- to be in these sort of intellectually exciting --",
        "Q: -- areas. Now, when you would be with the Apollo program, how would that fit\nwith Sputnik? I mean that -- Sputnik would have happened, and have --",
        "Q: -- Kennedy, yes, and -- and we would have been sort of fast and furiously pursuing\nspace flight --",
        "Q: -- just at the time you\u2019d be -- yeah, well --",
        "Q: -- you\u2019d be working on part of that program.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, and a -- but -- was it -- well, I was just thinking of reading about someone\nnamed James Webb, I think, who --",
        "Q: Of na -- of -- of NASA.",
        "Q: -- of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isaac Nehama.\nThis is tape number three, side A. We were talking about Kennedy\u2019s America space\nprogram, and James Webb.",
        "Q: Yeah, that was fun. Now, you formed your own company at -- in what year?",
        "Q: Now when you said mini-computers, would -- I mean, how small would they be?",
        "Q: And what did -- what was your company called?",
        "Q: Yeah. And then it was really venture capital behind you initially?",
        "Q: The horses.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Yeah, the horses paid for your knowledge that could be applied to other things.",
        "Q: Meanwhile, let\u2019s go back to your family life.",
        "Q: What was happening to you personally during this time, and also will --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, oh do, yeah.",

        "Q: Yeah. You know, you played the violin as a child. Has music always --",
        "Q: Ah. I just wondered what role music had played in your life.",
        "Q: Yeah, and was that something that was -- meant a great deal to your parents, and\ntheir parents before them?",
        "Q: Now, I\u2019m glad that you -- we went back to the story --",
        "Q: -- about Urbana Champagne --",
        "Q: -- and -- and -- and music, but were there other things going on in those campus\nyears which were important, and tie in in some way with your -- your background? I --\nI was wondering what was happening politically in the country then, and would there\nbe much involvement at the university?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. No, I -- I would have expected that because of your background, you\u2019d\nhave a particular sensitivity to the McCarthy era. Just -- really just you\u2019d experience\nthe pre -- well, you know, you\u2019d experienced the Holocaust, and so you understood\nthat.",
        "Q: Yes, and I would think to see -- to have that insight that -- perhaps to appreciate the\ndanger it posed before many Americans would.",
        "Q: You had referred to your -- to y -- to your wife, Paulette in the -- as we spoke about\nyour -- your corporate years, so let\u2019s -- le-let\u2019s return now to that part of your family\nlife, and tell me how you met.",
        "Q: Yeah, let me -- let me ask two things. Going back, what were the main stresses at\nthat time, in 1957, which you mentioned before, but also -- and then -- then I\u2019m eager\nto know what it was about that IBM interview.",
        "Q: Now, t-tell me Paulette\u2019s last name --",
        "Q: -- and also her home would have been very close to the area where you were in the\nmountains -- in the Pindus mountains?",
        "Q: And how old were you then?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: Now, as an observ -- as an outsider it would seem to me that this wa -- this\nmarriage had lots of qualities that would make it a success, of -- her sort of coming\nfrom -- from Greece, being Jewish and so on. Do you remember having any thoughts\nabout what you -- what -- what qualities you wanted in a wife, or shared background?\nWas it important that she shared your faith, and things of that kind? Or did it just\nhappen?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nwith Isaac Nehama. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: How did both you and Paulette decide to raise the girls? I\u2019m thinking of bringing\nthem up to -- I mean, did you attend -- did they attend synagogue, did they have Bat\nMitzvahs?",
        "Q: Did you share openly your experiences?",

        "A: Well, I arrived in Athens on, I remember, a Sunday. And the reason this 1s\nprominent, because I think Sundays everywhere in the world are very quiet days,\nsometimes they are deserted. I arrived in Athens f -- with a bus that I had taken from\nLireza perhaps around four or five o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I called from the bus\nstation, and I was told to immediately come. I took a taxi, and when finally we were\napproaching our neighborhood, and my house, I expected to be greeted in the street by\nmy two younger brothers, but I saw no one. In fact, there was not a single person in the\nstreet. And I walked up to our apartment, I rang the door. A woman came out, who I\nrecognized to be the woman whom I had seen in t -- in Lireza two weeks or so\npreviously, who had told me that she had been passing through, and she had a message\nfrom my family, they were, all of them anxious, waiting to -- to be reunited with me,\nand she was the one who even gave me money for the -- for the fare back. Of course, I\n-- I now know, and -- or soon learned that my father had given her the money to -- to\ngive me for the fare. In any case -- so she -- she s -- immediately, without even -- I\nthink she didn\u2019t even say a -- any words, but simply with a finger pointed upstairs to\nthe apartment of our pre-war neighbors, a family called Shabitai. I didn\u2019t know what to\nmake of it, why would I have to go to the Shabitai\u2019s to see my family? So I went one\nmore flight, and I knocked on the door, and Mrs. Shabitai opened the door, and she\nembraced me, and I was shown into their living room, and then I saw my father, and\nonly my father, with Mr. Shabitai. I -- I -- we embraced, and I immediately asked\nwhere 1s mother, and -- and -- and Sam, and -- and Mekko, as we used to call the\nyoungest brother. And my father was crying, and I think un-unable to explain, and Mr.\nmi -- Shabitai said that th-they were not there, they were -- they were caught, but that\nthat wasn\u2019t the time to explain. They implied that I must have known that terrible\nthings happen, and that my mother and brothers were caught, and no one knows --\nknew where they went. That was the -- the reunion.",
        "A: Yeah, but I have to -- to cover 1v -- the brai -- brief period that occurred about two\nweeks after my arrival. I -- in -- in the beginning of December of \u00b044, there was a brief\ncivil war between the left -- political left, and the government, and also the British\nforces in Athens. And these troubles primarily occurred in Athens. There -- there was\nfighting in the street, and all of us were sort of hiding to try to avoid being injured.\nThen, in about 15 days after the start of the troubles -- I s -- even then we called it the\nevents, our neighborhood was liberated, and as I recall by a small group of English\nparachutists, I remember their red berets. So that was the beginning of what I thought\nwas going to be normalcy, but very quickly, two days later, I was standing in line to\nbuy some food, which was unavailable, and I was arrested by Greek gendarmes, taken,\ninterrogated. They wanted me to reveal names of known leftists. I explained to them I\nhad been gone for slightly over a year, I knew nobody, I was not politically active. But\nit -- nevertheless, I was -- I was taken in a c -- little camp out -- out -- outside of\nAthens, and eventually to Africa. But very shortly, through the intervention of\nrelatives, I was freed, and came back. So I think it was, essentially in the beginning of\n45 that we even began to even think about the restoration of our lives. Since as soon\nas I finish high school in 1942, the universities were closed, and I couldn\u2019t go on, and\nmy father had resumed his occupa -- work with -- he was chief accountant of a large\ntextile firm in Athens. So he resumed hi-his -- his profession. Also, I must note that the\napar -- our apartment in Athens, where we lived before, a -- a couple, a husband and a\nwife, one of them being the woman who gave me the money in -- in Lireza. They were\noccupying half of the apartment, they couldn\u2019t be evicted, or -- or -- 1t was out of the\nquestion to -- to -- to -- to -- to take any action. So my father and I sort of lived in half\nof the apartment, until about six or eight months later, after Sam returned, Mr. and\nMrs. Stasinopolous, that was their name, eventually left, and went, and found another -\n- another apartment. So immediately I -- I then began getting preparations for taking\nthe entrance exam to the Polytechnic Institute in Athens, which I -- this usually took\nplace in the end of August, beginning of September. And indeed, in -- in September of\n\"45, I took the exams, and I was admitted, and I -- I had one semester in the\nPolytechnic Institute, before I had found out -- which we perhaps will go into in -- ina\nmoment, that my father had begun to, without telling me a word, working assiduously\nto find a way for me to study all -- abroad, which he eventually was successful, and --\nbut that\u2019s ano -- a different chapter.",
        "A: Well, I -- I -- I -- as I said, I finished high school in June of \u201942. Since the\nuniversities were closed, then it was unthinkable, I think, for my father and mother that\nI would simply remain idle. So I was -- my father found a job for me. Let me describe\nit as being the clandestine, or an illegal market in currency. There was a -- not a black\nmarket, but a clandestine market of currency in -- in -- in Greece during the\noccupation. What was exchanged were principally, and almost exclusively, gold coins,\neither British sovereigns, French gold francs, or Swiss francs. Occasionally -- and the\nonly non-metal currency that was acceptable were U.S. dollars. And also, occasionally,\nsmall bars of gold. So, this individual, who was originally from Salonika, and who was\na -- in the stock market in Salonika, the legal stock market, he had, with his family,\nescaped from Salonika, established himself in Athens, and then started a -- an office by\nhimself. A bureau conducting this sort of activity. Very briefly, the way it worked, if\nsomebody wanted to, let\u2019s say sell or buy gold coins, against drachmas -- because\ndrachma of course was, in the occupation, highly devalued. The -- the value of -- th --\nthe price fluctuated according to the political fortunes of the allies. For instance, while\nRommel was advancing in North Africa, then the pound, and the dollar -- or the gold\npound and the dollar, would then be def -- deflated. And when, on the contrary, when\nthe allies began to -- to -- to -- to -- t -- to win, and turn the tide around, then the -- the\n-- the drachma would be more highly valued, because it would have s-some value\nother than what the piece of paper that was the currency during the occupation. So this\nis what, essentially, he was doing. And my job was -- I didn\u2019t do the trades, but I had\nto deliver to a buyer, or -- a f -- f -- first of all, even to deliver a roll of let\u2019s say, 10\ngold sovereigns to the buyer, I had to go first to the seller, to his house, get the roll of\ncoins, put them in my pocket, and deliver them to the -- to the buyer. It was, let\u2019s say,\na dangerous activity because possession, let alone trade in gold, was illegal. If I had\nbeen caught, I -- I would have been jailed, shot, or whatever it was. Even conducting\nthis sort of business was -- was illegal. So there was a f -- the front was that -- there we\n-- we had a number of shelves in the office with textiles. Woolens, and some silks,\npretending that it was that sort of business, but actually, the -- the business itself was\nthe -- the currency.",
        "A: Well, it -- the man, his name was Haim Romano, happened to be a Jew from\nSalonika, but th-the traders were both Christian Greeks, as well as Jews.",
        "A: Relatives.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, and the Shabitais were Jews, but they were not Sephardim. Mr. and\nMrs. Shabitai -- Mrs. Shabitai was from Yarninar, and Mr. Shabitai was from Trikola.\nBoth of them are what is referred to as Romaniots, which can be explained either as\nGreek speaking, or negatively, non-Ladino, not Judeo espanole speaking, or they were\nnot descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492. In contrast, my\nparents on both sides -- both of them were born in Monasteer, traced their ancestry to\nthe Sephardim who left Spain, and eventually ended up in that part of the Balkans,\nwhich was, at that time, a part of the Ottoman Empire.",
        "A: Do you see any difference? No, no, I -- I -- I don\u2019t recall -- really I think that I\ncouldn\u2019t distinguish any surface difference between the looks of my family or our\nrelatives, and other Greeks. They all have, perhaps the same kind of Mediterranean\nlook, which not even -- has even particularly darker skin coloration. Of course, a -- a --\nyou -- you -- you would find very rarely, even among Greeks, or -- or Turks, or\nsouthern Italians, or Spanish, blonde people. But there were a few there, but otherwise\nthere were no such characteristics of Sephardim. The thing that was distinguishing, of\ncourse was that my parents spoke Ladino to each other, and my maternal grandmother,\nwho would come and visit us, at least two or three times a week, she lived with an aunt\n-- a sister of my mother\u2019s, that\u2019s the only language that she understood, and we had to\nspeak to her, and she spoke to us with s -- Ladino.",
        "A: Not mine. Mine was, well dual, Greek primarily because of my friends and going to\nschool, but at home it was obligatory to speak French, bo -- my mother was a teacher\nof French, and my father had studied in Paris, or -- we -- we were obliged to speak in\nFrench.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t believe that I spoke Ladino. Perhaps, before I began to go to school, I\nbelieve, and I -- I seem to -- I recollect that I spoke to my parents in French.\npoint, he had lost his wife and two sons. Do you have a sense of what gave him\nstrength, and what his state of mind was?",
        "A: I can only surmise -- I -- I have to -- because this -- it occurs, and I think about it\nvery often. Or in discussions I have with people. And I always have to remind myself\nand my interlocutors that at least in those times, and -- and in -- in that particular part\nof the world, parents were not really very communicative about personal and intimate\nthings, with y-young children. I -- I -- I think -- I -- I -- Ica -- I recollect from cousins\nthat they began to have conversation as between adults, and equals with their parents,\nafter they themselves had matured, and were married. So I don\u2019t think that there was,\nlet\u2019s say, reluctance. My father used to be a great storyteller, but I must say that very\nseldom, o-o-other than in passing he would say how dinner was in -- on -- on high\nholidays in Monasteer, how the dinner would be prepared, and things like this. A\nepisode of things like this. But not very much about personal life. But coming back to\nyour question, there was very little exchange between us as to either how we felt -- I\ntold him about some of the things that I had thought about during my sojourn in the\nGreek mountains with the partisans, but really very briefly, and I think mostly\nsuperficial. We didn\u2019t go into -- into that. Knowing my father as I recollect him, he\nwas an individual of -- you know, he was lame, as you know, because of polio, and he\nhad a club foot. So he was always hobbled. He always wor -- wor -- walked with a\ncane. But he -- he had a -- an inner strength that became evident to me very rarely. I\nthink you -- you know the example of his urging me not to be caught alive by the\nGermans. So, I can only imagine the -- the pain that he had with the loss -- or at that\ntime, you know, we still had a very, very faint hope that perhaps they might return. We\n-- remember the war was not over in Europe until April -- end of April \u201945, so the\npictures of -- and -- and -- and stories, and -- and things about like the horrors of the\ncamps was still totally unknown. So there was a -- a -- a residue of hope, although\nvery, very slight, that they mi -- they might come back. And the focus, therefore, was I\nthink a -- a tacit -- a mutual understanding that we had to get on with our lives as best\nwe could, and so my father resumed his work, and I then resumed the preparations for\ntaking the exams.",
        "A: Well, but you have to remember that -- th -- it was such a special moment, I -- I\ncannot conceive of an -- a recollection -- let me back off, very quickly. In the summer\nof \u00b039, my father took me to a -- there\u2019s a -- a place about a hundred kilometers from\nAthens, it\u2019s called Lutrikey, and it\u2019s a -- sort of a spa, because it has water sources that\nare -- contain rad-radio activity, radium. And they were thought to be very beneficial\nfor whatever a-ails you. It was essentially a resort. And so we went ahead of the rest of\nthe family for three or four days. It was shortly after by -- my Bar Mitzvah, and I still\nremember the first time that -- so we were the two of us, and is the first instance that I\nrecall my father telling me, for example [indecipherable] personal plans, that he had\nbegun to -- I see -- remember telling me -- put some money aside, and part of plan was\nwe were going to leave the apartment where we had lived for -- since I rec -- I recall.\nAnd we\u2019re going to buy a house. So it was the first time that I had heard my father\ntelling me of something about his -- let\u2019s say dreams and plans for the future. So, in\nother words, it was the first instance where I think I was tr -- being treated as an adult.\nThe unfortunate thing is that as soon as we returned, the war started, in September of\n\u00b039, so we too -- September thir -- or -- or -- or that summer of \u201939, it\u2019s the last\nsummer -- and that in 1940 because the war didn\u2019t touch Greece until the fall of 1940\nthat are the last two summers that I can recall of being if not happy, at least -- I have to\nuse a French word, insouciance, that we were not bothered. The war had started, it was\na terrible thing. My parents had both gone through the experience of the first World\nWar, and it\u2019s horrors in Monasteer, but it was so far away that it didn\u2019t yet begin to\ntouch us until the fall of 1940. So, it\u2019s a long detour to what\u2019s -- what -- what you ask.\nSo | -- I -- I think there was a tremendous amount of resilience, and strength that -- in\nmy father, which was not apparent on the surface. When he admonished me not to be\ncaught alive by the Germans, I think 1t was because he knew from all the reports of the\n30\u2019s, since the rise of Hitler in Germany, the history of the -- of the Jews in Gaspora,\nall these things, you know, get farely concentrated, and simply -- al-although I don\u2019t\nthink he -- no one knew at that time of concentration camps, but he knew that 1t was\nnot a good thing to be caught alive by the Germans. So he -- he -- it was a second\ninstance of I -- his addressing me as an adult, and telling me that it\u2019s better to -- to be\ndead, than be caught alive.",
        "A: F -- yo-your absolutely correct about the pall, because it was so palpable, I -- I can\nstill feel it. I don\u2019t re -- recall that there was, let\u2019s say, a smile on their faces after about\nmid or early April of 1943, because the news began to come in very quickly about\nboth Monasteer and Salonika. Those occur about two or three weeks apart. And the --\nalthough -- sou -- a few things were written up in the papers that was really not -- some\nthat was really spoken, but they knew from reports of relatives. And as I say, I -- from\nthen on, I don\u2019t recall their being a single smile in their faces. Now I\u2019ve lost track of\nwhat you asked.",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay. Ye-Yes. Really, I think it would be a stretch for me\nagain to say that that was the motivation. Surely -- I\u2019m sure that they wouldn\u2019t want to\nalarm us, especially my younger brothers. But even to me, they -- they didn\u2019t say\nthings because they knew that I would have -- I wouldn\u2019t have that much to contribute.\nBut it was -- it was a sort of shielding, but I think it was primarily because they\nthemselves were, first of all, not only so crushed by what they had heard, but the\nprinciple thing was that they be -- I\u2019m sure now, in retrospect, that they were mulling\nwhat to do in case so -- something like this would reach Athens. So I think their total\npreoccupation for all that time after beginning of April \u201943 was precisely what to do.\nThat\u2019s why when finally it did occur, September of \u201943, after the Italian armistice, then\nsuddenly, and for the first time, we had a family council, something that had never\noccurred before. And my father and mother sat us around the table, and with very few\nwords, told us what we had to do. Therefore, all these preparations must have been\npart of what they -- they were preoccupied in what they were preparing to do. Because\n1--]--[ --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: I believe we were talking about the situation a-after April \u201943, when the news from\nSalonika and Monasteer came, and I think I was alluding to the fact that although our\nparents did not take us into their confidence about their concern, their worries, but I\ncan only surmise, and I\u2019m almost positive now in checking with my brother, that a lot\nof the time, intervening time, was spent in preparing for -- not inevitability, but in -- in\nthe event that the same thing would occur in Athens. Because I cannot explain in any\nother way, the fact that practically as soon as the signal was given to disperse in\nAthens, the plan was already in place about where to go.",
        "A: All right. A couple of weeks before the dispersal, a friend of -- a sc-schoolmate -- I\n-- | would speak about my role first. Although again, I hadn\u2019t discussed this with my\nparents, but sensing what was happening, this school f-friend, Thanasis Mikalopoulus,\nwho is a Christian Greek, I had told him that there may come a time when I may have\nto go into hiding, and then -- we were close friends, but I hadn\u2019t even met his parents.\nHe says, \u201cThey\u2019ll be n-no question, you will come and stay with us.\u201d So that sort of\nwas done. When then we had this family council about where to go, I will tell you very\nquickly, my -- my father -- first of all, no Jewish family, really more than three or four\nat most, could possibly be hiding all together, because it would have been very\napparent, no matter where they were hiding, that neighbors would immediately see,\nsuddenly, not one or two, which you can justify as being my visiting relative from the\nprovinces. Well, not suddenly, you know, a whole -- a whole family. So, this person\nwas essential. My father went and -- and stayed for a certain period of time. Certainly\nuntil my departure from the mountains about a month later, with a -- a couple, they\nwere childless. Both the man and the -- the -- the woman -- his name was Tenasias, her\nname was Ellie, they were both working in the same company that my father did, so\nthey were both colleagues, as well as friends of long-standing. Next door to our house\nin Athens, to our apartment, was a man who had a small store that was really a mini\nvariety store. By that I mean he -- he sold tobacco, cigarettes, newspapers, but also in\nthe back o-of -- he had thread, and needles. It was that -- that sort of convenience\nneighborhood store. And over the years my father had become very, very friendly with\nthis individual, and he had a house in one of the suburbs on the eastern side of Athens,\nreally a -- a vi -- a far suburb. And that\u2019s where my mother and two brothers went. So\nwhen we dispersed, that\u2019s how we -- that\u2019s where we went.",
        "A: You ask about risks. Well, really all of them took risks, and the same risks, because\nthe Germans made it known that sheltering Jews, or sheltering people like members of\nthe resistance, whether arm resistance or the political resistance was a capitol offense,\nan -- and from time to time they would shoot them in the street. So taking risks was\nquite a -- a -- well-known, and all of them took risks, and the same risks.",
        "A: Well yes, but remember, it took quite a bit of time, and quite a bit of history for\nthings of that sort to take place. Look at Bulgaria. In 1941 they pass a law, which has\nabout -- magnificent Orwellian title, the law for the protection of the state. But it was\nalmost patterned -- similar to the Nuremberg laws, and -- and most of it\u2019s provisions\nwere clearly anti-Semitic. Or what happened to the Romanian Jews? Half a million\npeople were -- most of them massacred by the Iron guard of Romanians themselves.\nOr the -- the Jews of Serbia and Croatia? Most of them died of starvation by the\nUstasha, th-th-th-th -- the -- the Croatian Fascists. So, the Germans, by no means had -\n- didn\u2019t have, you know, the exclusive patent to brutality and cruelty. They rose it to --\nto heights of subtlety and -- and demonic deviousness. [indecipherable] Salonika Jews,\nthey were telling them that they gonna send them to Krakow, and -- and un-\nunfortunately, the -- the chief rabbi, who was the leader of the community in Salonika\nwas a -- a gullible, naive, stupid individual, who then tried to reassure the -- th-the\nJews of Salonika that their brethren in Krakow were going to take care of them. Of\ncourse, the Germans didn\u2019t tell them that Krakow had already been totally eliminated.\nSo this kind of a thing hadn\u2019t reached Greece or Italy. Maybe -- I don\u2019t know, maybe\nthe ethnic character, 1t would never have taken root, but I have to admit that I often\nthink that we have failed miserably, in the last 50 or 60 years. When I was in the\nmountains we thought that that was going to be the end of this sort of brutality, and\none sees it repeated over, and over again, as if these things didn\u2019t happen. So I feel a\npersonal sense of failure, that my generation has done something terribly wrong.",
        "A: Look, le-le-let\u2019s put things perspective. There was really one extremely courageous\nvoice, that\u2019s was Thamskino\u2019s, the archbishop, who not only protested openly, and\nwho I think, perhaps -- I don\u2019t know if it was mentioned in the videotaping, he was\nthreatened by the German general Stupa that he would be shot, and Thamaskino said,\n\u201cGreek clergy traditionally have been hanged.\u201d And he expected Stupa to follow the\nsame tradition, yeah. But look, I know of no really massive -- by that I mean even in t -\n- in the [indecipherable] of Jews that were saved through the action of the Greek\nOrthodox church. The -- it is a fact that Thamaskinos, the archbishop said that Jews\nwould find refuge in monasteries, but I really don\u2019t know of a single case where Jews\nsurvived because they were sheltered in monasteries.",
        "A: Oh, there are -- there are lots, but they -- they -- they are not on the part of an\norganized body, wha -- be it the church. For example, the then chief of police, Evert,\nhe -- I mean, in the German occupation, he personally issued or gave orders, and faked\nid -- identity cards were issued to Jews. These -- these were acts of heroism that are --\nreally were individual. Other than Evert, and this act of Thamaskinos of open protest,\nall the other Jews who were saved was through the act of, I think, great humanity, first\nof all, and even at times against a -- a -- you know, a palpable danger on the part of\nindividual Greeks.",
        "A: Well, as you recall from the other tape, beginning in May, or June of \u201945 as I recall,\nwhen the first news of the liberation of concentration camps, then -- and -- and -- and -\n- and DP\u2019s -- displaced persons began to be processed, then there were both -- there\nwere reports both in the Greek newspapers, and also on the radio of rec-recitation of\nnames of the known people who were -- would be returning. And I found this out from\na neighbor in the -- in one morning, that she had heard my brother\u2019s name. But within\nreally t-two or three days shortly after this news, Sam already had been moved,\neventually from Germany to Italy, Bali, and then to Pardres, and then he called on the\nphone and told us that he was arriving, and I went to the station and -- and there he\nwas. Well, 1-1 -- first of all, I cou -- I didn\u2019t recognize him right away, because he had\ngrown so much in the brief year and a half that -- almost two years since I had see --\nwe had seen each other. And two things I think, or one thing s -- that struck me was\nthat his behavior, at least outwardly in the days and weeks after his return, to -- at least\nto me it appeared as if he had not really -- or -- or -- or all these horrors, and all these\nexperiences had not left such a -- a -- a mark on him, because he -- he would laugh,\nand sing, and -- and I remember he was into -- into jazz, and -- and -- and modern\nmusic, and going out with -- with friends. Whereas I had really, in the -- in the -- in the\nmonths in the mountains, I had spent a great deal of time just thinking about what had\nhappened, and also looking to a much better situation afterwards, and I had all kinds of\nplans, and especially about my mother, who was always a very demanding woman,\nand who I thought was not -- never satisfied with my accomplishments, and that she\nwould be very proud about things that I was going to do. And -- and -- and I had been,\nI think, much more touched by the events than I could see Sam. Of course, it\u2019s very\ndifficult to read what is really deep in -- in somebody\u2019s mind, or psyche. But at least\noutwardly, I was astounded at the resilience of human beings to go through this -- this\nhorror which you would begin to see in newsreels and read progressively in books,\nthat the term Holocaust hadn\u2019t even been invented yet. But I was astounded.",
        "A: Well, the only explanation was that -- that simply because he was not only young,\nabsolu -- in absolute terms, but that -- that in that period of 13 or 14, there was more\nelasticity in -- in -- in somebody\u2019s mind and character and emotions than there would\nbe -- we only had four years apart -- in any -- 1n any case, it -- it -- I was much more\naffected by the -- by the war experience, all the events, than I saw Sam being affected.\nAnd that\u2019s -- simply surprised me.",
        "A: All right. I have -- I have thought about this thing very, very much, but I -- I can\nreally tell you that 1t was not resolved of a great deal of rational thinking, and\nweighing of factors for and against. I can only ascribe it to pure instinct, number one,\nto a aspect of my personality that I simply -- when I thought about it, I re -- re-refused\nto -- to -- to -- to s -- to s -- to accept the possibility of remaining in hiding for an\nindeterminate period of time. I had never been away from home, although the\nMikalopoulus\u2019s were very kind to me, they accepted me, th-th -- Thanasis, my friend,\nwas the only child, the only son, and -- and there was never any hesitation, accepting\nme as another, but it wasn\u2019t really that I felt a stranger, simply that I could not\nwithstand a life of continuous hiding, which then made me an -- and the moment this\ntook root, then what I call personality, I -- P\u2019ve believe that what is referred to\nsometimes, I\u2019m goal oriented. That means I -- once I set a -- a target, then I -- I do\nwhatever I can to -- to -- to reach that -- that outcome. That was what propelled me.\nThe -- it wasn\u2019t really based on any other set of weighing of rational pieces of\ninformation for or against. That was going to be it, and I was going to a total unknown.\nI didn\u2019t even know where I was going.",
        "A: No. The active wish was to survive.",
        "A: The answer 1s, we didn\u2019t talk, but -- and I again, I surmise that -- l-let\u2019s put some\ndates, so we -- we -- we will know what we are talking about. My mother and brothers\nwere caught towards the end of June, beginning of July of 1944. They were\nincarcerated in the detention camp of Hithari. And on July 29, they were put on board\nthe last transport that ever left Greece, together with the 1800 Rhodesian Jews. I can\nimagine that my father learned about that not because anyone went and told him.\nThere was no such contact, but he must have surmised, because they say from a\nnegative side, lack of contact from time to time, my mother, or Sam would go to my\nfather, not so much alone to see him, but also to get money. Also, perhaps -- we didn\u2019t\ncover that, I don\u2019t believe in the video interview, but I know subsequently, that my\nfather changed hiding places three times, because -- you know, the -- you can only\nmaintain a -- a pretense of a visiting relative up to a certain point, all right? So there\nwould come a time when it was time to go. Some -- ok -- times there were o -- really\nostensible reasons that people would suspect, or even somebody would whisper and\nsay -- they begin to s -- to know that you are Jews, whereupon both the family who\nwere doing the sheltering, as well as the sheltered, knew that it was time to -- to move.\nSo my father moved three times. At the time of, I think, the capture of my mother,\ngrandmother and brothers, he -- it was finally in the last place, the third place, before\nthe liberation. And simply, he must have realized that something had happened,\nbecause there were no contact -- there was no contact. Of course, he found out\nimmediately after -- after the liberation.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, this is a -- a -- really a very painful a-aspect to me, because of what Sam\ntold me. In their interrogation, the beatings that my mother and he were subjected --\nnot the young one, not the me -- Mekko. And they kept on asking them about my\nfather\u2019s and my whereabouts. Of course, in -- 1n a case for me, she did not know. And\nthen Sam told me that for months, and months, and months, my mother was really\ndestitute, and -- and -- a -- I mean, extremely concerned about what had happened to\nme. She did not know where I had gone. I\u2019m sure my father told her, \u201cHe\u2019s gone to the\nmountains.\u201d But even with my father I didn\u2019t com -- there was no way to communicate\nand -- and send notes from time to time, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m fine. There were no ways of doing\nthat. So the combination of her concern about my fate and whereabouts, and -- and the\nbrutality and the beatings, and -- and the other thing which is so revealing about my\nmother that Sam mentions in his interview, was her almost foolhardy defiance of the\nGestapo. Of cursing them, of calling them criminals, of telling them that their\ncomeuppance would come very soon. This -- I mean, either heroism -- you know,\nthat\u2019s un-unthinkable, or foolhardiness, another thing my mother was a foolhardy\nperson. But it\u2019s an aspect that\u2019s -- is so telling about -- about her. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s --\nI don\u2019t even know if my father knew about these events. They didn\u2019t come up. I didn\u2019t\nlearn about what I just related to you, until I saw Sam\u2019s interview with the sh -- the\nSpielberg foundation.",
        "A: I would like to think that that\u2019s the case, but I have to also confess that it was not,\nagain, a conscious thing. In other words, I -- I -- I set my -- I became determined to do\nit. | even -- I mean, in -- in retrospect -- no, you know from my thi -- the other\ninterview, that I didn\u2019t even have an identity card. I -- I -- I manufactured one of them,\nwhich really would not pass scrutiny even by a -- an idiot, but fortunately we were not\nstopped. S -- the fact that -- that -- that I did it, that I didn\u2019t know where I was going to\nend up, it was something that -- that simply drove me, and if it was a part of -- a\nsimilarity in -- in character traits, that\u2019s what it is.",
        "A: He was nine.",
        "A: Well, really very little. Mekko, as we used to call him, well, his name was --\nMechalmar was his first name, was too young. An eight year difference, as you know,\nis immense among young children, although I re -- I remember I -- when he was two,\nor three, or four, I was his protector, I would take him to walks, and to play ina\nnumber of places near our house. There was a square with -- in a garden, in a\nplayground. But we did not exchange things. I -- I don\u2019t th-think I [indecipherable] my\nmother. Obviously she protected him in the sense of making sure that he was fed, and -\n- and clothed while they are -- they are hiding, under those circumstances. But, you\nknow, as you -- as you know, children sense, even much younger, so I\u2019m sure that he\nknew that these were dire times, and I -- I think someone refers the fact that actually\nthe -- the capture, the denouncement was perhaps that both children, in the last place\nof their hiding, they went out to play in the streets. And maybe more than they should\nhave, and therefore, seeing strange faces, perhaps, gave some people who were not\nparticularly sympathetic to the situation, to spread the word. Not maybe maliciously,\nbut once these kinds of things came in, well, there are strangers in this neighborhood,\nyou gotta remember that the people who discovered them were Greeks collaborating\nwith the Germans, and who perhaps, a the -- I -- of -- out of ideological reasons, but in\norder to maintain their jobs, they became more zealous than -- or more\n[indecipherable] than the king, as the saying goes. So they went out of their way to --\nyou know, to -- to chalk up captures. And that\u2019s how it happened, because they\nexposed themselves a little bit more than -- than they should have. But at the same\ntime, they were young children, and they had to get out and play.",
        "A: La -- I\u2019ve asked Sam about that. There is no -- no one knows who did -- if there was\nreally someone, or more than one who actually denounced. I think simply, as I say, the\nword spread around there were strangers in the neighborhood. This got picked up by\nthese roving collaborators. Now, what is known, however, is that when they were\ntaken to the detention -- to -- to the offices of the -- of the Gestapo, and -- and the\nnames are very well known, the two or three Jews, including this horrible man named\nHasson, who was a terrible collaborator with the Nazis, who made it his job to go and\ndiscover hiding Jews, and -- and -- and -- and capture them. So in -- in -- no one\nknows, really who -- single person, or other people who did the da -- see -- see -- see --\none of the unknowns.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yes, according to Sam, he -- they were taken to Gestapo headquarters. Now, let\u2019s\nnot think that they really went to the office of the chief of the Gestapo in Athens. The\nger -- the Germans, they had a -- a major office building in the center of Athens, not\nvery far from Constitution Square, which was known as the commandatura, which was\na c-combined office of the headquarters of the German occupation forces 1n -- in\nAthens, the Gestapo had. And because it was a large office building, it had also a -- a\nlarge basement. That\u2019s where they were -- they were taken for interrogation. Let me\njust simply tell you that I don\u2019t know if it is -- what kind of poetic justice, or anything\nlike this, when I was taken by the gendarmerie after -- that\u2019s where I was taken, in the\nsame place. But that\u2019s where they were taken.",
        "A: We have ta-talked about that. I think essentially, one -- if one has to take a single\nreason -- well, first of all, let\u2019s say two. One that at their arrival in Auschwitz, 1n the\nmorning of August 16, of 1944, parathetically -- can I say how I -- we know that? Yes,\nbecause I looked at the da -- the so-called danuta Auschwitz chronicles as they are\nknown, which is entries, almost like a diary every day of oc-occurrences. And the\nentry for August 16, it talks about the almost 2000 Rhodesian Jews. It doesn\u2019t tell the\ncomplete story, there were another har -- 600 non-Rhodesian Jews among them, my\nmother and -- and -- and brothers. They arrived there, and in the -- this of course,\nfamous separation, the re -- the single reason that he was moved to -- towards the labor\ncamp, was because of his height. He was only -- \u201944 -- he was 14 years old, but he was\na lot taller than his age, and he also credits the fact that the month detention in Hidari\noutside of Athens before the transport, where he was forced to do stupid, meaningless\nlabor of moving rocks from one place to the other, had -- and the food was good, also,\nthere, amazing because it was the Red Cross who were feeding them, that he -- he\ngained enough muscle so that in the separation, he was then pointed to be taken to\nlabor -- all right -- to the labor camp. Once then in the labor camp, after the famous\nthree or four weeks of so-called quarantine, then he was taken to a section of\nAuschwitz called the boodi, which was a set of farms that were being worked on by a\ncombination of Polish and German farmers, and the inmates were doing the -- the hard\nlabor. But the survival in boodi, in particular then the survival in the famous Death\nMarch in the winter of \u201945, when Auschwitz got shut down because of the Russians\ncoming in, and they were taken elsewhere. Sam credits it to the care of older men, who\ntook him, as they did also other, younger kids, under their wings. In particular in\nprotecting them about -- especially what not to do. And what to be a-a-aware of,\nbecause as we know, human beings in those circumstances did terrible things to each\nother, stealing bread, just sort of pure survival. So he believes very strongly that one or\ntwo people took him also under their wing, and -- and it was through them that he was\nable to survive.",
        "A: Well, re-re-recall that I came to the United States on a student scholarship,\ntherefore believing that after my studies were over, I would return to Greece, and\nresume my life there. Why Sam stayed, I have really mulled this very much, and I -- I -\n- I don\u2019t have a -- a -- you know, an answer that I can be a hundred percent sure, but\nboth my parents were really maniacal, I think, about making sure that we were well --\nwell educated. I -- the decision for me to become an engineer was cast at the -- I think\nthe moment I was born, I think, f -- by my father in particular.",
        "A: R-Right, right. Or -- or an accountant, as -- as he was. And I think that there was a -\n- a particular event. In 1952, Sam had, I think, just barely finished high school. He --\nhe may have been thinking -- I think he did, about going to university, possibly for\ncommercial studies. But at the same time, coincidentally, my father retired from his\noccupation of -- his job that had gone on for 40 years, practically. And there were no\npension plans as we know them here, but he was given a large final severance amount,\nwhich he then decided to -- to -- to use to invest in going into business with somebody\nwho actually was the brother of my stepmother. My father had remarried, and so he\nstarted this business, and I think -- I think -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m almost sure, that it isn\u2019t that my\nfather didn\u2019t push Sam to continue, or to -- to -- to pursue university work, but starting\na business, he thought that it would be a wonderful thing to bring my brother in, so\nthat he would also learn the business, and grow with it, and eventually of course,\ninherit it. Unfortunately, it failed for many, many reasons, including the fact that my\nfather, while he was a wonderful accountant, was not a businessman. Plus also that his\nbrother-in-law and partner turned out to be a crook. And -- and in -- in the meantime\nthen, Sam had also married, and that\u2019s why I think he stayed.",
        "A: No, look, although by the time I left, and I -- I know now that my father had started\nall his efforts to secure a scholarship for me, or -- or some means for me to go and\nstudy abroad. He even wrote letters to Churchill, inflating -- I mean, the truth, beyond\n-- you know, any conceivable acceptable level of -- of -- of -- of recognition. It\u2019s true\nthat at one time, during the occupation, two Jews of the British army, that had, you\nknow, been stranded in Greece, and were hiding, w -- they -- we -- hi -- hid them in\nour house for overnight. In his letter to Churchill, he inflated these [indecipherable |\narrangement of British troops, and -- and -- and he was asking for no compensation of\nany kind, other then op -- an opportunity for his son to have an opportunity to study in\nEngland, if possible. The fact is that also he was starting the same thing with B\u2019nai\nBrith, because he was a member of the B\u2019nai Brith. In -- in fact, he kept all of these\nthings totally secret from me. I had no idea what was happening until one -- when it\nwas a done deal, essentially, and he told me at one time. And actually, my first\nreaction was to -- to say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to her -- leave you.\u201d You know. I\u2019m saying\nall of that -- forgive again the detour -- to tell you that -- I mean, my leaving, and --\nand -- and his decision that I go and study abroad, the sacrifices that my father would\nundergo to see his son educated, had no bounds. And I think that under other\ncircumstances, he would have pushed Sam to do the same thing, even if then that\nmeant that he would be left alone, you know, with two sons away. But as I said, the --\nthe -- this maniacal thing for education was so strong, the only countervaley thing, I\nthink was that -- that -- that coincidentally he was starting a business, and therefore he\nsaw that there was another avenue that would be open for my brother to advance. I\nspeculate -- and I was telling this to my wife last night, that if my mother had been\nalive, Sam would not have gone into that business, she would have pushed him,\nregardless, to go and -- and -- and -- and study.",
        "A: Yes, well not -- not -- yes, of course, 1-1 -- my father immediately then contacted a\ncousin -- our cousins, and it was they who then knew the Times\u2019 correspondent who\nthen talked to -- to the archbishop, Thamaskinos. And it was that way that I was -- I\nwas set free.",
        "A: Very well -- ah, I -- I saw that question, I was laughing a little bit because I have --\nI have to tell you what -- what happened. There was not, as in for example, Bulgaria.\nYou know, in spite of all the talk about the Bulgarians saving 50,000 Jews, it\u2019s true\nthat -- that they were not killed, but not what then the Bulgarians began to claim. But\nthe Bulgarians, as you know, marched with their feet, and -- and from 48,000, there are\nonly 3000 left. There was less of the mass exodus from Greece, but th -- recall also,\nthat out of a population of 77,000 pre-war, only about six or 7000 survived. And I\nthink in one of your questions was how many wer -- were sheltered. The best numbers\nthat one has, about five or 6000 found shelter, either with Greek Christian families, or\nin the mountains. I don\u2019t mean the resistance, they just went up there, and were able to\nhide and lose themselves in -- in the population in the parts of Greece that they were\nknown as free Greece, which included the region where I was. About 1300 were the --\nin the resistance, in any case. But very shortly -- I mean, mid \u201945, immediately we had\nvisitors from Israel, and I still remember young Israelis, but Greek speaking Israelis,\nbut totally different, and -- and darkened from sun, and -- and full of muscle, and --\npeasants. I mean, things out there that you don\u2019t necessarily associate with the\nappearance of -- of -- of Jews, especially those that live in cities who are -- live soft\nlives. In any case, they had been sent on purpose to recruit young men to come to\nIsrael. And as you know, they did. Quite a few were then sent to what\u2019s called\nAkshara, which was sort of a preparatory school for three or four weeks, to teach the\nrudiments of living in a kibbutz. And then it was -- all of 1t was clandestine, because\none night, in -- at night -- and they were taken by boat to ships that were not in\nterritorial Greek waters, and there they were taken, and then taken to Greece again in\nsecret, because they didn\u2019t come as part of the British quotas, they were trying to\nviolate. And some of them were caught and incarcerated in Cypress, in any case. So I -\n- I was, and some of my friends, lobbied intensely by the Israelis to come to Palestine,\nbut the reason I\u2019m laughing 1s -- y-you -- it\u2019s -- I recollect, and -- and I -- I think it\u2019s so\nunreal. Most of our preoccupation in questi -- questioning the Israelis about what kind\nof government are we going to have, if eventually a state is formed. Because our\nexperience, you know, in the mountains, and things like this is we need to be\ndemocratic, and you know, almost Socialistic, and things like -- th-the Israelis would\nlook at us as though w-we were nuts, and say, \u201cLook, w-we have many things to do\nbefore w-we come to that point. The first thing to do is to try to -- to make sure that we\nbecome a state. When we become a state, then people will ha -- will -- will vote,\u201d and -\n- and we were surely looking for reassurances ahead of time. Well, and that was --\nthere was a very strong thing. The reason I didn\u2019t become extremely serious, you\nknow, to the point of taking action, what they say -- first of all, A, I couldn\u2019t leave my\nfather. Sam had not even yet appeared on the scene when these events of the contact\nwith the Israelis occurred. Sam had not e -- yet returned, number one, and two, of\ncourse, the Israelis had departed, and then of course the British clamped down, and it\nwasn\u2019t even possible to do that any more. And then of course, my departure from the\nUnited States, you know, made this thing a moot point. But yes, there was a very\nstrong period of I would say two or three months, where practically I got on the boat to\ngo to Palestine.",
        "A: Right. The first two were my scholarship, and -- and my second cousin, Jeff Levis.\nWe left at the same time. First of all we -- even after everything was put 1n place -- you\nknow, in addition to all the paperwork, visas, this and the other, examination by the\nAmerican consul that we were at least mildly proficient in -- in English, enough to --\nto claim that we were going to go and study in -- in an American university. But the\nmajor th -- thing that -- that -- that -- that one had to wait for -- and that nothing could\nbe done about it, was to wait for passage, because there were no -- there was not much\nshipping still, it hadn\u2019t been fully restored. So it took about another four or five\nmonths of waiting to get booking on -- on a ship. So there were two -- it wasn\u2019t done\non the basis, let\u2019s say, of competition. It was -- I ad -- really wa --",
        "A: My father\u2019s letter writing, and his cousin, you know, Joseph Levi, that, you know,\nreally made th -- there was -- I know now that two other such scholarships were given.\nThey were not scholastic achievements, it was simply th-that -- that Jews in the United\nStates sponsored us. Although it was B\u2019nai Brith money, which it certainly didn\u2019t last\nmore than one year. And I didn\u2019t know that. And -- and the only reason I was able to\ncontinue was because the university then picked up the -- the sc -- the scholarship. So\nthat\u2019s how it happened.",
        "A: Well by -- by boat, yes. The Volcania. It was two Italian ships that had been used\nduring the war as transports. It had a sister ship called -- Volcania -- not -- not\nLusitania, but it\u2019s is -- same Italian -- kind of Italian name, I\u2019ll -- \u20191l remember in a\nmoment. It took about 13 to 14 days because we stopped in Genoa to pick up other\npassengers, and -- you know, it wasn\u2019t a very fast ship. And it took about, you know,\nmaybe 12 days to get to the United States.",
        "A: F-For at least four years, for any -- four years, for at least four years. Well, of\ncourse, other than -- than items of clothing, I took very little else. Two or three\nmementos. First of all, for the man who sponsored me, who had to sign an affidavit of\nsupport as it was called, who I never met in my life, he lived in Kalamazoo, Michigan,\nhis name was Osias Souvairdling, my father gave me a present to give him, which was\n-- must have been a very dear thing for him, it was a -- a cigarette case. He didn\u2019t even\nknow if the man smoked, but it was really done of silver filigree, I think of -- of -- of\nwire, intricately done, and which I eventually sent to Mr. Souvairdling to thank him\nprofoundly, when ha -- as I say, we never met. And so we came to New York, we\nstopped for three or four days, seeing relatives in New York. Jeff had a --",
        "A: Yes, Benjamin, and I stayed with him overnight. And then -- after all, we were also\nlate, because it was end of October, and this -- and the semester had already started, so\nwe were already a month and a half late. So we left New York to go to Chicago, and in\nChicago then we parted because, you see, both of us had no choice, we were not given\na choice about what schools to attend. We each told what we wanted to study and\nB\u2019nai Brith then found the appropriate schools. I was then sent to the University of\nIllinois. So in Chicago we said good-bye to each other, I took the train down to\nChampagne, and he took the train to Iowa, because he went to Iowa State.",
        "A: Well, all right, they were distinct. New York was of course something that only one\nsaw in pictures, and in books, and still one had to -- to -- to really marvel at the c -- the\n-- the -- the sorts of things tha-that were hard to even imagine. Taken to the automat\nfor example, I mean, the idea of pushing a nickel and then being served a meal was --\nyou know, not only strange, but for -- for -- especially mechanically minded people\nlike myself. In Illinois it was very different because, you know, I arrived there the\nnight in -- on November the third or fourth of \u201946. It happened to be the day before the\nsemi -- the -- the biennial elections -- not presidential, but for two-thirds of the Senate,\nand the whole House of Representatives. And -- and -- and -- you know, naively, and -\n- and -- and I found out the following day that at that time, easily, about half of the\npeople in the fraternity where I was being given room and board -- which was another\nthing that the B\u2019nai Brith had arranged for me to do at the AEPi house, the majority of\nthem were veterans themselves, fliers, soldiers. And then when I asked them are they\nvoting tomorrow in the elections, and they said, \u201cWhat elections?\u201d I was -- it was the\nbiggest, first initial shock in my life, because one in Europe associated political\nawareness and movement always with university students. That\u2019s where also the\nferment would take place. And to -- to find out that the supreme indifference, and --\nand a -- and e-eventually, this 1s -- became really, from -- from a critical thing, became\nan endearing aspect of American life, that I liked.",
        "A: [indecipherable] or something like that. Or -- or maybe the other thing that all\npoliticians are -- are -- are -- are not worth paying attention to.",
        "A: Well, all right, language of course was really a bit of a problem, but it didn\u2019t take\nme very long to -- to acquire language. The nice thing a -- the ni -- the good aspect --\nnot the good, the -- the -- the tolerable aspect was that for engineering, really language\nwas not that essential. Or at least a very strong component. Some of the first courses\none had to take, which first of all amazed me, was that I had to take, you know,\nalgebra. Algebra. I had gone to a special high school in -- in Greece, preparatory to\nentering the Polytechnic Institute. What is -- algebra was already a foregone thing.\nAnd in fact, the first day I got to -- to that class, and I\u2019m sitting there, and -- and -- and\nI see the instructor laboring over a formula, and -- and -- and very diffidently I asked if\nI could show another way, and I went, and then I showed the solution, and afterwards,\nat the end of the session, he asked me to stay back, and he said he knew about my\narrival, and he knew that I was -- I came from Europe and education was stronger\nthere, and he asked me not to come back again. He says, \u201cIll give you an A, don\u2019t\nshow up in class any more.\u201d So I was able to overcome that. So I -- I believe that --\nthat I had some facility for languages, and so it didn\u2019t become that much of an\nobstacle.",
        "A: Really, I must a-admit that -- that -- that except for occasional bouts of -- not\nloneliness, of not really being with a relative or a friend, but there was so much to\nabsorb from every aspect. Life in it\u2019s little ins -- insignificant a-aspects, wa -- the\nshops, the stores, university life. Life in a fraternity, what young people did, what\ninterested them. It is -- it was so -- so -- there was practically no time to really begin to\nfeel any deprivation at all. The first time that happened was at the end of the first year,\nwhen suddenly the summer vacation [indecipherable] what am I gonna do?",
        "A: Yes. So I really went to New York, and stayed with my uncle, and I was working in\nhis factory, he was a manufacturer of dresses. Well, when the people in B\u2019nai Brith\nfound out that that\u2019s what I was doing, they were horrified. I don\u2019t know why. So then\nthey arranged for me to go to a special camp that was run by the Quakers. They had\nsix or seven of them around the country, but typically what it would be, the Quakers --\nthe Friends -- the American Friends Service Committee would invite f -- foreign\nstudents, about 35 to 40, put them in a place, usually a -- a private school, the grounds\nfor a private school that -- since it was vacation time, and we would stay there for\nalmost eight weeks, and the idea was to talk about life and -- and f-foreign affairs, and\nthings like this, and we had every week some prominent individual from the\nuniversity, a professor would come, or -- either of political science, or psychology, and\nhe would lecture, and he would hold a -- a -- a -- a -- discussions under a tree. You\nknow, kind of a thing and exchange ideas. And then of course, play games, go\nswimming, and things like this, and that\u2019s -- that\u2019s how tha -- th-th -- it was a first time\nwhen I suddenly found myself almost detached because the -- the house, the fraternity\nhouse closed, school was closed, I was going to go to summer school. And that\u2019s the\nfirst time that it hit me that now I\u2019m again alone and on my own.",
        "A: Well, since I had no -- I had a brief semester which I went to the Polytechnic and\nstill living at home, I -- I don\u2019t want to say it was strange, or -- or -- everything was\nstrange for me, everything was new, and I had nothing to compare -- of course I had\nthen, eventually a -- other schoolmates who didn\u2019t live in fraternities, who lived in\ndorms, or who lived in -- in rooming houses. What -- what I found --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Well, as I said, I guess, since it was all new, I had to -- to absorb and ac -- and sort\nof accept, because I had no other frame of reference against which to compare. The\nonly thing that certainly was a bit peculiar, at least to me, was that so much time was\nspent in -- in games, and recreation, as compared to study. But even within this type of\nenvironment, one was not obligated to do anything. I mean, there were certain events\nthat one had to participate in, but what one did with one\u2019s free time, it was up to\nindividual. So again it was -- 1t was a very good introduction to an aspect of American\nlife, namely that you don\u2019t have to conform to exactly a particular pattern. It was some\nof it you had to do, some of it was entirely voluntary. And I -- I know that there were\nsome fraternity brothers who were Americans, and who, like me, did not participate in\nall the games, and superficial other activities, and who were much more serious in\nstudies, and things like that.",
        "A: Yes, and again, since I have no other way to compare it, I would have to ask myself\nwhere if I had simply had a room in it, or -- or a place in a dorm, or -- or -- or ina\nrooming house, would I be able to, al-almost in one fell swoop, be a brother to f -- to\n40 or 50 other people? I-It wouldn\u2019t have happened.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: None, none. Of course, there -- there is a similarity, you know, whenever groups of\npeople do similar things together, there are ties and camaraderies, and of course I leave\nout a big -- I was in the mountains, that\u2019s a different story, and participated in an\naction, and so forth, but in the American army I was not in any battle situation.\nBecause there is a special ties that get formed when people share dangers. In the army,\nwhat was shared in the beginning was, during basic training, where you undergo a\nmixture of both discipline that 1s -- has some meaning, and a lot of mindless nonsense,\nwhich has even particular words in the -- in American army that we will not mention\nnow in -- you know, the tape.",
        "A: All right, the fraternity was called AEPi, Alpha Epsilon Pi. It was a Jewish\nfraternity, one of about, if I recall at that time, either five or six Jewish fraternities on\nthe Champagne Urbana campus of the University of Illinois.",
        "A: And -- and most of, I think of the 40 or 50 individuals, me -- students at that time, I\nthink 90 percent were residents of Illinois from various parts, mostly from Chicago.\nAnd the rest were really from practically other parts of the country, there were three or\nfour New Yorkers, one from -- two from outside of Boston. And obviously I was -- I\nwas the only -- the only foreigner.",
        "A: None. None.",
        "A: Right, yes. After finishing the Bachelor\u2019s degree, 1 -- it coincided with the advent of\nthe Korean war, 1950. When I got my Bachelor\u2019s degree, then that summer, the war in\nKorea started. A -- a number of friends and so forth, who thought they were be of\nimminent draftable age, did a number of things, including going to graduate school\nwhich they never thought or intended to go, in order to get deferments. Other even\nwent to the length of quickly getting married, so they would be supporters of family.\nAnd then I -- I was told that I would be given a -- an assistanceship, a research\nassistanceship to continue to graduate school, which then enabled me to go through the\nMaster\u2019s degree. Then I decided to continue on for the doctorate. And I went for the\nadditional year, including then taking the oral exams. And the oral exams were -- were\n-- took place on June third, 1953, the date of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth. So I\npassed the oral. So what was left to d -- to -- to do was to write the thesis, and in fact\nmy advisor and I had selected the topic, but I had run out of money. And there was no\n-- the assist-assistanceship funding was over. So it was a question of how I mi -- a --\ngoing to be able to support myself. My professor had arranged for me -- my advisor to\nwork for the summer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, just for the summer. And then,\nafter taking the orals, I was offered a permanent position at Bell Laboratories. Well, I\ntalked to my professor, and he said, \u201cAll right, it\u2019s a little -- rarely done, but it can be\ndone. You can arrange for to write the thesis in absentia.\u201d Which was the plan.\nUnfortunately I was drafted a year later, and -- although after my release from the\narmy, I intended to continue on -- to try to -- to write the thesis by -- in the meantime,\nat the University of Illinois, they stopped allowing thesis to be written in absentia,\nbecause of pressure from the legislature. And that sort of put an end to -- to that quest.",
        "A: What I was going to write the thesis on.",
        "A: Well, the topic we had selected was this, the realization of electrical networks, with\nreal components.",
        "A: A little bit, because since I was drafted, less tha -- in about a year after my starting\narm -- permanent position at Bell Laboratories, there was a two year a -- in -- almost\ntwo years intervening in the army. When I returned, I changed departments, and I\njoined a completely brand new department, which really was going to, and did the\nwork in -- in -- in the totally new generation of telephone exchanges, digital instead of\nthe older variety. Which almost had nothing to do whatsoever with any of the special\nacademic interests that I had. It was -- it was a new universe, essentially of computers,\nand that\u2019s what to -- got me into that field.",
        "A: Right. This is something that we have not covered at all because it was not covered\nin the earlier interview. While I -- I was studying for the orals, in April of 40 thre -- 40\n-- of \u00b053, my landlady tells me that somebody\u2019s -- wants to talk to me, a gentleman\nappears, hands me a letter, I open it up, it\u2019s from the immigration naturalization\nservice, I\u2019m to depart United States within two weeks. Why? He says, \u201cLook, I\u2019m only\nthe messenger.\u201d Well, you can understand my state of mind. I got on the train, went to\nChicago where I had friends, told them the situation. The long and the short is they\nintervened. I mean, they got me to talk to a congressman, who then talked to the\nimmigration department, immigration department renewed my stay for another year.\nSo I thought that was going to be the end of that, right? Without my knowing -- I had\ntold one of my professors what had happened , and while I was in Chicago, and even\nafter my return two or three days later, without my knowing, four professors wrote to\nthe then Senator Dograss of Illinois, who introduced a private bill in congress, and\neventually became a law, known as the law for the relief of Isaac Ne-Nehama. It was\nsigned by President Eisenhower, and by law I became a -- I was accepted as an\nimmigrant, outside of the student visa restrictions, because student visa is a restricted\nclass, where you are not allowed to -- to stay permanently. So I was now, because of\nthe special bill, I was now a special -- a -- a -- an immigrant. So I would have to wait\nfor my five years, you know, to be -- to gain citizenship. But being inducted into the\narmy, automatically within six months, then you become a citizen, for the very\nobvious reason that a country cannot ask you to defend it, and at the same time not\nrecognizing you as a citizen.",
        "A: So I became a naturalized citizen in Colorado Springs, Colorado.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m eve -- I\u2019m very embarrassed to read the -- because I was\ninvestigated by the FBI, I mean, they had to go and interview them, and the glowing\nterms, I mean, make me blush even today when I read them.",
        "A: Right. But 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- 1 -- a personal aspect of my life is that it -- that just before I\nwent in the army, I got married. In fact, I lived with my first wife in Colorado Springs,\nbecause after basic training in New Jersey, I was then sent to the fifth army\u2019s headq --\nschool -- signal school in Colorado Springs. And since in the army it\u2019s very important\n-- Or even more important what you don\u2019t do, than what you do, instead of cleaning\npots or -- or -- or being in the trenches, I was teaching in the signal school, reserve\nofficers who were passing every three months, to take refresher courses in radio,\ntelephony, and things like that. So that\u2019s where I spent my -- my two years. Upon our\nreturn then, to New Jersey, I resumed my work at Bell Laboratories, but then there was\na -- arift, and in 1957, I was divorced.",
        "A: Her name was Ann Greenberg. I -- I -- I -- two summers -- after the first summer I\nmentioned to you earlier, with the Quaker camp, I worked in the Poconos in a camp\nfor boys and girls, as a waiter, to earn pocket money. And was very often sufficient to\n-- to -- to allow me to buy a -- an occasional movie ticket. Because the scholarship just\nsimply provided room and board, nothing else. But then I had a friend and when\nfinally I wa -- began to start working at Bell Laboratories stationed in New York City,\nthen this friend that I had met in the camp told me about a young lady who was an --\nan -- a friend of hers, and that\u2019s how I -- I met Ann. And so we were going out\ntogether, and in fact when I got my notice from the draft board to present myself for\ntraining, Ann -- I can only tell you subs -- from subsequent information -- her own\nparents were divorced, it was a -- arather unhappy marriage, and she convinced me. I\nmaybe n-not have taken a lot of convincing, I was a little bit hesitant because, you\nknow, going into the army, goodness knows where I could be shipped. But she was\npersuasive enough to tell me that she would accompany me wherever we went, if it\n[indecipherable] allowed. The long and the short is we -- we got married. And she\nwent to school in Colorado Springs, at the university because she eventually intended\nto go to medical school. When we return, lived in New Jersey, she enrolled at NYU.\nAnd she was -- began to have problems. First of all, academic problems, and then one\nday she disappeared. The long and the short is I found out through a physician who\nwas -- knew her from -- since childhood, that according to him, she was a\nschizophrenic. And he -- who -- and this -- this man urged me to simply get away as\nfast as I could. I was -- my reaction was, you know, \u201cYou\u2019re just telling me that I\u2019m\ndealing with a sick person, and you\u2019re telling me to abandon a sick person?\u201d But he\nconvinced me that it\u2019s the kind of a thing that has no hope for -- for cure, and -- and it\nwould have been almost an impossibility. The long and the short is that I got a quick\ndivorce in Mexico. It was consensual, it wasn\u2019t contested or anything like that. That\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: All right, all right. Well, you know, there was always a kind of phrase to describe\nthe Bell system. We used to refer to 1 -- 1 -- to it as -- collectively as Mother Bell. So\none can conjure up a -- an older woman, rather buxom, you know. Warm, that you feel\nwarm in -- in -- in -- in -- near her. Well, in other words, 1t was a magnificent\npreparation for a career, because first of all you -- you were among individuals of\nextreme capability. Bell Laboratories recruited only the upper one percent of graduates\nin American universities. So there were no idiots there, and -- and you couldn\u2019t really\nmake it through with hot air, you would be found out right away. So it was a -- a very,\nvery demanding -- well, not demanding, but -- but really very mar-marvelous\npreparation. By the same token, it was a -- an extremely inbred thing. We -- we\nthought collectively that we knew everything. And -- so in -- there was a little bit of a\nstruggle because there was no formal thing. My dreams always were that when I\nstarted my career, I would be taken under the wing of an experienced person who\nwould take me slowly through the -- and it didn\u2019t happen. It isn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t learn\nthings from colleagues, I did, a great deal. But there was no former -- you were\nessentially left on your own. And there came times I think almost three or four weeks\nafter I started, that I really had terrible time believing that I was earning my paycheck\nunder false pretenses. That -- that I wasn\u2019t doing anything valuable. But I very quickly\ngot over that, because I began to do serious things. And then I got drafted, and I return,\na-and -- and then it happened that we were working on the first field trial of this first\never new telephone exchange, what has taken Bell Laboratories biggest department of\n400 people, six or seven years to prepare for the field trial in Modess, Illinois. And I\nstarted the -- the -- the system, and I came to the conclusion that it will not work. Not -\n- not that it will not work, that it -- it would not accommodate the kind of capacity that\nit was aimed to, something like 20,000 or 40,000 subscribers. My analysis showed that\nit would barely make it for 2000 subscribers. Well, it was solid enough thing that my\nown supervisor believed it, and f -- you know, typically then I was -- I gave it a -- a\npresentation. And of course the first reaction was one of horrible shock and -- and --\nand -- and -- and disdain, but the stuff was solid enough, and that was -- I became a --\nimmediately a rising star. I was almost, I think, thrown out into the street, and within a\nweek I became a fair haired boy, and I got promoted, became a first promotion\nsupervisor. But then I got the notion, a year after I became promoted that I really\nwanted to be in a higher stratum of research, and I left and went to the Rand\nCorporation in California, where I was going to work, believe it or not, it was a joke,\nreally to [indecipherable] subsequently on artificial intelligence, because two people\nwho had written some papers, told me that they had funding from the Air Force to start\nan effort, and I wanted to be a participant there. When I got there, simply the -- the\nplans were totally different, never as I said, and that experience at Rand was, in itself\nof a different kind, but equally rewarding. Your --",
        "A: I stayed for two years. Then one f -- day I got a call from my former boss at Bell\nLaboratories, who was ready to retire, and who told me that the Bell system had been\nasked by the government to assist the government in the Apollo program. And he was\nsimply asking me where I would talk to him. And he asked me not to hang up on him.\nI said, \u201cI respect you too much to do that.\u201d The long and the short 1s they -- and I\u2019m\ntalking about -- I -- but I don\u2019t know anything about rockets is what -- I don\u2019t know\neither, and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m 65 and I\u2019m willing to learn. The long and the short 1s that -- do\nyou want to hear a interesting story?",
        "A: All right, good. I -- because I had a lot of leave coming, I flew to east, I spoke to\nthem, I came back, I spoke with Paulette, and I decided to reject their offer, that I was\nhappy what I was doing at Rand. That was a weekend. On Monday I go back to my\noffice at Rand, and the telephone rings, and it\u2019s the secretary of the president of the\nRand corporation. She says, \u201cFrank Wright to see you.\u201d I had met him once. What\u2019s\nthe president to do with me? I go to his office, he greets me, he says, \u201cI -- I understand\nyou\u2019re considering leaving us.\u201d I was, you know, f -- absolutely -- you know, and it\nshowed in my face. H-He saw it, he says, \u201cW-W-Wait,\u201d he said. \u201cit isn\u2019t anything\nnefarious, we don\u2019t have a -- a secret police. It\u2019s very simple. Julian West,\u201d who was\nthe vice president at Bell Laboratories with whom I had talked to that previous day or\ntwo, \u201cis a West Point classmate of mind, and he called me, he told me that they want\nyou. And so what do you think you are doing?\u201d So I told him, \u201cI\u2019m going to stay.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cFantastic.\u201d I sit down, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Well. He said, \u201cAnd what do you\nthink of the Apollo program?\u201d So I began to say, \u201cWell, this is probably the biggest\nthing since the building of the pyramids, the greatest,\u201d -- so I didn\u2019t know that he was\nalmost setting a -- a -- a trap, and I was waxing so eloquently about, you know, going\nto the moon. Then he said, \u201cI -- I th -- I think like you do.\u201d He says, \u201cLet m -- let me\ntell you -- let\u2019s do the following,\u201d he says. \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go? Within -- because if\nyou don\u2019t, you may regret it later that you didn\u2019t participate. But you go, and within\ntwo or three months, you will know whether it\u2019s really s-suits you. If 1t doesn\u2019t, come\nback. There\u2019|l always be a place for you here.\u201d\u201d What a wise individual. So I -- I --",
        "A: [indecipherable] and that was the end of it. I -- I didn\u2019t return.",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s why we came to -- to Washington.",
        "A: Yes, from 1962, till 1968. And this is at what -- at that point where already the\nplans for Apollo already had matured. My department -- I was head of one of the five\ndepartments in the company. We were already beginning to think about voyages to\nMars, believe it or not. But another opportunity o -- arose. A friend of this boss of\nmine, who re -- who attracted me back to the -- to -- to the Bell system, then had a -- a\n-- a wealthy individual friend who lived in f -- in Philadelphia, and who was willing to\nfund new companies. And the long and the short is that I left the Bell system, and I\nfounded my own company.",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s an unmistakable time because I don\u2019t -- it ha -- is -- 1t has been studied, it\nhas been written up, namely how so much enthusiasm, because fo -- you could see --\nand I traveled a great deal, because this program was all over the United States, we\ndidn\u2019t think about nine to five, or working hours, weekends. The enthusiasm there, of\ngoing and doing something like this was so [indecipherable] and -- and -- and -- and it\n-- it encompassed practically hundreds of thousands of engineers, and -- and people\naround the country. The enthusiasm was -- was great. It has not been replicated. But if\nI may tell you that things like this have occurred, and I can assure you that I have not\nreally been an instrument in choosing the situations, but throughout my career, Bell\nLaboratories, the new telephone system, then the Apollo program, the Rand\nCorporation artificial intelligence. In other words, what I\u2019m trying to emphasize is that\nthese things occur both in companies as well as 1n -- even in countries, very rarely,\nwhere you undertake something where there is no precedent. Because when you are in\nsituations like this, then ideas flow freely. When you are in a -- 1n a environment with\na lot of tradition, and you say, \u201cWell, what about this thing?\u201d Then they\u2019ll say, \u201cLook,\nwe ve tried that.\u201d Or, \u201cWe don\u2019t do things like this around here.\u201d When you are in a\nnew situation, then all ideas are given free reign. Now, all of them are not equally\ngood, and some could be good, or even better than what was -- which -- which was in,\nbut even countries don\u2019t have the luxury of pursuing two or three avenues in parallel.\nSo to be in a -- in -- in a -- in a -- in an environment like this, it\u2019s the -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nalmost like getting drunk, or smoking -- which I don\u2019t know what smoking pot or any\nof these things would be, but it\u2019s -- I remember the early 50\u2019s in the Bell Laboratories.\nUnless you are either under narcosis or an utter idiot, you couldn\u2019t help but stumble on\nnew inventions, on new ideas. It was a kind of a ferment that occurs very, very\ninfrequently in the lives of companies, or the survivors in -- in even the\n[indecipherable]. Somehow it occurred two or three times 1n my career. None because\nI chose them like this, just pure luck.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. Yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah, [indecipherable]",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Well, Apollo was -- was -- was -- was done on purpose by the Kennedy speech in\nCongress --",
        "A: -- to send a man to the moon. The fact that it was done not so much in response to\nSputnik alone. I mean, we were pursuing manned space flight. The Russians beat us by\na year, but as events eventually showed, really, eventually the a -- the American\ntechnological superiority is what made -- made the difference.",
        "A: Oh, James Webb, yes. James Webb was the -- the -- the first administrator. A very\nfunny thing I will tell you. He --",
        "A: Of NASA, oh -- NASA. He was a very ki -- a -- he was primarily a --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Right, James Webb, who was the first and really strongest NASA administrator.\nBut there -- there\u2019s a vignette about Webb which I think that you\u2019ll find amusing.\nAround 1954, he was interviewed by the New York Times, and there were many\nquestions, and one of the questions he was asked was phrased as follows, he said -- he\nwas -- he was told, \u201cMr. Webb, it\u2019s been said that the Russian space program 1s a very\nmethodical program, you know, because they had started with a manned thing, then\nyou send one individual, then a woman, then two. How would you characterize the\nAmerican program?\u201d He said, \u201cOur program is just as methodical, if not more so than\nthe Russian. Every step we take depends on the next.\u201d And that\u2019s Mr. Webb, all right?",
        "A: All right. It was 1968. My revered, late, former boss Dr. Lovell, a prominent man,\ninventor with 300 patents to his name, prolific individual, and extremely wonderful.\nHe told me one day that his friend was looking to fund a starting company, was I --\nwas I interested? And the long and the short was that we made a deal, and essentially, I\nreally didn\u2019t even know what, specifically we were going to do other than to really get\ninto the area of computers, and -- and software, but not concrete ideas. But very\nquickly after our formation, a couple of fortuitous events occur. The first one was that\nmy former boss at the company that I worked, part of the Bell system that was doing\nthe work on the Apollo program, the company was called Bellcom, and it was, of\ncourse, situated in Washington, that\u2019s what brought us from California here. He also\nhad, later on, a year after I left, had moved on to other things, had become chief\nexecutive of another company. And he called me on the phone one day, and he said\nthat one of the -- the subsidiaries, who were doing work in -- around the country, they\nwere -- in fact they had almost a virtual monopoly of race track systems. That is to say\nthose systems where they display the odds, and also people go into the windows and\nbet. But that company, the subsidiary, had started an attempt to computerize their\ntotes, as they were called, it\u2019s also the same name in England, from tote boards. And\nwe -- we -- could we go and -- and see about their plans? So we thought that 1t was\ngoing to be a brief engagement of about a couple of months to look over their plans. It\nturned out to be a six or seven year affair, because when we reviewed their plans, and -\n- and -- and we are -- we told them not only what was done wrong, but how to do it\nright, they said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you do it for us?\u201d And the long and the short is, and\nwhat made my company was the horses. We -- we build the first computerized systems\nin the world, and it was really yeah -- to some extent a technological innovation\nbecause we used mini-computers, which were just beginning to come into -- into play,\nprimarily as laboratory instruments. No -- no such animal had ever been used in a\nvery, not only real life situation, but betting 1s a very, very technologically demanding\nsituation, because in the half hour period between races, where all the betting\u2019s taking\nplace, the number of transactions is very, very high. And so the system had to, you\nknow, keep up with the flow thing.",
        "A: Well, a -- a mini-computer, the type that we used, would be about the size of a --\nlet\u2019s say an audio tape, no not -- not that small, but one of the units that you see on my\nshelf, possibly, let\u2019s say 20 inches wide, maybe 20 inches high, and about the same\ndepth. But as I said, they had very limited memory, and they were used only,\nprincipally at the time, tentatively as laboratory instruments to collect data on\nexperiments and things like this.",
        "A: It was called International Computing Company. My f -- boss, the man who\neventually engaged me asked me why that name. I said, \u201cWell, it would be too\nambitious to call it intergalactic, so I -- I chose International Computing Company.\u201d",
        "A: Well, the venture capital was sink -- only one source, this individual, a-and that\u2019s\nall the funding that we got. There is no question that like any young company, young\ncompanies like young humans are vulnerable, they are not fragile. But not anything\nthat we did, but the circumstances within a year after w-we got formed, things were a\nbit dicey, and we almost came, practically to disbanding the company, but we -- we\nstayed and -- and the engagement with that company to do the -- the --",
        "A: The horses, gave us enough staying power. Also our -- actually our first contract\nthat we won two months after our formation, was to win a -- a program funded by the\nnat -- National Institutes of Health, to try to see whether computers could be used in\nassisting the collection and dissemination of blood in blood banks. And we were allied\nin this particular contract with the -- the blood bank in Milwaukee, in Wisconsin. And\nit lasted for two years, and we were able to prove that indeed, because it\u2019s the -- a\nproblem of s -- not -- o-of -- of -- of inventory, because as you know, blood has a short\nlifetime of three weeks. So, it had -- computers were -- what we were able to do, ina\nreal life situation, because the Milwaukee blood center supplied about 23 hospitals in\nthe greater Milwaukee area -- the secret is the ability of the Milwaukee blood center --\nall information if a blood unit is wanted, of a particular type in one hospital, and the\ncomputer knew it was in another hospital is to transport it, sometimes even with a\ntaxicab. By contrast, the Red Cross, who was the -- and still is the biggest collector of\nblood -- privately I think it\u2019s a national disgrace, because the Red Cross doesn\u2019t, once\nit collects a unit of blood, if 1t then ships it to a hospital, it\u2019s responsibilities end there.\nNow the unit may eventually age, and then be thrown down the drain, but in -- in\nMilwaukee we -- we did not allow that, because we were able to, if something was\nneeded, then we could -- had enough authority because the Milwaukee blood center\nstill owned the blood unit.",
        "A: But the long and the short of ICC was that after the horses, then we got involved in\nsatellite communications. And I can tell you -- perhaps you know enough about\ncomputers to know that computers really don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re dealing with\nblood, or -- or horses. It\u2019s information that you are -- are -- are exchanging, so very --\nwhen we got into satellite communications, we bodily lifted elements of software from\nthe racetrack systems into satellite communications. And you tell that to people who\ndon\u2019t understand, they say, \u201cWell, how can that be?\u201d Well, [indecipherable]\nunderstand.",
        "A: Right, and made -- made -- made the company. And -- and by -- by ni -- ni -- 1987,\nand that was about 11 or 12 years after our formation, we had reached a force of about\na hundred to 120 people. And then we became -- we were courted by a number of big\ncorporations. Eventually a company called Contel, Continental Telephone, cause it\nwas the third largest telephone company in the United States, bought us. And in a\nsense this was [indecipherable] completing the circle for me. I started my career in a --\nin a telephone company, and eventually gets bought out by another telephone\ncompany.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: May I intervene for a moment to tell you about something else? Since you are\nfollowing a chronological thing. You did not ask me -- it did not occur to me to tell\nyou about some of my activities as a student in Illinois, which really are something I\ntreasure. Let me tell you --",
        "A: -- very briefly, all right? And then we can move to -- I got involved in -- in -- in an\n-- in an activity which was a -- a extramural, it had to do with studies. It was an\nactivity of students who run the concerts. The university had a season of concerts,\norchestras and soloists. And the students arranged for everything. I mean, there was a\nfaculty committee that they got involved in the transactions, who to invite, and the\ncontracts, and things like this, but the students then did everything else. Issuing the\ntickets, programs. And then when the concert took place, of -- ma -- and my job\nbecame of going to the train station and getting the visiting artist, taking them to their\nhotel, and then bringing them to the concert hall, and then afterwards for -- for dinner.\nAnd it was a very rewarding thing, because I met people like Igor Stravinsky. I was\ndispatched by the university to Chicago. He had come from New York with his wife,\nand he didn\u2019t want to take the train from Chicago to Champagne, so the president of\nthe university sent his limousine, so I went to get Igor down, and -- and I will tell you\na-- a--a little vignette, if you are interested. Shall I tell you?",
        "A: Oh, all right. Well we\u2019re -- it was February, and I picked him up from the\n[indecipherable] station, and we are getting in the limousine, we are driving, we are\ntalking in French, primarily. He was not that comfortable in English. At some point,\nabout an hour -- it\u2019s about a three hour drive, he was telling me that he had been\nsuffering from stomach problems, and his wife Vera, a magnificent Russian grand\ndame, was from time to time su -- supporting him, he said, \u201cYeah, yeah, oh she\u2019s been\nvery, very sick at times.\u201d But at some point he said, \u201cLook, I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m feeling some\npains now, would you ask the driver to stop at the next gas station, because I have a\nthermos bottle with milk in my valise, and I need to,\u201d -- of course, of course. So we\nstopped, and we opened the trunk, and -- and -- and opened the valise, the driver and I\nwere on the side, and we saw Stravinsky opening the thermos, pouring something, and\ndrinking. And after awhile he says, \u201cEverything is fine.\u201d And we got into the car, and\nthere was an unmistakable strong smell of Scotch whiskey. So, when about an hour\nlater he said he had pains again, we understood. This way I met, you know, people like\nStravinsky, and Stern, and -- and Metropolus, and Zell. Because I would go pick them\nup, and then we would always ask them, and in many cases they all did that. The only\nreward that we students had, about eight, 10 of us, for all the work was to be -- to have\ndinner after the concert with the visiting artist. That was, you know --",
        "A: Of course, and we enjoyed the concerts.",
        "A: I -- I started the violin.",
        "A: Oh, an extremely import -- I -- I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a passion. I don\u2019t play any\ninstruments, but you -- you -- I think you asked me the questions, what I -- I do for\npleasure. We can get into that, but music 1s one of them.",
        "A: Well, my father used to play the mandolin, and he at times would play, but mostly\nth-this work -- what, in Ladino and Sephardic culture, are called canteegass, from the\nSpanish word, which are -- believe ballads, although there are differences. Ballads tell\na story, canteegass mostly are usually about a love affair, or -- or one thing like that.\nBut it wasn\u2019t that they were s-so musically. We didn\u2019t have -- we had a -- a radio, but\nit wasn\u2019t a musical thing, but in the whole process of -- of being well rounded, then I\nwas sent to the conservatory in Athens, and I took classes 1n the violin, until \u201941 when\nalso again because of the occupation, the conservatory closed.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: The only thing that I recall distinctly -- and it didn\u2019t touch me personally, but in fact\nthe director of the school of music, Dr. Kyper -- in fact, the summer of graduation, I\nreturned to Champagne to retrieve a couple of personal belongings, and on the return -\n- he was there, it was July, so I was -- it was a little strange to see Dr. Kyper in the\ntrain. We sat together in the observation lounge, and he proceeded ga -- I -- I could see\nthat he was very troubled, and I felt both honored, and in the same time, it\u2019s a bit\nuncomfortable, because Dr. Kyper unloaded, or -- or told me, or related to me, the\nreason he has come back. And this it was simply that because of the McCarthy era,\nperhaps he had connections with leftist groups in the United States, I don\u2019t know. But\nessentially he had been sort of recalled from vacation by the president of the\nuniversity, and told that there were such suspicions, or accusations, whatever. The\n[indecipherable] fact was that he was dismissed from the di -- the directorship of the\nschool of music, but remained as a professor. And he was a -- a -- a first kind of\npersonal contact with a political atmosphere at that time. This is the main thing. I\nmean, after I went in the army and so forth, well then I -- I was always politically\ninterested, I -- because I remember, my first recollections as a -- as a boy, because my\n-- both my parents were extremely interested 1n political things and we used to discuss\nit, but my first political awareness was the Spanish civil war.",
        "A: Sure, sure. Well, not only the Holocaust, but -- but even the [indecipherable] all of\nthese things, and the reading, and all the thinking, and it was a kind of a strange thing\nto be living those days in the United States, who -- f-for us in the liberation -- the\nUnited States and it\u2019s history was something so unique, so superior to anything else,\nthat at the beginning, you know, I found it really hard to reconcile how in the same\nplace that -- that -- where there was so much freedom of expression, everything else,\nthere was also something like this. Except that a little bit of understanding of what had\nhappened in the 30\u2019s in central Europe, in Germany, then s -- I began to -- to realize\nthat there wa -- there was no monopoly, and it could happen anywhere, and it had\nbegun to even infest the United States.",
        "A: Sure, of course, of course.",
        "A: All right. All right. Well, we go back, remember I was divorced 1n 57, and -- and\nagain, this is another period that harks back when you were asking me, when I first\ncame to the United States, did I feel lonely, or -- or nostalgic, which I hadn\u2019t, but again\nin this stressful period, I had lots of friends, but really not relatives near me, that is to\nsay people who, regardless of what you do, will always be on your side. So I had\nnowhere to turn, and I -- I had to -- to cope with the situation. In any case, the\nfollowing summer, and coincidentally because Sam was getting married, then I\ndecided that I needed a -- a change of scene. In fact at one point I -- I thought that\nperhaps I would go and -- and -- and live in Europe. And in fact I went to Paris first.\nAnd I had been given names of a number of companies, including IBM, and believe\nme, it took just one interview to completely settle the issue for me, that the only place\nfor me was the United States. So I then enjoyed my -- my vacation, and I didn\u2019t think\nof ever st-staying in Europe.",
        "A: All right. The stresses were strictly personal, the personal stresses of the divorce, of\n-- of -- of all it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a-aftermath, and then finding myself alone, and -- and a little\nbit lost, and -- and wounded, the way that things had -- had happened. And I -- I\nimagine it\u2019s either romantic or -- or -- or -- or whatever you want to call it, to s -- to --\nto -- to s -- really think that a change of scenery is what you need. So that\u2019s why then I\nsaid, \u201cOh, well, all right, let me look into the possibility of working overseas. So I\ncontacted a number of people. When I went to 1 -- to IBM offices, well they said,\n\u201cYeah, but you see we cannot hire you here, as an American, because that has all kinds\nof other ramifications. We have to pay you extra salary, allow you return every year\nfor vacation, and so forth and so on. So that\u2019s a totally different kettle of fish, you\ngotta be hired by IBM there and sent to Paris. But if to hire you here, you have to be\nhired as a local.\u201d And that meant a totally different situation. The moment I heard that,\n[ -- | -- I realized 1-it wasn\u2019t going to be for me and I\u2019m glad it -- that 1t occurred very\nquickly, because then I could enjoy the remaining two months. Because I went to\nSpain first, went to Greece for Sam\u2019s wedding. This is where I met Paulette, I mean\nthe first time. I mean she was in the receiving line. Then two days later, I got a call\nfrom her sister, whom I knew vaguely. I had met her vaguely. Her sister was having a\nfew people for dinner, would I like to come? Sure. So I\u2019m walking, and -- and I\u2019m\nreaching the -- the -- the block where her sister lived, and at the door is a young lady.\nWell, we\u2019re both waiting for the door to open, we go, we get into the elevator, and we\nboth realized that we stopped in the same door, and we ring the bell, and of course, it\nopens up, Yola, her sister, opened the door. They embraced. I thought there was -- she\nwas just another invitee, I had no idea of the relationship. And like an idiot, it was\nduring, really, dinner when a conversation is going between them like Yola is asking\nPaulette, how are the folks? I mean the parents. Fine. And then I said, naively, \u201cAre\nyou related?\u201d They said, \u201cWe are sisters.\u201d Well, so that was our first meeting. Then the\nfollowing day, or I di -- two days later, I forget, she called, and now she tells me that\nthis was a daring thing on her part, to tell me that she had tickets to a concert with\nIsaac Stern, would I like to go? I said, \u201cOf course.\u201d I had dinner with Isaac Stern\nduring my years -- in fact, we went to the concert and after the concert I went\nbackstage, and we had a little reunion with Stern. He remembered me because we had\ndinner together with his accompanist Zagin. And so we started going together, and\nwithin about a week, I proposed to her.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, no, no, let me -- her maiden name is Moudzoukos. Her family hail from a city\ncalled Volos, which although is in Thessaly, it\u2019s at least 200 miles from the area where\nI was. Volos is on the eastern part of Greece, and it\u2019s a port, because it\u2019s on the\nAegean Sea. Her family were prominent. Her father and -- and his brother, and the\nfamily had a large factory, textile manufacturers. In fact, I remember when I used to\ngo, at times, to my father\u2019s office some summers to help -- to b -- so to pass the time,\nand I remember photographs of the Moudzoukos factory, I can still see it\u2019s outlines.\nThe name was very familiar. In any case -- and they also, from Volos, they were\nRomaniots, also, they were not Sephardim in -- in the sense that we -- I explained\nearlier. She has a sister who\u2019s still alive, and in -- older, Yola, lives in Athens. She has\na son, and he\u2019s married, has a son, and expecting another one. I met her -- I mean, we\nwere engaged, then -- then a-arrangements were made for Paulette to join me, because\nshe couldn\u2019t come to United States. We had to be married outside of the United States,\nand then I would then invite her to come as an American citizen. But we had to be\nmarried outside of the continental United States. She stayed with friends in Montreal\nfor about two or three months. I would go from time to time to be with her, and also\nbecause my divorce was in Mexico, and it was not recognized in Quebec, in the\nprovince, because they only recognize religious marriages, and religious annulments or\ndivorces, we were married in Toronto. We knew no one. We went to the registry, and\nthey said, \u201cDo you ha -- do you have any witnesses?\u201d As it happened, there were\nanother couple behind us, also strangers in Toronto, and we became each other wis --\neach other\u2019s witnesses, and that\u2019s -- we were married then in -- in -- in June of \u201958.",
        "A: Well, I was 32.",
        "A: Right. And she came about two months later.",
        "A: I think it just happened, but really in -- in -- in -- in my own personal case, you --\nyou have t -- to also take into account that even at the time I went in Greece, I was still\nliving possibly in the tail end, fortunately, of my experience, the first marriage, which\nhad ended so -- so badly. Really, I think that -- 1t\u2019s one of the questions that I think I\nsaw in your notes, about religion. There 1s a woman named Jane Gerber, you know her\nwork. | -- I -- she invited me to give lectures in -- in Baltimore in July, which I will do.\nBut I just heard a lecture of hers because of the -- of a thing in the National Cathedral\nwhere they have some artifacts that came from Spain that -- of the Sephardim Jews\nthere. Wonderful lecture she gave. And a magnificent phrase of hers, I think it was in\nresponse to a question, and -- and her phrase was, the relative relaxed attitude of the\nSephardim towards religion. And this is as best I can also describe both my religious\nupbringing, which was not very strict. I mean, we were observant of all the major\nholiday -- Jewish holidays. Dietary laws are really almost impossible to apply in\nAthens, because there were 3000 Jews in a city of a million. There -- y-y -- there\nwasn\u2019t a place to -- to go buy kosher meat and things like this. But in the high\nholidays, then special arrangements were made for s -- special slaughterers to come,\nand to provide. So there were no -- there was -- when I -- there were never crustaceans\nin our house, or things like that. But the observances there, we were -- my job for\nexample, every Friday from the age of five or six, because the synagogue was only\nabout a block away from my house, was to carry the oil donation to the synagogue,\nbecause the Sephardim didn\u2019t burn candles. All the -- the lights were olive oil with\nwicks in there. And go to the synagogue on Sabbath, and of course, all the major\nholidays. And the -- the -- the prepara --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Continue in that vein, so -- from a totally different thing, there is a -- a Greek\nsaying that it\u2019s better to -- to wear old shoes from your country, even if they are --\nhave been repaired. But again, I didn\u2019t got there to -- to -- to find a -- a wife, it just -- it\njust happened.",
        "A: And, of course I\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m glad that there was some commonality, first in\nanother language, to some shared experience. Paulette was too young, she was -- she\nwas only 33, and at the time of the hiding, she was barely nine or 10 years old. So she\ndoesn\u2019t have as vivid memories of -- I mean, she has vivid memories of the hiding, but\nI mean nothing compared to going to the mountains. And also, very fortunately, none\nof her relatives perished in -- in the Holocaust.",
        "A: One of her uncles also happened to be a Spanish citizen. He was taken to camp, but\nhe survived.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, oh yes. Not only that, but she was able a few years ago, I think four\nor five years ago, to re-establish contact with the daughters of the family that hid them.\nAnd in fact one of them was visiting a sister in the United States, and then came and\nstayed with us for -- for a week. So she has maintained this thing, and she has\nextremely strong recollections, because also, there -- there came a time when in maybe\nnot the first, but the second house where they were hiding, somebody already told\nthem, there\u2019re already suspicions that you me -- may be Jews, and that was a signal to\n-- for them to immediately leave and go someplace else.",
        "A: See, she remembers all of that.",
        "A: All right. Well, we have three daughters. Sarah was born in New Jersey, because at\nthat time I was working at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, and when Sarah was a\nyear old, that\u2019s when I left, or we left, and we went to California, because of my\nengagement at the Rand Corporation. Then when we return, Maya, the second one,\nwas born in \u201963, three years after Sarah. And in \u201966, Nicole was born, and she was\nborn here. I think Is -- a little bit helped deliver her a little bit, because it occurred\nvery, very fast. It was a Saturday morning, and Paulette said that the time had come.\nWe notified the doctor, he said, \u201cAll ri -- okay, I\u2019Il meet you down -- down there.\u201d I\nwas going to drive her, initially. But I had made arrangements with neighbors to take\ncare of the two other children, but the pains are coming very, very fast. And so I call\nthe ambulance, but even then, she says, \u201cThe baby\u2019s coming out.\u201d And she lied on the\nbed, in fact I can see the head coming out. And out of the window I see our neighbor, a\npsychiatrist who is walking his dog, so I ran out, and -- and -- and I told him that --\nthat Paulette is having a baby, he dro-dropped the dog, and he came and deliver the\nbaby. We wrapped it in a -- in a blanket. He asked from something to cut the umbilical\ncord, and I go -- I got it, and brought the -- the poultry shears from the -- from the\nkitchen. And when we -- we were there, I mean Paulette, as if nothing had happened,\nher cheeks were a rosy color. I was -- I bel next in pallor holding the baby in this --\nthis dirty towel that we had wrapped it around. But the palest of all was Dr. Hoffman,\nbecause he hadn\u2019t done anything like this since --",
        "A: Medical school, yeah that\u2019s right.",
        "A: Sarah, the eldest, Maya, and Nicole is the -- the -- the -- the youngest.",
        "A: Delivered at home. She is an attorney, Nicole, in Chicago. She has three sons now.\nAnd Maya has two sons. So we have, of the three daughters, five grandsons.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: For a long time, and now I -- I -- I must say that I was really hoping for a -- a\ngranddaughter. But it\u2019s ma -- fine.",
        "A: Right, yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, the -- we -- I -- look, 1 -- living in aside what I referred to earlier, Gerber\u2019s\nphrase of the relaxed atmosphere, but I mean both at university, and -- and -- and when\nI began to mature a little bit more, I am not religious. But some of the things we\nretained which were dear to me, primarily because it brought memories of the family\nand it\u2019s tradition. So we always had the lighting of candles in Hanukkah, and the high\nholidays we -- we used to go to the synagogue. But I did not insist on their going to\nSunday school, or -- or -- or this or the other. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s turned out that of the three,\nentirely spontaneously, Nicole is the one who is super Jewish than all the other -- all --\nall the -- the daughters. I think really if I think now in retrospect, I think the division of\nlabor in the upbringing was -- Paulette was much more -- her family more structured\nfrom a social standpoint. I mean, in my house, for instance, we never celebrated\nbirthdays. It was unknown. I don\u2019t even know my father\u2019s birthday, my mother\u2019s\nbirthday. The only reason I know my birthday, and my brother\u2019s is because I -- we\nhave records from -- birth certificates. But in those days, they did -- they did -- but so\nfrom the social upbringing, this was sort of Paulette\u2019s area. In my case, I think that I co\n-- I continue to try to inculcate the same things that I received from my parents, you\nknow, the tremendous reverence for -- for education and -- and -- and learning. Plus I\nthink something else, one other thing, it was -- this -- how can I phrase it? The -- the --\nthe a -- assuming of personal responsibility. I remember that in the case of all three\ngirls, when they were ready to now leave home and go to school -- to university, Maya\n-- Sarah going to Boston, Maya in Michigan, and Nicole in Wisconsin, I took them all\nfor a -- a long ride and lunch. And first of all, I told them about the fact that I had been\nmarried once before. And a -- a typically -- although they didn\u2019t tell each other,\nbecause I asked them not to, they all -- always asked the same question, what was her\nname? And did by any chance have a sibling that they didn\u2019t know? [indecipherable]\nnot -- no -- no such thing. And then I told them that as they are ready now to go and --\nand live their own lives, I told them that a part of the Hippocratic oath a doctors take,\none part which I -- I -- I think it\u2019s very important, is above all do no harm.",
        "A: So Is -- I used to say to them, \u201cLook, you may encounter all kinds of situations, all\nkinds of people. If you are asked to try something, whether it\u2019s drugs, or si -- do the\nfollowing. If you have any doubt about the possibility of doing harm, then don\u2019t. But\nwhatever it 1s that you do, take personal responsibility for that. Now, it will always be\na -- a-- I mean, we will always be with you, no matter what happens,\u201d but I tried in a\nnumber of little things that they used to do when -- when they were growing up. For\ninstance, how they would divide a labor, chores, how they would do. It was always\nthis aspect that -- and -- and although this got formalized really, after the war in\nFrance, with existentialism, and when it was finally given a kind of official thing, that\nnamely life is nothing but a -- a set of choices, and even not doing something 1s itself a\nchoice. But even before I had read Sartre, and -- and -- and -- and the periodicals that I\nused to get from my cousin, from Paris [indecipherable] moderne, I always felt, and I\nthink primarily the war years, because when I got to the mountains, then I knew that is\n-- is nothing -- I had no place else to go f -- to assume responsibility for whatever I did.\nSo that became something that\u2019s -- I sort of learned on the job, as it were, in the\nmountains. And I thought that 1t would be a very important and useful thing to -- to tell\nthem.",
        "A: Probably. Yes, probably, right.",
        "A: [indecipherable] the ethical portion of the --",
        "A: -- of the faith, yes. You know, it\u2019s -- what I would say, either by recounting\npersonal examples or events in my life, the -- they were not meant really to be mini\nlessons in ethics, but simply that -- that I -- I trusted them enough -- I had differences\nwith Paulette, really sometimes really severe ones. Paulette would sometimes accuse\nme that I was too easy, that I -- she -- she -- she believed, and she still does that Sarah\nexperimented with pot when she was in high school. I tried to tell her that -- that all I\ntried to do, and all I think a -- a parent can do, is to make sure that the core of the\nperson is solid. Since I could not be on top of them in every place they went, I could\nonly concentrated in one pronouncement, do whatever you want, but be responsible for\nit. Fortunately they have all turn out to be magnificent persons.",
        "A: Very different in many, many respects, but all of them quite good --",
        "A: -- and solid.",
        "A: Well -- well, it may be, but I think that it again depended on individual households.\nWhat I can say that comes a little close to -- to -- to what you\u2019re alluding to, was my\nmother telling me about some -- for example, because her maiden name was\nColonomos, which, as you probably know -- who knows if there is any connection, but\none of the most famous rabbis of all time, not s-so much Sephardim, a [indecipherable]\nAshkenazis Germany was a Colonomos. And as you know the name means -- it has\nsome variance. The -- the basic variant is Colonimos, which in Greek means, of good\nname. And it\u2019s Hebrew equivalent is yom -- what\u2019s the name? Not -- yom -- yom --\nYomkesh. So, th-there -- people who are called like that. Now, why was she doing\nthat? Apparently there must have been a kind of tradition that was primarily oral --\nagain, through the ballads, and through the songs, that hark back to Spain. After all, of\nthe five synagogues, major synagogues in Monasteer, before the catastrophe, one was\nKal Aragon, the synagogue of -- from Aragon, the other was Kal Portugas. So there\nwas really in -- in the stories that they would say, and even sometimes I -- you know, I\n-- yo-you -- if I chance to read a -- a play of Calderone\u2019s, and you see phrases which\nare not longer existing in -- in modern Spanish, and I can hear my grandmother\npronounce it. Some of that was there, but 1t was not something that was cultivated so\nmuch, except simply in the oral tradition about how things were at home, how they\ndressed for holidays, how they ate. So I don\u2019t know if it 1s really what you -- you refer\nto as psyche. In Salonika, because of a stronger movement, and the fact that -- that --\nthat there was a lot more contact with other countries because of commerce, and in\ninismeer in Istanbul, there was much more of an intellectual fermented than there was\nin the monastileese. There is a mystique about monastileese that to this day I don\u2019t\nknow why it\u2019s there. In fact, a week or so ago, we went to an annual meeting on\nmonastileese, which is a group of 60 people in -- in -- in -- in New York, that it\u2019s a\nbureel society, they simply are descendants of a first congregation of monastileese\never established in New York. It doesn\u2019t exist any more. It\u2019s called the Congregation\nof Peace and Brotherhood. But they continue --",
        "A: Yeah, so there is, yeah, there is -- 1f you could see, I mean you go on the web, and\nyou -- Monasteer, when it comes -- [indecipherable] has his own website, the\nSephardic four, full of things again about -- Sephardic things, dishes, cooking,\ntraditions, names. I mean, you -- names which were strange names sometimes, very\nSpanish in many cases. Then strange mixes of Hebrew names, women, Soonho, which\nin Hebrew is Allegra. And then you see from -- from generation to generation how\nthings we [indecipherable] change. My mater -- paternal grandmother\u2019s name was\nEstraya -- Star, all right? But as is traditional in Jewish fa -- Sephardic families, the\neldest daughter, firstborn on the paternal side -- I mean born, takes the name of the\npaternal mother. And the boy -- that\u2019s why I\u2019m named after my grandfather. And --\nand -- an-and -- now that\u2019s -- [indecipherable] it was through the work that I\u2019d done\nfor the museum that I -- and some other things, that I found that my great-great\ngrandfather, Solomon, was one of the 13 signatories in Monasteer in 1864 for the\nbringing of the alliance fran\u00a2aise in Monasteer.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Let me tell you what I regret, however. That there 1s practically no information\nabout my mother\u2019s side. I have a cousin, first cousin, Miriam, who lives 1n -- in Israel,\nshe -- her -- her -- her mother and my mother were sisters, and she has done a lot of\nresearch on the Colonomus family. I finally have decided that it\u2019s about time I asked\nMiriam to make as much of the connection -- the only thing I know about my mother\nwas because she was an extremely bright student, and she went to a French school, and\nin that meeting just last weekend, I found another woman, whose mother, although in\nSalonika, also went to an alliance francais school, and she also was very bright. Both\nof them were slated to be sent to Paris for further training, but unfortunately the war\nintervened. That\u2019s -- stopped it. But I remember even when I first came to the United\nStates, landed in New York, and saw my aunt, and I met another friend of hers, not a\nrelative now, but also from Monasteer, and she says, \u201cI remember your mother, she\nwas so clever.\u201d",
        "A: That\u2019s a -- that\u2019s putting it very mildly, very mildly.",
        "A: Yes, she was a very driven person, right.",
        "A: Well yes, first th -- I mentioned earlier about the obligation to speak French at\nhome. Very frequently she would ask me to all -- give me assignments to read, books,\nFrench books. In the beginning children\u2019s stories, later on even plays of Racine. And I\nstill remember she\u2019s in the kitchen, maybe cooking something, and I would then read\npassages, or from some of -- of these plays. Now some of them, and I still remember,\nincluded situations which really -- now, they were not erotic, but for instance I still\nremember -- although I knew the -- the word -- 1t comes from when it was -- it says --\nhe says elaparlay arsematress. Well, she did not comment. Normally she would have\nexpected me to ask, \u201cWell, that does matress mean?\u201d You know, because matress has\nat least two meanings in French. One is a teacher, you know, or mistress, but mistress\nin the sense of hierarchy, and the other 1s the -- the lover connotation. So she was an\navid reader herself, 1n the little time that she had available running the house, although\n-- though we had a maid. And she read history, and she -- 1-it was a -- ak -- a kind of a\n-- of a situation where she -- she demanded, you know, excellence, and it was at times\nsometimes hard to know what her expectations were. My father on the other hand was\na lot more encouraging. He had ways of recompense. One of my earliest memories that\nI have to tell you, I was I think possibly barely -- four -- four and a half, and I had\nwritten from an assignment, you know, half a page. And I showed it to him, and he\nwas incredulous, he says, \u201cYou wrote that?\u201d I said, \u201cYes.\u201d I almost saw a -- a -- a look\nof disbelief, and he says, \u201cHere, here, takes -- take another piece of paper.\u201d He sat\ndown and he dictated a brand new passage from another book for me, and had me\nwrite it. So I finish that, he looked at it, he says, \u201cWhat a magnificent handwriting. All\nright, put your things together, we\u2019re going to go now to the patisserie, and have a\npiece of cake.\u201d So he had this nice thing about, you know, rewards. Wa -- my mother\nwas not really that free with -- with praise. She was always a lot more demanding.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something, you know, if -- I know even from my own\nexperience with children, that by the time Maya was born, the second, one mellows,\nand -- and it becomes a different -- because obviously the first child has taught you\nhow to become a parent. And I think that probably from either a character or\npersonality strai -- trait, \u2019'm probably very much like my mother. I too, perfectionist,\ndemanding. Really I -- I cringe sometimes at being praised. I don\u2019t know why. Which I\nknow 1s a terrible defect, because it\u2019s almost the obverse side of the coin of claming\ntoo much. If you always reject praise as -- as if -- you know, you\u2019re asking for people\nto -- to continue doing that. So, you know, there were -- there -- there were -- there\nwere tensions at times, and she was, you know, quite severe with me. And it isn\u2019t that\nshe neglected the other two, but I think, again, 1t was a question of mellowing, and --\nand not asking as much from them as I did -- she did with me. But on the other hand,\nespecially in the mountains, when I began to reflect about the tensions, and her\ndemands, and things like this. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s then that I began to realize how much what\nwas, I thought, unfair, then was responsible for getting a certain amount of self\ndiscipline, and which in the beginning is a chore, then eventually becomes something\nthat you like, namely to go and find out things. And -- and the joy of discovering\ncoutch sa -- doesn\u2019t happen if you don\u2019t -- 1f you don\u2019t try. And -- and you know that\nthere are people I -- I know my youngest daughter began -- she had a -- she has perfect\npitch, and began to even play tunes in piano when she was barely two, two and a half\nyears old. And -- and later on -- I tell her sometimes, and she -- she rightly says it isn\u2019t\n-- wasn\u2019t laziness, she had other things to interest her. So she didn\u2019t pursue piano the\nway, you know, I thought that she -- she would from -- from that kind of promise in\nthe beginning. So similarly, what originally was a -- a compulsion, then I began to\nappreciate, and how much I owe her for what she eventually was able -- able to give\nme.",

And because a-again, see, the 40\u2019s was s-so different, and by the time that I\nthink Sam also came of age to really start to doing more serious studies, going into the\ngimnasium, the high school, the war had intervened, and -- and that changed things\nconsiderably.

        "A: Right. Well, again, you know, it\u2019s amazing how inconsequential events remain. I ha\n-- was about six or seven years old, or maybe eight, and I had become a boy scout, or -\n- or a cub scout, whatever it is. And part of -- of the thing was to get a uniform, but\nalso a staff. You know, the kind of a thing that you have to then use when you climb\nmountains and so on. Well, when the time came for me to -- to -- to get the staff, you d\n-- you couldn\u2019t go to a store and buy it, but next door, or two doors down from my\nhouse was a -- a lumberyard. I -- I went and -- and -- and bought a -- a long, square\npole, but now it has to be made into a cylinder. Well, it happened then again that\nanother two doors down was, in the basement, a -- a -- a man who used to make chairs,\nand he had a wooden lathe what he would turn, as the phrase goes, you know, the --\nthe -- the legs. And so I t -- I brought the -- that square piece of wood, and he made me\nwait, and was sit down, and he put it on the lathe. And then he began to explain to me\nwhile he\u2019s turning the wood, how this essentially amorphous piece of wood, just a\nsquare, long, piece of wood, with his cutter, he would be able to transform it and give\nit shape. So it -- it was like seeing something be revealed under the hands of a -- of a\ncraftsman in front of my eyes. So then the idea of making things with the hands, is a\ncompliment to the -- the other side of pleasure and discovery, which in -- in -- in\nmathematics does not require proo -- evidence to the physical world. If you solve a\nproposition in mathematics, you know when you\u2019ve solved it. You don\u2019t need\nsomebody to come and say yes, that\u2019s right, you know it. Unlike physics, or -- or\nscience where you may have an idea but then it needs to be corroborated by physical\nobservation, experiment. Which 1s then half wasted because it requires both intellect\nand observation, to then making things, which is entirely by hands, although it requires\nalso some training, which obviously involves the brain. So I -- from those early things\nthen, I wanted to build things. And so when we went to California for the first time, I\nbought a saw, a table saw, and drills, and began to work with wood because I\nremember how this craftsman was able to transform -- which is almost the equivalent\nof the Michelangelo statement that he does not make statues, he just removes the\namount of marble, and just reveals what\u2019s already there.",
        "A: All right, so -- so -- so -- wha -- you asked me what I like to do for pleasure, and\npart of it was, when I was at Bell Laboratories for example, then I belonged to a\nBridge playing club, and 1 -- some of us at lunch hour, instead of going to the cafeteria\nto have lunch, would have a sandwich, take it with us, and go to the recreation room,\nand -- and play Bridge until the -- and so very quickly, and especially in Bridge as well\nas in chess, you have to have good tutors, especially wish have -- to have very good\npartners. I was able to gain 1800 master points, because we were starting to -- playing\nin tournaments. At the Rand Corporation, I got involved -- a very favory game, 1s -- it\nwas -- it\u2019s called Krikspiel, which is the German for war game, Krikspiel. This is a -- a\n-- a game with the following. It\u2019s essentially chess, and instead of a single board, there\nare two boards, with a wall in between the two players. So both boards are set\nindependently, and each player does not see what the other\u2019s board contains. And the\nmoves start. There is an observer, who sees both boards, and whose role 1s only to say\nwhether a move that you may attempt is permissible or not. Permissible in the sense if\nthere\u2019s an opponent piece, you cannot move, let\u2019s say, a square ahead, all right? And\nhis other role is to say whether you have captured a piece. That\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s\npermitted to say. And the whole notion is that you fight a war when you really don\u2019t\nknow the deployment of the opponent forces. Now, as you proceed with the game, and\npieces start getting a -- to be eliminated through capture, and the -- the board thins out,\nyou begin to have a pretty good idea what it 1s. So these are the things which are\nintellectual games that -- that -- that attracted me. But inc -- we moved to California, I\nbought a saw, and I started make -- making things. Making things out of wood, then\nwhen we came here I made the table which I showed you upstairs. I made some other\npieces. But now I don\u2019t do these things any more, now it -- it\u2019s -- a new toy has come\ninto my life, and that\u2019s th-the -- the computer, and making web sites, and things like\nthis. The other passion is music. I\u2019m a -- a musician monqu\u00e9 as they say in French. If I\nhad another life, this 1s what I would have liked to do.",

All right. First of all, I was asked by my former boss to consult\nfor another year for the company, because there was still a piece of work that I had\nstarted, that was unfinished, and he was not planning to replace my position. So I did\nthat for a year. Then, coincidentally a friend of mine, a Greek who was working for the\nEuropean community, asked me and told me that they needed consultants for work\nwhich was being funded by the European community, but which dealt with\ntelecommunications, and it\u2019s future in Greece. I mean the telecommunication system.\nSo for four years, I traveled. I was practically on the plane every other month, through\nEurope, throughout Europe. I -- \u2019'm no -- I\u2019m talking about the east, but primarily the\nwestern part of Europe, and Greece, doing this consulting work. Then a year after that,\na big project that I started had come to a reasonable stopping point, and we had had the\nIrish telecommunications company, that which led me to go to Ireland a number of\ntimes, which I -- both Paulette and I love. Then we went to Israel. I have lots of\nrelatives there, who had migrated -- some of them migrated in the early 30\u2019s from\nSalonika to Israel. So there\u2019s a -- a lot of progeny that\u2019s -- that\u2019s now in -- in the tents.\nPlus also some cousins, among them Miriam, her last name is Kalahora, who was one\nof about an estimated 1500 Jews who were able to escape from Greece via boat to\nTurkey, and then go from Turkey, through Syria, and Lebanon, eventually to Palestine.\nNow some of them, and her sister, either -- I mean, drowned, that\u2019s for sure. What 1s\nnot known is whether they were drowned by the boatman to take their money and --\nand essentially kill them. Some of them were captured by the Germans, by some patrol\nboats. Some were also denounced. But one of them made it. But 1500 made it to -- to\nTurkey, to Palestine.",
        "A: All right, well, first of all, I -- I -- I think I\u2019m -- I -- I read avidly about current\naffairs, both in the press, and -- and in -- in magazines.

        "A: Golda Maier, who at one point was asked about the Palestinians and says, \u201c\u201cWho are\nthey?\u201d And I really have not been able to understand the -- the mentality of some\npeople, both in Israel, and I think sometimes more of it among some of the leadership\nof the Jewish community in the United States to -- to almost ignore the existence of --\nof a group of people, namely the Palestinians.

        "A: All right. Well, the -- my things with the Holocaust Museum took really -- it took\nplace in two different times, and for two different reasons, and two different periods.\nOne was about five or eight years ago, when I was even trying to ascertain the date of\nmy mother\u2019s death. Now, I would ask Sam, when did you get to Auschwitz? Well, of\ncourse, I mean, I think it was -- you know, either -- either between the 17\", and the\n20\" of August. All right. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI need to find out.\u201d Well, I went, and I started\nlooking at the archives, and I found what\u2019s called -- I think I v -- we would -- we\ntalked about that --",
        "A: Yes. The Danuta Chronicles, which were the -- a kind of -- of almost diary\nofficially that it was kept by a Czech inmate called Danuta --",
        "A: -- and eventually it was published, and they are known as the Danuta Chronicles.\nWell, you look at entries day by day as they -- they are there. Sometimes they are from\nthe sublime or the horrible, to the terribly mundane. For instance, okay, today 15,000\narrived and were taken to the crematoria. And then this individual was punished with\n10 lashes because he stole a piece of bread. I mean, these are the kinds of extremes of\nentries. Well, all right. Since I knew the approximate period, then I find an entry for 16\nAugust of \u201944, where he says, \u201c1600 or 2000 Rhodesian Jews come.\u201d Then he says\nhow -- so many males, so many females. Not of the total, but so many females were\ngiven numbers, and he has the range of the numbers, and the females were given the\nfollowing numbers. And I knew from Sam\u2019s number on his arm fits exactly in the\nrange that he\u2019s -- he cited there. So I know now that the date of the arrival, and when I\nasked Sam at what time of the day they arrived, he said, \u201cVery early, dawn.\u201d And that\nmakes me conclude that either they -- they were executed or -- or gassed the same day,\nbecause they didn\u2019t keep them around, or at the latest, the following day. So that was\nthe first thing. So I -- I did a little bit more of this personal kind of a thing. What drove\nme then to the later engagement, which would -- then became intense, was a similar\nthing. I always -- I -- although I knew the fate of my relatives in Macedonia, in mon --\nin Monasteer, but especially in s -- in s -- the Serbian Jews, in Serbia, very few ever\nreached the concentration camps. And now not that much had been written, so I was\nbeginning to get really curious, so I began to -- to read some sources. Now I know the\nGermans shot most of the Serbian Jews and buried them, or used mobile gas vans. It\nwas before the killing factories began to operate. Well, then I found in a book that the\nBulgarians who occupied Macedonia and Phrase, among other things, and -- and this\nbook which is called, \u201cA Town called Monasteer,\u201d makes the following assertion. That\nin the archives of Yad Vashem, there is a unique -- a -- 0 -- a -- an item unique to the\nHolocaust. But emphatically Pve concluded there is nothing unique about the\nHolocaust, everything is unique about the Holocaust. And so I contacted Yad Vashem,\neventually I got the microfilm, it came. But then, while I\u2019m waiting for that, I thought I\nwould to go the archives, and I asked Sharon there innocently, do you have anything\nfrom Monasteer? Yes, we have 1400 photographs. Well, here is two huge books, but\nyou couldn\u2019t -- th-they were just only photographs with numbers, no identification.\nBut together there was two rolls of 35 millimeter microfilm, so you take the books to\nthe library, put the -- thread the thing in the reader, and every frame has the same\nnumber as the photograph, and written in handwritten Cyrillic was the identity and\naddress of these persons. Well, very quickly, the first day, I advance the microfilm to\nmy relatives. Now though, since it\u2019s Cyrillic the first letter is k, then comes n, and at\nthe end is f. There\u2019s Colonomos from my mother\u2019s brother, I found my aunt. My uncle\nSalamone Hamma, my father\u2019s brother, and my father\u2019s sister, Oro, who had married a\nman named Franco. Well, I took copies of it, I -- I came home. I was a bit moved by\nthis discovery. Okay, marvelous things over the weekend, and then the following\nMonday I called the archives, and it was Sharon, she says, \u201cWell, Mr. Nehama, you\nknow, we wanted to call you, but I was hesitating, and,\u201d -- I said, \u201cLook, let me tell\nyou why I\u2019m calling. Since I was able to read about my [indecipherable] perhaps\nmaybe I can help.\u201d She said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we were going to ask you too, if you would\nbe willing to.\u201d And that\u2019s what got me started, and -- and that -- that initial piece of\nwork took almost a year, because now, for the first six months, I would go the museum\ncarrying my portable computer, and get the books, get the microfilm, sit in front of a\nreader, and as I read -- and some of these things are sometimes unreadable, I would\nthen transfer them to the computer. Then one day it dawned on me that instead of\ntrudging and getting all these things to the museum, maybe I would rent a microfilm\nreader, and bring it here to my house, and I don\u2019t have to -- to travel. But immediately\nthen I thought, there is a button on the microfilm reader, and if you press it, 1t gives\nyou a copy out of the printer. Well, that means that the stupid thing goes out digitally\nso that the printer can print it. If it goes out to the printer, it can sure go to a CD. So I\ntook the -- the microfilm, and I paid a co -- a company, and they transferred onto -- on\none -- on a CD, so I did the remaining other four or five months at home. Then after\nthat was finished, the -- the archives, the photo archives, I did the same thing with the\nYad Vashem register, which is even more difficult, because, you know, even if you\nmagnify, it begins to get distorted, but I can show you later, you can even see that\ndifferent clerks were writing, because you can see that the handwriting is changing\nover time. And it -- it was a-another almost eight or nine months of very eye breaking\ne-e-effort to -- to do the Yad Vashem thing. But it was --",
        "A: Very rewarding.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, let me give you an example, all right? A few years ago, the -- after my first\ngrandson was -- was born, Ian, then I said, all right, there will come a time where, like\neveryone will -- will ask, wh-what is relativity about? So -- so I put together a little\nhandmade illustration like a film, that explains, I thought -- explains relativity --\nspecial relativity, not general relativity to a child. The truth is that it requires a little bit\nmore sophistication, although children grasp things much more quickly, because they\ndon\u2019t carry terrible baggage that they have to discard first. But there are certain aspects\nof special relativity that one has to be able to at least make a leap of [indecipherable]\nbecause one thing to which special relativity is key, namely the velocity of light, we\ncannot experience it. You can only think about it, and the -- in fact there have been\nbooks that tell you, supposing the velocity of light was not what it is. Suppose it was\non -- an every day kind of speed, like you drive you car -- say speed of light was 30\nmiles per hour. What would happen? You -- you go out in the street, and -- and you\nsee a person in a bicycle, and as he moves, you would see him squashed, because it\u2019s\none of the lengths in -- in -- in a -- in a direction of travel shrink because that\u2019s one of\nthe aspects of -- of special relativity. But because you can\u2019t make -- you know, but --\nso you have to be able to imagine this thing, and then -- but I made this film, so I\u2019m\nwaiting for a time when my grandsons would begin to ask questions about the\nrelativity, or about mathematics, and either I will make films for them, or -- or tell\nthem, or tell them other stories. Because I remember from childhood I would be\nfascinated I had certain heroes. Ulysses was one of them, or Odysseus. Or -- or\nHercules, or Eracles. Then later on, in the be -- when I started -- another hero was\nAlexander the Great. Now in subsequent reading now, I have concluded he was a thug\nin many respects.

And you know,\nalthough most people now conclude that he committed suicide, rather than dying\nbecause of an accident falling down -- downstairs, I have not ever found it ne --\nessential, or at least that I could even remotely hypothesize that this particular personal\nproblem is tied -- and as far as looking for help, maybe it could be resolved, but it\nwould not be cause of that, not because of the Holocaust.",
        "A: I think -- when we were talking, and you were asking me about the recent work that\nI had done, which I call the trassiteration and translation project with the archives of\nthe -- in the Holocaust Museum, it was --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: You don\u2019t --",
        "A: You need -- you need a [indecipherable]",
        "A: We were talking about one aspect -- not that one aspect, but I think you used the\nword, and I almost at the same time, that the work that I was doing was very\nrewarding, and I-I -- I think it\u2019s very rewarding. But there were also some byproducts,\nif I can call them, which really would last a lot longer, because in the process I came\ninto contact with individuals of similar interests. There\u2019s a matter of me corresponding\nwith -- his name 1s Moses Hasson, he lives in Santiago, Chile, because the people from\nMonasteer were early settlers in 1916 in a small town called Temooko, in the lake\ndistrict in Chile. And -- and was one of the oldest Sephardic as well as monastilee\ncommunities in South America. Then I -- I met -- and I have not met yet in person, a\nman who wrote a book about Monasteer, his name is Mark Cohen, he lives in San\nFrancisco area. And it was through Mark\u2019s researchers that I found, and I fe -- I have\ncopies now of reasons the s -- s -- the declaration of 16 prominent Mo-Monasteer\nJews, among them my great-grandfather Solomon, to establish the alliance fran\u00a2aise in\n-- in Monasteer. Then in 1924, my grandfather, Isaac, whose name I bear, was the\npresident of the Monasteer communit -- the Jewish community of Monasteer, and we\nhave a facsimile of his letter from Yale, in Yale, where\u2019s he\u2019s addressing the illion\nisrallitany versell in Paris, thanking them for the donations of clothing and money to\nthe Jews of Monasteer who had been severely -- suffered through fierce bombardment\nduring the first World War, to almost the total destruction of Jewish homes. Then --\nthen my uncle Solomon was the secretary of the Joint Distribution Committee in\nMonasteer, thanking the Jews of America for a shipment of clothing. All of that, in\naddition to being gratifying that -- that I -- I -- I have some lineage of people who gave\nsomething to the community, which reminded me of a thing my father would tell me\nwhen I was growing up, that human beings, in their infancy, for self preservation are\nvery selfish. They don\u2019t think about anybody else. Then they go to school, they meet\nother people, so they begin to share. When they have a family, they begin to give to\nothers. But some people stop there. Now, very few people begin to give to a larger\ncircle, namely their immediate community. Still fewer give to even larger circle, the\ncountry to which they belong. And finally, extremely few, maybe one in million, give\nto the entire world. So the idea of -- of giving back harks back -- and I don\u2019t know\nwhether my father was saying it because of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the history\nthat he knew of the environment of his own ancestors in community affairs. So \u2019m\nglad that -- that -- that to some extent -- and I also believe that there is a kind of a\nledger that somebody keeps, and so I -- I like to make the books balance. So that\u2019s the\nkind of -- of reward that the work is -- that I\u2019ve done represents, and then finally that I\nmay be able, both through the video recording, as well as the audio recording, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- sort of relieves me from something else that my children have been asking me\ninsistently to do, to write my memoirs. So at least I -- 1f -- 1f I only write certain other\nparts, and I don\u2019t write others, as least there will still be part of the record that they can\nrefer to, 1f they choose to, after I\u2019m gone.
