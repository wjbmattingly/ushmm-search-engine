        "A: I was living with my parents and with my sister, which was six years older than\nme and played extremely important role in my life. It was rather a normal life. I\nattended private school all my life, and it was expected of me to do my homework\nand to be a good student. And it was a girls\u2019 school. The name of the school was\nFrieda Mierlos(ph) in Warsaw, and I went there from kindergarten through 12 \u2014\nno, the \u2014 I graduate gi \u2014 this was a gymnasium, which I graduate in 1936. I became\n\u2014I got very good education in the school and after this I apply to law school, which\nOctober 8, 1993\nwasn\u2019t my first choice. Originally I wanted to be a pediatrician, but since being\nJewish it was impossible to get to medical school in Warsaw. I even mentioned to\nmy parents that I would like to go to France, but my parents were old fashioned and\nthe idea of a girl going to France didn\u2019t appeal to them. Could be if I would really\nfight, and wanted very much, I would go, but the upbringing was totally different\nthan it is now of young people. And I was two years in law school, which I didn\u2019t\nfinish because it was in subject that it was ancient law and middle age law which\nappealed to me. And then for a \u2014 before the war started, I was helping my father in\nhis factory, where I was typing a little bit, doing some bookkeeping, but nothing to\nget excited. And then the war started \u2014",

        "Q: Did you live in a Jewish neighborhood, or \u2014\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: It was a Jewish \u2014 not a goo \u2014 not a nice neighborhood. I would say too, except\nthe janitor, hundred percent people were Jewish. Had three courts. The name of the\nstreet was Simonhof(ph) 13. It wasn\u2019t a nice neighborhood.",
        "Q: Why? In what sense?",
        "A: Why? The streets were narrow, the people \u2014 the stores were ugly. Everything was\n\u20141if anybody knows Warsaw, they know that it wasn\u2019t a nice neighborhood. I was\nwalking to school, we had always a housekeeper and we\u2019re going for vacation, I\nwent to camp. And I went even before the war to Latvia to see my father\u2019s family,\nmy grandmother, which I hardly knew, my aunts and uncles and cousins. And I had\nmany, many friends and it was a nice, quiet life, I would say. I didn\u2019t know any\nbetter.",
        "Q: Were your friends Jewish children?",
        "A: Majority of them were Jewish. As I say, except the janitor and the housekeeper,\neverybody was Jewish.",
        "Q: And at school were your other classmates all Jewish also?",
        "A: This was a Jewish private school. However, my first encounter was in law\nschool, where, you know, it was a slogan, down with Jews. But the Jewish girls were\nthe \u2014 we should be with the Jewish women but not with the Jewish men. And I\nOctober 8, 1993\nwitnessed when they were cutting with the blades, the coats from the Jewish\nstudents, it was winter. Do you know what I am talking about?",
        "Q: Well, you want to tell us a little bit more about that? Who was doing it?",
        "A: It was tremendous hatred toward Jewish students. I went to University of Joseph\nPilsudski, which was \u2014 at this time he was dead, because he died when I graduate\nmy gymnasium. And the hatred, there were many things which couldn\u2019t \u2014 Jews\ncouldn\u2019t get. The majority of Jews who wanted to be physicians went to Italy, to\nFrance, to Czechoslovakia. And they tried everything, although some of them were\nvery poor and it was very hard to support themselves overseas, but they were\nworking as waiters and some help from the parents. However, since I was accepted\nto law school, and in the beginning I thought maybe I\u2019Il be a law-lawyer, and \u2014\nhowever when the instructor professor was coming to the class and you know, the\nJews were sit \u2014 standing behind the benches and he said still, the Jewish student will\nnot sit on the left hand side, I will not start the lecture. And he was leaving, and this\nwas right away totally chaos in the class because the Christian were beating up\nimmediately the Jewish male students. The women they didn\u2019t touch. And many\ntimes when I was walking on the street in Warsaw, in so called mixed\nneighborhood [indecipherable] Christian, I saw men who were attacked by young\nChristian boys.\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "Q: Did you yourself experience, an \u2014 I mean, I know you observed anti-Semitic\nincidents, did you yourself \u2014",
        "A: I tell you, til the war \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 experience any?",
        "A: \u2014I didn\u2019t have any contact exactly, I didn\u2019t have any Christian friends. I \u2014 so 1-I \u2014\nI was very limited because I was living in a ghetto, you know, yeah. I was going to\nshows, and we went to opera. I remember \u201cMadame Butterfly\u201d was a Japanese\nsong \u2014 singstress \u2014 sa\u2014 woman who was singing. And however my direct contact,\nso different from my husband, who went to a state school, was totally different.\nSome of our teachers in my gymnasium were Christian, however, it was a different\nrelation.",
        "Q: How religious was your family?",
        "A: My mother was a believer, my father wasn\u2019t. He \u2014 Friday within \u2014 my mother\nwas lighting candles, but my father was never there because he was working\nSaturday. The business was open on Saturday and Sunday he was off. And my\nmother was kosher \u2014 the home was kosher, however, my father outside was eating\nnot kosher. And I was not believing at all, and my mother was always very upset\nbecause she couldn\u2019t understand why I cannot believe it. However, came a moment\nin her life when we\u2019re thrown out \u2014 during the ghetto, from our apartment and we\u2019re\nOctober 8, 1993\nliving not far from Umschlagplatz. You know what is Umschlagplatz? There were\nthe trains were loading the Jews, and the Jews were going to the trains with the\nname of God [indecipherable] I heard this, I remember. And she said, children,\ndon\u2019t believe in God. And I will never forget this because it was coming from a\nwoman who was so blindly believing in God that if the hole would open in front of\nme, and I will go in, it would be less than to hear from my mother that there was no\nGod.",
        "Q: Did you have any Jewish schooling?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Any training?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know how to \u2014I understand Yiddish, and now when I am working\nwith Russian refugees, they are very happy when they hear. My Yiddish 1s very\npoor, but I can manage very nicely. And they getting much better rapport than to \u2014\nthrough translator, which I always have. And since I\u2019m Polish, I understand Russian\ntoo.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",

        "Q: So you were considered middle class?",
        "A: Yes, upper middle class.",
        "Q: Upper middle class.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Why did you want to become a doctor?",
        "A: I loved children and I wanted to be a pediatrician and I felt \u2014 although I think I\nwas wrong because I\u2019m very poor with science, I am rather for humanities. And it\nwas glamorous and that\u2019s what I ar \u2014 but 1 \u2014 I \u2014 most likely 1-1t \u2014 it was not a strong\nwish, because I could go abroad, my father could support me.\nOctober 8, 1993",

So when my sister was going there which was helping my\nfather in business, she said to his brother-in-law, I have a very good looking sister\nand how about if we\u2019ll introduce? And when he saw me he decided that he fell in\nlove with me, most likely, but he was fighting \u2014 he wasn\u2019t ready to get married, my\nhusband.

        "Q: Did you have enough food?",
        "A: Yes, yes. We were comfortable, and we had jewelry which later on we\u2019re selling\nto survive, so it wasn\u2019t bad. I never suffered hunger. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t have a place where\nto sleep later on when I was acting as a Christian, but I had money to buy food. And\nthen in January, Gestapo came, three men from Gestapo and ask for Michael\nMinz(ph). And my sister grab him and run away through the kitchen entrance. That\nwere to [indecipherable]",
        "Q: This is her husband.",

He wasn\u2019t from Warsaw, he was from a different small town\nOctober 8, 1993\nin Poland, Miedzyrzecz, and they left a note. And when my father came back \u2014 that\nhe should go to the Gestapo they left a note \u2014 my sister didn\u2019t want to let him go to\nGestapo but my father \u2014 and we had a manager, my father, of this dyeing plant, who\nwas German descent. He was Polish, but he was a Volksdeutsche. His wife\nimmediately, you know, decided to, because they had privileges, they were like\nGermans. And he went with them. My sister was standing outside the Gestapo and\nher husband, they were married two years only, and this \u2014 this foreman, and they\narrested him.",
        "Q: Arrested your brother-in-law?",
        "A: Yes, and since then we didn\u2019t hear anything from them, and then we find out\nfrom other people, doctors, teachers, anybody who had some education was arrested.\n300 men. My just \u2014 my sister got very busy with some lawyers to find out what\nhappened to them [indecipherable]. Then we find out that they were killed right\naway in the forest near Warsaw. This was the cream of a cream, you know, the elite\nof the Jewish intelligence. As a matter of fact, she had a nervous breakdown after.\nShe became \u2014 she got a nervous hiccup I remember, and she was going to\nneurologists. We never heard from them. And then it was \u2014 we started to see \u2014 my\nfather was extremely enterprising, decided, you know, that he will dye \u2014 he will be\nbuying some linen and dyeing this home and selling maybe to outsider, this \u2014 but\nOctober 8, 1993\nthis didn\u2019t work. Then he started to plant some vegetables in some lots near the\nhouses. But by the time the vegetables were ripe, they were stolen by other people.\nHe was trying everything, he was extremely energetic, and \u2014 and he was even\nsmuggling \u2014 when the factory was \u2014 when the ghetto was closed, to supervise the\nwork, which it was there \u2014",
        "Q: When \u2014 when did his factory close down?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but it was walls and walls and we didn\u2019t let him and he was\ndenounced by a janitor from the place where it was in the factory, that he said when\nHitler will come, my father will kill him. The Christian janitor said this. They\narrested my father and they put him in a space where he couldn\u2019t stay, only he \u2014 he\ncould see \u2014 sit with the knees, you know, like this here. In those days a number\nwasn\u2019t called, they kept him 48 hours and they let him go, and he came back.",
        "Q: What month was this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Spring of \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 1940.",
        "A: Yeah. It was getting worse and worse and from the small town around the war\nzone, which were German liquidating, they were bringing everybody to Warsaw. So\nOctober 8, 1993\nwe had five rooms, two rooms we had to let \u2014 to sublet for people from L\u00e9dz, two\nfamilies. And the quarters are getting smaller and smaller, we are sleeping in the\ndining room, we are sleep \u2014 and I was sleeping together with my sister. Altogether \u2014\nthe ration was bread which wasn\u2019t edible but [indecipherable] it was more sent that\nit was bread, but we didn\u2019t suffer hunger. However, was interesting, when\nsomebody, when the neighbors sometimes were coming, we were trying to clean up\nfrom the table, because not to show that we have food and maybe they don\u2019t have it.\nAnd then they liquidated second part of the ghetto which was in a different part of\nWarsaw and they brought everybody to this part where we were.",
        "Q: So your house was already in where the ghetto was \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And the ghetto was closed off in October of 1940.",
        "A: Yes, but this time already we had two ghettos. In 1940, originally a different part\nof Warsaw had the ghetto, and where I was living. Then, slowly, they liquidated the\nother part, and everybody was here, you know. Don\u2019t forget the meantime they were\ngrabbing people more and more and sending and many people voluntary were\ncoming because they were starving from hunger. I remember some second or third\ncousin came. They took away her husband. She came with two children to say\ngoodbye. She said, I was told that there were work, and I will be able \u2014 they will\nOctober 8, 1993\nsupport us, and she was going herself to Umschlagplatz. And there were many like\nthis. They couldn\u2019t survive. They were more and more dead body on the street in\nWarsaw, especially children, who are dying with their genitals covered with those\ngarbage flies. It was awful. And I remember I was carrying in a packet stockings,\nwhich I was taking to somebody, you know, I \u2014 it is very hard for \u2014 when you had to\nrun, there were people who were fixing this. So a kid grabbed the bag from my hand\nand started to eat. They thought this is a brown bag, that this is food. It was getting\nworse and worse, you know. The Gestapo and the Germans were beating up walking\non the street. You couldn\u2019t cross the street. And the walls which they built, you\nknow, people were smuggling because there was still some getting food. Kids were\nsmuggling and they were killing those children near the walls, if they were carrying\na bread, or something. It \u2014 and less and less people were, because the trains to\nTreblinka were going all the time. We didn\u2019t know the Treblinka \u2014 some people\nwere even getting cards, come here because we are working and everything is fine.\nThe German machine was so sophisticated and complicated, that they could\naccomplish that people voluntary were going. I-It was totally unbelievable. And we\nwere selling many things. I remember my mother had the chain which was from my\ngrandmother, and \u2014 and every time, you know, we \u2014 we had to \u2014 there were still\npeople who were selling this to the Christian. First of all, the first time we had to\nOctober 8, 1993\ngive away the radios, bring to the precinct. Then the fur coats. Then everything that\nwas valuable, they could come to you and \u2014 and clean up the whole house, you\nknow, yeah. And the quarters, living quarters were getting smaller and smaller. My\nmother was kosher, and my father brought, how you call slonina, felt from the pig?\nHow you call in eng \u2014",
        "Q: Lard?",
        "A: Lard, yeah. And h-he brought a big piece, and she was, you know, a \u2014 how you\ncall \u2014",
        "Q: Cooking?",
        "A: Not cooking only, because it was a piece, so she had to make like butter, how \u2014\nhow you say \u2014",
        "Q: Melting it.",
        "A: Melting it. And she said, I\u2019m \u2014 and he told her that this is lamb fat. And she said,\nI wonder why I didn\u2019t \u2014 why we didn\u2019t use this before the war, it tastes so good, you\nknow. She was very naive in this respect. And he was much more enterprising, he\nwas a very strong man. When you couldn\u2019t get coal, and our apartment were\nwarming u \u2014 warm up by coal, he brought half a ton of coal up on the 10\" floor on\nhis back. And then it came that they moved \u2014 they started to build the shops for\nGerman industry, you know, we were working. First of all they throw us out from\nOctober 8, 1993\nthis apartment, there were still four of us, from the ghetto. And they took \u2014 they\ngave us one room near the Umschlagplatz where \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember when this was?",
        "A: May [| ask [indecipherable] maybe he remembers?\nA2: [indecipherable] I remember it?",
        "Q: That\u2019s all right, okay.",
        "A: We were there a short time. Few months, I think we were. So we left the\napartment the way we were. We weren\u2019t allowed to take anything. We went down\nand I will never \u2014 one room and it happened that this apartment, I met later a woman\nwho survived Russia, was her parents\u2019 apartment. I will never forget this apartment\nbecause the bedbugs were coming from the ceiling.",
        "Q: This is the new place?",
        "A: The new place, yeah. And it was a balcony and we heard the trains coming and\nthe Jews going to the train, and praying to God. And it was constant. The trains were\ngoing constantly. And then they opened the Germans shops, and we were able \u2014 I\nand my \u2014 my mother, when we\u2019re going to the shops we\u2019re hiding her. We put a big\ncloset, you know, and cover part of the wall and [indecipherable] because she\ncouldn\u2019t work. She \u2014 she had heavy arthritis and she was overweight. So my father\nwas working in a different shop and my sister and myself were working not far from\nOctober 8, 1993\nmy father in a different shop. The name of the shop was [indecipherable] roefrich,\nr-0-e-f-r-i-c-h, from [indecipherable] and we\u2019re sewing uniforms. There I met part\nJews, which I never met before, it was the working class of Jews. Bund, b-u-n-d.\nAnd they were singing the Jewish songs very, you know [indecipherable] you\nknow, all those [indecipherable] and \u2014 you know, and they were those one who\nstarted later the uprising. They were very, very important Jews that I met in my life,\nwhich some of them survived. And they were much more doing for the Jews than\npeople like me, who was a Jewish princess. And then we\u2019re sewing, but then started\nselection. All the time the Gestapo was coming. We all had to go outside and they\nwere looking if there were older people or some people who had the pimple on the\nnose or something, they were taking away. And meantime there was, in 1942, the\nstreet of \u2014 name was Millar(ph) and this time was a big selection and they took\ntremendous amount of Jews. And I will never forget my neighbors, who had the\nlittle girl Marilka(ph) and they put her in a suitcase and they made holes in the\nsuitcase for air. However, she started to cry. They were living on the same house,\nand Germans put the cara \u2014 machi \u2014 guns, and shot this suitcase, as \u2014 this couple left\nthe suitcase and walked away. There are things which always stays in your mind. So\nthere were less and less Jews in the ghetto because they were killed, or they were\ntaking to Treblinka. We didn\u2019t notice the \u2014 there were some people who are coming\nOctober 8, 1993\nfrom Treblinka who threw themselves together with the clothing, because they\nwere telling them that you have to go and you know, to the shower and this \u2014 those\nthings, you know. So, you know, some of them who are helping to sort the clothes\ninto this, th-the shoes, and \u2014 th-they got back to Warsaw and they say remember,\nTreblinka has ba \u2014 is burning \u2014 crematoriums are working day and night. So with\nthat already, the idea that this 1s not that they are sending them to work, only they\nare sending them to be killed.",
        "Q: So you were called out some \u2014 for selections that time?",
        "A: I was not, no, because we\u2019re young. My sister and I were young, and my father,\nwho was this time in the late 50\u2019s was hiding when they were calling. You know,\nyou never knew for whom they were looking. However, one week \u2014",
        "Q: Were you ever called down to \u2014 to the street? You were never called down to \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: However, once we came, and the hot soup was on the table, my mother was gone.\nShe came out from this hiding place to cook the soup for us, and they came and they\ntook her away. I run to Umschlagplatz, but she was gone. We continued work, and\nonce I came and I heard that they took my sister. And I went to Umschlagplatz and\nthey told me that she was on this and this train, which was staying, and I entered the\nOctober 8, 1993\ntrain. When I was in the train, they told me that my sister was hiding, that she wasn\u2019t\non that train, and I decided to jump. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 the train was just moving, so I \u2014 I\nwasn\u2019t a heroine, you know. They helped me, you know, and they picked me up and\nthrough the window, because the doors were locked. My sister heard that I was in\nthe train, she went to the other train. She was extr \u2014 extremely important to me. In\nthe same time, we jumped from two different wagons and we met on the outside of\nthe train and we went back to the ghetto. And my father was sitting on the floor near\nthe door. He said, I knew that you will come back. We decided that we have to do\nsomething to leave the ghetto because we didn\u2019t have a chance. My father knew a\nman, a Christian, he was a lawyer, who took over the management of his factory.\nAnd through him we got false papers for my sister and for myself. I was looking\nmore like Christian than her, because the whole Jewish tragedy was in her eyes. You\nknow, they say [indecipherable] in Jewish eyes, there is such a thing. I was always\nsmiling and \u2014 and really, although \u2014 and my Polish and her Polish was excellent, and\nthis was extremely important. And we said \u2014 and it was very hard for her to move\naround because she could be very easy recognized. So through this man he found\nsomebody, and she was sitting mostly inside. This was April, before the uprising.",
        "Q: April 1943.\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: Yes. And I got papers too, and I went \u2014 I rented somebody \u2014 my friend told me\nthat she\u2019s coming back to the ghetto because her husband \u2014 as a man you didn\u2019t have\na chance, because of circumcision. And I took over her room. And I was working in\nthe ghetto as a Christian this time. I could see my father, I had papers as a Christian.",
        "Q: What kind of work were you doing?",
        "A: This was factory for Germany.",
        "Q: Manufacturing work.",
        "A: Yeah, I was very gutsy. They were making \u2014 I \u2014 from lead or something. It was a\nshort time. I was coming in the morning, and leaving five o\u2019clock. This time I could\nal \u2014 I could always bring for my father some food, who was in a different\n[indecipherable] this time. My sister was already on the false paper hidden, you\nknow. And then it was Passover, the first Seder, Sunday night and I stayed, I wanted\nto be with my father. And he asked me stay there today, maybe it was Sunday night.\nI say okay, I will stay. And the next morning when I got up, it was Monday, I found\nout that the uprising was, but it was in different \u2014 it was 1n the part of the ghetto\nwhere my husband was. And I got dressed, I had the coat with the collar from a\nrabbit. Jews weren\u2019t allowed, so when I went to the false paper, I bought myself a\nrabbit and I put to my coat to look more like Christian. And I went to the guard and I\npassed the \u2014 it was a house ba \u2014 from \u2014 who had two entrances from the street. The\nOctober 8, 1993\nJews in towers were staying in the court and praying to God. It was quiet in this part\nof the ghetto because the uprising started there. And I went to the guard, I showed\nhim the papers. He said, what you are doing in the ghetto? I said [indecipherable]\ncaught me, and I decided I didn\u2019t have a choice, I had to stay. He looked at me, he\nlooked at the paper, and as I say, the number was [indecipherable] and he let me\nthrough. And near the guard were children six, seven years old, Jude, Jude, waiting\nfor the Jews to show them to the German. I had guts, and I walked in with my head\nup. And my sister, maybe one street from there she was waiting. She knew that to\nget out I had to come there. She knew that \u2014 she was sure that she will never see me.\nAnd I met her and I said, don\u2019t go in there, because it was the worst time. The\nPolacks were showing left and right, you know, and they could recognize me. No\nGermans stopped me in two and a half years. But the Polacks, who knew me from\nuniversity one, my husb \u2014 my father\u2019s work and \u2014 and luckily that I had money,\nbecause this man, my father gave him money, and whenever I needed. And there\nwas incident when I was living in the room, in the furnished room, there was a little\nboy, the first question he asked me, if I ever saw a Jew. So I said yes. Is this true that\nJew have a tail? I said, I don\u2019t think so, but I don\u2019t know. And when they started the\nuprising in ghetto, I \u2014 I knew that I have a father there and I had a husband \u2014\nhusband, not a husband, we weren\u2019t officially married, but I \u2014 I felt, you know. I\nOctober 8, 1993\nwent to the wall, and I was looking and next to me was standing a Christian woman\nand she said, very good that they burning the Jews, only they spoiling our Easter.\nThis was vox populi, it wasn\u2019t a single voice, everybody felt the same way. As I\nwas living in this furnished room, once is coming a woman and she said to me, may\nI see your papers? I said yes. What happened to the woman which was living here\nbefore, she was Jewish, are you Jewish, too? I said, I don\u2019t know if \u2014 I never met\nher, but I\u2019m not Jewish. She said, anyway, we\u2019ll go to Gestapo. She \u2014 it was after the\ncurfew. She was a Polish woman, but she was working for the Germans, and she \u2014\nwe're walking, it was quite a walk. We were walking, I said look, I can give you\nmoney, I have a watch, let me go. She said no, we\u2019re going. Suddenly she got\ntremendous pain, and we stopped near the pharmacy where she was ringing the bell,\nit was after the curfew. And the owner was living in the same building, opened the\ndoor for us, and we walked in and she said to him, if you will let her go, she is\nJewish, you will be killed too. You have to help me. And he gave her some\nmedication, I don\u2019t remember, and she continued to walk with me. We\u2019re maybe\nquarter of a mile from Gestapo, she said give me the money and give me the watch.\nI will [indecipherable] but I will not do anything to you. And I didn\u2019t move. I get\nout from this room and I didn\u2019t have a place where to go. I went to the hotel in a\nvery nice neighborhood in Warsaw, Marshal(ph) Kostka(ph) street. And the man\nOctober 8, 1993\nwho took my papers said, I am sure your papers are all right because Gestapo 1s\ncoming every night and checking the papers. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I said, my\npapers are okay. And I was sleeping there, nobody came. And I was looking through\nthe window, and I wanted to commit suicide. I had nothing to lose. And I said, if\nthey will find me, they will not know even who am I. But I was young, an-and I said\nno, you cannot give up. And the next morning I walked on the street, and I met my\nfriend, a Jewish woman who was working as a governess, French governess. She\nwas studying medicine in France and her French was perfect and we were very\nfriendly. She was working for a very nice family. She was taking care of two girls.\nAnd she said \u2014 I said, Marisha(ph), I don\u2019t have a place where to go. She said,\ntoday we\u2019re interviewing for my woman where I\u2019m working. She has a mother in a\nsmall town [indecipherable] and we\u2019re looking for a housekeeper. You come and I\nam going to interview, and you\u2019ll get the job. I went for the interview, you know, it\nwas like I \u2014 I am talking to you and I think I am lying. I-It\u2019s hard to believe. I went\nthere and this woman came to see me and then she said to her, you know what? She\nlooks a little bit Jewish. But she was a nice woman. She said oh no, you know, she\u2019s\nfrom a different town only. Because my papers were from a small town, from\nCzestochowa, and I went there.",
        "Q: What was your name then? Were you \u2014\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: Stefania(ph) Dolinska(ph). I have the Kennekarta. And I was two years older\nfrom 1917, and the parents were illiterate, you know, I \u2014 I had to \u2014 to have a family.\nSo wherever I went I had an aunt, an uncle, you know, everything was fiction.",
        "Q: And what town were you born in?",
        "A: I was born in Warsaw, and it was in Warsaw, and this was Czestochowa.",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m saying the papers \u2014",
        "A: That it said what \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the papers said you were born \u2014",
        "A: Czestochowa.",
        "Q: Czestochowa.",
        "A: And this \u2014 there was a well known shrine of Saint Mary, she was black, that\nMatka Czestochowska, yeah. Very well known. And I was carry \u2014 wearing, of\ncourse, a big cross and all the things. And if you would wake me up during the\nnight, I could recite all the Catholic prayers by heart.",
        "Q: How did you learn them?",
        "A: I learned. I got the book and I \u2014 this was survival. And I went there and the \u2014 wa\n\u2014 one was deaf and one was blind. And I wasn\u2019t prepared to work, I was a Jewish\nprincess, I got the wrong education. And when I cook potatoes I didn\u2019t know that\nyou need water. So I felt the potatoes will give waters all when they started. When\nOctober 8, 1993\nshe walked in she said oh, Stefcha(ph) forgot to put \u2014 not enough water. So it\ndawned on me. They once were going to confession, so she said, let\u2019s hurry, because\nI was going to church with them. I said yes, only I will finish my breakfast. I forgot\nthat when you going to confession, you don\u2019t eat anything before. You know, they\nwere such a little things which \u2014 here I am coming from a family which wasn\u2019t\nassimilated one and here I am suddenly a Christian. The best place was ch-church.\nThen nobody was touching you, you know, you were pretending that you praying\nand you cover your eyes. But I-I was working. Like, I was washing the floors, I put\nsud on the floor and then you \u2014 you had to put clear water to remove the soap. So I\nwas swimming in the sud and I didn\u2019t know that you need clear water. And I was\nthere and it was rather good, you know. I \u2014 my sister, before I left, she dye my hair,\nyou know, blonde. And I couldn\u2019t become blonde somehow, I \u2014 I\u2019m very dark, now\nI color. And I was a reddish hair, but I was good looking and I had guts, you know,\nyeah, I \u2014 and my eyes were happy. And I was working there for a short time and\nthen I went to Warsaw. I \u2014 for \u2014 I was going for weekend, I \u2014 I said that I had \u2014 and\n[indecipherable] said, oh good that Stefcha(ph) because the [indecipherable] came\nand he is checking everybody\u2019s paper, so I said that you will come tonight. I say, oh\nI am so sorry. My aunt got very sick and I have to stay with [indecipherable] it was\nsplit of a second. I came only to get \u2014 I had a small suitcase, and a pillow you know,\nOctober 8, 1993\nI was carrying here like \u2014 because this was a \u2014 the servants were, pillow and a\nblanket, you know, you \u2014 you needed your own. She says, oh please tell him that\nwhen my aunt will get better, I will come back and I will go to him. And I\ndisappeared.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back. Did you ever go to confession in the church?",
        "A: No. I said that I am going, but I didn\u2019t. And \u2014 but I was going to communion, you\nknow, and I was whe \u2014",
        "Q: You took communion?",
        "A: And I went to Warsaw and I had a friend who was looking very Jewish. Her\nname was Roma, too. This is the same friend that when he came and he saw the\nname, you know, he thought this is a man, yeah. She was living with her mother.\nHer mother Jewish was atrocious \u2014 Polish was atrocious, so she pretended that she\nwas mute. However, my friend had very curly hair like black, like afro, so she\ncouldn\u2019t leave the house, so the mother was coming out and going, you know,\nshopping, pointing, you know, the \u2014 and the daughter was always home. So\nwhenever I was desperate, which was not fair to them, I was going to them for the\nnight when it was dark, and the janitor was the biggest enemy. Sneaking, and\nspending the night.",
        "Q: What was her name?\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: Roma Fleischman(ph). The mother was a wa \u2014 I was telling them when we\u2019re\nsitting there, the first train I will be sitting, and the mother said no, we\u2019ll stay here.\nAnd then, you know, I heard that there is a job on a farm, to milk the cows, to help\nwith the far \u2014 I was all used to farm like \u2014 now I would go, maybe as astronaut I\nwould be better. So I went there and there was a wife after a \u2014 a \u2014 a widow after a\njudge and a big farm. And she said to me, do you know how to milk the cow? I\nfigured, what\u2019s a \u2014 wha-what\u2019s so easy th \u2014 bi-big deal, you know? I was wearing\nsilk stockings, and my Polish was so good and my handwriting was so good. You\nknow, for a maid in Poland, who were mostly illiterate, but I told them that I was\nworking as a bookkeeper in this different city. So now I \u2014 since I moved, my parents\ndie, everybody, you know, to convenience. Sometimes they were alive, sometimes\nthey were dead. And she says okay, so milk this cow. I started to pull, kill me,\ncouldn\u2019t get a drop of milk and the flies were biting me through the stockings and\nthe cow was hitting me with the tail. And \u2014 and she looked at me, she said, you\ndon\u2019t look like a girl who knows \u2014 who was working on a farm. I am sorry, but I\ncannot keep you. I left again. In between there, there were jobs where I felt that this\nis not safe, that I have to leave, you know. So after two days I was leaving without,\nyou know, and I didn't \u2014 I had working papers, which were extremely important. By\nOctober 8, 1993\nthe way, I forgot to tell you, when I was going to get my Kennekarta(ph) with my\nbirth certificate, which I got to my hand \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: \u2014I got my false paper, I needed a Kennkarta, which was the official germ \u2014\nGerman document to live in occupied Poland. And when I went on the way there to\nthis German office where they were giving the Kennkarta with my picture, I had a\npicture with my nose like this, I\u2014 you will see the picture. And on the way there\nsomebody stole from me the \u2014 the \u2014 my pocketbook. And I didn\u2019t have the birth\ncertificate. And I called up this man, Mr. Rokulski(ph), he said, I cannot get \u2014 you\nhave to go to the Church of che \u2014 of Three Crosses, that was a big church in Poland,\nand ask for the birth certificate. I didn\u2019t have a choice, this was like \u2014 like going in a\n\u20141n a mousetrap and I went there and I ask and they gave me. I don\u2019t know if she\nwas alive or she was dead, you know\u201d? Could be if I would ask for death certificate,\nthey would give me too. So again I went and I got the Kennkarta which w \u2014 and a\narbeitskarta, work paper, which was extremely important because when the\nGermans were stopping me, when I had the arbeitkarta, this work karta, they let\nme loose. My dream was to get to Germany, to work in Germany as a Polish girl.\nHowever, you couldn\u2019t volunteer, because if they would see a woman like me\nOctober 8, 1993\nvolunteer, there was a priest who was specializing in recognizing Jews. He would\nsee right away that the woman, you know, with my Polish, is not voluntary to go to\nwork as a\u2014 in labor camp. So my only hope was to be caught by the German, and to\nsend to Germany. But because of my arbeitkarta, they never \u2014 I went to library,\nthe ju \u2014 Gestapo came to library. I showed them my paper, they let me loose. And \u2014",
        "Q: You were \u2014 you were talking about you left the farm \u2014",
        "A: I left the farm.",
        "Q: \u2014 where \u2014 where you couldn\u2019t milk the cow, and then what happened?",
        "A: Yeah, and I looked and I-I \u2014 I was at the end \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I looked in the paper.\nHowever, it \u2014 1t was \u2014 I went on \u2014 on another job where I was two days. And the\nman \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 the man was looking at me very suspicious. You know, you develop\na different sense, where is \u2014 wh-where you are not sure if \u2014 1f you will not be caught,\nyou know, yeah. And it was split of a second was deciding about your life. So I flew\ndown to that \u2014 near Warsaw was a summer place where they were before the war\nsending TB patients. Otwotski(ph), it was. And they are looking for people to \u2014\nchambermaids and other workers to change from that hotel to hospital for German\nsoldiers. So I went there. It was run \u2014 supervised by nuns, and I was working there,\nit was empty. They were preparing for the German soldiers.",
        "Q: What time of year was this?\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: It was summer.",
        "Q: Summer *44?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I was there and so I read, you know, from the employment, a German\nemployment that they are looking for a governess in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.\nGarmisch-Partenkirchen was Hitler\u2019 summer home. And intelligent, educated and\nI went there to this office. Well, the moment I walked in, I saw that I made a\nmistake. There was sitting a Polis Deutsche, a Polack who was a German, a German\ndescent. And I remember him when I was working when the ghetto started. You\nknow, they took the Jews to work to put the names in every building, you know,\nwho were \u2014 and he was there. And I \u2014 you know, I figure out he couldn\u2019t recognize\nme, but I\u2014 when I saw him, he was talking Polish. And I ask about the job, he said\nyes, yes, I will let you know. Where are you now? I said, I am here in this, I am\nworking here and here. When I came back to this place where I was working, the\nnun was waiting for me with a \u2014 my little suitcase. And she said, ste \u2014 Stefsha(ph),\nright away go to back Warsaw because Gestapo is coming to arrest you. They\nrecognize you. She took me to the train. I said, but I don\u2019t have a place where to go.\nShe said, go to th\u2014 our convent. She gave me the name of this Mother Superior in\nWarsaw and I went there. And they talked to me, they say we don\u2019t have a place\nOctober 8, 1993\nwhere to keep you for the night, but we have in the country a place, a convent. Take\nthe train and go there. I spent \u2014 they kept me three months there.",
        "Q: What convent was it?",
        "A: Marie\u2019s family \u2014 Mary\u2019s family. Regina Mary. The priest knew that I am\nJewish, the nuns didn\u2019t know. I shared the room with a nun who was shaved like\n[indecipherable] you know. And since I am very curious, I was asking what made\nthem become a nun, so I\u2019m \u2014 different story was there. And they had some Jewish\nchildren there in this convent. The ones that \u2014 I was working on the f\u2014 that was\ngardening, and they were, you know, vegetables, things, all I \u2014 and going \u2014 four\no\u2019clock in the morning we\u2019re going to church. And it was already cold, it was\ncoming winter.",
        "Q: What town was this in?",
        "A: Grodzisko Mazovieke, g-r-o-d-z-i-s-k-0, one word. Mazovieke, m-a-z-o0-v-i-e-\nk-e. And he said, I am very sorry, but you cannot stay here any more, because we\u2019 Il\njeopardize the life of the children. And people are asking question what \u2014 I wasn\u2019t a\nnun, you know, I was in my normal thing. I said, so \u2014 but I have no place where to\ngo, so they sent me back. I ca \u2014 bought the paper, and it was my last job in Warsaw\nand they said in case they will need reference, I can give them their references,\nwhich was extremely important.\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "Q: You had stayed there three months?",
        "A: Yeah. After the three months, you know, in the country. And I started to work\nwith a woman who was a white Russian. She was Russian Orthodox. You know, ye\n\u2014 after the revolution in Russia, there were white Russian we \u2014 who went to Poland,\nto China, to all over the world. And he was a Volksdeutsche, again. He recognize\nme, but I was good for him and he was good for me, because he knew that is coming\nend of the war, and he had the uniform. Once, I took the uniform and I put on the\nbalcony, and I thought that he will kill me. He grabbed the uniform because he\ndidn\u2019t want any Polacks to know that he\u2019s a Volksdeutsche. You know,\nVolksdeutsche was a person who was born from German descent. Lempke(ph) was\nhis name. It was and it wasn\u2019t a German name, but it was convenient. He got the\nPolish villa in the country from a \u2014a-\u2014a Jewish villa, where Jews used to go, a\nbeautiful apartment and he awa \u2014 had a sewing \u2014 a salon, you know, where she had\nthe manager, and women sewing dresses made to order. Everything that they had\nwas from Jews, different monograms, you know. And th \u2014 he had girlfriend, because\nwhen the telephone was ringing, when I was picking up, nobody answered.\nHowever, when he was picking up, he was oh, how are you Mrs. this and this, you\nknow. And she was older than him, and she had the dog, a Pekinese dog who hated\nmy guts, the dog. I hated the dog, too. I was sleeping dressed up \u2014 dressed. I couldn't\nOctober 8, 1993\nget undressed because I felt 1n case somebody will come from the front door, I will\nbe able to run through the back door. And I was singing in there, you know, it was\ncurfew hours, eight o\u2019clock. I was singing in \u2014 every home had the altar. So who\nwas singing? The maids were singing. And everybody was sending the maids to sing\nand to pray in the altar.

This was the\nworst time for Jews who \u2014 which were hidden, because they were the \u2014 the color of\nthe walls, you know, they were hidden. They didn\u2019t see fresh air for so many years,\nso when they were coming out from those hidden places, you could recognize them\nright away. I was looking like milk and honey. I never suffered hunger. I \u2014 you\nknow, my eyes were smiling, and \u2014 and I had guts.

And the food\nwas scare, but since we had growing there, you know, yeah \u2014 we had Christmas\nthere even, and I remember that they killed a goat, which was smelling like\nanything. And I remember the first time I saw a girl who had epilepsy attack. She\nwas younger than me, a Jewish girl. She fell down on the floor and I remember they\nOctober 8, 1993\nput a knife with a wooden handle between her teeth. We don\u2019t do this any more, I\nwanted to tell you. And we\u2019re sitting on \u2014 and this woman, she knew. She didn\u2019t\ndirectly, you know, nobody came to her, say I\u2019m Jewish. We didn't confess. But she,\nyou know, th \u2014 was smart enough, but she was \u2014 we survived there from October til\nJanuary eighth, where it was the end of the war for me. It was one day when the\nGermans left, and the Russian didn\u2019t come. I will never forget this day. And it was a\nawful day, you know, because here I am, I don\u2019t have to fight for my life, I don\u2019t\nhave anybody. And why I survive? What was the purpose? And I went to my \u2014 I\nwent to Warsaw, it was frozen, everything. Totally frozen, it was a very strong\nwinter. The Russians were coming and they were looking like beggars. Sleeping on\nthe ground and the Germans, who are escaping, were looking much better. And I\nwent to Warsaw, to my \u2014 where it was my parents, this house, Zamenhof\n[indecipherable] was living.

I wasn\u2019t ready mentally\nto walk in and to see what \u2014 what\u2019s going on. And as I was staying, there were two,\nmaybe four young boy soldiers in German \u2014 in Russian uniform, you could see that\nthey were Jewish. And they say to me in Polish, you know, what are you doing\nOctober 8, 1993\nhere? I said, I used to live here. They said, we used to live here too, we are Jewish. I\nsaid, I am Jewish too. They \u2014 you know, they say, you survived? Because it was\ntypical what my husband, everybody who survive were sure that I was the only one\nwho survive and a few other people. But we didn\u2019t know, you know, there was none\nn-no \u2014 no network, nobody was \u2014 was bringing the news like years ago in United\nStates by horse, you know, was traveling.

Do you know this family, the other fam \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nknow anybody. And \u2014 and they said, and where are you staying? I said, I think,\nbecause it was a whole block, that this is Zamenhof [indecipherable]. And th-they\nsaid, describe to me how the house was looking. And I went to Jewish committee,\nwhich was on Praga, on the other side of Vistula river, and I register, and people\nstarted \u2014 nobody yet was coming from Russia, because later \u2014 nobody yet was\ncoming from concentration camp because it was later. Lublin, however, was\nliberated. Have a \u2014 you see, if I would be on Praga, I would be liberated in August\nwhen the Russian came.

They were helping me unbelievable. I was going\nin the morning to the hospital, working one o\u2019clock to five, coming back, taking off.\nThey really \u2014 they when \u2014 totally we have thousand people working, this is a very\nbig organization and a wonderful, which is giving \u2014 getting from philanthropes and\nhalf government is paying.",

And I went to a well known psychiatrist and he said your\nson maybe is right, however he doesn\u2019t know that you were a grown up person when\nit happened. You will never bury them, you will live as [indecipherable] sister. I\ndon\u2019t think that [indecipherable] that I don\u2019t remember my sister.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you wish to say, that you want to share?",
        "A: That it can hap \u2014 I \u2014 over and over again, that people, especially when I am\ntalking on here longer than any other place, and I am American patriot and I feel this\nis a wonderful country, that American Jews are very shortsighted, that they don\u2019t\nrealize, even though here the Turks, that the Greek and the Italian are looking like\nJews, and this like that, and we had the scapegoat, we had black people, which are \u2014\nrefuse any more to be scapegoats, but this can happen. Even with a strong club, that\nwould happen. This is the way I feel. And the more, you know, and \u2014 and I was\nmaybe selfish because I wanted to save my own feelings. I didn\u2019t want to come and\nto talk and to dig out and then \u2014 but at certain moment it was pressure from our son,\ntoo, who 1s a psychiatrist, so \u2014 and he said, I remember the holidays and always you\nwere crying. You know, when Passover, it was Seder or something like this. And \u2014\nand you were always talking how was it, you know, and \u2014 and the memories and he\nsaid now \u2014 now that we have holidays, mostly we\u2019re going to her \u2014 to my daughter-\nOctober 8, 1993\nin-law parents, which are second generate \u2014 first gen \u2014 her parents were \u2014 her\nparents were from Hungary or Romania and he 1s too, but they are totally\nAmericanized, very well-to-do people. And \u2014 and they ha \u2014 nobody cries, nobody\ntalks about anything. Th-Th \u2014 different story. However, we\u2019re going for the second\nSeder to a young couple whose father was an editor of Jewish [indecipherable].\nAnd she reads in Yiddish, you know, about the [indecipherable] ghetto and my son\nwrites in English. And it has a meaning, you know? I became more, not religious,\nonly more traditional, you know, yeah. And I feel this is very little ah \u2014 I wou \u2014 if \u2014\nif my son wouldn\u2019t be born here, we wouldn\u2019t circumcise him most likely. And\nanyway, he was circumcised by the doctor, not by a moyl. A-And \u2014 however, he \u2014\nnow that I have three grandson, wonderful three boys, and I-I would like \u2014 I would\nlike a ni \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if I would like because for example, after the war, that I\ndidn\u2019t know that my husband survive or no, I could never marry the Gentile. And\nmany people just drop \u2014 they said \u2014 which, you cannot blame them, decided enough\nof being Jewish. When I decided to go back to school, you know, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I \u2014\nI wanted to be a librarian because I liked to read, but then I was discouraged. And\nthen after thinking over and between my husband and my son, you know, they said\nthat I\u2014I\u2014I-\u2014I should help people, you know. So I was working, when I got my\nMaster\u2019s degree in a state mental institution for 13 years, which wasn\u2019t that\nOctober 8, 1993\nrewarding because I couldn\u2019t do too much for them and you need some happy\nending. But I \u2014 even there, I was exposed to tremendous suffering, which to\ncompare to my, you know, those were people which were out, totally. They di \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t know what \u2014 they were for 50 years in a mental institution. And then when it\ncame the time for psychotropic drugs, you know, they started to give them, and \u2014\nand then they started to discharge them to nursing home which were worse than hell.\nAnd it \u2014 through all those years I did lots of growing you know, between the war\nand between my work, you know, I became extremely \u2014 much more tolerant and \u2014\nand a much better person than I ever would be, even not all those things. That\u2019s it.",

        "A: Going back to my life during \u2014 starting August first, where it was uprising, Polish\nuprising in Warsaw. There was time where there was nothing to eat because\nWarsaw was surrounded by Germans, and on the wa \u2014 Vistula river by Russia\nthere was no food coming in. All the horses were eaten up. This reminds me on the\nrevolution in France when they were eating rats and mice. There was \u2014 this was\nArmia Ludowa and Armia Krajowa. This was one which was to the left and one\nwas to the right. The Armia Krajowa was very much against Jews.

        "Q: When you found out.\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: When I found out, yeah. But then it was written a book by somebody, by a Polish\nwriter and she mentioned this [indecipherable] dog. I don\u2019t know if the dog has a\nname. But anything that was alive those days was doomed to be killed for food. One\nof the \u2014 after the war, when we\u2019re \u2014 I was working with my husband in Lodz and I\nsaw Mrs. Lempke(ph). This was the woman which \u2014 where I was working on my\nlast job on a maid. She didn't see me, and I said to my husband, you should hit her a\nfew times. And my husband said, she is a head taller than me, how can I do it? And\nshe wasn\u2019t good to you, you survi \u2014 she wasn\u2019t bad to you, you survive. So why \u2014\nwhy do you want me to harm her? I cannot do anything, right? And this was the end.\nBut I had a strange feeling that always I would \u2014 I-I would never go back to Poland,\nnever, never. Now we\u2019re \u2014 financially we\u2019re okay, that is out of question, but I\nremember when we we\u2019re struggling, I always used to say, if anybody would put a\nmillion dollars under condition that we\u2019ll go to Poland to visit, I wouldn\u2019t go. I hate\neverything that they did for us. And I hated that in a normal country like Denmark,\neven French were \u2014 was a excellent underground, although they have their own\nGestapo, Maquis and in other countries you hear so many beautiful stories. And\nthat\u2019s true that the nuns helped me, and there were other Polacks, but it is such a\nsmall percentage. Well, a \u2014 mostly a \u2014 were \u2014 where we had th-three and a half\nmillion Jews living in Poland, well before Germans enter Warsaw, the Polish\nOctober 8, 1993\npeople already was beating us up. The \u2014 before the war, you know, the \u2014 there was\ntremendous hatred always. And I am sorry that I was born in Poland, not here. Joe?",

        "A: I tell you, I had a good childhood, and I was 20 years old in 1939, and looking\nback, you know, maybe I didn\u2019t know any better. However, when I think \u2014 when I\ngot my \u2014 graduated gymnasium, I thought that I would conquer the world. I had so\nmany dreams which were never fulfilled, and I didn\u2019t realize, maybe because I was\nstupid, or young, that so many things were off the limits for us Jews in Poland.\nThey were talking about engineers jokingly, that they are to measure the street. The\ndoctors, if they didn\u2019t marry the rich girl, he couldn\u2019t open the office. Lawyers, the\nbar were closed for Jewish lawyers, young one. A Jew couldn't be a janitor, a Jew\ncouldn\u2019t be a chimney cleaner. A Jew couldn\u2019t get a city job. And now living here\nfor 44 years and to see what the opportunities everybody can have, I am for sure\nreinforce that it was the wrong place of birth for us. And I see how people are\ncoming from different country, working in my capacity, what the help they getting,\nwhat the chances they have to be somebody, to develop, to educate. To compare to\nOctober 8, 1993\nPoland and being born and being Polish citizen and fighting the Polish wars, we\ncouldn\u2019t get any place. That\u2019s it.

        "A: I was living with my parents and with my sister, which was six years older than\nme and played extremely important role in my life. It was rather a normal life. I\nattended private school all my life, and it was expected of me to do my homework\nand to be a good student. And it was a girls\u2019 school. The name of the school was\nFrieda Mierlos(ph) in Warsaw, and I went there from kindergarten through 12 \u2014\nno, the \u2014 I graduate gi \u2014 this was a gymnasium, which I graduate in 1936. I became\n\u2014I got very good education in the school and after this I apply to law school, which\nOctober 8, 1993\nwasn\u2019t my first choice. Originally I wanted to be a pediatrician, but since being\nJewish it was impossible to get to medical school in Warsaw. I even mentioned to\nmy parents that I would like to go to France, but my parents were old fashioned and\nthe idea of a girl going to France didn\u2019t appeal to them. Could be if I would really\nfight, and wanted very much, I would go, but the upbringing was totally different\nthan it is now of young people. And I was two years in law school, which I didn\u2019t\nfinish because it was in subject that it was ancient law and middle age law which\nappealed to me. And then for a \u2014 before the war started, I was helping my father in\nhis factory, where I was typing a little bit, doing some bookkeeping, but nothing to\nget excited. And then the war started \u2014",
        "A: In \u20141n the city of Warsaw I was living, we had a very nice, comfortable\napartment. I had the room which I share with my sister, which I adore. She paints\nmy life with roses. She was the best person before I met my husband, in my entire\nlife.",
        "A: Edith. Edith, Esfia(ph).\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: It was a Jewish \u2014 not a goo \u2014 not a nice neighborhood. I would say too, except\nthe janitor, hundred percent people were Jewish. Had three courts. The name of the\nstreet was Simonhof(ph) 13. It wasn\u2019t a nice neighborhood.",
        "A: Why? The streets were narrow, the people \u2014 the stores were ugly. Everything was\n\u20141if anybody knows Warsaw, they know that it wasn\u2019t a nice neighborhood. I was\nwalking to school, we had always a housekeeper and we\u2019re going for vacation, I\nwent to camp. And I went even before the war to Latvia to see my father\u2019s family,\nmy grandmother, which I hardly knew, my aunts and uncles and cousins. And I had\nmany, many friends and it was a nice, quiet life, I would say. I didn\u2019t know any\nbetter.",
        "A: Majority of them were Jewish. As I say, except the janitor and the housekeeper,\neverybody was Jewish.",
        "A: This was a Jewish private school. However, my first encounter was in law\nschool, where, you know, it was a slogan, down with Jews. But the Jewish girls were\nthe \u2014 we should be with the Jewish women but not with the Jewish men. And I\nOctober 8, 1993\nwitnessed when they were cutting with the blades, the coats from the Jewish\nstudents, it was winter. Do you know what I am talking about?",
        "A: It was tremendous hatred toward Jewish students. I went to University of Joseph\nPilsudski, which was \u2014 at this time he was dead, because he died when I graduate\nmy gymnasium. And the hatred, there were many things which couldn\u2019t \u2014 Jews\ncouldn\u2019t get. The majority of Jews who wanted to be physicians went to Italy, to\nFrance, to Czechoslovakia. And they tried everything, although some of them were\nvery poor and it was very hard to support themselves overseas, but they were\nworking as waiters and some help from the parents. However, since I was accepted\nto law school, and in the beginning I thought maybe I\u2019Il be a law-lawyer, and \u2014\nhowever when the instructor professor was coming to the class and you know, the\nJews were sit \u2014 standing behind the benches and he said still, the Jewish student will\nnot sit on the left hand side, I will not start the lecture. And he was leaving, and this\nwas right away totally chaos in the class because the Christian were beating up\nimmediately the Jewish male students. The women they didn\u2019t touch. And many\ntimes when I was walking on the street in Warsaw, in so called mixed\nneighborhood [indecipherable] Christian, I saw men who were attacked by young\nChristian boys.\nOctober 8, 1993",

I was going to\nshows, and we went to opera. I remember \u201cMadame Butterfly\u201d was a Japanese\nsong \u2014 singstress \u2014 sa\u2014 woman who was singing. And however my direct contact,\nso different from my husband, who went to a state school, was totally different.\nSome of our teachers in my gymnasium were Christian, however, it was a different\nrelation.",
        "A: My mother was a believer, my father wasn\u2019t. He \u2014 Friday within \u2014 my mother\nwas lighting candles, but my father was never there because he was working\nSaturday. The business was open on Saturday and Sunday he was off. And my\nmother was kosher \u2014 the home was kosher, however, my father outside was eating\nnot kosher. And I was not believing at all, and my mother was always very upset\nbecause she couldn\u2019t understand why I cannot believe it. However, came a moment\nin her life when we\u2019re thrown out \u2014 during the ghetto, from our apartment and we\u2019re\nOctober 8, 1993\nliving not far from Umschlagplatz. You know what is Umschlagplatz? There were\nthe trains were loading the Jews, and the Jews were going to the trains with the\nname of God [indecipherable] I heard this, I remember. And she said, children,\ndon\u2019t believe in God. And I will never forget this because it was coming from a\nwoman who was so blindly believing in God that if the hole would open in front of\nme, and I will go in, it would be less than to hear from my mother that there was no\nGod.",

And since I\u2019m Polish, I understand Russian\ntoo.",

However, when we came\nOctober 8, 1993\nto this country and it came to my daughter friend, she said, why your mommy is\ntalking Spanish? In her eyes it was that I was talking Spanish.",

And when he saw me he decided that he fell in\nlove with me, most likely, but he was fighting \u2014 he wasn\u2019t ready to get married, my\nhusband.

I went with my girlfriend to the country, to the\nmountains, it was August for a few weeks and he was there coming h \u2014 and I saw\nhim, he was always wearing tiny shorts because he is a very good tennis player. So I\nalways remember, and \u2014 and as a matter of fact, he made the j1 \u2014 I had the cold and I\nwas sharing the room with a girlfriend and he came in to find out about me, and he\nsaid make room. I was 20 years old and I got very insulted and I didn\u2019t talk to him\nfor a week. I was very naive, stupid. And then I saw him occasionally, but\nwhenever, as I said never had a date. He had some girlfriends and I have some\nboyfriends and the life went on, and in the ghetto when the ghetto was being closed\n\u2014 we were in the part which was ghetto, because it was a Jewish neighborhood.",
        "A: Yeah.",

And the life\nchanged completely. What I was doing, in the beginning were able to go to my\nfather\u2019 factory, which was still working, slowly. You know, it was outside of the\nghetto, his factory. And \u2014",
        "A: No, no.\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: No, but you know, there were strictly Christian neighborhoods and Jewish\nneighborhoods.",

        "A: Yes, yes. We were comfortable, and we had jewelry which later on we\u2019re selling\nto survive, so it wasn\u2019t bad. I never suffered hunger. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t have a place where\nto sleep later on when I was acting as a Christian, but I had money to buy food. And\nthen in January, Gestapo came, three men from Gestapo and ask for Michael\nMinz(ph). And my sister grab him and run away through the kitchen entrance. That\nwere to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. They left a note. They said that they came to Michael Minz(ph) to find out\nsome things from him. He wasn\u2019t from Warsaw, he was from a different small town\nOctober 8, 1993\nin Poland, Miedzyrzecz, and they left a note. And when my father came back \u2014 that\nhe should go to the Gestapo they left a note \u2014 my sister didn\u2019t want to let him go to\nGestapo but my father \u2014 and we had a manager, my father, of this dyeing plant, who\nwas German descent. He was Polish, but he was a Volksdeutsche. His wife\nimmediately, you know, decided to, because they had privileges, they were like\nGermans. And he went with them. My sister was standing outside the Gestapo and\nher husband, they were married two years only, and this \u2014 this foreman, and they\narrested him.",
        "A: Yes, and since then we didn\u2019t hear anything from them, and then we find out\nfrom other people, doctors, teachers, anybody who had some education was arrested.\n300 men. My just \u2014 my sister got very busy with some lawyers to find out what\nhappened to them [indecipherable]. Then we find out that they were killed right\naway in the forest near Warsaw. This was the cream of a cream, you know, the elite\nof the Jewish intelligence. As a matter of fact, she had a nervous breakdown after.\nShe became \u2014 she got a nervous hiccup I remember, and she was going to\nneurologists. We never heard from them. And then it was \u2014 we started to see \u2014 my\nfather was extremely enterprising, decided, you know, that he will dye \u2014 he will be\nbuying some linen and dyeing this home and selling maybe to outsider, this \u2014 but\nOctober 8, 1993\nthis didn\u2019t work. Then he started to plant some vegetables in some lots near the\nhouses. But by the time the vegetables were ripe, they were stolen by other people.\nHe was trying everything, he was extremely energetic, and \u2014 and he was even\nsmuggling \u2014 when the factory was \u2014 when the ghetto was closed, to supervise the\nwork, which it was there \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but it was walls and walls and we didn\u2019t let him and he was\ndenounced by a janitor from the place where it was in the factory, that he said when\nHitler will come, my father will kill him. The Christian janitor said this. They\narrested my father and they put him in a space where he couldn\u2019t stay, only he \u2014 he\ncould see \u2014 sit with the knees, you know, like this here. In those days a number\nwasn\u2019t called, they kept him 48 hours and they let him go, and he came back.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. It was getting worse and worse and from the small town around the war\nzone, which were German liquidating, they were bringing everybody to Warsaw. So\nOctober 8, 1993\nwe had five rooms, two rooms we had to let \u2014 to sublet for people from L\u00e9dz, two\nfamilies. And the quarters are getting smaller and smaller, we are sleeping in the\ndining room, we are sleep \u2014 and I was sleeping together with my sister. Altogether \u2014\nthe ration was bread which wasn\u2019t edible but [indecipherable] it was more sent that\nit was bread, but we didn\u2019t suffer hunger. However, was interesting, when\nsomebody, when the neighbors sometimes were coming, we were trying to clean up\nfrom the table, because not to show that we have food and maybe they don\u2019t have it.\nAnd then they liquidated second part of the ghetto which was in a different part of\nWarsaw and they brought everybody to this part where we were.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, but this time already we had two ghettos. In 1940, originally a different part\nof Warsaw had the ghetto, and where I was living. Then, slowly, they liquidated the\nother part, and everybody was here, you know. Don\u2019t forget the meantime they were\ngrabbing people more and more and sending and many people voluntary were\ncoming because they were starving from hunger. I remember some second or third\ncousin came. They took away her husband. She came with two children to say\ngoodbye. She said, I was told that there were work, and I will be able \u2014 they will\nOctober 8, 1993\nsupport us, and she was going herself to Umschlagplatz. And there were many like\nthis. They couldn\u2019t survive. They were more and more dead body on the street in\nWarsaw, especially children, who are dying with their genitals covered with those\ngarbage flies. It was awful. And I remember I was carrying in a packet stockings,\nwhich I was taking to somebody, you know, I \u2014 it is very hard for \u2014 when you had to\nrun, there were people who were fixing this. So a kid grabbed the bag from my hand\nand started to eat. They thought this is a brown bag, that this is food. It was getting\nworse and worse, you know. The Gestapo and the Germans were beating up walking\non the street. You couldn\u2019t cross the street. And the walls which they built, you\nknow, people were smuggling because there was still some getting food. Kids were\nsmuggling and they were killing those children near the walls, if they were carrying\na bread, or something. It \u2014 and less and less people were, because the trains to\nTreblinka were going all the time. We didn\u2019t know the Treblinka \u2014 some people\nwere even getting cards, come here because we are working and everything is fine.\nThe German machine was so sophisticated and complicated, that they could\naccomplish that people voluntary were going. I-It was totally unbelievable. And we\nwere selling many things. I remember my mother had the chain which was from my\ngrandmother, and \u2014 and every time, you know, we \u2014 we had to \u2014 there were still\npeople who were selling this to the Christian. First of all, the first time we had to\nOctober 8, 1993\ngive away the radios, bring to the precinct. Then the fur coats. Then everything that\nwas valuable, they could come to you and \u2014 and clean up the whole house, you\nknow, yeah. And the quarters, living quarters were getting smaller and smaller. My\nmother was kosher, and my father brought, how you call slonina, felt from the pig?\nHow you call in eng \u2014",
        "A: Lard, yeah. And h-he brought a big piece, and she was, you know, a \u2014 how you\ncall \u2014",
        "A: Not cooking only, because it was a piece, so she had to make like butter, how \u2014\nhow you say \u2014",
        "A: Melting it. And she said, I\u2019m \u2014 and he told her that this is lamb fat. And she said,\nI wonder why I didn\u2019t \u2014 why we didn\u2019t use this before the war, it tastes so good, you\nknow. She was very naive in this respect. And he was much more enterprising, he\nwas a very strong man. When you couldn\u2019t get coal, and our apartment were\nwarming u \u2014 warm up by coal, he brought half a ton of coal up on the 10\" floor on\nhis back. And then it came that they moved \u2014 they started to build the shops for\nGerman industry, you know, we were working. First of all they throw us out from\nOctober 8, 1993\nthis apartment, there were still four of us, from the ghetto. And they took \u2014 they\ngave us one room near the Umschlagplatz where \u2014",
        "A: May [| ask [indecipherable] maybe he remembers?\nA2: [indecipherable] I remember it?",
        "A: We were there a short time. Few months, I think we were. So we left the\napartment the way we were. We weren\u2019t allowed to take anything. We went down\nand I will never \u2014 one room and it happened that this apartment, I met later a woman\nwho survived Russia, was her parents\u2019 apartment. I will never forget this apartment\nbecause the bedbugs were coming from the ceiling.",
        "A: The new place, yeah. And it was a balcony and we heard the trains coming and\nthe Jews going to the train, and praying to God. And it was constant. The trains were\ngoing constantly. And then they opened the Germans shops, and we were able \u2014 I\nand my \u2014 my mother, when we\u2019re going to the shops we\u2019re hiding her. We put a big\ncloset, you know, and cover part of the wall and [indecipherable] because she\ncouldn\u2019t work. She \u2014 she had heavy arthritis and she was overweight. So my father\nwas working in a different shop and my sister and myself were working not far from\nOctober 8, 1993\nmy father in a different shop. The name of the shop was [indecipherable] roefrich,\nr-0-e-f-r-i-c-h, from [indecipherable] and we\u2019re sewing uniforms. There I met part\nJews, which I never met before, it was the working class of Jews. Bund, b-u-n-d.\nAnd they were singing the Jewish songs very, you know [indecipherable] you\nknow, all those [indecipherable] and \u2014 you know, and they were those one who\nstarted later the uprising. They were very, very important Jews that I met in my life,\nwhich some of them survived. And they were much more doing for the Jews than\npeople like me, who was a Jewish princess. And then we\u2019re sewing, but then started\nselection. All the time the Gestapo was coming. We all had to go outside and they\nwere looking if there were older people or some people who had the pimple on the\nnose or something, they were taking away. And meantime there was, in 1942, the\nstreet of \u2014 name was Millar(ph) and this time was a big selection and they took\ntremendous amount of Jews. And I will never forget my neighbors, who had the\nlittle girl Marilka(ph) and they put her in a suitcase and they made holes in the\nsuitcase for air. However, she started to cry. They were living on the same house,\nand Germans put the cara \u2014 machi \u2014 guns, and shot this suitcase, as \u2014 this couple left\nthe suitcase and walked away. There are things which always stays in your mind. So\nthere were less and less Jews in the ghetto because they were killed, or they were\ntaking to Treblinka. We didn\u2019t notice the \u2014 there were some people who are coming\nOctober 8, 1993\nfrom Treblinka who threw themselves together with the clothing, because they\nwere telling them that you have to go and you know, to the shower and this \u2014 those\nthings, you know. So, you know, some of them who are helping to sort the clothes\ninto this, th-the shoes, and \u2014 th-they got back to Warsaw and they say remember,\nTreblinka has ba \u2014 is burning \u2014 crematoriums are working day and night. So with\nthat already, the idea that this 1s not that they are sending them to work, only they\nare sending them to be killed.",
        "A: I was not, no, because we\u2019re young. My sister and I were young, and my father,\nwho was this time in the late 50\u2019s was hiding when they were calling. You know,\nyou never knew for whom they were looking. However, one week \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: However, once we came, and the hot soup was on the table, my mother was gone.\nShe came out from this hiding place to cook the soup for us, and they came and they\ntook her away. I run to Umschlagplatz, but she was gone. We continued work, and\nonce I came and I heard that they took my sister. And I went to Umschlagplatz and\nthey told me that she was on this and this train, which was staying, and I entered the\nOctober 8, 1993\ntrain. When I was in the train, they told me that my sister was hiding, that she wasn\u2019t\non that train, and I decided to jump. It wasn\u2019t \u2014 the train was just moving, so I \u2014 I\nwasn\u2019t a heroine, you know. They helped me, you know, and they picked me up and\nthrough the window, because the doors were locked. My sister heard that I was in\nthe train, she went to the other train. She was extr \u2014 extremely important to me. In\nthe same time, we jumped from two different wagons and we met on the outside of\nthe train and we went back to the ghetto. And my father was sitting on the floor near\nthe door. He said, I knew that you will come back. We decided that we have to do\nsomething to leave the ghetto because we didn\u2019t have a chance. My father knew a\nman, a Christian, he was a lawyer, who took over the management of his factory.\nAnd through him we got false papers for my sister and for myself. I was looking\nmore like Christian than her, because the whole Jewish tragedy was in her eyes. You\nknow, they say [indecipherable] in Jewish eyes, there is such a thing. I was always\nsmiling and \u2014 and really, although \u2014 and my Polish and her Polish was excellent, and\nthis was extremely important. And we said \u2014 and it was very hard for her to move\naround because she could be very easy recognized. So through this man he found\nsomebody, and she was sitting mostly inside. This was April, before the uprising.",
        "A: Yes. And I got papers too, and I went \u2014 I rented somebody \u2014 my friend told me\nthat she\u2019s coming back to the ghetto because her husband \u2014 as a man you didn\u2019t have\na chance, because of circumcision. And I took over her room. And I was working in\nthe ghetto as a Christian this time. I could see my father, I had papers as a Christian.",
        "A: This was factory for Germany.",
        "A: Yeah, I was very gutsy. They were making \u2014 I \u2014 from lead or something. It was a\nshort time. I was coming in the morning, and leaving five o\u2019clock. This time I could\nal \u2014 I could always bring for my father some food, who was in a different\n[indecipherable] this time. My sister was already on the false paper hidden, you\nknow. And then it was Passover, the first Seder, Sunday night and I stayed, I wanted\nto be with my father. And he asked me stay there today, maybe it was Sunday night.\nI say okay, I will stay. And the next morning when I got up, it was Monday, I found\nout that the uprising was, but it was in different \u2014 it was 1n the part of the ghetto\nwhere my husband was. And I got dressed, I had the coat with the collar from a\nrabbit. Jews weren\u2019t allowed, so when I went to the false paper, I bought myself a\nrabbit and I put to my coat to look more like Christian. And I went to the guard and I\npassed the \u2014 it was a house ba \u2014 from \u2014 who had two entrances from the street. The\nOctober 8, 1993\nJews in towers were staying in the court and praying to God. It was quiet in this part\nof the ghetto because the uprising started there. And I went to the guard, I showed\nhim the papers. He said, what you are doing in the ghetto? I said [indecipherable]\ncaught me, and I decided I didn\u2019t have a choice, I had to stay. He looked at me, he\nlooked at the paper, and as I say, the number was [indecipherable] and he let me\nthrough. And near the guard were children six, seven years old, Jude, Jude, waiting\nfor the Jews to show them to the German. I had guts, and I walked in with my head\nup. And my sister, maybe one street from there she was waiting. She knew that to\nget out I had to come there. She knew that \u2014 she was sure that she will never see me.\nAnd I met her and I said, don\u2019t go in there, because it was the worst time. The\nPolacks were showing left and right, you know, and they could recognize me. No\nGermans stopped me in two and a half years. But the Polacks, who knew me from\nuniversity one, my husb \u2014 my father\u2019s work and \u2014 and luckily that I had money,\nbecause this man, my father gave him money, and whenever I needed. And there\nwas incident when I was living in the room, in the furnished room, there was a little\nboy, the first question he asked me, if I ever saw a Jew. So I said yes. Is this true that\nJew have a tail? I said, I don\u2019t think so, but I don\u2019t know. And when they started the\nuprising in ghetto, I \u2014 I knew that I have a father there and I had a husband \u2014\nhusband, not a husband, we weren\u2019t officially married, but I \u2014 I felt, you know. I\nOctober 8, 1993\nwent to the wall, and I was looking and next to me was standing a Christian woman\nand she said, very good that they burning the Jews, only they spoiling our Easter.\nThis was vox populi, it wasn\u2019t a single voice, everybody felt the same way. As I\nwas living in this furnished room, once is coming a woman and she said to me, may\nI see your papers? I said yes. What happened to the woman which was living here\nbefore, she was Jewish, are you Jewish, too? I said, I don\u2019t know if \u2014 I never met\nher, but I\u2019m not Jewish. She said, anyway, we\u2019ll go to Gestapo. She \u2014 it was after the\ncurfew. She was a Polish woman, but she was working for the Germans, and she \u2014\nwe're walking, it was quite a walk. We were walking, I said look, I can give you\nmoney, I have a watch, let me go. She said no, we\u2019re going. Suddenly she got\ntremendous pain, and we stopped near the pharmacy where she was ringing the bell,\nit was after the curfew. And the owner was living in the same building, opened the\ndoor for us, and we walked in and she said to him, if you will let her go, she is\nJewish, you will be killed too. You have to help me. And he gave her some\nmedication, I don\u2019t remember, and she continued to walk with me. We\u2019re maybe\nquarter of a mile from Gestapo, she said give me the money and give me the watch.\nI will [indecipherable] but I will not do anything to you. And I didn\u2019t move. I get\nout from this room and I didn\u2019t have a place where to go. I went to the hotel in a\nvery nice neighborhood in Warsaw, Marshal(ph) Kostka(ph) street. And the man\nOctober 8, 1993\nwho took my papers said, I am sure your papers are all right because Gestapo 1s\ncoming every night and checking the papers. I didn\u2019t have a choice. I said, my\npapers are okay. And I was sleeping there, nobody came. And I was looking through\nthe window, and I wanted to commit suicide. I had nothing to lose. And I said, if\nthey will find me, they will not know even who am I. But I was young, an-and I said\nno, you cannot give up. And the next morning I walked on the street, and I met my\nfriend, a Jewish woman who was working as a governess, French governess. She\nwas studying medicine in France and her French was perfect and we were very\nfriendly. She was working for a very nice family. She was taking care of two girls.\nAnd she said \u2014 I said, Marisha(ph), I don\u2019t have a place where to go. She said,\ntoday we\u2019re interviewing for my woman where I\u2019m working. She has a mother in a\nsmall town [indecipherable] and we\u2019re looking for a housekeeper. You come and I\nam going to interview, and you\u2019ll get the job. I went for the interview, you know, it\nwas like I \u2014 I am talking to you and I think I am lying. I-It\u2019s hard to believe. I went\nthere and this woman came to see me and then she said to her, you know what? She\nlooks a little bit Jewish. But she was a nice woman. She said oh no, you know, she\u2019s\nfrom a different town only. Because my papers were from a small town, from\nCzestochowa, and I went there.",
        "A: Stefania(ph) Dolinska(ph). I have the Kennekarta. And I was two years older\nfrom 1917, and the parents were illiterate, you know, I \u2014 I had to \u2014 to have a family.\nSo wherever I went I had an aunt, an uncle, you know, everything was fiction.",

And I was carry \u2014 wearing, of\ncourse, a big cross and all the things. And if you would wake me up during the\nnight, I could recite all the Catholic prayers by heart.",
        "A: I learned. I got the book and I \u2014 this was survival. And I went there and the \u2014 wa\n\u2014 one was deaf and one was blind. And I wasn\u2019t prepared to work, I was a Jewish\nprincess, I got the wrong education. And when I cook potatoes I didn\u2019t know that\nyou need water. So I felt the potatoes will give waters all when they started. When\nOctober 8, 1993\nshe walked in she said oh, Stefcha(ph) forgot to put \u2014 not enough water. So it\ndawned on me. They once were going to confession, so she said, let\u2019s hurry, because\nI was going to church with them. I said yes, only I will finish my breakfast. I forgot\nthat when you going to confession, you don\u2019t eat anything before. You know, they\nwere such a little things which \u2014 here I am coming from a family which wasn\u2019t\nassimilated one and here I am suddenly a Christian. The best place was ch-church.\nThen nobody was touching you, you know, you were pretending that you praying\nand you cover your eyes. But I-I was working. Like, I was washing the floors, I put\nsud on the floor and then you \u2014 you had to put clear water to remove the soap. So I\nwas swimming in the sud and I didn\u2019t know that you need clear water. And I was\nthere and it was rather good, you know. I \u2014 my sister, before I left, she dye my hair,\nyou know, blonde. And I couldn\u2019t become blonde somehow, I \u2014 I\u2019m very dark, now\nI color. And I was a reddish hair, but I was good looking and I had guts, you know,\nyeah, I \u2014 and my eyes were happy. And I was working there for a short time and\nthen I went to Warsaw. I \u2014 for \u2014 I was going for weekend, I \u2014 I said that I had \u2014 and\n[indecipherable] said, oh good that Stefcha(ph) because the [indecipherable] came\nand he is checking everybody\u2019s paper, so I said that you will come tonight. I say, oh\nI am so sorry. My aunt got very sick and I have to stay with [indecipherable] it was\nsplit of a second. I came only to get \u2014 I had a small suitcase, and a pillow you know,\nOctober 8, 1993\nI was carrying here like \u2014 because this was a \u2014 the servants were, pillow and a\nblanket, you know, you \u2014 you needed your own. She says, oh please tell him that\nwhen my aunt will get better, I will come back and I will go to him. And I\ndisappeared.",
        "A: No. I said that I am going, but I didn\u2019t. And \u2014 but I was going to communion, you\nknow, and I was whe \u2014",
        "A: And I went to Warsaw and I had a friend who was looking very Jewish. Her\nname was Roma, too. This is the same friend that when he came and he saw the\nname, you know, he thought this is a man, yeah. She was living with her mother.\nHer mother Jewish was atrocious \u2014 Polish was atrocious, so she pretended that she\nwas mute. However, my friend had very curly hair like black, like afro, so she\ncouldn\u2019t leave the house, so the mother was coming out and going, you know,\nshopping, pointing, you know, the \u2014 and the daughter was always home. So\nwhenever I was desperate, which was not fair to them, I was going to them for the\nnight when it was dark, and the janitor was the biggest enemy. Sneaking, and\nspending the night.\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: Roma Fleischman(ph). The mother was a wa \u2014 I was telling them when we\u2019re\nsitting there, the first train I will be sitting, and the mother said no, we\u2019ll stay here.\nAnd then, you know, I heard that there is a job on a farm, to milk the cows, to help\nwith the far \u2014 I was all used to farm like \u2014 now I would go, maybe as astronaut I\nwould be better. So I went there and there was a wife after a \u2014 a \u2014 a widow after a\njudge and a big farm. And she said to me, do you know how to milk the cow? I\nfigured, what\u2019s a \u2014 wha-what\u2019s so easy th \u2014 bi-big deal, you know? I was wearing\nsilk stockings, and my Polish was so good and my handwriting was so good. You\nknow, for a maid in Poland, who were mostly illiterate, but I told them that I was\nworking as a bookkeeper in this different city. So now I \u2014 since I moved, my parents\ndie, everybody, you know, to convenience. Sometimes they were alive, sometimes\nthey were dead. And she says okay, so milk this cow. I started to pull, kill me,\ncouldn\u2019t get a drop of milk and the flies were biting me through the stockings and\nthe cow was hitting me with the tail. And \u2014 and she looked at me, she said, you\ndon\u2019t look like a girl who knows \u2014 who was working on a farm. I am sorry, but I\ncannot keep you. I left again. In between there, there were jobs where I felt that this\nis not safe, that I have to leave, you know. So after two days I was leaving without,\nyou know, and I didn't \u2014 I had working papers, which were extremely important. By\nOctober 8, 1993\nthe way, I forgot to tell you, when I was going to get my Kennekarta(ph) with my\nbirth certificate, which I got to my hand \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: \u2014I got my false paper, I needed a Kennkarta, which was the official germ \u2014\nGerman document to live in occupied Poland. And when I went on the way there to\nthis German office where they were giving the Kennkarta with my picture, I had a\npicture with my nose like this, I\u2014 you will see the picture. And on the way there\nsomebody stole from me the \u2014 the \u2014 my pocketbook. And I didn\u2019t have the birth\ncertificate. And I called up this man, Mr. Rokulski(ph), he said, I cannot get \u2014 you\nhave to go to the Church of che \u2014 of Three Crosses, that was a big church in Poland,\nand ask for the birth certificate. I didn\u2019t have a choice, this was like \u2014 like going in a\n\u20141n a mousetrap and I went there and I ask and they gave me. I don\u2019t know if she\nwas alive or she was dead, you know\u201d? Could be if I would ask for death certificate,\nthey would give me too. So again I went and I got the Kennkarta which w \u2014 and a\narbeitskarta, work paper, which was extremely important because when the\nGermans were stopping me, when I had the arbeitkarta, this work karta, they let\nme loose. My dream was to get to Germany, to work in Germany as a Polish girl.\nHowever, you couldn\u2019t volunteer, because if they would see a woman like me\nOctober 8, 1993\nvolunteer, there was a priest who was specializing in recognizing Jews. He would\nsee right away that the woman, you know, with my Polish, is not voluntary to go to\nwork as a\u2014 in labor camp. So my only hope was to be caught by the German, and to\nsend to Germany. But because of my arbeitkarta, they never \u2014 I went to library,\nthe ju \u2014 Gestapo came to library. I showed them my paper, they let me loose. And \u2014",
        "A: I left the farm.",
        "A: Yeah, and I looked and I-I \u2014 I was at the end \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I looked in the paper.\nHowever, it \u2014 1t was \u2014 I went on \u2014 on another job where I was two days. And the\nman \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 the man was looking at me very suspicious. You know, you develop\na different sense, where is \u2014 wh-where you are not sure if \u2014 1f you will not be caught,\nyou know, yeah. And it was split of a second was deciding about your life. So I flew\ndown to that \u2014 near Warsaw was a summer place where they were before the war\nsending TB patients. Otwotski(ph), it was. And they are looking for people to \u2014\nchambermaids and other workers to change from that hotel to hospital for German\nsoldiers. So I went there.

        "A: Marie\u2019s family \u2014 Mary\u2019s family. Regina Mary. The priest knew that I am\nJewish, the nuns didn\u2019t know. I shared the room with a nun who was shaved like\n[indecipherable] you know. And since I am very curious, I was asking what made\nthem become a nun, so I\u2019m \u2014 different story was there. And they had some Jewish\nchildren there in this convent. The ones that \u2014 I was working on the f\u2014 that was\ngardening, and they were, you know, vegetables, things, all I \u2014 and going \u2014 four\no\u2019clock in the morning we\u2019re going to church.

And people are asking question what \u2014 I wasn\u2019t a\nnun, you know, I was in my normal thing. I said, so \u2014 but I have no place where to\ngo, so they sent me back. I ca \u2014 bought the paper, and it was my last job in Warsaw\nand they said in case they will need reference, I can give them their references,\nwhich was extremely important.\nOctober 8, 1993",
        "A: Yeah. After the three months, you know, in the country. And I started to work\nwith a woman who was a white Russian. She was Russian Orthodox. You know, ye\n\u2014 after the revolution in Russia, there were white Russian we \u2014 who went to Poland,\nto China, to all over the world. And he was a Volksdeutsche, again. He recognize\nme, but I was good for him and he was good for me, because he knew that is coming\nend of the war, and he had the uniform. Once, I took the uniform and I put on the\nbalcony, and I thought that he will kill me. He grabbed the uniform because he\ndidn\u2019t want any Polacks to know that he\u2019s a Volksdeutsche. You know,\nVolksdeutsche was a person who was born from German descent. Lempke(ph) was\nhis name. It was and it wasn\u2019t a German name, but it was convenient. He got the\nPolish villa in the country from a \u2014a-\u2014a Jewish villa, where Jews used to go, a\nbeautiful apartment and he awa \u2014 had a sewing \u2014 a salon, you know, where she had\nthe manager, and women sewing dresses made to order. Everything that they had\nwas from Jews, different monograms, you know. And th \u2014 he had girlfriend, because\nwhen the telephone was ringing, when I was picking up, nobody answered.\nHowever, when he was picking up, he was oh, how are you Mrs. this and this, you\nknow. And she was older than him, and she had the dog, a Pekinese dog who hated\nmy guts, the dog. I hated the dog, too. I was sleeping dressed up \u2014 dressed. I couldn't\nOctober 8, 1993\nget undressed because I felt 1n case somebody will come from the front door, I will\nbe able to run through the back door.

I, who doesn\u2019t have any \u2014 if you would hear me singing, like\nmy husband said, [indecipherable] this, I wasn\u2019t a main singer that, you know. And\nthen, once I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know how to cook, and she knew it that I don\u2019t know. Yeah, I\ncould \u2014 so she had the big party and she called a special wo \u2014 a woman who was a\ncook. And I was wearing a \u2014 whatever I was wearing, she was asking me where I\nwas buying. I said, oh, I bought this in a flea market. And she said, it looks like a \u2014\nfrom a rich Jewish woman. Those were my own things, few things that I had, the\nblack dress with a pin something. And I was wearing a black dress and a white a \u2014\nwhite, you know, apron, and I walked to the room and I saw a German sitting in the\nuniform among her guests. And I got so scared that I fell down, together with a tray,\nwith the food on the tray. She didn't kill me this time, was \u2014 once he threw the shoe\nin my head, this guy, that I didn\u2019t do a good job. And you know, we\u2019re picked\ntogether, this is not important. When we went \u2014 it was Easter, \u201944 \u2014 went to the\nsummer place. And this is a custom among Christian, that you share the egg, the\nhard \u2014 and you exchange wishes.

So\nshe looked at her and said, I think that after the war you will be working for her. I\ncan bet you she\u2019s a daughter of a rich indust \u2014 [indecipherable] and not watch only\nWarsaw. And then we went to church and he was watching every step if I didn\u2019t\nmany any mistake, but I was smarter than him. When to knee, when to cross, when\nto this, when to that. And then to get started the uprising, August first in Warsaw.\nThe Polish uprising, had nothing to do with Jewish. And the Germans \u2014 the Russians\nstopped on the outskirts of \u2014 Warsaw was divided by Vistula.

October 15, evacuate the whole Warsaw. Many Jews were killed who were\nkill \u2014 who were hidden. My friend from Australia was staying in the sewers with\nrats and mice and her legs when she came out were so swollen, because Warsaw\nwas totally flat now. We had one skyscraper, 14 floors, it went, I saw it. And they\nwere flying so low, the Germans, that we\u2019re hidden in the basement and part of the\nbasement was destroyed because Poland didn\u2019t have anything to defend.

I wasn\u2019t ready mentally\nto walk in and to see what \u2014 what\u2019s going on. And as I was staying, there were two,\nmaybe four young boy soldiers in German \u2014 in Russian uniform, you could see that\nthey were Jewish. And they say to me in Polish, you know, what are you doing\nOctober 8, 1993\nhere? I said, I used to live here. They said, we used to live here too, we are Jewish. I\nsaid, I am Jewish too. They \u2014 you know, they say, you survived? Because it was\ntypical what my husband, everybody who survive were sure that I was the only one\nwho survive and a few other people. But we didn\u2019t know, you know, there was none\nn-no \u2014 no network, nobody was \u2014 was bringing the news like years ago in United\nStates by horse, you know, was traveling.

Do you know this family, the other fam \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nknow anybody. And \u2014 and they said, and where are you staying? I said, I think,\nbecause it was a whole block, that this is Zamenhof [indecipherable]. And th-they\nsaid, describe to me how the house was looking. And I went to Jewish committee,\nwhich was on Praga, on the other side of Vistula river, and I register, and people\nstarted \u2014 nobody yet was coming from Russia, because later \u2014 nobody yet was\ncoming from concentration camp because it was later.

And\nthen after thinking over and between my husband and my son, you know, they said\nthat I\u2014I\u2014I-\u2014I should help people, you know. So I was working, when I got my\nMaster\u2019s degree in a state mental institution for 13 years, which wasn\u2019t that\nOctober 8, 1993\nrewarding because I couldn\u2019t do too much for them and you need some happy\nending. But I \u2014 even there, I was exposed to tremendous suffering, which to\ncompare to my, you know, those were people which were out, totally. They di \u2014 they\ndidn\u2019t know what \u2014 they were for 50 years in a mental institution. And then when it\ncame the time for psychotropic drugs, you know, they started to give them, and \u2014\nand then they started to discharge them to nursing home which were worse than hell.\nAnd it \u2014 through all those years I did lots of growing you know, between the war\nand between my work, you know, I became extremely \u2014 much more tolerant and \u2014\nand a much better person than I ever would be, even not all those things. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: Going back to my life during \u2014 starting August first, where it was uprising, Polish\nuprising in Warsaw. There was time where there was nothing to eat because\nWarsaw was surrounded by Germans, and on the wa \u2014 Vistula river by Russia\nthere was no food coming in. All the horses were eaten up. This reminds me on the\nrevolution in France when they were eating rats and mice. There was \u2014 this was\nArmia Ludowa and Armia Krajowa. This was one which was to the left and one\nwas to the right. The Armia Krajowa was very much against Jews. I was working\nthere as a clerical person for awhile \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nOctober 8, 1993\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: \u2014 Jewish, and I was working in the building there, who belongs to well know\nEmil Wedel, who was German descent, but he never declared himself as a German.\nThere was a \u2014 one of the best factory of chocolate which existed now, E. Wedel, w-\ne-d-e-I. And I \u2014 the people were \u2014 for whom I was working as a maid were \u2014 had the\napartment in the same building and the ones, the soldiers who were fighting, the\nPolish soldiers, not officially soldiers, but to defend Warsaw, they were cooking in\nour court, this was barley and some kasha, and they were \u2014 supposedly told me that\nit was a horse, but then we find out that it was a \u2014 a dog \u2014 a dachshund who belong\nto a well known Polish writer, Maria Rodzewiczkofna, very hard name to\npronounce, r-0-d-z-e-w-i-c-z-k-o-f-n-a. And then, the second time they caught some\nkids, I don\u2019t know where, because the uprising started August first and it was til\nOctober where the Polish people have to capitulate because the Germans by air were\nthrowing bombs and marching, occupying back the Warsaw which for a short time\nwas in Polish hands. And there it was a cat cooked together with all the ingredients.\nWhen J ate this I didn't know, I didn\u2019t get sick, but I was young, and actually it\ndidn\u2019t matter what I was eating.",
        "A: When I found out, yeah. But then it was written a book by somebody, by a Polish\nwriter and she mentioned this [indecipherable] dog. I don\u2019t know if the dog has a\nname. But anything that was alive those days was doomed to be killed for food. One\nof the \u2014 after the war, when we\u2019re \u2014 I was working with my husband in Lodz and I\nsaw Mrs. Lempke(ph). This was the woman which \u2014 where I was working on my\nlast job on a maid. She didn't see me, and I said to my husband, you should hit her a\nfew times. And my husband said, she is a head taller than me, how can I do it? And\nshe wasn\u2019t good to you, you survi \u2014 she wasn\u2019t bad to you, you survive. So why \u2014\nwhy do you want me to harm her? I cannot do anything, right? And this was the end.\nBut I had a strange feeling that always I would \u2014 I-I would never go back to Poland,\nnever, never. Now we\u2019re \u2014 financially we\u2019re okay, that is out of question, but I\nremember when we we\u2019re struggling, I always used to say, if anybody would put a\nmillion dollars under condition that we\u2019ll go to Poland to visit, I wouldn\u2019t go. I hate\neverything that they did for us. And I hated that in a normal country like Denmark,\neven French were \u2014 was a excellent underground, although they have their own\nGestapo, Maquis and in other countries you hear so many beautiful stories. And\nthat\u2019s true that the nuns helped me, and there were other Polacks, but it is such a\nsmall percentage. Well, a \u2014 mostly a \u2014 were \u2014 where we had th-three and a half\nmillion Jews living in Poland, well before Germans enter Warsaw, the Polish\nOctober 8, 1993\npeople already was beating us up. The \u2014 before the war, you know, the \u2014 there was\ntremendous hatred always. And I am sorry that I was born in Poland, not here. Joe?",
        "A: Do you want \u2014",
        "A: I tell you, I had a good childhood, and I was 20 years old in 1939, and looking\nback, you know, maybe I didn\u2019t know any better. However, when I think \u2014 when I\ngot my \u2014 graduated gymnasium, I thought that I would conquer the world. I had so\nmany dreams which were never fulfilled, and I didn\u2019t realize, maybe because I was\nstupid, or young, that so many things were off the limits for us Jews in Poland.\nThey were talking about engineers jokingly, that they are to measure the street. The\ndoctors, if they didn\u2019t marry the rich girl, he couldn\u2019t open the office. Lawyers, the\nbar were closed for Jewish lawyers, young one. A Jew couldn't be a janitor, a Jew\ncouldn\u2019t be a chimney cleaner. A Jew couldn\u2019t get a city job. And now living here\nfor 44 years and to see what the opportunities everybody can have, I am for sure\nreinforce that it was the wrong place of birth for us. And I see how people are\ncoming from different country, working in my capacity, what the help they getting,\nwhat the chances they have to be somebody, to develop, to educate. To compare to\nOctober 8, 1993\nPoland and being born and being Polish citizen and fighting the Polish wars, we\ncouldn\u2019t get any place. That\u2019s it. Whatever I will say more will be [indecipherable]",
