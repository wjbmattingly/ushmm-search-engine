        "3\nIt is a beautiful country. But Isaid, the Jewish community in my city,\nit was very small. But still we kept the holidays. We don't go every\nSaturday shul like we do here but we used to go Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashona,\nPesach, and Sukkoth. The most important holidays we were there.\nAnd the Sabbath, you kept the Sabbath?\nWe kept the Sabbath not in shul, though, in the house. My mother\n31 cook supper. 32. She would\nprepare everything from Friday. That's why, I still do that. Friday\nis the cooking and cleaning day. But Saturday is nothing.

        "5\nabout everything else. I would only read a lot, knit and crochet,\nsewing...these things I used to do and because this is things I can\ndo inthe house. My father didn't believe the girls to go work outside.\nOh really?\nYeah, they have to stay in the house, so these things I used to do.\nWhat about getting together with friends, did you do that?\nYes, a lot, a lot with friends, almost every day.\nOh, really?\nWe used to go to their house, they used to come to my home, we used\nto go walks outside. That's all, but not in parties and things like\nthat like here.\nNo?\nNo, no, not like that.\nWas this boys and girls or just girls?\nMixed.\nMixed.\nWe were mixed with friends of my brothers.\nDid you have friends who weren't Jewish?\nYes, I say that because there were not a lot of Jewish people there.\nRight, so...?\nTwo. Two Jewish girls and the others were gentiles.\nWhat was that like? Did you experience any anti-semitism as a child?\nNo, no, none at all. They were very friendly and very helpful and\neverything. No I didn't, that's true. I don't know the Greeks they\ndidn't show anti-semitism before the war. This happened after. This\nhappened after the war.\nSo you said you liked to play the mandolin (ph) 73 and you liked to read.\nWhat types of things, was it European literature in translation into\nGreek or was it Greek?\nGreek, Greek books. We had no library there.",
        "6\nClassical Greek authors?\nThat's right. Only Greek, nothing else because I didn't speak fluent\nany other language and I'm not interested to read something I wouldn't\nunderstand.\nBut it wasn't like a famous author translated into Greek?\nNo, we don't have any libraries over there to find the books we needed.\nSo, it was a very small town.\nThat's right.\nDid you, at that time did you travel in any other places in Greece,\nhad you been to other cities or anything?\nOnly Janina and one time in Athens. I told you my father, he was very\nstrict, what can I say, he didn't believe that the girls had to go far\naway from home. They had to stay home until they get married. But\nafter the war, I went everywhere you can imagine here. Being in this\ncountry, I had more freedom. I went to\nCalifornia, Hawaii, Israel, east and west Europe, even Birkenau and\nAuschwitz.\nWhat about your mother, you haven't talked much about, what was your\nmother like?\nMy mother comes froma big family, eight children, four boys and four\ngirls, and she was the oldest. So, she used to help my grandmother\nwork at home. She was a real housewife woman more than anything else.\nWas she educated?\nNot too much. You know those years, the woman they never had higher\neducation. If they finished elementary school, it was a big thing.\nBut she could read?\nOh, yes. Even my grandmother, she used to read. Though she had\ncataract in her eyes she used to read the small little romance books,\nsomething like that, to pass the time.\nSo your family comes from the Sephardic tradition?\nOh yes. [WE HAVE DISCOVERED SINCE THE INTERVIEW THAT",
        "THIS IS NOT SO]\nIs there anything specific that you would like to tell me about that\ntype of a life, were there observances that you did?\nWell everything what they should do for holidays, Rosh Hashonah, Yom",
        "\u20187\nKippur, Pesach, everything we did much better than here I can tell you.\nYou did have a synagogue in your town?\nYes, I did. One, but it was enough for the people there really.\nJanina had more synagogues because there were more people. But the\nholidays they kept very good. When Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur came you\nfeel the holiday, you felt that. Here you don't feel the Rosh Hashonah\ncoming because nobody around shows. Only when I go to synagogue, then\nI know is holiday. Even Shabbot now. I feel only when I go to shul.\nI realize that. Here, I don't see nothing.\nYeah, it's different.\nBut still, after my husband passed away, almost every Saturday I am\nthere.\nWell, it's important. Were there any Jewish youth organizations in\nGreece?\nJanina they had because there were more people over there but in\nPreveza, no.\nSo you weren't involved in any of that?\nThere were not too many people.\nDid you ever help your father in the store?\nWell, yeah, once in a while but only if they need extra help, that's\nwhy I went, but not too much because there were two. My second brother\nand him, they manage very good. I told you there was not big city and\nthe business is not so big so they didn't need extra help, but\nsometimes.\nWas this town, is it near the water?\nYeah.\nIt is?\nYes, swimming.\nSo you went to the seashore all the time.\nSwimming all the time.\nIn the Aegean Sea, which sea is this?\nIonian Sea. No, I don't--it's Sagul (c.) 107 is a gulf, Amuzakikos\nGulf, is a gulf it's not sea.",
        "8\nOkay.\nIs the Ionian Sea outside. But, this is a small gulf, Amozakikos Gulf.\nIs that walking distance then to your house?\nOh yes. All over the city is walking distance because it 1s so small.\nBut it was a very nice walk all through the city, you know.\nWas it mountainous in this area?\nNo, not too much.Janina has mountains. Janina has a lot of mountains.\nSnow and cold in the wintertime.\nOh really?\nOh yes. But Preveza, it has humidity rather then cold, anda lot of\nrain.\nSort of a Mediterranean climate?\nYeah.\nWhat did the buildings look like? Did they have red clay roofs?\nHow can I say these things? they put one on top of the other ones and\ntill...\nShingles?\nNo, not shingles. I don't know how to call them in English.\nThe clay, the red clay...\nYeah, like clay, one the top of the other they put like that.\nAnd were the buildings white usually?\nMost of them, most of them. You don't see dark like here. No, no,\nall paint.\nWhat about your house?\nMy house, white.\nWhite house. Did you have any pets?\nOne dog.\nYou did. What was your dog's name?\nMatzil.",
        "9\nMaztil? Hebrew?\nI don't know how we got this name, Matzil, but he was over there when\nthe Germans came to pick us up.\nSo, you left him.\nCouldn't take him with me, who can do that?\nMatzil in Hebrew means to save, lahateel(ph)125.\nReally?\nYeah, matzil is the word they use for a lifeguard in Hebrew.\nI didn't know that.\nSo, maybe it had something to do with that.\nI don't know. My father and my mother, they call him Mathile (ph)127,\nI didn't ask where they got this name.\nOkay. Now maybe, is there anything else you can remember about your\nchildhood that you could tell me, about your schooling? What about\nyour high school?\nMy high school was in my hometown, in Preveza. That is where I finished\nthe high school, there.\nSo, it was an academic program like a regular high school? It wasn't\na technical school?\nNo, no, it's a regular normal high school.\nLike a public high school?\nYes, but I think the public schools over there and the high schools\nespecially were higher than here. They had more subjects and subjects\nlike they have in first and second year of college.\nYeah, it's more intensive. Definitely. It was like a gymnasium, kind\nof?\nYeah, it was called a gymnasium over there. There, they don't call\nit high school.\nRight, so it was a gymnasium.\nYeah, but the last two classes, seventh and eighth, they had so hard\nsubject. Like I said, first or second year of college.",
        "10\nLike physics...?\nPhysics, and mathematics, algebra, geometry, and everything else.\nBut here I see nothing of that kind, no, only when you go to college.\nRight, they like to play in high school.\nThat's alright, that's all right.\nCarefree. So, before the Nazis came did you have any knowledge or had\nyou heard about the Nazis or anything that was going on in...\nWell, I thought they would be stuck over there in Germany and I didn't\nknow they were going to start dispersing all over Europe little by\nlittle. We heard about Polish people but they used to say that Polish\npeople they are a little harder to them. They didn't go along good.\nAnd the Polish they hate the Germans. So I said we are far away we\ndon't have nothing to do with them. But we didn't realize that one\nday they were going to come to us; they planned to come to Greece too.\nWe didn't realize that. And in the meantime, we didn't hear anything\nwhat happened over there. Everybody used to say, if they will take\nus to Germany, they are going to put us to work until the end of the\nwar and then we will come back. I sSaidalright, we'll go to work, fine,\nI don't care.\nSo that's what they told you?\nYes.\nSo, do you remember when the Germans invaded Greece and came to your\ntown?\nSure I remember that, my God!\nCould you tell me what it was like?\nHow can I explain when I saw the first soldier or the first officer\nwith this dress? We're scared to death because we know what happened\nto Poland and the other countries after that. I thought something\nwould happen to us too but it's nothing we could do. In the meantime\nthey obliged us, all the Jewish people, to go every day, every morning,\nin the police and give our presence to say we are here...to be ready\nto pick us up any time they wanted. You understand? So we didn't have\nany choice and we couldn't escape in the mountains because small\nmountains were close to the city. But we had all the people in the\nhouse, my grandmother, my father was not so well, and we couldn't leave\nthem and go the mountains. And they couldn't follow us over either.\nFor myself I could have a job in the mountains and teach Greek to the\nvillage girls but how could leave my family and go there? You\nunderstand? It was terrible situation for us and for my parents too\nbecause they couldn't move so easy. And 175 my father says what",
        "11\nhappens will happen to all of us. So we accept our fate, all of us.\nJust to be together, so we could help each other.\nWhen was this?\nThis was '43.\nWhat month? Was it in the winter?\nNo. I think it was the same time, March, something like that. And\none year later exactly, they pick us up.\nSo they had been occupying for a year?\nYes.\nWere your businesses open?\nYes.\nThey were and we were allowed to work.\nUntil the last moment, the last day.\nDid they beat you in the streets or anything like that?\nNo, no. I forgot to tell you. Six months before we had...six months\nbefore we had the Italian occupation. You remember we had the Italian\nwar then. When the Italians left, right away the Germans came. And\nthey started restrictions. No Jews allowed to go out at nighttime and\nwe had to wear the star of David in our arm. We don't have the right\nto go to movies. We don't have the right to go outside nighttime,\neverything like that. So I thought it was temporary. I said until\nwe will be free and they go we have to accept this life, we couldn't\ndo nothing else. In the meantime you couldn't talk to them, they had\nsuch a wild language nobody knew German to this time and you couldn't\ntalk to them. But really they were mean, very mean. I remember, the\nworst part, they brought prostitutes in my home.\nReally?\nYes. And my father and mother were so scared. Myself and my sister\nwent to a friend's house, a gentile, to sleep this night because they\ndidn't want us to be in the house.\nYou mean the Germans were sleeping in your homes?\nThey came in our homes yes, but this time...\nAnd then they brought prostitutes.",
        "12\nThat's right, they did sleep nighttimes but in my home they brought\nthe prostitutes for a night. But another house, they kept the whole\nhouse. They throw the people out and they stay in the house. Don't\nsay what happened then.\nSo you then couldn't imagine that they were going to deport you?\nNo! The only thing bothers me why we were obliged every day to go to\nthe police office and say that we are here. They know that we are not\ngoing anyplace, they knew that. See, the girls in this time and this\ncity they are not so free to do whatever they wanted todo. Their lives\nwere very closed. You had to go certain time and certain place. not\ntoo late, you know. With them, too different.\nWhen was it that they deported you?\n25th of March. I can't forget the day. 25th of March, 1944.\nThat was late in the war really.\nLate in the war? I think we were the last country occupied from the\nGermans. 213 We had so dark, we didn't know nothing what\nhappened outside from our home. It's unbelievable, that. I remember\nwe had a cousin in Athens who was more in touch with the situation that\nused to write to us. \"Our cousin is very sick, we pretend 216\nthat the situation 1S so good. We have to try to take him somewhere\nto get well.\" These people in Athens they escape in the mountains,\nthey hide with our friends and they were saved. But we couldn't do\nthat because in my hometown there were so few Greek, or Jewish people\nand the people... (the city) was so small, everybody knew us.\nWherever we go, they would recognize right away. But in Athens which\nwas bigger city you could hide. Nobody know if you are Jewish or\nGentile. In my hometown it was difficult to do that, that's why you\ncouldn't hide. But for me it was so easy to go to a small village and\nteach Greek. So be busy over there and go far away from home. But\nI couldn't do that, I couldn't leave my family.\nCan you tell me then what happened...when you were deported and where\nyou were taken and what happened then?\nYes. Itold you two, three o'clock in the morning, 1944, 25th of March,\nthey knock on our door. Right away, I said to myself, \"Oh, the\nGermans\". And I realized that because I heard the walking in the\nstreets, you know, the boots. I said to myself, the Germans. And in\nthe meantime, no lights in the house. The lights went out. The\nGermans start to scream to get ready and pick up whatever you can, and\ngo. No, we were so nervous. Can you imagine, from the sleep, sleep,\nwake like that. What can I take in the dark, no lights or nothing.\nSo we took whatever we could. The only thing my father and my brothers,\nthey took some money in case we need wherever we go. So, we went, they\ntook us right away downtown near the city, port. They had already the",
        "13\ncars over there already. One by one they put inthe car. That's all.\nAnd who couldn't get in the car because of his age, they had to push\nhim. So, they took us to 240 another city. We passed all the\ncities 241 to go to Athens. In every place we stop they pick\nup the Jews from there and they put in the cars. 243 they\nconcentrate all the Jews from these small cities and from Athens too,\nand from there they deport us to Birkenau.\nIn trains?\nIn trains, in trains, not passenger trains.\nSo you were all taken to Birkenau?\nYes. Were you together with your family at this time?\nOh, all of us.\nAnd how many days did it take to get to...\nIt was eight, nine days, I think.\nDid you have food?\nFood. They put us raisins, I remember. But we had some food with us.\nI don't know how, what. We kept 250 know nothing. And sleep it\nis out of question. One on the top of the other one. I was so happy\nwhen I arrive to Birkenau because I thought that at least we go\nsomeplace to wash ourselves, to take a little fresh air. Boy, what\na disappointment when we arrive over there. Just down in the pavement\nwhere the train stopped, there were German officers. And they start,\n\" Left, right, left, right, left, right\". We don't know what this\nmeant. We find out later what this means, \"left, right\". One is for\nconcentration camp, and the other is for crematorium. We didn't know\nthat. When we arrived over there, we find some Jews from Greece, from\nSalonica(ph)259, who went to Birkenau a year before us.\nOh, really?\nYeah. My husband was a year before me there. So, we ask them, what\nhappened to our parents, where they are? Oh, yes they say, they were\nso calm--forget about your parents, you look for yourself now. I\ncouldn't believe that. I couldn't believe but he said to me, you will\nbelieve, when you will see the crematorium. One hour later, the\nflames from the crematorium are already up.\nWhat happened to your brothers at this time. Were they selected to\nwork?\nYes, they put them to work, all three. They were young, they didn't\nkeep people over 45 and under thirteen or something like that. All\nof them under and over went to the crematorium but my brothers were",
        "14\nyoung and healthy and they could work. Look over here, thisway. This\none was eighteen, seventeen, I don't know how much he was. He was very\nstrong boy and the other ones too, so they put them to work. But they\nhad lousy job, that's why they went so fast. All of them, they worked\nin the crematorium. They put them there. And you know what the job\nwas in the crematorium.\nTo unload the bodies?\nNo. To put them in the flames, in the oven.\nOh, they went to the crematorium?\nThat's right, they worked over there and the whole job is to put the\npeople in the oven, put in the oven. After they kill them with the\nZyklonB. They take the bodies and put over there. They had another\ncommando, I can't remember the name, who took the gold teeth, who cut\nthe hair and things like that, and then they put them in the oven. It\nwas a terrible job to do that's why they couldn't stand a lot on the\njob, it was depressing. And my oldest brother, we used to have\ncorrespondence once in awhile when he find people who work in Birkenau\nthey used to send us sometimes packages from there and letters. And\nthey used to say we have everything here but the job we are doing is\nterrible. Here are nice people that he knew from Greece and he had\nto put them in the oven.\nWhat did you do? What was your job?\nI was 286. I change a hundred jobs, not only one. The first one\nwas dig ditches, make something like that. And I didn't know. I\ndidn't know how to touch the shower. And all my hands were bruised\n289 the German soldiers, they used to laugh because I didn't know to\ndo the job. After that they changed me, they put me to work in other\nthings, but not things that I can do as woman. Men's jobs. I worked\nalmost until November. I got the job from March until November.\nAfter that we transfer to Ravensbruck and Malhoff 295.\nOh, you went to Ravensbruck?\nRavensbruck and Malhoft 296. Two more, the last two months.\nOver there, they put me work nighttime. Make caps for pistols.\nOh really?\nAnd it was terrible job too because I couldn't keep my eyes open the\nwhole night. Iwas so terrified to hold that gun and things like that.\nAnd for what? to kill our people. That's it. That's..\nWhen you were going through all these camps and everything, were you\nwith other Greek Jews at the time?\nGirls. Yes, there was a bunch of girls with me, yes.",
        "15\nHow did you communicate with the other prisoners or did you communicate\nwith them at all? Because I assume--you knew French, right?\nYeah, but I didn't see any French people there. The only thing, you're\nnot going to believe. I met over there in Birkenau, one girl from\nPoland who didn't speak Greek, who didn't speak French, who didn't\nspeak nothing else besides Jewish and Polish which I don't know. First\ntime in my life I heard Jewish language over there. In Greece nobody\nspeak Jewish. Even the rabbi doesn't speak Jewish.\n[Yiddish]\nRight. It's an Ashkenazic language.\nThat's right. We didn't know that. But this girl, we attached\nbecause we had bought the shovel and not come into , (c.315), not\nat all, got friendly. I mean, to--a little bit together, that's all.\nWhen I came back all of a sudden, I saw her here in Whitelock (c.316)\nStreet with a child in her hands.\nIn America?\nYeah.\nReally?\nYeah. I didn't recognize inthe beginning. First of all after so many\nyears, everybody changed from 1945 'til '51, everybody changed. What\nis ?(c.319). I thought my God, this girl I know but I couldn't\nfind where I remember, from where. So I went to her and I said, excuse\nme do I know you? Were you in Birkenau?(c.322) Do you work in haus\ncommando camp? She says to me yes. I didn't know her name. I don't\neven that. She says tome andI sawthe number. It was much different\nthan mine because she was in camp from '39. She had the good life,\nvery early (c.325). So she said, yes I remember that. Did you work\nover there, yeah. Did you do this, yeah. Did you do that? Do you\nremember the Greek girl who couldn't talk? She says, no I don't.\nThat's all right. But since then, we're friends here.\nOh, good.\nWe see each other very often, really. She has two boys, the same age\nwith my girls.\nVery nice.\nBut we were--how we could communicate all this time together? nothing.\nThat's what I was wondering because I know this was a problem and it\nwas also a problem for a lot of the Italian Jews because they didn't\nknow any other language.",
        "16\nI didn't, I get in touch with Italians over there. It's so hard to\ncommunicate. You're not in the mood to communicate, nobody there.\nJust the Greeks who knew you and who go through the same way that you\ndo now. But the only thing is, we didn't have any touch with other\ngirls, nothing.\nWere there any incidents or episodes that happened while you were in\ncamp that stand out in your mind?\nYeah, yeah. Something I never can forget. I told youmy brothers were\nworking in the crematorium. And it was just across from my block where\nI lived, was the block of the ladies but the men were on other side.\nSo my brothers, I Knew they work over there and I wanted to go see them\none time. So they told me, you can do that something. Sunday, the\nblockova can help you to go one day when you don't work outside here.\nYou are free, you can go see them. So I went to the blockova who was\na Polish Jew. So I told her, listen, I said, I don't remember even\nthe name. I heard my brothers are there. I would like to give me\npermission on Sunday; it's a day that we have rest, right, have rest.\nOn Sunday, leave me one hour to go and see them. You know, what she\ndid? She slapped my face because I asked her that. Since then, I hate\nthe Polish people myself because they are so bad. She could do\nsomething, she could help me, right? But she didn't.\nShe was a Jew?\nShe was a Jew, Polish Jew. But she was really bad. She wanted to be\ngood with the Germans and she slapped my face. I was so mad, I was\ncrying. I said, what can I do. I know my brothers are just across\nand I can go and see them.\nHow did you ask her? Did you ask her in German, or---?",
        "I didn't know German. Nothing, just the way, you know. With the\nhands whatever I coulddo. Because I have somebody else fromthe camp,\nanother Greek girl. She saw her husband, was working with my brothers.\nI said, if she can go, why not me? I don't take off from the job today,\nI have to work. But Sunday is my day of rest. I could go over there\nand visit my brothers. She says no.",
        "Is there any other thing like that stand out that you had either\nwitnessed or happened to you?",
        "The revolution that happened at the crematorium?",
        "In Auschwitz?",
        "Birkenau.",
        "Birkenau? You were there during the revolution?",
        "Sure, it was a day that we had to go to work. This happened the two\nlast days of Succoth. The Germans--every time they wanted to do some",
        "17\nselections or bad thing, they find the holidays. So it was the last\ndays of Succoth and I know that because the Hungarian girls were very\nreligious people. I don't know how they went through, they passed\nbooks over at the crematorium, inthe camp. They used to read and pray\nwith the shovel in their hands. One had the shovel, the other had the\nbook. Every time they saw the Germans, they hide the book. You are\nfree and they took the book out and they read again. But this group\nwas very religious and every holiday, the camp, they show--they tell\nus that this is Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur, something--holiday, you\nknow. So we know that this was Succoth, the last days of Succoth where\nwe go to work again the same way like every day. Six o'clock to five\no'clock waiting outside for the appel, couple of hours rain or shine,\ncold or snow, never mind. After that, go outside from the camp with\nthe music. It was seven o'clock, eight o'clock when outside at work,\noutside we hear bullets going here and there, here and there. We\ndidn't know what happened. We thought the Americans or the Russians\ncame to liberate us. All of a sudden we heard this blochkova said,\nschnell (ph) (c.388), schnell in the block, schnell, schnell in the\nhouses, to go back again we come. We didn't know what happened. They\nrush us inside the block, they close the doors. Too quiet. In the\nmeantime, the bullets were going left and right, left and right. I\nsee the soldiers going around here and screaming but we didn't know\nwhat happened. Finally when they stopped we find what happened. The\nboys in the crematorium cause a cross-fires. They find out that they\nsupposed to be killed because the Germans, they knew, they did after\nfive, six months when the people work in the crematorium, they were\nSick and tired, you know, and disgusted. They can't do the job\nstraight the way they want. So they decide every five, six months,\nchange them. Kill them and replace with new ones. The Germans used\nto replace the people who worked in the Sunderkommando after five or\nSix months with new ones. So they knew that so they decide to do as\nmuch damage as they could because they knew they were dead anyway. The\norganization that they used to make over there that guard munitions,\nwith guns, whatever they could do to damage. So when the time come\nand they call them to go over there, they jumped on these guards that\nthey disarmed them and they took their arms. In the meantime, the\nGermans called for help.\nI'm just -------- papers. (c.411)\nThe Germans called for a--help. Four, five hundred people came again,\nGermans, to give help with them. So it was impossible for the Greeks\nto win. They knew that. So said at least they're going to die last\ntime free. They kill as much as they could but in the meantime the\ncrematorium was down and all the people who were over there--that's\nwhere my brothers were with it.\nAt the crematorium at the time? So were they part of the uprising,\ndo you know?\nYeah. Sure, they're there. But what a use. It was two, three\nhundred people who working over there in the crematorium. All of them",
        "18\nwent at the same time.\nWhich brothers were these?\nAll three.\nAll three?\nAll three were there.\nSo you know that they were all working at the crematorium?\nI knew because I told you, I find out... It was across the street,\nthe crematorium, across from my block. In the afternoon, we used to\neat outside. I used to see some one of them walking but it was not\nallowed to come close because of those electric wires. It wasn't\nallowed.\n!\nWhat were your food conditions in Birkenau?\nForget about that! Who thought of food? To get the soup in the\nmorning, you had to fight and wait hours.\nCan we stop for a minute, would that be okay?\nYeah, we can stop it. This is better.\nMrs. CaraSso iS going to read a written account that she wrote telling\nabout the story in the crematorium.\nIn the crematorium worked a group which was called sonderkommando where\njust after (c.439 the people died in the gas chamber, to cut their\nhair, extract the gold teeth and put them in the oven. Terrible work\nbut obliged to do it. Every five or six months, they killed them and\nreplace with a new group with the same luck. (c.444) September,\nlast days of Succoth, we got up as usual at 4 a.m. and waiting outside\nin line until 6 a.m. until it gets light and go to work. I forgot to\nmention that every day, going and coming back from work, we had music\nplaying for us. Also playing from prisoners.\nWhat kind of music?\nMusic--whole band, violin, cello, the whole band. Jewish people\nplaying.\nWas it classical music?\nDifferent things, different things. But Jewish people playing,\nthat's what's important, not Germans. That was an irony. Only that\nwe needed, the music. We went to work as usually, out of the camp.\nWe went and suddenly at 9 or 10 a.m., we heard bullets whizzing right\nand left and not too far fromus. Soldiers running here and there with",
        "19\ntheir dogs and guns, screaming and cursing. We didn't know what\nhappened. We start to laugh and cry and hope that the Allies were close\nand that was the reason of this turmoil. They called us to go back\nright away to the camp and they locked up in our block. We were ordered\nto be guiet. In the meantime, the bullets kept going left and right.\nThis turmoil continued for couple more hours. We stuck our nose with\nanxiety, in the window, and we were waiting with anger (?) (c.480) and\nimpatience to see some foreign soldiers, American or Russian to come\nthere and open our doors to freedom. But that we dreamed day and night.\nBut what disappointment. No Americans, no Russians showed up.\nInstead we had, it was a revolution inthe crematorium, The prisoners,\nsunderkommando, killed themselves but also they killed all of the\nGerman soldiers who happened to be there this time by blowing up the\nbuilding. They were there six months. They knew they would be killed\nin this place so they decide to take revenge and kill as many Germans\nas they could. And on this sunderkommando were working my three\nbrothers and this was their end. That's it.\nThank you for reading that. So this was in 1944, still? In Succoth,\n1944?\nThat's right.\nWhat happened after that? Now you were taken to Ravensbruck after\nthat?\nYeah. November, they took us to. November. I don't know. They\nemptied the camp but they took us into the Ravensbruck. Over there\nI had another job nighttime.\nThat's when you were filling the ----?\nPistols, pistols, yeah.\nNow in Auschwitz then, what did you do--?\nMy husband was in Auschwitz, not me. I was Birkenau.\nBirkenau, I'm sorry. That's right. What other job, you said you had\na job digging out in the ---?\nYeah, digging was in Birkenau.\nThe whole time, you were digging?\nThe whole time, digging. Different kinds, not only digging. They\nused to make just a bit hard--take piece of stones--move from one place\nto another. Or pieces of the grass, move from one place to another.\nJust to be busy, you know. That's the worst part of every job. But\nthe only thing we did and schnell, and schnell and schnell all the time.\nFast, fast, fast. We had so much strength this time to do fast job\nlike that but we had to, no choice. Not only--to Ravensbruck, they",
        "20\nput us to nighttime.\nAnd in the day?\nNo, nighttime.\nYou only worked at night?\nNighttime. Did you sleep in the day?\nNo, how we could sleep? They don't leave you quiet to sleep over there,\nmy God. Tocatcha little sleep, we're praying to leave us alone. But\nit was really a very hard job and we were very disappointed because\nGermans were really cruel to the Jewish people. You thought that they\nhad something personal with us. I told you my brother that used to\nsend me packages when I was in Birkenau only when transports came from\nthe other cities when they came to Auschwitz, they brought stuff with\nthem, colognes, dress things, food like we brought. So all of these\nthey gave to these people who working in the crematorium. The people,\nthey distribute between them--who had someone where to send in the\ncamps, they did, but who didn't have it, did nothing. So my brothers\nthey found a way to send one package sometimes. This was a big holiday\nfor us because we knew my brothers were alive. But after this happened\nfrom the crematorium, that's it. After the revolution in the camp,\nno packages, no news, nothing from them.\nIs there anything else from your time in the concentration camps that\nyou can tell me?\nAbout the revolution--the crematorium, I told you. What else?\nThen you were in Ravensbruck? and you were in one more?\nMalhov, Malhov. Yes.\nIs that a work camp?\nIt was a rest camp for sleeping the whole day. We didn't do nothing\nthere. All day we were in bed, believe it or not.\nDid you get sick at any of these times? Did you catch anything, typhus\nor anything?\nYes, yes. No, no. Just temporary. What are those, I don't know.\nOne day, it's unbelievable but you're going to laugh, I was in\nRavensbruck. My feet were swollen fromthe sun. My eyes were swollen\nhere too. They told me it's because I don't have enough vitamins. I\nSaid where am I going to get vitamins here? So they put me to the\nhospital for that. They didn't do nothing, they just let me lay in\nbed. I stay over there four days in the hospital. No special care,\njust relax at least. The last day, I'm supposed to return to my block,\nI dreamed of my mother, believe it ornot. This never happened before.",
        "21\nShe said to me, don't worry, everything will be all right, I'm with\nyou Don't worry, you'll be all right. Next day--I feel chills\nmyself, one thing--because I never dream my mother over that, never.\nBut this last day, she said don't worry, you'll be all right, you'll\nbe all right. I'mwith you. Next day they let me go to the camp again\nwith the other girls. We stay over there till the day--to this day,\n1944, we're supposed to transfer again. To Berlin, I don't know or\nwhere I don't know. So we got ready, we start to walk again, day and\nnight time. May, but it was real cold over there, believe it or not,\nand we walking for two days. We stopped just for a while to get a rest\nand walk again. Food, forget what had. All of a sudden, after two\ndays walking, the guards disappeared. We start to talk about how the\nGreeks were together, the only bit of--. Where we going now, where\nwe going, don't know nothing, where to go here? Nobody, nobody to tell\nus what to do. So we just got a group of a couple of girls together.\nWe start to see where the other people go, we go too. Because it was\nthe only way. So we went to--.\nCan I stop you, I want to flip the tape?\nYeah. No language, no thing. We're walking to find out where\nall the people go, we go too. So in the meantime I met some cousins\nfrom Janina. We got all together then--some boys not only girls. We\ndecide together to go here or there until we find a place. Finally\none agent came and tried to concentrate all the Greeks in one place\nand we went with him. They put us in hotel--ina school, not hotel--in\na school for one month. It was--I think it was this one--they put us\nin a school. And we have regular food over there and freedom to do\nor to go, wherever we want to go. I had a real terrific time then.\nThis is after the liberation then?\nYeah, after.\nWho--what month were you liberated?\nMay, 1945. In the street, I told you. We're walking.\nOh, you're just walking? I'm sorry, okay.\nWe're walking and the guards left us. That's why I didn't know what\nto do.\nI see, Okay, oKay.\nSo when we met our--these people from Greece, men and more girls, we\ngot all together, make a group and then decide to go all together to\none place. So they concentrate us in this school over there all\ntogether. We stayed till they collect all the people around, it was\nalmost five, six months, we stay there. Inthe meantime we had freedom\nto do everything we wanted to do. We went out nighttime. We went\ndaytime, we're free!",
        "22\nHow did you get money or anything? You were there--were there\nsocieties, aid societies, Joint?\nNot yet. Nobody reach us yet. But we managed somehow, I don't know\nhow we managed. The boys were more capable (c.631)\nWhere did the food come from then if it wasn't---?\nIn school they give us food, in school.\nSo you were at this school and they just took care of you? I see.\nRight, in school they gave us everything. Then the UNRRA, you heard\nthe UNRRA?, they contact us. The doctors examine us and they gave us\nvitamins because everybody was short of vitamins. I didn't have my\nperiod all this time myself because the Germans they used to put\nsomething in the soup.\nOh, really?\nYeah, we don't have any period. I didn't have any...\nThe whole time in the concentration camp?\nYes. No, no. That's why they tried to treat us. But everybody was\nanxious to go home this time. Nobody want to stay there. No matter,\nif we didn't find nothing with house. So we stay in this school and\nafter six months, September, they put us ina plane and send us back\nto Greece. Another disappointment, we're going back to Greece. No\none, no one from the Joint was in port to wait for us. Nobody was over\nthere. First night, be in Greece, myself, I slept on the pavements\nof the high school.\nReally?\nYeah. Nobody was there.\nWas anyone with you? All the people that were with you left and went\nback to try and find their families?\nEverybody had somebody who come to pick them up from the plane. I had\nnobody because I was not fromAthens myself. Iwas only with my sister,\nthat's all.\nThen you--when did you find your sister, ?(c.645)\nAfter the liberation, we were separated for a short time but we got\ntogether soon.\nOh, so she went through the camp? I didn't realize that, okay",
        "23\nYeah. Going from Birkenau to Ravensbruck, they put us in plain--in\nsmall cars, small cars. Not cars like this, cars with the wheels with\nno cover.\nCold, like the things--it was outdoors?\nYeah, no cover, no nothing. Just the cars. We stay over there SO\nwe're going front myself ina car and my sister was going in another\ncar, inthe back. Sowe didn't pay attention. Her car fell ina ditch\nand I didn't see it. We continue ourselves, continue, continue. All\nof a sudden, I remember, where is my sister? where is my sister? I said.\nNobody know because she stuck over there. I find my sister three\nmonths later--another surprise. All this time, I was crying, I was\nall the time with my sister and now the last time we're free, I lost\nher. I couldn't really say anything about that. So one day we were\na group outside to eat. All of a sudden one of the women come to me.\nI didn't even knowher. She came tome, says tome, she was from another\ncamp, from a village, a little farther from the barracks where we\nstationed ourselves. She says to me, do you have a sister? I start\nto cry. I say I know I have a sister but I don't know where she is.\nShe says to me, I know who she is. I didn't know this woman, never\nsaw her in my life. I said, how do you know she is my sister? She\nsays to me, you look alike. Believe it or not, we don't look alike,\nwith my sister. I don't know then but now we don't look alike. She\nsays to me, you look alike. I tell you where she is. She told me.\nI ask again. How do you know it's my sister? Your sister is in the\nnext village here. How can I go myself? DotI know. So when we came\nto this camp over there, were some people from Yugoslavia, Jewish\npeople, took care of the camp, Yugoslavian people. He took care of\nus, food, something to get dressed, things like that. This--his name\nwas Melumed, Melumed (ph) (c.670). I said, Melumed said--you're not\ngoing to believe that. Somebody told me--he know the story that I lost\nmy Sister this way--somebody told me that my sister is in this village.\nHow can I get there? He says to me, I just came from there, he says\nto me. How should I know? I didn't know them. So how can we go?\nhow can do that? He says to me, don't worry. I'll try to find a way.\nHe was the head of the camp. Next day, all of us saw him come with\nmy Sister. You don't believe how it felt when I saw her, at least I\nhad somebody.\nSo the two of you came back to this camp?\nYeah, came back together. Went to Amsterdam over there. We stayed\nin the school. I don't remember some still there. It's a city near\nBerlin. I don't remember that really. I have this story all written\nand I don't remember anything. Anyway, we got together with my sister\nSince then and we came back to Greece together in 1945.\nDid you find any relatives?\nI didn't find the most important, my family. Always, I hoped that some\none of my brothers escaped. Because they said someone escaped to",
        "24\nRussia. I said, maybe, it's one of my brothers, maybe. I was going\ndowntown and I was looking and looking here and there to see if I could\nfind one at least from my brothers ora familiar face. Maybe I'll find\nsome one of my family--nothing, nobody.\nTerrible.\nTo tell me.\nThen you stayed in Athens for a while? Is that how you met your\nhusband?\nYeah. (c.687). I need somebody to take care of me. Who's\ngoing to feed me? I don't have house, I don't have nothing nowadays.\nSo I start to work in the Joint Distribution Committee. Over there,\nI met my husband because he came three months later to work there too.\nI see. Do you want--we could--if you have a picture of your husband\nfrom around the war period, we can include him in this project also.\nIf you can tell me about his life.\nMy husband was not from Janina or Preveza. He was from Salonika.\nWould you know anything about what his childhood was 1ike or anything?\nThe only thing I have is his picture when he was in the army, if we\ncan find this picture. It was too old picture for him--he was in the\narmy then. Charles, his brother, was very active in sports; very\nactive in sports and my husband was a pharmacist.\nDid he work in America as a pharmacist?\nNo, he had to go to school and have the American degree. In the\nmeantime, I had the small child, three years old and I was pregnant.\nHe says to me, how can I go to school? Who's going to take care of\nyou? So better start to work. So he starts to work here.\nWhat was his occupation here?\nHe was working--you know how I did--at a doctor's hospital in Charles\nStreet. He was a pharmacist with no language. Every time the nurse\nused to go to the pharmacy and ask for medicine, my husband would say\nwrite, write. Because he didn't--couldn't understand what she\ntalked. She used to write the name of the medicine and give to him.\nBut after one year, he quit because the pay was not good. He had family\nto feed. And I couldn't work either myself because I had one child\nand pregnant, how can go to work? Soafterthat, he quit, aftera year.\nHe start to work at Read's Drugstore, two shifts a day to make the money\nhe needed. He didn't have nobody but the Joint really, he helped us\nin the beginning. When he saw that the salary went up, they gave less,\nyou Know. They used to give certain amount every week for the\nexpenses. Rent, I have to pay rent here. I have to pay for\neverything, right? Sothey give us certain amount. Every time he saw",
        "25\nit went up, they reduce the amount till he got free. He got only what\nhe needed. Finally he decided to make--to start a job, his own. He's\nnot going to work for somebody else. He succeeded really. He did\nvery good job.\nHe opened his own pharmacy?\nNo, how? He had to go to school to have the degree.\nSo what did he--?\nShip chandler. He worked with ships, with the Greek ships. He opened\nthe store. He got merchandise for the ships and the people from the\nships, they used to come in Baltimore. They used to go to the store\nand buy things and send back to Greece. He got this job and forgot\nthe pharmacy.\nI see.\nWhat for four years in college again to have the American degree? He\ndidn't know English either but somehow he managed his way. He did very\ngood but then everything has an end. That right?\nI suppose so. Is there anything else right now about your story that\nfor the sake of our tape and our interview that you haven't mentioned,\nthat you would like to mention? That you can think of?\nI don't remember. I don't think I have anything else.\nAny details that you left out, that you would like to---? Anything\nspecific again that stands our in your mind of a particular--either\nfrom your childhood or anything that happened during the war?\nI told you my childhood.\nRight. So nothing stands out, aside from the things that you've already\ntold me about?\nI don't recall anything that I left out. I think I said everything.\nThat's why I told you to read this one because here when I wrote this\none, I have more quiet, you know. I express myself much better when\nI am quiet. But I thought I mentioned everything.\nCould we go on and talk a little bit about your brothers here that you\nhave pictures of?\nYeah.\nWhich brother is this on the left?\nThis, Josef.",
        "26\nJoseph? What Jani?\nThe younger, the younger, was still in school.\nWhat can you tell me about his personality? What was he like?\nOy. He was full of life and so amusing, this boy, it's unbelievable.\nHe was full of life. He made everybody in the house laugh with his\njokes.\nSo he had a good sense of humor?\nA lot. A lot more than everyone of us.\nDid he do that in school also?\nYes. And a thousand friends.\nYeah, a lot of friends.\nYeah. My house, when the kids were home, my house was full of kids,\none going and coming, going and coming.\nWhat kind of--he went to the Alliance School or not?\nNo, no. Alliance was in Janina; was not in Preveza.\nHe just went to a public school in Preveza?\nYeah, the regular school.\nWhat--did he have a bar mitzvah?\nWe didn't have bar mitzvah over there.\nYou don't have?\nNot this time. In shul, they did something but that's it. Not big\nlike here. Nothing to compare with this country.\nI know, I realize that. But he could read Hebrew and ....\nYeah, he could read in school, Hebrew. Learned in school, I told you.\nHe went to a Jewish school?\nWell, the elementary school they have Hebrew too a little bit. A\nlittle bit, not toomuch. Ihadalittle more inAlliance myself. But\nin Preveza I had a little bit, not too much.\nWas it for only Jewish students or ---?",
        "277\nNo.....\nHe was in a Jewish school or was it a public school?\nNo, no, no. Alliance was a Jewish school. But this one was a public\nschool. But the rabbi from the shul used to take couple hours every\nweek and just teach them the basics of the Jewish language.\nHe tried to do there? (c.745)\nBecause there were very few boys over there.\nI see. So that's how they got a Jewish education?\nYeah, just alittle bit, not toomuch. Enough to know that he's Jewish.\nRight, right.\nBut in Alliance, we had regular hours for Hebrew, for French, and Greek.\nSo it was more rigorous?\nYeah. I was not in Janina at this time. Coming back to Preveza, no\nAlliance there.\nI see. So he grew up in Preveza?\nYeah.\nThe whole time?\nYeah, yeah.\nDid he go to Italy? Was he born yet when you were in Italy?\nI think he was born--he was one year old maybe, I don't know. He was\nvery small.\nDid he do any sports or anything?\nEverywhere. Sports is the boys' thing, you know. Everything.\nWhich sports in particular?\nBaseball.\nLike American baseball?\nWell, it seems to me it's like the American, yes. Baseball.\nDid he play soccer?",
        "28\nSoccer, yes, yes.\nSo he was friendly and outgoing and humorous?\nHe was the youngest in the house, you know that.\nSo when you were deported, then he worked in the crematorium?\nYeah, that's the luck. If he was working somewhere else, maybe he\ncould be saved. But no.\nHow about--which brother? This is Albert? Or this is Moise?\nNo, no, this is Moise. Albert is the other one, the small picture I\nshowed you.\nOkay, would you want to talk about Maurice for a few minutes?\nI told you Maurice I know so little because he left when he was nine\nyears old and he came when he was in school. He was like a stranger\nto us when he came back because he didn't know even Greek. He forgot\nhis language after so many years. But slowly, we got used to him and\nhe started to talk Greek better.\nWhat was he like? Was he serious? His personality?\nOh, he was very serious, this one. He was the--my father's strong hand\nover the house but we--he used to do a lot of things, helped anyway.\nHe lived--all the children lived in the same house?\nAll together, all together.\nSo he was--he's the one who worked in the ---?\nElectric company.\nRight. So like a bookkeeper kind of ---?\nWell, like an administrator because he did the whole thing over there.\nthat's right.\nNone of these brothers were married, is that right?\nNo, no. This is the reason I thought someone of those--someone, at\nleast one will be back. But nothing...\nWhat about Albert?\nAlbert, I told. He was finished the school, the elementary school in\nmy hometown. After that he went to help my father in the store because\nhe needed somebody.",
        "29\nSo he didn't go to gymnasium?\nNo. He didn't have any chance, this one.\nWhat was his personality like?\nVery serious boy, very serious boy. It's not like modern boys to run\nhere and there. He was very--family boy this one.\nOh, yeah. He liked to stay with the family?\nWell, he did.\nWas he protective of you and your sister?\nAll the time, all the time and all of them.\nBut you said that you had combined friends. Was this the brother that\nyou had the joint friends with, Albert?\nThese boys had friends their age. So I used to go excursions, daytime,\nfor example. From morning till afternoon. With them and their\nfriends too. My friends, too, together.\nSo you all went together? That's nice.\nYeah. Alone, we're not allowed to go alone.\nThat's right. Where would you go?\nSome small place we had near my city. Outside, very nice, like you\ngo for a picnic outside.\nDid you ride your bicycle there? Or how did you go?\nAre you kidding? Bicycle at this time? We're not allowed girls on\nbicycle.\nYou weren't allowed to bicycle?\nNo, no.\nVery strict upbringing.\nI told you. We're not allowed to go out by ourselves. Every time I\nwanted to go, just a walk outside--not a ride, to walk a little\noutside--someone had to be with me. Tell me!\nIt's another world.\nI wanted to go to movies, I have to go shop around. I can't go by myself",
        "30\nand the movies...\nEven with your friends, you couldn't just go--?\nNo, no. We had to have a male companion. They shop around too.\nThis is all your--did all the girls there have the--look like this\nfor all the girls?\nFrom this hometown, yes.\nI told you it was small city, that's why.\nIn Janina it was a little different. But my hometown, (c.799),\nI couldn't...\nIn Athens, it couldn't have been like this?\nOh, no. Are you kidding, not to go by yourself wherever you want to\ngo? No, Athens was not like that. But my hometown, I told you, it\nwas avery small town--Jewish people very low. They live together just\nlike that. You couldn't do anything because if you say something, the\nwhole city would talk next day.\nDo you know things about your family, like the--how long they've been\nin Greece? I mean, they're Sephardic, had they been there since the\nSpanish expulsion in 1492?\nMuch before the expulsion. They're born over there and raised in\nGreece and nothing else. They say...\n[PLEASE NOTE: AGAIN - WE HAVE DETERMINED TAT THE GANI FAMILY WERE OF\nROMANIOT DESCENT, WHICH IS THE GROUP WHO RESIDED IN GREECE AND THE\nBALKANS]\nMany generations?\nYeah, many. They say we come from Israel. But I don't see anything,\nI don't know where. My parents they didn't speak no other language\nexcept Greek.\nDo they know Hebrew?\nNo, nothing, no. But they kept the holidays.\nSo--but they were Sephardic, not .....Eskewazyes\nSephardic, 100%.\nSo they were probably from the Spanish expulsion?\nOnly my husband's family. My husband's family half Spanish. Because",
        "31\nhis family comes from Spain.\nRight. (c.818)\nMy husband's mother didn't know one word Greek, only Spanish.\nReally?\nYeah.\nOh, wow. Yeah, I guess in Salonika, they had a lot of ,,,,\nA lot. There were a lot of Jews over there and they kept the Spanish\nlanguage.\nLadino?\nLadino, yeah. Even the gentiles, they're obliged to learn Spanish\nbecause they couldn't work in Solanika. Because all the commerce was\nin Jewish hands. Except for that the Jews didn't work in Salonika on\nSaturday. The gentiles, they were obliged to stop work too because\nthey couldn't do anything.\nI didn't realize that.\nIt was really--it was Jewish, Jewish, Jewish city. Everywhere. How\nmany shuls they had over there? 10 - 15, I don't know exactly. How many\nshuls they had in Salonika? a lot. My husband, the first time went\nover there, he was crying to see how Salonika became ghost-ridden.\nSo you visited afterwards?\nOh, yes. Ivisited Israel five times. I went by the way in the eastern\nEurope one time because my husband and I wanted to say a prayer, a\nkaddish we say, to my parents. We don't have any grave here. So I\nsaid to my husband, one time we have to go to Birkenau because I know\nthere they died. So I went over there but believe me, we passed all\nthe eastern European countries. You couldn't talk to them, first of\nall, because the language is so different. But when I arrived to\nCracow in Poland and we're going closer to Birkenau, I start to cry\nmyself because I felt, I felt my parents are dead here and I don't know\nwhere. So I went to Birkenau and I took a little sand from that and\nI brought over here, just one time. Then I went to block where I was\nsleeping. I saw the bed, I showed my husband the bed where I was.\nStill the beds are there, still the blocks are there, everything, a\nlittle ruined now after so many years, but still they're there. Itold\nmy husband, you see this bed. I slept in the second floor, my sister\nand I and a couple of friends. In one bed were sleeping six girls,\nlike sardines. We couldn't turn from one side to another. And food,\nforget about that. A piece of bread with margarine and salami what\nthey have. I used to eat half at nighttime, half in the morning.\nBecause we didn't want to work with empty stomach. So many times, they",
        "32\nused to steal at nighttime, the other girls.\nReally?\nOh, yes. They were hungry, I don't blame them. But we had nothing\nmore than that. So when I show it to him, my block and where we slept\nand the life we had over there, he says to me now let's go to Auschwitz\nand I show my block. So we went after left Birkenau, was a half-hour\nwalking distance. Went to Auschwitz. First of all they show over\nthere the rooms where they have different things from the people who\nwere there. Suitcases, shoes, hair, these cans from Zyklon B and\nthings like that. Or they have different rooms and you visit and you\ncan see them. When finished all of that, then he says, let's go to\nmy place. He took me--this was more distant this place because it was\ntwo blocks--two (c.866) blocks. My husband says this was our\nfirst floor and this was my sleeping place. But it was like a house.\nMine was like a barn, you know. Different. They wanted to show to\nthat crowds and the Red Cross that they treated good, the Jewish. And\nhe was going to sports over there, play baseball and basketball,\nwhatever it is, with the other prisoners. They had more freedom there.\nWe were really prisoners in Birkenau.\nI guess it depends, you know, whenever he got there, the state of health\nthat he was in?\nNo, he was lucky because when they told us, when we were at Birkenau\nwhat profession we have. My husband says pharmacist. I didn't say\nnothing because I didn't have any profession. I was just in the school\nand then in the house, what profession I have? So just because of that,\nthey put him in the section where they kept the professionals, the\ndoctors and things like that. Going to Auschwitz, they put him over\nthere, to take care of the sick people. How they take care? No\nmedicine, no nothing, just with aspirins andwater. But the only thing\nis, he had a little freedom, more than I did. He was not scared of\nthis selections they used to make once in a while, but always the\nholidays, Peseach, Succoth, Rosh Hashonah, Yom Kippur, all the\nholidays. When we come back from work, they rush us in the block again\nand the blockaltester came to visit us. What's that, it's going to\nbe a selection. God, everybody tried to hide because even if you are\nstrong, if you have something, small thing in here or in your stomach\nor somewhere else, crematorium right away. So we were scared to death.\nThey used to wake up us, 11, 12 o'clock from the sleep to visit us.\nThe next day, midnight...\nSelection?\nThey took the numbers of the selected girls and the next day you see\nthis girl disappeared. One day was in the line for work, next day\nthey're not. You didn't know from one day to another what would\nhappen. Today you are alive, you work. Next day, maybe you're not.\nDepends how lucky you are.",
        "33\nTerrible.\nTell me. When I was liberated, I was 100 pounds, like that. I'mnot\nfat, I never was fat but I never was 100 pounds either. After the\nliberation, I told you they kept us to this hotel for three months,\ntwo months, I don't know how long. You know what we did the whole day.\nBFating and sleeping, eating and sleeping. We came back to Greece I\nwas just like that fat. I couldn't bend myself and tie my shoes, so\nfat Iwas. That'strue. But afterthat, slowly, slowly, I lostabit.\nNot because I kept any diet but I didn't eat like that and I move a\nlittle around. Over there, I was sleeping because I was so tired; I\nwanted so much to sleep. At work, I was looking, having my shovel in\nmy hands, I was looking. If nobody was looking, to lay a bit in the\ngrass and sleep, to find just a moment to rest. My friends and my\nSister used to say oh go in this corner and sleep. I'll take a look.\nIf somebody comes, I'll wake you up. This was something we used to\ndo for them. Go, lay inthis corner. I'll take a look. If somebody\ncomes, I will wake you up again. We were so dead for sleeping, so dead.\nAnd going to block to relax, you know, in the block were 100 kinds of\ngirls over there Different nationalities, different education,\ndifferent background. They start to fight. We want to go to sleep\nand relax, they start to fight. They fight in their languages. I\ndidn't know what they say, what they did but the only thing fight and\nscream.\nWhen you came to Athens, what did your sister--? You met your husband\nthen at the Joint? Did you come to America at the same time with your\nSister?\nNo, I came six months before my sister.\nShe got married in Greece also?\nNo, she married here, after me. I was married in Greece but she was\nyounger, I told you. She married here.\nBut she managed to come to America too?\nYeah.\nDid she live with you then when ---?\nNo, they send her to Chicago.\nOh.\nShe lived one year in Chicago. She went to school all this year and\nafter that, the Joint--because the Joint helped her send to school over\nthere--she quit. She came to New York and she start to work over there.\nDid she try to come to the same city? You had come to Baltimore?",
        "34",
        "I didn't know where to go because they asked me if I had relatives here\nto help me, to go to America. I said, I didn't want to say I had\nrelatives because I didn't want to bother them to help me. I said I'm\nold enough, I'll go over there. I can work and do my--make my life.\nI don't like to bother nobody. So I said I have nobody. So they had\nopening; was open here in Baltimore so they send us here. I said after\nall, I have some friends in New York but I didn't like to bother anybody.\nI said New York and Baltimore, they aren't far away. If I have",
        "(c.918), I'll govisit them. But I didn't go. I didn't say that\nI have relatives in New York, I didn't want to say that. So they send\nme here. I said, fine. Here, I don't care. Stranger keeps you\nsending you there, it'll be a new place. But I'm glad. My husband,\nthough, all the time, he didn't like Baltimore when he came here.\nWhy not?\nBecause we're the first Greek who came to Baltimore, the first one.\nWe don't have nobody. The gentile Greeks lived but far away and\ndifferent. With somebody in our own religion, you kKnow,... So he\nsays to me all right, let's see what we're going to do. We'll try to\ngo to New York because we have our people. We tried, one year we tried,\nnext year we tried. The other year we tried. In the meantime, we're\nused to this life now here. Also more people came from Greece here.\nThere are other Greeks?\nYeah, they came. First they moved around. One moving to California,\nanother one moving Cleveland, another one moving New\nYork so they go here andthere. But inthe first time, we're completely\nalone, it was good to have them here. Now, there are two, three\nfamilies here.\nImmediately after the war when you were recuperating at this place when\nyou were sleeping and eating, what was going --?\nWhere, where?\nIn Germany. What was going through your mind? Did you think about\nwhat happened or did you just not, try not?\nI was thinking of going back home and find my family. That's what I\nhoping, find somebody from my family. I was really disappointed when\nI didn't see nobody.\nWere you able to get any reparations from the ---?\nYes, again we got, after a while, not this time when I need it really.\nAfter a while, I made application German consulate and they give us.\nEvery month I get something. But the first time when I need it, they\ndidn't have nothing.\nWell, I want to thank youvery much. If there's nothing else that you'd",
        "35\nlike to add, we can turn off the tape.\nJust ask me something. I don't remember if I have any thing written\nover here. I told you, I told you about... This is my story, you know\nthat. You read that, didn't you?\nYes.\nOkay. Of course, this one too.",
