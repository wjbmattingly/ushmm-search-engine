        "Q: Tell us about your ghetto.",
        "A: We come in a special place that was in the city. They tell the people that they was living in\ncity in Kolki, they give them one hour time....the German SS, to get...together, 1t was\ntogether with the police, their...the...the people...1t was the German people. They tell them\nwhat...what to do. And they give them one hour, but you must to come in this place. \"If you\nwill not come for one hour, you will...you will be...uh...shoot where we will find you.\u201d That\nwas everybody from this time, for one hour, you must be...to be every person want to live.\nYou don't need nothing this time, only to come...to come, to stay in life.

Kolki, it was a city...uh...most of them that's in it was approximately, I don't\nknow exactly, Jewish people, it was by 7...by 7,000 people Jewish. In city, it was in city...nu,\nI think 70, 80 percent Jewish people, and rest of them, it was Ukraine. Most of them\nUkraine, and a little Polish people because.... And it begin this life in ghetto. We didn't got\nwhat to eat. They...they take us to work, the father and me and the sister, what we can\nnobody in the beginning when we came to ghetto, they take us to work and they give us, nu,\n100 gram bread. 100 Gram that's, nu, ...a quarter...a quarter pound bread for a day. Then after\nthat, it was maybe other couple of weeks, then they stopped with this. Find what you eat.\nWhat...what...find by yourself what you can eat. No...and it was what was begin...how\npeople can go out from the ghetto. We find to change our clothes to give away for a piece\nbread. For example...uh....a suit what is cost a lot of money, and you go out from the ghetto,\nyou just for 100 grams or quarter pound bread, you give the suit. You know, to eat, you don't\nneed in this time. And the...in the ghetto, it was very terrible. First of all, the U.S...they said\nevery Jewish must be make a yellow piece of...uh...1t's called...uh...",
        "Q: Star. Did you mean the star?",
        "A: Yes. It was a round one...one yellow colored in front, and in back. I said that we didn't got\nwhat to eat, but they took us to any hard jobs. Besides that what they beat us. Beside that,\nwhat they did...German did...the German...the SS, they came, it was two German what they\nstayed always. I remember their names. Their name 1s...uh...Bartz and Georg. The two\nGermans. One 1s..., I know I remember itt, like a Sonderfiihrer it's called in English...uh...in\nGerman, and the other's like a [police commisarov (ph)|. And the police commisar was a\nUkraine. His name is Suchkowski. These people was doing in the ghetto what they want. I\nbegin to tell you. They come sometimes, nu, when they have a good drink, they come in\nghetto and...uh...begin to shoot...shoot somebody where...who comes on them. Because we\ngot the yellow things...the yellow...know...things on the front and the back. Everything what\nthey want...nobody was responsible for a Jewish man; what you can kill...a German...a\npoliceman he can kill without any words than...easier than animal to kill. Nu, that was\nbeginning to part of the winter time we live in the ghetto, and its begin...maybe that was in\nFebruary. February, they put us--all the wintertime--they put us to very, very hard work. In\nspringtime they take us to work, and...1t was a big...uh...farm. Was Germans, and they take\nus all...all to German farm. I was working in the farm and my father was working in the\nfarm, and sometimes the mother came if they didn't take her in another church, in the same to\nwork in the...in the farm. To explain to you everything how...how it was, in the farm we was\nworking. Nu, I was born in a village. I know all the jobs in the farm. We was working very\nhard. From...from the morning to...to the night they beat us. They...they doing what...what\nthey wanted. If you work, uh....Georg or the German from SS called Bartz, they got, nu,\nsticks, rubber sticks. You can never say some...uh...words, he comes and hit you. You don't\nknow for what, and what because you work, no food. Know it was in this time some good\npeople, Ukraine, what they came to... Ukraine people, and they came to help us. Not all the\npeople was...was bad. Nu, let me...1f I say Ukraine, which I don't mean, what Ukraine...all\nUkraine, between Ukraine people it was nice people, what they ... what 1t was good people.\nThey help us. Know a lot of people got...a lot of people got afraid for them, but if a Ukraine\nman will come to ghetto and bring some food, the same people, Ukraine people, the\npoliceman will kill him. Will kill! Is become a time what the people, one people got afraid\nfrom the other...from the other...Ukraine people. I don't think what we got...the most friend\nwe got because the policeman kill...kill us anytime. And the same with...with German, the\nGermans. You know, the Germans I mean...the fascism, the SS, Germans. We was...in this\ntime we was working, one time that begin that's 1942. One day I walked with my father in an\nevening time 1n the end of the day. They pick up us and put in a place..., nu, it's like a store,\nlike a store room from bricks. It was they take us maybe... uh ...forty-five people...maybe\nforty people, they locked out...locked up us in this place and we don't know what happened.\nWe was a night together with the people in the warehouse and we don't know what...we was\nthinking what it will be happening to us. Was they going to kill us? In the morning, they take\nout us from the...from the warehouse, and they brought us to the ghetto. When we came to\nthe ghetto, we don't see no people. Nobody's in the ghetto. What...what happened, they\nmaked the first pogrom. They maked it. You know what, it's hard to tell you the dates\nbecause in this time...uh...we didn't know the date. We didn't know the months. It\nhappened....what they need us...for what reason they put us in the...in the warehouse, they\nneed workers to...to take all the stuff what in ghetto it was. First of all, they came the SS and\nthe policemans. They came the first, they take everything. The small stuff what is have in the\nhouse they have everything. They begin to use us to take from...take everything. They put\nthis in wagons and to work for them and to bring them in special places where they took. I\ndidn't say before...before the pogrom in this night what they locked up and they brought\npolicemans from all...from other cities to...1n this place to make the pogrom. I came in my\nhouse where I was living with my father and we came...I begin...I came in the first in the\nhouse and I was looking around. I think maybe I will find my mother and my sister...\n(crying) One second.... I didn't find. Not the mother. Not the sister. We find a lot of people\nwhat was killed, but they didn't take them and they probably killed them and all the people\nthey take on the trucks, and they put them...that was...uh...they make holes in the ground and\nthey shot them in a special...in a special places. It was in a forest. It's maybe from the ghetto,\nit was 5, 6 miles, not more. And they take...they tell us, the people what they shoot to put\nthem in bundles and to bury them, all the people. Nu, you can't understand how we can feel\nin that time like this what they killed my mother. They killed my sister; and I'm with the\nfather, we staying alive. Now. We know very well what it will be the end. It will be come for\nus, because now we understand they need us what to do this job. That's why they left us.\nNow tomorrow or after tomorrow, it will be the same to come to us. How it was...everything\nthey take you know from the houses. We cried. We doing... It's terrible time. He--the\npoliceman stayed and the SS man--they brought a lot of SS people and they stay and watch\nfor us what they need to work. They finished..., nu,...then they finished what they got. They\ngot...they give us again...a couple of houses, and they tell us, \"You will live in this house,\"\nbecause they kill all the people and it was left a lot empty...empty houses. You know what?\nWe come...we come with my father...we come more people. In a couple of days, it's come\nmore people. One problem I can...I want to tell. A lot of people ask questions. Nu, why\npeople come again to the ghetto? The time is what...1t was so bad if you jumped for example\nfrom the truck or you jumped or you run away from the Germans, the time it was...the\nUkraine police and a lot of people anti-Semitism was they catch you and they kill you by\ntheir self or they take you to the Germans. The Germans for each...for each Jewish people,\nthe German was giving a pack cigarette or..or a piece bread or a...or a 100 gram sugar, so\nthat what...the problem it was that the people what they left from the pogrom, what they run\naway some...it was lucky people. Nu, it was. And what happened? In a couple of days,\npeople come back. It's come woman, men, some children...what they can walk, they can run.\nNu, it was come...no, it's beginning they did...all the people, they come back. Oh, three\nhundred maybe people, they come around for...for...and we stay in this...the Germans what\nthey was doing in this time, they said, \"Who left in life, come back. We will not touch you.\nYou will work, and that's it.\u201d\u201d, You know, it was a lie, what you cannot...you cannot believe in\nthat. No? In that situation like that, you cannot stay not in forest. You cannot stay not in\nvillage. You cannot stay in the ghetto. You must to come again because you want to eat.\nEverybody was thinking, \"Ah, ...maybe here...maybe we'll leave or we'll not leave.\u201d Nu, the\nanswer...they came. Maybe it was a mistake. In this time what they want to say you want to\nmove, and this time it was no partisans. Nobody in the forest what can help the people, the\nJewish people, but we stay...what we came in the forest. We stay...maybe it was one months\nmore, and its begin the second pogrom. Second come...the second pogrom happened\nwhen...uh...I want to say you how I find out what it will be something. In this time when it\nwas the war...uh...with Poland, some people, Polish people, come...uh...run away from\nPoland and come to the...uh...Russian...to stay Russian because the German comes to take\nPoland, he kill, begin to kill in Poland people. Some people was smart people, and they run\naway. They don't want to be...uh..by the Germans, and they came to Russia. I met with a\ncouple of people. It was two brothers in a city...1t was [Julebiersk (ph)], and that was...the\nGermans saved them, and the same time they take us to work, they save what is the two\nbrothers because they was making gold stuff for them. You know, how it come the stuff? I\nwill tell you this stuff how come to the Germans. The SS comes...it was...uh...1n ghetto. It\nwas called in this time a Judenrat. They come and they said, \"We need 5 pounds,\" for\nexample, 5 pounds. I don't know how much...5 pounds, 3 pounds. \"We need gold. If you will\nnot give the gold, tomorrow you will be shot. All of the Jewish people.\u201d From the Judenrat,\nthe people comes to the people in the city, of that's how I begin to explain how from where\nits come the gold. And take...you have a spoon of gold or you have a batch of gold, you\nbegin to give that. And that's...what that's the SS, they got the gold and they make every...any\nstuff. Before its comes the second pogrom, one night they came, the SS, came to the two\nbrothers and they said, \"Give all the stuff.\u201d This was the stuff...1t was not finished. And they\nsaid, \"We don't want to wait. Give everything.\u201d Then I meet in [IInick (ph)] and they\ntake...he tell me, the brother, too, \"You know what. It will be something happen because if\nthey take all the stuff, the gold. It must be something, they think something to do for, to us.\u201d\nAnd this time I saved my father. \"You know what? We will not go in the place where we\nstay at nighttime to sleep. We'll go in the farm.\u201d And we said to some people, to other people\nwho believed...who didn't believe. Some believed and they came, and some friends and it\nwas, nu, where they keep the cow, they keep the horses...they keep everything. And we\nstayed the night in this place in the farm. In morning, nu.,...it's come the sun...come up and\nbring here it's quiet. We don't hear nothing, what from German ... the policeman. We was\nthinking...I was thinking in the...with my father together and I tell my father, \"You know\nwhat? I think it...1t's quiet. We don't hear nothing.\u201d\u201d We come out from the...you know, it was\nhay. We come out, I and the father, and they stay...the policemen and Germans. Nu, excuse\nme, for the [\"\"Verfluchtene Juden, Raus!\"]. That mean, \"Come out.\u201d Now they take us and\nthey begin to look around. They find more people, and they begin to beat us. My father... uh\n..was speaking very well...uh...German, I told you before. He begin to talk to him. He don't\nwant to talk, and again the same words...bad words, good words and hit him and hit me and\nhit other people. And they take us all...how many people they find. They find maybe in the\nfarm, it was, nu, maybe 30, 40 people, and they take us in the ghetto, back in the same place\nwhere it was before, and they take us in...in the houses. We come to the houses. Houses stay\na lot of police, Ukraine police and a lot of SS. People from the...all, they take and this time\nthe second pogrom...maybe it was 500, 600 people they came back.

I went first with the...with\nthe guys and...and I was...they put me it was with my back side I was in the...how it's called,\n\"bort\" [Russ: side] in the truck, and the left side, the back side and left. Believe me, and I\nwill never forget this...this time when they...when I come on the truck and it was a couple of\npeople to...near to me. They was dead. They didn't kill them. They was dead, but they...uh ...,\nnu, from...from the pressure, more from the pressure. It was dead what take the person he\ncannot walk after this. Nu, it was older people. I was this time a child and I was strong. They\nput us....you need to...the feet all in this position to straight the feet and the other one must\nbe...sit on your feet. And it was like that, all of them. In...in front it was a couple SS and\nUkraine police. Maybe it was all the people on the truck, the police and the SS, nu, 5 persons\nor 6 persons.

I jumped and I began to run from this\nplace. Nu, and it was...uh...in this time it was... again, I want to say it was good people and it\nwas bad people. The bad people they cried on this...and the good people they cried and the\nbad people they was happy to see, to see the anti-Semitism what the German and the\npoliceman they killed Jewish people. The next...uh...jump peopled stayed and begin to..to\nshow. They, you have in Ukraine what's called \"Zhid,\"_ dirty word for Jewish...uh ...Jewish\npeople what we have in many languages. Nu, in this time the...the police and the German SS\ncome and this way after the truck and come and begin to shot after me to kill me. I'm lucky.\nHow it's happened, I don't know. They didn't kill me. And I come that's...,nu, any...in this\ntime, I want to tell you...in this time it was a couple more, not very...maybe 5 persons what\nthey was begin to run, young, and he decided. Most of them was...they killed the people on\nthe truck. When I run from...when I come 1n a...it was called in English, a barn. I come to a\nbarn and I come...it was a pig inside. I jumped to come on the top. In the top it was straw.\nStraw, yes? Straw, and I...you know what, it's in seconds because if you will do slowly with\nthat, in a second you will be killed. I come and I put...1n the straw, and I don't know a lot of\nwords how its come...in the straw and I put on me, straw to cover my...my...myself, and it's\nafter maybe, nu,...not more than 2 minutes. Not more. Comes I hear...when I stay in the top\non the straw and the...it was standing near the hiding where they take the...the people, the\nJewish people, in the truck, and it was near but I hear everything and I hear what the...how\nthey shot.

Know and I don't know what is happening with me. I feel my nose is bothered me\nand what is blood, and in this time if you can run or you can do something, you don't care\nabout this. Then in a couple of minutes, he...the police, in comes the owner from the...from\nthe barn, and the policeman said in Ukrainian, [\"Sudeya Zhid zabir.\u201d (ph)| That means \"a\nJew comes in your...came in your barn from the truck.\u201d He begin to come...the policeman\ncomes...they come | or 2...I don't know how many it was and comes in the...on steps and\ncomes to watch me in the top.

In a couple minutes when he left, comes the owner in the...from the barn and his wife\nor children...I don't know the truth, and he begun...begin to talk to them. And he don't know\nwhat I'm in this same barn I'm up there and I hear this everything. He begin to..to explain to\nthem what is happened. What they kill everybody, what not far away the place where they\nkilled them. It's terrible...a terrible place. And then he say, \"I need to take mine horse in my\nbarn because the German tell me, ...the police, to come to take--the highway what they killed\nthe people--to take them and to bring them to the...to the place where they kill them.\u201d In a\ncouple a minutes ago, ...nu, it's taken...I don't know, maybe a hour or a half hour...I don't\nknow exactly time, he comes back and he says what, \"I put dead people and I take them to\nthe place where they kill all of them.\u201d And I hear, next day I hear how they...the guns...how\nthey kill them. And I remember the...the mens they took on the trucks and children and\nwoman, they...a lot of police and they...they go with...by themselves on foots they walk.\nHow long I will live, how long, I will never forgot the voice when they went...and it was the\nbarn stay very close by the highway what they went.

I cannot help nothing. Because if I\nwill go out they will kill me, that's it. And you...you must be with that and to stay. It's\nfinished...they kill; and I hear everything, how they shot everything. It become evening. Nu,\nwhat to do? I was thinking what to do. I cannot stay here. And if I...I need to eat. I need to\ncome out. I cannot stay. What to do in future? My...uh...village. I was decided to go in my\nvillage because I know a lot of people. I know good people. I know bad people. And I know\nthe...the place where I can walk in the forest, nu, and maybe...maybe I will...I will be in life. I\ndon't know how long. I don't know.

The owner, he locked out from the other side. I\ncannot...I cannot come out, and I cannot make noises because 1f some noise I know what\nsomebody will be here. In this time, the barns was covered with straw, not like...uh ...you\nknow in America or other places, but we got some covers...uh...metal or what. I break\nthe...the straw on the top. I take...I take...I find....how it's called? ...1t's metal. Its in the end\nsharp metal, what you take hay, I took from them. And I come from the top very quiet and I\nbegan to run. I come over the road, what they take the people into the forest. When I come to\nthe forest, I tell you honestly maybe each my step after 2, 3 step I fell down. I got like...I was\nlooking for somebody like stay the SS, stay the police, what they hear, in this time. Okay. I\ncame..., nu, 1t was maybe three quarters kilometers until what I run to the forest.

        "A: Okay.\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Let's go back to the forest. The tape is on. You're in the forest. Tell us about that.",
        "A: When I came to the forest and I decided what I need to go only in mine village, it was in this\ntime middle of the night. And I know what... the time goes, and I need to go until it will\nbegin to be day. I need to come...it was a river still, a big river and I need to come over the\nriver.

        "Q: Pitch fork.",
        "A: Yes. I come to the first house and I knock in the window. At nighttime, and I tell them. That\nwas my big mistake. My big mistake, but later I was thinking \"What...what I'm dong? I'm by\nmyself and I knock on a...at night time in a door and I don't know. Maybe it's a police house.\nMaybe...maybe whose somebody what can kill me.\u201d Nu, it's done. Nu, it's...I'm lucky. The\nfinish is good. Comes a lady to the window and begin not...not with something wrong. She\nbegin to me to talk very polite. \"Please, I'm by myself. I cannot go with night time.

        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, what I know him before. That...that... I came to my village, village\nKomarovo. I begin to ask him who is in forest. \"Maybe you know somebody's in forest.\nMaybe Jewish people, more.\u201d He tells me things like this; but he didn't see him, no. Uh...he\nsay, what I know, and he did not know, but Srulek Feierman from my...from the same\nvillage, he comes before...maybe before one month, he cames...he...he run away from the\nfirst pogrom. He run away, and he's now in the forest. Nu, where he is? He said, \"I don't\nknow.\u201d No, he told me, the name from the forest name and ...I know very well the places and\nthe...he gave me a piece bread. He gave me to eat. Nu? And I left because 1f somebody will\ncatch me in his home, he will be killed and I will be killed. I went from his home and I come\nin the big...big forest. Big forest. The first night no food I got. I didn't go to some...to... to\nhouses to ask for eat or what. And I came in the forest and the first night...that's...that's mean\nthe second night, first night I was...when I left from the...from the barn. I cannot find a place\nfor me. I cannot sleep. I cannot eat. I cannot...nothing....,nu, ...1n forest and the same I never\nby myself in forest to sleep. It was nu,...unusual. Unusual. Nu, the first night, the second\nnight, the third night, the days that I walked around.... I cried. I don't stop to cry, to... and no\nclothes on me when I run from the truck. It was a short and pants on me. Nothing...nothing\nmore. Nu, maybe the third day or the fourth day, I don't remember exactly, I began to come\nto people what they live...live in forest. They got people...a lot people, they got houses in\nforest. And I...I know very well the people. Very well. Nu, I was thinking I will choose to\nthis man, I can come to him. Nu, I choose...he's a nice man. He was a nice man. Nu, it was\nright I came to people...to this man and I was asking, \"Maybe you know him. Was somebody\nin the forest.\u201d He say...what he is the second Srulek. His name is Srulek like mine name,\nonly my name is Menyuk and he's Feierman. Nu, where he 1s in forest, I cannot tell him\nbecause he don't say. He comes to...to...have a piece bread or what to eat something, and he\ngo away. In this time I...I went to the forest again, and I...by myself I was maybe 2 weeks or\n3 weeks...I don't remember exactly. And then one day I was going and I see a man go...goes\nin forest. Know...you know what...he afraid...he from one side afraid...and the second side I\nwas happy--maybe...maybe that's he. I decided to go to him, and the same thing and we see\nhe knows me and I knows him. And we meet together. Nu, he was older than I am. He was\nmaybe 8 years or 10 years older from me. I was younger. He was..., nu, and that was\nbeginning a life two people. That was 1942 that was...and we begin...",
        "Q: Who is this man?",
        "A: This man...he was to mine...a Jewish man from the same... uh...village Komarovo, and he run\naway from the first pogrom, but it was a month ago from Kolki ghetto. Nu, when we met\nwith him, I know him and he knows me; and that's...know, two of us. It's a little easier. He\nbegin to explain how he run away. I tell him how I run away. Nu, what...what we can do. We\ncannot do nothing. We begin to talk with people...uh... with Ukraine people. If some people\nmore, what you know. No more Jewish people, and nobody in forest that you can... No, we\nbegin build life with him, two of us. We didn't got what to eat. We didn't got what to drink,\neat. It was war and what you can. We come in the gardens, we find something there. We can\nstole, and we did. I say that what it was. To some people, we came. Some people give us...,\nnu, in the beginning it was a little bit easier for somebody. And then, nu, after a couple of\nmonths, they told if somebody will give food or will not say...uh...to the Germans, the SS,\nwhat it's come the Jewish people, they will be killed...the Ukraine. Nobody want to give you\nsome food. That's...that was the worse time in the _____ but a couple...couple people, very\ngood people, what they help us. They help us with food. They help us with news to tell us\nwhat is going on. We was thinking, nu, that somebody was saying us that German take\nMoscow...uh...that's...that's and if German will stay that is our life comes to end. Nu, we can\nhold couple of months in that. One man, it was very excellent, very good person. He was...he\nwas like in this time, he was like a father to us. Behind food, one time he...he saved us. How\nhe saved us, I'll tell you. It was no..in...uh...when its become cold time, somebody...the police\nfrom the ghetto...somebody tell them what two Jewish people go around this in this village,\nKomarovo. They came maybe...uh...20, 30 or 40 person..., nu, ...police, to catch us, to kill us.\nNow, you can understand how deep it was the antisemitism in this time. Was for two people-\n-they know what two people--they take a lot of police to come us to kill us. When we came\nto this guy at nighttime, Ukraine man, Ukrainer, and he tell us you know what's truth. Don't\ngo these...these days. Don't go in this place where we always we come to people to beg\nsomething to eat or do something. Don't go this place. Why? He said it was people was\ntalking...1t was...uh...you know the place where people comes...uh...to pray in...uh...a village.\nIt's a [circle] we say...it's a [circle] and its...and people began to talk what it's going this day.\nIt was Sunday. It's come a lot of police and they will kill what they two people...the two\nJewish people what they're going in forest. When he tell us what that's no...that's...they\ndecide what he cannot go more in this place. We didn't come in this place maybe...maybe a\nmonth...month, and then after a month what's in forest, you need to come and there to beg a\npiece bread and to eat something. When they see us, \"Eh! You know what, we didn't believe\nwhat you will be alive,\" and they begin to tell us. What every...every night 1t was maybe it\nwas 3 nights or 4 nights two, three policeman in each house was waiting for us, what we will\ncome in the house. I don't know how lucky we in, until now I don't say, to thank the person\nwhat he told us...told us. What he didn't told us, we will...we will come, probably we will\ncome to this place, and we will be killed. After then, nu, 1t come wintertime. What to do\nwintertime? Wintertime we cannot go. And in this same time, nu, and I want to...excuse\nme...everything was...uh... How it's called? Lice. On us, it was lice. What I tell you, it's un...\nunbelievable. Unbelievable! When you come in the house for one second, if it's warm you\ncannot stay. Everything our...all the skin, all everything, it was in blood. Everything! And\nhungry. Nu, and its come...it come wintertime. What we can do? We begin to talk between\nus, and we make in forest...in the top, we make..., nu, it's called in Russia \"Shalash.\u201d [Russ:\na hut made of branches] Nu, it was cold, become first...first frozen, and we cannot stay\nthere and we cannot sleep, nothing. Then we decided, \"Let me make a hole in the ground,\"\nand it begin...we begin to build the hole in the ground. We cannot leave the hole what some\npeople can see. We build a hole and we take the ground. We take maybe, you know, for a\nhalf mile because if somebody will see fresh ground, thats mean for somebody...somebody is\ndoing something in...in forest. It's getting...somebody will come and to watch. We put this in\nwater. We put this in places so nobody can think for this, and we make the hole. We covered\nthe hole, and you go...we go in and ...uh...we covered the hole with some leaves...leaves or\nit's called, you know, like... like... piece like that, we take to cover the hole but nobody. It\nwas better. Than in the top on the ground was better. Nu, we got again problems. The\nproblems is when it snowed and you come out and you left...you go in snow, you can see\nwhat somebody people goes in there. So if anybody came somebody find. We stay maybe 2\ndays, 3 days, we stayed. It's a lot of snow and people doesn't go. We stayed. We don't come\nout from the hole. We eat snow. We make from snow...we make water. It's terrible water, to\ndrink from snow the water. Food, I don't say food...food we got. We always we\nkeep...uh...some flour, make with water and eat...eat that's food. It's...we eat what...I cannot\ndescribe what we eat. Everything, what it's... what we can find. Raw potatoes or any...any\nfood. Nu, we..the wintertime it was very hard when we stayed in this time. At nighttime we\ngoes...we go, nu, to wait anywhere to eat and we come in...uh...places and you cannot go\nwith...with the highways or the ways you go always straight and you come to water,\nwintertime. You passed a lot of water. You come wet. You cannot make a fire. The...we\nmake fires maybe like people...uh..thousand years ago make the fire. You...you never, nu,\n...maybe see how...how it's a stone and a piece metal and you hit this and it comes...know I\ndon't want to...that's not...know we make...nu, at nighttime you cannot make the fire because\nyou can see from far away the fires is the night we run away then its come a daytime\nmorning, then we make a fire in forest and we stayed....we take off the clothes and I cannot\nsay what's it's clothes. No, it's junk, or in other words. Nu, and we dry up and there again we\nneed to think what to do again. 1942, after that's the wintertime, we began to talk to come to\nhouses they say what it's comes what we have in the forest people. What people, they don't\nknow. Nu, they comes with...uh...with weapons. They come the same. They ask for bread.\nWho is that? We don't know. Nu, they said it can be partisans, Russian partisans. In this time\nwhen it become the war prisoners, Russian war prisoners, run away from the...from\nthem...from the Germans. And they come in forest, and they become not in the same\ntime...uh... Russian prisoners and the same time, they...1t was come the Ukraine...uh...people\nwhat they was, nu, with the \"Nationalisten.\u201d Nu, they was thinking what they\nwant...uh...undependant [i.e., independent] Ukraine...undependant. It was differents kinds. It\nwas one people they want...undependant. The other one want... dependant from Germany.\nNu, the names...different groups... different groups. They call in this time, Banderovtsy,\n[Minekovtsy (ph)], Bulbovtsy.\u2019 That means the who was the boss, their boss. And the ideas\nwas differents. What they did...what some Ukraine people...what they want undependant\nUkraine....undependant. Nu, in other one to be undependant to Germany. Nu, not to Russia.\nNu, all of them...1f these people...they was anti-Semitism in the idea, their idea. They don't\nwant other nationalities. They want only to be only Ukraine must be lived in Ukraine. It was\nvery close with fascism. Very close. They killed...the same they killed Jewish people, they\nkilled other nationality people. I want to show you example. It was in the same... when we\nwas in forest. And this time it was in Komarovo, in this village 1t was a Polish family, it was\nthe father and a daughter. They come at night and they kill them. For what? What they\nPolish people, and they killed them. In this time, we got afraid to come to these same...to\nthese same Ukraine people to be...and we was right looking for the Russian partisan. Russian\npartisan, and it was very hard. It was a couple...then people saw them. Nu, it's hard to come\n' After Stepan Bandera, Ukrainian nationalist leader who lead a group under the standard\n\"Semastina Ukraina\" (Trans: \"Independent Ukraine\").\n* After Taras Bulba, a 19th century Cossack leader.\nto the.... One time that was..., nu, I cannot tell you the date or the month. Nu, they came to\nPolish people and this time what that's very...very interesting. German...the SS, fascism,\nmake a political edict. They put the Polish people again[st] the Ukraine, the Ukraine\nagain[st] Poland...uh...again[st] Polish people, and each other begin to kill. Ukraine people\ncomes to the Polish villages and kill the...the Polish. The Polish, when they have...uh...when\nthey can...they have...they can come to the Ukraine, they do the same. Nu, 1n this place it was\nfrom ... not far away from our village, 1t was a Polish small village, very small. Now the\nUkraine was much more than Polish people. Then we decided with...oh, I missed one thing\nmore. You know what, uh...the time is going past, a lot of...of episodes... it's a lot...a lot of\nepisodes. I cannot explain all the episodes. Nu, the most important I...I forgot to tell you.\nWhen we was in forest, we...uh...find people and they said what these guys...what he's with\nme...he's... his sister's husband? is the next...he was in next village, in [Kulikovich (ph)] . You\nfind good people and they...they tell him, they went to the other village and they told him\nwhat we said to come to us. And 1n wintertime...it was in wintertime, we find him. We find\nhim, and he comes. His foot, it was frozen at all. He didn't got nothing, only everything in\nthe blood. He cannot walk at all.

No...and it was what was begin...how\npeople can go out from the ghetto. We find to change our clothes to give away for a piece\nbread. For example...uh....a suit what is cost a lot of money, and you go out from the ghetto,\nyou just for 100 grams or quarter pound bread, you give the suit. You know, to eat, you don't\nneed in this time. And the...in the ghetto, it was very terrible. First of all, the U.S...they said\nevery Jewish must be make a yellow piece of...uh...1t's called...uh...",
        "A: Yes. It was a round one...one yellow colored in front, and in back. I said that we didn't got\nwhat to eat, but they took us to any hard jobs. Besides that what they beat us. Beside that,\nwhat they did...German did...the German...the SS, they came, it was two German what they\nstayed always. I remember their names. Their name 1s...uh...Bartz and Georg. The two\nGermans. One 1s..., I know I remember itt, like a Sonderfiihrer it's called in English...uh...in\nGerman, and the other's like a [police commisarov (ph)|. And the police commisar was a\nUkraine. His name is Suchkowski. These people was doing in the ghetto what they want. I\nbegin to tell you. They come sometimes, nu, when they have a good drink, they come in\nghetto and...uh...begin to shoot...shoot somebody where...who comes on them. Because we\ngot the yellow things...the yellow...know...things on the front and the back. Everything what\nthey want...nobody was responsible for a Jewish man; what you can kill...a German...a\npoliceman he can kill without any words than...easier than animal to kill. Nu, that was\nbeginning to part of the winter time we live in the ghetto, and its begin...maybe that was in\nFebruary. February, they put us--all the wintertime--they put us to very, very hard work. In\nspringtime they take us to work, and...1t was a big...uh...farm. Was Germans, and they take\nus all...all to German farm. I was working in the farm and my father was working in the\nfarm, and sometimes the mother came if they didn't take her in another church, in the same to\nwork in the...in the farm. To explain to you everything how...how it was, in the farm we was\nworking. Nu, I was born in a village. I know all the jobs in the farm. We was working very\nhard. From...from the morning to...to the night they beat us. They...they doing what...what\nthey wanted. If you work, uh....Georg or the German from SS called Bartz, they got, nu,\nsticks, rubber sticks. You can never say some...uh...words, he comes and hit you. You don't\nknow for what, and what because you work, no food. Know it was in this time some good\npeople, Ukraine, what they came to... Ukraine people, and they came to help us. Not all the\npeople was...was bad. Nu, let me...1f I say Ukraine, which I don't mean, what Ukraine...all\nUkraine, between Ukraine people it was nice people, what they ... what 1t was good people.\nThey help us. Know a lot of people got...a lot of people got afraid for them, but if a Ukraine\nman will come to ghetto and bring some food, the same people, Ukraine people, the\npoliceman will kill him. Will kill! Is become a time what the people, one people got afraid\nfrom the other...from the other...Ukraine people. I don't think what we got...the most friend\nwe got because the policeman kill...kill us anytime. And the same with...with German, the\nGermans. You know, the Germans I mean...the fascism, the SS, Germans. We was...in this\ntime we was working, one time that begin that's 1942. One day I walked with my father in an\nevening time 1n the end of the day. They pick up us and put in a place..., nu, it's like a store,\nlike a store room from bricks. It was they take us maybe... uh ...forty-five people...maybe\nforty people, they locked out...locked up us in this place and we don't know what happened.\nWe was a night together with the people in the warehouse and we don't know what...we was\nthinking what it will be happening to us. Was they going to kill us? In the morning, they take\nout us from the...from the warehouse, and they brought us to the ghetto. When we came to\nthe ghetto, we don't see no people. Nobody's in the ghetto. What...what happened, they\nmaked the first pogrom. They maked it. You know what, it's hard to tell you the dates\nbecause in this time...uh...we didn't know the date. We didn't know the months. It\nhappened....what they need us...for what reason they put us in the...in the warehouse, they\nneed workers to...to take all the stuff what in ghetto it was. First of all, they came the SS and\nthe policemans. They came the first, they take everything. The small stuff what is have in the\nhouse they have everything. They begin to use us to take from...take everything. They put\nthis in wagons and to work for them and to bring them in special places where they took. I\ndidn't say before...before the pogrom in this night what they locked up and they brought\npolicemans from all...from other cities to...1n this place to make the pogrom. I came in my\nhouse where I was living with my father and we came...I begin...I came in the first in the\nhouse and I was looking around. I think maybe I will find my mother and my sister...\n(crying) One second.... I didn't find. Not the mother. Not the sister. We find a lot of people\nwhat was killed, but they didn't take them and they probably killed them and all the people\nthey take on the trucks, and they put them...that was...uh...they make holes in the ground and\nthey shot them in a special...in a special places. It was in a forest. It's maybe from the ghetto,\nit was 5, 6 miles, not more. And they take...they tell us, the people what they shoot to put\nthem in bundles and to bury them, all the people. Nu, you can't understand how we can feel\nin that time like this what they killed my mother. They killed my sister; and I'm with the\nfather, we staying alive. Now. We know very well what it will be the end. It will be come for\nus, because now we understand they need us what to do this job. That's why they left us.\nNow tomorrow or after tomorrow, it will be the same to come to us. How it was...everything\nthey take you know from the houses. We cried. We doing... It's terrible time. He--the\npoliceman stayed and the SS man--they brought a lot of SS people and they stay and watch\nfor us what they need to work. They finished..., nu,...then they finished what they got. They\ngot...they give us again...a couple of houses, and they tell us, \"You will live in this house,\"\nbecause they kill all the people and it was left a lot empty...empty houses. You know what?\nWe come...we come with my father...we come more people. In a couple of days, it's come\nmore people. One problem I can...I want to tell. A lot of people ask questions. Nu, why\npeople come again to the ghetto? The time is what...1t was so bad if you jumped for example\nfrom the truck or you jumped or you run away from the Germans, the time it was...the\nUkraine police and a lot of people anti-Semitism was they catch you and they kill you by\ntheir self or they take you to the Germans. The Germans for each...for each Jewish people,\nthe German was giving a pack cigarette or..or a piece bread or a...or a 100 gram sugar, so\nthat what...the problem it was that the people what they left from the pogrom, what they run\naway some...it was lucky people. Nu, it was. And what happened? In a couple of days,\npeople come back. It's come woman, men, some children...what they can walk, they can run.\nNu, it was come...no, it's beginning they did...all the people, they come back. Oh, three\nhundred maybe people, they come around for...for...and we stay in this...the Germans what\nthey was doing in this time, they said, \"Who left in life, come back. We will not touch you.\nYou will work, and that's it.\u201d\u201d, You know, it was a lie, what you cannot...you cannot believe in\nthat. No? In that situation like that, you cannot stay not in forest. You cannot stay not in\nvillage. You cannot stay in the ghetto. You must to come again because you want to eat.\nEverybody was thinking, \"Ah, ...maybe here...maybe we'll leave or we'll not leave.\u201d Nu, the\nanswer...they came. Maybe it was a mistake. In this time what they want to say you want to\nmove, and this time it was no partisans. Nobody in the forest what can help the people, the\nJewish people, but we stay...what we came in the forest. We stay...maybe it was one months\nmore, and its begin the second pogrom. Second come...the second pogrom happened\nwhen...uh...I want to say you how I find out what it will be something. In this time when it\nwas the war...uh...with Poland, some people, Polish people, come...uh...run away from\nPoland and come to the...uh...Russian...to stay Russian because the German comes to take\nPoland, he kill, begin to kill in Poland people. Some people was smart people, and they run\naway. They don't want to be...uh..by the Germans, and they came to Russia. I met with a\ncouple of people. It was two brothers in a city...1t was [Julebiersk (ph)], and that was...the\nGermans saved them, and the same time they take us to work, they save what is the two\nbrothers because they was making gold stuff for them. You know, how it come the stuff? I\nwill tell you this stuff how come to the Germans. The SS comes...it was...uh...1n ghetto. It\nwas called in this time a Judenrat. They come and they said, \"We need 5 pounds,\" for\nexample, 5 pounds. I don't know how much...5 pounds, 3 pounds. \"We need gold. If you will\nnot give the gold, tomorrow you will be shot. All of the Jewish people.\u201d From the Judenrat,\nthe people comes to the people in the city, of that's how I begin to explain how from where\nits come the gold. And take...you have a spoon of gold or you have a batch of gold, you\nbegin to give that. And that's...what that's the SS, they got the gold and they make every...any\nstuff. Before its comes the second pogrom, one night they came, the SS, came to the two\nbrothers and they said, \"Give all the stuff.\u201d This was the stuff...1t was not finished. And they\nsaid, \"We don't want to wait. Give everything.\u201d Then I meet in [IInick (ph)] and they\ntake...he tell me, the brother, too, \"You know what. It will be something happen because if\nthey take all the stuff, the gold. It must be something, they think something to do for, to us.\u201d\nAnd this time I saved my father. \"You know what? We will not go in the place where we\nstay at nighttime to sleep. We'll go in the farm.\u201d And we said to some people, to other people\nwho believed...who didn't believe. Some believed and they came, and some friends and it\nwas, nu, where they keep the cow, they keep the horses...they keep everything. And we\nstayed the night in this place in the farm. In morning, nu.,...it's come the sun...come up and\nbring here it's quiet. We don't hear nothing, what from German ... the policeman. We was\nthinking...I was thinking in the...with my father together and I tell my father, \"You know\nwhat? I think it...1t's quiet. We don't hear nothing.\u201d\u201d We come out from the...you know, it was\nhay. We come out, I and the father, and they stay...the policemen and Germans. Nu, excuse\nme, for the [\"\"Verfluchtene Juden, Raus!\"]. That mean, \"Come out.\u201d Now they take us and\nthey begin to look around. They find more people, and they begin to beat us. My father... uh\n..was speaking very well...uh...German, I told you before. He begin to talk to him. He don't\nwant to talk, and again the same words...bad words, good words and hit him and hit me and\nhit other people. And they take us all...how many people they find. They find maybe in the\nfarm, it was, nu, maybe 30, 40 people, and they take us in the ghetto, back in the same place\nwhere it was before, and they take us in...in the houses. We come to the houses. Houses stay\na lot of police, Ukraine police and a lot of SS. People from the...all, they take and this time\nthe second pogrom...maybe it was 500, 600 people they came back. When they take us...\nwhen they brought us in this house, they put us and we stay...and we stay until maybe it was\nin morning very early, and we stayed until 2 o'clock maybe or | o'clock at daytime while they\nfind everywhere... everywhere...the police was running everywhere, and they brought all in\nthe house. When its come the time in the house they stay is take...before this, no...uh...maybe\na couple of days ago, we was talking with these two brothers. He said ...one of the brothers\nsaid...what \"I make a gun;\"...nu, he didn't check the gun, if it works. I and he and a couple of\nguys more, he said, \"Let...we will do like this. When they will take us on the...we know what\nthey will take us on the truck and they will take us in forest,\" you know. They said like this.\nNu... they was older and they got more practical and they was, nu, mechanics, and they did\nstuff in weapons. They said...what and we will be on the truck, I will begin to shot all the SS,\nor the police car how it will be we will see, and you run away or how you can take...who\nknows to take the... from them...the guns, the weapons what they have. Now its happened we\ntalked with them. Then when its come before about 2 o'clock, the daytime comes, the first\ntruck comes to the door. What are they doing? The Germans stay...uh...uh... they make like a\ncorridor. And they take from the house Jewish people in the corridor to their truck. You must\nrun and they stayed...1f you don't run, they hit you again from how he can...with us with\nwhat...with a gun, with...with rubber, with sticks, with what hit him. Everybody what comes,\nrun away to the trucks. We say to the people...to these brothers and young people, we\nsay...they will go... I want to tell you one things more. When its come, the first truck, ...nu,\neverybody feels what...what it will be happening. Everybody in this time want to live for 5\nminutes more until it will be come the second truck. No...nobody want to go the first. One\ngoes the other, other one. On the top of the other. I come to my father, and I stay and I tell\nhim, \"Father, you know what...\u201d uh...I tell him the story what \"...here is people. Maybe we\nwill...we will...uh..safe...we will be safe, maybe we must run away...away from the truck.\u201d\nHe said, \"You know what, son. I don't want to see your... (Crying) (Crying) I don't want to\nsee what you will be killed up front of me, and I don't want what you will see what I will be\nkilled in front of you.\u201d I don't... (crying) ... (crying) ... I'm sorry. I went first with the...with\nthe guys and...and I was...they put me it was with my back side I was in the...how it's called,\n\"bort\" [Russ: side] in the truck, and the left side, the back side and left. Believe me, and I\nwill never forget this...this time when they...when I come on the truck and it was a couple of\npeople to...near to me. They was dead. They didn't kill them. They was dead, but they...uh ...,\nnu, from...from the pressure, more from the pressure. It was dead what take the person he\ncannot walk after this. Nu, it was older people. I was this time a child and I was strong. They\nput us....you need to...the feet all in this position to straight the feet and the other one must\nbe...sit on your feet. And it was like that, all of them. In...in front it was a couple SS and\nUkraine police. Maybe it was all the people on the truck, the police and the SS, nu, 5 persons\nor 6 persons. The truck begin to run...go...started to fill up all the truck and...uh...maybe in\na...1n a while, they take us to the...to the place where they shot...shot us...they will shot us.\nThe truck begin to...uh...to go slowly because it was a sign not...not good highway. Then the\none brother get up and begin to shot. When he got up and begin to shot, and the...uh...gun\ndidn't work. He didn't work the gun. The police...how they said they didn't talk to whom.\nEverybody with guns they begin to kill on the truck. They begin to kill...the truck...I was\nsitting in left side. I jumped from the truck. No...how to tell you that a luck, or in this time\nyou...you cannot think. Something, nu, right things or to do right things. Nu, instinctive,\nwhat every person what I met want to live. I jumped. I jumped and I began to run from this\nplace. Nu, and it was...uh...in this time it was... again, I want to say it was good people and it\nwas bad people. The bad people they cried on this...and the good people they cried and the\nbad people they was happy to see, to see the anti-Semitism what the German and the\npoliceman they killed Jewish people. The next...uh...jump peopled stayed and begin to..to\nshow. They, you have in Ukraine what's called \"Zhid,\"_ dirty word for Jewish...uh ...Jewish\npeople what we have in many languages. Nu, in this time the...the police and the German SS\ncome and this way after the truck and come and begin to shot after me to kill me. I'm lucky.\nHow it's happened, I don't know. They didn't kill me. And I come that's...,nu, any...in this\ntime, I want to tell you...in this time it was a couple more, not very...maybe 5 persons what\nthey was begin to run, young, and he decided. Most of them was...they killed the people on\nthe truck. When I run from...when I come 1n a...it was called in English, a barn. I come to a\nbarn and I come...it was a pig inside. I jumped to come on the top. In the top it was straw.\nStraw, yes? Straw, and I...you know what, it's in seconds because if you will do slowly with\nthat, in a second you will be killed. I come and I put...1n the straw, and I don't know a lot of\nwords how its come...in the straw and I put on me, straw to cover my...my...myself, and it's\nafter maybe, nu,...not more than 2 minutes. Not more. Comes I hear...when I stay in the top\non the straw and the...it was standing near the hiding where they take the...the people, the\nJewish people, in the truck, and it was near but I hear everything and I hear what the...how\nthey shot. It was very close from. That's the barn, it was very close. I feel what I mean blood.\nAll my face was in blood. I was thinking where they shot me and they were...and I was\nwounded. Know and I don't know what is happening with me. I feel my nose is bothered me\nand what is blood, and in this time if you can run or you can do something, you don't care\nabout this. Then in a couple of minutes, he...the police, in comes the owner from the...from\nthe barn, and the policeman said in Ukrainian, [\"Sudeya Zhid zabir.\u201d (ph)| That means \"a\nJew comes in your...came in your barn from the truck.\u201d He begin to come...the policeman\ncomes...they come | or 2...I don't know how many it was and comes in the...on steps and\ncomes to watch me in the top. Nu, in this time, I was...I cannot tell you. I was not dead and\nnot in life. How I was feeling. Nu, it was terrible. I know what here...when he will find; in\nmy luck, when he comes up he takes from the middle, the straw from the outside and the\nother side and put them on one side and the other side and he...he said, [\"Nemar Zhida.\u201d\n(ph)| That mean, \"It's not here. He's not here.\u2019 Nu, when I hear what his words. Nu, I cannot\nexplain to you how...what happened to me. Come...he comes down and go away from this\nbarn. In a couple minutes when he left, comes the owner in the...from the barn and his wife\nor children...I don't know the truth, and he begun...begin to talk to them. And he don't know\nwhat I'm in this same barn I'm up there and I hear this everything. He begin to..to explain to\nthem what is happened. What they kill everybody, what not far away the place where they\nkilled them. It's terrible...a terrible place. And then he say, \"I need to take mine horse in my\nbarn because the German tell me, ...the police, to come to take--the highway what they killed\nthe people--to take them and to bring them to the...to the place where they kill them.\u201d In a\ncouple a minutes ago, ...nu, it's taken...I don't know, maybe a hour or a half hour...I don't\nknow exactly time, he comes back and he says what, \"I put dead people and I take them to\nthe place where they kill all of them.\u201d And I hear, next day I hear how they...the guns...how\nthey kill them. And I remember the...the mens they took on the trucks and children and\nwoman, they...a lot of police and they...they go with...by themselves on foots they walk.\nHow long I will live, how long, I will never forgot the voice when they went...and it was the\nbarn stay very close by the highway what they went. They cry. They doing terrible...what\nyou cannot... And I know that was my mother; but not in this time, no. It's people that I\nknow. And I...you must to stay, but what I cannot help. I cannot help nothing. Because if I\nwill go out they will kill me, that's it. And you...you must be with that and to stay. It's\nfinished...they kill; and I hear everything, how they shot everything. It become evening. Nu,\nwhat to do? I was thinking what to do. I cannot stay here. And if I...I need to eat. I need to\ncome out. I cannot stay. What to do in future? My...uh...village. I was decided to go in my\nvillage because I know a lot of people. I know good people. I know bad people. And I know\nthe...the place where I can walk in the forest, nu, and maybe...maybe I will...I will be in life. I\ndon't know how long. I don't know. I decided, nu, how to go to the ghetto to my village, to\nvillage Komarovo. It was near. Nu? We got two bridges from go to ghetto and I know if I\nwill come to the bridges, the bridges they stay...uh... German people or police, and I decided\nto go with...in forest and go to my...to my village. How to came...came out from the...I begin\nto come out from the...from the barn. The owner, he locked out from the other side. I\ncannot...I cannot come out, and I cannot make noises because 1f some noise I know what\nsomebody will be here. In this time, the barns was covered with straw, not like...uh ...you\nknow in America or other places, but we got some covers...uh...metal or what. I break\nthe...the straw on the top. I take...I take...I find....how it's called? ...1t's metal. Its in the end\nsharp metal, what you take hay, I took from them. And I come from the top very quiet and I\nbegan to run. I come over the road, what they take the people into the forest. When I come to\nthe forest, I tell you honestly maybe each my step after 2, 3 step I fell down. I got like...I was\nlooking for somebody like stay the SS, stay the police, what they hear, in this time. Okay. I\ncame..., nu, 1t was maybe three quarters kilometers until what I run to the forest. I come the\nforest. I was tired, very tired, and I sat down; and each leaves in the forest when they begin is\nmy hair, know comes up like...like in...I cannot forgot how they, all they time it stay in my\neyes, the Germans...the police, how they kill, what I think...I think...what Germans stay\nbehind me or up...all that.",
        "A: Okay.\nTAPE #2",
        "A: When I came to the forest and I decided what I need to go only in mine village, it was in this\ntime middle of the night. And I know what... the time goes, and I need to go until it will\nbegin to be day. I need to come...it was a river still, a big river and I need to come over the\nriver. And this time I went maybe a half hour more and I come at night time...sick people at\nnight in the forest that was workers and I was come and sit very close and I hear what they\ntalking. They talking in Russian...in...uh... Ukraine, and I see what I cannot come to them\nbecause they...they talk and I see what it's not good friend for Jewish people. I go on side\nand come near to the...uh...to the river and I begin to run. Run, you know, it was...I need to\npass by...uh...by a 15 kilometers...15 kilometers. It's..uh...maybe a 10 or 12 miles. Maybe it\nwas more a little. I came...that was a city very close to ours.

How it's\ncalled?",
        "A: Yes. I come to the first house and I knock in the window. At nighttime, and I tell them. That\nwas my big mistake. My big mistake, but later I was thinking \"What...what I'm dong? I'm by\nmyself and I knock on a...at night time in a door and I don't know. Maybe it's a police house.\nMaybe...maybe whose somebody what can kill me.\u201d Nu, it's done. Nu, it's...I'm lucky. The\nfinish is good. Comes a lady to the window and begin not...not with something wrong. She\nbegin to me to talk very polite. \"Please, I'm by myself. I cannot go with night time. I...I\ncannot help you.\u201d Nu, I see what she 1s afraid for me, not... I stay this time, I don't know\nwhat to do, what I am afraid. Nu, she begin. I see what I cannot do nothing. I come to\nanother house. The same. Nobody want to go at nighttime out. Come to the river and I begin\nto break boats...small boats, and I go over the...uh...in the boats over the river and the side,\nthere is my village, Komarovo. And I begin to run how my...how I came to run to come to\nsomebody. In Komarovo, I know people...uh... Ukraine people, good people, and they\ncome...the sun become...become...I don't know the time...this time I didn't know only I was\nlooking only in the sun. That was already...it's night...1n the morning become...the sun will\ncome up, and I come to the...to the man he take me at home. I come at home. He\nbegun...begin to ask me, \"How do you think...how you can run away from them?\" Shortly I\ntell him what happened. He was very sorry for me, and nu, he say what \"I can help you.\u201d\nAnd I was...his son and I...we explained together in the same village.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, what I know him before. That...that... I came to my village, village\nKomarovo. I begin to ask him who is in forest. \"Maybe you know somebody's in forest.\nMaybe Jewish people, more.\u201d He tells me things like this; but he didn't see him, no. Uh...he\nsay, what I know, and he did not know, but Srulek Feierman from my...from the same\nvillage, he comes before...maybe before one month, he cames...he...he run away from the\nfirst pogrom. He run away, and he's now in the forest. Nu, where he is? He said, \"I don't\nknow.\u201d No, he told me, the name from the forest name and ...I know very well the places and\nthe...he gave me a piece bread. He gave me to eat. Nu? And I left because 1f somebody will\ncatch me in his home, he will be killed and I will be killed. I went from his home and I come\nin the big...big forest. Big forest. The first night no food I got. I didn't go to some...to... to\nhouses to ask for eat or what. And I came in the forest and the first night...that's...that's mean\nthe second night, first night I was...when I left from the...from the barn. I cannot find a place\nfor me. I cannot sleep. I cannot eat. I cannot...nothing....,nu, ...1n forest and the same I never\nby myself in forest to sleep. It was nu,...unusual. Unusual. Nu, the first night, the second\nnight, the third night, the days that I walked around.... I cried. I don't stop to cry, to... and no\nclothes on me when I run from the truck. It was a short and pants on me. Nothing...nothing\nmore. Nu, maybe the third day or the fourth day, I don't remember exactly, I began to come\nto people what they live...live in forest. They got people...a lot people, they got houses in\nforest. And I...I know very well the people. Very well. Nu, I was thinking I will choose to\nthis man, I can come to him. Nu, I choose...he's a nice man. He was a nice man. Nu, it was\nright I came to people...to this man and I was asking, \"Maybe you know him. Was somebody\nin the forest.\u201d He say...what he is the second Srulek. His name is Srulek like mine name,\nonly my name is Menyuk and he's Feierman. Nu, where he 1s in forest, I cannot tell him\nbecause he don't say. He comes to...to...have a piece bread or what to eat something, and he\ngo away. In this time I...I went to the forest again, and I...by myself I was maybe 2 weeks or\n3 weeks...I don't remember exactly. And then one day I was going and I see a man go...goes\nin forest. Know...you know what...he afraid...he from one side afraid...and the second side I\nwas happy--maybe...maybe that's he. I decided to go to him, and the same thing and we see\nhe knows me and I knows him. And we meet together. Nu, he was older than I am. He was\nmaybe 8 years or 10 years older from me. I was younger. He was..., nu, and that was\nbeginning a life two people. That was 1942 that was...and we begin...",
        "A: This man...he was to mine...a Jewish man from the same... uh...village Komarovo, and he run\naway from the first pogrom, but it was a month ago from Kolki ghetto. Nu, when we met\nwith him, I know him and he knows me; and that's...know, two of us. It's a little easier. He\nbegin to explain how he run away. I tell him how I run away. Nu, what...what we can do. We\ncannot do nothing. We begin to talk with people...uh... with Ukraine people. If some people\nmore, what you know. No more Jewish people, and nobody in forest that you can... No, we\nbegin build life with him, two of us. We didn't got what to eat. We didn't got what to drink,\neat. It was war and what you can. We come in the gardens, we find something there. We can\nstole, and we did. I say that what it was. To some people, we came. Some people give us...,\nnu, in the beginning it was a little bit easier for somebody. And then, nu, after a couple of\nmonths, they told if somebody will give food or will not say...uh...to the Germans, the SS,\nwhat it's come the Jewish people, they will be killed...the Ukraine. Nobody want to give you\nsome food. That's...that was the worse time in the _____ but a couple...couple people, very\ngood people, what they help us. They help us with food. They help us with news to tell us\nwhat is going on. We was thinking, nu, that somebody was saying us that German take\nMoscow...uh...that's...that's and if German will stay that is our life comes to end. Nu, we can\nhold couple of months in that. One man, it was very excellent, very good person. He was...he\nwas like in this time, he was like a father to us. Behind food, one time he...he saved us. How\nhe saved us, I'll tell you. It was no..in...uh...when its become cold time, somebody...the police\nfrom the ghetto...somebody tell them what two Jewish people go around this in this village,\nKomarovo. They came maybe...uh...20, 30 or 40 person..., nu, ...police, to catch us, to kill us.\nNow, you can understand how deep it was the antisemitism in this time. Was for two people-\n-they know what two people--they take a lot of police to come us to kill us. When we came\nto this guy at nighttime, Ukraine man, Ukrainer, and he tell us you know what's truth. Don't\ngo these...these days. Don't go in this place where we always we come to people to beg\nsomething to eat or do something. Don't go this place. Why? He said it was people was\ntalking...1t was...uh...you know the place where people comes...uh...to pray in...uh...a village.\nIt's a [circle] we say...it's a [circle] and its...and people began to talk what it's going this day.\nIt was Sunday. It's come a lot of police and they will kill what they two people...the two\nJewish people what they're going in forest. When he tell us what that's no...that's...they\ndecide what he cannot go more in this place. We didn't come in this place maybe...maybe a\nmonth...month, and then after a month what's in forest, you need to come and there to beg a\npiece bread and to eat something. When they see us, \"Eh! You know what, we didn't believe\nwhat you will be alive,\" and they begin to tell us. What every...every night 1t was maybe it\nwas 3 nights or 4 nights two, three policeman in each house was waiting for us, what we will\ncome in the house. I don't know how lucky we in, until now I don't say, to thank the person\nwhat he told us...told us. What he didn't told us, we will...we will come, probably we will\ncome to this place, and we will be killed. After then, nu, 1t come wintertime. What to do\nwintertime? Wintertime we cannot go. And in this same time, nu, and I want to...excuse\nme...everything was...uh... How it's called? Lice. On us, it was lice. What I tell you, it's un...\nunbelievable. Unbelievable! When you come in the house for one second, if it's warm you\ncannot stay. Everything our...all the skin, all everything, it was in blood. Everything! And\nhungry. Nu, and its come...it come wintertime. What we can do? We begin to talk between\nus, and we make in forest...in the top, we make..., nu, it's called in Russia \"Shalash.\u201d [Russ:\na hut made of branches] Nu, it was cold, become first...first frozen, and we cannot stay\nthere and we cannot sleep, nothing. Then we decided, \"Let me make a hole in the ground,\"\nand it begin...we begin to build the hole in the ground. We cannot leave the hole what some\npeople can see. We build a hole and we take the ground. We take maybe, you know, for a\nhalf mile because if somebody will see fresh ground, thats mean for somebody...somebody is\ndoing something in...in forest. It's getting...somebody will come and to watch. We put this in\nwater. We put this in places so nobody can think for this, and we make the hole. We covered\nthe hole, and you go...we go in and ...uh...we covered the hole with some leaves...leaves or\nit's called, you know, like... like... piece like that, we take to cover the hole but nobody. It\nwas better. Than in the top on the ground was better. Nu, we got again problems. The\nproblems is when it snowed and you come out and you left...you go in snow, you can see\nwhat somebody people goes in there. So if anybody came somebody find. We stay maybe 2\ndays, 3 days, we stayed. It's a lot of snow and people doesn't go. We stayed. We don't come\nout from the hole. We eat snow. We make from snow...we make water. It's terrible water, to\ndrink from snow the water. Food, I don't say food...food we got. We always we\nkeep...uh...some flour, make with water and eat...eat that's food. It's...we eat what...I cannot\ndescribe what we eat. Everything, what it's... what we can find. Raw potatoes or any...any\nfood. Nu, we..the wintertime it was very hard when we stayed in this time. At nighttime we\ngoes...we go, nu, to wait anywhere to eat and we come in...uh...places and you cannot go\nwith...with the highways or the ways you go always straight and you come to water,\nwintertime. You passed a lot of water. You come wet. You cannot make a fire. The...we\nmake fires maybe like people...uh..thousand years ago make the fire. You...you never, nu,\n...maybe see how...how it's a stone and a piece metal and you hit this and it comes...know I\ndon't want to...that's not...know we make...nu, at nighttime you cannot make the fire because\nyou can see from far away the fires is the night we run away then its come a daytime\nmorning, then we make a fire in forest and we stayed....we take off the clothes and I cannot\nsay what's it's clothes. No, it's junk, or in other words. Nu, and we dry up and there again we\nneed to think what to do again. 1942, after that's the wintertime, we began to talk to come to\nhouses they say what it's comes what we have in the forest people. What people, they don't\nknow. Nu, they comes with...uh...with weapons. They come the same. They ask for bread.\nWho is that? We don't know. Nu, they said it can be partisans, Russian partisans. In this time\nwhen it become the war prisoners, Russian war prisoners, run away from the...from\nthem...from the Germans. And they come in forest, and they become not in the same\ntime...uh... Russian prisoners and the same time, they...1t was come the Ukraine...uh...people\nwhat they was, nu, with the \"Nationalisten.\u201d Nu, they was thinking what they\nwant...uh...undependant [i.e., independent] Ukraine...undependant.

They call in this time, Banderovtsy,\n[Minekovtsy (ph)], Bulbovtsy.\u2019 That means the who was the boss, their boss. And the ideas\nwas differents. What they did...what some Ukraine people...what they want undependant\nUkraine....undependant. Nu, in other one to be undependant to Germany. Nu, not to Russia.\nNu, all of them...1f these people...they was anti-Semitism in the idea, their idea. They don't\nwant other nationalities. They want only to be only Ukraine must be lived in Ukraine. It was\nvery close with fascism. Very close. They killed...the same they killed Jewish people, they\nkilled other nationality people. I want to show you example. It was in the same... when we\nwas in forest. And this time it was in Komarovo, in this village 1t was a Polish family, it was\nthe father and a daughter. They come at night and they kill them. For what? What they\nPolish people, and they killed them. In this time, we got afraid to come to these same...to\nthese same Ukraine people to be...and we was right looking for the Russian partisan. Russian\npartisan, and it was very hard. It was a couple...then people saw them. Nu, it's hard to come\n' After Stepan Bandera, Ukrainian nationalist leader who lead a group under the standard\n\"Semastina Ukraina\" (Trans: \"Independent Ukraine\").\n* After Taras Bulba, a 19th century Cossack leader.\nto the.... One time that was..., nu, I cannot tell you the date or the month. Nu, they came to\nPolish people and this time what that's very...very interesting. German...the SS, fascism,\nmake a political edict. They put the Polish people again[st] the Ukraine, the Ukraine\nagain[st] Poland...uh...again[st] Polish people, and each other begin to kill. Ukraine people\ncomes to the Polish villages and kill the...the Polish. The Polish, when they have...uh...when\nthey can...they have...they can come to the Ukraine, they do the same. Nu, 1n this place it was\nfrom ... not far away from our village, 1t was a Polish small village, very small. Now the\nUkraine was much more than Polish people. Then we decided with...oh, I missed one thing\nmore. You know what, uh...the time is going past, a lot of...of episodes... it's a lot...a lot of\nepisodes. I cannot explain all the episodes. Nu, the most important I...I forgot to tell you.\nWhen we was in forest, we...uh...find people and they said what these guys...what he's with\nme...he's... his sister's husband? is the next...he was in next village, in [Kulikovich (ph)] . You\nfind good people and they...they tell him, they went to the other village and they told him\nwhat we said to come to us. And 1n wintertime...it was in wintertime, we find him. We find\nhim, and he comes. His foot, it was frozen at all. He didn't got nothing, only everything in\nthe blood. He cannot walk at all. We left him in the same place, in the same place what we\nmake the hole and we bring something ...a piece bread or what, and he stayed in this hole...,\nnu, ...and to some medicine...no medicine. We take some leaves, some.,... nu, it's not...you\ncannot stay like that. No?. I didn't finish. When become what Ukrainians to come in the\nforest because they want to build Ukraine undependant. You know the politic was the same\nwith the Germans. They kill us, and they kill the Russian partisans. They want to kill Russian\npeople. They don't want nobody to live in Ukraine.

        "A: That... Yes. The forest that was...uh..to comes to White Russia. It's called Byelorussia. Nu, it\nwas begin from Ukraine, and it was big forest. We were staying in forest that's between\nRafalovka, Manevichi, Kovel [Polish: Kowel], what that's the area most partisans because it\nwas a very big good place where...where partisans can stay.

        "A: Well, I'll tell you...uh...like this. They didn't got enough...enough...uh...weapons, and we\nneed the dynamite, for example. The German left a lot of bombs from the... from the\nair...from the airplanes, and they didn't blow up. Some people that they know people that\nthey know from the army, they take off...I don't know how to call their dynamite where it's\nhit the ground, and it's come off the dynamite.
