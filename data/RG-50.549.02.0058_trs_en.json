This is tape number one, side A. So -- and my first\nquestion is what is your full name, give us all your names, your full name, and\nwhen were you born, and where?",
        "A: I was born -- I am Rose. My name, that\u2019s f -- after my husband, but my maiden\nname was Luft, L-u-f-t. And then I -- I married, and my -- my name and my\nchildren\u2019s name are Szyjewicz, S-z-y-J-e-w-1-c-z. Very hard to pronounce, a -- but\nthat\u2019s a Polish name. And then I married a second time, in -- in -- in Los Angeles in\n1970 -- \u00b070, and in Vienna annulled the marriage after a year, and -- but I carry the\nsecond husband\u2019s name because the other one was very hard to pronounce, so I\nchanged the name, not the -- nothing else, not because of anything else. So I keep\nthat name. And I was born in Poland, in a -- in a c-city near la -- Lublin. It was -- is\nZamusht, and -- and I was the middle daughter, sister, ar -- mine two sisters and I\nam there in the middle. And I was left after the war, and my father -- with my father\nand brother, but we were -- we didn\u2019t know about each other. My father was as a\nGentile in L\u2019viv -- Lemberg, and my brother was there too, Oss Bridotsky, and an --\nan -- on Irish paper, and I found them after a year and a half after the war, through\nfriends.",

        "A: God. I don\u2019t know. I think you had to be -- or God, or lucky, or my parents, my\nmother, I don\u2019t know. Because she came to me, I think you s -- you saw, in -- in my\ndream, and -- and -- and she was taking care of me. She didn\u2019t let me run, and she\nsaid, \u201cBecause you are going to get killed. Just wait, and -- and do what they tell\nyou to do.\u201d And I -- maybe she was my angel, watching over me, because I was --\nyou know, like you see, I\u2019m small, and I was very thin that I -- I -- I -- and I -- if I\ntold somebody that I was married and I had a child, they didn\u2019t believe. Because\nyou know, like when you see a big, strong person, and he went through hell, maybe\nhe was strong. I wasn\u2019t strong, and I -- now I\u2019m tough. I wasn\u2019t tough that time, but\nsomehow -- you know with friends, they helped me, she made from garbage peels\nwith sand, soups, and -- and a friend of mine, and she woke me up to -- to eat it.\nYou know, that -- because I wasn\u2019t that organizer, to know how to survive. But\nsomehow I survived.",
        "Q: Did you have a strong will to survive?",
        "A: No. Not at all, I just had a -- had a wish, that I had three uncles in the United\nStates, and I said maybe someday I go to America. And I had a wish to die, or to\nlive, it didn\u2019t matter. To -- why don\u2019t other countries bombard this -- this hell, to\nkill us all, but that w-would be to save our misery. But nobody came, and nobody\nbombed our -- bombard our -- our c -- camps. And maybe I -- we -- that hope that\nsomebody will come and kill us, maybe that kept me alive, because you know, I\nsaw how my girlfriends were dying of -- I -- you know what durpol is?",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s diarrhea.",
        "A: Diarrhea. And -- and they -- they were dying of malaria, and -- and a -- I don\u2019t\nknow, I didn\u2019t have diarrhea, because I was constipated before the war, so I had --\nth -- I-I survived. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all what -- I saw how they dying, in the -- 1n the\nmud, in the dirt, and how they throw those bodies on those wagons, and -- or in\ntaking them to the -- to the con -- to the gas chambers. So I wished not to be throw\nin like this, because my little girl was throw in like this, and I never know where\nshe\u2019s buried, if --",

        "A: -- know how -- no, just --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- just water, and with my fingers. And I used to make the waves that way. The\nchildren, the -- the girls, we didn\u2019t have hair, but whatever grew back, I used to -- to\ndo that, you know, put the -- so they said, one girl said, \u201cI know who can do that.\nShe can do.\u201d And she took me [indecipherable] beautician. Just with wa -- cold\nwater, and -- and -- and fingers, that\u2019s all. So she put me to the shell command --\nshell coo -- couran. She\u2019s -- she -- kitchen.",
        "Q: To the kitchen, yes.",
        "A: Yeah. Ah -- to -- to peel potatoes, but she didn\u2019t like my hands, how they looked,\nso she said, I am going to make you a cook, because you are working for my hair,\nand I want your hands to be clean. So that\u2019s what I di -- I became a c -- a cook.\nWhat is the cook? Just to throw whatever they gave you, the -- that horse\u2019s meat,\nand th-the -- and the bones, and the -- the bad leaves of cabbage, and what they\nthrew out, and -- and that was the soup. And -- and a -- and a margar -- margarine,\nyou know? That\u2019s all. So -- but it was I was a c -- I was a cook. And -- and the\nhands weren\u2019t so bad.

        "Q: Of the barrack?",
        "A: No, of the whole -- of the whole camp. So they ask her if they -- I ca -- can come\nto them. And it wa -- a few of them was very nice, because they weren\u2019t SS women,\nthey were women who used to work in factories, German women, factory women,\nbecause they didn\u2019t have enough people to watch so many -- so many concentration\ncamps. So they used to ask her a favor, to lend me to them, they -- they wanted me\nto like -- to clean the house, and to make the hair. So she sometimes said okay. So I\nhad a few very nice ones. She used -- I don\u2019t remember her name. She used to say,\n\u201cLie down on my bed, and I\u2019m going to lie near you, and tell me about your life.\u201d\nAnd she was very nice. And another one was the alfsarin of the kitchen, and she\nused to say to me, \u201cE -- are you going to kill me after the war is ended?\u201d And I said,\n\u201cNo, you my angel.\u201d You -- she -- she used to give me a little margarine, and a --\nand -- and she -- and she knew I have a little boy, not mine. A doctor\u2019s wife was\nthere, the doctor was killed already and they were doctor and she had the little boy,\nand the name, his name was Olish Umshwike. They were from lot -- from Lemberg,\nand -- and he was the only child in -- in -- in the camp. And -- and I use -- and he\nused to be on the block first, where I was, and I used to help that baby, a boy, he\nwas nine years old, a lot. He made me m-miffin -- ma -- gloves --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] gloves.",
        "A: But you know, with all the fingers, by himself, from old sweaters. And in -- he\nused to say, \u201cIf I\u2019m -- e -- I\u2019m going to live, you\u2019re going to be my second mother,\nbecause you\u2019re my mother, you helping me a lot. So I used to tell that alfsarin that I\nhave a little boy in the -- in -- in the block, and I like to give him a little margarine,\nand some sugar, and you know, help, because he is a very delicate little guy. So she\nused to say, \u201cI didn\u2019t see. I don\u2019t see.\u201d And I used to put it in my pants, in my\npanties, or between my legs, and I used to walk out with it, and I used to help that\nlittle boy. And I never forgot his name. Can you imagine how many times, and I\nremember exactly his name. Then came the -- then one day, you know, I -- I knew\nthat his mother was very sick, and what happened to that little boy, I never found\nout. But there, all of a sudden one day, after I was there maybe a year, and we saw\nAmerican soldiers with trucks, coming to the forner, you know, to the front. And --\nand they used to go into the office, and we didn\u2019t know what -- who they are, even.\nAnd they had, I -- I -- I guess you heard about Bernadot. The her -- he --",
        "Q: T-Tell us about it.",
        "A: This is -- he was from the Red Cross, and he was a prince from Sweden, and his\nname was Bernadot, and he used to exchange prisoners of war for pr -- for us, and\nthey used to give one of us for a hundred prisoners of war, Germans. And it came to\nthey gave the permission, to take t -- the 11 block, no more, and I was in the first,\nand I was the lucky one, that I -- and my girlfriend, who used to live here in the\nUnited States, in Scranton, she lived through, too. And -- Hannah Foorer her name\nwas. And she was in the 11 block, and she couldn\u2019t come with me. We were very\nclose. She used to be my -- my best friend, and my confidant in everything. And in -\n- so I adore her, and she left there, and they told us, after a whole day pre-\npreparations there in the -- in the offices, they told us that we are going to the\nfreedom, but they don\u2019t know how many of us, and they gave us UNRRA packages,\nand they told us not to eat too much, because we going to get sick.",
        "Q: Were they in uniform, or were they in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Unifor -- uni -- uniform, uniform, but all the trucks had on top red crosses. They\nwere big trucks, and so I -- they -- they came in, and everybody was pushing in, but\nthey had a list, who is where, you know? So they called our names, and they told us\nto go out of the -- we were closed in -- 1n -- you know, in -- open -- they opened the\ndoors for us to go to the freedom. That wasn\u2019t freedom, really, but we -- the\nGermans were there. It was about -- it was about we -- the -- the end of the war\ncame about the 15\" of May, and this was in April, something a month before that.\nSo they ex -- that was the exchange, and they gave us the UNRRA packages, and\nthey were very, very nice to us, the -- the Americans. They put their hands under\nour feet to put us to the trucks, and we didn\u2019t understand one word what they\nsaying, and we -- we talked, you know, all German or -- or Polish, or what else? So\n-- but they said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201d And -- and they said, \u201cNo more, no, no, no,\nno.\u201d So we knew that -- not to eat any more, just a little bit, but we were very\nhungry, of course you want to eat. They gave us chocolates, and I don\u2019t remember\nwhat, and cheeses, and -- and things what we didn\u2019t have.",
        "Q: But they knew you would get sick if you ate too much?",
        "A: Yes, so they told us not to eat too much, and they -- and we were 40 in a truck.\nThey load us -- | -- they load in a truck of 40 in -- it -- that took a whole -- a whole\nday, and that was the next day that we -- we were freed to go out the gates, but the\nGermans were watching who was going -- who was going out, with papers, with\neverything. So it was very -- a tragic moment, even we went for the freedom. We\nleft our friends there, we left -- we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them. But\nit -- in one way it was tragic, in one w -- way it was freedom. And -- and we saw\n[indecipherable] you see we free to the birds, we talking. And I -- and we -- we used\nto say we free like you. Or a dog, we free like you, we -- we -- and they said, \u201cNow,\nwhere you out of that -- of those ca-cages, you have the right to spit at them,\u201d -- the\nAmerican soldiers. \u201cYou can spit, you can throw whatever you want on them, and\nthey have no right to s -- to e -- e -- seek you any more. You are in our hands.\u201d",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t. We were glad we out. We just say -- said to him, you know, like\ngo to hell, or you -- you -- I -- I don\u2019t even remember what we said. We said you --\nyou Nazis you -- you -- you killers, you everything. And some weren\u2019t even Nazis,\nsome were soldiers, taken there to -- to watch us -- watchmen. And they were afraid\nof their own skin, they said -- yeah, that\u2019s true. Not all of them were -- were too\nbad, because before, when they came into our -- to our country in 1931, that was a\nlot of Wehrmarkt soldiers were very nice. One even send me a letter from the front,\nwithout the address, and he col -- he said to -- he wrote me, \u201cMine lieber\nRosamunda,\u201d and \u201cI liebelish, and I\u2019m never going to forget you.\u201d And I just talked\nto him -- I didn\u2019t even before, you know, like on the street, and they came into our\nbusiness or something, and -- and they talked, they were nice people. They came to\nour house to say m-mutti you have dry hipshin , the orders, you know?",
        "Q: Like credit orders?",
        "A: Yeah, and they -- my mother used to make them coffee, and -- because they were\nmer -- Wehrmarkt, the SS wasn\u2019t there yet. And they were very nice people, they\ncame to rob us, but when they saw three hipsha girls, they didn\u2019t take from us\nnothing, they brought us food, okay? That\u2019s the truth. What the truth is, it\u2019s the\ntruth, but not -- it was one in a million, okay? So the -- that\u2019s not -- that wasn\u2019t\nenough.",
        "Q: The -- the Americans on the truck when they took you out --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: Did they speak, eventually, through a translator to you, so that you could\nunderstand?",
        "A: No, no, we just understand un -- un -- you know, I-like dumb lag -- language,\nyou know, like mute language, and they -- they took us up, and we went -- they took\n40 trucks out, because in each truck was 40 people, and they had 11 -- 11 bro --\nblocks, just the right to take out, because they didn\u2019t have enough gifangyenna to\nchange for the others, so they --",
        "Q: P.O.W.\u2019s.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Prisoners, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, the prisoners of war. So they exchange th -- so much, and so much, and\nthey -- and we start leaving. It was a lot of crying, and a lot of happiness, and a lot\nof cursing, you know? It was. But we went out, and they were going. That was in\nmiddle of the night. And we were going, and we asked them where are you going?\nThey said, now it\u2019s Essen, now it\u2019s this, you know? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- they told us --\nthat\u2019s -- th-the towns, but I don\u2019t remember really. I remember Essen, because it\nwas food.",
        "Q: Essen is the German word for eat.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s a city, the name of a city, too.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, and the name of a city, and Essen I know. If ort -- I know German --\nI knew German that time, and I -- I's -- I promised myself that I\u2019m never going to\ntalk Germ -- speak German, and I never did, you know, I -- I spoke beautiful\nSwedish, and I don\u2019t, because you don\u2019t use the language. So we di -- we were d --\ngoing, and they were telling us where we going, we can -- came about -- I don\u2019t\nknow how many kilometers from Denmark, and they start shooting us from the --\nour trucks, with a red cross on top, big huge. The airplanes were very low, the\nGermans, and they were shooting on our trucks. So the -- the Americans said, \u201cFast,\nfast.\u201d They didn\u2019t know, but they said, \u201cGo on, go on.\u201d And to -- to hide in the\nditches. In -- y-you okay there?",

        "A: In -- in -- to -- to -- to go into the ditches and hide. But they were shooting\nanyway. So we had -- it was in nowhere, almost in nowhere, in -- it was a little\nmaybe farmer\u2019s little town. So we saw a house, a farmer\u2019s house, and s -- and I was\nwith them to run into that building, and you know, they said, \u201cJuden arous.\u201d They\nsaid that they didn\u2019t know about anything now, they say. They didn\u2019t know, nobody\nknew what\u2019s going on. Even in a little heck -- hick town. I don\u2019t even know where\nit was, they didn\u2019t let us into the building. They said, \u201cJuden -- farfluked de Juden,\nrouss.\u201d That\u2019s all. Because we were still with the u -- with the -- the -- the uniforms\nand everything. And -- and dirty, and -- and you know. So they didn\u2019t let us in. So\nthe -- the ge -- the American soldiers told us to wait out in the ditches, til 1t\u2019s going\nto -- til they\u2019re going to leave, and fast to run into the woods. And through the\nwoods we went, not with the -- but with the -- about three days we walked to -- to\nDenmark.",
        "Q: You walked to Denmark?",
        "A: To the Denmark, with -- wi -- through the woods, because we didn\u2019t have\nanother way. In the woods, they said it\u2019s trees, they not going to see us. So that\u2019s --\nI don\u2019t know, it may be two days, may be three day -- it -- it\u2019s a long time you\nwalked and walked, and they used to say to sit down, and -- and rest, and we came\ninto Denmark. Before we came into Denmark, they said no speak bad German. No\nbad German, you know? Because in -- in Denmark it\u2019s a lot of spice, shpionin.\nOkay? So we didn\u2019t talk about Germans, we were afraid. When we came into\nDenmark, they took us in like we were -- we were queens and kings. They were so\ngood to us, that I say that they are the nicest people in the world, til today. Sweden\nwas very good to us, too, very good, but not comparing to the -- to the -- to the\nDenmark people, because they had the Germans there, and they knew how we\nsuffered.",

        "A: They must be with Red Cross, because they were waiting for us. So it means that\nin that little town, I don\u2019t even know the name of it, because you know, you came\nout from hell, and you came into heaven, okay? Heaven. They were waiting with\nwhite clothes on them, and -- and -- and -- and -- and greeting us with so much love,\nand so much attention, and with flowers, and they were very nice. And -- and they\nwere in -- but we had like stables there, because they didn\u2019t have so much place. So\nthey -- they put new straw in the stables, and -- and -- and we -- and they made\ntables on the streets there, for us to dine, to eat. And they didn\u2019t give y -- us too\nmuch, because they said -- they -- they spoke German, so they said not to eat too\nmuch because we going to get very sick, and we going to have to go to the -- to -- to\nthe Riviera -- the Rivera -- the -- you know, the -- th-the hospital, because you\ngoing to get sick to our stomachs, and our stomachs are not used to those -- the\nfood, and it\u2019s different than -- than in the concentration camp.",

        "A: They gave us I don\u2019t know, but they told us don\u2019t take seconds, please not to\ntake seconds, because a lot of them did, and a lot of them got sick, and a lot of them\ndied.

So I don\u2019t remember, it\u2019s so many years ago, with -- to remember what\nthey gave us. They gave us very good food, and they begged us not to eat too much.\nNo seconds, no seconds. I-In -- in -- and so we didn -- a -- I -- I was listening to\nthem because I was never a big eater. You can see me now. I am not a big eater, I\ncan eat a piece of bread and I wa -- had enough.",

Not things,\nthings you can buy for money. This is not pleasures. We -- I lost two sisters, and I\nlost my sister\u2019s children, and I lost my mother, and I lost my child. And I lost\neverything and -- what -- what wor -- worth living for? But we are -- a person 1s just\na person, and everybody, in no matter what situation, wants to live. And I don\u2019t\nknow if I wanted to live. I -- somehow I came out alive, but that\u2019s what I lost. Never\nI forget, and I never stop crying, never. Because, when you look around on my old\nage, I am seeing, even if I have children, they -- it\u2019s not Poland, or my city. It\u2019s a --\nit\u2019s a big country, and everybody goes someplace else where they can make a\nliving, and I stayed here, and -- and it\u2019s not -- the children are not the children that\nwe used to be to our parents. The children don\u2019t care about their old parents. They\ndo, but in a different way. They just try to push you into an old age home, which\nsome are doing it, but I am not going to let happen, because I am going to eat a\npiece of bread without nothing on it. I have to want my peace and quiet, and my\nkorern. And I don\u2019t want to be with my children, because they have their lives, and\nI have my life. They don\u2019t owe me anything, but they -- they -- I\u2019m not a -- because\nI brought them on this world, they didn\u2019t ask for it. But, in the other hand, I am not -\n- 1am me, by myself, and that\u2019s my life, and I\u2019m taking care of myself. I worked\nvery hard in my life, in the freedom. I was everything in the world. I did everything,\nworks -- worked in factories, and work -- cleaned stairs, and worked every -- I -- the\nonly thing I wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t a street worker. Otherwise, I did everything. And I,\nsince 1996, and now -- now it\u2019s \u201999, I was alone with three children, and I worked\nin a bakery. I worked everywhere, in factories, in bakeries, and I put together a\npenny to a penny, because I knew that some -- and I made -- I married second time\nin 1970, just for a few -- for a year, and I found out that my second husband was\nmolesting his daughter, he was sleeping with his daughter, and I -- after a year, I --\nwe annulled the marriage. I didn\u2019t want to live in a home like this. So I am by my\now -- on my own through 1973. On my own, and I make my living, and I worked\n12 hours a day, taking care, when I was still young, or old people. And 12 hours a\nday with old-timers, with all kind of people, and I washed them, and I b-bathed\nthem, and I take -- took care of them, and I loved them like mine parents. And I\nmade my living, and I put a penny to a penny, and now I live on my -- I was --\nwhen I left -- I divorced my husband, because he was no good to me. So I -- after I\ndivorced him, I didn\u2019t have nothing, only a kitchen table, and a -- and a bed -- and a\n-- and a folding bed from -- a few folding backs, what my landlord gave me, and I\nmade everything with my 10 fingers. I worked. I put every -- I didn\u2019t go for\nvacations, I didn\u2019t go no place, I just went to mine s -- to -- to Canada back and\nforth, because I had a sick -- first my father died, then my brother was sick, and\notherwise, I didn\u2019t go for any vacations, and I made my life. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m\nliving on, and I\u2019m never going to let my children put me in -- in an old age home. I\nrather kill myself, because I told them, and they know, no old age home.",

She -- she was -- she was Gentile, but I knew the -- you know,\nwhere they lived, and we used to call her -- my mother\u2019s friend aunt, you know? So\nI know my aunts address and everything. So I called. I -- I wrote -- was writing\nletters to Poland, and I wrote a letter to my friend, a boyfriend in Poland, and -- and\nI ask him, please tell me if you saw somebody o -- from my family. So he -- it took\n-- and I call -- and I wrote to my mum -- mother\u2019s friend, so-called my aunt, and I\ncall -- and I re -- wrote to my brother\u2019s friend Bias, h-he didn\u2019t even answer me, but\nI called to Korba. He was a -- a artist -- a painter, and I called to them, and they --\nmy brother and father was there when they got my letter, and -- and she -- and they\nwere dancing, and they got all drunk, 1 -- because my brother and father, when the\nwar ended, they came to Gdansk -- to Danzig, a -- but -- but they came to see the\nfriends in our town, to Zamush, very far. And -- and so they -- they got the letter --\nshe got the letter, and they were dancing, and they were crying, and they were\ndrunk, and they -- and they wrote me a letter. I have still a -- a few letters, I don\u2019t --\nI can\u2019t find them now. And I -- and -- and my mother\u2019s friend co -- said to me,\n\u201cDrink a little water, and -- and read that letter, your father is here.

And after I -- they -- they --\nthey -- I wrote to -- they send me -- my mother\u2019s friend gave me their address where\nthey lived, and I wrote a letter to them, and they -- they wrote a letter to me. My\nfather said to come, he is -- he wants to see me, because he can\u2019t go to Sweden.\nThat time, you have to be a Swedish citizen to be able to bring somebody to\nSweden.

He was here nine months, nine and a half months with me, when he was\nstill alive. And -- and -- and my brother, they were my life. I didn\u2019t have anybody.\nNo cousins, no -- nobody, only American uncles who didn\u2019t give a damn about\nanything. They -- we were -- we didn\u2019t know each other.

And they don\u2019t -- one has a Jewish wife, it\u2019s not that they\ndon\u2019t have Jewish wives, but sometimes is hurting me. His little girl, my middle\nson\u2019s, said, \u201cTeddy, can we go to church?\u201d And that hurts me, because I am Jewish.\nI don\u2019t -- I -- I don\u2019t go to synagogue, I am not a religious Jew, but this 1s my faith,\nand with this faith I will die. I went through a Holocaust because of my faith, and I\nnever going to change it. Mine father became back Jewish, and my brother became\nJewish back, and my sister-in-law was Ukrainian, in th -- in -- in Montreal. She had\none boy, he was religious. He came with those -- you know, tha -- the very\nOrthodox Jews, she made out of him. And she -- was a k -- Ukrainian. And she\nbegged me when she was dying, she was 43 years old when she died of cancer in\nMontreal. I brought them from Israel to Montreal. And -- and she begged me to put\nher on the Jewish cemetery. And she was never -- he\u2019d never -- she\u2019d never changed\nher religion, but she wanted to be on the Jewish cemetery. See? So I never changed\nmy religion for nothing in the world. And more older I am getting, more I am\nlistening to Jewish prayers, in -- which I don\u2019t know nothing. I don\u2019t know how to\nread in Jewish, and I don\u2019t know how to pray in Jewish. But when I heard the\nKaddish, you know, after the dead, and when -- I cry very much, because I am --\nthey are telling Kaddish for my family, okay? So I -- I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t observe\nthe Jewish holidays. I -- I observe them only because this is -- the } -- the Jewish --\nnot rel -- not -- this is not religious, this is tradition. I -- I -- I believe in my tradition,\nI believe in my God. I believe -- I don\u2019t go to a synagogue because I don\u2019t believe\nin rabbis, I don\u2019t believe in what they tell me. I -- if the God, my God, is in the cher\n-- in the -- in the synagogue, he is in my house, too. He is everywhere, and if I want\nto pray, I pray to Him with all my heart, with all my mighty.

He used\nto go to churches, because he was afraid of everything. He was in Lemberg as a --\nas a Gentile, and a Polack from our town came in, a policeman, and he saw my\nfather, and my father got white like this, and he t -- and my father had a store in -- in\nLemberg, so that this policeman, Polish policeman, saw my father turning white,\nand he turned around, and he said, \u201cLooft, don\u2019t be afraid. I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d In the\nwartime, okay? And he walked out of that store. So -- 1 -- 1 -- after the war, my\nfather used to go to church because he thought -- he -- he started saying, \u201cThey\ngoing to kill me. They going to kill me if they going to know that I\u2019m a Jew.\u201d So he\nw-was going with the procession, first with the procession with the cross. And I said\nto my father, \u201cFather, if -- if they -- if I\u2019m not going to be able -- I\u2019m going to -- to\nCanada. And -- first to Israel, and then to Canada, because I can\u2019t go different ways.\nBut if you not going to change your name, they,\u201d -- he was in jail at Oscojanolsk1. I\nsaid, the Jewish Federation asking you what\u2019s your real name, and you don\u2019t want\nto tell them, because they going to kill me, I\u2019m afraid. My father, with the Jewish\nname -- with the Polish name, went to the Jewish Federation for a Passover. You\nknow what\u2019s Passover is. And he met another engineer guy, who was -- asked my\nfather, he had a-a -- a Polish name, and they met there, in the Jewish Federation in\nGdansk. And this friend of my father said, \u201cKatchanowski, what are you doing\nhere?\u201d He said the [indecipherable], because why did you | -- why did -- it was\nPassover. So he came to -- to celebrate Passover with the Jews, but outside he was\nafraid that they going to denounce him, and he\u2019s going -- they going to kill him,\nbecause they killed a lot of Jews in -- in Poland after the war. Polack -- Polish\npeople. They made pogroms, and they killed them. My brother came to sell\nsomething what belonged to us, a house, and this, and -- and they told him, if you\nnot going to leave here -- from here, you know what\u2019s going to happen to you. So\nmy brother left, okay\u2019? So that\u2019s the truth, what I\u2019m telling you. So we -- my -- so I\ntold my father, \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to change your name back to po -- to -- to -- to\nyour name, you Looft. You have to be Looft, you know?\u201d L-u-f-t, it\u2019s Luft in -- in\npo -- in English, but it was Looft in Polish. So I said, if-- it\u2019s a German name, and --\nand -- and -- and he said -- I said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to change it, how am I related\nto you to bring you to wherever I am?\u201d So finally he came as Katchanowski to\nIsrael. And from Israel I said, \u201cFather,\u201d -- and my brother as Brodotsky -- \u201cyou\ncan\u2019t come to Canada if you not going to change your name, because they -- they\nask me who is he to you? He\u2019s related -- why don\u2019t you have his name?\u201d So they\nchanged first, back to Luft. My brothe -- brother died as a Luft, and my father died\nas a Luft in Canada.

Because I had to go to France from Israel, and for\nFrance, I came to Halifax, to -- to calif -- to Canada. And so I -- she took care, and\nwe became the best friends, til she died here. She got married, then she married -- to\nCalifornia, and she died. And we were the best friends. She was an -- a Ukrainian\nlady, she was -- she had cancer. So I came here, to Canada, because it was a lot of\ngreenhorns, you know, coming from all over, to ba -- Canada was a easy country to\ncome in. After the war they let us in. Here, they didn\u2019t let us in. They didn\u2019t want to\neven the little children let in, okay? So there, they let us in, and we came all to\nthere.

And -- and I said, in --in that -- and if I see a\nmovie, I sit and cry loud, loud. Because this I can do, nobody is going to say stop it.\nOr my girlfriend, she wasn\u2019t in the concentra -- she run. She was in Germany, and\nthen she went to Israel in \u201938. She said, \u201c\u201cWhy are you watching that junk?\u201d Okay?\nTo me, it\u2019s my life, it\u2019s not junk. Everyone had a different life there. Every minute\nis different by millions and millions of people. And so mill -- so many millions\ndead. So my -- my mother I never saw after she was 45. I never saw her in my life. I\ndon\u2019t know where she\u2019s buried. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s cremated, or she -- where she 1\n-- her bones are. Not my sisters, not my whole family. Only my father I buried in\nMontreal. Me, when they say, \u201cWhy are you want to be cremated?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause\nI don\u2019t want it -- my mother was a young woman, and she -- who knows where her\nbones is. I want to be cremated like all the Jews were.\u201d Okay? That\u2019s not a sin, to be\ncremated. They -- the Jews, the very religious Jews said it\u2019s a sin [indecipherable],\nbecause you have to be buried in Jewish religion. And I said it\u2019s not true. I -- if th --\nif they could be -- I don\u2019t know where they ashes are, what am I different? That I\u2019m\nalive? I\u2019m not. It\u2019s not alive, it\u2019s live with the deaths, all my life. I live with the\nmemory of them. I used to scream in middle of the night, and they used to wake me\nup. They -- you -- you didn\u2019t have child -- so many children that time, I -- I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for my sons, for my children.\u201d You didn\u2019t have the children, you have\nthem now. Okay, so why should I be better than anybody else? I can be cremated. I\ndon\u2019t have to -- they not going to come to my grave anyway. Because one lives\nhere, and one there, they not going to -- I, when I come to Montreal, I go to my\nfather. When I was in Montreal, my -- my brother was dying, I went to my father\u2019s\ngrave, and I said, \u201cFather, please, have mercy on -- take him already, because he is\nsuffering terrible.\u201d And he listened to me, I suppose.

Oh, you don\u2019t even know\nwhat I went through. You know, so I don\u2019t talk to anybody. I talk to myself. In one -\n- when my children don\u2019t give me the respect, I don\u2019t want anything from them. I\ndon\u2019t take from him -- from them. I don\u2019t ask for -- for help, for money.

And that\u2019s what --\nand I can\u2019t cry. Everybody who u -- why do you have to cry? And it\u2019s as -- it\u2019s a\nJewish word, and it\u2019s a -- I -- I think the words were, you cr -- when you cry, you\ncry a-alone, when you laugh, the whole world laughs with you. Okay? And that\u2019s\nthe truth. Nobody wants to hear you crying, nobody wants to see you crying. If the -\n- I cry, my children say, \u201cWhy are you crying, what -- what -- what\u2019s wrong?\nNothing\u2019s wrong with you, why you crying?\u201d Okay? They don\u2019t know their\ngrandparents.

That\u2019s what I -- that -- what -- what can I say? I just say that\u2019s\nwhat I see with the Ku Klux Klans, and with everything in here, and they let it\nhappen. This is n -- this is unbelievable, because Hitler started that way, and they\nshouldn\u2019t -- why? That he is Black, and I am Jew? I-It was -- it\u2019s one God, what we\nall believe, that he-he had a son, and we are his children, too. He -- he wasn\u2019t the\nonly son, he had many sons. Jesus had -- is a son of God.

They gave us chocolates, and I don\u2019t remember\nwhat, and cheeses, and -- and things what we didn\u2019t have.",
        "A: Yes, so they told us not to eat too much, and they -- and we were 40 in a truck.\nThey load us -- | -- they load in a truck of 40 in -- it -- that took a whole -- a whole\nday, and that was the next day that we -- we were freed to go out the gates, but the\nGermans were watching who was going -- who was going out, with papers, with\neverything. So it was very -- a tragic moment, even we went for the freedom. We\nleft our friends there, we left -- we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to them. But\nit -- in one way it was tragic, in one w -- way it was freedom. And -- and we saw\n[indecipherable] you see we free to the birds, we talking. And I -- and we -- we used\nto say we free like you. Or a dog, we free like you, we -- we -- and they said, \u201cNow,\nwhere you out of that -- of those ca-cages, you have the right to spit at them,\u201d -- the\nAmerican soldiers. \u201cYou can spit, you can throw whatever you want on them, and\nthey have no right to s -- to e -- e -- seek you any more. You are in our hands.\u201d",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t. We were glad we out. We just say -- said to him, you know, like\ngo to hell, or you -- you -- I -- I don\u2019t even remember what we said. We said you --\nyou Nazis you -- you -- you killers, you everything. And some weren\u2019t even Nazis,\nsome were soldiers, taken there to -- to watch us -- watchmen. And they were afraid\nof their own skin, they said -- yeah, that\u2019s true. Not all of them were -- were too\nbad, because before, when they came into our -- to our country in 1931, that was a\nlot of Wehrmarkt soldiers were very nice. One even send me a letter from the front,\nwithout the address, and he col -- he said to -- he wrote me, \u201cMine lieber\nRosamunda,\u201d and \u201cI liebelish, and I\u2019m never going to forget you.\u201d And I just talked\nto him -- I didn\u2019t even before, you know, like on the street, and they came into our\nbusiness or something, and -- and they talked, they were nice people. They came to\nour house to say m-mutti you have dry hipshin , the orders, you know?",
        "A: Yeah, and they -- my mother used to make them coffee, and -- because they were\nmer -- Wehrmarkt, the SS wasn\u2019t there yet. And they were very nice people, they\ncame to rob us, but when they saw three hipsha girls, they didn\u2019t take from us\nnothing, they brought us food, okay? That\u2019s the truth. What the truth is, it\u2019s the\ntruth, but not -- it was one in a million, okay? So the -- that\u2019s not -- that wasn\u2019t\nenough.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: No, no, we just understand un -- un -- you know, I-like dumb lag -- language,\nyou know, like mute language, and they -- they took us up, and we went -- they took\n40 trucks out, because in each truck was 40 people, and they had 11 -- 11 bro --\nblocks, just the right to take out, because they didn\u2019t have enough gifangyenna to\nchange for the others, so they --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, the prisoners of war. So they exchange th -- so much, and so much, and\nthey -- and we start leaving. It was a lot of crying, and a lot of happiness, and a lot\nof cursing, you know? It was. But we went out, and they were going. That was in\nmiddle of the night. And we were going, and we asked them where are you going?\nThey said, now it\u2019s Essen, now it\u2019s this, you know? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- they told us --\nthat\u2019s -- th-the towns, but I don\u2019t remember really. I remember Essen, because it\nwas food.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, and the name of a city, and Essen I know. If ort -- I know German --\nI knew German that time, and I -- I's -- I promised myself that I\u2019m never going to\ntalk Germ -- speak German, and I never did, you know, I -- I spoke beautiful\nSwedish, and I don\u2019t, because you don\u2019t use the language. So we di -- we were d --\ngoing, and they were telling us where we going, we can -- came about -- I don\u2019t\nknow how many kilometers from Denmark, and they start shooting us from the --\nour trucks, with a red cross on top, big huge. The airplanes were very low, the\nGermans, and they were shooting on our trucks. So the -- the Americans said, \u201cFast,\nfast.\u201d They didn\u2019t know, but they said, \u201cGo on, go on.\u201d And to -- to hide in the\nditches. In -- y-you okay there?",
        "A: In -- in -- to -- to -- to go into the ditches and hide. But they were shooting\nanyway. So we had -- it was in nowhere, almost in nowhere, in -- it was a little\nmaybe farmer\u2019s little town. So we saw a house, a farmer\u2019s house, and s -- and I was\nwith them to run into that building, and you know, they said, \u201cJuden arous.\u201d They\nsaid that they didn\u2019t know about anything now, they say. They didn\u2019t know, nobody\nknew what\u2019s going on. Even in a little heck -- hick town. I don\u2019t even know where\nit was, they didn\u2019t let us into the building. They said, \u201cJuden -- farfluked de Juden,\nrouss.\u201d That\u2019s all. Because we were still with the u -- with the -- the -- the uniforms\nand everything. And -- and dirty, and -- and you know. So they didn\u2019t let us in. So\nthe -- the ge -- the American soldiers told us to wait out in the ditches, til 1t\u2019s going\nto -- til they\u2019re going to leave, and fast to run into the woods. And through the\nwoods we went, not with the -- but with the -- about three days we walked to -- to\nDenmark.",
        "A: To the Denmark, with -- wi -- through the woods, because we didn\u2019t have\nanother way. In the woods, they said it\u2019s trees, they not going to see us. So that\u2019s --\nI don\u2019t know, it may be two days, may be three day -- it -- it\u2019s a long time you\nwalked and walked, and they used to say to sit down, and -- and rest, and we came\ninto Denmark. Before we came into Denmark, they said no speak bad German. No\nbad German, you know? Because in -- in Denmark it\u2019s a lot of spice, shpionin.\nOkay? So we didn\u2019t talk about Germans, we were afraid. When we came into\nDenmark, they took us in like we were -- we were queens and kings. They were so\ngood to us, that I say that they are the nicest people in the world, til today. Sweden\nwas very good to us, too, very good, but not comparing to the -- to the -- to the\nDenmark people, because they had the Germans there, and they knew how we\nsuffered.",
        "A: People. People did, the mayor, and people. They took us into -- to like s --",
        "A: Okay..",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: They must be with Red Cross, because they were waiting for us. So it means that\nin that little town, I don\u2019t even know the name of it, because you know, you came\nout from hell, and you came into heaven, okay? Heaven. They were waiting with\nwhite clothes on them, and -- and -- and -- and -- and greeting us with so much love,\nand so much attention, and with flowers, and they were very nice. And -- and they\nwere in -- but we had like stables there, because they didn\u2019t have so much place. So\nthey -- they put new straw in the stables, and -- and -- and we -- and they made\ntables on the streets there, for us to dine, to eat. And they didn\u2019t give y -- us too\nmuch, because they said -- they -- they spoke German, so they said not to eat too\nmuch because we going to get very sick, and we going to have to go to the -- to -- to\nthe Riviera -- the Rivera -- the -- you know, the -- th-the hospital, because you\ngoing to get sick to our stomachs, and our stomachs are not used to those -- the\nfood, and it\u2019s different than -- than in the concentration camp.",
        "A: They gave us I don\u2019t know, but they told us don\u2019t take seconds, please not to\ntake seconds, because a lot of them did, and a lot of them got sick, and a lot of them\ndied. That\u2019s the truth. Because you know, you couldn\u2019t get enough of it. We --\nthere, we had -- if I found a potato 1n the ground when we went to work, I was their\n-- | was their commando, and so -- and I ate the -- that tomato -- the potato I mean,\nwith a little -- nothing on it, and with nothing -- with the sand, with the -- I said,\n\u201cThis 1s going to be mine dessert, where -- if I am going to live through that.\u201d",
        "A: A potato. Even dirty. Okay, that is going to be a dessert. An after dinner, if you\ngoing to have dinner, because it tastes so good. So whatever they gave us, it was\ndelicious. So I don\u2019t remember, it\u2019s so many years ago, with -- to remember what\nthey gave us. They gave us very good food, and they begged us not to eat too much.\nNo seconds, no seconds. I-In -- in -- and so we didn -- a -- I -- I was listening to\nthem because I was never a big eater. You can see me now. I am not a big eater, I\ncan eat a piece of bread and I wa -- had enough.",
        "A: Yeah. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t eat that -- now I -- I -- I gained weight, because I can\nwork so much, but I was walking with -- with weights in my hand, and I was\nwalking I -- I never gained a pound.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I walked a day, I -- here. An hour, fast, that I came home I had\nto take a shower, or I was wet, okay?",
        "A: No. They said, \u201cYou going to be here for awhile,\u201d and we going away to\nSweden. But by -- by a boat. But in meantime we here, and they took a -- th-the best\ncare in my life, except my home. In a -- they -- they gave us clean clothes,\nsomething to -- to -- to -- to throw -- they -- not exactly, because in Sweden they\nchanged everything, but there, whatever somebody could bring, they brought us.\nAnd they -- and then, about two weeks later, it was maybe two, maybe a little more,\nI don\u2019t -- ab -- it\u2019s about two weeks.

        "A: -- the -- the tr -- no, th-the -- not the train. They took us with a train there, to the\nboats. It\u2019s a boat. 24 hours just right. But they were -- it was pouring that day, this I\nnever going to forget. And all the town, and around the town, came with flowers in\ntheir hands, and they were hugging us, and telling us good luck, and good luck in\nwherever you go. And they cried, and we went. We went to Sweden, 24 hours ride,\nand I am very -- I can\u2019t go by ocean. I -- I was sick. I -- I am always seasick. I\u2019m no\n-- even here. My friend had a boat, from -- from what do you call it, the -- the other\nboats are standing and -- and -- doesn\u2019t matter. A few miles, I can\u2019t go by. So he\nused to give me pills to -- to -- to -- to -- didn\u2019t help me. Even my son, who 1s now\nhere, he used to throw up, too. It\u2019s just from Marina Del Ray, til Santa Monica, I\ncouldn\u2019t make it. I couldn\u2019t make it. So, you see -- and that was 24 hours, I was\nvery sick, I didn\u2019t see the ocean, I didn\u2019t see anything. But, I came to Sweden. We\ncame to Mulmay, Sweden. They were there, it was prepared for us, big buildings\nwith mattresses, wide. Can you imagine how a sheet on a mattress, a sheet, a white\nsheet. That was something I didn\u2019t see for five years.

And 1n the morning, we -- that was -- we --\nwhen we came in, it was there at night, too. We had everything. They gave us\nsomething very light to eat, and a -- it was written, you know, in Swedish, on the\nwalls, what -- to something forbidden, for -- so -- but it\u2019s forbidden for Jude. No,\nyou -- wait a minute, not Jude, something that 1t came out Jude. For Bude.\nSomething, you know? So we didn\u2019t understand, and I said, \u201cOh my God, we are\nJuden -- Jude here, too.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just we -- that\u2019s our language mixed\nwith German.\u201d So -- but they -- they were very -- then, the next day, they took us\nalmost na -- with sheets on -- on our -- on us, they took us to department store, and\nthey dressed us from bottom to top, even bras, what we didn\u2019t wear for years, bras,\nand panties, and -- and -- and -- and dresses, and shoes, and socks, and -- and -- and\nfrom the underwear to a dress in our coats, okay? I took a brown coat, I remember\nthat fit me. You had to take what they gave us to try on. What fits you, not just they\ngave you Clothes, no. You tried on to fit. And that\u2019s what we went -- we went a few\n-- we went back to Mulmay with the clothes. Can you imagine we looked like\npeople, and we were dressed clean, with no lice, with no nothing. We would --\nabout I -- I personally didn\u2019t have lice, I worked in the kitchen. I was clean. I didn\u2019t\nhave the beautif -- the -- the clothes what they gave us there.

We had like a -- a dinner time, and a breakfast time, and\naround that place was a beautiful lake, and you could swim in the lake, and I -- we\ndidn\u2019t have anything to -- to swim in, we were naked, swimming naked. It was only\ngirls. And -- and in the side was beautiful forests, and we used to go to -- into the\nforest naked. And then th-the boys found out what there are girls swimming naked.\nSo they used to come with little boats, boating there, and -- and we didn\u2019t care\nbecause the Germans saw -- saw us all naked. But it still, you know, somebody 1-in\na different country, they see us. So we were sitting in the water, we didn\u2019t want to\nget -- or we run to the -- to the forest. So -- and that was for months we were there,\nabout a half a year in there. And we were fed very, very well, very good, e -- but\nevery Sunday, people from Lunde, the sta -- the -- the big -- the bigger city, they\nused to come and look at us like -- and -- and from Norchepink, and from\neverywhere, look at us like monkeys in a cage, because we were something to them\nlike they never saw. Like -- not animals, really, we were people to them, but we\nwere like a wonder from -- like aliens from another world, because they never saw\nconcentration camp people. They never knew -- they knew it\u2019s going -- what\u2019s\ngoing on some, but they didn\u2019t see people with numbers in -- 1n -- in the people 1-I-\nlike we were -- I wasn\u2019t, but that wa -- a lot of them were terrible wild, and terrible -\n- you know, from little towns from -- in Poland, or from Germany, they didn\u2019t --\nthey didn\u2019t know how to behave, they didn\u2019t know -- they were like animals really.\nAnd so they used to come and look at us, at the zoo. A zoo. I-I\u2019m telling you, it was\nall kind of monkeys in the zoo. So, a couple came to the -- to the -- the -- we were --\nyou know, like in separate, but you could see from the other side, like they were --\nthey made like -- how you call it, you know, separate us from -- but you could see\nthrough the --",

I did everything,\nworks -- worked in factories, and work -- cleaned stairs, and worked every -- I -- the\nonly thing I wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t a street worker. Otherwise, I did everything. And I,\nsince 1996, and now -- now it\u2019s \u201999, I was alone with three children, and I worked\nin a bakery. I worked everywhere, in factories, in bakeries, and I put together a\npenny to a penny, because I knew that some -- and I made -- I married second time\nin 1970, just for a few -- for a year, and I found out that my second husband was\nmolesting his daughter, he was sleeping with his daughter, and I -- after a year, I --\nwe annulled the marriage.

She -- she was -- she was Gentile, but I knew the -- you know,\nwhere they lived, and we used to call her -- my mother\u2019s friend aunt, you know? So\nI know my aunts address and everything. So I called. I -- I wrote -- was writing\nletters to Poland, and I wrote a letter to my friend, a boyfriend in Poland, and -- and\nI ask him, please tell me if you saw somebody o -- from my family. So he -- it took\n-- and I call -- and I wrote to my mum -- mother\u2019s friend, so-called my aunt, and I\ncall -- and I re -- wrote to my brother\u2019s friend Bias, h-he didn\u2019t even answer me, but\nI called to Korba. He was a -- a artist -- a painter, and I called to them, and they --\nmy brother and father was there when they got my letter, and -- and she -- and they\nwere dancing, and they got all drunk, 1 -- because my brother and father, when the\nwar ended, they came to Gdansk -- to Danzig, a -- but -- but they came to see the\nfriends in our town, to Zamush, very far. And -- and so they -- they got the letter --\nshe got the letter, and they were dancing, and they were crying, and they were\ndrunk, and they -- and they wrote me a letter. I have still a -- a few letters, I don\u2019t --\nI can\u2019t find them now.

Your father, you brother,\nand your husband.\u201d And so that was how I found them. And after I -- they -- they --\nthey -- I wrote to -- they send me -- my mother\u2019s friend gave me their address where\nthey lived, and I wrote a letter to them, and they -- they wrote a letter to me.

That --\nthat\u2019s what I\u2019m alive, because a lot in Sweden died, a lot. In Sweden. Because they\nwere bones and skin, and they ate, and they -- nobody watched them, and you\nknow, and -- it -- it -- it -- not because they didn\u2019t h-have good there, too good let\u2019s\nsay. Too good because they ate too much, and they were dying like -- like flies. Oh,\nforbuden they say, for-forbidden is forbuden. That\u2019s the word.

He was in Lemberg as a --\nas a Gentile, and a Polack from our town came in, a policeman, and he saw my\nfather, and my father got white like this, and he t -- and my father had a store in -- in\nLemberg, so that this policeman, Polish policeman, saw my father turning white,\nand he turned around, and he said, \u201cLooft, don\u2019t be afraid. I didn\u2019t see you.\u201d In the\nwartime, okay? And he walked out of that store. So -- 1 -- 1 -- after the war, my\nfather used to go to church because he thought -- he -- he started saying, \u201cThey\ngoing to kill me.

I\nsaid, the Jewish Federation asking you what\u2019s your real name, and you don\u2019t want\nto tell them, because they going to kill me, I\u2019m afraid.

So he came to -- to celebrate Passover with the Jews, but outside he was\nafraid that they going to denounce him, and he\u2019s going -- they going to kill him,\nbecause they killed a lot of Jews in -- in Poland after the war. Polack -- Polish\npeople. They made pogroms, and they killed them. My brother came to sell\nsomething what belonged to us, a house, and this, and -- and they told him, if you\nnot going to leave here -- from here, you know what\u2019s going to happen to you. So\nmy brother left, okay\u2019? So that\u2019s the truth, what I\u2019m telling you.

I was sick,\nand she took care of my children on the boat because I was very sick on the boat,\ncoming from France to here. Because I had to go to France from Israel, and for\nFrance, I came to Halifax, to -- to calif -- to Canada. And so I -- she took care, and\nwe became the best friends, til she died here. She got married, then she married -- to\nCalifornia, and she died. And we were the best friends. She was an -- a Ukrainian\nlady, she was -- she had cancer. So I came here, to Canada, because it was a lot of\ngreenhorns, you know, coming from all over, to ba -- Canada was a easy country to\ncome in. After the war they let us in. Here, they didn\u2019t let us in. They didn\u2019t want to\neven the little children let in, okay? So there, they let us in, and we came all to\nthere. From there, we start, you know, working where you want to go, where you\ngon -- really want to live. I want to live in Canada. I loved Canada. They were nice,\nand you know, the -- the people were very nice to you, and they -- even the -- the\nFrench Canadian, we didn\u2019t have anything to do with them, but they didn\u2019t know\nJuif, or -- or -- or Jew. No, they didn\u2019t. They just were nice to each other. We were -\n- we were like -- more like in Europe in Canada. Then, you see, they have -- like I --\nI -- I was two years ago, when my father -- brother died, I -- I -- I used to go -- ina\nyear I was five times in Montreal. So -- because he was very, very sick, he\u2019s had\nliver cancer.

Only my father I buried in\nMontreal. Me, when they say, \u201cWhy are you want to be cremated?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause\nI don\u2019t want it -- my mother was a young woman, and she -- who knows where her\nbones is. I want to be cremated like all the Jews were.\u201d Okay? That\u2019s not a sin, to be\ncremated. They -- the Jews, the very religious Jews said it\u2019s a sin [indecipherable],\nbecause you have to be buried in Jewish religion. And I said it\u2019s not true. I -- if th --\nif they could be -- I don\u2019t know where they ashes are, what am I different? That I\u2019m\nalive? I\u2019m not. It\u2019s not alive, it\u2019s live with the deaths, all my life.

Okay, so why should I be better than anybody else? I can be cremated. I\ndon\u2019t have to -- they not going to come to my grave anyway. Because one lives\nhere, and one there, they not going to -- I, when I come to Montreal, I go to my\nfather. When I was in Montreal, my -- my brother was dying, I went to my father\u2019s\ngrave, and I said, \u201cFather, please, have mercy on -- take him already, because he is\nsuffering terrible.\u201d And he listened to me, I suppose.

And I don\u2019t hate\nher, I just want her to behave, and to do what\u2019s -- it\u2019s right. He said, \u201cYeah, you\nwould like the hand on her, to -- to discipline her.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not? She needs\ndiscipline.\u201d",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. I am not interested in politics, I -- I don\u2019t like what sometimes d --\ndemocrats are doing, sometimes the republic -- I like the democrats, because they\nare for old people, and they are really care, and -- and the -- the republican is for the\nrich people. I am a poor person, I like the democrats But I am in -- in -- Iam -- [am\nnot a politician, they are politicians. They work for me, and for you, and for\neverybody. So w-w-what am I going to do? Nothing. I say sometimes it\u2019s not right,\nit\u2019s a -- they shouldn\u2019t -- they shouldn\u2019t take away this, and they shouldn\u2019t do this,\nand -- and they shouldn\u2019t look in in you private life, because it\u2019s not nobody\u2019s\nbusiness, okay? Nobody\u2019s business. Now it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- if you have stucked away\nsomething no -- they -- they know about it. That\u2019s right. You can\u2019t -- you -- you\nused to say this is for my -- for my rainy day. But they know about everything,\nbecause the banks are the government. Am I right? You can\u2019t say nothing.",
        "A: I-I know, you -- you -- you -- you -- you don\u2019t, but I am saying, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s p-\npriv -- they took -- I -- I loved America, and I still do, because it was a free country.\nIt\u2019s not any more. It\u2019s not free. Not -- I don\u2019t mean free the money, you have to\nwork for ev -- everywhere for -- to make the money. Some is lucky, some are not\nlucky. I -- I worked very hard my life. So I made -- I -- I -- Iam lucky that I made\nsomething for my old age. I am lucky because I put it away. I stacked it away, every\npenny. And -- and -- and I was happy, oh, I have 10,000 dollars to put into the bank.\nCan you imagine? It -- it -- it -- it was unbelievable, but I was happy, and -- and it\nwas a free country. Now, whatever -- you can say anything, you can do anything,\nand -- and -- and -- and they -- they said in canda, y -- I come in, \u201cWhat is your\nsocial security?\u201d They know everything about me. That\u2019s not right. Y-Y-You -- you\n-- you -- you do -- do -- does the government have to know when I\u2019m going to the\nbathroom\u2019?",
        "A: The -- the government has to know what I\u2019m doing 1-1f I eat today. They don\u2019t --\nthey don\u2019t give you, but they want to take. And that wasn\u2019t before. No way. That\nwas a beautiful, beautiful country. You made whatever you made, and you didn\u2019t\ntake from them, and you didn\u2019t ask for nothing. What else can somebody ask? I was\nlucky.",

        "A: I -- I -- I -- I would like to say I\u2019m not a politician, that the politics -- the politics\nare too much in this country. Too much for us. For older people -- they should take\nmore care of the older people, how they live. They live in the streets. I don\u2019t like to\nsee the homeless. I don\u2019t like -- they look to -- to help other countries with the\nchildren, how about the children in America? They should help the children in\nAmerica, because it\u2019s plenty of children hungry, and plenty of the -- of the streets,\nand plenty give -- make -- giving sex for money, because they need the money. And\nplenty of them dying of -- of AIDS, because they -- they have to live, tho -- the --\nthey don\u2019t care who they sleep with. This has to be taken care in America. I am not\na politician, I am only an old lady, but I see what\u2019s wrong. And this 1s not right.\nWhy are you helping Honduras, or whatever in there, or koso -- Kosovo, that\u2019s a\nvery tragic ti -- th -- you have in here, first you have to feed your own in the house,\nand then look behind you. Because if you full, then you look for something else to\ndo, to help somebody else. Am I right?",
