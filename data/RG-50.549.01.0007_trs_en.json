        "Question: Erwin Baum interview in Riverdale, New York, and December fifth. Well, first\nperhaps -- let's go back just a little bit to, if you could talk a little bit about the\ncircumstances leading up to the time of, of the liberation. What was, what was\nhappening to you at that time in, you know, '44, '45\u00b0?",
        "Answer: While in camp, or prior to the camp?",
        "Q: In the camp. Why don't we start, start just talking about when, your arrival in the camp\nand a little bit, if you tell me, just give me a little bit of a sense what that experience was\nlike on a day-to-day basis.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, approximately in the Fall of 1942, | was transported from ghetto to\nAuschwitz concentration camp -- | arrived with my mother, my sisters and my two\nbrothers -- where, at the time of arrival, men and women were separate immediately and\nwhen it came to select, to separate men, to put them in the right places, me and my two\nbrothers were approached by the, by the German officer. He pointed my brothers to\none side and me to another side. Within twenty or thirty minutes, | found myself\nstanding with all the men and young children. On the other hand, on the other side, |\nsaw where my brothers were, were about 45 young men. Something told me that | am\nin the wrong spot, | didn't like where | am, | didn't know why. When the soldier passed\nErwin Baum 2\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 2\nme by, | just ran across to where my brothers were. Later on, about 45, 50 boys were\nordered to kind of slow running, jogging, went into Auschwitz. On the spot where | was,\nthey went all to crematorium, they were gassed. So did my mother, my sisters. At that\ntime, there were no women needed for labor, so all the women were gassed from that\nparticular transport. When | arrived in Auschwitz, | was the youngest of the camper -- of\nabout 18,000 inmates,\u2019 and | was the youngest.",
        "Q: You know, in, in seeing the videotape and reading the transcripts, I, | was struck over\nand over again by that you seem to -- had a, had a sharp instinct for when there was\ntrouble or when to take advantage of a situation -- you know -- such as that, such as that\nyou were in this one place and you felt like something was wrong and so...",
        "A: There are a few, few moments like that you mention, in my life, kind of miracles. For\ninstance, prior to arrive in the camp, as it is well known that | was raised by Dr. Janusz\nKorczak? in the orphanage, where | spent some years. Many times, while German\noccupation on the ghetto, | had the chance to go out of the ghetto, over a wall or by a\ncertain tube or by the way of a sewer, to go to the Polish side, where | did not look very\nmuch Jewish and | spoke very clear Polish, and the doctor used to give me a few zlotys\n' During 1942, there were some 24,000 prisoners in Auschwitz.

And also | was torn apart, | didn't know whether to be with\nmy mother, my whole family was hungry, or be with the children. So sometimes | spent\nnights with, with my mother, where also during the night | used to go over the gate to the\nPolish side and buy loaves of bread, throw over the gate, throw over the wall to my\nmother; she used to sell it. What | want to bring out, that one particular night when it --\nthey decided to evacuate the orphanage, to take the childrens to Treblinka, to gas\nchambers?, | was out of that ghetto, particularly that night. So, that happened to be what,\none of the miracles that happened in my life, that | was not there at that night. When |\narrived in there in the morning, the whole orphanage was gone, although | tried to join\nthem and | was chased away by police that said, \"You're not Jewish, get lost.\" There\nwas another, another instinct while in concentration camp. If one was quite awhile in\nconcentration camp, you got known and if the -- a good job, a good kind of opportunity\ncame along, naturally the older inmates got priority. So | had a good job. | was working\nin a, in a place sorting clothes and while you sort clothes from the people that arrive\nfrom, from, from, from Poland to Holland, to -- or France, you always found an extra bite,\nsomething to eat. So | was pretty content. One day this German woman, a Nazi,\nuniform, I'll never forget her name, her name was Berta, she was wearing these leather\n3 On August 6, 1942, Korczak, the orphanage staff, and some 200 children were sent to Treblinka\nconcentration camp in Poland.

Upon\nthat, a request came from a camp that they need a few hundred men to build certain air\nstrips. It was kind of emergency and they called the blockaltester*. From that barrack,\nhis name was Heinz, a young man, he got along with me very good and he put me on\nthe transport. | was very angry. | didn't Know why is he sending me away, when | have\nit good, when | have, | was not hungry. Well, | couldn't help it, my number was given\nand | had to go. Later on, when evacuation started, when the allies were approaching\nthis concentration camp... all those camp were naturally liquidated, and | met up with\nthis guy, with Heinz. | says, \"I'll never forget you, Heinz. Why, why did you do it to me?\"\nHe says, \"Bubi\" -- he used to call me \u201cbubi>\u201d -- \"you know, you wouldn't be alive now.\" |\nsays, \"What do you mean?\" \"Remember Berta? Remember she took your number\ndown? Do you know why?\" | says, \"No, why?\" \"She wanted to make a bag and a pair\nof gloves out of your skin.\" Naturally, | was shook up very much and then, then | was\ngrateful to him. So there was another miracle in my life.",
        "Q: So where were you, where were you, where were you at the time of liberation?\n4 Block elder (German).\n> little boy, laddie (German).\nErwin Baum 9)\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 5",
        "A: At the liberation, | was liberated in a concentration camp called Allach near Dachau,\nnear, near Munich.",
        "Q: You had been transported to?",
        "A: | was transported fr... to many, many camps. From camp to camp, from camp to\ncamp, because, as | said, the Germans were building little air strips, so always a few\nhundred men were in a certain, out of a village, like they had a, they had a shack made\nout of metal and they kept us there. But on the last days of war, like maybe it's known\nalready to you that they put all the inmates on a dead march, and | was among also\nthem, a dead march. We were marching and marching and marching and marching,\nthousands of, of people, of men, thousands of them, and everyday there were less and\nless and less and less. They left a certain time, | don't remember, a few weeks, after\nmarching once, they told us to sit down and have our break. It was no coffee break, by\nall means, they gave us a few cold potatoes to eat and then they said, \"Okay, let's go.\"\nWell, like the message passed from one to another, nobody would get up anymore.\nLike it was senseless, no use. So they got very angry and they ordered us to go up the\nhill and go against the trees and hands up. They said that they wanted to, to execute\nand also they gave the order, the, the high rank officer gave the order the soldiers, like\n\u201caim at the neck.\u201d And we heard that the guns -- you know, whatever they had to do --\nwe heard that noise and we keep our hands up and we wait and wait and wait and wait\nErwin Baum 6\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 6\nand nothing happens, and then we hear one soldier looking through his binoculars said,\n\"Mine God, four kilometers from here are the Americans.\" We heard that, and we stay\nand naturally you stay so long with your hands up, you get a little tired, so you kind of,\nwe kind of look back a little bit and we saw no more Germans. So we drop our hands,\nwe turn around, no Germans. So naturally we run down the hill, and believe it or not the\ntanks and trucks were rolling and we ran and, \"Please, please, take us, take us, take\nus.\" Unfortunately, they had other orders than to take us and they passed by, they left\nus there, and the Germans came back and took us again. Took us again, put us in that\ncamp and then not long we were liberated. We were liberated in, as | told you, in Allach\nwhen the allies came in, naturally they came in, they make pictures and everybody was\nrunning and asking, making motions with their hands for food, because we didn't know\nhow to speak English. And they said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" but nothing happened, there\nwas nothing there, and by that time the Germans left us a few days before. They were\nafraid and we were kind of sorry because like this, everyday we got a little bit whatever -\n- we got. But like us, for three, four days, we got nothing, and the allies came and still\nthere's nothing. But I, as | was used to sneak around and hassle to find always an extra\nbite, | went up on a -- it's bigger than a Jeep, kind of a little -- little truck, and | was\nlooking, looking and | found and | ate a full box of what | thought it was chocolate and |\nate a box of Ex-lax. | didn't know, | was happy, | found chocolate, | ate it and you could\nimagine what happened to me. I, | got very, very, very in bad shape, pain, and | walked\nErwin Baum 7\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 7\nout of that, of that camp and there was this, on the road there was the field kitchen that\nthe soldiers were fed, and | went and | was crying, \"Pain, pain, pain,\" and there was one\nAmerican soldier of Russian descent and he spoke a little kind of broken Polish, and |\ntold him that I'm so sick. So he put me in his car, in, in his Jeep, and drove me to town\ncalled Muhldorf, put me in a hospital. They put me in a hospital. Oh, that was beautiful.\nThey fed me a Farina with milk and sugar for about two weeks, and I, | just walked out\nof the hospital and went on my own. | went on my own and went into a little, a little\nvillage called, it was Muhldorf, | forgot the name, and | met with two other friends from\nconcentration camp and there were, and, and on a, on a farm with two German older\nsisters and they just, they thought that they have to take in, anybody that comes in they\nhave to take in and take care of them.",
        "Q: Why? Because they, they think it was just the right thing to do or...?",
        "A: Yeah, they didn't know, they thought that's the order, that the Germans, for them to pay\nback, they have to take care of, of people that were in the camp. Ampfing, that's the\nname, Ampfing, yeah. And we went to them and they took care of us, we ate and drank\nand they did our clothes. We were there for several months. We got on our feet, then\nwe decided to go to big town, to, to Munich.",
        "Q: What were you doing during those several months? These are the first couple of\nmonths after the whole experience, then...\nErwin Baum 8\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 8",
        "A: Well, right away we had an idea of doing business. In the -- in this little village,\nAmpfing, there was a forest and there was also a concentration camp called the\nWaldlager. In there, they were producing parts for airplanes, cyclically, and there were\nthose, many, many of those electrical mo...motors left. So we used to go in there, take\nmotors and sell to the farmers in exchange for a cow or -- and, and, and we took that\ncow or a calf or a sheep, we slaughter it and we used to sell the meat to those camps\nthat were set up by, by, by the UNRRA\u00ae camps, and made, made some money and...",
        "Q: But still, | mean, after you had, you had been in the ghetto and then been in, in\nAuschwitz-Birkenau and then, | mean that was a long period of time and this was the\nfirst point at which you were freed from those kind of stresses on your life. What was\nthat experience like, those first couple of months? Were you elated or did it seem...?",
        "A: Well, those first few of months, why did we do those business, that kind of business,\npreparation, storage, buy food, put away, all in, in our mind was only not to be hungry,\nanymore. That's why we didn't want to wait, many of us, we didn't want to wait to get a\nhandout, to wait from the UNRRA to give us something. | mean the first money came to\nmy pocket and the first bakery | saw, | must have bought about thirty loaves of bread,\nand put it away. That was, you know, only in our mind, nothing else, nothing else\nmattered till later on, start, you know, we start to relive the whole bitter experience, try to\nlook if anybody was left of the family, or whatever. And we came to Munich and got\ninvolved in business, doing business with, with the Germans, or with the Americans,\nkind of start, start, start a new life again. Till one day, | met somebody and | saw a\nnumber. By the number, we could identify which transport or which camp that person\nwas, and | saw this number and | knew that he was in one of the camps where | was,\nwhich is Buna, and my brother was there. So | ask him, \"You must have been in Buna.\"\nHe says, \"Sure, | sure was.\" \"Did you happen to know Icek Baum?\" He says, \"Sure, |\nknow him. Here's his address. He survived. He's in Czechoslovakia.\" Now, you can\nimagine how | felt. Immediately, | ran to a, to a translator that wrote a letter to the\ngovernment of Czechoslovakia and I'm looking, looking for this person. Unfortunately,\nthe answer came that \u201cNo one like this is known by the name.\u201d During that time, my\nbrother Icek -- and there's my older brother who wind up in Belgium, he was liberated\nsomewhere and they went to Belgium -- thank God they found each other, and they\nwere writing letters to each other and crying over my death. In the meantime, | was a\n\u00ae United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.\nErwin Baum 9\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 9\nhustler. | was successful in Munich. | was the first boy who could have a car, you know,\n| put a pillow under my seat so girls could see me and | was doing pretty well, and they\nwere crying over me. But that never gave me any rest, that he told me my brother, and,\nand, and then | gave up hope. | said, \"Well, must have been a mistake or something.\"\nWell, one day my brother Icek from Czechoslovakia decided to join up with his brother in\nBelgium. So he had to leave Czechoslovakia, come to Germany and somehow go to\nBelgium. On the train going to, going to Munich, he met up with a girl and says, \"Why\ndon't you accompany us to our camp?\" And so he spent sometime with her. She says\n\u201cOkay.\u201d On the train station, he meets again the same person who told me that my\nbrother was alive. He says, \"Did you find your brother?\" \"Oh, come on, | have no\nbrother.\" He says, \"Yes, you have a brother. He's got a golden tooth, wavy hair.\" Now,\nagain, my oldest brother that did not survive had the golden tooth and wavy, wavy hair.\nBut that didn't matter. But he brought them next day to me, you know, to Munich and |\njoined up with Icek and | says, \"Edyl didn't survive.\" He says, \"What do you mean, he\ndidn't survive? He's in Belgium.\" So then, somehow, we got together, all three. | was\nvery happy. Me, me and my brother Icek went to Belgium to be with my, with my, with\nmy other brother, and we were in a home not, not doing much. But that didn't give me\nany rest. | used to go over the border, forth and back, back and forth to, to Germany, do\na little business, and then one day | was caught on the border, you know, and Belgium\ngave me a deportation. | had to leave Belgium. So, somebody took me over to\nLuxembourg. | went to Luxembourg and while | was in Belgium, somebody from my\nhometown, from Warsaw, approached me. He says, \"Hey, you're 19 years old, you're\njust walking the streets, not doing nothing. Why don't you come to my place down, I, |\nhave a fur shop. | put you down by the machine. If you learn the trade in two weeks,\nyou have a job and you can make something.\" | says fine. So, | learned the trade and it\nwas very useful, because when | went to Luxembourg they gave me a job by a furrier\nand | was working there, and then the war broke out in Israel and my brother from\nBelgium decided to go as a volunteer. So | figured, my brother's going, what I'm going\ndo all alone here? | went to Israel also, as a volunteer and became a Navy man.",
        "Q: Can we just go back and ask you; I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I'm curious as to -- you're this young man, in,\nin Munich, say, and right after the war -- 19, 20 early 20s. What was life like there for\nyou at that time? | mean, you know, were you, were you -- you Say you, you were\ninterested in meeting women or were you hang...hanging out with friends or did you --\nErwin Baum 10\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 10\nwho were you, who were you -- what kind of social at...atmosphere was there at that\ntime?",
        "A: Well, we had an apartment. Sure, | was interested, | was interested in girls and we had\na maid in the house. You know, we used to socialize. We used to go out, there were\nconcerts and, as | told you, | had a car and | couldn't register the car because there was\nthat gasoline business. So | went to the, to the office of the Israel -- it was the Palestine,\nyou know, Palestine consul -- and they had doctors to be driven around from camp to\ncamp to, to check out the children, were they in good condition to eventually immigrate\nto Israel. | mean | was busy that | had my little world around me.",
        "Q: Who were the other members of that world and...",
        "A: Well, only, only us survivors. Only us survivors. We only mingled with the survivors,\nand then, naturally, started a business, buying American dollars, buying diamonds,\nbuying watches, exchanging, doing this and that. Purpose, there was no purpose. We\ndidn\u2019t know -- just for the moment, to have a comfortable life. \u2018Til, \u2018til | went to Belgium\nand then to Luxembourg and then to Israel, where | joined the Israeli Navy, also as a\nvolunteer.",
        "Q: Was it, was it worth -- was it chaot... were, | mean you told me the story about you and\nyour, your finding your brothers. | mean there must have been -- everybody, all of your\nErwin Baum 11\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 11\nfriends -- must have had those stories of trying to find people and it seems like it must\nhave been chaotic.",
        "A: Oh, it was very, very chaotic. Very, very, very emotional. | mean, it was, it was\nunbelievable. It took about a year and a half to find them, you Know. And while my\nbrother was in Belgium, | got some connection with somebody who had connection with\nthe Belgian consulate in Munich, and that man, that consulate gave to that man a list of\nnames of people that did not survive. So we used that opportunity, because people\ndidn't want to stay in Germany, Munich. They wanted to go. United States didn't open\nup the doors, yet. Canada, nothing happened. To Israel, nobody could go. So if there's\nopportunity to go somewhere, they wanted to go. So for 200 dollars, | was able to get\nan ID, piece of paper with a picture ID on the name of the person who perished in\nBelgium, and he could go home. So that person arrived in Belgium and Belgium the\nHIAS changed and gave him some, some papers. So we, we had the world and then,\nas when my turn came, | went to Belgium.",
        "Q: What was it like being in, in Germany af...after the war? | mean, did you, were you,\nwere you angry at the Germans?",
        "A: Oh, we were, we were, we were very an... very, very angry. But, what, what can | tell\nyou? We were very, very rough, very arrogant in, in the beginning. Like we went on a\ntrain and they ask for a, for a train ticket. We used to say, \u201cHitler paid already.\u201d We\nErwin Baum 12\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 12\nnever stood in line -- like, like taking advantage of the situation. But after awhile, we\ncalmed down. We calmed down, because we say, \u201cHey, what's the use, after all, you\ncannot blame the whole, the whole nation for it. Here, now, the Nazis, | thought were\narrested and taken care of, and the children of them are regretting, and then they're\nfeeling with us, they're nice to us.\u201d So you know, they try to brainwash us, and as a\nyoung person, from bad to good, you got kind of a little bit brainwashed and, and, and\ncalmed down, you know.",
        "Q: What do you mean brainwashed?",
        "A: That they say, \u201cIt's not my fault, | didn't know, my daddy, you know, it was very bad, he\nwas forced into it. He didn't mean to do it. If he wouldn't join the Nazi party, he would\ngo also to concentration camp.\u201d And, and | saw these things happen because there\nwere certain times where, where SS soldiers were brought to concentration camp for not\nfulfilling the orders that they received. | didn't know exactly what the orders were. Like\none very high rank officer came to concentration camp and he was stripped of the\nuniform, put on concentration camp uniform, shaved the head, and we had to speak to\nhim. He says, \"Well, | was a very high rank officer and | came home on vacation and\nmy wife and the children were deported to a camp.\" He says, \"Why?\" Because\napparently, his wife's grandfather descended from a gypsy. So that made her also a\ngypsy, they put in concentration camp. So he came back, he says, \"Who am | fighting\nErwin Baum 13\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 13\nfor?\" You know, so he came to concentration camp. So, this way the Germans of the\nwar made us believe somehow that they were not completely to blame, that they were,\nwere brainwashed, that, that circumstances brought them to that.",
        "Q: And yet, it seemed reasonable at the time?",
        "A: | mean, | was reasonable, because after all, |, | didn't read any books. | wasn't that my --\nthat much educa...educated. After the war, | didn't feel like going back to school and,\nyou know, | wanted to roam around, to drive my car, to show off, go to dancing, be with\ngirls, and my dream was to have a beautiful blue suit with white stripes. It was\nimpossible to get it, but somehow | got it. So like after the war, whatever | wanted, it\ncame to me, it fell into my lap, very easy. So | stopped thinking ab...about the past. |\nmean, it happened, it's unrepairable and when | found my two brothers, | was very, very,\nvery, very happy and we kind of started a new life again. And as | said, the war broke\nout in Israel and my brother went. | says, \"What am | sitting here in Luxembourg?\nThere's no future here. | go to Israel.\" And | went to Israel and then | went to the, to the\nIsraeli Navy as a volunteer.",
        "Q: Why did you, why did you decide to...did you have strong militant feelings about...?",
        "A: Not militant, | had the feeling for a Jewish state, for a Jewish state, that's Israel you\nknow, that's all | knew. Because the camps, the UNRRA camps that | used to visit, you\nknow, and all the girls, | used to socialize with a beautiful girl, and she says, \"Oh, I'm not\ngoing to stay here. I'm not going to.\" Because people used to make, start making\nErwin Baum 14\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 14\napplications to go to United States, you know, had to wait for a quota. And people say,\n\"I'm going to Eretz, I'm going to Eretz Israel\u2019, I'm going to Eretz Israel.\" And here, war\nbreaks out and the word came around that young men should go to Israel to, to defend\nthe country. So what was | then, 21 or 22, \u201cWhat am | sitting here, sitting in\nLuxembourg? I'm with people that I, that | don't know, all alone, and | have a brother\nthat came up from concentration camp. | want to be with him.\u201d So | went to Israel, then\n| was in the Navy and | met my wife, got married -- while | was in the Navy, a beautiful\nwedding -- and the war ended and then they had to liberate me because it was not\naliyah\u00ae, was just a volunteer. And then | got angry in Israel.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: Well, when I, when | got married and then | finished the army, | needed some work. |\nneeded something, so | used to go to the authorities and say, \"It would be fair to give me\na little help. I'm here, | came, | fought, | did my duty.\" And, \"Well, nobody ask you to\ncome.\" And | -- my ego, you know. So | said, \u201cIn that case, | would kindly ask for an --\nyou needed an -- exit visa.\u201d So, took a while and | got an exit visa and | with my wife we\nreturn to Belgium. By then, | couldn't get any more help from, from, from the HIASY,\nbecause | left once. They wouldn't help me, so | was...by the way, | came into Belgium\nnot legal, just with a transit for three months and | used to have to be -- have to -- had to\nhide out because the police was always chasing me. \"You have to leave, you have to\nleave, you cannot be here, cannot be here.\" But to Israel | didn't want to go back, to\nPoland | didn't want to go, so | made an application to go to United States or to Canada,\nwhatever comes first.\n\u2018land of Israel (Hebrew).\nErwin Baum 15\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 15",

        "A: Well, | met my wife through a, through a friend. We used to walk when we had our, our\nday off or a few hours off, we used to walk on a main street and there was a photograph\nshop and my wife's picture was there. So my friend went in there. He said, \"Who is that\ngirl?\" So, he introduced her, so they went out, and if one goes out, | was going with my\nfriend also, you know. So she kind of liked me better because my, my, my friend was a\nkind of little, little funny making, making jokes, throwing over garbage cans and all that,\nand | was more on the quiet side, so she liked me and she intro.. introduced him to her\ngirlfriend and we got married and, after, they got married.",

Yeah, build -- built houses and sold them and\nmade some nice money, and then | was approached by some distant relative of my\nwife, | should come to United States, that the, the opportunity would be better and there\nare many people that would invest because they saw my experience because if | started\na, a project, | was the first one to finish it, the first one to sell them. So they kind of like\nit. So | came to United States and it didn't turn out to be the way they said it's going to\nbe.

        "Q: How did it turn out not the way you thought it was, not the way they said it was going to\nbe?",
        "A: Well, instead of my benefiting from them, they wanted to benefit from me. For instance,\n| had to grab a bus, leave my wife and kid at home and come because a broker called\nand there's a piece of land available, | have to go and see it, so | left everything and |\ncame to see it. | drove around a whole week and | did what | had to do and Sunday --\neverybody -- we had -- were supposed to be full partners and then Sunday | had to go\nup and show them. \u201cSee, if we built here, we make you the garden apartments or two\nunits,\u201d this and that, and everybody gave their opinion, not knowing what they're talking\nabout. And that was going on for months and | -- even came a time when -- where in\nNew Jersey, | actually made deposits to purchase some land for garden apartments and\nErwin Baum 21\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 21\nagain, you know, back and forth, back and forth. So one day | called a meeting. | says,\n\"We are here, four partners. We are ready to invest about 100,000 dollars.

But somehow |\nhad to come to this country, so the only way was to clear the Labor Department. So |\nbought with somebody a little luncheonette. | thought it would be for a short time, so\nthat | clear the department. So | came here, took me two years, until finally | got my\ngreen card, and | got stuck in that luncheonette for six years.",

        "A: | owned the luncheonette, yes.",
        "Q: Where was it?",
        "A: On one, on Hudson Street, near the printing, near the Holland Tunnel, the exit of the\nHolland Tunnel. So | was stuck there for six years. It was the worst six years of my life,\n| must say, as a free man. | had to get up three o'clock in the morning and work and\nwork and work and work, and finally | said if I'm not going to sell it, I'm going to burn it. |\nErwin Baum 22\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 22\nwas so fed up. So finally in 1972, | was lucky to sell it and then my brother-in-law was in\nRussia and they married off their daughter and | always wanted to go, and like before |\nalways, my dream was to go on a cruise. So | remember | was signing the papers\nFriday to sell the store. Saturday morning, | still had to go to the accountant to iron out\nsome things and then a telephone call came in and they say there are two spots for 499\ndollars on a cruise, you can go if you can make it by one o'clock. | made it, we went on\nthat cruise, it was very nice.",
        "Q: Where, where did you go?",
        "A: To the, to Nassau, to the Bahamas. It was very nice, and then | went to Russia to\nattend the wedding of my brother-in-law's daughter. And what else did | do? And then\ngot enrolled in a, in a soap distribution. | used to sell cleaning products, and finally |\nwent downtown and | saw the way that people are dressed, the people -- young, young\nkids. It gave me an idea to start an antique clothing store, clothing from forties and\nthirties, and | open up that store and since I'm a furrier, | was handling also furs.\nBecame quite successful and | was able to purchase the building and was doing\nfinancially, financially very nice and at home, things weren't that great.",

        "A: | did, | didn't know that my wife is looking for her physical satisfaction somewhere else. |\ndidn't know. | thought she doesn't need men, she's cold.

She has two children now.\nAbout 1987, my wife met a, a person who was homeless. | mean, partially, practically\nhomeless.

And she used to convince my wife that it's all right to see other\npeople, you know, kind of help her, bringing her up to some, to some, to some point,\nand at the same time tried to take money from her. \u201cBorrow me here, borrow me there,\nborrow me here,\u201d and \u201cdon't worry, do what you have to do, I'll take care of him.\u201d And\nshe was so shrewd, she convinced her. She brainwashed her and you know, but | didn't\nlike her, her...",
        "Q: And she was living in the apartment?",
        "A: That's right and | didn't like her mouth. Very, very bad mouth, so one day | wrote her a\nletter that if -- that she should leave us, leave our life and go, you know, and at that time\nwhen my, when my, my daughter left for, for California, | had the relapse. Because in\n1983, | had a car accident and | had a disc, a herniated disk, but with exercise, and | fell\nErwin Baum 24\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 24\ninto a depression when my daughter left me. And when | told this woman to go, she\nstart begging me, \u201cdon't, don't.\u201d My wife says, \"Leave her alone, leave her alone, she's\nokay, you know, she helps out.\" | didn't know that my wife is using her as a cover-up, as\na cover. Well, then when she pumped out from my wife whatever she could, she went\nto work on me, you know. \"Oh, you're so nice, your wife is going to Florida, everything\nis fine, no worry, she cooked for me, she made me meals,\" and all that, and she says,\n\u201coh you're like my father and | give my life for you,\" and blah, blah, blah, talk and talk\nand talk a lotta nonsense. But one day she says, \"Do you ever cheat on your wife?\" |\nsays, \"No | don't.\u201d Why? Because, well, | had a complex because my wife used to\nreject me, so | didn't have the, the, the, the courage to approach other women, because\n| couldn't stand rejection. So | said, \"No, | don't do it,\" and, and we left it at that. And\nthen again, and again, and again, when she couldn't take anymore money from my wife,\nshe started, \"Oh, | need an apartment, | need this, you help me.\" Okay, so | helped -- a\nfew hundred dollars here, a few hundred dollars there, and then she dropped, when she\nsaw the moment is ripe, you know, that | am so depressed, she dropped a bombshell on\nme. She says, \"You never cheat on your wife?\" | says, \"No, does she?\" She says,\n\"Yeah. You know this and this guy?\" \"Well, | think | do.\" And she told me, let's go, let\u2019s\ngo, let\u2019s go to a detective office and | Know exactly when and where she can be caught\nwith this man. And she used to take telephone and put my wife together with that man.\n| mean, she plotted the whole thing. And, naturally, | go to this detective and | give a\nErwin Baum 25\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 25\ndeposit, and she tells him exactly when and where -- they get caught. They get caught,\n| got grounds for divorce. Right? | got grounds for divorce. But here, I'm a wealthy\nman. See? So she says, \"She's going to take everything away from you. Why don't\nyou transfer it to me?\" Transfer the building, you know, and make promises\neverywhere, \u201cI do it for him because of my love and whenever he wants it I'll give it back\nto him,\u201d you know? And she says, | says, \"I want to make a settlement. Give her so\nmuch and so much to my wife.\" She says, \"No, no, no. You'll give her as little as\npossible and leave the rest to me.\" Anyway, she manipulated my brain, she\nmanipulated her brains and | was then under so much depression | used to take\ntranquilizers, Xanax, you know? And whenever | got depressed, she even had these\npills in her bag and she used to give me, just to keep me calm. And she dragged me to\na lawyer. Naturally, | signed over everything, you know, with a promise she is going to\ngive it back to me, just because she put my wife on the telephone and she spoke to her\nand | heard her say, \"Oh, okay. If he's going to find out, gonna to be divorced. I'm going\nto take everything and find myself a young lover and live my life.\" She prepared all that\nand | should hear it. So, of course, that aggravated me. So, | didn't want that to\nhappen, that she should get everything. Whatever stocks she had, she made her sell\nand give me a check. I'm telling you, she took the building and hundreds of thousands\nof dollars and all that, and she was nice to me. She gave me a few years that | never\nhad in my life. Actually the divorce went through. Right? She gave me, you know, and\nErwin Baum 26\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 26\nalways money here, money there. And when the money start, you know, there was\nnothing much to give, she kind of pulled off and she looked somewhere else. So here\ncomes along a woman friend that we knew together, that is in the process of dying, you\nknow, of cancer. And so she went to work on her. \"Oh, I'm gonna to be for you here.\nI'm gonna to help you.\" This and that, and that poor woman had a, had a bad\nrelationship with her only son. She left with a second husband. For years, she couldn't\nget along with her son. However, her son has three children, very poor, and he made a\nbat mitzvah for her, for his daughter, and me and this person were invited and he didn't\nspeak to his mother. His mother was dying of cancer. He didn't speak to her. But there\ncome a moment when they were playing the hora, you know, dancing the hora. So he\nis -- the boy -- dancing the hora. | take his hand and his mother comes in. So | joined\nthe hands of his mother and the boy and | say, \"It's time.\" So they got together and start\ntalking, you know? But in the meantime this woman get sick. So this person, again,\nstart to brainwash this woman. \"Get away from your husband.\" Blah, blah, blah. \"I take\ncare of you.\" And so sh\u2014 this woman made her the executive, you know?",
        "Q: So, so you said, but you said before that there are, there were a couple of years that,\nthat it was okay, that\u2014",
        "A: | mean I, I, | accepted what she told me. | said -- |, | thought, \u201cWhat's the use having\neverything, everything on my name, she wants it on her name to protect from the other\none, shouldn't take it.\u201d So she gave me a few nice years. But when she met up with\nthis woman and this woman started, oh she started on this woman also, make her\nErwin Baum 27\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 27\nexecutive over the -- full power of attorney, take out money from here, from there,\neverything, everything and her, she let up on me. She started to neglect me completely\nand | wasn't happy because | saw then, | realize, | saw, and this woman used to fa\u2014 the\nsick woman used to fall into a coma. And one time she woke up, she says, \"Erwin, |\nhope she's not going to do to my son what she did to you.\" | said, \"What are you talking\nabout?\" And she went back. You know, apparently this woman saw something. And |\nsaw, look, she's making this woman sign this, and sign here, sign power of attorney and\ntake money and transfer from here, and transfer there, and make the boy give her\nmoney. | didn't like it, and here three months she neglects me. So | approached her\nonce, | says, \"Look here, it's nice to take care of the person, but you're neglecting me.\nYou're leaving in the morning, you come home three, four o'clock in the morning, five\no'clock and run back.\" | says, \"I don't feel good. |, |, | had chest pain and | had to go to\nemergency.\" She says, \"Well, I'm not going to worry about you now.\"",
        "Q: So, in, in, in the meantime she had control, had the control of all your money and...",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Well, and why | trusted her, people also ask me\nwhy | trusted her. My depression led to a heart bypass, to an operation. So | go to the\nhospital. My wife didn't have the time to go with me to the hospital, because she told\nher, \"It's okay, you don't have to go. I'll take care of him.\" Now, before | go down to\noperation, before | close my eyes, | don't see my wife, | see her. When | come out, |\ndon't see my wife, | see her. So, | mean that's how she plotted everything and that's\nhow she made me trust her in full. You understand? So now, go back to this woman\nand so...",
        "Q: | just was wondering about the, | was a little concerned about the [tape skippeed].",
        "A: This woman would argue back and forth. | says, \"Look, you always promised, whenever\n| want the building, whatever money | gave, | mean hundreds of thousands of dollars,\nErwin Baum 28\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 28\nnow | have nothing.\" | says, \"Just transfer the building back to me.\" Because she took\na big mortgage on the building also and messed it up. | took a mortgage of this\napartment | gave her. Now I'm responsible for it. She says, \"I'm not giving it back. I'm\nnot giving back nothing. | give, | gave you, | took care of you.\" Well, naturally | started a\nlitigation. | started a litigation and we came to a settlement that she, she will pay me for\nthe building like -- on the time of transaction, somebody advised her that it couldn't be\njust like this. She got to kind of make a sale, so 160,000 dollars, she gave me a second\nmortgage. | wasn't aware that it's so powerful. She says, \"The only thing you can get,\nyou can get payments on the mortgage.\" So, well, we agreed on that. She made a few\npayments and then she, she defaulted on payments. So now I'm in litigation again with\nher, and she's such a person so vicious, you know. Wha\u2014 on every sentence, there's\nthreat, she's threatening, oh, she'll do something, \u201cI'm going to destroy him, my mother,\nmy mother will come. She's going to make his family disappear.\u201d Threatening and\nthreatening and threatening. And that's where it's at now. | was a rich man and she,\nshe made me a poor man. She's holding everything and wouldn't give it back, and now\nwe're in litigation, and she took her mortgage and the bank is foreclosing on her also,\nbecause | put a sheriff to collect the rents, so there's no income.",
        "Q: Could you, could you tell me about -- | wonder if -- do you see any relationship between\nhow -- what happened with this person and the earlier events of, of your life? Perhaps\nErwin Baum 29\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 29\nin terms of what happened with you with, with the, the -- your relationship with your wife\nand, and, you know, you said that she, you felt that she was, she was cold and\u2014",

        "A: Well, | don't know about what happened with my earlier experiences, because | thought\nthat | was the happiest man in the world, you know, | was married for over forty years\nand | kept my wife on the pedestal, and in everybody's eyes we were the perfect couple,\nthe perfect example. Everything is nice, so maybe she, she had a fling here and there\nsomewhere, which is, | don't know, it might be, it might be natural, or not. But naturally, |\nwasn't happy at home -- very happy -- because she was not very attentive. Like | had to\ngo to a doctor for a, for a angiogram report. She did not have time to go with me. And\nthese little things bugged me very much and | felt an oppression. When | divorced her,\nyou know, and this one was here -- came to my life. | mean, | was treated like a king, |\nmust say.

Because now, it clears my puzzle, because when she just came into\nour life, she used to ask my wife if she could get 10,000 dollars. Because when she left\nEurope, she shipped a lot of antiques to San Francisco, which are in storage -- you\nknow -- and unless she gets it out, it will be auctioned off.

What do you think about your\nfather?,\" | ask her. So before she left, just scribble up on a little paper, to express\nfeelings about me. So that's how she did it.",
        "Q: So tell me about what, what you meant, that, that up until 80 -- late, mid -- late \u201880s that\nyou kept a\u2014?",
        "A: Couldn't, couldn't, couldn't, it was too painful. Couldn't talk, because many times, going\nback again to the, to the -- with this person and my wife, | used to -- even now | have\nnightmares, you know? It's never escapes my mind.

So | used to wake up and cried, | cried at\nnight, at sleep. My wife wouldn't come in. This person came in to wake me and calm\nme. And prior to that person, when she came to our life, my, my, my girl -- my daughter\nwas sleeping here and she heard me and she didn't know what's what, and that's how\nshe expressed herself here.",
        "Q: So your daughter would -- wasn't she, she wasn't aware that when she was growing up,\nthere was -- you know -- you were, you were still haunted by this experience? Or she\ndidn't know that you were going...?",
        "A: We didn't talk about it very much. But only later on when | used to have those\nnightmares. Because before this we lived in a two bedroom apartment somewhere else,\nshe has her own bedroom so she couldn't hear.

        "A: Well she, | don't know how she took it because she never expressed her feelings to me.\nBecause if you tell your story to somebody, it's to the other person, it's just like reading\na book. It doesn't affect you very much because you did not live it. You see, us,\nsurvivors, you know? I'm talking to you and somehow | can not touch upon the, the\nfeeling that it happened to me, you know? Because it was so tragic, so awful, what |\nwent through, that it's just humanly impossible to comprehend, you know? So it's just\nlike reading a book about somebody's experience. So you cannot expect anybody to\nhave any, any feelings about it. Only it's being bombarded to the minds now, second\ngeneration and third generation are getting, you know, the, the, the, the experiences of\nthe -- of their beloved is getting soaked into their, into their brains and, and the fear\nemerges, \u201cGod forbid it should happen to my children.\u201d because a teenager will not feel\nit unless they have their own children and start to be afraid of what will happen to their\nchildren.

        "Q: So at that, that point, when she became more aware that you had these experiences,\ndid she then start to ask you about it or, or...?",
        "A: It was no need, it was no need to ask because it became all of a sudden it became\nknowledge, you know? Television, papers, books, libraries, you know? And people, |\nmean the people that we were associating with, you couldn't escape, you know, you\ncould not have a conversation even up to day, you know. | go, even if | go see or\nsocialize, | go out to evening with American people, so what comes first to their mind?\nWhere are you from? Because of my accent. | tell them, well, to me, you are a refugee\nbecause you have an accent, you speak funny -- have an accent, oh, \"where are you\nfrom?\" \"Poland, Warsaw.\" \"Oh, my mother, oh my father, oh my uncle was in Warsaw.\nHow did you survive?\" So you cannot get away with it. It just lingers on and on and on\nand on. Like | talk to my psychiatrist. He says, \"You have to try to get away. | says,\n\"How?\" No matter where | go, | come to you, | speak about it. | go to my doctor. | sit\non, on a bus, on a subway, have a conversation about, about, about President Clinton,\nhow wonderful he is and about Mayor Giuliani\u2019, what a wonderful thing he did to, he\ndidn't let Arafat\u2019? to the party. \"Oh, where, where you from? | see that you're a\n\u2122 Rudolph W.

So there was never necessary to talk one on one to\nchild what happened to me, because | wouldn't want to lay it on her.",
        "Q: So, but you mentioned awhile ago that, that you thought that she -- the time when she\nbecame more aware of it was also the time when she had her own children.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Well, she, she, she became, she became aware and very protective of her children.\nGod forbid -- and, and her hope and prayer is that Holocaust should not be repeated.\nNot so much afraid of herself, as of the children.

        "A: Like in 1983, after that car accident, | was always in pain, always in pain, always in pain,\nand they tried everything on me and then figured that | need some therapy. So | went, |\nhad biofeedback and, and psychiatry and all that and, and it helps me. And then, you\nknow, taking those pills, those Xanax and Halcion, you know, they were bad stuff.",
        "Q: What did -- so wh...wh...when -- how did the therapist respond to\u2014",
        "A: Well, just talk and give me, give me some, some pills to calm me down, and | figured out\nthat the best healing you have to heal yourself, you know. | got fed up with going,\nbecause every time | go to therapist, | get all worked up, you know, and it comes back\nagain, the picture again, \u2018til the next visit.

        "Q: What do you mean? What, what can't you switch off?",
        "A: The memories, the haunting, | can't switch it off. You see, like it gets, it gets dark, you\nswitch a switch, a switch, a switch. You have light, you switch it off, it's dark. | cannot\ndo it in my, in my brains, you know, it's just there, it's just there. | just see this Bertha,\nthis woman pointing at me, you know, get his number down. | see this, this, this, this,\nthis, this Ukrainian with a, with a, with a brown uniform, waiting for me at the end of the\nroad with this branch, who got me here. Because we were, we were in ghetto. Out of\nWarsaw, my mother had two sisters in another part of town or a hundred kilometers\nfrom, from Warsaw, where the hunger was not so great and there was a little bit\npossibilities for food. But a lot of people found out and a lot of people came. So one\nnight, they ordered all the Jews out in the field in the ghetto and they said to produce an\nID card that you're a residents. My oldest brother, which is not alive, he succeeded to\nhave one because the president of the ghetto's daughter used to socialize with my\nbrother, so he fixed him a card. Comes me, my mother, my sisters, my brothers, we\ndidn't have it. So what happened? About, they made like a -- like about a hundred of\nthem here and a hundred of them here, standing on a row and everybody was back\nErwin Baum 41\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 41\nthere and everybody had a whip or a br...branch and who didn't have that ID card, had\nto walk through there, around through there, to a destination over there. One of my\nsisters and two brothers were so lucky that they were the first ones, so one soldier took\nthem and walked them through, without being beaten. So the other ones knew where to\ngo. Came the turn of my older sister, she got beaten up like don't ask. Came my turn, |\nwas small boy, | got a long coat, and | was running like a snake, you know? And almost\nat the end, there was one waiting for me and got me straight on my face, here. Actually,\n| had like, you know, swollen upper lip. It lasted about three days. No water even to\nwash it off. Lost my teeth and everything else. | mean all of those things, I...",
        "Q: Ha...has that -- did those things affect you as much when you were, when you were\nyoung or\u2014",
        "A: Of cour\u2014",
        "Q: ...back in the fifties when you first came\u2014",
        "A: It affects you\u2014",
        "Q: ...or you're away from Europe, you're in Canada?",
        "A: It affects me, Mr. Shapiro'\u2019, when | hear the Ukrainians speak. You know, when |\nhear the Ukrainian language, that's, you know, it affects me. Because they were worse\n'3 Benjamin Shapiro, interviewer.\nErwin Baum 42\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 42\nthan, than the Nazis and the Germans. The Ukrainians, the Croatians and naturally the\nPolacks, the Polish people, bad. Because of a Polish boy in concentration camp, | was\nhanged by my hands this way, 20 minutes, and it gave me a disc and up, up to this day |\nhave pain here. Because for us -- being good workers -- private, private, private people,\ntruck owners, when we put, very fast, stones on the truck, as many trips they made, they\nmade more money, used to give cigarettes to give to this commander, about 75, |\nguess. If there, if there were a few cigarettes left, my kapo, kapo, you know -- did you\nhear about the kapo? Gave me a name of somebody that passed away -- died -- so |\ncould go again and get the cigarettes. So | went again and this Polish boy says, \"Hey,\nhe was here already.\" You know, he was here. So | start to run and they caught me\nand they hanged me there.",
        "Q: So, so those -- but you said that you can't turn off the memories of those.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: Yes, they're always there, yeah.",

        "A: Well, | cannot, | cannot, | mean it's always there, more or less it's always there. You\nknow, a certain part of my life is now, five minutes something else can come about. All\ndepends of the, of the environment where | am. If | see, if | see, for instance, a river,\ncomes to my mind, oh yes, in Warsaw, Poland we were living not far from a river, you\nknow, and people used to pass by to play tennis and stop by, buy some candy, some\ncigarettes from my, from my mother. And then | see a small house, | remind myself of a\nlittle village where my aunt used to live, with a, with a straw roof. | used to go every\nErwin Baum 43\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 43\nsummer.

        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: Like ever...everything -- how can | express? Open up the TV. Most of, most of what\nyou see is shooting, right? So, | saw it everyday of my life.",
        "Q: So what is that...how does that...",
        "A: That brings me that | witness those sceneries -- that affects me. Hanging, you know, |\nremember. Why, why hanging? Because three men, one of them | knew very well,\nLeon Fo...Fox, he was working in the barrack of clothing, he distributed clothing. And\nbecause of the clothing, he could find for himself nice civilian clothes, and in the clothing\nhe'd find dollars and, and gold coins and he was able to bribe the SS to get him out of\nthe camp. So him and two others escaped. But Auschwitz was no such a thing as\nescaping. One day, two days, three days, four days, they caught \u2018em and brought \u2018em\nback. And here they hang \u2018em in front of everybody, you know? So when | see any\nhanging in a cowboy film, you know, that comes back.\nErwin Baum 44\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 44",

        "A: Well, | was successful of doing what | wanted to do, you know, even, even though in the\ncamp, even though in the camp.... When they put us to Auschwitz and there was\nRussian and there was hunger, so to me it was no big deal. What else is new? | was\nhungry before the war. Before | went to this orphanage, | was hungry. So here it was\nalready at least you guaranteed a few meals a day. Now, there were good days, there\nwere bad days in the camps. When there were good days, was fine. When it was bad\ndays, we used to talk. So they asked me -- they used to call me Bubi because | was the\nyoungest there -- \"Bubi what do you think? Are we gonna to survive? Are we going to\nmake it?\" | says, \"I will. | don't know, you.\" | had that in my mind, implanted somehow.\nWhen they put the numbers, swear to God, you know, | should have learned this from\nmy children, I'll talk to my brothers, \u201cYou know, we're gonna to show this in the United\nStates.\u201d | didn't even know if there is a United States. | thought there's Warsaw, there's\nErwin Baum 45\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 45\nPoland, that's it. | didn't even know. So | had that, how shall | say it? The foresight of\nsurviving, of getting out of it, you know?",
        "Q: Do you feel that you still, | mean especially given the troubles you've had recently, do\nyou still have a sense of that, that, of that foresight of survival, that you'll get through\nand...?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: Is that helpful to you still?",
        "A: Yes, it helps me to get through. You see, what a person did to me, you know? And,\nsomehow, | learned to live with it. Although I'm litigation, I'm going to get something out\nof it. | know | will. | Know | will survive, somehow. See, thanks God, I'm not in too poor\nhealth. I'm gonna to be 70 years old, you know. | have my daughter. | have my two\nbrothers. See, | don't know what to ask out of life more, because of what | didn't have.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: Like, like, like | say, | was hungry before the war. Now, thanks God, my refrigerator is\nfull of food, you know.

        "Q: Do you think that over the course of, of your life that you, that you, that you -- that hadn't\nmade -- you know, what you said about how you -- because you didn't have any food\nand that just having food, having food was enough and to be able to sustain yourself is\nenough...",
        "A: That was the dream in the camp. What was, what, what was our dream? Our dream --\nlike most of us, when there was a day off like Sunday, we didn't work, we were able to\nbe in camp. Outside the camp, we didn't see it. But while in camp, we saw the fire\nabove the chimney going very, very high, because of the fat of the human flesh. Not\nonly there was the, the, the -- how you call -- the, the smog, but the fire. And in people's\nmind, well, one day, what do you want before that happens? Enough bread, just bread\nto satisfy your hunger and then | don't care what happens. Like before they execute a\nperson, your last wish, that was our last wish. Now what | would, now what I, my only\nregret is, which I'm angry, why didn't my wife let me go 25 years ago? If | wasn't what\nshe wanted me, | could have remarried. My daughter always cried out, \"Why don't |\nhave a sister or a brother?\" | could have give her all that. That's my, that's my, that\u2019s\nmy pain. That's what I'm angry.

        "A: Why, why did he take away my, my beloved? | mean my father had to die, he was 48\nyears old, he was a sick man. The war broke out, my mother was only 50 years old.\nOne of my sisters had a little boy, two years old, | mean young. Why did he take \u2018em all\naway and left me with all this hurt, this feelings? And then | forgive him. Sometimes |\nhave not, then | forgive him. Well, somebody had to remain to, to, to tell the story. It\nshouldn't repeat itself.",
        "Q: Do you ever question or think about how, how it is that people can be evil to that extent,\nor how people can...? Did that ever -- is that something that happened then, or that you\nthought about -- that you think about since then?",
        "A: Circumstances brings it to them. How could people do it? Right? Germany before the\nwar, | mean now I'm big scholar. What did | know? Germany before the war was in big\ndepression. Right? No work, no food, no nothing. Here comes Hitler. Prosperity starts,\neverybody has everything, then he builds the Volkswagen for them. Whatever he does\nis right. So he says, \"The Jews are our enemies. They're no good. It's their fault. They\nwanted the war. We have to get rid of \u2018em.\"",
        "Q: But what is it about? | guess I\u2019m thinking about, do you ever think about what it is about\ncertain, certain people, that allows them to do things that are, you know, horrendous?\nErwin Baum 48\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 48",
        "A: Well, something, something penetrates to the mind, that dictates them it's the right thing\nto do. See?",
        "Q: But all the things -- | mean the things -- some of the, the things that you've seen,\nexperienced, how could, how could anyone even justify that?",
        "A: Yeah, people think it's the right thing to do. Like this person, you know, who did so,\nso bad to me, took, you know, made me penniless. And this poor women, you know,\ntook money from her and then she says to her son, \"You know, | have to put some\nmoney on your account.\" So she put money on his account. Then she says, \"You know\nsomething? You better withdraw the cash and let me hold it for you because your wife\nwill leave you and get off, you'll have nothing.\" So the boy gives it to her, you know? He\ntrusts her, because she's so manipulating. And now a year and a half later, the boy ask\nher -- you know, they also had the fight -- he ask her, \"Are you ever going to give me the\nmoney?\" She says that | got it, that | took it, you know? And then the poor boy believes\nit. So...some people that can manipulate other people's brain to do the right thing, and\nshe thinks she does the right thing. Because she spend with me those few years, you\nknow, | deserve that she should make me penniless and not give me back nothing. So\nit's very hard, it's very hard to say why, why people hold up other people, why people\nrape other people, why people kill other people. It's another sickness. Why, why, why\npeople do good thing to people? You see? Like when I, | go back and | think, | good, |\ngood -- | did good things, even while | was hungry, | did good things. And there are\npeople up to this day, thanks God, to verify it, you know. While we were working in\ncamp, there was a certain Kommando. We used to clean up, it was called the clean-up\ncommander like. People came by transport. They had to leave all the luggage and\neverything and we used to put it on trucks and then go to the other location. We sorted\nclothes here, this, that and a big b...box, put the money in there. But while helping the\npeople coming off the train, there was a few boys of us, what told us to do, | don't know.\nBut when we saw a woman, in the 60s, a woman in the 20s, 30s, holding a child, we\nasked them, \"Please have the child -- let your mother hold it.\". Why? A woman with a\nch\u2014 an old woman had no chance, had to go. She was no, no, no good for labor. She\nhad to go to gas chambers. A woman with a child -- because no children, no babies in\ncamp -- go to gas chambers. But if we took the child and give to the older woman, we\nsave the young woman -- she went to camp. Who told us to do? Why? No reason.\nWe did it. There is one, there is one instant | experienced that | shall never forget for\nuntil | close my eyes. The end of 1944, Hungarian transports used to come. Two\nErwin Baum 49\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 49\nthousand day, 2,000 at night. | mean the crematoriums were so busy, they couldn't\nacc...accommodate all this killings. So they dug big, big holes, put people on the truck\nand straight in the fire. Here comes this transport at night and we're getting called out. |\nmean, | was hard as a rock over there. | didn't care, because | knew it might happen to\nme. If my cousin, whoever came, | knew he was going to die. Only looked if he has a\npiece of bread. Like from France or Belgium, they came. They used to bring sardines.\nWe wanted a piece of salami. What happened to him will happen anyways. But here\ncomes a transport and | do my thing. | see a girl, 18 years old, whether it was her baby\nor not her baby, | don't know. | say to, in Yiddish, \u201cGib dos kind tzu di mameh, un kim\nmit mir.\u201d'* She goes like this, she takes me by my shirt, she says -- and the, yeah, the\npeople knew what's going on. The flames from the crematoriums were noticed on the\nramp. People were putting on tallasim\u2019\u00ae -- \u201cShema Israel\u201d'\u00ae were praying and\nscreaming and the Nazis were running around, calm down, calm down the people, calm\ndown with the dogs, | mean. And this girl, like that. \"Look\" she says, \"I'm 18 years old.\n| didn't love in my life, yet.

The nice one was that Dr.\nKorczak was very, very much conc...conscious about the kids eating. He used to walk\naround and make sure that the child eats. Walk around, so. The child takes a piece of\nbread, takes a bite and he holds it, so he used to grab from the piece of bread, put it in\nhis mouth as a joke, as a gesture. The second moment, war broke out, the bombs are\nfalling, no food. But Dr. Korczak managed to bring always a little bit more. Now, here it\nsays on the blackboard, \u201cTwo slices of bread each.\u201d Everybody gets two slices of\nbread. Dr. Korczak gets two slices of bread. What happens? He gives this two slices\nof bread everyday to another child. Doesn't eat. You know? Things like that.

        "Q: You didn't know then?",
        "A: | didn't Know then, because when | met her, you know, three months later we were\nmarried. Three months later we were married and then some pity, pity overtook me,\nbecause she had a stepfather -- you know, and they were in Haifa, only one room, there\nwas not much room -- and her stepfather kind of pushed her to get married, no matter\nwho it is. So one day, she, she used to tell me, she got together with a, with a -- that\nboy, you know. And a wedding was arranged to take place like a day or next day, and\nthen she broke out in tears to her mother, \"Mom, | don't love him. | can't, | can't.\" So her\nmother says, \"Okay, you don't love him, don't get married.\" And when she met me,\nthere was love, | think she loved me too, but it was, it was different.

But again | turn to God and | say that God, in his way, will\npunish the guilty and award the, the one that's being mistreated. | believe that somehow\neverything will come to an end and it will straighten itself out when I'll be on my feet\nagain and be able to go see my children as often as | can, which is -- this is my priority.",

But the time was called\nprotektsia?\u2019. It means, it's not what you know, it's whoms you know, you know.

        "Q: What do you feel -- do you think people felt like after the experiences in camps? That\nthey had nothing to lose at that point or\u2014?",
        "A: Well, first of all, nothing to lose. Then, second, was a challenge, the challenge to be in\nthe army among your own. Because before the war, if Jewish boys were supposed to\nbe drafted to the Polish army, they did everything possible not to go. Chop off a finger,\nchop off a toe, go on a, on a, on a diet to lose a lot of weight, fu\u2014 and not to go to the\nPolish army. And here was different -- volunteered, volunteered. But once you were in\nthe army, we were trying to get out. By all means, we were trying to get out. So, you\nknow, that, that we were not stable, we were not stable, you see. Couldn't call a home,\nGermany. Some people went to Poland, back. They were killed there, right? In 1956,\nthere was this killing and all that.*2?

        "A: Yeah. Well, approximately in the Fall of 1942, | was transported from ghetto to\nAuschwitz concentration camp -- | arrived with my mother, my sisters and my two\nbrothers -- where, at the time of arrival, men and women were separate immediately and\nwhen it came to select, to separate men, to put them in the right places, me and my two\nbrothers were approached by the, by the German officer. He pointed my brothers to\none side and me to another side. Within twenty or thirty minutes, | found myself\nstanding with all the men and young children. On the other hand, on the other side, |\nsaw where my brothers were, were about 45 young men. Something told me that | am\nin the wrong spot, | didn't like where | am, | didn't know why. When the soldier passed\nErwin Baum 2\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 2\nme by, | just ran across to where my brothers were.

So did my mother, my sisters. At that\ntime, there were no women needed for labor, so all the women were gassed from that\nparticular transport. When | arrived in Auschwitz, | was the youngest of the camper -- of\nabout 18,000 inmates,\u2019 and | was the youngest.",
        "A: There are a few, few moments like that you mention, in my life, kind of miracles. For\ninstance, prior to arrive in the camp, as it is well known that | was raised by Dr. Janusz\nKorczak? in the orphanage, where | spent some years. Many times, while German\noccupation on the ghetto, | had the chance to go out of the ghetto, over a wall or by a\ncertain tube or by the way of a sewer, to go to the Polish side, where | did not look very\nmuch Jewish and | spoke very clear Polish, and the doctor used to give me a few zlotys\n' During 1942, there were some 24,000 prisoners in Auschwitz.

And also | was torn apart, | didn't know whether to be with\nmy mother, my whole family was hungry, or be with the children. So sometimes | spent\nnights with, with my mother, where also during the night | used to go over the gate to the\nPolish side and buy loaves of bread, throw over the gate, throw over the wall to my\nmother; she used to sell it. What | want to bring out, that one particular night when it --\nthey decided to evacuate the orphanage, to take the childrens to Treblinka, to gas\nchambers?, | was out of that ghetto, particularly that night. So, that happened to be what,\none of the miracles that happened in my life, that | was not there at that night. When |\narrived in there in the morning, the whole orphanage was gone, although | tried to join\nthem and | was chased away by police that said, \"You're not Jewish, get lost.\" There\nwas another, another instinct while in concentration camp. If one was quite awhile in\nconcentration camp, you got known and if the -- a good job, a good kind of opportunity\ncame along, naturally the older inmates got priority. So | had a good job. | was working\nin a, in a place sorting clothes and while you sort clothes from the people that arrive\nfrom, from, from, from Poland to Holland, to -- or France, you always found an extra bite,\nsomething to eat.

Upon\nthat, a request came from a camp that they need a few hundred men to build certain air\nstrips. It was kind of emergency and they called the blockaltester*. From that barrack,\nhis name was Heinz, a young man, he got along with me very good and he put me on\nthe transport. | was very angry. | didn't Know why is he sending me away, when | have\nit good, when | have, | was not hungry. Well, | couldn't help it, my number was given\nand | had to go.

        "A: | was transported fr... to many, many camps. From camp to camp, from camp to\ncamp, because, as | said, the Germans were building little air strips, so always a few\nhundred men were in a certain, out of a village, like they had a, they had a shack made\nout of metal and they kept us there. But on the last days of war, like maybe it's known\nalready to you that they put all the inmates on a dead march, and | was among also\nthem, a dead march. We were marching and marching and marching and marching,\nthousands of, of people, of men, thousands of them, and everyday there were less and\nless and less and less. They left a certain time, | don't remember, a few weeks, after\nmarching once, they told us to sit down and have our break. It was no coffee break, by\nall means, they gave us a few cold potatoes to eat and then they said, \"Okay, let's go.\"\nWell, like the message passed from one to another, nobody would get up anymore.\nLike it was senseless, no use. So they got very angry and they ordered us to go up the\nhill and go against the trees and hands up. They said that they wanted to, to execute\nand also they gave the order, the, the high rank officer gave the order the soldiers, like\n\u201caim at the neck.\u201d And we heard that the guns -- you know, whatever they had to do --\nwe heard that noise and we keep our hands up and we wait and wait and wait and wait\nErwin Baum 6\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 6\nand nothing happens, and then we hear one soldier looking through his binoculars said,\n\"Mine God, four kilometers from here are the Americans.\" We heard that, and we stay\nand naturally you stay so long with your hands up, you get a little tired, so you kind of,\nwe kind of look back a little bit and we saw no more Germans. So we drop our hands,\nwe turn around, no Germans. So naturally we run down the hill, and believe it or not the\ntanks and trucks were rolling and we ran and, \"Please, please, take us, take us, take\nus.\" Unfortunately, they had other orders than to take us and they passed by, they left\nus there, and the Germans came back and took us again. Took us again, put us in that\ncamp and then not long we were liberated. We were liberated in, as | told you, in Allach\nwhen the allies came in, naturally they came in, they make pictures and everybody was\nrunning and asking, making motions with their hands for food, because we didn't know\nhow to speak English. And they said, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" but nothing happened, there\nwas nothing there, and by that time the Germans left us a few days before. They were\nafraid and we were kind of sorry because like this, everyday we got a little bit whatever -\n- we got. But like us, for three, four days, we got nothing, and the allies came and still\nthere's nothing. But I, as | was used to sneak around and hassle to find always an extra\nbite, | went up on a -- it's bigger than a Jeep, kind of a little -- little truck, and | was\nlooking, looking and | found and | ate a full box of what | thought it was chocolate and |\nate a box of Ex-lax. | didn't know, | was happy, | found chocolate, | ate it and you could\nimagine what happened to me. I, | got very, very, very in bad shape, pain, and | walked\nErwin Baum 7\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 7\nout of that, of that camp and there was this, on the road there was the field kitchen that\nthe soldiers were fed, and | went and | was crying, \"Pain, pain, pain,\" and there was one\nAmerican soldier of Russian descent and he spoke a little kind of broken Polish, and |\ntold him that I'm so sick. So he put me in his car, in, in his Jeep, and drove me to town\ncalled Muhldorf, put me in a hospital. They put me in a hospital. Oh, that was beautiful.\nThey fed me a Farina with milk and sugar for about two weeks, and I, | just walked out\nof the hospital and went on my own. | went on my own and went into a little, a little\nvillage called, it was Muhldorf, | forgot the name, and | met with two other friends from\nconcentration camp and there were, and, and on a, on a farm with two German older\nsisters and they just, they thought that they have to take in, anybody that comes in they\nhave to take in and take care of them.",
        "A: Yeah, they didn't know, they thought that's the order, that the Germans, for them to pay\nback, they have to take care of, of people that were in the camp. Ampfing, that's the\nname, Ampfing, yeah. And we went to them and they took care of us, we ate and drank\nand they did our clothes. We were there for several months.

        "A: Well, right away we had an idea of doing business. In the -- in this little village,\nAmpfing, there was a forest and there was also a concentration camp called the\nWaldlager.

So we used to go in there, take\nmotors and sell to the farmers in exchange for a cow or -- and, and, and we took that\ncow or a calf or a sheep, we slaughter it and we used to sell the meat to those camps\nthat were set up by, by, by the UNRRA\u00ae camps, and made, made some money and...",
        "A: Well, those first few of months, why did we do those business, that kind of business,\npreparation, storage, buy food, put away, all in, in our mind was only not to be hungry,\nanymore. That's why we didn't want to wait, many of us, we didn't want to wait to get a\nhandout, to wait from the UNRRA to give us something. | mean the first money came to\nmy pocket and the first bakery | saw, | must have bought about thirty loaves of bread,\nand put it away. That was, you know, only in our mind, nothing else, nothing else\nmattered till later on, start, you know, we start to relive the whole bitter experience, try to\nlook if anybody was left of the family, or whatever. And we came to Munich and got\ninvolved in business, doing business with, with the Germans, or with the Americans,\nkind of start, start, start a new life again. Till one day, | met somebody and | saw a\nnumber. By the number, we could identify which transport or which camp that person\nwas, and | saw this number and | knew that he was in one of the camps where | was,\nwhich is Buna, and my brother was there. So | ask him, \"You must have been in Buna.\"\nHe says, \"Sure, | sure was.\" \"Did you happen to know Icek Baum?\" He says, \"Sure, |\nknow him. Here's his address. He survived. He's in Czechoslovakia.\" Now, you can\nimagine how | felt. Immediately, | ran to a, to a translator that wrote a letter to the\ngovernment of Czechoslovakia and I'm looking, looking for this person. Unfortunately,\nthe answer came that \u201cNo one like this is known by the name.\u201d During that time, my\nbrother Icek -- and there's my older brother who wind up in Belgium, he was liberated\nsomewhere and they went to Belgium -- thank God they found each other, and they\nwere writing letters to each other and crying over my death. In the meantime, | was a\n\u00ae United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.\nErwin Baum 9\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 9\nhustler. | was successful in Munich. | was the first boy who could have a car, you know,\n| put a pillow under my seat so girls could see me and | was doing pretty well, and they\nwere crying over me. But that never gave me any rest, that he told me my brother, and,\nand, and then | gave up hope. | said, \"Well, must have been a mistake or something.\"\nWell, one day my brother Icek from Czechoslovakia decided to join up with his brother in\nBelgium. So he had to leave Czechoslovakia, come to Germany and somehow go to\nBelgium. On the train going to, going to Munich, he met up with a girl and says, \"Why\ndon't you accompany us to our camp?\" And so he spent sometime with her. She says\n\u201cOkay.\u201d On the train station, he meets again the same person who told me that my\nbrother was alive. He says, \"Did you find your brother?\" \"Oh, come on, | have no\nbrother.\" He says, \"Yes, you have a brother. He's got a golden tooth, wavy hair.\" Now,\nagain, my oldest brother that did not survive had the golden tooth and wavy, wavy hair.\nBut that didn't matter. But he brought them next day to me, you know, to Munich and |\njoined up with Icek and | says, \"Edyl didn't survive.\" He says, \"What do you mean, he\ndidn't survive? He's in Belgium.\" So then, somehow, we got together, all three. | was\nvery happy. Me, me and my brother Icek went to Belgium to be with my, with my, with\nmy other brother, and we were in a home not, not doing much. But that didn't give me\nany rest. | used to go over the border, forth and back, back and forth to, to Germany, do\na little business, and then one day | was caught on the border, you know, and Belgium\ngave me a deportation. | had to leave Belgium. So, somebody took me over to\nLuxembourg. | went to Luxembourg and while | was in Belgium, somebody from my\nhometown, from Warsaw, approached me. He says, \"Hey, you're 19 years old, you're\njust walking the streets, not doing nothing. Why don't you come to my place down, I, |\nhave a fur shop. | put you down by the machine. If you learn the trade in two weeks,\nyou have a job and you can make something.\" | says fine. So, | learned the trade and it\nwas very useful, because when | went to Luxembourg they gave me a job by a furrier\nand | was working there, and then the war broke out in Israel and my brother from\nBelgium decided to go as a volunteer. So | figured, my brother's going, what I'm going\ndo all alone here? | went to Israel also, as a volunteer and became a Navy man.\nErwin Baum 10\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 10\nwho were you, who were you -- what kind of social at...atmosphere was there at that\ntime?",
        "A: Well, we had an apartment. Sure, | was interested, | was interested in girls and we had\na maid in the house. You know, we used to socialize. We used to go out, there were\nconcerts and, as | told you, | had a car and | couldn't register the car because there was\nthat gasoline business. So | went to the, to the office of the Israel -- it was the Palestine,\nyou know, Palestine consul -- and they had doctors to be driven around from camp to\ncamp to, to check out the children, were they in good condition to eventually immigrate\nto Israel. | mean | was busy that | had my little world around me.",
        "A: Well, only, only us survivors. Only us survivors. We only mingled with the survivors,\nand then, naturally, started a business, buying American dollars, buying diamonds,\nbuying watches, exchanging, doing this and that. Purpose, there was no purpose. We\ndidn\u2019t know -- just for the moment, to have a comfortable life. \u2018Til, \u2018til | went to Belgium\nand then to Luxembourg and then to Israel, where | joined the Israeli Navy, also as a\nvolunteer.\nErwin Baum 11\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 11\nfriends -- must have had those stories of trying to find people and it seems like it must\nhave been chaotic.",
        "A: Oh, it was very, very chaotic. Very, very, very emotional. | mean, it was, it was\nunbelievable. It took about a year and a half to find them, you Know. And while my\nbrother was in Belgium, | got some connection with somebody who had connection with\nthe Belgian consulate in Munich, and that man, that consulate gave to that man a list of\nnames of people that did not survive. So we used that opportunity, because people\ndidn't want to stay in Germany, Munich. They wanted to go. United States didn't open\nup the doors, yet. Canada, nothing happened. To Israel, nobody could go. So if there's\nopportunity to go somewhere, they wanted to go. So for 200 dollars, | was able to get\nan ID, piece of paper with a picture ID on the name of the person who perished in\nBelgium, and he could go home. So that person arrived in Belgium and Belgium the\nHIAS changed and gave him some, some papers. So we, we had the world and then,\nas when my turn came, | went to Belgium.",
        "A: Oh, we were, we were, we were very an... very, very angry. But, what, what can | tell\nyou? We were very, very rough, very arrogant in, in the beginning. Like we went on a\ntrain and they ask for a, for a train ticket. We used to say, \u201cHitler paid already.\u201d We\nErwin Baum 12\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 12\nnever stood in line -- like, like taking advantage of the situation. But after awhile, we\ncalmed down. We calmed down, because we say, \u201cHey, what's the use, after all, you\ncannot blame the whole, the whole nation for it. Here, now, the Nazis, | thought were\narrested and taken care of, and the children of them are regretting, and then they're\nfeeling with us, they're nice to us.\u201d So you know, they try to brainwash us, and as a\nyoung person, from bad to good, you got kind of a little bit brainwashed and, and, and\ncalmed down, you know.",
        "A: That they say, \u201cIt's not my fault, | didn't know, my daddy, you know, it was very bad, he\nwas forced into it. He didn't mean to do it. If he wouldn't join the Nazi party, he would\ngo also to concentration camp.\u201d And, and | saw these things happen because there\nwere certain times where, where SS soldiers were brought to concentration camp for not\nfulfilling the orders that they received. | didn't know exactly what the orders were. Like\none very high rank officer came to concentration camp and he was stripped of the\nuniform, put on concentration camp uniform, shaved the head, and we had to speak to\nhim. He says, \"Well, | was a very high rank officer and | came home on vacation and\nmy wife and the children were deported to a camp.\" He says, \"Why?\" Because\napparently, his wife's grandfather descended from a gypsy. So that made her also a\ngypsy, they put in concentration camp. So he came back, he says, \"Who am | fighting\nErwin Baum 13\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 13\nfor?\" You know, so he came to concentration camp. So, this way the Germans of the\nwar made us believe somehow that they were not completely to blame, that they were,\nwere brainwashed, that, that circumstances brought them to that.",
        "A: | mean, | was reasonable, because after all, |, | didn't read any books. | wasn't that my --\nthat much educa...educated. After the war, | didn't feel like going back to school and,\nyou know, | wanted to roam around, to drive my car, to show off, go to dancing, be with\ngirls, and my dream was to have a beautiful blue suit with white stripes. It was\nimpossible to get it, but somehow | got it. So like after the war, whatever | wanted, it\ncame to me, it fell into my lap, very easy. So | stopped thinking ab...about the past. |\nmean, it happened, it's unrepairable and when | found my two brothers, | was very, very,\nvery, very happy and we kind of started a new life again. And as | said, the war broke\nout in Israel and my brother went. | says, \"What am | sitting here in Luxembourg?\nThere's no future here. | go to Israel.\" And | went to Israel and then | went to the, to the\nIsraeli Navy as a volunteer.",
        "A: Not militant, | had the feeling for a Jewish state, for a Jewish state, that's Israel you\nknow, that's all | knew. Because the camps, the UNRRA camps that | used to visit, you\nknow, and all the girls, | used to socialize with a beautiful girl, and she says, \"Oh, I'm not\ngoing to stay here.

        "A: That's right and | didn't like her mouth. Very, very bad mouth, so one day | wrote her a\nletter that if -- that she should leave us, leave our life and go, you know, and at that time\nwhen my, when my, my daughter left for, for California, | had the relapse. Because in\n1983, | had a car accident and | had a disc, a herniated disk, but with exercise, and | fell\nErwin Baum 24\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 24\ninto a depression when my daughter left me. And when | told this woman to go, she\nstart begging me, \u201cdon't, don't.\u201d My wife says, \"Leave her alone, leave her alone, she's\nokay, you know, she helps out.\" | didn't know that my wife is using her as a cover-up, as\na cover. Well, then when she pumped out from my wife whatever she could, she went\nto work on me, you know. \"Oh, you're so nice, your wife is going to Florida, everything\nis fine, no worry, she cooked for me, she made me meals,\" and all that, and she says,\n\u201coh you're like my father and | give my life for you,\" and blah, blah, blah, talk and talk\nand talk a lotta nonsense. But one day she says, \"Do you ever cheat on your wife?\" |\nsays, \"No | don't.\u201d Why? Because, well, | had a complex because my wife used to\nreject me, so | didn't have the, the, the, the courage to approach other women, because\n| couldn't stand rejection. So | said, \"No, | don't do it,\" and, and we left it at that. And\nthen again, and again, and again, when she couldn't take anymore money from my wife,\nshe started, \"Oh, | need an apartment, | need this, you help me.\" Okay, so | helped -- a\nfew hundred dollars here, a few hundred dollars there, and then she dropped, when she\nsaw the moment is ripe, you know, that | am so depressed, she dropped a bombshell on\nme. She says, \"You never cheat on your wife?\" | says, \"No, does she?\" She says,\n\"Yeah. You know this and this guy?\" \"Well, | think | do.\" And she told me, let's go, let\u2019s\ngo, let\u2019s go to a detective office and | Know exactly when and where she can be caught\nwith this man. And she used to take telephone and put my wife together with that man.\n| mean, she plotted the whole thing. And, naturally, | go to this detective and | give a\nErwin Baum 25\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 25\ndeposit, and she tells him exactly when and where -- they get caught. They get caught,\n| got grounds for divorce. Right? | got grounds for divorce. But here, I'm a wealthy\nman. See? So she says, \"She's going to take everything away from you. Why don't\nyou transfer it to me?\" Transfer the building, you know, and make promises\neverywhere, \u201cI do it for him because of my love and whenever he wants it I'll give it back\nto him,\u201d you know? And she says, | says, \"I want to make a settlement. Give her so\nmuch and so much to my wife.\" She says, \"No, no, no. You'll give her as little as\npossible and leave the rest to me.\" Anyway, she manipulated my brain, she\nmanipulated her brains and | was then under so much depression | used to take\ntranquilizers, Xanax, you know? And whenever | got depressed, she even had these\npills in her bag and she used to give me, just to keep me calm. And she dragged me to\na lawyer. Naturally, | signed over everything, you know, with a promise she is going to\ngive it back to me, just because she put my wife on the telephone and she spoke to her\nand | heard her say, \"Oh, okay. If he's going to find out, gonna to be divorced. I'm going\nto take everything and find myself a young lover and live my life.\" She prepared all that\nand | should hear it. So, of course, that aggravated me. So, | didn't want that to\nhappen, that she should get everything. Whatever stocks she had, she made her sell\nand give me a check. I'm telling you, she took the building and hundreds of thousands\nof dollars and all that, and she was nice to me. She gave me a few years that | never\nhad in my life. Actually the divorce went through. Right? She gave me, you know, and\nErwin Baum 26\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 26\nalways money here, money there. And when the money start, you know, there was\nnothing much to give, she kind of pulled off and she looked somewhere else. So here\ncomes along a woman friend that we knew together, that is in the process of dying, you\nknow, of cancer. And so she went to work on her. \"Oh, I'm gonna to be for you here.\nI'm gonna to help you.\" This and that, and that poor woman had a, had a bad\nrelationship with her only son. She left with a second husband. For years, she couldn't\nget along with her son. However, her son has three children, very poor, and he made a\nbat mitzvah for her, for his daughter, and me and this person were invited and he didn't\nspeak to his mother. His mother was dying of cancer. He didn't speak to her. But there\ncome a moment when they were playing the hora, you know, dancing the hora. So he\nis -- the boy -- dancing the hora. | take his hand and his mother comes in. So | joined\nthe hands of his mother and the boy and | say, \"It's time.\" So they got together and start\ntalking, you know? But in the meantime this woman get sick. So this person, again,\nstart to brainwash this woman. \"Get away from your husband.\" Blah, blah, blah. \"I take\ncare of you.\" And so sh\u2014 this woman made her the executive, you know?",
        "A: | mean I, I, | accepted what she told me. | said -- |, | thought, \u201cWhat's the use having\neverything, everything on my name, she wants it on her name to protect from the other\none, shouldn't take it.\u201d So she gave me a few nice years. But when she met up with\nthis woman and this woman started, oh she started on this woman also, make her\nErwin Baum 27\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 27\nexecutive over the -- full power of attorney, take out money from here, from there,\neverything, everything and her, she let up on me. She started to neglect me completely\nand | wasn't happy because | saw then, | realize, | saw, and this woman used to fa\u2014 the\nsick woman used to fall into a coma. And one time she woke up, she says, \"Erwin, |\nhope she's not going to do to my son what she did to you.\" | said, \"What are you talking\nabout?\" And she went back. You know, apparently this woman saw something. And |\nsaw, look, she's making this woman sign this, and sign here, sign power of attorney and\ntake money and transfer from here, and transfer there, and make the boy give her\nmoney. | didn't like it, and here three months she neglects me. So | approached her\nonce, | says, \"Look here, it's nice to take care of the person, but you're neglecting me.\nYou're leaving in the morning, you come home three, four o'clock in the morning, five\no'clock and run back.\" | says, \"I don't feel good. |, |, | had chest pain and | had to go to\nemergency.\" She says, \"Well, I'm not going to worry about you now.\"",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. Well, and why | trusted her, people also ask me\nwhy | trusted her. My depression led to a heart bypass, to an operation. So | go to the\nhospital. My wife didn't have the time to go with me to the hospital, because she told\nher, \"It's okay, you don't have to go. I'll take care of him.\" Now, before | go down to\noperation, before | close my eyes, | don't see my wife, | see her. When | come out, |\ndon't see my wife, | see her. So, | mean that's how she plotted everything and that's\nhow she made me trust her in full. You understand? So now, go back to this woman\nand so...",
        "A: This woman would argue back and forth. | says, \"Look, you always promised, whenever\n| want the building, whatever money | gave, | mean hundreds of thousands of dollars,\nErwin Baum 28\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 28\nnow | have nothing.\" | says, \"Just transfer the building back to me.\" Because she took\na big mortgage on the building also and messed it up. | took a mortgage of this\napartment | gave her. Now I'm responsible for it. She says, \"I'm not giving it back. I'm\nnot giving back nothing. | give, | gave you, | took care of you.\" Well, naturally | started a\nlitigation. | started a litigation and we came to a settlement that she, she will pay me for\nthe building like -- on the time of transaction, somebody advised her that it couldn't be\njust like this. She got to kind of make a sale, so 160,000 dollars, she gave me a second\nmortgage. | wasn't aware that it's so powerful. She says, \"The only thing you can get,\nyou can get payments on the mortgage.\" So, well, we agreed on that. She made a few\npayments and then she, she defaulted on payments. So now I'm in litigation again with\nher, and she's such a person so vicious, you know. Wha\u2014 on every sentence, there's\nthreat, she's threatening, oh, she'll do something, \u201cI'm going to destroy him, my mother,\nmy mother will come.

Everything is nice, so maybe she, she had a fling here and there\nsomewhere, which is, | don't know, it might be, it might be natural, or not. But naturally, |\nwasn't happy at home -- very happy -- because she was not very attentive. Like | had to\ngo to a doctor for a, for a angiogram report. She did not have time to go with me. And\nthese little things bugged me very much and | felt an oppression. When | divorced her,\nyou know, and this one was here -- came to my life. | mean, | was treated like a king, |\nmust say.

        "A: That was the dream in the camp. What was, what, what was our dream? Our dream --\nlike most of us, when there was a day off like Sunday, we didn't work, we were able to\nbe in camp. Outside the camp, we didn't see it. But while in camp, we saw the fire\nabove the chimney going very, very high, because of the fat of the human flesh. Not\nonly there was the, the, the -- how you call -- the, the smog, but the fire. And in people's\nmind, well, one day, what do you want before that happens? Enough bread, just bread\nto satisfy your hunger and then | don't care what happens. Like before they execute a\nperson, your last wish, that was our last wish.

        "A: Yeah, people think it's the right thing to do. Like this person, you know, who did so,\nso bad to me, took, you know, made me penniless. And this poor women, you know,\ntook money from her and then she says to her son, \"You know, | have to put some\nmoney on your account.\" So she put money on his account. Then she says, \"You know\nsomething? You better withdraw the cash and let me hold it for you because your wife\nwill leave you and get off, you'll have nothing.\" So the boy gives it to her, you know? He\ntrusts her, because she's so manipulating. And now a year and a half later, the boy ask\nher -- you know, they also had the fight -- he ask her, \"Are you ever going to give me the\nmoney?\" She says that | got it, that | took it, you know? And then the poor boy believes\nit. So...some people that can manipulate other people's brain to do the right thing, and\nshe thinks she does the right thing. Because she spend with me those few years, you\nknow, | deserve that she should make me penniless and not give me back nothing. So\nit's very hard, it's very hard to say why, why people hold up other people, why people\nrape other people, why people kill other people. It's another sickness. Why, why, why\npeople do good thing to people? You see? Like when I, | go back and | think, | good, |\ngood -- | did good things, even while | was hungry, | did good things. And there are\npeople up to this day, thanks God, to verify it, you know. While we were working in\ncamp, there was a certain Kommando. We used to clean up, it was called the clean-up\ncommander like. People came by transport. They had to leave all the luggage and\neverything and we used to put it on trucks and then go to the other location. We sorted\nclothes here, this, that and a big b...box, put the money in there. But while helping the\npeople coming off the train, there was a few boys of us, what told us to do, | don't know.\nBut when we saw a woman, in the 60s, a woman in the 20s, 30s, holding a child, we\nasked them, \"Please have the child -- let your mother hold it.\". Why? A woman with a\nch\u2014 an old woman had no chance, had to go. She was no, no, no good for labor. She\nhad to go to gas chambers. A woman with a child -- because no children, no babies in\ncamp -- go to gas chambers. But if we took the child and give to the older woman, we\nsave the young woman -- she went to camp. Who told us to do? Why? No reason.\nWe did it. There is one, there is one instant | experienced that | shall never forget for\nuntil | close my eyes. The end of 1944, Hungarian transports used to come. Two\nErwin Baum 49\nDecember 5, 1995\nPage 49\nthousand day, 2,000 at night. | mean the crematoriums were so busy, they couldn't\nacc...accommodate all this killings. So they dug big, big holes, put people on the truck\nand straight in the fire. Here comes this transport at night and we're getting called out. |\nmean, | was hard as a rock over there. | didn't care, because | knew it might happen to\nme. If my cousin, whoever came, | knew he was going to die. Only looked if he has a\npiece of bread. Like from France or Belgium, they came. They used to bring sardines.\nWe wanted a piece of salami. What happened to him will happen anyways. But here\ncomes a transport and | do my thing. | see a girl, 18 years old, whether it was her baby\nor not her baby, | don't know. | say to, in Yiddish, \u201cGib dos kind tzu di mameh, un kim\nmit mir.\u201d'* She goes like this, she takes me by my shirt, she says -- and the, yeah, the\npeople knew what's going on. The flames from the crematoriums were noticed on the\nramp. People were putting on tallasim\u2019\u00ae -- \u201cShema Israel\u201d'\u00ae were praying and\nscreaming and the Nazis were running around, calm down, calm down the people, calm\ndown with the dogs, | mean. And this girl, like that. \"Look\" she says, \"I'm 18 years old.\n| didn't love in my life, yet. Why are you taking me to dead already?\" You know, if she\nwould have put a knife in my heart, | would be happy. It got me so down. So | got to talk\nto her. \"No, no | don't -- it's no good for you to have the baby. Give it to mommy, give it\nto mommy.\" And we couldn't talk because if we would have be...been spotted, it would\nbe the end of us. So, somehow | managed to surrender the baby and | managed to get\nher in the right place, where she went to camp, you know? = And a few weeks later, |, |\nkind of visited that camp. | had a way of getting in, to exchange with somebody else\nwho was working there, and the girl got, got crazy in that camp. | thought | saved her\nlife.

The second moment, war broke out, the bombs are\nfalling, no food. But Dr. Korczak managed to bring always a little bit more.
