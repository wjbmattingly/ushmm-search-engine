        "INTERVIEW WITH HENRY DROBIARZ",
        "March 3, 1992",
        "Central Village, Ct.\nCould you tell us a little bit about yourself, for example, what was your name when you were growing\nup, where were you born, your date of birth and what was your childhood like?\nYeah. I was born in Sosnowiec, Poland. And then I lived all the time in Kozlow, Poland. When I\nwas seven years old, I went to public school and about five years old, I start to go to the cheder. So,\nwhen I come back from the public school at noon time, in afternoon, I get to go to the Cheder--come\nhome about six o'clock. My parents were in business, they were dealing with grain, cattle, and farm\nproducts. And we got a decent life, they give everything to the children--what the children need. It\nwasn't a rich life, but we got everything.\nHow many children did your parents have?\nWe have four.\nYou want to tell anything about your brother and sisters?\nYeah. I had an older brother. He was two years older. And then I had one brother, he passed away.\nThat was the third. He was about six, seven years old. He passed away. Then I had another brother.\nHe was born in 1930 and I got a sister born in 1934. We had been four in the family. When I finished\nschool, the seventh grade, I went to public school, my father says nothing wasn't much to do in town-\n-because my brother was the main help for my parents. So he says that I should go learn a trade and\nmy uncle was a tinsmith in Sosnowiec, Poland so he says I should come learn a trade and I went when\nI was fifteen years old and I worked there and at night I went two times, three times a week to trade\nschool to learn about the trade.\nAnd which trade was that?\nTinsmith, sheet metal, blocker. And then I did all right, I made already good money and on holidays\nI came home and visit with the parents. The parents can visit with us because they were coming to",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Sosnowiec with the produce to sell. So I wasn't lonesome, so I always see the parents. The war broke\nout in 1939.\nCan I stop you before we go back to that? What was your home like Jewishly? Were you traditional?\nor?\nTraditional orthodox. I didn't know anything else. I have to lay tefillen. I have to daven every\nmorning and every night and Shabbos was real orthodox. I went to Cheder, I learned the main thing,\nwhatever. When I was fourteen years old, then I started to learn a trade. Tinsmithing, you know, I\nwent to my uncle and learned the trade. That maybe saved my life, too, because, you know, during\nthe war in 1939, in my town I was doing the tinsmithing so they give me a pass that I can go from one\nplace to another. Because they didn't have no tinsmiths and I was working in town. I did not have to\ngo out and do the digging and hard work, on the railroad or building roads. It has been like this until\n1941. In 1940 in March, they came out and everybody got to wear armbands, Jewish star to be\nrecognizable and you wouldn't get out from the town. You got to have a pass to get out, you couldn't\ngo with the train, you have a pass, you could, you know. And my brother has to go out and work for\nthe Germans. Right away, they took all the young people, they took him to Cracow. They have to\nwork like making bricks, they still could come home for the weekends--they work six days and\nSaturdays they could leave Cracow and could come home to Kozlow. They were maybe fifteen or\ntwenty boys that age, 22, 23. They took some food with them, whatever they got there, there wasn't\nenough. So it was helped out, they still could buy some food on the black market. In 1942, so they\nstart to gather us, we have to go--in one spot like a ghetto. In about, I should say, then they took all\nthe Jews--they have to get out. They took them to Slomniki, that was a town--\nCould you spell that? (Thank you.)\nS-l-o-m-n-i-k-1. That was in Poland, you know. That was county of Miechow. That was I should\nthink in August, the grain was already taken up from the fields in 1942. They started out, they took\nthe young people, the boys, the groups were working already but they took them to the place Slomniki,\nthere was still some young people. And I wasn't there because I still have a pass that I can stay in\ntown and do my tinsmithing, you know. They give me that privilege. They took all the old people\nand I with my parents because I knew they gonna--so we hid in Kozlow. We hid and we stayed for\nanother three months. They took us from there, they took us to Welbraun. That was where they make\nthe ghetto and that was Judenrein, all around. About in November, they cleaned out the Welbraun,\nthey took it to Miechow, in the county. They load up all the people in the cars and they didn't sort it\nout no more, they took everybody, young, old. They took to Treblinka that time already.\nOh, really.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Yeah. You know, we think that they went up that way. We don't know, they went up that way. So\nthat was the end of the--. We took off from that town, Welbraun, I got a policeman, a town policeman\ncame to help clean up the town with the Jews. They have to have the police. So the policeman came\nto me Saturday and he says to me \"On tomorrow, there going to be liquidation here.\" So I knew what\nit is, So we took off again. We went to Kozlow, to town, me, my father and mother and sister and\nbrother and uncle.\nYou're still out together.\nYeah, we're still out together. We come back to Kozlow and we went then to Polish people, we hid\nout fora day. And then at night, we split up. I went with my father to one place and my mother went\nwith the two children, my brother and sister, to another place, to a ghetto in Cracow Podowiec and\nmy uncle went to another place. We stay in town for about four days and then they come out with an\norder, that if some Jews are left, they can come to Cracow and that's where we went, to Cracow. I\nwent to work to the camp and I took my father with me--we were working with bridges for a German\ncompany--Langert was their name. They were from Zwickau. That was Lager--the Judenlager that\nwas Cracow-Plaszow. That was in 1942 and my parents, my mother went with a sister and brother\nand she was there by herself and my father was working with me in Lager and like a husband, he says\nhe wants to go back to his wife, his kids and his wife, so he went back. Maybe, if he would have\nstayed with me, maybe he would have been alive. So he went back in 1942, in the end sometimes,\nthey liquidated the Judenlager, they brought us up to the Judenlager and made a concentration camp.\nThere was Cracow-Jerozolimska, I don't know if you heard of it. There I worked in a mine shaft.\nThey have the trades and I was working there until about March, 1943 because they liquidated the\nghetto-- all at the same time.\nCan you recall what the conditions were like in the ghetto? Do you remember it?\nThe ghetto was very crowded. The hygiene wasn't there. They got one room and maybe four or five\nfamilies got one kitchen and it was crowded, lice and bugs, you know. Whenever they could, they\nwashed, they washed the clothes. Like us, we also been with lice and dirty. We washed once a week,\nwe went to a cold shower or something like that. Or you went to the ghetto to get a bath and have a\nshower so I visited with my parents when I was in Lager I took sick, I was sick of typhoid, you know...\nOh, really. Well, you recovered.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Yeah. I recovered, yeah. And I was--in Lager I was going out to work--we still could buy something\noutside because Polish people were coming and selling on the black market. They took a chance, you\nknow, brought it into the camp. So in 1943, it must have been in the fall time, or in the beginning so\nthey took us out and sorted us out when we come from that Judenlager, they sort us out. They wanted\ntradesmen, they took to a different side and non-tradesmen. The non-tradesmen they sent to\nSkarzysko, to a munitions factory. A lot of my friends went there. They read my brother's name\nbecause he was registered also as a tradesman and I don't know, my name why I didn't hear, why they\nomitted or something, so I see that he's going there so I went too because that time they didn't ask no\nquestions. So they sort us out and we stay on the Jerozolimska we stay about a couple of weeks and\nthey took us from there, they send us to Mielec. Mielec was a big factory, that was the Polish airplane\nfactory. They were making planes, the Poles.\nCould you spell that please.\nM-1i-e-l-e-c. That was an airplane factory. And Henckel the German bombers they build there. We\nwere there for about six months in that factory.\nWhere did you live at the time?\nThey got barracks. And you know the food was poor, the hygiene wasn't there. If you want anything\nyou got to wash the clothes and everything.\nWere you tortured or anything at that pomt?\nNo, you know, the thing is somehow when you come into the camp sometimes they been frisking you\nor something if you didn't go in line or something. The job wasn't too bad because you know we were\nworking with the Polish people. I was working, making all the things inside what comes in the plane,\nthe fastenoffs, they called it, and was two Jewish boys and one Polak. And he was, you know,\nwhatever has to be done, we did. And my brother was working on the top, he was putting up the\ncovers on the plane. We was there until about June, 1944. Then when the Americans start to come\nin, what they call it, offensive? so they thought that the Russians are going to come in because we\nweren't too far from the Russian border, Sandomierz. We were next to the San, that's the water. Past\nthe San, the Russians were there and on this side the San, the Germans. So they were afraid the\nRussians were going to come and we would be--they would grab us, you know, they grab the factory\nand everything. So they took us out that time and I think that was the 22nd of June, 1944 and they\ntook us to Wieliczka. That was still in Poland, that was a salt mine. They have a factory there also,\nan airplane factory. The only thing we didn't stay there too long, maybe a couple of weeks. From",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "there they took us--again in 1944, they took us to--they load us up in the cars and they say that we\nwere on the railroad siding in Auschwitz for about two days while they were deciding what to do\nwith us. You know, because we were important to them, we were tradesmen. So that's what they say\nnow, who the hell knows, you know, because I didn't know that time. We were in Auschwitz, on the\nsiding, to be liquidated. Meanwhile from there, they took us to Flossenburg. We came into\nFlossenburg iu July--it was real hot, I think the middle of July. They took off all the clothes. We\nhave to throw away the clothes, naked, you know, like you're born.\nYou're still in your regular civilian clothes, right?\nNo, no, no. Already in Mielec we already got the mark, you see, that was the mark from Mielec. We\nwere already concentration camp. Soon we came up to the Jerozolimska no more civilian clothes,\nwas already the striped clothes, was concentration camp. And Mielec was already concentration\ncamp. They thought we brought something with us so they took us to shower us. So they took about\nthree hundred people. We thought that they were going to kill us, you know, because people start to\nscream; so many people and then all of a sudden they let the shower go in Flossensburg.\nYou had heard stories already about the gas chambers?\nYeah, sure we had. 'Cause that was already 44, you know.\nRight, right. Some people say that they--even to the point that they got rumors or whatever, they\nweren't...\nYeah, rumors sure, all rumors, we thought we are going to get killed, you know. People were\nscreaming and everything. Then on the way out, they shaved us the hair and they threw some lye. It\nwas burning like a fire. You know, they grab and throw it between the legs, in here, (points to crotch)\nand they marked us. I had a two.\nWith a tattoo?\nNo, with paint. The ones they took to work, to dig big stones, what is it? stone mines?\nA quarry.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A quarry. You see they didn't care any more. The tools, even the tradesmen, if you was rugged, they\nseparate you. They didn't care. That was in Flossenburg. We were there for about a week, staying\nin the sun and the hot without clothes. And we were like animals, we were sleeping crossways on the\nwooden beds, because it was so packed about four hundred, five hundred in one barrack. About five,\nsix days without clothes. And then they give us clothes and they send us from there, they send us to\nlabor the twos, the threes, the fours stay in--I don't know if they send them to kill or something or they\nkill them off because that was the lowest one. So we went with the twos, we went to labor. From\nFlossenburg, then send us to Leitwezil, Czechoslovakia, near Theresienstadt. That was carbide mine,\nyou know what carbide is. We could see Theresienstadt (from) the place where we were. And they\nkept us there also not too long, I should say about six weeks. We supposed to fix some machines, put\nit in the mines and still working for the airplane. I guess they didn't much realize so they send us from\nthere, they send us to Dachau. In Dachau, we were there about three or four days. From there they\nsend us to Augsburg. That was a big Messerschmitt plant. Everything with no food, nothing much to\neat, and you know, hungry, and the railroad cars. They brought us to Augsburg. Every morning about\nfive o'clock in the morning, they wake us up, they give us a little bit of coffee and a piece of bread\nand we have to go again to an airplane factory. The name was Horgau in the woods. A regular train\nand for us they got a cattle car, you know. Every day you are going in that cattle car and they let us\nout in Horgau. And from there they kept us till about, I don't know, every so often they would transfer\nus from one place to another. Sometimes they'd transfer us in December, 1944. They took us to\nLeonburg, not far from Stuttgart. Leonburg was a tunnel, a big tunnel--blocked off. Half the tunnel\nwas for cars to go on through and trucks and half the tunnel was building wings for the Messerschmitt\nplanes. All the time, we was supposed to do--they need bolts, we already got rivets, they need rivets-\n-was already everything in disarray. We were there until about April, '45. They took us out from\nthere on a march because then we go in from there to Kaufering That was a camp, you know,\nLandsberg was the main camp, Kaufering was a side camp. We were there for about three weeks,\nnothing much to eat, nothing to do and that was in '44 at the end and a week before the lilberation,\nthey took us to Allach that was next to Dachau. On a Friday night, we hear the artrillery, the things,\nshooting and they hit the barracks, a lot of people got killed and the Germans took off. They left the\ncamp and the Germans, what you call the political Germans who were in the concentration camps,\nthe ones what grab us and steal us. The political got a red mark and the rabbles(?) got a triangle, a\nblack one. So they were watching us. Sunday morning, the gates opened, so we got liberated May\n1, 1945. As soon as the gates opened, there were outside potatoe piles, you know, for the winter.\nThey didn't feed us, the only thing, the piles were still there, they didn't give us. So I took a can, I had\na buddy of mine so I said, \"I'm going out to get some potatoes.\" I took a can aand filled up with\npotatoes from outside the camp. So I get out, we made a fire and he was cooking the potatoes. So\nwhile he was cooking, I says I'm going to get another can. So I get out, I get another can, he stays and\ncries, somebody stole the can. We already got liberated and people--it was for them easier to take it\nfrom me then to go out the gate. I said what's you crying, we got liberated, let's go. He didn't want\nto go and I didn't see him since. I went out right away and went on the road with some four or five\nother concentration camps. We went to the town, about a mile. On the way a jeep went by and the\njeep turned back and he give us chewing gum. That was the liberation.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "This is the Americans?\nYeah. And they told me to chew. I didn't know, I ate. We didn't know what chewing gum is. So I\nate the chewing gum. We came in, they were camping out, they were cooking and they surround us.\nThey were Polish soldiers, Jewish soldiers. They start to ask questions and they give us to drink. I\ngot drunk that evening. And I stay overnight, I was sleeping there on the bunk, where they were\ncamping and in the morning, I wake up, they've been gone. So we went as a group, four or five, we\nchanged clothes. We went to the German houses, they left their houses. So we throw away the striped\nclothes, they walked away from us, a lot of lice, you know. So we change clothes, we shower and\ncleaned up a little bit. It took us three days to go into Munich. Because from Allach, we went by\nfoot, there was no transportation. And then we came into Munich, I saw people carrying wine they\nwould sell us. They took out some wine and I was also going in for a case of wine. So we celebrated\nand then I start after a couple of days, I went to work for the Americans, for the GI's, for the kitchen.\nThat was the best thing I ever did because I had plenty of food and I brought home some food for my\nfriends. A lot of friends came to the kitchen there because they got a lot of leftovers because in the\nbeginning everything was rationed. Even for money, you couldn't buy. So that was a big help.\nCould we back up a little bit and go throught---we sort of zoomed through these times in the camps.\nAre there any images of things that you remember that made an impression on you? or any episode\nthat happened to you?\nWhat I can say? On the mark because we were camping outside and I see some people eating flesh,\nyou know, human flesh.\nOh, my God.\nYeah, they were cooking. Yeah, we didn't have too much food. People were eating snacks, they were\neating grass. I did myself, I eat grass, you know. What else?\nAny episode when you were in all these places?\nYeah, you see when I got sick with typhoid on the way home from work, somehow I still was weavy,\nyou know. I didn't walk straight. So the guy came, he was Ukranian, he was watching out. That was\nstill in Poland, you know, in 1941, 42. He came to the camp and the good thing that the sharf, the SS\nwasn't there. His wife was there. He said that I want to take off, that I want to run away. I didn't",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "have no strength to walk, never mind run away. So she called, we would have been there with the\nbullet, there was no question asked, give you the bullet right away. So she said to call the Jewish\nkapos, they should give me twenty-five on my body. So they took me in, they say scream, they know\nif they give me twenty-five, I wouldn't survive either. So they told me scream, they didn't hit me,\nthey didn't touch me.\nSo these were half-decent kapos.\nYeah, yeah. I was still in Poland in Allach, Judenlager.\nDo you know what year was that?\nThat was in 1942 in the beginning.\nWhen you had the typhus, you didn't have any medical care, I assume.\nNo, no.\nJust had to pass, exit.\nYeah, yeah. We were laying in the thing they got separated, quarantined, you know. You have to go\ninto that quarantine and you stay there. The doctor that was taking care of us, he died of the typhoid.\nHe was an older man, I remember like today. And I got a friend of mine and he died too. He didn't\nmake it.\nThis was just from the bad conditions.\nYeah, they didn't have the food there, the fever ate you up. What else you want to know?\nAnything else you can remember about that. Then you can continue to tell me about what happened,\nyou were working in the kitchen, you were saying. . .",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Yeah, for the American Army. And I work for about four or five months. They took them out, they\nsupposed to go to Japan so they left Munich so I was without a job. The only thing, we already formed\ncommittees and this and that so I was involved in some. Then I start to look for my--to look in my\nprofession as a tinsmith. We went to try to build houses. This was kind of tough to get into.\nCan I ask you, how did the Germans, all of a sudden Germany is defeated and you are in Germany,\nhow did they?\nYou know, a lot of Germans, they say they didn't know what was going on. I say how come you\ndidn't know. You seen us marching. I was marching in Augsburg in the morning, we were marching\nfor the train. They saw in what condition we were. When I got liberated, I weigh 95 pounds, I was a\nskeleton marching. So I says how come you didn't know. And the Germans they work with us too,\nsome Germans. I ask them because they say they didn't know. You know, like when I went to a\nbakery, he didn\"t take no money from me, he give me bread, he give me cake because he felt sorry\nforme. The only thing, you couldn't trust them, I wouldn't trust them today.\nWhat about when you were growing up in Poland. Did you feel any antisemitism?\nIn my town, you know, because I was involved in going to school, public school, because I was not a\nsoftie, I was one of theirs, they couldn't fight with me; I'd fight back.\nDid they ever call you any. .\nNo, they called you. Friga (ph) friga, Jud go to Palestine. Fria is Palestinic. Other than this, I didn't\ncare because I was going to their schools and they were learning about their religion and everything.\nThe priest came for an hour so I walked out. Sometimes It was bad weather so I stayed and I listened\nto the\nteaching. I wasn't the type of guy, they did some--some Jewish boys, they wear peyes(earlocks) or\nsomething like this, they like to grab the pais. Jewish was the cheder, for school we have to go with\nthem. Afterwards like in a big city like in Sosnowiec, they already have public schools for Jews, just\nJewish public school. Where I was, we were maybe a dozen or maybe two dozen Jewish kids in the\npublic school from my town. So we kind of got a mixture and we did the same thing. Like with the\nphysical education or something like this or playing music or exercise or something, we wasn't\nbothered. It started in 1935, '37 when the Jews came from Germany - -\nThat the Polish Jews were sent back?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Back, yeah. At that time they start already to...like in the stores, they say don't buy from the Jews,\nyou know. They were picketing, they use pickets. That was the guys that were antisemites.\nOtherwise, ...\nWere you involved with any youth groups, any Zionist groups, or did you play any instruments or\nhave any hobbies?\nNo, I didn't have the time. I used to belong to the Bethar organization. The only thing I wasn't\ninvolved too much because I have to learn the trade and then I have to go to school at night and my\nuncle did feel mercy for me. I was working during the day and at night I got to do a lot of things.\nSometimes I went to meeting, I didn't get involved too much. I had friends who were not involved.\nMostly I went to synagogue for services on Shabbos.\nThat's okay. You didn't have to be involved. I'd like to go now back to the time just when you were\nliberated if that's all right. We can talk a little bit about your working for the GI's but then they\ndeparted. What happened after that?\nAfter that, when they departed, we were still in the group. We tried to go in business, building houses\nbecause I was a tinsmith. It was very tough, it was hard to get into construction. We were four or\nfive of us so we work for about a couple of years. We didn't accomplish too much. They have an\noffice, didn't make too much money. Whatever we made, we got expenses, paid the help and\neverything. In 1947, 48, we were thinking we should emigrate. We still worried about with the\nbuilding and everything until 1949.\nCan you back up and tell us, were you married by that time?\nNo, no.\nBut you had met your wife while you were working for the GI's?\nYeah, yeah. We were together, like the boys were together and the girls were together. We see each\nother. Then about 1946 - 47, we were thinking about getting married. The only thing, we wait until\nwe come to the United States and we got married in the United States in 1950.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "So you came to America together? You came with all these people?\nYeah, she came with my brother together. We didn't have nobody here. So we have to register under\nthe 200,000, I don't know if somebody tell you about this. That's the Truman's quarter. My brother\nregistered as a farmer so they took the farmers first. And the girls registered as domestic. They\nsupposed to go work for somebody. So they took them. And I was a tinsmith, I was the last one to\ngo. She went with my brother together in December, 1949 and I come in June, 1950 and I got married\nin November.\nDid you come to New York at the time?\nYeah, we were in New York. They came, she and my brother. We had a friend, he had already a\nhouse so they rent an apartment in the Bronx. When I come, I come already to a real thing. They\nalready got furniture and everything. I got a little bit of money because, you know, from the\nconstruction thing, whatever we sold and everything. So I went there with some friends. They were\nworking for the uncle, they were in the jewelry business, costume jewelry. So they tell me that I\nshould go back to Europe and get some connections for the costume jewelry, for the Catholics, you\nknow the prayer beads. Yeah, that's in Jewish hands.\nDon't tell the antisemites!\nI went back to Germany and make some connections and we're supposed to open up a business. We\ndid open up and then I got my brother, I want him to be a partner and my friend, he got a cousin, he\nwants him to be a partner. The only thing they said, because they knew the trade, they were working\nfor the uncle, both of them, they said no I can be a third partner. I said I'm not a schlamazle, you\nknow what a schlamazel is, so I says no. Either I take 50%, you don't want my brother, give me 50%,\nyou take 50. No, I give him the key. You take the business. So they paid me out and I came to the\nfarm about a year later. Meantime, my wife was working, my brother was working and I went to\nwork for Bethlehem Steel. At that time, they be remodeling the Liberty Boats--as a tinsmith. I was\nmaking good money, $2.75/hour in 1952.\nThat's great!\nYeah, I was making about $75 a week and the taxes--",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Oh, a week. First you said $75/hr.\nOh, no, $2.75 an hour. At that time it was big money. My wife was making 60 cents, my brother\nwas making 90 cents, I was the big macher. This is my son and wife and me.\nDo you have anything else that you can think of that you'd like to add? about your family? about your\nexperiences during the Holocaust?\nYou know I see a lot of things like in the Holocaust I saw some friends at night, next morning they\nwere dead, all of a sudden--that kind of experience.\nOkay, I think I'll turn off the tape now then if that's okay with you. Thank you very much.\nOkay.",
