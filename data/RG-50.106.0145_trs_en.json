        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Werner Katzenstein, conducted by Esther Finder on\nOctober 17\", 2001 in Silver Spring, Maryland. This interview is part of the\nmuseum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust survivors and witnesses who are also\nvolunteers with the museum. This is tape number one, side A. And I wanted to start\nby asking you what was your name at birth?",
        "Answer: At birth it was Werner Walter Katzenstein and curious that the German\nBoard of Register said, you\u2019ve got to have a middle name, and so my father added\nit. | dropped it when I became a citizen.",
        "Q: Where were you born and when?",
        "A: I was born April 29\", 1922 in a little town called Wallensen, i-in the county of\nHamelin, where -- the \u201cPied Piper of Hamelin\u201d? Near Hannover, in that part of\nGermany.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your hometown? Was it big or small, or --",
        "A: That was not really my hometown. My father was a manager of a farm supply\nbusiness, and in 1922 - \u201923, there was the inflation in Germany and things were\npretty bad for my grandparents in the town of Herleshausen, which is in the center\npart of Germany near the city of Eisenart. And my father came in \u201923, and he\nOctober 17, 2001\nagain started to form his own business of farm supplies, which was really the -- the\nfamily business, my grandfather had it, uncles had it and th-they dealt with farmers,\nbuying and selling. He started his business in the -- what was it? A laundry ho-\nhouse that my grandparents had. And he got on a bicycle and he started to build up\nhis own business. That was in 1923. And th-the town was about 1500 people, a\nsmall Jewish congregation of about 15 families. My grandfather was the Gabbai of\nthe congregation and I remember on Shabbas carrying out the aliyahs to the\nmembers o-of the synagogue. And I grew up, a relatively normal life, just before\nHitler, and then in 1932, I started high school in the city of Eisenart. High school\nwas not compulsory, it was voluntary. There was a small tuition but not significant.\nI started there \u201932, and I went to school by train. At the ol -- the s-students that\ntraveled by train, traveled in one compartment. When Hitler came to power April\n30\", 1933, they kicked me out of the compartment, they beat me up through the\ntrain, they chased me. In the beginning it was pretty bad, that I stayed with in the\ncity of Eisenart for a couple of weeks, and then I got back on the train and stayed\nhome again. In school not much changed, that depended on the individual teacher. I\ncan say the gym teacher used me to dust off the equipment. He made me sit on the\nequipment and he dusted [indecipherable] with my gym pants. There were\nOctober 17, 2001\nswimming lessons. We were three Jewish boys in a class, we were completely\nignorant. So that was \u2019\u00b033, and the next step was my father\u2019s business.",
        "Q: Let -- let me stop you for a just a second, you\u2019re running a little bit ahead of me.\nI need you to tell me your father\u2019s name and what he did for a living.",
        "A: My father na -- father\u2019s name was Joseph Katzenstein and my mother\u2019s name\nwas Irma. He eventually built up a very good sized business that he had first a man\nwith horse and wagon making deliveries. Much later on he bought a truck and the\nsame man become a truck driver. My mother was in the office, she had the office,\nand they sold feed -- seeds, to the farmers, and also bought grain and so on from the\nfarmers that my father sold to the mills. This was -- this is now the early 30\u2019s. In\n1935, the German government --",
        "Q: I -- I wanted to ask you one more question about your father before you went\nahead. Was your father ever in the military?",
        "A: Yes, my father was in World War I. He was in Poland and he was in a prisoner\nof war camp and he was a [indecipherable]. He said anti-Semitism was there\nalready then. He remembers a bullet of one his own comrades going past his head.\nHe, in 1919, when Germany ga-gave up, they just got on a train and went home. So\nthat was 1919 and I\u2019ll go back now to the -- \u201935.",
        "Q: One more question, did you have any brothers or sisters?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: I had one brother who survived, and he lives in the Detroit area. My father\u2019s --\nthe German government prohibited my father to buy grain from the farmer, and that\nstopped the business because the farmer could not buy from him any more. So he\nmade a decision that he wanted to leave. I have something else to [indecipherable],\nwhich I forgot. In 1933, when Hitler came to power, in our county, every Jewish\nman was put in the county prison. My father was in there for about eight, 10 days.\nThey were mistreated, but he didn\u2019t tel -- talk too much about it. He wanted to leave\nGermany right then and there, in 1933, and my mother said here -- I was born here,\nshe said, I\u2019m supposed to leave? My grandparents said, oh he was voted in, he\u2019Il be\nvoted out again. Th-Then, as I said, in \u201935, he -- we had -- the business wa-was\ngone and we had to leave. He decided where -- anywhere, but bor -- boundaries\nweren\u2019t open. He had an uncle which lived near Holland and he was able to buy\ntwo properties in Holland belonging to people in Germany. You were only\nallowed to take 10 marks out of Germany, but he bought two properties in\nHolland, and then we were allowed to move to Holland. This was 1937. And we\nhad a boarding house, we had cows. I started farming with a big Belgian horse and\nwhat else could we do?",
        "Q: So -- be -- I want to stay with -- with Germany for just a few more moments --",
        "A: Sure.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: -- ask a few more questions. When you were a young child in school, what did\nyou want to be when you grew up?",
        "A: I always wanted to be an architect, there was no doubt about that. I had planned\nthat well in advance. But I went -- the high school that I went to was a realschule.\nWe didn\u2019t have Latin, so you couldn\u2019t become a doctor, but it cou -- you could go\non t -- to any other education. But then in 1935, when we decided that we had to\nleave Germany, I quit school, I was fo -- when I was -- no six -- \u00b036. I wa -- 14,\nyou were no longer -- had ne -- compulsory to go to school, you could go out on\nyour own. And since we were going into farming, I went to work for a gardener and\nlearned a little bit there. My father knew farming quite well because he advised\nfarmers what to do. So when we came to Holland, again, we went into farming.",
        "Q: Still on Germany.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you walk me through some of the changes that the Jewish community\nexperienced after Hitler came to power? I -- now -- you -- you were -- you can talk\nabout the --",
        "A: Well, I know this --",
        "Q: -- years from \u00b033 to \u00b037.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: I know this, they had Winterhilfe, which was they collected money to help the\npoor people, the Jewish cu -- community had to do that too. My grandfather, as the\npresident of the congregation was in charge of that, and I was sent out to collect for\nWinterhilfe [indecipherable]. We were four or five Jewish children in town and at\nHebrew school we had a teacher. In those days that one man was a teacher, a\nChazzan, a Shochet, he did everything. And I remember synagogue very well. At\n1928 it was completely remo-modeled because it was very old, and I -- I remember\nthe services and all those things as a child. Be -- 1t was part of me.",
        "Q: Do you remember reading any of the newspapers in Germany while you were\nstill living there? Do you remember any anti-Semitic literature?",
        "A: I -- \u2019m sure we read a daily paper, but I-I was too young to really understand or\nto read it, I -- as I said, I was 12 -- \u201935, I was -- I was Bar Mitzvah in \u201935, and I\nmean, I-I -- I don\u2019t think I read the paper much.",
        "Q: What were you allowed to take with you when you left Germany\u201d",
        "A: [indecipherable|",
        "Q: What were you -- what could you take with you? You personally, when you left.",
        "A: We were allowed to take almost anything, and we packed with the supervision of\nthe Gestapo. We actually took two railroad cars full of farm equipment and things\nwe needed in the house. I had a stamp collection and they looked it over, obvious it\nOctober 17, 2001\nwasn\u2019t tremendous. And we got almost ready to take everything we wanted except\nthey wouldn\u2019t permit my father to take a new car. He wanted to take a new car and\nthey said no way. A -- a little sidelight. My father was suing the German\ngovernment then, for a tax matter. And they told him, if you sue the German\ngovernment, we won\u2019t let you go. So, of course he had to drop that. And then we\nwent to Holland in \u00b037.",
        "Q: Was Holland the place that you thought you would stay, or was it a stopping\npoint along a -- a larger path?",
        "A: We lived right along the German border, and my father\u2019s aim was to can you go\n-- continue leaving. I mean, he didn't want to stay there. He wanted to leave in \u00b033,\nhe certainly wanted to go on. And of course, he wanted to take as many\n[indecipherable] from Germany with him. He tried South America, you name it,\nanything. We weren\u2019t registered anywhere. And he once had permission to go to\nEngland to take -- start a training farm for the [indecipherable]. And while he was\nin Amsterdam to get his visa, or permit, whatever, he ran into a German Jewish\nattorney who knew the immigration laws. And he said, you\u2019re a farmer? You don\u2019t\ngo to England, you go to United States. My father said, how can I go to United\nStates, I\u2019m not even registered in the quota. A skilled farmer will be automatically\ninserted in the quota. So we had to present to the American consulate in\nOctober 17, 2001\nRotterdam, my father\u2019s background and we got permission to come to United\nStates. A little sidelight here. My mother\u2019s father, my grandfather had come to us,\nto live with us in Holland after we had applied to come to the United States, and of\ncourse we wanted to take him with us. And sad to say that the American consul in\nRotterdam was anti-Semitic. He told my father, if he asks me once more, I won\u2019t\nget you go. So my grandfather stayed in Amsterdam with a cousin of my father\u2019s,\nand he died a natural death in 1941. But the cousin, husband, they got killed. We\nleft June 9\", 1939 [indecipherable] Amsterdam to come to the United States.",
        "Q: Tell me about the time that you stayed in Holland. How -- how much were you\naware of what was going on in Germany?",
        "A: Very much so. As I said, we lived along the border, and people came to us\nillegally and we had a sort of an underground railroad, where we would help the\npeople that came in, got a taxi for him in the town of Arcen, where we lived. And\nhe would take them to the nearest Jewish community in Fendler. And they would\nthen help these people to get further into Holland for -- then they were allowed to\nstay. I mean, we had cases where people went right back. One of the Dutch border\npolicemen ha -- was forced to put some people back into Germany, and he told me,\nI won\u2019t do that again. And you know, thing -- when they were caught they were\ndone for. This was right after Kristallnacht, yeah. Yeah, tha -- there wasn\u2019t much\nOctober 17, 2001\nafter that. I mean, we got our permission to go, we sold our property and -- until\neverything was ordered, til we have our tickets.",
        "Q: How do people know how to find you on this underground railroad?",
        "A: Believe it or not, the German border police helped. They said, over there 1s a --\nanother Jew. He will help you. There were some German border police that did that.\nSome came over blind and somehow wound up with us. Since we had a boarding\nhouse in addition to being farmers -- also the Dutch border police would bring them\nto us while they would try to get permission to stay. One or two did, but most of\nthem didn\u2019t. I mean, they put them across the border they could turn around, come\nright back. But what really happened to most of them, we don\u2019t know. I know one\nman, he went back up in Vienna. And we even moved from our farm after we sold,\nto another town near Fendler called Blerick, and he wrote to Mr. Katzenstein, near\nFendler, and the letter got to us. I don\u2019t know whether he survived or not.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what you heard about KristalInacht from where you were?",
        "A: I was in Holland, I wasn\u2019t in Germany, and I know the -- from the Jewish point\nof view, we were permish -- we had permission to do anything. We were -- don\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t have to observe the Jewish laws about Shabbat. We just helped the people\nthat came. That\u2019s -- I mean, I -- I -- as we heard -- of course we heard the news and\nso on, what happened in Germany. That year, \u201938, my grandmother died on the last\nOctober 17, 2001\nday of Hanukah. And of course my father didn\u2019t go back to Germany. I went back\n-- I was a 16 year old and I went back to the funeral. I\u2019m here. I was -- I came back\nagain.",
        "Q: What was your -- what was your legal status as you were going back and forth\nfrom Holland to Germany for this fu --",
        "A: We were Germans. We were Germans. We were German citizens. In fact, we\nhad to go to the German consulate in Mastreif then had the J, Jude, put into our\npassports. We had G-German passports. Look, our legal status in Holland was that.\nWhen I came to United States we were enemy aliens. I went into the army as an\nenemy alien.",
        "Q: When you left Germany, were you able to say goodbye to family and friends?",
        "A: Not really. There was one German farmer who wanted to say goodbye to us, but\nhe couldn\u2019t do it openly. And he got on the train with us to say goodbye and went\nwith us a couple of stations and then he went back. So -- but otherwise, there was\nno saying goodbye. The relative -- we had no relatives in town, maybe we said\ngoodbye to the Jewish families that were there. By the way, I -- the record at the\nHolocaust Mu-Museum, I know that all the people that didn\u2019t get out shortly after\nwe got out, they all got killed.",
        "Q: Did you have any regrets at all about leaving Germany\u201d\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Not at all, Pll give you a -- a [indecipherable] question. You know, I mentioned\nI was in the American army. And we have a reunion -- ma -- the company, not the\ndivision, I was in hundred infantry division. And we had a reunion and one -- the\nwife of one of my comrades asked me how -- how -- what did you -- how did you\nfeel like fighting the Germans? I said, very gladly. They would have killed me if I\nwouldn't have go-gotten out. No, there was no regret about leaving Germany for a\nsecond.",
        "Q: Is there anything about your time in Germany or in Holland that we haven\u2019t\ndiscussed that you\u2019d like to mention before we move into the next stage.",
        "A: Probably after you leave I'll remember, which is normal. I mentioned my\nfather\u2019s experience, I mentioned our experience in Holland. Nothing outstanding.\nWe had -- we had the boarding house and people coming across the border. Ha -- ha\n-- [remember I had to sleep in the haystack a couple of nights once because we had\nso many people. But nothing outstanding.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in Holland?",
        "A: No. Not at all. At least we didn\u2019t. My wife told you the experience of her father,\nbut we have personally -- that personal contact we had was absolutely good. I -- I\ndon\u2019t -- I could mention something, but it\u2019s not off the record. You want to stop for\na second?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: No, we-we\u2019ll continue.",
        "A: Okay. I-I met somebody recently, here, whose mother came from the same town\nwhere I lived in Holland. And it\u2019s a small world, but th -- I didn't know her. I knew\nher family and we -- there are many people that we both knew. So, she lives right\nhere. I haven\u2019t met her yet, we just talked on the phone.",
        "Q: When you left Holland, did -- did you have any expectations about what your\nnew home, where you\u2019re going to be arriving soon, was like?",
        "A: No, our aim was to become farmers. Whe -- when and where, we had no idea.\nMy f -- they were German Jewish real estate agents who took you under their wing\nand tried to sell you a farm. We were [indecipherable] into New York and my\nfather entered a federal land pact in, I think it was Somerville, New Jersey, and he\nbought a farm from a piece of paper. We had -- had three houses. Had over 120\nacres, 150 acres, and he bought that on a piece of paper. This Jewish Agricultural\nSociety, we had some money fro -- obviously from selling our property, and the\nJewish Agricultural Society gave us a second mortgage to build a chicken coop.\nThere were Jewish people in the area who were very helpful and I know there was\none family, they picked up my mother every week to go to Camden to the shircha\nto go to the butcher store and so on. I mean they were very helpful.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: Were you helped by any Jewish agencies or were they just individuals who\nhelped you?",
        "A: No, we ha -- no -- the Jewish Agricultural Society, but o-otherwise, these real\nestate people were private salesmen and they -- they didn't help you.",
        "Q: Nobody like HIAS or anybody else?",
        "A: No, no, we were not involved with that.",
        "Q: Okay. Before we get too much into your life in the United States, how did you\ncome to the United States, how did you travel here?",
        "A: In the [indecipherable]. Was a new boat. We went third class, we couldn\u2019t\nafford anything better, and was the time of the World\u2019s Fair and the people were\ncoming from all over the world. E-Eventually, after we were in New York we\nrented a room with somebody in Washington Heights, and two of my uncles were\nwor -- had jobs at the World\u2019s Fair and eventually we wound up -- I said, everybody\nis coming, why don\u2019t we go? In those days the subway was a nickel. And we went\nout there to look and the thing that impressed me most was the ice water dispenser\nat the General Elec -- General Motors exhibit. That impressed me most. My mother\nwas very disappointed. There was a place that sold root beer and it didn\u2019t taste at all\nlike the beer she expected. We looked for farms and as I said, we bought a place\nwith three houses. The first we moved into one house, good one -- two story, and\nOctober 17, 2001\nthen we sold the two newer houses to je -- also German Jewish families that had\ncome. One family came from Berlin, one family came from Frankfurt, and we\nmoved in the old house, which had nothing. The -- the hot water was made on the\nstove in the kitchen. No heating system. Water, we had a well, and we had a -- we\nhad a pump 1n there, and we couldn\u2019t afford a deep well pump, so a plumber came\nand he built a platform in the well from which a regular pump could supply us with\nwater. There was a Jewish plumber in Camden who would underwrite a loan so we\ncould build a heating system, which of course he built. So we got a heating system,\nwe got hot water and we started farming. At first I worked with a team of horses.\nTook a few years til we could afford a tractor, but again, we raised chicken feed.\nWe grew corn, we grew wheat, and that we used for a chicken feed. The salesman\nfor the feed dealer sold us our first car. This was 1939 - \u201940 - \u00b041 -- \u201940. And he --\nwas oh, I think a \u201926 - \u201928 Chevy or Ford, whatever. But now we had a car. My\nfather had to get a driver\u2019s license, but that was no problem. And --",
        "Q: Tell me how you found out that war had broken out in Europe. How did you\nlearn about it?",
        "A: Oh, we had a radio, we listened to the news, we got a daily paper. So we knew\none what -- knew what was going on in the world. And of course, Hitler came into\nHolland, what was it, we left June ninth, he went into Holland May first. So we\nOctober 17, 2001\nknew that we got out by the skin of our teeth, and we could breathe a little heavier,\nalthough we were worried about the [indecipherable] that were left behind. I had,\nin the meantime, *39 - \u201940, most of the relatives that were in -- were left in\nGermany had gotten out. There was one uncle who was interned in England in the\nKitchener camp, but he got permission to come here and he came too. Came to us\nfirst, working on the farm.",
        "Q: When you came to this country, did anybody ask you about your experiences in\nEurope?",
        "A: Not that I remember. I -- I didn\u2019t go to school, I was 17, I was old enough to stay\nout, and maybe I\u2019m regretting it or not, but my brother went to high school, and\nliterally I went with him. I had all the books. I learned lot of history, I learned a lot\nof things by just reading. I\u2019m still a -- learning.",
        "Q: Were you able to keep in touch with people that you had left behind in Germany\nwhen you came to the United States?",
        "A: In the beginning yes, but then when in \u201941 the U.S. entered the war, even postal\ncommunication was difficult. Eventually the ones that were left behind got killed.",
        "Q: But in the correspondence that you were able to get, what kinds of things did\nthey write about?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Literally nothing. The -- look, the mail was censored, they knew that. And they\njust that we do fine -- look, I -- we are now translating correspondence like that,\nwe're -- a-at the museum, and it\u2019s all -- the letters are repetitive. That\u2019s all the s --\nbecause that\u2019s all they could tell.",
        "Q: So you were in your late teens and working\u2019? Was that something that you\nwanted to continue to do indefinitely, is -- to do the --",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Is that what you wanted to do?",
        "A: Well, fr -- I -- I loved farming, and some people can\u2019t understand that, but I did.\nI raised chickens, we grew corn, I worked with a tractor and my father built up a\nretail route in Camden. And the nearest congregation was in Haddonfield, New\nJersey, or Haddon Heights, New Jersey. And since we were fairly observant, we\ndidn't go to synagogue except at the high holidays, where we usually went to New\nYork where a -- my uncles lived. So we went there. We had some -- some family in\nPhiladelphia found us, distant relatives and we went there occasionally. Like when\nmy brother became Bar Mitzvah on the farm, some -- he went to Philadelphia to\nget his Bar Mitzvah lessons, and then from Philadelphia they [indecipherable]\nfor his Bar Mitzvah.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: What stands out in your mind about the time from \u201939 when the war broke out in\nEurope until Pearl Harbor?",
        "A: Well, there was really -- I mean, the war was going on. We knew that and we\nwere very glad that we were in the United States. And I had to register for the draft\n[indecipherable] enemy alien. Legally, we were not alle -- allowed to leave New\nJersey. We weren\u2019t supposed to go to Philadelphia or anything, and once 1n awhile\nwe asked for a travel permission, but usually we went when we could. And I got\nregistered for the draft and my father tried to have me deferred because he needed\nme for the farm. But after many, many applications, eventually he was denied and I\nhad to -- to register and I was drafted in March of 1944, as an enemy alien. I only\nbecame a citizen after I was 1n the army.",
        "Q: Tell me your reaction to Pearl Harbor. When you heard about it, what -- what\ndid you think?",
        "A: Oh, I was shocked, of course, absolu -- heard it on the radio, and in a way a --\nthis happened, so we\u2019re in -- totally involved now. I mean a -- in a w-way I knew\nthat I ha-had to go in and a -- a -- it was a hundred percent American, even though I\nwasn\u2019t a citizen yet. And I felt very glad that things had come to that point.",
        "Q: Tell me about your military service. When exactly did you start and -- and what\ntraining did you receive?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Well, I was drafted March 27\", 1944, which later on turned out to be my wife\u2019s\nbirthday. And I was sent for basic training to Camp Blanding in Florida, infantry\nbasic. I was classified not for 1 -- outright infantry, but infantry in -- I and R,\nIntelligence and Reconnaissance. Not that it helped any. Was still infantry basic.\nAnd when that was finished I had to report to Fort Mead, Maryland, and\nsupposedly to go to the Pacific. But then a rule came out, anybody over 23 goes to\nEurope and since I was over 23, I a -- I mean a -- over -- I-I was reclassified to go\nto Europe. I was then sent to the hundred -- to join the hundred infantry division in\nFort Bragg, North Carolina. Company --",

        "A: I joined the hundred infantry division at Fort Bragg and we prepared to go\noverseas. We had some more training, obstacle course and so -- and so on, under\nfire. And then, eventually, we got ready to go. I think, yeah, it was Yom Kippur\nwhen we left Fort Bragg and we went on to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. We\nonly spent a few days there. Since I was close to home I got permission to go home\na couple of times. But then when we boarded the transport and we ar -- and we\u2019re in\na convoy of the hundred infantry division. We left about that time, we arrived\n[indecipherable] Gibraltar in the Marseilles area around November first. And\nthen we went up through the mountains t -- into the Vosges mountain range. We\nactually went on the line around septem -- November first and -- where we relieved\nthe 45\" infantry division. We went out on a patrol and I think the patrol of my first\nplatoon was the first combat action of the division. And we went back and then we\ngot into combat from -- attacked a few towns, took a few towns. And on the sixth or\nseventh November in the town of [indecipherable], I got wounded. You know, the\nsaying is you take the town and the high ground beyond it. The Germans were on\nthe high ground. We were in the town. And I was lucky I got not -- I got wounded\nand came out to a field hospital -- or a field hospital to a -- in a battalion he -- first\naid station, then to a field hospital where they operated on me to remove the\nshrapnel from the wound. It was in my buttock. And I remember clearly s --\nOctober 17, 2001\neveryone saying, who do we have here? Katzenstein, pronounced in perfect\nGerman. And I was hoping this wasn\u2019t a German doctor. Anyhow, I woke up the\nnext day in a field hospital, believe it or not, a German, wounded German prisoner\nof war was lying next to me. Curiosity, I started talking to him. All I have to give\nyou is my name and number. He wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Maybe he thought we were\npulling a trick, but I was there and then I was -- I don\u2019t know, four or five, six days.\nThen we were put on a train to get to the nearest hospital, I think at Besancon. And\non that train there were only sitting and walking patients. I couldn\u2019t sit. They had to\nput up a stretcher for me in the supply car. And I was there a few days. There was\nsome movie actress with us, I don\u2019t remember who it was. And as I said in the\nbeginning I was classified lightly wounded. They took me now off on a stretcher\nand I stayed there, I don\u2019t know, a week or so. And there they sewed up the buttock\nwound. Stayed there, I don\u2019t remember, til they thought I was well enough. And the\ndoctor was very kind. A milit -- a medical officer is out to get you back to the front\ntoo mu -- as quick as possible. A doctor was try to keep you in the hospital as long\nas possible. And this one said, evacuation to the rear.",
        "Q: To what?",
        "A: To the rear. And I wound up in a hospital which at one time had been a -- a\nGerman hospital, a army hospital in the Exon Provence. And stayed there for\nOctober 17, 2001\nawhile. I remember there was a case of a German prisoner of war who had lockjaw.\nAnd somehow they found out I spoke German, so they took me and our doctor and\na nurse into that room. The doctor wanted to give him massive dose of antitoxin,\nand I had to translate to the German medic what they were going to do. I really\ndon\u2019t know whether the man survived or not. I stayed there a little while longer and\nthen I wound up again in the field replacement hospital, where I volunteered for KP\non Christmas. I had experienced that on Jewish holidays I didn\u2019t have to -- to work,\nso I figured here let\u2019s have somebody Christian have a chance to have the day off.\nSo on Christmas I volunteered KP duty. Came back to my outfit -- what was\nhappen -- November sixth -- around January sixth or seventh, and first to the\nkitchen and then they brought me up front. And we were in a position right in the\nMaginot Line. And we were pretty scared to begin with. But a infantry platoon is\n40 men when they are full strength. When I came back, my platoon was 20 men, of\nwhich I knew 10. So you can imagine what they had gone through while I was\naway. But from then on, through the end of fighting -- I mean, I had some more\nexperiences, but combat was combat. We went through the Siegfried line, we went\ndown towards Mannheim. One thing, once we were in Germany we didn\u2019t dig f --\ndig foxholes any more, we slept in houses. And one of the worst battle ec -- battle\nexperience I had was the city of Heidelberg. Heidelberg was sort of on a hill at the\nOctober 17, 2001\nNeckar river. And the Germans for some reason or other, put up stiff resistance,\nvery stiff. Some companies had gotten across the Neckar river, we were still on the\nother side. But then we had to go across. And on broad daylight, under German fire,\nwe crossed the river. Not everybody made it. Then we went up the hill and through\nthe Knorr soup f-factory that was on top of the hill. And the tanks of the soup\nconcentrate had been hit with artillery. We actually went up the hill in Knorr\nconcentrate. And we had to take the factory. After we took the factory, we had then\ntake -- fought street by street to take the city of Heidelberg. I mean, the Germans\nwere just unbelievable. Then we had finally took the garrison, which they were still\nholding. And after we took that, they gave up -- at the le -- what was left, they left.\nAnd that -- a day or two, I -- later I was supposed to go on furlough, and I\nremember they sent me back to battalion headquarters, and that was the morning\nthat President Roosevelt died. Company captain that I knew told us that Roosevelt\nhad died. Went on furlough, first they put us into a German town, but then they\ndecided no more resort in Germany, and we were sent on to France. Then spent\nthere a few days, went back -- Passover they pulled us off the front line and gave a\nSeder in a German hotel. The hundred infantry division had a Jewish chaplain,\nHerbert Eskin was the name, I remember him well. And we had a Seder there.\nWasn\u2019t much of a Seder, you know, but you were away from combat for a few\nOctober 17, 2001\ndays, and then we went back. And I don\u2019t remember the date when we stopped\nfighting. When we got to the outskirts of Stuttgart, we actually went into\noccupation. We occupied a town here, occupied at town there. And that was the end\nof combat. The war was -- wasn\u2019t over yet. I tried to get to military government. I\nmean, I figured I had enough at the end of the [inaudible]. But -- went to the\nnearest -- no, I wrote to military government. A friend of mine was the sec -- the\ncompany clerk. And we wrote and they sent back, sorry, it has to go through\nchannels. So it went through channels. Company commander who during combat\nwouldn\u2019t let me go, when he came back, he okayed my transfer. And then I went to\nmilitary government and I wound up in a county right next to the county where my\nfather came from. And th -- this was the northernmost county in the American zone,\nand that was the first county in the British zone. And there was an uncle and aunt of\nmy father\u2019s that had come back from Theresienstadt. And of course I went to see\nthem. And everybody in the States sent me packages for them. And then military\ngovernment was very interesting. It was the starting up of German government.\nFirst we -- they needed travel permission for anything they w-wanted to go. The\nstarting of political parties -- at first political parties were only permitted on the\ncounty level, and then, of course it spread. And --\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: Just -- just one moment, let\u2019s let this -- sirens pass. [tape break] Okay, we\u2019re\nback, the sirens have passed.",
        "A: There isn\u2019t much more to tell after that.",
        "Q: Let me ask a few questions. I wanted to know your beginning rank and your\nending rank of your military service. Your rank. Your military rank.",
        "A: When?",
        "Q: No, what was your military rank?",
        "A: Oh, I -- I was a corporal. They promised me more if I would stay. They wanted\nto keep me in the worst way. When I had enough points to go home, I went home.\nThey couldn\u2019t keep me another day.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in the military?",
        "A: Not really. There may have been a few guys that were not -- had no experiences\nwith Jews, but in combat, there was no question.",
        "Q: When you arrived in Europe for your military service, how much did you know\nabout what was happening to the Jews?",
        "A: Well, when we went into combat, we knew -- this was \u201944 -- we knew that there\nwere concentration camps and we knew that people are -- were getting killed, but\nnot that much in detail.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: Did you ever read the \u201cStars and Stripes\u201d magazine while you were in service?\nI don\u2019t --",
        "A: Yes, we got that regularly. And I don\u2019t think there was too much in there about\nit. | don\u2019t remember, anyhow.",
        "Q: Where were you on V-E day?",
        "A: V-E day, I -- we were still -- I was not military government yet. We were in a\ntown -- I think was Kinitling, whatever it was called. We were doing occupation\nduty. And we were getting ready to be shipped to Japan. Hundred infantry\n[indecipherable] we were supposed to go out by way of Marseilles. And when V-\nE day came we were unhappy that they changed our orders, because most people\nwent to United States first and then go to Japan, even though we were supposed to\ngo to Marseilles and then go to Japan, but for us it was over. I mean, the -- we did\noccupation duty. Was interesting, I mean, we started schools in -- within our units\nand I taught chicken farming, I taught German, and we had all kinds of talent. We\nhad a guy with a Master\u2019s degree in English, you name it. The most liked class was\ncar repair because, you know, that was everybody\u2019s interest. We had all kinds of\ninterests there and that was very interesting. I ran the day room and I was giving\nnews broadcasts to the company from what I heard on the radio. But this was now\n45, you know, the war was over, so there wasn\u2019t much happening any more.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: When did you realize the full extent of the Holocaust?",
        "A: I think I\u2019d -- I- didn\u2019t realize it until I came out of the service, til I came back\nhome and really learned of things that had happened. When I came home, th -- of\ncourse there was more information available. But during the time in the service, it\nwas not too much.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s pause again. [tape break] Okay, we\u2019re back. Apparently there are a lot of\nsirens out there. After the war, while you were still doing occupation service, what\nefforts did you make personally to try and find family or friends who might have\nsurvived?",
        "A: Pll be honest, I didn\u2019t make too many efforts. As I said, I was in military\ngovernment. I knew -- I found out who was killed and where the others were that I\nknew by then, and I really didn\u2019t make too many efforts. I now feel guilty about that\nat times.",
        "Q: When exactly did you leave Europe?",
        "A: To come home? Oh, April 30\", I guess it was \u201946. Was -- my birthday was April\n29\u2018, And my brother at that time was stationed at Fort Dix, and I of course ha -- I\nwent to Fort Dix to get discharged and our -- my birthday present was a Broadway\nshow at Fort Dix.",
        "Q: How had things changed in the United States when you came back?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: How what?",
        "Q: How had things changed in the U.S. when you came back?",
        "A: Well, I remember there had been gasoline rationing and I think there were still\nthings being rationed. Things -- the economy was trying -- now had to change from\na wartime economy to a peacetime economy and I think one of the biggest mistakes\nwas when people said to go back the way it was before. There was no way of going\nback the way it was before. That didn\u2019t exist any more.",
        "Q: How had you changed during your time in Europe?",
        "A: Well, I sort of, I guess made a promise to myself, since I survived, that I would\nbecome more observant. And I did this gradually, I mean from -- during the war,\neverything was permitted, but then I did this gradually. I -- at home, on the farm, I\nnever did any work that wasn\u2019t necessary, even before the war. And now there was\nno business on Shabbat, you know, people didn\u2019t come in to buy eggs or things.\nAnd it got known. My parents were not quite as observant as I was, and of course I\nbecame even more observant when I got married.",
        "Q: How did you meet your wife?",
        "A: Blind date in Brooklyn. She doesn\u2019t like it when I give the complete story, so I\nwon\u2019t. If you want to take it off the record, Pll take it off the record. I can\u2019t do that\nto her.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want to get in any trouble here. Just tell me briefly, what -- what was\nyour wife\u2019s background? Was she born in this country?",
        "A: She was -- when I met her she was a legal secretary in New York, and when she\ncame to Vineland there was an attorney in the neighborhood who asked her to\ncome in to help. She stayed there for quite a few years to help. And when I came to\nVineland, I worked for my in-laws. They had -- my father-in-law and his brother\nhad a -- a big farm at -- a chicken farm, at first. And then when the chicken business\nwent, as they say in Yiddish, indraya, he switched to dairy farming because he,\nafter all, that was his experience, too. We --",
        "Q: I have to ask you to translate. I know what that means, but you need to translate.",
        "A: Oh, it means, in the [indecipherable] literally translate, in the [indecipherable]\nit\u2019s just done for. The reason for this was that, you know, all these people that came\nout of the camps and had came to the United States, chicken farming was a very\nattractive business. You didn\u2019t have to speak English with the chickens. And the\nonly way at the end that the feed dealers could compete with each other was well,\nthey extend more credit. And when that done, overextension of credit, with no help\nfrom the U.S. government, chicken business went down the drain. So my father\nthen went to dairy farming. We converted chicken coops into cow stables and I was\nable to do most -- I was able to do plumbing, you name it. You do everything\nOctober 17, 2001\nyourself. We had hurricanes. Oh yeah, hurricane Hazel, and -- destroyed in our area\nmany chicken coops. In 1955 I decided I couldn\u2019t make a living on the farm,\nbecause my wife\u2019s paycheck had to go to the feed dealer to pay for the feed bill. So,\nmy father had a small route, detail route in the Haddonfield, Haddon Heights area,\nCherry Hill came just in existence. So I decided in *55, I\u2019m going to start knocking\ndoors. And after a year or two I built up my own route and I built up my own\nbusiness, and worked well.",
        "Q: Just for the record, what -- what\u2019s your wife\u2019s full name?",
        "A: Inge Eva Katzenstein.",
        "Q: Do you have children?",
        "A: Yes. We have three children. We have our oldest son, Michael lives in the\nBoston area, has two boys. Our second one, David lives in New Jersey. He has five\nchildren, four girls and a boy, and our daughter lives in Pittsburg and she has a\ndaughter and a son.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about some of the historical events.",
        "A: [indecipherable] what?",
        "Q: Historical events since the war. How closely did you follow the Nuremberg\ntrials?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: As close as I could here, in the news I mean. And I knew some of the people that\nwere being tried, I am -- I knew their backgrounds, you know, from experience.\nRibbentrop, Papen, I mean all -- I knew the German governments then, and I\nknew who did what, and we knew who was lying. And I was not asked, you know,\nto get involved. I mean, I know people that did, but I followed it. Look, what\u2019s his\nname? Ribbentrop was the foreign minister. A cousin of my mother\u2019s was an ob-\ngyn in Berlin, he delivered Ribbentrop\u2019s son. Was in those days -- later on, Pope\nPius the 12\", who was in Berlin at that time, my mother\u2019s cousin knew him. H-He\nworked in a Catholic hospital. I mean, this was \u00b037 -- \u201936 - \u201937. He got out, but that\nhad nothing to do with it.",
        "Q: Did you feel that justice was done at Nuremberg?",
        "A: Yes. They -- I think they did go -- very well that -- I don\u2019t think they let many\nstay alive that should have been killed.",
        "Q: Also, in -- at around that same time period, the U.N. debated on the partition of\nPalestine. Was that something that was of interest to you?",
        "A: Yes, that was of interest to me, because after all, we did want a Jewish state. And\nat the time that seemed to be the only way possible to get it. And of course, the rest\nis history. What\u2019s happening now we all know very well.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: There are some things that happened in this country, a-after the war -- you know,\nin years since the war. The Korean war and the war in Vietnam. Did these have any\nimpact on your life?",
        "A: Well, I followed them as much as I could. Whether they were justified, I don\u2019t\nknow. Did -- I gave them thought, wh -- ho -- whether we did too much, or not\nenough, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Also in this country, I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights movement.\nGiven your personal background, how did you feel about what was going on in this\ncountry?",
        "A: Iam for the Civil Rights 100 percent. I know this, in the army basic training, one\nof the lieutenants I worked with was a college professor from Georgia, and I\nquestioned him, how can you treat the negroes like this? And he says, the negro has\nto stay in his place. I mean, of course I didn't agree with him, but who was I to\nargue? He was a college professor. But the Civil Rights, absolutely.",
        "Q: Did you follow the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem?",
        "A: Oh, whatever we are able to hear here, yes.",
        "Q: Did you feel that the way it was reported here in this country was -- was fair and\nobjective?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: I -- I really don\u2019t know. They did s -- report as much as they wanted to. Look, I\nknow a friend of mine here started an organization to protest to the Washington\u2019s\nPost anything that they report that\u2019s detrimental to Israel. So I-I mean we -- the\npapers do one thing and not always what we like. Look, what\u2019s happening between\nour government and Israel right now 1s ridiculous at times.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you wanted to share about your professional career?\nBecause I have some questions about your retirement.",
        "A: Well, I enjoyed it. You know, I built up a retail route, 1955, and knocked doors\nand eventually got acquainted with an awful lot of people, and I think in many cases\nI became a member of the family. At first we were parents talking about children.\nThey we were talking about par -- children\u2019s education, and eventually about\nchildren\u2019s going out and gr-grandchildren. So -- this is, by the way 1s not just -- that\nI had just Jewish customers. I knocked doors to door and I sold chickens and eggs\nand you name it, and I enjoyed it.",
        "Q: When did you move to Washington, D.C.?",
        "A: I guess it was -- be in to -- I think December 798.",
        "Q: And why did you move here?",
        "A: There were several reasons. Number one, my wife\u2019s mother had been mentally\ndeteriorated, and we ha -- and physically also. We had her in a home in Atlantic\nOctober 17, 2001\nCity. And then, my sister-in-law lived here for over 20 years, and she\u2019s said the\nhome here in Washington is much better, so we had her transferred to the Hebrew\nhome. And for me again, one of the personal reasons, I tried to slowly liquidate my\nbusiness. I\u2019d gotten to a point where I was making many monthly deliveries, many\ndeliveries twice a month, and when I decided I was going to go only monthly\ndeliveries, then we decided to come here. Also religious reason. The synagogue in\nVineland where I went to on Shabbas closed down. And the oth -- there was\nanother synagogue but on Shabbas I had to walk 40 minutes, and I was getting a\nlittle too old for that. And then here, where we moved to, I have a 10 minute walk to\nsynagogue. We are walking distance to four different Orthodox synagogues and --\nand from a kosher point of view everything 1s right at your fingertips. I\u2019m enjoying\nit.",
        "Q: How did you get involved with the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum?",
        "A: My brother-in-law, Kurt Pauly had volunteered there already for a number of\nyears, and we decided, if we can contribute something, we can. And yes, they could\nuse people that translated German into English. And we got and they were very\nhappy to have us. And we\u2019ve been doing this now for a long time. We go in at least\none day a week and it\u2019s sometimes not so nice to do what we\u2019re doing because we\nOctober 17, 2001\ncan read between the lines how people are suffering, and most of the\ncorrespondence that we translate is of people that did not survive. And I\u2019m very\nglad we\u2019re going.",
        "Q: Do you speak publicly about your experiences?",
        "A: We ha -- didn\u2019t volunteer at the museum for the speaker\u2019s bureau, we haven\u2019t\nbeen asked. Yeah, I think we volunteered once, but we haven\u2019t been asked. Our\nformer next door neighbor is a schoolteacher here in the Montgomery County, or\nHoward County, I don\u2019t know. And she arranged for us to speak to a public\nschool, one day not long ago. And it was something we enjoyed, and the children\nenjoyed, and th -- there were a lot of questions. I guess they were 10 or 11 year\nolds, and they -- I guess that they had seen -- what 1s it, the David\u2019s world, or\nsomething they had seen. Or --",
        "Q: \u201cDaniel\u2019s Story\u201d?",
        "A: Yeah, or -- no, also Anne -- Anne Frank. They knew about that and they asked\nus many personal questions and we enjoyed it. Look, we were in Germany. The\ncity of Cologne invited people, and we were there, I guess it was \u201986 - 87. And\nthey bent over backwards to supply us with kosher food and so on. And there also\nwe wa -- we asked to speak to schoolchildren, school students. And we asked to\nOctober 17, 2001\nhigher school students. And there the questions were, of course, completely\ndifferent. And the point I always made is -- how shall I say it?",
        "Q: Pll pause. [tape break] Okay, we\u2019re back, now that you\u2019ve collected your\nthoughts.",
        "A: The point that I made was repeating something that a German mayor told me\nwhile I was in military government. And this was 1945. And he said, Mr.\nKatzenstein, I hope that the occupation stays here until this generation is dead. And\nthis 1s what I repeated to the German high school students, because many of them\ntold us, my mother is still a Nazi. I mean, this was now \u201987. So this 1s what a\nGerman mayor told me, and that was sort of the point that I made.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Werner Katzenstein. This is tape number two,\nside A. And you were telling me about your -- your visit to Germany. Was that the\nonly time since the war that you\u2019ve been to Germany?",
        "A: Yes. No, no, we were recently, but that had no connection. We were back\nrecently going to Belgium, going to Germany, and to Amsterdam. This time, my\nsister-in-law, we went together again, the two couples. And our oldest son came to\nCologne and to -- they went from cemetery to cemetery to look up the places where\nthe family, my wife\u2019s family came from. And we went to the house where my\nmother-in-law was born and you know, many places like that. We went to the house\nwhere my wife grew up. But that was just recently. When I was back in Germany,\nthat was the city of Cologne and they invited people that were born in the Cologne\narea, there were 40 people, 20 from ger -- from U.S. and 20 from Israel. That was a\nvery interesting experience, but I don\u2019t think it showed us much, that the Germans\nhad changed that much. I know this, Friday night they took us to synagogue by bus\nand then we walked back to the hotel. And they had two men walking bus -- us,\nofficially that we wouldn\u2019t get lost. I think it was for security reasons. They were --\nin \u201987, I mean there\u2019s -- Germany 1s still you don\u2019t feel a hundred percent secure.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "Q: Is there anything that you and I have not spoken about today that you would like\nto add before we conclude? You had some thoughts before that you were kind of\nworking on.",
        "A: [really can\u2019t think of anything specific that didn\u2019t come up -- you know, a few\nthings did come up, but as I said before, going back to Germany was nothing\njoyful. Yes, when I came home somebody said, how was it going back to your\nhome? Coming back to New Jersey, that was going back home, not when I was\nover there. Yeah, we came back, I went back to farming. My brother, by that time\nwas in college and he -- he took chemical engineering. He found quickly\nengineering was not for him. He went -- he became a chemist and he\u2019s doing well.",
        "Q: All right, if -- if you have nothing else t -- nothing else to add?",
        "A: Can\u2019t think of anything at this moment. Probably after your gone 10 minutes.",

        "Answer: At birth it was Werner Walter Katzenstein and curious that the German\nBoard of Register said, you\u2019ve got to have a middle name, and so my father added\nit. | dropped it when I became a citizen.",
        "A: I was born April 29\", 1922 in a little town called Wallensen, i-in the county of\nHamelin, where -- the \u201cPied Piper of Hamelin\u201d? Near Hannover, in that part of\nGermany.",
        "A: That was not really my hometown. My father was a manager of a farm supply\nbusiness, and in 1922 - \u201923, there was the inflation in Germany and things were\npretty bad for my grandparents in the town of Herleshausen, which is in the center\npart of Germany near the city of Eisenart. And my father came in \u201923, and he\nOctober 17, 2001\nagain started to form his own business of farm supplies, which was really the -- the\nfamily business, my grandfather had it, uncles had it and th-they dealt with farmers,\nbuying and selling. He started his business in the -- what was it? A laundry ho-\nhouse that my grandparents had. And he got on a bicycle and he started to build up\nhis own business. That was in 1923. And th-the town was about 1500 people, a\nsmall Jewish congregation of about 15 families. My grandfather was the Gabbai of\nthe congregation and I remember on Shabbas carrying out the aliyahs to the\nmembers o-of the synagogue. And I grew up, a relatively normal life, just before\nHitler, and then in 1932, I started high school in the city of Eisenart. High school\nwas not compulsory, it was voluntary. There was a small tuition but not significant.\nI started there \u201932, and I went to school by train. At the ol -- the s-students that\ntraveled by train, traveled in one compartment. When Hitler came to power April\n30\", 1933, they kicked me out of the compartment, they beat me up through the\ntrain, they chased me. In the beginning it was pretty bad, that I stayed with in the\ncity of Eisenart for a couple of weeks, and then I got back on the train and stayed\nhome again. In school not much changed, that depended on the individual teacher. I\ncan say the gym teacher used me to dust off the equipment. He made me sit on the\nequipment and he dusted [indecipherable] with my gym pants. There were\nOctober 17, 2001\nswimming lessons. We were three Jewish boys in a class, we were completely\nignorant. So that was \u2019\u00b033, and the next step was my father\u2019s business.",
        "A: My father na -- father\u2019s name was Joseph Katzenstein and my mother\u2019s name\nwas Irma. He eventually built up a very good sized business that he had first a man\nwith horse and wagon making deliveries. Much later on he bought a truck and the\nsame man become a truck driver. My mother was in the office, she had the office,\nand they sold feed -- seeds, to the farmers, and also bought grain and so on from the\nfarmers that my father sold to the mills. This was -- this is now the early 30\u2019s. In\n1935, the German government --",
        "A: Yes, my father was in World War I. He was in Poland and he was in a prisoner\nof war camp and he was a [indecipherable]. He said anti-Semitism was there\nalready then. He remembers a bullet of one his own comrades going past his head.\nHe, in 1919, when Germany ga-gave up, they just got on a train and went home. So\nthat was 1919 and I\u2019ll go back now to the -- \u201935.",
        "A: I had one brother who survived, and he lives in the Detroit area. My father\u2019s --\nthe German government prohibited my father to buy grain from the farmer, and that\nstopped the business because the farmer could not buy from him any more. So he\nmade a decision that he wanted to leave. I have something else to [indecipherable],\nwhich I forgot. In 1933, when Hitler came to power, in our county, every Jewish\nman was put in the county prison. My father was in there for about eight, 10 days.\nThey were mistreated, but he didn\u2019t tel -- talk too much about it. He wanted to leave\nGermany right then and there, in 1933, and my mother said here -- I was born here,\nshe said, I\u2019m supposed to leave? My grandparents said, oh he was voted in, he\u2019Il be\nvoted out again. Th-Then, as I said, in \u201935, he -- we had -- the business wa-was\ngone and we had to leave. He decided where -- anywhere, but bor -- boundaries\nweren\u2019t open. He had an uncle which lived near Holland and he was able to buy\ntwo properties in Holland belonging to people in Germany. You were only\nallowed to take 10 marks out of Germany, but he bought two properties in\nHolland, and then we were allowed to move to Holland. This was 1937. And we\nhad a boarding house, we had cows. I started farming with a big Belgian horse and\nwhat else could we do?",
        "A: Sure.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: I always wanted to be an architect, there was no doubt about that. I had planned\nthat well in advance. But I went -- the high school that I went to was a realschule.\nWe didn\u2019t have Latin, so you couldn\u2019t become a doctor, but it cou -- you could go\non t -- to any other education. But then in 1935, when we decided that we had to\nleave Germany, I quit school, I was fo -- when I was -- no six -- \u00b036. I wa -- 14,\nyou were no longer -- had ne -- compulsory to go to school, you could go out on\nyour own. And since we were going into farming, I went to work for a gardener and\nlearned a little bit there. My father knew farming quite well because he advised\nfarmers what to do. So when we came to Holland, again, we went into farming.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I know this --\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: I know this, they had Winterhilfe, which was they collected money to help the\npoor people, the Jewish cu -- community had to do that too. My grandfather, as the\npresident of the congregation was in charge of that, and I was sent out to collect for\nWinterhilfe [indecipherable]. We were four or five Jewish children in town and at\nHebrew school we had a teacher. In those days that one man was a teacher, a\nChazzan, a Shochet, he did everything. And I remember synagogue very well. At\n1928 it was completely remo-modeled because it was very old, and I -- I remember\nthe services and all those things as a child. Be -- 1t was part of me.",
        "A: I -- \u2019m sure we read a daily paper, but I-I was too young to really understand or\nto read it, I -- as I said, I was 12 -- \u201935, I was -- I was Bar Mitzvah in \u201935, and I\nmean, I-I -- I don\u2019t think I read the paper much.",
        "A: [indecipherable|",
        "A: We were allowed to take almost anything, and we packed with the supervision of\nthe Gestapo. We actually took two railroad cars full of farm equipment and things\nwe needed in the house. I had a stamp collection and they looked it over, obvious it\nOctober 17, 2001\nwasn\u2019t tremendous. And we got almost ready to take everything we wanted except\nthey wouldn\u2019t permit my father to take a new car. He wanted to take a new car and\nthey said no way. A -- a little sidelight. My father was suing the German\ngovernment then, for a tax matter. And they told him, if you sue the German\ngovernment, we won\u2019t let you go. So, of course he had to drop that. And then we\nwent to Holland in \u00b037.",
        "A: We lived right along the German border, and my father\u2019s aim was to can you go\n-- continue leaving. I mean, he didn't want to stay there. He wanted to leave in \u00b033,\nhe certainly wanted to go on. And of course, he wanted to take as many\n[indecipherable] from Germany with him. He tried South America, you name it,\nanything. We weren\u2019t registered anywhere. And he once had permission to go to\nEngland to take -- start a training farm for the [indecipherable]. And while he was\nin Amsterdam to get his visa, or permit, whatever, he ran into a German Jewish\nattorney who knew the immigration laws. And he said, you\u2019re a farmer? You don\u2019t\ngo to England, you go to United States. My father said, how can I go to United\nStates, I\u2019m not even registered in the quota. A skilled farmer will be automatically\ninserted in the quota. So we had to present to the American consulate in\nOctober 17, 2001\nRotterdam, my father\u2019s background and we got permission to come to United\nStates. A little sidelight here. My mother\u2019s father, my grandfather had come to us,\nto live with us in Holland after we had applied to come to the United States, and of\ncourse we wanted to take him with us. And sad to say that the American consul in\nRotterdam was anti-Semitic. He told my father, if he asks me once more, I won\u2019t\nget you go. So my grandfather stayed in Amsterdam with a cousin of my father\u2019s,\nand he died a natural death in 1941. But the cousin, husband, they got killed. We\nleft June 9\", 1939 [indecipherable] Amsterdam to come to the United States.",
        "A: Very much so. As I said, we lived along the border, and people came to us\nillegally and we had a sort of an underground railroad, where we would help the\npeople that came in, got a taxi for him in the town of Arcen, where we lived. And\nhe would take them to the nearest Jewish community in Fendler. And they would\nthen help these people to get further into Holland for -- then they were allowed to\nstay. I mean, we had cases where people went right back. One of the Dutch border\npolicemen ha -- was forced to put some people back into Germany, and he told me,\nI won\u2019t do that again. And you know, thing -- when they were caught they were\ndone for. This was right after Kristallnacht, yeah. Yeah, tha -- there wasn\u2019t much\nOctober 17, 2001\nafter that. I mean, we got our permission to go, we sold our property and -- until\neverything was ordered, til we have our tickets.",
        "A: Believe it or not, the German border police helped. They said, over there 1s a --\nanother Jew. He will help you. There were some German border police that did that.\nSome came over blind and somehow wound up with us. Since we had a boarding\nhouse in addition to being farmers -- also the Dutch border police would bring them\nto us while they would try to get permission to stay. One or two did, but most of\nthem didn\u2019t. I mean, they put them across the border they could turn around, come\nright back. But what really happened to most of them, we don\u2019t know. I know one\nman, he went back up in Vienna. And we even moved from our farm after we sold,\nto another town near Fendler called Blerick, and he wrote to Mr. Katzenstein, near\nFendler, and the letter got to us. I don\u2019t know whether he survived or not.",
        "A: I was in Holland, I wasn\u2019t in Germany, and I know the -- from the Jewish point\nof view, we were permish -- we had permission to do anything. We were -- don\u2019t --\ndidn\u2019t have to observe the Jewish laws about Shabbat. We just helped the people\nthat came. That\u2019s -- I mean, I -- I -- as we heard -- of course we heard the news and\nso on, what happened in Germany. That year, \u201938, my grandmother died on the last\nOctober 17, 2001\nday of Hanukah. And of course my father didn\u2019t go back to Germany. I went back\n-- I was a 16 year old and I went back to the funeral. I\u2019m here. I was -- I came back\nagain.",
        "A: We were Germans. We were Germans. We were German citizens. In fact, we\nhad to go to the German consulate in Mastreif then had the J, Jude, put into our\npassports. We had G-German passports. Look, our legal status in Holland was that.\nWhen I came to United States we were enemy aliens. I went into the army as an\nenemy alien.",
        "A: Not really. There was one German farmer who wanted to say goodbye to us, but\nhe couldn\u2019t do it openly. And he got on the train with us to say goodbye and went\nwith us a couple of stations and then he went back. So -- but otherwise, there was\nno saying goodbye. The relative -- we had no relatives in town, maybe we said\ngoodbye to the Jewish families that were there. By the way, I -- the record at the\nHolocaust Mu-Museum, I know that all the people that didn\u2019t get out shortly after\nwe got out, they all got killed.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Not at all, Pll give you a -- a [indecipherable] question. You know, I mentioned\nI was in the American army. And we have a reunion -- ma -- the company, not the\ndivision, I was in hundred infantry division. And we had a reunion and one -- the\nwife of one of my comrades asked me how -- how -- what did you -- how did you\nfeel like fighting the Germans? I said, very gladly. They would have killed me if I\nwouldn't have go-gotten out. No, there was no regret about leaving Germany for a\nsecond.",
        "A: Probably after you leave I'll remember, which is normal. I mentioned my\nfather\u2019s experience, I mentioned our experience in Holland. Nothing outstanding.\nWe had -- we had the boarding house and people coming across the border. Ha -- ha\n-- [remember I had to sleep in the haystack a couple of nights once because we had\nso many people. But nothing outstanding.",
        "A: No. Not at all. At least we didn\u2019t. My wife told you the experience of her father,\nbut we have personally -- that personal contact we had was absolutely good. I -- I\ndon\u2019t -- I could mention something, but it\u2019s not off the record. You want to stop for\na second?\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: Okay. I-I met somebody recently, here, whose mother came from the same town\nwhere I lived in Holland. And it\u2019s a small world, but th -- I didn't know her. I knew\nher family and we -- there are many people that we both knew. So, she lives right\nhere. I haven\u2019t met her yet, we just talked on the phone.",
        "A: No, our aim was to become farmers. Whe -- when and where, we had no idea.\nMy f -- they were German Jewish real estate agents who took you under their wing\nand tried to sell you a farm. We were [indecipherable] into New York and my\nfather entered a federal land pact in, I think it was Somerville, New Jersey, and he\nbought a farm from a piece of paper. We had -- had three houses. Had over 120\nacres, 150 acres, and he bought that on a piece of paper. This Jewish Agricultural\nSociety, we had some money fro -- obviously from selling our property, and the\nJewish Agricultural Society gave us a second mortgage to build a chicken coop.\nThere were Jewish people in the area who were very helpful and I know there was\none family, they picked up my mother every week to go to Camden to the shircha\nto go to the butcher store and so on. I mean they were very helpful.\nOctober 17, 2001",
        "A: No, we ha -- no -- the Jewish Agricultural Society, but o-otherwise, these real\nestate people were private salesmen and they -- they didn't help you.",
        "A: No, no, we were not involved with that.",
        "A: In the [indecipherable]. Was a new boat. We went third class, we couldn\u2019t\nafford anything better, and was the time of the World\u2019s Fair and the people were\ncoming from all over the world. E-Eventually, after we were in New York we\nrented a room with somebody in Washington Heights, and two of my uncles were\nwor -- had jobs at the World\u2019s Fair and eventually we wound up -- I said, everybody\nis coming, why don\u2019t we go? In those days the subway was a nickel. And we went\nout there to look and the thing that impressed me most was the ice water dispenser\nat the General Elec -- General Motors exhibit. That impressed me most. My mother\nwas very disappointed. There was a place that sold root beer and it didn\u2019t taste at all\nlike the beer she expected. We looked for farms and as I said, we bought a place\nwith three houses. The first we moved into one house, good one -- two story, and\nOctober 17, 2001\nthen we sold the two newer houses to je -- also German Jewish families that had\ncome. One family came from Berlin, one family came from Frankfurt, and we\nmoved in the old house, which had nothing. The -- the hot water was made on the\nstove in the kitchen. No heating system. Water, we had a well, and we had a -- we\nhad a pump 1n there, and we couldn\u2019t afford a deep well pump, so a plumber came\nand he built a platform in the well from which a regular pump could supply us with\nwater. There was a Jewish plumber in Camden who would underwrite a loan so we\ncould build a heating system, which of course he built. So we got a heating system,\nwe got hot water and we started farming. At first I worked with a team of horses.\nTook a few years til we could afford a tractor, but again, we raised chicken feed.\nWe grew corn, we grew wheat, and that we used for a chicken feed. The salesman\nfor the feed dealer sold us our first car. This was 1939 - \u201940 - \u00b041 -- \u201940. And he --\nwas oh, I think a \u201926 - \u201928 Chevy or Ford, whatever.

        "A: Oh, we had a radio, we listened to the news, we got a daily paper. So we knew\none what -- knew what was going on in the world.

So we\nOctober 17, 2001\nknew that we got out by the skin of our teeth, and we could breathe a little heavier,\nalthough we were worried about the [indecipherable] that were left behind.

        "A: Not that I remember. I -- I didn\u2019t go to school, I was 17, I was old enough to stay\nout, and maybe I\u2019m regretting it or not, but my brother went to high school, and\nliterally I went with him.

        "A: In the beginning yes, but then when in \u201941 the U.S. entered the war, even postal\ncommunication was difficult. Eventually the ones that were left behind got killed.\nOctober 17, 2001",

And the nearest congregation was in Haddonfield, New\nJersey, or Haddon Heights, New Jersey. And since we were fairly observant, we\ndidn't go to synagogue except at the high holidays, where we usually went to New\nYork where a -- my uncles lived. So we went there. We had some -- some family in\nPhiladelphia found us, distant relatives and we went there occasionally.

We weren\u2019t supposed to go to Philadelphia or anything, and once 1n awhile\nwe asked for a travel permission, but usually we went when we could.

I was classified not for 1 -- outright infantry, but infantry in -- I and R,\nIntelligence and Reconnaissance. Not that it helped any. Was still infantry basic.\nAnd when that was finished I had to report to Fort Mead, Maryland, and\nsupposedly to go to the Pacific. But then a rule came out, anybody over 23 goes to\nEurope and since I was over 23, I a -- I mean a -- over -- I-I was reclassified to go\nto Europe.

        "A: I joined the hundred infantry division at Fort Bragg and we prepared to go\noverseas. We had some more training, obstacle course and so -- and so on, under\nfire. And then, eventually, we got ready to go. I think, yeah, it was Yom Kippur\nwhen we left Fort Bragg and we went on to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. We\nonly spent a few days there. Since I was close to home I got permission to go home\na couple of times. But then when we boarded the transport and we ar -- and we\u2019re in\na convoy of the hundred infantry division. We left about that time, we arrived\n[indecipherable] Gibraltar in the Marseilles area around November first. And\nthen we went up through the mountains t -- into the Vosges mountain range. We\nactually went on the line around septem -- November first and -- where we relieved\nthe 45\" infantry division. We went out on a patrol and I think the patrol of my first\nplatoon was the first combat action of the division. And we went back and then we\ngot into combat from -- attacked a few towns, took a few towns. And on the sixth or\nseventh November in the town of [indecipherable], I got wounded. You know, the\nsaying is you take the town and the high ground beyond it. The Germans were on\nthe high ground. We were in the town. And I was lucky I got not -- I got wounded\nand came out to a field hospital -- or a field hospital to a -- in a battalion he -- first\naid station, then to a field hospital where they operated on me to remove the\nshrapnel from the wound. It was in my buttock. And I remember clearly s --\nOctober 17, 2001\neveryone saying, who do we have here? Katzenstein, pronounced in perfect\nGerman. And I was hoping this wasn\u2019t a German doctor. Anyhow, I woke up the\nnext day in a field hospital, believe it or not, a German, wounded German prisoner\nof war was lying next to me. Curiosity, I started talking to him. All I have to give\nyou is my name and number. He wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Maybe he thought we were\npulling a trick, but I was there and then I was -- I don\u2019t know, four or five, six days.\nThen we were put on a train to get to the nearest hospital, I think at Besancon. And\non that train there were only sitting and walking patients. I couldn\u2019t sit. They had to\nput up a stretcher for me in the supply car. And I was there a few days. There was\nsome movie actress with us, I don\u2019t remember who it was. And as I said in the\nbeginning I was classified lightly wounded. They took me now off on a stretcher\nand I stayed there, I don\u2019t know, a week or so. And there they sewed up the buttock\nwound. Stayed there, I don\u2019t remember, til they thought I was well enough. And the\ndoctor was very kind. A milit -- a medical officer is out to get you back to the front\ntoo mu -- as quick as possible. A doctor was try to keep you in the hospital as long\nas possible. And this one said, evacuation to the rear.",
        "A: To the rear. And I wound up in a hospital which at one time had been a -- a\nGerman hospital, a army hospital in the Exon Provence. And stayed there for\nOctober 17, 2001\nawhile. I remember there was a case of a German prisoner of war who had lockjaw.\nAnd somehow they found out I spoke German, so they took me and our doctor and\na nurse into that room. The doctor wanted to give him massive dose of antitoxin,\nand I had to translate to the German medic what they were going to do. I really\ndon\u2019t know whether the man survived or not. I stayed there a little while longer and\nthen I wound up again in the field replacement hospital, where I volunteered for KP\non Christmas. I had experienced that on Jewish holidays I didn\u2019t have to -- to work,\nso I figured here let\u2019s have somebody Christian have a chance to have the day off.\nSo on Christmas I volunteered KP duty. Came back to my outfit -- what was\nhappen -- November sixth -- around January sixth or seventh, and first to the\nkitchen and then they brought me up front. And we were in a position right in the\nMaginot Line. And we were pretty scared to begin with. But a infantry platoon is\n40 men when they are full strength. When I came back, my platoon was 20 men, of\nwhich I knew 10. So you can imagine what they had gone through while I was\naway. But from then on, through the end of fighting -- I mean, I had some more\nexperiences, but combat was combat. We went through the Siegfried line, we went\ndown towards Mannheim. One thing, once we were in Germany we didn\u2019t dig f --\ndig foxholes any more, we slept in houses. And one of the worst battle ec -- battle\nexperience I had was the city of Heidelberg. Heidelberg was sort of on a hill at the\nOctober 17, 2001\nNeckar river. And the Germans for some reason or other, put up stiff resistance,\nvery stiff. Some companies had gotten across the Neckar river, we were still on the\nother side. But then we had to go across. And on broad daylight, under German fire,\nwe crossed the river. Not everybody made it. Then we went up the hill and through\nthe Knorr soup f-factory that was on top of the hill. And the tanks of the soup\nconcentrate had been hit with artillery. We actually went up the hill in Knorr\nconcentrate. And we had to take the factory. After we took the factory, we had then\ntake -- fought street by street to take the city of Heidelberg. I mean, the Germans\nwere just unbelievable. Then we had finally took the garrison, which they were still\nholding. And after we took that, they gave up -- at the le -- what was left, they left.\nAnd that -- a day or two, I -- later I was supposed to go on furlough, and I\nremember they sent me back to battalion headquarters, and that was the morning\nthat President Roosevelt died. Company captain that I knew told us that Roosevelt\nhad died. Went on furlough, first they put us into a German town, but then they\ndecided no more resort in Germany, and we were sent on to France. Then spent\nthere a few days, went back -- Passover they pulled us off the front line and gave a\nSeder in a German hotel. The hundred infantry division had a Jewish chaplain,\nHerbert Eskin was the name, I remember him well. And we had a Seder there.\nWasn\u2019t much of a Seder, you know, but you were away from combat for a few\nOctober 17, 2001\ndays, and then we went back. And I don\u2019t remember the date when we stopped\nfighting. When we got to the outskirts of Stuttgart, we actually went into\noccupation. We occupied a town here, occupied at town there. And that was the end\nof combat. The war was -- wasn\u2019t over yet. I tried to get to military government. I\nmean, I figured I had enough at the end of the [inaudible]. But -- went to the\nnearest -- no, I wrote to military government. A friend of mine was the sec -- the\ncompany clerk. And we wrote and they sent back, sorry, it has to go through\nchannels. So it went through channels. Company commander who during combat\nwouldn\u2019t let me go, when he came back, he okayed my transfer. And then I went to\nmilitary government and I wound up in a county right next to the county where my\nfather came from. And th -- this was the northernmost county in the American zone,\nand that was the first county in the British zone. And there was an uncle and aunt of\nmy father\u2019s that had come back from Theresienstadt. And of course I went to see\nthem. And everybody in the States sent me packages for them. And then military\ngovernment was very interesting. It was the starting up of German government.\nFirst we -- they needed travel permission for anything they w-wanted to go. The\nstarting of political parties -- at first political parties were only permitted on the\ncounty level, and then, of course it spread. And --\nOctober 17, 2001",

I mean, the -- we did\noccupation duty. Was interesting, I mean, we started schools in -- within our units\nand I taught chicken farming, I taught German, and we had all kinds of talent. We\nhad a guy with a Master\u2019s degree in English, you name it. The most liked class was\ncar repair because, you know, that was everybody\u2019s interest. We had all kinds of\ninterests there and that was very interesting. I ran the day room and I was giving\nnews broadcasts to the company from what I heard on the radio.

The reason for this was that, you know, all these people that came\nout of the camps and had came to the United States, chicken farming was a very\nattractive business. You didn\u2019t have to speak English with the chickens. And the\nonly way at the end that the feed dealers could compete with each other was well,\nthey extend more credit. And when that done, overextension of credit, with no help\nfrom the U.S. government, chicken business went down the drain. So my father\nthen went to dairy farming. We converted chicken coops into cow stables and I was\nable to do most -- I was able to do plumbing, you name it. You do everything\nOctober 17, 2001\nyourself. We had hurricanes.

And then, my sister-in-law lived here for over 20 years, and she\u2019s said the\nhome here in Washington is much better, so we had her transferred to the Hebrew\nhome.

I\u2019d gotten to a point where I was making many monthly deliveries, many\ndeliveries twice a month, and when I decided I was going to go only monthly\ndeliveries, then we decided to come here. Also religious reason. The synagogue in\nVineland where I went to on Shabbas closed down.
