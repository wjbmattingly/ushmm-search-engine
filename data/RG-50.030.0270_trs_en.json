        "Q: I just want you to begin by stating your name as it was during the war, your date of birth\nand the town you were born in?",
        "A: Yes. My name was Rozia, like Rose Luft, that was my maiden name, and I was born in\nZamuch (ph), the first of July 1918, and I don't know what else do you want to know? I\nhad one brother and two sisters. We had a pretty good life because my father was a\nbuilder, and we had people working for us. We had a maid in the house, and we lived\nvery comfortable. Before the war, in 1937, 1938, a friend of my brother's came from\nWarsaw and he saw me, and he said who 1s that cute little girl. So my brother said that is\nmy sister, and he took us out for a little dinner and he fell in love with me. So, I get\nmarried to him and be married and then the war broke out, so he was in the army, in the\nmilitary, and he was hurt and he was in a hospital. So my father sent a guy who worked\nfor my father, he sent to Warsaw and he brought him as a soldier wounded 1n the war.\nThey covered his face. It was a Gentile who brought him, because the Germans were\nalready in our town, so they covered his face not to look like a Jew, not to see that he is\nJewish. Even the Germans carried him from one train to another. So, that's the time he\ncame to our town and in 1940, I got married, in the war time.",
        "Q: You met and you planned to get married. He was wounded and then you got married\nafterwards?",
        "A: Yes, we were just like engaged. He sent me a ring from Warsaw, but I wasn't married to\nhim, and we got married in 1940. I wasn't crazy about marrying, but he was hurt and he\nsaid he was going to go to the Germans to be killed because if I'm not going to marry\nhim, he doesn't want to live. So, my mother said you're going to die anyway, all of us, so\nwhy don't you marry him. So, I did. I was pregnant in 1941, I got pregnant in 1941, I had\na baby and her name was Maugacia (ph), in English it's Margaret, and she died when she\nwas 7 1/2 months old because she had diarrhea and we didn't have any doctors, and we\ncouldn't go to doctors.",
        "Q: This was in Zamuch?",
        "A: I would think in Zamuch, yes. And I had two sisters in the same town. In Europe family\nlived in one town only. We didn't move around. We didn't leave the nest like. It's all the\nfamily, uncles and aunts and everybody lived in the same town. So, then my sister\nmarried, I was the middle one. I had an older sister married already. She was I don't know\nhow old. She was 24 when she died, but she married when she was 15 years old. By 16,\nshe had a baby. She had a boy, and that boy was during the war, and she looked-- my\nsister didn't look like a Jewish girl. She looked like a Gentile so the Gentile boys used to\nsay \"Saki, why do you need a Jew for. Throw the Jew away, like she doesn't belong to\nhim. But she was married, happily married to that guy, and they had that boy. Then the\nyounger sister, the youngest married a doctor, a young doctor. She was about that time\n20. She was born in 1921, and he was about seven years older, 27 at that time. He was a\npediatrician. They lived together, and then the Germans used to come in to give us all\nkinds of orders.",
        "Q: I'm sorry. I need you to stop a second. I think you were talking about your younger\nsister?",
        "A: Yes. She was married to that doctor. My youngest sisters --- there were three sisters and I\nwas the middle one. She married his name was , and they were very\nhappy together, and when the Germans started coming into our houses and taking\neverything away, you know like here the carpets we have on the floor, but the real what\ndo you call it, not Chinese, the carpets that come from the East, we had on the walls at\nthat time. They were hanging on the walls. So, they told them to take down the carpet\nfrom the wall, and he saw that they are very rough to us and they were pushing him and\nhitting him and they decided to take their lives. So, they went into their -- because they\nlived one apartment, one home near the other and they went into their room and they told\nthe maids to go into our house and stay with my mother until they're going to wake up.\nThey're going to sleep. So, she came in and she was sitting an hour or two and she said\nthey're still sleeping. So, my mother told me to go in and see what they're doing and I saw\nthem like that both of them. He was really dead and she was all right, but she didn't know\nthat he died. They took their lives. He gave her a shot. I don't know what the stuff was\nand himself and then he told her when she wakes up before him and he's going to be dead\nalready so she give herself another shot, and he put it away in a place in the oven. We\ndidn't have like heating, but big huge ovens so she said it's there because when the\ndoctors came and the whole town was by our house and when the doctors came, his\nfriends, and they asked where is the rest of it, and she told them while\nshe was still in coma like, but she told them and they took it out and they started giving\nher shots and she came to life and she lived about three months later, but she\ndidn't go to the funeral. And she was asking where's and my mother said that he\nis in the hospital, but it was really the funeral, and they buried him. I was sitting with my\nsister because my mother said you watch her, and I was very shocked because I saw that\nfirst. After that, three months later my sister went to the Germans and she said she wants\nto go to her husband, to die. So, they said, you're to pretty to go to death, and she said, I\nwant to go, and they took her away. That's the last we saw her.",
        "Q: She just presented herself to the Germans?",
        "A: Yes, she said she wanted to go with the transport. She wants to go to be killed because\nshe knew that they took you, it's the end of it.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question. Did your family have a lot of information about what was\nhappening so that your brother-in-law made this decision?",
        "A: Nobody, we knew that Hitler wrote and the Germans used to tell us it's\nnothing now. You're going to see what's waiting for you. So, we knew that something 1s\ngoing on, but they didn't tell us what they're going to. They used to say to everybody that\nthey're sending us to work, to the Russian front or to camps, but never they're going to\nkill us. So, my sister after three months she saw a boy who worked for my father and she\nsaid you tell my family that I'm going to see , to be with because\nshe found out that he is dead. She didn't want to live. She was in a very bad shape,\ndepression, and she finally she went there. So, my mother was heartbroken, but she didn't\n-- we didn't want to believe that they killed right away, so my mother was sending us,\nwhere did they send the transport and if she can send packages, and they said of course.\nSo, my mother was sending packages in the unknown and she had long been dead. Who\nknows, we don't know how she got killed and so that was less one. Then they were\nmoving us place to place, and they took us out from our homes and they put us in like not\nGhettos yet, in the beginning. They just made our community smaller and smaller and\nthey put us in a Ghetto.",
        "Q: Let me just go back a minute. When the war began in Poland, what are your first\nmemories? How soon did the Germans come into your town?",
        "A: Right in the beginning. They marched in and we didn't even know what happened. They\nmarched in about two weeks later, because at that time I forgot to tell you, my mother\nsent me for vacation. She said go to Warsaw to your aunt's. She wants you to have a\nvacation. So, I went to Warsaw, and the war, they started about 5:00 in the morning they\nwere calling in Warsaw, the war, the war, 5:00 in the morning, the papers. A war with\nGermany, a war with Germany, and we didn't really know what it means. I said I'm going\nhome. I want to be with my parents. My aunt, that was my father's sister, said no they're\ngoing to come to Warsaw. It's going to take a long time. You're better off to be in\nWarsaw than to go home, and I said, no I want to go home. So, she put me in a train that I\nwas with the German soldiers in a train in the beginning because Polish soldiers were\ngoing one way and German soldiers were going the other way. It was a horror. We didn't\neven know what's going on because I was never in a war and how did I know how a war\nis going to look. Finally I came home and my sister was not far, in the middle of the town\nliving, my older sister with her husband and that child, and she had a maid, her name was\nStasha and I went to the window and I started screaming Stasha, Stasha, early in the\nmorning about 5:00, 6:00 in the morning. So, she opened the big gate, because it was a\nbig building with gates, and so she opened the gate and she said quiet, everybody is\nasleep, but my sister heard and she said what are you doing here and I said, \"It's a war.\"\nIn our town they didn't know yet that it's a war, but in no time did soldiers start marching\nin. And it was a time that they were -- the Germans were grabbing older people. They\nwere shooting from the street young people, and cripples and anybody they can find, you\nknow. Like bearded Jews, you know with beards and with the Jewish you know, those\ncurls by the ears, and so they were telling him to wash the floors, to lick the floor with\nthe tongue or they said, I don't have anything to wash the floor with, so they said wash it\nwith your shirt. So, anyway, it was a terrible thing, but we never knew what was\nhappening. Then they told us we have to move together, together in a different place, but\nwe for a little while we stayed in the same place, and my sister had a maid and she was\npart of the gate, standing and the Germans used to come and they asked if there were any\nJews, and she couldn't speak German so she said, \"No, Jews,\" so they left. But we were\nin the window watching what's going on in the streets, and we saw all our neighbors a lot\nof them came out of the houses and they told them to make a big ditch and everybody\nwas working hard to make the ditch and they laid around, they told them to stay around\nthe ditches, to stand up, and that's what I saw. A very nice, I don't remember her name, a\nlady with a little girl, she was about five years old. She was holding the baby with her\nand they told them to stay with the Germans with the backs and they were shooting from\nthe back in the heads or whatever and they were falling into the graves, into the ditch.",
        "Q: Was this right in the town?",
        "A: Right in the beginning. They were falling and she was holding on to that little baby and\nshe was killed and the baby, and after a while in full blocks and lots and lots of people. I\ndon't remember how many it was at that time, but a lot of people fell into that grave, and\nthat little baby came out after about five or ten minutes, from under the mother because\nthey shoot her in the back of the head, so the little baby was she was holding on her so\nshe wasn't hurt, and she came out from under the mother's body and she was begging\nthem on the knees please don't kill me. I want to live, and they killed her just straight on\nher -- and she died. This we all saw and my nephew said you see what they're doing. At\nthat time he was about five years old. He said, \"I don't want to be killed like this.\" And\nso, 1t was over and we cried and we said this is going to be our end. At that time, I\nworked already for the Germans, the SS, the German engineers, and I used\nto be Ruzia, but they called me Pauline. They gave me the name Pauline that was easier\nfor them. Sometimes they called me Rozamunda or you know all kinds of names, but I\nworked for the Germans and my mother used to take my sister's children and we used to\nwork; all of us, and my child and she used to babysit my mother, for the children. My\nmother at that time was about 45 or something like this. I don't know what year my\nmother was born, and she was watching the children and we were working. One time I\nsaid I want to go home because they're killing people there, and the SS men said no\nyou're not going because you'll only get killed. You stay here. He was a very nice SS man\nand he wasn't in the military. He was a civilian SS, and my mother gave me the baby and\nsaid here you run away with the baby. He said take the baby, and I'm going to bring you\nmilk for the baby, and he helped me and he was standing over me and he was crying and\nhe said, \"I have children, too, and I don't know what's going to happen when the war ends\nwith my children.\" They were afraid for themselves, too. So, this passed by and they\nstarted moving us again, to a Ghetto.",
        "Q: I'm just a little confused. When the Germans came in, you were sent to work?",
        "A: Yes. We had to have camp cards, like a passport, that we are working and we are\nregistered to work, because if you're not registered, you didn't get bread. So, you had to\nbe registered, and we used to go all out to work.",
        "Q: Was this in the town?",
        "A: That was all in our town.",
        "Q: Were most of the young women going and doing this kind of work?",
        "A: All of them, old and young.",
        "Q: What was the actual work?",
        "A: Anything. One worked and cleaned houses. I worked as a helper there, you know. They\nasked me if I know how to make manicure and I said, I don't know. He said try, and I\nmade for the SS men's manicure and I was afraid that if I'm going to hurt them, they're\ngoing to kill me, but they were nice SS people, really. They weren't the military. They\nwere private. They were like engineers, but they belonged to the party, but they didn't\nknow the cruelty yet.",
        "Q: But your work was really very intimate. It wasn't working in a factory. It was this one to\none contact?",
        "A: In the beginning in our town, they used to make us work in getting used that all of us\nhave to work if you want food. They didn't give us much. The Russians were very small.\nThey gave us bread and the bread tastes like raw, because they didn't bake them like they\nwere supposed to be, but we had something. Then, we worked there until about -- they\nmade , that was in 1941. My daughter died by the time, and they came and\nthey took my daughter in something away. I didn't even know where she was buried or\nwhat they did with her. Nobody knew what happened to the dead people. They used to\ncome every morning and collect the dead from the Ghetto and take them. We didn't know\nwhere they took them.",
        "Q: Okay, now you're mentioning a Ghetto. When was the Ghetto formed?",
        "A: The Ghetto was formed from almost the beginning. It wasn't like a real in Warsaw Ghetto\nbecause that was the beginnings. They were just putting us together to have us in one\nplace you see, not in the whole town, to be everywhere that they couldn't find us. So, they\nkept us. It was togetherness like. They kept us in one place and they knew where to look\nfor us.",
        "Q: Were the conditions bad in the Ghetto?",
        "A: Very. You know, like you have a house and they put you in two rooms, a whole family.\nMy mother with my father and all three of my sisters, the beginning, and my brother. We\nwere in one room later. So, it was terrible, but you're still -- we were allowed to take our\nclothes, not much, but a little, but not the furniture. Nothing like this. It's Just personal\nthings they let us take and you know, little by little they take away our freedom and\neverything. We couldn't get out. The Ghetto was from this place to this place. We\ncouldn't go to the other side of the Ghetto by ourselves. We had to have a German or a\ndressed in a German uniform, but they were . They spoke\nPolish but they were from some place in the border of Germany and Poland, so they\nspoke both languages. They had to bring us to work. We couldn't go by ourselves. We\nmet one nice and his name was Philip. I don't know the last name. He used\nto help us. He used to put when they say he used to come and say they are going to make\na raid today, you know, like they're going to kill a lot of people. They are going to raid\nthe Ghetto, and so he said let me take you all go into the ditches, you know where the\npotatoes are high. So, he put us in the ditches and he said I'm going to watch and I'm\ngoing to see where they are and I'm going to tell you when to come out. So, the Germans\nwere very smart and very clever, and they used to go around and looking for people like\nthis. They knew that everybody is trying to stay alive. So, he watched them, and he used\nto show us quietly don't get up. Just stay there, and he was like a means\nhe was the watcher, a watch guard for them, but he helped us. He helped us a lot in the\nbeginning. They had a little more freedom to do that, the , and the\nGermans. They weren't so bad. But, they were bad enough because we weren't used to a\nlife like this. But, you know from the worst they were the better ones. So, they moved us\nagain, and I moved out from my mother to a different place. They gave me a little room\nin a building, in the same building my aunt lived downstairs with my cousin and her\nhusband and child and another guy, another family lived next door and they made an\n. Do you know what that is? They told us to go to the market place and they\nwere cleaning up the place, so we all went to the marketplace, but the contribution of\npeople, so many they can put into the trains, that they had enough. They did the amount\nof people, it was over, so they sent some people back. Then when we came back home, it\nwas the middle of the night and we couldn't go because they were shooting everybody on\nthe streets, whoever they saw. So, we went into a building that we didn't even know who\nlived there, and we heard somebody crying and it was an old lady, maybe 100 years old\nin the bed crying that she doesn't have food, and that she doesn't know where her family\nis and we told her to be quiet because they are going to shoot us all. I was with my little\nbaby at that time, yet still, and I was breast feeding her and I didn't have anything in my\nbreast how to feed her. We kept the baby quiet and my cousin was with me with her boy.\nHe was six years old and my cousin's husband. Then the middle of the night, it was too\ndark, maybe 4 o'clock in the morning, we were going back quietly and we saw blood all\nover the streets. It was like a war field with people who I knew were on the streets all\nover, and we saw a German on a horse. He was Gestapo or SS officer, a very high rank\nofficer and he said \"What happened?\" It was quiet already, just, you know, once in a\nwhile we heard a shot someplace. So, he asked us what happened here and we said, \"We\ndon't know. They killed us all.\" And he said, \"Tell your people -- I never knew who he\nwas -- \"Tell your people that I am ashamed of our race.\" And he was a high rank German.\nHe told us tell the people so we went home and we said so what can\nyou say. We went back home so we had to lock the gate and my cousin went to the next\ndoor neighbor for the gate -- locking the gate, it was a big like a piece of iron, you know\nto put an iron on the gate. In the meantime, he went in there and he called us all and he\nsaid, \"Come in, come in, you're going to see something.\" Fourteen people were shot\nthrough the head. All of them. My two aunts. One aunt was standing. She was looking\nsomething in the drawer and she opened the drawer and she was with her head looking\ninto the drawer and she was shot, I suppose in the back of her head and the drawer was\nfull of her blood. One of my aunts was sitting on the floor in the corner, with her tongue\nout, shot to death. That was my cousin's mother. My mother's brother's wife, and so it\nwas a full house of dead people, fourteen people. All of a sudden I hear somebody calling\nmy name, and one girl was moaning because they shot her in an eye. They said she's too\npretty to shoot her so they just shoot her eye out, which she died a while later, but the\nwoman who came out from under the bed, they were all standing or sitting or just so the\nwoman was my neighbor and she came out from under the bed dripping in blood, and she\nsaid, I run the first under the bed and they couldn't see me. They just shot the next person\nwho was after me. I said, \"Come out\" my cousin said, \"Come out. You're going to be\nwith us.\" She said, \"No, I'm afraid they're going to kill me.\" And she went back under the\nbed. Finally, you know, we persuade her to come out and we said go and wash yourself.\nLook how you look. She was soaking in blood. So, that was then my mother knew what\nwas someplace else and she sent the maid and she said to Anera (ph), she said go and see\nwhat's with my daughter. She came to the window and it was I had a candle on because\nwe were afraid to put the lights on and so she said she came back to my mother and she\nsaid I think in Ruzia's apartment there's a little candle so she must be there. So, my father\ncame with a blanket and he came for me and when he saw me he fainted because I looked\nlike -- he couldn't recognize me because we went through hell all night. It was not a\nnight, it was a hell. What we saw, and that's always in my mind. I never told my children\nanything about those things, and my father took me home to my mother. He took me\nhome and my mother said you're not going anyplace. You're staying with us until they\nmove us further. That was the place for you to stay with us. So, then I said no I'm going\nto go home tomorrow. Soon after my baby died, because I didn't give her milk. I gave her\nwater. I didn't have anything to give her, and so we --",
        "Q: Was there constantly terror in the streets?",
        "A: Constantly, constantly, night and day you hear shooting and screaming and running. It\nwas not a day or not a minute without fear, without that horror, not fear, horror. It was\nunbelievable.",
        "Q: You saw this when you went to work?",
        "A: All the time, all the time. Then you know, after that you're still a few months in that\nGhetto, and I used to go to work, and I had nice friends, and I had a teacher who and his\nname was Mr. Khun (ph), and you come to me, and I'm going to feed you and I'm going\nto give you something to wear, you know things you need. I want to help. So, I used to go\nthere and they used to prepare for me a package of food of something to bring home, and\nbut you know the Polish people most of them it was a lot of nice people who saved a lot\nof people who are trying to save, and they saved a lot. But it was many for a pound of\nsugar, they sold your soul. So, they worked for the Germans, and one time I said to that\nPhilip, he used to come and he used to take me to visit my friends. Like I used to have a\nfriend, my brother's friend, and she used to tell me how about coming to dinner and I said\n-- she's a , you have full Germans, and she said, I'm going to tell her you're\nmy sister and nobody is going to know so that was the truth. But in the meantime, we\nwere making Gentile papers for ourselves to live through the war if we decided to run\naway before it's too late. So, we were working on the papers. It cost a lot of money too\nmake Gentile papers.",
        "Q: Who was helping you with us?",
        "A: It was a lot of Polish people who did those things, who put the German stamps, like it\nlooked real and everything. They gave me a name, Bernice Slabovuchko, that I should\nlive on this name, and my brother and my father put money down for camp cards like\npassports like Gentiles and they put money down and they waited. They said it's going to\ntake and they gave them pictures and everythings, it's going to take a little while and\nyou're going to get your papers. So, and I had papers from a church and I had those\npapers but you're going to work every day and all of a sudden one morning they came in\nand they said it's everything , they didn't let us go to work and it's\n, you know they clean out and we all have to go out of town.",
        "Q: When was this?",
        "A: That was by the end of 1941.",
        "Q: You were still living in ?",
        "A: Yes, but then I came back and it was '41, because they took the whole town together and\nwe marched, children, old and young, whatever was left, we marched to a little town\n. was never there in my life and we marched 21 kilometers with my\nsister at that time had a boy and he was eight years already and the little girl was two\nyears old. She had a girl. So, when they told us to march, so we had a woman who\nwashed our clothes for us and so she said send Sanrush (ph) to me and he said \"No\nMommy, I will not go. I'm going with you.\" And he said, \"I don't want to be shot like all\nthe children on the street, because when you're not going to be here she's going to throw\nme out and we're going to wind up dead on the street.\" So, he went and he walked 21\nkilometers, an eight year old boy.",
        "Q: Was your family with you?",
        "A: Yes, my mother, my father, my brother, my one sister, because one was already gone. So,\nwe walked and I helped carry my sister's little girl. And he was walking, my nephew,\nalone by himself and he was so proud you see I am walking by myself, all by myself.\nAnd he walked the whole 21 kilometers. They brought us to a little town. It was a dirty\nlittle town with -- it wasn't even a town. It was a village like and there was no place to go\nand no place to live. We found a room someplace. We went in with a family. I don't\nknow who that was. In the same day, a German, an SS man, but I worked for him, he was\n-- | worked in an logger, that means a camp and we were\ngoing there for there for the day and working and coming home and you know. So, I\nworked all the time for him. So, he came and he used to call me Pauline, not Rose. So, he\ncame to the town and he was standing on a truck and he said where is Pauline. He called\nfor me, and my brother came into the house and he said I think Walter -- his name Walter\nRobert, my brother says, I think he's looking for you because he called your name. And I\nsaid, \"I don't want to go.\" And I want to go all together. We're going to go all together all\nof us. So, my mother said, \"No, you go,\" and she put on I don't know whose coat, my\nbrother's coat on me. It was cold already. I don't know what month it was, it was like fall.\nShe put that coat and she said you're going to keep warm. You go back. Maybe by you're\ngoing back to work for Robert, you can save us, and we're going to start hiding ourselves\nin here by the time maybe you can help us. So, I didn't want to go and I cried. I said,\n\"Mother, I don't want to go.\" He said, \"you go.\" My brother took me there and he said,\n\"You go with Robert,\" and he was standing on the truck and the other side of the cane, he\nalways had a cane to hit somebody, so he pulled my neck to him and he said, \"You come\nhere,\" and he took me on the truck and he said, \"You're going back, because they needed\n75 people back to our town to clean up the town. My brother and my father and my\nmother and my sister and the children stayed in that little town. So, my brother started\ngoing for those cards, for the passport. So, the Pollack who made that passport saw that\nthe Germans are you know the bosses and he said -- and my brother paid him 3,000\nslotas, that means like $3,000, and that time it was a lot of money. So, he said, you better\nget out of here. I don't have papers for you and I'm not going to make them. I have the\nmoney and you go out, and if you're not going to get out, I'm going to call the Gestapo.\nSo, my brother ran away. He ran away and he came down, and by that time, my mother\nand sister and children were hidden in a hole underground. They found them there, I don't\nknow, because I wasn't there anymore, because they took me back to my town. They\nfound them there and where their remains are if they were cremated or they were shot, if\nthey were shot whatever happened to them, I don't know, but my father in the morning he\nused to like to go to the forest. So, my father went to the forest, and he said I'm going to\nbe back. So, he was walking around in the forest and after a while he came out. He didn't\nknow that that they are killing all the people. They are taking them away\nand screaming and everything. He came out and a few Germans on horses they were\n, because they spoke to him in Polish and they said to him, you SOB,\nrun back because they are going to kill you with all the Jews around, and my father was a\nJew, and my father had no choice. He ran back to the forest, and walking in the forest he\nwas walking and crying and he met somebody was in the forest, a girl. She came to my\nfather and said she's a Gentile and she said please don't kill me please don't kill me, so\nmy father said don't worry, what's your name and she said Tricia. I'm from Warsaw. He\nsaid I'm not going to kill you. I am not to kill you, I'm in the same boat like you are, and\nI'm going to save you as much as I can. He did. He said I'm a Jew like you are and we're\ngoing to hide out together, and when he came out nobody was around anymore. All of\nthem are gone and I by the time I was in in our town in the camp, working\nand my father was one of the workers, a Pollack, came to the gate and said he wants to\nsee me and I run to gate and I said what happened. He said, your mother was killed. Your\nsister was killed and the children were killed -- no, he said your father is alive and your\nbrother is alive and I said where are the others why don't you tell me. They are all killed,\nI didn't want to tell you this. I said I am going there anyway to bring my brother and my\nfather. I went in a wagon hidden with straw and I hid in the straw and they brought me\nbecause they had to go and see I don't know what the Germans were looking there for and\nI said I'm going, and they hid me there. I went and my father and brother and my brother-\nin-law were there. So, I brought them back. I don't know how, but I brought my brother-\nin-law and father back and my brother said I am going to wait maybe still he is going to\ngive me the papers and he waited. A few days later my brother came to the gate and he\nfainted by the gate where I worked but nobody could take anybody in. It was not allowed.\nSo, I don't know how but I took him in quietly and I hid him there. So, her mother,\nBessie's mother was someplace around too, and by the gates and she couldn't go in --",
        "Q: This was a friend of yours?",
        "A: Yes, her mother, and I took them in there because that SS guy, I went to him and I said\n\"Please take him in, please.\" And he said, \"I can't, I can't. I'm not allowed. They're going\nto kill me too.\" I said, please and he said okay, hide them in the toilet and I'm going to do\nsomething about it. And he did. So, I got my father and my brother already there and her\nmother and another girl from our town. She was sitting hidden in the toilet for two weeks,\nand whoever came in I said, please don't throw her out. Let her sit there. She was so\nscared and she was shaking and I took him and then my brother went to work to clean up\nthe clothes by the clothes they worked. By the cemetery they made a big barracks and\nthey put all the clothes from all the town and they had to sort out the good ones and the\nbad ones and put them in bundles and they were sending them to Germany.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: So my brother came and he didn't have the papers. They told him that they are going to\nannounce him to the Gestapo. So, he walked out. He came to our town and he was\nworking in the city. He went to work and he met a friend of his. I think he was in the\nArmy with him together, my brother.",
        "Q: In the Polish Army?",
        "A: In the Polish Army. So, because my brother was the oldest brother in the family and so he\nwas born in 1910 so he was not a child and so he was after the Army and he met the guy\nand he said to my brother why are you miserable what's wrong what happened to you.\nAre you hurt? Are you hungry? And he said no, I can't get my gentile papers because\nthey took away my money and my father's paper is Kochonoski, and I want -- no and my\nfather doesn't have the papers really, and I want him to be my father and I am his son and\nwe Polish officers are going to run away. And he says, okay, take my camp card. He took\noff his picture and he gave it to my brother. He said, \"I am going to report that in three\nmonths that I lost it. By that time you make yourself other papers.\" So, he gave him the\npapers that he is Kochonoski, and he made my father his father and they left. They went\nto Lemberg, to as Gentiles. I took my father the night before when they had\nto leave. I took him to his friend, and I said Mr. Bishak to my brother's friend, keep my\nfather here one night because they are leaving tomorrow. And he said, \"I can't, because\nmy wife is anti-semitic and she's going to give him out. I can't do that. I would love to,\nand I'm afraid of her.\" But I was wearing a Moses on my neck and he said, \"Child, give\nme that Moses and I'm going to keep it for you, if you're going to live, I'm going to give it\nback.\" I still have it. \"I'm going to give it back to you, and I'm going to put a new cross\nand Maria,\" and I said fine. So, I gave him that Moses and I had to take my father away\nfrom there. I kept him. I took him to another place, to a lady, Nanina (ph) and I said you\nkeep him and she said I will and she kept him overnight. In the morning they left to\nLemberg, and they said you don't come until we're going to send for you, no matter what.\nYou shouldn't move from here and I said fine. So, they left. I was already in the camp in\nit was , no Jews. We were just cleaning up the place, we were\ncleaning up.",
        "Q: How many were there?",
        "A: Oh, it started with about 75 and it wind up over 1,000.",
        "Q: Women and men?",
        "A: Men and women, yes. So, Bessie's mother was there with her brother and a cousin and we\ngot very friendly there. She was a very lovely girl, always smiling and it was a pleasure\nto be with her in her company and I really fell in love with her like a friend. I said I'm\ngoing to help you with this and whatever because I worked in the kitchen there in the\ncamp. I was peeling potatoes, a potato peeler. Then I got sick of Typhus there and that\nRobert who took me back he told a soldier that he should bring me every day water there\nand keep me -- I was in a little coop like, and you have to keep give her water and make a\nlittle fire to keep her warm and she is going to be okay. We didn't have any medication\nnothing and so I got I was crazy. It went into your head. After I came out of the sickness I\nwas nuts. I didn't want to do anything in the kitchen. I didn't want to peel potatoes and he\ncame in, that Robert, with and he said if you're not going to do what I -- not because he\nwas mad at me, but he wanted me to wake up. He said, I'm going to beat the hell out of\nyou but you have to work if you want to live. And I was so scared of him that I started\ndoing it. So, then I got better with nothing. We didn't have even an aspirin, nothing, just\nwater. When you're young, you get through a lot. So, I make the story short and the\ncamp and one night it was late in '41 I had a dream there that my mother I\nwant to run away. No, I had a dream that my mother is by the door and I said, \"Mother,\nwhat kind of mother are you. I want to run away and you're keeping me here.\" And she\nsaid, \"Over my dead body.\" I'm never going to forget that dream. It was real, I saw her\nthere on the floor and she said you're not going to run away because over my dead body\nbecause they're going to shoot you outside and all of sudden we hear screams outside\n\"Arouse, Arouse\" that was about 4 o'clock in the morning. Arouse, so the Germans the\nGestapo came, we worked for the SS but then the Gestapo came at 4 o'clock in the\nmorning, and the Gestapo were over the SS, so they said all out and they start you know\nputting us in lines and the outside people start running and they were all shot outside. My\nmother told not to run, and they took us away. But, before that, there was a guy an\nengineer with a wife, I told you they even brought me from Germany presents, a raincoat\nand a rain hat, and a parasol and they said they are going to adopt me and send me to\nGermany, but it was so sudden that the SS didn't know what the Gestapo was cooking for\nus and they came to the gate and they were standing in the gate and he saw me going out\nof the gate and he started crying and he said just like this. He showed that he couldn't do\nanything, and they took us on big trucks and we didn't know where we were going. They\nshoot a lot of people in the camp there before we left because they were starting to run\nand they shoot a lady that I knew by my door and her brain was by the door. Nothing you\ncan do about it. You saw the brain, you saw that person, pieces, but we had to march out.\nThey put us in the trucks and they filled up, I don't know how many people in one truck,\nthe rest they took to the Rotunda, you know, it was a Rotunda and they shot them all.\nWhat they felt they're not good to work anymore, so they shot and us they took and they\nwere going, driving us and we didn't know where. Are we going to , going to\nto be killed or --.",
        "Q: Had you heard about these places already?",
        "A: We didn't hear about them, we knew in the camp, we knew it exists. We knew it goes\naround or they said we went by already , that means they are not taking us there.\nThey are taking us someplace else. We thought to jump, the trucks, but we really -- one\nsaid let's jump, let's go, and one said no don't, they're going to kill us. So, we were in\nGod's hands.",
        "Q: Did you think you were going to work somewhere else?",
        "A: No, we knew they are going to kill us. We are going to death, because we weren't\ndressed. I was in my nightgown. We weren't even dressed, with a coat on top. We didn't\nknow really where we were going, but when we passed those death places we knew that\nthey are -- it's death camps, just ovens, not even camps, just straight to the crematory. So,\nwe went by it and we said, no we're going someplace else. So, you know, we lived with\nhope that maybe we're going to live. They brought us into Maidanek. After a long, long\ndrive they brought us into Maidanek, and they told us to undress and to take a shower.\nThey put us into cold showers and they took away everything. They gave us old junk to\nput on us, and they took away all our jewelry but you see before we left we were smarter,\nwe put all the jewelry in the toilet. We had packs. We were sitting on it so we put\neverything there. We said let's not give anything to them. But I forgot that I had long hair\nand I forgot that I had my earrings with my monogram in my ears and my hair covered it,\nso it went through, but everything went and we were naked. The men, they took separate\nand they undressed the men naked and they left them only the strap in the hands and they\ntold them to hold the strap in their hands and they let German Shepherds after them. And\nyou know, when you have something in the hand and the German Shepherds went wild\nand they were biting out pieces of meat of the people. This was the beginning of\nMaidanek.",
        "Q: You were watching all of this?",
        "A: We were watching. The women were separate, but the men were running. We were\nnaked, we didn't have straps. Men had pants with straps so they had the straps and the\nGerman Shepherds tore them apart. So, we went into the camp. They took us in camp.",
        "Q: When you arrived did you see prisoners already there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What did they look like?",
        "A: They looked like prisoners with an L on the back, the striped clothes with on the\nback. that means concentration camp. That was a concentration camp,\nMaidanek.",
        "Q: Do you remember what month you went there?",
        "A: I don't remember months, just like I remember barely in the beginning I did remember.",
        "Q: This was the beginning of '42?",
        "A: No, yes, we went in '42 to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: So, this was before that?",
        "A: Before that, we were about eight months in that camp.",
        "Q: In Maidanek?",
        "A: In Maidanek, about six months maybe. I don't remember exactly but so we went into that\nMaidanek and they took us in. They dressed us in clothes and they took us in. We\nmarched in. The women separate. The men separate. I don't know how many blocks it\nwas, about five all together I guess and we had about one block that were men and the\nmen had the rest. They had kitchens in the men's place but not by us. By us we only did\nwork and when we came from work they used to put us -- we worked like not\nmelioration, we put grass in the -- the men were bringing us the water. They were the\nhorses and the wagons, and they pulled the wagons with water and they gave us buckets\nof water and we watered the grass there. That was the job in Maidanek.",
        "Q: How long did you water the grass?",
        "A: All the time. That was my job.",
        "Q: You were beautifying the camp?",
        "A: Yes, beautifying the camp, and that's what you know my husband was there too. He paid\nhis bread -- he worked someplace else, that he wants once to go to the women's camp to\nsee me and I took off my earrings and I put them in a piece of my undershirt and I had\nthem in my shoes because the shoes didn't take away. I just cut off my heals and I was\nwalking like backwards but I had them in my shoes and when he came I took him out and\nwhen he was giving me the water I just gave him those earrings and he didn't know what\nit is and I gave him my bread because men need more bread.",
        "Q: How did you know your husband was there? You hadn't seen him in a while?",
        "A: No, but I was working there and I saw him coming because he told somebody that he's\ngoing to be that day through -- like a messenger like you know one word comes to\nanother that he's going to try to see me that day. So, he didn't nobody knew.",
        "Q: That's sort of miraculous that you found each other again there?",
        "A: Yes, but only for a day, only for a minute really. I gave him those earrings and he put\nthem away because and then we worked and we went in the evenings we went to the\ncamp. Saturday and Sunday they used to put us -- the camp was with high electric wires\nand in between was so much place, very little about maybe how many inches I don't\nknow ten, twenty inches, I don't know, between the wires. They used to let us in between\nthe wires and sit there and we couldn't move because if you move one way it's electric\nand you move the other so you were sitting there one by one around the wires. This was\nour past time or we used to they used to give us a job to bring stones from one corner to\nanother, the same stone. We bring it to one corner of the camp and bring it back, go back\nand forth like you see ants working, you know. They're going back and forth.",
        "Q: Why were you doing that?",
        "A: For nothing, just because they wanted to occupy us. We shouldn't be free. We shouldn't\nhave free time. I don't know in Polish we say , that means, sesame\nwork. It didn't take you any place and we didn't do anything, so we used to work that time\nlike this and then we went out when the food was ready. So, from the men's camp they\ncame in with the food on wagons to bring us the food. The men cooked for the whole\ncamp, so one my neighbor saw me there standing and waiting for the food and he looked\nat me and he said \"Are you hungry?\" And I said, I didn't say anything. I was afraid to say\nsomething but I just nod my head yes. So, he threw down on the floor a few green peas\nwithout the greens peas, just the shell and I picked it up. So, somebody saw it and they\ntook me into the camp and they gave me 25 on my back. They took off my clothes and I\nwas in the whole block, the whole block is like the barrack was watching. They were\nbeating me. I felt maybe three times and the rest I didn't feel anymore. So, they gave me\n25 on my bare back. I was -- there was nothing you could do about it. I had open wounds\nand the girls, her mother tried to wrote they tried to soothe me and said\n\"Don't worry.\" They dressed me slowly and they took me out to work and my girls about\nI don't know a few of them ten girls, fifteen girls they were all around me and they were\nreally taking care of me to bring me back, because they thought I was going to die. So,\nthat was in Maidanek. After that 1t was so bad that whoever wanted to run away they -- a\ngirl wanted to run away, we didn't who she was, and they found her. They brought her\nback and they put us all in an , a counting and they put us all in the middle of\nthe camp, and they put her to be hanged. They hanged her and they let her hang on a\nwindy day, very windy, and she was dinging three days and three nights and we were\nafraid to look at it. You know, to show us that that's what's going to happen to us if\nsomeone even tried to run away. So nobody tried.",
        "Q: No other examples of --",
        "A: Nobody was. We couldn't. At that time we didn't have our numbers because the numbers\nthey gave us in Birkenau, in Auschwitz they gave numbers, but in any other camps we\ndidn't have any numbers. Nobody did. So, we just they told us thousand times a day that\nif you're going to run away, that's what's waiting for us. So, we were afraid. We were\nthere for about I don't know and we whisper went around that they were going to transfer\nus someplace else. We don't know where.",
        "Q: I want to talk a little more about Maidanek before you move on. One thing I read was that\nin the beginning, maybe you were there a little later, they didn't even have water. It was\nhard for people --?",
        "A: It was nothing. No where was water. They let us in. They gave us ten minutes, not only in\nMaidanek, in Auschwitz too, they give us five minutes each to go into to wash, and it was\ncold water.",
        "Q: Every day?",
        "A: No, sometimes when you went in. We didn't have toilets we went out not even an\nouthouse, under there someplace where ever we found a place. We didn't have anything.\nWe didn't have a paper so you know what I used to do to take pieces of my underwear\nand I used that until my underwear was to here but because we had to give them back one\nto get a new one. So, this was to left to give it back to get a new one. So, you see we\ndidn't have any paper. We didn't have any water. We had very little food. We had just\nbarely to live through the day, a little soup which was terrible from cabbage, rotten\ncabbage and collarabi. It was the worst thing you ever ate in your life, but when you're\nhungry you try to swallow it.",
        "Q: What did you eat it in?",
        "A: We ate it.",
        "Q: Did you have your own dish?",
        "A: Yes, they gave us dishes and we used to put the dish in here, under and it looked like this\nand this was our dish to wash ourselves. I washed my face in it. Sometimes, I don't know\nhow to say, I went number one in that thing and we ate soup in it and the soup it wasn't\ntoo much. It was just like a cup of soup.",
        "Q: Were you able to rinse it?",
        "A: With the coffee they gave us in the morning, not coffee. They were leaves, like burned\nleaves, they made brown water, so with this we washed the faces and we washed the dish\nand that's all.",
        "Q: How crowded was your block? Were you sharing a bed?",
        "A: Oh, yes. It was like ten in a bed, eight in a bed, one foot. You know, we were sleeping\nlike sixes, six and nine just like this and --.",
        "Q: Did you have a straw mattress?",
        "A: It was supposed to be a straw mattress but it was almost nothing in it. And it was\nbedbugs, a lot of bedbugs, a lot of lice, very much a lot of lice and a lot of fleas.\nEverything you can think about was there and it was on us. They ate us alive. so instead\nof drinking that coffee I washed my body with it.",
        "Q: Did you ever get sick and go to the hospital?",
        "A: No, if you went to the hospital, you never come out. This is it. Even if you were sick --\nwe had girls who had typhus and you were dragging them to work, not to go there\nbecause and then I'm going to come back to that Tricia. She died, who my father found\nand brought into the camp and then she'd wind up with me and all of the\ncamps too. So, all of a sudden we heard a rumor that they are going to whoever wants to\ngo for a transport can go for a transport.",
        "Q: I still want to ask a question. One thing I think may be unusual, in Maidanek there were a\nnumber of children weren't there?",
        "A: Yes, they were all killed or they, when they brought them to Auschwitz they separated\nthem and they went straight to the oven to the gas chambers.",
        "Q: What were they doing in Maidanek, were they working?",
        "A: The kids, nothing. They were playing around. Kids, you know, but they weren't doing\nanything. It wasn't kids, little tiny like tiny kids, it was like nine years old. They told one\nlittle nine year old in Maidanek to hang his father and he did. So, this is what -- they\nbrainwashed you. They made you they didn't call us person like you know 1n German 1s\nmensch, they called the dog mensch and us they hound, hound is a dog. So, they didn't\ncall us by name. They called us by hound and their dogs were mensch, people, and we\nwere the dogs.",
        "Q: The people's behavior did they adapt?",
        "A: No, people's behavior was like animals. When they saw food, they grabbed food from\nsomebody else. They would kill you for a little soup. It was unbelievable how people in\nour how you say it in those circumstances how they behaved. Some, when you had a little\nbit of education, intelligence you knew better you behaved a little different, but some\nwere very, very poor and common people brought in. They didn't know better. They were\nfighting for their life. They would kill for a little just soup.",
        "Q: How did you respond to that?",
        "A: I was never aggressive. I am not a big eater, and thanks to that I was never hungry, really,\nreally hungry to go for somebody's food or to whatever I got sometimes I was trading my\nlittle soup for a little piece of bread with a little margarine and the margarine was like a\nlittle tiny square and very thin, but it gave me a little energy. So, this I was never\nageressive, never. I had later on in Birkenau friends who were aggressive and they were\ngoing to the garbage and they brought food and they wake me up and they said you have\na soup from peels from the potatoes or whatever it was in the garbage but that was later\non. In the beginning, I was quiet and satisfied with whatever I had.",
        "Q: Were you surprised by the other people?",
        "A: Very, they used to put the heads in those big pots of what they brought the food and\nliquid the tanks there and I said what kind of animals are they because they made us\nanimals. They made from people unbelievably animals. I think not everybody had a mind\nto control themselves and they broke you down and you couldn't control.",
        "Q: One more question about Maidanek, the guards, the kopos, your block elders, who were\nthey, what were they like?",
        "A: They were all mean. You were afraid to talk. You were afraid to say anything. You\nweren't afraid of them like of the dogs because they didn't do anything to you, they just\nlet the dogs go.",
        "Q: Were they Germans or were they Poles?",
        "A: Germans, Germans and many, many Poles too. They made themselves that they were\n, you know. That means that they have mixed blood, half of this and half\nof that. The worst people of all were the Lithuanians. They were in black uniforms and\nthe Lithuanians were worse than any Pole or any German. They were the most daring\npeople alive.",
        "Q: This was in Maidanek?",
        "A: That was before Maidanek in everywhere they were -- we were afraid of the black\nuniforms, because we knew that they are Lithuanians. They were they wanted to be better\nfor the Fuhrer than the Germans. They were terrible people. They hated the Jews a lot.\nThey hated our guts. We were afraid more of them than anybody else.",
        "Q: You were starting to say that there were either selections or you heard there were going\nto be transports.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: At the same time, were there a lot of new transports coming in?",
        "A: I didn't know about it, must be, but maybe when we left they brought new people. They\nhad to replace, not very roomy places, but at least to squeeze us in. I used to like to sleep\nby the end of that piece of wood, the bed like because nobody breathed on me. I'd rather\nbreathe on the wall so I rather had the box from the wall come out on me than the\nbreathing from other people, so they didn't need much place, but I didn't see any\ntransports. Then when we heard that it's going to be transports so my husband sent me\nword from the men's camp that he is going to register for a transport, I should do it too.",
        "Q: It was your choice?",
        "A: Yes, you could register or you could be killed. They gave you the choice to leave the\nplace and go to a worse one, but we didn't know if it was worse. We thought it was better.",
        "Q: I'm sorry to do this, but I want to back track just once more. Were there any gassings or\nburnings done at Maidanek?",
        "A: No. They used to be they're gassing I think at the beginning where they just took you to\nwork and they gas you there because we knew and we saw those gassing chambers but\nnot people. They didn't gas them anymore. So, then we had the right to go for a transport.\nThey knew that we not going to a resort place. They knew they were sending us to worse\nplaces and this is the way the Germans did their work and that to be to make you very\nlittle in not thinking. You know but they gave you like a little authority. You can register,\nbut they did what they wanted to do. So, we registered and they took us away and we\ndidn't know where, and so did my husband. They took him to Mauthausen and they took\nme to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Do you remember approximately when this 1s?",
        "A: Oh, I don't know, 1942, someplace.",
        "Q: Winter?",
        "A: It was like fall, it was fall. I know it was cold but so they took us out. They marched us\nout of Maidanek and they took us to -- we marched to the train and that wasn't people\ntrain they were animal trains or coal trains or whatever and they put me in a coal train. I\nwas black when I came out of there. I looked like a black person. In Polish negroes they\ndidn't say they said black people are coming. The black people are coming because we\ncame out we were black from the coal and this is later. I just go back, they put us 1n those\nand they gave us a little bread and they didn't give us water, they gave us a little\nmargarine and a little cheese. We were in the train about four days without water. We\nbegged them for water. They didn't want to give us. Many of us died. They were jumping\nover the dead people to the window to scream out for water, please water. Nothing was\nmore important than water. They didn't give us any. So, we used to make number one and\nwe used to drink it. What could you do. Maybe people don't -- I don't know how many\nyou interview don't tell those things, but this is the truth. So, we had some water, it was\nsalty, but water. So, we came into they took us four days for a ride. I don't know if I was\nlucky or not because after the war I even say, why am I alive and the rest perished. I don't\nknow if I'm lucky. I should go with all of them, but maybe it was my luck. I don't know.\nThank God I have three children and I would have them if I wouldn't be here. So, they\ntook us there and they brought us in the middle of the night. It was very dark, very dark\nwhen they brought us in. They stopped the train and they took us out and that was already\nin Berchanau.",
        "Q: How many went with you?",
        "A: A lot.",
        "Q: A thousand?",
        "A: More than that, more than that. Maybe two or three thousand people. Germans were in a\nline lined up, the Gestapo with dogs by the train and like they saw me they said go this\nway. They saw an old person this way. This way, this way, children left and right. Left\nand right, we didn't know. Who knew what means left and we went where they told us to\ngo.",
        "Q: This was a different system than at Maidanek?",
        "A: It was different. In Maidanek they took everybody who came from everyplace. This was\nthe segregation because in Auschwitz or in Birkenau they want you to still be healthy and\nable to work, and they had there later when I went to work, I saw them, but they had\nthere all working people who had still a lot of energy in them. Energy at least and the old\nand the children they put separate. It was screaming and pulling. The parents pulled the\nchildren to them and they pulled them out of them, the Germans. And they were hitting\nthe people and they were hitting the children and they were taking out the children and\nbeating and killing those children if you're not going to get into here that's what's going to\nhappen to your child. It was the middle of the night. It was awful. It was screaming. I can\nstill hear the hollerings, the screamings, the cryings. It was an old couple he was in a\nuniform with his wife. He was holding her hand and they pulled them apart. That he is a\nman. He has to go to the men and she should go with the women. Because they didn't gas\nyou with men and women together. Women separate and men separate who has to go,\nand children whatever. So, they pulled them apart and got the screaming. They took our\nchildren from our camp didn't come with toys because they didn't have the toys, but from\nthe freedom they came with toys and they took away the toys. They keep them, the kids\nand you saw the kids walking to the ovens in and the parents and all of a sudden you hear\nscreaming.",
        "Q: There were people coming from other places?",
        "A: From other places too, of course. But they separate everything and they let us in to the --\ntook us into the camp and it was still very dark when they took us into the working\ncamps. They took us in and in the front was an orchestra playing, orchestra real people\nplaying music to the march and they said left and right, left and right and left, left, left.\nThey were singing to us, and we had to march to their singing. We marched in and we\ncame in there and they looked at that part of the train of us and they saw negroes, they\nsaid black people. Because we only had the eyes showing the faces because you touched\nfrom the coal the faces all the time. We didn't know how we looked. We came in and they\nput us under showers, cold showers. They took us in and they said now you go into\nshowers. The other one went into the gas chambers they told them the showers too, but\nwe went to give us clothes. They took all our clothes away. They shaved our heads. They\nshaved us all over and they gave us clothes.",
        "Q: What were you thinking?",
        "A: We didn't recognize each other. When we came out and we said that's you, that's you,\nthat's Tricia and that's Rose? We didn't recognize each other. That wasn't the worst part.\nThey gave us pieces of material to cover the head because it was cold and it was very,\nvery cold at that time. They let us in to the shower, cold water and all of a sudden they\nput hot water, like hot and cold, hot and cold. It was screaming terrible because here they\nbend us and here they give us cold water, cold, freeze us. They gave us barracks to go\ninto. They gave me the 21st block. Then he came into the blocks and I came with her\nmother. We were in one block. We keep each other together. We hold.",
        "Q: I need you to explain something. When somebody looks at this tape many years from\nnow, they're not going to know who her mother 1s. They didn't know who her is.",
        "A: That's what I want to say. I and we hold hands with Hannah at that time I\ndidn't know her name but she was and I held hands with Tricia that my father\nfound, and other girls and we said we're going to stay together. We hold each other\ntogether. Don't let us part, but we couldn't help. It so happened that we went to the same\nbarrack, so we were all together and we became I and and many others,\nshe was now and we were holding hands. Before we went there to the\nblocks. They took us into tattoo us. So, we went in for tattoos. We were already clean so\nthey tattoo us. So, they took just a pen and ink and they stretched our skin and they put\nthe pen in one place and they scratch like a four, they scratch that piece and they put\nanother dot and they scratch it farther and the scratch was the whole time was scratching.\nThen they put a -- this 1s a half of a little Jewish star so some had tattoos, some had the\ntattoos here, some had here a little higher, some had that here, the pants. So, this is what\nand that was my number. They stretch our skin. They put the pen just pen and ink, they\nmade a hole and they scratched it under the skin until they have to make the four the\nother corner and they pulled it this way. That's the way you see they scratched inside and\nyou'll see in each beginning and in each corner a dot because from there on they went\nfarther. That was the number. Some had bigger numbers. This was the pen. They knew\nthat this transport came at that and that time, like in '42, they came in. So, they know\nwhen we came in. Others had different places too. Then the gave us numbers the same\nnumbers to put on the clothes. So we had the numbers here, we had the number here we\nhad the number some on the back, some you know the men had it in the back but we had\nthem only here and here because if you're going to run away this is an easy target. You\ncan find the person right away. So, that's what they did and they gave us blocks so if you\nwent into the blocks we were all numbered and we all dressed in striped clothes and we\nwent and they gave us underwear. I don't know what kind and who had it before and they\ngave us wooden shoes. Huge ones, on my foot I was a five and they gave me a man's big\nshoe so we were just walking in them and put some junk in it, like whatever we found to\nfill it out. Those were wooden shoes, wooden bottoms and material like junky material\ntops. That was our shoes and that's why the dress. When we saw each other how we\nlooked and how we dressed we laughed and we cried and we didn't know what -- we\nreally didn't know how to behave. We laughed like I was you know bald so I didn't see\nme but I saw her, the other person. So, we were all bald.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: One thing that I am sort of curious about is how the physical conditions at Auschwitz\ncompared to what you experienced at Maidanek?",
        "A: Different, much, much different. Hannah she was a very clean lady. She\nloved cleanliness and so am I and we were afraid that we were going to get like\neverybody else. They had malaria. They had typhus. They had and that\neverything together and besides everything from the dirt we had sores from the body. If\nsomebody didn't wash, they just died from that. They went to the gas chambers with\nthose sores, but Hannah, , used to wake me up in the\nmiddle of the night and she said you know what, I found a place that's called they wash\nclothes and water 1s dripping a little in the middle of the night we went out with her\nbecause we weren't allowed, but we sneaked out. I'm always forgetting I always say\nbarrack and we always sneaked out and we cleansed ourselves. Thanks to her she gave\nme the courage she said come on, come on let's go because you like to be clean and so do\nI. So, we washed ourselves with that little drop of water, we shared it. So, that was very\nimportant. It was a terrible, they gave us five minutes to go to the bathroom, and we were\nsitting around and you know, number one, it wasn't a bathroom, it was a room with holes\nand you could sit there for five minutes and they opened the water in the morning for five\nminutes you have to get to the water and wash your face and drink a little water and go to\nwork. They start counting us going out to work we had to be all together. They count us.\nThey separate us who is going where to what work to what shop and we had to march out\nby the music, no matter what. The music was waiting for us.",
        "Q: Who was playing the music?",
        "A: People from-- they were in concentration camp and they asked them if they know how to\nplay and they gave them instruments and they told them to play. They cry and play\nbecause what else can you do.",
        "Q: What were the actual physical conditions like? How did they differ from Maidanek? Was\nit more comfortable, less comfortable?",
        "A: Less, less, it was worse. First of all they made selections every few weeks. They looked\nat you naked. You had to go through naked with your clothes on your arm and they\nlooked you through like cattle and looked at your teeth, exactly like cows like cattle,\nthey're buying cows to work. So, they looked us through from the front and from the back\nand they went around us like you know looking all over you. This was selections, called\nselections, and they selected if you were still good to work they send you straight ahead\nand if not they took you out on the side. So, you knew that this was the end. So one time\nin a selection like this, I had a friend from my town and her name was .\nI forgot her name and last night I was thinking and I said you know, I think I know the\nname, it's , and she was heavy, and I was a skinny girl and she was very,\nvery heavy and she lost a lot of weight and she said but I'm still heavier than you. You\nare bones. You see sometimes on television those thin boned people. We call them\n5a is a piece of gold, nothing else, just bones or a\nmusselman. A musselman is completely to nothing. He couldn't walk any more. That was\na musselman, and that she said to me I was going before her and she was\nbehind me and she said, you know let's change places because when they look at you\nthey are going to take you to the gas chamber and I have here on my arm a wound and\nshe said put the clothes because we should keep the clothes in our right hand, not the left\nand she said change it and you cover this because even with a little thing like this they\ntook you to the gas chambers. So, and she said I'm going to walk before you and you\nafter. They're going to look at me not you they're not going to see you. She was right. A\nfat person when you lose weight your skin hangs, and she went through and they took her\naside and they took down her number and I went through. She went to the gas chamber,\nbut she was working with us for two weeks. They took down her number and every day\nthey're going to call me now, they're going to call me today, and I said why did you do\nthat for me? You could live and I could go, and she no, I wanted to go. You're going to\nstay here and she gave me her piece of bread and she said you take care of yourself. So,\nanyway, after two weeks they called her name and she went to the gas chamber and I\nwent through like they didn't see me, like she said. And I always have her on my\nconscious that maybe she was saving me that maybe she went instead of me. I don't\nknow. I have that on my conscious many, many years. So, I come out of there and she\nwas calming me down, don't worry. I want to go, I want you to live and I wanted to go I\nhave nothing to live for. Maybe you'll find your father and your brother. Maybe you're\nstill going to have anybody to live for. So, she kissed me goodbye and she gave me the\nbread and she went. They used make a , they used to take all our clothes\nand put it, in the winter time, and like a big huge I don't know, it was like a swimming\npool with water, and they put something in it to kill the lice and all the insects. So, they\ngave you back those clothes and you had to go to work, so you put them on wet until you\nwalk out to work it as frozen on you, but this was our life. You asked me how different it\nwas. It was completely different. Then when we came into the camp, you smelled the\nflesh. You smelled burning. You walked out, you saw on the other side camps like each\nhad a name. We had Loger A, Loger B, Loger C. In one there were all gypsies. In the\nother one were children or Gentiles, not only Jews and then the third one was anybody\nwho was a little crippled had you know a hunch back or something. That's a cripple. So\nevery time he came back from work another one was gone. No more children, no more\nplaying, no more singing and they didn't like homosexuals and they killed them all too.",
        "Q: So, they would liquidate a block at a time?",
        "A: Yes, all of a sudden you would see it's missing. It's not there any more. Then we saw the\nfire going. I lived closed to a crematorium. The smell was unbelievable. The screams\nwere terrible. You heard them screaming going in, not because they were afraid. They\ndidn't tell them they were going to death. They just told them that they were going to go\nfor a shower and they were going to come out. But still, when they went in, one pushed\nthe other the mother wants to go with the child, it was terrible screams.",
        "Q: How did you learn what that was, the smoke?",
        "A: We knew who was burning. You know when fresh transports came from freedom -- not\nreally freedom, they were better off wherever they were like at Bergen-Belsen or in other\ncamps than Auschwitz, so they had a little flesh on them, so when the flesh was burning\nyou saw only smoke. You didn't see a fire, you know. The flames you didn't see, only\nsmoke. When we were burning, like those musselmens, like what they didn't like, you\nsaw flames. So, we knew that those are the freedom people and those are our people. We\nknew who was who, burning.",
        "Q: How did you first learn what was going on in there at all, though?",
        "A: The minute they brought you in and they send you to work and you saw before people\nwere coming in to work it was just a crematorium. Or they brought them in not a\ncrematorium made to burn but they were killing them there because we were finding\nspoons on the floor, bones, heads, we saw heads with hair to work. We saw because I\ndon't think they buried them very deep and they were buried -- you know we could see.\nWe were walking on bones and hair, on heads.",
        "Q: Do you think these were things that didn't get burned properly?",
        "A: No, they didn't have the oven finished yet, so they just killed them and they just covered\nthem with I think a very, they were not covered much and we found like spoons and forks\nand things like this. We were lucky we found those. We had something to eat with\nbecause we ate with the fingers. It was not civilization. It was, I think in the old ages,\nthey had a better civilization that we had. Germans looked us over naked like pieces of\nmeat. We didn't have our period time because they put something in your food that we\nweren't women.",
        "Q: How do you know that?",
        "A: Because I worked later in the kitchen and we were putting in -- it was very bitter what we\nput in.",
        "Q: What was it?",
        "A: I don't remember the name of it. It was like a powder and you put that powder into the\nsoup and we at that so a woman wasn't a woman and a man wasn't a man either, I\nsuppose. I don't know.",
        "Q: They didn't tell you what 1t was?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You just saw the results?",
        "A: Of course. We didn't have periods. We were young because how you know how we never\nbeing there we didn't think about if we're going to live. We didn't know we were going to\nlive through it. If we would live through it if we're going to be able to have children, to\nbear children. Never never in life because we didn't even have -- I was married already. I\nhad a child already. There, is I said I have a child and I had a husband and they used to\nsay I was nuts because I looked like a little girl. We were bones, no breasts, nothing.\nThey took away our dignity. They took away everything you have in life, and we didn't\ncare. We just didn't want to suffer, but we didn't care, but we did suffer because they saw\nwe used to go to work every morning. At first you used to work in the outside\ncommander. So, we used to go out in the fields. In the fields we found a row of potatoes.\nIt was a jewel. In the outside commander we were in the fields. When we found a row of\npotatoes we ate it like it is. No water, no nothing, with the dirt and everything, so and it\nwas so good that I used to say if I'm going to live ever. If I'm going to live, after a dinner\nif I'm going to have enough dinner that's going to be my desert. It was so delicious.",
        "Q: What kind of work were you doing in the outside commando?",
        "A: In the outside commando I don't know what this is called in America. We called it\n. If you took that in your hand, your body burned. That's a reed, like a\nburning reed and from this they made soups in the kitchen, so we used to pick those. A\nwhole day with our hands. We felt that our hands were so swollen after a day, and we\nbrought that into the kitchen to cook the soups from it. Sometimes we went into the\nswamps, because it was swampy. Auschwitz was swampy and we went into the water to\nthe knees or higher and we were pulling those reeds from there and we are putting those\nreeds they gave us to fill after the day after we picked them, they gave us pieces of like\nsocks and we put them for a mattress. That's supposed to be our mattress, but those reeds\nare very sharp on the ends and they cut our hands. That didn't matter. We were bleeding.\nWe were swollen, but that was our job and we wanted to live, or you couldn't kill\nyourself. You didn't have any sources to kill yourself. How, people were running to the\nelectric wires or shot when you were running. So, and I think we were chicken. We didn't\nhave the guts to that.",
        "Q: There was a lot of that?",
        "A: Yes. Lots of it because you didn't have the guts. You wanted to die but you didn't know\nhow and so this 1s --",
        "Q: You must have also wanted to live?",
        "A: Must be. I remember why I wanted to live, because I knew that my father and brother are\nfree and maybe some day we are going to meet. And I knew that I have a lot of uncles in\nAmerica. I never knew my uncles even my father didn't remember them and they were\nliving in Cleveland Ohio and they were in American and I thought maybe the American\nArmy will come and they are going to bombard the place and some are going to get killed\nso it doesn't matter but at least somebody is going to get saved, you know be saved.\nThat's what we did in the beginning. Then they were selecting people all the time in the\nmorning where to go and they selected me to . Did you hear about and\nthey selected me and Hannah and the same to work and that was heaven.\nWe were you know inside closed in. We were segregating clothes, which ones were\ngood, which were bad or finding gold and diamonds and had to put them in boxes\nbecause they were watching you like hawks.",
        "Q: These were items from the new transports?",
        "A: From all the transports. Everybody who came in. We found, first of all we had to check\nall the seams in the dresses if there are not diamonds there. They were watching you what\nyou're doing. We had to throw the diamonds in there. We had everything put bundles\nmade big, big bundles and put them together and put them up you know in bunches and\nright away people came in and took them to a train and they were transported, the good\nones, to Germany. And the bad one we had to cut and tear into pieces. So, that's what we\ndid in ;",
        "Q: How did you get chosen for that?",
        "A: Just because they were going through the lines and they were choosing faces. I think they\nliked me. I don't know.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question. Was it a strange feeling going through the clothes of all these\npeople like yourself?",
        "A: Very. We knew, you know we found in Jewish clothes big crosses, bibles, catholic bibles\nbecause they were already, I think they changed their religion and they thought they were\ngoing to be saved. But Hitler found the generation of Jews and some came there and an\nold lady came in and said I am not Jewish why am I here. She said my grandparents were\nJewish. I said, that's why you're here because the Germans were the most stupid Jews in\nthe world. They didn't believe. They said we're going to win. That's our Germany. Hitler's\ngoing to vanish. You see, they didn't believe. They believe our Germany\nand they really believed in them that they are not going to kill them because they are\nGermans. So, we used to when walking to work in Birkenau we're going every morning\nto Auschwitz, four kilometers to Auschwitz to , and they told us to sing,\nwhat we were singing, but I can't sing so I'm going to just talk and it's like\n, you know what that means. The shoes and the stockings are torn\nand the dresses are , that means they are in pieces and\n, that means through the underwear when you whistles the wind. So\nthey said it German . That was our song going out to work and\nit has to be left, left, left, left. This has to be everyday. And sometimes when they were\nmean, they told us to take off the shoes in the middle of the winter and walk out barefoot\nto work. That was meanness and we had to pile up the shoes by the gate. But the music\nwas playing and we were walking. If we had sick friends we were holding them up and\nwe were walking out with them.",
        "Q: Did any of the other prisoners resent you for being in this or not?",
        "A: No. Then I worked in another place. We were building buildings. We were making\nrailroads. We were holding those heavy -- and girls didn't have the strength to hold them\nand one would let go and the other fell on the feet. It was unbearable and we had to do it.\nIf not, if you let it go, you got killed.",
        "Q: You saw people getting killed?",
        "A: Of course, beat up, killed and they'd drag him into the camp, dragging by the feet. It was\njust awful but I worked building a building and when we had the 15 minutes to get our\nsoup there was a German old man there, a very old man. At that time when I was young\nhe was in his sixties, maybe it was an old man, but he was like a manager by the\nbuildings and he couldn't talk to anybody, but I think he liked me and everyday he\nbrought me a sandwich in the morning with an egg in it. And he put it on a window and\nhe just showed me with his eyes where to take it and I took that and we shared it with the\ngirls, with Hannah and and with another girl from my town and you\nknow I shared with them a bite. Each one got a bite from me and that man brought that\nsandwich every day in the morning until I never saw him again. But that's what we were\ndoing and that was our work and our job and coming in they used to you know give us a\nlittle water and a little piece of bread and a little piece of salami some time some day and\na little margarine. I used to have sores on my body and I was afraid that I was going to\nget worse so I used to sell the margarine for a little -- we had a market between each\nother -- and I bought some ointment to put on my body. And we used to make pee --\nexcuse me I had to say it and wash our body. The salt, they didn't like the salt, the bugs,\nand we put it on the body. I did it every night. I put it on the body and many of us do the\nsame thing. That, to be insane, you didn't think about it. We had such a small brain at that\ntime. We were only thinking how we were going to make it through the day. One time we\nwent to work in the hills and I found a wild duck in the field and I took that wild duck. I\ndidn't care. I put it -- I was wearing a man's jacket like and I put it under -- and it was\nalive and I was holding with the other hand I was holding the beak of the duck and I\nbrought the duck into the camp, to Auschwitz and I sold it for a bread, a ,\nlike she was the maid of the barrack. She bought it from me because they had more bread\nand more food and she was Czechoslovakian and she bought it from me and I think they\ncooked the soup from it or I don't know what they did from it because they had the\nfacilities to do it. I had a jar of jam and a bread for us.",
        "Q: Did you keep this in your bunk?",
        "A: No, I shared it with the girls.",
        "Q: You ate it right away?",
        "A: Of course. We shared it and we had a terrific dinner. We shared that because she brought\nit in so I didn't have to sneak it in, so it was 1n already so I said let's have it and we sat in\nthe back and we all ate it and we had a ball. That was one episode I could bring\nsomething in. I couldn't believe and everybody said \"How did you do it?\" I said you see,\nhunger is more than life. I kept his beak closed so that he shouldn't make noise and I had\nfull of his feces in me, but I didn't care because I had bread. That's what happened one\ntime to me and I couldn't believe. Then I had another girlfriend who lives now in\nshe lives now in Israel and she was in care of the feces. You know what we\ndid the whole night, you couldn't get out. It was closed, you couldn't get out. So, she was\nbetter off than anybody else so on the holidays like today you come and wish each other a\nhappy new year and so the girls Hannah and other girls said go to Sarah, maybe she's\ngoing to give you something to eat because I couldn't. The people who could organize. I\ncouldn't. I wasn't the pushy type or I couldn't do it so they said look you don't eat so go to\nSarah and she will give you something. You will see. She is from your town, you took\nher into the camp and she will help you for sure. I went to her and I said\nSarah I came to wish you a happy new year and she was sitting by a , big\nplates from iron, red ones, they were red and the Greeks called them ;\nand she ate in that , full of it and she had cream of wheat and sugar and I\ndon't know what. She didn't even offer me a little bit. So, I was sitting there talking to her\nand I left and I came and I cried and they said did you get something and I said she didn't\ngive me anything. So, they hated her, but to her I come later in the last episode because\nshe knew that she doesn't deserve anything. Anyway, she was very mean. She was very\nselfish. She was from the one that she was going to live, be the only one alive. So, she\ndidn't share with anybody anything.",
        "Q: You brought up something interesting, that this was Rosh Hashana. Were you aware of\nJewish holidays in the camp?",
        "A: The Hungarian people they knew exactly when it was a holiday. And we were with the\nHungarians and they used to pray quietly. They used to say come to my bed we're going\nto pray. I didn't know how to pray. I didn't read and write Hebrew or Jewish so they were\npraying but to pray to God you can pray in any language in any place. If he is in a\nsynagogue or not church he is in every place we are, he's even here if he's there. So, we\nprayed to God and it doesn't matter where we are. That was our praying. We prayed\nquietly and we cried and we kissed each other and we wished each other a happy new\nyear. We didn't have a calendar. We did not know which day it is. We knew when\npassover is, we knew everything.",
        "Q: In some way you acknowledged all these holidays?",
        "A: You see, I was never religious, but there I prayed with everybody else. I thought maybe\nthat is going to help me. You reach out to anybody especially to God. I believe in God,\nbut I am not a fanatic. I believe in something higher than we are, better than we are of our\nsavior, but I am not like today, I am not going to a synagogue because I don't know how\nto pray, but I pray at home. I put on a tape of and I have it at home by\nmyself. I cry a little and I pray to God because he's there. If not for him, maybe I wouldn't\nbe here. My father after the war used to say where was he when we needed him the most,\nand I said he couldn't take care of all of us. So, that was Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Were the guards horrible? Were the block elders Jewish?",
        "A: Not the , was Jewish, but the elders they were Germans. They were\nGermans and let me tell you that's very important one episode in Auschwitz. One day we\nwere coming back from work and was standing in the middle of the like a\nplace, a big one, and they made pole to hang somebody and everybody came in and he\nsaid halt so everybody had to stand around. We didn't know what this was for, but we\nknew something is going to happen, something bad will happen. So, we were standing all\naround and they brought in a girl. She was Czechoslovakian and her name was Molly and\nshe was working in the underground but she was working in Birkenau. She was a\n, do you know what a is? She was like a message girl and\nthey were sending her in from the front from the camp inside a messenger girl so she\nknew everything but in the meantime, she was working in the underground with another\nPolish guy and the men's camp and he was not Jewish, he was a Pollack and his name\nwas , and they were working together. They had German uniforms. She had\nthe right to go here and there, so she put on a German uniform and he a German uniform\nand they want out of Germans and they were reporting to the underground what's going\non inside. So, that went on for a few years. Somebody, always somebody will tell on you.\nSo, they denounced them and they caught her and they let her go out in a German\nuniform and they caught her outside. They wanted to see where she was going but she\nfelt something wrong and she didn't go the places where she was supposed to go and they\ncaught her in the men's because we weren't together with men. They were like -- we were\non the east side, they were on the west side. We just met them when they came to fix\nsomething in our camp or something so we weren't allowed to talk to anybody. So, she,\nthey caught her and they brought her in and they were supposed to hang her for\neverybody to see what's going to happen to those people who are working against the\nGermans. So, he was standing there and he was so happy to see that she's going to be\nhanged soon and her hands were tied in the back and somebody, we don't know who, we\nwere all standing around. The whole B, I was in Lager B and the whole B Lager was\nstanding in that appel, and we were supposed to witness what is going to happen. In the\nmeantime somebody gave her a razor to cut her and she had her hands tied and she cut\nher wrist with a razor, both of them and when she started, the blood started running and\nshe was starting to faint so they looked what happened and she was fainting, so they\nstopped the hanging and they took her they brought a cart like and they put her there and\nshe was instead she was cremated. She said long live Poland, long live the freedom, long\nlive the world without Hitler. She wasn't afraid any more. And they took her away. That's\nwhat we witnessed.",
        "Q: Were there other acts of resistance that you noticed?",
        "A: There was one but they decided that did you hear about commander. The men\nin the commander decided to run away and tell everybody to run after them\nand they cut them and they shot them, they were shooting at them and they were pulling\nthem in. They let us watch them like by the feet. was running and they\nbrought them back to the camp. But they were running. A lot of people were running and\na lot of people there were dead. About that time about 200 people died, maybe. I don't\nknow the exact number, but a lot of people and we saw that. Because they said today\nyou're going to run, word of mouth, mouth to mouth, we knew what's going to happen. If\nI was chicken I wouldn't run, but somebody didn't. They said that's our chance where to\nrun. They were all over. So, they tried. They burned them all. They beat them up first and\nthen they burned them.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any reason to be in the hospital there?",
        "A: No. That was to let me tell about Tricia. I'm going to the hospital. That Tricia who my\nfather saved she was very lazy and she said I'm going to go to the , that's the\nhospital. The Germans called it ;",

She was there a\nlong time. I used to go to her and I used to say get out of here. They're going to take the\nwhole . They're going to burn you. They are going to kill you here and she\nsaid no, no I have it good I am like a nurse and like this and some people came into the\ncamp pregnant. They wanted you to be pregnant. They used to take out the children.\nThey killed the mother and they made the children they were guinea pigs. So, she was\nhelping there and one day Tricia was killed. They took her out. I was never there. I said I\nwill never go there because when you say you're sick, you're certain 99 percent you wind\nup in the gas chambers.",
        "Q: I was wondering if anyone you knew had any first hand information about some of the\nexperiments?",
        "A: I wasn't there and I can't give you any information. I know they were taking out the open\nstomach the mother or they let her have the baby and she suffered and then they killed\nher and they brought her to the gas chambers and on the kids they were the guinea pigs.",

        "A: I didn't see. I saw lesbians. I hear lesbians doing it and we didn't know what lesbian 1s. I\nsaid, what are they doing there? So, they said, don't you know? They make love, and I\nsaid, what love? I don't know a woman with a woman and they said they are lesbians. So,\nbecause there were a lot of Germans too. But they were Czechoslovakian and they lived\non top of me and I hear them.",

I don't know how, but I knew what I knew I had two girls, two Marishas, from\nWarsaw and I know that they were prostitutes and they were doing things with the\nGermans there, too, but I didn't see it.",

So, we went they took us and so they said so\nyou're going to go on a transport. We waited about two weeks or so and we went for a\ntransport and they took us to ,",
        "Q: Were your friends with you?",
        "A: Yes, all of us, like Hannah and the others, a lot of them. Some went to the gas chambers.\nOne said I'm going I can't take it anymore. So, whoever was alive went with me because\nwe kept together all Hannah and others you know. Hannah was with me close to the end\nof her life, so that's why she is the closest to me and I talk about her because she was like\nmy sister.",
        "Q: How big was the transport, Rose?",
        "A: I have no idea. It was a few blocks. They filled up a few blocks and they kept us naked\nfor about three or four weeks. I don't even know how long they kept us there because\npeople used to come to our windows from there and they used to see in one girl came,\nwho she was my brother's friend and she looked at me and she thought I am my other\nsister, , and she said are you , and I said who are you and she said\nit's Sophie Biaz. She was Polish. She wasn't Jewish, she was catholic and she was a\nguinea pig there because she was taken from our town. We didn't know where she\nvanished to the Gestapo and she was working with her husband in the underground. So,\nshe came to the window and she saw me and she started crying like a baby. She brought\nme a piece of bread into the window and she said do you know what happened to me?\nShe was very tall and very she had very gorgeous legs, she said you know what I don't\nhave my cartlidges by my bones and I can only walk five or ten minutes most and my\nfeet, I don't have any feeling in my legs so she was a guinea pig there. She helped me\nthere a little and they kept us there and they fed us there naked and we were on the beds\ndoing nothing and just you know kidding around and not knowing even what's going to\nbring tomorrow. We didn't know. Are we going to stay here, nobody knows.",
        "Q: You didn't have any clothes?",
        "A: No, nothing. They took our clothes because they didn't want to watch us all the time to\nwalk around to get mingled with others. We were locked in and no clothes so that's okay.\nWe had a blanket you know like one blanket of eight and that's okay. We had a little\nsomething to cover ourselves and we were walking around naked. So, it didn't bother us\nbecause we were all women and we didn't have anything to hide. We didn't have anything\nperiod.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: When you're traveling from one camp to another, are there peasants, are there people that\nyou pass that see you?",
        "A: We didn't have windows. They knew -- the Pollacks or wherever we went through knew\nthat there were people in them. Because some through a little hole put a hand out,\nscreamed out, but nobody saw. We didn't see anybody. We had to see somebody through\na little hole. But nobody come close to us.",
        "Q: So you're in were you working?",
        "A: No, we didn't work there. We were just waiting for a transport to a place where to go. So,\nthe front was coming closer and closer and they had transport people closer to Germany.\nSo, that's why we wind up 120 miles from Germany, from Berlin. That was\nwe didn't know about who knew so all of a sudden they come in. They\nopened our blocks and they said you're going to a transport. Now, they gave us the\nclothes, the bundles and they told us to dress and we're going. We marched out from\nthere. Again, we went in to train. Everything was a train. Not people train, but car trains.\nSo, they put us there. They gave us a little bread and there we go. They gave us a piece of\nbread.",
        "Q: How long was the train ride do you remember?",
        "A: To I don't know. From Maidanek to Auschwitz it was four days. A long\ntime, a long, long time. Here 1t wasn't short, maybe two days. I'm not sure. But when we\ncame there and they opened the gates for us and we were the first ones, nobody was\nthere. It was quiet. We said, \"My God we came to heaven. Now we are in heaven.\" So,\nthat was about a thousand of us, maybe a little more, the first transport.",
        "Q: When do you think this was, maybe the end of '44? Was it getting that late?",
        "A: Yes that was the end of '44 because I was there until about April 25 or something the\nmiddle of April and then they took us out. The Germans were still around because we\nwere an exchange for soldiers. So, when we came in there we were so happy. We are in a\nnew place and we know each other and a girl knew that I made manicure for the Germans\nso she asked the , a German woman, a very, very SS woman, a terrible\nperson, and she asked the girls who knows how to make her manicure and she said I\nknow how to make her and she knows how to make manicure and she said okay, I need\nonly her. So, she took me after a few days we were there. And she said you're going to\nwork in the kitchen and you're going to be at my disposition any time I need you. And I\nsaid, fine. So what else can you do. She had a boyfriend there, a Gestapo man, and she\nwanted to look nice, good to him and be you know combed nice and she said to the other\ngirl, okay, you can comb my hair but I'm going to take her. And she didn't like it and she\nsaid do you know how to comb my hair and I was scared to death. If I'm going to do\nwrong, she's going to kill me. And I said, how, just wet waves, like waves, and I said I'm\ngoing to try, maybe I don't know but I can try. And she said try it. She gave me a comb\nand I made it nice with a fingers, I made the waves. I don't know how. Fear teaches you\neverything. From fear you know everything. There's not a thing that you don't know. So,\nI start making her hair and she said I'm going to show my boyfriend my hair. She's going\nto show if he likes it and he said it's wunderbar, it's wunderbar so that's all, so I became\nher private beautician and manicurist, but she said to me you are going to work in the\nkitchen, that means we didn't peel potatoes, we were only that was a machine that it was\nlike scraping the potatoes with the dirt and everything. In the beginning I didn't work in\nthe kitchen so my girlfriend Hannah, no another girlfriend used to make pancakes, no\npotato pancakes threw them in a little oven there and with the sand and the dirt and\neverything just like baking them and we were supposed to swallow them because you\ncouldn't chew them. It was in the teeth, it was an awful feeling so we were swallowing\nthem to fill the stomach. So, she cooked a little soup and she brought me up to eat a little\nsoup, but when I was in the kitchen so Hannah wasn't there yet. They took from -- no\nHannah was there. We all were there. Going out to Sweden she wasn't there. So, then\nother girls start coming into from Auschwitz, from\nwherever they took them, because Auschwitz was in Poland and the Russians came very\nclose to there so they had to evacuate very fast. So the evacuation came very fast and\nthey brought them 1n bunches to . So, Hannah came with the next\ntransport with me and other girls and that Sarah Goldberg what I tell you she was there\ntoo, and I worked already in the kitchen. After a while she prepared me she didn't want\nme to be by the potatoes. She wanted me to be a cook to have nice hands to hold her\nhands and I said I couldn't believe it I was in a kitchen and I saw food. And so when the\ntransport a few weeks later a new transport came and I came out of the kitchen with a\nwhite, I was wearing a white uniform in the kitchen because that kitchen cooked for the\nGermans too. So they picked me in the day time they took me in the dining room where\nthe Germans ate to be a waitress. It was very nice. So, I had to wear a white uniform. So,\nI came out when a new transport came in and I looked who was there and I saw who is\nfrom our girls who 1s from the camp and said Ruzia\nit's me and so I said it's good to see you and we hugged and I said who\nis with you and she said Sarah is with me and others. They are all with me and another\nRushka is with me an I said okay. That Sarah thought I was a nurse so she didn't even\ncome close to me, but when she hears that I'm in the kitchen and they said what are you\ndoing here, what are you doing here, I said I am in the kitchen. I am working as a cook.\nSo she wants to be my friend but I had ten girls. We are together. We came all together\nand I said to Hannah, Bessie's mother, I said you are going to be the\nsupervisor of the food. You're going to feed all ten girls that left after that terrible,\nterrible what happened to us and you know terrible deal that happened to us and we are\nalive and I will help you. So, she said fine. I said put them together, tell me how many are\nthere and I somehow I was going to steal the food from the kitchen and I am going to\nfeed you. In the meantime I was transferred to block one, because there whoever worked\nfor the Germans had to be clean and that was the first block was for the clean people.\nAnd there I found a woman and a little boy. He was nine years old. She was a doctor and\nthe husband was a doctor, but the husband was killed already. And that boy's name was\n, and he was with the parents with the mother because they were\ndoctors.",
        "Q: Where were they from?",
        "A: They were from Lemberg, but they were in that camp when they put me in that barrack,\nin that you know, barrack, they were there.",
        "Q: They were Polish?",
        "A: They were Jews from Poland from and that boy, I felt that I found my\nnephew and I adopted that boy and I said I'm going to help him with anything I can. That\nboy was so skinny so I said all right I will bring you sugar whatever I can and for him it\nwas a special deal. The others used to come with buckets under the windows in the\nmiddle of the night and I used to give the food out until they found out. But before they\nfound out I used to give it through the back. But for him I used to bring the food in my\npanties. You know, the panties have something to hold you here, I don't know what it\nwas, it wasn't a band like to tie so I put there from the Germans I stole like cream of\nwheat cooked, warm and a little sugar and a little margarine and I used to a piece of\nsalami and I used to bring for . His mother had a sweater and she taught him\nhow to needle -- how to crochet and he crochet for me from his mother's sweater a pair of\ngloves not to be cold because it was winter time and when I came in he was sick that\ntime. Something was wrong with him and he said I have something for you from the\nback, and he gave me mittens, you know. I lost them, I don't have them and that name\nnever, never went out of my mind. I remember exactly his name after 50 years ago. So, I\ndon't know what happened, but I helped them and the girls. I used to tell them to come to\nthe back window because you see we had was built for only a thousand\nwhat is it's like you cut them and put them in the war time\nin jail, prisoners. It was made for 1,000 French prisoners and they brought in 5,000 so the\nkitchen was going 24 hours a day. We cooked the whole night and the first dinner was\n9:00 in the morning for food and then it was 12:00 and then it was about 3:00, 4:00 in the\nafternoon and then you slept a little. You know when I cooked in the morning or in the\nnight, I slept in the daytime a little. So, it was three shifts to cook the food and so when I\nworked nights, I used to say you come over and I'll give you through the window I'm\ngoing to give you a bucket of food and you saw Hannah, , she sent every\ntime another girl under the window.",
        "Q: You had a fair amount of freedom of movement there?",
        "A: Movement you had but you had to go, you worked there but I didn't but the other girls\nthey made they worked out underground and they had factories hidden in the woods like\nand they were making ammunition and the girls went out to work ammunition. But you\nsee it was 24 hours who was in the daytime they could sleep, inside you could walk\naround but when you had to go out to work you worked by the ammunition. I was never\nthere.",
        "Q: Were the general conditions better than Auschwitz?",
        "A: Much better, but it was very small. It was very crowded. It was people were beaten to\ndeath. You know, it wasn't honey. It wasn't a resort, it was a camp, but that was the best\none from all of them, so because it was really in Germany, so the German ladies, the SS\nwomen who worked in the kitchens and they worked with us. They were our superiors\nand some were very bitchy, very bad.",
        "Q: Weren't you afraid of being caught?",
        "A: Oh yes, but it didn't matter. You see, it really didn't, I was afraid and I was not afraid\nbecause to save a life it was worth it. To save ten lives it was more worth it. So, I used to\nin the day time when I didn't cook I had to be occupied so they had permissions from the\nwho I made the hair every day I put up her hair and sometimes every\nsecond day a manicure. I was scared to death but I did it. Then I got so much that I know\nnow how to make them. I was so good to make those waves with my fingers with a little\nwater, that's all, and she dried them in the sun. I had permission to go that she get\npermission to the other German SS women who watched us, the watch dogs that I can go\nsometimes to them if they need me. So, she had a list of ten or something that she's going\nto send me there today or tomorrow. And I had one to tell me wash the floors and to\nmake the hair and to wash her toilet and that's okay. That was fine enough. One I had she\nwas a very mean , very mean, but somehow she liked me and when I came\nshe said don't do anything. I don't need you for nothing. Just come down and lie down\nnear me and tell me your story or tell me how you came here and we talked and she told\nme her story how she became a German and she was young and she had a baby and she\ntold me her story. Then I had another one she used to tell me let's go shopping. And she\ntook me shopping with her. She took me in her jeep and I should carry her bags.",
        "Q: You went into a town shopping?",
        "A: A little town, but the little town, but the butcher knew that I was Jewish. He said you\nthere, out. So he wouldn't let me in, and she said okay you stay outside. I come out and\nthen we go back, and she used to sit and talk to me and she used to give me something to\neat. She always prepared something good for me. Then in the kitchen worked one,\nbecause you see those German women, those SS women they weren't really trained by\nthe SS. They were short of people, of women, so they took them out from the factories.\nThey were factory women. They gave them a little. They taught them a little what has to\nbe done, a course how to get through it and they put them in a uniform and they put them\ninto those camps like, little camps. So, in the kitchen was an angel and we\ncalled her angel. When I wanted to take something out for that boy I said\n, and she said she didn't want to see it. She\ndidn't want to know about it. So, I took out things. One time I took out a salami, big like\nmy hand, I don't know how. It was bigger than my hand, and I put in a big salami like this\nin my arm until here and I smuggled that salami out and they were the happiest people in\nthe world. I smuggled out a whole salami and if they would catch me there they told me\ndon't do that. If they're going to catch you they're going to kill you in the place, but I did\nit. But you see the winter time was very bad because when they came through the back\nwindow for the food they saw foot prints in the snow that every night somebody is there.\nThe snow falls in the day time, at night you have more foot prints. Then they found\nsomething out that something's going out and they were watching. Who is going to the\nback, but you know somebody nice told the girls that somebody knows that somebody 1s\ngoing to pick up the food at night. It was -- they found foot steps by the door, so we had\nto change all the whole plan. We changed it and I said okay from now on don't go there\njust come to the front and whenever I'm going to see that nobody is looking I'm going to\ngive you fast and you just run, and that's the way they were picking up the food, through\nthe front. We didn't care, they would shoot us all because they would find out who is\neating this food, but we didn't care. In the meantime, they really had a ball. They ate. This\nwas going on for quite a while.",
        "Q: I assume in the kitchen, the food you served the Germans was very different than the\nfood you got?",
        "A: Of course we couldn't have it. We just helped, but you know sometimes you just got like\na little doggie bag, bug they knew how many steaks they have. They knew exactly what\nthey have. To us they used to bring the killed horses from the front and the horse meat\nwas smelly and terrible and we cooked the soups from it. We put meat, but we had meat.\nCan you imagine what we had, we had meat and if somebody found a little piece, like a\nlittle square of meat they said I have meat in my soup but we the only thing that we could\ndo, you know the bones they cooked over and over and over because the bone has the\nmarrow inside so we had to cut the bones and cook the soup so we took out the marrow\nand we put them in a casserole underneath. We took the potatoes what has to go to the\nsoup, we stole potatoes and we put that in a casserole and we put that in the oven where it\nwas burning and we made ourselves a delicious dish. We put that dish in the toilet and\nevery time somebody else went in to have a little and that was very fat and that filled you\nup right away because it really was fat, the marrow was so fat but that was delicious. I\nwouldn't eat it now, but at that time it was delicious. This and then sometimes when they\ntook me to waitress and most of the days I used to finish when my cooking. You should\nhave seen what was cooking, just lousy food. Everything was just the leaves of the\ncabbage was the leaves what the Germans didn't eat. They were rotten. Everything was\nrotten that came into our soup, but it was okay. It was soup. You know what, we used to\nput the margarine, they were like in bricks. I think each brick was two pounds or one\npound and they used to count in each huge like for the military they had to go in ten\nbricks of margarine so we used to pick them in. That's a terrible thing to say, we used to\nput that in and they made the mark, you know, it's fat around, and we used to take out the\nmargarine to feed the girls. Everybody had somebody, so we used to take it out. We used\nto eat good there in the kitchen, but some we left, but a few we took out, but the mark\nwas they come, they count, that was ten.",
        "Q: How long were you in ?",
        "A: In I was there about nine months.",
        "Q: You were there that long?",
        "A: Yes, and then from one day the German came into the kitchen because I\nhelped the Germans that was just poor Germans they didn't have enough\nfood that time either and they weren't bad. They were good to us. They used to bring us\nthe news of the day, where the Germans are and where the Russians are and I think the\nwar is ending 1s because they weren't real soldiers either. They took them out from\nfactories. They used to give us the news for the day, where they are and they said, you\nknow what, I think they are making an exchange of prisoners of war for you and I think\nyou are going to leave soon here and the woman the in the kitchen she\nsaid are you going to let them kill me. I said no not you. You are our angel but she knew I\nwasn't waiting until then and she was really nice not to kill and she said I know the\nGermans I know we are all going to get killed. One day when they were talking about it\nsoon somebody I think American are coming to save you to give you freedom. The Red\nCross because made a deal to the Germans that they are going to get one of us\nfor a 100 of German soldiers and prisoners. So, they made a deal and they took blocks of\nus but when the Americans come in to us and we were really afraid. We were afraid of\neverybody. They said, don't worry. We are American.

        "Q: You went to Denmark or Sweden?",
        "A: Denmark first. But going to Denmark that's not so easy. In the Red Cross on the top of\nthe trucks they had written big Red Cross. When the airplanes fly around you they know\nit's a Red Cross truck but they knew who is there and they went so close to our trucks and\nthey with machine guns they were just shooting all around us and on us and they killed\none truck 40 people completely. There were 40 in a truck and then Americans before they\nsaw they were on top of us they stopped the trucks and said run into the ditches. You run\nwherever you can and we started running. So, we went in, it was someplace a house like\na farmer's house, a farmer lived there and we run into the house and they threw us out and\nthey say now that the Germans didn't know what's happening. And they said you\nand they didn't let us in. So, we had to hide in the ditches, and the\nAmerican soldiers were so good to us. They put they hands under our feet to put us up.\nThey knew what horrible life we had. They and we didn't understand English, but they\nwere showing us you know that you're free, you're free, but he said you're still not free,\nand they said to go to the ditches and to run and to hide. They, it's going to get a little\ndarker. They are going to take us through the woods into Denmark and we were walking\na whole night because they couldn't see anything so they couldn't shoot us. And we were\nwalking, a lot of us, into Denmark. When we came to Denmark, the people in Denmark\nwere So nice.",
        "Q: Did you have to cross water?",
        "A: Not to Denmark, to Sweden. It's a lot of Germans living in Denmark too. They are not all\nDanish. They are a lot Germans. So, the first thing when they took us in they start\npreparing us and they used to say please don't talk about the Germans. We have a lot of\nspies in here and you are not still free, remember. They warned us and they gave us food\nand they said don't eat too much because it's not good for you. You should eat slowly and\nnot too much because you're going to get sick. So, we were in Denmark about three\nweeks. Then the Denmark people, it was a rainy day when we were leaving to Sweden\nand they were standing with bouquet of flowers and they were hugging us and they were\nwishing us the best and we didn't understand them but the German they spoke to us and\nthey hugged us and they kissed us and they wished us luck and the best and not to eat too\nmuch and nothing to be careful. And they gave us bouquets of flowers.",
        "Q: Where were you living in Denmark, in a camp?",
        "A: We were living not in a camp, it was like you know maybe barracks like before but they\nput us all up in a circle in some houses just like shacks and they kept us there and they\ngave us very good food. They put us all together by tables and they fed us and they\nwatched us not to eat too much. They said no, no don't eat too much.",
        "Q: Was this with the help of the Swedish and Danish Red Cross too?",
        "A: Yes, this was with the Red Cross, the Danish and Swedish. The whole of Red Cross\nbecause the Americans were watching us there, too. They were with us.",
        "Q: So then you went to Sweden?",
        "A: No, they took us in trains and they brought us to we had to go through the water by boat.\nThey brought us to the boats and we now in the boat we were free. We could talk because\nin Denmark still they were warning us please we want you not to talk about it and we\nwant you to live through it. We don't want you to be killed in here. Then, in the boat\nabout 24 hours we had to go across the water and so we came to to\nSweden, and there they were beautiful white clean not mattresses, but like with straw,\nthose things, with beautiful white sheets that we didn't see for so many years. Then, it\nwas written something in , 1t was too much to eat I supposes it's for\nand , and I said we came again to Germans they\nare talking about and that's forbidden. But we read it in German and it's\n. So they gave us really the red carpet and they took us to a beautiful,\nbeautiful department store and they dressed us from A-Z, from the bottom to the top,\neverything new, even a girdle, bras, everything and a coat, a beautiful brown coat I had\nand boots.",
        "Q: Were you living in a camp?",
        "A: No, they took us to a . They took us in different places. Some went to\ndifferent cities. They took me and another girls to , and they put us in\nthe quarantine. For about three months we had to be there because people used to get sick\nand a lot of them died, a lot. So, we used to be in a quarantine and every Sunday people\nfrom the city learned about it and they came to we were in with big fences but people\nwent through the fences and they talk and they ask us questions and they speak very well\nEnglish and German, so one couple came to the and they saw me and they\nsaid we were surrounded around three ways with water. It was a lake, and you could\nswim but naked. The boys find out that these girls are swimming naked so they came to\nsee us naked there and so a couple came, a young couple, she was in the forties maybe\nforty and she looked and she said would you like to be free and go out from the\nquarantine, and I said of course I would. So, she said I can make you a passport and you\ncan get out. I am going to be your foster mother and we can adopt you so she did. They\ndid. First of all I have still a picture in that bathing suit. She brought me a bathing suit the\nnext Sunday they came. She brought me a bathing suit and she told me you don't have to\nshow anybody what you have. You're going to be in a bathing suit. And they made a\nroom for me and they took me to their place. He was an engineer and she was working in\nan office and they adopted me until I found -- I wrote letters to Europe and I found that\nmy father and brother are alive.",
        "Q: What about your husband?",
        "A: My husband, too. He came later, but I found them alive through I wrote letters I\nremember my friend's addresses and I wrote to one guy who went with me to school and\nhe said to me that day that I got your letter was the happiest day of my life. You were\nalive. He said he saw my father and brother alive in my town at a soccer game and they\nlived some place near the ocean, and I wrote a lot of letters. So, my mother's girlfriend\nsent me a letter and he said you read that letter and drink water because you have\nsomebody alive waiting for you. So, that's the way I left Sweden after a year and a half\nand I came to and I was living with them and then my private life came.",
        "Q: Can we just talk a couple more minutes. How do you think you got through all of this?",
        "A: How do I think with my brain or with my health -- I came out pretty good. My health\nwasn't good, but it wasn't bad either. I am not a cranky person. I have an outlook of life\nwhatever happens, happens, and I am not a hyperchondriac. I am never sick. I am sitting\nhere today and my back is killing me because I came with a bad -- I was 1n bed for a\nweek before I came here to Washington and I brought with me a corset but today I am\nnot wearing it and I have pills and soon I'm going to take a pill to go home because I'm\nnot going to be able to move, but otherwise I came out -- I'm very sharp. They didn't take\naway my brain. They didn't take away my will to live. It was a pleasure and the happiest\ntime when I met my father and my father didn't want to be a Jew after the war. He was in\na church and I said no you are a Jew and he said no I can't. I said yes you will, and you're\ngoing to change your name to your old name, and he did. Then we went to Israel and\nfrom Israel I said you have to change your name to your Jewish name. You're a Luft and\nyou're going to be Luft, not Kochonoski, and he said where was he when we needed him.\nI said he was there, he's now here with us. So, and that's the way I brought my brother.

I worked twelve hours a day, but I\nmade it and I after this Warner I want to be alone and I decided that this is my life, my\nchildren, my grandchildren and that's about it.

I\nhad one brother and two sisters. We had a pretty good life because my father was a\nbuilder, and we had people working for us. We had a maid in the house, and we lived\nvery comfortable. Before the war, in 1937, 1938, a friend of my brother's came from\nWarsaw and he saw me, and he said who 1s that cute little girl. So my brother said that is\nmy sister, and he took us out for a little dinner and he fell in love with me. So, I get\nmarried to him and be married and then the war broke out, so he was in the army, in the\nmilitary, and he was hurt and he was in a hospital. So my father sent a guy who worked\nfor my father, he sent to Warsaw and he brought him as a soldier wounded 1n the war.\nThey covered his face. It was a Gentile who brought him, because the Germans were\nalready in our town, so they covered his face not to look like a Jew, not to see that he is\nJewish. Even the Germans carried him from one train to another. So, that's the time he\ncame to our town and in 1940, I got married, in the war time.",
        "A: Yes, we were just like engaged. He sent me a ring from Warsaw, but I wasn't married to\nhim, and we got married in 1940. I wasn't crazy about marrying, but he was hurt and he\nsaid he was going to go to the Germans to be killed because if I'm not going to marry\nhim, he doesn't want to live. So, my mother said you're going to die anyway, all of us, so\nwhy don't you marry him. So, I did. I was pregnant in 1941, I got pregnant in 1941, I had\na baby and her name was Maugacia (ph), in English it's Margaret, and she died when she\nwas 7 1/2 months old because she had diarrhea and we didn't have any doctors, and we\ncouldn't go to doctors.",

It's all the\nfamily, uncles and aunts and everybody lived in the same town. So, then my sister\nmarried, I was the middle one. I had an older sister married already. She was I don't know\nhow old. She was 24 when she died, but she married when she was 15 years old. By 16,\nshe had a baby. She had a boy, and that boy was during the war, and she looked-- my\nsister didn't look like a Jewish girl. She looked like a Gentile so the Gentile boys used to\nsay \"Saki, why do you need a Jew for. Throw the Jew away, like she doesn't belong to\nhim. But she was married, happily married to that guy, and they had that boy. Then the\nyounger sister, the youngest married a doctor, a young doctor. She was about that time\n20. She was born in 1921, and he was about seven years older, 27 at that time. He was a\npediatrician. They lived together, and then the Germans used to come in to give us all\nkinds of orders.",

She married his name was , and they were very\nhappy together, and when the Germans started coming into our houses and taking\neverything away, you know like here the carpets we have on the floor, but the real what\ndo you call it, not Chinese, the carpets that come from the East, we had on the walls at\nthat time. They were hanging on the walls. So, they told them to take down the carpet\nfrom the wall, and he saw that they are very rough to us and they were pushing him and\nhitting him and they decided to take their lives. So, they went into their -- because they\nlived one apartment, one home near the other and they went into their room and they told\nthe maids to go into our house and stay with my mother until they're going to wake up.\nThey're going to sleep. So, she came in and she was sitting an hour or two and she said\nthey're still sleeping. So, my mother told me to go in and see what they're doing and I saw\nthem like that both of them. He was really dead and she was all right, but she didn't know\nthat he died. They took their lives. He gave her a shot. I don't know what the stuff was\nand himself and then he told her when she wakes up before him and he's going to be dead\nalready so she give herself another shot, and he put it away in a place in the oven. We\ndidn't have like heating, but big huge ovens so she said it's there because when the\ndoctors came and the whole town was by our house and when the doctors came, his\nfriends, and they asked where is the rest of it, and she told them while\nshe was still in coma like, but she told them and they took it out and they started giving\nher shots and she came to life and she lived about three months later, but she\ndidn't go to the funeral. And she was asking where's and my mother said that he\nis in the hospital, but it was really the funeral, and they buried him. I was sitting with my\nsister because my mother said you watch her, and I was very shocked because I saw that\nfirst. After that, three months later my sister went to the Germans and she said she wants\nto go to her husband, to die. So, they said, you're to pretty to go to death, and she said, I\nwant to go, and they took her away. That's the last we saw her.",
        "A: Yes, she said she wanted to go with the transport. She wants to go to be killed because\nshe knew that they took you, it's the end of it.",
        "A: Nobody, we knew that Hitler wrote and the Germans used to tell us it's\nnothing now. You're going to see what's waiting for you. So, we knew that something 1s\ngoing on, but they didn't tell us what they're going to. They used to say to everybody that\nthey're sending us to work, to the Russian front or to camps, but never they're going to\nkill us. So, my sister after three months she saw a boy who worked for my father and she\nsaid you tell my family that I'm going to see , to be with because\nshe found out that he is dead. She didn't want to live. She was in a very bad shape,\ndepression, and she finally she went there. So, my mother was heartbroken, but she didn't\n-- we didn't want to believe that they killed right away, so my mother was sending us,\nwhere did they send the transport and if she can send packages, and they said of course.\nSo, my mother was sending packages in the unknown and she had long been dead. Who\nknows, we don't know how she got killed and so that was less one. Then they were\nmoving us place to place, and they took us out from our homes and they put us in like not\nGhettos yet, in the beginning. They just made our community smaller and smaller and\nthey put us in a Ghetto.",
        "A: Right in the beginning. They marched in and we didn't even know what happened. They\nmarched in about two weeks later, because at that time I forgot to tell you, my mother\nsent me for vacation. She said go to Warsaw to your aunt's. She wants you to have a\nvacation. So, I went to Warsaw, and the war, they started about 5:00 in the morning they\nwere calling in Warsaw, the war, the war, 5:00 in the morning, the papers. A war with\nGermany, a war with Germany, and we didn't really know what it means. I said I'm going\nhome. I want to be with my parents. My aunt, that was my father's sister, said no they're\ngoing to come to Warsaw. It's going to take a long time. You're better off to be in\nWarsaw than to go home, and I said, no I want to go home. So, she put me in a train that I\nwas with the German soldiers in a train in the beginning because Polish soldiers were\ngoing one way and German soldiers were going the other way. It was a horror. We didn't\neven know what's going on because I was never in a war and how did I know how a war\nis going to look. Finally I came home and my sister was not far, in the middle of the town\nliving, my older sister with her husband and that child, and she had a maid, her name was\nStasha and I went to the window and I started screaming Stasha, Stasha, early in the\nmorning about 5:00, 6:00 in the morning. So, she opened the big gate, because it was a\nbig building with gates, and so she opened the gate and she said quiet, everybody is\nasleep, but my sister heard and she said what are you doing here and I said, \"It's a war.\"\nIn our town they didn't know yet that it's a war, but in no time did soldiers start marching\nin. And it was a time that they were -- the Germans were grabbing older people. They\nwere shooting from the street young people, and cripples and anybody they can find, you\nknow. Like bearded Jews, you know with beards and with the Jewish you know, those\ncurls by the ears, and so they were telling him to wash the floors, to lick the floor with\nthe tongue or they said, I don't have anything to wash the floor with, so they said wash it\nwith your shirt. So, anyway, it was a terrible thing, but we never knew what was\nhappening. Then they told us we have to move together, together in a different place, but\nwe for a little while we stayed in the same place, and my sister had a maid and she was\npart of the gate, standing and the Germans used to come and they asked if there were any\nJews, and she couldn't speak German so she said, \"No, Jews,\" so they left. But we were\nin the window watching what's going on in the streets, and we saw all our neighbors a lot\nof them came out of the houses and they told them to make a big ditch and everybody\nwas working hard to make the ditch and they laid around, they told them to stay around\nthe ditches, to stand up, and that's what I saw. A very nice, I don't remember her name, a\nlady with a little girl, she was about five years old. She was holding the baby with her\nand they told them to stay with the Germans with the backs and they were shooting from\nthe back in the heads or whatever and they were falling into the graves, into the ditch.",
        "A: Right in the beginning. They were falling and she was holding on to that little baby and\nshe was killed and the baby, and after a while in full blocks and lots and lots of people. I\ndon't remember how many it was at that time, but a lot of people fell into that grave, and\nthat little baby came out after about five or ten minutes, from under the mother because\nthey shoot her in the back of the head, so the little baby was she was holding on her so\nshe wasn't hurt, and she came out from under the mother's body and she was begging\nthem on the knees please don't kill me. I want to live, and they killed her just straight on\nher -- and she died. This we all saw and my nephew said you see what they're doing. At\nthat time he was about five years old. He said, \"I don't want to be killed like this.\" And\nso, 1t was over and we cried and we said this is going to be our end. At that time, I\nworked already for the Germans, the SS, the German engineers, and I used\nto be Ruzia, but they called me Pauline. They gave me the name Pauline that was easier\nfor them. Sometimes they called me Rozamunda or you know all kinds of names, but I\nworked for the Germans and my mother used to take my sister's children and we used to\nwork; all of us, and my child and she used to babysit my mother, for the children. My\nmother at that time was about 45 or something like this. I don't know what year my\nmother was born, and she was watching the children and we were working. One time I\nsaid I want to go home because they're killing people there, and the SS men said no\nyou're not going because you'll only get killed. You stay here. He was a very nice SS man\nand he wasn't in the military. He was a civilian SS, and my mother gave me the baby and\nsaid here you run away with the baby. He said take the baby, and I'm going to bring you\nmilk for the baby, and he helped me and he was standing over me and he was crying and\nhe said, \"I have children, too, and I don't know what's going to happen when the war ends\nwith my children.\" They were afraid for themselves, too. So, this passed by and they\nstarted moving us again, to a Ghetto.",
        "A: Yes. We had to have camp cards, like a passport, that we are working and we are\nregistered to work, because if you're not registered, you didn't get bread. So, you had to\nbe registered, and we used to go all out to work.",
        "A: That was all in our town.",
        "A: All of them, old and young.",
        "A: Anything. One worked and cleaned houses. I worked as a helper there, you know. They\nasked me if I know how to make manicure and I said, I don't know. He said try, and I\nmade for the SS men's manicure and I was afraid that if I'm going to hurt them, they're\ngoing to kill me, but they were nice SS people, really. They weren't the military. They\nwere private. They were like engineers, but they belonged to the party, but they didn't\nknow the cruelty yet.",
        "A: In the beginning in our town, they used to make us work in getting used that all of us\nhave to work if you want food. They didn't give us much. The Russians were very small.\nThey gave us bread and the bread tastes like raw, because they didn't bake them like they\nwere supposed to be, but we had something. Then, we worked there until about -- they\nmade , that was in 1941. My daughter died by the time, and they came and\nthey took my daughter in something away. I didn't even know where she was buried or\nwhat they did with her. Nobody knew what happened to the dead people. They used to\ncome every morning and collect the dead from the Ghetto and take them. We didn't know\nwhere they took them.",
        "A: The Ghetto was formed from almost the beginning. It wasn't like a real in Warsaw Ghetto\nbecause that was the beginnings. They were just putting us together to have us in one\nplace you see, not in the whole town, to be everywhere that they couldn't find us. So, they\nkept us. It was togetherness like. They kept us in one place and they knew where to look\nfor us.",
        "A: Very. You know, like you have a house and they put you in two rooms, a whole family.\nMy mother with my father and all three of my sisters, the beginning, and my brother. We\nwere in one room later. So, it was terrible, but you're still -- we were allowed to take our\nclothes, not much, but a little, but not the furniture. Nothing like this. It's Just personal\nthings they let us take and you know, little by little they take away our freedom and\neverything. We couldn't get out. The Ghetto was from this place to this place. We\ncouldn't go to the other side of the Ghetto by ourselves. We had to have a German or a\ndressed in a German uniform, but they were . They spoke\nPolish but they were from some place in the border of Germany and Poland, so they\nspoke both languages. They had to bring us to work. We couldn't go by ourselves. We\nmet one nice and his name was Philip. I don't know the last name. He used\nto help us. He used to put when they say he used to come and say they are going to make\na raid today, you know, like they're going to kill a lot of people. They are going to raid\nthe Ghetto, and so he said let me take you all go into the ditches, you know where the\npotatoes are high. So, he put us in the ditches and he said I'm going to watch and I'm\ngoing to see where they are and I'm going to tell you when to come out. So, the Germans\nwere very smart and very clever, and they used to go around and looking for people like\nthis. They knew that everybody is trying to stay alive. So, he watched them, and he used\nto show us quietly don't get up. Just stay there, and he was like a means\nhe was the watcher, a watch guard for them, but he helped us. He helped us a lot in the\nbeginning. They had a little more freedom to do that, the , and the\nGermans. They weren't so bad. But, they were bad enough because we weren't used to a\nlife like this. But, you know from the worst they were the better ones. So, they moved us\nagain, and I moved out from my mother to a different place. They gave me a little room\nin a building, in the same building my aunt lived downstairs with my cousin and her\nhusband and child and another guy, another family lived next door and they made an\n. Do you know what that is? They told us to go to the market place and they\nwere cleaning up the place, so we all went to the marketplace, but the contribution of\npeople, so many they can put into the trains, that they had enough. They did the amount\nof people, it was over, so they sent some people back. Then when we came back home, it\nwas the middle of the night and we couldn't go because they were shooting everybody on\nthe streets, whoever they saw. So, we went into a building that we didn't even know who\nlived there, and we heard somebody crying and it was an old lady, maybe 100 years old\nin the bed crying that she doesn't have food, and that she doesn't know where her family\nis and we told her to be quiet because they are going to shoot us all. I was with my little\nbaby at that time, yet still, and I was breast feeding her and I didn't have anything in my\nbreast how to feed her. We kept the baby quiet and my cousin was with me with her boy.\nHe was six years old and my cousin's husband. Then the middle of the night, it was too\ndark, maybe 4 o'clock in the morning, we were going back quietly and we saw blood all\nover the streets. It was like a war field with people who I knew were on the streets all\nover, and we saw a German on a horse. He was Gestapo or SS officer, a very high rank\nofficer and he said \"What happened?\" It was quiet already, just, you know, once in a\nwhile we heard a shot someplace. So, he asked us what happened here and we said, \"We\ndon't know. They killed us all.\" And he said, \"Tell your people -- I never knew who he\nwas -- \"Tell your people that I am ashamed of our race.\" And he was a high rank German.\nHe told us tell the people so we went home and we said so what can\nyou say. We went back home so we had to lock the gate and my cousin went to the next\ndoor neighbor for the gate -- locking the gate, it was a big like a piece of iron, you know\nto put an iron on the gate. In the meantime, he went in there and he called us all and he\nsaid, \"Come in, come in, you're going to see something.\" Fourteen people were shot\nthrough the head. All of them. My two aunts. One aunt was standing. She was looking\nsomething in the drawer and she opened the drawer and she was with her head looking\ninto the drawer and she was shot, I suppose in the back of her head and the drawer was\nfull of her blood. One of my aunts was sitting on the floor in the corner, with her tongue\nout, shot to death. That was my cousin's mother. My mother's brother's wife, and so it\nwas a full house of dead people, fourteen people. All of a sudden I hear somebody calling\nmy name, and one girl was moaning because they shot her in an eye. They said she's too\npretty to shoot her so they just shoot her eye out, which she died a while later, but the\nwoman who came out from under the bed, they were all standing or sitting or just so the\nwoman was my neighbor and she came out from under the bed dripping in blood, and she\nsaid, I run the first under the bed and they couldn't see me. They just shot the next person\nwho was after me. I said, \"Come out\" my cousin said, \"Come out. You're going to be\nwith us.\" She said, \"No, I'm afraid they're going to kill me.\" And she went back under the\nbed. Finally, you know, we persuade her to come out and we said go and wash yourself.\nLook how you look. She was soaking in blood. So, that was then my mother knew what\nwas someplace else and she sent the maid and she said to Anera (ph), she said go and see\nwhat's with my daughter. She came to the window and it was I had a candle on because\nwe were afraid to put the lights on and so she said she came back to my mother and she\nsaid I think in Ruzia's apartment there's a little candle so she must be there. So, my father\ncame with a blanket and he came for me and when he saw me he fainted because I looked\nlike -- he couldn't recognize me because we went through hell all night. It was not a\nnight, it was a hell. What we saw, and that's always in my mind. I never told my children\nanything about those things, and my father took me home to my mother. He took me\nhome and my mother said you're not going anyplace. You're staying with us until they\nmove us further. That was the place for you to stay with us. So, then I said no I'm going\nto go home tomorrow. Soon after my baby died, because I didn't give her milk. I gave her\nwater. I didn't have anything to give her, and so we --",
        "A: Constantly, constantly, night and day you hear shooting and screaming and running. It\nwas not a day or not a minute without fear, without that horror, not fear, horror. It was\nunbelievable.",
        "A: All the time, all the time. Then you know, after that you're still a few months in that\nGhetto, and I used to go to work, and I had nice friends, and I had a teacher who and his\nname was Mr. Khun (ph), and you come to me, and I'm going to feed you and I'm going\nto give you something to wear, you know things you need. I want to help. So, I used to go\nthere and they used to prepare for me a package of food of something to bring home, and\nbut you know the Polish people most of them it was a lot of nice people who saved a lot\nof people who are trying to save, and they saved a lot. But it was many for a pound of\nsugar, they sold your soul. So, they worked for the Germans, and one time I said to that\nPhilip, he used to come and he used to take me to visit my friends. Like I used to have a\nfriend, my brother's friend, and she used to tell me how about coming to dinner and I said\n-- she's a , you have full Germans, and she said, I'm going to tell her you're\nmy sister and nobody is going to know so that was the truth. But in the meantime, we\nwere making Gentile papers for ourselves to live through the war if we decided to run\naway before it's too late. So, we were working on the papers. It cost a lot of money too\nmake Gentile papers.",
        "A: It was a lot of Polish people who did those things, who put the German stamps, like it\nlooked real and everything. They gave me a name, Bernice Slabovuchko, that I should\nlive on this name, and my brother and my father put money down for camp cards like\npassports like Gentiles and they put money down and they waited. They said it's going to\ntake and they gave them pictures and everythings, it's going to take a little while and\nyou're going to get your papers. So, and I had papers from a church and I had those\npapers but you're going to work every day and all of a sudden one morning they came in\nand they said it's everything , they didn't let us go to work and it's\n, you know they clean out and we all have to go out of town.",
        "A: That was by the end of 1941.",
        "A: Yes, but then I came back and it was '41, because they took the whole town together and\nwe marched, children, old and young, whatever was left, we marched to a little town\n. was never there in my life and we marched 21 kilometers with my\nsister at that time had a boy and he was eight years already and the little girl was two\nyears old. She had a girl. So, when they told us to march, so we had a woman who\nwashed our clothes for us and so she said send Sanrush (ph) to me and he said \"No\nMommy, I will not go. I'm going with you.\" And he said, \"I don't want to be shot like all\nthe children on the street, because when you're not going to be here she's going to throw\nme out and we're going to wind up dead on the street.\" So, he went and he walked 21\nkilometers, an eight year old boy.",
        "A: Yes, my mother, my father, my brother, my one sister, because one was already gone. So,\nwe walked and I helped carry my sister's little girl. And he was walking, my nephew,\nalone by himself and he was so proud you see I am walking by myself, all by myself.\nAnd he walked the whole 21 kilometers. They brought us to a little town. It was a dirty\nlittle town with -- it wasn't even a town. It was a village like and there was no place to go\nand no place to live. We found a room someplace. We went in with a family. I don't\nknow who that was. In the same day, a German, an SS man, but I worked for him, he was\n-- | worked in an logger, that means a camp and we were\ngoing there for there for the day and working and coming home and you know. So, I\nworked all the time for him. So, he came and he used to call me Pauline, not Rose. So, he\ncame to the town and he was standing on a truck and he said where is Pauline. He called\nfor me, and my brother came into the house and he said I think Walter -- his name Walter\nRobert, my brother says, I think he's looking for you because he called your name. And I\nsaid, \"I don't want to go.\" And I want to go all together. We're going to go all together all\nof us. So, my mother said, \"No, you go,\" and she put on I don't know whose coat, my\nbrother's coat on me. It was cold already. I don't know what month it was, it was like fall.\nShe put that coat and she said you're going to keep warm. You go back. Maybe by you're\ngoing back to work for Robert, you can save us, and we're going to start hiding ourselves\nin here by the time maybe you can help us. So, I didn't want to go and I cried. I said,\n\"Mother, I don't want to go.\" He said, \"you go.\" My brother took me there and he said,\n\"You go with Robert,\" and he was standing on the truck and the other side of the cane, he\nalways had a cane to hit somebody, so he pulled my neck to him and he said, \"You come\nhere,\" and he took me on the truck and he said, \"You're going back, because they needed\n75 people back to our town to clean up the town. My brother and my father and my\nmother and my sister and the children stayed in that little town. So, my brother started\ngoing for those cards, for the passport. So, the Pollack who made that passport saw that\nthe Germans are you know the bosses and he said -- and my brother paid him 3,000\nslotas, that means like $3,000, and that time it was a lot of money. So, he said, you better\nget out of here. I don't have papers for you and I'm not going to make them. I have the\nmoney and you go out, and if you're not going to get out, I'm going to call the Gestapo.\nSo, my brother ran away. He ran away and he came down, and by that time, my mother\nand sister and children were hidden in a hole underground. They found them there, I don't\nknow, because I wasn't there anymore, because they took me back to my town. They\nfound them there and where their remains are if they were cremated or they were shot, if\nthey were shot whatever happened to them, I don't know, but my father in the morning he\nused to like to go to the forest. So, my father went to the forest, and he said I'm going to\nbe back. So, he was walking around in the forest and after a while he came out. He didn't\nknow that that they are killing all the people. They are taking them away\nand screaming and everything. He came out and a few Germans on horses they were\n, because they spoke to him in Polish and they said to him, you SOB,\nrun back because they are going to kill you with all the Jews around, and my father was a\nJew, and my father had no choice. He ran back to the forest, and walking in the forest he\nwas walking and crying and he met somebody was in the forest, a girl. She came to my\nfather and said she's a Gentile and she said please don't kill me please don't kill me, so\nmy father said don't worry, what's your name and she said Tricia. I'm from Warsaw. He\nsaid I'm not going to kill you. I am not to kill you, I'm in the same boat like you are, and\nI'm going to save you as much as I can. He did. He said I'm a Jew like you are and we're\ngoing to hide out together, and when he came out nobody was around anymore. All of\nthem are gone and I by the time I was in in our town in the camp, working\nand my father was one of the workers, a Pollack, came to the gate and said he wants to\nsee me and I run to gate and I said what happened. He said, your mother was killed. Your\nsister was killed and the children were killed -- no, he said your father is alive and your\nbrother is alive and I said where are the others why don't you tell me. They are all killed,\nI didn't want to tell you this. I said I am going there anyway to bring my brother and my\nfather. I went in a wagon hidden with straw and I hid in the straw and they brought me\nbecause they had to go and see I don't know what the Germans were looking there for and\nI said I'm going, and they hid me there. I went and my father and brother and my brother-\nin-law were there. So, I brought them back. I don't know how, but I brought my brother-\nin-law and father back and my brother said I am going to wait maybe still he is going to\ngive me the papers and he waited. A few days later my brother came to the gate and he\nfainted by the gate where I worked but nobody could take anybody in. It was not allowed.\nSo, I don't know how but I took him in quietly and I hid him there. So, her mother,\nBessie's mother was someplace around too, and by the gates and she couldn't go in --",
        "A: Yes, her mother, and I took them in there because that SS guy, I went to him and I said\n\"Please take him in, please.\" And he said, \"I can't, I can't. I'm not allowed. They're going\nto kill me too.\" I said, please and he said okay, hide them in the toilet and I'm going to do\nsomething about it. And he did. So, I got my father and my brother already there and her\nmother and another girl from our town. She was sitting hidden in the toilet for two weeks,\nand whoever came in I said, please don't throw her out. Let her sit there. She was so\nscared and she was shaking and I took him and then my brother went to work to clean up\nthe clothes by the clothes they worked. By the cemetery they made a big barracks and\nthey put all the clothes from all the town and they had to sort out the good ones and the\nbad ones and put them in bundles and they were sending them to Germany.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: So my brother came and he didn't have the papers. They told him that they are going to\nannounce him to the Gestapo. So, he walked out. He came to our town and he was\nworking in the city. He went to work and he met a friend of his. I think he was in the\nArmy with him together, my brother.",
        "A: In the Polish Army. So, because my brother was the oldest brother in the family and so he\nwas born in 1910 so he was not a child and so he was after the Army and he met the guy\nand he said to my brother why are you miserable what's wrong what happened to you.\nAre you hurt? Are you hungry? And he said no, I can't get my gentile papers because\nthey took away my money and my father's paper is Kochonoski, and I want -- no and my\nfather doesn't have the papers really, and I want him to be my father and I am his son and\nwe Polish officers are going to run away. And he says, okay, take my camp card. He took\noff his picture and he gave it to my brother. He said, \"I am going to report that in three\nmonths that I lost it. By that time you make yourself other papers.\" So, he gave him the\npapers that he is Kochonoski, and he made my father his father and they left. They went\nto Lemberg, to as Gentiles. I took my father the night before when they had\nto leave. I took him to his friend, and I said Mr. Bishak to my brother's friend, keep my\nfather here one night because they are leaving tomorrow. And he said, \"I can't, because\nmy wife is anti-semitic and she's going to give him out. I can't do that. I would love to,\nand I'm afraid of her.\" But I was wearing a Moses on my neck and he said, \"Child, give\nme that Moses and I'm going to keep it for you, if you're going to live, I'm going to give it\nback.\" I still have it. \"I'm going to give it back to you, and I'm going to put a new cross\nand Maria,\" and I said fine. So, I gave him that Moses and I had to take my father away\nfrom there. I kept him. I took him to another place, to a lady, Nanina (ph) and I said you\nkeep him and she said I will and she kept him overnight. In the morning they left to\nLemberg, and they said you don't come until we're going to send for you, no matter what.\nYou shouldn't move from here and I said fine. So, they left. I was already in the camp in\nit was , no Jews. We were just cleaning up the place, we were\ncleaning up.",
        "A: Oh, it started with about 75 and it wind up over 1,000.",
        "A: Men and women, yes. So, Bessie's mother was there with her brother and a cousin and we\ngot very friendly there. She was a very lovely girl, always smiling and it was a pleasure\nto be with her in her company and I really fell in love with her like a friend. I said I'm\ngoing to help you with this and whatever because I worked in the kitchen there in the\ncamp. I was peeling potatoes, a potato peeler. Then I got sick of Typhus there and that\nRobert who took me back he told a soldier that he should bring me every day water there\nand keep me -- I was in a little coop like, and you have to keep give her water and make a\nlittle fire to keep her warm and she is going to be okay. We didn't have any medication\nnothing and so I got I was crazy. It went into your head. After I came out of the sickness I\nwas nuts. I didn't want to do anything in the kitchen. I didn't want to peel potatoes and he\ncame in, that Robert, with and he said if you're not going to do what I -- not because he\nwas mad at me, but he wanted me to wake up. He said, I'm going to beat the hell out of\nyou but you have to work if you want to live. And I was so scared of him that I started\ndoing it. So, then I got better with nothing. We didn't have even an aspirin, nothing, just\nwater. When you're young, you get through a lot. So, I make the story short and the\ncamp and one night it was late in '41 I had a dream there that my mother I\nwant to run away. No, I had a dream that my mother is by the door and I said, \"Mother,\nwhat kind of mother are you. I want to run away and you're keeping me here.\" And she\nsaid, \"Over my dead body.\" I'm never going to forget that dream. It was real, I saw her\nthere on the floor and she said you're not going to run away because over my dead body\nbecause they're going to shoot you outside and all of sudden we hear screams outside\n\"Arouse, Arouse\" that was about 4 o'clock in the morning. Arouse, so the Germans the\nGestapo came, we worked for the SS but then the Gestapo came at 4 o'clock in the\nmorning, and the Gestapo were over the SS, so they said all out and they start you know\nputting us in lines and the outside people start running and they were all shot outside. My\nmother told not to run, and they took us away. But, before that, there was a guy an\nengineer with a wife, I told you they even brought me from Germany presents, a raincoat\nand a rain hat, and a parasol and they said they are going to adopt me and send me to\nGermany, but it was so sudden that the SS didn't know what the Gestapo was cooking for\nus and they came to the gate and they were standing in the gate and he saw me going out\nof the gate and he started crying and he said just like this. He showed that he couldn't do\nanything, and they took us on big trucks and we didn't know where we were going. They\nshoot a lot of people in the camp there before we left because they were starting to run\nand they shoot a lady that I knew by my door and her brain was by the door. Nothing you\ncan do about it. You saw the brain, you saw that person, pieces, but we had to march out.\nThey put us in the trucks and they filled up, I don't know how many people in one truck,\nthe rest they took to the Rotunda, you know, it was a Rotunda and they shot them all.\nWhat they felt they're not good to work anymore, so they shot and us they took and they\nwere going, driving us and we didn't know where. Are we going to , going to\nto be killed or --.",
        "A: We didn't hear about them, we knew in the camp, we knew it exists. We knew it goes\naround or they said we went by already , that means they are not taking us there.\nThey are taking us someplace else. We thought to jump, the trucks, but we really -- one\nsaid let's jump, let's go, and one said no don't, they're going to kill us. So, we were in\nGod's hands.",
        "A: No, we knew they are going to kill us. We are going to death, because we weren't\ndressed. I was in my nightgown. We weren't even dressed, with a coat on top. We didn't\nknow really where we were going, but when we passed those death places we knew that\nthey are -- it's death camps, just ovens, not even camps, just straight to the crematory. So,\nwe went by it and we said, no we're going someplace else. So, you know, we lived with\nhope that maybe we're going to live. They brought us into Maidanek. After a long, long\ndrive they brought us into Maidanek, and they told us to undress and to take a shower.\nThey put us into cold showers and they took away everything. They gave us old junk to\nput on us, and they took away all our jewelry but you see before we left we were smarter,\nwe put all the jewelry in the toilet. We had packs. We were sitting on it so we put\neverything there. We said let's not give anything to them. But I forgot that I had long hair\nand I forgot that I had my earrings with my monogram in my ears and my hair covered it,\nso it went through, but everything went and we were naked. The men, they took separate\nand they undressed the men naked and they left them only the strap in the hands and they\ntold them to hold the strap in their hands and they let German Shepherds after them. And\nyou know, when you have something in the hand and the German Shepherds went wild\nand they were biting out pieces of meat of the people. This was the beginning of\nMaidanek.",
        "A: We were watching. The women were separate, but the men were running. We were\nnaked, we didn't have straps. Men had pants with straps so they had the straps and the\nGerman Shepherds tore them apart. So, we went into the camp. They took us in camp.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They looked like prisoners with an L on the back, the striped clothes with on the\nback. that means concentration camp. That was a concentration camp,\nMaidanek.",
        "A: I don't remember months, just like I remember barely in the beginning I did remember.",
        "A: No, yes, we went in '42 to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Before that, we were about eight months in that camp.",
        "A: In Maidanek, about six months maybe. I don't remember exactly but so we went into that\nMaidanek and they took us in. They dressed us in clothes and they took us in. We\nmarched in. The women separate. The men separate. I don't know how many blocks it\nwas, about five all together I guess and we had about one block that were men and the\nmen had the rest. They had kitchens in the men's place but not by us. By us we only did\nwork and when we came from work they used to put us -- we worked like not\nmelioration, we put grass in the -- the men were bringing us the water. They were the\nhorses and the wagons, and they pulled the wagons with water and they gave us buckets\nof water and we watered the grass there. That was the job in Maidanek.",
        "A: All the time. That was my job.",
        "A: Yes, beautifying the camp, and that's what you know my husband was there too. He paid\nhis bread -- he worked someplace else, that he wants once to go to the women's camp to\nsee me and I took off my earrings and I put them in a piece of my undershirt and I had\nthem in my shoes because the shoes didn't take away. I just cut off my heals and I was\nwalking like backwards but I had them in my shoes and when he came I took him out and\nwhen he was giving me the water I just gave him those earrings and he didn't know what\nit is and I gave him my bread because men need more bread.",
        "A: No, but I was working there and I saw him coming because he told somebody that he's\ngoing to be that day through -- like a messenger like you know one word comes to\nanother that he's going to try to see me that day. So, he didn't nobody knew.",
        "A: Yes, but only for a day, only for a minute really. I gave him those earrings and he put\nthem away because and then we worked and we went in the evenings we went to the\ncamp. Saturday and Sunday they used to put us -- the camp was with high electric wires\nand in between was so much place, very little about maybe how many inches I don't\nknow ten, twenty inches, I don't know, between the wires. They used to let us in between\nthe wires and sit there and we couldn't move because if you move one way it's electric\nand you move the other so you were sitting there one by one around the wires. This was\nour past time or we used to they used to give us a job to bring stones from one corner to\nanother, the same stone. We bring it to one corner of the camp and bring it back, go back\nand forth like you see ants working, you know. They're going back and forth.",
        "A: For nothing, just because they wanted to occupy us. We shouldn't be free. We shouldn't\nhave free time. I don't know in Polish we say , that means, sesame\nwork. It didn't take you any place and we didn't do anything, so we used to work that time\nlike this and then we went out when the food was ready. So, from the men's camp they\ncame in with the food on wagons to bring us the food. The men cooked for the whole\ncamp, so one my neighbor saw me there standing and waiting for the food and he looked\nat me and he said \"Are you hungry?\" And I said, I didn't say anything. I was afraid to say\nsomething but I just nod my head yes. So, he threw down on the floor a few green peas\nwithout the greens peas, just the shell and I picked it up. So, somebody saw it and they\ntook me into the camp and they gave me 25 on my back. They took off my clothes and I\nwas in the whole block, the whole block is like the barrack was watching. They were\nbeating me. I felt maybe three times and the rest I didn't feel anymore. So, they gave me\n25 on my bare back. I was -- there was nothing you could do about it. I had open wounds\nand the girls, her mother tried to wrote they tried to soothe me and said\n\"Don't worry.\" They dressed me slowly and they took me out to work and my girls about\nI don't know a few of them ten girls, fifteen girls they were all around me and they were\nreally taking care of me to bring me back, because they thought I was going to die. So,\nthat was in Maidanek. After that 1t was so bad that whoever wanted to run away they -- a\ngirl wanted to run away, we didn't who she was, and they found her. They brought her\nback and they put us all in an , a counting and they put us all in the middle of\nthe camp, and they put her to be hanged. They hanged her and they let her hang on a\nwindy day, very windy, and she was dinging three days and three nights and we were\nafraid to look at it. You know, to show us that that's what's going to happen to us if\nsomeone even tried to run away. So nobody tried.",
        "A: Nobody was. We couldn't. At that time we didn't have our numbers because the numbers\nthey gave us in Birkenau, in Auschwitz they gave numbers, but in any other camps we\ndidn't have any numbers. Nobody did. So, we just they told us thousand times a day that\nif you're going to run away, that's what's waiting for us. So, we were afraid. We were\nthere for about I don't know and we whisper went around that they were going to transfer\nus someplace else. We don't know where.\nin the beginning, maybe you were there a little later, they didn't even have water. It was\nhard for people --?",
        "A: It was nothing. No where was water. They let us in. They gave us ten minutes, not only in\nMaidanek, in Auschwitz too, they give us five minutes each to go into to wash, and it was\ncold water.",
        "A: No, sometimes when you went in. We didn't have toilets we went out not even an\nouthouse, under there someplace where ever we found a place. We didn't have anything.\nWe didn't have a paper so you know what I used to do to take pieces of my underwear\nand I used that until my underwear was to here but because we had to give them back one\nto get a new one. So, this was to left to give it back to get a new one. So, you see we\ndidn't have any paper. We didn't have any water. We had very little food. We had just\nbarely to live through the day, a little soup which was terrible from cabbage, rotten\ncabbage and collarabi. It was the worst thing you ever ate in your life, but when you're\nhungry you try to swallow it.",
        "A: We ate it.",
        "A: Yes, they gave us dishes and we used to put the dish in here, under and it looked like this\nand this was our dish to wash ourselves. I washed my face in it. Sometimes, I don't know\nhow to say, I went number one in that thing and we ate soup in it and the soup it wasn't\ntoo much. It was just like a cup of soup.",
        "A: With the coffee they gave us in the morning, not coffee. They were leaves, like burned\nleaves, they made brown water, so with this we washed the faces and we washed the dish\nand that's all.",
        "A: Oh, yes. It was like ten in a bed, eight in a bed, one foot. You know, we were sleeping\nlike sixes, six and nine just like this and --.",
        "A: It was supposed to be a straw mattress but it was almost nothing in it. And it was\nbedbugs, a lot of bedbugs, a lot of lice, very much a lot of lice and a lot of fleas.\nEverything you can think about was there and it was on us. They ate us alive. so instead\nof drinking that coffee I washed my body with it.",
        "A: No, if you went to the hospital, you never come out. This is it. Even if you were sick --\nwe had girls who had typhus and you were dragging them to work, not to go there\nbecause and then I'm going to come back to that Tricia. She died, who my father found\nand brought into the camp and then she'd wind up with me and all of the\ncamps too. So, all of a sudden we heard a rumor that they are going to whoever wants to\ngo for a transport can go for a transport.",
        "A: Yes, they were all killed or they, when they brought them to Auschwitz they separated\nthem and they went straight to the oven to the gas chambers.",
        "A: The kids, nothing. They were playing around. Kids, you know, but they weren't doing\nanything. It wasn't kids, little tiny like tiny kids, it was like nine years old. They told one\nlittle nine year old in Maidanek to hang his father and he did. So, this is what -- they\nbrainwashed you. They made you they didn't call us person like you know 1n German 1s\nmensch, they called the dog mensch and us they hound, hound is a dog. So, they didn't\ncall us by name. They called us by hound and their dogs were mensch, people, and we\nwere the dogs.",
        "A: No, people's behavior was like animals. When they saw food, they grabbed food from\nsomebody else. They would kill you for a little soup. It was unbelievable how people in\nour how you say it in those circumstances how they behaved. Some, when you had a little\nbit of education, intelligence you knew better you behaved a little different, but some\nwere very, very poor and common people brought in. They didn't know better. They were\nfighting for their life. They would kill for a little just soup.",
        "A: I was never aggressive. I am not a big eater, and thanks to that I was never hungry, really,\nreally hungry to go for somebody's food or to whatever I got sometimes I was trading my\nlittle soup for a little piece of bread with a little margarine and the margarine was like a\nlittle tiny square and very thin, but it gave me a little energy. So, this I was never\nageressive, never. I had later on in Birkenau friends who were aggressive and they were\ngoing to the garbage and they brought food and they wake me up and they said you have\na soup from peels from the potatoes or whatever it was in the garbage but that was later\non. In the beginning, I was quiet and satisfied with whatever I had.",
        "A: Very, they used to put the heads in those big pots of what they brought the food and\nliquid the tanks there and I said what kind of animals are they because they made us\nanimals. They made from people unbelievably animals. I think not everybody had a mind\nto control themselves and they broke you down and you couldn't control.",
        "A: They were all mean. You were afraid to talk. You were afraid to say anything. You\nweren't afraid of them like of the dogs because they didn't do anything to you, they just\nlet the dogs go.",
        "A: Germans, Germans and many, many Poles too. They made themselves that they were\n, you know. That means that they have mixed blood, half of this and half\nof that. The worst people of all were the Lithuanians. They were in black uniforms and\nthe Lithuanians were worse than any Pole or any German. They were the most daring\npeople alive.",
        "A: That was before Maidanek in everywhere they were -- we were afraid of the black\nuniforms, because we knew that they are Lithuanians. They were they wanted to be better\nfor the Fuhrer than the Germans. They were terrible people. They hated the Jews a lot.\nThey hated our guts. We were afraid more of them than anybody else.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I didn't know about it, must be, but maybe when we left they brought new people. They\nhad to replace, not very roomy places, but at least to squeeze us in. I used to like to sleep\nby the end of that piece of wood, the bed like because nobody breathed on me. I'd rather\nbreathe on the wall so I rather had the box from the wall come out on me than the\nbreathing from other people, so they didn't need much place, but I didn't see any\ntransports. Then when we heard that it's going to be transports so my husband sent me\nword from the men's camp that he is going to register for a transport, I should do it too.",
        "A: Yes, you could register or you could be killed. They gave you the choice to leave the\nplace and go to a worse one, but we didn't know if it was worse. We thought it was better.",
        "A: No. They used to be they're gassing I think at the beginning where they just took you to\nwork and they gas you there because we knew and we saw those gassing chambers but\nnot people. They didn't gas them anymore. So, then we had the right to go for a transport.\nThey knew that we not going to a resort place. They knew they were sending us to worse\nplaces and this is the way the Germans did their work and that to be to make you very\nlittle in not thinking. You know but they gave you like a little authority. You can register,\nbut they did what they wanted to do. So, we registered and they took us away and we\ndidn't know where, and so did my husband. They took him to Mauthausen and they took\nme to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Oh, I don't know, 1942, someplace.",
        "A: It was like fall, it was fall. I know it was cold but so they took us out. They marched us\nout of Maidanek and they took us to -- we marched to the train and that wasn't people\ntrain they were animal trains or coal trains or whatever and they put me in a coal train. I\nwas black when I came out of there. I looked like a black person. In Polish negroes they\ndidn't say they said black people are coming. The black people are coming because we\ncame out we were black from the coal and this is later. I just go back, they put us 1n those\nand they gave us a little bread and they didn't give us water, they gave us a little\nmargarine and a little cheese. We were in the train about four days without water. We\nbegged them for water. They didn't want to give us. Many of us died. They were jumping\nover the dead people to the window to scream out for water, please water. Nothing was\nmore important than water. They didn't give us any. So, we used to make number one and\nwe used to drink it. What could you do. Maybe people don't -- I don't know how many\nyou interview don't tell those things, but this is the truth. So, we had some water, it was\nsalty, but water. So, we came into they took us four days for a ride. I don't know if I was\nlucky or not because after the war I even say, why am I alive and the rest perished. I don't\nknow if I'm lucky. I should go with all of them, but maybe it was my luck. I don't know.\nThank God I have three children and I would have them if I wouldn't be here. So, they\ntook us there and they brought us in the middle of the night. It was very dark, very dark\nwhen they brought us in. They stopped the train and they took us out and that was already\nin Berchanau.",
        "A: A lot.",
        "A: More than that, more than that. Maybe two or three thousand people. Germans were in a\nline lined up, the Gestapo with dogs by the train and like they saw me they said go this\nway. They saw an old person this way. This way, this way, children left and right. Left\nand right, we didn't know. Who knew what means left and we went where they told us to\ngo.",
        "A: It was different. In Maidanek they took everybody who came from everyplace. This was\nthe segregation because in Auschwitz or in Birkenau they want you to still be healthy and\nable to work, and they had there later when I went to work, I saw them, but they had\nthere all working people who had still a lot of energy in them. Energy at least and the old\nand the children they put separate. It was screaming and pulling. The parents pulled the\nchildren to them and they pulled them out of them, the Germans. And they were hitting\nthe people and they were hitting the children and they were taking out the children and\nbeating and killing those children if you're not going to get into here that's what's going to\nhappen to your child. It was the middle of the night. It was awful. It was screaming. I can\nstill hear the hollerings, the screamings, the cryings. It was an old couple he was in a\nuniform with his wife. He was holding her hand and they pulled them apart. That he is a\nman. He has to go to the men and she should go with the women. Because they didn't gas\nyou with men and women together. Women separate and men separate who has to go,\nand children whatever. So, they pulled them apart and got the screaming. They took our\nchildren from our camp didn't come with toys because they didn't have the toys, but from\nthe freedom they came with toys and they took away the toys. They keep them, the kids\nand you saw the kids walking to the ovens in and the parents and all of a sudden you hear\nscreaming.",
        "A: From other places too, of course. But they separate everything and they let us in to the --\ntook us into the camp and it was still very dark when they took us into the working\ncamps. They took us in and in the front was an orchestra playing, orchestra real people\nplaying music to the march and they said left and right, left and right and left, left, left.\nThey were singing to us, and we had to march to their singing. We marched in and we\ncame in there and they looked at that part of the train of us and they saw negroes, they\nsaid black people. Because we only had the eyes showing the faces because you touched\nfrom the coal the faces all the time. We didn't know how we looked. We came in and they\nput us under showers, cold showers. They took us in and they said now you go into\nshowers. The other one went into the gas chambers they told them the showers too, but\nwe went to give us clothes. They took all our clothes away. They shaved our heads. They\nshaved us all over and they gave us clothes.",
        "A: We didn't recognize each other. When we came out and we said that's you, that's you,\nthat's Tricia and that's Rose? We didn't recognize each other. That wasn't the worst part.\nThey gave us pieces of material to cover the head because it was cold and it was very,\nvery cold at that time. They let us in to the shower, cold water and all of a sudden they\nput hot water, like hot and cold, hot and cold. It was screaming terrible because here they\nbend us and here they give us cold water, cold, freeze us. They gave us barracks to go\ninto. They gave me the 21st block. Then he came into the blocks and I came with her\nmother. We were in one block. We keep each other together. We hold.",
        "A: That's what I want to say. I and we hold hands with Hannah at that time I\ndidn't know her name but she was and I held hands with Tricia that my father\nfound, and other girls and we said we're going to stay together. We hold each other\ntogether. Don't let us part, but we couldn't help. It so happened that we went to the same\nbarrack, so we were all together and we became I and and many others,\nshe was now and we were holding hands. Before we went there to the\nblocks. They took us into tattoo us. So, we went in for tattoos. We were already clean so\nthey tattoo us. So, they took just a pen and ink and they stretched our skin and they put\nthe pen in one place and they scratch like a four, they scratch that piece and they put\nanother dot and they scratch it farther and the scratch was the whole time was scratching.\nThen they put a -- this 1s a half of a little Jewish star so some had tattoos, some had the\ntattoos here, some had here a little higher, some had that here, the pants. So, this is what\nand that was my number. They stretch our skin. They put the pen just pen and ink, they\nmade a hole and they scratched it under the skin until they have to make the four the\nother corner and they pulled it this way. That's the way you see they scratched inside and\nyou'll see in each beginning and in each corner a dot because from there on they went\nfarther. That was the number. Some had bigger numbers. This was the pen. They knew\nthat this transport came at that and that time, like in '42, they came in. So, they know\nwhen we came in. Others had different places too. Then the gave us numbers the same\nnumbers to put on the clothes. So we had the numbers here, we had the number here we\nhad the number some on the back, some you know the men had it in the back but we had\nthem only here and here because if you're going to run away this is an easy target. You\ncan find the person right away. So, that's what they did and they gave us blocks so if you\nwent into the blocks we were all numbered and we all dressed in striped clothes and we\nwent and they gave us underwear. I don't know what kind and who had it before and they\ngave us wooden shoes. Huge ones, on my foot I was a five and they gave me a man's big\nshoe so we were just walking in them and put some junk in it, like whatever we found to\nfill it out. Those were wooden shoes, wooden bottoms and material like junky material\ntops. That was our shoes and that's why the dress. When we saw each other how we\nlooked and how we dressed we laughed and we cried and we didn't know what -- we\nreally didn't know how to behave. We laughed like I was you know bald so I didn't see\nme but I saw her, the other person. So, we were all bald.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Different, much, much different. Hannah she was a very clean lady. She\nloved cleanliness and so am I and we were afraid that we were going to get like\neverybody else. They had malaria. They had typhus. They had and that\neverything together and besides everything from the dirt we had sores from the body. If\nsomebody didn't wash, they just died from that. They went to the gas chambers with\nthose sores, but Hannah, , used to wake me up in the\nmiddle of the night and she said you know what, I found a place that's called they wash\nclothes and water 1s dripping a little in the middle of the night we went out with her\nbecause we weren't allowed, but we sneaked out. I'm always forgetting I always say\nbarrack and we always sneaked out and we cleansed ourselves. Thanks to her she gave\nme the courage she said come on, come on let's go because you like to be clean and so do\nI. So, we washed ourselves with that little drop of water, we shared it. So, that was very\nimportant. It was a terrible, they gave us five minutes to go to the bathroom, and we were\nsitting around and you know, number one, it wasn't a bathroom, it was a room with holes\nand you could sit there for five minutes and they opened the water in the morning for five\nminutes you have to get to the water and wash your face and drink a little water and go to\nwork. They start counting us going out to work we had to be all together. They count us.\nThey separate us who is going where to what work to what shop and we had to march out\nby the music, no matter what. The music was waiting for us.",
        "A: People from-- they were in concentration camp and they asked them if they know how to\nplay and they gave them instruments and they told them to play. They cry and play\nbecause what else can you do.",
        "A: Less, less, it was worse. First of all they made selections every few weeks. They looked\nat you naked. You had to go through naked with your clothes on your arm and they\nlooked you through like cattle and looked at your teeth, exactly like cows like cattle,\nthey're buying cows to work. So, they looked us through from the front and from the back\nand they went around us like you know looking all over you. This was selections, called\nselections, and they selected if you were still good to work they send you straight ahead\nand if not they took you out on the side. So, you knew that this was the end. So one time\nin a selection like this, I had a friend from my town and her name was .\nI forgot her name and last night I was thinking and I said you know, I think I know the\nname, it's , and she was heavy, and I was a skinny girl and she was very,\nvery heavy and she lost a lot of weight and she said but I'm still heavier than you. You\nare bones. You see sometimes on television those thin boned people. We call them\n5a is a piece of gold, nothing else, just bones or a\nmusselman. A musselman is completely to nothing. He couldn't walk any more. That was\na musselman, and that she said to me I was going before her and she was\nbehind me and she said, you know let's change places because when they look at you\nthey are going to take you to the gas chamber and I have here on my arm a wound and\nshe said put the clothes because we should keep the clothes in our right hand, not the left\nand she said change it and you cover this because even with a little thing like this they\ntook you to the gas chambers. So, and she said I'm going to walk before you and you\nafter. They're going to look at me not you they're not going to see you. She was right. A\nfat person when you lose weight your skin hangs, and she went through and they took her\naside and they took down her number and I went through. She went to the gas chamber,\nbut she was working with us for two weeks. They took down her number and every day\nthey're going to call me now, they're going to call me today, and I said why did you do\nthat for me? You could live and I could go, and she no, I wanted to go. You're going to\nstay here and she gave me her piece of bread and she said you take care of yourself. So,\nanyway, after two weeks they called her name and she went to the gas chamber and I\nwent through like they didn't see me, like she said. And I always have her on my\nconscious that maybe she was saving me that maybe she went instead of me. I don't\nknow. I have that on my conscious many, many years. So, I come out of there and she\nwas calming me down, don't worry. I want to go, I want you to live and I wanted to go I\nhave nothing to live for. Maybe you'll find your father and your brother. Maybe you're\nstill going to have anybody to live for. So, she kissed me goodbye and she gave me the\nbread and she went. They used make a , they used to take all our clothes\nand put it, in the winter time, and like a big huge I don't know, it was like a swimming\npool with water, and they put something in it to kill the lice and all the insects. So, they\ngave you back those clothes and you had to go to work, so you put them on wet until you\nwalk out to work it as frozen on you, but this was our life. You asked me how different it\nwas. It was completely different. Then when we came into the camp, you smelled the\nflesh. You smelled burning. You walked out, you saw on the other side camps like each\nhad a name. We had Loger A, Loger B, Loger C. In one there were all gypsies. In the\nother one were children or Gentiles, not only Jews and then the third one was anybody\nwho was a little crippled had you know a hunch back or something. That's a cripple. So\nevery time he came back from work another one was gone. No more children, no more\nplaying, no more singing and they didn't like homosexuals and they killed them all too.",
        "A: Yes, all of a sudden you would see it's missing. It's not there any more. Then we saw the\nfire going. I lived closed to a crematorium. The smell was unbelievable. The screams\nwere terrible. You heard them screaming going in, not because they were afraid. They\ndidn't tell them they were going to death. They just told them that they were going to go\nfor a shower and they were going to come out. But still, when they went in, one pushed\nthe other the mother wants to go with the child, it was terrible screams.",
        "A: We knew who was burning. You know when fresh transports came from freedom -- not\nreally freedom, they were better off wherever they were like at Bergen-Belsen or in other\ncamps than Auschwitz, so they had a little flesh on them, so when the flesh was burning\nyou saw only smoke. You didn't see a fire, you know. The flames you didn't see, only\nsmoke. When we were burning, like those musselmens, like what they didn't like, you\nsaw flames. So, we knew that those are the freedom people and those are our people. We\nknew who was who, burning.",
        "A: The minute they brought you in and they send you to work and you saw before people\nwere coming in to work it was just a crematorium. Or they brought them in not a\ncrematorium made to burn but they were killing them there because we were finding\nspoons on the floor, bones, heads, we saw heads with hair to work. We saw because I\ndon't think they buried them very deep and they were buried -- you know we could see.\nWe were walking on bones and hair, on heads.",
        "A: No, they didn't have the oven finished yet, so they just killed them and they just covered\nthem with I think a very, they were not covered much and we found like spoons and forks\nand things like this. We were lucky we found those. We had something to eat with\nbecause we ate with the fingers. It was not civilization. It was, I think in the old ages,\nthey had a better civilization that we had. Germans looked us over naked like pieces of\nmeat. We didn't have our period time because they put something in your food that we\nweren't women.",
        "A: Because I worked later in the kitchen and we were putting in -- it was very bitter what we\nput in.",
        "A: I don't remember the name of it. It was like a powder and you put that powder into the\nsoup and we at that so a woman wasn't a woman and a man wasn't a man either, I\nsuppose. I don't know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Of course. We didn't have periods. We were young because how you know how we never\nbeing there we didn't think about if we're going to live. We didn't know we were going to\nlive through it. If we would live through it if we're going to be able to have children, to\nbear children. Never never in life because we didn't even have -- I was married already. I\nhad a child already. There, is I said I have a child and I had a husband and they used to\nsay I was nuts because I looked like a little girl. We were bones, no breasts, nothing.\nThey took away our dignity. They took away everything you have in life, and we didn't\ncare. We just didn't want to suffer, but we didn't care, but we did suffer because they saw\nwe used to go to work every morning. At first you used to work in the outside\ncommander. So, we used to go out in the fields. In the fields we found a row of potatoes.\nIt was a jewel. In the outside commander we were in the fields. When we found a row of\npotatoes we ate it like it is. No water, no nothing, with the dirt and everything, so and it\nwas so good that I used to say if I'm going to live ever. If I'm going to live, after a dinner\nif I'm going to have enough dinner that's going to be my desert. It was so delicious.",
        "A: In the outside commando I don't know what this is called in America. We called it\n. If you took that in your hand, your body burned. That's a reed, like a\nburning reed and from this they made soups in the kitchen, so we used to pick those. A\nwhole day with our hands. We felt that our hands were so swollen after a day, and we\nbrought that into the kitchen to cook the soups from it. Sometimes we went into the\nswamps, because it was swampy. Auschwitz was swampy and we went into the water to\nthe knees or higher and we were pulling those reeds from there and we are putting those\nreeds they gave us to fill after the day after we picked them, they gave us pieces of like\nsocks and we put them for a mattress. That's supposed to be our mattress, but those reeds\nare very sharp on the ends and they cut our hands. That didn't matter. We were bleeding.\nWe were swollen, but that was our job and we wanted to live, or you couldn't kill\nyourself. You didn't have any sources to kill yourself. How, people were running to the\nelectric wires or shot when you were running. So, and I think we were chicken. We didn't\nhave the guts to that.",
        "A: Yes. Lots of it because you didn't have the guts. You wanted to die but you didn't know\nhow and so this 1s --",
        "A: Must be. I remember why I wanted to live, because I knew that my father and brother are\nfree and maybe some day we are going to meet. And I knew that I have a lot of uncles in\nAmerica. I never knew my uncles even my father didn't remember them and they were\nliving in Cleveland Ohio and they were in American and I thought maybe the American\nArmy will come and they are going to bombard the place and some are going to get killed\nso it doesn't matter but at least somebody is going to get saved, you know be saved.\nThat's what we did in the beginning. Then they were selecting people all the time in the\nmorning where to go and they selected me to . Did you hear about and\nthey selected me and Hannah and the same to work and that was heaven.\nWe were you know inside closed in. We were segregating clothes, which ones were\ngood, which were bad or finding gold and diamonds and had to put them in boxes\nbecause they were watching you like hawks.",
        "A: From all the transports. Everybody who came in. We found, first of all we had to check\nall the seams in the dresses if there are not diamonds there. They were watching you what\nyou're doing. We had to throw the diamonds in there. We had everything put bundles\nmade big, big bundles and put them together and put them up you know in bunches and\nright away people came in and took them to a train and they were transported, the good\nones, to Germany. And the bad one we had to cut and tear into pieces. So, that's what we\ndid in ;",
        "A: Just because they were going through the lines and they were choosing faces. I think they\nliked me. I don't know.",
        "A: Very. We knew, you know we found in Jewish clothes big crosses, bibles, catholic bibles\nbecause they were already, I think they changed their religion and they thought they were\ngoing to be saved. But Hitler found the generation of Jews and some came there and an\nold lady came in and said I am not Jewish why am I here. She said my grandparents were\nJewish. I said, that's why you're here because the Germans were the most stupid Jews in\nthe world. They didn't believe. They said we're going to win. That's our Germany. Hitler's\ngoing to vanish. You see, they didn't believe. They believe our Germany\nand they really believed in them that they are not going to kill them because they are\nGermans. So, we used to when walking to work in Birkenau we're going every morning\nto Auschwitz, four kilometers to Auschwitz to , and they told us to sing,\nwhat we were singing, but I can't sing so I'm going to just talk and it's like\n, you know what that means. The shoes and the stockings are torn\nand the dresses are , that means they are in pieces and\n, that means through the underwear when you whistles the wind. So\nthey said it German . That was our song going out to work and\nit has to be left, left, left, left. This has to be everyday. And sometimes when they were\nmean, they told us to take off the shoes in the middle of the winter and walk out barefoot\nto work. That was meanness and we had to pile up the shoes by the gate. But the music\nwas playing and we were walking. If we had sick friends we were holding them up and\nwe were walking out with them.",
        "A: No. Then I worked in another place. We were building buildings. We were making\nrailroads. We were holding those heavy -- and girls didn't have the strength to hold them\nand one would let go and the other fell on the feet. It was unbearable and we had to do it.\nIf not, if you let it go, you got killed.",
        "A: Of course, beat up, killed and they'd drag him into the camp, dragging by the feet. It was\njust awful but I worked building a building and when we had the 15 minutes to get our\nsoup there was a German old man there, a very old man. At that time when I was young\nhe was in his sixties, maybe it was an old man, but he was like a manager by the\nbuildings and he couldn't talk to anybody, but I think he liked me and everyday he\nbrought me a sandwich in the morning with an egg in it. And he put it on a window and\nhe just showed me with his eyes where to take it and I took that and we shared it with the\ngirls, with Hannah and and with another girl from my town and you\nknow I shared with them a bite. Each one got a bite from me and that man brought that\nsandwich every day in the morning until I never saw him again. But that's what we were\ndoing and that was our work and our job and coming in they used to you know give us a\nlittle water and a little piece of bread and a little piece of salami some time some day and\na little margarine. I used to have sores on my body and I was afraid that I was going to\nget worse so I used to sell the margarine for a little -- we had a market between each\nother -- and I bought some ointment to put on my body. And we used to make pee --\nexcuse me I had to say it and wash our body. The salt, they didn't like the salt, the bugs,\nand we put it on the body. I did it every night. I put it on the body and many of us do the\nsame thing. That, to be insane, you didn't think about it. We had such a small brain at that\ntime. We were only thinking how we were going to make it through the day. One time we\nwent to work in the hills and I found a wild duck in the field and I took that wild duck. I\ndidn't care. I put it -- I was wearing a man's jacket like and I put it under -- and it was\nalive and I was holding with the other hand I was holding the beak of the duck and I\nbrought the duck into the camp, to Auschwitz and I sold it for a bread, a ,\nlike she was the maid of the barrack. She bought it from me because they had more bread\nand more food and she was Czechoslovakian and she bought it from me and I think they\ncooked the soup from it or I don't know what they did from it because they had the\nfacilities to do it. I had a jar of jam and a bread for us.",
        "A: No, I shared it with the girls.",
        "A: Of course. We shared it and we had a terrific dinner. We shared that because she brought\nit in so I didn't have to sneak it in, so it was 1n already so I said let's have it and we sat in\nthe back and we all ate it and we had a ball. That was one episode I could bring\nsomething in. I couldn't believe and everybody said \"How did you do it?\" I said you see,\nhunger is more than life. I kept his beak closed so that he shouldn't make noise and I had\nfull of his feces in me, but I didn't care because I had bread. That's what happened one\ntime to me and I couldn't believe. Then I had another girlfriend who lives now in\nshe lives now in Israel and she was in care of the feces. You know what we\ndid the whole night, you couldn't get out. It was closed, you couldn't get out. So, she was\nbetter off than anybody else so on the holidays like today you come and wish each other a\nhappy new year and so the girls Hannah and other girls said go to Sarah, maybe she's\ngoing to give you something to eat because I couldn't. The people who could organize. I\ncouldn't. I wasn't the pushy type or I couldn't do it so they said look you don't eat so go to\nSarah and she will give you something. You will see. She is from your town, you took\nher into the camp and she will help you for sure. I went to her and I said\nSarah I came to wish you a happy new year and she was sitting by a , big\nplates from iron, red ones, they were red and the Greeks called them ;\nand she ate in that , full of it and she had cream of wheat and sugar and I\ndon't know what. She didn't even offer me a little bit. So, I was sitting there talking to her\nand I left and I came and I cried and they said did you get something and I said she didn't\ngive me anything. So, they hated her, but to her I come later in the last episode because\nshe knew that she doesn't deserve anything. Anyway, she was very mean. She was very\nselfish. She was from the one that she was going to live, be the only one alive. So, she\ndidn't share with anybody anything.",
        "A: The Hungarian people they knew exactly when it was a holiday. And we were with the\nHungarians and they used to pray quietly. They used to say come to my bed we're going\nto pray. I didn't know how to pray. I didn't read and write Hebrew or Jewish so they were\npraying but to pray to God you can pray in any language in any place. If he is in a\nsynagogue or not church he is in every place we are, he's even here if he's there. So, we\nprayed to God and it doesn't matter where we are. That was our praying. We prayed\nquietly and we cried and we kissed each other and we wished each other a happy new\nyear. We didn't have a calendar. We did not know which day it is. We knew when\npassover is, we knew everything.",
        "A: You see, I was never religious, but there I prayed with everybody else. I thought maybe\nthat is going to help me. You reach out to anybody especially to God. I believe in God,\nbut I am not a fanatic. I believe in something higher than we are, better than we are of our\nsavior, but I am not like today, I am not going to a synagogue because I don't know how\nto pray, but I pray at home. I put on a tape of and I have it at home by\nmyself. I cry a little and I pray to God because he's there. If not for him, maybe I wouldn't\nbe here. My father after the war used to say where was he when we needed him the most,\nand I said he couldn't take care of all of us. So, that was Auschwitz.",
        "A: Not the , was Jewish, but the elders they were Germans. They were\nGermans and let me tell you that's very important one episode in Auschwitz. One day we\nwere coming back from work and was standing in the middle of the like a\nplace, a big one, and they made pole to hang somebody and everybody came in and he\nsaid halt so everybody had to stand around. We didn't know what this was for, but we\nknew something is going to happen, something bad will happen. So, we were standing all\naround and they brought in a girl. She was Czechoslovakian and her name was Molly and\nshe was working in the underground but she was working in Birkenau. She was a\n, do you know what a is? She was like a message girl and\nthey were sending her in from the front from the camp inside a messenger girl so she\nknew everything but in the meantime, she was working in the underground with another\nPolish guy and the men's camp and he was not Jewish, he was a Pollack and his name\nwas , and they were working together. They had German uniforms. She had\nthe right to go here and there, so she put on a German uniform and he a German uniform\nand they want out of Germans and they were reporting to the underground what's going\non inside. So, that went on for a few years. Somebody, always somebody will tell on you.\nSo, they denounced them and they caught her and they let her go out in a German\nuniform and they caught her outside. They wanted to see where she was going but she\nfelt something wrong and she didn't go the places where she was supposed to go and they\ncaught her in the men's because we weren't together with men. They were like -- we were\non the east side, they were on the west side. We just met them when they came to fix\nsomething in our camp or something so we weren't allowed to talk to anybody. So, she,\nthey caught her and they brought her in and they were supposed to hang her for\neverybody to see what's going to happen to those people who are working against the\nGermans. So, he was standing there and he was so happy to see that she's going to be\nhanged soon and her hands were tied in the back and somebody, we don't know who, we\nwere all standing around. The whole B, I was in Lager B and the whole B Lager was\nstanding in that appel, and we were supposed to witness what is going to happen. In the\nmeantime somebody gave her a razor to cut her and she had her hands tied and she cut\nher wrist with a razor, both of them and when she started, the blood started running and\nshe was starting to faint so they looked what happened and she was fainting, so they\nstopped the hanging and they took her they brought a cart like and they put her there and\nshe was instead she was cremated. She said long live Poland, long live the freedom, long\nlive the world without Hitler. She wasn't afraid any more. And they took her away. That's\nwhat we witnessed.",
        "A: There was one but they decided that did you hear about commander. The men\nin the commander decided to run away and tell everybody to run after them\nand they cut them and they shot them, they were shooting at them and they were pulling\nthem in. They let us watch them like by the feet. was running and they\nbrought them back to the camp. But they were running. A lot of people were running and\na lot of people there were dead. About that time about 200 people died, maybe. I don't\nknow the exact number, but a lot of people and we saw that. Because they said today\nyou're going to run, word of mouth, mouth to mouth, we knew what's going to happen. If\nI was chicken I wouldn't run, but somebody didn't. They said that's our chance where to\nrun. They were all over. So, they tried. They burned them all. They beat them up first and\nthen they burned them.",
        "A: No. That was to let me tell about Tricia. I'm going to the hospital. That Tricia who my\nfather saved she was very lazy and she said I'm going to go to the , that's the\nhospital. The Germans called it ;",
        "A: Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes. I'm going to go there and I'm going to live better than you and I'm going to have\nmore food, and I'm going to tell them that I'm sick. So, she went there. She was there a\nlong time. I used to go to her and I used to say get out of here. They're going to take the\nwhole . They're going to burn you. They are going to kill you here and she\nsaid no, no I have it good I am like a nurse and like this and some people came into the\ncamp pregnant. They wanted you to be pregnant. They used to take out the children.\nThey killed the mother and they made the children they were guinea pigs. So, she was\nhelping there and one day Tricia was killed. They took her out. I was never there. I said I\nwill never go there because when you say you're sick, you're certain 99 percent you wind\nup in the gas chambers.",
        "A: I wasn't there and I can't give you any information. I know they were taking out the open\nstomach the mother or they let her have the baby and she suffered and then they killed\nher and they brought her to the gas chambers and on the kids they were the guinea pigs.",
        "A: Not I. They say, now I learn a lot from other people, but that wasn't in our camp. Not, I\ndidn't experience things like this. I knew that the Germans talking to us was a\n. How could they do something like this. I know it was because other\npeople lived that through. They were in whore houses. I didn't know about it. I knew it\nwas a ;",
        "A: I didn't see. I saw lesbians. I hear lesbians doing it and we didn't know what lesbian 1s. I\nsaid, what are they doing there? So, they said, don't you know? They make love, and I\nsaid, what love? I don't know a woman with a woman and they said they are lesbians. So,\nbecause there were a lot of Germans too. But they were Czechoslovakian and they lived\non top of me and I hear them.",
        "A: Yes, in the same bunk. So, but I didn't have any experience. I didn't see. I knew that they\ndid some. I don't know how, but I knew what I knew I had two girls, two Marishas, from\nWarsaw and I know that they were prostitutes and they were doing things with the\nGermans there, too, but I didn't see it.",
        "A: About two years.",
        "A: Next we went with the transport to .",
        "A: They asked you, you want to go someplace else, so you have to sign in. So, I said yes. I\nwant a change. It's terrible. It can't be worse. So, we went they took us and so they said so\nyou're going to go on a transport. We waited about two weeks or so and we went for a\ntransport and they took us to ,",
        "A: Yes, all of us, like Hannah and the others, a lot of them. Some went to the gas chambers.\nOne said I'm going I can't take it anymore. So, whoever was alive went with me because\nwe kept together all Hannah and others you know. Hannah was with me close to the end\nof her life, so that's why she is the closest to me and I talk about her because she was like\nmy sister.",
        "A: I have no idea. It was a few blocks. They filled up a few blocks and they kept us naked\nfor about three or four weeks. I don't even know how long they kept us there because\npeople used to come to our windows from there and they used to see in one girl came,\nwho she was my brother's friend and she looked at me and she thought I am my other\nsister, , and she said are you , and I said who are you and she said\nit's Sophie Biaz. She was Polish. She wasn't Jewish, she was catholic and she was a\nguinea pig there because she was taken from our town. We didn't know where she\nvanished to the Gestapo and she was working with her husband in the underground. So,\nshe came to the window and she saw me and she started crying like a baby. She brought\nme a piece of bread into the window and she said do you know what happened to me?\nShe was very tall and very she had very gorgeous legs, she said you know what I don't\nhave my cartlidges by my bones and I can only walk five or ten minutes most and my\nfeet, I don't have any feeling in my legs so she was a guinea pig there. She helped me\nthere a little and they kept us there and they fed us there naked and we were on the beds\ndoing nothing and just you know kidding around and not knowing even what's going to\nbring tomorrow. We didn't know. Are we going to stay here, nobody knows.",
        "A: No, nothing. They took our clothes because they didn't want to watch us all the time to\nwalk around to get mingled with others. We were locked in and no clothes so that's okay.\nWe had a blanket you know like one blanket of eight and that's okay. We had a little\nsomething to cover ourselves and we were walking around naked. So, it didn't bother us\nbecause we were all women and we didn't have anything to hide. We didn't have anything\nperiod.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: We didn't have windows. They knew -- the Pollacks or wherever we went through knew\nthat there were people in them. Because some through a little hole put a hand out,\nscreamed out, but nobody saw. We didn't see anybody. We had to see somebody through\na little hole. But nobody come close to us.",
        "A: No, we didn't work there. We were just waiting for a transport to a place where to go. So,\nthe front was coming closer and closer and they had transport people closer to Germany.\nSo, that's why we wind up 120 miles from Germany, from Berlin. That was\nwe didn't know about who knew so all of a sudden they come in. They\nopened our blocks and they said you're going to a transport. Now, they gave us the\nclothes, the bundles and they told us to dress and we're going. We marched out from\nthere. Again, we went in to train. Everything was a train. Not people train, but car trains.\nSo, they put us there. They gave us a little bread and there we go. They gave us a piece of\nbread.",
        "A: To I don't know. From Maidanek to Auschwitz it was four days. A long\ntime, a long, long time. Here 1t wasn't short, maybe two days. I'm not sure. But when we\ncame there and they opened the gates for us and we were the first ones, nobody was\nthere. It was quiet. We said, \"My God we came to heaven. Now we are in heaven.\" So,\nthat was about a thousand of us, maybe a little more, the first transport.",
        "A: Yes that was the end of '44 because I was there until about April 25 or something the\nmiddle of April and then they took us out. The Germans were still around because we\nwere an exchange for soldiers. So, when we came in there we were so happy. We are in a\nnew place and we know each other and a girl knew that I made manicure for the Germans\nso she asked the , a German woman, a very, very SS woman, a terrible\nperson, and she asked the girls who knows how to make her manicure and she said I\nknow how to make her and she knows how to make manicure and she said okay, I need\nonly her. So, she took me after a few days we were there. And she said you're going to\nwork in the kitchen and you're going to be at my disposition any time I need you. And I\nsaid, fine. So what else can you do. She had a boyfriend there, a Gestapo man, and she\nwanted to look nice, good to him and be you know combed nice and she said to the other\ngirl, okay, you can comb my hair but I'm going to take her. And she didn't like it and she\nsaid do you know how to comb my hair and I was scared to death. If I'm going to do\nwrong, she's going to kill me. And I said, how, just wet waves, like waves, and I said I'm\ngoing to try, maybe I don't know but I can try. And she said try it. She gave me a comb\nand I made it nice with a fingers, I made the waves. I don't know how. Fear teaches you\neverything. From fear you know everything. There's not a thing that you don't know. So,\nI start making her hair and she said I'm going to show my boyfriend my hair. She's going\nto show if he likes it and he said it's wunderbar, it's wunderbar so that's all, so I became\nher private beautician and manicurist, but she said to me you are going to work in the\nkitchen, that means we didn't peel potatoes, we were only that was a machine that it was\nlike scraping the potatoes with the dirt and everything. In the beginning I didn't work in\nthe kitchen so my girlfriend Hannah, no another girlfriend used to make pancakes, no\npotato pancakes threw them in a little oven there and with the sand and the dirt and\neverything just like baking them and we were supposed to swallow them because you\ncouldn't chew them. It was in the teeth, it was an awful feeling so we were swallowing\nthem to fill the stomach. So, she cooked a little soup and she brought me up to eat a little\nsoup, but when I was in the kitchen so Hannah wasn't there yet. They took from -- no\nHannah was there. We all were there. Going out to Sweden she wasn't there. So, then\nother girls start coming into from Auschwitz, from\nwherever they took them, because Auschwitz was in Poland and the Russians came very\nclose to there so they had to evacuate very fast. So the evacuation came very fast and\nthey brought them 1n bunches to . So, Hannah came with the next\ntransport with me and other girls and that Sarah Goldberg what I tell you she was there\ntoo, and I worked already in the kitchen. After a while she prepared me she didn't want\nme to be by the potatoes. She wanted me to be a cook to have nice hands to hold her\nhands and I said I couldn't believe it I was in a kitchen and I saw food. And so when the\ntransport a few weeks later a new transport came and I came out of the kitchen with a\nwhite, I was wearing a white uniform in the kitchen because that kitchen cooked for the\nGermans too. So they picked me in the day time they took me in the dining room where\nthe Germans ate to be a waitress. It was very nice. So, I had to wear a white uniform. So,\nI came out when a new transport came in and I looked who was there and I saw who is\nfrom our girls who 1s from the camp and said Ruzia\nit's me and so I said it's good to see you and we hugged and I said who\nis with you and she said Sarah is with me and others. They are all with me and another\nRushka is with me an I said okay. That Sarah thought I was a nurse so she didn't even\ncome close to me, but when she hears that I'm in the kitchen and they said what are you\ndoing here, what are you doing here, I said I am in the kitchen. I am working as a cook.\nSo she wants to be my friend but I had ten girls. We are together. We came all together\nand I said to Hannah, Bessie's mother, I said you are going to be the\nsupervisor of the food. You're going to feed all ten girls that left after that terrible,\nterrible what happened to us and you know terrible deal that happened to us and we are\nalive and I will help you. So, she said fine. I said put them together, tell me how many are\nthere and I somehow I was going to steal the food from the kitchen and I am going to\nfeed you. In the meantime I was transferred to block one, because there whoever worked\nfor the Germans had to be clean and that was the first block was for the clean people.\nAnd there I found a woman and a little boy. He was nine years old. She was a doctor and\nthe husband was a doctor, but the husband was killed already. And that boy's name was\n, and he was with the parents with the mother because they were\ndoctors.",
        "A: They were from Lemberg, but they were in that camp when they put me in that barrack,\nin that you know, barrack, they were there.",
        "A: They were Jews from Poland from and that boy, I felt that I found my\nnephew and I adopted that boy and I said I'm going to help him with anything I can. That\nboy was so skinny so I said all right I will bring you sugar whatever I can and for him it\nwas a special deal. The others used to come with buckets under the windows in the\nmiddle of the night and I used to give the food out until they found out. But before they\nfound out I used to give it through the back. But for him I used to bring the food in my\npanties. You know, the panties have something to hold you here, I don't know what it\nwas, it wasn't a band like to tie so I put there from the Germans I stole like cream of\nwheat cooked, warm and a little sugar and a little margarine and I used to a piece of\nsalami and I used to bring for . His mother had a sweater and she taught him\nhow to needle -- how to crochet and he crochet for me from his mother's sweater a pair of\ngloves not to be cold because it was winter time and when I came in he was sick that\ntime. Something was wrong with him and he said I have something for you from the\nback, and he gave me mittens, you know. I lost them, I don't have them and that name\nnever, never went out of my mind. I remember exactly his name after 50 years ago. So, I\ndon't know what happened, but I helped them and the girls. I used to tell them to come to\nthe back window because you see we had was built for only a thousand\nwhat is it's like you cut them and put them in the war time\nin jail, prisoners. It was made for 1,000 French prisoners and they brought in 5,000 so the\nkitchen was going 24 hours a day. We cooked the whole night and the first dinner was\n9:00 in the morning for food and then it was 12:00 and then it was about 3:00, 4:00 in the\nafternoon and then you slept a little. You know when I cooked in the morning or in the\nnight, I slept in the daytime a little. So, it was three shifts to cook the food and so when I\nworked nights, I used to say you come over and I'll give you through the window I'm\ngoing to give you a bucket of food and you saw Hannah, , she sent every\ntime another girl under the window.",
        "A: Movement you had but you had to go, you worked there but I didn't but the other girls\nthey made they worked out underground and they had factories hidden in the woods like\nand they were making ammunition and the girls went out to work ammunition. But you\nsee it was 24 hours who was in the daytime they could sleep, inside you could walk\naround but when you had to go out to work you worked by the ammunition. I was never\nthere.",
        "A: Much better, but it was very small. It was very crowded. It was people were beaten to\ndeath. You know, it wasn't honey. It wasn't a resort, it was a camp, but that was the best\none from all of them, so because it was really in Germany, so the German ladies, the SS\nwomen who worked in the kitchens and they worked with us. They were our superiors\nand some were very bitchy, very bad.",
        "A: Oh yes, but it didn't matter. You see, it really didn't, I was afraid and I was not afraid\nbecause to save a life it was worth it. To save ten lives it was more worth it. So, I used to\nin the day time when I didn't cook I had to be occupied so they had permissions from the\nwho I made the hair every day I put up her hair and sometimes every\nsecond day a manicure. I was scared to death but I did it. Then I got so much that I know\nnow how to make them. I was so good to make those waves with my fingers with a little\nwater, that's all, and she dried them in the sun. I had permission to go that she get\npermission to the other German SS women who watched us, the watch dogs that I can go\nsometimes to them if they need me. So, she had a list of ten or something that she's going\nto send me there today or tomorrow. And I had one to tell me wash the floors and to\nmake the hair and to wash her toilet and that's okay. That was fine enough. One I had she\nwas a very mean , very mean, but somehow she liked me and when I came\nshe said don't do anything. I don't need you for nothing. Just come down and lie down\nnear me and tell me your story or tell me how you came here and we talked and she told\nme her story how she became a German and she was young and she had a baby and she\ntold me her story. Then I had another one she used to tell me let's go shopping. And she\ntook me shopping with her. She took me in her jeep and I should carry her bags.",
        "A: A little town, but the little town, but the butcher knew that I was Jewish. He said you\nthere, out. So he wouldn't let me in, and she said okay you stay outside. I come out and\nthen we go back, and she used to sit and talk to me and she used to give me something to\neat. She always prepared something good for me. Then in the kitchen worked one,\nbecause you see those German women, those SS women they weren't really trained by\nthe SS. They were short of people, of women, so they took them out from the factories.\nThey were factory women. They gave them a little. They taught them a little what has to\nbe done, a course how to get through it and they put them in a uniform and they put them\ninto those camps like, little camps. So, in the kitchen was an angel and we\ncalled her angel. When I wanted to take something out for that boy I said\n, and she said she didn't want to see it. She\ndidn't want to know about it. So, I took out things. One time I took out a salami, big like\nmy hand, I don't know how. It was bigger than my hand, and I put in a big salami like this\nin my arm until here and I smuggled that salami out and they were the happiest people in\nthe world. I smuggled out a whole salami and if they would catch me there they told me\ndon't do that. If they're going to catch you they're going to kill you in the place, but I did\nit. But you see the winter time was very bad because when they came through the back\nwindow for the food they saw foot prints in the snow that every night somebody is there.\nThe snow falls in the day time, at night you have more foot prints. Then they found\nsomething out that something's going out and they were watching. Who is going to the\nback, but you know somebody nice told the girls that somebody knows that somebody 1s\ngoing to pick up the food at night. It was -- they found foot steps by the door, so we had\nto change all the whole plan. We changed it and I said okay from now on don't go there\njust come to the front and whenever I'm going to see that nobody is looking I'm going to\ngive you fast and you just run, and that's the way they were picking up the food, through\nthe front. We didn't care, they would shoot us all because they would find out who is\neating this food, but we didn't care. In the meantime, they really had a ball. They ate. This\nwas going on for quite a while.",
        "A: Of course we couldn't have it. We just helped, but you know sometimes you just got like\na little doggie bag, bug they knew how many steaks they have. They knew exactly what\nthey have. To us they used to bring the killed horses from the front and the horse meat\nwas smelly and terrible and we cooked the soups from it. We put meat, but we had meat.\nCan you imagine what we had, we had meat and if somebody found a little piece, like a\nlittle square of meat they said I have meat in my soup but we the only thing that we could\ndo, you know the bones they cooked over and over and over because the bone has the\nmarrow inside so we had to cut the bones and cook the soup so we took out the marrow\nand we put them in a casserole underneath. We took the potatoes what has to go to the\nsoup, we stole potatoes and we put that in a casserole and we put that in the oven where it\nwas burning and we made ourselves a delicious dish. We put that dish in the toilet and\nevery time somebody else went in to have a little and that was very fat and that filled you\nup right away because it really was fat, the marrow was so fat but that was delicious. I\nwouldn't eat it now, but at that time it was delicious. This and then sometimes when they\ntook me to waitress and most of the days I used to finish when my cooking. You should\nhave seen what was cooking, just lousy food. Everything was just the leaves of the\ncabbage was the leaves what the Germans didn't eat. They were rotten. Everything was\nrotten that came into our soup, but it was okay. It was soup. You know what, we used to\nput the margarine, they were like in bricks. I think each brick was two pounds or one\npound and they used to count in each huge like for the military they had to go in ten\nbricks of margarine so we used to pick them in. That's a terrible thing to say, we used to\nput that in and they made the mark, you know, it's fat around, and we used to take out the\nmargarine to feed the girls. Everybody had somebody, so we used to take it out. We used\nto eat good there in the kitchen, but some we left, but a few we took out, but the mark\nwas they come, they count, that was ten.",
        "A: In I was there about nine months.",
        "A: Yes, and then from one day the German came into the kitchen because I\nhelped the Germans that was just poor Germans they didn't have enough\nfood that time either and they weren't bad. They were good to us. They used to bring us\nthe news of the day, where the Germans are and where the Russians are and I think the\nwar is ending 1s because they weren't real soldiers either. They took them out from\nfactories. They used to give us the news for the day, where they are and they said, you\nknow what, I think they are making an exchange of prisoners of war for you and I think\nyou are going to leave soon here and the woman the in the kitchen she\nsaid are you going to let them kill me. I said no not you. You are our angel but she knew I\nwasn't waiting until then and she was really nice not to kill and she said I know the\nGermans I know we are all going to get killed. One day when they were talking about it\nsoon somebody I think American are coming to save you to give you freedom. The Red\nCross because made a deal to the Germans that they are going to get one of us\nfor a 100 of German soldiers and prisoners. So, they made a deal and they took blocks of\nus but when the Americans come in to us and we were really afraid. We were afraid of\neverybody. They said, don't worry. We are American. We came to free you.",
        "A: They were in uniforms. They were in the Red Cross. The trucks were Red Cross trucks,\nbut they were in uniforms and they said you have they couldn't talk to everybody but\nwhen they took us out they made the arrangements in the office and everything and they\nsaid ten barracks are going out of here. So, they put us in and the rest on the other side.\n, was on the other side crying and she said I just missed by one block and\nshe left there and I went out with another Rose and another few girls and we went out and\nthe Americans said now you can scream you can throw stones on them, you are outside\nthe wall and you are in our trucks and they gave us , packages with chocolate.\nCan you imagine with chocolate, with all kinds of goodies and they said now we are\ngoing to take you to the freedom. We take you to Denmark. So, we were happy. Can you\nimagine we cried we left our friends and then the Russian came in there and they were\nraping the girls and I don't know what. My Hannah wasn't raped but they were doing all\nthings like you wouldn't believe that they came to free you and they are such ugly people,\nthose Russians.",
        "A: Yes, and that was in the middle because I think I was two weeks or more in Sweden, the\n8th of May was the end of war, but I was already out of there. That was something in\nApril.",
        "A: Denmark first. But going to Denmark that's not so easy. In the Red Cross on the top of\nthe trucks they had written big Red Cross. When the airplanes fly around you they know\nit's a Red Cross truck but they knew who is there and they went so close to our trucks and\nthey with machine guns they were just shooting all around us and on us and they killed\none truck 40 people completely. There were 40 in a truck and then Americans before they\nsaw they were on top of us they stopped the trucks and said run into the ditches. You run\nwherever you can and we started running. So, we went in, it was someplace a house like\na farmer's house, a farmer lived there and we run into the house and they threw us out and\nthey say now that the Germans didn't know what's happening. And they said you\nand they didn't let us in. So, we had to hide in the ditches, and the\nAmerican soldiers were so good to us. They put they hands under our feet to put us up.\nThey knew what horrible life we had. They and we didn't understand English, but they\nwere showing us you know that you're free, you're free, but he said you're still not free,\nand they said to go to the ditches and to run and to hide. They, it's going to get a little\ndarker. They are going to take us through the woods into Denmark and we were walking\na whole night because they couldn't see anything so they couldn't shoot us. And we were\nwalking, a lot of us, into Denmark. When we came to Denmark, the people in Denmark\nwere So nice.",
        "A: Not to Denmark, to Sweden. It's a lot of Germans living in Denmark too. They are not all\nDanish. They are a lot Germans. So, the first thing when they took us in they start\npreparing us and they used to say please don't talk about the Germans. We have a lot of\nspies in here and you are not still free, remember. They warned us and they gave us food\nand they said don't eat too much because it's not good for you. You should eat slowly and\nnot too much because you're going to get sick. So, we were in Denmark about three\nweeks. Then the Denmark people, it was a rainy day when we were leaving to Sweden\nand they were standing with bouquet of flowers and they were hugging us and they were\nwishing us the best and we didn't understand them but the German they spoke to us and\nthey hugged us and they kissed us and they wished us luck and the best and not to eat too\nmuch and nothing to be careful. And they gave us bouquets of flowers.",
        "A: We were living not in a camp, it was like you know maybe barracks like before but they\nput us all up in a circle in some houses just like shacks and they kept us there and they\ngave us very good food. They put us all together by tables and they fed us and they\nwatched us not to eat too much. They said no, no don't eat too much.",
        "A: Yes, this was with the Red Cross, the Danish and Swedish. The whole of Red Cross\nbecause the Americans were watching us there, too. They were with us.",
        "A: No, they took us in trains and they brought us to we had to go through the water by boat.\nThey brought us to the boats and we now in the boat we were free. We could talk because\nin Denmark still they were warning us please we want you not to talk about it and we\nwant you to live through it. We don't want you to be killed in here. Then, in the boat\nabout 24 hours we had to go across the water and so we came to to\nSweden, and there they were beautiful white clean not mattresses, but like with straw,\nthose things, with beautiful white sheets that we didn't see for so many years. Then, it\nwas written something in , 1t was too much to eat I supposes it's for\nand , and I said we came again to Germans they\nare talking about and that's forbidden. But we read it in German and it's\n. So they gave us really the red carpet and they took us to a beautiful,\nbeautiful department store and they dressed us from A-Z, from the bottom to the top,\neverything new, even a girdle, bras, everything and a coat, a beautiful brown coat I had\nand boots.",
        "A: No, they took us to a . They took us in different places. Some went to\ndifferent cities. They took me and another girls to , and they put us in\nthe quarantine. For about three months we had to be there because people used to get sick\nand a lot of them died, a lot. So, we used to be in a quarantine and every Sunday people\nfrom the city learned about it and they came to we were in with big fences but people\nwent through the fences and they talk and they ask us questions and they speak very well\nEnglish and German, so one couple came to the and they saw me and they\nsaid we were surrounded around three ways with water. It was a lake, and you could\nswim but naked. The boys find out that these girls are swimming naked so they came to\nsee us naked there and so a couple came, a young couple, she was in the forties maybe\nforty and she looked and she said would you like to be free and go out from the\nquarantine, and I said of course I would. So, she said I can make you a passport and you\ncan get out. I am going to be your foster mother and we can adopt you so she did. They\ndid. First of all I have still a picture in that bathing suit. She brought me a bathing suit the\nnext Sunday they came. She brought me a bathing suit and she told me you don't have to\nshow anybody what you have. You're going to be in a bathing suit. And they made a\nroom for me and they took me to their place. He was an engineer and she was working in\nan office and they adopted me until I found -- I wrote letters to Europe and I found that\nmy father and brother are alive.",
        "A: My husband, too. He came later, but I found them alive through I wrote letters I\nremember my friend's addresses and I wrote to one guy who went with me to school and\nhe said to me that day that I got your letter was the happiest day of my life. You were\nalive. He said he saw my father and brother alive in my town at a soccer game and they\nlived some place near the ocean, and I wrote a lot of letters. So, my mother's girlfriend\nsent me a letter and he said you read that letter and drink water because you have\nsomebody alive waiting for you. So, that's the way I left Sweden after a year and a half\nand I came to and I was living with them and then my private life came.",
        "A: How do I think with my brain or with my health -- I came out pretty good. My health\nwasn't good, but it wasn't bad either. I am not a cranky person. I have an outlook of life\nwhatever happens, happens, and I am not a hyperchondriac. I am never sick. I am sitting\nhere today and my back is killing me because I came with a bad -- I was 1n bed for a\nweek before I came here to Washington and I brought with me a corset but today I am\nnot wearing it and I have pills and soon I'm going to take a pill to go home because I'm\nnot going to be able to move, but otherwise I came out -- I'm very sharp. They didn't take\naway my brain. They didn't take away my will to live. It was a pleasure and the happiest\ntime when I met my father and my father didn't want to be a Jew after the war. He was in\na church and I said no you are a Jew and he said no I can't. I said yes you will, and you're\ngoing to change your name to your old name, and he did. Then we went to Israel and\nfrom Israel I said you have to change your name to your Jewish name. You're a Luft and\nyou're going to be Luft, not Kochonoski, and he said where was he when we needed him.\nI said he was there, he's now here with us. So, and that's the way I brought my brother. I\nwas in Israel a year and a half and I had a child in Israel.",
        "A: Yes, with my husband, I was reunited in . He found us. Then in Poland I\nhad a child, two children, one in and one in ,\nGermany. I had one son in Israel and he's now 41. He is in the wine business. I have three\ngood sons and three grandchildren and I live for them now. I worked hard my life. I\ndivorced my husband in 1966 and I sent my son and I married the second one and that\nwas Warner and I was and my children are , and I helped my\nson go to chiropractic school and he is a chiropractor. I worked twelve hours a day, but I\nmade it and I after this Warner I want to be alone and I decided that this is my life, my\nchildren, my grandchildren and that's about it. I am glad to be alive and I hope it never\nhappens again, never again, like we say. I have a lot of poems written in Polish I told you\nand in German and I'm going to send that to Bessie and you can translate those things and\nmake it to something because they are real life stories. That's not just fantasy.",
        "A: I and other girls together when we were together in Sweden.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I want to say that I am very proud of my children, and I love them dearly, and thank God\nI am alive for them and I had them. My brother is in Montreal still. My father is buried in\nMontreal. He died in 1966 and he had a stroke and he died, and he 1s buried in Montreal.\nI am happy to be alive, and I am grateful for everything in life that I'm here and I thank\nyou very much for taping this for my children's memory.\nEnd of Tape #4\nConclusion of Interview\n"
