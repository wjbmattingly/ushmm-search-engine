        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview -- oh boy, what is\nthis? United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis interview is conducted by Regina Baier on February 9, 2001, in Springfield,\nNew Jersey. This is tape number one, side A. Okay, my first question is, would you\ntell us your name?",
        "Answer: My name now is Norman Salsitz, but this is not the original name. So if you\nask me from before, I was born as Naftali Saleschutz. And the Saleschutz is a very\nlong name for America, so we changed it to Salsitz. But during the war I had a few\nother names, in the way for each -- for each time. During the war my name first was\nTadeusz Jadach, a Polish name, then it was Tadeusz Zaleski, and then also it was\nAnatoli Sherbakovy, which is a Russian name. Then it was also Lazarus Spillman, it\nwas a German name. And when I came to America, we change it to Salsitz, and I\u2019m\nstill Salsitz, and I hope it will be Salsitz til I die.",
        "Q: That was very short and nice --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but now I have to ask you, of course, a little [indecipherable]",
        "A: So that later you will edit this.",
        "Q: Yes, I will edit everything.",
        "A: Yeah.\n2\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: And I just want to ask you, say a little bit more about who were you, or what -- why\nwere you Tadeusz Zaleski --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- at one point. Who were you, and those different names.",
        "A: Yeah, now when I was born Naftali Saleschutz, of course they had to give me a\nname when I was born. I had a lot of names, not orig -- not names, legally names,\npeople called me all kind of names because I was not an angel when I was small. My\nfamily called me different, my friends called me different. During the war, when I\nescaped from the camp and I started -- I escaped to the woods, I had to -- I got false --\nit\u2019s -- oh, actually, it was not false, it was a real birth certificate from a monsignor and\nhe gave me the name -- I picked out the name because the -- the name belonged to a\nfriend of mine who went with me to school, and dur -- 1939 he was in the army, he\nwas killed. And I picked out his name because he s -- he -- we looked very much alike,\nlike we would be brothers. And his name was Tadeusz Jadach. It\u2019s a very good\nPolish name. So I asked the monsignor, so he gave me his birth certificate and I started\nto masquerade when I was in the underground in the woods, as Tadeusz Jadach.\nThen, during this time, I also belonged to a Russian group, a Russian partisan groups\nfor a short time. So there I got the other document in my name as Naftali in Russia, su\n-- supposed to be Anatoli, it\u2019s changed. So I liked Anatoli, so I got a paper as\n3February 9, 2001\nSherbakov, which is a real Russian name, so I became Anatoli Sherbakov. Then,\nwhen I d -- was liberated, and I joined the Polish army, and the Polish army didn\u2019t\nwant me to have the same name as I had in the underground, as Tadeusz Jadach,\nbecause there was all political mis -- they didn\u2019t believe in the same ideology, so I\nchanged the name to Tadeusz Zaleski, it should be similar to my original name\nSaleschutz, so it became Zaleski. It could be Saleschutz but spelled different like in\nPolish, because the real Saleschutz was spelled like a German name. But then people\nwere afraid that it -- my superiors, that it will have a connection with my name from\nbefore, so they said let\u2019s have a new name, so Tadeusz was okay, it\u2019s a good Polish\nname, so I became Tadeusz Zaleski. Then later when I was in the -- in the Polish\narmy, I was in the intelligence, and I had special -- you -- in a special unit, so for a\ncertain time I had to be -- to have a German name, because we had to interduce -- to\nin -- interrogate German officers, but there is a long story in my book about it, so I had\na friend, his name was Lazarus Spillman, so I made out documents that I am Lazarus\nSpillman. And when I came to America -- so I came -- I got back to my real name,\nNaftali Saleschutz, but for America the Saleschutz was too long. People don\u2019t have\ntime to spell, everybody ask how do you spell it. So because I had a brother in\nAmerica and his name was Salsitz, so I change it to Salsitz. And Naftali they thought\nis a too Jewish name, so I became Norman, which I\u2019m sorry til today because I like\n4February 9, 2001\nNaftali much better than Norman, and this is how I remain. So do -- this is -- this is\nmy name.",
        "Q: This is your many names.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, I want to skip certain things. So-So-Some -- some things that we don\u2019t talk\nabout will be summarized in the middle of narration. But I would like you to talk about\n-- about Krakow. Why did you go to Krakow, when did you go, and what position\ndid you have? I want to talk about the whole Krakow scene [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. Whe -- when I went into the Polish army after I was liberated -- I was\nliberated in the beginning of August 1944, and I right away wanted to go to the army\nbecause I figured if I survived the war, I have to fight the Germans, and this was my\naim, because my father\u2019s last words was, Nakuma, nakuma, nakuma. It means\nrevenge, revenge, revenge, take revenge. I figured how can I take revenge? I have to\nbe in the army in a special unit. And then I was sent to a -- from a -- in --in -- the\ngovernment was in Lublin, the Polish government, temporary government, because\nWarsaw was not liberated, and then later I was sent from Lublin to Szeszow, because\nSzeszow was a bigger town near my town, Kolbuszowa, and I know Szeszow -- I\nknew Szeszow and I knew the surrounding and I knew the people there. So I was in\nthis time -- we call it informatsia voickowa, which means -- this was the political unit\n5February 9, 2001\nin the army. It was -- so a -- when then -- the 12\" of January, 1945, was the left -- the\nless [indecipherable] towards Berlin, towards the -- take over Germany, because in\nSzeszow, when I was liberated, the front stopped, the front stopped in August. And for\nsix months nothing happened, they stayed in one place, and they made all the\npreparations for the final push. The January the 12\" the war started -- I mean, the\n[indecipherable] started towards the west, and this was actually the last\n[indecipherable] til the war was ended. Now I was picked out -- in this time they\npicked out a group f-fo -- of hundred young, mostly officers, and we were assigned to\ngo with the Russian front. As the Russian front went, we went right with them, and\nfrom the hundred, soon as a town was liberated, some of us remained in the town to\nestablish a Polish presence, and to start to organize -- organize security, and -- and\ncivil offices. So each town had some people left, two or three. I was assigned to do the\nsame thing, but til we will re -- reach Krakow. When we reach Krakow -- so from the\nhundred remained maybe 50 or 60, and we came into Krakow, and I was assigned to\nthe same units, which was the military -- the military intelligence, but my si -- my par -\n- there were a lot of sections. People had the section with the clergy, people had the\nsection with the civil organization. I -- my section was that I had to do with Germans\nwho lived in Poland, or who remained in Poland, or Polish people who collaborated\nwith the Germans -- and they changed during the occupation, they made out papers\n6February 9, 2001\nthat they are ethnic Germans. And because I spoke German, so I was attached to this\nunit, and also we had a lot of German prisoners of war, so I interrogated them, and this\nis how I became the head of the county f -- of Krakow for this reason, for this\npurposes.",
        "Q: I will summarize the story of how you met your wife, because it is a long one --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and we have only 15 minutes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But I would like to talk about afterwards, so what -- so when -- once you had taken\ncare of the columns, that was disconnected, the -- Krak\u00e9w was saved, what were the\nother jobs? You had a lot of work to do. What was basically ho -- what did you work,\nand -- and what was the situation in Krakow, and what did you do?",
        "A: Well, Krak\u00e9w was -- luckily Krakow was not touched. It was not destroyed y --\nlike other towns. Like Warsaw for instance, was 90 percent destroyed. Krakow was\nnot destroyed and this is in the book with this -- it had to be destroyed because the\nGermans prepared for a destruction, and they prepared 287 colu -- places where --\nwere mined, and the 287 I remember distinctly because this was our main em -- th --\nmain thing to eliminate those things. So Krakow wasn\u2019t destroyed, but our -- our da --\nduty, what we had to do the first thing, we had to clin -- to get rid of the people who\n7\nFebruary 9, 2001\ncollaborated with the Germans. Mostly Germans they left, the army left, but there were\nsome who remained. But the people who collaborated, now they were Polish people,\nbut during the German occupation they made out papers, and they find ways that their\ngrandfather was from Germany, or great grandfather was a colonist. And e --\nsometimes even if 1t was not true. They wanted to do it, why? Because doing this they\nbecame ethnic Germans, and the German gave them bigger ration cards, they could get\na nicer apartment and they could get a good job. Even the Polish people who were sent\naway to concentration camps, and they were -- didn\u2019t have the rice, they had more rice,\nand they were the elite during the German occupation. Now, as the Germans left, those\npeople tried to be back Poles, because actually they were Poles, they were traitors. So\nnaturally our aim was to find out, to interrogate them, and to find them. If they came\nfrom different towns, if they started having new papers. So mostly this was our aim,\nand this was also for the security of the government not to have enemies in our place.\nSo this was the main things that we had to have. Then I got an -- a special job. This\nwas -- now we occupied Krakow, officially occupation was the 19\" of January, 1945.\nThis was official date. I was two days before in Krakow, but this was the official date\nwhen Krakow was occupied do -- by the Russian army. And -- and the only Polish\nunit was our unit that we came in and that we were the -- the first who were in\nKrakow, and the people looked up to us that we are the liberators. In beginning, or 1-1-\n8\nFebruary 9, 2001\nin th -- in beginning of February, a group came from England, and this was the --\norganization to study the crimes of the Germans. And the head of this group was\nHewlett Johns -- Johnson. He was the Dean of Canterbury from England. He was a\narchbishop and he was the head. And he had in his group mostly professors from\ndifferent universities, from countries who were not a g -- who -- who didn\u2019t work with\nthe Germans. Like in Europe a lot of countries collaborated, and they had armies like\nHungary, Romania. Those were professors from places that they were always against\nthe Germans, or the Germans were occupying their countries. We had professors from\nRussia, from England, from -- from Argentina, from all over the world. And I was\nassigned that I was to prepare -- I had to prepare every day\u2019s activity for this group\nwhere to go. We went to all concentration camps, to -- like for instance, in Auschwitz,\nwe were in Auschwitz maybe two weeks after Auschwitz was liberated. Everything\nwas fresh. The de -- the destruction of the crematoriums, they we -- still were hot from\n-- from -- from fire. The clothing of the people that they were -- were killed, and they\nwere still, the blood was still soft, because it wasn\u2019t dry up. And then th-the -- the\nwarehouses from children\u2019s shoes, and eyeglasses, and [indecipherable] and all those\nthing. This was just in the beginning. And we found in Auschwitz also, about 20 to\nthir -- 25,000 people who couldn\u2019t be sent out with the death marches like they did\nbefore the Russians occupied. So I went with this group for about four, five weeks.\n9\nFebruary 9, 2001\nEvery day we -- the headquarters were in Krakow in the hotel, and my job was to\nprepare the itinerary for the next day. Where to go, how to go, to have the cars and the\ntransportation for the group. And because I spoke a little English, so they picked me\nout and I was the one that I explained to the man who was in charge of transportation\nfrom the Dean of Canterbury, and with him, too, and I brought them over to all those\nplaces. During the times that we went to the concentration camps, there was a other\naim, was the Polish government wanted, is to show them how the people are very\nhappy with the communists who came in. Now this, everything was staged, nothing\nwas the truth. Th -- th -- the -- Hewlett Johnson, the archbishop later had a nickname,\nthe Red Dean, because everything -- he was very much pro-Russia. When he went, for\ninstance to Korea in this -- later, and always he went to investigate, but he always was\npro-Russia. So what my -- my job was to -- to stage -- like, for instance, we went to a\nplace, to a concentration camp. On the spo -- on the way, when we saw there a group\nof Polish peasants, and they were dressed in the Polish traditional clothing, which 1 --\nthis was all staged. So I said to him, \u201cWell, let\u2019s find out, let\u2019s stop and find out from\nthe people what they think about the new regime.\u201d Because they started to take away\nland from the landowners, and gave them away to the peasants. So we stopped, and I\nasked them in Polish, and it was translated. Now those were not peasants that we met\nocca -- special we met. Those were people who were told to be on this spot, dressed\n10\nFebruary 9, 2001\nlike peasants and they had all kind of m -- pitchforks and other things what peasants\nuse. And I said to him, oh there are peasants, it\u2019s good to find out. Now, they were\nprepared, those were people who were from the government. Tho -- there were -- who\nbelonged to the communist eg -- organizations. And they were prepared what they will\nbe asked, and what they should a -- was -- wa -- should answer. And naturally all of\nthem said how happy they are, that before the war they were discriminated, the\npeasants. And now they come in and the government is so good for the peasants. And\nthey took away from the very rich people, who never took care on their fields, and they\ndivided, they gave. And she -- they praised -- they praised there the [indecipherable].\nAnd this was everything -- naturally they made the film, and they made pictures, and\nthis was later shown in -- in newsreels, how the Polish population, the peasants are\nvery, very happy with it. But this -- everything was staged.",
        "Q: I want to ask you just one more question about Krakow. You also were involved to\nsome degree in -- in food and relief efforts, right, because [indecipherable] people\nwere coming back",
        "A: Yeah, I was -- not officially. Officially I couldn\u2019t be ra -- 1-involved because the\nfirst thing, I was not a Jew. I -- in this time I was not -- Tadeusz Zaleski, a Polish\nCatholic. And the second thing, our job was not to -- to give food to the people, to help\npeople. Our job was to find out collaborators and other things, but through my future\n11\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwife, because I started to bring her food right the next day when I met her, because\nthere -- there was no -- you couldn\u2019t buy food, and people didn\u2019t have food. So I use --\nand we had everything, because in the army we had everything, so I use -- I took my\nadjutant or some, and I used to send to her every day, bread and salami and butter and\nother things. Now, when the people who came out from hiding -- you didn\u2019t have yet\npeople from concentration camps, because it took a few weeks til they started to come\nin. But people came out from hiding, they were hungry, and they were -- they were in\nhiding for -- for two years, for y -- year and a half. They find out that there 1s a --\nsomebody who survived and he is Jewish and he has food. So they started to come to\nher and asked her for -- for -- for food, and she was glad to give it to them. Now, as\nshe gave them the food, naturally, she notified me. I didn\u2019t see her so often in the\nbeginning. She notified me she needs more, she needs more, and I n -- not officially,\nsent her all kind, and she just -- and she gave it away. Also, I gave her a lot of clothing.\nAs we took over a lot of apartments, where Germans left, or people who were\ncollaborators were arrested, we confiscated their apartments, and we had all the things\nfrom their apartments, so I could give it to her, and she used to distribute to the people\nwho came ba -- with their -- with their concentration clothing -- they didn\u2019t -- it was\nwinter, because this was in January, February, it was very cold. So I gave it to her and\nI was very happy and the people find out, and wa -- once somebody find out, there\n12\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwere more and more and more, [indecipherable] I gave it her, she gave it -- she give it\n-- give it away, and I was very happy I could do it, unofficially. Then later I also find\nout that there was a woman, and there 1s a film made about it. They called it, \u201cMy\nHundred Children.\u201d And this woman collected children who were left for -- fo --\nafter fa -- they were hidden, and also a lot of Polish people who took in the children to\nhide, and they were promised money after the war, and then later they find out that the\nparents are killed, nobody came back, so they abandoned the children. And the\nchildren didn\u2019t have where to go. So the Jewish co -- committee started to collect those\nchildren, there was one woman special, and she is in -- in the book th -- what they\nwrote, \u201cMy Hundred Children.\u201d She collected chil -- she lost all her family, so she\ncollected those children and brought them into the Jewish committee, and they were on\n-- they had that [indecipherable], but she didn\u2019t had wa -- what -- how to feed them.\nSo she find out about me, because when I came to Krakow, and I went right away to\ntwo leaders of Krakow, one was -- his name was -- he was involved with the Jewish\ncommittee, he was a lawyer before the war, his name was Stulbackt. And then it was\na rabbi who survived the war, not from Krakow, but he kra -- remained, and he was in\nKrakow, and he was like the official rabbi. His name was Steinberg. So I came to\nthem and I told them, \u201cListen, I am a Jew. Nobody knows that I am a Jew, but I want\nyou should know. Any time you have a problem, and I am in the government, and I\n13\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhave a big position. If you need something, please tell me, not official, and I will do\nwhat I can do.\u201d In this what I -- they always came to me and the brought me problems,\nand -- and I have -- and now -- in -- in my new books that I writing now, \u201cTreasure of\nJewish Memories,\u201d I\u2019m describing those episodes fr -- from the -- what a -- for --\nfrom this time. So when -- when I find out that the children are there, they didn\u2019t have\nwhat to wear, they didn\u2019t have what to eat, so I sco -- I-I couldn\u2019t give them money,\nand I -- so we had a lot of sugar. And because sugar the Germans th -- had the sugar in\nwarehouses and we took it over. So I told this woman, I cannot give you money, but if\nyou have a truck -- I cannot deliver it -- you can come and pick out and I can give you\nas much sugar as you want, and later you sell the sugar. So this way they could support\nthemselves. Then later they needed some clothing. And we took away from Germany\ntwo large warehouses, because the Germans had warehouses for underwear, shirts and\nother things, for the Germans, because everything was on ration cards. Now the Poles\ndidn\u2019t get anything, but the Germans got -- oh, and those were I find out where the\nwarehouses are, because when the germ -- before the Germans left, they put all this\nmaterial in two houses in basements. They were big basements because this was a\nwhole [indecipherable] and I find out about it. So we went and we confiscated\neverything. So I had a lot of this material. I remember there were children\u2019s socks, and\nchildren\u2019s underwear, and everything what -- so -- so I brought -- every time I came\n14\nFebruary 9, 2001\nover to them, so I brought a trunk full of those things and I gave it to them. Now, they\nknew that I am Jewish, those few people, but the rest, they didn\u2019t know. And when I\ntook it out from the warehouses, the people who work with me, they didn\u2019t know why\nI take it away. Maybe they thought maybe I take it and I sell it on black market or\nsomething. But I gave it away all to my girlfriend, or to the Jewish committee.",
        "Q: When you think about the time today, you were very busy -- about that time in\nKrakow -- you were very busy, you had a lot of work. Was that special for you, that\ntime of fo -- and if so, for what reason?",
        "A: I think this was the best time of my -- there were two times that there were the best\ntimes of my life. And I think this was the best time. One time was the best time when I\n-- like for instance, when I was in the woods, naturally we starved, it was cold, and it\nwas terrible fear. But if we could do something -- there was one time that we made a\nraid of -- o-on -- we made a raid, there was a -- a sop -- police station from Puskov,\nfrom the SS, and we made the raid, and we killed them, all of them, so I think this was\nthe happiest day in my life. As a matter of fact in my book there, somebody wrote, and\nin th -- in -- and what I explained to him it 1s -- it was like when I had the machine gun\nin my hand, it\u2019s like a lame who couldn\u2019t walk, and suddenly he -- he -- he was able to\nwalk. To me, that I was not any more the victim, that I wasn\u2019t any more the pe -- the\nperson who was killed, that I could pay back. And this was my life why I wanted to\n15\nFebruary 9, 2001\nlive. To take revenge, which I did as much as possible. In Krakow, it was a other,\nnaturally we couldn\u2019t go out, we couldn\u2019t kill people any more, it was after the war.\nBut for me to see that the people, the Jewish came ba -- the Jews came back, they had\nnothing, they di -- and even the Polish government was not very, very friendly with\nthem, because individual -- maybe the government as a whole was not anti-Semitic,\nbecause in this time it was a communist government, but each individual policeman,\neach individual clerk, everything, he had this hate in his heart as again the same thing,\nthey didn\u2019t change. Now, if I could do something, I was very happy. People that I\ndidn\u2019t know, they find out -- they find out that -- that they could do -- through me they\nwent to this rabbi, and if I could help them I was very happy. And also, also, if they\nneeded apartments, and there was every apartment, usually there was a -- a office\nwhere they gave out the apartments. Now, if a Jew came for an apartment and even he\nlived before in Krakow, they wouldn\u2019t give it to him because the people were very,\nvery against Jews. And they said, \u201cWell, why did you come back?\u201d And they looked at\nthat Jew -- and now I\u2019m writing a new book about the killings after the war, so the title\nof the book is what they used to say in the title 1s, you are still alive? I -- and the\nsubtitle is, I thought they killed all of you. This was the first question -- the first that a\nPole ask a Jew when he survived. But when -- when -- when they went to this rabbi\nand the rabbi knew that he could be helped through me, I did it. Now this was a very,\n16February 9, 2001\nvery rewarding thing for me. Because if I started a thing, we were killed, and nobody\ndid anything. And this time we were undress -- I\u2019m not talking I personally, but the\nJews, and we were undr -- dress over a -- a -- a ditch, and we were killed. Now if e-\neach one of them would think, if I would live and if I could pay them back, everybody\nwill do it. Now, after the war, people didn\u2019t do it. The war is ended, and everybody\nwas interested to have a bread, to make a living, and to save his family if he had a\nfamily. But for me, I survived for two reasons --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- for me, I survived for two reasons. And this, to -- to survive, you had to have a\nlegacy, you had to have a reason. Th-This gave you strength, otherwise you couldn\u2019t\nsurvive. And I had two. One was when my father was killed, he yelled to take revenge,\nand | -- it is now 55 - 60 years later, I still hear his si -- his screams. This was one that\ngave me strength. I have to live, because I was the youngest, and I was the only one to\npay back, pay back for my five sisters, pay back for my -- the sister\u2019s husbands, pay\nback for my nieces and nephews. Who would pay back? So this mean that they were\nkilled, and nothing will happen to the people who did it. So this was one legacy that it\ngave me strength. To take back the second one was when my mother was taken away\nto Belzec with my five sisters to be killed in Belzec, she somehow gave to somebry --\n17\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbody a letter, and I got the letter from this person. I was in [indecipherable] and she\nwrote to me, you are my ninth child, you are the youngest. You are young, you are\nstrong, you are smart. If somebody will survive, you will survive. Because she\nbelieves that somebody will survive. She said, \u201cAfter the war, go to your brother,\u201d\nbecause I had a brother in Palestine, \u201cgo to y -- Palestine, go to your brother,\u201d I had a\nbrother in America, \u201cand tell the whole world what the German murderers did to us.\u201d\nSo this is the reasons that after the war, I started to tell, even in the beginning people\ndidn\u2019t want to listen. But I spoke, and they thought I have an obsession, some people\ndidn\u2019t like it. Later, 20 years later, st -- people started to realize, and they listened.\nBooks came out, movies came out. But I started to speak the first minute I left Poland,\nand I told the stories. And people thought that it is something wrong with me. And this\ngave me strength to survive. That if we will not be alive, the whole world would know\nwhat a cruel thing happened 1n this time. And for this reason not only I, all survivors,\ntheir duty is to write down, and to write and tell the stories. Because everyone survived\na different way. Everyone had different problems and cruelties. So for this I am telling,\nand I am going out, if somebody asked me to go and speak, I don\u2019t care where and\nhow and when, I never took money f-for it, and I am doing it because I think this is my\nduty, that the people should know what happened.\n18\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: Before we get to America, you had to leave Czechoslovakia, or afer -- n-n -- I\u2019m\nsorry, Poland, Poland first. Te-Te-Tell us a little bit more about some time the\ndecision was made, or you -- you and your wife talked about would you stay or would\nyou leave. S-Say something about it.",
        "A: Well, then later from Krakow, I was transferred to Breslau, and I became the head\nof the security for Breslau for the cow -- for the town. In Krak\u00e9w wa -- I was the\nhead for the county. In Breslau I was for the town. And again the same story, in\nBreslau | had a lot of work, because Breslau, first thing Breslau was 90 percent or 85\npercent destroyed, and there were a lot of Germans, and we wanted the Polish people\nshould come in, and they should show that there is -- this became a Polish town, and a\n-- and we then -- later we gave out in orders that all the Germans have to leave. Now\nthey left, and they had two suitcases, and this was something for me very, very\nimportant, because this was a pay back what they did to the Jews. Naturally they --\nwhen they were sent out, when we brought them to the train, we didn\u2019t kill them th --\nlike in the -- in the Szeszow where I was and one day they killed 6,000 Jews, sik -- 600\nJews, then thousand Jews, by an aktia -- we call it a aktia, it means an\n[indecipherable]. But by the Germans nobody was killed, they only had to leave. Now\nthe -- their apartments were taken over by Polish people, and in -- in -- in -- but -- but\none thing we s -- in this time also, the -- it started in Israel, we knew -- Palestine in\n19\nFebruary 9, 2001\nthis time, and we knew Palestine will have to -- the Jews will try to have their own\ncountry. And as -- I always was a Zionist. I never became a member of the communist\nparty, even they ask me to do it. But my excuse was that I am not in th -- [ -- Iam not\ntaught enough to know the ide -- the ideology about communism, I have to learn a\nlittle more, I have to read more and this was my excuse. And my wife never wanted to\nstay, because my wife had very bad experience, because when the Russians came in to\nthe -- her town in Stanislav -- in Stanislavov in 1940 -- in 1939, and they lived under\nco-communist regime, now the people who were well off were middle class\n[indecipherable] middle class they were -- th-th-the Russians tried to liquidate them.\nIf they were Zionists they sent them to Siberia, if they were rich they took away\neverything. So from them they took away their apartment, they took away the\nbusiness. Her father had to be a plain worker, which -- my wife wanted to study\nmedicine, they didn\u2019t let her in because she was a daughter of a bourge -- bourgeois\nfamily. So she sa -- and then they saw the system 1s not for her, so she didn\u2019t want to\nstay in Poland. And she always said, well in Poland you got a king for a night, but the\nend we -- I don\u2019t want. So we started to think -- and I also, when I was in Breslau, I\nstart -- well, even in Krakow, I started to work in that organization, a Zionist\norganization. Naturally the people from the organization knew that I am Jewish, and I\ngave them some protection, and they had to -- to -- to travel toward the\n20\nFebruary 9, 2001\nCzechoslovakian border, I helped them. And also, when I was in Breslau, I was still\ninvolved with this organization, and -- and -- and -- but -- but the end was that we had\nto leave, til 1t came a time that my wife said she ha -- we have to leave because the\nlonger we will wait, it will be harder to -- to go away. Now, I left first, and I left very -\n- not organize in [indecipherable] because I went with that -- with a truck, through the\nborder to East Germany, and on the way I could be caught, I we -- but it\u2019s a long\nstory, but I left.",
        "Q: I want to ask you a follow up question though. Were there other thoughts of why\nyou wanted to leave?",
        "A: Yo -- well, my th -- my thought -- well, see, the first thing my wife wanted to leave,\nof course, she had family in pales -- in is -- in Palestine at this time. She had a\ngrandmother, she had a sister, she has three uncles with her family. So she said, well\nshe had somebody. And I wanted to leave because I saw, even now -- I have a good\nposition and everything, but I had to masquerade. I wanted to be myself. I -- why\nshould I -- if we have a free country, and if we -- the communist regime is so equal, no\nanti-Semitic, why do I have to hide my identity? Why do I have to be Tadeusz\nZaleski? Why can\u2019t I be myself? And also, being a non-Jew, the people who work\nwith me, the people who were in the government didn\u2019t have no secrets because I was\none of them. So then I could see that deep in -- imbedded anti-Semitism towards Jews.\n21\nFebruary 9, 2001\nAnd nobody was a friend sp -- in those -- in this time. Even officially they couldn\u2019t go\nout and say, well I hate Jews, and this and that, but inside everybody was anti-Semite.\nNow, 1n the -- there were no secrets from me, so I saw that this will not be a life for\nme, and also my wife always said that the end will be -- see, in Russia, in the Russian\nsystem there were three kinds of people. People who were in jail, people -- pe -- he --\npeople who were in jail, people who are in jail, and people who will be 1n jail. So the\nend was I -- I didn\u2019t care how big I was, the end was if I do something -- something\nwrong, see, if I would be a -- a [indecipherable] if I would be a -- a communist, and I\nwill like the regime, and I [indecipherable], so then I would say, well this is my life,\nand I love it. I wasn\u2019t -- I come from a very Orthodox, ultra-Orthodox home. Reet --\nnot, I wouldn\u2019t say millionaires, but a very comfortable home. We were -- we were\nconsidered 10 percent of the richest people in our town. And the whole family was\nvery religious, so I was not brought up to be against religion, or to hate people who\nhave money or make a living. I did it because it was comfortable for me in this time.\nThe war ended, I wanted to take revenge, and I could have a job to be acknowledged,\nbut not as a Jew, so this was very bad for me. So I knew that the end would be I will\nnot be there. But longer my w -- my wife was very smart, she said, longer we will\nwait, worse it be to come out. And naturally I went out first, and she remained and she\nwas arrested because they thought through her they will get me. So -- but I never,\n22\nFebruary 9, 2001\nnever had my mind, because this was not a regime for me. Now, we want to go to\nPalestine. I was registered, and I worked with that group called Bricha. Bricha was\nthe one who took out people, and they smuggled them to Italy and from Italy to\nPalestine. Now, from Poland the Bricha went over to Germany, from Germany to\nItaly. Now, unofficially I belonged to them, because my dream was to be in Palestine.\nBecause even when I was home before the war I wanted to go to Palestine. But then\nlater we escaped and we came to Germany. In Germany there was other -- other\nproblem to go to Palestine because you couldn\u2019t go officially, you had to go illegally,\nand you wind out in Cyprus in a camp and my wife didn\u2019t want to go to a camp, so we\ncame to America. We said, we will go to America -- which one would come first,\nPalestine or America, and if America comes first, we\u2019ll go to America, and if we\u2019re\nin America we can always go to Palestine. And we came to America, and the first\nmoney we made in 1949, so we went to Palestine -- to -- it was already Israel, not\nPalestine. Well, this [indecipherable] but -- but it was -- for me it was too late,\nbecause there was no war --",
        "Q: We -- we'll get there, I want -- I just want to -- to -- to --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- follow the chronology a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah.\n23\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: Was it difficult to get a visa? Wa -- did you need papers that you didn\u2019t have? What\nwas --",
        "A: From where? From Poland? From po --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] no, no, no, no, from Germany.",
        "A: Oh, from Poland you couldn\u2019t go no place --",
        "Q: No, no, I know, but --",
        "A: I had to ask [indecipherable] yeah, it was difficult because in Germany if -- see, I\nhad a large family in America. My father had four brothers and two sisters and they\nhad children. Naturally, they were [indecipherable]. And we always -- and I had a\nbrother. So I wrote to them that I need affidavit, you need affidavit there, oh, my\nbrother said he\u2019d send me, I never got it. So I never got -- so I got -- and we wanted to\ngo at -- if we couldn\u2019t go to -- to Israel, we want to go to America, we didn\u2019t want to\nstay in Germany, because for me being in Germany, every day it was the biggest\ntorture. Because when I went in in a trolley car, and if I saw every German, I looked at\nevery German, I saw in every German I saw that he was the murderer of my father, the\nmurderer of my family. Every German looked to me the same. And I couldn\u2019t stay, so\n-- and I had a lot of problems, because I remember once I went in and in the trolley\ncar, and -- and I was sitting on -- on a seat, and there a woman, a elderly woman came\nin, and -- and I didn\u2019t get up, and so one young German came in, he says, why don\u2019t\n24\nFebruary 9, 2001\nyou get up, she\u2019s a old woman, and -- and -- and you are young fellow, why don\u2019t you\n-- so I said well, did somebody get up when my mother came in? My mother was\nkilled. So why should I -- maybe those are the people who killed my -- so we had a\nargument, then later we had the fight. I remember once we came in in a place and I\nsaw a la -- young Jewish, they fighting with a group of young Germans. I didn\u2019t ask\nquestions, I di -- I didn\u2019t know why. I jumped in. But so happens that I didn\u2019t look\nJewish, so the Jewish people started to beat me up. I said, \u201cWhat are you beating me\nup?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a German?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I am Jewish.\u201d So every day\n-- every day something else. So we di -- we wanted to get out, and we came -- you\ncouldn\u2019t go, you needed that affidavit. So I -- my family didn\u2019t send it to me, so the\nJoint Distribution, they gave out -- what they did, they didn\u2019t give out individual\naffidavits, they made a group, let\u2019s say hundred people and one affidavit, and the\norganization took care to show the government that we will not later stay in the -- in --\nin -- and not to make a living. So this is how we came. Even they paid -- they -- the\nJoint paid for my transportation, for the passage. Then later I paid them back, but they\ndidn\u2019t know if I would pay them back. But my family didn\u2019t do it.",
        "Q: So when you got the visa finally, what -- what happened then? Where did you go,\nand how was the boat trip?\n25\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: When I got that visa, so we were assigned to go to Bremen, and from Bremen to\ngo to America. But in this time, we -- we had to stay in Bremen almost a half a year,\nbecause it was a coal strike in amer -- in -- in America, and the ships -- the boats\ndidn\u2019t take us.",
        "Q: Was it Bremen or Bremenhaven?",
        "A: Bremenhaven. In Bremenhaven we were there 1n there they made like a staging\narea in a school, and the people you were staying there, they gave us to eat, but we\ncouldn\u2019t leave. Now, it was also a very unpleasant place because that ger -- when --\nwhen you got -- when you had to go to get the visa, Germans got the visa very fast.\nBut course, by us, there was in this time, the consul and the co -- they -- they -- they\ndidn\u2019t let the Jewish people who wanted to go to America, they didn\u2019t let them to -- to\nsee the consul. Why? Because they demanded documents, birth certificate, and\n[indecipherable]. Where did the Jews get documents when they came out from death\ncamps? So every day in the consulate, there were hundreds of Jews waiting that\nnobody could reach the consul. So there was one secretary and she made a business\nout of it, and for 200 dollars, she made that you could see the consul. Now people start\n-- who had money started to pay her, and everybody knew that she takes money. Now\nthe first thing we didn\u2019t have the money and we didn\u2019t want to pay, why should we\npay her? So because my wife spoke English, I spoke a little English, I said, we have to\n26\nFebruary 9, 2001\ntake it in our hand. So there was that general consul, I remember his name was\nClarke. And this Clarke, we said we have to see him. So once when he went for\nlunch, we stopped him. And my wife said she wants to talk to him, and she -- he\nexplained -- she explained to him that it is impossible, there are hundreds of people\nwho want to go to America, and we cannot go because this woman demands 200\ndollars for a person to let her see -- and she -- she was a partner with one of the vice-\nconsuls, there was [indecipherable] and she was a partner and she sent it to him and\nthey got im -- they got the visa. So she told this -- everything to the Clarke and I was\nstanding there and he listened and listened. So he said, well I want you should come to\nmy office, and we went there. And we explained, and I remember that when we left, so\nhe came to us and he put the hand on our head. He said, \u201cWell, do you know, children\nlike you we need in America.\u201d And he changed the whole rule. Instead before you\nneeded -- she -- this woman said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the documents, I don\u2019t let -- I\ndon\u2019t make the application.\u201d So he changed the rules, and the rules were you needed\ntwo witnesses. And when the two witnesses gave a statement that they know you, you\ncome from this town, and everything, the two witness was -- so everybody got two\nwitnesses. One was a witness for him, then later he was a witness for them. And then\nthe people -- we were -- we ca -- we came them every day. Then later the people knew\nthat we made this change, and they were very happy. Even til today some people who\n27\nFebruary 9, 2001\nare here and they always remind us that we went and we had the guts to speak up. And\nthis way, we -- this woman was fired. They -- the -- the consul -- the visa consul was\nstill there. It so happened that we were assigned -- I remember he had one le -- he was\na -- a invalid, so we were assigned to him because the general consul didn\u2019t take care\non all the children, so -- on all the people, so we were assigned to him. When we were\nassigned to him, and -- and he didn\u2019t ask us too many question because we had the two\naffidavits. Then later he said to raise the hand and he swore us in. So I was afraid\nbecause I almost burst out in laughter, because he was the one who was a partner with\nthis woman, and now he is giving me this thing. Well, we got the visa and we had to\ngo to Bremen, in Bremen we got stuck for six months. And then later we went on the\n-- on the liberty ship. Those were the ships, th-the name was Ernie Pyle. This was the\nlast time that the liberty ship, and unlucky we were cause it was in the winter, it was in\nJanuary, and -- and underw -- underway it was a terrible storm, and the ship, the boiler,\neverything broke and we almost drowned. And everybody was so sick, that I was\nlaying on the -- on -- on the [indecipherable] the -- the people, the men were in the\nbasement, what maybe 201 in -- in -- in this hole. Now the women were 20 - 25 in\ntheir cabin, when -- and I was so sick I was laying out -- outside on the deck. And I\npray to God it\u2019s -- the ship should sink. I couldn\u2019t take it, I didn\u2019t eat. So my wife, in\nthis time she put on a woman\u2019s housecoat with the woman\u2019s pajama and the kerchief\n28\nFebruary 9, 2001\non my head, and she took me in in her room. And the people in her room knew and --\nthat I am with her and I slept there, and this was a little better. But what -- we were\nvery, very angry that the German people who went to America in this time, cause a lot\nof German went to America, they had family here, they had the big, best cabins,\nbecause they had money to pay. And they -- the people from the company were\nGerman, so they had cabins and they were sitting and eating and drinking and dancing.\nAnd we were laying like -- like dogs in -- in -- so this was very, very unfair. But this\nhow they came. So mo -- not only on our ship, on all the ships. So the German people\nhad all the privileges because they were normal people and they got people who gave\nthem those places, and they could pay for it. So then we came to -- we came to\n[indecipherable] we arrived in America January the 17\", and -- and -- and we were\nso sick. So then later, a night before, somebody said, tomorrow morning we atrive in\nAmerica. So I -- I as -- how -- as sick we were, everybody di -- dragged out the -- the -\n- the -- the best suit, with the best coat, and we were [indecipherable] and we waited\nhalf a night, we were just staying on the deck waiting for the Statue of Liberty. And\nwhen the statue of -- when we saw the Statue of Liberty, everybody from us started to\ncry. Even today [indecipherable] we saw already the Statue of Liberty, and this we --\nwe are in America. Now wa -- wa -- wa -- this was not the end. Then later when we --\nwe went that -- they said to take out the valises and everything, so we took it out on the\n29February 9, 2001\ndeck. Everyone to his initial, N to N, S to S and so on, and then later they came to\ncheck. So the American customs, they opened the valises, they [indecipherable]. And\nwe were staying there in -- where -- where the [indecipherable] then a\n[indecipherable] a heavy set guy in the -- in the -- in the lumber jacket comes in and\nhe goes around and he ask where 1s it, where are the Saleschutz\u2019s? Sa -- so we were\nvery much afraid, maybe -- figured maybe something is wrong, and they would ship us\nback or something. We didn\u2019t say anything in the beginning and later he said, \u201cWell,\ntheir should -- was supposed to be two people with the name Saleschutz,\u201d yeah. So\nmy wife was standing there, and she said, \u201cYes, we are Saleschutz.\u201d And \u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d We were so afraid. So he said, \u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d And he\ngot up to my wife and he kissed her, he got up to me, he said, \u201cYou know, I am,\u201d --\nand we thought this 1s some official, he said, \u201cI am Yagi, Reisel\u2019s son.\u201d Later he\nbecame Jake. In America [indecipherable], \u201cI am Yagi and I find out that you are\ncoming, so I came in here.\u201d Now he could go in -- in the -- yeah, right away, when we\nwere standing, and all the people didn\u2019t know what -- what to think. And he right away\ncalled the custom man and the custom came and he didn\u2019t open anything, he just put in\na piece of paper on this and he called a longshoreman, and he took the two suitcase we\nhave and put them in. And he -- all the people are waiting, they\u2019re waiting, and we\nwere taken out, and they -- they thought, who knows, that probably we are the\n30\nFebruary 9, 2001\npresident of the United States and so on. And we ta -- he took us out in the -- right on\nthe sidewalk when we took us out, a car was waiting and we went in in the car and this\nwas -- my brother was waiting 1n the car, they couldn\u2019t park there, but through him\nthey parked. So we find out later, and w-we said, this Jack he had -- he became Jack,\nhe had a luncheonette on the -- on -- by the docks. And everybody ate by him, and they\nknew him. And when he find out that we are coming, so he came in and he took us out.\nNaturally this was a very surprise -- and a pleasant surprise in America. And later we\nfind out he was a very nice fellow. And this is how we arrived. We arrived -- this is the\n17\" of January in 1947.",
        "Q: Were you sick on the boat all the time, or did you also --",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: -- all the time?",
        "A: Yeah, I was sick right the second day. I didn\u2019t eat all the whole time. My wife\nwasn\u2019t sick. Now, we were sick in the [indecipherable] that was terrible sick, so she\nsomehow -- she didn\u2019t have -- I -- I couldn\u2019t eat anything, and -- and so she em -- met\nar -- a Sailor and he was a black sailor, so she told him I am sick, so he used to give\nher an -- an apple, a banana, something like this, she brought it to me. But I was -- I\nwas very -- I couldn\u2019t -- I was very sick, do it -- all the time. Di -- and -- and the trip\nlasted 14 days.\n31\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: So now you are an American and one of the first, most pressing things was to find\nwork for you. Tell a little -- tell a little bit about the work process. Did you have help\nfrom your family, how -- what happened?",
        "A: Well, the wer -- the work process, first in America, I had the very unpleasant thing\n-- see, my brother took me to his home, and I stayed with my bro -- he had his own\nhouse, and I stayed with his house two weeks. After two weeks he said that I have to\nlook for an apartment, because in America two weeks is enough, and then later you\n[indecipherable] the fami -- and so -- so I brought with me 200 dollars. 200 dollars I\nbrought, they were hundred dollar bill, two hundred dollar bills, but they were the long\nhundred dollar bills, maybe you remember they were the long one, not the new one in\nthere and so my brother said we\u2019|l go to the bank, we\u2019ll put it in the bank. And we\nwent with him to the bank, to his bank. And the girl who took it looked and looked,\nand she called the manager, and the manager looked at it and he said those are\ncounterfeit money. He said, well by right I have to call the FBI, and see, because if\nyou just came over, maybe you smu -- maybe with the ring, but he\u2019s going to do us a\nfavor. He did us a favor and he took a match and he burned the 200 dollars. He said, \u201cI\nwill not call nobody,\u201d and later of -- well, today, I am very sorry that he did it, because\nI\u2019m a -- a-- acoin collector and a bank note collector, so today those -- this money\nwas made in Auschwitz, they had Jewish engravers and artists, and they made false\n32\nFebruary 9, 2001\nmoney. And Germany used this money all over the world. So today, a hundred dollar\nbill which was counterfeit and was in Auschwitz is worth 10,000 dollars. But they\nburned it and this was my -- so then I had to look for a job. Now before -- before\nlooking for a job, so the family got together. I had uncles and I had cousins, and some\ncousins were very rich. So we got together and they said, what should we do with the\nboy. It means me. I was in this time 27 years. My wife and -- got a first job she got in -\n- to make ties. But she didn\u2019t know how to sew, so she worked there one week and the\nwoman said, \u201cYou know, you didn\u2019t make enough, even half what I\u2019m going to pay\nyou, and I -- you can -- you can leave.\u201d But she went and she got a permit to be a\nHebrew teacher, yeah, so in the beginning she got the permi -- a temporary permit and\nlater [indecipherable] she got a -- so I lived on her -- on her salary. But I -- we found\nan apartment, it was very hard to find an apartment, so Italian man took us 1n in his\napartment, he had two rooms. And he -- we were in one room, and he didn\u2019t want to\ntake money for being [indecipherable] so he said you stay here, and we were there,\nand it was a very bad in a -- over a factory and then -- and we had a lot of mice. We\nhad a small kitchen and he had his bedroom. We had in the living room we slept in.\nThen later he left for Italy, and I remember his name was Rosario. He left for Italy,\nand then he said -- he gave us over the apartment, 1t was very hard to find apartment.\nNow [had to get a job. So I didn\u2019t have a trade, and my English wasn\u2019t good, so a\n33February 9, 2001\ncousin got me a job in the same house in a ink factory. And the ink factory was very,\nvery bad for me, because there were 11 people. There were 10 blacks, I was one white,\nwhich 1s all right. But the boss, the owner, to the -- when the black boys came in he\nused to tell them good morning. When I came in, I said good morning, he never\nanswered.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\n34February 9, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: -- now I had to get a job. So I didn\u2019t have a trade, and my English wasn\u2019t good, so a\ncousin got me a job in the same house in a ink factory. And the ink factory was very,\nvery bad for me, because there were 11 people. There were 10 blacks, I was one white,\nwhich 1s all right. But the boss, the owner, to the -- when the black boys came in he\nused to tell them good morning. When I came in, I said good morning, he never\nanswered. And then -- and then he disliked me from the first minute. And I knew that I\nwill not be able to be there long. So I had the friend -- and I almost got crazy, I wanted\nto commit suicide, because here -- from Poland I was a big shot and I came over here\nand I was nothing. I -- I couldn\u2019t make a living. I made a -- the first job, I remember I\nmade 21 dollars a week. And 21 dollars a week, my wife, as a teacher, she made more\nthan double. So what -- and about 21 dollars. So I knew that I will not stay there long.\nSo I went to my friend, he was a psychiatrist and he came with me on one ship. He\nwas the head of Graystone Park, that is a mental hospital. And I told him that I -- I\u2019m\ngoing crazy, I will commit suicide. So he said, \u201cYou have to quit the job because you\ncannot,\u201d -- what my job was, I f -- in a ink factory I filled out every -- there were three\ntrays with ink. I had the gadget and I put in and I fill up the ink, all day staying there.\nSo I was thinking and I will li -- I -- I lived through the whole war during every day.\nSo he said, \u201cYou have to quit, you have to go to have a job, you should work with your\n35February 9, 2001\nmind. Not like this.\u201d So -- so he -- so -- in -- in -- in -- to quit, I figured before I quit I\nhave to take care of my boss, who made my life miserable. So I took care of him --\nwell, not -- then -- do you want me take -- how I take care?",
        "Q: You could just --",
        "A: All right, so I worked on this -- in the factory and -- and this man, he made my -- he\ngave me -- he start to call me a very bad name. He was Jewish and he was from\nPoland, but he was already here 25 years, yes, so he was a big shot. So -- and -- so I\nwas -- like for instance, I don\u2019t know if I told you this the last time, we also made -- by\nink, we also made mucilage, the glue. We were -- you know what mucilage 1s -- is,\nyeah? So we made this, and when we made it we had to put in a big container, powder\nwith water and this had to boil. But while it was boiling you had to mix it, or otherwise\nit would burn. So I used to mix it, so he comes in and he\u2019s -- calls me bad names, he\nsaid not to mix it from the left to the right, but from the right to the left. I says,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cBecause I want it so.\u201d So I said -- and he showed\nme how. So we made one batch his way, and it took 15 minutes longer than my way.\nSo I said, \u201cYou see, mine goes faster.\u201d He said, \u201cStill I want my way.\u201d And he -- he\nabu -- he -- he abused me, so I said someday I will teach you a lesson. And -- and\nwhen -- when -- we had this cage, it was about like a room with the ink that we put in\nin the bottles the ink, and when it was empty, so we washed it out, so when it was\n36\nFebruary 9, 2001\nempty, so I took a -- a stopper, a cork from the mucilage and I put it into the spigot in\nthe inside, and then later we filled it up with water, and we -- with powder, and with\nthe mechanical mixerer. And then when I started to put in wa -- it didn\u2019t go. It didn\u2019t\ngo. He couldn\u2019t understand why, so he went up on the ladder, and this was like a --\nlike a -- like -- like a ha -- like a room. He tried with a wire to push through. More he\npushed, worse it was, and then later he couldn\u2019t reach it, he put -- put -- he took a box,\nput in the ladder on the box and th-then try. I don\u2019t know what happened, this was a\nfull -- it was maybe thousands of gallons of ink, and something happens that he bent\nover and he fell in there. He almost drowned and he started to yell, they pulled him up.\nAs they pulled him out and -- and -- and -- and bi -- he was still dripping with the ink,\nand he gave me a name -- there 1s a expression, and -- for a refugee or a\n[indecipherable], they called him a greener -- a greener [indecipherable] but he gave\nme two names. He g-gave me a greener tookas, it means a green ass, that\u2019s how -- and\nthis how he called me. And I was very angry [indecipherable] so when -- the minute\nwe pulled him out, so tha -- the first thing he said, \u201cNobody did it but the greener\ntookas.\u201d So -- so then -- and then he didn\u2019t know how he fell in, but he was on the lad\n-- on the ladder, I -- so happens that I went through and -- and I did it. But he didn\u2019t\nknow. So he said you fired. So I s -- this was on a Wednesday, I remember, I said,\n\u201cNo, y -- I cannot be fired.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean you cannot be fired?\u201d I said,\n37\nFebruary 9, 2001\n\u201cBecause I quit last Friday.\u201d So I lost a few days, he never paid me. So then I went\ninto other jobs and like I said, I had so many jobs, but each job --",
        "Q: Ho-How many jobs did you have, and how --",
        "A: Oh, I had -- I had about eight, nine jobs, I don\u2019t know. Because each job or -- you\nsee, there were two reasons that -- or I was -- I wanted to -- a device to make it better,\nor to do something, so they said well what -- he\u2019s going to tell me, the boss, he had to\nteach me. And then I -- ye -- also, when I -- when I went on a job, the first day, the\nsecond day, I always was thinking, how long will it take me to take over this business,\nyou know? This was in my mind, or -- not to take away th -- to be in this business.\nWell, anyway, some guy, I told him to co -- to correct, do this, and then I -- yeah, I -- I\n-- you see, I was always -- home I was a businessman. I was not staying there just to\nwork and not to -- well, anyway, after about a year and meanwhile -- and my wife got\nthe job, so she -- from her money that we -- she made, so for one week we lived for\ntwo weeks, because we lived -- pay -- rents we didn\u2019t pay, and everything was so\ncheap and we didn\u2019t go out. I remember I had to make a phone call, it was five dol --\nfive cents, we had to think twice to make the phone call. And -- and after -- after -- I\neven had my own business, I worked in a -- in a remnants place, we used to export\nremnants. I didn\u2019t call them remnants, I called remnantses because there were a lot of\nthem. So one is a remnant, a lot is remnantses. So I --\n38\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: I -- I want to -- I want to ask you two specific questions -- two specific stories --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- because they were important, I thought. The first story was about when you went\nto your cousin to the factory, to ask whether you would have a job, and there\u2019s a whole\nstory connected when you finally met Joe Siegel. Maybe you can kind of tell that\nStory.",
        "A: Oh, you me -- yeah. Well, so I went and I looked for a job, but I -- one uncle is --\nwho was very nice, he was a poor uncle, and he never made a living, cause everything\nwas on his mind, the whole family. So he was very nice, so he went with me, and there\nwas one cousin, and he -- and -- and -- and they had the largest silk company in the\nUnited States, lining for [indecipherable] silk. Ven -- they were very well known,\nand -- and so I went to -- to the f -- to -- to them Sunday morning to visit the father, to\nask my job. He said, \u201cWell, I am retired, but my son is the owner now from the how --\nfrom the business you go to him.\u201d So he -- so I went over the next day naturally, I got\ndressed in my best, a European coat, a European suit, a European hat. And naturally it\nwas not like in America. So I came in, there was a beautiful receptionist, and then she\nask me what I want, so I -- my English, I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m a cousin of -- of the -- your\nboss,\u201d and his name was Saleschutz, they never changed the name. I wanted -- so she\ntold him and I went in. I went in, he was sitting by his desk, he didn\u2019t go a -- didn\u2019t get\n39\nFebruary 9, 2001\nup, he didn\u2019t shake hands. He looked at me and the first words he said, \u201cWhat do you\nwant?\u201d So I told him, I saw yesterday your father and I need a job, I just came from --\nno, the girl asked me who are you. I said, \u201cI have the same name as your boss. His\nname is Saleschutz, I am Saleschutz.\u201d Because this was before I changed my name.\nSo then he said what do you want. So I said, \u201cI came and I need a job.\u201d And he -- they\n-- they had about 300 people working there. So he looked and looked at me, and he\ntook out a wallet from his pocket, he took out a hundred dollar bill, put it on the table,\nand he said, \u201cTake it, and get off my back.\u201d And when he said to this, naturally I didn\u2019t\ntake the hundred dollars. Now, the tears filled up my eyes, and I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t -- I\ncouldn\u2019t answer anything, and I couldn\u2019t cry. It was like -- like sometimes you fall\ndown from a -- from a ladder and -- and then -- and I was standing there, and -- and the\nminute I was standing there, when he told me this, and this went through very fast in\nmy mind, and what would I do if he would come to Poland, and -- and -- and he will\nsay this is my cousin. So I -- I visualize that I was in this time in -- in the army, I will\nmake a -- a review, I-I put him on the reviewing stand [indecipherable] the army,\nwe'll go there, through will salute, and I'll tell everybody this is my cousin. But here\nhe said to me, take the hundred dollars, get off my back. So I didn\u2019t take it. Then,\nwhen I didn\u2019t take it, he took it back, and put it in in his wallet, and he said, \u201cWell,\nanother thought I\u2019m going to give it to United Jewish Appeal, let them do what they\n40\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwant with this money.\u201d And I run out, and as I came to this receptionist\n[indecipherable] room, I burst out in -- not in crying, but li -- I couldn\u2019t breathe. And\nI run out, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d So I said nothing\u2019s wrong, and I\nwould run out, and I was staying in the hallway, and I was crying. I was 27 years old\nand I was crying. A man goes through, and -- and he said, \u201cHey mister, what\u2019s wrong,\nwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d So I said to him, \u201cAre you an American Jew?\u201d He said yes. So I said,\n\u201cYou know, you should have been in Auschwitz and be killed.\u201d To him. So he said,\n\u201cWhy you say, why you curse at me there?\u201d He says becau -- so I said to him, \u201cWhy\nshould my father -- father be killed because he\u2019s a Jew, and you live here, and you\nhave everything.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what I am saying, it was a -- so he said, \u201cHey, why\nyou cursing me?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d So he says, \u201cYou know what, you ate lunch?\u201d\nI said no. He said, \u201cI want you should come with me, I\u2019m going to eat lunch.\u201d So I\nwent with him. And I stop crying, and I remember we went into a luncheonette. And\nthe first time I had this -- and he -- oh, he ask me what do you want. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, I will have the same thing you have.\u201d So I remember he ask [indecipherable]\ncheese with the -- with the vegetables with radishes, with onions, with -- all chopped\nup together. And I liked it so I said I will have the same. And I ate, ate, I felt better. So\nhe -- so he said, \u201cYou want the other one?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, one 1s enough.\u201d He said, \u201cNow\ntell me, why did you curse me, why did you cry?\u201d So I told him the story. I told him\n41\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhe\u2019s my cousin, and yeah. So he said, \u201cIt so happens that I am one of his customers.\u201d I\nsaid you should go -- he said, \u201cYou come with me. And I want you should hit the son\nof a bitch in his nose, in his face, but I want to see blood.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\nnothing will happen to you, I will be with you.\u201d I said you go and this guy deserved --\nso I said, \u201cNo, I only can tell you one thing, so long as I will be alive, I will never\nspeak to him.\u201d He gave me his card, and I remember his name was Louis Siegel, and -\n- and he gave me, he said, \u201cYou come and see me when you feel better.\u201d And I came\nto him and he used to buy -- he used to get re -- well, now remnantses. And he used to\nsee it to people who use like [indecipherable]. And how did he get? He got -- he got\nthese remnants -- remnants illegal. Why illegal? Because when they send over to a\nconverter material, and when they dyed it, and then after the dyeing, always shrunk\nmaybe one percent, two percent. But he was a partner with the guy from the dyeing\nand he shrunk five percent. So from each piece he got a piece of six, seven yards. And\nhe got those things. Now, he paid 40 cents a -- a pound, and he sold it for four dollars a\npound. So he said to me, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you every week a case of remnants.\u201d And\nhe gave me the address where to sell it. And he told me how much to s -- for how\nmuch to sell it. And he said to -- to me, \u201cI will charge you what I pay for it.\u201d A\nstranger. And I went to him, and I did it once, maybe once a week, maybe once a\nmonth, how much he told me to give it, and I took those things and I dragged it to the\n42\nFebruary 9, 2001\nplace -- to the wholesale place, and I accumulate nice money. And he was always\nhappy, he told me, this is what you have to get [indecipherable]. One day I come into\nhim, he was sitting, he was not sha -- yeah, this was when I want to -- when I came to\nhim, it\u2019s the first time that I saw a shirt white on white, I never saw it before, so I\nlooked at him and I said something, a beautiful shirt, yeah. So and one day I come in\nand he was sitting there not shaved and this and that, so I said, [indecipherable] what\nhappened? He said -- he said to me, \u201cI\u2019m in trouble. I\u2019m in trouble, and the police is\nafter me.\u201d And he lost everything. And he lost everything, so I lost everything. But he\nwas the nicest guy in the -- he had a strange -- I never saw him [indecipherable]\nfamily, nothing. So then later I started on my own to buy, but I didn\u2019t have money to\ndo it. Now, there was a question about my name. Now, th-the -- my -- my family -- yo",
        "Q: Let me -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s skip that qu -- that one because I would like to ask you\nsomething else. When you were a peddler for a long time --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- 20 years ago, you told me last time one story where you walked up the stairs and\nyou overheard a young mother talking to the child. Could you tell that story?",
        "A: Yeah, well then later I had this [indecipherable] job, this job, then later somebody\ntold me what do you have, what do you need the job, I will give you a good job. And\n43\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhe had the wholesale place on in the -- on the east side that peddlers used to buy by\nhim dry goods and this. So he said to me that -- and there -- and now then I met a lot of\npeople who were peddlers and everybody in this time they made money. So he said to\nme, \u201cWell, don\u2019t look for a job, I'll tell you what to do. I will give you merchandise\nand you go out, and I will tell you, and you sell it on payments, and you don\u2019t have to\nbuy the merchandise. And -- and then -- then later you will collect, we will split the\nprofit.\u201d So he says, \u201cHow do you like it?\u201d Said -- so I said, \u201cI like it very much under\none exception.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, what\u2019s the exception?\u201d I said, \u201cI will -- you will give\nme merchandise and then later we\u2019ll be partners.\u201d I said, \u201cI will get the merchandise,\nbut I don\u2019t want partners.\u201d [indecipherable] So I -- they gave me some credit, and I\nstarted to -- to go to Jersey City, because in Jersey City there were Polish people. And\nthen the problem was that all my customers lived on the fifth floor -- on the fourth\nfloor, there were no elevators, and I had two suitcase, and I had to drag the suit -- I\ncouldn\u2019t leave them downstairs, so I dragged them upstairs. And one time I came into\none Polish woman, and she was a young woman maybe 28 - 29 years, and the door\nwas open, and I hear she yells in it\u2019s -- the child cries. So she -- she -- and she didn\u2019t\nknow I am in the doorway, and she started to scream on the child, she said, \u201cStop\ncrying because if you don\u2019t stop crying, the Jew -- the Jew will come, he will take you\naway in his sack.\u201d This what she told to the child. So the child stopped crying. Then\n44February 9, 2001\nwhen -- when -- then she goes out, she saw me, sh-she was a little -- not worried, but\nshe [indecipherable]. So I asked her, \u201cTell me, how come that you said to the child,\nstop crying because the Jew will come and take you away in the sack? So I mean, how\nmany Jews did you see that they come around and they grab children?\u201d She said,\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, but I remember when I cried, my mother used to tell me this. I\nalways was so afraid that I stopped crying. So I am telling it to her.\u201d And what I\nunderstood that this child will grow up and this child will tell it to her children. And\nthis 1s how the -- the heritage from -- from those people who didn\u2019t know why she\nsaid, but she said it. So then, b-being a peddler, I -- I made out very well. And I\nremember the first day, I have to tell you [indecipherable] becoming a peddler, I used\nto make 21 dollars a week. So then later when I became a peddler, so they told me\nsome -- some man told me, he brought me to a man, and he said to me to buy\nchildren\u2019s socks. So I bought hundred dozen children\u2019s socks in two suitcases. And I\npaid -- I paid two dollars a dozen. And I went to Jersey City. In one day I sold a\nhundred -- everybody had children, and I sold them for three dollars a dozen, three\ndollars a dozen was cheap. And I made a dollar a dozen. And I sold in one day,\nhundred dozen children\u2019s socks, and I made hundred dollars profit. When I made the\nhundred dollars profit -- this was the first day, I remember. So I said -- people used to\nsay that in America money is laying on the street. It is laying on the street, but you\n45\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhave to know how to pick it up. I said, this is for me. This is my country. If I could\nmake the first day a hundred dollars a day, so I will -- I will remain a peddler. And\nstarted to sell socks, then underwear, th-the dresses, then curtains, and I wind up the\nend with furniture. I sold only furniture, I had the warehouse. So this was the\nbeginning of being a peddler. So I was about 10 years -- 10 years a peddler til I\nbecame a builder.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back then, at one point you did go to Palestine -- or to Israel at that time -",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I would like to -- to get a sense of what it was like to be there, and what your\nfamily said to you, because you were still thinking of moving.",
        "A: Yeah. When we -- when -- it was 29 -- in 1949, I was in America al -- almost --\nalmost two years, and I accumulate enough money to go to -- also my wife in this time\nwas a Hebrew teacher. And there was a special in the Hebrew University, there were\nspecial courses for American Hebrew teachers. They -- they wanted to -- to make it a\nhigher level. So sh -- we went and we did the train -- this was the first time there was a\nplane to Israel in \u201949. In the -- before there were no plane -- planes. So we went in the\n-- today, takes six hours to go to Israel. In this time it took us 36 hours. We went -- we\nstopped in Newfoundland -- Newfoundland, we stopped in Shannon, we stopped in -\n46\nFebruary 9, 2001\n- in Switzerland, we stopped in Rome, cause they had to refuel, and -- and then we\ncame to Israel. I remember -- and they had a lot of problems, the people who were\nwith us 1n the -- on the -- on the plane, because we stopped in all those places, so we\nwent down. And every time we went down we couldn\u2019t go up because we didn\u2019t have\nper -- papers, we only had a piece of paper that we are -- and we just came. So it took\nlong, and they didn\u2019t like it, but anyway, we came to Israel. And I will never forget\nthe -- th-the feeling when -- when the plane came over Israel, you s -- look out\nthrough the window, you see s -- yellow sand, yellow sand. Then later, suddenly you\nsee like a nice green, garden. And this was Israel [indecipherable]. And when we\nwere [indecipherable] we started to sing, and -- and then I went down, so I lay --\nkneeled down on the ground, and I started to kiss the -- the -- the earth, and we started\nto cry, and -- and -- and it was -- the family was waiting for us, my wife\u2019s family, my\nbrother was family and they took us home. And t -- they were very happy as --\nnaturally it\u2019s the first time that -- that my wife saw her grandmother after the war, that\nshe survived, and my brother, and with the children. Now, we came -- we wanted to\nremain. And we said we have nothing in -- in America. We -- I make a living, but we\nhave no ties. Th-The -- the rooms, we had the same room where this Italian guy gave\nus, and we wanted -- and then it was very bad in Israel. I don\u2019t know if you know\nwhat means senna. Senna was a time that -- that everything was on cards, you\n47\nFebruary 9, 2001\ncouldn\u2019t buy this, you couldn\u2019t buy this, and the people didn\u2019t made money -- it was a\nvery t-terrib -- because they had all the new immigrants, there was no industry. So we\nsaid to -- I -- I said I always wanted to -- to live in Israel, and I -- so we -- so the\nfamily got together, and they said, \u201cYou -- you came too late.\u201d Why too late? Would\nyou come when you wanted before the war, I could be very imp-important in the war.\nThey didn\u2019t have professional soldiers, I was, and -- and I wanted to fight for Israel,\nbut the war is ended, and the -- everybody -- so what will you do, you will come over\nhere, we will have two more mouths to feed, we don\u2019t have food. And we then -- what\nwill you do, and you -- says you are in America, you establish yourself a little bit, you\nmaking out all right. Go back, make money, send us the money. And this was the\nreason why -- and my wife wanted to stay because she had there a sister, and her sister\nwas starving, she had the farm, and they didn\u2019t have what to give to eat to the\nchickens, it was -- 1t was terrible. So we came back and -- and this was -- th -- then\nlater we went every year, every two years, but this was the re -- the reason we went\nover, because we wanted to stay. Because I s-said if I survive the war, I have to g -- I\nhave to live in Israel. And even til today, my biggest regret, if you ask me about\nregrets in life, my biggest regret 1s that I didn\u2019t go to Israel, not in this time, but before\nIsrael was established. Because if I -- who would -- who had to go? I was 27 years\nold. Who had to go to Israel to fight, if not a survivor of the Holocaust who was 27\n48\nFebruary 9, 2001\nyears old? And special when I had the schooling what the Russians gave me, the\nschooling that I could ba -- so even til today, I always say this is my biggest regret.\nAnd I have articles in this new book about those things.",
        "Q: Now in the -- while -- while you are working in the early years, in -- in very -- first\nyear, or second year in America, too, you were also training for combat. Can you tell\nabout that a little bit? You -- you meant to go and fight [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, well, when I was starting in the first year, so I belonged to undergrounds,\nwhich from like they were illegal -- illegal organizations. You probably know there\nwas the Haganah, but there were more radicals, it was the -- the sten group, the atsel\nwhere Begin was. So I belonged to those organizations, because I was in my mind --\nmy mind was, eventually I want to go. This was before Israel was li -- was\nestablished. So we -- we had -- there was one man, he sa -- he was a major in the\nBritish army, he\u2019s no -- his name was Weiser. He actually was from South Africa, but\nhe was in British army. And he came to America, and he organize, and he called it\nGeorge Washington Legion. And the George Washington -- because there was once\na George Washington Legion that they went in to fight for Ireland, but this was\nbefore. So he organized this and he got people together, he wanted to organize it here,\nand to -- equipped -- to be equipped here, and to go to Palestine in this time to fight as\na unit. And he -- we worked, and we -- we had meetings every week, and I remember\n49\nFebruary 9, 2001\nthe meetings were -- there was a hotel, Algonquin Hotel in New York. We had to\nhave the meetings, naturally. I went to the meeting, now everybody in mostly Mosul\nthey had people who belonged to this that were veterans, who came back from --\nAmerican veterans, who didn\u2019t have what to do. They came back, some were Zionists,\nsome were not Zionists, that they wanted to do something. Also, we had a -- a lot of\nblack soldiers that they came, and tha -- this was a opportunity. So we ha -- and I were\n-- and they establish a staff, and I was picked up, in the staff I was picked out -- I was\nmade that I am the head of the military police, because my background in Poland, so\nlo -- and I was very happy, and we worked and wer -- and then it was -- he tried to get\nthe permission from the American government, and they refused him. They said that\nyou can go individually, but not as organization. A-A-Again, individually, 1t means\nillegal. But not as our -- he wanted to have a organization equipped, and money should\ncome from America. So when I -- when this happened to them in this time, I also -- I\nstarted -- I belonged -- this was liquidated, so I belonged to the atsel, to the extreme\nrevolutionaries, they\u2019re from Israel, so I belonged and then I wanted to go and they\nprepared. And my je -- I worked, but also my job was that we collected guns from\nveterans in America and we sent them over. Now, the guns had to be packed. So we\nhad a place, by some Jew who he -- was a furrier on 27\" Street, and I went there after I\nworked, I went over ev-every night, and what we did, we -- we cleaned the guns, and\n50February 9, 2001\nwe put them -- we packed them in barrels, and we closed it, and then there was\ncamouflage [indecipherable] material, and -- and this had to go to Israel, to pal -- to\nPalestine in this time for the people from the atsel. And then one day we were packing\nthis and the police came in. Somebody in -- squealed, I don\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know what,\nand they arrested us. They -- we were there about eight, nine people. They arrested,\nthey confiscated the -- the guns, and I was taken to jail.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- And one day we were packing this and the police came in. Somebody in --\nsquealed, I don\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know what, and they arrested us. They -- we were there\nabout eight, nine people. They arrested, they confiscated the -- the guns, and I was\ntaken to jail. And I was 1n jail a herely -- I -- I just came from Europe and I was a\nstranger and I\u2019m already in jail. And I was there overnight, and the next day a group\ncame, and the police, and started to interrogate us. And then after they ask me\nquestions, they let us go. So they let us go, the reason why is because there were a lot\nof influential Jews in th -- with the police together. Well, now, legally I didn\u2019t have to\nlook here, we pack [indecipherable] everything was illegal, but they let us go, they\nsaid to go out. So -- but I still went there, and they prepared us to go illegal, through\nMarseilles, to France to go to Israel. I even -- we had a cousin, she was a nurse in the\n51\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhospital, and I talked her in, and she said she will go with us. And then one day -- one\nday I came there and they said well, Sunday morning you transport is going, and -- and\nI came home, and I said to my wife, I am going, and she was against it. And I started --\nI took what I could, a -- a knapsack, and I -- and she said to me, \u201cIf you are going you\nmust know one thing. You are going but you cannot come back to me. I will not wait\nfor you, and I don\u2019t care what, because I know you will go, you will be killed. And --\nand -- and -- and I don\u2019t -- I lost too many people in -- in -- in Europe, and I don\u2019t\nwant to have [indecipherable] so you -- you can go, I cannot stop you. But you cannot\ncome back to me.\u201d Well, I felt very bad, and we had to meet in this hotel, we had to\nmeet Sunday morning and then a truck had to take us in -- to the -- to a boat, to go to --\nto ma -- to France, and from France to Israel. And I got what I had to take and I went\nthere -- over there, and -- and then they -- when I was there, so I was thinking wa --\nwhat my wife told me, and I said I am not going. They were very much surprised\nbecause they liked me. Now, my cousin, th -- ma -- Marilyn Petranka, she went, and\nshe was a nurse during the war, and she met a -- a young English doctor who was\nJewish, and they fell in love, and they got married, and they live now in Canada. They\nhave children. But she was in during the whole war, because they needed nurses and\nshe was a registered nurse. And I never, never went. This was -- this was before --\nbefore \u00b040 -- it was in \u00b040 s -- in \u201947, the year that we arrived to America.\n52\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: In those early years, who were your friends?",
        "A: Well, first I have to tell you -- I don\u2019t know if I told you about changing my name,\nthis 1s very important. I don\u2019t know if I told you the last time?",
        "Q: Yeah, you di -- you -- you told already on the other interview, but I didn\u2019t -- I --",
        "A: Yeah, okay [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Who were your friends in this?",
        "A: Well, th -- in the beginning, all my fre -- you see, my family, I had a large family,\nand my family was very, very not helpful. Like -- also, we came to America, you see -\n- wh-when we wanted to go to Palestine in this time, and I wanted to go to America if\nwe cannot go to Palestine, because I said that all the cousins are my age. Why? See,\nmy father was the youngest from -- from the brothers, I was the youngest from us. And\nthey had children and the children were my age. I said, I have cousins. This uncle has\nchildren, this uncle has children. So they were -- we will be close. They were very --\nthey never invited us. We were strange to them. And -- and 1n -- th-they were -- the\nchildren were rich, they didn\u2019t give me jobs. And we asked them for it. Now, the\nreason why is because they looked on us with the eyes as they will see their parents\ncame when they came in 1885 - 1890. When they came in 18 ni -- in 1890, they came\nfrom a village. They never wore shoes in the village. They were not educated. They\ncame over here when they were 14 -- eight -- 14 - 15 - 16 years, and they had to start\n53February 9, 2001\nin -- in the -- in -- they never made out of -- of their life something. One was a presser,\none was a tailor, one was a button hole maker. The children already were educated --\nwere [indecipherable]. So they looked at us, they didn\u2019t realize that we had a\nprogress. America also had a progress. America in 1947 was not the same as in 1885.\nBut they looked at us with the stories what their parents told us -- told them. So we\nwere never their friends -- they were never -- which we expected to be liked. For\ninstance, there is one woman, she still a -- she\u2019s 94 years now, and she was my first\ncousin, her name was Frances. And I was already six months here and I didn\u2019t see\nFrances and I knew the stories about Frances, because she was a older woman, she\nwas already 32 years and she wasn\u2019t married. So my father, everything was on his\nmind. So he always, my father, when he had problems, when he thinks\n[indecipherable] so he used ta -- take his beard, and he used to chew his beard. So\nwhen he chews his beard, so we said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He said Frances. He got a\nletter Frances wasn\u2019t married, she\u2019s already 32 years. He always worried about\nFrances. So when Frances -- when I was [indecipherable] then later she got married,\nshe had a daughter. I was six months, so once I called up Frances. I says, \u201cFrances,\nI\u2019m already here six months, and -- and my father always worried about you, and I\nwanted to see you.\u201d She was a daughter of my father\u2019s sister. So she said, \u201cOh yeah.\u201d\nThis was a Sunday, and I had already -- I spent five cents for a telephone call. She\n54\nFebruary 9, 2001\nsaid, \u201cYeah, I would like to see you too, come over sometimes.\u201d So I says, \u201cFrances,\nwhy should I come over sometimes? Today is Sunday, I don\u2019t work, my wife doesn\u2019t\nwork. Why can\u2019t we come over today?\u201d Because she lived in Brooklyn too. She said,\n\u201cOh, I already have some friends coming to my house.\u201d When she said to me this, I-I -\n- | -- I didn\u2019t say anything, I hung up. Now, if she had friends, this was the best time to\ninvite us, we should be -- and we should know fre -- so what, she was afraid to show\noff with the -- the greener animals, or those things, so this was their feeling. Now, my\nwife was more educated than they. Now, for instance, in the beginning they were very\n-- they were angry at me why I -- I got married. So my wife was beautiful, she was\nvery intelligent, she spoke seven languages, and everything -- they didn\u2019t -- so -- so\nthey said -- even my brother said to me, \u201cWhy do you have to rush? You are a young\nfellow, you are not so bad looking, you could marry here a woman. All right, maybe\nshe would be a -- a divorc\u00e9e, or a -- maybe she\u2019Il be a little older, but she will have\ntwo houses, she will have a business, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry, you wouldn\u2019t have\nto start for scratch, why do you have to marry?\u201d Now, I couldn\u2019t understand instead to\nbe happy, that I brought over my wife, that she was prettier than they, she was more\nintelligent than they, she was smarter than they, she survived the war. So they said,\nwhy did you have to rush, why ya -- and I was 27 years. You see, th -- the -- there was\nno feeling, there was no understanding. There was only this one elderly -- the -- the\n55\nFebruary 9, 2001\none, the poor brother, Shulem we called him. He was the one nice guy. From the rest,\nthere was no -- see, my wife\u2019s family was different. My wife\u2019s family took us in like --\nlike a family. Why? Because they knew them. My wife\u2019s family came in \u201938, so whe --\nthey lived in Berlin. So they knew them, they used to come and visit them\n[indecipherable] they knew them how they lived, they knew them how they went to\nschool, they knew them they were different people. So they took us in like we would\nbe their children, even til today.",
        "Q: Who were your friends then? Did you have any friends at all?",
        "A: Yes, I had friends, mostly we had friends survivors. We fre -- we had a few friends\nwho were survivors, right away I was involved in a group, and people that I knew from\nPoland, and also people who were very appreciative what I did for them in Poland,\nand -- and we remained friends til today. And -- and the only thing is that now all\nthose people are dying out. They\u2019re dying out but -- but we still have this, and even\ntoday, mostly we -- we are close mostly with people who are survivors. We have some\nwho are not, neighbors, this, but 1-it\u2019s not a deep friendship as -- because they cannot\nunderstand. And -- and -- the -- the -- the -- look, I belong, see I-I\u2019m -- I am different\nthan my wife. My wife, she b -- she does -- if she belongs to organization, she just\npays the dues and that\u2019s it. And if I belong to organization, I have to be active. I used\nto be president from my Kobulshovera [indecipherable] from the town. I am still\n56\nFebruary 9, 2001\npresident from the Israeli Red Cross. I\u2019m president from here, I\u2019m president -- why?\nBecause if I am involved, I have to be involved, otherwise I don\u2019t want to bother. My\nwife -- now, from all those groups that -- that I am involved with the organizations, we\nhave friends, but we are, I don\u2019t know, so close as with the people who are survivors.\nFor instance, last year I had a very big -- things happened. I bi -- the B\u2019nai Brith --\nyou know what B\u2019nai Brith -- and I used to be very active, and I am still -- and we\nhave a -- a board from the local B\u2019nai Brith, and -- and once a month we have a\nmeeting, and -- and then once we always make a, once a year, on one of the meetings\nwe have a film. And we show the film and the people come and the m -- the\nmembership, not only the board. So when th-the president said, let\u2019s have a film, I saw\na film from Woody Allen. And Woody Allen, a wonderful comedy, let\u2019s have a film\nfrom him. I -- I don\u2019t like Woody Allen as a human being, I don\u2019t like him as a Jew, I\ndon\u2019t like him at all, because he\u2019s too -- he\u2019s -- so I said why should we have Woody\nAllen\u2019s film? It so happens that I got a new film, it\u2019s called, \u201cThe Rescuers,\u201d maybe\nyou saw it. And \u201cThe Rescuers\u201d is a wonderful film, it is -- the first is a Polish girl, a\nPolish woman who was -- took a -- a Jewish boy for two years. The father of the\nJewish boy was a doctor, the mother was lawyer, but anyway, they became -- she was\na nanny for the boy, and they were taken away and they were killed, and they gave the\nboy to the -- this woman. And she promised them to -- that she will save it. And it\n57\nFebruary 9, 2001\nshows the whole film how she save it, her problems she had. She survived the war and\nthe boy went to pales -- to Israel, and she went with him to Israel. She never changed\nher religion. She\u2019s Catholic, but she wanted to be with the boy, and the boy is happy,\nhe studied. Beautiful story. And then the second story is about the French woman, a\nFrench woman, she never ge -- never saw Jews. And in her village there was -- they --\nthey started -- those were -- how you call the French that they who -- who --\nHuguenots?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] Huguenots.",
        "A: Yeah, so they were very friendly and they took in about 40 Jews, Jewish children,\nand the whole village tried to save them. And this girl, she was a young girl, worked --\na secretary by the bishop. And -- and -- and she helped -- and she saved about 40. It\u2019s a\nbeautiful -- you know. So I said let\u2019s show the -- it\u2019s not a bloody thing that people\ndon\u2019t want to see. It is a human interest, like two girls, two persons, two women, how\nthey saved the Jews, it\u2019s very beautiful. And when I said it, let\u2019s have this film. So one\nguy was sitting there, he said, \u201cStop with this crap of the Holocaust. Only I hear is this\ncrap the Holocaust, Holocaust, I have it til here. Isn\u2019t it time we shouldn\u2019t talk about\nthe Holocaust?\u201d When he started to say crap, crap, Holocaust, either I -- I was so numb\nthat I couldn\u2019t answer him, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Then later when I felt better, so I\nopened my mouth. I said, \u201cYou call the Holocaust crap? Six million Jews were killed.\n58\nFebruary 9, 2001\nIt was just yesterday, I\u2019m still alive. A million and a half children. And -- and you\nshould say it on a Jewish -- in a Jewish organization, B\u2019nai Brith?\u201d And I -- and --\nand, so he said, \u201cWell we suffered too.\u201d I says, \u201cWhen did you suffer?\u201d She -- you --\nyou didn\u2019t have enough steak, you had to eat chicken?\u201d Because they would not have -\n- and I walked out and I said, \u201cI am not coming here any more.\u201d Now, it didn\u2019t -- not\nso much that this idiot said stop with this crap, with the always -- there were 18\npeople, and nobody said a word. None of them opened their mouth. And after this I\nwrote a letter to the international president, he never answered me, and to the people I\ndidn\u2019t go back. So I -- and those were mostly American who -- I said, you have here\nyour family, your fathers, your mothers, your children are here, your grandchildren are\nhere. Those people didn\u2019t suffer. And [indecipherable] for him, it is enough. We\ntalked about the Holocaust enough. So -- so you ask about friends. I feel comfortable\nwhen I am between somebody -- now, I was very active -- now I\u2019m not so active. We\nhave the Vagra, the Warsaw uprise organization. Every year -- every year we make a\ncommemoration in the -- used to be Madison Square Garden. And I was the chairman\nfrom the arrangement and security. And I was -- I was very much involved, because\nwe had all people survivors. And with survivors I can feel -- today in the morning\nsomebody called me up, a man, and he tells me a story, her survive. He was very\nhappy to talk to me, and I was happy to talk to me, because we went through different\n59February 9, 2001\nways, but we always went through the same. He lost a family, I lost a family. So but --\nbut American Jews, they are s -- now, there are some that they -- like for instance, in\nour Temple, they\u2019re making a commemoration about the Holocaust. Few people come,\nand it\u2019s not -- they didn\u2019t want to go through it.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s make me the connection to the beginning then, when you came to America,\nwhen you spoke, and you always spoke, I think.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did -- did people know about it, did they want to hear about it?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want to hear it. No, they wanted -- they always thought that I am\nobsessed and they didn\u2019t want to hear it, and they -- they avoided me. They avoided\nme because I spoke about it. They didn\u2019t want to know, and -- and -- and they didn\u2019t\nwant to hear, and I always spoke, and I told them stories. Some people didn\u2019t say\nanything -- I mean, the survivors -- then, because they didn\u2019t want to listen to people.\nThen later, in -- in -- in the 70\u2019s, in the -- with Eichmann\u2019s trial, films came out, then\nthe people started to be a little more interested, and then they learned about it. But in\nthe beginning -- like for instance, my family. They didn\u2019t want to know. They -- now, I\nhave a other -- I had the man that he had the nieces and nephews and he ask me all\nkind of questions, so I ask him, you ask me all kind of questions, but you never ask me\nabout the nieces, about your nephews, about other -- oh yeah, I had in mind to -- to ask\n60February 9, 2001\nyou this. I said, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d They didn\u2019t want to listen, they didn\u2019t want to hear.\nAnd they -- when I tell stories, they said -- they avoided me, because I am obsessed\nwith the Holocaust.",
        "Q: And that was from both, that was American and then non -- non-Jewish, but also\nJewish community didn\u2019t really want to --",
        "A: Well, the non-Jewish, it was -- no, I was not in contact so, about non-Jews, and I\ndidn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t tell them, but I\u2019m talking about Jewish from organizations when I --\nwe came. Then later, it became our -- I\u2019m starting to be invited and -- to schools, to\npublic schools. Now, for instance, the 27\", what is -- next week. The [indecipherable]\nI have to go to George Washington University, I was there last year, and they invited\nme again, I should come to speak. So I am staying there two days, and -- in\nWashington. Now, a few months ago I was invited to Norfolk, Virginia, to speak\nthere for a Jewish central organizations. Now, I spoke in one school, then later there\nare three schools, so each one invited me to his school. So I was [indecipherable]\ninstead one day, I was there three days. Also they invite me that I should speak\nbecause I don\u2019t take money for it. Like for instance, in same school in Norfolk,\nVirginia, Elie Wiesel was there about two weeks before me, and he took 25,000\ndollars. So -- so I said -- he spoke a half an hour, and I didn\u2019t take anything and I\nspoke three hours. So -- so I told them, there is no business like show business -- not\n61\nFebruary 9, 2001\nshow business -- like -- not show-a -- like Shoah business. You know, Shoah is -- gets\n25,000 dollars. Look, somebody said, he is at the normal price, but still, takes a lot of\nmoney.",
        "Q: You did tell me in the first interview about a story when -- when you heard in\nsynagogue that a rabbi -- rabbi said they didn\u2019t really know what was happening, and\nyou had researched it, and you saw --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Could you tell that story?",
        "A: Yeah, this was in the beginning, and the -- when I spoke about the Holocaust, and\nso then the rabbi said, well the people, they said, we didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know if it\n-- I say -- in the -- so if we didn\u2019t know -- and so I went to the [indecipherable] daily\n[indecipherable] and they had microfilms from -- so I picked out microfilms from the\ntime, from 1942, because there where the mass killings started. And in the microfilms\nI had all articles, every day, this camp and this camp in this town, this\n[indecipherable]. They\u2019re making copies -- I made copies, and I came back to -- to\nthe same synagogue, and I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Here it is. You knew, but you\ndidn\u2019t read it.\u201d If -- there was an English paper, and if the English paper put it 1n on the\n15\" page, a little this, so -- but in the Jewish paper, it was always written down and --\nand in the -- and you -- you knew it. Now, there 1s also -- there 1s also -- I told them\n62\nFebruary 9, 2001\nthat people were not interested, because in the same paper, it was -- well, 3,000 Jews\nwere killed in this town. In just the next page, it -- it says 3,000 stocks were -- were\nsold yesterday on the stock market. In the same breath, you speak about 3,000 Jews,\nand 3,000 shares of stocks from this company. But in the beginning -- and I -- I -- my\nbr --",
        "Q: So -- so you think it was difficult for people to -- to unders -- to kind of put it\ntogether, or --",
        "A: No, e -- e -- well, not that it was differ -- difficult, they didn\u2019t want to believe -- and\nnobody could understand, even til today, how could a thing like this happen. Here,\nwhen -- when you see a -- even now, when you see a disaster in India, it\u2019s a terrible\ndisaster, where 12,000 people, 14,000 were killed. It was a disaster made by God, not\nby people. And here, when you take a town, like my wife\u2019s town, in one day they\nkilled 12,000 people. Killing 12,000 people for -- for no reason at all. And this was in\nevery town, not in one town. How can a human mind comprehend this? Now, a -- a --\nit\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- I don\u2019t know if sa -- you heard about it, there\u2019s a Dr. Gross, you know,\na gt -- he\u2019s a professor in -- in New York, NYU. He\u2019s a very good friend, because he\nedited one of my books. So this Dr. Gross, he\u2019s from Poland, his father was a judge in\nKrakow, a Jew, and he married a non-Jew, a Polish, and she helped him to survive.\nHe was born after the war, he started in Warsaw. Now he came here, he\u2019s here. Now,\n63February 9, 2001\nhe made the study -- he made the study about -- about killing of -- so there is a town,\nJedwabne, a small town near Warsaw. In Jedwabne were 18,000 Jews -- no, a\nthousand eight hun -- 1800 Jews. In Jedwabne in one day, all the Jews were pushed in\nin a barn, and they were all burned to death in one day. Now, peppel -- people knew\nthat this was in the time of the Germans, that the -- that the Germans -- that the\nGermans did it, right? So -- but this was -- he went, and he -- he -- he had some\ninclinations that it wasn\u2019t done by the Germans, so he went to Jedwabne, he found\nthere witnesses, Polish witnesses. Then he found out that two Jews from Jedwabne\nsurvived there in Israel, he went to Israel and he wrote the book, I have the book, and\nhe -- the book is called -- just came out, it\u2019s called , \u201cSasiedzi\u201d in Polish. \u201cSasiedzi\u201d\nmeans Neighbors. And he describes that the 1800 people were killed by Poles. The\nPole -- the Germans were there, they were standing there, they saw it, but they didn\u2019t\ninterfere because they were very happy somebody else is doing it. So the Polish people\nkilled all the Jews from their town where they lived together three, four hundred years.\nAnd they burned -- they pushed them in, and then he described the owner of the barn,\nand the owner of the barn said he didn\u2019t want to do it, that they forced him. Some were\nlater arrested. They pushed them in, they poured gasoline and they burned all alike.\nNow if you -- in -- in the -- in the book is so -- now, wh-wh-what he describes, that\nbefore they pushed in, there was a child. The Poles were standing with knives and they\n64\nFebruary 9, 2001\ntook out the eyes from the children, and they threw in the children. Now, they knew\nthat they will be killed. Why did they have to do it in the -- it\u2019s such bestiality, such\nterrible thing. Now, the book just came out, so I told him the book has -- I want to\ntranslate it. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s being now translated into English, and into Hebrew.\u201d So it\nwill come out maybe 1n a month or two months. But the English version came out last\nmonth.",
        "Q: Did -- did you want to have children?",
        "A: I wanted to have -- when we got -- when we got together in Poland, we didn\u2019t want\nto have children. Course we beli -- we spoke about it, and we decided we don\u2019t want to\nbring in children to such a world because we wouldn\u2019t know what happened in -- and\nlike my sisters, all the children, they were killed, so why should we bring in children\ninto world? And then in -- so we didn\u2019t want. Then later when we came to America,\nso we figured we are now in America, it\u2019s a different country and everything, we want\nto have children. So it took us 11 years, we -- we didn\u2019t have a child. After 11 years\nwe ha -- we wanted to adopt, but I didn\u2019t want to adopt on the black market. So we\nwent to a doctor, and the doctor to see if there\u2019s something wrong with me, or with my\nwife, and the doctors, well they said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you two. So we don\u2019t\nhave the children. So we want to ad -- adopt not with black markets and we went to a\nlegitimate Steven Bryce adoption. And we want to adopt, we made the application, it\n65\nFebruary 9, 2001\ntook about a year, and they gave a case wer -- a worker, and she was very nice, and --\nand she told us that they will approve it. And one day, which was before\nThanksgiving, she come to our house, and this time we lived in Brooklyn, she saw the\napartment, and we showed her we have one room reserved, and we going to put it for a\n-- for a child. And she and I made already in this time a good living. My wife was a\nteacher, and I had a good business already. I still was a peddler. And she said, \u201cI think\nyou will have a very good Thanksgiving,\u201d because they were ready to give us a child.\nAnd we says, \u201cWell, we prefer if we can get a girl.\u201d We wanted to have a girl. And\nthen, befo -- before about two months and before she said that probably we\u2019 ll have it,\nsh -- they switched her and we got the other worker. And the first minute when she\ncame to house, we saw right away that she\u2019s not the same person. She looked at my\nwife and she was -- we saw that she is very jealous. And the way she talked to my\nwife, and my wife was maybe prettier, we had a nice apartment. And -- and she was\nnot so nice as the other one to us. And then later we got a letter that we were rejected.\nIt was a very terrible shock to us. And the reason why we\u2019re rejected is because they\ndon\u2019t -- they -- they don\u2019t believe that we, after going through so much, that we are\nnormal people, that we will be able to bring up a child like in a normal home. And this\nwas the terrible thing. I had people who wrote letters, people who I helped very much -\n- like, for instance, there was a Dr. Rosenhow, he was one of the biggest professors in\n66February 9, 2001\nthe world, and I did a lot of things for him. He was in this time a professor in\nColumbia, he was a very -- a international known eye doctor. So I told him this, so he\nwrote a letter, and some other [indecipherable] what I did to him -- for him. And --\nand there was other men, but then they said once it\u2019s rejected, nobody can correct it.\nBut nothing wrong with us, the only thing that they don\u2019t think that we will be able to\nbring up a child. If -- well, anyway. So then I said I have no -- I have no choice, so we\nfind somebody that we can get a child on the black market, and we got in touch with a\nwoman from Philadelphia, and in this time she said for 8,000 dollars we can get a\nchild. And so we agreed, and I gave no money in advance. She said the minute when\nthey was here -- we told her we want to have a newborn child, and if -- a -- a girl, and\nif she will have it, I will come and pick it up and gi-give her the money.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\n67February 9, 2001\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: -- well, anyway. So then I said I have no -- I have no choice, so we find somebody\nthat we can get a child on the black market, and we got in touch with a woman from\nPhiladelphia, and in this time she said for 8,000 dollars we can get a child. And so we\nagreed, and I gave no money in advance. She said the minute when they was here --\nwe told her we want to have a newborn child, and if -- a -- a girl, and if she will have\nit, I will come and pick it up and gi-give her the money. We received a letter -- a -- a\ntelephone from her, so she said, \u201cCome to Philadelphia, a child was born today, in\nthree days come, you can pick up the child.\u201d When I got the cel -- telephone, about\nfour days before, my wife went to the doctor, and he made a rabbit test, and he says\nthat she is pregnant -- well, a few days before. Naturally we told her that we change\nour mind, and Esther was born. Then after -- after this she was pregnant about three\ntimes, she had miscarriages. Cause I wanted to have a large family, cause we were\nnine children. So she -- so that we were thinking about adoption, then later we decided\nno, because if we have one our daughter, we\u2019d -- we didn\u2019t think that we will have the\nsame feeling for some -- for adopted child. If we wouldn\u2019t have our own, so maybe we\ncould adopt two. But once we have our own, so we thought we will deprive Esther. So\nshe was -- a few times she had miscarriages, and this 1s it.\n68\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: Did you have particular hopes or values that you wanted to instill in your -- in your\nchild, for Esther?",
        "Q: Hopes and values? Yes. Hope of -- the first hopes and values is to -- to install in her\na value of Judaism. Not a value of Judaism, about religion, God, but to be proud being\na Jew, what the Jews did. This what I am proud, what the Jews did, fa -- through the\n4,000 years since Abraham, what they did to human beings, what they did to the\nworld, including the 10 commandments, including Jesus, even. That -- how come that\n-- that -- even with the Catholics, when they believe, said God picked out Mary to\nhave a child, that God is a father, how come she didn\u2019t go to a -- to a Spanish woman,\nor to a Polish woman, or to a Irish woman and have a child -- if -- 1f I would believe\nwhat a Catholic believes. And to have a child with -- with -- with one of those\nnationality. So why did He pick out a Jewish girl, to have a child with a Jewish girl?\nSo probably there is something more to it. Now -- which I don\u2019t believe in all those\nthings. Now, I believe in Jesus, far as a human being. Now, he was -- if Jesus\nwouldn\u2019t be made now, the religion was made 200 years later they started to write. If\nJesus wouldn\u2019t be made a God, he would be a prophet by the Jews, because he was a -\n-a--a--aman that he tried to help the underdog. His friends were fishermen,\nshepherds, prostitutes, all those things because he wanted to help them. He was a very\nethical man. And so I believe in this, but I don\u2019t believe that Jesus had anything to do\n69\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwith God. I mean, he was a religious man. Jesus was a Nazere, a naze -- I don\u2019t know\nif you know what means a Nazere. A Nazere means that he didn\u2019t want to have too\nmuch pleasure from a life on this world. Like -- like he -- he never cut his hair, he\nnever drink whiskey, he never had a woman. Well, those were as people, and Jesus\nwas one of these. You -- you cut it off?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Now I -- I don\u2019t know if I told you last time I had a grandfather. My grandfather\nwas a very, very pious Jew, he was a very learned Jew, he was very well known that\nhe was one of the biggest scholars. In 1875 he wrote a book, and the book was in -- in\n-- Jesus in -- [indecipherable] means Jesus from Nazareth. He wrote it in Hebrew,\nand this book was never published. And I remember we had one manuscript home,\nwritten by hand, beautiful written. I would give everything if I would have to take that\nbook, but the book got lost. And he wrote it in -- in this time, a Jew to write about\nJesus, it was sacrilegious because the Jew -- the Jews even didn\u2019t want to mention\nJesus\u2019s name. So he wrote about him, and he -- this what he explained. He explains\nthat Jesus was born, and he was -- he had a very, very hard childhood because all his\nfriends they used to call him names because he was born out of wedlock. So they used\nto call him -- in Hebrew is mumser. Mumser means somebody who was born in --\nwithout a father. So a -- he was very bitter because he knew that he was born -- his\n70\nFebruary 9, 2001\nmother was not married to je -- to Joseph in this time. But as a human being, he was a\nwonderful human being. He was very compassionate, as -- but so f -- and he was very\nreligious. So to me that the Jews -- this what I try to -- what the Jews gave to -- to the\nworld, now take in -- in our time, the biggest doctors, the biggest thinkers, the biggest\nmusicians, everything is Jewish, I am very proud of it. \u2019'm very proud of our heritage\nduring all the time of the religion and their history. But I stop a little when it comes to\nGod, I stop because I have questions, and I don\u2019t know if I believe in God, if I don\u2019t\nbelieve in God. I don\u2019t want to think about it, but if I believe, I\u2019m very angry at Him.\nBecause if -- like they say, if He rolled -- runs the world, and if He rules everything,\nhow -- where was He when they pushed in 4,000 people in a cha -- in a gas chamber in\nAuschwitz, and the -- the crying and everything, He didn\u2019t hear it. If He didn\u2019t hear it,\nand He didn\u2019t help, so probably He couldn\u2019t help. And if He couldn\u2019t help, well who --\nwho needs Him? So the -- but I -- but this isn\u2019t -- but Esther is more religious that we\nare, because she doesn\u2019t have this experience. She doesn\u2019t ask God why didn\u2019t He do\nthis, why didn\u2019t He this, why didn\u2019t He help my mother. So she is more religious, not\nthe way religious she wi -- not to eat pork, she will eat pork. Not to drive on Saturday,\nshe will drive Saturday. But, as a Jew, she is religious and I told her if she will have\nchildren, if the children will go to a religious school I pay for it, and I do. For all the\n71February 9, 2001\nthree children, they go to Saloman Schachter, I pay for it. So Iam very, very proud\nwhat the Jews accomplished.",
        "Q: Did you talk to her about --about your war experience, about the Holocaust?",
        "A: I spoke to her about the Holocaust, but I -- I think -- this what my wife\u2019s opinion 1s,\nthat I -- I spoiled a lot, because I started to talk to her too early. I started to speak to her\nwhen she was small, and then she was so fed up that she tried to push it away. Even til\ntoday, there are organizations from second generations and this, and we told her to\njoin, to be active, she is not. And this what she said, because she was exposed too early\nto it. And then later, she tried to push it away. But I -- she knows it from since she was\nfour or five years. And then later when I did with the grandchildren, she told me the\nsame thing, not to try to spoil it, and not to try to influence and talk so much about it\nwhen they are too small.",
        "Q: What -- how -- how did you tell it to her? Did you make it into some kind of\nbedtime stories --",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t, not the bedtime stories. But I told her that -- that I may -- about the\nfive sisters I had, and about the children. Now there 1s -- there 1s -- in the sign -- the\nnew book I\u2019m writing, there\u2019s some stories comparing Esther with the -- with my\nsister -- sister\u2019s children. See, my sister\u2019s children I love so much that -- like they\nwould be my children because we lived together. We lived together, we always -- we -\n72\nFebruary 9, 2001\n- especially in the ghetto we were together. And the children [indecipherable] and\nthey looked up to me. If I went out from the ghetto I took off my band there, and they\nlooked up to me, and I always brought them one, when they didn\u2019t have no -- an apple,\nthey didn\u2019t [indecipherable] or a plum or something when I came from a trip, or\nsomething, I smuggled it in and I gave it to them, so they waited for it. And -- and I\nwas an -- the hero for them. Naturally in this time I was not in the underground, but\nstill, I was the one that I -- that I brought them something, candy, a piece of chocolate,\nin the ghetto. But later, naturally, they were -- and they were very young, like -- like\none sister I had a girl come three and a half years and got killed, and one was two\nyears. One -- the other sister had a boy three and a half years and the other was two\nyears. And then I had a niece, and the niece was three years younger than I. And my\nbrother had the three children. One was 12, one was 10 and the girl was eight when\nthey were killed. But I was very, very attached to the children, and -- and now it\u2019s\nthinking back it\u2019s like -- like I almost -- we all were very attached, the whole family,\nbecause we lived together and my father -- if I had a sister got married, he didn\u2019t let\nthem move away from our town, they stayed in our town, he opened a business for the\nnew son-in-law. Each daughter got -- he bought them -- he gave them a dowry, and\nthen later he bought them a house. He was well off, he could do it. But we were like --\n73\nFebruary 9, 2001\nlike -- even when they married, the -- there was no difference, they were like they\nwould be home.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go back to Esther for just a minute. Was -- she was an only child, and\nshe also did not have any -- did she ask for grandparents --",
        "A: She oh -- [tape break]",
        "Q: -- ask you this again. Talk about her missing grandparents, and --",
        "A: Yeah, when she was small she was very unhappy because she always ask question,\nhow come all her friends have grandparents, have aunts, and she doesn\u2019t have. And\ncame Sunday they came to visit. So as a matter of fact, she had a friend across the\nstreet, and -- and they -- she had two sets of grandparents. So she ask how come she\nhas two er -- sets, and I don\u2019t have even one? So naturally we told her that they were\nkilled, and where are they, they are in heaven. So then later she made up with this\nfriend that she said she should give her one set of grandparent. So they said yes, we\nadopt you. And every time when they came over here, so she went to visit them, and --\nand -- and she se -- but she knew that it is not grandparents, but she knew -- and they\nsaid we -- we will be your grandparents, and -- because Ellen has two sets, so you will\nhave one. But she always was very unhappy that she doesn\u2019t have grandparents. Then\nlater she got older, so she realized then -- then -- in the beginning, when then en -- she\nwas very small, so we told her where are they. So we said they were killed, bad men\n74\nFebruary 9, 2001\ncame and killed them. And -- and -- but then later, naturally, when I told her about the\n-- about the war, so maybe I told her too earlier, and she was like pushed away because\nshe le -- realized it when she was four or five, six years. It was a little too early.",
        "Q: I want to ask you another question that has to do with your jobs again. So later on\nyou went into contru -- into construction business, and you made good money, you had\na successful firm. And then your family kind of liked you in a different way.",
        "A: No, no, they -- I didn\u2019t say that they liked me, beca --",
        "Q: No, no, I\u2019m sorry. You -- you to -- you just told me a story that they made you\npresident of the family circle --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- I just wondered whether you could say --",
        "A: Yeah, well, no, because you see, in America the money talks. So they di -- I don\u2019t\nthink so they liked me more, maybe some hated me more, because they were jealous.\nSo they -- because -- and I give you other example, I had an uncle and his son went\nhere to college, and he hardly made a living. So they came to -- when I moved in in the\nnew apartment, and -- and I had new -- right away new furniture, so I told him, well,\nwe try to fix it up, but we not finished yet. I purposely said it. So she -- so I see she\njumped in there to her husband, she says, \u201cSee, see? And my son went to college and\nlook at him. He just came over here, he has already a beautiful apartment, he has a\n75\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbusiness, and he is already fixed up.\u201d Now, they were very, very, very jealous, but\nthey said when they spoke to somebody else, and they said, \u201cOh Norman is doing all\nright.\u201d So they always said, \u201cOh yeah, we put him on his feet.\u201d Which they didn\u2019t do\nanything. And there are occasions that -- that -- what they did. Like for instance, I had\none cousin, and they -- he inherited from his father, he had a very big factory, and they\nmade all kind of children\u2019s underwear. So -- and I -- I was in this time in the remnant\nbusiness, so -- and he had s -- in the factory he sold remnants, so I went to him and I\nsaid to him, I buy remnants. Now h -- and he sold it to a dealer, so he probably charge\n50 cents a pound, and later I bought it and I paid four dollars a pound. So I said why\ncan\u2019t I buy direct? And he was a cousin, so he said, \u201cWell, I would sell it to you, but\nyou have to bring me a statement from the bank. See, we do only business with\nsomebody who could send me a financial statement. If you bring me the bank, that you\nhave in the bank 25,000 dollars, and [indecipherable] we will do business.\u201d So I said,\n\u201cT don\u2019t have 25,000 dollars.\u201d So I had to buy his remnants and pay instead a half a\ndollar, I had to pay four dollars. And I made a very small profit, which I could make a\nlot of profit. All right. Then about 10 years later, when I was already selling furniture,\nI established myself, so this man opened a lot of -- a few discount houses. So once I\nwent in and I said to him, \u201cYou know, in this discount house you don\u2019t have furniture.\nI\u2019m -- I sell furni -- why don\u2019t you give me a call and then I\u2019Il bring in kitchen sets and\n76\nFebruary 9, 2001\nother things, we can make a lot of money, you will be a partner.\u201d So -- and I will have\n-- and I could make a big business. So he said, \u201cYeah, well it\u2019s a very good idea, but\nyou have to bring me that you have in the bank at least hundred thousand dollars,\notherwise how could we do business with you?\u201d So I said to him, \u201cYou know what? In\nfive years I will come back to you, because this way I will make money. The first time\nyou wanted 20, I didn\u2019t have it. So now I have 20, you wanted hundred, I don\u2019t have it.\nMaybe in five years we come -- I will come to you, you\u2019ll ask for a half a million\ndollars, but I already will have the hundred thousand dollars. So I will keep coming to\nyou and I will raise my capital.\u2019\u2019 Naturally, he never let me have the furniture, and I\nnever did it, and -- and it\u2019s -- and this -- this how it was. Is a -- now there I have a\nother --",
        "Q: T-Tell me -- tell me the story though about the family circle, because that\u2019s also\nvery telling.",
        "A: Oh, well the family circle, then when I started to make a good living, and then we\nhad a family circle. Before nobody wanted to know me, and [indecipherable] would -\n- wanted to -- to have anything to do with me -- with it. Then later, one -- one time\nwhen we had a meeting, we had a meeting once a month in a restaurant. They had to\npick out a new president, so they picked me out for a president for -- for the family\ncircle. And there were a -- a lot of people. And then to make a president, so two people\n77\nFebruary 9, 2001\ncame to me and they took me under the arm, they ca -- they went with me to the\npodium, and then -- and they introduce me, and I am the family circle. So in this time I\nbrought my wife the furs -- mink stole. And mink stole was very fashionable, but in\nthe beginning this was very expensive, not everybody had it. So I took my wife\u2019s mink\nstole and I spre -- and I spread it and I hold it, and I said to meet the new president of\nthe family circle. They looked at me. So I said, \u201cYeah, the mink stole is the president,\nbut wouldn\u2019t I be able to buy my wife a mink stole, I would never be a president of the\nfamily circle.\u201d So naturally they didn\u2019t like -- also they didn\u2019t like it because a lot of\ntimes I said something what they didn\u2019t like. So ab -- but I didn\u2019t care. So -- so I was --\nI was a president for the -- for the family circle. And --",
        "Q: Let me -- let me ask you this because it -- it fits right now with what you sort of\nsaid. When I ask you about the achievements -- I mean, you have had a long work life\nhere, and you have built things. You have a family now, you have built things. When I\nask you what -- what do you consider the -- the achievements here, in this country, for\nyou?",
        "A: Well, the achievements in this country, the first thing is that I had a daughter. This\nis the main -- th-this is the highlife -- the highlight, because wouldn\u2019t I have a\ndaughter, my life wouldn\u2019t be worth anything, because why did I survive? To have a\ncontinuation. The Jews lived for so many years, and I had to have a continuation. Now\n78\nFebruary 9, 2001\nshe -- I have a daughter, she has three grandsons. So it means that Hitler didn\u2019t win\nthe war. With me he didn\u2019t win the war, because his -- to win the war, it means to an --\nan -- to destroy every single Jew, and with me he couldn\u2019t do it. Now, we had a town\nvery few -- only -- only four people survived ous -- from my town. Now all the people\nwhen I look back -- when I look back and I -- there were families, the families\nstretched 300 years, nobody survived. And then when they killed the last one -- so it\nmeans they just destroyed everything. And with me, I didn\u2019t. My father had me, and I\nhave Esther, Esther has the children, and the generation goes on. I -- I\u2019m very -- a\nlittle disappointed in -- not disappointed, I feel bad that I don\u2019t have a son, and the\nreason why, because by Jews, there is a sect, and we call it kohanim. The kohanim\ndescend from the priestly family. Now this started, the first Cohen was Aaron -- a\nCohen, Moses\u2019 brother. This is a -- 4,000 years. And a son came after the father, after\nthe father, and it was never change, because the Jews how -- not religious -- I mean,\nthey were not religious, but this they obeyed, that a son should be a Cohen after a\nfather. Now this went on for 4,000 years til 1t came to me. Now, I don\u2019t know how\nmany forefathers were killed because they were Jews, probably a lot. My father was\nkilled because I -- because he was a Jew. But I remained, and I took his place. Who\nknows, maybe his forefathers were killed by the Crusaders in the [indecipherable].\nWe don\u2019t know. So because it lasted for so -- for 4,000 years, and it never -- the string,\n79\nFebruary 9, 2001\nthe lineage was never cut off. And so not being a Cohen 1s cut off by me, because a\ndaughter is not -- she herself is a Cohen, a daughter of a Cohen, but her children are\nnot any more. So this I am a little disappointed, because I would like this lineage\nshould be long, and it should be til the end of time. But it isn\u2019t, but Iam happy. And\nthey are -- they are the three boys, and -- and they should know that they are very\nproud to be Jews. And if -- if -- if one of them would marry out of religion, this will be\nthe worst thing for me, I don\u2019t know if I could survive it. Not because era -- oh -- I bel\n-- I told you this before, not because about not being religious, but not being a Jew,\nbecause there was a man, there was a nation, they want a -- nea -- hel -- a -- destroy all\nthe Jews, and I said no, I want to be alive. And through me -- not only me, and others,\nsaid we are going around, we going a -- we are here, we establish a country, we in -- in\nAmerica. We are Jews, and we did so much for -- for the world, that I want the\ncontinuation should be.",
        "Q: Maybe that\u2019s already enough, but if you have other things that you consider an\nachievement --",
        "A: Well, this 1s a achievement about having a family. So now, also achievement is that\nI will leave a few books. And this is very important for me because -- see, I don\u2019t\nmake money on the books, and I\u2019m not interested to make money. And if -- if -- if I\nget from wha -- book, I get some royalties or something, I send it to the mu -- to the\n80\nFebruary 9, 2001\nmuseum right away, because I don\u2019t need it, I may -- I have enough. But to leave a\nheritage -- now, if I will leave my daughter, a other -- other thousand dollars, or a other\nfive thousand dollars, and I will leave her a book, I much more in -- in -- I -- I\u2019m much\nmore happier. Why? Because the grandchildren will know, well my grandfather wrote\na book, and what do I write, I don\u2019t write jokes, I don\u2019t write -- I write something from\nthe -- our survival. Like -- like if I would have the book from my grandfather who\nwrote about Jesus, even -- [ -- I -- I cannot imagine how he could have courage to\nwrite a book like this. But still he wrote it, he had -- he -- he went out and he -- he had\nguts to do it. So this is also that -- that my -- my s -- my -- what I did with the books is\nvery important. And also that I am [indecipherable] my wife, and -- and my wife is --\nI think we are -- we ra -- we are in love, e -- even we have frictions [indecipherable]\nand -- and the frictions are because she doesn\u2019t tie down the toothpaste like I want it\nshould be down because it\u2019s loose. So we -- we have those kind of arguments. Not\nbecause it\u2019s important things, but small thing [indecipherable] like -- like she likes, in\nwinter for instance, I have a busy day because the whole day she opens the window\nand I close the window. She wants a [indecipherable] minute I come in, I go out, the\nwindow\u2019s open. I close it. So those are -- those are the -- the -- the frictions. But as a\nwhole, I think we agree on everything. We agree with the -- with the -- with the\ngrandchildren. We agree with our daughter, with -- mostly only small things that\n81\nFebruary 9, 2001\notherwise -- and -- and this -- this 1s a achievement, the achievement is that I am alive,\nthat our generation, our heritage is alive, and I am giving -- I prepare a lot of things,\nthe only worry I have is that they will not continue, or they will destroy it. Now, for\ninstance, I told you before about the stamps. I collected the stamps over 50 years, and I\nhave the most beautiful collection. I don\u2019t want to sell it, I don\u2019t want to give it to a\nmuseum. I want my grandchildren should have it, because it is -- the stamps gave me a\nlot of pleasure. I collected it, and it\u2019s worth a lot of money if I sell 1t, and now I get\nnothing, practically for it. As a matter of fact, I told you before, I bought today two\nalbums. I said million times I wouldn\u2019t buy any more, but it comes out something, I\nbuy it. So this is a -- this 1s a very -- a very -- a pleasant thing, and -- and I -- I belong\nto a lot of organizations. Now I started to give up because a lot of times in the evening\nthere are meetings in New York, and -- and I don\u2019t go. Even if I want to go, my wife\ndoesn\u2019t let me go. So this is very rewarding, that I am getting acknowledged, I\u2019m\ngetting plaques, I\u2019m invited to speak. And life goes on. This what is inside me, nobody\nknows, because every night -- there 1s not a night that I shouldn\u2019t thi -- see, I am -- I\nam the United States almost 50 years. 50, or more? \u201947? More than 50, yeah. I never\ndreamt about the United States. Now, I went through, I have my life here and family.\nYou always dream from your life. I never had that dream about the United States. It\ndoesn\u2019t mean that United States was bad for me, in the contrary. United States was\n82February 9, 2001\nvery good for me. Always when I have a dream, it\u2019s always a dream from home,\nbefore the war. Dream from the Holocaust, and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and I\nnever -- I never -- and I\u2019m thinking about life here. I never dreamt about it. Maybe this\nis the way it should be, that you don\u2019t dream from -- from good things where you are\nalive here, but you dream from before. So th-th-the -- I live with the past, and this is\nvery -- it\u2019s not good, but I live with the past in, all right, luckily my wife is also a\nsurvivor. Would I have an American survivor, probably we couldn\u2019t live together -- I\nmean, with American person, because I don\u2019t think so that somebody would take it.\nBut with her, she has the same problem as I, when she dreams, she dreams also about\nher family, about her ho -- about her youth. And -- and this how we going on. I -- I -- I\nam very much interested like I told you in the Temple, I\u2019m not religious, but when it\ncomes to the high holidays, I perform, and I -- I conduct services, I\u2019m singing with the\nchoir, I teach them. Because this is something that it\u2019s in me, it\u2019s a heritage, and I\ndon\u2019t want to let it go.",
        "Q: That was -- that was very important, yeah, you didn\u2019t say that in the other\ninterview. I\u2019ve only two quick questions left --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and then maybe you can play a little music or so.",
        "A: Yeah, okay.\n83\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: I would like to ask you though, what did it mean for you to be in v -- when did you\nfeel comfortable in America, sort of , and -- and what did it mean to you to live in this\ncountry? What does it mean to you be an American?",
        "A: W-Well, to be in America is -- when I came over here, I was very unhappy. And I\nwas unhappy for a few reasons. I will give you an -- an article that it was just\npublished. The first thing, I was very unhappy, I came to a country -- see aft -- would I\ncome straight from a concentration camp, I would be very happy because I would have\nto eat, I wouldn\u2019t be chased. But I already went through a period after the liberation, til\nI escaped, I became already -- I had a chauffeur, my wife had a cook, and I have a\nbodyguard, and I was em -- a-and I was admired, and I had a position, I don\u2019t -- so\nthen, after this, when you came down, it -- and I fell down so drastically to America\nthat I was nothing. What do you mean nothing? I di -- we didn\u2019t know the language, I\ndidn\u2019t know the people, I didn\u2019t have a trade, I didn\u2019t have a job. And -- and it was not\nso -- this that you became -- you became worthless. So in this time, for this reason, I\nwanted to go also to Israel, but I figure Israel it will be -- a -- its -- was a dream, yeah.\nAnd -- and -- and in this time I con -- considered to -- to commit suicide a few times,\nbecause I figured what -- why did I survive? What was -- well, then later I started to\nmake out all right, and -- and -- and I started to belong to organizations and I saw that\nAmerica is giving me more than I ever dreamt, because I was not ex -- am -- nobody\n84February 9, 2001\ncalled me Jew, no -- I was not beaten up, and I could do anything I wanted. So I saw\nthat America is -- and also, e -- I was -- I worked very hard, and I co -- saw -- then I\nbought a house and I could buy a car, and -- and all those things, so til Esther was\nborn I was satisfied, but it was missing a child. Now, when Esther was born, so I think\neverything was completed.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",

So America\nmeant a awful lot t-to me. I just wrote an article, I will give it to you, and I called it\n\u201cMy Three Homelands.\u201d And I describe the three homelands, Poland, amer --",

        "Q: You called it your three homelands.",
        "A: Yeah, \u201cMy Three Homelands,\u201d and I describe it that three homelands, Poland, for\ninstance. Poland was like a stepmother, and I loved Poland and I wanted to be a\npatriot, but Poland didn\u2019t let me love it. I wouldn\u2019t -- I wanted to go to the army, and I\n85\nFebruary 9, 2001\n-- I couldn\u2019t -- this before the war. And -- and -- because I thought we live in p -- in\nPoland -- Jews lived for thousand years, my family lived for 300 years, and I thought\nfor 300 years we could become citizens, but we didn\u2019t. So then I describe -- I will give\nyou this article -- then I describe my second homeland is America. America took me\nin, and nourished me, brought me back to health, and America did everything to -- for\nme that I never dreamt that America would do it for me, so I love America, but my\nthird homeland is Israel. It\u2019s that my soul is in Israel. Even if I live in America it\ndoesn\u2019t mean -- I love America, but Israel is my -- my real home, it\u2019s that -- now,\nwhen I was the first time in Israel, so we had an organization, and after the trip they\nask me -- and I spoke about it, and so they ask me who do you have in Israel, why do\nyou -- and I was so happy to be there, even if I had there a brother. So I said, \u201cWell, I\nhad an awful lot of friends in Israel and I met all my friends. And I was -- I went\nhome.\u201d Who are the friends? So I told them my friends was the Rumbaum.\nRumbaum is -- is a scholar from the Middle Ages, who is buried in the Tiberias.\nMaria Balanessa, a other sage, who 1s buried in -- in -- in -- in -- in Tiberias. There --\nthe founder of Kabbalah, of mystic, was buried in Meron, and so on and so on. Those\nare my best friends. I lived -- I was brought up with them. Then, the new generations\nthat are my friends is Theodor Her -- Herzl, the founder of Zionism, and\n[indecipherable] who was a soldier and officer who was killed in Israel in --in the\n86\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbeginning. So you see, those people were my friends, and I went to visit th -- with\nthem, because I lived with them. And then we had the patriarchs, in -- in -- Abraham,\nand a -- naturally they were not alive, but I went to them. And then I had my adopted\nmother. My adopted mother was Rachel in Bethlehem. Every Jew knows that Rachel\nwas the adopted mother. So I went to there -- to them, and I spoke to them, and this\nwas my highlight for it -- so for this reason my soul is in Israel, my reality, my natural\nlife is in America. And my dream was in Poland, but it was never continued because\nthe Polish people didn\u2019t let me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So about -- th-thas -- I ge -- I --",

        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you see -- you see America -- America naturally I have a lot of\ncomplaints to America, but we are allowed to have complaints, where I can speak up.\nI remember when I came to America, I was very unhappy I told you, because I didn\u2019t\nmake a living, and I wanted to commit suicide. Then later when I started to make a\nliving, and when I went to Florida, and I -- and this I will never forget, and my wife\n87\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwent to Miami to buy a pair of shoes, and we go in -- we went 1n in a store and I\nwanted to go to the bathroom and I see it\u2019s written for whites and blacks. I wanted to\ndrin -- I couldn\u2019t believe it, I couldn\u2019t understand that in America, so I went back and\nthere was a full -- the store was full with people, and I started to yell, again I talk a lot,\nso I started yell don\u2019t buy here shoes, I wouldn\u2019t let you buy shoes. And she asked me\nwhy. I said go and you will see. There are two fountains, two toilets, what do you\nmean this is for white and blacks? You cannot -- you cannot buy here. And I pulled her\nout and she didn\u2019t buy the shoes, because for me it was something new. On the way\nhome we stopped, I th-think, in North Carolina, something like that, and we went in a\nrestaurant and with us was there a girl, she was from -- a Jewish girl from Yemen, she\nwas dark. We were sitting by the table and we -- we ordered some food. So I made a\njoke, I made a joke and I said I hope they will not see -- recognize you who you are,\nbecause -- made believe that she is black, you know? And the waitress heard it and\ntwo minutes later, the -- a manager came and th-th-th -- he said you wa -- and they\nwere -- they threw us out from the restaurant because we were with this girl. And she\nwas Jewish. So when they threw us out, I didn\u2019t want to go, then they called the police\nand we went out, and there were two police motorcycles. And they ask where is your -\n- where is your cars, I told them. They said, you leave the town, we will escort you,\nand if you don\u2019t go right away, we\u2019ll arrest you.\n88\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: This was in 19 -- in 1949. 19 four -- \u201949 or \u201950, yeah, \u201949. So they went behind us,\nwe were out -- ou-out from the town, so they turned back. And I described this in one\nof the vignettes. And this was a terrible thing for me. I couldn\u2019t understand how come\nthat -- that -- that here in -- in America that I admire so much, and -- and there are\npeople -- see, in this time, for me, the-the-the-the -- when they -- we called them\nNegroes in this time, that they suffered and I could see them as I was a second class\ncitizen in Europe. So this was very, very, very -- it -- it was terrible for me. I -- I -- I\nremember I had later, and thi -- I had later in -- in Hoboken houses, so I had houses\nand there one -- one house -- you see, all those stories I have written down that will be\nin my -- in the book. Yeah, so there was one man, he was the president from the\nNAACP in -- in -- in Hoboken, he didn\u2019t pay me rent, I went for the rent, we had an\nargument, he beat me up. And -- and -- and I went -- I want to go to police. So then I\nwas in this time chairman from the ADL, from, you know, Anti-Defamation League\nfrom B\u2019nai Brith. So I told the stories, I said I want to make a case out of it because\nthe ADL and the Jews they emancipated, 1n this time the blacks, they gave them\nlawyers to be -- they marched. So they made -- they made a complaint and I was called\nto -- to the headquarters from -- in New York from the NAACP. So we were called to\nlisten to the story and they called the man who was the president from their\n89\nFebruary 9, 2001\norganization in Hoboken. So th-the story was that he took -- so I told them, he beat me\nup, I came for the rent. So he said, \u201cYes, I beat him up,\u201d he was a big, husky guy,\n\u201cbecause he came in and h,\u201d -- and I told him, \u201cyou effing nigger, give me the money.\u201d\nThis -- this what he told them, for this reason he beat me up. So I ask them, can -- can I\nask him a few questions? Yeah, yes. I said, What kind of a house was it? Eight family\nhouse. Who lived in the house? All eight were blacks. Wer -- what floor were you\nliving? He say, on the top floor. What time of the day was it that I called you this\nname? It was eight, nine o\u2019clock at night. No white people and I was there with my\nmechanic because we had to fix something. So I -- I -- I ask him those things, so I said\nto the people, I said, \u201cNow, do you think that if I will come to his house, it\u2019s a eight\nfamily house, all are blacks, he lives on the top floor, nine o\u2019clock at night, and I came\nin and I will tell him this what he said, and I will be alive, I will be here, huh?\u201d So they\nasked then the -- my mechanic, he was Ukrainian, and he said, \u201cI just came in to fix\nsomething.\u201d So they thought that he is lying, so on the spot -- on the spot they said you\ndon\u2019t belong to the organization any more, you\u2019re not a president and you -- we don\u2019t\nbelieve you. And I -- so I was very, very pleased with their decision. And they were\nmostly -- they were about half Jewish lawyers and half were blacks, because Jews\ngave them lawyers. So you see, there was a lot of -- of things in America that I disap -\n- disapproved, and -- and I liked. Like I disapproved what they did for black people,\n90\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbecause I couldn\u2019t believe that there should be a discrimination; after all, we are in\nAmerica. The same thing I didn\u2019t want to be discriminated as a Jew. Well, those are\nthe things that I have everything in the -- in the -- in the book, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think the world has learned from Holocaust?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. The world has learned that our environment --\nwhen -- when people who are involved learn a -- Jews learned a lot, not so much about\nthe Holocaust. Let\u2019s say -- let\u2019s talk about Jews in America. The Jews in America are\na little different now to what\u2019s Israel. They are closer to the Israel -- to Israel on\naccount of the Holocaust, because they know that we -- would we have Israel before\nthe war, probably more than half of Jews will be alive, because they will run out and\nthey will have a place where to go. They didn\u2019t know where to go. So now, this is like\na insurance policy. A lot of Jews -- well, the young Jews I don\u2019t think so, because they\nthink we are in America, America is mine. We have America in our pocket. And it\u2019s\nnot true. So -- but the other people, the elderly people, they figure well, this a\ninsurance policy that in case something happens we have where to go. So the whole\nworld didn\u2019t learn anything, because as you can see, we have now not on the -- on the\nSo -- so strong as the Holocaust, we had Rwanda, we had Bosnia, we had Cambodia.\nSo there are a lot of places that 1t was repeated. It was not so repeated like the\nHolocaust, like I said to you before. Why? Because it\u2019s not done by the Germans.\n91\nFebruary 9, 2001\nWould the Germans be in those places, it will be done completely. But those people\nwere not capable to make it so complete as the Germans, because everything what the\nGermans did, it had to be perfect. So they did perfect with the Holocaust also. So -- but\nthey didn\u2019t learn in case something happened it will be the same thing. Now, America\nfor instance, there are so many nationalities, but we know the time for McCarthy, I\ndon\u2019t know if you remember this, it was almost. But, there were courageous people\nwho stood up, and they started to bring this in the -- t-to the world and they -- and he\nwas thrown out. But as -- y-y -- also because it was good times. God forbid if there\nwill be bad times. They will look for a scapegoat. They will look for a scapeg -- and\nhere in America, the first scapegoat will be the black. We have somebody who is\nbehind us. And the next scapegoat will be a Jew. There is even a story that a Jew --\nsomebody said to a Jew that all -- all the disasters are on account of the Jews.\nEverything, all troubles are the Jews. So -- so then he said, well give me one example.\nSo he said, take the Titanic. The Titanic si -- under the Jews. So he said what you\nbring the Jews, what have to do ya-ya? He said, well the -- the -- the Titanic was\ndestroyed by a iceberg. So he said, this what I mean, iceberg, Greenberg, Goldberg,\nthey are all the same. So this 1s -- this is -- the man said it and he believed it. And there\nis -- and then a other man said about the -- about the Holocaust that all the trouble in\nthe world, all the trouble in the world are on account of the Jews, and account of\n92\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbicycle riders. Every trouble what\u2019s on the world are -- is guilty the Jew, or the bicycle\nriders. And people, when you tell it to them, they look at you and they ask, why\nbicycle riders? What have bicycle riders to do with the destructions with this?\nNobody\u2019d ask why the Jews. Nobody said what do have the Jew -- in the country, if\nthere is a disaster, the first scapegoat is the Jew. So nobody -- when you tell the story,\nand I tell the story to a lot of people, nobody ask yet, why the Jew. But everybody ask,\nwhy the bicycle rider? So there you have the answer, and if you ask -- if it co -- 1f the\nworld learned a lesson, the world didn\u2019t learn no lesson. The Jews learned a lesson.\nThe Jews who survived learned a lesson. I don\u2019t think that the Jews in America\nlearned a lesson. There are some Jews who th -- know there was a Holocaust. But the\nmajority Jew, what, they go to W-Wall Street, making money, coming home, going --\ngoing to -- to a nightclub, going to the movie. Do they think about the Holocaust? No.\nThe Holocaust was done for somebody else, and it was done in a other\u2019s time, and it is\nnot for them.",

        "A: Well, 1-1n this -- well, I told you, I\u2019m not talking now about personal things,\nbecause naturally personal things I improved.",
        "Q: Yes, I know.",
        "A: I improve them materially, and all those things, but it -- it-- there were things that --\nthat is -- well, like for instance, take now. Take now, I am very much -- I\u2019m very much\ndisappointed in the results of the elections. This is just happened yesterday. Now why\nam I memb -- why am disappointed? Because I know in America, in such a\ndemocratic country, and I know that the elections were st-stolen, and -- and it\u2019s not\nstolen, I -- there -- some lawyer was on television, he said it was not stolen, it was\nrobbed. And it was robbed because we know -- now, if you go to a bank, and you give\nthem a hundred dollar bill, and you said cha -- exchange it to me for wo -- single ca --\nsingle bills for hundred. And you go away from the ta -- from the window and you\nstart to count, and you see it\u2019s only 65 dollars instead hundred. You will go back and I\nsay, you know you cheated me, you gave me 65. So what will he say? He said let me\ncount it over. And he will count over, he said, he\u2019s right. He will give him extra 35\ndollars. Now here, if it was wrong, if -- 1f 1t was right -- so why do they have to be\n94\nFebruary 9, 2001\nafraid it will be counted over? If it\u2019s right, so he\u2019s right. But they didn\u2019t count it over\nbecause they knew it was wrong. So this I am very much hurt. Forget about the\ndemocrats or republicans. If it will be the opposite, I will be hurt the same way. So a\nthing like this, I am very, very much disappointed. Disappointed because I love\nAmerica, I love American democrats e-even if it\u2019s not hundred percent, but at least we\ncan speak about it. In this, you cannot even speak. And then later the -- the -- the ca --\nthe Supreme Court in Washington, they make the decision. The Supreme Court has --\n1-1s not created to make a decision about elections. The Supreme Court is made for --\nto make decisions about something else. You see, be-because you ask me, those are\nthe things that just happened yesterday. So a thing like this, I am disappointed because\nI feel America is mine. It\u2019s not a thing that I am living in a strange country, is a -- ina\nforeign country like I lived in Poland. In Poland everything they did, I had to take it\nfor granted, this is the way it should be. But not in America, this is my America. The\nsame thing it\u2019s your America. Who are the Americans? We -- and this is -- and then\nthere are -- there are a lot of places, a lot of where I c -- I could give you a lot of\ninstances that it is the same way I -- when I see injustice and it\u2019s done in America, I\nfeel very bad, because I feel 1t is mine, and there shouldn\u2019t any injustice. ... Mostly\nsongs that I sing -- course, 1t\u2019s a very popular song, because this is from my operetta,\nit\u2019s made by Goldfarden. And the operetta\u2019s name is Shilamis. Shilamis is -- was a\n95\nFebruary 9, 2001\nstory about the ancient Israel. And it\u2019s a -- and there is a song is [speaks Hebrew\nhere] means almonds in raisins. And you -- this is a lullaby. And my daughter knew\nabout it because I always sing it, she didn\u2019t know what the words are. And -- and this\nthey -- this they -- the song is about the Temple, and they described about the Temple,\nand they -- I always lo -- I love older -- ol-older songs, but this 1s special with my\ndaughter. [sings in Hebrew] There is a hymn of the Jewish partisans, you probably\nknow about it. So I always, when I speak about the Holocaust, I always sing this song\nof the Jewish partisans. Yo -- you -- you heard it, you know [sings] [phone rings] I\nalways -- but this is English. This is always -- I sing this when -- when I just was in a\nplace and I sing Yiddish songs and there was one woman, and she said, \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m\nlistening, but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d So I said, \u201cFor you, I have a beautiful Jewish song,\nbut it\u2019s in English.\u201d So she was so glad, so I said this 1s, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Sabbath\nCandles,\u201d did you ever hear it? It\u2019s a beautiful song, I like it. Okay? [sings] \u201cMy\nmother\u2019s Sabbath candles that make our home so bright, that faithfully she light them\nwith a prayer each Friday night. And then around the table, we gathered and we heard\nmy father chant a Kiddush, his heart is everywhere. Our humble home became a\nmansion in that mystic low. Our hearts filled again with hopes and dreams of long ago.\nThrough all the tragic stories of Israel\u2019s darkest nights, they never dimmed the glory\nof my mother\u2019s Sabbath lights.\u201d My mother\u2019s Sabbath lights, I\u2019m sure that all of you\n96February 9, 2001\nremember your mother\u2019s Sabbath lights, and if she was anything like my mother, she\nused to do this. First you put in a babushka, a fichila, or a kerchief over her head and\nlight the minimum of two candles. And if your mother was as religious as mine, she\nalso lit a candle, an extra candle for each child in the house. And even an extra candle\non top, just for good luck. With her hands, she covered her face, and made a traditional\npray -- prayer, because this was the closest she ever got to God. \u201cAnd then around the\ntable, we got it and we heard my father chant the Kiddush, his heart is everywhere.\u201d\n[sings in foreign language here]. \u201cOur humble home became a mansion in the te --\nmystic glow.

        "Q: Did you have particular hopes or values that you wanted to instill in your -- in your\nchild, for Esther?",
        "Q: Hopes and values? Yes. Hope of -- the first hopes and values is to -- to install in her\na value of Judaism. Not a value of Judaism, about religion, God, but to be proud being\na Jew, what the Jews did. This what I am proud, what the Jews did, fa -- through the\n4,000 years since Abraham, what they did to human beings, what they did to the\nworld, including the 10 commandments, including Jesus, even. That -- how come that\n-- that -- even with the Catholics, when they believe, said God picked out Mary to\nhave a child, that God is a father, how come she didn\u2019t go to a -- to a Spanish woman,\nor to a Polish woman, or to a Irish woman and have a child -- if -- 1f I would believe\nwhat a Catholic believes. And to have a child with -- with -- with one of those\nnationality. So why did He pick out a Jewish girl, to have a child with a Jewish girl?\nSo probably there is something more to it. Now -- which I don\u2019t believe in all those\nthings. Now, I believe in Jesus, far as a human being. Now, he was -- if Jesus\nwouldn\u2019t be made now, the religion was made 200 years later they started to write. If\nJesus wouldn\u2019t be made a God, he would be a prophet by the Jews, because he was a -\n-a--a--aman that he tried to help the underdog. His friends were fishermen,\nshepherds, prostitutes, all those things because he wanted to help them. He was a very\nethical man. And so I believe in this, but I don\u2019t believe that Jesus had anything to do",
        "Q: No.",

        "Q: Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s go back to Esther for just a minute. Was -- she was an only child, and\nshe also did not have any -- did she ask for grandparents --",
        "Q: -- ask you this again. Talk about her missing grandparents, and --",
        "Q: I want to ask you another question that has to do with your jobs again. So later on\nyou went into contru -- into construction business, and you made good money, you had\na successful firm. And then your family kind of liked you in a different way.",

        "Answer: My name now is Norman Salsitz, but this is not the original name. So if you\nask me from before, I was born as Naftali Saleschutz. And the Saleschutz is a very\nlong name for America, so we changed it to Salsitz. But during the war I had a few\nother names, in the way for each -- for each time. During the war my name first was\nTadeusz Jadach, a Polish name, then it was Tadeusz Zaleski, and then also it was\nAnatoli Sherbakovy, which is a Russian name. Then it was also Lazarus Spillman, it\nwas a German name. And when I came to America, we change it to Salsitz, and I\u2019m\nstill Salsitz, and I hope it will be Salsitz til I die.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: So that later you will edit this.",
        "A: Yeah.\n2\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, now when I was born Naftali Saleschutz, of course they had to give me a\nname when I was born. I had a lot of names, not orig -- not names, legally names,\npeople called me all kind of names because I was not an angel when I was small. My\nfamily called me different, my friends called me different. During the war, when I\nescaped from the camp and I started -- I escaped to the woods, I had to -- I got false --\nit\u2019s -- oh, actually, it was not false, it was a real birth certificate from a monsignor and\nhe gave me the name -- I picked out the name because the -- the name belonged to a\nfriend of mine who went with me to school, and dur -- 1939 he was in the army, he\nwas killed. And I picked out his name because he s -- he -- we looked very much alike,\nlike we would be brothers. And his name was Tadeusz Jadach. It\u2019s a very good\nPolish name. So I asked the monsignor, so he gave me his birth certificate and I started\nto masquerade when I was in the underground in the woods, as Tadeusz Jadach.\nThen, during this time, I also belonged to a Russian group, a Russian partisan groups\nfor a short time. So there I got the other document in my name as Naftali in Russia, su\n-- supposed to be Anatoli, it\u2019s changed. So I liked Anatoli, so I got a paper as\n3February 9, 2001\nSherbakov, which is a real Russian name, so I became Anatoli Sherbakov. Then,\nwhen I d -- was liberated, and I joined the Polish army, and the Polish army didn\u2019t\nwant me to have the same name as I had in the underground, as Tadeusz Jadach,\nbecause there was all political mis -- they didn\u2019t believe in the same ideology, so I\nchanged the name to Tadeusz Zaleski, it should be similar to my original name\nSaleschutz, so it became Zaleski. It could be Saleschutz but spelled different like in\nPolish, because the real Saleschutz was spelled like a German name. But then people\nwere afraid that it -- my superiors, that it will have a connection with my name from\nbefore, so they said let\u2019s have a new name, so Tadeusz was okay, it\u2019s a good Polish\nname, so I became Tadeusz Zaleski. Then later when I was in the -- in the Polish\narmy, I was in the intelligence, and I had special -- you -- in a special unit, so for a\ncertain time I had to be -- to have a German name, because we had to interduce -- to\nin -- interrogate German officers, but there is a long story in my book about it, so I had\na friend, his name was Lazarus Spillman, so I made out documents that I am Lazarus\nSpillman. And when I came to America -- so I came -- I got back to my real name,\nNaftali Saleschutz, but for America the Saleschutz was too long. People don\u2019t have\ntime to spell, everybody ask how do you spell it. So because I had a brother in\nAmerica and his name was Salsitz, so I change it to Salsitz. And Naftali they thought\nis a too Jewish name, so I became Norman, which I\u2019m sorry til today because I like\n4February 9, 2001\nNaftali much better than Norman, and this is how I remain. So do -- this is -- this is\nmy name.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Whe -- when I went into the Polish army after I was liberated -- I was\nliberated in the beginning of August 1944, and I right away wanted to go to the army\nbecause I figured if I survived the war, I have to fight the Germans, and this was my\naim, because my father\u2019s last words was, Nakuma, nakuma, nakuma. It means\nrevenge, revenge, revenge, take revenge. I figured how can I take revenge? I have to\nbe in the army in a special unit. And then I was sent to a -- from a -- in --in -- the\ngovernment was in Lublin, the Polish government, temporary government, because\nWarsaw was not liberated, and then later I was sent from Lublin to Szeszow, because\nSzeszow was a bigger town near my town, Kolbuszowa, and I know Szeszow -- I\nknew Szeszow and I knew the surrounding and I knew the people there. So I was in\nthis time -- we call it informatsia voickowa, which means -- this was the political unit\n5February 9, 2001\nin the army. It was -- so a -- when then -- the 12\" of January, 1945, was the left -- the\nless [indecipherable] towards Berlin, towards the -- take over Germany, because in\nSzeszow, when I was liberated, the front stopped, the front stopped in August. And for\nsix months nothing happened, they stayed in one place, and they made all the\npreparations for the final push. The January the 12\" the war started -- I mean, the\n[indecipherable] started towards the west, and this was actually the last\n[indecipherable] til the war was ended. Now I was picked out -- in this time they\npicked out a group f-fo -- of hundred young, mostly officers, and we were assigned to\ngo with the Russian front. As the Russian front went, we went right with them, and\nfrom the hundred, soon as a town was liberated, some of us remained in the town to\nestablish a Polish presence, and to start to organize -- organize security, and -- and\ncivil offices. So each town had some people left, two or three. I was assigned to do the\nsame thing, but til we will re -- reach Krakow. When we reach Krakow -- so from the\nhundred remained maybe 50 or 60, and we came into Krakow, and I was assigned to\nthe same units, which was the military -- the military intelligence, but my si -- my par -\n- there were a lot of sections. People had the section with the clergy, people had the\nsection with the civil organization. I -- my section was that I had to do with Germans\nwho lived in Poland, or who remained in Poland, or Polish people who collaborated\nwith the Germans -- and they changed during the occupation, they made out papers\n6February 9, 2001\nthat they are ethnic Germans. And because I spoke German, so I was attached to this\nunit, and also we had a lot of German prisoners of war, so I interrogated them, and this\nis how I became the head of the county f -- of Krakow for this reason, for this\npurposes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, Krak\u00e9w was -- luckily Krakow was not touched. It was not destroyed y --\nlike other towns. Like Warsaw for instance, was 90 percent destroyed. Krakow was\nnot destroyed and this is in the book with this -- it had to be destroyed because the\nGermans prepared for a destruction, and they prepared 287 colu -- places where --\nwere mined, and the 287 I remember distinctly because this was our main em -- th --\nmain thing to eliminate those things. So Krakow wasn\u2019t destroyed, but our -- our da --\nduty, what we had to do the first thing, we had to clin -- to get rid of the people who\n7\nFebruary 9, 2001\ncollaborated with the Germans. Mostly Germans they left, the army left, but there were\nsome who remained. But the people who collaborated, now they were Polish people,\nbut during the German occupation they made out papers, and they find ways that their\ngrandfather was from Germany, or great grandfather was a colonist. And e --\nsometimes even if 1t was not true. They wanted to do it, why? Because doing this they\nbecame ethnic Germans, and the German gave them bigger ration cards, they could get\na nicer apartment and they could get a good job. Even the Polish people who were sent\naway to concentration camps, and they were -- didn\u2019t have the rice, they had more rice,\nand they were the elite during the German occupation. Now, as the Germans left, those\npeople tried to be back Poles, because actually they were Poles, they were traitors. So\nnaturally our aim was to find out, to interrogate them, and to find them. If they came\nfrom different towns, if they started having new papers. So mostly this was our aim,\nand this was also for the security of the government not to have enemies in our place.\nSo this was the main things that we had to have. Then I got an -- a special job. This\nwas -- now we occupied Krakow, officially occupation was the 19\" of January, 1945.\nThis was official date. I was two days before in Krakow, but this was the official date\nwhen Krakow was occupied do -- by the Russian army. And -- and the only Polish\nunit was our unit that we came in and that we were the -- the first who were in\nKrakow, and the people looked up to us that we are the liberators. In beginning, or 1-1-\n8\nFebruary 9, 2001\nin th -- in beginning of February, a group came from England, and this was the --\norganization to study the crimes of the Germans. And the head of this group was\nHewlett Johns -- Johnson. He was the Dean of Canterbury from England. He was a\narchbishop and he was the head. And he had in his group mostly professors from\ndifferent universities, from countries who were not a g -- who -- who didn\u2019t work with\nthe Germans. Like in Europe a lot of countries collaborated, and they had armies like\nHungary, Romania. Those were professors from places that they were always against\nthe Germans, or the Germans were occupying their countries. We had professors from\nRussia, from England, from -- from Argentina, from all over the world. And I was\nassigned that I was to prepare -- I had to prepare every day\u2019s activity for this group\nwhere to go. We went to all concentration camps, to -- like for instance, in Auschwitz,\nwe were in Auschwitz maybe two weeks after Auschwitz was liberated. Everything\nwas fresh. The de -- the destruction of the crematoriums, they we -- still were hot from\n-- from -- from fire. The clothing of the people that they were -- were killed, and they\nwere still, the blood was still soft, because it wasn\u2019t dry up. And then th-the -- the\nwarehouses from children\u2019s shoes, and eyeglasses, and [indecipherable] and all those\nthing. This was just in the beginning. And we found in Auschwitz also, about 20 to\nthir -- 25,000 people who couldn\u2019t be sent out with the death marches like they did\nbefore the Russians occupied. So I went with this group for about four, five weeks.\n9\nFebruary 9, 2001\nEvery day we -- the headquarters were in Krakow in the hotel, and my job was to\nprepare the itinerary for the next day. Where to go, how to go, to have the cars and the\ntransportation for the group. And because I spoke a little English, so they picked me\nout and I was the one that I explained to the man who was in charge of transportation\nfrom the Dean of Canterbury, and with him, too, and I brought them over to all those\nplaces. During the times that we went to the concentration camps, there was a other\naim, was the Polish government wanted, is to show them how the people are very\nhappy with the communists who came in. Now this, everything was staged, nothing\nwas the truth. Th -- th -- the -- Hewlett Johnson, the archbishop later had a nickname,\nthe Red Dean, because everything -- he was very much pro-Russia. When he went, for\ninstance to Korea in this -- later, and always he went to investigate, but he always was\npro-Russia. So what my -- my job was to -- to stage -- like, for instance, we went to a\nplace, to a concentration camp. On the spo -- on the way, when we saw there a group\nof Polish peasants, and they were dressed in the Polish traditional clothing, which 1 --\nthis was all staged. So I said to him, \u201cWell, let\u2019s find out, let\u2019s stop and find out from\nthe people what they think about the new regime.\u201d Because they started to take away\nland from the landowners, and gave them away to the peasants. So we stopped, and I\nasked them in Polish, and it was translated. Now those were not peasants that we met\nocca -- special we met. Those were people who were told to be on this spot, dressed\n10\nFebruary 9, 2001\nlike peasants and they had all kind of m -- pitchforks and other things what peasants\nuse. And I said to him, oh there are peasants, it\u2019s good to find out. Now, they were\nprepared, those were people who were from the government. Tho -- there were -- who\nbelonged to the communist eg -- organizations. And they were prepared what they will\nbe asked, and what they should a -- was -- wa -- should answer. And naturally all of\nthem said how happy they are, that before the war they were discriminated, the\npeasants. And now they come in and the government is so good for the peasants. And\nthey took away from the very rich people, who never took care on their fields, and they\ndivided, they gave. And she -- they praised -- they praised there the [indecipherable].\nAnd this was everything -- naturally they made the film, and they made pictures, and\nthis was later shown in -- in newsreels, how the Polish population, the peasants are\nvery, very happy with it. But this -- everything was staged.",
        "A: Yeah, I was -- not officially. Officially I couldn\u2019t be ra -- 1-involved because the\nfirst thing, I was not a Jew. I -- in this time I was not -- Tadeusz Zaleski, a Polish\nCatholic. And the second thing, our job was not to -- to give food to the people, to help\npeople. Our job was to find out collaborators and other things, but through my future\n11\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwife, because I started to bring her food right the next day when I met her, because\nthere -- there was no -- you couldn\u2019t buy food, and people didn\u2019t have food. So I use --\nand we had everything, because in the army we had everything, so I use -- I took my\nadjutant or some, and I used to send to her every day, bread and salami and butter and\nother things. Now, when the people who came out from hiding -- you didn\u2019t have yet\npeople from concentration camps, because it took a few weeks til they started to come\nin. But people came out from hiding, they were hungry, and they were -- they were in\nhiding for -- for two years, for y -- year and a half. They find out that there 1s a --\nsomebody who survived and he is Jewish and he has food. So they started to come to\nher and asked her for -- for -- for food, and she was glad to give it to them. Now, as\nshe gave them the food, naturally, she notified me. I didn\u2019t see her so often in the\nbeginning. She notified me she needs more, she needs more, and I n -- not officially,\nsent her all kind, and she just -- and she gave it away. Also, I gave her a lot of clothing.\nAs we took over a lot of apartments, where Germans left, or people who were\ncollaborators were arrested, we confiscated their apartments, and we had all the things\nfrom their apartments, so I could give it to her, and she used to distribute to the people\nwho came ba -- with their -- with their concentration clothing -- they didn\u2019t -- it was\nwinter, because this was in January, February, it was very cold. So I gave it to her and\nI was very happy and the people find out, and wa -- once somebody find out, there\n12\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwere more and more and more, [indecipherable] I gave it her, she gave it -- she give it\n-- give it away, and I was very happy I could do it, unofficially. Then later I also find\nout that there was a woman, and there 1s a film made about it. They called it, \u201cMy\nHundred Children.\u201d And this woman collected children who were left for -- fo --\nafter fa -- they were hidden, and also a lot of Polish people who took in the children to\nhide, and they were promised money after the war, and then later they find out that the\nparents are killed, nobody came back, so they abandoned the children. And the\nchildren didn\u2019t have where to go. So the Jewish co -- committee started to collect those\nchildren, there was one woman special, and she is in -- in the book th -- what they\nwrote, \u201cMy Hundred Children.\u201d She collected chil -- she lost all her family, so she\ncollected those children and brought them into the Jewish committee, and they were on\n-- they had that [indecipherable], but she didn\u2019t had wa -- what -- how to feed them.\nSo she find out about me, because when I came to Krakow, and I went right away to\ntwo leaders of Krakow, one was -- his name was -- he was involved with the Jewish\ncommittee, he was a lawyer before the war, his name was Stulbackt. And then it was\na rabbi who survived the war, not from Krakow, but he kra -- remained, and he was in\nKrakow, and he was like the official rabbi. His name was Steinberg. So I came to\nthem and I told them, \u201cListen, I am a Jew. Nobody knows that I am a Jew, but I want\nyou should know. Any time you have a problem, and I am in the government, and I\n13\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhave a big position. If you need something, please tell me, not official, and I will do\nwhat I can do.\u201d In this what I -- they always came to me and the brought me problems,\nand -- and I have -- and now -- in -- in my new books that I writing now, \u201cTreasure of\nJewish Memories,\u201d I\u2019m describing those episodes fr -- from the -- what a -- for --\nfrom this time. So when -- when I find out that the children are there, they didn\u2019t have\nwhat to wear, they didn\u2019t have what to eat, so I sco -- I-I couldn\u2019t give them money,\nand I -- so we had a lot of sugar. And because sugar the Germans th -- had the sugar in\nwarehouses and we took it over. So I told this woman, I cannot give you money, but if\nyou have a truck -- I cannot deliver it -- you can come and pick out and I can give you\nas much sugar as you want, and later you sell the sugar. So this way they could support\nthemselves. Then later they needed some clothing. And we took away from Germany\ntwo large warehouses, because the Germans had warehouses for underwear, shirts and\nother things, for the Germans, because everything was on ration cards. Now the Poles\ndidn\u2019t get anything, but the Germans got -- oh, and those were I find out where the\nwarehouses are, because when the germ -- before the Germans left, they put all this\nmaterial in two houses in basements. They were big basements because this was a\nwhole [indecipherable] and I find out about it. So we went and we confiscated\neverything. So I had a lot of this material. I remember there were children\u2019s socks, and\nchildren\u2019s underwear, and everything what -- so -- so I brought -- every time I came\n14\nFebruary 9, 2001\nover to them, so I brought a trunk full of those things and I gave it to them. Now, they\nknew that I am Jewish, those few people, but the rest, they didn\u2019t know. And when I\ntook it out from the warehouses, the people who work with me, they didn\u2019t know why\nI take it away. Maybe they thought maybe I take it and I sell it on black market or\nsomething. But I gave it away all to my girlfriend, or to the Jewish committee.",
        "A: I think this was the best time of my -- there were two times that there were the best\ntimes of my life. And I think this was the best time. One time was the best time when I\n-- like for instance, when I was in the woods, naturally we starved, it was cold, and it\nwas terrible fear. But if we could do something -- there was one time that we made a\nraid of -- o-on -- we made a raid, there was a -- a sop -- police station from Puskov,\nfrom the SS, and we made the raid, and we killed them, all of them, so I think this was\nthe happiest day in my life. As a matter of fact in my book there, somebody wrote, and\nin th -- in -- and what I explained to him it 1s -- it was like when I had the machine gun\nin my hand, it\u2019s like a lame who couldn\u2019t walk, and suddenly he -- he -- he was able to\nwalk. To me, that I was not any more the victim, that I wasn\u2019t any more the pe -- the\nperson who was killed, that I could pay back. And this was my life why I wanted to\n15\nFebruary 9, 2001\nlive. To take revenge, which I did as much as possible. In Krakow, it was a other,\nnaturally we couldn\u2019t go out, we couldn\u2019t kill people any more, it was after the war.\nBut for me to see that the people, the Jewish came ba -- the Jews came back, they had\nnothing, they di -- and even the Polish government was not very, very friendly with\nthem, because individual -- maybe the government as a whole was not anti-Semitic,\nbecause in this time it was a communist government, but each individual policeman,\neach individual clerk, everything, he had this hate in his heart as again the same thing,\nthey didn\u2019t change. Now, if I could do something, I was very happy. People that I\ndidn\u2019t know, they find out -- they find out that -- that they could do -- through me they\nwent to this rabbi, and if I could help them I was very happy. And also, also, if they\nneeded apartments, and there was every apartment, usually there was a -- a office\nwhere they gave out the apartments. Now, if a Jew came for an apartment and even he\nlived before in Krakow, they wouldn\u2019t give it to him because the people were very,\nvery against Jews. And they said, \u201cWell, why did you come back?\u201d And they looked at\nthat Jew -- and now I\u2019m writing a new book about the killings after the war, so the title\nof the book is what they used to say in the title 1s, you are still alive? I -- and the\nsubtitle is, I thought they killed all of you. This was the first question -- the first that a\nPole ask a Jew when he survived. But when -- when -- when they went to this rabbi\nand the rabbi knew that he could be helped through me, I did it. Now this was a very,\n16February 9, 2001\nvery rewarding thing for me. Because if I started a thing, we were killed, and nobody\ndid anything. And this time we were undress -- I\u2019m not talking I personally, but the\nJews, and we were undr -- dress over a -- a -- a ditch, and we were killed. Now if e-\neach one of them would think, if I would live and if I could pay them back, everybody\nwill do it. Now, after the war, people didn\u2019t do it. The war is ended, and everybody\nwas interested to have a bread, to make a living, and to save his family if he had a\nfamily. But for me, I survived for two reasons --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- for me, I survived for two reasons. And this, to -- to survive, you had to have a\nlegacy, you had to have a reason. Th-This gave you strength, otherwise you couldn\u2019t\nsurvive. And I had two. One was when my father was killed, he yelled to take revenge,\nand | -- it is now 55 - 60 years later, I still hear his si -- his screams. This was one that\ngave me strength. I have to live, because I was the youngest, and I was the only one to\npay back, pay back for my five sisters, pay back for my -- the sister\u2019s husbands, pay\nback for my nieces and nephews. Who would pay back? So this mean that they were\nkilled, and nothing will happen to the people who did it. So this was one legacy that it\ngave me strength. To take back the second one was when my mother was taken away\nto Belzec with my five sisters to be killed in Belzec, she somehow gave to somebry --\n17\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbody a letter, and I got the letter from this person. I was in [indecipherable] and she\nwrote to me, you are my ninth child, you are the youngest. You are young, you are\nstrong, you are smart. If somebody will survive, you will survive. Because she\nbelieves that somebody will survive. She said, \u201cAfter the war, go to your brother,\u201d\nbecause I had a brother in Palestine, \u201cgo to y -- Palestine, go to your brother,\u201d I had a\nbrother in America, \u201cand tell the whole world what the German murderers did to us.\u201d\nSo this is the reasons that after the war, I started to tell, even in the beginning people\ndidn\u2019t want to listen. But I spoke, and they thought I have an obsession, some people\ndidn\u2019t like it. Later, 20 years later, st -- people started to realize, and they listened.\nBooks came out, movies came out. But I started to speak the first minute I left Poland,\nand I told the stories. And people thought that it is something wrong with me. And this\ngave me strength to survive. That if we will not be alive, the whole world would know\nwhat a cruel thing happened 1n this time. And for this reason not only I, all survivors,\ntheir duty is to write down, and to write and tell the stories. Because everyone survived\na different way. Everyone had different problems and cruelties. So for this I am telling,\nand I am going out, if somebody asked me to go and speak, I don\u2019t care where and\nhow and when, I never took money f-for it, and I am doing it because I think this is my\nduty, that the people should know what happened.\n18\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: Well, then later from Krakow, I was transferred to Breslau, and I became the head\nof the security for Breslau for the cow -- for the town. In Krak\u00e9w wa -- I was the\nhead for the county. In Breslau I was for the town. And again the same story, in\nBreslau | had a lot of work, because Breslau, first thing Breslau was 90 percent or 85\npercent destroyed, and there were a lot of Germans, and we wanted the Polish people\nshould come in, and they should show that there is -- this became a Polish town, and a\n-- and we then -- later we gave out in orders that all the Germans have to leave. Now\nthey left, and they had two suitcases, and this was something for me very, very\nimportant, because this was a pay back what they did to the Jews. Naturally they --\nwhen they were sent out, when we brought them to the train, we didn\u2019t kill them th --\nlike in the -- in the Szeszow where I was and one day they killed 6,000 Jews, sik -- 600\nJews, then thousand Jews, by an aktia -- we call it a aktia, it means an\n[indecipherable]. But by the Germans nobody was killed, they only had to leave. Now\nthe -- their apartments were taken over by Polish people, and in -- in -- in -- but -- but\none thing we s -- in this time also, the -- it started in Israel, we knew -- Palestine in\n19\nFebruary 9, 2001\nthis time, and we knew Palestine will have to -- the Jews will try to have their own\ncountry. And as -- I always was a Zionist. I never became a member of the communist\nparty, even they ask me to do it. But my excuse was that I am not in th -- [ -- Iam not\ntaught enough to know the ide -- the ideology about communism, I have to learn a\nlittle more, I have to read more and this was my excuse. And my wife never wanted to\nstay, because my wife had very bad experience, because when the Russians came in to\nthe -- her town in Stanislav -- in Stanislavov in 1940 -- in 1939, and they lived under\nco-communist regime, now the people who were well off were middle class\n[indecipherable] middle class they were -- th-th-the Russians tried to liquidate them.\nIf they were Zionists they sent them to Siberia, if they were rich they took away\neverything. So from them they took away their apartment, they took away the\nbusiness. Her father had to be a plain worker, which -- my wife wanted to study\nmedicine, they didn\u2019t let her in because she was a daughter of a bourge -- bourgeois\nfamily. So she sa -- and then they saw the system 1s not for her, so she didn\u2019t want to\nstay in Poland. And she always said, well in Poland you got a king for a night, but the\nend we -- I don\u2019t want. So we started to think -- and I also, when I was in Breslau, I\nstart -- well, even in Krakow, I started to work in that organization, a Zionist\norganization. Naturally the people from the organization knew that I am Jewish, and I\ngave them some protection, and they had to -- to -- to travel toward the\n20\nFebruary 9, 2001\nCzechoslovakian border, I helped them. And also, when I was in Breslau, I was still\ninvolved with this organization, and -- and -- and -- but -- but the end was that we had\nto leave, til 1t came a time that my wife said she ha -- we have to leave because the\nlonger we will wait, it will be harder to -- to go away. Now, I left first, and I left very -\n- not organize in [indecipherable] because I went with that -- with a truck, through the\nborder to East Germany, and on the way I could be caught, I we -- but it\u2019s a long\nstory, but I left.",
        "A: Yo -- well, my th -- my thought -- well, see, the first thing my wife wanted to leave,\nof course, she had family in pales -- in is -- in Palestine at this time. She had a\ngrandmother, she had a sister, she has three uncles with her family. So she said, well\nshe had somebody. And I wanted to leave because I saw, even now -- I have a good\nposition and everything, but I had to masquerade. I wanted to be myself. I -- why\nshould I -- if we have a free country, and if we -- the communist regime is so equal, no\nanti-Semitic, why do I have to hide my identity? Why do I have to be Tadeusz\nZaleski? Why can\u2019t I be myself? And also, being a non-Jew, the people who work\nwith me, the people who were in the government didn\u2019t have no secrets because I was\none of them. So then I could see that deep in -- imbedded anti-Semitism towards Jews.\n21\nFebruary 9, 2001\nAnd nobody was a friend sp -- in those -- in this time. Even officially they couldn\u2019t go\nout and say, well I hate Jews, and this and that, but inside everybody was anti-Semite.\nNow, 1n the -- there were no secrets from me, so I saw that this will not be a life for\nme, and also my wife always said that the end will be -- see, in Russia, in the Russian\nsystem there were three kinds of people. People who were in jail, people -- pe -- he --\npeople who were in jail, people who are in jail, and people who will be 1n jail. So the\nend was I -- I didn\u2019t care how big I was, the end was if I do something -- something\nwrong, see, if I would be a -- a [indecipherable] if I would be a -- a communist, and I\nwill like the regime, and I [indecipherable], so then I would say, well this is my life,\nand I love it. I wasn\u2019t -- I come from a very Orthodox, ultra-Orthodox home. Reet --\nnot, I wouldn\u2019t say millionaires, but a very comfortable home. We were -- we were\nconsidered 10 percent of the richest people in our town. And the whole family was\nvery religious, so I was not brought up to be against religion, or to hate people who\nhave money or make a living. I did it because it was comfortable for me in this time.\nThe war ended, I wanted to take revenge, and I could have a job to be acknowledged,\nbut not as a Jew, so this was very bad for me. So I knew that the end would be I will\nnot be there. But longer my w -- my wife was very smart, she said, longer we will\nwait, worse it be to come out. And naturally I went out first, and she remained and she\nwas arrested because they thought through her they will get me. So -- but I never,\n22\nFebruary 9, 2001\nnever had my mind, because this was not a regime for me. Now, we want to go to\nPalestine. I was registered, and I worked with that group called Bricha. Bricha was\nthe one who took out people, and they smuggled them to Italy and from Italy to\nPalestine. Now, from Poland the Bricha went over to Germany, from Germany to\nItaly. Now, unofficially I belonged to them, because my dream was to be in Palestine.\nBecause even when I was home before the war I wanted to go to Palestine. But then\nlater we escaped and we came to Germany. In Germany there was other -- other\nproblem to go to Palestine because you couldn\u2019t go officially, you had to go illegally,\nand you wind out in Cyprus in a camp and my wife didn\u2019t want to go to a camp, so we\ncame to America. We said, we will go to America -- which one would come first,\nPalestine or America, and if America comes first, we\u2019ll go to America, and if we\u2019re\nin America we can always go to Palestine. And we came to America, and the first\nmoney we made in 1949, so we went to Palestine -- to -- it was already Israel, not\nPalestine. Well, this [indecipherable] but -- but it was -- for me it was too late,\nbecause there was no war --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.\n23\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: From where? From Poland? From po --",
        "A: Oh, from Poland you couldn\u2019t go no place --",
        "A: I had to ask [indecipherable] yeah, it was difficult because in Germany if -- see, I\nhad a large family in America. My father had four brothers and two sisters and they\nhad children. Naturally, they were [indecipherable]. And we always -- and I had a\nbrother. So I wrote to them that I need affidavit, you need affidavit there, oh, my\nbrother said he\u2019d send me, I never got it. So I never got -- so I got -- and we wanted to\ngo at -- if we couldn\u2019t go to -- to Israel, we want to go to America, we didn\u2019t want to\nstay in Germany, because for me being in Germany, every day it was the biggest\ntorture. Because when I went in in a trolley car, and if I saw every German, I looked at\nevery German, I saw in every German I saw that he was the murderer of my father, the\nmurderer of my family. Every German looked to me the same. And I couldn\u2019t stay, so\n-- and I had a lot of problems, because I remember once I went in and in the trolley\ncar, and -- and I was sitting on -- on a seat, and there a woman, a elderly woman came\nin, and -- and I didn\u2019t get up, and so one young German came in, he says, why don\u2019t\n24\nFebruary 9, 2001\nyou get up, she\u2019s a old woman, and -- and -- and you are young fellow, why don\u2019t you\n-- so I said well, did somebody get up when my mother came in? My mother was\nkilled. So why should I -- maybe those are the people who killed my -- so we had a\nargument, then later we had the fight. I remember once we came in in a place and I\nsaw a la -- young Jewish, they fighting with a group of young Germans. I didn\u2019t ask\nquestions, I di -- I didn\u2019t know why. I jumped in. But so happens that I didn\u2019t look\nJewish, so the Jewish people started to beat me up. I said, \u201cWhat are you beating me\nup?\u201d They said, \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a German?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I am Jewish.\u201d So every day\n-- every day something else. So we di -- we wanted to get out, and we came -- you\ncouldn\u2019t go, you needed that affidavit. So I -- my family didn\u2019t send it to me, so the\nJoint Distribution, they gave out -- what they did, they didn\u2019t give out individual\naffidavits, they made a group, let\u2019s say hundred people and one affidavit, and the\norganization took care to show the government that we will not later stay in the -- in --\nin -- and not to make a living. So this is how we came. Even they paid -- they -- the\nJoint paid for my transportation, for the passage. Then later I paid them back, but they\ndidn\u2019t know if I would pay them back. But my family didn\u2019t do it.\n25\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: When I got that visa, so we were assigned to go to Bremen, and from Bremen to\ngo to America. But in this time, we -- we had to stay in Bremen almost a half a year,\nbecause it was a coal strike in amer -- in -- in America, and the ships -- the boats\ndidn\u2019t take us.",
        "A: Bremenhaven. In Bremenhaven we were there 1n there they made like a staging\narea in a school, and the people you were staying there, they gave us to eat, but we\ncouldn\u2019t leave. Now, it was also a very unpleasant place because that ger -- when --\nwhen you got -- when you had to go to get the visa, Germans got the visa very fast.\nBut course, by us, there was in this time, the consul and the co -- they -- they -- they\ndidn\u2019t let the Jewish people who wanted to go to America, they didn\u2019t let them to -- to\nsee the consul. Why? Because they demanded documents, birth certificate, and\n[indecipherable]. Where did the Jews get documents when they came out from death\ncamps? So every day in the consulate, there were hundreds of Jews waiting that\nnobody could reach the consul. So there was one secretary and she made a business\nout of it, and for 200 dollars, she made that you could see the consul. Now people start\n-- who had money started to pay her, and everybody knew that she takes money. Now\nthe first thing we didn\u2019t have the money and we didn\u2019t want to pay, why should we\npay her? So because my wife spoke English, I spoke a little English, I said, we have to\n26\nFebruary 9, 2001\ntake it in our hand. So there was that general consul, I remember his name was\nClarke. And this Clarke, we said we have to see him. So once when he went for\nlunch, we stopped him. And my wife said she wants to talk to him, and she -- he\nexplained -- she explained to him that it is impossible, there are hundreds of people\nwho want to go to America, and we cannot go because this woman demands 200\ndollars for a person to let her see -- and she -- she was a partner with one of the vice-\nconsuls, there was [indecipherable] and she was a partner and she sent it to him and\nthey got im -- they got the visa. So she told this -- everything to the Clarke and I was\nstanding there and he listened and listened. So he said, well I want you should come to\nmy office, and we went there. And we explained, and I remember that when we left, so\nhe came to us and he put the hand on our head. He said, \u201cWell, do you know, children\nlike you we need in America.\u201d And he changed the whole rule. Instead before you\nneeded -- she -- this woman said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have the documents, I don\u2019t let -- I\ndon\u2019t make the application.\u201d So he changed the rules, and the rules were you needed\ntwo witnesses. And when the two witnesses gave a statement that they know you, you\ncome from this town, and everything, the two witness was -- so everybody got two\nwitnesses. One was a witness for him, then later he was a witness for them. And then\nthe people -- we were -- we ca -- we came them every day. Then later the people knew\nthat we made this change, and they were very happy. Even til today some people who\n27\nFebruary 9, 2001\nare here and they always remind us that we went and we had the guts to speak up. And\nthis way, we -- this woman was fired. They -- the -- the consul -- the visa consul was\nstill there. It so happened that we were assigned -- I remember he had one le -- he was\na -- a invalid, so we were assigned to him because the general consul didn\u2019t take care\non all the children, so -- on all the people, so we were assigned to him. When we were\nassigned to him, and -- and he didn\u2019t ask us too many question because we had the two\naffidavits. Then later he said to raise the hand and he swore us in. So I was afraid\nbecause I almost burst out in laughter, because he was the one who was a partner with\nthis woman, and now he is giving me this thing. Well, we got the visa and we had to\ngo to Bremen, in Bremen we got stuck for six months. And then later we went on the\n-- on the liberty ship. Those were the ships, th-the name was Ernie Pyle. This was the\nlast time that the liberty ship, and unlucky we were cause it was in the winter, it was in\nJanuary, and -- and underw -- underway it was a terrible storm, and the ship, the boiler,\neverything broke and we almost drowned. And everybody was so sick, that I was\nlaying on the -- on -- on the [indecipherable] the -- the people, the men were in the\nbasement, what maybe 201 in -- in -- in this hole. Now the women were 20 - 25 in\ntheir cabin, when -- and I was so sick I was laying out -- outside on the deck. And I\npray to God it\u2019s -- the ship should sink. I couldn\u2019t take it, I didn\u2019t eat. So my wife, in\nthis time she put on a woman\u2019s housecoat with the woman\u2019s pajama and the kerchief\n28\nFebruary 9, 2001\non my head, and she took me in in her room. And the people in her room knew and --\nthat I am with her and I slept there, and this was a little better. But what -- we were\nvery, very angry that the German people who went to America in this time, cause a lot\nof German went to America, they had family here, they had the big, best cabins,\nbecause they had money to pay. And they -- the people from the company were\nGerman, so they had cabins and they were sitting and eating and drinking and dancing.\nAnd we were laying like -- like dogs in -- in -- so this was very, very unfair. But this\nhow they came. So mo -- not only on our ship, on all the ships. So the German people\nhad all the privileges because they were normal people and they got people who gave\nthem those places, and they could pay for it. So then we came to -- we came to\n[indecipherable] we arrived in America January the 17\", and -- and -- and we were\nso sick. So then later, a night before, somebody said, tomorrow morning we atrive in\nAmerica. So I -- I as -- how -- as sick we were, everybody di -- dragged out the -- the -\n- the -- the best suit, with the best coat, and we were [indecipherable] and we waited\nhalf a night, we were just staying on the deck waiting for the Statue of Liberty. And\nwhen the statue of -- when we saw the Statue of Liberty, everybody from us started to\ncry. Even today [indecipherable] we saw already the Statue of Liberty, and this we --\nwe are in America. Now wa -- wa -- wa -- this was not the end. Then later when we --\nwe went that -- they said to take out the valises and everything, so we took it out on the\n29February 9, 2001\ndeck. Everyone to his initial, N to N, S to S and so on, and then later they came to\ncheck. So the American customs, they opened the valises, they [indecipherable]. And\nwe were staying there in -- where -- where the [indecipherable] then a\n[indecipherable] a heavy set guy in the -- in the -- in the lumber jacket comes in and\nhe goes around and he ask where 1s it, where are the Saleschutz\u2019s? Sa -- so we were\nvery much afraid, maybe -- figured maybe something is wrong, and they would ship us\nback or something. We didn\u2019t say anything in the beginning and later he said, \u201cWell,\ntheir should -- was supposed to be two people with the name Saleschutz,\u201d yeah. So\nmy wife was standing there, and she said, \u201cYes, we are Saleschutz.\u201d And \u201cWhat\u2019s\nwrong, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d We were so afraid. So he said, \u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d And he\ngot up to my wife and he kissed her, he got up to me, he said, \u201cYou know, I am,\u201d --\nand we thought this 1s some official, he said, \u201cI am Yagi, Reisel\u2019s son.\u201d Later he\nbecame Jake. In America [indecipherable], \u201cI am Yagi and I find out that you are\ncoming, so I came in here.\u201d Now he could go in -- in the -- yeah, right away, when we\nwere standing, and all the people didn\u2019t know what -- what to think. And he right away\ncalled the custom man and the custom came and he didn\u2019t open anything, he just put in\na piece of paper on this and he called a longshoreman, and he took the two suitcase we\nhave and put them in. And he -- all the people are waiting, they\u2019re waiting, and we\nwere taken out, and they -- they thought, who knows, that probably we are the\n30\nFebruary 9, 2001\npresident of the United States and so on. And we ta -- he took us out in the -- right on\nthe sidewalk when we took us out, a car was waiting and we went in in the car and this\nwas -- my brother was waiting 1n the car, they couldn\u2019t park there, but through him\nthey parked. So we find out later, and w-we said, this Jack he had -- he became Jack,\nhe had a luncheonette on the -- on -- by the docks. And everybody ate by him, and they\nknew him. And when he find out that we are coming, so he came in and he took us out.\nNaturally this was a very surprise -- and a pleasant surprise in America. And later we\nfind out he was a very nice fellow. And this is how we arrived. We arrived -- this is the\n17\" of January in 1947.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yeah, I was sick right the second day. I didn\u2019t eat all the whole time. My wife\nwasn\u2019t sick. Now, we were sick in the [indecipherable] that was terrible sick, so she\nsomehow -- she didn\u2019t have -- I -- I couldn\u2019t eat anything, and -- and so she em -- met\nar -- a Sailor and he was a black sailor, so she told him I am sick, so he used to give\nher an -- an apple, a banana, something like this, she brought it to me. But I was -- I\nwas very -- I couldn\u2019t -- I was very sick, do it -- all the time. Di -- and -- and the trip\nlasted 14 days.\n31\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: Well, the wer -- the work process, first in America, I had the very unpleasant thing\n-- see, my brother took me to his home, and I stayed with my bro -- he had his own\nhouse, and I stayed with his house two weeks. After two weeks he said that I have to\nlook for an apartment, because in America two weeks is enough, and then later you\n[indecipherable] the fami -- and so -- so I brought with me 200 dollars. 200 dollars I\nbrought, they were hundred dollar bill, two hundred dollar bills, but they were the long\nhundred dollar bills, maybe you remember they were the long one, not the new one in\nthere and so my brother said we\u2019|l go to the bank, we\u2019ll put it in the bank. And we\nwent with him to the bank, to his bank. And the girl who took it looked and looked,\nand she called the manager, and the manager looked at it and he said those are\ncounterfeit money. He said, well by right I have to call the FBI, and see, because if\nyou just came over, maybe you smu -- maybe with the ring, but he\u2019s going to do us a\nfavor. He did us a favor and he took a match and he burned the 200 dollars. He said, \u201cI\nwill not call nobody,\u201d and later of -- well, today, I am very sorry that he did it, because\nI\u2019m a -- a-- acoin collector and a bank note collector, so today those -- this money\nwas made in Auschwitz, they had Jewish engravers and artists, and they made false\n32\nFebruary 9, 2001\nmoney. And Germany used this money all over the world. So today, a hundred dollar\nbill which was counterfeit and was in Auschwitz is worth 10,000 dollars. But they\nburned it and this was my -- so then I had to look for a job. Now before -- before\nlooking for a job, so the family got together. I had uncles and I had cousins, and some\ncousins were very rich. So we got together and they said, what should we do with the\nboy. It means me. I was in this time 27 years. My wife and -- got a first job she got in -\n- to make ties. But she didn\u2019t know how to sew, so she worked there one week and the\nwoman said, \u201cYou know, you didn\u2019t make enough, even half what I\u2019m going to pay\nyou, and I -- you can -- you can leave.\u201d But she went and she got a permit to be a\nHebrew teacher, yeah, so in the beginning she got the permi -- a temporary permit and\nlater [indecipherable] she got a -- so I lived on her -- on her salary. But I -- we found\nan apartment, it was very hard to find an apartment, so Italian man took us 1n in his\napartment, he had two rooms. And he -- we were in one room, and he didn\u2019t want to\ntake money for being [indecipherable] so he said you stay here, and we were there,\nand it was a very bad in a -- over a factory and then -- and we had a lot of mice. We\nhad a small kitchen and he had his bedroom. We had in the living room we slept in.\nThen later he left for Italy, and I remember his name was Rosario. He left for Italy,\nand then he said -- he gave us over the apartment, 1t was very hard to find apartment.\nNow [had to get a job. So I didn\u2019t have a trade, and my English wasn\u2019t good, so a\n33February 9, 2001\ncousin got me a job in the same house in a ink factory. And the ink factory was very,\nvery bad for me, because there were 11 people. There were 10 blacks, I was one white,\nwhich 1s all right. But the boss, the owner, to the -- when the black boys came in he\nused to tell them good morning. When I came in, I said good morning, he never\nanswered.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\n34February 9, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: -- now I had to get a job. So I didn\u2019t have a trade, and my English wasn\u2019t good, so a\ncousin got me a job in the same house in a ink factory. And the ink factory was very,\nvery bad for me, because there were 11 people. There were 10 blacks, I was one white,\nwhich 1s all right. But the boss, the owner, to the -- when the black boys came in he\nused to tell them good morning. When I came in, I said good morning, he never\nanswered. And then -- and then he disliked me from the first minute. And I knew that I\nwill not be able to be there long. So I had the friend -- and I almost got crazy, I wanted\nto commit suicide, because here -- from Poland I was a big shot and I came over here\nand I was nothing. I -- I couldn\u2019t make a living. I made a -- the first job, I remember I\nmade 21 dollars a week. And 21 dollars a week, my wife, as a teacher, she made more\nthan double. So what -- and about 21 dollars. So I knew that I will not stay there long.\nSo I went to my friend, he was a psychiatrist and he came with me on one ship. He\nwas the head of Graystone Park, that is a mental hospital. And I told him that I -- I\u2019m\ngoing crazy, I will commit suicide. So he said, \u201cYou have to quit the job because you\ncannot,\u201d -- what my job was, I f -- in a ink factory I filled out every -- there were three\ntrays with ink. I had the gadget and I put in and I fill up the ink, all day staying there.\nSo I was thinking and I will li -- I -- I lived through the whole war during every day.\nSo he said, \u201cYou have to quit, you have to go to have a job, you should work with your\n35February 9, 2001\nmind. Not like this.\u201d So -- so he -- so -- in -- in -- in -- to quit, I figured before I quit I\nhave to take care of my boss, who made my life miserable. So I took care of him --\nwell, not -- then -- do you want me take -- how I take care?",
        "A: All right, so I worked on this -- in the factory and -- and this man, he made my -- he\ngave me -- he start to call me a very bad name. He was Jewish and he was from\nPoland, but he was already here 25 years, yes, so he was a big shot. So -- and -- so I\nwas -- like for instance, I don\u2019t know if I told you this the last time, we also made -- by\nink, we also made mucilage, the glue. We were -- you know what mucilage 1s -- is,\nyeah? So we made this, and when we made it we had to put in a big container, powder\nwith water and this had to boil. But while it was boiling you had to mix it, or otherwise\nit would burn. So I used to mix it, so he comes in and he\u2019s -- calls me bad names, he\nsaid not to mix it from the left to the right, but from the right to the left. I says,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cBecause I want it so.\u201d So I said -- and he showed\nme how. So we made one batch his way, and it took 15 minutes longer than my way.\nSo I said, \u201cYou see, mine goes faster.\u201d He said, \u201cStill I want my way.\u201d And he -- he\nabu -- he -- he abused me, so I said someday I will teach you a lesson. And -- and\nwhen -- when -- we had this cage, it was about like a room with the ink that we put in\nin the bottles the ink, and when it was empty, so we washed it out, so when it was\n36\nFebruary 9, 2001\nempty, so I took a -- a stopper, a cork from the mucilage and I put it into the spigot in\nthe inside, and then later we filled it up with water, and we -- with powder, and with\nthe mechanical mixerer. And then when I started to put in wa -- it didn\u2019t go. It didn\u2019t\ngo. He couldn\u2019t understand why, so he went up on the ladder, and this was like a --\nlike a -- like -- like a ha -- like a room. He tried with a wire to push through. More he\npushed, worse it was, and then later he couldn\u2019t reach it, he put -- put -- he took a box,\nput in the ladder on the box and th-then try. I don\u2019t know what happened, this was a\nfull -- it was maybe thousands of gallons of ink, and something happens that he bent\nover and he fell in there. He almost drowned and he started to yell, they pulled him up.\nAs they pulled him out and -- and -- and -- and bi -- he was still dripping with the ink,\nand he gave me a name -- there 1s a expression, and -- for a refugee or a\n[indecipherable], they called him a greener -- a greener [indecipherable] but he gave\nme two names. He g-gave me a greener tookas, it means a green ass, that\u2019s how -- and\nthis how he called me. And I was very angry [indecipherable] so when -- the minute\nwe pulled him out, so tha -- the first thing he said, \u201cNobody did it but the greener\ntookas.\u201d So -- so then -- and then he didn\u2019t know how he fell in, but he was on the lad\n-- on the ladder, I -- so happens that I went through and -- and I did it. But he didn\u2019t\nknow. So he said you fired. So I s -- this was on a Wednesday, I remember, I said,\n\u201cNo, y -- I cannot be fired.\u201d He said, \u201c\u201cWhat do you mean you cannot be fired?\u201d I said,\n37\nFebruary 9, 2001\n\u201cBecause I quit last Friday.\u201d So I lost a few days, he never paid me. So then I went\ninto other jobs and like I said, I had so many jobs, but each job --",
        "A: Oh, I had -- I had about eight, nine jobs, I don\u2019t know. Because each job or -- you\nsee, there were two reasons that -- or I was -- I wanted to -- a device to make it better,\nor to do something, so they said well what -- he\u2019s going to tell me, the boss, he had to\nteach me. And then I -- ye -- also, when I -- when I went on a job, the first day, the\nsecond day, I always was thinking, how long will it take me to take over this business,\nyou know? This was in my mind, or -- not to take away th -- to be in this business.\nWell, anyway, some guy, I told him to co -- to correct, do this, and then I -- yeah, I -- I\n-- you see, I was always -- home I was a businessman. I was not staying there just to\nwork and not to -- well, anyway, after about a year and meanwhile -- and my wife got\nthe job, so she -- from her money that we -- she made, so for one week we lived for\ntwo weeks, because we lived -- pay -- rents we didn\u2019t pay, and everything was so\ncheap and we didn\u2019t go out. I remember I had to make a phone call, it was five dol --\nfive cents, we had to think twice to make the phone call. And -- and after -- after -- I\neven had my own business, I worked in a -- in a remnants place, we used to export\nremnants. I didn\u2019t call them remnants, I called remnantses because there were a lot of\nthem. So one is a remnant, a lot is remnantses. So I --\n38\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, you me -- yeah. Well, so I went and I looked for a job, but I -- one uncle is --\nwho was very nice, he was a poor uncle, and he never made a living, cause everything\nwas on his mind, the whole family. So he was very nice, so he went with me, and there\nwas one cousin, and he -- and -- and -- and they had the largest silk company in the\nUnited States, lining for [indecipherable] silk. Ven -- they were very well known,\nand -- and so I went to -- to the f -- to -- to them Sunday morning to visit the father, to\nask my job. He said, \u201cWell, I am retired, but my son is the owner now from the how --\nfrom the business you go to him.\u201d So he -- so I went over the next day naturally, I got\ndressed in my best, a European coat, a European suit, a European hat. And naturally it\nwas not like in America. So I came in, there was a beautiful receptionist, and then she\nask me what I want, so I -- my English, I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m a cousin of -- of the -- your\nboss,\u201d and his name was Saleschutz, they never changed the name. I wanted -- so she\ntold him and I went in. I went in, he was sitting by his desk, he didn\u2019t go a -- didn\u2019t get\n39\nFebruary 9, 2001\nup, he didn\u2019t shake hands. He looked at me and the first words he said, \u201cWhat do you\nwant?\u201d So I told him, I saw yesterday your father and I need a job, I just came from --\nno, the girl asked me who are you. I said, \u201cI have the same name as your boss. His\nname is Saleschutz, I am Saleschutz.\u201d Because this was before I changed my name.\nSo then he said what do you want. So I said, \u201cI came and I need a job.\u201d And he -- they\n-- they had about 300 people working there. So he looked and looked at me, and he\ntook out a wallet from his pocket, he took out a hundred dollar bill, put it on the table,\nand he said, \u201cTake it, and get off my back.\u201d And when he said to this, naturally I didn\u2019t\ntake the hundred dollars. Now, the tears filled up my eyes, and I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t -- I\ncouldn\u2019t answer anything, and I couldn\u2019t cry. It was like -- like sometimes you fall\ndown from a -- from a ladder and -- and then -- and I was standing there, and -- and the\nminute I was standing there, when he told me this, and this went through very fast in\nmy mind, and what would I do if he would come to Poland, and -- and -- and he will\nsay this is my cousin. So I -- I visualize that I was in this time in -- in the army, I will\nmake a -- a review, I-I put him on the reviewing stand [indecipherable] the army,\nwe'll go there, through will salute, and I'll tell everybody this is my cousin. But here\nhe said to me, take the hundred dollars, get off my back. So I didn\u2019t take it. Then,\nwhen I didn\u2019t take it, he took it back, and put it in in his wallet, and he said, \u201cWell,\nanother thought I\u2019m going to give it to United Jewish Appeal, let them do what they\n40\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwant with this money.\u201d And I run out, and as I came to this receptionist\n[indecipherable] room, I burst out in -- not in crying, but li -- I couldn\u2019t breathe. And\nI run out, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d So I said nothing\u2019s wrong, and I\nwould run out, and I was staying in the hallway, and I was crying. I was 27 years old\nand I was crying. A man goes through, and -- and he said, \u201cHey mister, what\u2019s wrong,\nwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d So I said to him, \u201cAre you an American Jew?\u201d He said yes. So I said,\n\u201cYou know, you should have been in Auschwitz and be killed.\u201d To him. So he said,\n\u201cWhy you say, why you curse at me there?\u201d He says becau -- so I said to him, \u201cWhy\nshould my father -- father be killed because he\u2019s a Jew, and you live here, and you\nhave everything.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what I am saying, it was a -- so he said, \u201cHey, why\nyou cursing me?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d So he says, \u201cYou know what, you ate lunch?\u201d\nI said no. He said, \u201cI want you should come with me, I\u2019m going to eat lunch.\u201d So I\nwent with him. And I stop crying, and I remember we went into a luncheonette. And\nthe first time I had this -- and he -- oh, he ask me what do you want. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow, I will have the same thing you have.\u201d So I remember he ask [indecipherable]\ncheese with the -- with the vegetables with radishes, with onions, with -- all chopped\nup together. And I liked it so I said I will have the same. And I ate, ate, I felt better. So\nhe -- so he said, \u201cYou want the other one?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, one 1s enough.\u201d He said, \u201cNow\ntell me, why did you curse me, why did you cry?\u201d So I told him the story. I told him\n41\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhe\u2019s my cousin, and yeah. So he said, \u201cIt so happens that I am one of his customers.\u201d I\nsaid you should go -- he said, \u201cYou come with me. And I want you should hit the son\nof a bitch in his nose, in his face, but I want to see blood.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\nnothing will happen to you, I will be with you.\u201d I said you go and this guy deserved --\nso I said, \u201cNo, I only can tell you one thing, so long as I will be alive, I will never\nspeak to him.\u201d He gave me his card, and I remember his name was Louis Siegel, and -\n- and he gave me, he said, \u201cYou come and see me when you feel better.\u201d And I came\nto him and he used to buy -- he used to get re -- well, now remnantses. And he used to\nsee it to people who use like [indecipherable]. And how did he get? He got -- he got\nthese remnants -- remnants illegal. Why illegal? Because when they send over to a\nconverter material, and when they dyed it, and then after the dyeing, always shrunk\nmaybe one percent, two percent. But he was a partner with the guy from the dyeing\nand he shrunk five percent. So from each piece he got a piece of six, seven yards. And\nhe got those things. Now, he paid 40 cents a -- a pound, and he sold it for four dollars a\npound. So he said to me, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you every week a case of remnants.\u201d And\nhe gave me the address where to sell it. And he told me how much to s -- for how\nmuch to sell it. And he said to -- to me, \u201cI will charge you what I pay for it.\u201d A\nstranger. And I went to him, and I did it once, maybe once a week, maybe once a\nmonth, how much he told me to give it, and I took those things and I dragged it to the\n42\nFebruary 9, 2001\nplace -- to the wholesale place, and I accumulate nice money. And he was always\nhappy, he told me, this is what you have to get [indecipherable]. One day I come into\nhim, he was sitting, he was not sha -- yeah, this was when I want to -- when I came to\nhim, it\u2019s the first time that I saw a shirt white on white, I never saw it before, so I\nlooked at him and I said something, a beautiful shirt, yeah. So and one day I come in\nand he was sitting there not shaved and this and that, so I said, [indecipherable] what\nhappened? He said -- he said to me, \u201cI\u2019m in trouble. I\u2019m in trouble, and the police is\nafter me.\u201d And he lost everything. And he lost everything, so I lost everything. But he\nwas the nicest guy in the -- he had a strange -- I never saw him [indecipherable]\nfamily, nothing. So then later I started on my own to buy, but I didn\u2019t have money to\ndo it. Now, there was a question about my name. Now, th-the -- my -- my family -- yo",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, well then later I had this [indecipherable] job, this job, then later somebody\ntold me what do you have, what do you need the job, I will give you a good job. And\n43\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhe had the wholesale place on in the -- on the east side that peddlers used to buy by\nhim dry goods and this. So he said to me that -- and there -- and now then I met a lot of\npeople who were peddlers and everybody in this time they made money. So he said to\nme, \u201cWell, don\u2019t look for a job, I'll tell you what to do. I will give you merchandise\nand you go out, and I will tell you, and you sell it on payments, and you don\u2019t have to\nbuy the merchandise. And -- and then -- then later you will collect, we will split the\nprofit.\u201d So he says, \u201cHow do you like it?\u201d Said -- so I said, \u201cI like it very much under\none exception.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, what\u2019s the exception?\u201d I said, \u201cI will -- you will give\nme merchandise and then later we\u2019ll be partners.\u201d I said, \u201cI will get the merchandise,\nbut I don\u2019t want partners.\u201d [indecipherable] So I -- they gave me some credit, and I\nstarted to -- to go to Jersey City, because in Jersey City there were Polish people. And\nthen the problem was that all my customers lived on the fifth floor -- on the fourth\nfloor, there were no elevators, and I had two suitcase, and I had to drag the suit -- I\ncouldn\u2019t leave them downstairs, so I dragged them upstairs. And one time I came into\none Polish woman, and she was a young woman maybe 28 - 29 years, and the door\nwas open, and I hear she yells in it\u2019s -- the child cries. So she -- she -- and she didn\u2019t\nknow I am in the doorway, and she started to scream on the child, she said, \u201cStop\ncrying because if you don\u2019t stop crying, the Jew -- the Jew will come, he will take you\naway in his sack.\u201d This what she told to the child. So the child stopped crying. Then\n44February 9, 2001\nwhen -- when -- then she goes out, she saw me, sh-she was a little -- not worried, but\nshe [indecipherable]. So I asked her, \u201cTell me, how come that you said to the child,\nstop crying because the Jew will come and take you away in the sack? So I mean, how\nmany Jews did you see that they come around and they grab children?\u201d She said,\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, but I remember when I cried, my mother used to tell me this. I\nalways was so afraid that I stopped crying. So I am telling it to her.\u201d And what I\nunderstood that this child will grow up and this child will tell it to her children. And\nthis 1s how the -- the heritage from -- from those people who didn\u2019t know why she\nsaid, but she said it. So then, b-being a peddler, I -- I made out very well. And I\nremember the first day, I have to tell you [indecipherable] becoming a peddler, I used\nto make 21 dollars a week. So then later when I became a peddler, so they told me\nsome -- some man told me, he brought me to a man, and he said to me to buy\nchildren\u2019s socks. So I bought hundred dozen children\u2019s socks in two suitcases. And I\npaid -- I paid two dollars a dozen. And I went to Jersey City. In one day I sold a\nhundred -- everybody had children, and I sold them for three dollars a dozen, three\ndollars a dozen was cheap. And I made a dollar a dozen. And I sold in one day,\nhundred dozen children\u2019s socks, and I made hundred dollars profit. When I made the\nhundred dollars profit -- this was the first day, I remember. So I said -- people used to\nsay that in America money is laying on the street. It is laying on the street, but you\n45\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhave to know how to pick it up. I said, this is for me. This is my country. If I could\nmake the first day a hundred dollars a day, so I will -- I will remain a peddler. And\nstarted to sell socks, then underwear, th-the dresses, then curtains, and I wind up the\nend with furniture. I sold only furniture, I had the warehouse. So this was the\nbeginning of being a peddler. So I was about 10 years -- 10 years a peddler til I\nbecame a builder.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. When we -- when -- it was 29 -- in 1949, I was in America al -- almost --\nalmost two years, and I accumulate enough money to go to -- also my wife in this time\nwas a Hebrew teacher. And there was a special in the Hebrew University, there were\nspecial courses for American Hebrew teachers. They -- they wanted to -- to make it a\nhigher level. So sh -- we went and we did the train -- this was the first time there was a\nplane to Israel in \u201949. In the -- before there were no plane -- planes. So we went in the\n-- today, takes six hours to go to Israel. In this time it took us 36 hours. We went -- we\nstopped in Newfoundland -- Newfoundland, we stopped in Shannon, we stopped in -\n46\nFebruary 9, 2001\n- in Switzerland, we stopped in Rome, cause they had to refuel, and -- and then we\ncame to Israel. I remember -- and they had a lot of problems, the people who were\nwith us 1n the -- on the -- on the plane, because we stopped in all those places, so we\nwent down. And every time we went down we couldn\u2019t go up because we didn\u2019t have\nper -- papers, we only had a piece of paper that we are -- and we just came. So it took\nlong, and they didn\u2019t like it, but anyway, we came to Israel. And I will never forget\nthe -- th-the feeling when -- when the plane came over Israel, you s -- look out\nthrough the window, you see s -- yellow sand, yellow sand. Then later, suddenly you\nsee like a nice green, garden. And this was Israel [indecipherable]. And when we\nwere [indecipherable] we started to sing, and -- and then I went down, so I lay --\nkneeled down on the ground, and I started to kiss the -- the -- the earth, and we started\nto cry, and -- and -- and it was -- the family was waiting for us, my wife\u2019s family, my\nbrother was family and they took us home. And t -- they were very happy as --\nnaturally it\u2019s the first time that -- that my wife saw her grandmother after the war, that\nshe survived, and my brother, and with the children. Now, we came -- we wanted to\nremain. And we said we have nothing in -- in America. We -- I make a living, but we\nhave no ties. Th-The -- the rooms, we had the same room where this Italian guy gave\nus, and we wanted -- and then it was very bad in Israel. I don\u2019t know if you know\nwhat means senna. Senna was a time that -- that everything was on cards, you\n47\nFebruary 9, 2001\ncouldn\u2019t buy this, you couldn\u2019t buy this, and the people didn\u2019t made money -- it was a\nvery t-terrib -- because they had all the new immigrants, there was no industry. So we\nsaid to -- I -- I said I always wanted to -- to live in Israel, and I -- so we -- so the\nfamily got together, and they said, \u201cYou -- you came too late.\u201d Why too late? Would\nyou come when you wanted before the war, I could be very imp-important in the war.\nThey didn\u2019t have professional soldiers, I was, and -- and I wanted to fight for Israel,\nbut the war is ended, and the -- everybody -- so what will you do, you will come over\nhere, we will have two more mouths to feed, we don\u2019t have food. And we then -- what\nwill you do, and you -- says you are in America, you establish yourself a little bit, you\nmaking out all right. Go back, make money, send us the money. And this was the\nreason why -- and my wife wanted to stay because she had there a sister, and her sister\nwas starving, she had the farm, and they didn\u2019t have what to give to eat to the\nchickens, it was -- 1t was terrible. So we came back and -- and this was -- th -- then\nlater we went every year, every two years, but this was the re -- the reason we went\nover, because we wanted to stay. Because I s-said if I survive the war, I have to g -- I\nhave to live in Israel. And even til today, my biggest regret, if you ask me about\nregrets in life, my biggest regret 1s that I didn\u2019t go to Israel, not in this time, but before\nIsrael was established. Because if I -- who would -- who had to go? I was 27 years\nold. Who had to go to Israel to fight, if not a survivor of the Holocaust who was 27\n48\nFebruary 9, 2001\nyears old? And special when I had the schooling what the Russians gave me, the\nschooling that I could ba -- so even til today, I always say this is my biggest regret.\nAnd I have articles in this new book about those things.",
        "A: Yeah, well, when I was starting in the first year, so I belonged to undergrounds,\nwhich from like they were illegal -- illegal organizations. You probably know there\nwas the Haganah, but there were more radicals, it was the -- the sten group, the atsel\nwhere Begin was. So I belonged to those organizations, because I was in my mind --\nmy mind was, eventually I want to go. This was before Israel was li -- was\nestablished. So we -- we had -- there was one man, he sa -- he was a major in the\nBritish army, he\u2019s no -- his name was Weiser. He actually was from South Africa, but\nhe was in British army. And he came to America, and he organize, and he called it\nGeorge Washington Legion. And the George Washington -- because there was once\na George Washington Legion that they went in to fight for Ireland, but this was\nbefore. So he organized this and he got people together, he wanted to organize it here,\nand to -- equipped -- to be equipped here, and to go to Palestine in this time to fight as\na unit. And he -- we worked, and we -- we had meetings every week, and I remember\n49\nFebruary 9, 2001\nthe meetings were -- there was a hotel, Algonquin Hotel in New York. We had to\nhave the meetings, naturally. I went to the meeting, now everybody in mostly Mosul\nthey had people who belonged to this that were veterans, who came back from --\nAmerican veterans, who didn\u2019t have what to do. They came back, some were Zionists,\nsome were not Zionists, that they wanted to do something. Also, we had a -- a lot of\nblack soldiers that they came, and tha -- this was a opportunity. So we ha -- and I were\n-- and they establish a staff, and I was picked up, in the staff I was picked out -- I was\nmade that I am the head of the military police, because my background in Poland, so\nlo -- and I was very happy, and we worked and wer -- and then it was -- he tried to get\nthe permission from the American government, and they refused him. They said that\nyou can go individually, but not as organization. A-A-Again, individually, 1t means\nillegal. But not as our -- he wanted to have a organization equipped, and money should\ncome from America. So when I -- when this happened to them in this time, I also -- I\nstarted -- I belonged -- this was liquidated, so I belonged to the atsel, to the extreme\nrevolutionaries, they\u2019re from Israel, so I belonged and then I wanted to go and they\nprepared. And my je -- I worked, but also my job was that we collected guns from\nveterans in America and we sent them over. Now, the guns had to be packed. So we\nhad a place, by some Jew who he -- was a furrier on 27\" Street, and I went there after I\nworked, I went over ev-every night, and what we did, we -- we cleaned the guns, and\n50February 9, 2001\nwe put them -- we packed them in barrels, and we closed it, and then there was\ncamouflage [indecipherable] material, and -- and this had to go to Israel, to pal -- to\nPalestine in this time for the people from the atsel. And then one day we were packing\nthis and the police came in. Somebody in -- squealed, I don\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know what,\nand they arrested us. They -- we were there about eight, nine people. They arrested,\nthey confiscated the -- the guns, and I was taken to jail.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- And one day we were packing this and the police came in. Somebody in --\nsquealed, I don\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know what, and they arrested us. They -- we were there\nabout eight, nine people. They arrested, they confiscated the -- the guns, and I was\ntaken to jail. And I was 1n jail a herely -- I -- I just came from Europe and I was a\nstranger and I\u2019m already in jail. And I was there overnight, and the next day a group\ncame, and the police, and started to interrogate us. And then after they ask me\nquestions, they let us go. So they let us go, the reason why is because there were a lot\nof influential Jews in th -- with the police together. Well, now, legally I didn\u2019t have to\nlook here, we pack [indecipherable] everything was illegal, but they let us go, they\nsaid to go out. So -- but I still went there, and they prepared us to go illegal, through\nMarseilles, to France to go to Israel. I even -- we had a cousin, she was a nurse in the\n51\nFebruary 9, 2001\nhospital, and I talked her in, and she said she will go with us. And then one day -- one\nday I came there and they said well, Sunday morning you transport is going, and -- and\nI came home, and I said to my wife, I am going, and she was against it. And I started --\nI took what I could, a -- a knapsack, and I -- and she said to me, \u201cIf you are going you\nmust know one thing. You are going but you cannot come back to me. I will not wait\nfor you, and I don\u2019t care what, because I know you will go, you will be killed. And --\nand -- and -- and I don\u2019t -- I lost too many people in -- in -- in Europe, and I don\u2019t\nwant to have [indecipherable] so you -- you can go, I cannot stop you. But you cannot\ncome back to me.\u201d Well, I felt very bad, and we had to meet in this hotel, we had to\nmeet Sunday morning and then a truck had to take us in -- to the -- to a boat, to go to --\nto ma -- to France, and from France to Israel. And I got what I had to take and I went\nthere -- over there, and -- and then they -- when I was there, so I was thinking wa --\nwhat my wife told me, and I said I am not going. They were very much surprised\nbecause they liked me. Now, my cousin, th -- ma -- Marilyn Petranka, she went, and\nshe was a nurse during the war, and she met a -- a young English doctor who was\nJewish, and they fell in love, and they got married, and they live now in Canada. They\nhave children. But she was in during the whole war, because they needed nurses and\nshe was a registered nurse. And I never, never went. This was -- this was before --\nbefore \u00b040 -- it was in \u00b040 s -- in \u201947, the year that we arrived to America.\n52\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: Well, first I have to tell you -- I don\u2019t know if I told you about changing my name,\nthis 1s very important. I don\u2019t know if I told you the last time?",
        "A: Yeah, okay [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, th -- in the beginning, all my fre -- you see, my family, I had a large family,\nand my family was very, very not helpful. Like -- also, we came to America, you see -\n- wh-when we wanted to go to Palestine in this time, and I wanted to go to America if\nwe cannot go to Palestine, because I said that all the cousins are my age. Why? See,\nmy father was the youngest from -- from the brothers, I was the youngest from us. And\nthey had children and the children were my age. I said, I have cousins. This uncle has\nchildren, this uncle has children. So they were -- we will be close. They were very --\nthey never invited us. We were strange to them. And -- and 1n -- th-they were -- the\nchildren were rich, they didn\u2019t give me jobs. And we asked them for it. Now, the\nreason why is because they looked on us with the eyes as they will see their parents\ncame when they came in 1885 - 1890. When they came in 18 ni -- in 1890, they came\nfrom a village. They never wore shoes in the village. They were not educated. They\ncame over here when they were 14 -- eight -- 14 - 15 - 16 years, and they had to start\n53February 9, 2001\nin -- in the -- in -- they never made out of -- of their life something. One was a presser,\none was a tailor, one was a button hole maker. The children already were educated --\nwere [indecipherable]. So they looked at us, they didn\u2019t realize that we had a\nprogress. America also had a progress. America in 1947 was not the same as in 1885.\nBut they looked at us with the stories what their parents told us -- told them. So we\nwere never their friends -- they were never -- which we expected to be liked. For\ninstance, there is one woman, she still a -- she\u2019s 94 years now, and she was my first\ncousin, her name was Frances. And I was already six months here and I didn\u2019t see\nFrances and I knew the stories about Frances, because she was a older woman, she\nwas already 32 years and she wasn\u2019t married. So my father, everything was on his\nmind. So he always, my father, when he had problems, when he thinks\n[indecipherable] so he used ta -- take his beard, and he used to chew his beard. So\nwhen he chews his beard, so we said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He said Frances. He got a\nletter Frances wasn\u2019t married, she\u2019s already 32 years. He always worried about\nFrances. So when Frances -- when I was [indecipherable] then later she got married,\nshe had a daughter. I was six months, so once I called up Frances. I says, \u201cFrances,\nI\u2019m already here six months, and -- and my father always worried about you, and I\nwanted to see you.\u201d She was a daughter of my father\u2019s sister. So she said, \u201cOh yeah.\u201d\nThis was a Sunday, and I had already -- I spent five cents for a telephone call. She\n54\nFebruary 9, 2001\nsaid, \u201cYeah, I would like to see you too, come over sometimes.\u201d So I says, \u201cFrances,\nwhy should I come over sometimes? Today is Sunday, I don\u2019t work, my wife doesn\u2019t\nwork. Why can\u2019t we come over today?\u201d Because she lived in Brooklyn too. She said,\n\u201cOh, I already have some friends coming to my house.\u201d When she said to me this, I-I -\n- | -- I didn\u2019t say anything, I hung up. Now, if she had friends, this was the best time to\ninvite us, we should be -- and we should know fre -- so what, she was afraid to show\noff with the -- the greener animals, or those things, so this was their feeling. Now, my\nwife was more educated than they. Now, for instance, in the beginning they were very\n-- they were angry at me why I -- I got married. So my wife was beautiful, she was\nvery intelligent, she spoke seven languages, and everything -- they didn\u2019t -- so -- so\nthey said -- even my brother said to me, \u201cWhy do you have to rush? You are a young\nfellow, you are not so bad looking, you could marry here a woman. All right, maybe\nshe would be a -- a divorc\u00e9e, or a -- maybe she\u2019Il be a little older, but she will have\ntwo houses, she will have a business, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry, you wouldn\u2019t have\nto start for scratch, why do you have to marry?\u201d Now, I couldn\u2019t understand instead to\nbe happy, that I brought over my wife, that she was prettier than they, she was more\nintelligent than they, she was smarter than they, she survived the war. So they said,\nwhy did you have to rush, why ya -- and I was 27 years. You see, th -- the -- there was\nno feeling, there was no understanding. There was only this one elderly -- the -- the\n55\nFebruary 9, 2001\none, the poor brother, Shulem we called him. He was the one nice guy. From the rest,\nthere was no -- see, my wife\u2019s family was different. My wife\u2019s family took us in like --\nlike a family. Why? Because they knew them. My wife\u2019s family came in \u201938, so whe --\nthey lived in Berlin. So they knew them, they used to come and visit them\n[indecipherable] they knew them how they lived, they knew them how they went to\nschool, they knew them they were different people. So they took us in like we would\nbe their children, even til today.",
        "A: Yes, I had friends, mostly we had friends survivors. We fre -- we had a few friends\nwho were survivors, right away I was involved in a group, and people that I knew from\nPoland, and also people who were very appreciative what I did for them in Poland,\nand -- and we remained friends til today. And -- and the only thing is that now all\nthose people are dying out. They\u2019re dying out but -- but we still have this, and even\ntoday, mostly we -- we are close mostly with people who are survivors. We have some\nwho are not, neighbors, this, but 1-it\u2019s not a deep friendship as -- because they cannot\nunderstand. And -- and -- the -- the -- the -- look, I belong, see I-I\u2019m -- I am different\nthan my wife. My wife, she b -- she does -- if she belongs to organization, she just\npays the dues and that\u2019s it. And if I belong to organization, I have to be active. I used\nto be president from my Kobulshovera [indecipherable] from the town. I am still\n56\nFebruary 9, 2001\npresident from the Israeli Red Cross. I\u2019m president from here, I\u2019m president -- why?\nBecause if I am involved, I have to be involved, otherwise I don\u2019t want to bother. My\nwife -- now, from all those groups that -- that I am involved with the organizations, we\nhave friends, but we are, I don\u2019t know, so close as with the people who are survivors.\nFor instance, last year I had a very big -- things happened. I bi -- the B\u2019nai Brith --\nyou know what B\u2019nai Brith -- and I used to be very active, and I am still -- and we\nhave a -- a board from the local B\u2019nai Brith, and -- and once a month we have a\nmeeting, and -- and then once we always make a, once a year, on one of the meetings\nwe have a film. And we show the film and the people come and the m -- the\nmembership, not only the board. So when th-the president said, let\u2019s have a film, I saw\na film from Woody Allen. And Woody Allen, a wonderful comedy, let\u2019s have a film\nfrom him. I -- I don\u2019t like Woody Allen as a human being, I don\u2019t like him as a Jew, I\ndon\u2019t like him at all, because he\u2019s too -- he\u2019s -- so I said why should we have Woody\nAllen\u2019s film? It so happens that I got a new film, it\u2019s called, \u201cThe Rescuers,\u201d maybe\nyou saw it. And \u201cThe Rescuers\u201d is a wonderful film, it is -- the first is a Polish girl, a\nPolish woman who was -- took a -- a Jewish boy for two years. The father of the\nJewish boy was a doctor, the mother was lawyer, but anyway, they became -- she was\na nanny for the boy, and they were taken away and they were killed, and they gave the\nboy to the -- this woman. And she promised them to -- that she will save it. And it\n57\nFebruary 9, 2001\nshows the whole film how she save it, her problems she had. She survived the war and\nthe boy went to pales -- to Israel, and she went with him to Israel. She never changed\nher religion. She\u2019s Catholic, but she wanted to be with the boy, and the boy is happy,\nhe studied. Beautiful story. And then the second story is about the French woman, a\nFrench woman, she never ge -- never saw Jews. And in her village there was -- they --\nthey started -- those were -- how you call the French that they who -- who --\nHuguenots?",
        "A: Yeah, so they were very friendly and they took in about 40 Jews, Jewish children,\nand the whole village tried to save them. And this girl, she was a young girl, worked --\na secretary by the bishop. And -- and -- and she helped -- and she saved about 40. It\u2019s a\nbeautiful -- you know. So I said let\u2019s show the -- it\u2019s not a bloody thing that people\ndon\u2019t want to see. It is a human interest, like two girls, two persons, two women, how\nthey saved the Jews, it\u2019s very beautiful. And when I said it, let\u2019s have this film. So one\nguy was sitting there, he said, \u201cStop with this crap of the Holocaust. Only I hear is this\ncrap the Holocaust, Holocaust, I have it til here. Isn\u2019t it time we shouldn\u2019t talk about\nthe Holocaust?\u201d When he started to say crap, crap, Holocaust, either I -- I was so numb\nthat I couldn\u2019t answer him, I couldn\u2019t believe it. Then later when I felt better, so I\nopened my mouth. I said, \u201cYou call the Holocaust crap? Six million Jews were killed.\n58\nFebruary 9, 2001\nIt was just yesterday, I\u2019m still alive. A million and a half children. And -- and you\nshould say it on a Jewish -- in a Jewish organization, B\u2019nai Brith?\u201d And I -- and --\nand, so he said, \u201cWell we suffered too.\u201d I says, \u201cWhen did you suffer?\u201d She -- you --\nyou didn\u2019t have enough steak, you had to eat chicken?\u201d Because they would not have -\n- and I walked out and I said, \u201cI am not coming here any more.\u201d Now, it didn\u2019t -- not\nso much that this idiot said stop with this crap, with the always -- there were 18\npeople, and nobody said a word. None of them opened their mouth. And after this I\nwrote a letter to the international president, he never answered me, and to the people I\ndidn\u2019t go back. So I -- and those were mostly American who -- I said, you have here\nyour family, your fathers, your mothers, your children are here, your grandchildren are\nhere. Those people didn\u2019t suffer. And [indecipherable] for him, it is enough. We\ntalked about the Holocaust enough. So -- so you ask about friends. I feel comfortable\nwhen I am between somebody -- now, I was very active -- now I\u2019m not so active. We\nhave the Vagra, the Warsaw uprise organization. Every year -- every year we make a\ncommemoration in the -- used to be Madison Square Garden. And I was the chairman\nfrom the arrangement and security. And I was -- I was very much involved, because\nwe had all people survivors. And with survivors I can feel -- today in the morning\nsomebody called me up, a man, and he tells me a story, her survive. He was very\nhappy to talk to me, and I was happy to talk to me, because we went through different\n59February 9, 2001\nways, but we always went through the same. He lost a family, I lost a family. So but --\nbut American Jews, they are s -- now, there are some that they -- like for instance, in\nour Temple, they\u2019re making a commemoration about the Holocaust. Few people come,\nand it\u2019s not -- they didn\u2019t want to go through it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t want to hear it. No, they wanted -- they always thought that I am\nobsessed and they didn\u2019t want to hear it, and they -- they avoided me. They avoided\nme because I spoke about it. They didn\u2019t want to know, and -- and -- and they didn\u2019t\nwant to hear, and I always spoke, and I told them stories. Some people didn\u2019t say\nanything -- I mean, the survivors -- then, because they didn\u2019t want to listen to people.\nThen later, in -- in -- in the 70\u2019s, in the -- with Eichmann\u2019s trial, films came out, then\nthe people started to be a little more interested, and then they learned about it. But in\nthe beginning -- like for instance, my family. They didn\u2019t want to know. They -- now, I\nhave a other -- I had the man that he had the nieces and nephews and he ask me all\nkind of questions, so I ask him, you ask me all kind of questions, but you never ask me\nabout the nieces, about your nephews, about other -- oh yeah, I had in mind to -- to ask\n60February 9, 2001\nyou this. I said, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d They didn\u2019t want to listen, they didn\u2019t want to hear.\nAnd they -- when I tell stories, they said -- they avoided me, because I am obsessed\nwith the Holocaust.",
        "A: Well, the non-Jewish, it was -- no, I was not in contact so, about non-Jews, and I\ndidn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t tell them, but I\u2019m talking about Jewish from organizations when I --\nwe came. Then later, it became our -- I\u2019m starting to be invited and -- to schools, to\npublic schools. Now, for instance, the 27\", what is -- next week. The [indecipherable]\nI have to go to George Washington University, I was there last year, and they invited\nme again, I should come to speak. So I am staying there two days, and -- in\nWashington. Now, a few months ago I was invited to Norfolk, Virginia, to speak\nthere for a Jewish central organizations. Now, I spoke in one school, then later there\nare three schools, so each one invited me to his school. So I was [indecipherable]\ninstead one day, I was there three days. Also they invite me that I should speak\nbecause I don\u2019t take money for it. Like for instance, in same school in Norfolk,\nVirginia, Elie Wiesel was there about two weeks before me, and he took 25,000\ndollars. So -- so I said -- he spoke a half an hour, and I didn\u2019t take anything and I\nspoke three hours. So -- so I told them, there is no business like show business -- not\n61\nFebruary 9, 2001\nshow business -- like -- not show-a -- like Shoah business. You know, Shoah is -- gets\n25,000 dollars. Look, somebody said, he is at the normal price, but still, takes a lot of\nmoney.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, this was in the beginning, and the -- when I spoke about the Holocaust, and\nso then the rabbi said, well the people, they said, we didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know if it\n-- I say -- in the -- so if we didn\u2019t know -- and so I went to the [indecipherable] daily\n[indecipherable] and they had microfilms from -- so I picked out microfilms from the\ntime, from 1942, because there where the mass killings started. And in the microfilms\nI had all articles, every day, this camp and this camp in this town, this\n[indecipherable]. They\u2019re making copies -- I made copies, and I came back to -- to\nthe same synagogue, and I said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Here it is. You knew, but you\ndidn\u2019t read it.\u201d If -- there was an English paper, and if the English paper put it 1n on the\n15\" page, a little this, so -- but in the Jewish paper, it was always written down and --\nand in the -- and you -- you knew it. Now, there 1s also -- there 1s also -- I told them\n62\nFebruary 9, 2001\nthat people were not interested, because in the same paper, it was -- well, 3,000 Jews\nwere killed in this town. In just the next page, it -- it says 3,000 stocks were -- were\nsold yesterday on the stock market. In the same breath, you speak about 3,000 Jews,\nand 3,000 shares of stocks from this company.

        "A: No, e -- e -- well, not that it was differ -- difficult, they didn\u2019t want to believe -- and\nnobody could understand, even til today, how could a thing like this happen. Here,\nwhen -- when you see a -- even now, when you see a disaster in India, it\u2019s a terrible\ndisaster, where 12,000 people, 14,000 were killed. It was a disaster made by God, not\nby people. And here, when you take a town, like my wife\u2019s town, in one day they\nkilled 12,000 people. Killing 12,000 people for -- for no reason at all. And this was in\nevery town, not in one town. How can a human mind comprehend this? Now, a -- a --\nit\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a -- I don\u2019t know if sa -- you heard about it, there\u2019s a Dr. Gross, you know,\na gt -- he\u2019s a professor in -- in New York, NYU. He\u2019s a very good friend, because he\nedited one of my books. So this Dr. Gross, he\u2019s from Poland, his father was a judge in\nKrakow, a Jew, and he married a non-Jew, a Polish, and she helped him to survive.\nHe was born after the war, he started in Warsaw. Now he came here, he\u2019s here. Now,\n63February 9, 2001\nhe made the study -- he made the study about -- about killing of -- so there is a town,\nJedwabne, a small town near Warsaw. In Jedwabne were 18,000 Jews -- no, a\nthousand eight hun -- 1800 Jews. In Jedwabne in one day, all the Jews were pushed in\nin a barn, and they were all burned to death in one day. Now, peppel -- people knew\nthat this was in the time of the Germans, that the -- that the Germans -- that the\nGermans did it, right? So -- but this was -- he went, and he -- he -- he had some\ninclinations that it wasn\u2019t done by the Germans, so he went to Jedwabne, he found\nthere witnesses, Polish witnesses. Then he found out that two Jews from Jedwabne\nsurvived there in Israel, he went to Israel and he wrote the book, I have the book, and\nhe -- the book is called -- just came out, it\u2019s called , \u201cSasiedzi\u201d in Polish. \u201cSasiedzi\u201d\nmeans Neighbors. And he describes that the 1800 people were killed by Poles. The\nPole -- the Germans were there, they were standing there, they saw it, but they didn\u2019t\ninterfere because they were very happy somebody else is doing it. So the Polish people\nkilled all the Jews from their town where they lived together three, four hundred years.\nAnd they burned -- they pushed them in, and then he described the owner of the barn,\nand the owner of the barn said he didn\u2019t want to do it, that they forced him. Some were\nlater arrested. They pushed them in, they poured gasoline and they burned all alike.\nNow if you -- in -- in the -- in the book is so -- now, wh-wh-what he describes, that\nbefore they pushed in, there was a child. The Poles were standing with knives and they\n64\nFebruary 9, 2001\ntook out the eyes from the children, and they threw in the children. Now, they knew\nthat they will be killed. Why did they have to do it in the -- it\u2019s such bestiality, such\nterrible thing. Now, the book just came out, so I told him the book has -- I want to\ntranslate it. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s being now translated into English, and into Hebrew.\u201d So it\nwill come out maybe 1n a month or two months. But the English version came out last\nmonth.",
        "A: I wanted to have -- when we got -- when we got together in Poland, we didn\u2019t want\nto have children. Course we beli -- we spoke about it, and we decided we don\u2019t want to\nbring in children to such a world because we wouldn\u2019t know what happened in -- and\nlike my sisters, all the children, they were killed, so why should we bring in children\ninto world? And then in -- so we didn\u2019t want. Then later when we came to America,\nso we figured we are now in America, it\u2019s a different country and everything, we want\nto have children. So it took us 11 years, we -- we didn\u2019t have a child. After 11 years\nwe ha -- we wanted to adopt, but I didn\u2019t want to adopt on the black market. So we\nwent to a doctor, and the doctor to see if there\u2019s something wrong with me, or with my\nwife, and the doctors, well they said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you two. So we don\u2019t\nhave the children. So we want to ad -- adopt not with black markets and we went to a\nlegitimate Steven Bryce adoption. And we want to adopt, we made the application, it\n65\nFebruary 9, 2001\ntook about a year, and they gave a case wer -- a worker, and she was very nice, and --\nand she told us that they will approve it. And one day, which was before\nThanksgiving, she come to our house, and this time we lived in Brooklyn, she saw the\napartment, and we showed her we have one room reserved, and we going to put it for a\n-- for a child. And she and I made already in this time a good living. My wife was a\nteacher, and I had a good business already. I still was a peddler. And she said, \u201cI think\nyou will have a very good Thanksgiving,\u201d because they were ready to give us a child.\nAnd we says, \u201cWell, we prefer if we can get a girl.\u201d We wanted to have a girl. And\nthen, befo -- before about two months and before she said that probably we\u2019 ll have it,\nsh -- they switched her and we got the other worker. And the first minute when she\ncame to house, we saw right away that she\u2019s not the same person. She looked at my\nwife and she was -- we saw that she is very jealous. And the way she talked to my\nwife, and my wife was maybe prettier, we had a nice apartment. And -- and she was\nnot so nice as the other one to us. And then later we got a letter that we were rejected.\nIt was a very terrible shock to us. And the reason why we\u2019re rejected is because they\ndon\u2019t -- they -- they don\u2019t believe that we, after going through so much, that we are\nnormal people, that we will be able to bring up a child like in a normal home. And this\nwas the terrible thing. I had people who wrote letters, people who I helped very much -\n- like, for instance, there was a Dr. Rosenhow, he was one of the biggest professors in\n66February 9, 2001\nthe world, and I did a lot of things for him. He was in this time a professor in\nColumbia, he was a very -- a international known eye doctor. So I told him this, so he\nwrote a letter, and some other [indecipherable] what I did to him -- for him. And --\nand there was other men, but then they said once it\u2019s rejected, nobody can correct it.\nBut nothing wrong with us, the only thing that they don\u2019t think that we will be able to\nbring up a child. If -- well, anyway. So then I said I have no -- I have no choice, so we\nfind somebody that we can get a child on the black market, and we got in touch with a\nwoman from Philadelphia, and in this time she said for 8,000 dollars we can get a\nchild. And so we agreed, and I gave no money in advance. She said the minute when\nthey was here -- we told her we want to have a newborn child, and if -- a -- a girl, and\nif she will have it, I will come and pick it up and gi-give her the money.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\n67February 9, 2001\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: -- well, anyway. So then I said I have no -- I have no choice, so we find somebody\nthat we can get a child on the black market, and we got in touch with a woman from\nPhiladelphia, and in this time she said for 8,000 dollars we can get a child. And so we\nagreed, and I gave no money in advance. She said the minute when they was here --\nwe told her we want to have a newborn child, and if -- a -- a girl, and if she will have\nit, I will come and pick it up and gi-give her the money. We received a letter -- a -- a\ntelephone from her, so she said, \u201cCome to Philadelphia, a child was born today, in\nthree days come, you can pick up the child.\u201d When I got the cel -- telephone, about\nfour days before, my wife went to the doctor, and he made a rabbit test, and he says\nthat she is pregnant -- well, a few days before. Naturally we told her that we change\nour mind, and Esther was born. Then after -- after this she was pregnant about three\ntimes, she had miscarriages. Cause I wanted to have a large family, cause we were\nnine children. So she -- so that we were thinking about adoption, then later we decided\nno, because if we have one our daughter, we\u2019d -- we didn\u2019t think that we will have the\nsame feeling for some -- for adopted child. If we wouldn\u2019t have our own, so maybe we\ncould adopt two. But once we have our own, so we thought we will deprive Esther. So\nshe was -- a few times she had miscarriages, and this 1s it.\n68\nFebruary 9, 2001\n69\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwith God. I mean, he was a religious man. Jesus was a Nazere, a naze -- I don\u2019t know\nif you know what means a Nazere. A Nazere means that he didn\u2019t want to have too\nmuch pleasure from a life on this world. Like -- like he -- he never cut his hair, he\nnever drink whiskey, he never had a woman. Well, those were as people, and Jesus\nwas one of these. You -- you cut it off?",
        "A: Now I -- I don\u2019t know if I told you last time I had a grandfather. My grandfather\nwas a very, very pious Jew, he was a very learned Jew, he was very well known that\nhe was one of the biggest scholars. In 1875 he wrote a book, and the book was in -- in\n-- Jesus in -- [indecipherable] means Jesus from Nazareth. He wrote it in Hebrew,\nand this book was never published. And I remember we had one manuscript home,\nwritten by hand, beautiful written. I would give everything if I would have to take that\nbook, but the book got lost. And he wrote it in -- in this time, a Jew to write about\nJesus, it was sacrilegious because the Jew -- the Jews even didn\u2019t want to mention\nJesus\u2019s name. So he wrote about him, and he -- this what he explained. He explains\nthat Jesus was born, and he was -- he had a very, very hard childhood because all his\nfriends they used to call him names because he was born out of wedlock. So they used\nto call him -- in Hebrew is mumser. Mumser means somebody who was born in --\nwithout a father. So a -- he was very bitter because he knew that he was born -- his\n70\nFebruary 9, 2001\nmother was not married to je -- to Joseph in this time. But as a human being, he was a\nwonderful human being. He was very compassionate, as -- but so f -- and he was very\nreligious. So to me that the Jews -- this what I try to -- what the Jews gave to -- to the\nworld, now take in -- in our time, the biggest doctors, the biggest thinkers, the biggest\nmusicians, everything is Jewish, I am very proud of it. \u2019'm very proud of our heritage\nduring all the time of the religion and their history. But I stop a little when it comes to\nGod, I stop because I have questions, and I don\u2019t know if I believe in God, if I don\u2019t\nbelieve in God. I don\u2019t want to think about it, but if I believe, I\u2019m very angry at Him.\nBecause if -- like they say, if He rolled -- runs the world, and if He rules everything,\nhow -- where was He when they pushed in 4,000 people in a cha -- in a gas chamber in\nAuschwitz, and the -- the crying and everything, He didn\u2019t hear it. If He didn\u2019t hear it,\nand He didn\u2019t help, so probably He couldn\u2019t help. And if He couldn\u2019t help, well who --\nwho needs Him? So the -- but I -- but this isn\u2019t -- but Esther is more religious that we\nare, because she doesn\u2019t have this experience. She doesn\u2019t ask God why didn\u2019t He do\nthis, why didn\u2019t He this, why didn\u2019t He help my mother. So she is more religious, not\nthe way religious she wi -- not to eat pork, she will eat pork. Not to drive on Saturday,\nshe will drive Saturday. But, as a Jew, she is religious and I told her if she will have\nchildren, if the children will go to a religious school I pay for it, and I do. For all the\n71February 9, 2001\nthree children, they go to Saloman Schachter, I pay for it. So Iam very, very proud\nwhat the Jews accomplished.",
        "A: I spoke to her about the Holocaust, but I -- I think -- this what my wife\u2019s opinion 1s,\nthat I -- I spoiled a lot, because I started to talk to her too early. I started to speak to her\nwhen she was small, and then she was so fed up that she tried to push it away. Even til\ntoday, there are organizations from second generations and this, and we told her to\njoin, to be active, she is not. And this what she said, because she was exposed too early\nto it. And then later, she tried to push it away. But I -- she knows it from since she was\nfour or five years. And then later when I did with the grandchildren, she told me the\nsame thing, not to try to spoil it, and not to try to influence and talk so much about it\nwhen they are too small.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t, not the bedtime stories. But I told her that -- that I may -- about the\nfive sisters I had, and about the children. Now there 1s -- there 1s -- in the sign -- the\nnew book I\u2019m writing, there\u2019s some stories comparing Esther with the -- with my\nsister -- sister\u2019s children. See, my sister\u2019s children I love so much that -- like they\nwould be my children because we lived together. We lived together, we always -- we -\n72\nFebruary 9, 2001\n- especially in the ghetto we were together. And the children [indecipherable] and\nthey looked up to me. If I went out from the ghetto I took off my band there, and they\nlooked up to me, and I always brought them one, when they didn\u2019t have no -- an apple,\nthey didn\u2019t [indecipherable] or a plum or something when I came from a trip, or\nsomething, I smuggled it in and I gave it to them, so they waited for it. And -- and I\nwas an -- the hero for them. Naturally in this time I was not in the underground, but\nstill, I was the one that I -- that I brought them something, candy, a piece of chocolate,\nin the ghetto. But later, naturally, they were -- and they were very young, like -- like\none sister I had a girl come three and a half years and got killed, and one was two\nyears. One -- the other sister had a boy three and a half years and the other was two\nyears. And then I had a niece, and the niece was three years younger than I. And my\nbrother had the three children. One was 12, one was 10 and the girl was eight when\nthey were killed. But I was very, very attached to the children, and -- and now it\u2019s\nthinking back it\u2019s like -- like I almost -- we all were very attached, the whole family,\nbecause we lived together and my father -- if I had a sister got married, he didn\u2019t let\nthem move away from our town, they stayed in our town, he opened a business for the\nnew son-in-law. Each daughter got -- he bought them -- he gave them a dowry, and\nthen later he bought them a house. He was well off, he could do it. But we were like --\n73\nFebruary 9, 2001\nlike -- even when they married, the -- there was no difference, they were like they\nwould be home.",
        "A: She oh -- [tape break]",
        "A: Yeah, when she was small she was very unhappy because she always ask question,\nhow come all her friends have grandparents, have aunts, and she doesn\u2019t have. And\ncame Sunday they came to visit. So as a matter of fact, she had a friend across the\nstreet, and -- and they -- she had two sets of grandparents. So she ask how come she\nhas two er -- sets, and I don\u2019t have even one? So naturally we told her that they were\nkilled, and where are they, they are in heaven. So then later she made up with this\nfriend that she said she should give her one set of grandparent. So they said yes, we\nadopt you. And every time when they came over here, so she went to visit them, and --\nand -- and she se -- but she knew that it is not grandparents, but she knew -- and they\nsaid we -- we will be your grandparents, and -- because Ellen has two sets, so you will\nhave one. But she always was very unhappy that she doesn\u2019t have grandparents. Then\nlater she got older, so she realized then -- then -- in the beginning, when then en -- she\nwas very small, so we told her where are they. So we said they were killed, bad men\n74\nFebruary 9, 2001\ncame and killed them. And -- and -- but then later, naturally, when I told her about the\n-- about the war, so maybe I told her too earlier, and she was like pushed away because\nshe le -- realized it when she was four or five, six years. It was a little too early.",
        "A: No, no, they -- I didn\u2019t say that they liked me, beca --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, well, no, because you see, in America the money talks. So they di -- I don\u2019t\nthink so they liked me more, maybe some hated me more, because they were jealous.\nSo they -- because -- and I give you other example, I had an uncle and his son went\nhere to college, and he hardly made a living. So they came to -- when I moved in in the\nnew apartment, and -- and I had new -- right away new furniture, so I told him, well,\nwe try to fix it up, but we not finished yet. I purposely said it. So she -- so I see she\njumped in there to her husband, she says, \u201cSee, see? And my son went to college and\nlook at him. He just came over here, he has already a beautiful apartment, he has a\n75\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbusiness, and he is already fixed up.\u201d Now, they were very, very, very jealous, but\nthey said when they spoke to somebody else, and they said, \u201cOh Norman is doing all\nright.\u201d So they always said, \u201cOh yeah, we put him on his feet.\u201d Which they didn\u2019t do\nanything. And there are occasions that -- that -- what they did. Like for instance, I had\none cousin, and they -- he inherited from his father, he had a very big factory, and they\nmade all kind of children\u2019s underwear. So -- and I -- I was in this time in the remnant\nbusiness, so -- and he had s -- in the factory he sold remnants, so I went to him and I\nsaid to him, I buy remnants. Now h -- and he sold it to a dealer, so he probably charge\n50 cents a pound, and later I bought it and I paid four dollars a pound. So I said why\ncan\u2019t I buy direct? And he was a cousin, so he said, \u201cWell, I would sell it to you, but\nyou have to bring me a statement from the bank. See, we do only business with\nsomebody who could send me a financial statement. If you bring me the bank, that you\nhave in the bank 25,000 dollars, and [indecipherable] we will do business.\u201d So I said,\n\u201cT don\u2019t have 25,000 dollars.\u201d So I had to buy his remnants and pay instead a half a\ndollar, I had to pay four dollars. And I made a very small profit, which I could make a\nlot of profit. All right. Then about 10 years later, when I was already selling furniture,\nI established myself, so this man opened a lot of -- a few discount houses. So once I\nwent in and I said to him, \u201cYou know, in this discount house you don\u2019t have furniture.\nI\u2019m -- I sell furni -- why don\u2019t you give me a call and then I\u2019Il bring in kitchen sets and\n76\nFebruary 9, 2001\nother things, we can make a lot of money, you will be a partner.\u201d So -- and I will have\n-- and I could make a big business. So he said, \u201cYeah, well it\u2019s a very good idea, but\nyou have to bring me that you have in the bank at least hundred thousand dollars,\notherwise how could we do business with you?\u201d So I said to him, \u201cYou know what? In\nfive years I will come back to you, because this way I will make money. The first time\nyou wanted 20, I didn\u2019t have it. So now I have 20, you wanted hundred, I don\u2019t have it.\nMaybe in five years we come -- I will come to you, you\u2019ll ask for a half a million\ndollars, but I already will have the hundred thousand dollars. So I will keep coming to\nyou and I will raise my capital.\u2019\u2019 Naturally, he never let me have the furniture, and I\nnever did it, and -- and it\u2019s -- and this -- this how it was.

        "A: Well, the achievements in this country, the first thing is that I had a daughter. This\nis the main -- th-this is the highlife -- the highlight, because wouldn\u2019t I have a\ndaughter, my life wouldn\u2019t be worth anything, because why did I survive? To have a\ncontinuation. The Jews lived for so many years, and I had to have a continuation. Now\n78\nFebruary 9, 2001\nshe -- I have a daughter, she has three grandsons. So it means that Hitler didn\u2019t win\nthe war. With me he didn\u2019t win the war, because his -- to win the war, it means to an --\nan -- to destroy every single Jew, and with me he couldn\u2019t do it. Now, we had a town\nvery few -- only -- only four people survived ous -- from my town. Now all the people\nwhen I look back -- when I look back and I -- there were families, the families\nstretched 300 years, nobody survived. And then when they killed the last one -- so it\nmeans they just destroyed everything. And with me, I didn\u2019t. My father had me, and I\nhave Esther, Esther has the children, and the generation goes on. I -- I\u2019m very -- a\nlittle disappointed in -- not disappointed, I feel bad that I don\u2019t have a son, and the\nreason why, because by Jews, there is a sect, and we call it kohanim. The kohanim\ndescend from the priestly family. Now this started, the first Cohen was Aaron -- a\nCohen, Moses\u2019 brother. This is a -- 4,000 years. And a son came after the father, after\nthe father, and it was never change, because the Jews how -- not religious -- I mean,\nthey were not religious, but this they obeyed, that a son should be a Cohen after a\nfather. Now this went on for 4,000 years til 1t came to me. Now, I don\u2019t know how\nmany forefathers were killed because they were Jews, probably a lot. My father was\nkilled because I -- because he was a Jew. But I remained, and I took his place. Who\nknows, maybe his forefathers were killed by the Crusaders in the [indecipherable].\nWe don\u2019t know. So because it lasted for so -- for 4,000 years, and it never -- the string,\n79\nFebruary 9, 2001\nthe lineage was never cut off. And so not being a Cohen 1s cut off by me, because a\ndaughter is not -- she herself is a Cohen, a daughter of a Cohen, but her children are\nnot any more. So this I am a little disappointed, because I would like this lineage\nshould be long, and it should be til the end of time. But it isn\u2019t, but Iam happy. And\nthey are -- they are the three boys, and -- and they should know that they are very\nproud to be Jews. And if -- if -- if one of them would marry out of religion, this will be\nthe worst thing for me, I don\u2019t know if I could survive it. Not because era -- oh -- I bel\n-- I told you this before, not because about not being religious, but not being a Jew,\nbecause there was a man, there was a nation, they want a -- nea -- hel -- a -- destroy all\nthe Jews, and I said no, I want to be alive. And through me -- not only me, and others,\nsaid we are going around, we going a -- we are here, we establish a country, we in -- in\nAmerica. We are Jews, and we did so much for -- for the world, that I want the\ncontinuation should be.",
        "A: Well, this 1s a achievement about having a family. So now, also achievement is that\nI will leave a few books.

And if -- if -- if I\nget from wha -- book, I get some royalties or something, I send it to the mu -- to the\n80\nFebruary 9, 2001\nmuseum right away, because I don\u2019t need it, I may -- I have enough.

And also that I am [indecipherable] my wife, and -- and my wife is --\nI think we are -- we ra -- we are in love, e -- even we have frictions [indecipherable]\nand -- and the frictions are because she doesn\u2019t tie down the toothpaste like I want it\nshould be down because it\u2019s loose. So we -- we have those kind of arguments. Not\nbecause it\u2019s important things, but small thing [indecipherable] like -- like she likes, in\nwinter for instance, I have a busy day because the whole day she opens the window\nand I close the window. She wants a [indecipherable] minute I come in, I go out, the\nwindow\u2019s open. I close it. So those are -- those are the -- the -- the frictions. But as a\nwhole, I think we agree on everything. We agree with the -- with the -- with the\ngrandchildren. We agree with our daughter, with -- mostly only small things that\n81\nFebruary 9, 2001\notherwise -- and -- and this -- this 1s a achievement, the achievement is that I am alive,\nthat our generation, our heritage is alive, and I am giving -- I prepare a lot of things,\nthe only worry I have is that they will not continue, or they will destroy it. Now, for\ninstance, I told you before about the stamps. I collected the stamps over 50 years, and I\nhave the most beautiful collection. I don\u2019t want to sell it, I don\u2019t want to give it to a\nmuseum. I want my grandchildren should have it, because it is -- the stamps gave me a\nlot of pleasure. I collected it, and it\u2019s worth a lot of money if I sell 1t, and now I get\nnothing, practically for it. As a matter of fact, I told you before, I bought today two\nalbums. I said million times I wouldn\u2019t buy any more, but it comes out something, I\nbuy it. So this is a -- this 1s a very -- a very -- a pleasant thing, and -- and I -- I belong\nto a lot of organizations. Now I started to give up because a lot of times in the evening\nthere are meetings in New York, and -- and I don\u2019t go. Even if I want to go, my wife\ndoesn\u2019t let me go. So this is very rewarding, that I am getting acknowledged, I\u2019m\ngetting plaques, I\u2019m invited to speak. And life goes on. This what is inside me, nobody\nknows, because every night -- there 1s not a night that I shouldn\u2019t thi -- see, I am -- I\nam the United States almost 50 years. 50, or more? \u201947? More than 50, yeah. I never\ndreamt about the United States. Now, I went through, I have my life here and family.\nYou always dream from your life. I never had that dream about the United States. It\ndoesn\u2019t mean that United States was bad for me, in the contrary. United States was\n82February 9, 2001\nvery good for me. Always when I have a dream, it\u2019s always a dream from home,\nbefore the war. Dream from the Holocaust, and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and I\nnever -- I never -- and I\u2019m thinking about life here. I never dreamt about it. Maybe this\nis the way it should be, that you don\u2019t dream from -- from good things where you are\nalive here, but you dream from before. So th-th-the -- I live with the past, and this is\nvery -- it\u2019s not good, but I live with the past in, all right, luckily my wife is also a\nsurvivor. Would I have an American survivor, probably we couldn\u2019t live together -- I\nmean, with American person, because I don\u2019t think so that somebody would take it.\nBut with her, she has the same problem as I, when she dreams, she dreams also about\nher family, about her ho -- about her youth. And -- and this how we going on. I -- I -- I\nam very much interested like I told you in the Temple, I\u2019m not religious, but when it\ncomes to the high holidays, I perform, and I -- I conduct services, I\u2019m singing with the\nchoir, I teach them. Because this is something that it\u2019s in me, it\u2019s a heritage, and I\ndon\u2019t want to let it go.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, okay.\n83\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: W-Well, to be in America is -- when I came over here, I was very unhappy. And I\nwas unhappy for a few reasons. I will give you an -- an article that it was just\npublished. The first thing, I was very unhappy, I came to a country -- see aft -- would I\ncome straight from a concentration camp, I would be very happy because I would have\nto eat, I wouldn\u2019t be chased. But I already went through a period after the liberation, til\nI escaped, I became already -- I had a chauffeur, my wife had a cook, and I have a\nbodyguard, and I was em -- a-and I was admired, and I had a position, I don\u2019t -- so\nthen, after this, when you came down, it -- and I fell down so drastically to America\nthat I was nothing. What do you mean nothing? I di -- we didn\u2019t know the language, I\ndidn\u2019t know the people, I didn\u2019t have a trade, I didn\u2019t have a job. And -- and it was not\nso -- this that you became -- you became worthless. So in this time, for this reason, I\nwanted to go also to Israel, but I figure Israel it will be -- a -- its -- was a dream, yeah.\nAnd -- and -- and in this time I con -- considered to -- to commit suicide a few times,\nbecause I figured what -- why did I survive? What was -- well, then later I started to\nmake out all right, and -- and -- and I started to belong to organizations and I saw that\nAmerica is giving me more than I ever dreamt, because I was not ex -- am -- nobody\n84February 9, 2001\ncalled me Jew, no -- I was not beaten up, and I could do anything I wanted. So I saw\nthat America is -- and also, e -- I was -- I worked very hard, and I co -- saw -- then I\nbought a house and I could buy a car, and -- and all those things, so til Esther was\nborn I was satisfied, but it was missing a child. Now, when Esther was born, so I think\neverything was completed.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: -- with regrets what I didn\u2019t do, before -- I told you before the regrets. So you\ncouldn\u2019t go back, you couldn\u2019t turn back the clock, but I was very happy. So America\nmeant a awful lot t-to me. I just wrote an article, I will give it to you, and I called it\n\u201cMy Three Homelands.\u201d And I describe the three homelands, Poland, amer --",
        "A: No --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, \u201cMy Three Homelands,\u201d and I describe it that three homelands, Poland, for\ninstance. Poland was like a stepmother, and I loved Poland and I wanted to be a\npatriot, but Poland didn\u2019t let me love it. I wouldn\u2019t -- I wanted to go to the army, and I\n85\nFebruary 9, 2001\n-- I couldn\u2019t -- this before the war. And -- and -- because I thought we live in p -- in\nPoland -- Jews lived for thousand years, my family lived for 300 years, and I thought\nfor 300 years we could become citizens, but we didn\u2019t. So then I describe -- I will give\nyou this article -- then I describe my second homeland is America. America took me\nin, and nourished me, brought me back to health, and America did everything to -- for\nme that I never dreamt that America would do it for me, so I love America, but my\nthird homeland is Israel. It\u2019s that my soul is in Israel. Even if I live in America it\ndoesn\u2019t mean -- I love America, but Israel is my -- my real home, it\u2019s that -- now,\nwhen I was the first time in Israel, so we had an organization, and after the trip they\nask me -- and I spoke about it, and so they ask me who do you have in Israel, why do\nyou -- and I was so happy to be there, even if I had there a brother. So I said, \u201cWell, I\nhad an awful lot of friends in Israel and I met all my friends. And I was -- I went\nhome.\u201d Who are the friends? So I told them my friends was the Rumbaum.\nRumbaum is -- is a scholar from the Middle Ages, who is buried in the Tiberias.\nMaria Balanessa, a other sage, who 1s buried in -- in -- in -- in -- in Tiberias. There --\nthe founder of Kabbalah, of mystic, was buried in Meron, and so on and so on. Those\nare my best friends. I lived -- I was brought up with them. Then, the new generations\nthat are my friends is Theodor Her -- Herzl, the founder of Zionism, and\n[indecipherable] who was a soldier and officer who was killed in Israel in --in the\n86\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbeginning. So you see, those people were my friends, and I went to visit th -- with\nthem, because I lived with them. And then we had the patriarchs, in -- in -- Abraham,\nand a -- naturally they were not alive, but I went to them. And then I had my adopted\nmother. My adopted mother was Rachel in Bethlehem. Every Jew knows that Rachel\nwas the adopted mother. So I went to there -- to them, and I spoke to them, and this\nwas my highlight for it -- so for this reason my soul is in Israel, my reality, my natural\nlife is in America. And my dream was in Poland, but it was never continued because\nthe Polish people didn\u2019t let me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So about -- th-thas -- I ge -- I --",
        "A: Well, I -- I have to give you -- I have to -- well, this -- this how it 1s.",
        "A: You see -- you see, I\u2019m --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you see -- you see America -- America naturally I have a lot of\ncomplaints to America, but we are allowed to have complaints, where I can speak up.\nI remember when I came to America, I was very unhappy I told you, because I didn\u2019t\nmake a living, and I wanted to commit suicide. Then later when I started to make a\nliving, and when I went to Florida, and I -- and this I will never forget, and my wife\n87\nFebruary 9, 2001\nwent to Miami to buy a pair of shoes, and we go in -- we went 1n in a store and I\nwanted to go to the bathroom and I see it\u2019s written for whites and blacks. I wanted to\ndrin -- I couldn\u2019t believe it, I couldn\u2019t understand that in America, so I went back and\nthere was a full -- the store was full with people, and I started to yell, again I talk a lot,\nso I started yell don\u2019t buy here shoes, I wouldn\u2019t let you buy shoes. And she asked me\nwhy. I said go and you will see. There are two fountains, two toilets, what do you\nmean this is for white and blacks? You cannot -- you cannot buy here. And I pulled her\nout and she didn\u2019t buy the shoes, because for me it was something new. On the way\nhome we stopped, I th-think, in North Carolina, something like that, and we went in a\nrestaurant and with us was there a girl, she was from -- a Jewish girl from Yemen, she\nwas dark. We were sitting by the table and we -- we ordered some food. So I made a\njoke, I made a joke and I said I hope they will not see -- recognize you who you are,\nbecause -- made believe that she is black, you know? And the waitress heard it and\ntwo minutes later, the -- a manager came and th-th-th -- he said you wa -- and they\nwere -- they threw us out from the restaurant because we were with this girl. And she\nwas Jewish. So when they threw us out, I didn\u2019t want to go, then they called the police\nand we went out, and there were two police motorcycles. And they ask where is your -\n- where is your cars, I told them. They said, you leave the town, we will escort you,\nand if you don\u2019t go right away, we\u2019ll arrest you.\n88\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: This was in 19 -- in 1949. 19 four -- \u201949 or \u201950, yeah, \u201949. So they went behind us,\nwe were out -- ou-out from the town, so they turned back. And I described this in one\nof the vignettes. And this was a terrible thing for me. I couldn\u2019t understand how come\nthat -- that -- that here in -- in America that I admire so much, and -- and there are\npeople -- see, in this time, for me, the-the-the-the -- when they -- we called them\nNegroes in this time, that they suffered and I could see them as I was a second class\ncitizen in Europe. So this was very, very, very -- it -- it was terrible for me. I -- I -- I\nremember I had later, and thi -- I had later in -- in Hoboken houses, so I had houses\nand there one -- one house -- you see, all those stories I have written down that will be\nin my -- in the book. Yeah, so there was one man, he was the president from the\nNAACP in -- in -- in Hoboken, he didn\u2019t pay me rent, I went for the rent, we had an\nargument, he beat me up. And -- and -- and I went -- I want to go to police. So then I\nwas in this time chairman from the ADL, from, you know, Anti-Defamation League\nfrom B\u2019nai Brith. So I told the stories, I said I want to make a case out of it because\nthe ADL and the Jews they emancipated, 1n this time the blacks, they gave them\nlawyers to be -- they marched. So they made -- they made a complaint and I was called\nto -- to the headquarters from -- in New York from the NAACP. So we were called to\nlisten to the story and they called the man who was the president from their\n89\nFebruary 9, 2001\norganization in Hoboken. So th-the story was that he took -- so I told them, he beat me\nup, I came for the rent. So he said, \u201cYes, I beat him up,\u201d he was a big, husky guy,\n\u201cbecause he came in and h,\u201d -- and I told him, \u201cyou effing nigger, give me the money.\u201d\nThis -- this what he told them, for this reason he beat me up. So I ask them, can -- can I\nask him a few questions? Yeah, yes. I said, What kind of a house was it? Eight family\nhouse. Who lived in the house? All eight were blacks. Wer -- what floor were you\nliving? He say, on the top floor. What time of the day was it that I called you this\nname? It was eight, nine o\u2019clock at night. No white people and I was there with my\nmechanic because we had to fix something. So I -- I -- I ask him those things, so I said\nto the people, I said, \u201cNow, do you think that if I will come to his house, it\u2019s a eight\nfamily house, all are blacks, he lives on the top floor, nine o\u2019clock at night, and I came\nin and I will tell him this what he said, and I will be alive, I will be here, huh?\u201d So they\nasked then the -- my mechanic, he was Ukrainian, and he said, \u201cI just came in to fix\nsomething.\u201d So they thought that he is lying, so on the spot -- on the spot they said you\ndon\u2019t belong to the organization any more, you\u2019re not a president and you -- we don\u2019t\nbelieve you. And I -- so I was very, very pleased with their decision. And they were\nmostly -- they were about half Jewish lawyers and half were blacks, because Jews\ngave them lawyers. So you see, there was a lot of -- of things in America that I disap -\n- disapproved, and -- and I liked. Like I disapproved what they did for black people,\n90\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbecause I couldn\u2019t believe that there should be a discrimination; after all, we are in\nAmerica. The same thing I didn\u2019t want to be discriminated as a Jew. Well, those are\nthe things that I have everything in the -- in the -- in the book, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. The world has learned that our environment --\nwhen -- when people who are involved learn a -- Jews learned a lot, not so much about\nthe Holocaust. Let\u2019s say -- let\u2019s talk about Jews in America. The Jews in America are\na little different now to what\u2019s Israel. They are closer to the Israel -- to Israel on\naccount of the Holocaust, because they know that we -- would we have Israel before\nthe war, probably more than half of Jews will be alive, because they will run out and\nthey will have a place where to go. They didn\u2019t know where to go. So now, this is like\na insurance policy. A lot of Jews -- well, the young Jews I don\u2019t think so, because they\nthink we are in America, America is mine. We have America in our pocket. And it\u2019s\nnot true. So -- but the other people, the elderly people, they figure well, this a\ninsurance policy that in case something happens we have where to go. So the whole\nworld didn\u2019t learn anything, because as you can see, we have now not on the -- on the\nSo -- so strong as the Holocaust, we had Rwanda, we had Bosnia, we had Cambodia.\nSo there are a lot of places that 1t was repeated. It was not so repeated like the\nHolocaust, like I said to you before. Why? Because it\u2019s not done by the Germans.\n91\nFebruary 9, 2001\nWould the Germans be in those places, it will be done completely. But those people\nwere not capable to make it so complete as the Germans, because everything what the\nGermans did, it had to be perfect. So they did perfect with the Holocaust also. So -- but\nthey didn\u2019t learn in case something happened it will be the same thing. Now, America\nfor instance, there are so many nationalities, but we know the time for McCarthy, I\ndon\u2019t know if you remember this, it was almost. But, there were courageous people\nwho stood up, and they started to bring this in the -- t-to the world and they -- and he\nwas thrown out. But as -- y-y -- also because it was good times. God forbid if there\nwill be bad times. They will look for a scapegoat. They will look for a scapeg -- and\nhere in America, the first scapegoat will be the black. We have somebody who is\nbehind us. And the next scapegoat will be a Jew. There is even a story that a Jew --\nsomebody said to a Jew that all -- all the disasters are on account of the Jews.\nEverything, all troubles are the Jews. So -- so then he said, well give me one example.\nSo he said, take the Titanic. The Titanic si -- under the Jews. So he said what you\nbring the Jews, what have to do ya-ya? He said, well the -- the -- the Titanic was\ndestroyed by a iceberg. So he said, this what I mean, iceberg, Greenberg, Goldberg,\nthey are all the same. So this 1s -- this is -- the man said it and he believed it. And there\nis -- and then a other man said about the -- about the Holocaust that all the trouble in\nthe world, all the trouble in the world are on account of the Jews, and account of\n92\nFebruary 9, 2001\nbicycle riders. Every trouble what\u2019s on the world are -- is guilty the Jew, or the bicycle\nriders. And people, when you tell it to them, they look at you and they ask, why\nbicycle riders? What have bicycle riders to do with the destructions with this?\nNobody\u2019d ask why the Jews. Nobody said what do have the Jew -- in the country, if\nthere is a disaster, the first scapegoat is the Jew. So nobody -- when you tell the story,\nand I tell the story to a lot of people, nobody ask yet, why the Jew. But everybody ask,\nwhy the bicycle rider? So there you have the answer, and if you ask -- if it co -- 1f the\nworld learned a lesson, the world didn\u2019t learn no lesson. The Jews learned a lesson.\nThe Jews who survived learned a lesson. I don\u2019t think that the Jews in America\nlearned a lesson. There are some Jews who th -- know there was a Holocaust. But the\nmajority Jew, what, they go to W-Wall Street, making money, coming home, going --\ngoing to -- to a nightclub, going to the movie. Do they think about the Holocaust? No.\nThe Holocaust was done for somebody else, and it was done in a other\u2019s time, and it is\nnot for them.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, sa -- okay --",
        "A: -- okay, yeah.\n93\nFebruary 9, 2001",
        "A: Well, 1-1n this -- well, I told you, I\u2019m not talking now about personal things,\nbecause naturally personal things I improved.",
        "A: I improve them materially, and all those things, but it -- it-- there were things that --\nthat is -- well, like for instance, take now. Take now, I am very much -- I\u2019m very much\ndisappointed in the results of the elections. This is just happened yesterday. Now why\nam I memb -- why am disappointed? Because I know in America, in such a\ndemocratic country, and I know that the elections were st-stolen, and -- and it\u2019s not\nstolen, I -- there -- some lawyer was on television, he said it was not stolen, it was\nrobbed. And it was robbed because we know -- now, if you go to a bank, and you give\nthem a hundred dollar bill, and you said cha -- exchange it to me for wo -- single ca --\nsingle bills for hundred. And you go away from the ta -- from the window and you\nstart to count, and you see it\u2019s only 65 dollars instead hundred. You will go back and I\nsay, you know you cheated me, you gave me 65. So what will he say? He said let me\ncount it over. And he will count over, he said, he\u2019s right. He will give him extra 35\ndollars. Now here, if it was wrong, if -- 1f 1t was right -- so why do they have to be\n94\nFebruary 9, 2001\nafraid it will be counted over? If it\u2019s right, so he\u2019s right. But they didn\u2019t count it over\nbecause they knew it was wrong. So this I am very much hurt. Forget about the\ndemocrats or republicans. If it will be the opposite, I will be hurt the same way. So a\nthing like this, I am very, very much disappointed. Disappointed because I love\nAmerica, I love American democrats e-even if it\u2019s not hundred percent, but at least we\ncan speak about it. In this, you cannot even speak. And then later the -- the -- the ca --\nthe Supreme Court in Washington, they make the decision. The Supreme Court has --\n1-1s not created to make a decision about elections. The Supreme Court is made for --\nto make decisions about something else. You see, be-because you ask me, those are\nthe things that just happened yesterday. So a thing like this, I am disappointed because\nI feel America is mine. It\u2019s not a thing that I am living in a strange country, is a -- ina\nforeign country like I lived in Poland. In Poland everything they did, I had to take it\nfor granted, this is the way it should be. But not in America, this is my America. The\nsame thing it\u2019s your America. Who are the Americans? We -- and this is -- and then\nthere are -- there are a lot of places, a lot of where I c -- I could give you a lot of\ninstances that it is the same way I -- when I see injustice and it\u2019s done in America, I\nfeel very bad, because I feel 1t is mine, and there shouldn\u2019t any injustice. ... Mostly\nsongs that I sing -- course, 1t\u2019s a very popular song, because this is from my operetta,\nit\u2019s made by Goldfarden. And the operetta\u2019s name is Shilamis. Shilamis is -- was a\n95\nFebruary 9, 2001\nstory about the ancient Israel. And it\u2019s a -- and there is a song is [speaks Hebrew\nhere] means almonds in raisins. And you -- this is a lullaby. And my daughter knew\nabout it because I always sing it, she didn\u2019t know what the words are. And -- and this\nthey -- this they -- the song is about the Temple, and they described about the Temple,\nand they -- I always lo -- I love older -- ol-older songs, but this 1s special with my\ndaughter. [sings in Hebrew] There is a hymn of the Jewish partisans, you probably\nknow about it. So I always, when I speak about the Holocaust, I always sing this song\nof the Jewish partisans. Yo -- you -- you heard it, you know [sings] [phone rings] I\nalways -- but this is English. This is always -- I sing this when -- when I just was in a\nplace and I sing Yiddish songs and there was one woman, and she said, \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m\nlistening, but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d So I said, \u201cFor you, I have a beautiful Jewish song,\nbut it\u2019s in English.\u201d So she was so glad, so I said this 1s, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Sabbath\nCandles,\u201d did you ever hear it? It\u2019s a beautiful song, I like it. Okay? [sings] \u201cMy\nmother\u2019s Sabbath candles that make our home so bright, that faithfully she light them\nwith a prayer each Friday night. And then around the table, we gathered and we heard\nmy father chant a Kiddush, his heart is everywhere. Our humble home became a\nmansion in that mystic low. Our hearts filled again with hopes and dreams of long ago.\nThrough all the tragic stories of Israel\u2019s darkest nights, they never dimmed the glory\nof my mother\u2019s Sabbath lights.\u201d My mother\u2019s Sabbath lights, I\u2019m sure that all of you\n96February 9, 2001\nremember your mother\u2019s Sabbath lights, and if she was anything like my mother, she\nused to do this. First you put in a babushka, a fichila, or a kerchief over her head and\nlight the minimum of two candles. And if your mother was as religious as mine, she\nalso lit a candle, an extra candle for each child in the house. And even an extra candle\non top, just for good luck. With her hands, she covered her face, and made a traditional\npray -- prayer, because this was the closest she ever got to God. \u201cAnd then around the\ntable, we got it and we heard my father chant the Kiddush, his heart is everywhere.\u201d\n[sings in foreign language here]. \u201cOur humble home became a mansion in the te --\nmystic glow. Our hearts were filled again with hopes and dreams of long ago. Through\nall the tragic stories of Israel\u2019s darkest nights, they never dimmed the glory of my\nmother\u2019s Sabbath lights.
