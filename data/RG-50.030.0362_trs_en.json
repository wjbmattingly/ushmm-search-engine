        "Q: So, let's begin with you introducing yourself.",
        "A: I'm Henry Cohen. I was born in Manhattan, 73 years ago, I'll be 74 in June, and I think I\nwas born on Henry Street in lower Manhattan, the lower East Side. And I don't know\nwhether I was named after the street or whether the street was named after me.",
        "Q: Tell us about your parents.",
        "A: My parents had a checkered career. They were both immigrants, they arrived from\ndifferent communities in Lithuania in approximately 1907. My father was married at the\ntime he arrived. And he and my mother met and they fell in love. And eventually they\nwere married. But a lot of sturm und drang! over many years. And so I, I, I was born in\n1922, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger\nsister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an\nolder half-brother.",
        "Q: What do you know about the towns \u2014 the villages where your parents came from and why\ndid they want to come here?",
        "A: Well, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age. His\nmother died when he was very young. I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called \"A\nCentury of Time.\" And his father remarried a woman who had two small children. My\nfather, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the middle of the night\nand seeing, some feet away in the kitchen area, by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her\nchildren. He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls\nand bread from his father's bakery in the winter and putting 1t under his coat and running\nto the edge of town and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese. So it\nwas that kind of poverty. He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that,\npartly because of the growing spirit of enlightenment, enlightenment that was spreading\nin the 19th century. And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another\ntown, owning a bakery of his own, hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist\nmovement \u2014 and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905. Anyway,\nto escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the United\nStates, leaving behind a wife and one or two children. My mother came from another\ntown, which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but\n' storm and stress (German); \"life's hard knocks,\" hassles.\nthere was apparently a big fire, which she had no memory of. I picked this up at the\nMuseum of the Diaspora in Israel.\nThe population of the town declined by half \u2014 25, 3,000 people. And she was a child of\nvery old parents who had previous marriages. So, at the time she was born, her mother\nwas 50 and her father was 65. And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and\nher father was 80, and that was a family of butchers. And so, her mother and father\ndecided to turn over their little butcher shop to a, an older sister who was married to a\nbutcher, and in return for room for their stay, being taken care of in their old age. And the\nson-in-law, husband of sis\u2014 my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the\nparents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15. So she was sent to America. So,\nit's a story of great poverty, the background.",
        "Q: Can you tell us both of their names?",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Can you tell us both of their names?",
        "A: Yeah, my mother's name was Sadie Sheftel, I think it was Shayne Rochel Sheftel, was the\nfamily name. And my father's name was Avram, Abe, and, I think, I can't quite sort out\nthe grandparent's names. Chana Leah was his mother briefly, until she died. His father's\nname was Israel Feivel. My mother\u2019s father\u2019s name was, I had it and I lost it.",
        "Q: You'll remember it.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And the names of the towns?",
        "A: My mother came from Ivye and my father came from Drozgenik which was a sort of a\nsmall spa. Interestingly enough, I've not been able to find material on Drozgenik in the\nencyclopedia, the Jewish encyclopedia, which has Ivye.\nAnd I, someone at the New York Public Library gave me some alternative names to try to\ntrace through Lithuanian sources. Because for some reason, the Jewish sources don't have\nit.",
        "Q: What did your parents do here? When you were little, how did they make a living?",
        "A: Well, my father became a baker. My mother became a dressmaker. They happened to\nmeet in a small tenement apartment on the Lower East Side. My father's older brother\nlived there with his wife who, it turned out, was a niece of my mother\u2019s, but older than\nmy mother because she had been born to some older half-brother and they had a little\nbaby at the time. And to keep things going they had boarders. So, there was a group of\nmale boarders in one room where my father stayed. And my mother stayed with two or\nthree female boarders in the kitchen on the floor. And that's how they met and shacked\nup.",
        "Q: And they spoke Lithuanian to each other?",
        "A: No, they spoke Yiddish, I think. They may have spoken Lithuanian, but I never heard it.\nYeah, it was Yiddish all the way. And \u2014 but as a result of this upbringing, this parentage,\nwe grew up in a secular household. I was not bar mitzvahed, my brother was not bar\nmitzvahed. We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through Workman's Circle\nschools. And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't read the English\nversion of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward? and reads that. And I\nwent through the Workman's Circle elementary schools, high school, and even into their\nsem-\u2014 the seminary for several years.",
        "Q: Tell us what that is.",
        "A: Well, the elementary school was somewhere in the neighborhood.",
        "Q: No, I mean the Workman's Circle.",
        "A: Workman's Circle was a fraternal organization that was linked to the Jewish socialist\nmovement, the Bund\u2019. And so, in, particularly at the high school level, when I was going,\nI was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars. It was in that\nsense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers. Mendele,*\nPeretz,\u2019 Sholom Aleichem, Ash\u00ae, poets, but not taught Hebrew. And it was an anti-\nZionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists. Anti-\nstateism, stateists. And I\u2014 when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the\ninfantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign. After the\nwar ended in Europe, I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that\ntime in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about\n? Jewish Daily Forward\n> Algemeyner Yidish Arbeter Bund in Lita, Poylen, Rusland [Universal Jewish Worker\u2019s Union in Lithuania,\nPoland and Russia] (Yiddish); Jewish socialist organization.\n* Mocher Seforim Mendele\n> Isaac Leib Peretz\n\u00b0 Sholem Ash\nit. And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this\nSocialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed\nafter the war. And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the\nsenior people at the Workman's Circle complaining about it, and protesting against it, and\ndeclaring that I would never set foot into Workman's Circle activity again. Because I felt\nI had been misguided, politically. And just as a minor passing note, by pure coincidence,\nin the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists\nand some references in the Forward to Jabotinsky\u2019, who was a right wing Zionist, the\nSocialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor\ncarrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky.\nSo, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just\ntold you. And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the\nproblem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben\nGurion\u00ae and Labor and Mapai\u2019 and kibbutzim. So they printed it as the lead letter and the\nheadline was \"Socialist Anti-Zionism \u2014 Zionist Poison.\" So, I'm waiting for the responses\nto come in from the Socialists now.",
        "Q: What, in what way had they misguided you? What did you start learning about or\nrealizing after the war that you felt you had been misguided on?",
        "A: They had trained, they had trained the Jewish side of me, the Yiddish side of me and then\nnot provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education. They were\nanti-stateist. They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl'\u00b0 and Weizman!! and\nthat group also. So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it\nwas clear that the survivors would have to go to a state and the only ones who were\norganizing to take them in were the Zionists from Palestine. They were the ones who\nwere organizing the underground routes to bring them to European ports and transferring\nthem to ships and sneaking them into Palestine. America was not open, the anti\u2014 there\nwere no anti\u2014 there were no refugee immigration laws at the time. So, in that sense, the\nother thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of coming to grips with this six\nmonths later, after I went into UNRRA, I could greet the Chief Rabbi of Palestine with a\nfeeling of love and no mixed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person.\n\u2019 Vladimir Jabotinsky\n\u00ae David Ben Gurion\n? Mifleget Po'alei Eretz Israel; Israeli labor party founded 193 0.\n'0 Theodor Herzl\n'l Chaim Weizman\nI could go into a mass meeting of 2,000 people and hear Ben Gurion and be exhilarated.\nAnd I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my camp on a fellowship basis and\nwhat this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was\nmy all inclusive Jewish quality.",
        "Q: Just a little bit back because I think we need a few details about your time in the military.\nHow did you go into it? Where did you go at first? What did you see and how did that\naffect you?",
        "A: Okay. There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly\nfrom my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or\ntwo. But a friend of mine and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to\ngo in. And I remember us going to a naval recruiting station, oh like 1943, let's say. And\nthe fellow across the desk is saying to us, \"Do you like a good fight?\" And we're; \"uh,\nhuh, uh,\" and, and then he's talking that they need people for LST, for landing ship tanks,\nyou know, to run the boats. And we leave the building and one of us says to the other,\n\"You know, I prefer terra firma, the firmer the better.\" So, independently of one another\nwe were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my\ngetting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I\nwas in Europe. I arrived at the beaches in France, moved to Belgium. What?",
        "Q: The year?",
        "A: 1944, then, September. And within weeks, transferred to, I was a replacement, transferred\nto the ninth Division at the Belgian boarder \u2014 Hurtgen Forest. And overnight the Hiirtgen\nForest had some very special qualities; 1t was a tall forest and what the Germans were\ndoing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the trees and detonate and the\nshrapnel would come down on you.\nAnd one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded. So,\nthat was my initiation into combat. But in any event, I guess it was probably by October\nbegan the onslaught against Germany. And I was with the ninth Infantry Division. Which\nit turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the area in which the\nDP camp I went later, was in. My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries.\nAnd life is very peculiar and funny in some ways. Anyway, so I was in battle for Aachen,\nGermany which 1s closest to the French border. I crossed the Ruhr River, Duren. I was in\nthe Battle of the Bulge. We then moved into the Rhine when that was over. And we were\nin Bad Godesburg which is just south of Bonn. Home to many governmental, German\ngovernmental offices. And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word\ncomes through that we've, the American forces have captured the Remagen bridge and\nthey have sent people over it and we are put onto trucks, and by 11 o'clock in the\nmorning we're down at the site and we're crossing the bridge under direct fire from the\nother hills. Like the Palisades in New Jersey, crossing George Washington, under direct\nfire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the bridge. And\nwe establish a beach head on the other side. Now, just to step back a bit, because I've\nsince been back there and also a friend of mine in New York, was in the public relations\nunit of the division that took the bridge originally. And it's an interesting story about the\ndifference between the American forces and the German forces. By that point in the war,\nHitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making from his commanders.\nIn our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the American\ndivisions, moving through the woods, bypassing the city of Remagen, came to the heights\nthere above the river, they look out and they see the bridge 1s still standing. It was the\nonly bridge still standing. And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the\nregimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to\nGeneral Bradley!\u201d , General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says\nto him, \"Shall \u2014 which battle plan \u2014 shall I stay with the battle plan that we're on, or shall\nI start changing things, because of this discovery of the bridge standing?\" And Ike says,\n\"Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across.\" Now, that was the flexibility in\ndecision making by able people. And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, \"Pour it on,\nget\u201d \u2014 he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, \"let's pour it on.\" And that\nshortened the war by two or three months. And so \u2014 and I've since, incidentally, read\nhistorical criticism of the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest \u2014 basically, as an infantry private, I\nadored my commanders. I adored Bradley. I adored Eisenhower. I thought they were the\ngreatest in the world. And, and anyway, I fought all the way to Leipzig. We could have\nmoved on to Berlin. But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't. And I, I feel great\nabout having been a soldier. I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded.\nIt's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead\nand a standing soldier. I been, you know, battle after battle. I should, also, as an interlude\nhere, indicate that there came a time in early April when we're moving towards the Ruhr\nValley, that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to Paris. That was part of the rotation\nscheme. Letting different soldiers take a few days from the front line. And I went to Paris\nin April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended. And I'm walking \u2014 I'm\nchoking up as I'm telling you this story \u2014 I'm walking along the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and\nword spread that Roosevelt had died. Again, you know, I believe all the things that the\nHolocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but,\nnevertheless, he was my Commander in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's\nbeing well led, and so it was a very moving evening when word came through that he\ndied. And then two days later I was back at the front. Yeah. Anyway, then because of my\n'2 Gen. Omar Nelson Bradley\nprior education and settlement house experience, I succeeded in getting myself\ntransferred to military government. There I was promoted to Technician Fifth Grade. And\nI had terrific relationships with the military government, I don't know who. We were in,\nin a county, incidentally, Landkreis\u2019\u2019, at Ginzburg, which was between Ulm and\nAugsberg, and it happened to be the city, I didn\u2019t notice at the, time, from which the\nMengele family'* comes. I didn't know this. And as part of my duties for a few months, I\nset up a hospital for German women who were presumed to have venereal disease.\nAnd it was in response to the American soldiers who were, came down with venereal\ndisease and they'd have to give the doctors the probable source of their particular\nencounter. And you'd get a name, and I was the chosen one. I set up the hospital and then\nI would drive to the particular community and try to identify the woman. I might meet\nwith the local mayor or police chief or whoever, \"Who's Daisy around here?\" And I'd\nbring her in. And all the way she would complain, she's \u201ceine anstandige Frau,'>\u201d she's a\nrespectable woman, and so on. And then I'd bring them in, go on the ward. We had a\ngroup of nuns taking care of them. They were tested. Then by three days later they\nweren\u2019t giving me any argument that they were respectable women. And, I remember\nonce, a woman, who we finally discharged, came into the colonel or the chief of the\ngroup, wanting a letter that she was a her husband was coming back from the\nLuftwaffe'\u00ae, she wanted some letter attesting to her this and that. And the major, colonel,\ncalls me in and tells me about it and I says, \"Look, all you can do is give her a letter.\"\nEnd of Tape #1\n'3 District (German)\n4 Family of Josef Mengele\n'S a decent woman (German)\n'6 air force (German)\nTape #2",
        "Q: Just finish that last story about the hospital with the German woman, the one, what your\nsupervisor said about the letter.",
        "A: Yeah. Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that\nI've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word. Which is my inspecting a \u2014 some\nhospital facility somewhere in this county we were in, which was a hospital for Jewish\ndisplaced persons. I have absolutely no recall about it. If you had asked me had you had\nany prior contact with Jewish DP\u2019s, I would have said \"no.\" Because I've been asked that\nquestion before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page memo of an inspection of\nthis hospital. And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of Harlem\nhospital in 1961. It's a subliminal yearning I have. Anyway, so, anyway, that county\nexperience was a very interesting experience. And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since\nwhen I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of places, so I\nwas called to serve at Supreme Headquarters in Frankfurt military government. They had\nhigher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to\nFrankfurt and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish \u2014 two years of\nGerman in college, and Yiddish \u2014 I was used as a translator of German documents into\nEnglish.\nAnd then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to Wetzlar\nnorth of Frankfurt to supervise the military government printing plant. That was printing\nmilitary government documents. It was an old German printing force and I was there\noverseeing it. And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I\ndiscovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the\nexecutive director of the settlement house that I had lived in for a year and a half while\ngoing to graduate school, was in Germany, and with UNRRA and he was in Munich. So,\noccasionally, once a month, I don't remember, on a weekend, I would travel from where I\nwas to Munich, which wasn't far, and I'd spend a day with him. And then, in November, I\nlearned that he was leaving Germany for, the States. He was going into the State\nDepartment Office of Refugee Affairs and so, we rendezvoused in Wiesbaden one\nweekend, which was zone headquarters for UNRRA, and it was over that weekend, and\nhis name 1s Dick Winslow, Richard Winslow. He later, a year later, two years later,\nbecame the Secretary General to the Unite States Mission to the United Nations, right\nafter it was formed. A very able fellow. Anyway, over this weekend, he said, \"What the\nhell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a printing plant, when there\nwould be so much more important things for you to be doing given your background and\nyour interests?\"\nYou see, at the settlement house. my, one of my major assignments during the year and a\nhalf I was there, you had to do something in exchange for room and board, it was the\nSouth End House, was the second oldest settlement house in the country. It had been\nfounded in 19 \u20141892 or 1893. He had to prepare a 50th annual report. He turned that\nassignment over to me. I went into all the historical files and books and reports and this\nand everything. I did the draft of the 50th annual report. This is how he and I became so\nclose. Then he did some revision and upgrading and this and that, and it was printed. And\nthen I did other things in the settlement house community, I did a term paper for my\nmaster's program on city planning, on the South End planning board. A history of that\nand what it did. So, he had a pretty good sense of my intellectual and practical interests\nof experience and then the following morning he brought me into zone headquarters and\nGertrude Richland(ph) was there from the Eastern Division. A marvelous woman, she\njust died about two years ago in Santa Barbara. She later became Chief Public Welfare\nOfficer in Washington, D.C. And they recruited me, signed me up, and they had in mind\nfor me to go to Fohrenwald because the then director was a Canadian woman, a fine\nwoman in many ways, but having inordinate difficulties with the Jewish DP\u2019s. She\nseemed to be somewhat rigid and the plan was for me to come in, serve for several weeks\nas her deputy, and then two weeks later she would be transferred out and I would become\nthe director. Anyway, then\u2014",
        "Q: Just before we get into that, I would like to just move back and get a sense of what was\nyour feeling, when you were in the infantry, about the war? What did you think you were\nfighting against, your contact with Germans? And then as the information came out about\nthe Holocaust, did you have any contact with it in anyway?",
        "A: Well, I guess I completely identified with the war effort.",
        "Q: I mean, you can tell from the way I spoke a few minutes ago about Roosevelt, that I had\nabsolutely no question in my mind or emotions about the purposes of the war. I had, I \u2014\nbecause of my German Yiddish, even in doing combat periods, I was always being used\nas an interpreter whenever we'd capture German prisoners. So, I had a lot of contact with\nGerman prisoners of war, army, whatever branch they were from. I had a lot of contact\nwith the German civilians. I didn\u2019t trust Germans. Didn't matter what they said to me. I\nwas always doing my job. You know. In some ways, I have a one track mind and in the\nsense of being focused. And \u2014 then when we ended the war in Leipzig, I don't remember\nwhat date we arrived there, April 29th, 28th \u2014 May first \u2014 a week or two \u2014 week before\nthe end of the war, they started \u2014 the commander started sending us across the river\nwhich is at Leipzig to a little peninsula there that's formed by another river and we were\ncasing the joint before the Russians arrived and after a few days, there were tens of\nthousands of German troops running away from the Russians to the American zone. And\nwe're just a few soldiers, and they're armed and we've got one rifle on our shoulder. We\nwere marching thousands of German soldiers westward across the river. And I don't even\nremember how we got across the river. And so, I had a lot of contact. And down in the\nmilitary government and in the county, I had a lot of contact with Germans. Remember, I\nwas having contacts with the Biirgermeisters'\u2019 and the chiefs of police and the health\nofficials and so on and so forth. But, in a certain sense, I was the conqueror, I had the\npower. And it's interesting to me, Katie!\u00ae, and I don't understand it considering my\nbackground, but you've seen some of the pictures. I was, here I was a private and a\ncorporal, but in the pictures that I have of UNRRA, you see the qualities with which I\nexpress, I visually express authority.\nSo, you know, speaking to the DP\u2019s, you can see, I don't know where it comes from. And,\nSO, In my relations with the Germans and so on and so forth, matter of factly, I'm never\nhemming or hawing, or beating the bush, I'm always going about doing my business and\nI'm, I, not making any judgments about them. This individual, that individual. A woman\nhas venereal disease, we deal with that. I was not with any group that was opening\nconcentration camps, I was not with any group that was dealing with the SS or with the\npolitical dimension in terms of the war crimes trials that would later occur. I was not in\nthat. Somehow or other in ways that I have absolutely no memory of, whether it's Stars\nand Stripes, whether American Armed Forces Radio, I learned about the Holocaust. I\ndon't think anybody was sending me the New York Times or the Paris edition of the\nHerald Tribune, but somehow I was in gathering. And it was obvious from what I did\nwith regard to the Workman's Circle, that it was, it was working on my system. And that\nI had strong feelings about it. Oh, powerful feelings about it. And when one thinks later\nabout my last encounter in Germany with Dick Winslow and a colleague who was\nleaving at the same time, Roger Masteude, they were telling me to come in, I didn't jump\nat it. I asked a lot of questions. It was a gradual, two day, weekend process. I was doing a\nlot of soul searching, incidentally.. Now that I think about it. Doing a lot of soul\nsearching that weekend on other matters. I was soul searching about what I felt was the\ninanity and the corruption of many of the American soldiers I was running into. I \u2014 at \u2014I\nmean, remember, I was an educated young kid, a City College!\u2019 graduate and proud of\nthat, MIT\u201d graduate and proud of that.\nAnd I was dealing with very \u2014 I was a private, I wasn't an officer \u2014 and dealing with these\npeople in various situations. And that was not what was giving me my love for America.\nWhen I was running the printing plant I lived with some local group of soldiers. I was\n'7 mayors (German)\n'8 Katherine Davis\n'9 City College of New York\n0 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nnot, I was attached to them for room and board. My unit was in Frankfurt and I could see\nsome of these guys were wheelers, dealers, black market. We were eating venison \u2014\nwhere were they getting the fresh deer from? So, here were very close friends, spirits,\nover that weekend with Dick and Roger Masteude. And I was just getting out all the pain\nof that experience to them. And I guess it was partly that accumulated pain as well as my\nJewish identity that finally enabled them to convince me to do this, and for me to say\nokay.",
        "Q: Elaborate a little bit on that. You say your Jewish identity. Do you remember how that\ncame into play? Or anything you thought?",
        "A: Oh, well it's hard. It's my second nature. You know it's \u2014 people can't understand this\nabout me, because of my secularism and my lack of the bar mitzvah. I never touched foot\nin a synagogue, literally, until maybe 10 years ago. It was just not part of my background.\nNow, I do different things that bring me into that, even though I can\u2019t believe what\nthey're talking about. For me, it's history, not religion. And I can identify with the history,\nI can extract philosophical meaning from it and, belief. And be proud of that and share\nthe pain. No, I think that this small group of people has made an enormous, an inordinate\ncontribution to the world and to world civilization. For a variety of reasons and so on.\nYou know, when I was a junior at college, sociology major, I was declared, whatever, an\nhonor student.\nAn honor student was relieved of having to take certain courses for credit. But, in\nexchange, the honor student had to do a paper, a two year project. And submit it and that\nwould complete the terms of the thing. And I did a paper on the Jewish ghetto as a form\nof either adaptation or a form of accommodation to the urban environment. Remember, I\nwas an urbanist. And I spent a good deal of those two years in the library studying Jewish\nhistory. Going back almost 2,000 years in terms of Venice and Prague and other places.\nAnd up to Louie Wirth's book on the ghetto, he 1s professor of sociology at the University\nof Chicago. I\u2014 in 1940, 1940, '41, I was studying the various ethnicity data and the\nincidents of different social economic indicators and medical indicators of Jews\ncompared to other immigrant groups. I immersed myself in that material. It was really in\na sense, that piece of work that led me into city planning not vice versa. It was this\nfeeling that if this history and this culture could lead to certain cultural qualities and\nchanges, that made them so much better adapted to the urban environment than other\ngroups, then maybe there's a volitional way in which you could do things in general that\nwould improve the urban environment. And that's when I set in, I didn't know there were\nmasters degrees in city planning at the time. I hardly, barely knew that there was a city\nplanning commission in New York. I began putting it together in my own head. I went\nout, I found that the University of Iowa was virtually the only university in the country\nthat had two summer sessions back to back. So, I applied and I went out to Iowa and I\nstarted taking courses in what I thought were \u2014 one would want me to know in order to\nput these things together.\nI took a course in surveying. I took a course in civil engineering. I took courses in\ncalculus. I took courses in spherical trigonometry. In order, back then, sometime in early\nAugust, I'm in the library and I'm looking at the Sunday New York Times and\nsomewhere I come across a little squib that, which indicates that Mass \u2014 MIT is going to\nstart offering a bachelors degree in city planning. So, I write the chairman of the program\na letter saying, \"I already have a baccalaureate degree, but I would like to enter this\nprogram if you would give me certain credit for my past baccalaureate,\" and I get a letter\nback from him saying oh, they already have a masters program. I wouldn't have to take\nthe baccalaureate, he would, with my background, he would admit me to the masters\nprogram. And he was then the one, he gave me a scholarship, and he was then the one\nwho guided me to the settlement house for, so I could live cheaply. My parents or I, we'd\nsurvive with food on the table during the depression, but that's how I got to the settlement\nhouse. And little did I know when this was happening that the chairman of the program,\nFred Adams, was the son of the chief city planner who had, British city planner, who had\ndone the major New York regional plan of 1929, 1930. And, so it was, again, it was in\nthat Jewish context, I mean, that stuff surrounds you and penetrates you. I didn't have to\ngo to shul\u2019! or synagogue\u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember when you decided to take the job what you're thoughts were? Perhaps\nsome of this was in your mind about, \"I do know these things, maybe I could run a camp\nbecause I know about city and\u2014\"",
        "A: You know, the only part of \u2014 I say the only part of the experience that I didn't have, the\ncontent was no problem. The human relationships were no problem.\nThe analytic component was no problem. The listing of tasks to be taken care of was no\nproblem. I come across three pages of notes in my background stuff outlining all the,\ntasks to be taken care of. That was no problem. The only part of the experience that I\ndidn't have was supervising other people. And \u2014 but I should add a thought here \u2014 which\nwas, I just think of it, I never, I have not made this connection before, Katie. You have to\nunderstand, Sept \u2014 September, 1942, I'm coming from the ghetto in East New York,\nBrooklyn, from the entire ghetto of my life, and I'm moving into Boston, into a settlement\nhouse, with a group, not only with the staff, that has no Jews on it, but, but a group of\nresidents who are also living there, none of, no one else of whom is Jewish. I'm the kid on\n71 synagogue (Yiddish)\nthe block. And I make a terrific adaptation. They loved me. I was getting such love back\nfrom this diversified group of people \u2014 all of whom were older than me. It's like what I'm\ntelling you, what I told you earlier, about my mentors. I don't know how they, why, how\nthey attached to me. They saw something in me. I never set out to get them as it were.\nAnd here the, we had, there was a Peruvian couple, or Chile, I don't remember. Chile. Oh,\nno. There was a Chilean couple, a Peruvian guy, two women musical students, one from\nKentucky and one from somewhere else. People from Illinois and this and that. And they\nloved me. It was a supportive environment. So, I guess that experience of who I was in\nsome way played into my ability to move into this international staff and manage with\nthem.\nBecause you see, in a certain sense, intellectually, intellectually I was their equal.\nAnalytically, I was probably ahead of most of them. Even in my ability to size up\npolitical situations. I was probably pretty good. Given, you know, given my military\ngovernment experience of working, again, with the military. I haven't mentioned that the\nmilitary government team must have included 15, 20 other people with whom I was\nrelating all the time. Or when I was going into Frankfurt, into SHAEF~\u201d and related, so I\nhad a lot of relationship experience. So, I guess I overcame the lack of administrative,\nworking with older people, administrative experience. And I must have had some\ncharismatic quality that I don't, still don't quite recognize, 'cause I'm insecure, Katie.",
        "Q: Okay, now\u2014\nEnd of Tape #1\n?2 Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces\nTape #3",
        "Q: Paint us a picture, then, of that first day you were taken to the camp, were you in uniform\n\u2014 remind us how old you were, what did it look like to you \u2014 at first I presume someone\nmight have taken you around \u2014 what were your thoughts?",
        "A: Well, the camp, I came in the middle of January. I was wearing a new uniform. An\nofficer style, you know. The camp consisted of about 280 buildings. It was built by the\nI.G. Farben Company to house slave labor that they were employing in a munitions\nfactory in the woods to the south. The buildings, because it was for slave labor, were not\ntypical detached, semi\u2014 detached buildings. They, they had no kitchen facilities, no\ncooking facilities. The only communal facility in each building was a toilet or two. They,\nthe buildings consisted of one large room on the top floor, second floor, and one small\nroom on the ground floor. Food was dispensed in a kitchen area. People would go, wait\non line, get food, either eat it there or come back to the room and eat it. Having gotten rid\nof the slave labor, the Army took over this village for DP\u2019s and it gradually became a\nJewish camp before I got there. It was also cold. Bavarian winter is awful. I had spent the\nprevious winter in the Black Forest \u2014 parts of the Black Forest. It \u2014 we slept outdoors, in,\nin fox holes. There was a constant flow of soldiers who, what did they call it, black, not\nblack foot, black something or other, they's lose their digits, their toes, their feet.",
        "Q: Frostbite?",
        "A: No, there was another name for it. I was cold, but I never suffered from that. But anyway,\nthese winters are very cold. Anyway, I went around camp, I met the staff. I don't have\nmuch recall of that the first few days in that sense. I was absorbing.\nVisiting the kitchen, seeing how they cooked. Visiting the hospital. We had two hospital\nbuildings. And I don't remember now exactly, but within a week or two of my arrival,\nthe, the, the cold was so substantial that it froze the pipes leading to the toilets. Four\nhundred out of 600 toilets were out of commission. The area of the toilets became like a\ncow barn, like cow barns. It was awful. It was awful. It took several weeks to deal with\nthe pipe problem. As someone said it, \"gets worse until it gets better.\" But, you have to\nremember, and I'll, I'll, I'll be making notes on this along with, that that was happening to\nthem eight and a half months after liberation. They were living under conditions like that,\nAnd, anyway, it was during that period that Jean Henshaw, the former director left. I\nassumed the directorship. And I should tell you, just somewhere in here, because I can't\nremember which comes first and which comes second.\nThere was a subsidiary group attached to the team, we had a few people from Joint\nDistribution Committee\u201d\u2019 attached to us, we had a group of three, four, five people from\nthe Jewish Agency for Palestine. Remember, this is two years before the creation of the\nstate. We're now into February of '46, and, and also because of my background, I'd never\ndealt with Zionists before. The Army later accused me of being a member of Zionist\norganizations, but little did they know I'd never been in the Zionist movement before.\nBut, nevertheless, there's this group. And they, after, we had a large house for the team,\nover 20 members of the team. They came from Australia, Norway, England, France,\nU.S., elsewhere, I don't, and Israel, and Palestine. And we had billets. We were billeted in\na large house at the edge of the German town, which was called Wolfratshausen. And,\nand so, and we'd have breakfast there, sometimes lunch, and usually dinner. After dinner\nthey invite me to one of their rooms for a drink or whatever. And it was in the course of\nthat, that I established with them and they established with me, very close relationships.\nBut they, being sophisticated undergrounders, which I was not, at that time, start asking,\nyou know, warmly asking me questions like you are asking the questions. \"Where did\nyour mother come from? Where did your father?\" But that's all preliminary. They're\nsizing me up, could they trust me or not trust me? You're not asking me questions like\nthat in order to ascertain whether you can trust me or not, you're asking me questions for\noral history. They're asking me the questions to ascertain, can they trust me? And after\nseveral weeks of this process, it basically boils down to they trust me. They trust me.\nOkay. However, in underground activity, there's another rule.\nAnd that is, you never share with anyone anything more than that person has to know. So,\nthe person has deniability. Okay? So, I am not curious and they are not volunteering\ninformation. I notice things from time to time around the edges. Okay? For example, one\nof them says to me one, \"I don't know, Friday or whatever, would you like to go to\nSalzburg for the weekend and hear some music?\" And I say, \"Sure, but I don't have any \u2014\nthe appropriate papers.\" He says, \"Don't worry about it.\" And, en route, we drive north,\nwhich was not the right direction, to Munich, and we stop in front of a building and they\ngo inside, I'm in the car. I've given them some of my papers. They come out with\nappropriate visa papers and all of that to cross over and come back to the American zone.\nWe go to Salzburg, we drive to Salzburg. And we had a wonderful weekend. A month\nlater, whatever, one of them says, \"How would you like to go to Switzerland?\" So, they\nwere organizing my leisure time for me with false papers. I don't ask any questions. I just\ngo along for the ride. These are the Jewish Agency for Palestine. The, Ben Gurion, at that\ntime, was the chief executive of the Jewish Agency for Palestine. I get to know the zone\nchief of this group in Munich who years later, almost 30 years later, 25 to 30 years later,\nbecomes, what do they call it, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. And,\nincidentally, and that's like 19\u2014 that was in '64, but then I discovered a few years later\n3 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\nthat he lost a son, in the '67 war. So, it brings these things close to home. Anyway, that\nwas the group. But I developed a closeness to the Joint\u201d* staff, Stanley Abramovitch was\na rabbi from England, Becky Althoff was a social worker from New York, and we had a\nmarvelous woman from Norway, Astrid Oksny. I tried to trace her some years ago and I\nfound out she had passed away prematurely. Then in early March, the Americans are\nblowing up things in the I.G. Farben plant. And in the process, they destroy the water\nmain that is carrying water to the camp. And I start calling desperately for the Army to\nget water tanks in and do something. We get a few tanks, the few tanks that come in we\nturn over to the hospital facility. But there's no cooking that takes place during that,\ntoilets again. Then by the fourth or fifth day, I am out of my mind, and I start calling my\nheadquarters and so on. Finally, a general appears and that leads to, but 1t shows also how\nin a period of crises, how hard it was to get the U.S. Army to pay attention to a real\nproblem. And now, throughout all of this, these trials and tribulations, we also have a lot\nof very positive things going on. We organize a theater. We organize schools for the\nchildren. There's a yeshiva. We have hospital going, children are being, babies are being\nborn, at an enormous clip for that size population. We \u2014 We're running an agricultural\ntraining center to the south. Where they're learning how to work on a kibbutz. Now\nthere's little, probably a little military activity on the side, but I don't know about it. But\nit's a positive education of these people who until the previous May, have lived under the\nmost forlorn situations. The children are giving performances. The adults are putting on\nplays and they're starting to publish a camp newspaper in Yiddish, and a magazine. And\nwe \u2014 there's established a camp committee for self governance and there's, there are\nelections for membership on the camp committee and 1,000 to 2,000 people are voting in\nthe elections in order to make the camp committee representative.\nAnd I'm dealing with them. And we have over 1,000 people employed in tasks in the\nkitchen, in the warehouse, in the transportation unit, in the hospital. We're employing\npeople. We have vocational training activity. Machinery and other things; sewing, that's\ngoing on. There are a lot of positive emotional rebuilding efforts here. But, the food is\nbasically GI issue. It's canned. It's not fresh. They, the Army, doesn't want to take it out\nof the German economy. There's three ounces of protein a day. Whether a piece of\ncanned fish or canned chicken or this or that. You have it at one meal, you don't have it at\nany of the others. So, a black market in food develops. And the Army 1s beside itself as if\nits going to destroy the German economy. But who's selling to them? The German\nfarmers. They're probably selling to some of the military government units to, so, but in\norder to prove myself, my\u2014 and, basically, I don't like black marketing. I was telling you\nearlier how I was reacting moralistically to black marketing among the soldiers. I didn't\nwant Jews to be involved in the black market, it offends me, it's a backwards step in\ncommunity building.\n4 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\nSo, I have to do something. Now, it occurs to me when I read all this stuff that, \"How did\nthey get the cows into the camp?\" They were probably leading them past our DP police\ngroup that was on duty in the middle of the night. What am I going to do? But, at least\nonce a month, I would get up in the middle of the night. All by myself. I'd drive into the\ncamp alone. I'd pick up a couple of my DP police at the gate and I'd start driving around\nthe camp, looking for lights in the basement. If there were a light in the basement, it\nmeant, usually, that a butcher was killing a cow. And on the 29 days of the month that I\ndidn't come around, word would spread in the morning, \"there's meat in 'x' building, 'x'\nstreet,\" and people would start flowing and buying meat. I don't know where they got the\nmoney, whatever. So, I'd come in and I'd confiscate the meat and I'd, we'd bury it. We\ndidn't throw it into the kitchen. And I'd put the butchers into the brig. And during the day\nI'd visit them and I remember one of them saying, \"Herr Cohen, you don't understand us\nbutchers. For us blood means nothing. The cows are yours.\" I'd say to the police, \"Give\nthem an extra day.\" I didn\u2019t turn them over to the Army, I didn't turn them over to the\nGerman police.",
        "Q: How did you feel, though, about taking food away which you, yourself, just said was\nneeded?",
        "A: I felt awful. I was, but, but, I want to tell you something, Katie, as I read these various\nmemos and records, and having been in, in government for the years \u2014 I was, nine years\nin Mayor Wagner's\u201d cabinet \u2014 governance is constantly involving you in dilemmas and\ndifficult choices. Impossible choices, hair-raising choices. And it's happening all the\ntime. And if you can't make choices, you got to get out of there. You know, this\nantigovernment stuff, for me, is in some ways, a lot of nonsense.\nBecause a democratic society has to have a system where, without killing, you make\nchoices. And, so, in a DP camp, the director has to make difficult, impossible choices.\nAnd, so, but, I don't want to get to this too soon in the interview, but, on something like\nApril 12th of that year, a week before Pesach, I went to the Munich railroad station and I\nsent off a couple of cables to the \u2014 to friends in the States. I sent one cable to Dick\nWinslow in the State Department and another cable to William Wurster a prominent\narchitect at that time, in Cambridge. And I tell them about the food situation. The\nimpossibility of it \u2014 no fresh food for Pesach \u2014 we got a little bit from the Joint. And the\nend, the end of my sentence 1s, \"stir up the bees.\" And I get replies from both of them.\nBut, I hadn't given it a thought at the time, but it's clear to me in \u2014 then and in retrospect,\nthat Army Intelligence picked up the cables. And I'll come back to that later. Just on a\npersonal note, during the period we were without water, when the pipe had burst, which\n5 Robert F. Wagner Jr.\nwas exhausting period for me, I came back to my office one day to take care of some\nmatters, and a few minutes later, my English secretary, Rose Hafkin, comes in, she says,\n\"Henry, there's a woman outside who says she thinks she's your cousin.\" And I say,\n\"Well, have her wait few minutes, I've got to take care of this or that,\" and then a few\nminutes later I call her in. And now I'm suspicious, I don't know if she's my cousin or not.\nIt would be advantageous to her if she is my cousin. So, I start interrogating her.\nAnyway, I don't know whether she found out about me through the grapevine, because\npeople are always asking, \"Where did your parents come from?\" and then when they hear\nsomeone comes from that town, well, \"Oh, the director at Camp Fohrenwald, his mother\ncomes from there, his father comes from there.\"\nWell, whether there had been some correspondence between her and family in New\nYork, I don't know. She's my cousin. And, she comes from the Sheftel branch of the\nfamily tree, my mother\u2019s, the butcher side of the family, not the baker side. It turns out\nshe has a brother in the camp to whom she doesn't talk, he's a butcher. He's probably one\nof my black marketers. I don't know at the time whether he's the one who made the threat.\nIt's a small world. But, anyway, she has a sister in this camp that both of them are living\nin, just north of Munich and the sister has a young daughter, I don't know, seven, eight,\nnine, 10. And, I ask her, \"How did you survive?\" Well, what happened was, the Germans\nhad occupied the town Ivye, and at a certain point they told \u2014 word spread, everybody\nhad to come out to the village square with their pots and pans, the Germans needed the\nmetal. My cousin, this cousin, didn't wait for that, she escaped into the woods and lived\nthe rest of the war with the partisans. And her older sister must have left sometime earlier\nand gone into Siberia with her little girl and spent the war in Siberia. And, so it was a\nvery moving experience. And, she has since, they migrated many years ago to Canada,\nToronto, and became very wealthy. Now, another thing involving the black market, the\nso called black market\u2014",
        "Q: The people who went to the town square, were they deported?",
        "A: No, they were shot, I'm sorry, they were shot. I'm very sorry. Very few survivors from\nIvye.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s town?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And the, how about the brother that she didn't speak with? How had he survived?",
        "A: I don't recall. There was other family of theirs in South Africa, Rhodesia. Other brothers.",
        "Q: So, here you were, the director of the Displaced Person's camp, you\u2019re dealing with\neverything, fought in a war, you have family here.",
        "A: No. At the end of the interview, I'll give you another find.",
        "Q: Okay",
        "A: That's not in any of the material that you've read.\nEnd of tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Well, her name was Malka and the second names mean nothing because \u2014 her sister had\nan assumed name, Bashke \u2014 they were both Sheftels. Now, Malka, somewhere in this\nprocess, maybe in the woods or in battle with the partisans or whatever, lost the love of\nher life at the time, Bashke obviously, lost her husband. And \u2014 but, but it's hard to recall\nnow. Malka was probably born after my mother left, and Bashke was probably born after\nmy mother left Ivye, so there was no contact on that score. By the time they would have\nhad any consciousness in terms, by virtue of age, they would probably not even have had\nany memory about my mother\u2019s mother, no longer lived in Ivye. She went, they took her\nto some town, I don't remember. So, there was a little talk about the family, but I don't\nreally remember much of that. That 1s \u2014 the critical thing was, they were family, they\nwere survivors, they had been through hell, and I didn't really find out too much about\ntheir day to day lives.\nI have the impression about the older sister in Siberia. She'd be groveling in the soil,\nplanting, picking, whatever. I guess that in those days, I, I, well, let me put it this way,\nwhat I realize now in my dotage, is that for every one who died and for every one who\nsurvived, there would really be 10 or 20 stories. So, in a certain sense there are 100 to\n200,000,00 stories. And we know only a few of them. And that was not an age for me\nwhen I was collecting stories and, and, in a way, it, it, it \u2014 the \u2014 it \u2014 my focus on what I'm\nabout, puts a limit on certain of the human connections from time to time. When people\nwant to be able to tell you and so on, and you're focused and you're doing one, two, three\non the list, see? So, I don't really remember that much about that. In any event, the\npassage of time also dims recall.",
        "Q: Was there ever a time when you were focused on solving a problem, perhaps a broken\nwater pipe or something, and just somehow the fact that someone was a survivor, sort of\ncaught you by surprise? Perhaps something they said, or the way they looked, facial\nexpressions?",
        "A: You know \u2014 the \u2014 a couple of stories sometimes. I don't know if you have that picture in\nyour group. There are four little girls, they're all dressed in costumes. It's clear they've\njust been in some performance. And two of the four girls, the two little ones on the, each\nside, left and right, have faces that are so gaunt and with that smile on their face, the\nvisage. The two older ones are smiling. The two little ones, here it is, you know, close to\na year after the war, and the quietness wherever they were that was droned into them,\nhasn't yet enabled them to blossom out. The other, I don\u2019t know whether this answers \u2014\ndeals with your question, Katie, but, again, it's an encounter, a very severe encounter. We\nhad, in our camp, a Rabbi Halberstam\u201d\u00b0. He was called the Klausenburg Rabbi. He was a,\nfrom a line of hundreds of years of rabbis, and he was born to be a rabbi. I'm gonna, I'll\ncome back to this in a minute, but I want to skip to the last week or two. I've been trying\nto find out his first name. I actually had it somewhere on a piece of paper and I can't\nlocate the piece of paper. So, I, I decided I would go to the Brooklyn telephone book and\nlook up Halberstam and make a few phone calls and ask about the Klausenburg Rabbi.\nAnd what was his first name. Okay? So I go to the Brooklyn phone book, I have a 1992\nBrooklyn phone book, it doesn't matter. Okay? And I see Halberstam, it's almost a\ncolumn long. And what I see in this listing of Halberstams is how many have attached to\ntheir name, \"Rabbi.\" So, you know, with my statistical bent, I do a count. Forty-three\npercent of the telephone listings are people with the word rabbi in front of their names.\nThat's the Halberstam lineage, okay? I use statistics to illuminate, not lie. I mean that is\nsuch a powerful fact, okay? So, anyway, we're back. So, now, he had lost his wife in the\nHolocaust, and maybe 10 children. This man had suffered. Deeply is not an expression\nfor the suffering that must have been inside this man. And he was in touch with his\nconfreres in New York, and they raised money.\nAnd they piled all these supplies, canned food, dried food, kosher food, clothing,\nreligious articles, books on a boat that came, arrived in Bremen. And the Army would not\nrelease the material to Rabbi Halberstam. And the cables must have flown between\nBremen and Munich and New York and New York and Washington and political\npressure brought on Congress people, on the State Department, on the Army and finally\nafter a week or two, a compromise is reached. They will release his \u2014 that material to the\ndirector of the camp. So, I am once again confronted with those daily dilemmas, what do\nI do with that material? Can I \u2014 considering the pressure I am under from the Army on\nthe black market, simply transfer it over to Rabbi Halberstam? So, I am summoned to his\nroom. He was one of the very few people in the camp who had a room of his own.\nSomewhere I have it, well, I won't bother, but probably 10 by 10 would have been a lot.\nAnd I'm sitting across him, across the table from him, and he's in a Hasidic robe, big\nblack beard, yarmulke hat, whatever.\nBlack piercing eyes. And, remember what I told you earlier, I have never set foot in a\nsynagogue in my life to that point \u2014 nor for two or three decades later \u2014 and here I am\nconfronting the Klausenburg Rabbi, a king \u2014 I'm an ordinary administrative bureaucrat.\nAnd we exchanged perfunctory greetings. And then in effect he says, \"Nu?\" I say, \"Nu,\nwhat?\" He wants to know why I don't turn the material over to him. I say, \"But Rabbi, if\nthe Army had intended for me to turn it over to you, they would have given it to you\ndirectly. But they turned it over to me which means that I can't turn it over to you.\" He\n*6 Jekuthieh Judah Halberstam\nsays, \"That's not fair.\" I hadn't yet learned the John Kennedy phrase which didn't come\nfor 15 years later, \"life is unfair.\" I said, \"I can't. It would create so much trouble, I can't\ntell you.\" He says, \"It belongs to me.\" I say, \"I know it belongs to you, but I can't. I will\ndistribute it among the people of the camp. You will get a good share of it, but you will\nnot get all of it.\" He is so upset. His eyes are piercing through me. I finally say to him,\n\"But, Rabbi, the other people are Jews too, they have also suffered.\" He basically, didn't\ngive a damn. I teamed something from that, I'd not encountered that before. Here I am, an\nall inclusive Jew, what I hadn't quite recognized were the meaning of these divisions with\nunbridgeable attitudes or whatever.\nThe meeting broke up and I left. And I knew it wasn't fair. I knew, to this day, I know it\nwasn't fair. The Army shouldn't have done what it did, put me in that position. But, again,\nI had to make a decision. I had to choose. And, and, I made that choice. I mean, I don't\nrecall that subsequently there were any further ramifications from it, but 1t was that\nincident, you see. Constantly. Now, let me just say, not only was the black market, this\nproblem. You've heard -You've about it, you hear me about it. But, the Army was also\ngreatly preoccupied with the infiltration problem. The British clearly didn't want more\nJews in Germany. And I have, I haven't gone into that here, but I've been to the National\nArchives and for selected weeks here and there over the last, during the last five years,\nmaybe in the aggregate I've spent a month or five weeks of time at the National Archives,\ntrying to get some better understanding of the context. And, incidentally, you find some\nvery interesting material there on that. I mean, for example, you come across cables, in\nlate '45, the State Department is cabling all the ambassadors in every country in the\nworld, asking on a top secret basis, \"Is there any room in your \u2014 in the country you are\ndesignated to, is there any room for Jews?\" And then you see cables coming back \u2014 I\ndon't think I've read all the cables coming back \u2014 but substantially, the answer is \"no.\"\nBut, what you get in that period is the sense that Harry Truman and the State Department,\nunder pressure from the British with regard to Palestine, want to explore what are the\noptions? Then in other material, you find the secret memoranda flowing out of the\nEastern countries, Poland, Sweden, Copenhagen, relating to the Zionist plot to move\npeople into the U.S. zone of Germany.\nAnd. some rabbi whose been to Poland, meets with the American Ambassador in\nStockholm and he's telling him about what he found. Anyway, you come across all this\nstuff. And some of it is suggestive of a conspiracy. I've been exploring this in order to\nunderstand what I was in the middle of, you see? Finally, I don't remember the date now,\nthere's a long memorandum, there are two I think, memorandum from Robert Murphy,\nwhose the chief political officer at the office of military government, he was Ike's*\u2019 chief\n7 Dwight D. Eisenhower\npolitical officer in Tunisia, North Africa, and he's basically saying, \"You're not dealing\nbasically with a conspiracy. You're dealing \u2014 what you\u2019re dealing with is the fact that the\nJews don't want to live in a country that was a cemetery to their people, their relatives.\nThey are fearful of the Poles because when they go back to claim property, there are\nkillings. They know that the country is going Communist, they don't want to live under a\nCommunist government. It's in this atmosphere \u2014 to get out of this that the Zionists are\nenabling. It's not a conspiracy, okay?\" So, that's at the highest level of military\ngovernment. You come in at the field level, the second most important issue for this for\nthe battalion leaders, is the infiltration.\nSo, they start passing rules that we can't give out food cards to people who haven't had\nprior food cards. We can't give out identity cards to people who haven't had prior identity\ncards. How do you think we feel if, 1f in a team, you all have to be Jewish if you're in this\nteam, you're there for social humanitarian purposes. How do you feel being told you can't\ngive out these cards to people who are infiltrating? Okay? Now, I should point out\u2014",
        "Q: How do you feel?",
        "A: You feel awful. And rebellious. And you're gonna bootleg cards somehow. And, and, I\nshould tell you this anecdote. Nevertheless, under all of this pressure, twice a month, at\nmidnight, you can ask \u2014 start asking, \"When did I get some sleep?\" I would go to the\ncamp, pick up a few cops, maybe this time I've had a staff or two with me, and we would\nstart going into every building and every room and taking a count of who is there \u2014 name,\nand who is there. We were doing a midnight check and let's say, we found 2,500 people\nin the camp. The next morning, word would spread that there was a midnight check. A\nthousand or more people from all over Germany would suddenly descend on you. They\nwere in Munich to see a relative. They were in Munich to check on their papers. They\nwere here because of that, they were \u2014 you don't know which of them are telling the truth\nand who, and who 1s lying. So, some end up with duplicate cards. Okay? You're making\ndifficult decisions, right?",
        "Q: So, you're trying to control who's in the camp, but what you're saying said, people are\ncoming in, maybe eight months after the war has ended, and the U.S. Army doesn't want\nthem to, or UNRRA doesn't want them to\u2014",
        "A: No, no. I'm making two \u2014 I'm really talking about two categories. I'm talking about the\npeople who are already in Germany and who are, who are exploiting the system by\ngetting duplicate cards so they can pick up the food here and there and move it on the\nblack market and get a little cash. Okay? And the other is the fresh arrivals. Okay? And\nthe Army is against the fresh arrivals. They don't like the duplicate cards, either, but they\ndon't want any more. Because no matter what Robert Murphy at the top level says \u2014\nremember the top leadership is smarter, they're more politically connected to what's\ngoing on in the States, so they \u2014 their attitude to Eisenhower and McCloy and so it's\ndifferent at the ground. Well, let me just state something else, Katie. You're too young \u2014\nYou have to understand that in the 1930s \u2014 I didn\u2019t experience the 1920s, I was a child \u2014\nbut in 1930s and '40s there was a lot of antisemitism in the United States. A lot of\nordinary citizens had anti-Jewish feelings. They're your troops. It's reflected \u2014 if you ask\ndoctors who are, let's say, 75 years old and over, \"What was it like getting into medical\nschool in the 1930s?\" You'll hear stories. My brother \u2014 I spoke to a fellow up on the\nvineyard who's a professor emeritus of physiology at Johns Hopkins, he graduated as an\nundergraduate in the '30s, first in his class at Johns Hopkins, was not admitted to the\nmedical school. Went to the University of Maryland medical school and then sometime\nin the '50s, I guess, became the first Jewish professor at Johns \u2014 of medicine at Johns\nHopkins. There was antisemitism, this is the \u2014 people don't speak about it now. I mean, it\nwasn't violent, it wasn't virulent like in Europe and certain various places, Germany,\ncertainly Poland. But, there was lots. So when you \u2014 when, at the ground floor level they,\nthe infiltration, the infiltrees, are an inconvenience. It upsets the system. They want\ndiscipline \u2014 order, that's all an occupation force understands. I, I, I, I came across a letter\nsomeone in 1948 was asking me would I be willing to lecture at some military training\nprogram in the States as part of an effort to enrich an understanding of this. So, you come\ninto here, and it's, it's, it's tailor made for a clash. Okay? It\u2014",
        "Q: What did you want though? As you're running the camp, but you're also, you're Jewish,\nand as you said, you understand that these fresh arrivals could be fleeing persecution in a\nplace like Poland. So, what do you want?",
        "A: Well, I want more camps. I mean it's no, no big deal. Okay? Let me, I want to address\nthis. In Germany, at approximately the time I was there, there were a few, there were\nbetween 90 and 100,000 displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons. Of these, about\n65,000 lived in camps and 25,000 lived outside of camps. In June of '46, which is\ntowards the end of my stay, with the Army now for months ranting and raving about the\ninfiltrees, don't give any \u2014 incidentally, I wasn't the only camp director or staff protesting\nthese things. The, the UNRRA people in other places were also, we used to get together\nand organize group protests against some of this \u2014 but, in the middle of June, there's a\npogrom in Poland, in Kielce \u2014 40 Jews are killed. I think in the next year, after I left,\nanother 100,000 came. These are meaningless figures when you talking, when you're\ntalking 6,000,000 dead, and 100,000 in Germany. Equivalent to one and a half percent.\nAnd if you have another 100,000, it's two-thirds of one percent, I think, if I'm doing the,\nno, it's two, two over 60, yeah, it's, no, it's two and a half percent. I mean \u2014 the proportion\nbetween what's happened here and the number of survivors, the ratios, makes the \u2014 you\nshould want more survivors rather than less. And the political system worldwide has to\nadjust to that reality. And here we are, a year after the end of the war, and these people\nare still homeless, without fresh food, I have in one of my memos an indication of some\nofficer in some group situation, in a court or something, suddenly arrests a Jew who's\nthere. And he later says he wanted to show the Germans that he was disciplining\nsomeone.",
        "Q: We need to change tapes.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: Okay, I can't find that particular, maybe on the next break, I'll, I'll find it. Yeah.",
        "Q: What we were just talking about, obviously, there's frustration in your voice about the\nsituation and I did read some other journalistic reports commenting that people a year\nafter the end of the war, a year after liberation, that people were living in very cramped\nquarters, that had echoes of concentration camps \u2014 obviously they were worse. Could you\njust talk a little more about that frustration. What would you have liked to have seen\nhappening that you could not provide?",
        "A: Well, you see, given the camp itself, which did not have individual kitchens \u2014 though\ngradually, people got cookers and things like that \u2014 I would have wanted them to move\ninto the German market and get fresh food a year after the end, the war\u2019s ended. What are\nwe getting GI issue for? I would have preferred that they keep looking for more housing\nfacilities. So, in a room, in the large room, of the houses, of the houses, which could be\nthe equivalent of about 350 square feet, which is smaller than 20 by 20, we could have as\nmany as 15 to 20 people living. Four or five families in double-decker cots. Families\nseparating themselves from other families by hanging blankets from the ceiling \u2014\nincluding some single individuals living in the middle of family \u2014 and people, and so on,\nand children and so on. They should have gotten more housing. Reduced the population\nof the camp to, to 2,000 from 4,000, let's say. And the food was a problem. But they,\nbasically, sometimes in a memo here and there you'll see, there are understandable\nhumanitarian reasons, but then they go on to forget that they uttered that word. And it's a\ncompletely, it was a completely different outlook.\nYou see, you also have to remember, Katie, that the GI\u2019s were fraternizing with German\ngirls and German women \u2014 widespread, extensive. The German types were more\ngemiitlich*\u00ae to them than the Jewish survivor girls and women, who were Eastern\nEuropean. So, during the day you're out 1n the field and at night you're with a German\nFraulein\u2019. I can't tell you whether it's 100 percent of the soldiers or 99 percent that so\nengaged. But, and the officers, I mean, when I was running \u2014 when I was in military\ngovernment, organizing and running that venereal disease hospital, a couple of officers\nfrom some nearby battalion, got in touch with my captain asking him to release a certain\nwoman who was their girlfriend, or one of their girlfriends, I don't remember. And I had\nto stand up to this at the time, to the captain, he \u2014 turns out he was a really wonderful\nguy, a lawyer from Florida and say, \"We can't do it. She's got to stay inside the hospital.\"\nBut, here these schmucks are bringing pressure on us to release a woman with venereal\n78 genial (German)\n*\u00b0 young woman (German)\ndisease because she's one of their girlfriends. So, this was very extensive. And, I guess,\nthe way in which I've developed temperamentally over the years, because I was a, a, what\ndo you call it, a fast achiever, a young achiever, is fundamentally, I don\u2019t suffer fools\neasily or kindly. I, I have too much experience in extremely difficult situations. I know, I\nhave confidence in my own sense of fairness and my own sense of integrity that, as\nanyone who has worked with me over the years knows, some of these truths about me,\nand I know them.\nAnd so, when I get this kind of stuff \u2014 as my own confidence builds \u2014 I get more and\nmore indignant. Maybe I was too young to be politic about some of my reactions, though,\nI don't think it was too much. There was one incidence described in the charges against\nme that I \u2014 that this officer says to me, something that they can\u2019t do better on housing for\nthe DP\u2019s than they do for the GI\u2019s. And his \u2014 and I did this \u2014 the, the charges in front of a\nfew enlisted men \u2014 and the claim is that I said to him, \"Fuck the GI\u2019s, I'm only worried\nabout the DP\u2019s\" Now, later I go and I rendezvous with this officer, and I discuss the\nsituation with him. And he denies that there were any enlisted men in the vicinity, in our\nvicinity when we had that conversation. And he also agrees that the essence of our\nconversation was that the GI\u2019s are young men, they're trained to live under very difficult\nand trying conditions, so it won't be terrible, it wouldn't be terrible if you didn't have\nquite appropriate housing for them. But, here you're dealing with survivors from\nconcentration camps that have suffered so, who aren't trained for this kind of thing, who\nare families, children, wives. You can\u2019t make a comparison between what you do for the\nGI\u2019s and what you do for the DP\u2019s. So, in effect, that conversation gets turned around as\na charge of my being uncooperative, using disrespectful language, etc.",
        "Q: I want to go back, just before we move into that and ask you: You were beginning to\ndescribe an atmosphere among a lot of the GI\u2019s that they essentially sympathized, I think\nthis is what you were saying, more with the German people in a way, than they did with\nthe people you were working with, displaced persons, the raggedy looking person coming\nfrom Poland.",
        "A: Katie, in the \u2014 in some of the material you have, I have, I have, I have inserted certain\nquotations from official documents that I have found in the Holo \u2014 in the National\nArchives. Which is critical of the Jewish DP\u2019s. \"They flaunt themselves in front of the\nGerman police who they know can\u2019t do anything about them. And they do various things\nwhich will incur the wrath of the German population and which will encourage them to\nfeel that Hitler after all was right.\" Now, that's an American officer writing that sentence\nin 1946.",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing things that, or feeling that tone, or witnessing something like\nthat?",
        "A: I, I, well...",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing things like that, or feeling that tone, or witnessing something\nlike that?",
        "A: Well, I'm not sure that I heard those words, but I'm sure I heard things like it, and I've\nwitnessed various.... Look, look at the other thing that \u2014 another, another \u2014 we haven't\ncovered the famous riot. Well, I should precede this \u2014 though I'll come back to it \u2014 with a\nlittle bit of an outline, just so it's put into time context. I send the cable to the U.S. on the\nfood situation, \"stir up the bees,\" April 12th. Within one week to the day after that, the\nbattalion commander arrives for a five day intensive inspection. There has never been a\nfive day intensive inspection. They come for a few hours here, here they drop in, send\nsomeone else. Five days of inspection. That's undertaken on the 19th of April. And, let's\nsay it. goes 'til the 24th of April. From my memorandum, I can see, tell, that there's a very\nactive period from about May the ninth to May the 14th in which the Army 1s asking for\nmy head. With all these different charges on Zionism and so on and so forth.\nI should add, unrelated to me and unrelated to Fohrenwald, on about May the ninth,\nthere's riot in the camp at Landsberg. There's also a riot in another place, I think,\nStarnberg or something. Then on the evening of May 22nd, it's a Friday night, most \u2014 I\nand most of my team at our billets in Wolfratshausen the weekend is beginning. And,\nafter dinner we start getting messages on the phone, there's trouble here, there's trouble\nthis, someone is reported hurt at the German movie theater in Wolfratshausen. We send\nsomeone out to look at it, no trouble at the movie theater at Wolfratshausen. Then, at\nsome point, I see somebody in the car area of the house, gesticulating and so on. And, he\nsays there's trouble here, there's trouble there, I don't quite know what it all 1s, but what I\ndo at that juncture \u2014 1s I instruct two of our staff to stay at the billets in case there are\nanymore phone calls \u2014 I take two people with me. I'm going to the German police station\nto find out what's going on. I send the rest of the staff to the camp to see what's going on\nthere. OK? And here is what we discovered \u2014 and I'll tell you what this 1s, what this brief\nsummary is based on \u2014 the following morning I instructed every staff member, let's say\n20, 22, to prepare for me a chronological report of the night before, where they were a\ncertain hour, give me a half hour later, half hour later, and tell me what was going on.\nWherever they were. So I have a series of these memos which give me a panoramic view\nof the situation. And here is what happened \u2014 the sense of what happened. The essence of\nwhat happened. It's a Friday night, a couple of drunken American soldiers are going up\nthe stairs of a building in the German village. They're going to the third floor where\nthey've got a couple of girlfriends. On the second floor is a Jewish family that's living\noutside of the camp. They have some friends who are visiting them from the camp, there\nmay have been four or five people there, I don't know, remember. The American soldiers\nstop off at the second floor. And they start coercing the people, they move around with\ntheir knives or bayonets. They have their guns out. They're telling one guy to play his\nharmonica. They're asking, \"Are you Jewish? Are you Jewish? I don't like Jews,\" he says,\nand he rams one guy in the chin with the butt of a gun. Hits another guy in the head. One\nor two of these people got out of the apartment and got back to the camp. There are some\n1,000 or more people in the camp theater watching a movie in the blackness, in the\ndarkness. And one of them runs into the back of the theater, into the darkness, and he\nstarts yelling, \u201cA shchita!*\u00b0\u201d \u201cslaughter\u201d \u2014 this is the classic phrase \u2014 \u201cMe harget yiddin\nin Wolfratshausen!?'\" slaughter, they're killing Jews in Wolfratshausen.\" And the group\ngets up. Now, then other rumors start. As people are moving towards the exit, that a Jew\nwas seen kidnapped by Germans in a truck travelling south. So, people commandeer\ntrucks and they start chasing something. They start stopping vehicles, passing and taking\nGermans out and beating them up. Some start moving north. I go to the German police\nstation and I meet an Army officer there, and I tell him, we start piecing it together. I tell\nhim, \"Look, you put your soldiers a mile or three-quarters of a mile north of the camp.\nGive me a chance to contain whatever is going on.\" And, at that point, I get back to the\ncamp, and by that point, my staff and the DP, the DP police are, have a cordon and are\ngetting them back. And then we have a midnight curfew, everybody off the streets. The\nofficial report on this incident, which I find in the National Archives, I didn\u2019t know that\nthis existed at that time, describes the riot and indicates that there is evidence to indicate\nthat this riot was generated by, or in behalf of, Mr. Cohen the camp director. And there is\nno reference in his report to the American soldiers. Okay? So, what am I supposed to do?\nPassive, \"bleh, bleh.\" But, but, this riot, you see, follows by 12 to 15 days, the Army\neffort to get rid of me. So, when the riot occurs, this officer who's writing the report, is\nlinking it to the Army strategy to get rid of this uncooperative son-of-a-bitch, Henry\nCohen. Now, from my point of view, the riot and the story, you know, some of it, beating\nup the innocent Germans. I cry inside, but for me it's a symptom of how close to the edge\nthe pain still is, a year after liberation. Remember, May 22nd, the war ended May eighth\na year earlier. For me it's a sign of how close to the edge. The riot in Landsberg, the riot\nhere, the riot there. Our people are suffering. Look where they're living, look what they're\neating. Look how they're being treated. And they're living among Germans.\nAnd the Army, at that level, has absolutely no grasp, no empathy, no understanding of\nthis. It's, it's, it's unbelievable, I can't, I indicated in that memo, here we are 50 years later,\nand I can't comprehend of that Army attitude. I can't comprehend it. I mean, I, I, I'm a\nsoldier, I understand law and order, I understand discipline, I understand all those things.\nBut, for such stupid, biased, inadequate people to be running the occupation. One worries\nabout, one has to worry about a lot of other things that happen under their tutelage. See,\nit's not my combat experience where I question Army orders or anything, I feel proud to\n3\u00b0 slaughter (Yiddish)\n3! They are killing Jews in Wolfratshausen (Yiddish)\nhave been a combat soldier. Fifty years later I am proud that I was able to do that, that I\nfought in the war. What makes me sink into the ground is the American soldier at peace.\nAnd lacking, it's, it's quite possible it's different in today's Army than it was then, I don't\nknow enough about what \u2014 how they handle Haiti or Somalia, not Somalia, at Somalia\nwasn't that great. There's no seykhel*\u201d, intelligence, subtlety at work, you see. You see, in\nsome of the stuff you've read where Margaret Gerber is talking about my personal\nqualities, one of the things that she's saying is that the DP's trust him even when he comes\ndown on them, they know what's at his soul level. And they will take it when he's harsh\nwith them. And these guys don't have it at the soul level.",
        "Q: So many questions. Let me ask, we're talking about a year after liberation, and, and\ncertainly memories often surface around anniversaries. I wonder what kind of airing did\nthose emotions ever get? Any kind of formal way? Was there counseling? Were there\nsome kind of communal sessions where people were able to pray about the end of the\nwar? What did go on in terms of letting people get some of this out?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t \u2014 yeah, I don't know to what extent, we had a lot of social workers on the\nstaff. And, so, I don't know to what extent. You know, now we make much more to do\nabout group therapy and group process and all of that.\nBut, but, I don't have any easy visualization of it, Katie. I keep struggling with my\nwriting class as I did in certain respects with Lustig*\u2019 or with you, you'll see that, the\nwriting part is what I'm saying. I want more than the facts, Ma\u2019am, and I stay with the\nfacts. You see, where I can't tell you anything from memory, I won't, I won't speak on it.\nI can only speak on that which I can draw. If I don't remember, then I can only speak on\nthat which I can draw from my quote, unquote, \"factual materials\". And I, I, I frustrate\npeople like you no end.",
        "Q: I'm not frustrated. Actually, you've intrigued and tantalized, that's all. One story I'd like\nyou to tell us, and perhaps it actually in some way, does answer my question for one\nperson, is the story of the young girl who insisted on singing to a group of your visitors. I\nwonder if you could tell us\u2014",
        "A: Well, one of the therapeutic things that was happening all the time were visitors. Rabbi\nHerzog\u201d, the chief rabbi of Palestine. Writers, singers, the Anglo-American Commission,\nthey come and they spend a day and they're giving people some hope that maybe they can\nhave an impact on something. If LaGuardia* sends Ira A. Hirschmann as an emissary to\nlook over things, people get hope from that. So there was a lot, a constant stream of\n>? sense, intelligence (Yiddish)\n3 Arnost Lustig\n+4 Rabbi Isaac (Yizhak) Herzog\n3\u00b0 Fiorello H. LaGuardia\nvisitors. On this particular occasion, we were visited by H. Leivik*\u00b0, a writer-poet, and\nEmma Schaver\u2019\u2019 who is a singer from Detroit.\nAnd we put on a concert, a program for a couple of evenings, and that also is lovely.\nAnyway, following the \u2014 at the end of the visit, the morning that they were leaving,\nLeivik and Schaver are having breakfast and a young girl comes in. And she walks over\nto their table and she says, \"I want to sing to you.\" And Leivik says, \"What do you mean\nsing? Do you write songs?\" And she says, \"No, I sing.\" He says, \"You know we are in a\nhurry, we are doing another camp.\" She says, \"Well, you'll come a little later.\" And\nLeivik says to her, \u201cWho are you, where are you from? Are you alone? Is anyone here\nwith you?\" She gave up on him, she goes against the wall, and she introduces the song\nshe's going to sing, the Shavler, the song of the Shavler ghetto. And it's a song about a\nmother who has to give her child away in order to save the child. It's a very sad song.\nAnd then she sings other songs. And then she's asked \u2014 then they do ask her some\nquestions about herself, and she says where she's from, she lost her whole family, she's\nall alone, she's now 15, 16, she's been to 17 concentration camps, when she was released\nshe went to a city, she developed typhus fever there and she gradually worked her way\nwest to camp Fohrenwald, and then she sings some more. And Leivik danced, Schaver \u2014\nyou know, and this is one of the experiences of their lives. For them to unanticipatedly\ncome across this. Then they come in \u2014 they're leaving \u2014 they come into my office, there\nare two women sitting in front of my desk complaining about the food, and I say to them,\n\"Look, I'm trying whatever I can do to make it better,\" and they say good-bye. Leivik, in\nleaving, says to Emma Schaver, \"He's telling them he's trying to make it better, but he\nprobably doesn't believe that himself, that he'll be able to.\"\nEnd of Tape #5\n36 Halpern Leivik\n37 Emma Lazaroff Schaver\nTape #6",
        "Q: The young girl who sang to the visitors, tell us little bit more about her song she sang.\nDid you ever hear her sing it afterwards?",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "Q: Did you ever meet her?",
        "A: I don't remember. Probably did, but I don't really remember. The \u2014 [interviewee reads\nfrom notes] \"it's the song of a Jewish, the pain of a Jewish child whose mother has to give\nher away to non-Jews in order to save her from the fire. The song is full of endless pain.\"\nAnd the \u2014 let me \u2014 on a side thing just, you know, sort of an interesting difference in\nperspective, while I take in things largely macro with incidents satisfying my macro I\ndon't focus on macro, micra. I focus on macra \u2014 the task at hand, one way or another.\nAnd, what was I coming to? It slips me. I wanted to say something to you about that....\nOh, yes! When I was leaving the camp, I let word out that if anybody wanted to write\nletters to relatives in the United States, I would take them with me and I would stamp\nthem in New York. So, I had, I came back with hundreds of letters and many of them\nwere not sealed, so I took the liberty of reading some of these letters. Not a single letter,\nthat I read, was talking about me or camp administration.\nEvery letter was micro; what was happening to me, family, who\u2019s this, that, so on.\nCompletely different perspective. So, I recognized all these years that often, what I may\ndo, what I think is for the public good, the people for whose good it is are oblivious to\nwhat I am doing. They live in their own little worlds. In my career as a university dean\nand students, the same thing applies. The students are in their little thing. They're not\nconcerned with the dean, if they happen to be somewhere where the dean shows up, they\nget up and they'll shake hands with him. Or if I phone somebody and he knows it's me, its\na respectful response, but basically, those are different worlds. And I'm aware of that.",
        "Q: Tell us what it was like on your level, on the macro level, on a day-to-day basis. What\nwould happen in that camp? When would you get to work? What was the rhythm about\nthat camp which sounds like it was some sort of small town?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, for one thing, one of the things in the memos that I get, is, and the district\ndirector refers to this at considerable length, how we were probably the most visited\nJewish DP camp in the zone. He was using that as an argument to tell the military about\nhow much distraction I had to cope with from task. But we were getting, we were getting\nvisitors \u2014 I don\u2019t know if every day, I can't remember, I have no calendars from that\nperiod of time, but an awful, a tremendous flow of people coming in and out.\nMilitary, one sort or another, the medical officer of the battalion going to visit the\nhospital, or this guy coming. Jewish leaders coming; rabbi, other rabbis coming, so, a lot\nof the pictures of that \u2014 I should say this, a lot of the pictures that you see at the\nHolocaust Museum and the ones that I have, are not really pictures of every day life or,\nand/or suffering, they are largely celebratory pictures; the Macabbi** games, the theatre\nperformances, the visit of the General, the visit of Rabbi Herzog, that is, they're, they are\nthe pictures are not really a representation of daily life in the camp. But, basically, I don't\nknow what time I got there, you know, eight-thirty or nine o'clock, presumably, we had\nbreakfast at our billet. Could have been one or another staff meeting, meeting with\ndifferent people, you know, you're supervising 20 people, you have the hospital, you're\nhaving group meetings, you're going out to look at this or that. Occasionally, you have to\ngo to Munich to check in or to district headquarters. I used to on occasion, visit the house\nwhere the district staff lived and have dinner there. It was an easy way, or an easy\nevening to compare notes on one thing or another. Also, there's a constant flow of\nadministrative directives that are coming in. Food, clothing, transportation. There's a lot\nof bread and butter stuff that goes on. And, incidentally, there are times when, among\nvisitors of the camp, I have pictures from Catholic charities coming with supplies and\nfood. So, they were also helping out. And then there are celebratory events. Pesach*\u201d\ncomes, you have to organize a Seder and there's a flag raising ceremony at\nHochlandslager, and who should be invited and meetings with the camp committee, in\ngroups or individually, the chairman of the camp committee who, incidentally, was a\nwonderful man. I used to always see him when I went to Israel. He passed away\nprematurely. He was, he became a high school principal in Israel. And I still see,\nincidentally, the two surviving members of the Jewish Agency staff in Israel when I go.\nAnd they're now in their 80s. And there's Amram who lives in New York, he's in the\ntravel business.",
        "Q: His name 1s?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: His name 1s?",
        "A: Amram Zur, Z-U-R and\u2014",
        "Q: Can you tell us about\u2014\n38 Maccabi World Union\n\u00b0 Passover",
        "A: Let me, I want to tell you just as a by, something happened a year, two years? Two years\nago. The two survivors in Israel, Zviah Lahar, who is a nurse, and she became the chief\nof nursing for the \u2014 one of the major kibbutz movements. She's now retired. And she lost\nher first husband in the Jewish Brigade during the war. And then she married a man, I\nforget his first name, Lahar and they live in Kibbutz Givat Brenner in Israel. And the\nother person is Liowa Lak who is really the chief of the team and a very wonderful man.\nAnd he, along the way, worked with Goldie, Golda Meir when she was in Russia and he\nwas helping develop contacts with the surviving Jewish community in Russia. Then he\nworked with some agricultural technical agency and so on. Two years ago, following the\nHebron Massacre, there's a message on my telephone from Zviah, I get back to her, and\nZviah is in tears about what happened. And she's calling me incoherently, \"Henry, come\nhelp.\" I mean, there was no logic to it. But it says something about our relationship.\n\u201cCome help, help.\" That says was that something about the sense of suffering she was\nexperiencing as a result of that massacre. And these are people who were lost in the war\nand on. And, you know, you experience what we \u2014 1.e. what Israel is now Lebanon \u2014 and\nmost of the world does not understand the complexity of that are at work here, in terms of\n\u2014 but I also, while I'm on that, let me before we were on camera, about Lustig saying to\nme, in an interview 15 years ago, \u201cYou know, Jews live in a camp. They go from\nconcentration camp or a, a camp in Germany, and then en route to Palestine, the British\nget them into camps in Cyprus. From camp to camp to camp.\" And I was thinking about\nit last discussion I heard about the choices between Peres*? and Netanyahu*! \u2014 Likud*\u2019\nLabor*? \u2014 that if the Israelis elect Peres, they will be electing a leader who because they,\nif they agree with him, will work to remove the walls of the camp Israel.\nAnd if they elect Netanyahu, they will elect a leader who builds the walls of the camp. So\nwe are still struggling with the camp metaphor, from camp to camp to camp. And I. think\nyou know where my feelings are. But, I've got to be non-political, 'cause I'm not a\nmember of any Zionist organization.",
        "Q: What was your feeling when you were managing that camp? Did you have liked it to\nessentially disappear as you managed it? Or did you see it as a kind of, still a very\nnecessary refuge? Even though it had all these problems?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, of course, simply put, for me, the solution was that, hopefully, there would\nbe developed a state in Israel. I didn't know by what name. That all the refugees and DP\u2019s\n*\u00b0 Shimon Peres\n\u201c! Benjamin Netanyahu\n* Union (Hebrew); Israeli parliamentary bloc.\n3 Mifleget Po\u2019alei Eretz Israel\nwould go there and the camps would dissolve. I, you know, I saw some going to\nAmerica, some going to Australia, where there were relatives, and so on and so forth.\nBut, to me, the bulk would be going to Israel. There was a poll taken in the Spring of\n1946 by the Anglo-American Committee\u201d, this is from their report, they \u2014 I think this is\npart of the poll, [interviewee reads from notes] \"In our camp the vote for going to Israel\nwas about 90 percent or more. Zone-wide, 70 percent wished to go to Palestine.\" So, that\nwas the overwhelming desire at that time. I should add that Fohrenwald was actually the\nlast camp closed in Germany in about 1954. At some point in the process, I didn't keep up\nwith it, UNRRA went out of business, was taken over by the International Refugee\nOrganization.\nBut, then it was turned over to the American Joint Distribution Committee and as they\nclosed other centers, they brought surplus into Fohrenwald. And then it was closed,\nfinally, in something like 1954.",
        "Q: Did you ever get the sense that people got attached to it, even with its problems, because,\nafter all, it was a sort of safe haven? It was home?",
        "A: I don't, no, I never, never got that feeling. I think people felt some element of safety there\nbecause on UNRRA, because of the Jewish Agency. There were also occasionally people\naround from the Jewish Brigade \u2014 which 1s a separate, I don't have much on it, because I\ndidn't know much about it \u2014 but, remember, they were being organized in kibbutzim,\nthere was Hochlandslager, so there were, there were organizational structures that were\nproviding some protection for people there that \u2014 and to that extent, it probably had a\nwholesome effect. I mean, if, you've seen the picture from the Maccabi games, have you?\nI mean, God, this is a year after the war, and you see these young people doing these\nacrobatics and exercises, it's nothing short of amazing. Well that's morale building\nactivity.",
        "Q: What was your sense of what was going on within the people in the camp? Were they\nrecreating their lives in their previous homes and villages? Or were they creating some\nnew type of life that they hoped would be their life in the future and in a future state?",
        "A: I think that Fohrenwald was a completely interim matter. I know this from my own\nrelatives. I know this from other people whom I've known. They came to Israel, they\nbecame part of that country and either went to kibbutzims, stayed in Tel Aviv, went to\nJerusalem. If they were religious, they went to Ben\u00e9 Beraq you know? They were like\nimmigrants in any country, there was a period of adaptation and absorption. And\nFohrenwald is a passing experience, about which they may have some benign\n\u201c4 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine\nremembrance or not. Like this young woman, it, for some reason it \u2014 in her life it figures\nvery importantly.",
        "Q: The young woman you've been writing to?",
        "A: On the computer, yeah. The man who's in Los Angeles, I've had one or two exchanges\nwith him, but he hasn't felt the need to go further, so, you know, it's a very variable thing.\nI should also say that I and others who returned were writing articles about this\nexperience for three or four years after we returned. And giving speeches at different\nJewish, or other, organizations, so we were sharing our experiences then in different\nways. What\u2019s, what I find interesting now from a few friends, and I don't know to what\nextent it's reflective, but a few friend whom \u2014 to whom I've sent the speech I gave a year\nago in Great Neck, have written me saying they've shared it with their children. That 1s,\npeople in my age group have a strong need to share these experiences with our children.\nSo, they used my experience which 1s reflective of their life to a certain extent, to share it\nwith the children.",
        "Q: Have you shared this with your children?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. And, I haven't had much feedback from them. They, they haven't\nverbalized feedback.",
        "Q: Tell us about the first Seder at the camp when you were in charge. It might have been the\nfirst Seder after liberation.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Would you tell us about that \u2014 what did it look like?",
        "A: Well, we had, I don't remember the dining room area, but we had long tables all decked\nout. I don't remember who led the service. I have pictures of me with different people\nthere, including members of the team; Chaim Hoffman, who was the head of the Jewish\nAgency in Munich, was at our Seder. And, we fed them gefilte fish as far as I can recall.\nWhere we got some of the food to feed them, I don't know, I didn't ask. And there were\nArmy people there and I don't think they knew what the hell they were eating, so they\nprobably thought it was GI food also. That is, a piece of gefilte fish to them was like a\ncan of K-rations.\nThey'd never had it before, it was from some other can. Maybe they were even happy to\nhave never have had it before. But it was a very buoyant, very friendly, very lively\noccasion. And I don't remember who had the afikomen, I don't know who stole it or\nfound it, I don't remember any of that. But, we, you know, I see pictures which show\nthese group dinners, different celebratory dinners. And though, that is, our commitment\nwas to do positive things to raise morale. And we did a lot of it. You know, I don't like\nthese traumatic stories \u2014 to, to bury, the fact 1s we had hundreds of children in schools\nand teachers teaching children. We had a Yeshiva. Oh, and I came across an article,\nwhere \u2014 of Leivik's \u2014 where he devotes a piece of it to going into the Yeshiva in\nFohrenwald and it reminds him of his childhood. So, we had that going here. So, there\nwas a lot of things.",
        "Q: A question that I didn't get to ask about just day-to-day living and you were describing\nthe rooms being so small and privacy. How were married couples able to be intimate? I\nmean, how, what, do you know anything about that? Or how did people make do?",
        "A: I have deniability. No, but look, let's face it, Katie, I told you the story about my father as\na six year old boy. His mother has died, his father is remarried, he has a stepmother who\nhas two young children and he's occasionally awakened by some noise in the middle of\nthe night. And in the candle light he sees this stepmother feeding her children.\nNow, that's a guess to me, that he lived in very close quarters. So, he was experiencing in\n1897, sex among adults at night. So, I think that a lot of these people who came from\nshtetlach, really had that as part of their background. I, I've never talked to any of them\nabout it. But, it's an interesting question and it\u2019s an interesting issue. But, I think it was\nprobably going on all the time and, not only with the children hearing it, but unrelated\npeople were hearing it. For us in America, it's quite a strange kind of experience, but,\nwhen you live \u2014 what do you think Indians did in a teepee, or Italians in their little\nhovels? I think that was the world before we began building houses with more than 1,500\nsquare feet. And apartments with more, with four rooms.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: Now, give me a minute. Hi. This is a list from \u2014 of the camp that I have which lists all the\naspects of the camp and in some, in the top group, next to each, almost every line, I have\nthe staff assignments. So, [interviewee reads from notes] \"Number one, overall,\nadministration. Coordination of staff, Cohen. Personnel actions for staff, including\nvoluntary agencies, Gerber and Hafkin.\" Hafkin was my secretary, Gerber was assistant\ndirector. \"Administration of DP\u2019s in the Landkreis, \" outside of the camp, \"Oksny, \"\nwho's the Norwegian woman. \"Public relations, Cohen, Gerber, Hafkin, Robins,\" who\nwas another assistant director. \"Total space requirements for,\" I'll stop reading names,\n\"for billeting of staff for DP\u2019s, other accommodations; warehousing, laundry, etc. Sub-\ncenters; Hochlandslager,\" which was for the kibbutzim, \"and Dorfen,\" I think that was\nsome kind of sanitarium. Then \"police court, organization of street officers, registration,\nadministrative information, delegated to welfare, reports and statistics.\" Then next major\nheading, \"Physical plant; equipment, water, sewage, electrical facilities, heating,\nbuilding, equipment maintenance, road repair, radio, telephones, sign painting, etc.\ngardens.\" Once you read it, you realize what goes into this. Even, even I'm impressed.\n\"Welfare, information and tracing, group work, recreation, cultural activities, education,\nadult, children, library, religions, newspaper and radio, vocational training, religious\naffairs, child welfare, family welfare, case work including psychological, home visiting,\nhospital welfare inch, including occupied therapy.\" I don't know whether that's a typo.\n\"Employment, DP\u2019s in the Landkreis, amenity supply distribution, gardens, immigration,\nrep, supply, securing requirements from staff, uncover new sources of supply, supplies,\nreport on incoming supplies, recreation, requisitions submitted, 1tems surplus materials,\nsuggest possible uses, wooden thing.\" I don't know what \"Warehouse, storage of\nsupplies.\"\n\"Centralization of supply storage, physical distribution in case of food \u2014 bulk only,\ndetermine method and timing of distribution, periodic listing of inventories, no\nresponsible for Joint unless submitted to common pool, Joint Distribution Committee,\nhealth, sanitation, hospital, Dorfen, \" which is a sanitarrum. \"Hochlandslager, dispensary,\nsanitary inspections of kitchens, general kosher kibbutz, homes, food magazines.\" That\nmust mean food storage, not a magazine. \"Special diets; sick, undernourished children,\npregnant mothers. Street cleaning, sanitation committee, gardens, parent counseling on\nrearing babies, sex education, health education. Messing foods; planning means\npreparation of food, serving of food, cleanliness of kitchen, security of food in\npreparation. Transportation; providing vehicles as needed, allocating use of vehicles,\nsecuring vehicles as needed, keeping vehicles in repair, allocation of gasoline.",
        "Q: Want to hold until those sirens pass? You were running a town.",
        "A: Yeah. Incidentally, I have other handwritten notes. \"Food; conditions under which\nserved, no fresh food, compare to Germans. Black market; Hochlandslager cigarettes\nwhat roll do they play in the black market? Engineering supplies; brushes, roof paper,\nnails, toilets.\" This is a little more detail than there. \"Medical supplies;\" I think it says\n\"hormones, amenity supplies, obstetrical, requisitioning procedures, teeth.\" We'd have\nproblems with dentists. \"Sanitation supplies, housing, density, morality.\" You see? That\nmeans it went through my head. \"Lack of community space, Landkreis responsibilities,\"\nthat's the county burden, \"no clear cut definition. Clothing; sizes, U.S. clothing.\nEmployment; no incentive. Police work; extra territoriality. Abnormality requires\nintelligent rehabilitation programs. Staff billeting and moral.\"\n\"No place to go to relax. Army relations; some soldiers do not understand the almost\ninevitable and natural clash of interests and resent it. Riot, their demand for my removal,\ntransportation, encourage a system of scrounging.\" [interviewee ceases reading] So there\nare these recurrent things, Katie. I, I wanted to mention something, when all of this\ntrouble was developing, a number of us began to become concerned with one of the\nmembers of the team, a Dutch woman. Her name was Maria Van Bimbergen. She was\nsupposedly the daughter of the chief justice of Holland before the war. She had \u2014 as far as\nI know, was the only one, one the team among the women, who had an Army officer\nfriend, boyfriend fraternizing. And, as the charges kept flowing, particularly on some of\nthe more confidential issues, we began worrying about her reliability. And we began\ncomplaining to Headquarters about her. And I notice in the memos that it's in my memo,\nand I think reference to her is also in Margaret Gerber's memo to the District director.\nAnd I came across something which refers to her at a certain date, seeing her walking in\nWolfratshausen with this Army lieutenant or colonel or whatever. So, we, this was a great\nsource of concern to us. And UNRRA didn't act on it, and that was a source of concern to\nme.",
        "Q: That's interesting because in thinking about speaking with you, I know I'd hear about\nwhat this situation camp was \u2014 but I guess I didn\u2019t really anticipate hearing that you\nwould have to fight for the people over the treatment of the people. In other words, that\nyou had to become, or you did become, an advocate. You had to choose sides in a way.\nDo you agree with that?",
        "A: Oh, no, I didn't see it as choosing sides. I mean, some of the things that I was doing was\nalmost measured choices, if you want to say down the middle. Like, my mid-\u2014 like my\nmidnight checks. Or the \u2014 three o'clock in the morning looking for a meat, for a butcher,\nonce a month or twice a month, which left them 28 other days.\nOr my encounter with Rabbi Halberstam in down the middle. That is, I\u2014 even with those\nthings \u2014 the Army was complaining like crazy about me. But I think, incidentally, if you\nwere \u2014 which you are not going to do really, but historians will, look at the files on some\nof the other camps. Whether or not they led to the removal of the director or not. You'll\nsee similar themes being played out. Because I have folders based on meetings we were\nhaving at headquarters where we were being briefed about not handing out cards and new\ncards. On how among us we were upset by it and protesting it and so on. So, I wasn't the\nonly one. And there was, for example, at Landsberg, you had older, older people in\ncharge with more experience, like Lee Srole*? who was chief welfare officer. And they\nwould get into the New York papers and Leon, what's his name, the head of the camp, so\nthis was going on different places.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel torn between your allegiance to the U.S. military and your allegiance to\nbeing a Jew \u2014 and the Jews in the camps?",
        "A: I never had that conflict. I just, it wasn't my allegiance to America that was at issue, it\nwas my refusal to deal with stupid people. Who happened to be American. I mean that\nwas never a problem for me. If I'm dealing with a \u2014 if you\u2019re dealing with one of these\ngun groups out in the west who raise the American flag and you protest against it, it isn't\nthat you\u2019re anti-American, you're against that mentality. So, I've never had that problem.\nAnd I'm not a radical, politically. I'm a centrist. So, I don't have any problem with that.",
        "Q: What was the most difficult thing about your job?",
        "A: I think when, when one comes down to it, the most difficult thing about it was dealing\nwith the U.S. Army of occupation. Dealing with the DP\u2019s wasn't as difficult. Dealing\nwith Rabbi Halberstam wasn't that difficult. I mean, you know, the riot was difficult, but\nit wasn't \u2014 I could understand it.\nAnd, I remember once, I don't know for what reason, the DP\u2019s went on a hunger strike\nprotesting something. I convened a big meeting in the auditorium, hundreds of people\nthere, and I, I set out to break the strike. And I say to them, \"Listen, I would rather be a\nteacher in Brooklyn than director of this camp.\" And they laugh and that breaks the\nstrike. That was the relationship I had with them. That was not difficult. I had, I had\nconfidence in my ability to deal with that. And they had confidence in me. I notice in the\nstuff around the Army effort to get rid of me, that there's a memo from Becky Althoff\nwho worked \u2014 there were two memos from Becky \u2014 she worked for the Joint, attached to\nthe team, and one is to Leo Schwarz, the head of Joint in Germany, to alert him to what\nwas going on up there and enlist him in the effort to offset the Army. And the second,\nwas talking about a small group meeting to plan a strategy, a group strategy, about\n* Leo Srole\nretaining me and protecting me. And that included Becky, some of the Jewish Agency\npeople and one or two other staff people. And then they had a large staff meeting the\nfollowing morning and they wrote someone wrote a petition or something, and there are\nlike 18 signatures on the petition. So, that was not my difficulty. My difficulty was this\nanomaly of being an infantry soldier in the 39th Regiment and confronting this problem\nwith those schmucks who have no understanding. I mean, look, one of these guys comes\non an inspection during Pesach. I guess it must have been that guy who came for five\ndays. And we walk into the kitchen. Now, the kitchen is closed for Pesach. They've been\ngiving rations in one way or another. And, I walk with him into the middle of the floor in\nthe kitchen it's empty and there's a pile of human defecation on the floor. And he, for\nhim, that's a sign of poor administration and poor sanitary control. We walk to the johns\nand there's defecation in the john on the floor, maybe on the toilet seat, I don't remember.\nWe go outside and behind there against the wall, there's some defecation. The stupid guy,\nhow does he think I feel about that? I understand how he's feeling about it. But he's not\ngiving a thought, that is he's not giving a thought that, if I had my way, if I had found it\ntwo hours earlier, we would have cleaned it up. But the place was out of use for two or\nthree days at the time. So, it happened. Nobody was going in there, so we didn't find it.\nYou know, I won't tell you the whole story of this, in 1961, I am in \u2014 I'm working with\nmy Mayor Wagner's office, I'm a senior management consultant on administration and\nI'm handling health, welfare, youth and so on. The Deputy Mayor calls me up \u2014 I won't\ngive you the whole story \u2014 gives me something, \"Take care of this.\" It's about Harlem\nhospital, conditions in the emergency room. I've been in the mayor's office then five to\nsix years, so I know what weight I have, okay? And I've been heavily involved for two\nyears in dealing with various problems of hospital administration. I call the Dean of the\nColumbia School of Public Health, whom I've been working with very closely for two\nyears, and I say, \"Help me out on this one, I'll rendezvous with you at the emergency\nroom at Harlem hospital.\" We go there, I won't detail what we find. At the end of the\nevening, 10 o'clock at night, nine o'clock at night, I call the Commissioner of Hospitals at\nhis home in Staten Island, and I tell him where I am, what I have found and what I am\ndoing, what I'm going to be doing about it immediately. And he raises his voice, \"What\nthe hell are you doing there? You're not Commissioner of Hospitals, etc., etc.\" I just say\nback to him, \"What the hell have you known about this? Have you acted on it? I'm acting\nbecause of dereliction.\" Anyway, over the weekend, we took care of the problem and\n[inaudible] I report to the Deputy Mayor on Monday -\"All taken care of.\" On\nWednesday, the Amsterdam News 60 comes out blasting us because it's a crazy paper,\nokay? Ten days later, the Mayor announces that he's promoting me to Deputy City\nAdministrator and 10 days after that, he's announcing that the Commissioner of Hospitals\nhas resigned and he's appointing the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health as\nCommissioner, okay?\nSo, I sort of know what heft and weight, and so on, 1s. I didn't know it all in 1946 in the\ncamp. But, there's something in me historically, my development, which has enabled me,\nnot that I don't take crap, but gives me some inner strength not to always put up with it.\nAnd that was what was involved here. Maybe I was too \u2014 whatever. But they were too \u2014\nworse, you see. And I should add that two to three weeks after I left the camp, there was\nanother riot situation, a march on the town, and one or two Jews were killed by the\nsoldiers because they wouldn't retreat. That is, when facing a gun, they went forward, not\nbackwards and we knew that. And we knew that we had to deal with them within the\nfamily so they didn't see us with guns. And they didn't see the Army with guns. And\nwhen they saw the guns, they got hurt. And I have newspaper clippings on that incident.\nSo, I'm satisfied it wasn't a personality matter. Now, I have a memo that Ira Hirschmann,\nwho was LaGuardia\u2019s emissary, Hirschmann had been a Senior Vice President in\ndepartment stores in the '30s. He must have helped raise money for LaGuardia, later they\nbecame very close. During the war, Roosevelt appointed him with some special\nAmbassadorial rank to be stationed in Turkey, and Hirschmann was arranging for the\nescape of Jews from Hungary and Bulgaria into Turkey.\nSo, he was, in his own way, an old hand. And LaGuardia sent him over, he wanted to get\nrid of General Morgan*\u00b0 because of the British influence on the European operation. And\nhe spent the day with me. And I quickly realized he was a guy I could trust and I get \u2014\nput it all out to him. And in his memo, which is in June, \"the Army is out to get Henry\nCohen.\" He starts out, \"Henry Cohen\" \u2014 this is something I didn't get until he came across\nit 1981, and he called me about it, that he had it \u2014 \"Henry Cohen, director, who appears to\nhave done a heroic job under impossible conditions is now under fire from the Army.\nThey made an investigation here, found the sanitary conditions unsatisfactory, which is\ncorrect, and in addition they felt that Mr. Cohen was pushing the welfare side too much,\nwas neglecting the other side for the rehabilitation of the people. A devastating report has\nbeen sent to Headquarters by General McBride*\u2019, Ninth Division Commander, and they\nhave asked for Mr. Cohen's removal. The staff has protested and the entire community\nhad a mass meeting, as, as the people have developed an affection for him and his\nunderstanding of the problem. Not like the U.S. Army. It was two days after this mass\nmeeting that a riot occurred at this camp. This is a concrete example of the Army bucking\nthe job of rescue, failing to support and permit people who understand the human side of\nthe problem to function\u2019. The people in the camp chose to go on a complete hunger strike\nunless Mr. Cohen was retained. He will probably be removed by the Army.\"",
        "Q: Ultimately, what did happen?\n*6 Sir Frederick Morgan\n*\u201d General Horace Logan McBride",
        "A: I don't know the answer to that, Katie. What I find in my material, is a letter of\nresignation dated sometime in May, and it's a two or three page letter, and on top of it, it's\nmarked \"void.\" Then, I also note, these cables the, I mentioned to you, from Samuel,\nProfessor Samuel Joseph, Chairman of the Sociology Department, at City College,\noffering me a teaching post in September \u2014 \"Reply in by Wednesday.\" I don't remember,\nI have no indication of how I handled that.",
        "A: .. very little in my records during the month of June, all the action seems to have been in\nMay. Very little in my records \u2014 yeah, all '46. Very little in my records, other than the\nHirschmann memo, which is something like June 10th, but then, I notice a cable dated\nJune 26th from Professor Samuel Joseph, City College. \"Are you planning to return\nshortly? Have two or three courses open. Will hold up until you cable me.\" Then, in a\nmore detailed cable without a date that I can't recognize \u2014 I have the real cable, but I can't\nread the date he sent to my brother who was in Munich, nearby. In which he actually\noutlines which courses and where and what days, \"must have your answer by Wednesday\nmorning for program printing, regards.\" Alright. Let's say it's the same day, June 26th.\nJune has 30 days, 44 days. Then, I have July 10th \u2014 sorry, July 2nd, six days later,\nresignation from UNRRA. Now-",
        "Q: Your resignation?",
        "A: My resignation. A very brief memo. \"I should like to inform you of my decision to resign\nfrom UNRRA, and am herewith giving one month's notice. According to our discussion\ntoday, this decision is a tentative one.\" And I don\u2019t understand that. \"However, I want all\nsteps to be taken so that in case I finally and definitely do decide to resign after a short,\"\nsomething or other, \"there will be no delay in departure.\" Okay?",
        "Q: Sir, we need you to sit up.",
        "A: Yeah, on July 15th, which is roughly two weeks later, there's a memo which indicates\nthat I've left the camp and I'm now reporting directly at Headquarters. And on that same\nday, July 15th, I go off for seven days of annual leave to Scandinavia. And I had a\nmarvelous time. And in Stockholm, I visited relatives of one of my father\u2019s closest\nfriends. It was marvelous. I'd never been to Scandinavia before. Anyway, so I'm back\nroughly the 22nd, 23rd. My resignation is effective on August fourth. And on August\nfourth I am issued, and I think I initiate, travel authorization from Munich to Washington\nvia London. But now I'm going to give you a treat that you weren't expecting. In Paris, I\narrived for a few days en route, and, and aunt of mine had sent me the name and address\nof a cousin in Paris.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8\nSo, I go to this address and I find this Sheftel cousin running a butcher shop. And, oh,\nwas that a wonderful experience. And she has three chil\u2014 young children. They survived\nthe war in the Alps, but her husband was taken and killed. And I see these, her children \u2014\nshe died about eight or nine years ago \u2014 I see her children to this day whenever I go to\nParis. And they're a wonderful family. So, the Sheftels are really something, aren't they?\nSo, that's the end of the story. I got back, presumably, I don't know, went by boat from, I\nthink, from Liverpool, to Canada, then back to the States, so I must have arrived the third\nweek of August or so. I must have gone down to Washington, back to New York, and I\nstarted teaching in September.",
        "Q: Any sort of debriefing or anything?",
        "A: I, there must have been something in Washington, but once back in New York, I kind of,\nI was in touch with a number of Jewish organizations and have different speeches I gave\non different occasions.",
        "Q: How did it change you? How do you think it Shaped you, rather than changed?",
        "A: Well, I don't really know. I \u2014 you know, it probably strengthened me. I don't recall \u2014 and\nI, I'm a person who can do a lot of soul searching \u2014 I don't recall ever really soul\nsearching about the circumstances of the departure. Incidentally, I, I, my supervisor,\nHelen Matousek, I \u2014 she was in New York for many years before moving out to Seattle.\nSo, I used to see her frequently. And we rarely talked about the old days, specifically.\nShe'd been through it all with me. I should tell you, there is one little story on one of the\nmeetings out in their headquarters. After dinner, she and I would sit aside, and she said to\nme, \"Henry, most people live their lives with the glass half full. You live your life and\nmay always lived your life with the glass overflowing.\"\nSo, she had my number. Sam Zisman, was a city planning consultant, it turned out. So I\nused to run into him, he was from Texas, I used to run into him at Planning \u2014 National\nPlanning meetings and we had a good relationship. I used to see Richard Winslow. I\ndon\u2019t know if I told you this story. There was the summer of '67 \u2014 '47, by then he was the\nSecretary General of the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York, and I\nstill hadn't resolved my housing. I'd float from one rental to another, sub-rental to\nanother. And I was subletting an apartment on East 94th Street, way east, which is those\ndays was really old, old tenement. And I had a four story walk-up. And his family used to\ngo to the Cape for the summer, so anyway, somehow or other, he decided to move in with\nme. It was next door to a laundry that was spewing out a lot of smoke. And every\nmorning we'd be leaving this slum building in our seersucker suits, going to our\nrespective jobs. Roger Masteude, I was very close to him and his family for 25 years until\nhe divorced and went west and his wife went west. But, I'm still in touch with him within\nthe last month on the phone or by letter. So, I'm in touch, I've been in touch with a\nnumber of these people and, how did it shape me? I don't know, it probably added\nsomething to the experience and so on. Added to my heft in certain ways as an\nadministrator and experience and politically. What's interesting, basically, is in my\nyounger years in New York City, I really wasn't close to the mayors, with O'Dwyer*\u00ae and\nImpellitteri\u2019, but with Wagner I was. And with Lindsay~\u2019 I was. I wasn't the closest\nconfidante, but I had a personal relationship with them. And, in each of these\nrelationships, I was able at different times to talk \u2014 what I regarded as turkey \u2014 to them. If\nI felt it needed to be, certain things needed to be said, I would say them. And, I remember\none meeting with Lindsay, had some problem, and when he left the room, my then boss,\nsaid to me, \"I don't think you made yourself very popular.\"\nBut, to me it didn't matter, I had to say what I had to say. And, with Wagner, the\ninteresting thing, we used to have lunch every year or two until his death, and in 1986, I\nthink, I had, I had read a book, I had read a book about his father, the senator, and I, I\nrealized for the first time as a result of reading it, that they were an immigrant family.\nYou know, for me, he was Yale and Catholic, upper scale, and all that, I'm still the ghetto\nboy, and \u2014 but I suddenly realized that his father was an immigrant, too. And I learned\nabout the family\u2019 And it \u2014 I'd never heard him speak about it. So, I had lunch with him in\n'86, and I took this up with him. And I said, \"Bob, this is the year of the immigrant, I\nthink you ought to found \u2014 find an occasion where you can speak on the subject.\" And he\ndid. He got an award that year from CUNY\u201d!, and the first paragraph of his speech was\non his immigrant background. So, I've been able to do, to be direct. And Koch\u201d? I had\nnever worked for Koch, but if I see him on something, not recently, but I, I might say to\nhim \u2014 I did at dinner one night, in his third year \u2014 \"Don\u2019t you have anybody on your staff\nwho knows how to let people you're firing off easy? Do you have to always get PR to let\nsomeone go? What about getting it once every other time, or once every third time, do\nyou need it every time?\" Then I took up some cases with him. \"They were nice people.\nWhy did you have to do it?\" So, you know, in the old days they used to talk about, they\nused to divide people into people who have the gyro\u2014 their inner gyroscope? And I\nhappen to be a person like that. And, if you want to deal with me, you've got to \u2014 and it's\nuncomfortable \u2014 you have to put up with that part of me if you want to get something out\nof me. And I can do a lot of good things.\n*8 William O\u2019 Dwyer\n\u201d Vincent R. Impellitteri\n\u00b0\u00b0 John V. Lindsay\n>! City University of New York\n>? Edward Irwin Koch",
        "Q: I wonder when you think about the experience in terms of, we just talked about how it\nshaped you, but what it did to your personal perception of being a Jew? Working with the\ndisplaced people and, you've written about the stories, etched faces.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, I was so formed in that way, that it's hard for me to see other, the other\nincrements which, I'm sure there are. But, in 1949, when I was in England teaching, I ran\ninto some of my Israeli friends, either in London or Paris or whatever. So, they arr\u2014 like\nthey arranged my trip to Salzburg and Switzerland, so they arranged, on the next holiday\nat the University \u2014 they used to run six week, trimester, six weeks in between \u2014 They\narranged for me to go on an immigrant boat from Marseilles to Israel \u2014 and Evelyn\u2019?,\nalong with me. And then, not all the time, but half the time, they were putting us up in\ndifferent places and so, I had the experience then of coming in on the Kedmah. Into the\nHaifa harbor early in the morning and seeing that Haifa amphitheater. Few people see it\nthese days because no one comes in by boat, but come in by airplane. What an\nexperience. So, I was in Haifa on the first anniversary of establishment of the state. I\nstood on a roof watching the parade and I lectured city planning at the Technion\u201d and\none or two other places. And, went to kibbutzim and they arranged for a Fohrenwald\nreunion at WIZO*, the Woman\u2019s Zionist Organization. They got announcements out in\nthe press and radio. Three hundred people turned out\u2019 So, there are these different\nincrements and I don't, I haven't subaggregated it, you know?",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about that reunion? What someone said to you?",
        "A: No, you know, so overwhelming. You know, I remember on that particular visit, I was\nriding on a bus and suddenly a man turns at me, extends his hand, and says, \"Herr\nDirektor.\u00b0\u00ae\u2019 You know, that's a pretty heady experience. You know, you need some\ncompensation for all the \"sturm und drang.\" So, I've demonstrated I can take the \"sturm\nund drang\" and I'm entitled to some of the things that come with it. You know, it's like\ncombat, hat \u2014 I don't get much out of that, I didn't get anything out of Ninth Division \u2014\nbut what I got out of it was my own sense of inner satisfaction at having served. And, but\nit's, it's an interesting part of history because there were really so few people around and\nit tells one so much about institutions \u2014 good and bad.\nAnd, but I'm sure most of the people, whether they came to the United States, I ran across\none fellow for many years, who went into the engineering area. Another fellow was a\ndermatologist. I came across a letter just yesterday and I went to the phone book to see if\n3 wife of interviewee\n4 Israel Institute of Technology\n>> Women\u2019s International Zionist Organization\n\u00b0\u00b0 Mr. Director (German)\nhe was still around and I didn't see his name. I saw his second name, but not his first\nname. I may call some of the relatives. But, in that sense, you can't recreate it, you can't\nremember. And yet, it has to be an important part of the history.",
        "Q: Do you know anything about what it is now? Has it been razed?",
        "A: Oh, I'll tell you, no, it still, it's been reconstructed as a, as a, some kind of community.\nBecause Susan Levin \u2014 who was born in the camp in about 1948 \u2014 visited it about three\nyears ago. I ran into her, she told me. But, what's happened in 50 years, as in most urban\nareas, 1S that the city has spread. The urbanization has spread. The suburbanization 1s part\nof the urbanization, so I have an impression that today it, that area, is simply a stop on\nwhatever rapid transit system Munich has. So, she \u2014 yeah, anyway, she went there, I don't\nknow if she knocked on a door or not. No.",
        "Q: Just a couple\u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but I've been back to Munich, I had no interest in going back.",
        "Q: You mentioned there being a lack of community space at the camp. Therefore, what,\nwhat did people do? Where did they congregate? Where did they sit around and gossip? I\nmean \u2014 or did that not happen?",
        "A: Yeah, well, there was a big community center. There was a big kitchen facility. I don't\nremember now what the lateral space around the community center was. So I mean \u2014 so\npeople are talking when they're standing in line waiting for food. '\" There were programs\nin the community center and the theater \u2014 I don't know whether every night, I don't\nremember that \u2014 but, they must have been fairly frequent. On the other hand, there is also\nevidence that people didn't rely completely on the movies we were showing. They went\nto the cinema in the town. Incidentally, I, I, I neglected to say this, it hadn't occurred to\nme at the time, on the \u2014 at the time of the riot, one of the things that I realized was that\nthere would be Jewish DP\u2019s in the cinema. By the time the movie was over, they would,\nword would be getting around. I didn't know what would be happening to them when the\nmovie let out. So, we took a batch of automobiles en route to the police station, en route\nto the camp, and we stopped off at the cinema and, during a break in \u2014 when they were\nchanging the film, I made an announcement that when it was over we'd pick them up and\ntake them back. Most of them left then and there, they didn\u2019t wait for the end of the\ncinema. So, anyway, people did different things. They went to Munich, that is, they \u2014 you\nknow, I'm not \u2014 there were\u2014",
        "Q: They could come and go?",
        "A: They could come and go, they, they were, they had friends or relatives in other places.\nSo, there, there was no computer, so people learned to be in touch with one another by\nconversation. I noticed in the camp newspaper there are several pages of listings of\npeople looking for people from different places. So, that was another communication\nsystem.",
        "Q: What else took up their time? I mean, did people get work during the day? Or, you said at\none point \u2014 I'll just ask it that way.",
        "A: Well, most people were working. Or they were in classes. The only ones, other than the\nblack marketers, but they were working, too. They were outside handlin\u00b0\u2019. Just as a word,\ny g y\nI came across in my notes, reference to the chief of police, allegations with regard to him\nand the black market came to me and I let it go. That was a big one, whatever it was.",
        "Q: The DP police?",
        "A: Yeah, I let him go. And there were some charges about the chairman of the camp\ncommittee. And I went to the camp committee and I discussed it and they suspended him.\nI don't have any further record of what happened. So, people were engaged, remember\nfood took time. You had to wait on line three times a day. Not everyone was waiting,\npeople would come back to the families. Now, there were the women and the pregnant\nwomen, and they had children. They were taking care of children. So, there were some,\nwe had, we didn't have space for a mikvah, you know that\u2019s a ritual bath. So, you know,\nthere were problems, but it isn't as 1f people were locked in space. See, that was a big\ndifference between this and the concentration camp. They had a little money, they \u2014 you\nknow, however they got it, could move somewhere or other. I don't remember how we\ndealt with the money problem. We may even have had a truck that went into Munich\ntwice a week or \u2014 for some hours. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You told a story earlier when the man came from the Army, when he went into the\nkitchen and somebody had defecated in there. Why would they do that? Why wouldn't\nthey go to the toilet? Is that something?",
        "A: I guess, I guess that's part a function of the breakdown of the inner self. Now, I know no\none in this room has ever felt an overwhelming impulse to go to the bathroom, to urinate\nor to defecate. I know that no one in this room has ever had the experience of letting a\nlittle go in the underwear. But even under such pressures as that, people with an inner\ndiscipline, shoot desperately to a place where they can let go. Alright? So, one has to\nassume in these cases \u2014 not with the freezing in the winter, that was a different situation,\nI \u2014 but, here Passover, in April, one has to assume that someone or several, had certain\nimpulses and there was not enough of an inner discipline to move them to an appropriate\nplace to discharge. That's my, how else can I explain it? Can you think of another\nexplanation?\n>\u2019 trading, doing business (Yiddish)",
        "Q: Very long line to go?",
        "A: What do you mean?",
        "Q: That they had gone to the regular toilet and might have to wait?",
        "A: No. By the law of averages, no, in a normal situation, by the law of averages, there are\ntwo or three bathrooms per building, the buildings are very close, so if this is lined up, it\nwouldn't have that.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re saying that somewhere in that person's experience, perhaps, you know,\nwhatever that experience was, before liberation, that they just kind of lost some of their\u2014",
        "A: Yeah, the starch, in the system. They were beaten down so much. They had to lose some\nof the starch. But what's interesting is on certain things they had starch and other things\nthey didn't have starch. On certain things they had stubborn resistance capability and on\nother things, they didn\u2019t. It takes awhile to reform the personality. And\u2014",
        "Q: You saw that happen?",
        "A: Yeah, but yet again, my vantage point doesn't enable me to see it person by person. It\nisn't the matter of it disable \u2014 doesn't enable me, my attention wasn't drawn to it person\nby person.\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "Q: What did you learn from the experience? Running the camp?",
        "A: Well, one thing, probably, you asked me about Jewish matters before. See, I'm, I'm an\namalgam of Jewish and universalist, and, and humanist. And, I believe very strongly in\nthis. But, I also believe that one of the most powerful engines in homo sapiens is the\nexistence, and probably the necessity, for the \"We/they\" relationships. So, when I think\nabout the \"we/they\" relationships in the context of my being Jewish and universalist, it\nmeans to me, in terms of Jewishness, pride, fullness in certain ways, identification,\nvalues. But, in a certain sense, as \"we,\" we shouldn't kill them. We should find a way of\nrelating to the \"they.\" All \"they's\" should find ways of relating to the \"we's.\" So, in a\ncertain sense in the camp, the \"we\" part was strengthened, as, as against the need for\nbalance in the \"we/they\" phenomenon.\nAnd the Army that I was dealing with \u2014 which I don't generalize to the whole Army,\nbecame the they, more than the Germans \u2014 became the they, in a sense \u2014 and that\nprobably does make me feel a little uncomfortable \u2014 because for me, I strong \u2014 I believe\nstrongly that all people need to have a \"we\" relationship, but they shouldn\u2019t convert that\n\"we\" relationship into a hostile, hostility to \"they.\" You see? I mean, if you take for\nexample, that thing I went through quickly with you, about Harlem hospital, where I was\ngoing in to do a lot of good, and did, the outcome in the Amsterdam News three days\nlater, five days later was from their \"we\" into an act of aggression against the \"they.\" And\nit was so, so uninspired, so uncalled for. And, so you get this all the time, and, and\nbecause, sometimes it\u2019s because of the way in which they act. That is the Katyusha\u2019\u00ae\nrockets make our we act in certain ways. And that distresses me, even though I accept the\ncounteraction. But, I basically prefer for the walls to come down a little bit more among\npeople. Even though they need for their well-being, a \"We\" relationship. So, in, in \u2014 at\nUNRRA, because of the behavior of some of these officers and soldiers, they were\nbuilding up some of the walls in me that I feel uncomfortable with. But, hell, even Rabbi\nHalberstam had a little bit of that, right?\nSo, I \u2014 but I've learned \u2014 what I've been leafing all my life, is the complexity of the\n\u201cwe/they\" relationships. I mean, people today focus, among other things, among a million\nthings, focus on Sri Lanka. I've been watching the Sri Lanka phenomenon for 20 years,\n\u00b08 Lorry mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian)\nnow. I always find these things that are illustrations of that, that bother me, disturb me,\nbut show how difficult it is to deal with.",
        "Q: I'd like ask you to show us this picture that hangs in your hall, and\u2014",
        "A: This picture is me speaking to the hundreds upon hundreds of people collected for the\nMaccabi games. Which was an athletic festival in, I don't know, probably May, because\nthe weather was fine. It could have been June. And, we had hundreds of younger people\nengaged in acrobatics and all kinds of athletics and it was a really a marvelous day.\n[technical conversation |",
        "A: This is me pointing something out to General Frederick Morgan who was the head of\nUNRRA in Europe. He had been Eisenhower's Deputy British Commander during the\nEuropean invasion. He was the highest British military officer. And, and I took him to the\nhospital, there are other pictures of him in the hospital and the vocational training\nfacilities and in different parts of the camp.",
        "A: Okay, this is a picture of a Rabbi, I believe it's Yitzhak Herzog, who was the Chief Rabbi\nof Palestine. He came to spend the Sabbath weekend with us. And, the camp was just in a\nstate of exhilaration over his visit because, for the people in the camp, this was a new\nbeginning, new life. Now, I just want to point out, at his right shoulder, is an American\nby the name of Rabbi Wohlgelerinter.\nI've never, never figured out whom the hell he was representing, but he was around all\nthe time. Now, when you look beyond Rabbi Herzog's right shoulder, partly cut by his\nhat, is the Mizrachi Rabbi, I can't remember his name. He was a marvelous human being.\nWe used to call him the red rabbi because he had red hair compared to the Rabbi\nHalberstam, who had black hair. Then at Rabbi Herzog's left shoulder is Gustav\nLachman, who was chairman of the camp committee, a wonderful man. He became a\nhigh school principal in Israel. And then beyond his left shoulder is me in Army dress, or\nUNRRA dress. I should add that Rabbi Herzog was the father of Rabbi Chaim Herzog,\nwho was the President of Israel. And, some years ago when I went to Israel, I put\ntogether an album with the pictures I had of Rabbi Herzog and I got an audience with the\nPresident. And we went over it, he was a young soldier, he was approximately my age, he\nwas in the British Army, and he remembered clearly that visit of his father to Germany.\nSo, we had a wonderful 15, 20 minutes together reminiscing. This is a picture of a flag\nraising ceremony in Hochlandslager. Where we were training some three to 400 young\npeople as agricultural workers in kibbutzim. Standing in back of me is the Jewish Agency\nteam. To the right as you look at the picture, Sarah Entin passed away, unfortunately,\nearly.\nNext to her is Liowa Lak, whom I've spoken about before. And next to him is Zviah\nLahar, whom I also spoke about before. She was the one who called me after the Hebron\nmassacre. This was around Passover time. And again, a lovely occasion. What can I say\nabout this picture? The thing that I always react to when I look at a picture like that, is\nhow much eagerness and smiles are on the faces. Because that's the thing that I most want\nto see. And you see it in there, including that head in the back who is raising his chin so\nhe'll get into the picture.\nEnd of Tape #9\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: What did your parents do here? When you were little, how did they make a living?",
        "Q: And they spoke Lithuanian to each other?",
        "Q: Tell us what that is.",
        "Q: No, I mean the Workman's Circle.",
        "Q: What, in what way had they misguided you? What did you start learning about or\nrealizing after the war that you felt you had been misguided on?",
        "Q: Just a little bit back because I think we need a few details about your time in the military.\nHow did you go into it? Where did you go at first? What did you see and how did that\naffect you?",
        "Q: The year?",
        "Q: Just finish that last story about the hospital with the German woman, the one, what your\nsupervisor said about the letter.",
        "Q: Just before we get into that, I would like to just move back and get a sense of what was\nyour feeling, when you were in the infantry, about the war? What did you think you were\nfighting against, your contact with Germans? And then as the information came out about\nthe Holocaust, did you have any contact with it in anyway?",
        "Q: I mean, you can tell from the way I spoke a few minutes ago about Roosevelt, that I had\nabsolutely no question in my mind or emotions about the purposes of the war. I had, I \u2014\nbecause of my German Yiddish, even in doing combat periods, I was always being used\nas an interpreter whenever we'd capture German prisoners. So, I had a lot of contact with\nGerman prisoners of war, army, whatever branch they were from. I had a lot of contact\nwith the German civilians. I didn\u2019t trust Germans. Didn't matter what they said to me. I\nwas always doing my job. You know. In some ways, I have a one track mind and in the\nsense of being focused. And \u2014 then when we ended the war in Leipzig, I don't remember\nwhat date we arrived there, April 29th, 28th \u2014 May first \u2014 a week or two \u2014 week before\nthe end of the war, they started \u2014 the commander started sending us across the river\nwhich is at Leipzig to a little peninsula there that's formed by another river and we were\ncasing the joint before the Russians arrived and after a few days, there were tens of\nthousands of German troops running away from the Russians to the American zone. And",
        "Q: Elaborate a little bit on that. You say your Jewish identity. Do you remember how that\ncame into play? Or anything you thought?",
        "Q: Do you remember when you decided to take the job what you're thoughts were? Perhaps\nsome of this was in your mind about, \"I do know these things, maybe I could run a camp\nbecause I know about city and\u2014\"",
        "Q: Okay, now\u2014",
        "Q: Paint us a picture, then, of that first day you were taken to the camp, were you in uniform\n\u2014 remind us how old you were, what did it look like to you \u2014 at first I presume someone\nmight have taken you around \u2014 what were your thoughts?",

        "Q: So, here you were, the director of the Displaced Person's camp, you\u2019re dealing with\neverything, fought in a war, you have family here.",
        "Q: Okay",
        "Q: Was there ever a time when you were focused on solving a problem, perhaps a broken\nwater pipe or something, and just somehow the fact that someone was a survivor, sort of\ncaught you by surprise? Perhaps something they said, or the way they looked, facial\nexpressions?",
        "Q: How do you feel?",
        "Q: So, you're trying to control who's in the camp, but what you're saying said, people are\ncoming in, maybe eight months after the war has ended, and the U.S. Army doesn't want\nthem to, or UNRRA doesn't want them to\u2014",
        "Q: What did you want though? As you're running the camp, but you're also, you're Jewish,\nand as you said, you understand that these fresh arrivals could be fleeing persecution in a\nplace like Poland. So, what do you want?",
        "Q: We need to change tapes.\nEnd of Tape #4",
        "Q: What we were just talking about, obviously, there's frustration in your voice about the\nsituation and I did read some other journalistic reports commenting that people a year\nafter the end of the war, a year after liberation, that people were living in very cramped\nquarters, that had echoes of concentration camps \u2014 obviously they were worse. Could you\njust talk a little more about that frustration. What would you have liked to have seen\nhappening that you could not provide?",
        "Q: I want to go back, just before we move into that and ask you: You were beginning to\ndescribe an atmosphere among a lot of the GI\u2019s that they essentially sympathized, I think\nthis is what you were saying, more with the German people in a way, than they did with\nthe people you were working with, displaced persons, the raggedy looking person coming\nfrom Poland.",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing things that, or feeling that tone, or witnessing something like\nthat?",
        "Q: Do you remember hearing things like that, or feeling that tone, or witnessing something\nlike that?",
        "Q: So many questions. Let me ask, we're talking about a year after liberation, and, and\ncertainly memories often surface around anniversaries. I wonder what kind of airing did\nthose emotions ever get? Any kind of formal way? Was there counseling? Were there\nsome kind of communal sessions where people were able to pray about the end of the\nwar? What did go on in terms of letting people get some of this out?",
        "Q: I'm not frustrated. Actually, you've intrigued and tantalized, that's all. One story I'd like\nyou to tell us, and perhaps it actually in some way, does answer my question for one\nperson, is the story of the young girl who insisted on singing to a group of your visitors. I\nwonder if you could tell us\u2014",
        "Q: The young girl who sang to the visitors, tell us little bit more about her song she sang.\nDid you ever hear her sing it afterwards?",
        "Q: Did you ever meet her?",
        "Q: Tell us what it was like on your level, on the macro level, on a day-to-day basis. What\nwould happen in that camp? When would you get to work? What was the rhythm about\nthat camp which sounds like it was some sort of small town?",
        "Q: His name 1s?",
        "Q: His name 1s?",
        "Q: Can you tell us about\u2014",
        "Q: What was your feeling when you were managing that camp? Did you have liked it to\nessentially disappear as you managed it? Or did you see it as a kind of, still a very\nnecessary refuge? Even though it had all these problems?",
        "Q: Did you ever get the sense that people got attached to it, even with its problems, because,\nafter all, it was a sort of safe haven? It was home?",
        "Q: What was your sense of what was going on within the people in the camp? Were they\nrecreating their lives in their previous homes and villages? Or were they creating some\nnew type of life that they hoped would be their life in the future and in a future state?",
        "Q: The young woman you've been writing to?",
        "Q: Have you shared this with your children?",
        "Q: Tell us about the first Seder at the camp when you were in charge. It might have been the\nfirst Seder after liberation.",
        "Q: Would you tell us about that \u2014 what did it look like?",
        "Q: A question that I didn't get to ask about just day-to-day living and you were describing\nthe rooms being so small and privacy. How were married couples able to be intimate? I\nmean, how, what, do you know anything about that? Or how did people make do?",
        "Q: Want to hold until those sirens pass? You were running a town.",
        "Q: That's interesting because in thinking about speaking with you, I know I'd hear about\nwhat this situation camp was \u2014 but I guess I didn\u2019t really anticipate hearing that you\nwould have to fight for the people over the treatment of the people. In other words, that\nyou had to become, or you did become, an advocate. You had to choose sides in a way.\nDo you agree with that?",
        "Q: Did you ever feel torn between your allegiance to the U.S. military and your allegiance to\nbeing a Jew \u2014 and the Jews in the camps?",

        "Q: Any sort of debriefing or anything?",
        "Q: How did it change you? How do you think it Shaped you, rather than changed?",
        "Q: I wonder when you think about the experience in terms of, we just talked about how it\nshaped you, but what it did to your personal perception of being a Jew? Working with the\ndisplaced people and, you've written about the stories, etched faces.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything about that reunion? What someone said to you?",
        "Q: Do you know anything about what it is now? Has it been razed?",
        "Q: Just a couple\u2014",
        "Q: You mentioned there being a lack of community space at the camp. Therefore, what,\nwhat did people do? Where did they congregate? Where did they sit around and gossip? I\nmean \u2014 or did that not happen?",
        "Q: They could come and go?",
        "Q: What else took up their time? I mean, did people get work during the day? Or, you said at\none point \u2014 I'll just ask it that way.",
        "Q: The DP police?",
        "Q: You told a story earlier when the man came from the Army, when he went into the\nkitchen and somebody had defecated in there. Why would they do that? Why wouldn't\nthey go to the toilet? Is that something?",
        "Q: Very long line to go?",
        "Q: That they had gone to the regular toilet and might have to wait?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re saying that somewhere in that person's experience, perhaps, you know,\nwhatever that experience was, before liberation, that they just kind of lost some of their\u2014",

        "A: My parents had a checkered career. They were both immigrants, they arrived from\ndifferent communities in Lithuania in approximately 1907. My father was married at the\ntime he arrived. And he and my mother met and they fell in love. And eventually they\nwere married. But a lot of sturm und drang! over many years. And so I, I, I was born in\n1922, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger\nsister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an\nolder half-brother.",
        "A: Well, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age. His\nmother died when he was very young. I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called \"A\nCentury of Time.\" And his father remarried a woman who had two small children. My\nfather, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the middle of the night\nand seeing, some feet away in the kitchen area, by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her\nchildren. He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls\nand bread from his father's bakery in the winter and putting 1t under his coat and running\nto the edge of town and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese. So it\nwas that kind of poverty. He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that,\npartly because of the growing spirit of enlightenment, enlightenment that was spreading\nin the 19th century. And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another\ntown, owning a bakery of his own, hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist\nmovement \u2014 and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905. Anyway,\nto escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the United\nStates, leaving behind a wife and one or two children. My mother came from another\ntown, which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but\n' storm and stress (German); \"life's hard knocks,\" hassles.\nthere was apparently a big fire, which she had no memory of. I picked this up at the\nMuseum of the Diaspora in Israel.\nThe population of the town declined by half \u2014 25, 3,000 people. And she was a child of\nvery old parents who had previous marriages. So, at the time she was born, her mother\nwas 50 and her father was 65. And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and\nher father was 80, and that was a family of butchers. And so, her mother and father\ndecided to turn over their little butcher shop to a, an older sister who was married to a\nbutcher, and in return for room for their stay, being taken care of in their old age. And the\nson-in-law, husband of sis\u2014 my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the\nparents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15. So she was sent to America. So,\nit's a story of great poverty, the background.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah, my mother's name was Sadie Sheftel, I think it was Shayne Rochel Sheftel, was the\nfamily name. And my father's name was Avram, Abe, and, I think, I can't quite sort out\nthe grandparent's names. Chana Leah was his mother briefly, until she died. His father's\nname was Israel Feivel. My mother\u2019s father\u2019s name was, I had it and I lost it.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: My mother came from Ivye and my father came from Drozgenik which was a sort of a\nsmall spa. Interestingly enough, I've not been able to find material on Drozgenik in the\nencyclopedia, the Jewish encyclopedia, which has Ivye.\nAnd I, someone at the New York Public Library gave me some alternative names to try to\ntrace through Lithuanian sources. Because for some reason, the Jewish sources don't have\nit.",
        "A: Well, my father became a baker. My mother became a dressmaker. They happened to\nmeet in a small tenement apartment on the Lower East Side. My father's older brother\nlived there with his wife who, it turned out, was a niece of my mother\u2019s, but older than\nmy mother because she had been born to some older half-brother and they had a little\nbaby at the time. And to keep things going they had boarders. So, there was a group of\nmale boarders in one room where my father stayed. And my mother stayed with two or\nthree female boarders in the kitchen on the floor. And that's how they met and shacked\nup.",
        "A: No, they spoke Yiddish, I think. They may have spoken Lithuanian, but I never heard it.\nYeah, it was Yiddish all the way. And \u2014 but as a result of this upbringing, this parentage,\nwe grew up in a secular household. I was not bar mitzvahed, my brother was not bar\nmitzvahed. We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through Workman's Circle\nschools. And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't read the English\nversion of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward? and reads that. And I\nwent through the Workman's Circle elementary schools, high school, and even into their\nsem-\u2014 the seminary for several years.",
        "A: Well, the elementary school was somewhere in the neighborhood.",
        "A: Workman's Circle was a fraternal organization that was linked to the Jewish socialist\nmovement, the Bund\u2019. And so, in, particularly at the high school level, when I was going,\nI was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars. It was in that\nsense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers. Mendele,*\nPeretz,\u2019 Sholom Aleichem, Ash\u00ae, poets, but not taught Hebrew. And it was an anti-\nZionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists. Anti-\nstateism, stateists. And I\u2014 when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the\ninfantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign. After the\nwar ended in Europe, I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that\ntime in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about\n? Jewish Daily Forward\n> Algemeyner Yidish Arbeter Bund in Lita, Poylen, Rusland [Universal Jewish Worker\u2019s Union in Lithuania,\nPoland and Russia] (Yiddish); Jewish socialist organization.\n* Mocher Seforim Mendele\n> Isaac Leib Peretz\n\u00b0 Sholem Ash\nit. And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this\nSocialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed\nafter the war. And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the\nsenior people at the Workman's Circle complaining about it, and protesting against it, and\ndeclaring that I would never set foot into Workman's Circle activity again. Because I felt\nI had been misguided, politically. And just as a minor passing note, by pure coincidence,\nin the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists\nand some references in the Forward to Jabotinsky\u2019, who was a right wing Zionist, the\nSocialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor\ncarrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky.\nSo, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just\ntold you. And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the\nproblem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben\nGurion\u00ae and Labor and Mapai\u2019 and kibbutzim. So they printed it as the lead letter and the\nheadline was \"Socialist Anti-Zionism \u2014 Zionist Poison.\" So, I'm waiting for the responses\nto come in from the Socialists now.",
        "A: They had trained, they had trained the Jewish side of me, the Yiddish side of me and then\nnot provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education. They were\nanti-stateist. They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl'\u00b0 and Weizman!! and\nthat group also. So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it\nwas clear that the survivors would have to go to a state and the only ones who were\norganizing to take them in were the Zionists from Palestine. They were the ones who\nwere organizing the underground routes to bring them to European ports and transferring\nthem to ships and sneaking them into Palestine. America was not open, the anti\u2014 there\nwere no anti\u2014 there were no refugee immigration laws at the time. So, in that sense, the\nother thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of coming to grips with this six\nmonths later, after I went into UNRRA, I could greet the Chief Rabbi of Palestine with a\nfeeling of love and no mixed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person.\n\u2019 Vladimir Jabotinsky\n\u00ae David Ben Gurion\n? Mifleget Po'alei Eretz Israel; Israeli labor party founded 193 0.\n'0 Theodor Herzl\n'l Chaim Weizman\nI could go into a mass meeting of 2,000 people and hear Ben Gurion and be exhilarated.\nAnd I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my camp on a fellowship basis and\nwhat this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was\nmy all inclusive Jewish quality.",
        "A: Okay. There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly\nfrom my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or\ntwo. But a friend of mine and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to\ngo in. And I remember us going to a naval recruiting station, oh like 1943, let's say. And\nthe fellow across the desk is saying to us, \"Do you like a good fight?\" And we're; \"uh,\nhuh, uh,\" and, and then he's talking that they need people for LST, for landing ship tanks,\nyou know, to run the boats. And we leave the building and one of us says to the other,\n\"You know, I prefer terra firma, the firmer the better.\" So, independently of one another\nwe were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my\ngetting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I\nwas in Europe. I arrived at the beaches in France, moved to Belgium. What?",
        "A: 1944, then, September. And within weeks, transferred to, I was a replacement, transferred\nto the ninth Division at the Belgian boarder \u2014 Hurtgen Forest. And overnight the Hiirtgen\nForest had some very special qualities; 1t was a tall forest and what the Germans were\ndoing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the trees and detonate and the\nshrapnel would come down on you.\nAnd one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded. So,\nthat was my initiation into combat. But in any event, I guess it was probably by October\nbegan the onslaught against Germany. And I was with the ninth Infantry Division. Which\nit turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the area in which the\nDP camp I went later, was in. My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries.\nAnd life is very peculiar and funny in some ways. Anyway, so I was in battle for Aachen,\nGermany which 1s closest to the French border. I crossed the Ruhr River, Duren. I was in\nthe Battle of the Bulge. We then moved into the Rhine when that was over. And we were\nin Bad Godesburg which is just south of Bonn. Home to many governmental, German\ngovernmental offices. And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word\ncomes through that we've, the American forces have captured the Remagen bridge and\nthey have sent people over it and we are put onto trucks, and by 11 o'clock in the\nmorning we're down at the site and we're crossing the bridge under direct fire from the\nother hills. Like the Palisades in New Jersey, crossing George Washington, under direct\nfire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the bridge. And\nwe establish a beach head on the other side. Now, just to step back a bit, because I've\nsince been back there and also a friend of mine in New York, was in the public relations\nunit of the division that took the bridge originally. And it's an interesting story about the\ndifference between the American forces and the German forces. By that point in the war,\nHitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making from his commanders.\nIn our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the American\ndivisions, moving through the woods, bypassing the city of Remagen, came to the heights\nthere above the river, they look out and they see the bridge 1s still standing. It was the\nonly bridge still standing. And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the\nregimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to\nGeneral Bradley!\u201d , General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says\nto him, \"Shall \u2014 which battle plan \u2014 shall I stay with the battle plan that we're on, or shall\nI start changing things, because of this discovery of the bridge standing?\" And Ike says,\n\"Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across.\" Now, that was the flexibility in\ndecision making by able people. And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, \"Pour it on,\nget\u201d \u2014 he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, \"let's pour it on.\" And that\nshortened the war by two or three months. And so \u2014 and I've since, incidentally, read\nhistorical criticism of the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest \u2014 basically, as an infantry private, I\nadored my commanders. I adored Bradley. I adored Eisenhower. I thought they were the\ngreatest in the world. And, and anyway, I fought all the way to Leipzig. We could have\nmoved on to Berlin. But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't. And I, I feel great\nabout having been a soldier. I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded.\nIt's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead\nand a standing soldier. I been, you know, battle after battle. I should, also, as an interlude\nhere, indicate that there came a time in early April when we're moving towards the Ruhr\nValley, that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to Paris. That was part of the rotation\nscheme. Letting different soldiers take a few days from the front line. And I went to Paris\nin April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended. And I'm walking \u2014 I'm\nchoking up as I'm telling you this story \u2014 I'm walking along the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and\nword spread that Roosevelt had died. Again, you know, I believe all the things that the\nHolocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but,\nnevertheless, he was my Commander in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's\nbeing well led, and so it was a very moving evening when word came through that he\ndied. And then two days later I was back at the front. Yeah. Anyway, then because of my\n'2 Gen. Omar Nelson Bradley\nprior education and settlement house experience, I succeeded in getting myself\ntransferred to military government. There I was promoted to Technician Fifth Grade. And\nI had terrific relationships with the military government, I don't know who. We were in,\nin a county, incidentally, Landkreis\u2019\u2019, at Ginzburg, which was between Ulm and\nAugsberg, and it happened to be the city, I didn\u2019t notice at the, time, from which the\nMengele family'* comes. I didn't know this. And as part of my duties for a few months, I\nset up a hospital for German women who were presumed to have venereal disease.\nAnd it was in response to the American soldiers who were, came down with venereal\ndisease and they'd have to give the doctors the probable source of their particular\nencounter. And you'd get a name, and I was the chosen one. I set up the hospital and then\nI would drive to the particular community and try to identify the woman. I might meet\nwith the local mayor or police chief or whoever, \"Who's Daisy around here?\" And I'd\nbring her in. And all the way she would complain, she's \u201ceine anstandige Frau,'>\u201d she's a\nrespectable woman, and so on. And then I'd bring them in, go on the ward. We had a\ngroup of nuns taking care of them. They were tested. Then by three days later they\nweren\u2019t giving me any argument that they were respectable women. And, I remember\nonce, a woman, who we finally discharged, came into the colonel or the chief of the\ngroup, wanting a letter that she was a her husband was coming back from the\nLuftwaffe'\u00ae, she wanted some letter attesting to her this and that. And the major, colonel,\ncalls me in and tells me about it and I says, \"Look, all you can do is give her a letter.\"\nEnd of Tape #1\n'3 District (German)\n4 Family of Josef Mengele\n'S a decent woman (German)\n'6 air force (German)\nTape #2",
        "A: Yeah. Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that\nI've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word. Which is my inspecting a \u2014 some\nhospital facility somewhere in this county we were in, which was a hospital for Jewish\ndisplaced persons. I have absolutely no recall about it. If you had asked me had you had\nany prior contact with Jewish DP\u2019s, I would have said \"no.\" Because I've been asked that\nquestion before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page memo of an inspection of\nthis hospital. And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of Harlem\nhospital in 1961. It's a subliminal yearning I have. Anyway, so, anyway, that county\nexperience was a very interesting experience. And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since\nwhen I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of places, so I\nwas called to serve at Supreme Headquarters in Frankfurt military government. They had\nhigher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to\nFrankfurt and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish \u2014 two years of\nGerman in college, and Yiddish \u2014 I was used as a translator of German documents into\nEnglish.\nAnd then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to Wetzlar\nnorth of Frankfurt to supervise the military government printing plant. That was printing\nmilitary government documents. It was an old German printing force and I was there\noverseeing it. And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I\ndiscovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the\nexecutive director of the settlement house that I had lived in for a year and a half while\ngoing to graduate school, was in Germany, and with UNRRA and he was in Munich. So,\noccasionally, once a month, I don't remember, on a weekend, I would travel from where I\nwas to Munich, which wasn't far, and I'd spend a day with him. And then, in November, I\nlearned that he was leaving Germany for, the States. He was going into the State\nDepartment Office of Refugee Affairs and so, we rendezvoused in Wiesbaden one\nweekend, which was zone headquarters for UNRRA, and it was over that weekend, and\nhis name 1s Dick Winslow, Richard Winslow. He later, a year later, two years later,\nbecame the Secretary General to the Unite States Mission to the United Nations, right\nafter it was formed. A very able fellow. Anyway, over this weekend, he said, \"What the\nhell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a printing plant, when there\nwould be so much more important things for you to be doing given your background and\nyour interests?\"\nYou see, at the settlement house. my, one of my major assignments during the year and a\nhalf I was there, you had to do something in exchange for room and board, it was the\nSouth End House, was the second oldest settlement house in the country. It had been\nfounded in 19 \u20141892 or 1893. He had to prepare a 50th annual report. He turned that\nassignment over to me. I went into all the historical files and books and reports and this\nand everything. I did the draft of the 50th annual report. This is how he and I became so\nclose. Then he did some revision and upgrading and this and that, and it was printed. And\nthen I did other things in the settlement house community, I did a term paper for my\nmaster's program on city planning, on the South End planning board. A history of that\nand what it did. So, he had a pretty good sense of my intellectual and practical interests\nof experience and then the following morning he brought me into zone headquarters and\nGertrude Richland(ph) was there from the Eastern Division. A marvelous woman, she\njust died about two years ago in Santa Barbara. She later became Chief Public Welfare\nOfficer in Washington, D.C. And they recruited me, signed me up, and they had in mind\nfor me to go to Fohrenwald because the then director was a Canadian woman, a fine\nwoman in many ways, but having inordinate difficulties with the Jewish DP\u2019s. She\nseemed to be somewhat rigid and the plan was for me to come in, serve for several weeks\nas her deputy, and then two weeks later she would be transferred out and I would become\nthe director. Anyway, then\u2014",
        "A: Well, I guess I completely identified with the war effort.\nwe're just a few soldiers, and they're armed and we've got one rifle on our shoulder. We\nwere marching thousands of German soldiers westward across the river. And I don't even\nremember how we got across the river. And so, I had a lot of contact. And down in the\nmilitary government and in the county, I had a lot of contact with Germans. Remember, I\nwas having contacts with the Biirgermeisters'\u2019 and the chiefs of police and the health\nofficials and so on and so forth. But, in a certain sense, I was the conqueror, I had the\npower. And it's interesting to me, Katie!\u00ae, and I don't understand it considering my\nbackground, but you've seen some of the pictures. I was, here I was a private and a\ncorporal, but in the pictures that I have of UNRRA, you see the qualities with which I\nexpress, I visually express authority.\nSo, you know, speaking to the DP\u2019s, you can see, I don't know where it comes from. And,\nSO, In my relations with the Germans and so on and so forth, matter of factly, I'm never\nhemming or hawing, or beating the bush, I'm always going about doing my business and\nI'm, I, not making any judgments about them. This individual, that individual. A woman\nhas venereal disease, we deal with that. I was not with any group that was opening\nconcentration camps, I was not with any group that was dealing with the SS or with the\npolitical dimension in terms of the war crimes trials that would later occur. I was not in\nthat. Somehow or other in ways that I have absolutely no memory of, whether it's Stars\nand Stripes, whether American Armed Forces Radio, I learned about the Holocaust. I\ndon't think anybody was sending me the New York Times or the Paris edition of the\nHerald Tribune, but somehow I was in gathering. And it was obvious from what I did\nwith regard to the Workman's Circle, that it was, it was working on my system. And that\nI had strong feelings about it. Oh, powerful feelings about it. And when one thinks later\nabout my last encounter in Germany with Dick Winslow and a colleague who was\nleaving at the same time, Roger Masteude, they were telling me to come in, I didn't jump\nat it. I asked a lot of questions. It was a gradual, two day, weekend process. I was doing a\nlot of soul searching, incidentally.. Now that I think about it. Doing a lot of soul\nsearching that weekend on other matters. I was soul searching about what I felt was the\ninanity and the corruption of many of the American soldiers I was running into. I \u2014 at \u2014I\nmean, remember, I was an educated young kid, a City College!\u2019 graduate and proud of\nthat, MIT\u201d graduate and proud of that.\nAnd I was dealing with very \u2014 I was a private, I wasn't an officer \u2014 and dealing with these\npeople in various situations. And that was not what was giving me my love for America.\nWhen I was running the printing plant I lived with some local group of soldiers. I was\n'7 mayors (German)\n'8 Katherine Davis\n'9 City College of New York\n0 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nnot, I was attached to them for room and board. My unit was in Frankfurt and I could see\nsome of these guys were wheelers, dealers, black market. We were eating venison \u2014\nwhere were they getting the fresh deer from? So, here were very close friends, spirits,\nover that weekend with Dick and Roger Masteude. And I was just getting out all the pain\nof that experience to them. And I guess it was partly that accumulated pain as well as my\nJewish identity that finally enabled them to convince me to do this, and for me to say\nokay.",
        "A: Oh, well it's hard. It's my second nature. You know it's \u2014 people can't understand this\nabout me, because of my secularism and my lack of the bar mitzvah. I never touched foot\nin a synagogue, literally, until maybe 10 years ago. It was just not part of my background.\nNow, I do different things that bring me into that, even though I can\u2019t believe what\nthey're talking about. For me, it's history, not religion. And I can identify with the history,\nI can extract philosophical meaning from it and, belief. And be proud of that and share\nthe pain. No, I think that this small group of people has made an enormous, an inordinate\ncontribution to the world and to world civilization. For a variety of reasons and so on.\nYou know, when I was a junior at college, sociology major, I was declared, whatever, an\nhonor student.\nAn honor student was relieved of having to take certain courses for credit. But, in\nexchange, the honor student had to do a paper, a two year project. And submit it and that\nwould complete the terms of the thing. And I did a paper on the Jewish ghetto as a form\nof either adaptation or a form of accommodation to the urban environment. Remember, I\nwas an urbanist. And I spent a good deal of those two years in the library studying Jewish\nhistory. Going back almost 2,000 years in terms of Venice and Prague and other places.\nAnd up to Louie Wirth's book on the ghetto, he 1s professor of sociology at the University\nof Chicago. I\u2014 in 1940, 1940, '41, I was studying the various ethnicity data and the\nincidents of different social economic indicators and medical indicators of Jews\ncompared to other immigrant groups. I immersed myself in that material. It was really in\na sense, that piece of work that led me into city planning not vice versa. It was this\nfeeling that if this history and this culture could lead to certain cultural qualities and\nchanges, that made them so much better adapted to the urban environment than other\ngroups, then maybe there's a volitional way in which you could do things in general that\nwould improve the urban environment. And that's when I set in, I didn't know there were\nmasters degrees in city planning at the time. I hardly, barely knew that there was a city\nplanning commission in New York. I began putting it together in my own head. I went\nout, I found that the University of Iowa was virtually the only university in the country\nthat had two summer sessions back to back. So, I applied and I went out to Iowa and I\nstarted taking courses in what I thought were \u2014 one would want me to know in order to\nput these things together.\nI took a course in surveying. I took a course in civil engineering. I took courses in\ncalculus. I took courses in spherical trigonometry. In order, back then, sometime in early\nAugust, I'm in the library and I'm looking at the Sunday New York Times and\nsomewhere I come across a little squib that, which indicates that Mass \u2014 MIT is going to\nstart offering a bachelors degree in city planning. So, I write the chairman of the program\na letter saying, \"I already have a baccalaureate degree, but I would like to enter this\nprogram if you would give me certain credit for my past baccalaureate,\" and I get a letter\nback from him saying oh, they already have a masters program. I wouldn't have to take\nthe baccalaureate, he would, with my background, he would admit me to the masters\nprogram. And he was then the one, he gave me a scholarship, and he was then the one\nwho guided me to the settlement house for, so I could live cheaply. My parents or I, we'd\nsurvive with food on the table during the depression, but that's how I got to the settlement\nhouse. And little did I know when this was happening that the chairman of the program,\nFred Adams, was the son of the chief city planner who had, British city planner, who had\ndone the major New York regional plan of 1929, 1930. And, so it was, again, it was in\nthat Jewish context, I mean, that stuff surrounds you and penetrates you. I didn't have to\ngo to shul\u2019! or synagogue\u2014",
        "A: You know, the only part of \u2014 I say the only part of the experience that I didn't have, the\ncontent was no problem. The human relationships were no problem.\nThe analytic component was no problem. The listing of tasks to be taken care of was no\nproblem. I come across three pages of notes in my background stuff outlining all the,\ntasks to be taken care of. That was no problem. The only part of the experience that I\ndidn't have was supervising other people. And \u2014 but I should add a thought here \u2014 which\nwas, I just think of it, I never, I have not made this connection before, Katie. You have to\nunderstand, Sept \u2014 September, 1942, I'm coming from the ghetto in East New York,\nBrooklyn, from the entire ghetto of my life, and I'm moving into Boston, into a settlement\nhouse, with a group, not only with the staff, that has no Jews on it, but, but a group of\nresidents who are also living there, none of, no one else of whom is Jewish. I'm the kid on\n71 synagogue (Yiddish)\nthe block. And I make a terrific adaptation. They loved me. I was getting such love back\nfrom this diversified group of people \u2014 all of whom were older than me. It's like what I'm\ntelling you, what I told you earlier, about my mentors. I don't know how they, why, how\nthey attached to me. They saw something in me. I never set out to get them as it were.\nAnd here the, we had, there was a Peruvian couple, or Chile, I don't remember. Chile. Oh,\nno. There was a Chilean couple, a Peruvian guy, two women musical students, one from\nKentucky and one from somewhere else. People from Illinois and this and that. And they\nloved me. It was a supportive environment. So, I guess that experience of who I was in\nsome way played into my ability to move into this international staff and manage with\nthem.\nBecause you see, in a certain sense, intellectually, intellectually I was their equal.\nAnalytically, I was probably ahead of most of them. Even in my ability to size up\npolitical situations. I was probably pretty good. Given, you know, given my military\ngovernment experience of working, again, with the military. I haven't mentioned that the\nmilitary government team must have included 15, 20 other people with whom I was\nrelating all the time. Or when I was going into Frankfurt, into SHAEF~\u201d and related, so I\nhad a lot of relationship experience. So, I guess I overcame the lack of administrative,\nworking with older people, administrative experience. And I must have had some\ncharismatic quality that I don't, still don't quite recognize, 'cause I'm insecure, Katie.\nEnd of Tape #1\n?2 Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Forces\nTape #3",
        "A: Well, the camp, I came in the middle of January. I was wearing a new uniform. An\nofficer style, you know. The camp consisted of about 280 buildings. It was built by the\nI.G. Farben Company to house slave labor that they were employing in a munitions\nfactory in the woods to the south. The buildings, because it was for slave labor, were not\ntypical detached, semi\u2014 detached buildings. They, they had no kitchen facilities, no\ncooking facilities. The only communal facility in each building was a toilet or two. They,\nthe buildings consisted of one large room on the top floor, second floor, and one small\nroom on the ground floor. Food was dispensed in a kitchen area. People would go, wait\non line, get food, either eat it there or come back to the room and eat it. Having gotten rid\nof the slave labor, the Army took over this village for DP\u2019s and it gradually became a\nJewish camp before I got there. It was also cold. Bavarian winter is awful. I had spent the\nprevious winter in the Black Forest \u2014 parts of the Black Forest. It \u2014 we slept outdoors, in,\nin fox holes. There was a constant flow of soldiers who, what did they call it, black, not\nblack foot, black something or other, they's lose their digits, their toes, their feet.",
        "A: No, there was another name for it. I was cold, but I never suffered from that. But anyway,\nthese winters are very cold. Anyway, I went around camp, I met the staff. I don't have\nmuch recall of that the first few days in that sense. I was absorbing.\nVisiting the kitchen, seeing how they cooked. Visiting the hospital. We had two hospital\nbuildings. And I don't remember now exactly, but within a week or two of my arrival,\nthe, the, the cold was so substantial that it froze the pipes leading to the toilets. Four\nhundred out of 600 toilets were out of commission. The area of the toilets became like a\ncow barn, like cow barns. It was awful. It was awful. It took several weeks to deal with\nthe pipe problem. As someone said it, \"gets worse until it gets better.\" But, you have to\nremember, and I'll, I'll, I'll be making notes on this along with, that that was happening to\nthem eight and a half months after liberation. They were living under conditions like that,\nAnd, anyway, it was during that period that Jean Henshaw, the former director left. I\nassumed the directorship. And I should tell you, just somewhere in here, because I can't\nremember which comes first and which comes second.\nThere was a subsidiary group attached to the team, we had a few people from Joint\nDistribution Committee\u201d\u2019 attached to us, we had a group of three, four, five people from\nthe Jewish Agency for Palestine. Remember, this is two years before the creation of the\nstate. We're now into February of '46, and, and also because of my background, I'd never\ndealt with Zionists before. The Army later accused me of being a member of Zionist\norganizations, but little did they know I'd never been in the Zionist movement before.\nBut, nevertheless, there's this group. And they, after, we had a large house for the team,\nover 20 members of the team. They came from Australia, Norway, England, France,\nU.S., elsewhere, I don't, and Israel, and Palestine. And we had billets. We were billeted in\na large house at the edge of the German town, which was called Wolfratshausen. And,\nand so, and we'd have breakfast there, sometimes lunch, and usually dinner. After dinner\nthey invite me to one of their rooms for a drink or whatever. And it was in the course of\nthat, that I established with them and they established with me, very close relationships.\nBut they, being sophisticated undergrounders, which I was not, at that time, start asking,\nyou know, warmly asking me questions like you are asking the questions. \"Where did\nyour mother come from? Where did your father?\" But that's all preliminary. They're\nsizing me up, could they trust me or not trust me? You're not asking me questions like\nthat in order to ascertain whether you can trust me or not, you're asking me questions for\noral history. They're asking me the questions to ascertain, can they trust me? And after\nseveral weeks of this process, it basically boils down to they trust me. They trust me.\nOkay. However, in underground activity, there's another rule.\nAnd that is, you never share with anyone anything more than that person has to know. So,\nthe person has deniability. Okay? So, I am not curious and they are not volunteering\ninformation. I notice things from time to time around the edges. Okay? For example, one\nof them says to me one, \"I don't know, Friday or whatever, would you like to go to\nSalzburg for the weekend and hear some music?\" And I say, \"Sure, but I don't have any \u2014\nthe appropriate papers.\" He says, \"Don't worry about it.\" And, en route, we drive north,\nwhich was not the right direction, to Munich, and we stop in front of a building and they\ngo inside, I'm in the car. I've given them some of my papers. They come out with\nappropriate visa papers and all of that to cross over and come back to the American zone.\nWe go to Salzburg, we drive to Salzburg. And we had a wonderful weekend. A month\nlater, whatever, one of them says, \"How would you like to go to Switzerland?\" So, they\nwere organizing my leisure time for me with false papers. I don't ask any questions. I just\ngo along for the ride. These are the Jewish Agency for Palestine. The, Ben Gurion, at that\ntime, was the chief executive of the Jewish Agency for Palestine. I get to know the zone\nchief of this group in Munich who years later, almost 30 years later, 25 to 30 years later,\nbecomes, what do they call it, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. And,\nincidentally, and that's like 19\u2014 that was in '64, but then I discovered a few years later\n3 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\nthat he lost a son, in the '67 war. So, it brings these things close to home. Anyway, that\nwas the group. But I developed a closeness to the Joint\u201d* staff, Stanley Abramovitch was\na rabbi from England, Becky Althoff was a social worker from New York, and we had a\nmarvelous woman from Norway, Astrid Oksny. I tried to trace her some years ago and I\nfound out she had passed away prematurely. Then in early March, the Americans are\nblowing up things in the I.G. Farben plant. And in the process, they destroy the water\nmain that is carrying water to the camp. And I start calling desperately for the Army to\nget water tanks in and do something. We get a few tanks, the few tanks that come in we\nturn over to the hospital facility. But there's no cooking that takes place during that,\ntoilets again. Then by the fourth or fifth day, I am out of my mind, and I start calling my\nheadquarters and so on. Finally, a general appears and that leads to, but 1t shows also how\nin a period of crises, how hard it was to get the U.S. Army to pay attention to a real\nproblem. And now, throughout all of this, these trials and tribulations, we also have a lot\nof very positive things going on. We organize a theater. We organize schools for the\nchildren. There's a yeshiva. We have hospital going, children are being, babies are being\nborn, at an enormous clip for that size population. We \u2014 We're running an agricultural\ntraining center to the south. Where they're learning how to work on a kibbutz. Now\nthere's little, probably a little military activity on the side, but I don't know about it. But\nit's a positive education of these people who until the previous May, have lived under the\nmost forlorn situations. The children are giving performances. The adults are putting on\nplays and they're starting to publish a camp newspaper in Yiddish, and a magazine. And\nwe \u2014 there's established a camp committee for self governance and there's, there are\nelections for membership on the camp committee and 1,000 to 2,000 people are voting in\nthe elections in order to make the camp committee representative.\nAnd I'm dealing with them. And we have over 1,000 people employed in tasks in the\nkitchen, in the warehouse, in the transportation unit, in the hospital. We're employing\npeople. We have vocational training activity. Machinery and other things; sewing, that's\ngoing on. There are a lot of positive emotional rebuilding efforts here. But, the food is\nbasically GI issue. It's canned. It's not fresh. They, the Army, doesn't want to take it out\nof the German economy. There's three ounces of protein a day. Whether a piece of\ncanned fish or canned chicken or this or that. You have it at one meal, you don't have it at\nany of the others. So, a black market in food develops. And the Army 1s beside itself as if\nits going to destroy the German economy. But who's selling to them? The German\nfarmers. They're probably selling to some of the military government units to, so, but in\norder to prove myself, my\u2014 and, basically, I don't like black marketing. I was telling you\nearlier how I was reacting moralistically to black marketing among the soldiers. I didn't\nwant Jews to be involved in the black market, it offends me, it's a backwards step in\ncommunity building.\n4 American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee\nSo, I have to do something. Now, it occurs to me when I read all this stuff that, \"How did\nthey get the cows into the camp?\" They were probably leading them past our DP police\ngroup that was on duty in the middle of the night. What am I going to do? But, at least\nonce a month, I would get up in the middle of the night. All by myself. I'd drive into the\ncamp alone. I'd pick up a couple of my DP police at the gate and I'd start driving around\nthe camp, looking for lights in the basement. If there were a light in the basement, it\nmeant, usually, that a butcher was killing a cow. And on the 29 days of the month that I\ndidn't come around, word would spread in the morning, \"there's meat in 'x' building, 'x'\nstreet,\" and people would start flowing and buying meat. I don't know where they got the\nmoney, whatever. So, I'd come in and I'd confiscate the meat and I'd, we'd bury it. We\ndidn't throw it into the kitchen. And I'd put the butchers into the brig. And during the day\nI'd visit them and I remember one of them saying, \"Herr Cohen, you don't understand us\nbutchers. For us blood means nothing. The cows are yours.\" I'd say to the police, \"Give\nthem an extra day.\" I didn\u2019t turn them over to the Army, I didn't turn them over to the\nGerman police.",
        "A: I felt awful. I was, but, but, I want to tell you something, Katie, as I read these various\nmemos and records, and having been in, in government for the years \u2014 I was, nine years\nin Mayor Wagner's\u201d cabinet \u2014 governance is constantly involving you in dilemmas and\ndifficult choices. Impossible choices, hair-raising choices. And it's happening all the\ntime. And if you can't make choices, you got to get out of there. You know, this\nantigovernment stuff, for me, is in some ways, a lot of nonsense.\nBecause a democratic society has to have a system where, without killing, you make\nchoices. And, so, in a DP camp, the director has to make difficult, impossible choices.\nAnd, so, but, I don't want to get to this too soon in the interview, but, on something like\nApril 12th of that year, a week before Pesach, I went to the Munich railroad station and I\nsent off a couple of cables to the \u2014 to friends in the States. I sent one cable to Dick\nWinslow in the State Department and another cable to William Wurster a prominent\narchitect at that time, in Cambridge. And I tell them about the food situation. The\nimpossibility of it \u2014 no fresh food for Pesach \u2014 we got a little bit from the Joint. And the\nend, the end of my sentence 1s, \"stir up the bees.\" And I get replies from both of them.\nBut, I hadn't given it a thought at the time, but it's clear to me in \u2014 then and in retrospect,\nthat Army Intelligence picked up the cables. And I'll come back to that later. Just on a\npersonal note, during the period we were without water, when the pipe had burst, which\n5 Robert F. Wagner Jr.\nwas exhausting period for me, I came back to my office one day to take care of some\nmatters, and a few minutes later, my English secretary, Rose Hafkin, comes in, she says,\n\"Henry, there's a woman outside who says she thinks she's your cousin.\" And I say,\n\"Well, have her wait few minutes, I've got to take care of this or that,\" and then a few\nminutes later I call her in. And now I'm suspicious, I don't know if she's my cousin or not.\nIt would be advantageous to her if she is my cousin. So, I start interrogating her.\nAnyway, I don't know whether she found out about me through the grapevine, because\npeople are always asking, \"Where did your parents come from?\" and then when they hear\nsomeone comes from that town, well, \"Oh, the director at Camp Fohrenwald, his mother\ncomes from there, his father comes from there.\"\nWell, whether there had been some correspondence between her and family in New\nYork, I don't know. She's my cousin. And, she comes from the Sheftel branch of the\nfamily tree, my mother\u2019s, the butcher side of the family, not the baker side. It turns out\nshe has a brother in the camp to whom she doesn't talk, he's a butcher. He's probably one\nof my black marketers. I don't know at the time whether he's the one who made the threat.\nIt's a small world. But, anyway, she has a sister in this camp that both of them are living\nin, just north of Munich and the sister has a young daughter, I don't know, seven, eight,\nnine, 10. And, I ask her, \"How did you survive?\" Well, what happened was, the Germans\nhad occupied the town Ivye, and at a certain point they told \u2014 word spread, everybody\nhad to come out to the village square with their pots and pans, the Germans needed the\nmetal. My cousin, this cousin, didn't wait for that, she escaped into the woods and lived\nthe rest of the war with the partisans. And her older sister must have left sometime earlier\nand gone into Siberia with her little girl and spent the war in Siberia. And, so it was a\nvery moving experience. And, she has since, they migrated many years ago to Canada,\nToronto, and became very wealthy. Now, another thing involving the black market, the\nso called black market\u2014",
        "A: No, they were shot, I'm sorry, they were shot. I'm very sorry. Very few survivors from\nIvye.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don't recall. There was other family of theirs in South Africa, Rhodesia. Other brothers.",
        "A: No. At the end of the interview, I'll give you another find.",
        "A: That's not in any of the material that you've read.\nEnd of tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Well, her name was Malka and the second names mean nothing because \u2014 her sister had\nan assumed name, Bashke \u2014 they were both Sheftels. Now, Malka, somewhere in this\nprocess, maybe in the woods or in battle with the partisans or whatever, lost the love of\nher life at the time, Bashke obviously, lost her husband. And \u2014 but, but it's hard to recall\nnow. Malka was probably born after my mother left, and Bashke was probably born after\nmy mother left Ivye, so there was no contact on that score. By the time they would have\nhad any consciousness in terms, by virtue of age, they would probably not even have had\nany memory about my mother\u2019s mother, no longer lived in Ivye. She went, they took her\nto some town, I don't remember. So, there was a little talk about the family, but I don't\nreally remember much of that. That 1s \u2014 the critical thing was, they were family, they\nwere survivors, they had been through hell, and I didn't really find out too much about\ntheir day to day lives.\nI have the impression about the older sister in Siberia. She'd be groveling in the soil,\nplanting, picking, whatever. I guess that in those days, I, I, well, let me put it this way,\nwhat I realize now in my dotage, is that for every one who died and for every one who\nsurvived, there would really be 10 or 20 stories. So, in a certain sense there are 100 to\n200,000,00 stories. And we know only a few of them. And that was not an age for me\nwhen I was collecting stories and, and, in a way, it, it, it \u2014 the \u2014 it \u2014 my focus on what I'm\nabout, puts a limit on certain of the human connections from time to time. When people\nwant to be able to tell you and so on, and you're focused and you're doing one, two, three\non the list, see? So, I don't really remember that much about that. In any event, the\npassage of time also dims recall.",
        "A: You know \u2014 the \u2014 a couple of stories sometimes. I don't know if you have that picture in\nyour group. There are four little girls, they're all dressed in costumes. It's clear they've\njust been in some performance. And two of the four girls, the two little ones on the, each\nside, left and right, have faces that are so gaunt and with that smile on their face, the\nvisage. The two older ones are smiling. The two little ones, here it is, you know, close to\na year after the war, and the quietness wherever they were that was droned into them,\nhasn't yet enabled them to blossom out. The other, I don\u2019t know whether this answers \u2014\ndeals with your question, Katie, but, again, it's an encounter, a very severe encounter. We\nhad, in our camp, a Rabbi Halberstam\u201d\u00b0. He was called the Klausenburg Rabbi. He was a,\nfrom a line of hundreds of years of rabbis, and he was born to be a rabbi. I'm gonna, I'll\ncome back to this in a minute, but I want to skip to the last week or two. I've been trying\nto find out his first name. I actually had it somewhere on a piece of paper and I can't\nlocate the piece of paper. So, I, I decided I would go to the Brooklyn telephone book and\nlook up Halberstam and make a few phone calls and ask about the Klausenburg Rabbi.\nAnd what was his first name. Okay? So I go to the Brooklyn phone book, I have a 1992\nBrooklyn phone book, it doesn't matter. Okay? And I see Halberstam, it's almost a\ncolumn long. And what I see in this listing of Halberstams is how many have attached to\ntheir name, \"Rabbi.\" So, you know, with my statistical bent, I do a count. Forty-three\npercent of the telephone listings are people with the word rabbi in front of their names.\nThat's the Halberstam lineage, okay? I use statistics to illuminate, not lie. I mean that is\nsuch a powerful fact, okay? So, anyway, we're back. So, now, he had lost his wife in the\nHolocaust, and maybe 10 children. This man had suffered. Deeply is not an expression\nfor the suffering that must have been inside this man. And he was in touch with his\nconfreres in New York, and they raised money.\nAnd they piled all these supplies, canned food, dried food, kosher food, clothing,\nreligious articles, books on a boat that came, arrived in Bremen. And the Army would not\nrelease the material to Rabbi Halberstam. And the cables must have flown between\nBremen and Munich and New York and New York and Washington and political\npressure brought on Congress people, on the State Department, on the Army and finally\nafter a week or two, a compromise is reached. They will release his \u2014 that material to the\ndirector of the camp. So, I am once again confronted with those daily dilemmas, what do\nI do with that material? Can I \u2014 considering the pressure I am under from the Army on\nthe black market, simply transfer it over to Rabbi Halberstam? So, I am summoned to his\nroom. He was one of the very few people in the camp who had a room of his own.\nSomewhere I have it, well, I won't bother, but probably 10 by 10 would have been a lot.\nAnd I'm sitting across him, across the table from him, and he's in a Hasidic robe, big\nblack beard, yarmulke hat, whatever.\nBlack piercing eyes. And, remember what I told you earlier, I have never set foot in a\nsynagogue in my life to that point \u2014 nor for two or three decades later \u2014 and here I am\nconfronting the Klausenburg Rabbi, a king \u2014 I'm an ordinary administrative bureaucrat.\nAnd we exchanged perfunctory greetings. And then in effect he says, \"Nu?\" I say, \"Nu,\nwhat?\" He wants to know why I don't turn the material over to him. I say, \"But Rabbi, if\nthe Army had intended for me to turn it over to you, they would have given it to you\ndirectly. But they turned it over to me which means that I can't turn it over to you.\" He\n*6 Jekuthieh Judah Halberstam\nsays, \"That's not fair.\" I hadn't yet learned the John Kennedy phrase which didn't come\nfor 15 years later, \"life is unfair.\" I said, \"I can't. It would create so much trouble, I can't\ntell you.\" He says, \"It belongs to me.\" I say, \"I know it belongs to you, but I can't. I will\ndistribute it among the people of the camp. You will get a good share of it, but you will\nnot get all of it.\" He is so upset. His eyes are piercing through me. I finally say to him,\n\"But, Rabbi, the other people are Jews too, they have also suffered.\" He basically, didn't\ngive a damn. I teamed something from that, I'd not encountered that before. Here I am, an\nall inclusive Jew, what I hadn't quite recognized were the meaning of these divisions with\nunbridgeable attitudes or whatever.\nThe meeting broke up and I left. And I knew it wasn't fair. I knew, to this day, I know it\nwasn't fair. The Army shouldn't have done what it did, put me in that position. But, again,\nI had to make a decision. I had to choose. And, and, I made that choice. I mean, I don't\nrecall that subsequently there were any further ramifications from it, but 1t was that\nincident, you see. Constantly. Now, let me just say, not only was the black market, this\nproblem. You've heard -You've about it, you hear me about it. But, the Army was also\ngreatly preoccupied with the infiltration problem. The British clearly didn't want more\nJews in Germany. And I have, I haven't gone into that here, but I've been to the National\nArchives and for selected weeks here and there over the last, during the last five years,\nmaybe in the aggregate I've spent a month or five weeks of time at the National Archives,\ntrying to get some better understanding of the context. And, incidentally, you find some\nvery interesting material there on that. I mean, for example, you come across cables, in\nlate '45, the State Department is cabling all the ambassadors in every country in the\nworld, asking on a top secret basis, \"Is there any room in your \u2014 in the country you are\ndesignated to, is there any room for Jews?\" And then you see cables coming back \u2014 I\ndon't think I've read all the cables coming back \u2014 but substantially, the answer is \"no.\"\nBut, what you get in that period is the sense that Harry Truman and the State Department,\nunder pressure from the British with regard to Palestine, want to explore what are the\noptions? Then in other material, you find the secret memoranda flowing out of the\nEastern countries, Poland, Sweden, Copenhagen, relating to the Zionist plot to move\npeople into the U.S. zone of Germany.\nAnd. some rabbi whose been to Poland, meets with the American Ambassador in\nStockholm and he's telling him about what he found. Anyway, you come across all this\nstuff. And some of it is suggestive of a conspiracy. I've been exploring this in order to\nunderstand what I was in the middle of, you see? Finally, I don't remember the date now,\nthere's a long memorandum, there are two I think, memorandum from Robert Murphy,\nwhose the chief political officer at the office of military government, he was Ike's*\u2019 chief\n7 Dwight D. Eisenhower\npolitical officer in Tunisia, North Africa, and he's basically saying, \"You're not dealing\nbasically with a conspiracy. You're dealing \u2014 what you\u2019re dealing with is the fact that the\nJews don't want to live in a country that was a cemetery to their people, their relatives.\nThey are fearful of the Poles because when they go back to claim property, there are\nkillings. They know that the country is going Communist, they don't want to live under a\nCommunist government. It's in this atmosphere \u2014 to get out of this that the Zionists are\nenabling. It's not a conspiracy, okay?\" So, that's at the highest level of military\ngovernment. You come in at the field level, the second most important issue for this for\nthe battalion leaders, is the infiltration.\nSo, they start passing rules that we can't give out food cards to people who haven't had\nprior food cards. We can't give out identity cards to people who haven't had prior identity\ncards. How do you think we feel if, 1f in a team, you all have to be Jewish if you're in this\nteam, you're there for social humanitarian purposes. How do you feel being told you can't\ngive out these cards to people who are infiltrating? Okay? Now, I should point out\u2014",
        "A: You feel awful. And rebellious. And you're gonna bootleg cards somehow. And, and, I\nshould tell you this anecdote. Nevertheless, under all of this pressure, twice a month, at\nmidnight, you can ask \u2014 start asking, \"When did I get some sleep?\" I would go to the\ncamp, pick up a few cops, maybe this time I've had a staff or two with me, and we would\nstart going into every building and every room and taking a count of who is there \u2014 name,\nand who is there. We were doing a midnight check and let's say, we found 2,500 people\nin the camp. The next morning, word would spread that there was a midnight check. A\nthousand or more people from all over Germany would suddenly descend on you. They\nwere in Munich to see a relative. They were in Munich to check on their papers. They\nwere here because of that, they were \u2014 you don't know which of them are telling the truth\nand who, and who 1s lying. So, some end up with duplicate cards. Okay? You're making\ndifficult decisions, right?",
        "A: No, no. I'm making two \u2014 I'm really talking about two categories. I'm talking about the\npeople who are already in Germany and who are, who are exploiting the system by\ngetting duplicate cards so they can pick up the food here and there and move it on the\nblack market and get a little cash. Okay? And the other is the fresh arrivals. Okay? And\nthe Army is against the fresh arrivals. They don't like the duplicate cards, either, but they\ndon't want any more. Because no matter what Robert Murphy at the top level says \u2014\nremember the top leadership is smarter, they're more politically connected to what's\ngoing on in the States, so they \u2014 their attitude to Eisenhower and McCloy and so it's\ndifferent at the ground. Well, let me just state something else, Katie. You're too young \u2014\nYou have to understand that in the 1930s \u2014 I didn\u2019t experience the 1920s, I was a child \u2014\nbut in 1930s and '40s there was a lot of antisemitism in the United States. A lot of\nordinary citizens had anti-Jewish feelings. They're your troops. It's reflected \u2014 if you ask\ndoctors who are, let's say, 75 years old and over, \"What was it like getting into medical\nschool in the 1930s?\" You'll hear stories. My brother \u2014 I spoke to a fellow up on the\nvineyard who's a professor emeritus of physiology at Johns Hopkins, he graduated as an\nundergraduate in the '30s, first in his class at Johns Hopkins, was not admitted to the\nmedical school. Went to the University of Maryland medical school and then sometime\nin the '50s, I guess, became the first Jewish professor at Johns \u2014 of medicine at Johns\nHopkins. There was antisemitism, this is the \u2014 people don't speak about it now. I mean, it\nwasn't violent, it wasn't virulent like in Europe and certain various places, Germany,\ncertainly Poland. But, there was lots. So when you \u2014 when, at the ground floor level they,\nthe infiltration, the infiltrees, are an inconvenience. It upsets the system. They want\ndiscipline \u2014 order, that's all an occupation force understands. I, I, I, I came across a letter\nsomeone in 1948 was asking me would I be willing to lecture at some military training\nprogram in the States as part of an effort to enrich an understanding of this. So, you come\ninto here, and it's, it's, it's tailor made for a clash. Okay? It\u2014",
        "A: Well, I want more camps. I mean it's no, no big deal. Okay? Let me, I want to address\nthis. In Germany, at approximately the time I was there, there were a few, there were\nbetween 90 and 100,000 displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons. Of these, about\n65,000 lived in camps and 25,000 lived outside of camps. In June of '46, which is\ntowards the end of my stay, with the Army now for months ranting and raving about the\ninfiltrees, don't give any \u2014 incidentally, I wasn't the only camp director or staff protesting\nthese things. The, the UNRRA people in other places were also, we used to get together\nand organize group protests against some of this \u2014 but, in the middle of June, there's a\npogrom in Poland, in Kielce \u2014 40 Jews are killed. I think in the next year, after I left,\nanother 100,000 came. These are meaningless figures when you talking, when you're\ntalking 6,000,000 dead, and 100,000 in Germany. Equivalent to one and a half percent.\nAnd if you have another 100,000, it's two-thirds of one percent, I think, if I'm doing the,\nno, it's two, two over 60, yeah, it's, no, it's two and a half percent. I mean \u2014 the proportion\nbetween what's happened here and the number of survivors, the ratios, makes the \u2014 you\nshould want more survivors rather than less. And the political system worldwide has to\nadjust to that reality. And here we are, a year after the end of the war, and these people\nare still homeless, without fresh food, I have in one of my memos an indication of some\nofficer in some group situation, in a court or something, suddenly arrests a Jew who's\nthere. And he later says he wanted to show the Germans that he was disciplining\nsomeone.\nTape #5",
        "A: Okay, I can't find that particular, maybe on the next break, I'll, I'll find it. Yeah.",
        "A: Well, you see, given the camp itself, which did not have individual kitchens \u2014 though\ngradually, people got cookers and things like that \u2014 I would have wanted them to move\ninto the German market and get fresh food a year after the end, the war\u2019s ended. What are\nwe getting GI issue for? I would have preferred that they keep looking for more housing\nfacilities. So, in a room, in the large room, of the houses, of the houses, which could be\nthe equivalent of about 350 square feet, which is smaller than 20 by 20, we could have as\nmany as 15 to 20 people living. Four or five families in double-decker cots. Families\nseparating themselves from other families by hanging blankets from the ceiling \u2014\nincluding some single individuals living in the middle of family \u2014 and people, and so on,\nand children and so on. They should have gotten more housing. Reduced the population\nof the camp to, to 2,000 from 4,000, let's say. And the food was a problem. But they,\nbasically, sometimes in a memo here and there you'll see, there are understandable\nhumanitarian reasons, but then they go on to forget that they uttered that word. And it's a\ncompletely, it was a completely different outlook.\nYou see, you also have to remember, Katie, that the GI\u2019s were fraternizing with German\ngirls and German women \u2014 widespread, extensive. The German types were more\ngemiitlich*\u00ae to them than the Jewish survivor girls and women, who were Eastern\nEuropean. So, during the day you're out 1n the field and at night you're with a German\nFraulein\u2019. I can't tell you whether it's 100 percent of the soldiers or 99 percent that so\nengaged. But, and the officers, I mean, when I was running \u2014 when I was in military\ngovernment, organizing and running that venereal disease hospital, a couple of officers\nfrom some nearby battalion, got in touch with my captain asking him to release a certain\nwoman who was their girlfriend, or one of their girlfriends, I don't remember. And I had\nto stand up to this at the time, to the captain, he \u2014 turns out he was a really wonderful\nguy, a lawyer from Florida and say, \"We can't do it. She's got to stay inside the hospital.\"\nBut, here these schmucks are bringing pressure on us to release a woman with venereal\n78 genial (German)\n*\u00b0 young woman (German)\ndisease because she's one of their girlfriends. So, this was very extensive. And, I guess,\nthe way in which I've developed temperamentally over the years, because I was a, a, what\ndo you call it, a fast achiever, a young achiever, is fundamentally, I don\u2019t suffer fools\neasily or kindly. I, I have too much experience in extremely difficult situations. I know, I\nhave confidence in my own sense of fairness and my own sense of integrity that, as\nanyone who has worked with me over the years knows, some of these truths about me,\nand I know them.\nAnd so, when I get this kind of stuff \u2014 as my own confidence builds \u2014 I get more and\nmore indignant. Maybe I was too young to be politic about some of my reactions, though,\nI don't think it was too much. There was one incidence described in the charges against\nme that I \u2014 that this officer says to me, something that they can\u2019t do better on housing for\nthe DP\u2019s than they do for the GI\u2019s. And his \u2014 and I did this \u2014 the, the charges in front of a\nfew enlisted men \u2014 and the claim is that I said to him, \"Fuck the GI\u2019s, I'm only worried\nabout the DP\u2019s\" Now, later I go and I rendezvous with this officer, and I discuss the\nsituation with him. And he denies that there were any enlisted men in the vicinity, in our\nvicinity when we had that conversation. And he also agrees that the essence of our\nconversation was that the GI\u2019s are young men, they're trained to live under very difficult\nand trying conditions, so it won't be terrible, it wouldn't be terrible if you didn't have\nquite appropriate housing for them. But, here you're dealing with survivors from\nconcentration camps that have suffered so, who aren't trained for this kind of thing, who\nare families, children, wives. You can\u2019t make a comparison between what you do for the\nGI\u2019s and what you do for the DP\u2019s. So, in effect, that conversation gets turned around as\na charge of my being uncooperative, using disrespectful language, etc.",
        "A: Katie, in the \u2014 in some of the material you have, I have, I have, I have inserted certain\nquotations from official documents that I have found in the Holo \u2014 in the National\nArchives. Which is critical of the Jewish DP\u2019s. \"They flaunt themselves in front of the\nGerman police who they know can\u2019t do anything about them. And they do various things\nwhich will incur the wrath of the German population and which will encourage them to\nfeel that Hitler after all was right.\" Now, that's an American officer writing that sentence\nin 1946.",
        "A: I, I, well...",
        "A: Well, I'm not sure that I heard those words, but I'm sure I heard things like it, and I've\nwitnessed various.... Look, look at the other thing that \u2014 another, another \u2014 we haven't\ncovered the famous riot. Well, I should precede this \u2014 though I'll come back to it \u2014 with a\nlittle bit of an outline, just so it's put into time context. I send the cable to the U.S. on the\nfood situation, \"stir up the bees,\" April 12th. Within one week to the day after that, the\nbattalion commander arrives for a five day intensive inspection. There has never been a\nfive day intensive inspection. They come for a few hours here, here they drop in, send\nsomeone else. Five days of inspection. That's undertaken on the 19th of April. And, let's\nsay it. goes 'til the 24th of April. From my memorandum, I can see, tell, that there's a very\nactive period from about May the ninth to May the 14th in which the Army 1s asking for\nmy head. With all these different charges on Zionism and so on and so forth.\nI should add, unrelated to me and unrelated to Fohrenwald, on about May the ninth,\nthere's riot in the camp at Landsberg. There's also a riot in another place, I think,\nStarnberg or something. Then on the evening of May 22nd, it's a Friday night, most \u2014 I\nand most of my team at our billets in Wolfratshausen the weekend is beginning. And,\nafter dinner we start getting messages on the phone, there's trouble here, there's trouble\nthis, someone is reported hurt at the German movie theater in Wolfratshausen. We send\nsomeone out to look at it, no trouble at the movie theater at Wolfratshausen. Then, at\nsome point, I see somebody in the car area of the house, gesticulating and so on. And, he\nsays there's trouble here, there's trouble there, I don't quite know what it all 1s, but what I\ndo at that juncture \u2014 1s I instruct two of our staff to stay at the billets in case there are\nanymore phone calls \u2014 I take two people with me. I'm going to the German police station\nto find out what's going on. I send the rest of the staff to the camp to see what's going on\nthere. OK? And here is what we discovered \u2014 and I'll tell you what this 1s, what this brief\nsummary is based on \u2014 the following morning I instructed every staff member, let's say\n20, 22, to prepare for me a chronological report of the night before, where they were a\ncertain hour, give me a half hour later, half hour later, and tell me what was going on.\nWherever they were. So I have a series of these memos which give me a panoramic view\nof the situation. And here is what happened \u2014 the sense of what happened. The essence of\nwhat happened. It's a Friday night, a couple of drunken American soldiers are going up\nthe stairs of a building in the German village. They're going to the third floor where\nthey've got a couple of girlfriends. On the second floor is a Jewish family that's living\noutside of the camp. They have some friends who are visiting them from the camp, there\nmay have been four or five people there, I don't know, remember. The American soldiers\nstop off at the second floor. And they start coercing the people, they move around with\ntheir knives or bayonets. They have their guns out. They're telling one guy to play his\nharmonica. They're asking, \"Are you Jewish? Are you Jewish? I don't like Jews,\" he says,\nand he rams one guy in the chin with the butt of a gun. Hits another guy in the head. One\nor two of these people got out of the apartment and got back to the camp. There are some\n1,000 or more people in the camp theater watching a movie in the blackness, in the\ndarkness. And one of them runs into the back of the theater, into the darkness, and he\nstarts yelling, \u201cA shchita!*\u00b0\u201d \u201cslaughter\u201d \u2014 this is the classic phrase \u2014 \u201cMe harget yiddin\nin Wolfratshausen!?'\" slaughter, they're killing Jews in Wolfratshausen.\" And the group\ngets up. Now, then other rumors start. As people are moving towards the exit, that a Jew\nwas seen kidnapped by Germans in a truck travelling south. So, people commandeer\ntrucks and they start chasing something. They start stopping vehicles, passing and taking\nGermans out and beating them up. Some start moving north. I go to the German police\nstation and I meet an Army officer there, and I tell him, we start piecing it together. I tell\nhim, \"Look, you put your soldiers a mile or three-quarters of a mile north of the camp.\nGive me a chance to contain whatever is going on.\" And, at that point, I get back to the\ncamp, and by that point, my staff and the DP, the DP police are, have a cordon and are\ngetting them back. And then we have a midnight curfew, everybody off the streets. The\nofficial report on this incident, which I find in the National Archives, I didn\u2019t know that\nthis existed at that time, describes the riot and indicates that there is evidence to indicate\nthat this riot was generated by, or in behalf of, Mr. Cohen the camp director. And there is\nno reference in his report to the American soldiers. Okay? So, what am I supposed to do?\nPassive, \"bleh, bleh.\" But, but, this riot, you see, follows by 12 to 15 days, the Army\neffort to get rid of me. So, when the riot occurs, this officer who's writing the report, is\nlinking it to the Army strategy to get rid of this uncooperative son-of-a-bitch, Henry\nCohen. Now, from my point of view, the riot and the story, you know, some of it, beating\nup the innocent Germans. I cry inside, but for me it's a symptom of how close to the edge\nthe pain still is, a year after liberation. Remember, May 22nd, the war ended May eighth\na year earlier. For me it's a sign of how close to the edge. The riot in Landsberg, the riot\nhere, the riot there. Our people are suffering. Look where they're living, look what they're\neating. Look how they're being treated. And they're living among Germans.\nAnd the Army, at that level, has absolutely no grasp, no empathy, no understanding of\nthis. It's, it's, it's unbelievable, I can't, I indicated in that memo, here we are 50 years later,\nand I can't comprehend of that Army attitude. I can't comprehend it. I mean, I, I, I'm a\nsoldier, I understand law and order, I understand discipline, I understand all those things.\nBut, for such stupid, biased, inadequate people to be running the occupation. One worries\nabout, one has to worry about a lot of other things that happen under their tutelage. See,\nit's not my combat experience where I question Army orders or anything, I feel proud to\n3\u00b0 slaughter (Yiddish)\n3! They are killing Jews in Wolfratshausen (Yiddish)\nhave been a combat soldier. Fifty years later I am proud that I was able to do that, that I\nfought in the war. What makes me sink into the ground is the American soldier at peace.\nAnd lacking, it's, it's quite possible it's different in today's Army than it was then, I don't\nknow enough about what \u2014 how they handle Haiti or Somalia, not Somalia, at Somalia\nwasn't that great. There's no seykhel*\u201d, intelligence, subtlety at work, you see. You see, in\nsome of the stuff you've read where Margaret Gerber is talking about my personal\nqualities, one of the things that she's saying is that the DP's trust him even when he comes\ndown on them, they know what's at his soul level. And they will take it when he's harsh\nwith them. And these guys don't have it at the soul level.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t \u2014 yeah, I don't know to what extent, we had a lot of social workers on the\nstaff. And, so, I don't know to what extent. You know, now we make much more to do\nabout group therapy and group process and all of that.\nBut, but, I don't have any easy visualization of it, Katie. I keep struggling with my\nwriting class as I did in certain respects with Lustig*\u2019 or with you, you'll see that, the\nwriting part is what I'm saying. I want more than the facts, Ma\u2019am, and I stay with the\nfacts. You see, where I can't tell you anything from memory, I won't, I won't speak on it.\nI can only speak on that which I can draw. If I don't remember, then I can only speak on\nthat which I can draw from my quote, unquote, \"factual materials\". And I, I, I frustrate\npeople like you no end.",
        "A: Well, one of the therapeutic things that was happening all the time were visitors. Rabbi\nHerzog\u201d, the chief rabbi of Palestine. Writers, singers, the Anglo-American Commission,\nthey come and they spend a day and they're giving people some hope that maybe they can\nhave an impact on something. If LaGuardia* sends Ira A. Hirschmann as an emissary to\nlook over things, people get hope from that. So there was a lot, a constant stream of\n>? sense, intelligence (Yiddish)\n3 Arnost Lustig\n+4 Rabbi Isaac (Yizhak) Herzog\n3\u00b0 Fiorello H. LaGuardia\nvisitors. On this particular occasion, we were visited by H. Leivik*\u00b0, a writer-poet, and\nEmma Schaver\u2019\u2019 who is a singer from Detroit.\nAnd we put on a concert, a program for a couple of evenings, and that also is lovely.\nAnyway, following the \u2014 at the end of the visit, the morning that they were leaving,\nLeivik and Schaver are having breakfast and a young girl comes in. And she walks over\nto their table and she says, \"I want to sing to you.\" And Leivik says, \"What do you mean\nsing? Do you write songs?\" And she says, \"No, I sing.\" He says, \"You know we are in a\nhurry, we are doing another camp.\" She says, \"Well, you'll come a little later.\" And\nLeivik says to her, \u201cWho are you, where are you from? Are you alone? Is anyone here\nwith you?\" She gave up on him, she goes against the wall, and she introduces the song\nshe's going to sing, the Shavler, the song of the Shavler ghetto. And it's a song about a\nmother who has to give her child away in order to save the child. It's a very sad song.\nAnd then she sings other songs. And then she's asked \u2014 then they do ask her some\nquestions about herself, and she says where she's from, she lost her whole family, she's\nall alone, she's now 15, 16, she's been to 17 concentration camps, when she was released\nshe went to a city, she developed typhus fever there and she gradually worked her way\nwest to camp Fohrenwald, and then she sings some more. And Leivik danced, Schaver \u2014\nyou know, and this is one of the experiences of their lives. For them to unanticipatedly\ncome across this. Then they come in \u2014 they're leaving \u2014 they come into my office, there\nare two women sitting in front of my desk complaining about the food, and I say to them,\n\"Look, I'm trying whatever I can do to make it better,\" and they say good-bye. Leivik, in\nleaving, says to Emma Schaver, \"He's telling them he's trying to make it better, but he\nprobably doesn't believe that himself, that he'll be able to.\"\nEnd of Tape #5\n36 Halpern Leivik\n37 Emma Lazaroff Schaver\nTape #6",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "A: I don't remember. Probably did, but I don't really remember. The \u2014 [interviewee reads\nfrom notes] \"it's the song of a Jewish, the pain of a Jewish child whose mother has to give\nher away to non-Jews in order to save her from the fire. The song is full of endless pain.\"\nAnd the \u2014 let me \u2014 on a side thing just, you know, sort of an interesting difference in\nperspective, while I take in things largely macro with incidents satisfying my macro I\ndon't focus on macro, micra. I focus on macra \u2014 the task at hand, one way or another.\nAnd, what was I coming to? It slips me. I wanted to say something to you about that....\nOh, yes! When I was leaving the camp, I let word out that if anybody wanted to write\nletters to relatives in the United States, I would take them with me and I would stamp\nthem in New York. So, I had, I came back with hundreds of letters and many of them\nwere not sealed, so I took the liberty of reading some of these letters. Not a single letter,\nthat I read, was talking about me or camp administration.\nEvery letter was micro; what was happening to me, family, who\u2019s this, that, so on.\nCompletely different perspective. So, I recognized all these years that often, what I may\ndo, what I think is for the public good, the people for whose good it is are oblivious to\nwhat I am doing. They live in their own little worlds. In my career as a university dean\nand students, the same thing applies. The students are in their little thing. They're not\nconcerned with the dean, if they happen to be somewhere where the dean shows up, they\nget up and they'll shake hands with him. Or if I phone somebody and he knows it's me, its\na respectful response, but basically, those are different worlds. And I'm aware of that.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, for one thing, one of the things in the memos that I get, is, and the district\ndirector refers to this at considerable length, how we were probably the most visited\nJewish DP camp in the zone. He was using that as an argument to tell the military about\nhow much distraction I had to cope with from task. But we were getting, we were getting\nvisitors \u2014 I don\u2019t know if every day, I can't remember, I have no calendars from that\nperiod of time, but an awful, a tremendous flow of people coming in and out.\nMilitary, one sort or another, the medical officer of the battalion going to visit the\nhospital, or this guy coming. Jewish leaders coming; rabbi, other rabbis coming, so, a lot\nof the pictures of that \u2014 I should say this, a lot of the pictures that you see at the\nHolocaust Museum and the ones that I have, are not really pictures of every day life or,\nand/or suffering, they are largely celebratory pictures; the Macabbi** games, the theatre\nperformances, the visit of the General, the visit of Rabbi Herzog, that is, they're, they are\nthe pictures are not really a representation of daily life in the camp. But, basically, I don't\nknow what time I got there, you know, eight-thirty or nine o'clock, presumably, we had\nbreakfast at our billet. Could have been one or another staff meeting, meeting with\ndifferent people, you know, you're supervising 20 people, you have the hospital, you're\nhaving group meetings, you're going out to look at this or that. Occasionally, you have to\ngo to Munich to check in or to district headquarters. I used to on occasion, visit the house\nwhere the district staff lived and have dinner there. It was an easy way, or an easy\nevening to compare notes on one thing or another. Also, there's a constant flow of\nadministrative directives that are coming in. Food, clothing, transportation. There's a lot\nof bread and butter stuff that goes on. And, incidentally, there are times when, among\nvisitors of the camp, I have pictures from Catholic charities coming with supplies and\nfood. So, they were also helping out. And then there are celebratory events. Pesach*\u201d\ncomes, you have to organize a Seder and there's a flag raising ceremony at\nHochlandslager, and who should be invited and meetings with the camp committee, in\ngroups or individually, the chairman of the camp committee who, incidentally, was a\nwonderful man. I used to always see him when I went to Israel. He passed away\nprematurely. He was, he became a high school principal in Israel. And I still see,\nincidentally, the two surviving members of the Jewish Agency staff in Israel when I go.\nAnd they're now in their 80s. And there's Amram who lives in New York, he's in the\ntravel business.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Amram Zur, Z-U-R and\u2014\n38 Maccabi World Union\n\u00b0 Passover",
        "A: Let me, I want to tell you just as a by, something happened a year, two years? Two years\nago. The two survivors in Israel, Zviah Lahar, who is a nurse, and she became the chief\nof nursing for the \u2014 one of the major kibbutz movements. She's now retired. And she lost\nher first husband in the Jewish Brigade during the war. And then she married a man, I\nforget his first name, Lahar and they live in Kibbutz Givat Brenner in Israel. And the\nother person is Liowa Lak who is really the chief of the team and a very wonderful man.\nAnd he, along the way, worked with Goldie, Golda Meir when she was in Russia and he\nwas helping develop contacts with the surviving Jewish community in Russia. Then he\nworked with some agricultural technical agency and so on. Two years ago, following the\nHebron Massacre, there's a message on my telephone from Zviah, I get back to her, and\nZviah is in tears about what happened. And she's calling me incoherently, \"Henry, come\nhelp.\" I mean, there was no logic to it. But it says something about our relationship.\n\u201cCome help, help.\" That says was that something about the sense of suffering she was\nexperiencing as a result of that massacre. And these are people who were lost in the war\nand on. And, you know, you experience what we \u2014 1.e. what Israel is now Lebanon \u2014 and\nmost of the world does not understand the complexity of that are at work here, in terms of\n\u2014 but I also, while I'm on that, let me before we were on camera, about Lustig saying to\nme, in an interview 15 years ago, \u201cYou know, Jews live in a camp. They go from\nconcentration camp or a, a camp in Germany, and then en route to Palestine, the British\nget them into camps in Cyprus. From camp to camp to camp.\" And I was thinking about\nit last discussion I heard about the choices between Peres*? and Netanyahu*! \u2014 Likud*\u2019\nLabor*? \u2014 that if the Israelis elect Peres, they will be electing a leader who because they,\nif they agree with him, will work to remove the walls of the camp Israel.\nAnd if they elect Netanyahu, they will elect a leader who builds the walls of the camp. So\nwe are still struggling with the camp metaphor, from camp to camp to camp. And I. think\nyou know where my feelings are. But, I've got to be non-political, 'cause I'm not a\nmember of any Zionist organization.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, of course, simply put, for me, the solution was that, hopefully, there would\nbe developed a state in Israel. I didn't know by what name. That all the refugees and DP\u2019s\n*\u00b0 Shimon Peres\n\u201c! Benjamin Netanyahu\n* Union (Hebrew); Israeli parliamentary bloc.\n3 Mifleget Po\u2019alei Eretz Israel\nwould go there and the camps would dissolve. I, you know, I saw some going to\nAmerica, some going to Australia, where there were relatives, and so on and so forth.\nBut, to me, the bulk would be going to Israel. There was a poll taken in the Spring of\n1946 by the Anglo-American Committee\u201d, this is from their report, they \u2014 I think this is\npart of the poll, [interviewee reads from notes] \"In our camp the vote for going to Israel\nwas about 90 percent or more. Zone-wide, 70 percent wished to go to Palestine.\" So, that\nwas the overwhelming desire at that time. I should add that Fohrenwald was actually the\nlast camp closed in Germany in about 1954. At some point in the process, I didn't keep up\nwith it, UNRRA went out of business, was taken over by the International Refugee\nOrganization.\nBut, then it was turned over to the American Joint Distribution Committee and as they\nclosed other centers, they brought surplus into Fohrenwald. And then it was closed,\nfinally, in something like 1954.",
        "A: I don't, no, I never, never got that feeling. I think people felt some element of safety there\nbecause on UNRRA, because of the Jewish Agency. There were also occasionally people\naround from the Jewish Brigade \u2014 which 1s a separate, I don't have much on it, because I\ndidn't know much about it \u2014 but, remember, they were being organized in kibbutzim,\nthere was Hochlandslager, so there were, there were organizational structures that were\nproviding some protection for people there that \u2014 and to that extent, it probably had a\nwholesome effect. I mean, if, you've seen the picture from the Maccabi games, have you?\nI mean, God, this is a year after the war, and you see these young people doing these\nacrobatics and exercises, it's nothing short of amazing. Well that's morale building\nactivity.",
        "A: I think that Fohrenwald was a completely interim matter. I know this from my own\nrelatives. I know this from other people whom I've known. They came to Israel, they\nbecame part of that country and either went to kibbutzims, stayed in Tel Aviv, went to\nJerusalem. If they were religious, they went to Ben\u00e9 Beraq you know? They were like\nimmigrants in any country, there was a period of adaptation and absorption. And\nFohrenwald is a passing experience, about which they may have some benign\n\u201c4 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine\nremembrance or not. Like this young woman, it, for some reason it \u2014 in her life it figures\nvery importantly.",
        "A: On the computer, yeah. The man who's in Los Angeles, I've had one or two exchanges\nwith him, but he hasn't felt the need to go further, so, you know, it's a very variable thing.\nI should also say that I and others who returned were writing articles about this\nexperience for three or four years after we returned. And giving speeches at different\nJewish, or other, organizations, so we were sharing our experiences then in different\nways. What\u2019s, what I find interesting now from a few friends, and I don't know to what\nextent it's reflective, but a few friend whom \u2014 to whom I've sent the speech I gave a year\nago in Great Neck, have written me saying they've shared it with their children. That 1s,\npeople in my age group have a strong need to share these experiences with our children.\nSo, they used my experience which 1s reflective of their life to a certain extent, to share it\nwith the children.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. And, I haven't had much feedback from them. They, they haven't\nverbalized feedback.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Well, we had, I don't remember the dining room area, but we had long tables all decked\nout. I don't remember who led the service. I have pictures of me with different people\nthere, including members of the team; Chaim Hoffman, who was the head of the Jewish\nAgency in Munich, was at our Seder. And, we fed them gefilte fish as far as I can recall.\nWhere we got some of the food to feed them, I don't know, I didn't ask. And there were\nArmy people there and I don't think they knew what the hell they were eating, so they\nprobably thought it was GI food also. That is, a piece of gefilte fish to them was like a\ncan of K-rations.\nThey'd never had it before, it was from some other can. Maybe they were even happy to\nhave never have had it before. But it was a very buoyant, very friendly, very lively\noccasion. And I don't remember who had the afikomen, I don't know who stole it or\nfound it, I don't remember any of that. But, we, you know, I see pictures which show\nthese group dinners, different celebratory dinners. And though, that is, our commitment\nwas to do positive things to raise morale. And we did a lot of it. You know, I don't like\nthese traumatic stories \u2014 to, to bury, the fact 1s we had hundreds of children in schools\nand teachers teaching children. We had a Yeshiva. Oh, and I came across an article,\nwhere \u2014 of Leivik's \u2014 where he devotes a piece of it to going into the Yeshiva in\nFohrenwald and it reminds him of his childhood. So, we had that going here. So, there\nwas a lot of things.",
        "A: I have deniability. No, but look, let's face it, Katie, I told you the story about my father as\na six year old boy. His mother has died, his father is remarried, he has a stepmother who\nhas two young children and he's occasionally awakened by some noise in the middle of\nthe night. And in the candle light he sees this stepmother feeding her children.\nNow, that's a guess to me, that he lived in very close quarters. So, he was experiencing in\n1897, sex among adults at night. So, I think that a lot of these people who came from\nshtetlach, really had that as part of their background. I, I've never talked to any of them\nabout it. But, it's an interesting question and it\u2019s an interesting issue. But, I think it was\nprobably going on all the time and, not only with the children hearing it, but unrelated\npeople were hearing it. For us in America, it's quite a strange kind of experience, but,\nwhen you live \u2014 what do you think Indians did in a teepee, or Italians in their little\nhovels? I think that was the world before we began building houses with more than 1,500\nsquare feet. And apartments with more, with four rooms.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: Now, give me a minute. Hi. This is a list from \u2014 of the camp that I have which lists all the\naspects of the camp and in some, in the top group, next to each, almost every line, I have\nthe staff assignments. So, [interviewee reads from notes] \"Number one, overall,\nadministration. Coordination of staff, Cohen. Personnel actions for staff, including\nvoluntary agencies, Gerber and Hafkin.\" Hafkin was my secretary, Gerber was assistant\ndirector. \"Administration of DP\u2019s in the Landkreis, \" outside of the camp, \"Oksny, \"\nwho's the Norwegian woman. \"Public relations, Cohen, Gerber, Hafkin, Robins,\" who\nwas another assistant director. \"Total space requirements for,\" I'll stop reading names,\n\"for billeting of staff for DP\u2019s, other accommodations; warehousing, laundry, etc. Sub-\ncenters; Hochlandslager,\" which was for the kibbutzim, \"and Dorfen,\" I think that was\nsome kind of sanitarium. Then \"police court, organization of street officers, registration,\nadministrative information, delegated to welfare, reports and statistics.\" Then next major\nheading, \"Physical plant; equipment, water, sewage, electrical facilities, heating,\nbuilding, equipment maintenance, road repair, radio, telephones, sign painting, etc.\ngardens.\" Once you read it, you realize what goes into this. Even, even I'm impressed.\n\"Welfare, information and tracing, group work, recreation, cultural activities, education,\nadult, children, library, religions, newspaper and radio, vocational training, religious\naffairs, child welfare, family welfare, case work including psychological, home visiting,\nhospital welfare inch, including occupied therapy.\" I don't know whether that's a typo.\n\"Employment, DP\u2019s in the Landkreis, amenity supply distribution, gardens, immigration,\nrep, supply, securing requirements from staff, uncover new sources of supply, supplies,\nreport on incoming supplies, recreation, requisitions submitted, 1tems surplus materials,\nsuggest possible uses, wooden thing.\" I don't know what \"Warehouse, storage of\nsupplies.\"\n\"Centralization of supply storage, physical distribution in case of food \u2014 bulk only,\ndetermine method and timing of distribution, periodic listing of inventories, no\nresponsible for Joint unless submitted to common pool, Joint Distribution Committee,\nhealth, sanitation, hospital, Dorfen, \" which is a sanitarrum. \"Hochlandslager, dispensary,\nsanitary inspections of kitchens, general kosher kibbutz, homes, food magazines.\" That\nmust mean food storage, not a magazine. \"Special diets; sick, undernourished children,\npregnant mothers. Street cleaning, sanitation committee, gardens, parent counseling on\nrearing babies, sex education, health education. Messing foods; planning means\npreparation of food, serving of food, cleanliness of kitchen, security of food in\npreparation. Transportation; providing vehicles as needed, allocating use of vehicles,\nsecuring vehicles as needed, keeping vehicles in repair, allocation of gasoline.",
        "A: Yeah. Incidentally, I have other handwritten notes. \"Food; conditions under which\nserved, no fresh food, compare to Germans. Black market; Hochlandslager cigarettes\nwhat roll do they play in the black market? Engineering supplies; brushes, roof paper,\nnails, toilets.\" This is a little more detail than there. \"Medical supplies;\" I think it says\n\"hormones, amenity supplies, obstetrical, requisitioning procedures, teeth.\" We'd have\nproblems with dentists. \"Sanitation supplies, housing, density, morality.\" You see? That\nmeans it went through my head. \"Lack of community space, Landkreis responsibilities,\"\nthat's the county burden, \"no clear cut definition. Clothing; sizes, U.S. clothing.\nEmployment; no incentive. Police work; extra territoriality. Abnormality requires\nintelligent rehabilitation programs. Staff billeting and moral.\"\n\"No place to go to relax. Army relations; some soldiers do not understand the almost\ninevitable and natural clash of interests and resent it. Riot, their demand for my removal,\ntransportation, encourage a system of scrounging.\" [interviewee ceases reading] So there\nare these recurrent things, Katie. I, I wanted to mention something, when all of this\ntrouble was developing, a number of us began to become concerned with one of the\nmembers of the team, a Dutch woman. Her name was Maria Van Bimbergen. She was\nsupposedly the daughter of the chief justice of Holland before the war. She had \u2014 as far as\nI know, was the only one, one the team among the women, who had an Army officer\nfriend, boyfriend fraternizing. And, as the charges kept flowing, particularly on some of\nthe more confidential issues, we began worrying about her reliability. And we began\ncomplaining to Headquarters about her. And I notice in the memos that it's in my memo,\nand I think reference to her is also in Margaret Gerber's memo to the District director.\nAnd I came across something which refers to her at a certain date, seeing her walking in\nWolfratshausen with this Army lieutenant or colonel or whatever. So, we, this was a great\nsource of concern to us. And UNRRA didn't act on it, and that was a source of concern to\nme.",
        "A: Oh, no, I didn't see it as choosing sides. I mean, some of the things that I was doing was\nalmost measured choices, if you want to say down the middle. Like, my mid-\u2014 like my\nmidnight checks. Or the \u2014 three o'clock in the morning looking for a meat, for a butcher,\nonce a month or twice a month, which left them 28 other days.\nOr my encounter with Rabbi Halberstam in down the middle. That is, I\u2014 even with those\nthings \u2014 the Army was complaining like crazy about me. But I think, incidentally, if you\nwere \u2014 which you are not going to do really, but historians will, look at the files on some\nof the other camps. Whether or not they led to the removal of the director or not. You'll\nsee similar themes being played out. Because I have folders based on meetings we were\nhaving at headquarters where we were being briefed about not handing out cards and new\ncards. On how among us we were upset by it and protesting it and so on. So, I wasn't the\nonly one. And there was, for example, at Landsberg, you had older, older people in\ncharge with more experience, like Lee Srole*? who was chief welfare officer. And they\nwould get into the New York papers and Leon, what's his name, the head of the camp, so\nthis was going on different places.",
        "A: I never had that conflict. I just, it wasn't my allegiance to America that was at issue, it\nwas my refusal to deal with stupid people. Who happened to be American. I mean that\nwas never a problem for me. If I'm dealing with a \u2014 if you\u2019re dealing with one of these\ngun groups out in the west who raise the American flag and you protest against it, it isn't\nthat you\u2019re anti-American, you're against that mentality. So, I've never had that problem.\nAnd I'm not a radical, politically. I'm a centrist. So, I don't have any problem with that.",
        "A: I think when, when one comes down to it, the most difficult thing about it was dealing\nwith the U.S. Army of occupation. Dealing with the DP\u2019s wasn't as difficult. Dealing\nwith Rabbi Halberstam wasn't that difficult. I mean, you know, the riot was difficult, but\nit wasn't \u2014 I could understand it.\nAnd, I remember once, I don't know for what reason, the DP\u2019s went on a hunger strike\nprotesting something. I convened a big meeting in the auditorium, hundreds of people\nthere, and I, I set out to break the strike. And I say to them, \"Listen, I would rather be a\nteacher in Brooklyn than director of this camp.\" And they laugh and that breaks the\nstrike. That was the relationship I had with them. That was not difficult. I had, I had\nconfidence in my ability to deal with that. And they had confidence in me. I notice in the\nstuff around the Army effort to get rid of me, that there's a memo from Becky Althoff\nwho worked \u2014 there were two memos from Becky \u2014 she worked for the Joint, attached to\nthe team, and one is to Leo Schwarz, the head of Joint in Germany, to alert him to what\nwas going on up there and enlist him in the effort to offset the Army. And the second,\nwas talking about a small group meeting to plan a strategy, a group strategy, about\n* Leo Srole\nretaining me and protecting me. And that included Becky, some of the Jewish Agency\npeople and one or two other staff people. And then they had a large staff meeting the\nfollowing morning and they wrote someone wrote a petition or something, and there are\nlike 18 signatures on the petition. So, that was not my difficulty. My difficulty was this\nanomaly of being an infantry soldier in the 39th Regiment and confronting this problem\nwith those schmucks who have no understanding. I mean, look, one of these guys comes\non an inspection during Pesach. I guess it must have been that guy who came for five\ndays. And we walk into the kitchen. Now, the kitchen is closed for Pesach. They've been\ngiving rations in one way or another. And, I walk with him into the middle of the floor in\nthe kitchen it's empty and there's a pile of human defecation on the floor. And he, for\nhim, that's a sign of poor administration and poor sanitary control. We walk to the johns\nand there's defecation in the john on the floor, maybe on the toilet seat, I don't remember.\nWe go outside and behind there against the wall, there's some defecation. The stupid guy,\nhow does he think I feel about that? I understand how he's feeling about it. But he's not\ngiving a thought, that is he's not giving a thought that, if I had my way, if I had found it\ntwo hours earlier, we would have cleaned it up. But the place was out of use for two or\nthree days at the time. So, it happened. Nobody was going in there, so we didn't find it.\nYou know, I won't tell you the whole story of this, in 1961, I am in \u2014 I'm working with\nmy Mayor Wagner's office, I'm a senior management consultant on administration and\nI'm handling health, welfare, youth and so on. The Deputy Mayor calls me up \u2014 I won't\ngive you the whole story \u2014 gives me something, \"Take care of this.\" It's about Harlem\nhospital, conditions in the emergency room. I've been in the mayor's office then five to\nsix years, so I know what weight I have, okay? And I've been heavily involved for two\nyears in dealing with various problems of hospital administration. I call the Dean of the\nColumbia School of Public Health, whom I've been working with very closely for two\nyears, and I say, \"Help me out on this one, I'll rendezvous with you at the emergency\nroom at Harlem hospital.\" We go there, I won't detail what we find. At the end of the\nevening, 10 o'clock at night, nine o'clock at night, I call the Commissioner of Hospitals at\nhis home in Staten Island, and I tell him where I am, what I have found and what I am\ndoing, what I'm going to be doing about it immediately. And he raises his voice, \"What\nthe hell are you doing there? You're not Commissioner of Hospitals, etc., etc.\" I just say\nback to him, \"What the hell have you known about this? Have you acted on it? I'm acting\nbecause of dereliction.\" Anyway, over the weekend, we took care of the problem and\n[inaudible] I report to the Deputy Mayor on Monday -\"All taken care of.\" On\nWednesday, the Amsterdam News 60 comes out blasting us because it's a crazy paper,\nokay? Ten days later, the Mayor announces that he's promoting me to Deputy City\nAdministrator and 10 days after that, he's announcing that the Commissioner of Hospitals\nhas resigned and he's appointing the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health as\nCommissioner, okay?\nSo, I sort of know what heft and weight, and so on, 1s. I didn't know it all in 1946 in the\ncamp. But, there's something in me historically, my development, which has enabled me,\nnot that I don't take crap, but gives me some inner strength not to always put up with it.\nAnd that was what was involved here. Maybe I was too \u2014 whatever. But they were too \u2014\nworse, you see. And I should add that two to three weeks after I left the camp, there was\nanother riot situation, a march on the town, and one or two Jews were killed by the\nsoldiers because they wouldn't retreat. That is, when facing a gun, they went forward, not\nbackwards and we knew that. And we knew that we had to deal with them within the\nfamily so they didn't see us with guns. And they didn't see the Army with guns. And\nwhen they saw the guns, they got hurt. And I have newspaper clippings on that incident.\nSo, I'm satisfied it wasn't a personality matter. Now, I have a memo that Ira Hirschmann,\nwho was LaGuardia\u2019s emissary, Hirschmann had been a Senior Vice President in\ndepartment stores in the '30s. He must have helped raise money for LaGuardia, later they\nbecame very close. During the war, Roosevelt appointed him with some special\nAmbassadorial rank to be stationed in Turkey, and Hirschmann was arranging for the\nescape of Jews from Hungary and Bulgaria into Turkey.\nSo, he was, in his own way, an old hand. And LaGuardia sent him over, he wanted to get\nrid of General Morgan*\u00b0 because of the British influence on the European operation. And\nhe spent the day with me. And I quickly realized he was a guy I could trust and I get \u2014\nput it all out to him. And in his memo, which is in June, \"the Army is out to get Henry\nCohen.\" He starts out, \"Henry Cohen\" \u2014 this is something I didn't get until he came across\nit 1981, and he called me about it, that he had it \u2014 \"Henry Cohen, director, who appears to\nhave done a heroic job under impossible conditions is now under fire from the Army.\nThey made an investigation here, found the sanitary conditions unsatisfactory, which is\ncorrect, and in addition they felt that Mr. Cohen was pushing the welfare side too much,\nwas neglecting the other side for the rehabilitation of the people. A devastating report has\nbeen sent to Headquarters by General McBride*\u2019, Ninth Division Commander, and they\nhave asked for Mr. Cohen's removal. The staff has protested and the entire community\nhad a mass meeting, as, as the people have developed an affection for him and his\nunderstanding of the problem. Not like the U.S. Army. It was two days after this mass\nmeeting that a riot occurred at this camp. This is a concrete example of the Army bucking\nthe job of rescue, failing to support and permit people who understand the human side of\nthe problem to function\u2019. The people in the camp chose to go on a complete hunger strike\nunless Mr. Cohen was retained. He will probably be removed by the Army.\"\n*6 Sir Frederick Morgan\n*\u201d General Horace Logan McBride",
        "A: I don't know the answer to that, Katie. What I find in my material, is a letter of\nresignation dated sometime in May, and it's a two or three page letter, and on top of it, it's\nmarked \"void.\" Then, I also note, these cables the, I mentioned to you, from Samuel,\nProfessor Samuel Joseph, Chairman of the Sociology Department, at City College,\noffering me a teaching post in September \u2014 \"Reply in by Wednesday.\" I don't remember,\nI have no indication of how I handled that.",
        "A: .. very little in my records during the month of June, all the action seems to have been in\nMay. Very little in my records \u2014 yeah, all '46. Very little in my records, other than the\nHirschmann memo, which is something like June 10th, but then, I notice a cable dated\nJune 26th from Professor Samuel Joseph, City College. \"Are you planning to return\nshortly? Have two or three courses open. Will hold up until you cable me.\" Then, in a\nmore detailed cable without a date that I can't recognize \u2014 I have the real cable, but I can't\nread the date he sent to my brother who was in Munich, nearby. In which he actually\noutlines which courses and where and what days, \"must have your answer by Wednesday\nmorning for program printing, regards.\" Alright. Let's say it's the same day, June 26th.\nJune has 30 days, 44 days. Then, I have July 10th \u2014 sorry, July 2nd, six days later,\nresignation from UNRRA. Now-",
        "A: My resignation. A very brief memo. \"I should like to inform you of my decision to resign\nfrom UNRRA, and am herewith giving one month's notice. According to our discussion\ntoday, this decision is a tentative one.\" And I don\u2019t understand that. \"However, I want all\nsteps to be taken so that in case I finally and definitely do decide to resign after a short,\"\nsomething or other, \"there will be no delay in departure.\" Okay?",
        "A: Yeah, on July 15th, which is roughly two weeks later, there's a memo which indicates\nthat I've left the camp and I'm now reporting directly at Headquarters. And on that same\nday, July 15th, I go off for seven days of annual leave to Scandinavia. And I had a\nmarvelous time. And in Stockholm, I visited relatives of one of my father\u2019s closest\nfriends. It was marvelous. I'd never been to Scandinavia before. Anyway, so I'm back\nroughly the 22nd, 23rd. My resignation is effective on August fourth. And on August\nfourth I am issued, and I think I initiate, travel authorization from Munich to Washington\nvia London. But now I'm going to give you a treat that you weren't expecting. In Paris, I\narrived for a few days en route, and, and aunt of mine had sent me the name and address\nof a cousin in Paris.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8\nSo, I go to this address and I find this Sheftel cousin running a butcher shop. And, oh,\nwas that a wonderful experience. And she has three chil\u2014 young children. They survived\nthe war in the Alps, but her husband was taken and killed. And I see these, her children \u2014\nshe died about eight or nine years ago \u2014 I see her children to this day whenever I go to\nParis. And they're a wonderful family. So, the Sheftels are really something, aren't they?\nSo, that's the end of the story. I got back, presumably, I don't know, went by boat from, I\nthink, from Liverpool, to Canada, then back to the States, so I must have arrived the third\nweek of August or so. I must have gone down to Washington, back to New York, and I\nstarted teaching in September.",
        "A: I, there must have been something in Washington, but once back in New York, I kind of,\nI was in touch with a number of Jewish organizations and have different speeches I gave\non different occasions.",
        "A: Well, I don't really know. I \u2014 you know, it probably strengthened me. I don't recall \u2014 and\nI, I'm a person who can do a lot of soul searching \u2014 I don't recall ever really soul\nsearching about the circumstances of the departure. Incidentally, I, I, my supervisor,\nHelen Matousek, I \u2014 she was in New York for many years before moving out to Seattle.\nSo, I used to see her frequently. And we rarely talked about the old days, specifically.\nShe'd been through it all with me. I should tell you, there is one little story on one of the\nmeetings out in their headquarters. After dinner, she and I would sit aside, and she said to\nme, \"Henry, most people live their lives with the glass half full. You live your life and\nmay always lived your life with the glass overflowing.\"\nSo, she had my number. Sam Zisman, was a city planning consultant, it turned out. So I\nused to run into him, he was from Texas, I used to run into him at Planning \u2014 National\nPlanning meetings and we had a good relationship. I used to see Richard Winslow. I\ndon\u2019t know if I told you this story. There was the summer of '67 \u2014 '47, by then he was the\nSecretary General of the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York, and I\nstill hadn't resolved my housing. I'd float from one rental to another, sub-rental to\nanother. And I was subletting an apartment on East 94th Street, way east, which is those\ndays was really old, old tenement. And I had a four story walk-up. And his family used to\ngo to the Cape for the summer, so anyway, somehow or other, he decided to move in with\nme. It was next door to a laundry that was spewing out a lot of smoke. And every\nmorning we'd be leaving this slum building in our seersucker suits, going to our\nrespective jobs. Roger Masteude, I was very close to him and his family for 25 years until\nhe divorced and went west and his wife went west. But, I'm still in touch with him within\nthe last month on the phone or by letter. So, I'm in touch, I've been in touch with a\nnumber of these people and, how did it shape me? I don't know, it probably added\nsomething to the experience and so on. Added to my heft in certain ways as an\nadministrator and experience and politically. What's interesting, basically, is in my\nyounger years in New York City, I really wasn't close to the mayors, with O'Dwyer*\u00ae and\nImpellitteri\u2019, but with Wagner I was. And with Lindsay~\u2019 I was. I wasn't the closest\nconfidante, but I had a personal relationship with them. And, in each of these\nrelationships, I was able at different times to talk \u2014 what I regarded as turkey \u2014 to them. If\nI felt it needed to be, certain things needed to be said, I would say them. And, I remember\none meeting with Lindsay, had some problem, and when he left the room, my then boss,\nsaid to me, \"I don't think you made yourself very popular.\"\nBut, to me it didn't matter, I had to say what I had to say. And, with Wagner, the\ninteresting thing, we used to have lunch every year or two until his death, and in 1986, I\nthink, I had, I had read a book, I had read a book about his father, the senator, and I, I\nrealized for the first time as a result of reading it, that they were an immigrant family.\nYou know, for me, he was Yale and Catholic, upper scale, and all that, I'm still the ghetto\nboy, and \u2014 but I suddenly realized that his father was an immigrant, too. And I learned\nabout the family\u2019 And it \u2014 I'd never heard him speak about it. So, I had lunch with him in\n'86, and I took this up with him. And I said, \"Bob, this is the year of the immigrant, I\nthink you ought to found \u2014 find an occasion where you can speak on the subject.\" And he\ndid. He got an award that year from CUNY\u201d!, and the first paragraph of his speech was\non his immigrant background. So, I've been able to do, to be direct. And Koch\u201d? I had\nnever worked for Koch, but if I see him on something, not recently, but I, I might say to\nhim \u2014 I did at dinner one night, in his third year \u2014 \"Don\u2019t you have anybody on your staff\nwho knows how to let people you're firing off easy? Do you have to always get PR to let\nsomeone go? What about getting it once every other time, or once every third time, do\nyou need it every time?\" Then I took up some cases with him. \"They were nice people.\nWhy did you have to do it?\" So, you know, in the old days they used to talk about, they\nused to divide people into people who have the gyro\u2014 their inner gyroscope? And I\nhappen to be a person like that. And, if you want to deal with me, you've got to \u2014 and it's\nuncomfortable \u2014 you have to put up with that part of me if you want to get something out\nof me. And I can do a lot of good things.\n*8 William O\u2019 Dwyer\n\u201d Vincent R. Impellitteri\n\u00b0\u00b0 John V. Lindsay\n>! City University of New York\n>? Edward Irwin Koch",
        "A: Yeah, you know, I was so formed in that way, that it's hard for me to see other, the other\nincrements which, I'm sure there are. But, in 1949, when I was in England teaching, I ran\ninto some of my Israeli friends, either in London or Paris or whatever. So, they arr\u2014 like\nthey arranged my trip to Salzburg and Switzerland, so they arranged, on the next holiday\nat the University \u2014 they used to run six week, trimester, six weeks in between \u2014 They\narranged for me to go on an immigrant boat from Marseilles to Israel \u2014 and Evelyn\u2019?,\nalong with me. And then, not all the time, but half the time, they were putting us up in\ndifferent places and so, I had the experience then of coming in on the Kedmah. Into the\nHaifa harbor early in the morning and seeing that Haifa amphitheater. Few people see it\nthese days because no one comes in by boat, but come in by airplane. What an\nexperience. So, I was in Haifa on the first anniversary of establishment of the state. I\nstood on a roof watching the parade and I lectured city planning at the Technion\u201d and\none or two other places. And, went to kibbutzim and they arranged for a Fohrenwald\nreunion at WIZO*, the Woman\u2019s Zionist Organization. They got announcements out in\nthe press and radio. Three hundred people turned out\u2019 So, there are these different\nincrements and I don't, I haven't subaggregated it, you know?",
        "A: No, you know, so overwhelming. You know, I remember on that particular visit, I was\nriding on a bus and suddenly a man turns at me, extends his hand, and says, \"Herr\nDirektor.\u00b0\u00ae\u2019 You know, that's a pretty heady experience. You know, you need some\ncompensation for all the \"sturm und drang.\" So, I've demonstrated I can take the \"sturm\nund drang\" and I'm entitled to some of the things that come with it. You know, it's like\ncombat, hat \u2014 I don't get much out of that, I didn't get anything out of Ninth Division \u2014\nbut what I got out of it was my own sense of inner satisfaction at having served. And, but\nit's, it's an interesting part of history because there were really so few people around and\nit tells one so much about institutions \u2014 good and bad.\nAnd, but I'm sure most of the people, whether they came to the United States, I ran across\none fellow for many years, who went into the engineering area. Another fellow was a\ndermatologist. I came across a letter just yesterday and I went to the phone book to see if\n3 wife of interviewee\n4 Israel Institute of Technology\n>> Women\u2019s International Zionist Organization\n\u00b0\u00b0 Mr. Director (German)\nhe was still around and I didn't see his name. I saw his second name, but not his first\nname. I may call some of the relatives. But, in that sense, you can't recreate it, you can't\nremember. And yet, it has to be an important part of the history.",
        "A: Oh, I'll tell you, no, it still, it's been reconstructed as a, as a, some kind of community.\nBecause Susan Levin \u2014 who was born in the camp in about 1948 \u2014 visited it about three\nyears ago. I ran into her, she told me. But, what's happened in 50 years, as in most urban\nareas, 1S that the city has spread. The urbanization has spread. The suburbanization 1s part\nof the urbanization, so I have an impression that today it, that area, is simply a stop on\nwhatever rapid transit system Munich has. So, she \u2014 yeah, anyway, she went there, I don't\nknow if she knocked on a door or not. No.",
        "A: Yeah, but I've been back to Munich, I had no interest in going back.",
        "A: Yeah, well, there was a big community center. There was a big kitchen facility. I don't\nremember now what the lateral space around the community center was. So I mean \u2014 so\npeople are talking when they're standing in line waiting for food. '\" There were programs\nin the community center and the theater \u2014 I don't know whether every night, I don't\nremember that \u2014 but, they must have been fairly frequent. On the other hand, there is also\nevidence that people didn't rely completely on the movies we were showing. They went\nto the cinema in the town. Incidentally, I, I, I neglected to say this, it hadn't occurred to\nme at the time, on the \u2014 at the time of the riot, one of the things that I realized was that\nthere would be Jewish DP\u2019s in the cinema. By the time the movie was over, they would,\nword would be getting around. I didn't know what would be happening to them when the\nmovie let out. So, we took a batch of automobiles en route to the police station, en route\nto the camp, and we stopped off at the cinema and, during a break in \u2014 when they were\nchanging the film, I made an announcement that when it was over we'd pick them up and\ntake them back. Most of them left then and there, they didn\u2019t wait for the end of the\ncinema. So, anyway, people did different things. They went to Munich, that is, they \u2014 you\nknow, I'm not \u2014 there were\u2014",
        "A: They could come and go, they, they were, they had friends or relatives in other places.\nSo, there, there was no computer, so people learned to be in touch with one another by\nconversation. I noticed in the camp newspaper there are several pages of listings of\npeople looking for people from different places. So, that was another communication\nsystem.",
        "A: Well, most people were working. Or they were in classes. The only ones, other than the\nblack marketers, but they were working, too. They were outside handlin\u00b0\u2019. Just as a word,\ny g y\nI came across in my notes, reference to the chief of police, allegations with regard to him\nand the black market came to me and I let it go. That was a big one, whatever it was.",
        "A: Yeah, I let him go. And there were some charges about the chairman of the camp\ncommittee. And I went to the camp committee and I discussed it and they suspended him.\nI don't have any further record of what happened. So, people were engaged, remember\nfood took time. You had to wait on line three times a day. Not everyone was waiting,\npeople would come back to the families. Now, there were the women and the pregnant\nwomen, and they had children. They were taking care of children. So, there were some,\nwe had, we didn't have space for a mikvah, you know that\u2019s a ritual bath. So, you know,\nthere were problems, but it isn't as 1f people were locked in space. See, that was a big\ndifference between this and the concentration camp. They had a little money, they \u2014 you\nknow, however they got it, could move somewhere or other. I don't remember how we\ndealt with the money problem. We may even have had a truck that went into Munich\ntwice a week or \u2014 for some hours. I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I guess, I guess that's part a function of the breakdown of the inner self. Now, I know no\none in this room has ever felt an overwhelming impulse to go to the bathroom, to urinate\nor to defecate. I know that no one in this room has ever had the experience of letting a\nlittle go in the underwear. But even under such pressures as that, people with an inner\ndiscipline, shoot desperately to a place where they can let go. Alright? So, one has to\nassume in these cases \u2014 not with the freezing in the winter, that was a different situation,\nI \u2014 but, here Passover, in April, one has to assume that someone or several, had certain\nimpulses and there was not enough of an inner discipline to move them to an appropriate\nplace to discharge. That's my, how else can I explain it? Can you think of another\nexplanation?\n>\u2019 trading, doing business (Yiddish)",
        "A: What do you mean?",
        "A: No. By the law of averages, no, in a normal situation, by the law of averages, there are\ntwo or three bathrooms per building, the buildings are very close, so if this is lined up, it\nwouldn't have that.",
        "A: Yeah, the starch, in the system. They were beaten down so much. They had to lose some\nof the starch. But what's interesting is on certain things they had starch and other things\nthey didn't have starch. On certain things they had stubborn resistance capability and on\nother things, they didn\u2019t. It takes awhile to reform the personality. And\u2014",
        "A: Yeah, but yet again, my vantage point doesn't enable me to see it person by person. It\nisn't the matter of it disable \u2014 doesn't enable me, my attention wasn't drawn to it person\nby person.\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "A: Well, one thing, probably, you asked me about Jewish matters before. See, I'm, I'm an\namalgam of Jewish and universalist, and, and humanist. And, I believe very strongly in\nthis. But, I also believe that one of the most powerful engines in homo sapiens is the\nexistence, and probably the necessity, for the \"We/they\" relationships. So, when I think\nabout the \"we/they\" relationships in the context of my being Jewish and universalist, it\nmeans to me, in terms of Jewishness, pride, fullness in certain ways, identification,\nvalues. But, in a certain sense, as \"we,\" we shouldn't kill them. We should find a way of\nrelating to the \"they.\" All \"they's\" should find ways of relating to the \"we's.\" So, in a\ncertain sense in the camp, the \"we\" part was strengthened, as, as against the need for\nbalance in the \"we/they\" phenomenon.\nAnd the Army that I was dealing with \u2014 which I don't generalize to the whole Army,\nbecame the they, more than the Germans \u2014 became the they, in a sense \u2014 and that\nprobably does make me feel a little uncomfortable \u2014 because for me, I strong \u2014 I believe\nstrongly that all people need to have a \"we\" relationship, but they shouldn\u2019t convert that\n\"we\" relationship into a hostile, hostility to \"they.\" You see? I mean, if you take for\nexample, that thing I went through quickly with you, about Harlem hospital, where I was\ngoing in to do a lot of good, and did, the outcome in the Amsterdam News three days\nlater, five days later was from their \"we\" into an act of aggression against the \"they.\" And\nit was so, so uninspired, so uncalled for. And, so you get this all the time, and, and\nbecause, sometimes it\u2019s because of the way in which they act. That is the Katyusha\u2019\u00ae\nrockets make our we act in certain ways. And that distresses me, even though I accept the\ncounteraction. But, I basically prefer for the walls to come down a little bit more among\npeople. Even though they need for their well-being, a \"We\" relationship. So, in, in \u2014 at\nUNRRA, because of the behavior of some of these officers and soldiers, they were\nbuilding up some of the walls in me that I feel uncomfortable with. But, hell, even Rabbi\nHalberstam had a little bit of that, right?\nSo, I \u2014 but I've learned \u2014 what I've been leafing all my life, is the complexity of the\n\u201cwe/they\" relationships. I mean, people today focus, among other things, among a million\nthings, focus on Sri Lanka. I've been watching the Sri Lanka phenomenon for 20 years,\n\u00b08 Lorry mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian)\nnow. I always find these things that are illustrations of that, that bother me, disturb me,\nbut show how difficult it is to deal with.",
        "A: This picture is me speaking to the hundreds upon hundreds of people collected for the\nMaccabi games. Which was an athletic festival in, I don't know, probably May, because\nthe weather was fine. It could have been June. And, we had hundreds of younger people\nengaged in acrobatics and all kinds of athletics and it was a really a marvelous day.\n[technical conversation |",
        "A: This is me pointing something out to General Frederick Morgan who was the head of\nUNRRA in Europe. He had been Eisenhower's Deputy British Commander during the\nEuropean invasion. He was the highest British military officer. And, and I took him to the\nhospital, there are other pictures of him in the hospital and the vocational training\nfacilities and in different parts of the camp.",
        "A: Okay, this is a picture of a Rabbi, I believe it's Yitzhak Herzog, who was the Chief Rabbi\nof Palestine. He came to spend the Sabbath weekend with us. And, the camp was just in a\nstate of exhilaration over his visit because, for the people in the camp, this was a new\nbeginning, new life. Now, I just want to point out, at his right shoulder, is an American\nby the name of Rabbi Wohlgelerinter.\nI've never, never figured out whom the hell he was representing, but he was around all\nthe time. Now, when you look beyond Rabbi Herzog's right shoulder, partly cut by his\nhat, is the Mizrachi Rabbi, I can't remember his name. He was a marvelous human being.\nWe used to call him the red rabbi because he had red hair compared to the Rabbi\nHalberstam, who had black hair. Then at Rabbi Herzog's left shoulder is Gustav\nLachman, who was chairman of the camp committee, a wonderful man. He became a\nhigh school principal in Israel. And then beyond his left shoulder is me in Army dress, or\nUNRRA dress. I should add that Rabbi Herzog was the father of Rabbi Chaim Herzog,\nwho was the President of Israel. And, some years ago when I went to Israel, I put\ntogether an album with the pictures I had of Rabbi Herzog and I got an audience with the\nPresident. And we went over it, he was a young soldier, he was approximately my age, he\nwas in the British Army, and he remembered clearly that visit of his father to Germany.\nSo, we had a wonderful 15, 20 minutes together reminiscing. This is a picture of a flag\nraising ceremony in Hochlandslager. Where we were training some three to 400 young\npeople as agricultural workers in kibbutzim. Standing in back of me is the Jewish Agency\nteam. To the right as you look at the picture, Sarah Entin passed away, unfortunately,\nearly.\nNext to her is Liowa Lak, whom I've spoken about before. And next to him is Zviah\nLahar, whom I also spoke about before. She was the one who called me after the Hebron\nmassacre. This was around Passover time. And again, a lovely occasion. What can I say\nabout this picture? The thing that I always react to when I look at a picture like that, is\nhow much eagerness and smiles are on the faces. Because that's the thing that I most want\nto see. And you see it in there, including that head in the back who is raising his chin so\nhe'll get into the picture.\nEnd of Tape #9\nConclusion of Interview\n"
