        "A: It was Paul, but in Hungarian it is Pali, PA LI. [Laughing.] So, it\u2019s pronounced a little\ndifferent, but basically it\u2019s the same name, but Hungarian style.",
        "Q: And your last name was Schlisser?",
        "A: Yes, I was born Schlisser.",
        "Q: Is that, was your family German originally?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but at one time Hungary and Austria were one under the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire. So it could have been that my family originally lived in Austria or somewhere.

        "Q: Do you know anything about your family\u2019s history in the area? How long they had been in\nAlmozd?",
        "A: No, I really don\u2019t. I know that we had an extended family. Almozd, my mother\u2019s family lived\nthere. My grandparents lived there in the village and a couple of her, my uncles, a couple of her\nbrothers lived there. And in the region around there we had a whole lot of, she had about eleven\nbrothers and sisters and they were all basically somewhere in the region. So, a big family there.\nMy father\u2019s parents, they lived, in his family they were in a different village, near the Tisza\nRiver, in a place called Butszentmihal', but we were born in Almozd.",

He bought them, plus down and that\n' Now known as Tiszavaswarda.\n2\nkind of stuff and he sold it on to people who used them to actually make shoes and you know,\nleather products. That was his, and my mother was a seamstress.",
        "Q: Did she have a, just, how did she do her business? Did she have people come and...",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. [Laughter.] I just know because my sisters told me that she was a seamstress, but\nI couldn\u2019t tell you how. I assume that she was working from the, from our house, so I assume\nthat the people would bring, you know, stuff for her to, either to measure them or making dresses\nand stuff. In those days there wasn\u2019t too many ready-made off-the-shelf dresses. Most of it you\nhad to make. So, I assume that\u2019s the way it worked, but I really, out of my own knowledge I\nreally don\u2019t know. I have no idea.",
        "Q: How many brothers and sisters did you have?",
        "A: We were four, two sisters and two brothers and I was the youngest.",

        "A: Yeah, he went to Cyprus. He was in the prison camp by the British in Cyprus. And from there\nwent to Israel in \u201848 when they declared independence. He fought there with the Palmach (ph).",
        "Q: Was your family very religious?",
        "A: My grandparents were very religious. They were very, very religious. My parents, my father, he\nwas religious, but not to the extreme. In other words, he went on, on the Sabbath he went to the\nTemple and on holidays he went to the Temple. But he didn\u2019t, you know, during the week, every\nday prayer and all that stuff like my grandparents, he didn\u2019t. But we kept all the, you know, the\nholidays and everything, Friday night and Saturday, went to the Temple and all that stuff.",
        "Q: Do you have any other memories about your early childhood? Do you remember friendships?\nDid you have Jewish friends or non-Jewish friends in the town?\n3",
        "A: A lot of friends, but I remember basically one, his name was Peter, Christian boy. In Debrecen.\nWe moved, we didn\u2019t stay. I was born in Almozd, but we didn\u2019t live in Almozd. We moved\nfrom there to Debrecen, which is about the third largest city in Hungary. That was the center for\nthe Protestant section of Hungary, because basically Hungary is a Catholic country. Only the\nnorthern part of Hungary was basically Protestant, and their center was in Debrecen and that\u2019s\nwhere we lived.",
        "Q: Why did your family move?",
        "A: When? I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Or why\u2019?",
        "A: I guess it was better for business for my father, was more central, as far as selling or transferring\ngoods. I\u2019m just guessing. I have no idea why. I guess it was just better for the family, you\nknow, more centrally located. I would assume that because the village where we were born,\ndidn\u2019t even have a train come through there. You had to go with a horse and buggy from that\ntown to the train station, which was, you know, about ten klicks (ph), which was about five miles\naway. So there was absolutely nothing there. It was strictly agriculture, you know, and so my\ngrandparents had some land there and all that. But I would assume that\u2019s the main reason. He\nstill traveled down to all the villages and bought the skins and all that stuff, but basically his\nwarehouse and all that was in the city, and, you know, where they process the stuff. That\u2019s as far\nas I can remember.",
        "Q: Did you go to public school in Debrecen?",
        "A: Ah, I don\u2019t know what the problem... I only went to one grade, okay, before the war started.\nAnd so it was, I would assume it was considered a public school, but it was a Jewish, ran by the\nJewish community. And basically all the children in the school were Jewish kids. But whether it\nwas, you know, sanctioned, whether the Hungarian educational system was part of it or not, I...\nbut it wasn\u2019t religious. It was secular and did basically, read, write, arithmetic, you know,\ngeography, all that other stuff you learn in a normal school. That\u2019s what we learned, but it was\nbasically, all Jewish children went there.",
        "Q: So was that sanctioned by the state at that point? That the Jewish...",
        "A: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, I really don\u2019t know. I assume that it was, but there\u2019s no way for me to\nknow.",
        "Q: So, that was around what year, that you moved from Almozd to Debrecen?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I could not tell you, from the time that I remember we were already in Debrecen. I\nwas about five or something like that. We were already living in Debrecen, so I could not tell\nyou when we actually moved there. I just know that I was born in \u201835 and I know we were in\nAlmozd then, that\u2019s where I was born. So, somewhere between \u201835 and, you know...\n4",
        "Q: 44.",
        "A: \u201844. Oh no, long before then. I was five, so that would be \u201840, 1940, so somewhere between \u201835\nand \u201840 is when the family moved from Almozd to Debrecen.",
        "Q: What language did your family speak at home?",
        "A: Hungarian.",
        "Q: Did you speak Yiddish at all?",
        "A: My grandparents spoke and I guess my father knew Yiddish, but we, you know the children,\nwith my mother and father we only spoke Hungarian. And when we went to the Temple, we\nprayed in Hebrew. Because it was basically memorized rote, you know. I went to school,\nseparate religious school to learn to read in Hebrew from the Bible. But at home we only spoke\nHungarian, no other language.",
        "Q: But you mentioned you had a friend who was a Christian boy. Was he a neighbor or how did\nyou know him?",
        "A: He was a neighbor. We used to play soccer together and all that kind of stuff.",
        "Q: When did you start to notice, well the Germans didn\u2019t occupy until 1944, did you notice any\nanti...",
        "A: Oh yes, it started, it started in actually about \u201843. What they called, the Hungarian Nazis, which\nwere called the Nilosh, which is the Arrow, Arrow...",
        "Q: Cross.",
        "A: ... something like that. Nilosh is basically somebody who shoots arrows. And you started\nwearing then already yellow stars and all that. At the time you just had to wear, you didn\u2019t have\nto, 1t wasn\u2019t until the Germans came in that they moved us into ghettos. But by then you already\nhad to sew on the yellow stars and all that stuff. And the Christian friends all of a sudden\ndisappeared [laughing]. They didn\u2019t know you anymore. Even if they wanted to probably their\nparents told them, you know, \u201cStay away from them, don\u2019t play with them,\u201d and such and such.\nSo, yeah. It started actually in \u00b043, but it really didn\u2019t get serious until \u201844, then when the\nGermans... and that I remember vividly, because it was Passover. We went down to my\nmother\u2019s parents. We were going to spend Passover with them. And so we all traveled down\nthere. I remember it was Passover night or the night thereafter, I\u2019m not sure which, but the\npoliceman from the village came in from Almozd. He came in and said that all Jews must go\nback to where they lived. \u201cSo, your daughter,\u201d he told my grandfather, \u201cyour daughter and her\nchildren must return immediately to Debrecen.\u201d And so in the middle of the night we had to get\na buggy and horses and go back to the train station and catch a train back to Debrecen. From\nthere they told us that we have to move into the ghetto. And so they set aside a square, I don\u2019t\nknow, about two or three square blocks, which they put wooden gates up on each end of the\n5\nstreet, blocked it off. And then windows that were looking outside from the ghetto, they bricked\nthem in, so basically you had an enclosed area of so many houses. A couple of streets, basically\nis what it amounted to. And they herded everybody in there.",
        "Q: Do you remember being herded in there?",
        "A: Well basically they told us you have so much time to, you know, to gather whatever you could\ncarry, belongings, whatever you could carry and, you know, and move in there. So, we moved\nin. And they allocated, you know, for each family a room or whatever. I don\u2019t remember now.\nSpace. And stayed there and from there they took the men to work. I don\u2019t know whatever kind\nof work they were doing. And they would come and take them off in the morning with shovels\nand stuff and then come back at night. My dad wasn\u2019t there, because he was already taken to\nlabor camp where, they called it... for the Army, basically they were in the service, but they\nwere labor battalions for the Hungarian Army which was already fighting the Russians. And I\nguess they were digging trenches for them and that kind of stuff. So he was already taken. Back\nin \u201843 he was already gone. He wasn\u2019t at home. So, he wasn\u2019t there when we were moved into\nthe ghetto, just my mother and us four children.",
        "Q: Did your older brother, was he old enough to work?",
        "A: He was there. Yeah. He was already fourteen or fifteen at the time. He was apprentice in a\nshop, they were making bristles. All kind of... have to think about how to say it... brooms and\nfor...",
        "Q: Brushes?",
        "A: Brushes, yeah, that\u2019s it. All kinds of brushes they were making in that place. He worked there\nas an apprentice. And my mother kept on sewing. That\u2019s basically what we were supported on.",
        "Q: Did you stay home with your mother during the day?",
        "A: During the time that... no, I went to the first grade, but after when we moved into the ghetto,\nnobody, I mean there was no work in the ghetto. Basically the Jewish Community was divvying\nup food, whatever... I really don\u2019t know where the food was coming from. How the allocation\nwent and all that kind of stuff. But we had food to eat, I mean, during that time anyway, we\ndidn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember being hungry or anything like that. So I guess there was sufficient\namount of food available, you know, when in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything you ate? Any of the food?",
        "A: No. [Laughing.] I guess just normal food, you know, what my mother always would fix. I\nknow used to give me, come in from playing, because you\u2019re, I\u2019m what? I was seven and a half\nyears old, eight years old? I\u2019m paying not much attention to that. She used to give me a piece of\nbread with butter on it, sprinkled with a little sugar. That was my snack. [Laughing.] Tasted\ngood to me. So as far as I know, normal food that she would normally prepare, you know, that\u2019s\nwhat we had. I don\u2019t remember... now thinking back at it, I really don\u2019t remember what we ate.\nWhat kind of food. But we weren\u2019t there that long, because once they got everybody together,\n6\nthey started cleaning out that place. Load people up and they went to Auschwitz. The only\nreason I\u2019m sitting here talking to you right now is because the fact that my father was American.\nHe was born in New York City and he never accepted citizenship, Hungarian citizenship. So\nconsequently we were protected by the Swiss Embassy. So they put us in a separate house from\nthe rest of the ghetto. There were some other families there, who were foreign nationals or\nconsidered foreign nationals. And they were protected by the Hungarian police and not by the\nGermans. And so once the whole ghetto got emptied, because we didn\u2019t know where they were\ntaking them. We were taken on train, we were taken to Budapest. And they put us there in a,\nwhat they called a protective house. Basically it was a prison, but, and part of the wing there,\nthey even had American flyers there. They were shot down. Because we seen them exercise.\nWe had no direct contact with them. But they were shot down, you know, they were bombing\nBudapest and the planes were shot down and they got captured. That\u2019s where they kept them,\ntoo. So, that\u2019s were they kept us till December 1944.",
        "Q: Do you remember being... do you remember what you were feeling during that time? Being this\nyoung boy, being afraid?",
        "A: No, no. I wasn\u2019t afraid at all. No, no. I remember they were bombing, because the house that\nwe were in was close to the central train station. And they got bombed a lot. And so we always\nhad to go down to the shelter. I don\u2019t remember being afraid, to be perfectly honest with you.\nSounds crazy, but if I was, I do not remember it as such, as being afraid. I guess at that age, you\nreally... do not comprehend, you know, what was going on. Was no reason, really, in my mind\nthere was no reason to be afraid. But no, I do not remember being afraid. Now, my sister might\nhave been, I don\u2019t know. But I personally do not remember being afraid.",
        "Q: Were you close with your brothers and sisters?",
        "A: I think so. We always did everything together, together we used to go, Sundays we used to have\nmatinee, back in Debrecen, we used to have matinee operettas, you know. And we used to love\noperettas. I was just a tiny little thing. But we used to, always save our money and go, on\nSundays we used to go to the operetta, the matinee. [Laughing.] There was a place they called\nNagy Erd6 which 1s basically a little forest area and they had a big pond there and row boats.\nAnd I remember my brother taking me there, you know, for going on the pond with a row boat\nride. That kind of stuff I remember. We did things together, I mean we were close family. Even\ntoday, every year we try to see each other. Once a year we get together somewhere, if it\u2019s at all\npossible.",
        "Q: So one sister, you said, lives in Sweden and the other in Israel?",
        "A: In Israel, right. That\u2019s where they live. Matter of fact, I just came back. I visited my sister in\nIsrael. My sister from Sweden was sick, so she couldn\u2019t join us. But that\u2019s the first year that we\ndidn\u2019t, all three of us weren\u2019t together. So, next year we are going to Sweden, so whether she is\nsick or not, we\u2019ll be there. We\u2019ll visit her. Each year we try to get together.",
        "Q: When your, when the ghetto began to be liquidated did your father come back from the labor\nforce? Or what happened to him?\n7",
        "A: No. He joined us back in Budapest. They brought him back from whatever work Battalion he\nwas in. I guess the Swiss Embassy intervened. Anyway they brought him back and he joined us\nat the protective house. That\u2019s where he rejoined us.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else about your time in the protected house? You just had to...?",
        "A: Well basically there was a lot of families there. I remember one guy taught me how to play\nchess. [Laughing.|] They had French and Italian, all different nationalities, bunch of... well, no,\nwasn\u2019t Italian, because they were, anyway, whoever were at war with the Nazis, with Germany\nand their allies. There was a whole bunch of different nationalities, I know that. I think there\nwas some French, too, Jewish, Jews.",
        "Q: Were all of them Jews?",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think so. Well, I better not say yes because I really don\u2019t know. But I think that all of\nthem were Jews. And it was just normal, I mean they would... again I don\u2019t know where the\nfood was coming, whether the Hungarian government provided the food or the Swiss or Red\nCross, I\u2019m really not sure. I remember that one time the Red Cross came to inspect the house.\nAnd I was , because I guess we were considered prisoners. I remember one, and\nthey brought some packages and stuff. I really don\u2019t remember a whole lot, detail-wise. I know\nthere were a lot of little kids and we played. The quarters were very tight, we only had, I think,\nfor the whole family, that\u2019s four of us and my father and mother, I think we only had one big\nroom for all of us. So there was, space-wise there wasn\u2019t a whole lot. And we had a window\nthat opened up on the courtyard. But it was all in four with the one gate you could come in or\nout. It was like enclosed. The hallways, the Hungarian police sitting in each hallway, armed.",
        "Q: Were they, did they treat you decently or were they cruel?",
        "A: Yes, the Hungarian police treated, you know, as far as I know they treated us decently. Okay?\nThe rough time was with the Nilosh (ph), with the Hungarian Nazis during the ghetto. And there\nthey hit you with the butt of the rifle, whatever, if they didn\u2019t like your looks or whatever turned\nthem on, you know. But at the Protective house, they did treat us decently. There was no rough\nstuff or that kind of stuff. They were pretty decent.",
        "Q: Did you ever get hit while in the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah a couple of times, but that was later on. That was around when I got to the concentration\ncamp. At the house itself there was... as far as I can, for me anyway, for my memories, I didn\u2019t\nsee any mean beat-ups or that kind of stuff. I did not see anyone when I was around. December\nof \u201844, I guess the Russian were getting too close, and then they just moved everybody out in the\nstreet. Said, \u201cEverybody out, pick up whatever you can carry.\u201d And this was in December, cold,\nsnow on the ground. And they lined us up in the street and my brother, when he heard that they\nstarted hollering \u201cEverybody out\u201d and all that, he ran down underneath to the basement and\nopened the door for the bomb shelter to the street and he got out there. I followed him. And he\ntold me to go back. I would have been with him, but he didn\u2019t go to the concentration camps.\n8\nHe took off. But he was already fifteen, obviously he couldn\u2019t worry about me. He told me to\ngo back to mom and dad, so I went back and he took off. So he managed to escape. So he did\nnot come with us.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n9\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: Tape one, side B. Where did your brother go?",
        "A: From what he told me later on, first of all he hid around there in Budapest till he managed to get\nout of Budapest. He went back to Almozd, to where he was born. He knew the people there,\nand they hid him till after the war. He worked for the farmers and all that. But they took care of\nhim, protected him and hid him. That\u2019s where he went back to.",
        "Q: What else do you remember about that day?",
        "A: Well, that day is when all Hell broke loose. There was no trains from there, from Budapest, so\nthey marched us. We walked about four days, I guess, close to a couple hundred miles, I mean\nkilometers, which 1s about... a hundred kilometers is sixty miles, so probably about a hundred\nmiles, maybe a hundred and twenty miles we walked to a rail head. And we were cold, snow and\nyoung children. And they called it a death march, because whoever couldn\u2019t keep up they just\nshot him. Dropped him whenever he couldn\u2019t go no more and killed him. Either you went or\nyou died, as simple as that. So, they marched us in the snow and ice for about, I guess it was\nfour days by the time we got to the rail head.",
        "Q: Did you have any of your belongings with you, were you having to carry...?",
        "A: Well whatever, initially we had belongings with us, but as we walked we threw, basically got rid\nof most of the stuff we couldn\u2019t carry. Just the most important necessities 1s what you kept.\nEverything else got thrown to the side of the road. And, you know, just kept on trucking.",
        "Q: Did you have any food with you? Or were you given any?",
        "A: Well each day, evening they usually had some big barns and stuff, I guess they took over from\nsome farms or whatever, they herded us in there because it wasn\u2019t that many people to begin\nwith. I don\u2019t know how many, but I wouldn\u2019t think it was more than a few hundreds, maybe four\nor five hundred people the whole, the whole thing. So, they herded us in there. And usually they\nfed us some kind of a hot soup and some black bread, you know, rye. And that was basically all\nthe food we got.",
        "Q: Were all of the prisoners foreign nationals in this group?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s all from that protective house. They were considered foreign nationals, yes.",
        "Q: So there were a few hundred people just in that one house?",
        "A: Yes, yes, in that whole complex. It was four or five stories high, I mean the building. But\nanyway, yeah, whatever was in, they emptied out, the house, the prison, whatever you want to\ncall it. They took everybody from there.",
        "Q: Was it the Germans who were evacuating and leading the march?\n10",
        "A: Yes, there was Germans and some Hungarian Nazis were working with them, but basically the\nGermans SS was in charge. They\u2019re the ones who controlled the whole thing, the movement and\nall that. So once we got to the rail head, there they separated the women and the children and the\nmen and they loaded us on separate cattle cars. And they packed us full in these cars. We barely\ncould breathe, and one little bucket in a corner for everybody to use as a toilet. And closed the\ndoors and off we went. We went... and my father was taken separately to, well all the men were\ntaken to different camps. And so they took us to Ravensbrick, that\u2019s where our first\nconcentration camp was.",
        "Q: Do you remember starting to feel afraid during that time about what was going to happen to you\nand your family?",
        "A: I never, ever can remember that I was afraid. I\u2019m not saying I wasn\u2019t, but in my mind I do not\nremember being afraid. I was more... I don\u2019t even know what I was feeling. I really didn\u2019t\nknow what was going... I guess I was just trying to survive. My main motive was, in the cattle\ncar if you don\u2019t watch it you will be trampled to death there. There were people who died in the\ncamp, I mean in the car going there. And I don\u2019t know how long we traveled in the car. But\nhonestly, I really can\u2019t tell you that I actually felt scared, no afraid. Now, I\u2019m not saying that I\nwasn\u2019t, but I do not remember that kind of feeling. Because maybe that was because of my age,\nyou know, and all that. It just didn\u2019t dawn on me that I\u2019m supposed to be afraid. I don\u2019t know.\nMatter of fact, my sister tells me and I could not verify it for you, because I don\u2019t know.\nBecause I\u2019m not remembering. But once we were in Ravensbriick, it was like they had appell,\nbasically like reveille in the morning in the Army. Everybody had to fall out of the barracks and\nline up and had roll call, you know, account for everybody. And whoever was sick had to go,\nthat whole camp was nothing but women and children. Basically women, there were a few\nchildren, but not too many. My mother had a real terrible headache and she asked for some\nmedication or something and the German whipped her with... he had one of those riding, you\nknow?",
        "Q: Riding crop?",
        "A: Yeah, he slapped her across and I went and kicked him in the shin. [Laughing.] And my sister\nsaid everybody, they got deathly still. They were afraid that he was going to kill me or\nsomething. But he just turned around and he slapped me and I went flying, but that\u2019s about, he\ndidn\u2019t do nothing else to me, but, you know. That tells you I wasn\u2019t afraid for my own personal.\nI don\u2019t remember doing it, to be honest with you. But that\u2019s what my sister told me that I did. I\npersonally cannot remember that I personally was afraid. From when we arrived at the camp\neverybody got taking all the clothes and everything away from them. And my mother had sewed\ngold coins and stuff into each one of our, because we didn\u2019t know, you know, so she divvied up\nwhat we had and sewed into our overcoats just 1n case, you know, we could use it. Maybe the\nwhole family could have been saved. My dad got hold of the farmer one of the nights when we\nstopped overnight and talked to the farmer. And he had sewed in his overcoat, a big diamond\nring and he told the farmer he was going to give him the diamond ring if he hides us, the four of\nus, the four kids and him and my mom. And he agreed, so it must have been a pretty good\n11\ndiamond ring, you know pretty big diamond. But my mom wouldn\u2019t go. She said that he might\nkill us himself for the rest of the stuff. She didn\u2019t want to go.",
        "Q: When did that happen?",
        "A: It was on the way to the rail head from Budapest. Anyway, they took all the clothes away and\nthey gave us those striped, pajama type stuff. And they cut everybody\u2019s hair, women, children,\neverything. And they gave us a shower, but it was water. It wasn\u2019t gas. And they assigned us to\nbarracks. When we went out, after the reveille in the morning, they took us out to the field to\npick beets, cattle beets. And we ate cattle beets to keep us from starving.",
        "Q: Did they give you anything else to eat?",
        "A: Basically once a day they gave you a slice of black bread and soup made from cattle beets. Hot\nliquid, but it was wintertime, was cold. That\u2019s basically what you got and while you worked out\nthere if you could sneak away some beets, then you chewed on that while you worked. And that\nwas it.",
        "Q: Did you have to work long hours? Do you have any sense of how long the days were?",
        "A: Well, they marched us from the camp out to the field. I don\u2019t know how long it took to get us\nout there. It wasn\u2019t too far from the fields. I don\u2019t remember how far. Mainly I think the\ndifficulty was walking in the snow and ice and all that kind of stuff. But we went out to the\nfields and you pulled them beets, you know? They had a cart that you threw it on. Afternoon\nthey walk you back to the camp. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s all. There might have been other stuff,\nother people picked, maybe because the younger one, the weak and all, the weaker people they\ntook to the easier, where the beets weren\u2019t that heavy. They weren\u2019t that big. Just depends,\nprobably had other kind of work details, too.",
        "Q: Did you work with your mother and your sisters?",
        "A: Yeah. I didn\u2019t every day go out with them. But most of the time they just took everybody out.\nJust brought them down and took them out. So I don\u2019t know, we stayed there for a couple of\nmonths and then one day they hollered everybody out from the barracks and they lined us up\nagain. And at the time my sister, Miriam, she was very sick and they had her in the dispensary\nover there. So started marching us toward the rail head and I remember Mama hollering,\n\u201cMiriam, Miriam!\u201d She didn\u2019t want to leave her. [Weeping.] Anyway, they loaded us back up\nagain and my sister stayed behind. From there they took us to Bergen-Belsen. We arrived at\nBergen-Belsen and they took us in where the crematorium was and maybe because I was just a\nlittle child, but there was a mountain, nothing but dead corpses piled on top of each other. And\nthe smell and everything else, and stayed over there overnight. The next day they took us and\nput us in the barracks. There was no beds or anything. They had some straw. And give you a\nsack to fill up with straw. That was your bed. So, basically you laid on concrete in the winter.\nNo food. My mother died there. Then in May, \u201945, we got liberated. The British and Canadian\ntroops actually liberated Bergen-Belsen. And then the Red Cross took us from where they found\nus, took us to hospital. We stayed there and the Swedish Red Cross took us from there to\n12\nSweden. I stayed about a year in hospital. They nursed me back to health. Then once I got out\nof the hospital, I joined my sister in the orphanage.",
        "Q: So you, I\u2019m sorry, did your mother die of typhus? Was she ill?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what she died from. I have no idea. But a lot of people during that period of time\ndied from typhus. They... I think she probably more died from starvation than anything else,\nbecause what little food we could get hold, she would feed the kids, me and my sister. I don\u2019t\nknow if she ate any or what, and so her condition... and we were susceptible to any disease that\nwas rampaging around in the place there. There was no cleaning, you didn\u2019t wash you. Any\nkind of hygiene, so who knows what would have caused it.",
        "Q: So it was you and your sister, Ilona, who were...",
        "A: Ilona...",
        "Q: .. liberated.",
        "A: ...and my mother went to Bergen-Belsen, yeah. Me and Ilona was liberated from Bergen-\nBelsen.",
        "Q: Do you remember any details about the day of your liberation?",
        "A: The only thing I remember, somebody said that they were hanging, they\u2019d seen some white flags\non the guard towers. What is the white flags? Germans put white flags on the towers. Didn\u2019t\nmean nothing to me. I don\u2019t know what the symbol, surrender, but how was... and then\nsomebody I heard said, holler something about, \u201cthe Germans are leaving.\u201d I guess they try to\nhide. You know? The camp guards all were booking. [Laughing.] So, anyway. And then the\nnext thing you know the troops, the military was coming through the camps and all that. I guess\npicking up whoever was still living. Matter of fact they took us to the German hospital. I guess\nthey cleaned it out whoever was in there. Anyway they took it over and that\u2019s where they were\ntaking us. Then they put up big, old hospital tents. That\u2019s where the children, they brought the\nchildren to, we were in a hospital, a big hospital tent. I remember that. And I guess they started\nfeeding us slowly, slowly because we had hardly any stomach left. That\u2019s what killed a lot of\npeople, I understand, is they gave them too much food too soon. Got diarrhea and all that, they\ncouldn\u2019t handle it on their bodies. So anyway, wasn\u2019t much left of me by that time. But anyway\nfrom there the Swedish Red Cross came and picked up all the children without any family and\neverything and took us to Sweden. They put us on one of those Red Cross trains and we arrived\nin Malmo. Had those white buses with red crosses on them. From there they took us to the\nhospital, Swedish hospital in Stockholm, I mean Malmo.",
        "Q: How old was, let\u2019s see, you were ten years old at that time, right?",
        "A: Nine and a half. I would be ten in November.",
        "Q: And your sister, Ilona?\n13",
        "A: My sister, she was three years older, at least three, three, three and a half years older than I was.\nSo, she was about twelve and a half, between twelve and thirteen. But she was born in\nDecember, so she wasn\u2019t quite thirteen, past twelve, but not thirteen.",
        "Q: How did the Swedish people treat you?",
        "A: Oh, they treated us very well. I mean, they were wonderful people. They cared for us. As far as\nI can remember, in the hospital anyway, they were very kind and all that. When we went to the\norphanage, I think it wasn\u2019t Swedish. I think it was run by a Jewish agency. I think it wasn\u2019t a\nSwedish government function. It was kind of tough. Started putting us back to school. But, had\none teacher who was teaching me in German. One teacher was teaching me in Polish.\n[Laughing. ]",
        "Q: Did you speak any Polish?",
        "A: I picked some up there. There were a lot of children who were Polish. So, it was pretty hard to\nlearn anything, because of all the language. Nobody was teaching me anything in Hungarian,\nwhich was the only language I really knew. But I learned there. I was able to speak pretty good\nPolish by the time I was done there, and German, too. And anyway, that was the education that\nwe got.",
        "Q: There was a school within the orphanage itself?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, they had some teachers, I guess, who were, before the war who were\nteachers. But one was a German, the other one was a Polish, that taught the subject, but in their\nlanguage, because that\u2019s the only one that they knew how to use, so. But if you weren\u2019t a Polish\nchild, it didn\u2019t mean nothing to you. What do I need to learn Polish? How to spell or whatever\nPolish. The German guy, he, I think he taught math, so that was okay, one and one 1s two, you\nknow, doesn\u2019t make no difference. As long as you understood what he was trying to say on the\nblackboard, so you could follow him fairly reasonable. Anyway they disbanded the orphanage.\nAnd by that time my sister was fifteen and she had to go out and work. They told her she has to\nfind a job and go to work. And they took me to a DP camp. I mean it wasn\u2019t a camp, it was a\nhouse in a place called Tabo (ph), in Sweden. And basically I was on my own. There was a\nwoman who was a cook there, who was basically supposed to look after me. Look over me.\nAnd they enrolled me in a Swedish school, so now I had to learn Swedish. [Laughing.] You\nknow. And went to school in Sweden. Now I went to one grade in Hungary and what little\nschooling I got there at the orphanage. And from there they started me off... I think in sixth,\naccording to my age, which was sixth grade or something like that. Sixth, seventh grade. And\nobviously it wasn\u2019t easy. But the children there was nice. They were fairly friendly for a\nstranger, you know, and all that. A couple of friends I had there. One was a little, wanted to be a\njockey. There was a horse farm not far from there. He and me used to go to the horse farm and\ntry to get, let him ride the horses and stuff. So, anyway I was there for a while. And a Jewish\nfamily came and they introduced me to them, and blah, blah, blah. They basically took me home\nwith them, in other words, they were going to be my guardians. They lived in Stockholm, so we\nmoved to Stockholm. And they enrolled me in school over there. They treated me nice, as a\n14\nmatter of fact they wanted to adopt me, but by that time I found my brother and my other sister,\nMiriam, in Israel. So I said, \u201cNo I don\u2019t want to be adopted. I\u2019m going to Israel.\u201d So, that\u2019s\nwhat I did.",
        "Q: How did you find your brother and sister?",
        "A: Through the Red Cross and through the Jewish Agency. We looked for Father, too. And I found\nmy father also. He went back to Hungary looking for us. He wrote and said, \u201cDo not come back\nto Hungary.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to the United States. When I get there I want you to join\nme there. In the meantime stay where you are.\u201d But I didn\u2019t want to stay there, so I signed up to\ngo to Israel. And my sister, I guess by that time she had a boyfriend, whatever, anyway she\ndecided she wanted to stay in Sweden. She stayed there, and I went to Israel.",
        "Q: What made you decide you wanted to go to Israel rather than staying in Sweden as you father\nhad suggested?",
        "A: Well, because I... I been always close to my older brother, and my older brother and sister was\nin Israel, so I said, \u201cWell I'll just go there and wait for them until Father gets to the United\nStates, instead of here.\u201d So anyway, that\u2019s what I did. That was in \u201849, in May \u201849, I went to\nIsrael. The Swedish family, they wanted me to stay and they were going to adopt me and\neverything. I didn\u2019t want to. And later on, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t, because that guy, my sister told me\nthat the guy and his wife got divorced. [Laughing.] So, you know, anyway, that\u2019s neither here\nnor there. They were nice people, they treated me fine. As a matter of fact, my thirteen birthday,\nmy Bar Mitzvah, they did that at the big Temple in Stockholm.",
        "Q: That was your guardians, who...",
        "A: Yeah they are the ones who...",
        "Q: ...arranged that?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But religion is not my thing. After what I\u2019ve seen, nobody can convince me\nthat faith is worth anything.",
        "Q: Did they pressure you to do the Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: No, no, no. I willingly did that. I\u2019m just saying I have no religious... I\u2019m not religious of any\nkind. I don\u2019t believe in all that stuff. That\u2019s what the war did to me. What I\u2019ve seen and\neverything. I said, there\u2019s nobody up there watching anything if this can happen here. That\u2019s\nme, anyway.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n15\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: This tape number two, side A of an interview with Paul Schlisser. So, you were just talking\nabout leaving from Sweden and moving to...",
        "A: ... to Israel.",
        "Q: ...[srael. What year did you say that was?",
        "A: That was in \u201849, May of 1949.\nD: Who paid for your travel?",
        "A: I think the... as far as I know it was the Jewish Agency or whatever. You know, Aliyah Tano\u2019ar\n(ph)which 1s basically the Jewish Agency gathering up the children, the No\u2019ar (ph), which means\nthe young. I guess they\u2019re the ones who paid for it. As far as I know. I didn\u2019t have the money\nto pay for it, so they gave me the ticket and I went. I think, basically what they did, I flew from\nSweden to France, and in France the Agency picked me up and took me to a DP camp, I guess.\nAnd from there they loaded us up on a boat. By that time it wasn\u2019t illegal anymore. The British\nwere gone. And they took us with a boat to Haifa. And we arrived and my brother was waiting\non me. We arrived like today and that evening he was already there, my older brother.",
        "Q: Do you remember that reunion?",
        "A: Yeah I remember it. We were glad to see each other and hugged and all that good stuff. I want\nto know how the trip was and how he was, how I was, how Illy was and all that. He said that\nhe\u2019s going to take me to the village where he lives. The name of it was Kfar Warburg, it was a\nmoshav. Moshav means that everybody got, owns his own land, got his own farm. And they\njust have joint, the milk processing and the equipment, the major equipment and stuff 1s jointly\nowned, but each one got his own land and his own farm that he works, that\u2019s a Moshav. So\nanyway, that\u2019s where he took me. The family\u2019s name was Lillieh (ph), they were German Jews,\nwho escaped before, during the Kristallnacht back in \u201839. They got out of Germany and came to\nIsrael. So, they are the ones who, he was with them before, when he first came to Israel. And so\nanyway that\u2019s the family, and I worked half a day and went to school half a day. So again I had\nto learn a new language to go to school. And basically we went to school in the morning and\nworked in the afternoon.",
        "Q: On the farm?",
        "A: On the farm, on his farm, yeah.",
        "Q: What were you growing?",
        "A: Well, he had milk cows. He had about fourteen milking cows, so you had to grow feed for them.\nAnd you had, he grew vegetables, tomatoes and cucumbers and that kind of stuff. Eggplants.\nCauliflowers, corn, you know, just basically, it wasn\u2019t, the land over there, you don\u2019t have no\n16\nhuge acreage anyway. You\u2019re talking about... dunam (ph), I guess, I don\u2019t know how to\ncompare it with acres. But I would say he had no more than maybe fifteen acres of land. And so\nhe had to raise alfalfa to feed the cows. One thing he didn\u2019t have to worry about, 1s that like here\nyou have to cut hay and put it away and all that, so that you would have food for the winter.\nOver there it grows year-round, semi-tropic, so you don\u2019t have to worry about not having feed\nfor them. You just have to make sure that... but we grew hay, you know, alfalfa for... and cut\nhay to feed the cows, and all that. Basically I worked out on the farm, plowed, picked tomatoes,\npicked this and picked that and weeded. All the things you do ona farm. Milked cows and all\nthat stuff.",
        "Q: I had a couple of questions from earlier that I didn\u2019t ask. I wondered if when you were with the\nfamily, the Jewish family in Sweden, if they...",
        "A: In Stockholm you mean?",
        "Q: ...1n Stockholm, if they asked you, did you talk to them, did they ask you anything about what\nyour experiences had been?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: During the war?",
        "A: No, no. They never did. And I never talked about it. As a matter of fact, you\u2019re probably only\nabout the second or third person I ever talked about, talked about it at all. First time I ever, well\nbeside Yad Vashem, you know, when we got interviewed, but that was with both my sisters there\nand they did most of the talking. And last year, the Jewish Community Center here in Louisville\nasked me to join them on Yom Ha... Remembrance, Day of Remembrance and all that, to tell\nmy story. So I reluctantly agreed that I would tell them whatever I remember. And so I did. I\nwent up there and said my piece. And that was, beside this here, that\u2019s about the only time. I\ndon\u2019t talk about it. And matter of fact, Professor Dickstein wanted me to go to one of the high\nschools and speak to the children about my experience and I declined. I said I just can\u2019t handle\nit. I\u2019m not going to constantly dig it out, dig it up. I just can\u2019t live like that. I\u2019m just not willing\nto constantly put myself through that. So, I don\u2019t, normally don\u2019t talk about it. I want to put it\nbehind me, not in front of me.",
        "Q: What made you agree to talk to me and to talk to the Jewish Community Center?",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t know. I just, I think probably the main thing that motivated me on that is I\nread in places where, especially where they had the trial in Britain about people saying it never\nhappened and all that stuff, 1t\u2019s somebody\u2019s fantasies. And I\u2019m here to tell you that it did\nhappen. And I guess that\u2019s probably the main reason that I agreed to talk about it, is that, you\nknow, people are trying to change history. And if you don\u2019t learn nothing, you don\u2019t learn no\nlesson from what happened, it can happen again. That was my biggest motivation of joining the\nUS Army, is I felt that the Russians weren\u2019t that much better than the Nazis were. They had the\ngulags, they had the camps. May not have been prosecuting Jews per se, but they were\nprosecuting human beings. That\u2019s basically what decided, probably the only force in the world\n17\nduring this period of time that could prevent something like that happening is the U.S. Armed\nForces. And so that was my main reasoning for joining the Service. I served in the Israeli Army.\nI fought in the Sinai Desert in \u201856. And so I\u2019ve been through the wringer. But that wouldn\u2019t\naffect Israel, doesn\u2019t affect the world. And probably the only force in the world at this time of\nhuman history who can make a difference is the United States and the U.S. Armed Forces. So,\nthat was my main motivation of joining the Service.",
        "Q: Another question, looking back on those days just after the war when you were a young boy in\nSweden, did you, I\u2019m trying to think of how to form the question. But I\u2019m wondering about\nwhether you, you were questioning or whether you understood why you and your family and\nothers had been singled out for this, for this horrible persecution. Did you have any\nunderstanding of what...?",
        "A: Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that\u2019s the only thing\nthat... you know. And then as I got older and I read. I\u2019m not educated very well. I finished\nhigh school GED and I got some college behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours. But basically\nI read a lot, and my understanding that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long\ntime and is basically... I don\u2019t blame any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in\nchurches and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus and this and that and always had limitation on what\nJews can do. They always kept them outside of the mainstream society. And they were\nprohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things. So\nthey were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to\ncall them. And then the church teaching basically demonized them. So, I don\u2019t think it was too\nhard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people\ndidn\u2019t, didn\u2019t care. Because it\u2019s supposed to be that most of them were Christians, supposedly\nsupposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they\u2019re teaching. But I\nguess that wasn\u2019t what, what actually happened. I\u2019ve seen them take a little baby and smash him\nagainst, his head against the wall. Kill him. And what human being would do something like\nthat? And then they go to church to pray? I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this\nworld today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion. Take a look right now. Sudan, got\na Muslim against the Christians. Northern Ireland, Catholics against the Protestants. You go to\nIndia, you got the... Sri Lanka, you got one sect fighting another and again it\u2019s religion. Iraq,\nSunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims. So every place you look at, to me anyway, from what I read\nand seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion. That\u2019s my view.",
        "Q: How does that, how does that translate to your feelings about Israel and protecting Israel? You\nfought and risked your life fighting for Israel.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s something different, because if there was an Israel before the Second World War,\nbefore... this probably, I mean the Holocaust probably never would have happened. Because\nI\u2019m not looking at it as religion, okay? I look at it as a homeland for a people. Because you can\ntake the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people. And \u2019'm\nJewish and the Bible, the Old Testament to me is the history of my people, and as such every\npeople need a homeland. And that\u2019s what motivated me. But I always consider myself\nAmerican, which is really funny, that even before the war, my dad always told me that he was\nAmerican, so I considered myself American. And he was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1906.\n18\nAnd he always told me that he is American and one of these days we\u2019re going to go back to the\nUnited States. So, it was very natural for me, once I found him and once he got to the United\nStates himself and everything, that in \u201859 I came and joined him in the United States.",
        "Q: Had his parents been American or Hungarian?",
        "A: From what I understand and I\u2019m really not positive, but it seems to me, what happened was that\nhis parents or his grandfather, 1t was him and his father, immigrated to the United States back in\nthe 1800s or somewhere, you know, late 1800s. And they lived here, matter of fact, I got an\naunt, who was born here and never left here. She\u2019s passed away now in Houston. But her whole\nlife, she was born in the United States, lived in the United States and passed away in the United\nStates. So, they lived here, I guess in New York and either during the Depression, or early, they\ndecided that they would be better off and went back. That\u2019s my understanding as to what\nhappened. And then my father was still, wasn\u2019t... his sister was old enough that she said no,\nshe\u2019s not going back with them, she\u2019s staying. My father probably wasn\u2019t old enough, you\nknow, to be on his own, so his father took him back with him to Hungary. That\u2019s my\nunderstanding, you know, is what happened. But I\u2019m not exactly sure as to what year, you\nknow, they came and what year they went back and all that. But that basically what happened.\nLike I say, probably if not for that, that he was born here, I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here\ntalking to you, because I would have wound up in Auschwitz in the gas chamber.",
        "Q: About your early years in Israel, did you feel at all... I don\u2019t know whether this 1s, well...",
        "A: Ask away.",
        "Q: [Laughing.| I had read and heard from a couple people that Holocaust survivors in some cases,\nwere discriminated against in Israel or looked down upon by people who had come before the\nwar started. Did you experience anything like that?",
        "A: No, I personally didn\u2019t. Of course, I was basically with the youth, the youth movement. It might\nhave happened in some places. I\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t. It might have. But in my personal\nexperience, like in the village where I was at, there was no, you know, down look. You pulled\nyour share. I\u2019ve never been a whiner anyway. You know, I always pull my share, whatever\nneeds to be done, Ill go take care of it. I worked and I went to school. Pulled guard duty at\nnight with everybody else. Went with the youth and learned how to use a weapon and at night\nwhen the Arabs came and stole cows and stuff, we chased after them. [Laughing.] And all that\nstuff. I was, I personally did not feel that I was in any way looked down at or discriminated. But\ncould have been better treatment? Sure, it could have been better treatment for everybody\ninvolved. But, you know, you\u2019re talking about a country just been formed, poor, wasn\u2019t a whole\nlot of anything there. And everybody did the best they could with what they had. Sure I would\nhave liked to have gone to school full time and learned something, had a degree in something, at\nleast had a trade of some kind. But I didn\u2019t expect that, it was just the way things worked out. I\ngot no complaints personally. If there\u2019s some people that say they were discriminated against,\nmight have been. I have not, my personal, maybe because my brother was already there, you\nknow. He served in the Palmach, which was their elite troops in those days in Israel. So, I was, I\n19\nguess under his protective wings or whatever. But I personally did not feel any, and my sister\nwas in a kibbutz by then, Miriam. So, I did not feel that I was discriminated against.",
        "Q: What was the name of the town or the village where you were living?",
        "A: Kfar Warburg. That was the name of it. It was in southern Israel, south side of Tel Aviv, quite a\nway down there. The whole country in four hours you can traverse it one end to the other on a\ndecent road. [Laughing.] It wasn\u2019t that, you know, that big a country. But it was to the south of\nTel Aviv, not far from Ashgelon. So, anyway.",
        "Q: When did you start serving in the Army?",
        "A: I joined the Israeli Army in \u201950... I was seventeen, so let\u2019s see, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty-two,\nso \u201852 is when I, or the beginning of \u201853 1s when I... \u201852. Because my brother had to sign\nbecause I wasn\u2019t old enough and I volunteered, so he had to sign my paper so I could join the\nservice. So it was \u00b052, was when I... I know the Korean War was still going on when I joined.",
        "Q: What made you decide to join?",
        "A: You mean the Service?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: I just wanted to serve. I don\u2019t know, wasn\u2019t nothing particular. I just wanted to do my couple of\nyears in, you know, the Service. Before that I already worked on tractors, worked down with the\nBedouins in the Negev. I plowed their fields for them. I was the only Jew. I was about fifteen\nyears old. Had a.45 on my hip, tractor and my two Bedouins who guarded me. And I was\nplowing Sheikh Suleiman, who was their Sheikh, the head of their tribe. I was plowing his fields\nfor him. I was the only Jew there. I wasn\u2019t afraid.",
        "Q: How did that come about?",
        "A: Well, the individual I worked for, who owned the tractor, he was my boss basically. I worked\nfor him. I guess he got the contract with, he got hired by Sheikh Suleiman to plow his fields.\nSo, we took the tractor down there. He left me down there to do the work, so I did the work.\n[Laughing.| Stayed there for about ten days, I guess. One night they woke me up and said,\n\u201cShhh, there are fedayins (ph) in the area,\u201d which means there are Palestinian Arabs in the area.\nSo, they woke me up, and they said \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d But they protected me. I\nmean I got no complaints. I wasn\u2019t afraid. And sure enough, not long after my boss came with a\npick-up truck to pick me up and get me out of there. They had some problems, infiltrators. So,\nanyway. I had my adventures. I helped build the phosphate pools down in the Dead Sea. We\nbuilt big pools filled up with water and then the sun would evaporate the water and leave the salt.\nYou made a lot of different product out of that. The salt is, they got potassium and they got\niodine and they got all kind of stuff in it. They make all kinds of chemicals from that. So I\nhelped build the pools down there for that. I helped build the first highway to Elath. And also\n20\nhelped started bringing the oil pipelines back up from Elath, from the Red Sea up toward\nAshgelon. That was before I left for the United States.",
        "Q: So this was all done while you were in the Service?",
        "A: No, that was during the Service and after the Service. I was in the, in the Israeli Army I was in\nthe Engineers. And the Army engineers built the first road down to Elath, first main road, paved\nroad, regular road. So, I worked on that for the Army engineers, during . And the\npipeline was after I was already out of the Army and I worked for a company, a construction\ncompany, who were building the pipeline. So, I helped that and also the, I don\u2019t know exactly\nhow you call it, the ponds, basically. They fill it up with water and let it evaporate. Helped build\nthem for the company down there, also through the construction company. I done all kinds of\nstuff in my life, as far as work. I dug ditches. I built walls from Jerusalem stone. You know, I\nbeen supporting myself since I was fourteen years old. What needed to be done, I did.",
        "Q: So, the whole time you were in Israel were you planning on coming to the United States\neventually?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Like I told you, my dad said to stay in Sweden and I hadn\u2019t seen him since the war\ntime. Well, I didn\u2019t want to wait in Sweden, so I went to Israel. And then during \u201856, during the\nSinai Campaign, the US Embassy came looking for me, they were going to evacuate me. But I\nwas already down in the Sinai, fighting, so, you know. And then they thought that I got killed,\nso they notified my father that I got killed. I come home and I check back with the Embassy to\nfind out what the status... because I was waiting for a visa. The reason it took me until \u201859 to get\nto the United States, was because there was no visas. You had to wait. Right now, all this illegal\naliens and all this stuff, and everybody says, \u201cWell, poor guys...\u201d Well, that\u2019s not so, because\nevery time you got illegal alien coming in here that means that somebody who is waiting legally,\nwants to come in, you know, he can\u2019t come in. He\u2019s waiting. So that ain\u2019t right. But anyway, I\nwas waiting for my legal visa to join my father. The only reason by \u201859 I finally got one is\nbecause in \u201856, the Hungarian Revolt \u2014 Remember that? Against the Russians, and a lot of\nHungarians got out of Hungary? So, they increased the number of visas and all that stuff for the\nHungarian refugees, and so that\u2019s the reason why about \u201859 I got, managed to get to the United\nStates. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to come earlier. It was a question that I couldn\u2019t legally come\nto the United States. So anyway, so...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n21\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: Later on I found out I didn\u2019t need all that stuff, that I have... I really didn\u2019t need a visa till if I\ncame back to the United States before I was twenty-four years old, I was automatically a U.S.\ncitizen, because I was considered an American due to my father\u2019s birth. So anyway, so \u201859 is\nwhen I got to the States.",
        "Q: Do you, what else do you remember about, what else happened during the \u201856 war?",
        "A: What do you mean what else happened?",
        "Q: You haven\u2019t talked in detail about what that experience was like.",
        "A: It\u2019s war. People get killed. You get shot at, and basically I was with the Combat Engineers\nthere. To breach the roads we had to blow up roadblocks and stuff in Rafah. I was up in the\nnorthern section: Rafah, El\u2019 Arish, Qantara, all the way out to the Suez Canal. And so anyway,\nso basically we breached the road and opened it for the armor to get through and we went\nthrough. And basically, the Egyptians didn\u2019t want to fight. We found tanks, they were still\noperational, the engine running, just left them. They just jumped out and ran out barefoot into\nthe desert. Just left their equipment there. So... they\u2019re poor , their officers\nwere partying somewhere and they left them there in the trenches. So anyway, the Egyptian\nArmy in those days anyway, weren\u2019t very strong. And anyway. We lost some people, sure we\ndid. Took a hundred hours for the whole, it took the whole Sinai Desert one hundred hours,\nthat\u2019s all, so. I did my job, whatever I was supposed to have done. I did mine and everybody\nelse. And to understand the Israeli Army you have to realize that they didn\u2019t even have\ntransportation. And guys who missed their units, they hitchhiked to get to their units, to join\nthem. You know, in those days anyway, I don\u2019t know about now, but in those days, people knew\ntheir duty and you didn\u2019t have to tell them. They knew what they had to do and it got done. So,\nit wasn\u2019t like an experience, sure it wasn\u2019t no pleasant experience. I came back, I had a beard\n[Laughing.]. And when everybody else came back, because Eisenhower forced, you know, the\nIsraelis to withdraw from the Sinai. And since I was in the Engineers, I stayed behind. And\nwhat we did, we plowed up all the roads coming back from Sinai, this a-way, and we plowed up\nall the roads, destroyed all the tracks, train tracks. We took the train tracks, blew them up and all\nthe bridges, anything to slow them down. To slow the Egyptian Army from coming back in.\nAnd so we were the last ones out of Sinai. I guess that\u2019s the reason maybe they thought that I\nwas dead, you know. [Laughing.] I didn\u2019t come home. Most everybody was coming home. I\nwas still down there. We were the last ones out. So anyway, that\u2019s the experience.",
        "Q: Had you been keeping in touch with your father during those years, writing letters?",
        "A: Yeah, we were exchanging letters, yeah. And he worked in Newark. He worked in a store as a\nsalesman and he got remarried, so my stepmother, she worked in a bakery as a saleslady. She\nhad ason. She lost one son, too, in the war. She had one son, he was with them. And he went\nto school in New York. And that\u2019s basically it. I kept in touch. And then checked, I went to get\na visa and I was working with the U.S. Consulate in Tel Aviv and finally got the visa. And that\u2019s\nit. That was in \u201859.\n22",
        "Q: How did you come to the U.S.?",
        "A: I flew, one of the Super Constellation, four-engine prop jobs. Flew from Tel Aviv to France.\nAnd something happened to the plane, and we stayed overnight in France. But the French Air,\nthey paid for my hotel stay in Paris for the night and all that till the next day. Then we flew on to\nIdlewild, now it\u2019s Kennedy. In those days it was almost new. And my parents, my dad waited\nfor me there. And they took us, they lived in Newark in an apartment. So we got there, my aunt,\nthe one who never left the States, she lived in New York in those days. No, I\u2019m sorry. No, she\ndidn\u2019t. She already lived down in Miami. His son, her son, his name was Milton. He served in\nthe Second World War as a flight engineer on one of them Dakota airplanes. He flew mission\nover the hump in Burma. So, he was a Second World War veteran. He\u2019s passed away now.\nAnd my uncle, he served in the Second World War. My aunt\u2019s husband. He was with the CB\u2019s,\nconstruction battalion. I arrived in May of \u201859. My dad said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to move down to\nFlorida.\u201d He had a \u201856 Ford, and so we drove down to Florida. We towed a U-Haul thing\nbehind us. And went to work there in... well when I was up in New York I worked for, within a\nweek, I had job, I had work. Work no problem. I have never had problem finding work. I\nworked for a chemical company, Ephart Fiber and Rubber Company. We were making erasers\nin a factory. Worked for them and then father said we\u2019re going to move down to Florida. I said,\nokay. We moved down to Florida, that was toward the end of \u201859, the winter season. He worked\nas a waiter and I worked as a busboy in a hotel down on the beach. Name of the hotel was\nSterling Hotel.",
        "Q: What was the town?",
        "A: It was Miami Beach.",
        "Q: Miami Beach?",
        "A: Yeah, and I was down there. In 1960 I got a letter saying, \u201cGreetings from your neighbors, you\njust have been drafted.\u201d [Laughing.] So, I was just barely a year in the United States and I got\ndrafted in the U.S. Army.",
        "Q: So, you were already a citizen before you came? Is that right?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know it. I came late. I waited for my visa. I thought I had to have visa and all that,\neverybody else said the same thing. I just found out, long time later that I could have just come\nas a visitor. As soon as I stepped my foot in the, if I was less than twenty-four years old when I\narrived, this way, too, I was less than twenty-four, but if I would have got to the United States\nbefore I was twenty-four, I was automatically considered just like a native-born American. I\ndidn\u2019t even need a visa. Nobody told me and I didn\u2019t know. The only reason I know now ts\nbecause the Justice Department represented me against the Germans in... what do you call it?",
        "Q: Restitutions?\n23",
        "A: Damages, restitutions, yeah, under the Prince litigation. They would only represent people who\nwere, that were considered to be U.S. citizens during the war, okay, and on. And I was, by the\nJustice Department\u2019s own... so the Immigration Service don\u2019t know their own laws, basically.\nBut anyway I had to wait till \u201859 till I got visa to get to the United States.",
        "Q: How did you feel about being drafted to the U.S. Army?",
        "A: Well, I really didn\u2019t have no bad feeling about it. I felt that if 1 wanted to become a citizen of the\nUnited States it\u2019s my obligation to serve, you know, I felt, my country. I had no problems with\nthat. So the only problem I really had was, you know, to me, basic training and all that was no\nbig deal. I been through all that. [Laughing.] So, that was no big deal for me. But anyway,\nlanguage, I wasn\u2019t speaking that well English during those days yet. I had a good friend, went to\nbasic training together, his name was James B. Smith, J.B. He was from North Carolina. And he\nbasically took me under his wings and he was teaching me English. Anytime I was saying\nsomething that wasn\u2019t right, he would usually correct me and all that stuff. He was like, Mutt\nand Jeff? He was tall, skinny guy, you know, and I was short, stocky. And you didn\u2019t have to\nlook far, 1f you seen one of us there the other one wasn\u2019t too far away, was somewhere nearby.\nSo we became really close friends. I\u2019m a godfather to one of his daughters. Even today we still\nkeep in touch. So we really been good friends. That was when I first, you know, got in. The\nonly thing I didn\u2019t like about it, after basic training and advanced individual training. We both\nwere straight leg Infantry and they sent us to Germany. [Laughing.] Sent me right back to\nGermany, so that\u2019s the only part, that was kind of rough on me, you know. I got over it anyway.",
        "Q: Did you consider, do you think they that would have considered your case if you had objected\nand asked to be posted somewhere else?",
        "A: They might have, I never tried. I\u2019ve never been the kind that wanted special treatment or, you\nknow, special consideration or what have you. I\u2019ve never, ever used my, all the twenty-some\nyears in the Service, I\u2019ve never used my personal experience to try to get something different or\nspecial consideration or anything else. I never asked. I never even thought about asking for\nspecial consideration because of that. They sent me, I went and that\u2019s basically it.",
        "Q: Did you have to mingle at all with Germans?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t have to. Basically the U.S. got its own bases. There\u2019s some Germans who work\nthere on post, but you know, you don\u2019t have to mingle with the German population. You got PX,\nyou got snack bar, you got movies, you got a club. You got everything on post that you would\nneed. So for a long time I didn\u2019t go downtown. After a while I said, well, you know, go\ndowntown and look around, whatever, you know. You can\u2019t lock yourself away. Don\u2019t have to\nbe friends with anybody, but you can\u2019t... and after a while you can\u2019t blame a whole nation for\nwhat happened, it just doesn\u2019t make sense. So I mean I don\u2019t love them. [Laughing.] God\nknows I don\u2019t love them. But I have no particular hate for the Germans. You can\u2019t hate a\nwhole... if you had a specific individual that you knew was... you could hate them. But to me,\ndon\u2019t make no sense to hate a whole nation. I mean it just doesn\u2019t make sense. But anyway.\n24",
        "Q: Did your other buddies in the Army wonder why you weren\u2019t going to town or did they mostly\nstay there at the post as well?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if they wondered or not. They never asked me personally, you know, about it. A\nlot of them, there was a lot of American guys that didn\u2019t go downtown. You know, so I don\u2019t\nthink that was particularly strange. If you knew what we went through, then you wouldn\u2019t, you\ndidn\u2019t have time. I mean Monday morning, you put your gear on and you marched out to the\ntraining area and you trained all week out in the training area. And then you came back\nThursday night, sometimes late at night and then you cleaned your weapons and stuff after\nmidnight before you even got to bed. And the next morning you had PT, you had classes, you\nhad this and that and then you had, Saturday morning you had a full field inspection. So you had\nSaturday afternoon and Sunday, that\u2019s all you had. Then Monday you went back to the field.\nSo, day and a half, I mean you had to ask who wants to go running around? There were a whole\nlot of other guys who didn\u2019t go a whole lot. Some ran around out to the night, the guesthouses\nand stuff, looking for German girls and all that kind of stuff. But you know, it wasn\u2019t unusual\nfor guys not to go out. You only had about a day and a half to rest and relax. So, I don\u2019t think it\nwas anything particular.",
        "Q: Did people in the Army with you know that you were Jewish?",
        "A: Oh yeah. I went to, matter of fact, I used to get Saturdays off, Saturday mornings off, while they\nstood full field inspection. I had to lay my stuff out, but I didn\u2019t stand by my bed while the\ninspection was going on. I went to the Saturday morning prayers in the chapel, Jewish Chaplain.\nI went to, Friday night and Saturday morning I went to Chapel for services.",
        "Q: So, you did have some faith at that point, some sense of...?",
        "A: Well, I never denied that I was Jewish, my Jewish identity. Everybody that knows me, knows\nthat I\u2019m Jewish. I\u2019m not hiding anything. I\u2019m just... what I\u2019m saying is that I have just... and I\nbelieve in God, don\u2019t get me wrong, even to this day. But I just do not believe that God really\ngives a hoot about any particular individual, you know. Something created this world. But I do\nnot believe that he cares about any particular individual, any... you know, which a lot of faith\nsays that, your personal, whatever, savior or He cares for you, whatever. In my view He don\u2019t\ncare for anybody. He created and it\u2019s up to you to, you know, to do the best you can. He\ncouldn\u2019t care less about anything at all.",
        "Q: But would you actually pray when you went to services on Saturday morning?",
        "A: No, not really. I would listen to the sermon and all that stuff, but. No, I don\u2019t think I really\nprayed. I don\u2019t think I ever prayed since before the war. Well, I did when my father died. And\nwhen I go out to the... me and my step-brother, we usually meet once a year. We go down to\nFlorida because both my father and his mother is buried 1n cemetery there. And so, yes I say\nprayer for the dead at his grave. That I do, not because I believe, but because, to honor him, you\nknow, but it\u2019s not the same. So anyway. That is just me.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism at all in the U.S. Army?\n25",
        "A: Yes, well there were always some, who hated everybody, you know. I really, didn\u2019t bother me\nany. I mean they didn\u2019t bother me personally, but I heard them talking, you know. I guess some\ndidn\u2019t know I was Jewish initially. Jewish jokes and this and that. But that, it didn\u2019t bother me\nany, and once they knew who I was, they won\u2019t do it in front of me. Once they knew I was\nJewish they did not tell jokes in front of me or anything like that. I don\u2019t know whether out of\nrespect for me or they knew if they did then me and him going to go to Fist City. I don\u2019t know\nwhich. [Laughing.] Anyway they did not. So, I personally I really can\u2019t tell, say that... I wasn\u2019t\nprosecuted or anything. I wasn\u2019t threatened or anything in that sense. Insensitivity? Sure, but,\nyou know, that\u2019s everyday life. Doesn\u2019t bother me any. Once they knew I was Jewish, then I\ndon\u2019t ever, never remember a guy twice telling jokes in front of me. And if he was a buddy of\nmine, then fine. I got a Jewish joke for you. I says, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d But that was\nfriendly banter not out of malicious, you know, hurtful type of thing. So that\u2019s quite different.\nNo, I can\u2019t, honestly can\u2019t say that I was in any way discriminated or treated unfairly or\ndifferently because I\u2019m Jewish while I was in the Service. I really, honestly can\u2019t say that. I\ndon\u2019t know maybe I was just fortunate, you know, the units that I was with. Or you know, what\nI can answer... matter of fact, once I had a Jewish Ist Sergeant. I had a Jewish guy working for\nme later on when I got up in the grades.",
        "Q: Did you, well you kind of, you entered the Army at time when...",
        "A: Cold War.",
        "Q: Cold War and I\u2019m just wondering how you saw that and then also I know there were so many\nissues going on about civil rights for African-Americans. And I know the Army was one of the\nfirst really to integrate...",
        "A: No, that was before me. I mean integration started before I got into the Service. The integration\nstarted with Truman during the Korean War. Prior to the Korean War he ordered the Army to\nintegrate its units. Because before you had separate black, separate... but we had a lot of racial\nproblems even when I first got into the Service in the sixties. As a matter of fact, we had a race\nriot and we had fights, racial fights and that kind of stuff. Because, you know, for me, since I did\nnot, wasn\u2019t raised with black, first time I ever seen blacks was when I got to the United States. I\nhad no prejudice. I wasn\u2019t raised with any kind of preyudice against anybody. So, I basically, as\nI always, I would take an individual for himself. You know, I rate an individual for the\nindividual. If he deserve respect, he got respect. If I didn\u2019t care for him, whether it\u2019s white,\nblack, whatever, then I didn\u2019t care for him. It wasn\u2019t because of his race. It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t\ncare for his character or his behavior or, you now. That\u2019s the way, you know, it was for me. But\nwhen I got in in 1960, you had a Brown Boot Army. I don\u2019t know if you understand what a\nBrown Boot Army was. But Brown Boot Army, you had... basically, we had, like, our\nCompany, we had a room that was empty. There wasn\u2019t a stitch of furniture, anything, it was an\nempty room. If you had any problem with anybody, you and him just went into the room and\nsettled your business with your fists. That\u2019s the way things were done. We had a Platoon\nSergeant, his name was Cooper. He was half Indian and half Irish. And he was about 64\u201d and\nweighed about two hundred thirty, somewhere around there. And you messed up and he\u2019d take\nyou into the room there and put you through the woodshed. So he had a very well behaved\n26\nPlatoon. Everybody worked together. You can\u2019t legislate away prejudice. That\u2019s something\nthat you learn at home from your parents, from your society, from your parents, whatever,\nchurch, whatever. What you can do with the Army 1s, you force civility. Regardless of whether\nyou like him or not, while you are 1n the unit and while you are in the Army, you treat him the\nway you expect to be treated. And later on when I became a Platoon Sergeant, whatever, that\nwas my guiding principle. I didn\u2019t care whether... I say, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you like him or not.\nThat\u2019s neither here nor there. You two work together, perform the job, be civil to each other.\nOnce you get to know each other maybe you like him.\u201d You know what I\u2019m saying? That\u2019s all\nyou can expect. You can\u2019t legislate love or you can\u2019t legislate racial prejudice away. That\u2019s\nsilly to even think about it. Just like now, all this silly thing about the gays and all that stuff. I\ndon\u2019t hate gays. Bible says that\u2019s wrong, but I would want to know if anybody in my unit was\ngay that I had to fight with. I might have to, he might have to give me mouth-to-mouth\nresuscitation. Or I had to go to the shower with him, if I know he is gay I would be\nuncomfortable. Not a question that I hate him. That question doesn\u2019t make no sense, because in\nthe Service you live so close together, you know? There is no little shower stall where you go in\nin your privacy. They got one big room with a bunch of shower heads where everybody takes\nshowers. And guys just feel uncomfortable when they know somebody is gay. And that\u2019s the\nproblem, not that anybody has anything against gays. In my view anyway. And you got AIDS,\nyou don\u2019t want to have to deal with somebody out in the battlefield if you get shot if you know\nhe is gay. You\u2019re going to deal with it, try to patch his wound, which you have to do. And then\ncatch AIDS from him, you know. Those are the issues that people don\u2019t think about when they\ncondemn the Armed Forces, well they\u2019re preyudice or whatever. There\u2019s a lot more to it than\nthat.",
        "Q: Were you surprised at all by some of the racism that you found in this country that is founded on\nprinciples of equality?",
        "A: Yeah, I was surprised. You know, because... I really didn\u2019t realize it till I got to this country due\nto the fact that I never encountered any black people. So when I worked for Fiber, for Ephart\nFiber and Rubber Company, they had blacks there and all that. I was friends with, I treated\nthem, like everybody with respect just like I treat everybody else. I got to be friend with one of\nthem. But I noticed that every time like when you sit down to eat or this and that or lunch, or\nwhatever, you would see all the whites congregating. All the blacks would go sit over there.\nThere was no interaction between the races. That kind of struck me funny. So, I sit down and I\nsit down with...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n27\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interview with Paul Schlisser.",
        "A: So anyway, the Fiber... I worked with a fellow worker who was black, and when everybody\nwent to lunch I noticed all the whites were sitting on one side and all the blacks were sitting\nsomewhere else. And the guy I worked with, he sat down to eat lunch. I just got my lunch and\nsat down beside him. He kind of looked at me a little funny. I didn\u2019t realize there was anything\nwrong with it, because, you know, I had no idea it was not supposed to be that way.",
        "Q: Did you keep on sitting with him after that?",
        "A: Sure, yeah, every morning, every day lunch we usually, he and me, we\u2019d sit down and have\nlunch and talk. He was asking me about Israel and I was telling him about Israel. [Laughing. ]\nAnd you know, he would tell me about what they were doing in Newark, his neighborhood and\nall that. Yeah, I mean, you know, we became friends.",
        "Q: Where were you posted in Germany?",
        "A: My first tour I was Bamberg. I was with the Ist Battle Group, 15th Infantry. And that\u2019s the\nsame outfit that Eddie Murphy was in the Second World War. The most decorated individual in\nthe Second, Third Infantry Division. And Eisenhower was in the same outfit, at one time\nCompany Commander a long, long time ago. So, it\u2019s a famous unit and I served it two years in\nthe Straight Leg Infantry.",
        "Q: And you were on another tour in Germany later?",
        "A: At the time I got out... I was draftee, so when I finished my two years I got out and went home,\nback to Miami and looked around and decided I was going to go into heating and air\nconditioning. And so I went to school and then I had to work. And I said, \u201cWell this ain\u2019t going\nto get it.\u201d No time for myself or anything else. Went to school, from school you went to work\nand next morning got up, went to school, went to work. You had no time for yourself, nothing.\nSo I said, \u201cWell I\u2019m going to go back into the Army, this time voluntarily. I\u2019ll make the Army a\ncareer.\u201d Because I liked the Service, its purpose. And during that time we went up to a place\ncalled L.Z. X-Ray, which is now longer classified anyway. But it was up on the\nCzechoslovakian border and there was a bridge there that was mined. And you went up there,\npulled your duty for a month at a time. And if the balloon ever would go up, or the East\nGermans would attack the West, the job was to blow up the bridge. It was all mined and all that.\nSo then I realized, I seen the border and all that, I realized that this whole, back basically, the\nRussians were back to where the Nazis were. Plus I read, I don\u2019t know then or a little later,\nSolzhenitsyn\u2019s book about the gulags and all that. And I said, heck, they\u2019re no better than the\nGermans were. So anyway I decided I was going to go back into the Service. So, I re-enlisted\nand lo and behold they went and sent me back to Germany. [Laughing.] That was my second\ntour in Germany. We were sent to Kaiserslautern and spent three years there. It was an Army\nDepot. I went into the maintenance field there. Then I came back, went to the 18\" Airborne\nCorps in Bragg, North Carolina. And from Bragg, North Carolina there was a little altercation in\n28\nthe Dominican Republic. There was a Leftist uprising and they had to send in the 82\u2122 Airborne\nand I was with the 556 Light Maintenance Company and we were in there for support. My\nplatoon went in to support the 82\u2122 in their operation in the Dominican Republic. That was \u201865.\nCame back from there, our unit was declared D-1, which means that we were alerted that we\nwere going to get shipped to \u2018Nam. So we had to pack everything, all the equipment of the unit\nand all that stuff. That was going on, the deadline rates which means the equipment,\ninoperability of a lot of the equipment on post at Fort Bragg got so big that they told us to unpack\nour stuff and go back to work. [Laughing.] So, we went back to work and then they started\ntaking individuals. Like me, they took me, not me, but from the unit just individuals and shipped\nthem to Vietnam. So 1966, I was sent to Vietnam. I was there in the Central Highlands for a\nyear. And say well I\u2019m just going to go back to the States and get shipped back here again, so I\nmight as well extend. So, I extended, got promoted and was sent to the Korean Tiger Division,\nsupport of the Korean Tiger Division, along Highway 1, between Bomber 2 and Elza English\n(ph)*. Anytime the Korean Tiger went out on a sweep and destroy, we went with them in\nsupport of them. In \u201868 I came back to, from \u201866 through \u201868, I was in Vietnam. I came back\nfrom Vietnam in, I think it was November \u201868 and was assigned to Fort Knox. I reported in, in\nDecember \u201868 to Fort Knox and I became an instructor in the Armor School.",
        "Q: About Vietnam, you had, you had by then already fought in a war and then been through a war\nas a victim and the war you fought in you obviously had, in Israel you felt passionate about the\ncause. And how did you feel about the cause in Vietnam? By that point were you, were you...?",
        "A: No, I was all for the war. I believe we did the right thing. And I still believe we did the right\nthing, actually. Except you can\u2019t fight a war when the people are not with you. To me that was\nthe thing, because we were justified in what we were doing. I mean the North Koreans were\nattacking the South and it proved, I mean, it shamefully, the reporters and everything, they all\ntwisted everything to suit their views. But in fact, we were right. The North Koreans basically,\nif not for us, they probably would have gobbled up all of Southeast Asia, the Communists. They\nwound up, years later, they took over Cambodia. Laos, they already controlled. So basically the\ndominant theory was right, even though the reporters disputed it. So, we stood up against the\nCommunists. And that\u2019s eventually after Reagan, finally they collapsed. But we basically\ncontained them and that was Truman\u2019s policy, containing the Communists from spreading. If we\nwouldn\u2019t have opposed them, heck probably over two-thirds of the world today would have been\nall in the communist top. You know, so, in my view we did the right thing. I know a lot of\npeople opposed it. And I got called a baby killer when I came back on leave from \u2018Nam. After\nmy first year there I extended, so they gave me thirty days\u2019 leave. So I came in, in Fort Lewis,\nWashington and everybody said, \u201cChange clothes. Get in civilian clothes, don\u2019t go out in the\nairport in the clothes.\u201d I said, \u201cI fought for this country in these clothes, it was my uniform. [Il\nbe doggone if I\u2019m going to change clothes. I\u2019m going home in uniform.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re crazy,\nyou\u2019re crazy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Anyway I went and I went to Seattle to the airport and there were\nHare Krishna and all them other ones. And, \u201cBaby killer!\u201d I went and punched him in the mouth\nand knocked him down. [Laughing.] A cop was standing there looking, he didn\u2019t, he just\nsmiled, he didn\u2019t say nothing. And I just kept walking. Don\u2019t call me no baby killer. I never\nkilled no baby. I came home in my uniform, and I hauled back to \u2018Nam after a month leave, but\non my uniform and went back. I believe firmly in, you know, I\u2019m not hiding. I think we did the\n? Schlisser was with E-Co 43\" Sig BN, in the Binh Dinh mountains of the Central Highlands.\n29\nright thing. I know a lot of people disagree. But it\u2019s not true. We didn\u2019t lose a single battle in\n\u2018Nam. Nota single, they can\u2019t point to one single engagement that the United States Army or\nthe Marine Corps, the United States Forces lost. Not a single one. Every battle that we fought\nagainst the North Vietnamese we won. But they made it out that we lost, and we didn\u2019t. The\npeople who lost is the comm... the politicians here in Washington. Because they first of all tied\none hand behind your back and said you can only fight with one hand. And you don\u2019t go to war\nthat way. It\u2019s ridiculous. So anyway, so yeah, I thought it was justified. I was for the Vietnam\nWar and I still say it was justified. Everything we found out up to now it just reinforces my view\nthat we were justified in doing it. Not the way we did it. Now, I agree we should never have\nfought the way we did. We should have gone in with the purpose of winning and we should\nhave won. The way you did that is you gone into North Vietnam and kicked their butt and got it\nover with. Instead of just, you know, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t get into Cambodia, you can\u2019t bomb this,\nyou can\u2019t do that.\u201d You can\u2019t fight no war that a-way and win. Crazy. Just like, you know, I\nwas interviewed by WAVE 3 TV. They wanted to know about Kosovo, what my views were. I\ntold them, I said, \u201cWell I\u2019m not talking for the Jewish community. You want my view, I'll talk\nfor myself. My view.\u201d And I said, \u201cFirst of all, anybody said that is a genocide 1s a liar. There\nwas no genocide in Kosovo.\u201d And now it\u2019s proved out, it\u2019s true. There wasn\u2019t any. Sure, I\u2019m\nnot saying there wasn\u2019t atrocities. But there\u2019s a big difference between atrocities and genocide.\nI told them, \u201cI wish they would have taken my family and put them on a passenger train and take\nthem to the border and put us off. All of us would have been together.\u201d You know. I don\u2019t call\nthat genocide. Sure they killed some here, killed there, but that\u2019s atrocities they did to scare the\npopulation so they would run. That\u2019s a long ways from genocide. Now Cambodia, that was\ngenocide. Did anybody open their mouth and say anything or do anything, where it really\ncounted? No, they didn\u2019t. You know. To me, we have no business in Kosovo, that stuff been\ngoing on now for hundreds of years. And even while we sitting there, you know, they killing\neach other. The minute we move out of there, we be there a hundred years from now, we be still\nsitting there to keep them apart. They need to settle themselves. And same thing in Bosnia.\nBosnia, I don\u2019t care what anybody says. The minute European forces get out of there, United\nStates and NATO get out of Bosnia, they\u2019Il be right at each other\u2019s throat. And they say Kosovo,\nyou know, ethnic cleansing. Well, where were we when Croatia forced out over half a million\nSerbs? We didn\u2019t say a word, so what 1s the difference here? The Croats I hate. They were with\nthe Nazis. I mean they were allies to the Nazis. We caused, the United States caused most of the\nstuff that\u2019s going on in Balkan now. It\u2019s our fault. Okay? When Croatia, when Tito died and\nCroatia was the first one to declare that they are, their independence. Without asking any\nquestions, anything, right away we jumped in and recognized them as independent country.\nOkay? Well, they murdered a quarter of a million Serbs during the Second World War,\nincluding, plus Jews. The Croats. Okay? You think that the last of the Serbs are going, who\nlive there, are going to agree to come again under the rule of the Croats? You got to be crazy. I\nmean, you got to know the history of the world before you meddle. And if you don\u2019t understand\nwhat the history 1s, they got no business meddling in there where you don\u2019t know what the hell\nyou're doing. That\u2019s my view anyway. I\u2019m very upset about it, because I don\u2019t think that, you\nknow, we had any business in there at all. But anyway, when they asked me I told them, I said\nthere was no, you know, genocide there. There might have been atrocities, but there\u2019s no\ngenocide from what I consider, you know. They were comparing it to the Holocaust.",
        "Q: Is that why they were asking you, because they knew about your history?\n30",
        "A: Yeah. They had, they taped the thing when I was talking at the Jewish Community Center on the\nRemembrance. So they knew my background. So they came. I told them I\u2019m not talking for the\nJewish community. You know, matter of fact, I\u2019ve had very little contact with the Jewish\ncommunity, but if you want to know my opinion, personal opinion, I\u2019ll gladly tell you what I\nthink. And that\u2019s exactly what I told them. So, anyway.",
        "Q: Did you, how long did it, it\u2019s pretty clear that you had to really believe in this country and in its\nfounding principles in order to do the kinds of service that you\u2019ve done.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you have that right away? Is that something that you came to this country with or is it\nsomething that developed?",
        "A: No, I came with it to this country. I\u2019ve always believed that the United States represents the\nfreedom of the Free World. In other words, even as a, when I was, right after the war in Sweden,\nyou know. And some of the children in the orphanage, whatever, they were for the Russians, the\ncommunists, Left inclination. We always had big argument, even as a little boy then, and I was\nalways defending the United States, because I felt, you know with my dad being from, born here\nand everything, I felt, you know, as an American, [Laughing.] even though I had never been\nhere. Anyway, I felt a kinship and I always believed that the United States basically represents\nthe human freedom. And I still do, you know. And it\u2019s fine with me. I have no problem with\nsomebody like Joan Baez and all the other ones who opposed the war. That\u2019s why we fought. I\nmean, they have the right to speak their view. They\u2019re Americans and I respect their views. I\nmight not agree with it, but I respect it. I cannot expect, accept somebody like Jane Fonda, who\nwent to North Vietnam, you know, with North Vietnamese troops and there was prisoners of war\nin the Hanoi Hilton and stuff. And they went in to look at them. Any show that she is in, that is\nnot on my TV. I will not. Pll turn the station. I will not have anything that Jane Fonda has\nplayed in, movie, whatever. It may be the greatest movie in the world. It\u2019s not going to play on\nmy TV.",
        "Q: You think the people who were protesting the war just didn\u2019t understand the nature of war itself?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. They were misled in my view by the reporting that was going on here. Obviously\nnone of them wanted to go to fight. And so if you don\u2019t want to go to fight, what do you do?\nYou oppose and you riot and you do everything else you can to get out of it. I don\u2019t know what\nthe motive... I\u2019m not setting any alterior motives. It might have been very noble motives for\nthem to oppose it. I\u2019m not condemning anybody. I respect Muhammad Ali. He opposed the\nVietnam War, but he had the courage of his convictions. He stayed in this country. He said I\nwon\u2019t fight because I\u2019m not, you know, whatever. And was willing to go to jail if he had to for\nwhat he believed in. I respect that. I cannot respect someone like Clinton, you know, who did\neverything he could to stay out and then he lies about it. You know, what kind of principle is\nthat? He\u2019s not a principled person to begin with. That\u2019s my view. I always voted. Every\nelection I always vote. I believe in participating. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m just reading a book\n31\nabout the history of Democracy in the United States, from back before the colonies, how the\nDemocracy developed. Just reading the book right now.",
        "Q: When and how did you meet your wife?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. [Laughing.]| I was stationed here in Fort Knox in \u201869, the beginning of\n\u201869. And I had a friend, Larry, and he was from Bristol, Tennessee. And he would always ask\nme to go home with him. And I said, \u201cNah, I don\u2019t want to go. What do I go over there for? I\ndidn\u2019t lose anything there.\u201d So months later his car broke down and he had no way... he was\nmarried and his wife was back in Bristol. And he had no way to get home. So, I said, \u201cYou\nknow what? All these months you\u2019ve been asking me to go with you home and all that, so Pll\ntake you home this weekend.\u201d And we come back... I worked with him on his car, trying to get\nit fixed. We couldn\u2019t get it fixed in time. So, I said, \u201cWell, Pll take you home.\u201d That\u2019s the way\nit went. So he stopped on the way home, telling his wife that he\u2019s bringing me, says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t\nyou get him a date while he\u2019s there?\u201d [Laughing.] Okay. That sort of guy. That\u2019s the exact\nway it happened. So we got there and then Helen was, that evening, we got there late in the\nevening, late in the afternoon. That evening went out to the VFW Club to dance and drink.\nAnyway, she was there. And then, that was April, and I think a week or ten days later or two\nweeks later was the Kentucky Derby. So, Ray\u2019s wife was going to come up here, so Helen said,\n\u201cWell, Pl come with you.\u201d You know, so, \u201cOkay,\u201d so, one thing led to another. So that\u2019s how\nwe met. [Laughing.] It\u2019s one of those freaky, unintentional, you know, something that you\nnever...",
        "Q: When did you get married?",
        "A: In July of \u201869, so I think about three months after we met.",
        "Q: What kind of ceremony did you have?",
        "A: Just a civil. She wanted a church wedding. Her pastor wouldn\u2019t marry us because I was Jewish\nand she was Presbyterian, whatever. [Laughing.| So we had just a civil service, civil ceremony,\nwhich was fine with me. I didn\u2019t want no church wedding anyway or any kind of religious\nceremony, anyway. So we just had a civil marriage, you know.",
        "Q: You said a little earlier how you really, haven\u2019t talked much about your history during the war.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you talk with your wife at all about it during those early days?",
        "A: No. I told her I was in concentration and stuff, but I never mentioned anything about it, no. I\nthink the first time she ever heard it, is was when Dr. Dickstein, Professor Dickstein was here\nfrom the Shoah Foundation for the interview. I think that was the first time she ever heard\nanything about it. I don\u2019t talk, not just to her, I just don\u2019t talk about it, period. I want it behind\nme, not in front of me. I don\u2019t want to live... my sister been twice in the nuthouse, the one in\n32\nSweden. She lives in the past all the time, that\u2019s what she lives in. She can\u2019t get over it. I don\u2019t\nwant to be like that.",
        "Q: You feel like in a way like looking back too much would make you less healthy mentally?",
        "A: I get nightmares, my dear. When I talk about the stuff, for a week after that I got nightmares\nevery night. I didn\u2019t tell you all kind of stuff that I could have told you, but I don\u2019t want to,\nbecause I don\u2019t want to dig it up. I seen old man get shot right in front of me, old guy with a\nbeard, looked like my grandfather. On the march to Budapest he couldn\u2019t walk, just shot him\nlike nothing. I just, you know, doesn\u2019t do nothing good. And I can\u2019t deal with it. I can\u2019t live\nlike that with the nightmare constantly on my mind. I just put it behind me. I closed it down as\ntight as I can close it down and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m willing to step forward when she asked me to, you\nknow. And like I said, the main reason I did that because I feel that at least I got to go on record\nthat it did happen. That it\u2019s not somebody\u2019s fantasy and it\u2019s not, you know, somebody made it\nup. People say that it didn\u2019t happen. That it did happen. So I felt that was my obligation do, but\nthat\u2019s all. I mean I\u2019m not going to be living in that. I refuse to do that. I\u2019m just not...",
        "Q: I respect that. I don\u2019t want to make you feel like I am pushing for something that you don\u2019t want\nto talk about. Of course, you know what you\u2019re willing to talk about and what you\u2019re not. But I\nalso was, I\u2019m interested, you had mentioned a little earlier that you\u2019re not very, you\u2019re not very\nconnected with the Jewish community here in Louisville?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m not. I think I know a total of two, three people, beside Professor Dickstein and her\nhusband. I know Doctor Freiger, he\u2019s a psychiatrist at the UL, University of Louisville, Mr.\nGrossmann and a couple of workers at the Jewish Community Center. And that\u2019s basically all\nthe Jewish people that I know here in Louisville. Because most of my friends are from the Army\nand none of them are Jewish. And I probably wouldn\u2019t fit in very well with my views and my\nway of thinking. I wouldn\u2019t fit very well in with the Jewish community to be perfectly honest\nwith you.",
        "Q: I was interested because I think in some places where you have a large, I mean for example,\nwhen I\u2019ve spoken with Holocaust survivors who live in New York City, where there are many\nother Holocaust survivors, they tend to really...",
        "A: Get together?",
        "Q: ...band together more. Whereas I think a lot of the people I\u2019ve talked to here are more, you\nknow, just leading their own lives and it\u2019s not as important to them to have that.",
        "A: No, to me, I don\u2019t search out other Holocaust survivors. As a matter of fact, I met a lady at the\nmeeting with, what\u2019s his name?",
        "Q: Martin Goldfarb... Goldberg?",
        "A: Yeah, that she was from the same town as me, Debrecen. And she was also a survivor. And she\ndidn\u2019t know my family, because I was too small to remember. She was, must have been,\n33\nprobably my sister\u2019s age, maybe a year or two older than her during that time. We talked. But\nshe was also liberated in Bergen-Belsen. But no, I don\u2019t have any, first of all, it\u2019s too far away\nfor me to drive all the way out there just for programs and stuff. There is no connection between\nme and my view of things and... most of the Jewish Community Center, they\u2019re mostly\nAmericans, who were born here and raised here. Who have never been through anything like we\nhave. There\u2019s absolutely no connection between us that, you know, that we can... see my life\nexperience is different than most of theirs. So, we have really nothing in common. I\u2019m nota\nbusinessman. I\u2019ve never been in business, never plan on being in business. I couldn\u2019t sell you a\nglass of water if you were dying of thirst. I\u2019d give you a glass of water, but I wouldn\u2019t sell it to\nyou. I\u2019m just a different type of person. So I just, wouldn\u2019t fit in there. I go off to my own little\ndrum. I\u2019m involved with the veterans of this state.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n34\nTape 3, Side B",
        "Q: Tape three, side B. You work with the...",
        "A: I work with the veterans of this state. I volunteer for Kentucky Center for Veteran\u2019s Affairs as a\ncounselor, veteran claim, help file claims and that kind of stuff. I\u2019m also Vice-State Legislative\nRepresentative for Non-Commissioned Officers Association. So, that keeps me busy. I\u2019m an\nofficial briefer for my association out at Fort Knox. I go out to the units and give them classes\non VA benefits and that kind of stuff. I do volunteer work under the Retirement Service Office\non Post at Fort Knox. And every time I have a Second World War veteran, I can help them it\nmakes me feel good. Even though I wasn\u2019t liberated by American troops, but you know, I know\nthat he had a hand in liberating me, you know. So I\u2019m glad when I can help one of them. So,\nthat\u2019s what I do. I try to help veterans as much as I can. That\u2019s my thing.",
        "Q: When did you retire?",
        "A: I retired medically in \u201883. I had two heart attacks and I had my colon removed. The VA rated\nme at two hundred percent, not a hundred. They can only get a hundred, but if you add all my\nstuff together, you get two hundred percent. I was exposed to Agent Orange. They sprayed that\nstuff down on me. We\u2019re watching this thing fly over us and spray. We were underneath it. So,\nyeah, I\u2019m basically a hundred percent disabled rated since \u201884, June, July of \u201883. That\u2019s when\nthey removed my colon. I\u2019ve got a plastic bag. That didn\u2019t stop me. I just keep on trucking.\n[Laughing.] I\u2019m a tough dude. I\u2019ve got diabetes. Nobody in my family has diabetes, never had.\nAgain now it comes out, there\u2019s a study going on that shows that guys exposed to Agent Orange\nhave twice or three times as high a chance of getting diabetes as the normal population. So, I\ndon\u2019t know if that\u2019s what caused it or something else, but anyway. So, I got heart disease. I got\ncolon gone. I got diabetes. Taking about twenty-some pills a day. But I ain\u2019t quit. I\u2019m still\ngoing. I\u2019m sixty-five, will be in November and until God lets me stay around I will do the best I\ncan and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: You have one child?",
        "A: One son, he\u2019s adopted. He\u2019s not mine. I adopted him. He was my wife\u2019s child. He was just a\nyoung boy, and his name is Anthony Keith Schlisser. I don\u2019t have any children of my own.\nAnyway, not that I know of.",
        "Q: Did your son ever ask you about your past? Do you ever talk?",
        "A: Yes. We talked about it. With him I talked about it, not in particular details, just in general\nterms, so that he\u2019ll understand where I\u2019m coming from. And what my views are and why I got\nmy views the way I got them and all that. Yeah, we are pretty close, him and me. We\nunderstand each other. We are good friends. We are close.",
        "Q: Do you have anything else that you would like to say that I haven\u2019t asked you about?\n35",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I like Kentucky. I made my home here, and I feel like I\u2019m a Kentuckian.\n\u201868, ve been living here off and on just about. Since \u201883 when I retired, I\u2019ve been living here\ncontinuously since then.",
        "Q: What do you like about it?",
        "A: The open space. I hate cities, people on top of each other. I like feeling the open space. I like\nthe country. And I like the hunting and fishing, used to, I\u2019m not much able anymore. I used to\nlike to go out fishing and hunting. I like country music. I like Bluegrass. [Laughing.] Weird\nfora Jew, right? But anyway... I used to square dance. I\u2019m just me. I\u2019m not anybody else.\nThat\u2019s the things I like. I also like classic. I like operas. So.",
        "Q: Did your family understand and respect your decision to marry...",
        "A: Marry my wife Helen? I never asked anybody. I never told them I\u2019m marrying. I never ask\npermission. I married. Yeah, they accepted her. You can probably ask her about that, but I\nthink they did. My dad loved her. My dad once he got to know her, he loved her and so did my\nstep-mother, she also loved her. But I really didn\u2019t, you know, I really didn\u2019t care because it\u2019s\nmy choice. It\u2019s my life and I have to live it, not them. If they didn\u2019t like it, tough. That\u2019s the\nway I felt about it. You know, I know a lot of people want to be loved and all that good stuff,\nbut me, I just go with what I think is right. That\u2019s what I do.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think we mentioned on the tape, but your wife is Presbyterian? Is that what you said?",
        "A: I think she is. I dare not say that for sure. [Laughing.] I think, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what she is.\nShe\u2019s a Christian, anyway. But I think she is... not Lutheran. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s a\nPresbyterian.",
        "Q: And she practices? Goes to church and keeps up with that?",
        "A: She used to. She used to. When we go down to home, her home church, she goes to church on\nSundays with her brother, who is a deacon in the church and all that. I don\u2019t go with them, but\nshe goes. And even when we first got married, she insisted I go with her. She won\u2019t go, she by\nherself and blah, blah, blah. So for a couple times I went with her, just out of respect for her and\nher family. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable though. And I told her, I said, \u201cLook, that\u2019s your faith, not\nmine. Not that I... you want to go, you go. I have no problems, you know. Ill gladly take you\nthere and Ill gladly come and pick you up.\u201d I tried to talk her into going here to church if she\nwanted to go. I'll gladly take her and there and bring her home gladly. Have no problem. Just\ndon\u2019t ask me to go. And so from now, she goes with her brother and stuff and it\u2019s fine. Yeah,\nshe believes, she\u2019s got faith, which is fine with me. I have no quarrel with anybody who has\nfaith. It\u2019s just me and my views. I don\u2019t push my views on anybody else. I respect everybody\nelse\u2019s faith as long as he practices and don\u2019t expect somebody else to do it. You understand\nwhat I\u2019m saying? Don\u2019t force, don\u2019t try to push iton me. Your faith is your faith and I respect\nyou, you and your faith. But that\u2019s your faith and don\u2019t try to convert me or push me or get me\nto... you know.\n36",
        "Q: Was there ever a point where you felt it would be important to you to marry a Jewish woman?\nWhere your Jewish identity was important enough to you that you felt like you had to do\nwhatever you could to carry on the tradition?",
        "A: That\u2019s a tough one. I guess at one time, at one time, yes. I guess at one time that occurred to me,\nokay. But... I shouldn\u2019t say this, but anyway. While I was in the military in Israel, okay, we\nwere on duty in the Jerusalem sector. It wasn\u2019t a war, it was after. The Jordanians still had the\nold city. And to go to our post we had to go through a section of Jerusalem called Mea Shearim,\nwhich means \u201ca hundred gates,\u201d which was the ultra, ultra, Orthodox. And every time we had to\ngo through there to switch reliefs, you know, we had to go through their section, their\nneighborhood. And on Sabbath we used to go through there with a vehicle. They used to stone\nus. Okay? So I looked at this and I said to myself, what\u2019s the difference between the fanatics,\nthe Jewish fanatics and the Ayatollah fanatics and all the other fanatics? There\u2019s not one iota\ndifference between them. They\u2019re all zealots for whatever their faith is. So, I reverted back to\nwhat I told you initially. I believe in Israel, beneath the country, for no other reason is the Jewish\npeople as a nation have a homeland. But for me, not for religious purposes. There\u2019s, like I was\nthere visiting my sister in, you know for Passover this year. And there\u2019s such a conflict between\nthe real religious and the non-religious there, you know. It\u2019s crazy. You believe in your faith,\npractice it. Leave the other people alone. If they believe in... my sister is like me. She doesn\u2019t\nbang her head against the wall. She believes in God and she holds basically all the Jewish\nholidays. She has to because it\u2019s national holidays. But she\u2019s not religious, goes to Temple all\nthe time and all that stuff. Everybody has a right to live their own life the way they see it\u2019s fit.\nAnd that\u2019s what I believe in. I believe in everybody should do, if I respect you... my neighbor\nhere is a very religious Baptist guy. A wonderful guy, wonderful friend. He\u2019s been friend with\nme now for thirty years, since we\u2019ve been here. We\u2019ve been real close friends. We help each\nother. Anything I got he\u2019s welcome to it and the same with him. Anything I need, if I needed\nhelp, he\u2019d be there. I know he would. That\u2019s how good of friends we are. And I respect him.\nHe goes to church on Wednesdays. He goes to church on Sundays. He\u2019s a church elder. I\nrespect, I respect my brother-in-law, you know. It\u2019s their faith, it\u2019s fine. He never try to force,\nyou know, push his stuff on me. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Everybody should... and I believe if you\nhave a faith, you should live it. Not go to church on Sunday and then cheat people on Monday.\nThat\u2019s my principle, that\u2019s me. What you hear, what I say is what I mean. That\u2019s always been\nmy, I don\u2019t say something that I don\u2019t mean. If I tell you I was going to do something, you can\nput in the bank that I was going to do it. Except if I\u2019m dead or laying there paralyzed where I\ncan\u2019t move. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. If I promised to do something, I will do it. My word\nis my bond, basically. With me, you can shake hands with me, that\u2019s just like a contract. If I say\nsomething I was going to do, I\u2019m going to do it. And that\u2019s all there 1s to it.",
        "Q: I imagine that\u2019s been very helpful to you in your career in the Army, because that\u2019s important.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, it has. And I think I\u2019ve been doing okay. I mean I have no problems. With my\neducation background and with everything else, I guess the biggest asset I had 1s my dedication.\nI never been a good speller. I mean I\u2019m not stupid, you know. Don\u2019t think I am stupid. I\u2019m not.\nYou know, I might not have book learning to the max or get a certificate. But I made up for that\nby reading a lot and getting my education in the school of hard knocks, is what taught me. They\n37\nknew wherever the job needed to get done, as long as... turn me loose, tell me what you want\ndone, give me the resources to do it with and I will get it done. That was me. [Laughing. |",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you a question which I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to answer, but PII ask it\nanyway and see what you think. You went through, I mean by the time you were a young child\nyou had been through more atrocities than most people have even imagined and a terrible,\nterrible war and you went on to fight in two more wars and you didn\u2019t have to do that. What do\nyou think it was that...?",
        "A: Drove me?",
        "Q: Yeah. Because I think so many people would have said, okay, I\u2019ve done...",
        "A: Done my part?",
        "Q: ...\u2019ve had my share in the wars of the world.",
        "A: I really couldn\u2019t tell you. Something inner, something inside of me drove me and what it was I\nreally couldn\u2019t put it into words. If I would say any particular thing... I mean, you got to take\neach one on its own merit. You can\u2019t just lump them all together. The war in Israel was a\nquestion of survival for the country. Because they closed the Suez Canal down. The lifeline for\nIsrael, because the oil must come in. At the time there was no pipeline from the Red Sea, so all\nthe oil was coming through the Suez Canal and it was delivered to Haifa to the refineries there,\nokay? So I didn\u2019t make the decision to go to war. I was just a guy who was in the Reserves. I\nwas already out of the Service in Israel. And we had a password and when you heard your\npassword, you packed your bags and you reported to your unit. You had a specific location\nwhere you met. It was a civilian mobilization of the Army and you went and did what you were\nsupposed to have done. I guess duty, if anything that drove me I guess was duty, responsibility,\nduty to what I believe was right. If there was anything to define. Now as far as \u2018Nam, again, I\ndidn\u2019t... 1t was the United States Government decision to have, to go to the aid of the South\nVietnamese. It wasn\u2019t mine. I just, again it was duty. I was in the Service, I was a career\nsoldier. Why would you be a career soldier? What, you\u2019re going to run when the fighting starts?\nThat\u2019s what you train for all the time. To when the nation calls you, then you be there to do\nyour... you know, and do your duty. And I hope anyway, that I was instrumental in saving some\nguy\u2019s life, because with my experience, you know, I helped guide a lot of other guys to maybe, if\nI wasn\u2019t there maybe somebody who had less experience would have got him killed. I\u2019m not\nsaying that would have been the case, but basically the professional guys in the Service, the non-\ncommissioned officers, who had experience from the Korean War and then served in \u2018Nam,\nthey\u2019re basically who trained the new guys, you know, and got them understand what a war is all\nabout. How to survive. If anything I guess, duty is the main, main theme here, I think, from\nwhat you\u2019re asking. Why I joined the Service, why I volunteered and stayed in the Service,\nthat\u2019s a different story. That had a lot to do with economy and all this stuff. Plus I had an\nopportunity to use my talent, my God-given talents that I had in the best way and advance my\nown career was in the military instead of the civilian life. But as far as when the war started, I\nthink the main thing was duty. I mean duty to do your job.\n38",
        "Q: Were you in a combat unit while you were in \u2018Nam? Or what were you?",
        "A: I was actually in the Signal outfit. The first time I was there I was in a place called Binh Dinh\nMountain, which was a seven thousand foot mountain. And it was about, I guess twenty miles\nfrom Dalat. There was no road in or out. All our supplies had to come by air. We got re-\nsupplied. And up there we had a relay, communication relay station to the North side, North\nVietnam and part of South Vietnam, the north part and the south part. Plus we had Air Force up\nthere, who were relaying instructions to the B-52 Bombers. So we\u2019re sitting on a seven thousand\nfoot mountain, and jungle all the way around us. Charlie was down there. We lived in bunkers.\nWe got attacked by mortars, you know, and that kind of that stuff. We didn\u2019t have no direct\nconfrontation. Then from there I moved to a place called Phu Ti Valley\u2019 which is not far from\nNha Trang and there we were with the Korean Tiger Division. That is an Infantry Division, who\nwere actually doing the combat. We were supporting them and going out to, when they went out\nfor a sweep and destroy mission, we went out to provide them communication. So, we got shot\nat, but we weren\u2019t involved in direct, you know, face-to-face, grunt job. The Koreans did that.\nSo, but I was running Highway One between Ban Me Thuot, and every morning before you even\ngot on there, you had to wait for them to clear all the mines out of there. So you never knew\nfrom one minute to the next when you\u2019re going to get ona mine. And then the Vietnamese had\nthis nice little trick, they would have this little hot pot, motorcycle-type tax1 cabs. And you\nwould come around with your truck and they would pull out in front of you to slow you down,\nlike ina curve. And you had to stop down to not run over them. And when you slowed down,\nthey would ambush you and start shooting you, at you from the side. So what you define\n\u201ccombat\u201d? In Vietnam there wasn\u2019t any really... no, I wasn\u2019t in the infantry unit. But in our\nbase camp, we got attacked. We killed nine guys there and the stetchel (ph)charged us. One of\nthem was our base barber that we killed. He was a Viet Cong. So you never knew who your, I\nmean who was your friend, who was your enemy. It was a weird kind of a war. There was no\nfront line, like in Korea or Second World War. You didn\u2019t know who was your friend or who\nwas your foe, besides your own buddies in your own unit. Because all Vietnamese could have\nbeen Viet Cong. We had to go to this and we had to lock down our gas caps on our trucks.\nWhat they would do if you didn\u2019t have the locks on them, they would take a hand grenade, put a\nrubber band around it, pull the pin, drop it inside your gas tank. Then the gas would eat away the\nrubber band, pop the thing and blow you to smithereens. So, you had to actually lock down with\na lock, you had to lock your caps so they couldn\u2019t stick nothing in there. Children were, they\nwould hawk on the side of the road. They would try to sell you coke. Well if you\u2019re stupid\nenough and you bought that coke, a lot of them had ground glass in it. If you drank that stuff it\ntore your guts up inside with shreds, slivers of glass. [Laughing.] So it was a different kind of\nwar. It wasn\u2019t the type of war where you could say who was a combat guy and who wasn\u2019t. But\nno, I wasn\u2019t... you know, I was on sweep and destroy missions with the Koreans. I took\nconvoys from the seven thousand-foot mountain down to the air field about twenty miles away to\npick up our rations and water, drinking water and all that stuff. We got ambushed periodically\non the road and all that. Well, you call that combat? I would call that combat, but I wasn\u2019t one\nof those guys that were crawling down those tunnels, tunnel rats or anything like that. I wasn\u2019t\nin the Infantry outfit fighting. I got a good friend who works with me as a volunteer, he was\nSpecial Forces. He was on long range patrol. They went out to search Charlie. Now I would\nsay he was in the trenches more than I was. I just reacted when Charlie attacked me. He went\n3 Also called Rok Valley.\n39\nout looking for him, that\u2019s different. But I did whatever was assigned me. I came to \u2018Nam. I\nwas supposed to go to a direct support unit. Not even get close to where the combat was. I was\nsupposed to work on repairing vehicles and stuff. I got to Cam Ranh Bay and they said, \u201cEh,\nyou are now, guess what. You are now a 6-3 Charlie. You are a motor sergeant. You are going\nup in the Central Highlands.\u201d Instead of staying right there in Nha Trang. Believe me, two years\nin \u2018Nam and I never seen Saigon. I don\u2019t know what Saigon looks like. I never been there. All\nmy time was up in the Central Highlands. I took two R&R tours, one I went to Australia and one\nI went to Hong Kong. Get away from it to relax.",
        "Q: What was your rank when you retired from the Army?",
        "A: I was E-8, Master Sergeant. I graduated from Sergeant Major Academy. I was going to make E-\n9, but I got sick and I got medically retired before I actually got promoted. But I actually retired\nas an E-8, graduated from Sergeant Major Academy. See it, my certificate. I mean the plaque?\nConclusion of Interview\n40\n"

My grandparents lived there in the village and a couple of her, my uncles, a couple of her\nbrothers lived there. And in the region around there we had a whole lot of, she had about eleven\nbrothers and sisters and they were all basically somewhere in the region. So, a big family there.\nMy father\u2019s parents, they lived, in his family they were in a different village, near the Tisza\nRiver, in a place called Butszentmihal', but we were born in Almozd.",

I assume that she was working from the, from our house, so I assume\nthat the people would bring, you know, stuff for her to, either to measure them or making dresses\nand stuff. In those days there wasn\u2019t too many ready-made off-the-shelf dresses. Most of it you\nhad to make.

In other words, he went on, on the Sabbath he went to the\nTemple and on holidays he went to the Temple. But he didn\u2019t, you know, during the week, every\nday prayer and all that stuff like my grandparents, he didn\u2019t.

We moved\nfrom there to Debrecen, which is about the third largest city in Hungary. That was the center for\nthe Protestant section of Hungary, because basically Hungary is a Catholic country. Only the\nnorthern part of Hungary was basically Protestant, and their center was in Debrecen and that\u2019s\nwhere we lived.",

I guess it was just better for the family, you\nknow, more centrally located. I would assume that because the village where we were born,\ndidn\u2019t even have a train come through there. You had to go with a horse and buggy from that\ntown to the train station, which was, you know, about ten klicks (ph), which was about five miles\naway. So there was absolutely nothing there. It was strictly agriculture, you know, and so my\ngrandparents had some land there and all that. But I would assume that\u2019s the main reason. He\nstill traveled down to all the villages and bought the skins and all that stuff, but basically his\nwarehouse and all that was in the city, and, you know, where they process the stuff. That\u2019s as far\nas I can remember.",
        "A: Ah, I don\u2019t know what the problem... I only went to one grade, okay, before the war started.\nAnd so it was, I would assume it was considered a public school, but it was a Jewish, ran by the\nJewish community. And basically all the children in the school were Jewish kids. But whether it\nwas, you know, sanctioned, whether the Hungarian educational system was part of it or not, I...\nbut it wasn\u2019t religious. It was secular and did basically, read, write, arithmetic, you know,\ngeography, all that other stuff you learn in a normal school. That\u2019s what we learned, but it was\nbasically, all Jewish children went there.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know, I could not tell you, from the time that I remember we were already in Debrecen. I\nwas about five or something like that. We were already living in Debrecen, so I could not tell\nyou when we actually moved there. I just know that I was born in \u201835 and I know we were in\nAlmozd then, that\u2019s where I was born. So, somewhere between \u201835 and, you know...\n4",
        "A: \u201844. Oh no, long before then. I was five, so that would be \u201840, 1940, so somewhere between \u201835\nand \u201840 is when the family moved from Almozd to Debrecen.",
        "A: Hungarian.",
        "A: My grandparents spoke and I guess my father knew Yiddish, but we, you know the children,\nwith my mother and father we only spoke Hungarian. And when we went to the Temple, we\nprayed in Hebrew. Because it was basically memorized rote, you know. I went to school,\nseparate religious school to learn to read in Hebrew from the Bible. But at home we only spoke\nHungarian, no other language.",
        "A: He was a neighbor. We used to play soccer together and all that kind of stuff.",
        "A: Oh yes, it started, it started in actually about \u201843. What they called, the Hungarian Nazis, which\nwere called the Nilosh, which is the Arrow, Arrow...",
        "A: ... something like that. Nilosh is basically somebody who shoots arrows. And you started\nwearing then already yellow stars and all that. At the time you just had to wear, you didn\u2019t have\nto, 1t wasn\u2019t until the Germans came in that they moved us into ghettos. But by then you already\nhad to sew on the yellow stars and all that stuff. And the Christian friends all of a sudden\ndisappeared [laughing]. They didn\u2019t know you anymore. Even if they wanted to probably their\nparents told them, you know, \u201cStay away from them, don\u2019t play with them,\u201d and such and such.\nSo, yeah. It started actually in \u00b043, but it really didn\u2019t get serious until \u201844, then when the\nGermans... and that I remember vividly, because it was Passover. We went down to my\nmother\u2019s parents. We were going to spend Passover with them. And so we all traveled down\nthere. I remember it was Passover night or the night thereafter, I\u2019m not sure which, but the\npoliceman from the village came in from Almozd. He came in and said that all Jews must go\nback to where they lived. \u201cSo, your daughter,\u201d he told my grandfather, \u201cyour daughter and her\nchildren must return immediately to Debrecen.\u201d And so in the middle of the night we had to get\na buggy and horses and go back to the train station and catch a train back to Debrecen. From\nthere they told us that we have to move into the ghetto. And so they set aside a square, I don\u2019t\nknow, about two or three square blocks, which they put wooden gates up on each end of the\n5\nstreet, blocked it off. And then windows that were looking outside from the ghetto, they bricked\nthem in, so basically you had an enclosed area of so many houses. A couple of streets, basically\nis what it amounted to. And they herded everybody in there.",
        "A: Well basically they told us you have so much time to, you know, to gather whatever you could\ncarry, belongings, whatever you could carry and, you know, and move in there. So, we moved\nin. And they allocated, you know, for each family a room or whatever. I don\u2019t remember now.\nSpace. And stayed there and from there they took the men to work. I don\u2019t know whatever kind\nof work they were doing. And they would come and take them off in the morning with shovels\nand stuff and then come back at night. My dad wasn\u2019t there, because he was already taken to\nlabor camp where, they called it... for the Army, basically they were in the service, but they\nwere labor battalions for the Hungarian Army which was already fighting the Russians. And I\nguess they were digging trenches for them and that kind of stuff. So he was already taken. Back\nin \u201843 he was already gone. He wasn\u2019t at home. So, he wasn\u2019t there when we were moved into\nthe ghetto, just my mother and us four children.",
        "A: He was there. Yeah. He was already fourteen or fifteen at the time. He was apprentice in a\nshop, they were making bristles. All kind of... have to think about how to say it... brooms and\nfor...",
        "A: Brushes, yeah, that\u2019s it. All kinds of brushes they were making in that place. He worked there\nas an apprentice. And my mother kept on sewing. That\u2019s basically what we were supported on.",
        "A: During the time that... no, I went to the first grade, but after when we moved into the ghetto,\nnobody, I mean there was no work in the ghetto. Basically the Jewish Community was divvying\nup food, whatever... I really don\u2019t know where the food was coming from. How the allocation\nwent and all that kind of stuff. But we had food to eat, I mean, during that time anyway, we\ndidn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember being hungry or anything like that. So I guess there was sufficient\namount of food available, you know, when in the ghetto.",
        "A: No. [Laughing.] I guess just normal food, you know, what my mother always would fix. I\nknow used to give me, come in from playing, because you\u2019re, I\u2019m what? I was seven and a half\nyears old, eight years old? I\u2019m paying not much attention to that. She used to give me a piece of\nbread with butter on it, sprinkled with a little sugar. That was my snack. [Laughing.] Tasted\ngood to me. So as far as I know, normal food that she would normally prepare, you know, that\u2019s\nwhat we had. I don\u2019t remember... now thinking back at it, I really don\u2019t remember what we ate.\nWhat kind of food. But we weren\u2019t there that long, because once they got everybody together,\n6\nthey started cleaning out that place. Load people up and they went to Auschwitz. The only\nreason I\u2019m sitting here talking to you right now is because the fact that my father was American.\nHe was born in New York City and he never accepted citizenship, Hungarian citizenship. So\nconsequently we were protected by the Swiss Embassy. So they put us in a separate house from\nthe rest of the ghetto. There were some other families there, who were foreign nationals or\nconsidered foreign nationals. And they were protected by the Hungarian police and not by the\nGermans. And so once the whole ghetto got emptied, because we didn\u2019t know where they were\ntaking them. We were taken on train, we were taken to Budapest. And they put us there in a,\nwhat they called a protective house. Basically it was a prison, but, and part of the wing there,\nthey even had American flyers there. They were shot down. Because we seen them exercise.\nWe had no direct contact with them. But they were shot down, you know, they were bombing\nBudapest and the planes were shot down and they got captured. That\u2019s where they kept them,\ntoo. So, that\u2019s were they kept us till December 1944.",
        "A: No, no. I wasn\u2019t afraid at all. No, no. I remember they were bombing, because the house that\nwe were in was close to the central train station. And they got bombed a lot. And so we always\nhad to go down to the shelter. I don\u2019t remember being afraid, to be perfectly honest with you.\nSounds crazy, but if I was, I do not remember it as such, as being afraid. I guess at that age, you\nreally... do not comprehend, you know, what was going on. Was no reason, really, in my mind\nthere was no reason to be afraid. But no, I do not remember being afraid. Now, my sister might\nhave been, I don\u2019t know. But I personally do not remember being afraid.",
        "A: I think so. We always did everything together, together we used to go, Sundays we used to have\nmatinee, back in Debrecen, we used to have matinee operettas, you know. And we used to love\noperettas. I was just a tiny little thing. But we used to, always save our money and go, on\nSundays we used to go to the operetta, the matinee. [Laughing.] There was a place they called\nNagy Erd6 which 1s basically a little forest area and they had a big pond there and row boats.\nAnd I remember my brother taking me there, you know, for going on the pond with a row boat\nride. That kind of stuff I remember. We did things together, I mean we were close family. Even\ntoday, every year we try to see each other. Once a year we get together somewhere, if it\u2019s at all\npossible.",
        "A: In Israel, right. That\u2019s where they live. Matter of fact, I just came back. I visited my sister in\nIsrael. My sister from Sweden was sick, so she couldn\u2019t join us. But that\u2019s the first year that we\ndidn\u2019t, all three of us weren\u2019t together. So, next year we are going to Sweden, so whether she is\nsick or not, we\u2019ll be there. We\u2019ll visit her. Each year we try to get together.\n7",
        "A: No. He joined us back in Budapest. They brought him back from whatever work Battalion he\nwas in. I guess the Swiss Embassy intervened. Anyway they brought him back and he joined us\nat the protective house. That\u2019s where he rejoined us.",
        "A: Well basically there was a lot of families there. I remember one guy taught me how to play\nchess. [Laughing.|] They had French and Italian, all different nationalities, bunch of... well, no,\nwasn\u2019t Italian, because they were, anyway, whoever were at war with the Nazis, with Germany\nand their allies. There was a whole bunch of different nationalities, I know that. I think there\nwas some French, too, Jewish, Jews.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I think so. Well, I better not say yes because I really don\u2019t know. But I think that all of\nthem were Jews. And it was just normal, I mean they would... again I don\u2019t know where the\nfood was coming, whether the Hungarian government provided the food or the Swiss or Red\nCross, I\u2019m really not sure. I remember that one time the Red Cross came to inspect the house.\nAnd I was , because I guess we were considered prisoners. I remember one, and\nthey brought some packages and stuff. I really don\u2019t remember a whole lot, detail-wise. I know\nthere were a lot of little kids and we played. The quarters were very tight, we only had, I think,\nfor the whole family, that\u2019s four of us and my father and mother, I think we only had one big\nroom for all of us. So there was, space-wise there wasn\u2019t a whole lot. And we had a window\nthat opened up on the courtyard. But it was all in four with the one gate you could come in or\nout. It was like enclosed. The hallways, the Hungarian police sitting in each hallway, armed.",
        "A: Yes, the Hungarian police treated, you know, as far as I know they treated us decently. Okay?\nThe rough time was with the Nilosh (ph), with the Hungarian Nazis during the ghetto. And there\nthey hit you with the butt of the rifle, whatever, if they didn\u2019t like your looks or whatever turned\nthem on, you know. But at the Protective house, they did treat us decently. There was no rough\nstuff or that kind of stuff. They were pretty decent.",
        "A: Yeah a couple of times, but that was later on. That was around when I got to the concentration\ncamp. At the house itself there was... as far as I can, for me anyway, for my memories, I didn\u2019t\nsee any mean beat-ups or that kind of stuff. I did not see anyone when I was around. December\nof \u201844, I guess the Russian were getting too close, and then they just moved everybody out in the\nstreet. Said, \u201cEverybody out, pick up whatever you can carry.\u201d And this was in December, cold,\nsnow on the ground. And they lined us up in the street and my brother, when he heard that they\nstarted hollering \u201cEverybody out\u201d and all that, he ran down underneath to the basement and\nopened the door for the bomb shelter to the street and he got out there. I followed him. And he\ntold me to go back. I would have been with him, but he didn\u2019t go to the concentration camps.\n8\nHe took off. But he was already fifteen, obviously he couldn\u2019t worry about me. He told me to\ngo back to mom and dad, so I went back and he took off. So he managed to escape. So he did\nnot come with us.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n9\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: From what he told me later on, first of all he hid around there in Budapest till he managed to get\nout of Budapest. He went back to Almozd, to where he was born. He knew the people there,\nand they hid him till after the war. He worked for the farmers and all that. But they took care of\nhim, protected him and hid him. That\u2019s where he went back to.",
        "A: Well, that day is when all Hell broke loose. There was no trains from there, from Budapest, so\nthey marched us. We walked about four days, I guess, close to a couple hundred miles, I mean\nkilometers, which 1s about... a hundred kilometers is sixty miles, so probably about a hundred\nmiles, maybe a hundred and twenty miles we walked to a rail head. And we were cold, snow and\nyoung children. And they called it a death march, because whoever couldn\u2019t keep up they just\nshot him. Dropped him whenever he couldn\u2019t go no more and killed him. Either you went or\nyou died, as simple as that. So, they marched us in the snow and ice for about, I guess it was\nfour days by the time we got to the rail head.",
        "A: Well whatever, initially we had belongings with us, but as we walked we threw, basically got rid\nof most of the stuff we couldn\u2019t carry. Just the most important necessities 1s what you kept.\nEverything else got thrown to the side of the road. And, you know, just kept on trucking.",
        "A: Well each day, evening they usually had some big barns and stuff, I guess they took over from\nsome farms or whatever, they herded us in there because it wasn\u2019t that many people to begin\nwith. I don\u2019t know how many, but I wouldn\u2019t think it was more than a few hundreds, maybe four\nor five hundred people the whole, the whole thing. So, they herded us in there. And usually they\nfed us some kind of a hot soup and some black bread, you know, rye. And that was basically all\nthe food we got.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s all from that protective house. They were considered foreign nationals, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes, in that whole complex. It was four or five stories high, I mean the building. But\nanyway, yeah, whatever was in, they emptied out, the house, the prison, whatever you want to\ncall it. They took everybody from there.\n10",
        "A: Yes, there was Germans and some Hungarian Nazis were working with them, but basically the\nGermans SS was in charge. They\u2019re the ones who controlled the whole thing, the movement and\nall that. So once we got to the rail head, there they separated the women and the children and the\nmen and they loaded us on separate cattle cars. And they packed us full in these cars. We barely\ncould breathe, and one little bucket in a corner for everybody to use as a toilet. And closed the\ndoors and off we went. We went... and my father was taken separately to, well all the men were\ntaken to different camps. And so they took us to Ravensbrick, that\u2019s where our first\nconcentration camp was.",
        "A: I never, ever can remember that I was afraid. I\u2019m not saying I wasn\u2019t, but in my mind I do not\nremember being afraid. I was more... I don\u2019t even know what I was feeling. I really didn\u2019t\nknow what was going... I guess I was just trying to survive. My main motive was, in the cattle\ncar if you don\u2019t watch it you will be trampled to death there. There were people who died in the\ncamp, I mean in the car going there. And I don\u2019t know how long we traveled in the car. But\nhonestly, I really can\u2019t tell you that I actually felt scared, no afraid. Now, I\u2019m not saying that I\nwasn\u2019t, but I do not remember that kind of feeling. Because maybe that was because of my age,\nyou know, and all that. It just didn\u2019t dawn on me that I\u2019m supposed to be afraid. I don\u2019t know.\nMatter of fact, my sister tells me and I could not verify it for you, because I don\u2019t know.\nBecause I\u2019m not remembering. But once we were in Ravensbriick, it was like they had appell,\nbasically like reveille in the morning in the Army. Everybody had to fall out of the barracks and\nline up and had roll call, you know, account for everybody. And whoever was sick had to go,\nthat whole camp was nothing but women and children. Basically women, there were a few\nchildren, but not too many. My mother had a real terrible headache and she asked for some\nmedication or something and the German whipped her with... he had one of those riding, you\nknow?",
        "A: Yeah, he slapped her across and I went and kicked him in the shin. [Laughing.] And my sister\nsaid everybody, they got deathly still. They were afraid that he was going to kill me or\nsomething. But he just turned around and he slapped me and I went flying, but that\u2019s about, he\ndidn\u2019t do nothing else to me, but, you know. That tells you I wasn\u2019t afraid for my own personal.\nI don\u2019t remember doing it, to be honest with you. But that\u2019s what my sister told me that I did. I\npersonally cannot remember that I personally was afraid. From when we arrived at the camp\neverybody got taking all the clothes and everything away from them. And my mother had sewed\ngold coins and stuff into each one of our, because we didn\u2019t know, you know, so she divvied up\nwhat we had and sewed into our overcoats just 1n case, you know, we could use it. Maybe the\nwhole family could have been saved. My dad got hold of the farmer one of the nights when we\nstopped overnight and talked to the farmer. And he had sewed in his overcoat, a big diamond\nring and he told the farmer he was going to give him the diamond ring if he hides us, the four of\nus, the four kids and him and my mom. And he agreed, so it must have been a pretty good\n11\ndiamond ring, you know pretty big diamond. But my mom wouldn\u2019t go. She said that he might\nkill us himself for the rest of the stuff. She didn\u2019t want to go.",
        "A: It was on the way to the rail head from Budapest. Anyway, they took all the clothes away and\nthey gave us those striped, pajama type stuff. And they cut everybody\u2019s hair, women, children,\neverything. And they gave us a shower, but it was water. It wasn\u2019t gas. And they assigned us to\nbarracks. When we went out, after the reveille in the morning, they took us out to the field to\npick beets, cattle beets. And we ate cattle beets to keep us from starving.",
        "A: Basically once a day they gave you a slice of black bread and soup made from cattle beets. Hot\nliquid, but it was wintertime, was cold. That\u2019s basically what you got and while you worked out\nthere if you could sneak away some beets, then you chewed on that while you worked. And that\nwas it.",
        "A: Well, they marched us from the camp out to the field. I don\u2019t know how long it took to get us\nout there. It wasn\u2019t too far from the fields. I don\u2019t remember how far. Mainly I think the\ndifficulty was walking in the snow and ice and all that kind of stuff. But we went out to the\nfields and you pulled them beets, you know? They had a cart that you threw it on. Afternoon\nthey walk you back to the camp. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s all. There might have been other stuff,\nother people picked, maybe because the younger one, the weak and all, the weaker people they\ntook to the easier, where the beets weren\u2019t that heavy. They weren\u2019t that big. Just depends,\nprobably had other kind of work details, too.",
        "A: Yeah. I didn\u2019t every day go out with them. But most of the time they just took everybody out.\nJust brought them down and took them out. So I don\u2019t know, we stayed there for a couple of\nmonths and then one day they hollered everybody out from the barracks and they lined us up\nagain. And at the time my sister, Miriam, she was very sick and they had her in the dispensary\nover there. So started marching us toward the rail head and I remember Mama hollering,\n\u201cMiriam, Miriam!\u201d She didn\u2019t want to leave her. [Weeping.] Anyway, they loaded us back up\nagain and my sister stayed behind. From there they took us to Bergen-Belsen. We arrived at\nBergen-Belsen and they took us in where the crematorium was and maybe because I was just a\nlittle child, but there was a mountain, nothing but dead corpses piled on top of each other. And\nthe smell and everything else, and stayed over there overnight. The next day they took us and\nput us in the barracks. There was no beds or anything. They had some straw. And give you a\nsack to fill up with straw. That was your bed. So, basically you laid on concrete in the winter.\nNo food. My mother died there. Then in May, \u201945, we got liberated. The British and Canadian\ntroops actually liberated Bergen-Belsen. And then the Red Cross took us from where they found\nus, took us to hospital. We stayed there and the Swedish Red Cross took us from there to\n12\nSweden. I stayed about a year in hospital. They nursed me back to health. Then once I got out\nof the hospital, I joined my sister in the orphanage.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what she died from. I have no idea. But a lot of people during that period of time\ndied from typhus. They... I think she probably more died from starvation than anything else,\nbecause what little food we could get hold, she would feed the kids, me and my sister. I don\u2019t\nknow if she ate any or what, and so her condition... and we were susceptible to any disease that\nwas rampaging around in the place there. There was no cleaning, you didn\u2019t wash you. Any\nkind of hygiene, so who knows what would have caused it.",
        "A: Ilona...",
        "A: ...and my mother went to Bergen-Belsen, yeah. Me and Ilona was liberated from Bergen-\nBelsen.",
        "A: The only thing I remember, somebody said that they were hanging, they\u2019d seen some white flags\non the guard towers. What is the white flags? Germans put white flags on the towers. Didn\u2019t\nmean nothing to me. I don\u2019t know what the symbol, surrender, but how was... and then\nsomebody I heard said, holler something about, \u201cthe Germans are leaving.\u201d I guess they try to\nhide. You know? The camp guards all were booking. [Laughing.] So, anyway. And then the\nnext thing you know the troops, the military was coming through the camps and all that. I guess\npicking up whoever was still living. Matter of fact they took us to the German hospital. I guess\nthey cleaned it out whoever was in there. Anyway they took it over and that\u2019s where they were\ntaking us. Then they put up big, old hospital tents. That\u2019s where the children, they brought the\nchildren to, we were in a hospital, a big hospital tent. I remember that. And I guess they started\nfeeding us slowly, slowly because we had hardly any stomach left. That\u2019s what killed a lot of\npeople, I understand, is they gave them too much food too soon. Got diarrhea and all that, they\ncouldn\u2019t handle it on their bodies. So anyway, wasn\u2019t much left of me by that time. But anyway\nfrom there the Swedish Red Cross came and picked up all the children without any family and\neverything and took us to Sweden. They put us on one of those Red Cross trains and we arrived\nin Malmo. Had those white buses with red crosses on them. From there they took us to the\nhospital, Swedish hospital in Stockholm, I mean Malmo.",
        "A: Nine and a half. I would be ten in November.\n13",
        "A: My sister, she was three years older, at least three, three, three and a half years older than I was.\nSo, she was about twelve and a half, between twelve and thirteen. But she was born in\nDecember, so she wasn\u2019t quite thirteen, past twelve, but not thirteen.",
        "A: Oh, they treated us very well. I mean, they were wonderful people. They cared for us. As far as\nI can remember, in the hospital anyway, they were very kind and all that. When we went to the\norphanage, I think it wasn\u2019t Swedish. I think it was run by a Jewish agency. I think it wasn\u2019t a\nSwedish government function. It was kind of tough. Started putting us back to school. But, had\none teacher who was teaching me in German. One teacher was teaching me in Polish.\n[Laughing. ]",
        "A: I picked some up there. There were a lot of children who were Polish. So, it was pretty hard to\nlearn anything, because of all the language. Nobody was teaching me anything in Hungarian,\nwhich was the only language I really knew. But I learned there. I was able to speak pretty good\nPolish by the time I was done there, and German, too. And anyway, that was the education that\nwe got.",
        "A: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, they had some teachers, I guess, who were, before the war who were\nteachers. But one was a German, the other one was a Polish, that taught the subject, but in their\nlanguage, because that\u2019s the only one that they knew how to use, so. But if you weren\u2019t a Polish\nchild, it didn\u2019t mean nothing to you. What do I need to learn Polish? How to spell or whatever\nPolish. The German guy, he, I think he taught math, so that was okay, one and one 1s two, you\nknow, doesn\u2019t make no difference. As long as you understood what he was trying to say on the\nblackboard, so you could follow him fairly reasonable. Anyway they disbanded the orphanage.\nAnd by that time my sister was fifteen and she had to go out and work. They told her she has to\nfind a job and go to work. And they took me to a DP camp. I mean it wasn\u2019t a camp, it was a\nhouse in a place called Tabo (ph), in Sweden. And basically I was on my own. There was a\nwoman who was a cook there, who was basically supposed to look after me. Look over me.\nAnd they enrolled me in a Swedish school, so now I had to learn Swedish. [Laughing.] You\nknow. And went to school in Sweden. Now I went to one grade in Hungary and what little\nschooling I got there at the orphanage. And from there they started me off... I think in sixth,\naccording to my age, which was sixth grade or something like that. Sixth, seventh grade. And\nobviously it wasn\u2019t easy. But the children there was nice. They were fairly friendly for a\nstranger, you know, and all that. A couple of friends I had there. One was a little, wanted to be a\njockey. There was a horse farm not far from there. He and me used to go to the horse farm and\ntry to get, let him ride the horses and stuff. So, anyway I was there for a while. And a Jewish\nfamily came and they introduced me to them, and blah, blah, blah. They basically took me home\nwith them, in other words, they were going to be my guardians. They lived in Stockholm, so we\nmoved to Stockholm. And they enrolled me in school over there. They treated me nice, as a\n14\nmatter of fact they wanted to adopt me, but by that time I found my brother and my other sister,\nMiriam, in Israel. So I said, \u201cNo I don\u2019t want to be adopted. I\u2019m going to Israel.\u201d So, that\u2019s\nwhat I did.",
        "A: Through the Red Cross and through the Jewish Agency. We looked for Father, too. And I found\nmy father also. He went back to Hungary looking for us. He wrote and said, \u201cDo not come back\nto Hungary.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to the United States. When I get there I want you to join\nme there. In the meantime stay where you are.\u201d But I didn\u2019t want to stay there, so I signed up to\ngo to Israel. And my sister, I guess by that time she had a boyfriend, whatever, anyway she\ndecided she wanted to stay in Sweden. She stayed there, and I went to Israel.",
        "A: Well, because I... I been always close to my older brother, and my older brother and sister was\nin Israel, so I said, \u201cWell I'll just go there and wait for them until Father gets to the United\nStates, instead of here.\u201d So anyway, that\u2019s what I did. That was in \u201849, in May \u201849, I went to\nIsrael. The Swedish family, they wanted me to stay and they were going to adopt me and\neverything. I didn\u2019t want to. And later on, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t, because that guy, my sister told me\nthat the guy and his wife got divorced. [Laughing.] So, you know, anyway, that\u2019s neither here\nnor there. They were nice people, they treated me fine. As a matter of fact, my thirteen birthday,\nmy Bar Mitzvah, they did that at the big Temple in Stockholm.",
        "A: Yeah they are the ones who...",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But religion is not my thing. After what I\u2019ve seen, nobody can convince me\nthat faith is worth anything.",
        "A: No, no, no. I willingly did that. I\u2019m just saying I have no religious... I\u2019m not religious of any\nkind. I don\u2019t believe in all that stuff. That\u2019s what the war did to me. What I\u2019ve seen and\neverything. I said, there\u2019s nobody up there watching anything if this can happen here. That\u2019s\nme, anyway.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n15\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: ... to Israel.",
        "A: That was in \u201849, May of 1949.\nD: Who paid for your travel?",
        "A: I think the... as far as I know it was the Jewish Agency or whatever. You know, Aliyah Tano\u2019ar\n(ph)which 1s basically the Jewish Agency gathering up the children, the No\u2019ar (ph), which means\nthe young. I guess they\u2019re the ones who paid for it. As far as I know. I didn\u2019t have the money\nto pay for it, so they gave me the ticket and I went. I think, basically what they did, I flew from\nSweden to France, and in France the Agency picked me up and took me to a DP camp, I guess.\nAnd from there they loaded us up on a boat. By that time it wasn\u2019t illegal anymore. The British\nwere gone. And they took us with a boat to Haifa. And we arrived and my brother was waiting\non me. We arrived like today and that evening he was already there, my older brother.",
        "A: Yeah I remember it. We were glad to see each other and hugged and all that good stuff. I want\nto know how the trip was and how he was, how I was, how Illy was and all that. He said that\nhe\u2019s going to take me to the village where he lives. The name of it was Kfar Warburg, it was a\nmoshav. Moshav means that everybody got, owns his own land, got his own farm. And they\njust have joint, the milk processing and the equipment, the major equipment and stuff 1s jointly\nowned, but each one got his own land and his own farm that he works, that\u2019s a Moshav. So\nanyway, that\u2019s where he took me. The family\u2019s name was Lillieh (ph), they were German Jews,\nwho escaped before, during the Kristallnacht back in \u201839. They got out of Germany and came to\nIsrael. So, they are the ones who, he was with them before, when he first came to Israel. And so\nanyway that\u2019s the family, and I worked half a day and went to school half a day. So again I had\nto learn a new language to go to school. And basically we went to school in the morning and\nworked in the afternoon.",
        "A: On the farm, on his farm, yeah.",
        "A: Well, he had milk cows. He had about fourteen milking cows, so you had to grow feed for them.\nAnd you had, he grew vegetables, tomatoes and cucumbers and that kind of stuff. Eggplants.\nCauliflowers, corn, you know, just basically, it wasn\u2019t, the land over there, you don\u2019t have no\n16\nhuge acreage anyway. You\u2019re talking about... dunam (ph), I guess, I don\u2019t know how to\ncompare it with acres. But I would say he had no more than maybe fifteen acres of land. And so\nhe had to raise alfalfa to feed the cows. One thing he didn\u2019t have to worry about, 1s that like here\nyou have to cut hay and put it away and all that, so that you would have food for the winter.\nOver there it grows year-round, semi-tropic, so you don\u2019t have to worry about not having feed\nfor them. You just have to make sure that... but we grew hay, you know, alfalfa for... and cut\nhay to feed the cows, and all that. Basically I worked out on the farm, plowed, picked tomatoes,\npicked this and picked that and weeded. All the things you do ona farm. Milked cows and all\nthat stuff.",
        "A: In Stockholm you mean?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no. They never did. And I never talked about it. As a matter of fact, you\u2019re probably only\nabout the second or third person I ever talked about, talked about it at all. First time I ever, well\nbeside Yad Vashem, you know, when we got interviewed, but that was with both my sisters there\nand they did most of the talking. And last year, the Jewish Community Center here in Louisville\nasked me to join them on Yom Ha... Remembrance, Day of Remembrance and all that, to tell\nmy story. So I reluctantly agreed that I would tell them whatever I remember. And so I did. I\nwent up there and said my piece. And that was, beside this here, that\u2019s about the only time. I\ndon\u2019t talk about it. And matter of fact, Professor Dickstein wanted me to go to one of the high\nschools and speak to the children about my experience and I declined. I said I just can\u2019t handle\nit. I\u2019m not going to constantly dig it out, dig it up. I just can\u2019t live like that. I\u2019m just not willing\nto constantly put myself through that. So, I don\u2019t, normally don\u2019t talk about it. I want to put it\nbehind me, not in front of me.",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t know. I just, I think probably the main thing that motivated me on that is I\nread in places where, especially where they had the trial in Britain about people saying it never\nhappened and all that stuff, 1t\u2019s somebody\u2019s fantasies. And I\u2019m here to tell you that it did\nhappen. And I guess that\u2019s probably the main reason that I agreed to talk about it, is that, you\nknow, people are trying to change history. And if you don\u2019t learn nothing, you don\u2019t learn no\nlesson from what happened, it can happen again. That was my biggest motivation of joining the\nUS Army, is I felt that the Russians weren\u2019t that much better than the Nazis were. They had the\ngulags, they had the camps. May not have been prosecuting Jews per se, but they were\nprosecuting human beings. That\u2019s basically what decided, probably the only force in the world\n17\nduring this period of time that could prevent something like that happening is the U.S. Armed\nForces. And so that was my main reasoning for joining the Service. I served in the Israeli Army.\nI fought in the Sinai Desert in \u201856. And so I\u2019ve been through the wringer. But that wouldn\u2019t\naffect Israel, doesn\u2019t affect the world. And probably the only force in the world at this time of\nhuman history who can make a difference is the United States and the U.S. Armed Forces. So,\nthat was my main motivation of joining the Service.",
        "A: Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that\u2019s the only thing\nthat... you know. And then as I got older and I read. I\u2019m not educated very well. I finished\nhigh school GED and I got some college behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours. But basically\nI read a lot, and my understanding that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long\ntime and is basically... I don\u2019t blame any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in\nchurches and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus and this and that and always had limitation on what\nJews can do. They always kept them outside of the mainstream society. And they were\nprohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things. So\nthey were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to\ncall them. And then the church teaching basically demonized them. So, I don\u2019t think it was too\nhard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people\ndidn\u2019t, didn\u2019t care. Because it\u2019s supposed to be that most of them were Christians, supposedly\nsupposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they\u2019re teaching. But I\nguess that wasn\u2019t what, what actually happened. I\u2019ve seen them take a little baby and smash him\nagainst, his head against the wall. Kill him. And what human being would do something like\nthat? And then they go to church to pray? I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this\nworld today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion. Take a look right now. Sudan, got\na Muslim against the Christians. Northern Ireland, Catholics against the Protestants. You go to\nIndia, you got the... Sri Lanka, you got one sect fighting another and again it\u2019s religion. Iraq,\nSunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims. So every place you look at, to me anyway, from what I read\nand seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion. That\u2019s my view.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s something different, because if there was an Israel before the Second World War,\nbefore... this probably, I mean the Holocaust probably never would have happened. Because\nI\u2019m not looking at it as religion, okay? I look at it as a homeland for a people. Because you can\ntake the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people. And \u2019'm\nJewish and the Bible, the Old Testament to me is the history of my people, and as such every\npeople need a homeland. And that\u2019s what motivated me. But I always consider myself\nAmerican, which is really funny, that even before the war, my dad always told me that he was\nAmerican, so I considered myself American. And he was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1906.\n18\nAnd he always told me that he is American and one of these days we\u2019re going to go back to the\nUnited States. So, it was very natural for me, once I found him and once he got to the United\nStates himself and everything, that in \u201859 I came and joined him in the United States.",
        "A: From what I understand and I\u2019m really not positive, but it seems to me, what happened was that\nhis parents or his grandfather, 1t was him and his father, immigrated to the United States back in\nthe 1800s or somewhere, you know, late 1800s. And they lived here, matter of fact, I got an\naunt, who was born here and never left here. She\u2019s passed away now in Houston. But her whole\nlife, she was born in the United States, lived in the United States and passed away in the United\nStates. So, they lived here, I guess in New York and either during the Depression, or early, they\ndecided that they would be better off and went back. That\u2019s my understanding as to what\nhappened. And then my father was still, wasn\u2019t... his sister was old enough that she said no,\nshe\u2019s not going back with them, she\u2019s staying. My father probably wasn\u2019t old enough, you\nknow, to be on his own, so his father took him back with him to Hungary. That\u2019s my\nunderstanding, you know, is what happened. But I\u2019m not exactly sure as to what year, you\nknow, they came and what year they went back and all that. But that basically what happened.\nLike I say, probably if not for that, that he was born here, I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting here\ntalking to you, because I would have wound up in Auschwitz in the gas chamber.",
        "A: Ask away.",
        "A: No, I personally didn\u2019t. Of course, I was basically with the youth, the youth movement. It might\nhave happened in some places. I\u2019m not saying it didn\u2019t. It might have. But in my personal\nexperience, like in the village where I was at, there was no, you know, down look. You pulled\nyour share. I\u2019ve never been a whiner anyway. You know, I always pull my share, whatever\nneeds to be done, Ill go take care of it. I worked and I went to school. Pulled guard duty at\nnight with everybody else. Went with the youth and learned how to use a weapon and at night\nwhen the Arabs came and stole cows and stuff, we chased after them. [Laughing.] And all that\nstuff. I was, I personally did not feel that I was in any way looked down at or discriminated. But\ncould have been better treatment? Sure, it could have been better treatment for everybody\ninvolved. But, you know, you\u2019re talking about a country just been formed, poor, wasn\u2019t a whole\nlot of anything there. And everybody did the best they could with what they had. Sure I would\nhave liked to have gone to school full time and learned something, had a degree in something, at\nleast had a trade of some kind. But I didn\u2019t expect that, it was just the way things worked out. I\ngot no complaints personally. If there\u2019s some people that say they were discriminated against,\nmight have been. I have not, my personal, maybe because my brother was already there, you\nknow. He served in the Palmach, which was their elite troops in those days in Israel. So, I was, I\n19\nguess under his protective wings or whatever. But I personally did not feel any, and my sister\nwas in a kibbutz by then, Miriam. So, I did not feel that I was discriminated against.",
        "A: Kfar Warburg. That was the name of it. It was in southern Israel, south side of Tel Aviv, quite a\nway down there. The whole country in four hours you can traverse it one end to the other on a\ndecent road. [Laughing.] It wasn\u2019t that, you know, that big a country. But it was to the south of\nTel Aviv, not far from Ashgelon. So, anyway.",
        "A: I joined the Israeli Army in \u201950... I was seventeen, so let\u2019s see, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty-two,\nso \u201852 is when I, or the beginning of \u201853 1s when I... \u201852. Because my brother had to sign\nbecause I wasn\u2019t old enough and I volunteered, so he had to sign my paper so I could join the\nservice. So it was \u00b052, was when I... I know the Korean War was still going on when I joined.",
        "A: You mean the Service?",
        "A: I just wanted to serve. I don\u2019t know, wasn\u2019t nothing particular. I just wanted to do my couple of\nyears in, you know, the Service. Before that I already worked on tractors, worked down with the\nBedouins in the Negev. I plowed their fields for them. I was the only Jew. I was about fifteen\nyears old. Had a.45 on my hip, tractor and my two Bedouins who guarded me. And I was\nplowing Sheikh Suleiman, who was their Sheikh, the head of their tribe. I was plowing his fields\nfor him. I was the only Jew there. I wasn\u2019t afraid.",
        "A: Well, the individual I worked for, who owned the tractor, he was my boss basically. I worked\nfor him. I guess he got the contract with, he got hired by Sheikh Suleiman to plow his fields.\nSo, we took the tractor down there. He left me down there to do the work, so I did the work.\n[Laughing.| Stayed there for about ten days, I guess. One night they woke me up and said,\n\u201cShhh, there are fedayins (ph) in the area,\u201d which means there are Palestinian Arabs in the area.\nSo, they woke me up, and they said \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d But they protected me. I\nmean I got no complaints. I wasn\u2019t afraid. And sure enough, not long after my boss came with a\npick-up truck to pick me up and get me out of there. They had some problems, infiltrators. So,\nanyway. I had my adventures. I helped build the phosphate pools down in the Dead Sea. We\nbuilt big pools filled up with water and then the sun would evaporate the water and leave the salt.\nYou made a lot of different product out of that. The salt is, they got potassium and they got\niodine and they got all kind of stuff in it. They make all kinds of chemicals from that. So I\nhelped build the pools down there for that. I helped build the first highway to Elath. And also\n20\nhelped started bringing the oil pipelines back up from Elath, from the Red Sea up toward\nAshgelon. That was before I left for the United States.",
        "A: No, that was during the Service and after the Service. I was in the, in the Israeli Army I was in\nthe Engineers. And the Army engineers built the first road down to Elath, first main road, paved\nroad, regular road. So, I worked on that for the Army engineers, during . And the\npipeline was after I was already out of the Army and I worked for a company, a construction\ncompany, who were building the pipeline. So, I helped that and also the, I don\u2019t know exactly\nhow you call it, the ponds, basically. They fill it up with water and let it evaporate. Helped build\nthem for the company down there, also through the construction company. I done all kinds of\nstuff in my life, as far as work. I dug ditches. I built walls from Jerusalem stone. You know, I\nbeen supporting myself since I was fourteen years old. What needed to be done, I did.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Like I told you, my dad said to stay in Sweden and I hadn\u2019t seen him since the war\ntime. Well, I didn\u2019t want to wait in Sweden, so I went to Israel. And then during \u201856, during the\nSinai Campaign, the US Embassy came looking for me, they were going to evacuate me. But I\nwas already down in the Sinai, fighting, so, you know. And then they thought that I got killed,\nso they notified my father that I got killed. I come home and I check back with the Embassy to\nfind out what the status... because I was waiting for a visa. The reason it took me until \u201859 to get\nto the United States, was because there was no visas. You had to wait. Right now, all this illegal\naliens and all this stuff, and everybody says, \u201cWell, poor guys...\u201d Well, that\u2019s not so, because\nevery time you got illegal alien coming in here that means that somebody who is waiting legally,\nwants to come in, you know, he can\u2019t come in. He\u2019s waiting. So that ain\u2019t right. But anyway, I\nwas waiting for my legal visa to join my father. The only reason by \u201859 I finally got one is\nbecause in \u201856, the Hungarian Revolt \u2014 Remember that? Against the Russians, and a lot of\nHungarians got out of Hungary? So, they increased the number of visas and all that stuff for the\nHungarian refugees, and so that\u2019s the reason why about \u201859 I got, managed to get to the United\nStates. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to come earlier. It was a question that I couldn\u2019t legally come\nto the United States. So anyway, so...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n21\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: Later on I found out I didn\u2019t need all that stuff, that I have... I really didn\u2019t need a visa till if I\ncame back to the United States before I was twenty-four years old, I was automatically a U.S.\ncitizen, because I was considered an American due to my father\u2019s birth. So anyway, so \u201859 is\nwhen I got to the States.",
        "A: What do you mean what else happened?",
        "A: It\u2019s war. People get killed. You get shot at, and basically I was with the Combat Engineers\nthere. To breach the roads we had to blow up roadblocks and stuff in Rafah. I was up in the\nnorthern section: Rafah, El\u2019 Arish, Qantara, all the way out to the Suez Canal. And so anyway,\nso basically we breached the road and opened it for the armor to get through and we went\nthrough. And basically, the Egyptians didn\u2019t want to fight. We found tanks, they were still\noperational, the engine running, just left them. They just jumped out and ran out barefoot into\nthe desert. Just left their equipment there. So... they\u2019re poor , their officers\nwere partying somewhere and they left them there in the trenches. So anyway, the Egyptian\nArmy in those days anyway, weren\u2019t very strong. And anyway. We lost some people, sure we\ndid. Took a hundred hours for the whole, it took the whole Sinai Desert one hundred hours,\nthat\u2019s all, so. I did my job, whatever I was supposed to have done. I did mine and everybody\nelse. And to understand the Israeli Army you have to realize that they didn\u2019t even have\ntransportation. And guys who missed their units, they hitchhiked to get to their units, to join\nthem. You know, in those days anyway, I don\u2019t know about now, but in those days, people knew\ntheir duty and you didn\u2019t have to tell them. They knew what they had to do and it got done. So,\nit wasn\u2019t like an experience, sure it wasn\u2019t no pleasant experience. I came back, I had a beard\n[Laughing.]. And when everybody else came back, because Eisenhower forced, you know, the\nIsraelis to withdraw from the Sinai. And since I was in the Engineers, I stayed behind. And\nwhat we did, we plowed up all the roads coming back from Sinai, this a-way, and we plowed up\nall the roads, destroyed all the tracks, train tracks. We took the train tracks, blew them up and all\nthe bridges, anything to slow them down. To slow the Egyptian Army from coming back in.\nAnd so we were the last ones out of Sinai. I guess that\u2019s the reason maybe they thought that I\nwas dead, you know. [Laughing.] I didn\u2019t come home. Most everybody was coming home. I\nwas still down there. We were the last ones out. So anyway, that\u2019s the experience.",
        "A: Yeah, we were exchanging letters, yeah. And he worked in Newark. He worked in a store as a\nsalesman and he got remarried, so my stepmother, she worked in a bakery as a saleslady. She\nhad ason. She lost one son, too, in the war. She had one son, he was with them. And he went\nto school in New York. And that\u2019s basically it. I kept in touch. And then checked, I went to get\na visa and I was working with the U.S. Consulate in Tel Aviv and finally got the visa. And that\u2019s\nit. That was in \u201859.\n22",
        "A: I flew, one of the Super Constellation, four-engine prop jobs. Flew from Tel Aviv to France.\nAnd something happened to the plane, and we stayed overnight in France. But the French Air,\nthey paid for my hotel stay in Paris for the night and all that till the next day. Then we flew on to\nIdlewild, now it\u2019s Kennedy. In those days it was almost new. And my parents, my dad waited\nfor me there. And they took us, they lived in Newark in an apartment. So we got there, my aunt,\nthe one who never left the States, she lived in New York in those days. No, I\u2019m sorry. No, she\ndidn\u2019t. She already lived down in Miami. His son, her son, his name was Milton. He served in\nthe Second World War as a flight engineer on one of them Dakota airplanes. He flew mission\nover the hump in Burma. So, he was a Second World War veteran. He\u2019s passed away now.\nAnd my uncle, he served in the Second World War. My aunt\u2019s husband. He was with the CB\u2019s,\nconstruction battalion. I arrived in May of \u201859. My dad said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to move down to\nFlorida.\u201d He had a \u201856 Ford, and so we drove down to Florida. We towed a U-Haul thing\nbehind us. And went to work there in... well when I was up in New York I worked for, within a\nweek, I had job, I had work. Work no problem. I have never had problem finding work. I\nworked for a chemical company, Ephart Fiber and Rubber Company. We were making erasers\nin a factory. Worked for them and then father said we\u2019re going to move down to Florida. I said,\nokay. We moved down to Florida, that was toward the end of \u201859, the winter season. He worked\nas a waiter and I worked as a busboy in a hotel down on the beach. Name of the hotel was\nSterling Hotel.",
        "A: It was Miami Beach.",
        "A: Yeah, and I was down there. In 1960 I got a letter saying, \u201cGreetings from your neighbors, you\njust have been drafted.\u201d [Laughing.] So, I was just barely a year in the United States and I got\ndrafted in the U.S. Army.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know it. I came late. I waited for my visa. I thought I had to have visa and all that,\neverybody else said the same thing. I just found out, long time later that I could have just come\nas a visitor. As soon as I stepped my foot in the, if I was less than twenty-four years old when I\narrived, this way, too, I was less than twenty-four, but if I would have got to the United States\nbefore I was twenty-four, I was automatically considered just like a native-born American. I\ndidn\u2019t even need a visa. Nobody told me and I didn\u2019t know. The only reason I know now ts\nbecause the Justice Department represented me against the Germans in... what do you call it?\n23",
        "A: Damages, restitutions, yeah, under the Prince litigation. They would only represent people who\nwere, that were considered to be U.S. citizens during the war, okay, and on. And I was, by the\nJustice Department\u2019s own... so the Immigration Service don\u2019t know their own laws, basically.\nBut anyway I had to wait till \u201859 till I got visa to get to the United States.",
        "A: Well, I really didn\u2019t have no bad feeling about it. I felt that if 1 wanted to become a citizen of the\nUnited States it\u2019s my obligation to serve, you know, I felt, my country. I had no problems with\nthat. So the only problem I really had was, you know, to me, basic training and all that was no\nbig deal. I been through all that. [Laughing.] So, that was no big deal for me. But anyway,\nlanguage, I wasn\u2019t speaking that well English during those days yet. I had a good friend, went to\nbasic training together, his name was James B. Smith, J.B. He was from North Carolina. And he\nbasically took me under his wings and he was teaching me English. Anytime I was saying\nsomething that wasn\u2019t right, he would usually correct me and all that stuff. He was like, Mutt\nand Jeff? He was tall, skinny guy, you know, and I was short, stocky. And you didn\u2019t have to\nlook far, 1f you seen one of us there the other one wasn\u2019t too far away, was somewhere nearby.\nSo we became really close friends. I\u2019m a godfather to one of his daughters. Even today we still\nkeep in touch. So we really been good friends. That was when I first, you know, got in. The\nonly thing I didn\u2019t like about it, after basic training and advanced individual training. We both\nwere straight leg Infantry and they sent us to Germany. [Laughing.] Sent me right back to\nGermany, so that\u2019s the only part, that was kind of rough on me, you know. I got over it anyway.",
        "A: They might have, I never tried. I\u2019ve never been the kind that wanted special treatment or, you\nknow, special consideration or what have you. I\u2019ve never, ever used my, all the twenty-some\nyears in the Service, I\u2019ve never used my personal experience to try to get something different or\nspecial consideration or anything else. I never asked. I never even thought about asking for\nspecial consideration because of that. They sent me, I went and that\u2019s basically it.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t have to. Basically the U.S. got its own bases. There\u2019s some Germans who work\nthere on post, but you know, you don\u2019t have to mingle with the German population. You got PX,\nyou got snack bar, you got movies, you got a club. You got everything on post that you would\nneed. So for a long time I didn\u2019t go downtown. After a while I said, well, you know, go\ndowntown and look around, whatever, you know. You can\u2019t lock yourself away. Don\u2019t have to\nbe friends with anybody, but you can\u2019t... and after a while you can\u2019t blame a whole nation for\nwhat happened, it just doesn\u2019t make sense. So I mean I don\u2019t love them. [Laughing.] God\nknows I don\u2019t love them. But I have no particular hate for the Germans. You can\u2019t hate a\nwhole... if you had a specific individual that you knew was... you could hate them. But to me,\ndon\u2019t make no sense to hate a whole nation. I mean it just doesn\u2019t make sense. But anyway.\n24",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if they wondered or not. They never asked me personally, you know, about it. A\nlot of them, there was a lot of American guys that didn\u2019t go downtown. You know, so I don\u2019t\nthink that was particularly strange. If you knew what we went through, then you wouldn\u2019t, you\ndidn\u2019t have time. I mean Monday morning, you put your gear on and you marched out to the\ntraining area and you trained all week out in the training area. And then you came back\nThursday night, sometimes late at night and then you cleaned your weapons and stuff after\nmidnight before you even got to bed. And the next morning you had PT, you had classes, you\nhad this and that and then you had, Saturday morning you had a full field inspection. So you had\nSaturday afternoon and Sunday, that\u2019s all you had. Then Monday you went back to the field.\nSo, day and a half, I mean you had to ask who wants to go running around? There were a whole\nlot of other guys who didn\u2019t go a whole lot. Some ran around out to the night, the guesthouses\nand stuff, looking for German girls and all that kind of stuff. But you know, it wasn\u2019t unusual\nfor guys not to go out. You only had about a day and a half to rest and relax. So, I don\u2019t think it\nwas anything particular.",
        "A: Oh yeah. I went to, matter of fact, I used to get Saturdays off, Saturday mornings off, while they\nstood full field inspection. I had to lay my stuff out, but I didn\u2019t stand by my bed while the\ninspection was going on. I went to the Saturday morning prayers in the chapel, Jewish Chaplain.\nI went to, Friday night and Saturday morning I went to Chapel for services.",
        "A: Well, I never denied that I was Jewish, my Jewish identity. Everybody that knows me, knows\nthat I\u2019m Jewish. I\u2019m not hiding anything. I\u2019m just... what I\u2019m saying is that I have just... and I\nbelieve in God, don\u2019t get me wrong, even to this day. But I just do not believe that God really\ngives a hoot about any particular individual, you know. Something created this world. But I do\nnot believe that he cares about any particular individual, any... you know, which a lot of faith\nsays that, your personal, whatever, savior or He cares for you, whatever. In my view He don\u2019t\ncare for anybody. He created and it\u2019s up to you to, you know, to do the best you can. He\ncouldn\u2019t care less about anything at all.",
        "A: No, not really. I would listen to the sermon and all that stuff, but. No, I don\u2019t think I really\nprayed. I don\u2019t think I ever prayed since before the war. Well, I did when my father died. And\nwhen I go out to the... me and my step-brother, we usually meet once a year. We go down to\nFlorida because both my father and his mother is buried 1n cemetery there. And so, yes I say\nprayer for the dead at his grave. That I do, not because I believe, but because, to honor him, you\nknow, but it\u2019s not the same. So anyway. That is just me.\n25",
        "A: Yes, well there were always some, who hated everybody, you know. I really, didn\u2019t bother me\nany. I mean they didn\u2019t bother me personally, but I heard them talking, you know. I guess some\ndidn\u2019t know I was Jewish initially. Jewish jokes and this and that. But that, it didn\u2019t bother me\nany, and once they knew who I was, they won\u2019t do it in front of me. Once they knew I was\nJewish they did not tell jokes in front of me or anything like that. I don\u2019t know whether out of\nrespect for me or they knew if they did then me and him going to go to Fist City. I don\u2019t know\nwhich. [Laughing.] Anyway they did not. So, I personally I really can\u2019t tell, say that... I wasn\u2019t\nprosecuted or anything. I wasn\u2019t threatened or anything in that sense. Insensitivity? Sure, but,\nyou know, that\u2019s everyday life. Doesn\u2019t bother me any. Once they knew I was Jewish, then I\ndon\u2019t ever, never remember a guy twice telling jokes in front of me. And if he was a buddy of\nmine, then fine. I got a Jewish joke for you. I says, \u201cThat\u2019s okay, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d But that was\nfriendly banter not out of malicious, you know, hurtful type of thing. So that\u2019s quite different.\nNo, I can\u2019t, honestly can\u2019t say that I was in any way discriminated or treated unfairly or\ndifferently because I\u2019m Jewish while I was in the Service. I really, honestly can\u2019t say that. I\ndon\u2019t know maybe I was just fortunate, you know, the units that I was with. Or you know, what\nI can answer... matter of fact, once I had a Jewish Ist Sergeant. I had a Jewish guy working for\nme later on when I got up in the grades.",
        "A: Cold War.",
        "A: No, that was before me. I mean integration started before I got into the Service. The integration\nstarted with Truman during the Korean War. Prior to the Korean War he ordered the Army to\nintegrate its units. Because before you had separate black, separate... but we had a lot of racial\nproblems even when I first got into the Service in the sixties. As a matter of fact, we had a race\nriot and we had fights, racial fights and that kind of stuff. Because, you know, for me, since I did\nnot, wasn\u2019t raised with black, first time I ever seen blacks was when I got to the United States. I\nhad no prejudice. I wasn\u2019t raised with any kind of preyudice against anybody. So, I basically, as\nI always, I would take an individual for himself. You know, I rate an individual for the\nindividual. If he deserve respect, he got respect. If I didn\u2019t care for him, whether it\u2019s white,\nblack, whatever, then I didn\u2019t care for him. It wasn\u2019t because of his race. It\u2019s because I didn\u2019t\ncare for his character or his behavior or, you now. That\u2019s the way, you know, it was for me. But\nwhen I got in in 1960, you had a Brown Boot Army. I don\u2019t know if you understand what a\nBrown Boot Army was. But Brown Boot Army, you had... basically, we had, like, our\nCompany, we had a room that was empty. There wasn\u2019t a stitch of furniture, anything, it was an\nempty room. If you had any problem with anybody, you and him just went into the room and\nsettled your business with your fists. That\u2019s the way things were done. We had a Platoon\nSergeant, his name was Cooper. He was half Indian and half Irish. And he was about 64\u201d and\nweighed about two hundred thirty, somewhere around there. And you messed up and he\u2019d take\nyou into the room there and put you through the woodshed. So he had a very well behaved\n26\nPlatoon. Everybody worked together. You can\u2019t legislate away prejudice. That\u2019s something\nthat you learn at home from your parents, from your society, from your parents, whatever,\nchurch, whatever. What you can do with the Army 1s, you force civility. Regardless of whether\nyou like him or not, while you are 1n the unit and while you are in the Army, you treat him the\nway you expect to be treated. And later on when I became a Platoon Sergeant, whatever, that\nwas my guiding principle. I didn\u2019t care whether... I say, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you like him or not.\nThat\u2019s neither here nor there. You two work together, perform the job, be civil to each other.\nOnce you get to know each other maybe you like him.\u201d You know what I\u2019m saying? That\u2019s all\nyou can expect. You can\u2019t legislate love or you can\u2019t legislate racial prejudice away. That\u2019s\nsilly to even think about it. Just like now, all this silly thing about the gays and all that stuff. I\ndon\u2019t hate gays. Bible says that\u2019s wrong, but I would want to know if anybody in my unit was\ngay that I had to fight with. I might have to, he might have to give me mouth-to-mouth\nresuscitation. Or I had to go to the shower with him, if I know he is gay I would be\nuncomfortable. Not a question that I hate him. That question doesn\u2019t make no sense, because in\nthe Service you live so close together, you know? There is no little shower stall where you go in\nin your privacy. They got one big room with a bunch of shower heads where everybody takes\nshowers. And guys just feel uncomfortable when they know somebody is gay. And that\u2019s the\nproblem, not that anybody has anything against gays. In my view anyway. And you got AIDS,\nyou don\u2019t want to have to deal with somebody out in the battlefield if you get shot if you know\nhe is gay. You\u2019re going to deal with it, try to patch his wound, which you have to do. And then\ncatch AIDS from him, you know. Those are the issues that people don\u2019t think about when they\ncondemn the Armed Forces, well they\u2019re preyudice or whatever. There\u2019s a lot more to it than\nthat.",
        "A: Yeah, I was surprised. You know, because... I really didn\u2019t realize it till I got to this country due\nto the fact that I never encountered any black people. So when I worked for Fiber, for Ephart\nFiber and Rubber Company, they had blacks there and all that. I was friends with, I treated\nthem, like everybody with respect just like I treat everybody else. I got to be friend with one of\nthem. But I noticed that every time like when you sit down to eat or this and that or lunch, or\nwhatever, you would see all the whites congregating. All the blacks would go sit over there.\nThere was no interaction between the races. That kind of struck me funny. So, I sit down and I\nsit down with...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n27\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: So anyway, the Fiber... I worked with a fellow worker who was black, and when everybody\nwent to lunch I noticed all the whites were sitting on one side and all the blacks were sitting\nsomewhere else. And the guy I worked with, he sat down to eat lunch. I just got my lunch and\nsat down beside him. He kind of looked at me a little funny. I didn\u2019t realize there was anything\nwrong with it, because, you know, I had no idea it was not supposed to be that way.",
        "A: Sure, yeah, every morning, every day lunch we usually, he and me, we\u2019d sit down and have\nlunch and talk. He was asking me about Israel and I was telling him about Israel. [Laughing. ]\nAnd you know, he would tell me about what they were doing in Newark, his neighborhood and\nall that. Yeah, I mean, you know, we became friends.",
        "A: My first tour I was Bamberg. I was with the Ist Battle Group, 15th Infantry. And that\u2019s the\nsame outfit that Eddie Murphy was in the Second World War. The most decorated individual in\nthe Second, Third Infantry Division. And Eisenhower was in the same outfit, at one time\nCompany Commander a long, long time ago. So, it\u2019s a famous unit and I served it two years in\nthe Straight Leg Infantry.",
        "A: At the time I got out... I was draftee, so when I finished my two years I got out and went home,\nback to Miami and looked around and decided I was going to go into heating and air\nconditioning. And so I went to school and then I had to work. And I said, \u201cWell this ain\u2019t going\nto get it.\u201d No time for myself or anything else. Went to school, from school you went to work\nand next morning got up, went to school, went to work. You had no time for yourself, nothing.\nSo I said, \u201cWell I\u2019m going to go back into the Army, this time voluntarily. I\u2019ll make the Army a\ncareer.\u201d Because I liked the Service, its purpose. And during that time we went up to a place\ncalled L.Z. X-Ray, which is now longer classified anyway. But it was up on the\nCzechoslovakian border and there was a bridge there that was mined. And you went up there,\npulled your duty for a month at a time. And if the balloon ever would go up, or the East\nGermans would attack the West, the job was to blow up the bridge. It was all mined and all that.\nSo then I realized, I seen the border and all that, I realized that this whole, back basically, the\nRussians were back to where the Nazis were. Plus I read, I don\u2019t know then or a little later,\nSolzhenitsyn\u2019s book about the gulags and all that. And I said, heck, they\u2019re no better than the\nGermans were. So anyway I decided I was going to go back into the Service. So, I re-enlisted\nand lo and behold they went and sent me back to Germany. [Laughing.] That was my second\ntour in Germany. We were sent to Kaiserslautern and spent three years there. It was an Army\nDepot. I went into the maintenance field there. Then I came back, went to the 18\" Airborne\nCorps in Bragg, North Carolina. And from Bragg, North Carolina there was a little altercation in\n28\nthe Dominican Republic. There was a Leftist uprising and they had to send in the 82\u2122 Airborne\nand I was with the 556 Light Maintenance Company and we were in there for support. My\nplatoon went in to support the 82\u2122 in their operation in the Dominican Republic. That was \u201865.\nCame back from there, our unit was declared D-1, which means that we were alerted that we\nwere going to get shipped to \u2018Nam. So we had to pack everything, all the equipment of the unit\nand all that stuff. That was going on, the deadline rates which means the equipment,\ninoperability of a lot of the equipment on post at Fort Bragg got so big that they told us to unpack\nour stuff and go back to work. [Laughing.] So, we went back to work and then they started\ntaking individuals. Like me, they took me, not me, but from the unit just individuals and shipped\nthem to Vietnam. So 1966, I was sent to Vietnam. I was there in the Central Highlands for a\nyear. And say well I\u2019m just going to go back to the States and get shipped back here again, so I\nmight as well extend. So, I extended, got promoted and was sent to the Korean Tiger Division,\nsupport of the Korean Tiger Division, along Highway 1, between Bomber 2 and Elza English\n(ph)*. Anytime the Korean Tiger went out on a sweep and destroy, we went with them in\nsupport of them. In \u201868 I came back to, from \u201866 through \u201868, I was in Vietnam. I came back\nfrom Vietnam in, I think it was November \u201868 and was assigned to Fort Knox. I reported in, in\nDecember \u201868 to Fort Knox and I became an instructor in the Armor School.",
        "A: No, I was all for the war. I believe we did the right thing. And I still believe we did the right\nthing, actually. Except you can\u2019t fight a war when the people are not with you. To me that was\nthe thing, because we were justified in what we were doing. I mean the North Koreans were\nattacking the South and it proved, I mean, it shamefully, the reporters and everything, they all\ntwisted everything to suit their views. But in fact, we were right. The North Koreans basically,\nif not for us, they probably would have gobbled up all of Southeast Asia, the Communists. They\nwound up, years later, they took over Cambodia. Laos, they already controlled. So basically the\ndominant theory was right, even though the reporters disputed it. So, we stood up against the\nCommunists. And that\u2019s eventually after Reagan, finally they collapsed. But we basically\ncontained them and that was Truman\u2019s policy, containing the Communists from spreading. If we\nwouldn\u2019t have opposed them, heck probably over two-thirds of the world today would have been\nall in the communist top. You know, so, in my view we did the right thing. I know a lot of\npeople opposed it. And I got called a baby killer when I came back on leave from \u2018Nam. After\nmy first year there I extended, so they gave me thirty days\u2019 leave. So I came in, in Fort Lewis,\nWashington and everybody said, \u201cChange clothes. Get in civilian clothes, don\u2019t go out in the\nairport in the clothes.\u201d I said, \u201cI fought for this country in these clothes, it was my uniform. [Il\nbe doggone if I\u2019m going to change clothes. I\u2019m going home in uniform.\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019re crazy,\nyou\u2019re crazy.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Anyway I went and I went to Seattle to the airport and there were\nHare Krishna and all them other ones. And, \u201cBaby killer!\u201d I went and punched him in the mouth\nand knocked him down. [Laughing.] A cop was standing there looking, he didn\u2019t, he just\nsmiled, he didn\u2019t say nothing. And I just kept walking. Don\u2019t call me no baby killer. I never\nkilled no baby. I came home in my uniform, and I hauled back to \u2018Nam after a month leave, but\non my uniform and went back. I believe firmly in, you know, I\u2019m not hiding. I think we did the\n? Schlisser was with E-Co 43\" Sig BN, in the Binh Dinh mountains of the Central Highlands.\n29\nright thing. I know a lot of people disagree. But it\u2019s not true. We didn\u2019t lose a single battle in\n\u2018Nam. Nota single, they can\u2019t point to one single engagement that the United States Army or\nthe Marine Corps, the United States Forces lost. Not a single one. Every battle that we fought\nagainst the North Vietnamese we won. But they made it out that we lost, and we didn\u2019t. The\npeople who lost is the comm... the politicians here in Washington. Because they first of all tied\none hand behind your back and said you can only fight with one hand. And you don\u2019t go to war\nthat way. It\u2019s ridiculous. So anyway, so yeah, I thought it was justified. I was for the Vietnam\nWar and I still say it was justified. Everything we found out up to now it just reinforces my view\nthat we were justified in doing it. Not the way we did it. Now, I agree we should never have\nfought the way we did. We should have gone in with the purpose of winning and we should\nhave won. The way you did that is you gone into North Vietnam and kicked their butt and got it\nover with. Instead of just, you know, \u201cWell, you can\u2019t get into Cambodia, you can\u2019t bomb this,\nyou can\u2019t do that.\u201d You can\u2019t fight no war that a-way and win. Crazy. Just like, you know, I\nwas interviewed by WAVE 3 TV. They wanted to know about Kosovo, what my views were. I\ntold them, I said, \u201cWell I\u2019m not talking for the Jewish community. You want my view, I'll talk\nfor myself. My view.\u201d And I said, \u201cFirst of all, anybody said that is a genocide 1s a liar. There\nwas no genocide in Kosovo.\u201d And now it\u2019s proved out, it\u2019s true. There wasn\u2019t any. Sure, I\u2019m\nnot saying there wasn\u2019t atrocities. But there\u2019s a big difference between atrocities and genocide.\nI told them, \u201cI wish they would have taken my family and put them on a passenger train and take\nthem to the border and put us off. All of us would have been together.\u201d You know. I don\u2019t call\nthat genocide. Sure they killed some here, killed there, but that\u2019s atrocities they did to scare the\npopulation so they would run. That\u2019s a long ways from genocide. Now Cambodia, that was\ngenocide. Did anybody open their mouth and say anything or do anything, where it really\ncounted? No, they didn\u2019t. You know. To me, we have no business in Kosovo, that stuff been\ngoing on now for hundreds of years. And even while we sitting there, you know, they killing\neach other. The minute we move out of there, we be there a hundred years from now, we be still\nsitting there to keep them apart. They need to settle themselves. And same thing in Bosnia.\nBosnia, I don\u2019t care what anybody says. The minute European forces get out of there, United\nStates and NATO get out of Bosnia, they\u2019Il be right at each other\u2019s throat. And they say Kosovo,\nyou know, ethnic cleansing. Well, where were we when Croatia forced out over half a million\nSerbs? We didn\u2019t say a word, so what 1s the difference here? The Croats I hate. They were with\nthe Nazis. I mean they were allies to the Nazis. We caused, the United States caused most of the\nstuff that\u2019s going on in Balkan now. It\u2019s our fault. Okay? When Croatia, when Tito died and\nCroatia was the first one to declare that they are, their independence. Without asking any\nquestions, anything, right away we jumped in and recognized them as independent country.\nOkay? Well, they murdered a quarter of a million Serbs during the Second World War,\nincluding, plus Jews. The Croats. Okay? You think that the last of the Serbs are going, who\nlive there, are going to agree to come again under the rule of the Croats? You got to be crazy. I\nmean, you got to know the history of the world before you meddle. And if you don\u2019t understand\nwhat the history 1s, they got no business meddling in there where you don\u2019t know what the hell\nyou're doing. That\u2019s my view anyway. I\u2019m very upset about it, because I don\u2019t think that, you\nknow, we had any business in there at all. But anyway, when they asked me I told them, I said\nthere was no, you know, genocide there. There might have been atrocities, but there\u2019s no\ngenocide from what I consider, you know. They were comparing it to the Holocaust.\n30",
        "A: Yeah. They had, they taped the thing when I was talking at the Jewish Community Center on the\nRemembrance. So they knew my background. So they came. I told them I\u2019m not talking for the\nJewish community. You know, matter of fact, I\u2019ve had very little contact with the Jewish\ncommunity, but if you want to know my opinion, personal opinion, I\u2019ll gladly tell you what I\nthink. And that\u2019s exactly what I told them. So, anyway.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, I came with it to this country. I\u2019ve always believed that the United States represents the\nfreedom of the Free World. In other words, even as a, when I was, right after the war in Sweden,\nyou know. And some of the children in the orphanage, whatever, they were for the Russians, the\ncommunists, Left inclination. We always had big argument, even as a little boy then, and I was\nalways defending the United States, because I felt, you know with my dad being from, born here\nand everything, I felt, you know, as an American, [Laughing.] even though I had never been\nhere. Anyway, I felt a kinship and I always believed that the United States basically represents\nthe human freedom. And I still do, you know. And it\u2019s fine with me. I have no problem with\nsomebody like Joan Baez and all the other ones who opposed the war. That\u2019s why we fought. I\nmean, they have the right to speak their view. They\u2019re Americans and I respect their views. I\nmight not agree with it, but I respect it. I cannot expect, accept somebody like Jane Fonda, who\nwent to North Vietnam, you know, with North Vietnamese troops and there was prisoners of war\nin the Hanoi Hilton and stuff. And they went in to look at them. Any show that she is in, that is\nnot on my TV. I will not. Pll turn the station. I will not have anything that Jane Fonda has\nplayed in, movie, whatever. It may be the greatest movie in the world. It\u2019s not going to play on\nmy TV.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. They were misled in my view by the reporting that was going on here. Obviously\nnone of them wanted to go to fight. And so if you don\u2019t want to go to fight, what do you do?\nYou oppose and you riot and you do everything else you can to get out of it. I don\u2019t know what\nthe motive... I\u2019m not setting any alterior motives. It might have been very noble motives for\nthem to oppose it. I\u2019m not condemning anybody. I respect Muhammad Ali. He opposed the\nVietnam War, but he had the courage of his convictions. He stayed in this country. He said I\nwon\u2019t fight because I\u2019m not, you know, whatever. And was willing to go to jail if he had to for\nwhat he believed in. I respect that. I cannot respect someone like Clinton, you know, who did\neverything he could to stay out and then he lies about it. You know, what kind of principle is\nthat? He\u2019s not a principled person to begin with. That\u2019s my view. I always voted. Every\nelection I always vote. I believe in participating. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m just reading a book\n31\nabout the history of Democracy in the United States, from back before the colonies, how the\nDemocracy developed. Just reading the book right now.",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. [Laughing.]| I was stationed here in Fort Knox in \u201869, the beginning of\n\u201869. And I had a friend, Larry, and he was from Bristol, Tennessee.

I\ndidn\u2019t lose anything there.\u201d So months later his car broke down and he had no way... he was\nmarried and his wife was back in Bristol. And he had no way to get home.

I worked with him on his car, trying to get\nit fixed. We couldn\u2019t get it fixed in time. So, I said, \u201cWell, Pll take you home.\u201d That\u2019s the way\nit went.

That\u2019s the exact\nway it happened. So we got there and then Helen was, that evening, we got there late in the\nevening, late in the afternoon. That evening went out to the VFW Club to dance and drink.\nAnyway, she was there. And then, that was April, and I think a week or ten days later or two\nweeks later was the Kentucky Derby. So, Ray\u2019s wife was going to come up here, so Helen said,\n\u201cWell, Pl come with you.\u201d You know, so, \u201cOkay,\u201d so, one thing led to another. So that\u2019s how\nwe met.

Even though I wasn\u2019t liberated by American troops, but you know, I know\nthat he had a hand in liberating me, you know. So I\u2019m glad when I can help one of them. So,\nthat\u2019s what I do. I try to help veterans as much as I can. That\u2019s my thing.",
        "A: I retired medically in \u201883. I had two heart attacks and I had my colon removed. The VA rated\nme at two hundred percent, not a hundred. They can only get a hundred, but if you add all my\nstuff together, you get two hundred percent. I was exposed to Agent Orange. They sprayed that\nstuff down on me. We\u2019re watching this thing fly over us and spray. We were underneath it. So,\nyeah, I\u2019m basically a hundred percent disabled rated since \u201884, June, July of \u201883. That\u2019s when\nthey removed my colon. I\u2019ve got a plastic bag. That didn\u2019t stop me. I just keep on trucking.\n[Laughing.] I\u2019m a tough dude. I\u2019ve got diabetes. Nobody in my family has diabetes, never had.\nAgain now it comes out, there\u2019s a study going on that shows that guys exposed to Agent Orange\nhave twice or three times as high a chance of getting diabetes as the normal population. So, I\ndon\u2019t know if that\u2019s what caused it or something else, but anyway. So, I got heart disease. I got\ncolon gone. I got diabetes. Taking about twenty-some pills a day. But I ain\u2019t quit. I\u2019m still\ngoing. I\u2019m sixty-five, will be in November and until God lets me stay around I will do the best I\ncan and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: One son, he\u2019s adopted. He\u2019s not mine. I adopted him. He was my wife\u2019s child. He was just a\nyoung boy, and his name is Anthony Keith Schlisser. I don\u2019t have any children of my own.\nAnyway, not that I know of.",
        "A: Yes. We talked about it. With him I talked about it, not in particular details, just in general\nterms, so that he\u2019ll understand where I\u2019m coming from. And what my views are and why I got\nmy views the way I got them and all that. Yeah, we are pretty close, him and me. We\nunderstand each other. We are good friends. We are close.\n35",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. I like Kentucky. I made my home here, and I feel like I\u2019m a Kentuckian.\n\u201868, ve been living here off and on just about. Since \u201883 when I retired, I\u2019ve been living here\ncontinuously since then.",
        "A: The open space. I hate cities, people on top of each other. I like feeling the open space. I like\nthe country. And I like the hunting and fishing, used to, I\u2019m not much able anymore. I used to\nlike to go out fishing and hunting. I like country music. I like Bluegrass. [Laughing.] Weird\nfora Jew, right? But anyway... I used to square dance. I\u2019m just me. I\u2019m not anybody else.\nThat\u2019s the things I like. I also like classic. I like operas. So.",
        "A: Marry my wife Helen? I never asked anybody. I never told them I\u2019m marrying. I never ask\npermission. I married. Yeah, they accepted her. You can probably ask her about that, but I\nthink they did. My dad loved her. My dad once he got to know her, he loved her and so did my\nstep-mother, she also loved her. But I really didn\u2019t, you know, I really didn\u2019t care because it\u2019s\nmy choice. It\u2019s my life and I have to live it, not them. If they didn\u2019t like it, tough. That\u2019s the\nway I felt about it. You know, I know a lot of people want to be loved and all that good stuff,\nbut me, I just go with what I think is right. That\u2019s what I do.",
        "A: I think she is. I dare not say that for sure. [Laughing.] I think, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what she is.\nShe\u2019s a Christian, anyway. But I think she is... not Lutheran. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s a\nPresbyterian.",
        "A: She used to. She used to. When we go down to home, her home church, she goes to church on\nSundays with her brother, who is a deacon in the church and all that. I don\u2019t go with them, but\nshe goes. And even when we first got married, she insisted I go with her. She won\u2019t go, she by\nherself and blah, blah, blah. So for a couple times I went with her, just out of respect for her and\nher family. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable though. And I told her, I said, \u201cLook, that\u2019s your faith, not\nmine. Not that I... you want to go, you go. I have no problems, you know. Ill gladly take you\nthere and Ill gladly come and pick you up.\u201d I tried to talk her into going here to church if she\nwanted to go. I'll gladly take her and there and bring her home gladly. Have no problem. Just\ndon\u2019t ask me to go. And so from now, she goes with her brother and stuff and it\u2019s fine. Yeah,\nshe believes, she\u2019s got faith, which is fine with me. I have no quarrel with anybody who has\nfaith. It\u2019s just me and my views. I don\u2019t push my views on anybody else. I respect everybody\nelse\u2019s faith as long as he practices and don\u2019t expect somebody else to do it. You understand\nwhat I\u2019m saying? Don\u2019t force, don\u2019t try to push iton me. Your faith is your faith and I respect\nyou, you and your faith. But that\u2019s your faith and don\u2019t try to convert me or push me or get me\nto... you know.\n36",
        "A: That\u2019s a tough one. I guess at one time, at one time, yes. I guess at one time that occurred to me,\nokay. But... I shouldn\u2019t say this, but anyway. While I was in the military in Israel, okay, we\nwere on duty in the Jerusalem sector. It wasn\u2019t a war, it was after. The Jordanians still had the\nold city. And to go to our post we had to go through a section of Jerusalem called Mea Shearim,\nwhich means \u201ca hundred gates,\u201d which was the ultra, ultra, Orthodox. And every time we had to\ngo through there to switch reliefs, you know, we had to go through their section, their\nneighborhood. And on Sabbath we used to go through there with a vehicle. They used to stone\nus. Okay? So I looked at this and I said to myself, what\u2019s the difference between the fanatics,\nthe Jewish fanatics and the Ayatollah fanatics and all the other fanatics? There\u2019s not one iota\ndifference between them. They\u2019re all zealots for whatever their faith is. So, I reverted back to\nwhat I told you initially. I believe in Israel, beneath the country, for no other reason is the Jewish\npeople as a nation have a homeland. But for me, not for religious purposes. There\u2019s, like I was\nthere visiting my sister in, you know for Passover this year. And there\u2019s such a conflict between\nthe real religious and the non-religious there, you know. It\u2019s crazy. You believe in your faith,\npractice it. Leave the other people alone. If they believe in... my sister is like me. She doesn\u2019t\nbang her head against the wall. She believes in God and she holds basically all the Jewish\nholidays. She has to because it\u2019s national holidays. But she\u2019s not religious, goes to Temple all\nthe time and all that stuff. Everybody has a right to live their own life the way they see it\u2019s fit.\nAnd that\u2019s what I believe in. I believe in everybody should do, if I respect you... my neighbor\nhere is a very religious Baptist guy. A wonderful guy, wonderful friend. He\u2019s been friend with\nme now for thirty years, since we\u2019ve been here. We\u2019ve been real close friends. We help each\nother. Anything I got he\u2019s welcome to it and the same with him. Anything I need, if I needed\nhelp, he\u2019d be there. I know he would. That\u2019s how good of friends we are. And I respect him.\nHe goes to church on Wednesdays. He goes to church on Sundays. He\u2019s a church elder. I\nrespect, I respect my brother-in-law, you know. It\u2019s their faith, it\u2019s fine. He never try to force,\nyou know, push his stuff on me. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Everybody should... and I believe if you\nhave a faith, you should live it. Not go to church on Sunday and then cheat people on Monday.\nThat\u2019s my principle, that\u2019s me. What you hear, what I say is what I mean. That\u2019s always been\nmy, I don\u2019t say something that I don\u2019t mean. If I tell you I was going to do something, you can\nput in the bank that I was going to do it. Except if I\u2019m dead or laying there paralyzed where I\ncan\u2019t move. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. If I promised to do something, I will do it. My word\nis my bond, basically. With me, you can shake hands with me, that\u2019s just like a contract. If I say\nsomething I was going to do, I\u2019m going to do it. And that\u2019s all there 1s to it.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, it has. And I think I\u2019ve been doing okay. I mean I have no problems. With my\neducation background and with everything else, I guess the biggest asset I had 1s my dedication.\nI never been a good speller. I mean I\u2019m not stupid, you know. Don\u2019t think I am stupid. I\u2019m not.\nYou know, I might not have book learning to the max or get a certificate. But I made up for that\nby reading a lot and getting my education in the school of hard knocks, is what taught me. They\n37\nknew wherever the job needed to get done, as long as... turn me loose, tell me what you want\ndone, give me the resources to do it with and I will get it done. That was me. [Laughing. |",
        "A: Drove me?",
        "A: Done my part?",
        "A: I really couldn\u2019t tell you. Something inner, something inside of me drove me and what it was I\nreally couldn\u2019t put it into words. If I would say any particular thing... I mean, you got to take\neach one on its own merit. You can\u2019t just lump them all together. The war in Israel was a\nquestion of survival for the country. Because they closed the Suez Canal down. The lifeline for\nIsrael, because the oil must come in. At the time there was no pipeline from the Red Sea, so all\nthe oil was coming through the Suez Canal and it was delivered to Haifa to the refineries there,\nokay? So I didn\u2019t make the decision to go to war. I was just a guy who was in the Reserves. I\nwas already out of the Service in Israel. And we had a password and when you heard your\npassword, you packed your bags and you reported to your unit. You had a specific location\nwhere you met. It was a civilian mobilization of the Army and you went and did what you were\nsupposed to have done. I guess duty, if anything that drove me I guess was duty, responsibility,\nduty to what I believe was right. If there was anything to define. Now as far as \u2018Nam, again, I\ndidn\u2019t... 1t was the United States Government decision to have, to go to the aid of the South\nVietnamese. It wasn\u2019t mine. I just, again it was duty. I was in the Service, I was a career\nsoldier. Why would you be a career soldier? What, you\u2019re going to run when the fighting starts?\nThat\u2019s what you train for all the time. To when the nation calls you, then you be there to do\nyour... you know, and do your duty. And I hope anyway, that I was instrumental in saving some\nguy\u2019s life, because with my experience, you know, I helped guide a lot of other guys to maybe, if\nI wasn\u2019t there maybe somebody who had less experience would have got him killed. I\u2019m not\nsaying that would have been the case, but basically the professional guys in the Service, the non-\ncommissioned officers, who had experience from the Korean War and then served in \u2018Nam,\nthey\u2019re basically who trained the new guys, you know, and got them understand what a war is all\nabout. How to survive. If anything I guess, duty is the main, main theme here, I think, from\nwhat you\u2019re asking. Why I joined the Service, why I volunteered and stayed in the Service,\nthat\u2019s a different story. That had a lot to do with economy and all this stuff. Plus I had an\nopportunity to use my talent, my God-given talents that I had in the best way and advance my\nown career was in the military instead of the civilian life. But as far as when the war started, I\nthink the main thing was duty. I mean duty to do your job.\n38",
        "A: I was actually in the Signal outfit. The first time I was there I was in a place called Binh Dinh\nMountain, which was a seven thousand foot mountain. And it was about, I guess twenty miles\nfrom Dalat. There was no road in or out. All our supplies had to come by air. We got re-\nsupplied. And up there we had a relay, communication relay station to the North side, North\nVietnam and part of South Vietnam, the north part and the south part. Plus we had Air Force up\nthere, who were relaying instructions to the B-52 Bombers. So we\u2019re sitting on a seven thousand\nfoot mountain, and jungle all the way around us. Charlie was down there. We lived in bunkers.\nWe got attacked by mortars, you know, and that kind of that stuff. We didn\u2019t have no direct\nconfrontation. Then from there I moved to a place called Phu Ti Valley\u2019 which is not far from\nNha Trang and there we were with the Korean Tiger Division. That is an Infantry Division, who\nwere actually doing the combat. We were supporting them and going out to, when they went out\nfor a sweep and destroy mission, we went out to provide them communication. So, we got shot\nat, but we weren\u2019t involved in direct, you know, face-to-face, grunt job. The Koreans did that.\nSo, but I was running Highway One between Ban Me Thuot, and every morning before you even\ngot on there, you had to wait for them to clear all the mines out of there. So you never knew\nfrom one minute to the next when you\u2019re going to get ona mine. And then the Vietnamese had\nthis nice little trick, they would have this little hot pot, motorcycle-type tax1 cabs. And you\nwould come around with your truck and they would pull out in front of you to slow you down,\nlike ina curve. And you had to stop down to not run over them. And when you slowed down,\nthey would ambush you and start shooting you, at you from the side. So what you define\n\u201ccombat\u201d? In Vietnam there wasn\u2019t any really... no, I wasn\u2019t in the infantry unit. But in our\nbase camp, we got attacked. We killed nine guys there and the stetchel (ph)charged us. One of\nthem was our base barber that we killed. He was a Viet Cong. So you never knew who your, I\nmean who was your friend, who was your enemy. It was a weird kind of a war. There was no\nfront line, like in Korea or Second World War. You didn\u2019t know who was your friend or who\nwas your foe, besides your own buddies in your own unit. Because all Vietnamese could have\nbeen Viet Cong. We had to go to this and we had to lock down our gas caps on our trucks.\nWhat they would do if you didn\u2019t have the locks on them, they would take a hand grenade, put a\nrubber band around it, pull the pin, drop it inside your gas tank. Then the gas would eat away the\nrubber band, pop the thing and blow you to smithereens. So, you had to actually lock down with\na lock, you had to lock your caps so they couldn\u2019t stick nothing in there. Children were, they\nwould hawk on the side of the road. They would try to sell you coke. Well if you\u2019re stupid\nenough and you bought that coke, a lot of them had ground glass in it. If you drank that stuff it\ntore your guts up inside with shreds, slivers of glass. [Laughing.] So it was a different kind of\nwar. It wasn\u2019t the type of war where you could say who was a combat guy and who wasn\u2019t. But\nno, I wasn\u2019t... you know, I was on sweep and destroy missions with the Koreans. I took\nconvoys from the seven thousand-foot mountain down to the air field about twenty miles away to\npick up our rations and water, drinking water and all that stuff. We got ambushed periodically\non the road and all that. Well, you call that combat? I would call that combat, but I wasn\u2019t one\nof those guys that were crawling down those tunnels, tunnel rats or anything like that. I wasn\u2019t\nin the Infantry outfit fighting. I got a good friend who works with me as a volunteer, he was\nSpecial Forces. He was on long range patrol. They went out to search Charlie. Now I would\nsay he was in the trenches more than I was. I just reacted when Charlie attacked me. He went\n3 Also called Rok Valley.\n39\nout looking for him, that\u2019s different. But I did whatever was assigned me. I came to \u2018Nam. I\nwas supposed to go to a direct support unit. Not even get close to where the combat was. I was\nsupposed to work on repairing vehicles and stuff. I got to Cam Ranh Bay and they said, \u201cEh,\nyou are now, guess what. You are now a 6-3 Charlie. You are a motor sergeant. You are going\nup in the Central Highlands.\u201d Instead of staying right there in Nha Trang. Believe me, two years\nin \u2018Nam and I never seen Saigon. I don\u2019t know what Saigon looks like. I never been there. All\nmy time was up in the Central Highlands. I took two R&R tours, one I went to Australia and one\nI went to Hong Kong. Get away from it to relax.",
        "A: I was E-8, Master Sergeant. I graduated from Sergeant Major Academy. I was going to make E-\n9, but I got sick and I got medically retired before I actually got promoted.
