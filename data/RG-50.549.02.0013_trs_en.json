        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection,\nthis is an interview with Regina Gelb, conducted by Regina Baier, on March 18th, 1998\nconducted with Regina Gelb on September 30th, 1991. The United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this\ninterview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Let us begin with your name -- your\nbirth name and your name now and also when you were born and where.",
        "Answer: All right. Well, my name is Regina Gelb, born Laks, L-a-k-s. 1am also known\nas Renia, R-e-n-i-a. So you could refer to me as Renia and Regina, but -- but for all\npractical -- for all official purposes, I really am Regina, so you can only find me under\nthat, but everybody else knows me also as Renta. Gelb, obviously is my married name.",
        "Q: When you were born --",
        "A: Oh yes, I was born in Starachowice and I\u2019Il spell that for you because it\u2019s a very long\nname. S-t-a-r-a-c-h-o-w-i-c-e. That was, at the time of my birth, also known as\nWierzbnik, W-1-e-r-z-b-n-1-k. I was born on December 16, 1929. I just want to add that at\ntime of my birth, I was really born in Wierzbnik, but Wierzbnik was combined with\nStarachowice into one town and now you would never probably -- you will not find\nWierzbnik on the map, but you will find Starachowice. So, I sort of refer to the fact that I\nwas born in Starachowice because if you want to look me up, you will not find me\notherwise, except in Starachowice.",
        "Q: Whereabouts is Starachowice?",
        "A: Yes. Starachowice is in central Poland, about two and a half hours by car from\nWarsaw, directly south. It is an industrial town and it was -- if we go a li-little back in\nhistory, Poland, as you know, was divided up to 1918, between Russia, Prussia and\nHungary. We were -- I was born in the very heart of Poland, which was called in those\ndays, Congress Poland, because when Napoleon went through Poland, he carved up a\npiece of free Poland and that was the -- the core of the -- the core -- the -- the center of\nPoland, where Starachowice 1s located. Now, th-the town, as I a-am fond of remembering\n-- reminding everybody -- the fact that the town was an -- an industrial town played a\ngreat part in my surviving the war. The reason being that after the first war, when Poland\nbecame independent in 1918, the -- the marshall pusitski who was then the -- the head of\nthe Polish government -- it was decided that Poland has to arm itself, so they carved up a\n-- an industrial complex within the heart of Poland and they started -- there was ore to be\nsmelted and big factories went up. How this historic fact relates to my survival is\nprobably a bit farfetched, but it isn\u2019t, for the reason that the factory di -- me -- the factory\nin our town, which prior to the war, smelted ore and pro -- was -- produced iron of all\nkinds of locomotives and -- and meat grinders, from the big to the smallest, was\nconverted to a munitions factory as soon as the war broke out. By virtue of which, the\nGermans decided that the entire area, which contained these different factories, which\nwere converted into munitions factories, would need le -- slave labor. Therefore, people\nwho were living within that area, were first used as slave labor. Of course, in due time\nthey would die out and they would be shipped, whatever. The numbers would always be\nsupplemented by new people, who were either shipped out of towns or caught or\nwhichever way. The number --eventually the number of slave labor people working for\nthe -- in that factory, was constant, even though people were dying like flies. But of\ncourse we\u2019re -- are getting ahead of our story here, because this is only the beginning. I\njust meant to make the connection that Starachowice, the factory was -- before the war,\nthe factory was in Starachowice proper. The bedroom of Starachowice proper was\nWierzbnik. That was basically a town where everything took place, commerce and so on\nand it was a very sizable Jewish community, about one third of the people living in\nWierzbnik were Jews. And they were generally, as they always were -- they were\nmerchants and they were cobblers and carpenters and so on and they -- there also was\nsuch a thing as the Jewish intelligencia in those days. Of which my parents were part. But\nthat was the town and -- and Starachowice did not have Jews living in -- 1n it, because the\nJews were not allowed to work in the factory, strange as it might seem. Before the war,\nthe Jews were not allowed to live or work in the factory. In -- and, as I said, eventually\nthe two were combined so by then you couldn\u2019t do -- have these restrictions but that was\nthe fact, before the war.",
        "Q: I just have one follow-up question on that story --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: -- before I would like to go to your -- your childhood and your family, actually.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: What were the reasons? Were they anti-Semitic reasons or were they different\nreasons?",
        "A: I could not tell you. You know, there are certain things which to this day remain a\nmystery to me, because I was a child. I just knew that Jewish people did not work in the\nfact -- in the plant and that there were no Jew -- Jews living there. And I'll tell you,\nactually why -- I'll tell you, I -- I almost know now, because I\u2019ve read some -- some\nbooks on the subjects about Starachowice that were written actually the last 20 years.\nStarachowice was at one time, built in colonies for people directly involved with the\nfactory. In other words, after 1918, when that factory went up, they started building\ncolonies, one was called Roboneetcha, which 1s for the workers and another one was for\nthe -- for the, I guess for the administration over there. But they had these colonies, they\nwere what you call now, you know in America, you have a lot of these developments.\nYou know, you have houses and the -- the -- but the -- the basic commerce was still in\nWierzbnik. The reason Jews did not live in Starachowice, because to qualify, you had to\nwork in the factory, you see? Yeah. And that was true up to the very war. And when the\nwar broke out, obviously things got totally changed because the resettlement of Jews\ncame into being and all this, but this is a story that we\u2019ll probably continue later.",
        "Q: So maybe if you can tell us a little bit about your family now. About your early\nupbringing, your daily life?",
        "A: All right. Well, first of all, we were a family of five -- father, mother and the three of\nus. My oldest sister, Anna, who is also called Hanya. Her last name now is Wilson and\nshe\u2019s a Canadian. My sec -- my middle sister, Krisha, who\u2019s also called Kris, but her true\nname is Rosalia Kristina Lehrman. And we call her Krisha for short. And my name,\nRegina, which also is Renia. We were a secular type of family. The town was very\nJewish in the sense that it had a very sizable Orthodox Jewish community. But my\nparents, of course were part of the Jewish community, but we were not Orthodox, we\nwere not -- we were secular. And my parents were very much oriented to Zionism. But\nbefore we proceed that, let me just explain to you the other background. The fact that we\nspoke Polish at home, we were brought up in the Polish language. Both my parents spoke\nPolish beautifully, even though my father\u2019s background was really German. He came\nfrom Solsnoviets, which is western Poland, which -- Salesia, in Salesia. And he was\nbrought up in the German language, because obviously he went to school -- he was an\neducated man -- he went to school pri -- prior to the f -- end of the first war, prior to\n1918, which means that, depending on which sphere of influence you lived in, that was\nthe language in which you were taught. Well, my pa -- my father was a German, in that\nsense, because he -- he spoke German beautifully. To this day I talk about his\nencyclopedia because that played a big part in the war, also. He had his encyclopedia in\nGerman, he -- he was subscribing to magazines and other things and he spoke German\nbeautifully, but of course his Polish was wonderful. Mother, on the other ha -- hand,\ncame from the so-called Russian part of Poland, so she spoke Russian in addition to her\nPolish. But we were brought up at home in the Polish language. My parents knew\nYiddish and spoke to each other only if they didn\u2019t want the kids to understand. Now my\nfather was an engineer in the forestry business. That was a very big business in Poland.\nThey employed people who had good education, a good scientific, what\u2019s that to say?\nScience background, which my father had from his German education. Assessing forestry\nfor lumber and such. And there was a big sawmill in Starachowice -- in -- in Wierzbnik,\nStarachowice -- belonged to Jewish people, I think they were Austrians. And they were --\nthat was their ownership. And they employed -- it -- 1t was a sizable type of operation\nbecause th-the lumber was -- the -- the forests that were cut elsewhere, brought in, were --\nwere turned into lumber. And mother was -- as it was true in Poland, she was not what\nyou call a working woman, not until 1938 or so and I -- P\u2019ll come to that. And we had a\nvery good life. Of course we had a maid, as everybody else did and when I tell people\nhow it was when -- we had a -- a seamstress come to the house, you know and people\nused to buy goods and they used to sew it for you, the -- you know, the seamstress would\ncome and she would sew the sheets and she would sew the skirts for the kids and the\nblouses and all that. And this was of course another totally other way of life. And then\nyou had the laundress, she came and she did the big laundry and -- and she took it to the\nmangle and I told somebody about the mangle and said, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Well, the sheets\nwere mangled. And there is such a thing and I know the machine. I could even describe\nit. But anyhow, we had a very good life, until the late 30\u2019s. We had a wonderful life, as\nyou -- P\u2019ll show you some pictures in my albums. My mother has arthri -- had arthritis, so\nshe went for a cure to a place called Busco -- Busco\u2019s druey, which had sulfur baths and\nshe went regularly, ev -- every summer for six weeks. And after that, of course, we used\nto come -- she used to come back and we used to go so-called country, somewhere in the\n-- on the farm to -- to recover. But sh -- this was a strenuous kind of treatment and she\nused to take us with her to Busco. Not all three at one time, but two, sometimes one and I\nremember -- I have even a picture from Busco with my mother and my sister has a\npicture from Busco that -- mother did that in the summertime, but other than that she was\nvery involved with the Zionist movement in Poland. And she was instrumental in ope --\nin opening a Hebrew school called Tarbud, which was specifically designed for children\nlike ourselves, who came from secular homes, where Polish was spoken, for them to have\nthe Jewish identity. We used to go after regular school. After the Polish -- regular Polish\nschool, we used to go to Tarbud, it was called Tarbud. And Tarbud, they taught us\nHebrew and they taught us Jewish history and the Bible and such. But basically, we were\ntoo young to know Hebrew well enough to study the Bible, so that was in Polish and the\nlanguage, to an extent to which a child could manage at that age. And mother was also\nvery instrumental -- first of all, she was president of Viso the women\u2019s international\nZionist organization. Whether she was president of -- of the area, or whatever the area\nencompassed, I couldn\u2019t tell. Whether it was a county, or -- or southern Poland or central\nPoland or -- I don\u2019t know, but she was president of Viso. And these wom-women Zionist\nmovements supported very much the pioneering -- the preparation of young Jews for\nPalestine. The pioneers for Palestine. And they used to be called Hag Sharah. And Hag\nSharah was the kind of a training center which was established even in Starachowice -- in\nStarachowice, Wierzbnik where these young fellows, that was mostly young men or very\nyoung women who were not married and had no children. Young people who wanted to\ngo to Palestine and be pioneers. And they were trained in farm work and in communal\nliving and all that. And the women Zionist movement, of which my mother was\npresident, not just -- didn\u2019t just support it, but was running that Hag Sharah. Father was\nalso quite involved with it, but of course he had to earn a living. But mother, this was her\nfull-time job. All this changed about 1938 because the Jewish people who owned the fac\n-- the sawmill in the town, sold it to Christians. And -- I think they were Austrian Jews, if\nI remember correctly. Anyhow, after they have given up the -- the operation -- the plant,\nevery single Jew was fired. From the top to the bottom. Whether he was an engineer or\nwhether he was whatever. Pushed the tr -- the -- the -- the barrels or collected the --\nwhatever it was. It was completely staffed by Polish Christians. And that was also the\nvery hard time, there was lots of boycotting done of Jewish stores and Jewish enterprises.\nAnd of course, studying history, I know that this didn\u2019t come of itself, 1t was germane,\nbut at the same time, the influences coming out of Germany were also very much\ninvolved in this very open -- very open antagonism. You see, they wouldn\u2019t beat you, but\nthey -- they, if you had a store, they would march around and they would say -- they\nwould march and they would yell, \u201cDon\u2019t buy from Jews,\u201d and don\u2019t buy from Jews and\nsuch. Now, my father was without a job now -- yes?",
        "Q: Be-Before we really move into that time, I would like --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: -- one more time go back to your -- to your family. Tell us a little bit more about your\nrelationship to your sisters for instance.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Were you close? Did you know your grandfathers other relatives?",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, this 1s very, yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] home life. What do you remember of -- of home?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, we had a very wonderful life. That is not just in retrospect or nostalgic\nor in any way but to describe it, we really had a wonderful childhood. The parents were,\nas I told you, very progressive minded. And we were very, very close-knit, especially\nwith my mother\u2019s side of the family, because they lived only within 20 miles or so of the\n-- or 20 kilometers, I don\u2019t know which, but very short distance from Starachowice. And\npersonally, I never knew either grandfather. My father, as I told you, came from\nSolsnoviets and that\u2019s western Poland. I never knew that grandfather, he died before I\nwas born. And I never knew my other grandfather. My mother\u2019s maiden name was\nTannenblume, so I did not know my Tannenblume grandfather and I didn\u2019t know my\nLaks grandfather. However, I knew my grandmothers very well, both of them. The --\ngrandmother Laks used to come for -- you know like you, in the old days they used to\ncome for a visit, was an extended visit, let\u2019s say for six weeks, so she lived with us. And\nthen she would go to visit her other son, Alexander, in Radom. And then she would make\nthe rounds and then she would -- she lived in Solsnoviets, but she would make these very\nlovely, extended trips. But that was the time when I saw her, but the other grandmother,\nwe called Babcha, is a grandmother for -- in Polish. The other grandmother, I really -- not\njust adored, she had great influence over me and I remember her dearly and I\u2019Il never\nforget her because of my childhood, my orientation to the importance of things. For\nexample, she was the owner of a printing shop. I never tire of talking about it because she\nwas -- she owned a printing shop with her two daughters. There were two daughters,\nunmarried daughters living with her. One of them was Regina, that\u2019s mother\u2019s sister,\nRegina Tannenblume and the other was Anja. Anja Tannenblume. Babcha was Sara\nTannenblume. Babcha was officially, so to say, the owner of the printing shop because it\nbelonged to my grandfather, but the three of them -- actually the -- th-the daughters were\nrunning it. And I would be invited -- grandmother was fond of inviting one child at a\ntime. She was religious and she was kosher and she did not think my mother was doing\nthe kind of job with the secular education, that we really needed this other something --\nthis other background. So I would go by myself on the -- it was a train, I think, or on the\nbus. And she would wait for me. You know, it was a very short ride, I mean really short.\nMy mother wouldn\u2019t trust me to somebody there thasay Babcha\u2019s going to be waiting.\nThen she did. And my total fascination with the printing shop -- I fell in love with that\nplace, totally. Not just that the man in the back, you know, that was a hand operated\nprinting machine. They allowed me to touch it and go with them. And then they would\ncut -- they would cut the material, the lets -- they used to do for movie houses, they used\nto do posters. And then they had these big cutting machine and they would cut the edges\nto be -- to be straight. Well, imagine a child -- seven, eight year old child having a bag of\nthese cuttings. I mean, you know, you co -- th-this was paradise. Then, they used to make\nledgers, you know, like ledgers for -- ledgers and they would punch these holes, they had\na punching machine. So you had the confetti. So I had another bag of confetti. I even\nremember, they used to make stickers. You know, in Poland, there was a sticker on the\nbread. You know, when you bought a loaf of bread, there was a little, as big as a postage\nstamp. I forgot why it was there, I think it named the bread, whatever. Anyhow, to punch\nthe holes for the stickers, that was another confetti, much smaller, sort of like a powder.\nAnyhow, my attachment to Babcha, of course, the grandmother Tannenblume started\nwith this fascination of the printing shop. And of course, she treated me wonderfully. She\ntook me to the park for concerts and such, which there was a big park there for that. But\nbasically she wanted me to learn the -- the prayers. So I would say the prayer before\nbreakfast and I would say the prayer before bedtime and I would say all these prayers and\nshe also was ve -- very religious and I distinctly remember she had two sinks in the room\nand a stove with a -- she had like a metal partition and she would put a metal partition\nbecause one part that was for the meat wouldn\u2019t part -- touch the other part. In other\nwords, with all her love and -- and -- and attention to me, she really got this -- this idea of\n-- th -- her idea of -- of getting something to the grandchildren that they weren\u2019t getting at\nhome, very well. She got it across very well, because I never forgot 1t and of course we\nare very much -- we\u2019re very much -- not that we feel Jewish, we are Jewish to the core.\nW -- Just never became religious in the sense that Babcha wanted me to be religious. But\nJudaism is -- 1s part -- not of the persona, but of the being, to the very core. Some of it, of\ncourse comes from -- 90 percent comes from the house, because that was the -- the\nidentity with Judaism was so very, very strong. But Babcha\u2019s identity with Judaism was\nthe other part that I didn\u2019t get. And she was very intelligent and very well educated for a\nwoman of those days. She was -- she spoke and wrote French fluently. She knew German\nvery well. She came from a very fine family. In fi -- in fact I remember her cousin had\nthe bank -- the bank in Austrovietz belonged to her cousin, they came from Sundomiesh,\na town south of Austrovietz. Babcha lived in Austrovietz, where the printing shop was,\nAustrovietz, which was very near to us. Sundomiesh was a little further south, both of\nStarachowice and Austrovietz. Old, medieval city. That\u2019s where Babcha was born and --\nand this is where the -- her extended family was. The importance here of talking about\nthe family is this, Babcha gave -- she was pr -- gave birth 13 times, but nine children\nsurvived. Nine of the 13. My mother was one of them. It was a very -- when I came on\nthe scene -- it was a very extended family because all these sons and daughters got\nmarried. Out of nine, you can probably visualize how many grandchildren there were and\nhow many -- you see? The point of it is this, that from that family, aside from the sons\nwho came to America, everybody else perished from that family. The oldest daughter --\nmy -- my mother\u2019s oldest sister, who -- her name was Kronenberg, she had two sons who\nstudied in Belgium, they were engineers. And I think they perished in the Holocaust in\nBelgium. We never found about -- out about them. Babcha and her daughters that were\nnot married yet, the two that lived -- no, one of them got married during the war, so she\nwas already married during the war, but Babcha and the two daughter thers and the son-\nin-law from Austrovietz, they went. They went to Treblinka. And -- and my other aunt,\nwho lived in Danzig with her husband -- nobody from that family survived, from my\nmother\u2019s family. Of course my parents perished. But in those days, the -- during the --\nbefore the war, Babcha came to the house very often to us. But most of it, my major\nrecollection of Babcha was that she was getting one child at a time and adoring it and\nspoiling it and teaching it to be religious. And she was a very progressive woman. I have\na picture where sh -- you could see a family picture and she\u2019s wearing -- she\u2019s wearing a\nwig. She was religious, but the combination of her religiosity and her progressiveness\nand being so well educated 1s -- is a little hard to understand for a woman who must have\n-- I don\u2019t know how old she was. Well, she was born in the 19th century for sure. She\nwas a 19th century woman. So I -- all these aunts and the cousins, I just absolutely\nadored. Now, nobody from that family survived. And one of my mother\u2019s sisters, the\nyoungest one, who was also single, became a pharmacist. She studied pharmacy before\nthe war and her first job was in 1939, in the summer. And she went to a place called\nWamsha, which is northeast Poland, around Biawastock -- around there. We never found\nout what happened to her. You know, we know what happened to the others because\npeople from Austrovietz who survived, told us what happened to the people from\nAustrovietz. Like I could tell you what peop -- what happened to people from\nStarachowice who didn\u2019t survive. They went to Treblinka. Austrovietz was the same.\nPeople -- some people who survive who knew when Babcha went and Regina and all the\naunts. This youngest sister of my mother\u2019s, whose name was Roosia, we never found out\n-- of course Wamsha was decimated as badly as any other city, as far as the Jewish\npopulation, so -- but we never -- I\u2019m saying it for the reason that as much as we know\nwho perished where, we have no idea where this one aunt perished. Now Babcha the\nother one, Babcha Laks, from Solsnoviets, she perished together with her family there.\nShe had two daughters who were married and had children. The only person that\nsurvived from Babcha -- who lived with Babcha, was one of her granddaughters,\nAnnjapatashnik, she lives in Israel. We see her and we keep in touch. Other than that, her\nson Alexander, who was my unc -- my brother -- my father\u2019s brother, Alexander Laks,\nwith his family, they survived. So from the Tannenblume side, nobody survived except\nthe three of us, the three sisters. From the Laks side of the family, only Uncle Alexander\nwith his wife and the two sons who were in Russia and Anja, my cousin Anja. And we\u2019re\ntalking about, if you add the numbers of these two families, it\u2019s an unbelievable number,\nlike 200 people or maybe even more. You see, so tho -- this 1s the immediate family, not\ncounting other cousins, you know, that were distant cousins and -- and my mother\u2019s\ncousins and such. We\u2019re just talking about the immediate family. Grandparents and\nuncles and aunts and cousins. And everybody perished, except as I told you, for the three\nof us. The three sisters, Uncle Alexander with his wife and the two sons. Of course they\ndidn\u2019t go through the Holocaust. Uncle and aunt did, the sons went to Russia and they\ncame out of Russia with unders army, with the Polish army.",
        "Q: We will talk about Uncle Alexander and --",
        "A: Later, right.",
        "Q: Maybe you could just give us a little clearer understanding of the relationship between\nthe three of us.",
        "A: The three of us, right. Well --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] your sist -- your two sisters and you.",
        "A: All right. We were very close. First of all, as I told you, we all went to Polish schools.\nWhen the time came for my oldest sister to go to high school, she was always very\nbrilliant, she was the brain of the family, the genius. And to this day, we -- we -- we treat\nher that way. She was not to be bothered with daily things. When she came in and she\nhad to be served and she -- because she was a genius. Anyhow, she went -- she took a test\nin Radom. Radom is a town not far from us, where they had a -- a special high school\ngimnasium where Jews were not allowed, except the very smart Jews. It was a school and\n-- what was the name of that high school? I forgot, it probably come to me. Anyhow, she\nwent to -- from Starachowice, with my mother, she took the test and then you had to go\nand find your name, she made it. There were 500 girls in that school and there were five\nJewish girls. She was one of them and she was from out of town. So now it gives you an\nidea how bright she was and how -- how really sharp she was to be edout. So she -- she\nlived in Radom, before -- right before the war. She lived in Radom, went to gimnasium in\nRadom, had her Radom friends there. And she -- the tutoring, she was supplementing her\nincome always with tutoring. She was tutoring French and she was tutoring Latin. And\nthis 1s very important for my later part of the story. Because she was a tutor to others and\nshe always kept all these books and she was just -- she was the oldest and she had the\nmost academic knowledge. That came in very handy later on during the war. But now\nwe\u2019 re talking about before the war. So she lived in Radom and came home for vacations.\nShe was not to be bothered. My father knew nothing in the kitchen, he couldn\u2019t even set\nhimself a ca -- top -- glass of tea, as they called it, glass of tea. When sh -- when Hanya\ncame home, father served her a gl -- a cu -- a glass of tea, because you could not bother\ngeniuses with things like that, you see. Now Krisha, the sen -- the -- the middle child,\nLehrman, Krislerman -- she was always very beautiful. She was an exceptional beauty.\nAnd I\u2019m not just saying she was pretty. She was a striking beauty. She still is, but in\nthose days she really was a strikingly beautiful child. And she -- also she went to Polish\nschools, yes, I think I mentioned it, that Hanya first went to elementary school which was\nPolish. Th-This is the town school. And then she went to Radom to the gimnasium.\nKrisha also started the gimnasium in Starachowice. Mother\u2019s only problem about Krisha\nwas, that because she\u2019s so beautiful, she will not be as smart as my other dau -- sister. So\nif they would pass in the street and somebody said, \u201cOh, she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\u2019 So my\nmother said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d People were always reprimanded to remark that\nshe was -- my mother used to say, \u201cShe will never grow up to be anything, because\neverybody\u2019s going to tell her she\u2019s so beautiful and --\u201d, but she was. \u201cShe will think life\nis just nothing, I mean, she don\u2019t have to make the effort.\u201d But of course she was very,\nvery smart and very practical. Krisha was always very practical. Hanya, the oldest one,\nwas always on another, you know, somewhere else in the -- in -- in -- in the clouds, head\nin the clouds. But Krisha was down to earth, she was smart, she was industrious, as of\ncourse life proved later on. In true life, she was the smartest, you know. And she did in\nschool, she --very well. She did very, very good school work. And of course, then I was\nat th-th-th-the tail end, of course. I -- I wasn\u2019t what you call a ver -- I was sort of an ugly\nduckling type of kid, you know. I didn\u2019t eat much, but I -- I was sort of very curious\nabout things, you know I -- they used to call me th-the -- the -- the information agency,\nbecause I used to go out and find this happen and you know this. There was a band\nplaying fair and this -- I always was very curious about everything. I was extremely\ncurious and I was very good in school. That is the one thing that -- from the minute I hit\nschool, that was my life and I really had all th-th-the -- five was the -- the -- the -- like an\nA, you know, in America it\u2019s A, B you get in col -- in school. Well, I had fives, always\nfives, everything was five. And mother used to say the same thing, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk in\nthe front of the child about that she\u2019s so good in school. Doesn\u2019t mean anything. She\u2019s\ngoing to get an idea, she\u2019s --\u201d, this was the whole. And you know, the upbringing in those\ndays -- yo-you -- you should never praise your child for being smart. Today, I say to my\ngrandson, \u201cOh, I think you\u2019re the smartest child in the world.\u201d I always tell -- say to him,\nI say, \u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re so smart.\u201d Which he is. He\u2019s very intelligent. Max is\nnow nine years old. And I keep telling him, I say, \u201cI think you\u2019re wonderful. I think\nyou\u2019re so smart.\u201d My parents always told us we\u2019re wonderful and everything, but every\nattribute that was outstanding was not to be praised. Like Krisha\u2019s beauty was taboo, you\nshouldn\u2019t say it in front of her because she\u2019s not going to grow up to be anything. You\nshould not -- Hanya you shouldn\u2019t touch because she is -- she\u2019s a genius, so she can\u2019t --\nand as far as Renia\u2019s concerned --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number one, side B. And so you were just talking --",
        "A: Yes, no, I was just saying that -- that -- as -- as a -- as a -- what you call a child who\ndid well in school, I wasn\u2019t supposed to be praised too much because that would get in\nmy head. But anyhow, we did have a very fine life, because as I already said, we had\ngrandmothers visiting with us. We had a grand -- where we\u2019re going to visit with the\ngrandparents. We went to Busco every summer. Then we went on -- as I said, on a farm\nsomewhere for a week or two because mother needed to recover from the treatment. We\nwent to Hebrew school in the afternoon after school and we also participated in the Polish\n-- in life of the Polish community. There were parades -- third of May, you know, is a\nnational holiday like July fourth, this day of -- Constitution day. Or 11th of November,\nwhich is Armistice Day here, but over there it was Poland was liberated 1918, on the\n11th. That was the end of the first war, that was a big holiday in Poland. So we would go\nand there were all kinds of things in school going on where you know, had the little -- the\n-- the speeches in the school and -- and speeches outside and we would recite poetry and\nthen everybody would go -- you know, to -- to -- even to the church for whatever called -\n- some kind of a celebration. And we would go in. We wouldn\u2019t -- you know, we\nwouldn\u2019t pray or anything, but we went into the church just like anybody else. And --",
        "Q: So what was your relationship to your -- to your Polish neighbors?",
        "A: Very fr-friendly. Very. We were part of the Polish neighbor -- of the Polish\ncommunity, but we were part of the Jewish community. It\u2019s just that we did not live the\nsame type of life as the Hasidim did, you see. Because as I said, we went to Polish\nschools and that made all the difference. Be -- we spoke Polish at home. That made all\nthe difference, you see? And the fact was that my parents were better educated and -- and\nmore, I use a vernacular -- plugged in to the bigger world. You see, the Hasidic world\nwas very insular. It isn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t -- they hated the Poles or they loved the Poles, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter. They lived their own lives. They were parallel to the lives of the Polish\ncommunity, but they didn\u2019t mingle, you know. We were being invited for Christmas\ncelebrations to other people\u2019s -- the Christian homes. Our -- my mother\u2019s dear, dear\nfriends came for Passover Seder sometimes, for Jewish holidays, for whatever. To eat the\nJewish foods, however it was. So ours was a sort of part of the overall community,\nwhereas the Hasidim lived their own life, very much along the -- the religious lines. And\nthey were not plugged in to the larger community and this was true throughout Poland.\nStarachowice was not in any way different, you see, from the prevailing -- not conditions,\nthe -- the -- the prevailing living standards, you know? This was one community that sw -\n- we were sort of in between.",
        "Q: How did you become aware of the -- or did you become aware of the rising power of\nthe Nazis? Since your parents were plugged in to the larger world --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How did it filter into the house?",
        "A: Yes. This is the one thing about which I know nothing. As I told you, my parents\nwouldn\u2019t allow us to be praised for -- they always wanted to protect us along the lines\nthat they thought were proper -- not proper, but important to bring up children. I\npersonally am the youngest -- that I knew nothing about anything. I didn\u2019t know about --\nI knew that there was Nazi movement -- that there was some bad men in -- in Germany,\nbut that the German Jews were being sent out of Germany, but this was -- this was far,\nGermany was God knows where and -- and it had nothing to do with me personally. My\nparents never spoke about it. As a matter of fact, in later years, way later, when we were\nalready in -- in the ghetto, they never told us anything. And I am quite sure they knew a\nlot. So, to this day, I question. Did they know and didn\u2019t tell us or didn -- maybe they\ndidn\u2019t know. But it\u2019s not possible that people like this wouldn\u2019t know. And when I reflect\non my background, how we were always so protected. You know, you shouldn\u2019t tal --\nyou shouldn\u2019t tell her she\u2019s smart and you shouldn\u2019t tell her she\u2019s beautiful, you know,\nbecause it\u2019s not go1 -- well, why should you tell children those horrible things, if they\nwere true? Maybe people didn\u2019t believe yet -- that what was happening was true. So\ncoming back to pre-war and the Nazi rise to power and how it affected my life, maybe it\nemboldened the Poles to open boycott, because I do remember distinctly -- to this day we\nhave an anecdote, the family anecdote. My father was coming home and there was a\nstore, a Jewish store in -- in -- up front on -- in the street level where we lived, we lived in\nthe back. And he came and there was this whole group of Poles walking around and\nsaying, \u201cBeat the Jew, beat the Jew, beat the Jew.\u201d They were walking -- picketing that\nstore and my father came up on it and one of the men was a very good friend. And when\nmy father passed by, he said, \u201cBeat the Jew, economically.\u201d So to this day when th-the\nissue of Polish anti-Semitism 1s descri -- dis -- discussed, I say I do remember when my\nfather came home laughing, he said, \u201cIn the last minute when he saw me, he says, \u201cBe jer\nda economeetchnia.\u201d He kept saying, \u201cBe jer da, be jer da,\u201d he saw me and he said, \u201cBe\njer da economeetchnia.\u201d\u201d You see? And this was open. Now there were other things that\nwent on prior to that, that were maybe a little more subtle, a little more hidden. But when\nI -- Iremembered the boycotts, only because my father is relating that incident. The last\nminute -- he says be jer da, he stops, economeetchnia. He saw my father passing by. You\nsee? And that was a true economic boycott, which really didn\u2019t get anywhere, in the\nsense that the -- the Jews were very good traders and they good stuff and -- and the Poles\nstill shop, so they shop sort of quietly, through the back door or whatever. But -- Jewish\npopulation was being squeezed, no question about that, you know, no question about it.\nIn the -- just before the war, they were getting the -- squeezed constantly, worse and\nworse. That\u2019s before the Germans.",
        "Q: When -- when were you yourself, personally more aware of -- that something was\nchanging? How did it manifest itself? There was the anecdote from your father, but did\nyou see something, did you hear something yourself?",
        "A: Well, I really have one recollection and that was around Passover. What year that was,\nI don\u2019t know. Could have been \u201838 or maybe \u201839. A new family moved in -- into the\nneighborhood and there was this little girl, Kiya. A very lovely, blonde, little girl. And\nshe was placed in the same grade as I was, so we became instant friends. She was my\nfriend, not the other -- not Krisha\u2019s and not Hanya\u2019s friend. And then was Passover --\nPassover rolled around, could have been right before the war and I told her to come in --\nno, she used to come all the time to play with me, we did homework together, you know,\nwe read poetry, such. And I told her to come and -- to come to the house. And she says\nno, now she won\u2019t come. I said, \u201cHow come?\u201d She says no, she is not going to come for\na little while, like a week or two. And I said, \u201cWhy 1s that?\u201d She says because it\u2019s\nPassover and the Jews grab children for -- that they take blood from the children for\nmatzahs. That was my first shock. I did not hear it from the children, my -- from the\ntown, but I did hear it from that child. And she never came during Passover. And then I\nthink eventually the war came. So it had to be 1939, you know, in the spring, yeah, I\u2019m\nsure that\u2019s how it was. And she says no, she wouldn\u2019t come and she didn\u2019t come. And I\nthink my mother said sh -- that I don\u2019t need such friends anyhow. So, whatever it was,\nthat was the end of the relationship. I think the war just came, then the summer came\naround and then summers we went -- you know with we\u2019re here and we were there, we\nwent to Babcha. By the time September came, I never went to school again. You know,\n1939, the war broke out the first of September, so -- she was in my class so that was --\nthat was the end of the relationship. So that was one that I never, never forgot. And\nanother one was in school, it happened to me and I -- I always look back on it and think\nto myself, what motivated this man to say that? I had a new teacher and he -- was first\nday of school and again, could have been 1938 -- yes it had to be 1938 because I didn\u2019t\ngo to school any more in \u201839. And he says, \u201cCould every child please stand up and say\nhis name?\u201d So everybody got up and then I got up and I said, \u201cRegina Laks.\u201d So he --\nand I sat down and so he tells me to get up, he says, \u201cNo, your name is not Regina. You\nare Jewish, right?\u201d I say, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYour name is not Regina.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, it is. I can\nprove it, I can show it. I mean I -- Iam surely Regina.\u201d \u201cNo, you go back to your mother\nand tell her that your name is Rifka.\u201d And I went home and I cried and my mother said\nnot to bother about it, because we can prove that my name is Regina. It\u2019s on the papers,\nit\u2019s on my birth certificate and if he doesn\u2019t like it, that\u2019s how he doesn\u2019t like it, but my\nname is not Rifka.",
        "Q: When he said that, what did it mean to you? Did -- how did you interpret that?",
        "A: I interpreted by the fact that he did not like Jews. He absolutely had it in him to -- to --\nto belittle me. I mean, you know how it is in front of a class, to be -- I mean you are a\nseven, eight or nine year old child and somebody says something like this to you in front\nof the class. And of course you know they -- the -- 1n the -- in the child is exposed to all\nkinds of other antagonisms and not necessarily out of anti-Semitism. When I was a kid,\nth-th-th-the Christian boys used to beat up the Jewish girls. But that isn\u2019t what you call\nanti-Semitism in the true sense. This is just, well they\u2019re Jews, we don\u2019t have to bother\nwith them and you can beat them up. So, however it was, I was afraid as a girl, of these\nChristian boys, but some of them were friendly and others us-used to beat us up coming\nfrom school, so we used to go home in a group. But this was very specific, this calling me\nout in the class, very specific and even as a child, I could feel that he wanted to belittle\nme, that he wanted -- one way or another to belittle me in front of the class. You see?\nBecause when I was beaten up by a Christian boy, that was just part of the way things\nwere. You know, you beat up -- the boys were rambunctious and well anyway. But this\nwas different. So that incident -- that I never forgot. Never, never, never. Like my\nfather\u2019s anecdote about Be jer da economeetchnia, I didn\u2019t forget that and I didn\u2019t forget\nthe fact that -- that my name is not Regina, but Rifka, which of course wasn\u2019t the case. So\nth-this -- to answer your question, this was about the extent of my awareness. You see --\nthe extent of my personal awareness of things around me. As far as the larger picture, I\ndon\u2019t know what my parents knew. My father had to know. I'll tell you why. There was\nan -- a magazine or something called, Ost une vest. Something like that. There we -- he\nused to -- he used to subscribe to -- used to come. I don\u2019t know where it came from,\nwhether it came from Salesia or from Germany, but he used to subscribe to that. That had\nto have something in it that would give them an idea what\u2019s going on. But I -- I really\ndon\u2019t know. I only knew that as far as the preparation of the -- the young pioneers for\nIsrael, did not have to do with anti-Semitism, you see, because that was strictly\nestablishing a Jewish homeland type of thing, with no connection. That\u2019s the way I\nunderstood it, with no connection to other things that were going on. That was a program\nand there was a whole thing of collecting money and doing this and the other thing and\ntraining and shipping and there were kinds of Jewish leaders who used to come to our\nhometown and give speeches and so on. But that had nothing to do with the official\nrecognition or condemnation or -- or anything. Anti-Semitism as such, no. That was\nanother aspect of -- of Jewish life in Poland. In the 30\u2019s, as I understand it now, a lot of\nyoung Jews, pioneers, went to Europe -- to Palestine, settled there. You know, I\ntranslated Kolchuk, Yanoush Kolchuk and I did a lot of work on him -- about him. He --\nhis children -- so-called children, who got to be 16 and -- and -- and left the orphanage,\nresettled in Palestine as did his own assistant, Vincheeska, Stefania Vincheeska. And\nKolchuk was -- absolutely begged -- begged to come to Palestine. He went to Palestine in\n1936. I mean, I know it now from history and from the research and the translations that I\ndo. He went to Israel. It was not for him. He was an older man. He was totally -- he was a\nwriter. He could not fit into a framework of another language. And he came back. And he\nwas -- he was dismissed from the Polish radio in 1938. You know, he was the -- the -- the\nfamous old doctor who gave advice, like Dr. Spock here, gave advice on child rearing to\neverybody. He was removed from the Polish radio in 1938, yet he didn\u2019t go back to\nPalestine, you see? And in my -- I used to hear Kolchuk read children\u2019s stories -- you\nknow, I used to -- in school we had the books, Kolchuk\u2019s. Maybe not in school, at home.\nBut the point is that -- coming back to how aware was I. I was aware in my small, little\nworld, but absolutely not in connection to anything on a larger scale. And my sister in\nRadom, Hanya, who was in the Polish gimnasium -- I don\u2019t know that she suffered much\nanti-Semitism, for the reason -- or maybe she did -- for the reason that she was so smart,\nyou see? So you -- you couldn\u2019t attack somebody who was just top -- tops -- tops, you\nsee?",
        "Q: But -- but then the war broke out.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And living conditions changed somehow [indecipherable |",
        "A: Very. Yes. The -- it\u2019s very important to say -- again you see how the factory -- the\nplant, the -- how that fits into the -- into the progression. In -- on how much my life is\ntied up with it, even though I really, frankly, I mean I had no connection to it, but how --\nwhat a big part of my life that factory was. And it wasn\u2019t -- and it wasn\u2019t part of my life,\nbut how it influenced my life. When the war broke out and there were -- the bombings\nstarted and they -- they started digging dren -- trenches, you know, for anti-aircraft, my\nfather became the captain, you know, they -- like they designated. We lived on the street -\n- the main street, it was called Putsaskago -- connected Wierzbnik and Starachowice. It\nwas the nicest street. Less commercial -- least commercial. Not where the -- all the stores\nand so on. My father was designated the captain, you know, for the anti-aircraft. And --\nso the factory was in Starachowice. The Wierzbnik town was on the other side and the --\nin between was the s -- the street Putsaskago that connected. So my father came, he --\nthere was a briefing, he was called in to the headquarters there, whatever it was. And my\nfather came and said, \u201cThe town is being evacuated, everybody has to get out.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the factory is going to be blown to pieces. Just like in the first war.\u201d The first\nthing they attacked was the factory -- the factories that produced metal things and such.\nSo, immediately we all go out and we -- we -- there were forest not far from us and the\nwhole town was evacuated. The closer we got to the forest, the more there were people\nwith cows, you know, the farmers and the -- the Jews and the religious Jews and the non-\nrel -- and the Christians and the farmers and the cows and the dogs and everybody going\ninto -- into the forest because this -- the factory 1s going to be blown up and this town 1s\ngoing to be blown away, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be, right? Because you learned from\nexperience, that\u2019s what happened, okay. We got caught in the crossfire of the worst kind.\nBecause we were in a valley and on the two hills -- one was the German artillery and the\nother was the Polish. They were shooting at each other, we were in the middle and the\nGerman planes would come down with reflectors at night and shoot with machine guns at\nthe people on the ground. Anyhow, then a few days later, after this horrend -- there was\none horrendous night during -- where we were caught in the crossfire -- that there was -- I\nthought nobody would come out. This was my first thing, I didn\u2019t yet know who was\nwho and who was Germans and who wasn\u2019t, I just couldn\u2019t imagine what people look\nlike, to do -- to do things like this. Anyhow, then it got quiet and everybody said, \u201cNow\nwe're going back.\u201d\u2019 We went back. The factory was not even touched. There wasn\u2019t a b --\none bomb fell somewhere in town, but nothing was damaged. Nothing was damaged. The\nfactory was immediately -- they must have had spies in there or something. The factory,\nwithin one week was operational for war production. Okay? So now, we all came back\nand we started seeing Germans in the street. And they all -- they all started -- we came\nback to our own apartment and everybody came back. Our apartment wasn\u2019t damaged. In\nfact, I remember we were eating quickly and we left the dishes and everything and by the\ntime we came back three or four days later, there are flies around it and everything,\nbecause was so hot. Was a tremendously, terribly hot September, you know, when the\nwar broke out. However, we dragged ourselves back and the town was not damaged. The\nfactory was not touched and the Germans were marking -- marching in formation and\nsinging. They were always singing, marching in the street. They wore boots -- high\nleather boots and they were marching and -- and my parents, you know, my father, being\na German himself, you know, he -- he wasn\u2019t German, but you -- as I explained, he spoke\nGerman and he identified with German culture. He thought th-th-that\u2019s nothing, you\nknow, nothing. Well, before we knew it, they started coming around with dogs and\ncatching people in the street -- the Germans, and they caught my father, my father was\npassing and he went and he wasn\u2019t coming back for hours. My mother got very -- my\nmother got very worried. They kept them somewhere cleaning something. So she went --\nsomebody said, \u201cOh, they took all these Jews, they took them to the railroad station to\nclean up.\u201d So my mother went over to the railroad station, there was this German guard.\nAnd she said to hi -- she spoke German too, she said to the German soldier, she said,\n\u201cVasin th-the herren.\u201d And he said, \u201cThese -- these aren\u2019t herren. These are the yuden.\u201d\nAnd he kicked her. And this was maybe second day after they arrived. Th-That was --\nnothing happened yet. This was already -- they took -- they made them clean with\ntoothbrushes, you know, they made the Jews with the beards, they had to clean st-steps\nwith beards and -- the most -- and this -- and -- and nothing was yet happening on a\nlarger scale, only those small things. Then they started coming around the how -- homes.\nThey would come with a big dog. I told you my father had an encyclopedia that was --\nnow I know it was very valuable, because it was leather bound, with gold lettering. I\nmean, I say it\u2019s very valuable in terms of antique possessions, but in those day, this was\nmy life, because it was all handpainted, like butterflies and birds was all handpaint. When\nI used to read -- not read, I couldn\u2019t read German, but I used to look at the pictures, I had\nto wash my hands. I had to have -- my father expec -- inspected my hands to see that I\ndidn\u2019t leave a stain. The most beautiful butterfly pictures, the most beautiful bird\npictures, flowers, it was all handpainted. Was very valuable encyclopedia. Well, the first\nthing, I don\u2019t know, maybe three days after the war started, very early. As I said, before\nanything bigger was happening, they came into the house and the German looked at that\nencyclopedia. My father had it in a, you know, like a breakfront with glass doors, th --\nbecause they were under a key. God forbid, you couldn\u2019t touch the stuff, you know, it\nwas sacred. So it was always under lock and key. He said to open this. He opened, then\nhe kicked my father, he said to give him boxes. They didn\u2019t have boxes, I don\u2019t know\nhow they came back with boxes. They load it in the boxes and they took it away. That\nwas the first insult. Between the fir -- time that my father was taken to clean the station,\nwhere he wasn\u2019t herren, he was just a yuden and this act of vandalism that hit to the core.\nOf course later on, when -- with the gas chambers, who would even know that person\nwould take such an insult so personally? This taking away of the encyclopedia was such\na blow to the family, to him. Was no questions asked, you know. They burst in, \u201cWhere\u2019s\nthe key?\u201d Put it out and they took it. And they went around looking for something, they\nwould take a bayonet and s -- and shove it in the car -- 1n the -- in the couch or\nsomething. Just for the fun of it. Those were personal insults for which nobody was yet\nprepared. They were terrific blows. And we\u2019re talking -- in retrospect, you\u2019re talking\nabout nothing. If you consider Auschwitz and all the other things, for heaven\u2019s sake. And\n-- and the Holocaust and the genocide and here I\u2019m talking -- but at that time, even I as a\nchild felt that insult when my mother came and cried because he -- th-that man, that\nsoldier said these were not men, they -- gentlemen, they herren, you know. He -- these\nwere just Jews. That was the one insult and then the encyclopedia was the other insult.\nAnd who even know -- knew that this was -- on the scale of things, it was nothing. You\nknow, but this was a tremendously sh -- a shake-up of the -- this was the first blow. Very\nsevere first blow. Anybody who would listen to me now, talking about the Holocaust,\nwould say, what nonsense is that? This is how it was, you see? Right away we were --\nthere was no food, they wouldn\u2019t allow us to buy food, we had to -- oh, no -- I -- Iam\nreally yet getting ahead of myself, because this is right after we came back. And very\nsoon -- this was a daily occurrence, that the Gestapo would come around with dogs, so\nyou couldn\u2019t be outside, you couldn\u2019t go -- you couldn\u2019t because if th -- you were of age,\nlike my father, they would take you to labor somewhere or just to -- to maltreat you. And\nif you were a child, they would sic the dog on you or something. So immediately we had\nto be very, very aware of -- of -- they were very brutal, that was Gestapo. And there was\nespecially one man -- what was his -- Altov I think was his name. I think it was Altov. He\ncame around with the dogs and the children were petrified. Anyhow, my parents found a\nway to have us stay home. Now, you understand, this is now September, we\u2019re not\nallowed to go to school, because this Polish school, you\u2019re not allowed -- it was very\nhard. We used to swim in the river -- was a river there, Kamiena -- can\u2019t swim in the\nriver, can\u2019t go outside because God only knows. At least if you\u2019re around the house, you\ncan run in when he comes around with the dog. So what happened was that my sister\ndecided -- Hanya the genius, she had all the books, she was a tutor anyhow, she said\nshe\u2019s going to teach us at home, that will keep us busy. So she opened a little school. I\nwas in her -- in one class with my friends, there were four of us. She was a very strict\ntaskmaster. We had French, we had Latin. I didn\u2019t even finish elementary school and we\nstarted on a much higher level, because first we finished the books that were home and\nthen she proceeded -- that\u2019s, by the way, through the ghetto -- what I\u2019m starting telling\nyou now is still as the war broke out and we\u2019re facing the new reality. So this 1s how to\nkeep the children out of trouble with -- I studied with my sister and whatever it was --\nwas a regular class and very strict and there was homework. And she always kept telling\nme that I -- she expects from me more than from the others, because she knows I can do\nit. And I was very resentful because I had to really -- I mean she lived in the same house\nand she saw that I had to do the homework. Little did I know that my basic education\nreally came -- that was th-the -- the -- the building stone of my f -- later, you know,\nhigher education. But anyhow, so life became very hard. First of all, we were now very\nimpoverished in the sense that we had -- we started selling things, you see. Whatever you\ncould sell, there wa -- first of all, my father did not have a job and we started selling\nthings to suppor -- to su -- not we, I mean I -- you know, I -- I had very little to do with\nthat. I was 10 years old. I -- you know, I wasn\u2019t much, but I\u2019m just telling you how things\nwere. Mother was an excellent cook, so she started doing things like baking cookies with\nwhite beets, sugar beets, which she never did before, she learned that, she -- she cooked\nth -- she put together whatever was possible, but life was basically now -- after the first\ntrauma of the -- of the -- of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the encyclopedia and th-this --\nthe little things, so called. What -- what set in was hunger and fear, you see. It was so --\neverything was permeated with fear. If father had to go somewhere, even to exchange\nsomething or sell something. To -- to -- to -- to dispose of some possessions, silver or\ncrystals or whatever. You never knew if he was coming back. If -- if mother had to go\nbuy some food somewhere, you never -- the fear was a gripping kind of fear. This is why\nthe children, we were at home, just locked in -- no-not like prisoners, because life was\nwonderful and you read books, you -- I read Tolstoy. I mean, I was 10 years old, I was\nreading Tolstoy. Not that I -- I probably understood some, but I read War and Peace\nwhen I was 10 years old. Because all the books were, you know, whatever was home, I\nread it. Was 1n Polish, obviously. The thing 1s that the fear was probably the most\ncrippling until we got -- we didn\u2019t get used to it -- until we learned how to call -- to -- to\nfit 1t into -- into th-the-the -- the life, you see. Of course I don\u2019t have to tell you, they\nwere -- they were shooting people right and left. Then they started -- the factory was\nalready going, still Christians only. They started picking Jews -- able, you know, able\nJews, send them in the factory and very soon it became apparent that they have some\nplan. Now, nobody knew what plan, but people said, \u201cIf you can have a job, you\u2019ll be\nsafe.\u201d Safe from what, we didn\u2019t know. We were thrown out of that apartment, the street\nwas cleared of Jews, because that was the main street. Probably in 1940, early in 1940.\nSo we lived a few more months in the apartment, but we were already very poor and --\nanyhow, then we got moved further into Wierzbnik, you see, I told you we were between\nStarachowice and Wierzbnik on the main thi -- on the main street. We got pushed into\nWierzbnik. There was no ghetto or anything like that yet. It\u2019s just that this was the\nnumber one street to be cleared of Jews. And the Jews lived wherever, but they lived\nfurther down. And by which time my parents had to sell some pieces because I\u2019Il -- the\napartment we moved in wasn\u2019t the same size, so that was, in a way, better that they -- you\nknow, they could get some money and we could live on that. And as the word got out that\npeople were -- able bodied men might be of use. And they started taking Jews into the\nfactory there, you see? This 1s the first time that any Jew ever worked. But by now this\nwas a munitions plant. They were producing shells -- cannon shells. You see, they\ndiscontinued -- I understand you can convert such plants. They discontinued all that pre-\nwar, consumer kind of goods into warm -- war production. And of course there was a\nJewish council set up. My father was not part of 1t. We were not part of any -- anything\nlike that. Not that this was bad, good or in between, my father just wasn\u2019t. He was\nbasically a guy who -- who -- he was not a merchant and he, you know, he -- he was not\nrich by then, because by 1938, we really, I mean we lived such fantastic lives and then\neverything started changing when he was booted out of the job. Anyhow, during that\nperiod, from the time that we were eli-eliminated -- expelled from that main street, until\nsuch time as they formed -- the Germans -- the Nazis formed a specific area for a ghetto,\nwe changed apartments three times. Every time we got into this apartment, then this was\noff-limits. So then we were in another apartment and that was off-limits. And finally --\nthere was never -- this is a very important distinction to make. In Starachowice -- by the\nway, the -- the ghetto was in Wierzbnik, you see. In Wierzbnik or Starachowice -- I\nshould really refer to 1t as Starachowice, there was never a ghetto like a Warsaw ghetto or\nlike a Lodz ghetto with a -- with -- with a gate -- with the fences, no. The Jews were\nbeing cleared constantly, from this area -- as I told you, we had to go three times from\none apartment to the next, to the next. From this area here and then from this area, until\nthey picked an area where the Jews could live, but no other area. In other w -- we\ncouldn\u2019t live on Putsaskago any more, you see? We could only -- we now lived on the\nstreet called Yuzhetska. But the Christians, who lived there prior -- before us, also lived\nthere. You see? So I remembered there was in Starachowice, Wierzbnik had this -- two\ncemeteries, the old cemetery and the new cemetery. After -- past the old cemetery was a\nlittle house -- a teamster, a man with a horse and -- and -- he -- he had a wagon and a\nhorse, he was a teamster, had a little house with two room -- two, like two apartments,\nback to back. So he rented this one apartment to us, was a kitchen with a big room. And\nthey lived in the similar -- in this -- this, and he was Christian. This is our last -- this was\nour last apartment. And it was within the confines of the ghetto, but the ghetto was not\nseparated or segregated. People went from the ghetto to work in the factory and back.\nFrom the work and back. At that time, as I was telling you, my sister was my best\nteacher. Not my best -- we were continuing. As we moved, we were continuing, cause the\nkids that were studying with me, were also --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] still for one minute while we change the tape.",
        "A: Yes. Okay. Good time for me --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number two, side A. And you can take up where you --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I do remember that when we dropped off -- that when the tape ended, that I\ndid want to specify the dates, to more or less put 1t within a framework. The first phase of\nthe occupation was the time when we lived on the main street, I -- up to the point at\nwhich we were thrown out of there. Meaning September 30, 1939 is the war started. By\nearly 1940, it -- we were cleared -- we were thrown out of the -- our own apartment.\nWhile we lived in that -- at that -- that stretch of time during the war, as I was saying\nbefore, we -- children, of course had to watch out because of the dogs and the Nazis and\nsuch, we were terrified of them. I think I spend at least 10 hours a day studying.\nAbsolutely didn\u2019t go anywhere. And when we were rees -- when we resettled, within the\nconfines of an area, which was designated as a future ghetto, we had three more\napartments before we ended up 1n the last one, which was our last home in Starachowice,\nbefore the alseelung, before the town was cleared of the Jews. What I meant to say is that\nthat entire period -- that entire ghetto period, no matter where we lived, in the stretch of\nthese resettlements, the object was to keep the children ins -- indoors. We were kept -- I\nwas kept indoors. My sisters were kept indoors because they were my teachers. The\noldest one, Hanya was -- was conducting the class and so on. That lasted up to the minute\nwhen the town was cleared of Jews, no matter where we lived. Life was still -- my\nparents tried to keep it very -- as -- as normal as possible, which was totally impossible to\n-- to live a normal life. But to protect us the best way they could. To have us continue\nstudying and -- and reading and -- and feeling that there is this other world, with which\nwe don\u2019t have for the time being, but eventually we\u2019ll still have it, type of attitude. I also\nmentioned in the previous tape that some people decided that they would sign up for the\nwork in the factory, because the word got around that this might be a good thing to do.\nMy two sisters, very late -- I don\u2019t know whether it was -- could have been early 1942 or\nlate in 1941, signed up -- they went and were signed up and they were -- they were sent\nto a brick factory, also in our hometown, not in the major -- the munitions factory. So\nthey went to -- there were three shifts and I think they rotated, however it was. The point\nof it all 1s this -- that when the town was to be cleared -- when the town was cleared in\n1942, in October, my two sisters were on the night shift in that brick factory. They were\nnot released, as none of the workers were allowed to leave. They were kept back.\nWhether it was the munitions factory or the brick factory, the workers were kept back,\nbecause meanwhile there was a round-up in what has now become -- is very small area of\na ghetto, still not surrounded by wire or anything like the other ghettos that -- we know\nabout Warsaw ghetto. So that, by this time, there were only a few streets where the Jews\nwere allowed to live and those Poles, Christian Poles who still lived there, lived there, but\nother than that, there were very few Poles. We were all squeezed in, I can\u2019t tell you how\nmany people to a room, but it was crowded, 1t was crowded. Meanwhile, there were\nshipments coming in from Lodz -- from the Lodz ghetto, people were shipped in and\nfrom other areas and -- and we were all being crowded in and crowded in until the day of\nOctober 27, 1942. As I said, my sisters were in the mun -- in the brick factory and five\no\u2019clock in the morning, maybe six, I don\u2019t remember -- early in the morning, we heard\nthe knock on the door, eiler rouse and we weren\u2019t allowed to take anything, just to get\nout. And -- as fast as we could and the -- the Nazis were there with the rifles and the guns\nand the dogs and with -- they had sort of like a -- you know the type of thing that you hit\na horse with?",
        "Q: Whip.",
        "A: A whip, yes -- with the whips. And I -- I was used to the whips because whenever\nthey marched by themselves, whenever they walked the -- the streets in the town, they\nalways carried a whip. They always had guns, but they also carried whips. And we were\nordered out very quickly -- out of the house and point -- said we have to walk to the main\nsquare. Of course, we meaning -- was my father, my mother and myself, because my two\nsisters were kept back and we absolutely had no idea what was happening. I certainly\ndidn\u2019t. Maybe my parents did, but they didn\u2019t say and we didn\u2019t know what the people in\nthe factories are going to be doing. Meanwhile or later, with -- anyhow, when we came to\nthe main square -- the distance between the house and the main square was maybe about\nthree quarter miles, maybe a mile at the most. But the sights between the house and the\nmain square were the most horrendous. That was the real brutal -- naked brutality, as I\nwas forced to -- to -- to see en masse, the first time. Because, you know, I saw shooting\nhere and a shoot -- beating there and all kinds of things I did see, but I didn\u2019t see so many\nacts of brutality up to that point. We\u2019re talking now about 1942 in October. I have never\nseen such brutality with -- in the -- the numbers involved. The infants thrown against the\nwalls and -- and the old people beaten and kicked and shot as they couldn\u2019t walk, or if\nthey could walk. The whole scene, between the house, which we had to leave and the\nsquare where we had to line up, was one horrendous bloodbath. The most brutal sight I\nhave ever seen up to that point and of course, I\u2019ve seen plenty. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of\ncruelty prior to that, but nothing in such concentrated form. And we -- on the way we\npicked up -- my mother had to -- my mother didn\u2019t have to, we were walking, they were -\n- my parents were holding me by the hand and -- I was a skinny child. My mother padded\nme up with all kinds of rags, to make me look like I was developed, which I was nothing.\nShe put rougema on my cheeks, so I would look more grown. I was tall, so I could sort of\nmake myself look older if I tried. And on the way, mother noticed a friend of hers, an\nelderly lady, Miss -- Mrs. Kazimerzka, who couldn\u2019t move and so m-mother took her by\nthe -- under the arm, like and my father took me by the hand and the four of us walked\ntogether to the square. And of course when we came to the square, the acts of brutality\nhas only -- had only in-intensified, because it was a real -- like a butchery. You know, it\nwas the killing and the kicking and the -- and the -- th-this was already after the walk\ntoward the center. The center was you had to line up and not everybody knew how to line\nup and where to line up and people were frantic and people were crying and people were\npraying and the Germans wouldn\u2019t stand for any of that, they would kick and they would\nsaid, \u201cYou move fast.\u201d And then you didn\u2019t move fast, whatever it was, it was a\nterrifying scene and as we were approaching it, they pointed people to different\ndirections. There were groups all around. Well, I was pointed in one direction, my father\nwas pointed in another direction and mother, with Mrs. Kazimerzka, who -- Mother was\nholding Mrs. Kazimerzka, to another group. No-Nobody knew which group is which or\nwhich group was going where. We had no idea, by then, that there were trains already\nwaiting on -- at the siding, because as I said, we were in the ghetto, meaning we were not\nallowed outside of that area. And the railroad station was outside of that area. So very\nsoon -- it was also very hot, I remember this was very hot. My group was driven one way\nand I noticed that we were driven toward th-th-the -- toward Starachowice area, where\nthe factory was. And I found myself in the -- in a place called Shellneetsa, which\ntranslated means fir-firing range. This was at one time a firing range and now there were\nbarracks built there. I\u2019ve never heard of the place, I\u2019ve never seen the place, I had no\nidea. I knew I was still in Starachowice because it wasn\u2019t far from the -- the -- the plant,\nfrom the factory. Well, when we found ourselves there, I realized that my sisters weren\u2019t\nthere, my mother wasn\u2019t there and my father wasn\u2019t there, not the way I saw it, but later\non it turned out that he was, but I didn\u2019t know it yet, be-because he was with a group of\nmen who were lined up and brought to Shellneetsa and -- and put -- their group was\npointed to another place where I couldn\u2019t see. Anyhow, I was absolutely petrified, I was -\n- | -- I was out of my mind with fear, with total -- I always compare the feeling of fear for\nthe duration of the war and I think the fear most acute was that fear, that time when I\nfound myself alone. I was so alone and I absolutely didn\u2019t know what was going to\nhappen. And people were always very kind to me and these were people from my\nhometown, say, \u201cNo, don\u2019t cry, we\u2019re going to get together with everybody eventually\nand everything will be fine.\u201d Anyhow, I did find out father was in the same unit -- the\nsame Shellneetsa camp and what transpired -- what we found out, the extent to which I\nfound out about these things that I knew what happened. That some people -- among who\nmy mother was -- were put on trains and sent somewhere. Resettled was -- was the\neuphemism, resettled. Didn\u2019t mean anything -- but didn\u2019t know any -- I didn\u2019t know\ndirection east, west, south or north, somewhere resettled. Father was in the Shellneetsa\ncamp. He became a scribe. He always kept books and typewrite -- you know, typing and\nall this, so he did that and the two sisters, I -- we understood, were now in another camp\nthat was called Mioufka and that camp housed the people from the brick factory, because\nit was closer to the brick factory. Shellneetsa was very close to the munitions factory.\nWell, I cannot remember the dates when the -- the date when the two camps were\ncombined, but they were combined and we lived -- I met my sisters and the camp became\nmy ufecach. Shellneetsa was empty, because Shellneetsa itself, I -- I -- I never know the\nreasons why things were happening, I just know that life in Shellneetsa was dreadful,\neverybody had typhus. I worked in the laundry, in the camp laundry. I had typhus. I had\nwhat they called a mild case, because I said, they say if you are a child, you have a milder\ncase. Because my sister had typhus, the oldest one, Hanya, she was stricken by the\nseverest case of typhus. She had hallucinations, she was out of her head, she was burning\nout with fever and she was talking out of -- out of proportion to anything that -- that --\nthat would mean anything. And, you know, the -- the -- the camp guards made selections\nwhile the f -- the epidemic was going on, so you had to come out and line up and\nhowever you stood up, they could see that you are another case to be disposed of. So one\nway or another, Hanya was propped up and -- and -- and he-held up and she didn\u2019t talk\nand -- and so you couldn\u2019t see that she was out of her mind completely. I went into the\nlaundry room and there were these older ladies who took pity on me and they opened the\nbig cauldrons with the steam and I stood behind -- this -- this was not the same time as\nHanya was sick, because this was 1n -- you know, whatever the -- th-the -- the -- however\nit was one was sick. Now, three weeks later, or for whatever. But when my time came to\nhave typhus, and there was another -- course the selections were always going on. Didn\u2019t\nonly have to do with typhus, let me just finish this about the cauldron. I stood behind the\ncauldron with the steam, so that you saw me all burning up, but of course I could have\nbeen burning up from the steam from the cauldron, from the laundry and this is how I -- I\n-- I survived typhus selection. But basically, the -- the slave labor camp in my hometown\nhad selections all the time, typhus or not, because they were using these Jews, able\nbodied Jews, as long as they could. And once people got sick -- and of course there was\nno medication, there were no doctors and there was nothing. One people -- once people\ngot sick, you had to dispose of them, you see? So in Shellneetsa, they d-dug a pit in the\nforest and they shot the people over the pit. In Mioufka the same. So it really -- you\ndidn\u2019t have to have typhus to fear being eliminated. Because if you had to line up before\nthe barrack and they didn\u2019t like the way you looked, one way or another, typhus or not,\nyou could be shot there -- right there on the spot, anyhow. And they still needed an\noperational number -- number of people to do the jobs, because this was a factory that\nwas around the clock, 24 hours, with three shifts and so they were shipping in new people\nall the time. Wherever they got these people, we don\u2019t know, but they were getting these\npeople, shipping them in, to supplement those numbers that were needed for the factory\nwork. And I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned it before, but the -- probably not -- that the\nadministration of the camps was -- the highest echelon were the Germans, the SS, I think\nand the Gestapo. And everything u-under them were the Ukrainians and they wore\nGerman uniforms. The -- wasn\u2019t the same color as the German, but it was a German\nuniform with Germany insignia. Now, they were the primary overseers. They mow --\nthey manned the towers -- the watchtowers, because you know, these camps were now\nsurrounded by barbed wire. And of course you had to walk still, from the camp to the\nfactory and back. And that was three shifts a day. So they were the ones who counted the\npeople going and marched them out of the gate and marched them back. They were the\nones who were lining people up for the ind -- inside selections, which were conducted by\nthe Nazis, the German Nazis. With -- as I told you, the selections did not wait for typhus\nto -- to -- to be rampant, they just had selections, at any time of the day or night, if they\nplease like it -- if they pleased, if they felt like it. They chased you out and they -- this --\nhere and here and there and pointed you this way and before you knew it, you ended up\nin the woods being shot. So the Ukrainians were very brutal. Sometimes I felt they were\nworse than the Germans. They probably tried to prove themselves, or whichever it was,\nthey were horrendously cruel. There was cruelty be -- above and beyond the call of duty,\nyou know, the type of cruelty, the spitting, the kicking, the -- they used to use rifle butts\nto hit you over the head if you didn\u2019t line up exactly right. Anyhow --",
        "Q: Was there sexual cruelty against the women, too?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, absolutely, absolutely. We were separated from the men, you know. The\nwomen lived in women\u2019s barracks, the men in the men. But for the line up for the factory\n-- in fact, at one time, I also went to work in the factory and I don\u2019t remember how long I\nworked there. I think before the two camps combined, while I was still in Shellneetsa, I\nthink they were short or something like that. They put me up to working in the factory\nand I actually worked on one of the machinery, on the machines. The job was -- you\nknow, I was already a 13 - 14 year old girl and it wasn\u2019t a job that a 14 year couldn\u2019t\nhandle. Because what it meant is that the -- the artillery shells, you had to put it on the\nmachine and put a type of knife to it, that was part of the machine and the knife scraped\nthe first layer of the -- of the -- of the -- no, not cannon, the shell -- the shell, cannon\nshell. And then you took it off and you put it on the one end and then you reached for the\nother. Of course you were being watched all the time and you had to deliver a num -- a\ncertain number of these shells had to be peeled. Peeled is the w -- it\u2019s not the word, but if\nyou know what I mean. That outer shell had to be peeled and that was the job. And I\nworked for a time -- that was brutal work and I saw the men -- th-the Jewish men work at\nthe open ovens, you know, where the -- the smelting was done and where -- that was 1n-\nincredible -- that was just incredible. And when they were shaping these cannons and\nthey were taking them out from the hot oven with the -- like big pincers, you know, and\nputting them down. Anyhow, I worked there for a very short time, because when the\ncamps were finally combined -- and I -- I can\u2019t give the year, but was between October\n1942 and end of July 1944. So I don\u2019t remember exactly how long I lived on Shellneetsa\nand how many months I worked in the factory, but I do know that when we were\ntransferred, the two camps were combined and we all lived on Mioufka. I went back to\nthe laundry again. So here we were able, again, to see my father, but we never talk --\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know, here and there, we could maybe say something as we were passing,\nbut we knew he was there, he knew we were there and the men\u2019s barracks were on the\nother side, but we still, there was a way of waving or seeing or -- not touching or\nwhatever, but he knew we were there and -- and most families that ended up in the camp\ncould one way or another communicate. The life was very, very hard. Very, very hard.\nWe -- you know it\u2019s so hard to come back to talk about the hunger, because hunger was\nas present as -- as -- as the blood runs in your -- in your -- in your veins, you know? From\nthe day the war broke out, we knew nothing but hunger. But there was always a way of\nscraping together -- of -- of selling some things and getting money and getting some\nfood, but when you finally ended up in the camps, unless you really had big money, there\nwas no way that you could survive on what was given to you. We were very lucky,\nbecause we had -- my mother -- my parents had very dear Christian friends and before we\nwere thrown out of the original apartment, Mother begged them to take s -- to take -- to --\nto -- to save for us, some of the more personal things like little silver Passover drinking\ncups -- \u2019ll show you, I have one. The candlesticks, some crystal, some other things that\nwere inscribed, my parents wedding gifts and silver that had inscriptions and such. So\nthey took all of that, those -- sh -- they absolutely wouldn\u2019t want to do it. Th-they -- they\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t give it to us.\u201d Mother says, \u201cI\u2019m not giving it to you,\nI -- \u2019'm asking you to just keep it for us.\u201d Well, it so happens that husband of -- this was\nmy parent\u2019s friends, there were a few sisters, married. One of the husbands worked 1n the\nmunitions factory, Christian. And he was able -- they were -- started selling -- they\nstarted selling -- because w-we send word that we need money desperately -- they started\nselling some of the things they had, valuable things. He would bring us and he would buy\nstuff and bring it to the factory and he would send it through people who worked in the\nfactory, so that -- in the Shellneetsa camp and even in the Mioufka camp, we still lived on\nstuff and money that they would -- they would send in the money or some bread or\nwhatever. And we could not have probably survived without that. And --",
        "Q: Where -- where could you buy those things? In -- in -- in the camp, or --",
        "A: Yes, there was -- there was always barter, because people -- you see, in the factory,\nthe Jews mixed with the Poles, you see? The Jews were slave labor, but the Poles were\nthe workers that -- the Jews, obviously were not the only ones working there. The local\nPoles worked in the factory, so some of these Jews who -- who had a way of mixing with\nthe people in the factory, had a way of bartering and sending, or -- you know. So this is\nhow we were able to really not die of hunger in -- 1n that -- in Starachowice labor camp.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, can I just ask you one question?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was the -- the daily -- tell us a little bit more about the daily routine. How --\nwhat -- what did you do every day?",
        "A: Yes. Well, specifically, the people who went to work, went on an eight hours shift.\nThey were taken there by the Ukrainians, they were brought back. There was soup being\ndoled out for them. After that, you had to stay in your bunk, because there was no place\nto go and you were absolutely petrified to go outside, because if you showed yourself, the\nUkrainian or the -- the -- the Nazi German could kill you or decide to -- he wanted you to\n-- to do some other job. The worst way was to hide. So the labor in the factory was very\nhard. When you don\u2019t eat and you work so hard, all you can do when you come home is\njust drop and you just stay until they call you again. I personally worked in the laundry,\nwhere it -- everybody brought in the stuff that they wore, that was full of lice and\neverything, put it in the cauldron and we would push it with sticks and cook -- boil it.\nAnd then, after it dried, everybody would come and -- and be handed out. I mean, if you\nwere size 12, you got size 95. If you were size 14, you got size six, whatever th -- you\nknow, so what you had, you had and what you didn\u2019t have, you didn\u2019t have next time or\nyou did -- anyhow, this is how things were. The camp itself was, as I said, with barbed\nwire. It had th-th-th tower guards. There was no mixing of -- of men and women. Father\nwas a scribe again and he -- we saw him. We saw him because he worked 1n a little\noffice, like a place. So sometimes if there was business to go in that barrack where the\noffice was, we saw him. And people who went to work, as I told you, were absolutely ex\n-- exhausted beyond words when they would come back. There was no way of staying\nclean, you see. That was the bad part. In the Shellneetsa camp, there was a little brook\nrunning through, so people would go and wash themselves, even in the winter. Men\nwould undress and wash their bodies in the win -- but in Mioufka, there was -- you have\nto scrounge to get a -- a basin of water and everybody would wash up at the same time,\nyou know. It was -- lice -- lice were -- 1-1-1t w -- it was a plague of lice that was even\nmaybe not as bad as in Auschwitz, but 1t was very bad. Those were the two major things,\nhunger and lice. Of course, sickness too, but you didn\u2019t know, because once you got sick,\nyou -- that was the end of you anyhow. No matter how -- and I\u2019m not talking big\nsicknesses, typhus, but even an infection, if you -- if infection went an-any higher than an\narm and got you into a body infection, forget it. So th-they said they didn\u2019t have doctors.\nThey had little infirmary, I remember, where was that? In Mioufka, I think. That was -- I\nthink for show, because nobody who was really sick ever made it anywhere, except a gun\nto his head, so.",
        "Q: How did -- how did your sisters or women deal with menstruation or other kind of\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Well this, I really -- you see, I think some women stopped menstruating. I personally\nnever started. Of course I was too young. I never started. I wasn\u2019t developed, I was flat\nlike a board and I never menstruated, not til the -- two years after the war. This -- I don\u2019t\nknow, they used to say -- I\u2019m sort of getting ahead of myself, but you asked me the\nquestion. Wom -- | heard it said in Auschwitz that they put something in the -- in the\nfood. They used to call it brum -- brum. I really don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what it wa --\nwhatever it was. That they -- women in Auschwitz didn\u2019t menstruate as far as I know,\nbecause they said that that was brum that was in the food. This is -- could be he-hearsay\nand could be -- might not be in any way part of the truth. I\u2019m just saying that this 1s what\nI remembered because everybody was saying that I had nothing to worry about, since I\nnever started, I wouldn\u2019t start it in Auschwitz for sure, because there was brum in the\nfood.",
        "Q: Who was it -- who put that in, according to what you heard?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know who could -- whoever -- the -- the food was cooked -- in Auschwitz, this\nwas community cooking, whatever it was. The same was here. This was community\ncooking, you see? And people here, in the camp, in Mioufka camp or Shellneetsa camp,\nstill had that little piece of bread from here or there, from the town Polish people, who --\nwho bought stuff and brought in and wa -- that. But, no, those were the two major\nproblems. Not -- not two major problems and only a million others when you feared for\nyour life every second, but the daily hunger and the lice, that was like a -- something\nnever left you, never for a second. And still living -- living in Starachowice camp with\nlocal women and some -- really newcomers, but it really was still a homogenous type of\ngroup, you see? It wasn\u2019t like later on in Auschwitz when you were mixed with the\nworld, nobody knew who you were then, couldn\u2019t care less. I personally owe my survival\nvery much to people who -- who looked after me. Not just my sisters, you know, which\nthey did. They are responsible for my survival, but other people because there was\nalways the connection, they remember me as that skinny kid or whatever. They took pity\non me. They always helped me, people always helped me. Always. I don\u2019t know why, I\nmust have been a sorry sight. I must have been, you know, an undernourished, skinny kid\nlooks like a devil probably, like a skeleton. So, I don\u2019t know. But this was still a\nhomogenous group that made you feel that you are still attached to some kind of life that\nwas your own. You know, at that t -- before this life, because in Auschwitz, you already\ndoubted yourself, that you came from another life, because how could that be? You were\na million years away from something that was normal. And here there wasn\u2019t anybody\nwho even knew that you -- who you were or whatever, you see? So life in Starachowice\nlabor camps -- I said camps because you know, the two -- was still very much normal.\nAnd this lasted til 1944, where the camp was loaded onto trains into tr -- into Auschwitz.\nThat was end of July or early August. And we didn\u2019t know why, because obviously we\nnever knew why anything was happening, nobody told us and they certainly kept it from\nus on purpose. But a rumor was that the Russian front was nearing from the east and of\ncourse later on, we found out in Auschwitz that all these labor camps that were situated in\nthis heart of Poland, that did war production for the Germans were liquidated about the\ntime we were. And so we\u2019re talking now about 1944, end of July.",
        "Q: Be-Before we move on to that --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: Just maybe one [indecipherable] question. How did you keep your strength in all of\nthis? Yes -- yes, you were close with your sisters?",
        "A: Very.",
        "Q: Wha-What was -- what did you think about to keep you [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, well, would you believe it, we were singing. We sang songs, we remember a lot\nof poetry, Polish poetry, it\u2019s true. To this day I remember Polish poetry. Not just Polish, I\nremember Shakespeare in Polish. \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d I remember. \u201cDiz bed\nbiedna sheetem shezak nie.\u201d\u201d You know, I remember these hard pieces to this day, a\nmillion years later. Well, anyhow, no, we were -- we knew mother did not get resettled.\nThat was finally brought back to us one way or another. That the train that left\nStarachowice during the ulseedlung, during the vished lenya, or whatever, clearing of the\nJews, did not get resettled, 1t got sent straight into Treblinka. So mother perished and we\nknew it. I mean we -- that much we -- because everybody knew that nobody from that --\nfrom our home people survived, that went on that train. My sisters and I were very, very,\nvery close. We told the -- talked about old times, we recited poetry, we sung, we were\nhungry, we were terribly, terribly hungry. We saw father every now and then. He got\nvery aged or very old looking. He wasn\u2019t an old man. He broke -- his spirit was broken,\nyou could see that. He was gray and he -- he was a cigarette smoker and now he coughed\nconstantly, you know. He had this bad cough and -- but the fact that we were around and\nhe saw all these other people, you know. We were, after all -- probably 80 percent of that\ncamp was still people from our hometown. So that more or less kept his spirit up, in that\nsense that people were trying to think back to good things and -- and -- and -- and -- and\nrehash and rehash. I used to dream, there and in Auschwitz, about the way the table -- my\nmother set the table. I don\u2019t know, I -- I must have had the hang up about -- hang up\nabout cooking or whatever, serving. I remembered the beautiful way the table was set. So\nI used to dream about it, you know. She had that artistic touch of setting the table. And I s\n-- we talked about it and we -- we talked about it 50 times, all the time of the same kind\nof this con-conversation. And of course father was around, that was a great consolation\nand when we came to Auschwitz, that was the last time we saw our father.",
        "Q: We take a break and just change the cassette now.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a conintin -- continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Regina Gelb. This 1s tape number two, side B. And we just talked about --",
        "A: We talked about the liquidation of the camp in Starachowice, when we were loaded up\non the train and on the way to Auschwitz. Now, there is a very important point here I\nwanted to bring up. You know, people say, well why didn\u2019t anybody do this and they\ndidn\u2019t rebel and peoples went like sheep to the slaughter. When the two camps were\ncombined, Shellneetsa and s -- and Mioufka and people were still employed by the\nfactories, living was sort of made to -- to -- generally speaking, people should be able to\nsleep and -- and -- and have a place and because they had to work next day. Just before --\ntoward the end of July, just before we were sent to Auschwitz, we were moved out of the\nlast camp, which was Mioufka, into something that was sort of like a camp, but it wasn\u2019t,\nbecause it was people just shoved into some kind of barracks and there was m-many\nmore guards with towers. And this particular enclosure was very near the siding -- the\nrailroad siding, because you know, a factory that operates, has to have a railroad siding.\nWell, that was a siding that was right adjacent to that third place, which was a camp, but\nwasn\u2019t a camp. It was like -- I can\u2019t quite describe it to you. Well, what happened is,\nsomehow the word got around that this is the end -- this is the end. Now when we\u2019re\ngetting shipped, we\u2019re really going to go like the people originally went -- wherever it\nwas they went -- we\u2019re not being resettled, this 1s for sure. We\u2019re just going to be killed.\nSo the same night, some young fellows and strong young women, tried to break out. The\nca -- that place -- I'll call 1t camp again, but it was a place, a -- like a -- a pen -- type of a\npen, you know -- had a wooden fence and behind it, wire -- on top of 1t wire. No, barbed\nwire. That night bef, -- the day -- th-the night before we were actually shipped to\nAuschwitz, some people decided to run away and they pulled out a few of the planks\nfrom the wooden fence and as soon as that happened, whoever felt this was the\nopportunity, started running that way. The German guards were shooting out of -- no, th-\nthese were Ukrainians, probably. Ukrainian guards started shooting right into this -- th-\nthe moving bodies, the reflectors, you know, they started sending them. Before you knew\nit there were dogs, there were -- all the Germans were out. Some people made it out, the\nrest didn\u2019t and there was a heap of bodies right at that opening. Whether everybody there\nwas already dead, or whether he was just d-dying, only a few people made it out. And\none of them was my brother-in-law and he made it out, the Canadian brother-in-law, he\nmade it out. But the others, I don\u2019t know how many people made ou -- made it out of that\n-- thr -- because th-the hole was very narrow and by the time they got going, it was\nalready too late. And there was a woman that was shot in the legs. She -- they let her die\nall night long, in the middle of the -- of that area and her agonies -- cries of agony went\non all night long. They did -- they -- obviously they weren\u2019t going to shoot her to kill her,\nbecause they wanted that to teach other people a lesson. And she was begging to be\nkilled. She was in -- in terrible agony. She kept yelling that her legs were shot off, I don\u2019t\nknow. Because she was laying 1n the middle and we heard her. Well, next morning, we\nwere put on the trains, there wasn\u2019t -- probably not even any marching to do because the\ntrain was right there. We were put on the train. Again, we had no idea where we were\ngoing. Women in separate cars and the men in other cars. And it so happens that the last\ncar where the men were, had my father in it. And the first car where the women were, had\nus in it. So that when we arrived in Auschwitz -- and we had no idea where we were\ngoing and we were unloaded on the platform, we saw my father in the group with the\nmen. Because they were, this was the tail end of the men th -- contingent. And we were\nfirst in the women\u2019s contingent, so we still saw him, he saw us. And that was the end. We\nnever, ever saw him again. People from my hometown who did survive Auschwitz told\nus that after he arrived in Auschwitz, he totally gave up. He was -- he was a man that was\nlost to the world. He got very sick, his legs were swollen and of course he was killed and\ncremate -- I mean he was -- he went out like everybody else, through the chimney. And\nwe were told this was in October. You see, we arrived in August in Auschwitz, early\nAugust. So he lived maybe not quite two months. He still lived, but of course we never\nsaw him. But we were told what happened, that he was -- h-he -- I think his spirit was\ngone and th -- everything just went after that and he -- he gave up. I don\u2019t really, truly\nknow what was his work assignment so to say, because you know labor in -- in -- in\nAuschwitz was not labor, it was just work to make you -- to exhaust you, you know.",
        "Q: Did he see you too, when you saw him?",
        "A: Yes, on the platform, yes. He saw us, we knew he saw us, because you know, we sort\nof communicated. And -- you couldn\u2019t wave, obviously, but he saw us, because he was at\nthe tail end of that group, that -- from which we were separated. So he knew that the three\nof us were together and that was the last we saw him. So, you see, my mother was -- my\nmother went to Treblinka in October \u201842 and my father just lived two more years and -- if\nyou call that life -- so he perished in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: What -- what happened when you arrived there? What -- what went forth?",
        "A: Well, the first thing obviously was to be tattooed. You know, they wouldn\u2019t let you\nanywhere without being tattooed. So we decided that we were going to line up one next\nto the other, because we knew by then that, you know, numbers are in sequence and if\nyou have numbers in sequence, you have a chance to -- to -- to be within that number --\ngroup number. So my oldest sister Hanya, Anna had the first num -- whatever the number\nwas. Kris, Krisha, the second, had the second number and I had the third. So we had a\nsequence of numbers. And it proved to be lifesaving because at Auschwitz, as you know,\nthere were no names any more, there were just numbers. If they needed a contingent of\npeople, they would call numbers, let say from 15 to 95. You see? So -- it so happens,\nwhenever we were sent somewhere, we were called by that -- we were lucky enough -- of\ncourse sometimes you can be cut off at the num -- end of the number too, but it so\nhappens that our numbers were always in that nu -- group number. And after we were\ntattooed, we were told to disrobe and go into what was called showers. Nobody knew\nwhat that was and there was one chimney going, you could see fire coming out. One\ncrematorium, because by then, you know, this -- this 1s 1944, August and the war isn\u2019t\ngoing so well for the Germans, so I understand that they have destroyed some of the\ncrematories. One was still belching fire when we came. The smell was incredible,\nincredible. And of course, at night, you could see the fire against the sky. And I don\u2019t\nknow, I must have rationalized that fire somehow. You know why? Because 1n my\nhometown, when they used to melt the ore -- smelt the ore, they used to -- my hometowns\nwas sort of hilly. They used to bring the lorries with the hot s -- the leftover from the --\nfrom the ve -- the ore that was smelted out of it. The leftover was called jujer, lighting it\u2019s\ncauks or whatever it was called. They used to pour it out from those lorries, over the --\nover the embankment of the hills, so that you saw a -- like a long -- now what? Like a\nbelt, you know? Pass, what is the word? Just escaped me. Anyhow, when you saw the --\nthe -- the -- this -- this -- this lava type of a fire pouring down and I knew this was just\nmelting -- this was fire. It looked like fire at night, you see, if you ever saw it. When I\nwas in Auschwitz, maybe I -- I always thought of it. Maybe I rationalized. When I saw\nthat flame going out of the chimney -- they said to me, \u201cYou know they\u2019re burning\npeople in there.\u201d But I said to myself, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s -- what is there is that what I saw as\na child when I saw that flame in the dark. The stuff that poured out of the lorries, you\nknow -- of the -- of the -- the byproduct of the smelting.\u201d But of course was a big -- as\nthey say a pipe dream, because this was the true burning flesh, which you could smell.\nYou could almost touch it, that\u2019s how pervasive it was. And we -- I don\u2019t know how\nmuch I knew, if anything, that the -- Auschwitz, the name or the -- the -- the whole --\nwhat it was all about. Except that now, having been shifted so many times, you know,\nfrom the ghetto to a camp, to another camp, to another holding place, you know, this was\njust another place, you know. And when we came in, we were held on what was called\nquarantine. The situation in Auschwitz was different too, you see, because by now, the --\nsome of the crematories were -- were gone, but they were still burning and they were still\neliminating people as fast as they could, but I don\u2019t know what the projection of time was\nwith them, how they were going to do it all. They put us on the -- what you -- what 1s\ncalled quarantine, which meant nothing. It meant they give us wo-work to do that was\nmeaningless. There was a pile of rocks here on one end and there was a pile of rocks on\nthe other end of the camp. You had to -- very heavy -- you carried the rocks from this end\nto the e-end, to the other. And then you went over to the other side and carried them\nback. In fact, in one of those rock carrying ex-expeditions, we saw my aunt, Uncle\nAlexander\u2019s wife with the Radom group. They were -- the Radom ghetto was eli -- of\ncourse, as I told you before, all -- with the Russian offensive coming from the east, all\nthese camps w -- and ghettos and whatever, were being shipped westward. We didn\u2019t\nknow that Uncle Alexander survived. We just knew that his two sons ran away to Russia\nat the beginning of the war, but we didn\u2019t know about Uncle or -- or his wife. Sure\nenough, there we saw her, in Auschwitz, going the other way with the rocks, and we were\ngoing this way. We lived in a barracks, nine people to a bunk, nine women. We slept\nhead to -- head to foot, because nine women Is totally impossible to fit into this kind of an\narea. It was just wooden bunks. As you know, Auschwitz stories -- we had to -- we were\ncounted. We had to line up for role call every morning. During the quarantine, we had to\ndo it more than twice a day. Later on, when we worked outside, we had to once. In the\nmorning once, in the evening, but during quarantine, whenever you went indoors, they\ncalled you out again and you had to line up. And if they didn\u2019t like the way you stood, or\nwhatever, they could just shoot you, which they did. And we were still very much with\nthe original group. Now, when we first arrived and we were -- you know, everybody\u2019s\nhair was cut -- I don\u2019t mean cut, you know, they grabbed alil hair and chopped it off. My\noldest sister Hanya spoke back to the women who was cutting her hair, who was a\nCzechoslovak woman. For that, the Czechoslovak woman called her, \u201cYou Polish pig,\u201d\nand she shaved her head to zero. Totally zero. And they gave us clothes that of course\ndidn\u2019t fit. I don\u2019t have to tell you because they were throwing it at you as you were\npassing out of the -- where the -- where your head was -- where your head was cut. And\nyou just took it, whatever, big, small or in between. Whether it fit or not, you had to\nchange with other people to fit you. And wooden shoes. And the barracks, that was\nanother thing. I mean, lice -- when we talked about lice in Starachowice, that\u2019s one thing,\nwhen you talk about lice in Auschwitz, that was already beyond description. There was a\nl-latrine behind the building. You had to wait your turn. Of course you had to sit with at\nleast 20 other people. They had sort of boards with holes in them -- awful. We\u2019re not\ntalking here in any way privacy or anything, believe me. At the lowest level of human\nexistence, you probably do not encounter this type -- this type of existence. This is below\n-- below what human mind considers as -- as human. This was exhausting work and it\nwas no work. It w -- we were -- we knew we -- we knew that we were expendable,\nbecause we weren\u2019t -- you know, in the factories you knew, \u201cOh, they need us.\u201d You\nknow, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll survive the war because they need us.\u201d Here they couldn\u2019t have\nneeded us, because what we were doing 1s we were taking the rocks from here to there\nand my aunt was bringing the same rocks when we saw her pass by with the other group,\nbringing the same rocks back there. So they didn\u2019t really need us. You see, that much you\ncould figure out. The barracks were run by Czechoslovak women. Very, very cruel --\nextreme. One day -- this -- this subject should really be analyzed. What makes\ncollaborators more cruel than the perpetrators? This is a very important philosophical\nquestion. Because my encounter with the Ukrainians and with the Czech women and with\nall the other collaborators or functionaries of the Nazis, actually exceeded, sometimes,\nthe brutality and the total disregard for the person. And I have an anecdote from that\nperiod, which is -- which compares to the fact when my father was first time caught to go\nand c -- to clean the -- the railroad station, the -- the insult that it was. You know, that --\nat that time, that the insult that he was called a Jew and not a gentleman and that he had\nto s -- clean. When we were in the barracks in Auschwitz and this woman, this Czech\nwoman -- big, hefty, strong, sort of like an animal type. Aronka was her name. I was\ngoing to the latrine, or coming from the latrine and she stood there, she saw me and she\ncalls me over, she always calls me Polish pigs. She always says, \u201cPolska schvina.\u201d She --\nshe -- she called all the women like that. And she put up her foot, she had boots, leather\nboots and told me to clean her -- to polish her boots and I didn\u2019t have anything and she\nsays to spit on it and polish it. I took it as such humiliation. I mean, it\u2019s like my father\u2019s\nhumiliation at the railroad station. In the scheme of things, in this -- in thi -- in this whole\npicture of what was happening, why was I so upset about this? I guess because it was\nperson to person, you know? And she wasn\u2019t a German. She was not supposed to be a\nNazi, she was only the block altester. The supervisor of the barrack. So, why I should\nhave thought that she would be more human or what -- expect -- whatever it was, it was a\nterrible personal insult to me and believe me, I was already beaten up in Auschwitz by an\nSS man by that time. He hit me with a ring, had a heavy ring on the mouth and I was\nbleeding and I -- I was suffering from hunger and from every -- and here, out of\neverything, I should get upset about that. I cried over that. I didn\u2019t cry over the others\nthings. And then of course she kicked me and she -- she didn\u2019t even -- you know, when I\nwas down she kicked me and she told me to go in or whatever. So, th-the first months,\nthat\u2019s -- that was the first very, very disorienting --",
        "Q: What was the relationship between th-the prisoners? Was there --",
        "A: Very good, yes.",
        "Q: Was that di-different from the camps, or was it equally [indecipherable] supportive?",
        "A: Yes. It was very supportive. I'll tell you that -- as I told you, we are s -- we were\ntraveling still with the same group. We are still with the people from my hometown or\neven if they weren\u2019t from my hometown, they were sent in, but they were -- they were\nalready in that group that came from Starachowice. And the relationship was family like.\nEach one was looking out for another. And then I remember, that barrack of ours\nreceived a shipment of people from Salaneeka. Jew -- of course we couldn\u2019t -- Jewish\nwomen from Greece. We couldn\u2019t speak to them. I don\u2019t know that -- whatever. But we\nfelt a kinship, I remembered -- I remember that. I remember that we felt a kinship\nbecause we were a group, we were still a group, you see? Even if -- if -- if you didn\u2019t\nsleep with the -- the nine people, or not all the people, you know, you still were a group.\nAnd I -- you know and I analyze it, I always said because they knew you when, you\nknow. These people were still a connection to your old past and you knew them as these\nother people, you know? Because the rest didn\u2019t seem human in any way. And after this\none month of quarantine, we finally were called on the job, what is called gainful\nemployment, which was -- this could have been the end of us, that\u2019s for sure. It was to cut\ntwigs in the marshes. This is now August, Sept -- something like early October. We had\nto march out so we would be counted. Now it\u2019s strictly roll call twice a day. They count\nus out, we had to stand -- whoever didn\u2019t look right got shot or got send out, because you\ncouldn\u2019t go to work any more. We would march through those gates, you know, are bike\nmarkt fry and out to the marshes, we would cut marshes. We would stand in water, cut\nthe marshes, they would bring in cauldrons of -- of soup that\u2019s -- you know, the\nAuschwitz soup. We were fed that and then we would come back at night, count, go to --\nto -- to sleep and get up in the morning and start again. And we worked there I think for a\nmonth. And this is also in my mind, you know -- sa -- th -- always there 1s -- always say a\nsnippet of a remembrance that -- that comes out of every horrible experience that sticks in\nyour mind. Just like Aronka with the shoes -- why I should cry over having to -- to -- to\nbe humiliated like this, I don\u2019t know. But then there was another aspect of this kind or\nremembrance -- this kind of remembrance, the -- you know, from the general to the\nparticular, we were marching to the march -- to the marshes. And there were these private\ndwellings, private homes around it -- alon-along the route. And I think the German\nguards lived there or whoever. Because it was so near Ausch -- near the camp that you\ncouldn\u2019t possibly have strangers. I don\u2019t know. Whoever lived there had to know\neverything that was going on. So I don\u2019t know who lived there. But anyhow, those were\nnormal houses, they had geranium boxes in the window. They had pillows airing in the\nwindows. And it broke my heart to see that people were actually living a life from which\nwe were -- we came, too, but 1t was nothing 1n any way to compare to -- how to judge our\nown existence. You see, there was this life, these people got up in the morning, it was a\nbeautiful day, cold or hot, was beautiful, dry. You put the windows u -- put the windows\nopen, you put the pillows in the window. That\u2019s what people did in Poland, you know.\nAnd people had geranium boxes in the window. And of course our own assessment of\nwho we were, wer -- was -- was already far away from what we really thought we were.\nBecause we were in -- so dehumanized in the process of all these particular humiliations\nand the group humiliations and the murder and the -- and -- and watching. Of course I -- I\ncould go on and on forever to talk about all the -- the -- the -- the unnecessary brutality,\nyou know? Okay, sometimes you explain to yourself that you see a man si -- seeing a pair\nof boots and -- and running out of the line-up and grabbing the pair of boots, well -- the g\n-- Nazi guard ha -- says to himself, \u201cWell, I have to do it, because this 1s a criminal,\nright?\u201d But aside from that, when you saw the brutality and the cruelty of people to other\npeople for no reason, it dehumanized you to the point that you yours -- your own\nassessment of yourself was -- is that other person that you were, is that pers -- is that you\nor is this, that you don\u2019t react the way you really should react to seeing those horrible\nthings? Of course when you are in it yourself, you are forever preoccupied with survival\nbecause that is a very strong instinct, you know. The instinct of survival is so strong, no\nmatter how old you are -- I don\u2019t know how it is when you\u2019re really older, but when\nyou\u2019re a young child and you haven\u2019t lived yet and you -- and -- and then of course in the\nback of my mind, I always said to myself, \u201cGee whiz, I know my mother used to say not\nto say I was smart, I was good in school, but I think maybe I am, you know, maybe I\nreally, you know, I could -- I could beat this.\u201d But then of course I realized that I was\nundernourished and all this and I didn\u2019t have the physical prospects of survival because I\nreally -- I don\u2019t know how long it would have taken for me to -- to -- to just fall by the\nwayside there, because the jobs were -- the job was extremely, extremely hard. And\nagain, to talk in a historical perspective, I s-subsequently found out that there were some\nwomen who ran away from Auschwitz and that the Germans decided -- because you\nknow, the marshes that were around the camp -- the Auschwitz - Birkenau camp, were\nsort of protective. They didn\u2019t show what was going on. But by the same token, they\ncould hide people. So some people made it out. Some people were, as a matter of fact,\ndid run away and they were caught. You know, there were executions in Auschwitz that\neven I remember. But the point was that when we were sent to cut the -- the brush from\nthe marshes, that was -- the reason was that the women who ran away hi-hid in there. So\nthey wanted now cleared. So we had this specific idea in mind, that they really need us --\nnot -- not that we knew why they want to cut it, but if they wanted to cut it, that was a job\nand it was going to take a long time, because there was plenty of it. So, by virtue of being\nneeded, we had a chance to survive. Now the question in my case was, wa -- did I have a\nchance to survive, physically? Even if I outwitted myself and worked hard and ev --\nwould I be able to survive? Well, Auschwitz -- life in -- up to that point -- it was no\nprospect of any kind of getting out of there. We knew by then that they were burning\npeople, because we inquired about the flesh -- the smell of the burning flesh and by then\nwe knew. There were other transports coming in. The Gypsies -- lots of Gypsies were\nsent in. The Hungarian transports. This is all -- you know this is -- we\u2019re talking now\nAugust, September. And we just -- anyhow, we -- we meaning my sisters and I. I\npersonally was thinking about all this time, but I was letting myself go with the -- with\nthe -- with the -- the flow, you know, however I was -- I was trying to accommodate\nmyself and of course my sisters were always protecting me. Because you know, when\nthere was a roll call and I was exhausted, I was always propped up, you know, they\npropped me up. I was the worst case of the three of us, really, because my oldest sister\nHanya, at least she was tall and she was already developed, it was a g -- nice girl, you\nknow, but she -- Kris was good too, but I didn\u2019t fit any picture of any kind of -- although\nthere were kids who came from our camp in Poland, they were younger than I am. There\nwere six and five and six and seven year old children who were in Auschwitz, who came\nfrom Starachowice camp. They were smuggled into the camps, in Starachowice by the\nparents and they were shipped with us and they lived in Auschwitz. Some of them -- a\nfew of them survived Auschwitz. But no I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t in any way figure out how that\nwas going to end. And of course there was -- it was a stroke of luck, we found out that\nthey were looking for -- we didn\u2019t find out, we were called, the numbers were called.\nThere were 30 women -- 30 women were called by num -- you know, to -- to go to\nanother place, you know? The most intelligent way of putting it -- an-another place. You\nknow, cause there was one place and there was the other, it was just one more place.\nWell, the other place happened to be a area called Brejinka, it was called Afectencomer.\nAnd there were Polish women who worked there -- only Christian Polish women. And\napparently they were either involved with the Polish underground, or suspected of\ninvolvement with the Polish underground. Whichever way, they were shipped out. And\nthey needed other people, too. So the number that came out to supplement them, to -- not\nto supplement, to replace them, was 30 and we were in the 30 and the three of us were in\nit cause we had the number. And this was a godsend because we now had to work\nindoors. You see, we were packing that -- th-that stuff that was hanging there from the\npolitical prisoners. We had to work indoors and do a lot of packing which was -- which\nwas child\u2019s play by comparison to the marshes. October, November, cold water, you\nknow. And at first we used to go back to the camp to sleep, but then that was\ndiscontinued. For whatever reason nobody told us. So they had barracks there and we\nslept. That was another godsend, it wasn\u2019t nine more people. It wasn\u2019t nine any more.\nThere were facilities to wash because we were handling things so I guess -- we didn\u2019t\nhave so mu -- many -- I mean the lice somehow -- however we controlled it. We could\nbathe now. Of course we -- they gave us clothes, because there was so much clothes in --\nin the -- you know, what was left behind. So we helped ourselves to clothes, to be -- to --\nto, you know, to dress to -- to size. Dress to size. We had -- they gave us shoes also, by\nmeasure, we could pick a pair of shoes to measure and we did not mix any more with the\nlarger camp, because they didn\u2019t want us mixed.",
        "Q: What was the actual work --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] to do?",
        "A: The actual work was as follows. You know that Auschwitz was an extermination\ncamp and a slave labor camp, at one time, combined. The extermination camp was\nbasically for Jews. The slave labor camp was also for political prisoners. Now, there were\na lot of Polish political prisoners who are in the underground or whoever. The Christians\nthat were suspected of anything were called political prisoners. Some of them were\npolitical but not everybody was political, but they weren\u2019t Jews, you see? So they had to\nbe called something, they were called political prisoners. When they were sent into the ca\n-- into Auschwitz, I understand their clothes was put in a bag. Like when we came in, we\njust dumped our clothes on the -- on the heap and we were given whatever. We never saw\nour clothes again. These people had -- you know the German ob-obsession with -- with --\nwith keeping records? Well, they -- their clothes was put into bags, sort of like sacks.\nEach one had a number and it hung, it was -- you know, like in a butcher shop, with the\nhooks? And it hu -- these sacks hang on sh -- on -- on hooks. Every time a prisoner like\nthis died, the bag of -- with the number had to be crossed out and the bag was repacked\ninto a package and sent to the haw -- to -- sent home. Or, if he was resettled, the bag went\nafter him. Of all the stuff and h -- genocide on an -- on a scale -- unprecedented scale,\nhere you talk about shipping the little sack of leftover clothes. I mean this is -- this is a\nmacabre picture to draw, but that\u2019s what it was. So this is what we did. We had to repack.\nI learned to pack there, very well. We had to repack these things. We had to re-hang them\nagain by numbers, you know. And heaven help you if there was ever anything missing. I\nmean, for that you could pay with your head. If you decided, while you were packing,\nthat you were going to take a glove, or something that you thought you want to take for\nyourself -- well we were smarter by then, than that. Besides, the Polish women that were\nstill left there, not all of them were shipped because obviously you cannot staff a -- a -- a\n-- a workplace with brand new people. You have to keep some of the old ones. They told\nus they were -- they were very intelligent women there, very. I -- some of them were\npolitical prisoners. So they told us the do\u2019s and the don\u2019ts and we surely minded\neverything they ever said. Life there really brought us around. Living there brought us\naround physically. I don\u2019t know if we slept two to a bunk or three, but 1t wasn\u2019t nine and\nwe didn\u2019t wear the same raggedy, t-torn rags that weren\u2019t even fitting. Here, if you -- it\u2019s\nsometimes found that you -- your -- your -- you tore your dress, you went over to the\nsupervisor and she would say, you come with me, I -- you pick a dress. You see? So that\nthat was also very important for later on, the fact that we were dressed properly and we\nhad proper shoes when we went on the march later on, the -- the -- the death march. But\nthat -- I\u2019m anticipating. It -- what I was trying to say 1s this -- we worked in that place,\nwhich was part of the Auschwitz complex, maybe for two months or something like this.\nBecause you see, the general evacuation from Auschwitz was Jan -- about mid January,\n1945. January 15th or so. And I would say that we worked there through Feb -- through\nDecember, surely. Some of November, maybe. Some of November, all of December and\nup to that point. At which -- which gave us a very good -- our bodies a very good chance\nto recover from the cold and the -- we were counted here, too and everything, but it\nwasn\u2019t any more like it was. And by the way, we were now separated from our\nhometown group. This was a totally different -- they -- these were people -- different\npeople and there the -- the Christian Polish women. Of course, we had a very good\nrelationship because -- maybe it\u2019s not nice to say, th -- in the way of bragging. Our Polish\nwas really very pure and very, very lovely. So, people could sort of -- could peg you.\nThey could figure out who you were by the way your Polish sounded, you know?",
        "Q: What was the -- what -- what -- how did you talk to people before you went there? I\nmean here, obviously you spoke Polish with --",
        "A: Right. No, in the barracks?",
        "Q: Always?",
        "Q: Polish and we knew some German, absolute. M -- Krisha studied German in high\nschool. Hanya studied -- you know, in Poland you had to study Latin. They both studied\nLatin, but Hanya was -- Hanya\u2019s language was French. She was wonderful, that\u2019s what\nshe tutored in. And we knew German because my father -- and during the war you heard\nit. So, we knew German, but basically 1t was Polish.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number three, side A. So now --",
        "A: So now we\u2019re up to the general evacuation of Auschwitz. The time 1s mid-January,\n1945. Historically, to put it in perspective, the Russian army is -- offensive is moving\never closer. In fact, the part of Poland where Starachowice was -- Starachowice camp was\nlocated, was already liberated in January 1945, when we first started. But they were\nalready liberated the year -- you know, at the end of last year, so after Starachowice,\nwhen we were still going through living hell and worse, that part was liberated. Meaning,\nyou know, the Russians were there. So we found ourselves in that march -- that was the\nso-called death march. I don\u2019t know that I need to -- to dwell on it, because it has been\nvery well documented all around and that was a horrendous experience. The camp was\nbeing evacuated en masse and people were being driven to a railroad station and people\nwere just -- 1t was winter, it was snowy, snowy winter. And people were just falling by\nthe wayside because we had to walk da-day and night and people were shot and killed\nright along and groups were now totally -- you know, things were just getting mixed up\nbecause men and women, you know -- th -- th -- it was -- it -- people from different parts\nof the camp -- anyhow, the -- the most outstanding recollection for me of that period, is\nnot what I remember, but what my sisters remember, is that I fell asleep on that march\nand I could not distinguish reality fr -- I was hallucinating and they were dragging me.\nAnd really, if I ever was going to perish, that was the time. They dragged me, they\nphysically dragged me. I was totally, completely swallowed up by the dream. I just didn\u2019t\nknow -- I just thought I was in some house and then we were told to stop on the road and\neverybody was relieving himself and my sisters told me to squat down an-and I wouldn\u2019t\ndo it, cause I thought I was dreaming and I wasn\u2019t going to do that. Well, anyhow, that\nwas another -- it was a horrendous experience, except I slept through it. And what I know\nabout that is what my sisters told me and the fact that I was finally awakened with a big\nh-hit on the head when -- when we were to move on after a night\u2019s sleep in a barn, that I\nreal-realized who I was and where I was. And we ended up on open cars -- on open\nrailroad cars. Not covered, open cars. Snow -- snow was falling and we were going\nsomewhere. Now we were sitting on the floor of these cars, all kinds of people, wi --\nspeaking all kinds of languages. Women, again, we were not mixed with men. You could\nhear Greek and Y-Yiddish and Polish and Russian and French and Hungarian. You name\nit, it was all one big -- we were really by ourselves on that march, the three of us. I don\u2019t\nknow how -- this is -- we\u2019ll all -- another subject. How it was, that knock wood, that we\nwere -- like that -- we were s -- always together.",
        "Q: How long did that last march?",
        "A: Th-Th -- I -- I think we marched maybe four or five days. The march. Then we came\nto those trains and I still don\u2019t know where it was. Th -- There were -- there were -- these\ntrains were waiting, 1t wasn\u2019t a station, it was some kind of a siding or whatever, you\nknow. This is all -- I was going to do research into it, but w-what will it give me if I fi --\ndo -- do know this? I don\u2019t need to know it and -- anyhow, we came from there\neventually. We came at night to a place, the sign was lit uf -- lit up -- Ravensbruck. Just\nlike in Auschwitz, we didn\u2019t know what it was, what -- it was another place, you know?\nSo they unloaded us and we had to stay where we were on the snow, because there was\nno place -- th -- just -- you know, they just said, \u201cYou just stay here.\u201d",
        "Q: Do you have any memory of that trip, because Ravensbruck is in northwestern\nGermany --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: That is a long time away from --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That was --",
        "A: I tell you what it was, it was -- we had with us a little sack of sugar, which was a\nluxury above luxuries, when we were leaving, the afectencomer last place. The snow was\nvery -- falling very heavily. We were covered with snow. We ate a drop of sugar and we\nate a drop of snow. You see? Mixed with -- everybody was eating snow. They scraped\ntheir coats or whatever they were wearing and how long -- you see, that\u2019s another thing, I\ndon\u2019t remember how long the march was. I don\u2019t remember how long we traveled to -- to\n-- to Ravensbriick. All I know is that when we came to Ravensbrtck, it was worse than\nanything else before. Now, if that is at all possible to say that, then -- that -- to say that\nyou came out of Auschwitz to something even worse, that\u2019s probably like a total\nexaggeration, which it isn\u2019t. The reason being that Ravensbriick was now a gathering\npoint for all the camps that were being evacuated. Now, in Auschwitz, they counted you,\nthey gave you a number, you were nine to a -- a boar -- to a -- the bunk. If one was\nmissing, the rest got th-th-th -- shot or killed, for whatever. You had to be accounted for\nand you had to do or not do exactly what you were told. And you got that -- that -- that\nslop of the soup that was nothing, but you got it. In Ravensbriick was nothing. It was\noverflowing with people. There was no room even for nine on a bunk. They built tents.\nThey kept us there because there was no room. They finally threw us into a tent. They\ntold us to get up off the snow and everybod -- the snow was all stained with urine,\nbecause we sat there, you know and everything and feces -- into that tent. There was no\nroom 1n the tents, there was like herring people next to each other. You know, like laid\nout like sardines. It was -- 1t was an incredible s-situation because you didn\u2019t have food.\nYou didn\u2019t know if you were going to get even that meager nothing, that -- that slop,\nwhatever it was. A piece of bread. You didn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t sleep, you couldn\u2019t\nundress. You -- you -- that was the end of the road. It was just bodies shoved into a tent,\nperiod. There was no organization. There was no counting, there was -- you know what I\nmean? Whereas they were obsessing about having the last -- the -- the number exactly to\nthe last digit, here they couldn\u2019t care less. So finally the word got around that the trucks\nwould be coming, that there would be shipments going out. That they were going to\nliquid -- not liquidate, they were going to reduce the number of people in Ravensbrick.\nSo my sisters decided that anything is better than this and frankly, you know, I -- I didn\u2019t\nparticipate much in the decisions, because really I didn\u2019t consider myself very much\naware of -- of -- of -- of -- that -- to plan it, to think it through. I -- I had a certain instinct\nof -- of self-preservation, but I didn\u2019t really know -- I didn\u2019t have the life experience to --\nto -- to -- to -- to do any planning type of -- you see? Of -- 0 -- any planning of any kind.\nAnyhow, they said, \u201cWherever we go is better than here.\u201d They said they were -- they\nneed people for some other place. And this could -- other place could have been another\nchimney, you know. That was to be taken into consideration. But my sisters said, \u201cAny\nplace is better than this place, because this place is -- is -- what\u2019s going to be here?\u201d So\nwe got on those trucks, the first trucks that came.",
        "Q: What -- how long were you staying there, roughly? Because it\u2019s --",
        "A: Maybe three weeks at the most. Two weeks, maybe. Two or three at the most.",
        "Q: But all this time in tents, in the cold, nothing?",
        "A: In the tent -- in the tent -- and no, there was food here and there. You know, they\nwould come around and they would dole out some soup, but it wasn\u2019t like in Auschwitz.\nYou went to the marshes, you came back, they bri -- brought you the food there or they --\nthey -- you -- they give you the one piece of bread in the morning for the day. You knew\nyou -- it was coming. You didn\u2019t know what was coming here, what wasn\u2019t coming. You\ncouldn\u2019t figure it out. And -- and then when you did come with the food, who was going\nto get there before you, t-to -- over your head, you see? Because this wasn\u2019t anything in\nany way organized to -- for any number of people. Certainly not for this number. This --\nthis was thousands upon thousands more than the camp could ever absorb. So when we\nfinally got on those trucks -- and surely we didn\u2019t know where we were going and surely\nwe could have been going to another -- t-to be burned like they were burning the flesh in\nAuschwitz. So, by now we were smarter, we were already -- we knew a lot of things now,\nyou see, because we knew about what Auschwitz was doing before we got there and all\nthat. So we came and the place we came to was Radsoff. A small camp, I think it\u2019s in\nMecklenburg, right?",
        "Q: Near Hamburg?",
        "A: Yes, right, exactly. And we came there and this was an empty camp. Small size,\nnothing like Auschwitz, nothing like Ravensbrick. It was just a small -- sort of the size of\na Starachowice labor camp type. Apparently that camp was near an Air Force base. There\nwere aircraft around, you know, in the -- not far and there was a base and the camp had\nbarracks and it had SS women running it. In uniform. And talk about women being\nbestial. Well, as you na -- can see, the world was opening to me all the time. All the\nassumptions I once had about how women were a little kinder than men, forget that. How\nthey collaborate as they enslaved could not be as -- as horrible -- as brutal as the\noriginators of the -- of the -- the planners and the originate -- forget about that. You see?\nSo, coming back to Radsoff -- when we arrived, I think there were only two or three\ntrucks of us. And what they wanted -- they staffed, they used us f -- to staff -- as -- as\nstaff for this camp. I ended up being a maid to one of the SS women. My sister Hanya got\na job cleaning her office. I was personal maid. Sister Hanya got a job in the office,\ncleaning the office and I forget what job my sister Krisha had. But she reminded me and I\ntotally forgot about that. She had a bad job and one day this SS woman, she took a liking\nto me, even though she wouldn\u2019t come within 10 feet of me, you know. Dirty Jew, I --\nyou -- you know, and -- so, she asks me if everything is all right and I said fine. I\u2019m -- I\nme -- I was scared of -- to death of her. I used to bring wood in and to her fire, you know,\nto heat the -- wash her laundry and iron and you know, all personal things. So, she asked\nme if everything was all right and if I have enough to eat, I said, \u201cYes, all right.\u201d So she\nsays, She left me bread -- crust -- she used to cut away the crust from the bread, but she\nwould never give it to me, because she wouldn\u2019t touch me, but she left it on the table. So\nshe says, \u201cFrom now on, whenever you come, there\u2019Il be crust here, so that\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d And then said, \u201cAnd -- and -- wh-what else? Do you have anybody here?\u201d I say,\n\u201cYes, I have sisters, one who works in the office, the other one has a bad job,\u201d I said. So\nshe said, \u201cAll right, I get her a good job.\u201d And Krisha got a job in the kitchen. I didn\u2019t\neven remember that, but she reminded me about that. And so the first transport that came\nout of Ravensbrick, into Radsoff and we are now talking about end of -- end of February\nor something like that, 1945, something like that. We came into Radsoff and we were\nfirst distributed as the maids and the kitchen help and all this. And then the pe -- other\npeople were sent in -- prisoners. And they had to dig ad -- anti-aircraft, because -- no --\ntrenches and -- and work at the air base. And the fact is that we didn\u2019t really know what\nwas going on, but we sort of had a feeling that things are not -- as far as the war 1s going\non, that things are not the same, things are quite different now. And life there, for us\npersonally, was not as harsh as anywhere else. First of all, because we were in direct\ncontact with the SS women -- in other words, they had to -- to -- to have us in their house\nto clean, we had to be clean -- not to mix with the general population. So underneath the\nbarracks was like -- like a cellar-like thing -- or under the offices, I don\u2019t know, it -- they\nlet us sleep in that basement type of thing. Also on bunks, but we were not mingling with\nthe population, you see? But we -- it so happens we had some friends there from other\nplaces. So -- so we had, again, indoor jobs. I -- I don\u2019t know if that -- how impressive that\ncould be, but if you think about the time of the year and what we went through and --\nanyhow, we had these indoor jobs and -- and they looked, the SS women, cruel as they\nwere -- and they were really horrible types -- it was for their own benefit to stay with the\npeople that they picked, you know. And 1-1f you turn out that you -- they liked you,\nwhich -- she liked me, what do you mean liked, how could she have liked me when I was\na nothing Jew? But I did -- I washed her laundry and I ironed her laundry and I washed\nthe -- cleaned the floor and I did the dishes and I brought in the wood and I -- I had the\nstove on for her and I -- you know, I did all the things that -- that -- polished her shoes\nand I did the best I could. So one way or another she couldn\u2019t hate me, because you\nknow, I was doing. I was doing things for her. We were in that camp -- I\u2019m trying to\nreconstruct, you know, I -- di-di-di-direct -- d-dates like this are hard to come by, but this\nhas to be mid -- mid-April or so. Mid- April, 1945. And all of a sudden, we hear\nbombing. The allies were bombing, you see? So that was very good news, for us. We\nheard the bombs falling and they were scared to death and we didn\u2019t care any more,\nbecause just to see them scared -- and they were running down where we were. They\nwere also running down into that cellar where we were sleeping, you know? They were\npetrified. But to us, it was just one more. Besides it -- we knew it was English. The\nEnglish or the Americans, we didn\u2019t know, but we knew somebody was bombing and\nthat\u2019s good. Because one way or another, this has to get resolved now. So after some very\nheavy bombardment a few times, by the allies -- obviously they must have been bombing\nthe airf -- air base, you see? Because we were in the middle of nowhere, but there was an\nair base. So after some of these bombings were over -- and again, I can\u2019t tell you exactly,\nbut it had to be about middle of April -- or early April, I don\u2019t know, 1945, they told us\nwe have to evacuate the camp and they were going, too. But of course, they weren\u2019t\ngoing to ki -- schlepp -- carry their own things. So each one of the maids had to carry a\nrucksack. A -- a backpack with her things and we were march -- we were formed in a\nformation and I think either the -- the -- the servants, meaning myself and the others,\neither were on the end or at the front, but we weren\u2019t mixed in, we were in a place all in\none group, because we were carrying that -- that -- the belongings, you know? And then -\n- I\u2019m sorry to say, I\u2019m totally ignorant of the area, but I know that we found ourselves -- I\nknow it\u2019s in Mecklenburg, but we found ourselves on the highway -- major highway and\nI don\u2019t know which it was, east -- west highway or north-south highway or whichever\nhighway it was -- it was a major highway because it was completely covered with people.\nYou had soldiers in uniform and soldiers out of uniforms and tanks and horses and -- and\ncows and people and Jews from camps and Christian Poles from the neighboring farms,\nyou know, the Christian Poles worked slave labor on farms. And POW\u2019s and all\nlanguages and -- and uniforms and not uniform. And you know, we walked in formation,\nwe had -- our clothes was marked with a big X -- with a -- like a -- you know, shiny kind\nof painting -- paint that was on both s -- you know, to mark us. So you could tell who we\nwere, but we were carrying these rucksacks -- these knapsacks for them and we were in a\ngroup. There were 12 of us. And before long, there was no place to go. On the side there,\nthere was a -- there a -- the Swedish -- Swedish Red Cross was giving out -- was giving\nout parcels. Not parcels, food rations. I don\u2019t know -- o-out of nowhere, it\u2019s like, you\nknow, 1-1-it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a total like -- it -- it -- like in a dream, you know, in a dream\nthings do not connect. One -- you dream that you are in school, but the school happens to\nbe in the middle of the ocean or something like that, you know, it doesn\u2019t connect. In this\nmelee of people, of -- of soldiers, of civilians, of -- of airplanes flying over, you don\u2019t\nknow which way you\u2019re going, north or south or whichever. You don\u2019t know -- and then\nyou just see rations given to you because they see that you\u2019re a prisoner, you see? Of\ncourse these German women, they grabbed all the cigarettes and everything and they\nstuck it in the knapsacks. Finally, we had to stop, because there was no place to go.\nNobody was moving, nothing was moving. There was -- it was total traffic jam, period.\nNo place to go. And there were embankments on both sides of the road and there were --\nfurther out was like a forest and on this side -- on the other side was also an embankment\nand a field. We were all sitting together, the -- the -- the servant girls, us with the\nknapsacks and one of the girls, her name was Hel-Helena, she was blonde, looked\nGerman, spoke German beautifully. She had an idea that we could now make our way\nout of here and nobody will know the difference, because it was the commotion. Not\ncommotion, th-the mixture of everything was -- you couldn\u2019t tell who was who and who\nwas going where and what was happening. So she says, why don\u2019t we sit down. The SS\nwomen were all together, they were hanging around where the rations were given out,\nbecause they could, you know, they could get their hands on things. So we\u2019re sitting on\nthe embankment and Helena says like this, \u201cYou know, I can get dressed,\u201d meaning her -\n- she can get dressed in one of the things that are in the knapsacks and we will move on\nthe side and we will sit there and if later on, after everybody moves and they find us, she\nwill say she\u2019s minding us. Which we did -- she took out a cape, a black cape out of one of\nthe knapsacks and put the head, th-th-the -- the hat on, the German hat and we moved\ndown the embankment, into the field and we walked very quietly. There was haysa --\nstacks, in the field and we hid behind the haystacks and before you knew it, everybody\nstarted moving and -- and we got left behind. Nobody even knew we got left behind,\nbecause who could even know? Who could even count? These German women, maybe\nthey themselves wanted to get away from us. If you think about it, you know?",
        "Q: How many girls were --",
        "A: 12, there were 12 of us. Th-The -- ma -- two sisters, myself and the others. This is all\nfrom -- from the Radsoff group that we came with. And I am thinking that they could not\nhave been all that stupid to see that we weren\u2019t together with them, but they maybe didn\u2019t\nwant to be together with us. However, it really worked to our advantage very well,\nbecause we found ourselves behind the h-haystacks and then a Pole came -- a man came\nover and he spoke Polish very well and he ask who we were and we said we detached\nourselves, we were prisoners. We were Jewish slave laborers and such and prisoners.\nAnd he says, \u201cWell, if you want to, there\u2019s a villa not far from here, you go there, there\u2019s\na woman and you tell her to feed you.\u201d And he said there were Polish workers around,\nstill on the fields, you see. So we went over, there was really a nice villa and there was\nthis woman and she fed us, was really just like he said. And we said, \u201cOh.\u201d We still\ndidn\u2019t -- we -- then we started hearing from them that the war is ending. But this is the\nend of April now. And we really didn\u2019t know who -- who was doing what and how 1s it\nending and where are the Germans? And we just saw by the way the highway was that\nthings weren\u2019t so hot for them, you see? That they were running away somewhere, I\ndon\u2019t know where. Anyhow, when we came to that villa and -- and we stayed overnight\nand lo and behold, next morning or next day, the Russians -- Russian soldiers arrived.\nThey arrived in -- like a -- a truck or something and they wanted to know who was who\nand we said who we were and we spoke Polish and there was a Russian woman with us\ntoo, because that was already out of Radsoff. And he says, \u201cGreat. He says, \u201cYou know,\nyou are here, wonderful, because we\u2019re going to be here and we\u2019re going to need girls to\nwork for us.\u201d So, he says, \u201cWe\u2019ll be here tomorrow and then you can go with us, we\u2019ll\nreally make it -- and make it good -- I mean you'll have -- you-you\u2019ll have a better life.\u201d\nAfter they left, the Russian women said, \u201cDon\u2019t trust them.\u201d And the women -- Polish\nwomen said they were raped, that the Russians were raping women. So we took off,\nbefore they came back, we took off and we didn\u2019t know -- w -- the only thing -- we didn\u2019t\nknow what to do or where to go. We didn\u2019t know anything. I-Is the war ended? It\u2019s not\nend, it\u2019s still going on, but it was already very late April and they said th-that the war was\nover. But we didn\u2019t know what over means. What does over mean, you know? So --",
        "Q: I -- I\u2019m just going to have t-two quick follow-up questions.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: Th-Th-The villa you -- the villa you went to, was that a German villa?",
        "A: Yes. That was a German villa, w-which belonged to lan -- German landowners, who\nwere employing slave labor -- Christian slave labor camp from Poland and Ukrainians --\nUkrainian women. They worked the fields while the Germans were in the army. They\nworked the fields. So that -- that\u2019s who it was.",
        "Q: And the other question was, what kind of physical shape were you in, the three of\nyou? How did you --",
        "A: Much better. Much better. First of all, you know, the last months and a half or two in\nAuschwitz were already restoring our health. As I told you before we left, we were given\nshoes and we were given clothes to fit, warm clothes. So that was already -- that saved\nour life in the march -- in the death march and riding into Ravensbriick. We got out of\nRavensbruck with -- a short time before we were defeated physically and mentally. In\nRadsoff, we had an indoor job. And Krisha was in the kitchen, we always had food to eat,\nyou know? She was leaving me the bread crust that I was giving out to other women\nbecause I don\u2019t even need it -- this, any more. Because you know, we had -- we still were\nwearing the same clothes that we came out of Auschwitz, that were fitting. This is a very\nimportant point, that you have shoes to wear and it wasn\u2019t wooden shoes like, you know,\nlike in Auschwitz that we wear -- wore wooden shoes. So that if you add it all up,\nRadsoff being -- did I say about two months or so? Something like this. That restored our\nhealth. So by the time we were out of Radsoff, we are still wearing Auschwitz clothes,\nwhich I told you, which were fitting. Our health -- not health, but we were restored. And\nwe had the energy, we didn\u2019t know which way we\u2019re going to be heading, so we were --\ndecide to go back home to Poland, because you have to find out who remain, who -- what\nhappened, even though we pretty much knew, you know? In -- we didn\u2019t know what\nhappened to father, but -- but we more or less -- things were begun to fall in, because we\nstarted asking around, the people, if they knew and then nobody knew and so on. We\ndecided to go back to Poland, not so much weesaw, most of us, of the 12. And we started\nwalking, we got on the train and there were transports, so they would dump us at the next\nstation, then we got on another train and went all the way to Bitgosh like this, on and off\nthe train and by that time, people saw who you were. First of all, you couldn\u2019t -- you\ncould not mistake us for anybody else, because we were marked with the -- with the X\u2019s\non the back and the front, so -- and of course we had numbers, but you didn\u2019t have to go\naround showing your number. Anybody who looked at you close, knew who you were,\nyou see? Didn\u2019t have to introduce yourself. So, they knew -- where you going? \u201cWell,\nwe're trying to go back to Poland.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d So they would say, \u201cAll right, now a new\ntransport is going to load up soldiers here. You stay on this platform, next train comes,\nthey\u2019ll take you.\u201d You see? So this is how it worked out, that eventually we were on the\ntrain, off the train, on the train, off the train. Fi -- It was if we didn\u2019t know where we\u2019re\ngoing, but we\u2019ll thought we\u2019ll go back to Starachowice, you see? And we were -- got on\nthe train and finally, on our last -- we came out of Bitgosh, we were just heading to\nPoland, w-we didn\u2019t know how we were heading. There was a -- a Russian soldiers 1n --\nsoldier in the train, heard us speak Polish and of course he saw who we were. As I told\nyou, we didn\u2019t have to introduce ourselves. So he says, \u201cYou\u2019re one of those camp\npeople?\u201d So we said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere you going?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going back to Poland.\u201d \u201cWhere\nin Poland?\u201d We said, \u201cStarachowice.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of town is it?\u201d He spoke Yiddish. \u201cIs it\na big city, is ita town?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a ci -- big city, it\u2019s a town,\u201d you know, the\ntown had 30,000 people, so it isn\u2019t what you call a city. It was a city, but 1t wasn\u2019t a big\ncity. Not like Krakow or Warsaw. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t go back to Starachowice, if that\u2019s\nwhere you came from. It\u2019s not safe for Jews to return to -- to small towns, because people\nare now -- they feel you come back for your property, they are killing people around\nthere. Don\u2019t go. You have to go to a big city.\u201d Warsaw, Krakow or Lodz. He said,\n\u2018\u201cWarsaw\u2019s all bombed out. Lodz has a very good Jewish agency set up. Best thing for\nyou is to go to Lodz.\u201d \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go to Lodz. Where are we going to go to Lodz? Who\ndo we know?\u201d He says, \u201cI have a sister there,\u201d he says. He gave us the add --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "A: The soldier whom we met in the train, coming out of Germany, I mean af -- when the\nwar ended, who happened to be a Jew -- a Jew in Russian uniform and who asked us on\nthe train where it was we were planning to go to -- in Poland and we told him that we\u2019re\ngoing home to Starachowice and he asked us what size town it was. Whether it was a big\ncity, which of course it wasn\u2019t, because the population was 30,000 and that\u2019s no big city.\nSo when he found out, he says, \u201cNo, you should not be going back to the small town,\nbecause they will not welcome you. They will think you\u2019re coming to claim your\nproperty or whichever it is and a lot of people returning from camps are being killed now,\nso you are better off going to one of three places. Warsaw, Krakow or Lodz. Warsaw is\nall bombed out -- unless you have somebody there, other than that, Krakow or Lodz.\u201d\nAnd we decided, \u201cFine, so we\u2019ll go to Lodz, but where do we go?\u201d And he says, \u201cWell, I\nhave a sister there,\u201d and he gave us the address. He says, \u201cYou go to her. Ring her\ndoorbell and tell her that I send you and there\u2019s a Jewish agency and you can register and\n-- and from there on, you'll be all right.\u201d\u201d\u00bb Which is exactly how it was and this is my --\nMay, 1945, now. We came and she had a lot of people -- lot of people sleeping on the\nfloor, sleeping on the stairway, all over the place. And next day we went to register. Of\ncourse we knew where to go, because she told us. The agencies, Jewish agencies that\nwere running the place, that were running the registration were HIAS and the Joint\nDistribution Committee. I think both, together or separately, however, but they were\ninternational Jewish organizations. There was also Red Cross in Lodz, that was\nregistering people, where we did register, but we were told that they are basically\ninterested in the Christians. And it\u2019s exactly how it was. So we -- as I said, we were --\nafter we registered, we had to go and check our names. Not just our names, check the\nnames of people who were returning -- whether relatives or neighbors or whoever. And\nbefore long we found out that Uncle Alexander, my father\u2019s brother arrived. Alexander\nLaks and he was from Radom. He had two sons that went to Russia when the war broke\nout and they eventually joined the unders army and went through to Herron and\nPalestine. And that\u2019s another chapter of the Holocaust, but we\u2019ll stick with this part now.\nUncle Alexander and his wife, Rose - Roosia, went through camps. We saw her in\nAuschwitz, as a matter of fact. I mentioned at the beginning when we were carrying the\nrocks one way and she was carrying the rocks the other way. Anyhow, he did not yet\nknow where she was, if she survived, but he was in -- in Lodz. He was a man of means\nbefore the war. He had real estate, a lot of real estate and property and a big business and\nso on. So he decided he would go to Radom and see what he could claim. He -- I think he\nhad some hidden assets too, hidden. The agency, the Jewish agency not only provided\nfood rations, but they also gave us a place to live in, which wasn\u2019t a place, it was more\nlike a -- the post war bombed out discard, but it was a place. And before we knew it, we\nmet Adrian, my s -- Canadian sister\u2019s husband, who was already in Lodz for quite awhile.\nHe was with us in the camps -- not in the camps, he was with us in Starachowice camps,\nup to the point where, on the eve of being shipped to Auschwitz, he broke out with the\nother prisoners, most of whom did not make it. He did make it. He made it out and he\nstayed with the Polish partisans. And of course, that was Au-August, 1944. He fought\nwith the partisans and then when that part of Poland was liberated, and that was way\nbefore we know of liberation, because that was almost like -- like -- like almost a year\nbefore we were liberated. We first went to Auschwitz. He found his mother, who was left\nbehind in Auschwitz, as human refuse, because she was totally on the verge of -- the\ncrematoria didn\u2019t work and they didn\u2019t -- they weren\u2019t going to take the time to kill her,\nfor whatever reason. So they didn\u2019t kill her, but she was left behind and she was liberated\nin January of 1945 by the Russians and somehow or other found her way to Lodz and\nfound -- he found her and they established a household. So when we were in Lodz, when\nwe just arrived in L6dz, we found Uncle Alexander and then we found Adrian and his\nmother. And we had a little -- a place to live in and we -- in fact we had this friend of\nmine from Israel, who also was the one, Hanna Tenser, who was in the gas chamber and\nwas left behind, also. She joined us, she called herself the fourth sister. So she -- she\njoined us and we tried to organize a kind of a life. Uncle Alexander was a man of means,\nso he was able to secure some money. He had a lot of hidden assets, liquid assets, money\nand such, but he also had real estate. And he rented a very lovely apartment -- large\napartment, so now we lived in the apartment, both my sisters, Hanya - Anna and Krisha -\nKris went to work and I signed up for school and I was the one to keep house. And was a\nvery interesting period of my life, because you see, I actually didn\u2019t finish elementary\nschool, you see? But, because I was taught, right through the ghetto tie -- time, which\nwas seven days a week, 10 hours a day, I knew French and I knew Latin and I knew\ngrammar and I knew history and I read Tolstoy and -- and I did all these things, which I\nwould never have done, except the books were in the house and that\u2019s what we studied\nfrom. And my sister Hanya, being the best teacher I ever had, which, it\u2019s a fact. I had this\nfantastic education, which I -- it wasn\u2019t even qualif -- qua -- classified, you know? If you\nask me -- so I went to high school and ask me, \u201cWhat grade?\u201d So there was this high\nschool, so everybody said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re 15 now, 16, you have to go to high school, but,\u201d\n-- so I came and say, \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d And I told them I studied this and I said --\nthey said, \u201cFine.\u201d They put me in the second grade of high school, you see? And I was\nkeeping house. We lived very nicely because of Uncle Alexander. And we can still\nregistering, but we found out there\u2019s nothing for us any more, to hope for.",
        "Q: Was that a school established by a Jewish agency, or was it --",
        "A: No, this was a Polish high school in Lodz, Polish high school. There were a lot of kids\nin my situation who were -- whose education was interrupted. And they had all kinds of\nprofessors who were floating around, university professors and everybody, who was\nwilling to teach. And we lived -- yes, I picked up as if not -- as if I really belonged there.\nI really, truly fit right in. I really fit right in. And my two sisters worked and we lived\nwith uncle and Kris met Miles, Miles Lehrman, her husband and very soon my older\nsister, Hanya was -- she got engaged to Adrian and she went to Warsaw to study\ndiplomac-diplomacy in the school of diplom -- Polish diplomacy. And she left for\nWarsaw and he left with her, soon after. And I stayed on. Kris got married. I went to high\nschool. We had a very good life in -- in Lodz, in the sense that it was sort of like catching\nyour breath, you know? First of all, we really, finally were able to find out -- to make\nconnection as to what happened, who -- we knew that the family perished, but we still\ndidn\u2019t know who or how or when or what or anything. We found out for sure that mother\nwent to Treblinka. We found out for sure that father perished in October, in 1944, in\nAuschwitz, for sure.",
        "Q: How did you find that out?",
        "A: Through -- because we met people in Lodz from our hometown, who were together\nwith my father in Auschwitz. They even gave us October as the date, you see, in\nAuschwitz. October, \u201844. And we tried to find out about Babcha Tannenblume and about\nBabcha Laks. And we did not know about my cousin Anja. But we know that Babcha\nLaks family -- her family was gone. We just didn\u2019t hear about Anja and then one day\nAnja showed up in -- in Lodz. And she stayed with us. And that was wonderful. And then\nwe didn\u2019t know about the Tannenblume side of the family, where they were. As I told\nyou, nine children. So, we found out specifically that Babcha Tannenblume and her\ndaughter Regina, with her husband whom she married during the war and the daughter\nAnja most definitely went to Treblinka with the Austroviets Jews, no question about it.\nAnd my aunt from Danzig, who was shipped to Austroviets with her husband. Rachella.\nShe and her husband were together with Babcha, they all went. Now, my aunt from\naround Lublin, the one that had those two -- two sons, engineers, they studied in\nBelgium. Whether or not they came home before th-th-the war, because the Belgian Jews\nwere killed just as badly as the Polish Jews. So the two cousins -- the two engineers,\neither got killed in Belgium or they got killed in Poland. Either way, they didn\u2019t survi-\nsurvive. Their mother and father, Kronenburg, Aunt Fella Kronenburg and her husband.\nThey were very well-to-do, they lived on an estate around Lublin. They -- they perished.\nThe only question was always that pharmacist. My mother\u2019s youngest daught -- sister.\nThe pharmacist who went to Wamsha, who got the job right before the war. And that is a\nmystery to this day. I mean, the others are also a mystery, because how can you really\ntell? But we know that they went with the general auseedlung -- with the general\nshipment of Jews, so we know to place them that way. But my aunt who lived, who had\nthose two sons, whether they perished in Belgium or whatever. They would have found\nus, or we would have found them, but nothing happened after the war. And they never\nregistered anywhere. And the one from Wamsha, that pharmacist, that we never knew\nwhat happened to her, so this is what -- we made the connection, sort of to finalize it, you\nknow. Because you cannot go through life forever being surrounded by mysteries. Now\nthings were coming out in the open, about what really, truly happened. And it was\nincomprehensible. And to look for individuals, that was totally out of the question, but to\nlook for people who were part of a group was easier because genocide was predicated on\nmass murder, you see? So if you were in the Austroviets group, you went to Treblinka. If\nyou were in the Starachowice group, you went to Treblinka. You see, if you were in\nanother group, you went to Majdanek or Beljets. Like Miles Lehrman\u2019s family. They\nperished in Beljets, because he comes from that part of Poland, you see? Near Beljets. So,\nyou could actually bring it to -- not to resolve it, but to bring it around to a finality where\nit puts your soul at ease, that this is what happened, you see? And so the -- the war turned\nout th-that of my mother\u2019s family, the only survivors, except for the brothers that were in\nCanada, were the three of us. Of all the cousins and the aunts and everybody else, the\nthree of us. And of my father\u2019s side, only c-cousin Anja and Uncle Alexander and with\nhis wife and the two sons, of c -- who of course survived, but not inside th -- inside of\nPoland. So, but life in Lodz was very interesting, because we kept running into all kinds\nof people coming back. And we lived -- Uncle Alexander saw to it that we lived a good\nlife and I -- now we lived in a nice apartment and -- and we even had a maid. And I still\ndid the marketing and I still did the cooking and I went to school. And Kris was working\nand Hanya was in Warsaw. And Kris got herself engaged to Miles and then we had a\nwedding in -- in the apartment and with -- I did the catering. We did the whole wedding\nourselves. It was good fun, I -- to this day when I talk about it, people laugh, because oh,\nwe had all that stuff bringing in and shipping in and all kinds of -- with gild -- geese and\nwe had the roast goose and we had the -- all these thing -- was a very, very lovely\nwedding. That was Christmas time. And right after the wedding, Uncle Alexander went\nto Sweden, because his wife -- while we were in Radsoff, after Auschwitz, she didn\u2019t go\nour route. I don\u2019t think she went to Ravensbrick, I don\u2019t know. Anyhow, she winded up\nin a small camp not far from Radsoff. And she was so deathly ill when the war -- war\nended, that the Swedish Red Cross was taking all these terribly sick people up to Sweden.\nAnd she was in the hospital and when she got well, she stayed on as a -- as a nurses m --\nhelp. So, Uncle Alexander went to meet her there and they found out that the sons\nsurvived, went through Palestine. My aunt -- my uncle\u2019s wife had family in Isra -- in\nPalestine. So, when the two sons came via Russia 1n the unders army. And the unders\narmy, you know, was traveling through the Middle East. When they came out of -- this is\nalso a historical framework. When Stalin made the pact with Shikorski -- what year was\nthat? During the war, whatever. And he agreed to let Polish military leave to -- to join the\nallies, the western allies. The -- Jews were not alla -- left out, but some Jews did go out.\nAnd they traveled through Teheran into Palestine and from there to England, you see?\nSo, my two cousins met in Palestine, because in Tel Aviv was my Aunt Rose\u2019s sister.\nAnd they met there, quite by chance. And then they went to England, then they both were\nin British uniform, fighting for the allies, til the end of the war. And Uncle Alexander\nstayed in Sweden and we eventually, in early \u201846, left Poland for Berlin. We meaning\nKrisha and Miles and myself. Because Hanya was already engaged to Adash. And she\u2019s\nlive -- she was waiting to finish her -- her studies. And we went to Berlin and --",
        "Q: Why to Berlin?",
        "A: You see, that I cannot tell you, but Miles was now my guardian, you see? He married\nKrisha and I said, \u201cWell, now you have a wife and you don\u2019t need a fifth wheel into the -\n- to the wagon,\u201d you know? He said, \u201cNo, no, no. That\u2019s not how the way it\u2019s going to\nwork.\u201d In fact when he got engaged to Krisha, he gave me a present, a fountain pen. I\nloved plants, so he gave me a plant and to it was attached a fountain pen. It was -- 1n fact,\nwas my birthday and he was just engaged to Krisha, whatever, so this was my birthday\npresent, a fountain pen with the plant. He said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to work\nit, that until you get married, you\u2019ll stay with us.\u201d I was trying very hard not to be a\nburden, you know, in any way. But they were both very busy. He was working, she was\nworking. Somebody had to run the house. I knew nothing about cooking, but I learned.\nSo when somebody, you know, I\u2019m supposed to be a good cook, so they say, so when\nthey say it in front of Miles, says, \u201cYou know, Renia is a pretty good cook.\u201d He says,\n\u201cSure she\u2019s a good cook, she learned on my stomach.\u201d To this day, he says, \u201cThank me,\ndon\u2019t thank her. She learned on my stomach.\u201d Because I really don\u2019t know any kind of\ncooking, much, you know. So was -- was from the imagination, but I did learn to cook,\nbecause I was trying very hard. I did the marketing, you know and I -- so I truly, I -- I --\nit\u2019s apropof marketing, no but that\u2019s a sideline, [indecipherable] keep it. That\u2019s another\nstory. Well, anyhow, when we went to -- coming back to the question. Miles was very\nmuch in touch with all the eng -- returning refugees, the people from the camps and\nfriends. I think he had some kind of a cousin in Berlin. And somebody said, \u201cIf you go to\nBerlin, there\u2019s a DP camp.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere am I going find a DP camp?\u201d They said --\nhe said he has a cousin. \u201cYou have the address, you go to the cousin and then you --.\u201d So\nwe did go to Berlin. We left Poland and that was a surreptitious kind of an operation,\ncause you\u2019re not allowed. Was called th-the green border. Because you know, the old\nernissa border was not yet established in 1945. No, this early \u201846. It was sort of fluid,\nbecause it wasn\u2019t Germany, but yet 1t was Germany, and whatever. We went from -- we\nwent to Stettin and from Stettin to Berlin. And in Berlin, we found his cousin and before\nlong, we moved into the DP camp. And of course from my viewpoint, this was just the\nhappiest of all happenings, because here in Berlin, the DP camp was run by -- basically\nby the Jewish agencies again. However, I think it had a big -- well, Palestine was\ninvolved a lot in this whole set-up, because we had Palestinian -- you had Jews from\nPalestine, from -- which is Israel in British uniform and I think they were trying to find\nout how reset -- how people were going to be resettled. Anyhow, the school was formed\nvery shortly before I got there. I got there in March or so of 1946. There was a school\nform -- how do you form a school when you have all ages and all backgrounds and\neducational backgrounds. You know, there were kids 13 years old who already had a\nhigh s -- college diplo -- college equivalent and there were kids 13 years old who didn\u2019t\neven finish second grade, you know? This type. I will have to show you the picture,\nbecause I still have a group picture from that school. They went -- whoever they were,\nwhether it was the Jewish agencies or the Palestinian who -- pal -- they -- they -- Jews\nfrom Palestine, they -- they -- whoever it was, the camp was absolutely set up to rescue\nthe children from their experiences, you see? It was about education, no question about it,\nbut it was also about restoring childhood, you see? That was the crux of the program. We\nhad our own mess hall, for bre -- for lunch. We had break from school. Now, let me\nbacktrack. This was a school in the Hebrew language. Everything was taught in Hebrew.\nI had my little bit of a Jew -- Hebrew background from my Tarbud school as a child, but\ncertainly not prepared to study Hebrew in -- in -- chemistry in Hebrew, you know,\nbecause this -- this is like -- I had a -- a -- a distance of a million miles. But one way or\nanother, we all fitted in. They had the little kids together, little kids and I was assigned to\nwhat they called the high school group. That was the oldest group. And of course the\nlittle kids had special treats, but we were totally s -- treated like -- like teenagers with a\nlife, whatever that means. We had a separate mess hall. Our food was much better. You\nknow, there were mess halls for the community. Our food was much better. We were\ngiven special rations of chocolate. We were having a very, very tender, considerate\nsupervision of life. We had dances, we went to dances. I have pictures to this day from\ndances. We had excursions into Berlin proper. Went to the opera. We had likebaumer, we\nhad picnics. Out of the camp, we had performances, we performed and we went to\nperformances. Mayor LaGuardia -- mayor of New York, LaGuardia was the unrah. This\nwas an unrah camp also, you know. Mayor LaGuardia came to visit and we were sa --\nreciting poetry for him, you know, the -- all the group. And I foun-formed many\nfriendships, some of them lasting to this day, from that period.",
        "Q: Where in Berlin was that?",
        "A: Schlackenza.",
        "Q: And how many children, about, in that camp? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I have the album. When I started, the group was maybe 40, 50 people, when I --\nand by the time I left, it was more like 300. \u2019Il show you. I have two pictures and this is\nonly within one year, don\u2019t forget. And after I left, there were more friends of mine that\nwere left behind, and the school really grew. And we had all kinds of -- we had th-the\nsoccer games being played, that we were watching or playing, you know, whatever.\nEvery effort was made to bring us around. The other -- the grown-ups didn\u2019t do much,\nbut there were dances, we all went to dances. And I used to do a lot of things privately\nwith Kris and Miles Lehrman. We used to go down to the opera, we used to do other\nthings. Went to see -- to the theater.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t it difficult for you to go back to Germany, in a sense?",
        "A: Well, you see, I was in Germany, but I wasn\u2019t in Germany. I was in camp. I didn\u2019t\nknow anything about Germany. You see, I -- to me the German language in Poland was\nthe same as the German language in Radsoff or Ravensbriick or Auschwitz. Except\nStarachowice was in Polish territory and Radsoff was on German territory. I didn\u2019t have\nany -- either access or -- or connection to the outside, except to the guards, to the SS and\nto the Gestapo. And then to the women. Most of the time -- most of the time my\nconnection was all to the sold -- male. But Radsoff I had th-the women. But that was\nreally dealing more with the language, you see. They represented Germany, but I -- I was\nin Germany, but I didn\u2019t know I was in Germany, I could have been on the moon. In a\ncamp on -- you know, a camp -- a concentration camp on the moon. So that when I came\nto the DP camp in Germany, I was again, sort of, in but not in. I was physically in the\ncamp, but there was no connection to Berlin, except we -- I have all kinds of pictures I'll\nshow you, from Berlin. Berlin was bombed out, we used to go out to Couferstindam. I\nhave the church, the old church in Couferstindam that was demolished, I have it in the\nback of my head there, when I have a picture taken, but th-that Germany was nothing in\nthe context of what we\u2019re talking about, cause this was post-war Germany and there were\npeople from all over, because -- don\u2019t forget 1946, you still have droves of people\npassing through. The -- the -- the movement of people west and east, because everybody\nwas dislocated. So the Berlin that you talk about isn\u2019t really Berlin, a German Berlin. It --\nit was German, but it wasn\u2019t German, but as far as the camps are concerned and as far as\nthe DP camp is concern, I wasn\u2019t in Germany. I was, but I wasn\u2019t, really. You see? And\nthen we left th -- January, we left the DP camp. And I have to show you my report card,\nall excellents. Top to bottom. You know, I reread it in preparation, I wanted to show it to\nyou. I s -- I see the subjects, literature and chemistry and one 1s geography of Palestine --\nis the entry, one entry. I have excellents top to bottom and I was given that gift, here,\nwith an inscription. This says, \u201cSpeak Hebrew.\u201d And this is a silver pin I was given and it\nsays -- inscribed with the date on the back and says, \u201cAs a souvenir from class\nkeetadialit.\u201d\u201d And signed Berlin and the date and I keep it to this day. It\u2019s a precious gift. I\nwas given this and th-the certificate, the report card and we left for Bremenhafen.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number four, side A. Before we move on, I just have one\nfollow up question to the experience of being in the DP, 1n the --",
        "A: DP camp?",
        "Q: DP camp, yeah. That was sort of the first time, really, that you were together with\nyour peers, girls and boys, or I mean -- in a relaxed -- in a normal kind of -- of interactive\nway. Was that difficult for you to relate to boys, for instance, or was it --",
        "A: No, not at all. Because you see, I have already lived a kind of a normal life in Poland.\nAs soon as we got settled and -- and uncle was around and then Miles Lehrman came on\nthe scene, we had a life of -- of seeing people, meeting people, going out, going -- you\nknow, doing things th-that I -- I found myself to be a grown up, though I knew that there\nwas a big gap left yet, to be filled. But it didn\u2019t bother me, because you see, when you\nlive with so many people, though the circumstances of the camps, the -- the -- the\nshifting, the going and th-the mixing up with nationalities -- it makes you, or it made me\nvery free with everybody, you see? I wasn\u2019t shy and I wasn\u2019t reserved and I wasn\u2019t\nsuspicious and I wasn\u2019t cynical. I haven\u2019t lived yet, I wanted to live, you know? Anybody\nwas wonderful, everybody was wonderful. Everybody I met was great. And -- and no\nmatter whether it was a lady or a man or a boy or a girl and that attitude, when I came to\nBerlin, of course th -- in Poland already, I went to high school, but you know there, I --\nprobably in that high school, I was more set on the academic achievement because I\nreally needed to place myself academically, you see? To -- to -- to -- to categorize myself,\nto see how do I fit in academically? But once I came to Berlin and everything was so\nmixed up and I didn\u2019t have to prove myself academically and ev -- and they were going\nout of their way to -- to -- to make us feel that we\u2019re children still, you see? That really\ndid it. That really did it, because I was sort of pretending I was grown up when I was in\nPoland and I was accommodating myself and I was adjusting, but here I was just a child\nand it was perfectly fine and I got chocolate for it. So, you see, that really was the so-\ncalled smoothing over. And when we came to America, now then my child -- not my\nchildhood, but my young life really started. And as I told you, we -- Kris and Miles\ndecided they were going to be my guardians until I get married. So, obviously, when they\nhad their papers made, Miles had an old aunt living in New York, who left Poland at the\nturn of the century, you know? And she was a very old lady and she lived in -- on the\nlower east side. So Miles secured papers for us to come to America. They were going to\nbe our sponsors, meaning this old aunt with the husband. And Krisha and Miles and I\nwent via Bremenhafen on the marine perch, which was a converted transpor -- trans --\ntroop transport that they used for refugees living -- leaving Europe. We live -- arrived in\nAmerica February 11th, 1947 and they picked us up on the -- on the -- at the boat and\nthey took us to their home and they were living on the lower east side and I -- I nev -- ina\nwalk-up, it was really amazing, you know, cause this was still the old Jewish section. The\nold immigrants. And they were totally amazed that we were sort of dressed well and we\nhad cameras and we spoke languages. And they left Poland, they ask [indecipherable]\nyou know, they left Poland at the turn of the century. The old lady showed me how to put\non the electricity. And there was a little toilet with ush -- with the -- no -- chain. So she\ntook me 1n the toilet to show me how to flush the toilet. And, of course I was very\nappreciative, I didn\u2019t really want to show her that really Poland -- the Poland I left 1s not\nthe Poland she left, you know. And anyhow, we stayed on the lower east side, maybe day\nor two and then we moved to Brooklyn. And again, we did what we did in -- in Lodz.\nKris and Miles went -- they -- they got jobs and I went to school. And I did the cooking\nand the shopping, we lived together. And again I was learning on Miles\u2019s stomach. And I\nwent to Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn. Lived in Crown Heights,\nSchenectady Avenue. I think the number was 241, if I remember. Well, whatever. It was\na walk-up and on the second floor. We lived in Brooklyn and again, by a very, very lucky\nchance, I found myself in Jefferson High School, even though in those days, you had to\ngo to a high school that was in your district and this was a little bit out of my district. But\napparently there was a group of refugee children, that was being organized into a special\nprogram. And the Jewish agency in New York, the Joint Distribution Committee, for\nwhich we were also, we were -- we registered with them. In fact, Kris and Miles found an\napartment by going to the Joint Distribution and they gave them an address. They had\norganized that group, the Joint Distribution Committee, or whoever. I -- the Joint\nDistribution didn\u2019t organize the group, they send me to Jefferson High School, to --\ntelling me that there is a group there and indeed there was. The principal of the high\nschool was Ludwig Karpen. His wife was president of international ORT, O-R-T. He -- I\ndon\u2019t know how the project was set up or whatever. By the time I came, there were a\ntotal of us, about 35 kids, war survivors, fr -- fr -- of every background, academically and\notherwise, from Hungary, from France, from Poland, from Germany. You name it, they\nwere there. And we were going to be tested and incorporated into different grades, but we\nhad what they set up to call basic English class. Basic English class was basically a\norientation class. The head of the department, who ba -- who I\u2019m -- was very fond of, she\nbecame my best friend, til she died a couple of years ago, Agnes Hay. She was head of\nthe English department and she was the head of this project. We met every day, one\nperiod in that special class, for orientation toward Americanization, toward life, towards\nha -- customs, see what customs, how do you greet people and how do you don\u2019t greet\npeople and how you shake hands or you don\u2019t shake hands and -- and you know, and we\nwere placed, for example, I was placed in two English grades. For example, they gave me\nthe test in history, they saw that I knew history up to the first war, like I know my name.\nNapoleon and all, I knew it, this was all stuff. I go-got credit for it. I don\u2019t know -- know\nAmerican history, so I had to study that. I had to study speech, definitely. I had to take\neconomics and this, you know, th-th-the s -- level was very much higher than in the high\nschool. And I met all these wonderful kids who were from all over and who were like I\nwas -- eager to do well in school, eager to -- to excel, to be ac -- they were accepted into\nthe academic background, most of us had an idea of going on to college and of course Dr.\nKarpen saw to it that we were propibliat -- properly assigned to classes, so that when we\nfinally graduated, we absolutely had the -- all the requirements covered, you see?",
        "Q: So it was basically a special program within an ordinary American high school?\nThat\u2019s what it was?",
        "A: Yes it was, right. And when we did graduate, eventually -- in fact I got a scholarship\nfrom the educa-educational foundation for Jewish girls, because I was heading for\ncollege. I graduated with honors as a matter of fact, from Thomas Jefferson High School,\nas many others did as well. We were excellent students. The reason is that we really knew\nit all -- we didn\u2019t know it in English that well. You see, my English was sort of shaky, but\nwhen we first came to America, we started going to night school, Kris and Miles and I\nwent to night school. I went to Jefferson in the day school -- in the day time and we came\nin February, I went to high school. About March I went to summer camp, you see? By\nrecommendation, again. To summer camp in the summer, by the time I came back from\nsummer camp, my English was good enough to be in high school. So that I had no -- you\nknow, my la-language was not a problem any more. And we were mixed in with the high\nschool population and that was a very fine, very academically high, very good school and\na lot of kids went to college from that high school. Now, it\u2019s really very bad, this high\nschool is very bad, I\u2019m telling you. There are a few very bad high schools in New York,\nthis 1s it. When I -- Jefferson -- when I tell a few people that I graduated from Thomas\nJefferson High School, they faint. They faint. \u201cYou went to Jefferson?\u201d Well, when I\nwent to Jefferson, Jefferson was not what it is today. It was a very fine academic high\nschool. Danny Kaye went there, way before I did. Shelly Winters. To this day she\u2019s very\n-- this was -- the Gershwin lived around the -- the perimeter of Jefferson High School,\nthis was east New York, which is near Brownsville, in Brooklyn. And that was a -- a blue\ncollar Jewish neighborhood when I came in and the school had very high academic level\nbecause all these kids were what you call eager beavers, you know. To get out of the -- of\nthe working class, you know, Alfred Kazan and all the writers and all kinds of important\npeople came out. They went through this -- living in that area and they broke out to\ngreater things. Now, when I came to Jefferson, that was more or less the tempo of it, you\nknow, you carried on.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one more question, maybe. Were you encouraged at all to speak about\nyour war experience, either in that particular program or even in -- in [indecipherable]?",
        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact, 1f I showed you some of these ar -- newspaper clippings,\nthe head of the Hebrew dep-department was Dr. Horowitz, Edward Horowitz. He was, as\na matter of fact, you know the Jewish matzah people, the Horowitz matzah people? He\nwas one of those Horowitz\u2019s, very well-to-do family. He had a PhD in Hebrew or\nwhatever. He was the head of the Hebrew department and I took Hebrew as a foreign\nlanguage, because I came out of a Hebrew school and his class was the very good class\nfor me to get oriented to other things than Hebrew lessons. To the way the school runs,\nthe requirements, all these things I could get from hi -- from -- in that class in Hebrew,\nyou see? And he took a great liking to all the -- he had a few of these kids. He took a\ngreat liking to me. I was in his school and when they found out that I had a birthday\ncoming, my 18th birthday, they gave me -- he gave me a party in his house. He invited\nthat Hebrew class. And somehow or other, he got these newspaper people to come and\ninterview me in -- in Jefferson. And one of them -- he told them that I have a number and\nthe other -- one of the -- from the New York Post, I think, he told me to show me the\nnumber -- to show him the number and for me to sit there while he took the picture,\nwhich I have to this day, pointing at my number. I found it very stupid. What was this\nthing -- what was so important about the number? You know, I -- I don\u2019t -- ah, he wants\nto know, probably Horowitz told him, but I didn\u2019t care, you know? And over there,\nnobody talked about those things. That was past and that was then and now is now and\nwe were very busy. First of all, the idea of -- th -- Americanization was a totally different\nconcept than it is now, you know\u201d? The ethnicity of things did not -- was -- wa -- wa -- did\nnot take priority. I\u2019m telling you, when he told me to pull my sleeve up and point to the\nnumber, th-the photographer from the Post, I did that, but I felt [indecipherable] this\nguy\u2019s stupid. I mean, why does he need that for? Ah, he want it, let him have it. And I\nhad a wonderful party and they gave me presents and we sung and I was so moved\nbecause that was really the first time that I was really celebrated for myself, you know?\nAnd by then I was rather well established in -- as a good student in the school, in\nJefferson, you see? So that I -- I didn\u2019t feel below anybody -- anybody American or\notherwise. I really felt on the level. I felt I -- I could just stand very proudly about -- feel\nthat way about myself. And, as I said, came time to go to college, you know? The school\nhelped us to -- we didn\u2019t know about applications and things and such. Dr. Karpen saw to\nit that most of us picked Brooklyn College, because that was the next step, you know.\nFrom Brooklyn, to go to Brooklyn College, since that was that free institution, we didn\u2019t\nhave the funds. So he -- the school helped us, applications and our records went in. We\nwere very good -- I say we, that group, were excellent students. In fact where -- when I\nfirst walked in to Brooklyn College, to one of the class, somebody cracked a joke, \u201cOh\nno, she\u2019s here again. We have to work.\u201d I mean in an outburst, you know, because they\nknew that I worked so very hard. I really did. But, anyhow, the Jefferson High School\nsaw to it that all the kids that wanted to go to Brooklyn College did so. There was no\nquestion about going out of town, because who had the funds? I lived with Kris and\nMiles. Meanwhile, I did go to Brooklyn College, but Kris and Miles -- Krisha and Miles\ndecided to move to New Jersey. But I did not want to miss the opportunity now, you see?\nSo I stayed behind and I had a scholarship from the educational foundation. I stayed with\nfriends, I lived with a family and they moved to New Jersey. And I was in Brooklyn\nCollege, about a drop over a year and I had, of course the -- some of these Polish, one of\nmy very good friends, Sonia, who 1s no longer alive -- she committed suicide, as a matter\nof fact, I told you, at age 39. There was a woman whose life was -- she had a PhD in\nEnglish and everything. But the war really made her a very unhappy person and totally\nunfit for really living. But that\u2019s another story. Anyhow, Sonia and I were in the --\ntogether in Brooklyn College, we came together out of Jefferson. She came to Jefferson a\nfew months before I did. And she was an orphan, left without any family at all. And she\nlived in orphanages and such. She had a rough life. She lived in the woods with the\npartisans and -- anyhow, when we found ourselves in Jefferson High School with -- in\nBrooklyn College together, we took about the same courses. We had such fun, because\nwe had to take all the requirements, which there was more of them -- then than now.\nPolitical science and we had a fantastic time. But every time we went home together, we\nspoke Polish. And I had a professor, his name was Felix Gross and he taught European\ntheory -- European political theory and I loved that. I -- I was very interested in history,\nalways and I was so -- now I was eager to find out -- you know, I was in the war and I\nwas -- as I always keep saying, in the eye of the storm, which is how it was. But my\nknowledge of the war was strictly on personal experience, but the wider picture was\neluding me, because I really didn\u2019t know and then I got so busy living, I didn\u2019t have the\ntime to find out. So now I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to really go after the historical aspect of how\nthe things happen.\u201d And he was teaching political -- European political history, or\nsomething like that. And he had an accent, but a lot of professors had accent, because\nthere were a lot of Jewish professors who left Europe in the 30\u2019s and this was only the\n40\u2019s, you see? Actually, this was \u201849 -- 1949. So one day -- so we saw him on the\nsubway, Sonia and I would go home and talk, you know, girl talk on the subway and talk\naway and talk. And then I used to notice that he used to sort of look at me peculiarly, but\nhe didn\u2019t say anything. He heard me in th -- I mean I -- I didn\u2019t know who he was. So one\nday, I\u2019m in another class and I get a note, Professor Gross has to see me immediately. I\nsaid -- in his office, he\u2019s waiting. Excuse me. I absolutely didn\u2019t know what happened.\nImmediately, out of the class, I have to go to see him. So I go to see him, I said, \u201cI\nreceived your message.\u201d He says, \u201cYes. I know that you speak Polish very well and you\nare going to accept a job teaching Polish at the Indiana University.\u201d I looked at him like\nhe fell off a tree. So I said, \u201cHow did you know that I speak Polish and that I speak Polish\nwell?\u201d He says, \u201cI hear you talk to your friends on the subway. On the --.\u201d Well, I\npractically wanted to kill myself that minute. I thought that was the end of everything.\nMy embarrassment, because you know, we were talking all this girl talk and the boy talk\nand he sat there and I didn\u2019t know he knew. Well, after I got over the embarrassment and\nI said, \u201cI -- what do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cI know you can do it and I know you\u2019re\nPolish, so you absolutely are the person, because they look -- they are looking for an\ninstructor who is a native and who had a back -- good -- very good, thorough European\nbackground. And you have that and you have the ability and you\u2019re going to go. And you\nhave to go downtown Manhattan to be interviewed.\u201d It was like a ton of bricks, and I\nsaid, \u201cWell, you know, I -- I can\u2019t go have a job there, I -- I got into college, I want to\nfinish college.\u201d He says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I already spoke to the -- to the head of the\ndepartment that they will adapt their schedule to your hours so that you could graduate\nchut.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to put over my graduation.\u201d I said, \u201cI have already\nlost so many years and now I\u2019m finally catching up and fitting in and I wouldn\u2019t want to\nleave Brooklyn College and get dragged out again for how long.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, no, no.\nEverything will be arranged. You have to go.\u201d I called my sister and Miles and I told\nthem, \u201cListen, I have this offer, what do I do? And he\u2019s pira -- he\u2019s pushing me here and I\nalready have an appointment.\u201d I went and I met this Professor Seebeeac. He was ahead of\nthe linguistics department at Indiana University. And he told me that they have now\nestablished a language center in Bloomington -- Bloomington, Indiana. And they -- this is\nnow the Cold War, you know, this is 1950. It\u2019s -- the Cold War is on. They need higher\nmilitary personnel. H-Higher ranked military personnel behind the Iron Curtain and they\nhave to know -- they have to be taught. And so I told him the same thing, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t\ntake a job, because I have to finish my studies.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You'll teach three hours a\nday and in the summer if you want to stay, you\u2019ll teach six hours a day.\u201d I said, \u201cFine.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWhat about writing -- what about the textbook?\u201d He says, \u201cWe'll write a\ntextbook.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s going to take m -- .\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cdon\u2019t worry.\u201d Lo and\nbehold, this is what happened, I went downtown, Manhattan, the old Barbizon Pla-Plaza\nHotel on Central Park West -- Central Park South, I was hired and within -- with a week I\nwas packed and he s -- waited at the railroad station for me. When I came -- I came by\nrailroad, Penn Station to -- to Bloom -- to Indianapolis. He was waiting for me. He got\nme into the housing office for regist -- I was asked whether I want to live alone, or in the\nsorority or what -- I said, \u201cNone of that, I want to live in the -- in the dormitory because I\nreally want to mix with people. I -- I am a people pe -- person.\u201d They asked me my\nreligion, which I was amazed about. They asked me if I would mind to live with a black\ngirl and I was practically fell through the floor, I -- how dare they ask such a stupid\nquestion. I said, \u201cNo, I -- I would live with anybody.\u201d I mean, listen -- look -- look where\nI came from, you know? I should now have prejudices yet, on top of where I come from?\nSo everything was arranged exactly as I wanted, meaning he helped me register, transfer\nmy courses, which were applicable because it was all academics. I didn\u2019t have any bean\nbag courses, you know. I had to -- he arranged housing. I -- I lived in a dormitory. He\narranged courses. Transfer of courses. I went -- I picked the courses that would fit. I\ntaught three hours a day and one professor from the linguistics department de-de-decided\nto write a book. And wa -- he -- I helped out with the exercises and such. And who -- the\npeople I was teaching, I had -- how many people did I have? Six or eight in the class.\nThese were Air Force officers. They were older than I was, of course. They were fantastic\npeople and to this day I\u2019m very friendly with them. We correspond through the years.\nThey were trained to be attach\u00e9\u2019s and such and you know, they had to know the\nlanguage. We taught grammar too, but basically there was -- half of it was conversation.\nAnd I[ had to write the conversation patterns. In other words, I picked the subject. And\nthey had to follow what I had to say and tell me -- we had a real conversation. In other\nwords, I had to judge how much of what I was -- I could pick any subject. I could talk\nabout the railroads, I could talk about love, I could talk -- I never talked about camp.\nNever, never, never. This was a totally different picture now. Meanwhile, before I left\nBrooklyn, I met Victor, my husband. And while -- he was drafted into the army, because\nthis was the Korean War -- he was drafted and meanwhile I got that offer. And so, when I\nwas in Indiana, he was in the army. And so he would come and visit me in Indiana. And\nthat\u2019s another very interesting story, because 1n those days, the dorm were not integrated.\nSo when Victor co -- used to come and visit me, he sat downstairs in the living room.\nYou know, the dorm had many rooms. When I tell it to my kids -- and there was curfew,\nI had to be back at 12 -- they said, \u201cYou allowed yourself -- you allowed them to do it to\nyou?\u201d What did they do to me? You know, this is ancient history. So Victor used to come\n-- he used to come in the uniform, because that was cheaper to travel as a uni -- you\nknow, as a -- as a military. He was stationed in Watertown, New York. No, not far from\nSt. Lawrence, which was by coincidence turned out year later as a school for Paul. But\nVictor was stationed there and I was in Indiana and I would stay on. We would meet. If I\ntook a trip, let\u2019s say for Christmas, to New York, then we would meet in New York. He\nworked in the headquarters in Watertown, New York, so he somehow managed to -- to\nget the time when I was there or he\u2019d come to Indiana and we had friends in Indianapolis,\nfrom Poland. So he would come to Indianapolis, I would come to Indianapolis and there -\n- he would stay -- we would visit with the f -- with our friends. And I had a very\nwonderful time in Indiana. That is really a very special time in my life, you know? I was\nalready academ -- I was first of all financially independent, totally. Because I was paid.\nThe courses I took, I did not have to pay the regular big fee, because instructors always\nhad a discount. I was earning enough to be truly independent, fully and enjoy and loving\nit. Loving the job, loving the company, loving the dormitory, loving the class, loving\neverything, including Bloomington, because New York I thought was Europe. You\nknow, it was like Professor Gross used to say, \u201cNew York 1s the last city -- when you\ncome from Europe to America, New York is the last European city. After that is\nAmerica.\u201d He used to say that. And I found it very true. So when I came to Bloomington\nand that was the midwest. And believe me, that was a different kind of place, too. As I\ntold you, I was asked to fill in my religion when I registered and I was asked whether I\nwould room with a black girl, with a Negro girl. So you could see those were different\ntimes. And -- however, this -- the -- the -- the whole ambiance of the place -- I took the\ncourses I loved and by the way, I took -- I ma -- I majored in social work. So my degree\nfrom Bloomington, from Indiana University is in social work. Even though I was an\ninstructor at the same time. And I met many wonderful friends, of course, again to this\nday. I keep on with everybody from -- you -- as I call my connection, my Indiana\nconnection or my Berlin connection, you know, my Jefferson connection, my Indiana\nconnection. I have a lot of friends. And it was a very exciting time, because I finally -- I\nthink it equalized for me, you know. My academic, my emotional, my physical, my all, it\nall came together, finally, you know? And I was beginning to feel very much at ease in\nAmerica. I knew English very well, ve done a lot of good things. And I\u2019ve traveled to\nCanada to visit my sister a lot and I was very attached to the Lehrman\u2019s, you know. Very\n-- | mean, we\u2019re such a close family, knock wood, to this day. I mean , we\u2019re just one.\nAnd the kids -- our kids are now their kids and -- and our kid\u2019s kid\u2019s and all the cousins,\nthat\u2019s just one, to this day. But Indiana was fantastic, 1t was rewarding, emotionally. It\nwas rewarding intellectually. It was most rewarding as a final -- it\u2019s a trite word,\nAmericanization -- but I was taken in to -- to what this life was. In other words, now --\nnot that I was done with Europe. You know, I can\u2019t be done with Europe, is like I can\u2019t\nbe done with my right hand, you know. But I finally got into the spirit of the country and\nof -- oh, I got involved and -- and -- and I already had my ideas of politics and all this. It\nreally, absolutely coalesced. It really got together. It -- it -- 1t formed into a -- a unit. And\nso that when Victor -- we were planning to get married, we got engaged, meanwhile. And\nwhen Victor was discharged from the army in January of \u201853, I was supposed to graduate\nin February, you know. In those days they graduated classes twice a year, February and\nJune. I was slated to graduate in February. So, Victor came for my graduation, I have\nlovely pictures from that time and all the girls friends that I had there. And we came back\nto New York and we got married in March of the same year. Because he was now free,\ntoo. He was free of the mel -- military. He certainly didn\u2019t want to be a military man, but\nhe had to. He was drafted, so he had to serve -- serve his time. And so we -- we got\nmarried and I didn\u2019t quite know whether I wanted to go into social work any more. You\nknow, I went -- I applied to Columbia for social work degree, PhD. But just about that\ntime, things began to be a little different -- or maybe it was different, New York was\ndifferent from Indiana. Over there, everything -- social work was still like -- they used to\ncall it welfare, you know. Welfare was very shameful. I remember one day in the class --\nI used to atte -- I used to -- I had cases, casework outside of my class. I had field work to\ndo. I had two cases. One was an old lady, was called Mrs. Wheeler. And another case\nwas a abandoned someb -- child or something like that. Anyhow, while they were\ndiscussing cases and I made a mistake and I said when I -- that Mrs. Wheeler -- I was\nstopped by the professor right then and there. She said, \u201cNever, ever, ever, ever must you\nmention the client by name. Never. Because this is very shameful to her to receive\nwelfare. That if you discuss cases, you have to keep on the professional level, without\nreference to name.\u201d I -- that was the -- th-the philosophy of welfare in those days was that\nyou can -- you are to help the person to help himself, but nothing -- not -- not to -- to\nprovide for him for a lifetime. I came to America and I went to Columbia to apply. I\ncame to America -- I came to New York and I went to apply to Columbia and they started\nb-briefing me on how the school is oriented and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not for me.\u201d This is a\nhandout. This is against my own principles, forget what I was taught at Indiana. You\nknow, this -- I remember Mitchell Ginsburg, I think was the name of the head of th-the\nsocial work school. I told acur, \u201cI don\u2019t think I belong there. I don\u2019t think Pll be happy\nthere. I can\u2019t see running programs to -- to -- to make people di -- di -- to -- to -- to live\non handouts.\u201d I mean, you know, I was poor enough in -- that we -- we didn\u2019t know\nwhere the next meal was coming cru -- from, if ever the meal will come from. And all the\nso-called schnoring, you know? It wasn\u2019t pit -- it wasn\u2019t shameful to -- to schnor for\nbread when you were starving. It was pitiful. And I would now work for an agency that\u2019s\ngoing to sa -- to -- to -- to -- to supply all the schnorer\u2019s of the world? Not for me. I\ndecided Ill wait a few years. I wouldn\u2019t go back to -- right away to social work. Then\nthey offered me jobs at the UN, I didn\u2019t want that. I really wanted -- really -- I was most\ninterested in setting up a life -- a married life, you see? I was so knocked around with so\nmany places and so many people. You know, after the Lehrman\u2019s moved to New -- to\nVineland, I lived with three families before I went to Indiana. I lived with one family and\nthen I moved to a girl\u2019s club. And that wasn\u2019t very good for me either, because there was\ntoo much commotion, I couldn\u2019t study. Then I moved with a -- another Jewish family\nfrom Poland that I knew, so that was okay. And then I moved to Indiana and I didn\u2019t yet\nhave, you know -- like when I lived with the Lehrman\u2019s, sure that was home, but it still\nwasn\u2019t what I really wanted -- to have a place of my own and to -- being self-supporting\nand doing -- being productive in a way that the life prepared me for. What was the use of\nall that education and everything, if I were not going to apply it to a normal life that\nwould finally go back to what I understand life to be, which is now a very old-fashioned\nconcept, you know. But to me, that was very important.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This it tape number four, side B. C-Could you maybe elaborate just a little\nbit more on the difficulty you had with the concept of welfare or social work that you\nencountered at that time?",
        "A: Yes. Well, you see, having been orphaned during the war, I had one idea in mind. I\nmust never be a burden to anybody. Not even to my sisters. They were my protectors,\nthey were my surrogate parents, they were my everything. I still was not going to be a\nburden. And it was so ingrained into me, that when I lived with the Lehrman\u2019s and I did\nthe cooking and the cleaning, I was thrilled. Because they were so good to me, they were\nsupporting me, but at least I was not a schnorer. You see, I was not somebody -- and later\non too, whatever it was that I did -- I babysat. I had a job one summer when I was in high\nschool as a governess, 25 do-dollars a week. Five weeks job, I bought myself a mouton\nfur coat, a warm mouton, it was a fur coat, quote unquote. I had jobs in -- in summer\ncamps as a governess, as a counselor. I babysat, I -- I worked -- when I was in high\nschool, I worked. I forgot to mention that. Dr. Karpen\u2019s wife -- or maybe I did mention it,\nwas the head of the ORT organization. I got a job in ORT, in the ORT office, main office\nin New York. 23rd Street and Madison Square and I was in Brooklyn. I used to go from\nhigh school, from Jefferson High School, on the subway an hour and a half to go to ORT\nto work and back, after school. And I came home and I had to cook and clean and I was\nmore than happy. Because -- and then I babysat and Is -- and I did everything I could --\nnot that the Lehrman\u2019s ever, ever, ever brought it up to me. If Krisha got a coat, I got a\ncoat. If Krisha got -- I was -- like Mile\u2019s said, I was going to be their charge and -- until I\nget married. And it exactly was like that. But before I was married, I already had this\nthing, because I was in the war and things were so hard and we were so poor and -- not\npoor poor, but we were so deprived of everything, that I said, when I\u2019m finally -- when it\nfinally happens, never will I be a burden. So, to connect all this -- this 1s personal\nphilosophy, that precedes anything before America, even. Then I come to America and I\nsee what the Jewish agencies do for people. Put them on their feet and let them go. I go to\nIndiana and it\u2019s about the same idea. You help people along, an old lady who 1s an old\nwidow, who must never -- nobody must -- should ever know her name. She\u2019s being held\nby a young intern, myself, to go and find out what she needs and so on and so forth, but\neverything is -- not in secrecy, but it should be done with dignity, you see? And then I\ncome to New York and I bump against this new concept, that they are explaining to me\nwhat this school idea 1s, of -- of educating social workers and how I\u2019m going to fit into it.\nAnd I see I am not going to fit into it.",
        "Q: What was it, though? What was the concept?",
        "A: The concept was -- you see, we are now talking about the mid -- th-the 50\u2019s, you see?\nThat there are too many poor people in this wor -- the America and they should be put --\nthey should be given things. There\u2019s so much goodness, because you know, America in\nthe 30\u2019s had the Depression. During the war, America brought itself out of the\nDepression, after, you know with the help of Franklin Roosevelt. In the 50\u2019s, this was a\nland of plenty. There was no war, there was prosperity and yet there were very many\npoor people. And the idea was to re-organize the society. I mean in schools of social\nwork, such as the New York school. Which I later found out he was a lidding -- leading\nliberal, I -- this head of the school, gee whiz. Well, anyhow, the idea was that now you\nhave to provide for the poor. But for me, to provide for the poor is not the way I saw\nsocial work. To me, helping the poor, is a way, but not -- it was more like Indiana, you\nsee? Where everything should be kept within very dignified -- welfare was a dirty word,\nyou know. Welfare in those days was -- they say, \u201cOh, she was on welfare.\u201d This type of\nthing was derogatory. In Indiana we had it pounded into our heads, you don\u2019t use word\nwelfare, you don\u2019t use the client\u2019s name. You -- you keep it as dignified, so that the least\npeople should know that this person is getting helped, which was aid to aged people and\nSO on, you see? So, to answer your question, I did not think that I was going to be very\nhappy in this school. Of course I could have applied to any other school of social work.\nBut I was really, basically interested in starting my own life, personal life. I said, \u201cGee\nwhiz, I already put in time for all those other things that were of importance to me. I\nfinally have the education, I finally feel myself equal to everybody else. I finally caught\nup within my own inner self, between the emotional and the intellectual and the m -- the\nmature. I already -- you know, because on one level I was very mature after the war was\nended and on another level I was totally 1ignoramus and stupid, probably. I was a kid and\n-- and it -- 1t just wasn\u2019t -- it didn\u2019t mesh yet. When I came out of Indiana and -- and we\ngot married, I really knew that I was already a person 1-1n my own right and it was time\nto really make a home for myself and -- and whatever I felt was going to be my family.",
        "Q: What kind of home and what kind of family did you want to have, did you build? Did\nyou want to have children? Did you want to --",
        "A: Oh yes, eventually I shoulds -- definitely would want to have children, but at first I\nwas just interested in not having another roommate. Like everybody said to me, \u201cHow\ndoes it feel to be married?\u201d I says, \u201cYou know what? You just live with the same\nroommate. I -- I\u2019ve lived with so many roommates now. This is just one more roommate,\nso I have no problem with that.\u201d Because it\u2019s true. By that time you have no idea, since\nwe came to America, how many roommates I had, you know? So I said, \u201cNo, Victor\u2019s\njust another roommate, so I don\u2019t have a problem with that. And we get along very well,\nwe love each other. So it\u2019s great.\u201d And it was, you see? And the type of home was to -- to\nestablish -- you know, I love company and I love to see people and to -- to have people\nover and to visit with people. Yeah, I\u2019m very people oriented person, so this is how I\nvisualized it and that\u2019s more or less how we started out.",
        "Q: Where did you start out? How --",
        "A: Well, we actually -- first we lived downtown in a hotel, for about two months, three\nmonths and then we moved up into this neighborhood in a smaller apartment. Victor\nworked downtown and we -- we lived here, on Cabrini Boulevard. On that street that\nfaces the river, but further down. And oh, we didn\u2019t -- now -- now we really lived a good\nlife. We traveled, we went to Bermuda for sort of a honeymoon, we went on vacation.\nWe went to places, we -- of course New York, to me, you know, I was away from New\nYork also. So now it\u2019s -- you know I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t have enough of it. Go to the\nmuseums and join this and do that and -- and it was -- we didn\u2019t have kids yet, not for\nthree years. So life was very good. Very, very good. And we eventually, when I became\npregnant with the first child, Victor said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to live in one bedroom\napartment and we\u2019re not going to wait til -- til we have to move after the baby\u2019s born,\nthen it\u2019s going to be much harder than it is now. And this building here was going up in\nthose years and he says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we stop and take a look?\u201d So we stopped and take a\nlook and we found this apartment, because it was just being finished. You know, the\nbuilding was just being ready for occupancy. So we moved in, I was still pregnant and\nthe first child was born -- not in this apartment, but you know, in the hospital and we\nlived here. Our older son Harry. And he -- he was born here when we were -- I don\u2019t\nknow, we moved around Thanksgiving and he was born in May, so we were about half a\nyear here when he -- and I used to go to -- Victor\u2019s family had the business and they had\nindustrial -- industrial cottons and I used to go to work in the business, before the babies\nwere born, because the children were born. So I helped out in the business for the first\nthree years. It was nicer to be around Victor all the time anyhow. And -- and I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to -- I didn\u2019t want to work at the UN. And I didn\u2019t -- certainly didn\u2019t want to go to -\n- to social work, not yet, until I really saw my way clear.",
        "Q: Why not the UN?",
        "A: You know, they were dealing with all kinds of things that I really didn\u2019t want to be --\nyou know, I broke away from everything, you, know? From the problems of wars, of\nresettlements, of all -- I wanted to live an American life, you know? I really wanted\nsomething, you know, like use the expression, \u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d I\u2019ve been in\nEurope, I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019ve done all the -- I had enough, I had enough of that. No UN for\nme, no. Yo -- subsequently, you know, when I became an -- and -- a translator, they\nwanted me. I could have had that job, because I have a lot of friends working there. No,\nbut going back to 1953, when we were married and we moved here, to Cabrini Boulevard\nand then we moved to this building, which is also on Cabrini, but one block up, next to\nthe park. And Harry was born.",
        "Q: When was your second child born?",
        "A: The second child, Paul, was born in -- four years later. So that in the first four years, I\nactually had a little hard time the first two years. I was so conscientious about everything,\nI didn\u2019t think I was doing a good job with the baby. I read a lot about -- I read about Dr.\nSpock in yesterday\u2019s paper, you know he died? So I read a lot Dr. Spock and he put me at\nease, because I didn\u2019t have family here, you see, and Victor\u2019s family wasn\u2019t in town\neither, they moved out. So, I was very -- I wasn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t well, physically. I had a hard\n-- hard childbirth and so on. But once I got over that, everything was fine and I started\ntaking courses. You know, school and me, that\u2019s one. I took -- first I took courses in the\nneighborhood. I studied Russian. Was a Mrs. Cherniak, she was a -- a retired teacher,\nRussian teacher, so we got together in group again, like in Poland during the war, there\nwere four of us, we\u2019re studying with Mrs. Cherniak. Then I went to the new school to\ncontinue the studies, the Russian studies. And of course we started having more friends\nand more going out and more, you know, a young couple. But after Harry was born, I\nstarted really more con-concentrating more on the -- on the personal fulfillment type of\nthing, you know. So I started taking courses. I went to Barnard. Then I took French\ncooking lessons. Then I did, you know, I took translation courses and all these and of\ncourse I would not leave the children to anybody, so I decided, until the children are talk\n-- older, I am not doing anything except bringing up children.",
        "Q: Did you have any particular ideas about how you wanted to bring these children up?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Absolutely. Had -- I had -- didn\u2019t have much to do with my war time\nexperiences. Basically, I wanted them to feel happy, that -- every mother wants that. I\nwanted them to ex-excel in school, which they did. By the way, I did a lot of volunteer\nwork while the kids were in school. They went to an public school, P.S. 187, which is\nnext door to us here. I was -- 11 -- for 11 years I was a head librarian, volunteer librarian.\nAnd then in Bronx High School of Science, when they both went to Bronx High School\nof Science, I was also very active. I was vice-president -- I never wanted presidency, not\nhere, not at -- nobody was going to get me to be president, nobody. And they tried. Vice-\npresident and chairman of the executive board at Bronx High School of Science. And we\ndid a lot of good things there. During the teacher\u2019s strike, you know, that protected the\nschool from being reorganized, but this is all academic stuff that is very important, but I\ndon\u2019t think it -- that it\u2019s very pertinent here. The point is that while the kids were growing\nup and we were very involved in the community, Victor was committee chairman for the\nBoy Scouts, both boys became Boy Scouts. Both are Eagle Scouts, by the way. Both\nHarry and Paul are Eagle Scouts. Harry, to this day is scoutmaster, every day. That\u2019s how\nhe comes here on Fridays, because he has a troop Boy Scouts here. Well, anyhow --",
        "Q: Is -- is your husband a Jewish American, or --",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, Jewish American, yes. His family originally came from Austro-\nHungary, but his father was already born in this country, so you know that he\u2019s third\ngeneration. His grandfather came to America in the 19th century, when he was a young\nman, I mean teenager, I think. And his mother\u2019s side, he has a grandmother who is buried\non Staten Island. As I told you, we go to cemeteries there. She was buried in 1886 in\nStaten Island. She was buried in \u201886, you see? So they go way back -- way, way back.\nBut -- no, w-we always were very compatible, no question about that. And he\u2019s Jewish\nand he\u2019s also of the -- not of the religious, which was important.",
        "Q: That was another question I had, you grew up in a very -- in a secular Jewish\nhousehold and that is still true for your own --",
        "A: Yes, we belong to the Reform Temple here. Our children were Bar Mitzvah and all\nthis and we -- we are still very good members of the Temple, we su -- we support the\nTemple financially, always, always. We go to -- we go to services dirs -- definitely on the\nhigh holidays. And Passover is very important. By the way, Passover is our community\ndinner again. We have the whole family get together. We have always the Lehrman\u2019s,\neverybody, all the kids and the grandkids and everybody, we have. That\u2019s annual. So --",
        "Q: Did you ever have that desire to go to Israel, since your mother was involved --",
        "A: Well, I was there just for a visit, as everybody else would go. It\u2019s another type of life\nand by the time I went there, you see, I was so swallowed up by American -- by America,\nby this new life. I imagine I would have been swallowed up in Israel too, because I was\nready, you know. I -- I couldn\u2019t wait to start normal living. You see, I -- normal --\nwhatever I call normal. To -- first of all, to be plugged into academics. And then to -- to\ndo the things that stimulate the brain and the -- you know, that -- and the thing is that --\nwhen I came to Israel, well, we already had grown children and I was already an\nAmerican in more ways than one and I have a lot of friends there, we visited all the\nfriends. Of course we went to Israel to visit Israel, which we did, too. But then I -- they\nwere so smart, one friend says to me, \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to have dinner in everybody\u2019s\nhouse every night, so that you wouldn\u2019t see Israel, so I invite --\u201d, she invited everybody.\nSo I saw ev -- all the friends from camp and such, all at one time and we traveled in Israel\nand saw a lot and was -- but I couldn\u2019t see my life away from this life any more, you see?\n[ -- I\u2019m really -- this is really -- this life is what I really want and what I -- you know, as --\nwhen the kids grew up, kids went to college, you know, both went to college and Harry\u2019s\na lawyer now, he went to law school and he\u2019s married and has two children, one is nine\nyear old and -- Max and then a new one was just born, last December.",
        "Q: Congratulations.",
        "A: Thank you. His name is Joseph. Lovely. And they gave him a middle name, Adrian,\nmy sister\u2019s -- from Canada, you know? Her husband just died last summer, so they gave\nhim a middle name. And the younger son, Paul, lives in Albuquerque. Remember I told\nyou he lives in New Mexico. And he had the -- a degree in geology and went into\nlandscaping and so he has a landscaping business. Real outdoorsy man. He\u2019s coming for\nthe Pa-Passover holidays, as he always does. We\u2019Il see him a little, you know, a few\ntimes a year.",
        "Q: If you don\u2019t mind, I would just like to ask you a few --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: [indecipherable] few more questions. One of them would be, to what extent did you\ntalk to your husband in the beginning about your experience? Was that an -- an issue?\nAnd how did -- later on, with your children, did they ask? Do you -- or do you --",
        "A: Well, you see, with my husband, it\u2019s like this: he married me when I -- he knew I went\nthrough the camps. When I met him, not very m-much was known about all these things.\nHe knew I had a number and he knew I ca -- he knew my background. He -- I told him as\nmuch as I could, but th-the -- only as a -- as a fill-in, like I wanted to find out about his\nfamily, where they came from and what they did and how they did it. When the children\nwere born, I wasn\u2019t -- I was never -- I never wa -- intended to hide my background,\nnever, never. They -- and when I was in camp as this counselor, they said, \u201cYou know,\nRed,\u201d -- they used to call me Reggie, they said, \u201cShow me your number. Why did you\nput your telephone number there?\u201d Th-The kids in -- in -- 1n camp -- in the -- this was\nhere in the New York state, in a camp. And so later, when the -- my own kids were young\nand they used to say, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I used to say, \u201cThat\u2019s my telephone number,\u201d when\nthey were two years old. But later on, of course they knew everything, but I never sa --\nburdened them with, \u201cSit down and I\u2019Il tell you.\u201d Never, never, never. First of all, they\nwere both smart children and very read -- they read a lot, like I do, so they always used to\nfind out a lit -- so tell me about it. Any time they were ready to tell, I told everything.\nAnd Victor, too. He knows my life inside out and sideways, because he\u2019s already heard\neverything. And you know, as time evolves, you know, eventually I became a translator\nand interpreter and I did all kinds of jobs. And a lot of work I\u2019m doing 1s really dealing\nnow, not so much before -- I did a lot of commercial interpreting and -- and translating.\nI\u2019m a member of the National Association of Translators. Cr -- Accredited so I get calls\nfrom all over. Now I -- my husband is retired, so I don\u2019t want to take as many jobs as -- I\ncould, if I wanted to, because I always get calls for jobs. But you see, when -- the last 10\nyears, the majority of -- of -- I\u2019m a free-lancer -- of work, is -- deals with the Holocaust.\nAnd it\u2019s a -- you know, I did -- did you ever see a -- a -- a film or did you ever read a\nbook called the Lodz ghetto? Okay, you see my name in that, I did the interpr -- the -- the\n-- one third of that book came from Polish. I did the -- the translations and I worked on it\na year and a half, because I got, used to get the material on a -- in and out by pieces. You\nknow, they used to get the -- all the Lodz ghetto book and the film. Kolchuk, a lot of\nKolchuk, all of Kolchuk material I used to do way. Somebody wrote a play in California,\nfor which I did translations of Kolchuk. I just translated a book about the Krakow ghetto\nand of course, I was given a lot of mat -- other material about the Gypsies, about -- sa --\nI\u2019m telling, the last 10 years, I do still commercial work, you know, legal work and the\npositions and such. But somehow or other, because I know the background, you see? It\u2019s\nvery easy for me. I get phone calls, see? I get -- belong to this organization, so my friends\nin New York call me every now and then, they have work to do, what does this mean,\nwhat does that mean? To me, I don\u2019t even have to look it up, because if 1t deals with the\nwar years, I really, truly have a better understanding, because you don\u2019t translate words,\nyou know, you work within a framework of a -- a concept. And the underlying concept,\nanything to do with Holocaust, not everybody, even in the language, you know language\ndeflects very much the times and word that could mean one thing 50 years ago, couldn\u2019t\nmean the same today. So, what I\u2019m trying to say is that, somehow or other, because I\u2019m\nworking, I always have some Holocaust material. Victor is in -- one time, if I wa -- had\ntoo much work to do, I ask him to -- I -- I translate by hand, sometimes he would type the\nmaterial for me, you see? If it -- because I had to submit it 1n typing and if I was\noverwhelmed, he will help me out a little and sit at night, after he came from the office\nand he would -- he would help me type. So he -- he knew what I was working on and he\nwould read it, you see and now he du -- doesn\u2019t, I mean I don\u2019t do these jobs any more,\nbecause our life is too busy and he\u2019s retired and I -- I -- I should not be tying him down to\n-- you know, 1-1f I start getting jobs, even though I\u2019m a freelancer, that means he has to\nhang around, too. You know, we can\u2019t take a trip, we can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t do that. So,\nthis way, if it\u2019s a short job I take it. Last job I did was a book, took me a year. And I told\nthe person, I said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it less than a year, because I -- absut -- don\u2019t -- I mean,\nyou want it? Fine. If not, that\u2019s fine.\u201d But I did it, so was one year.",
        "Q: What are -- what are other events in America in the 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s, that were really\nimportant, that have affected you somehow? There\u2019s so much that happened.\n[indecipherable] civil rights movement.",
        "Q: Well, PIl tell you, the McCarthy period affected me very much, because I just\ncouldn\u2019t see -- anything that had to do with persecution or that had to do with hounding\nother people, I -- and of course I came from a much more structured political system than\nAmerican democracy. To me it seems a guy like McCarthy should have been kicked out\nthe same minute. But it took all that time to go through the courts and to do this\n[indecipherable] the other. Meanwhile, people li -- people\u2019s lives were ruined. And I\nbasically had never any love for the Communists, that, believe me, because we left\nPoland because -- before the Communists got there. You know, when we left they\nweren\u2019t yet established. Poland was not yet a satellite country in the way that it became\nlater. I had no love for them, because to me this was -- this was another kind of\nrepression, plus the fact that I did find out, through the Jews who were in Russia, or even\n-- | had very wonderful Christian friends, who -- who also suffered. One of my very dear\nfriends, her father was killed in Cutting. You ever heard that name, of that place? Yeah,\nCutting is a place where the Polish officers, the Christian officers were killed in a ravine\nin -- in -- in, by Russians. But they said the Germans did it, but it really was the Russians.\nSo -- no, when I added all this up, what I heard from the Jews who went into Russia\nduring the war and who came out -- and through the Christians who suffered in Russia\nand through all those other things that the -- the Communist regime was doing, I -- I had\nno love for them. So when I saw that McCarthy was pursuing the so-called Communists,\nand -- and fellow travelers --used to be called in those days, a lot of it was not factual.\nYou know, because as I understood American history, in the 30\u2019s, there was a great\nliberal movement in this country, that felt for Russia, you know, that -- that -- but of\ncourse that turned out to be a whole bunch of -- bunch of lies. The Russian, so-called,\nyou know, the -- the Russian, th-the trials and the -- I mean, this was -- now you\u2019re\nfinding out that Stalin was as big a murderer as Hitler, you see. So I already had a good\ninkling in the 50\u2019s and in the 60\u2019s and when the McCarthy came, that -- 1t was absolutely\npainful to me. That was one very drastic awareness, shake-up in my head. The second\nwas the 60\u2019s, not the Civil Right Movements, because I didn\u2019t know the extent to which\nthe -- the blacks were being oppressed, prior to coming. I knew I was in Indiana with\nblacks and I was in Jefferson with and I -- it di-didn\u2019t make any difference to me and I\ndidn\u2019t acc -- understand the extent of everything. But you see, I did very much object to\nthe so-called revolution, the hippie revolution in the 60 and 80, 60\u2019s -- in the 60\u2019s,\nbecause that was already tearing at the fabric of society, you see? And I went through\nvery hard times in -- in the 1968 school strike, when I was so involved with the school\nboard and the -- the library and all these school things and we had factions of people who\nwere ready to tear down the system and -- oh, a lot of energy and a lot of tribulations, I\nassoc-associate with that, plus the 60\u2019s as an -- a revolt against the culture, American --\nyou know the hippie movement and the free love movement and the living in communes,\nwhich everything now comes out to be that it really wasn\u2019t, you know? Th-This -- this --\nth-th-the flower children and all. It was only a sort of a -- you know, their numbers were\ngreater, because they\u2019re the boom -- the boomers, the baby boomers, so they could really\nshow force in numbers. But what they stood for wasn\u2019t very much. It was something that\ndidn\u2019t pan out the way they expected it, which of course everybody knew from the\nbeginning that it wasn\u2019t going to pan out. As I knew in City College had -- they had open\nadmission and we are predicted 30 years ago, they took 30 years to come to the point,\nafter they ruined three generations of students. I predicted that open admission is going to\nkill the standards, the academic standards. That there was no reason why children could\nnot learn, as -- as I saw with my own eyes. Children can learn if they are motivated. You\ndon\u2019t bring them down to a levels of -- of whatever, you take them up. And now you see\n-- now they are to -- trying to re -- re -- in my days, Brooklyn College and City College\nwere as good as Harvard any time. You see, in high schools and everything. But the -- in\nthe 60\u2019s, where all this movement started toward liberalization of everything, so they\nthrew the baby with the bathwater together, out. And I know what we went through here\nin the schools. Bronx High School of Science was threatened to become a neighborhood\nschool, not a specialized high school. We were instrumental, through Albany, to take it\nout from under the auspices of the brook -- of the -- no, in Brooklyn, it\u2019s a school --\nschool administration for the city of New York. Place it under the state administration. I\nwas instrumental in it, because Senator Zaretski from Albany lived in our neighborhood.\nAnd we had a meeting with him -- science parents and he told us we will need a sponsor\na bill. And we had two parents with children who went to Bronx Science. It\u2019s Hirkt and\nColundra bill was put through the senate -- state senate and Science was -- five -- five\nspecialized schools were taking out from under the jurisdiction of the Board of Education\nin Brooklyn and pay -- placed under the state jurisdiction. And that was Bronx Science,\nStuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, Music and Art and Hunter. We saved those schools, because\nthat was -- they were saying this --these schools were elitist, so they don\u2019t belong in a\ndemocratic country. They belong as neighborhood schools. Well, every neighborhood\nschool, which I told you Jefferson High School -- when I tell somebody Jefferson High\nSchool, they give me a double look. They say, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have gone to Jefferson\nHigh School.\u201d \u201cYes, I did.\u201d It was a fantastic school, it was on the highest level. And\nthese school, luckily, the bill was passed, we went to all the new -- attended to it. And we\nhad all these, we had very strong parent\u2019s association in Bronx Science, so that was\naccomplished, but all this ties in with that movement in the 60\u2019s, everything goes. In\nother words, you could tear everything that you don\u2019t think is at all valuable. Of course,\nwhen you\u2019re young, nothing is valuable, because you want to rebel. You rebel against\nthis and that and the other, but then give you 20 more years and you look back, you say,\n\u201cWhy\u2019d I do that?\u201d You know? And all these -- these yuppies today, called yuppies, you\nknow? When they were -- they were the yippies, when they were -- look at how many of\nthem ended up in -- 1n ne -- th -- the -- the -- the -- the what do they call that? Th-The --\nIndustrial complex? What was the name? Military industrial complex. I mean, look how\nmany of these went into big business, they are on top of all the big corporations and\nthings and they left all that nonsense behind. And I am sorry to say that now things are\nturning back, because what was -- it was really that 1t wasn\u2019t any good. You asked me\nbefore how I wanted to bring up my children. Well, our emphasis, as you could see with\nmy involvement with the schools, was tremendous. Both of us, but -- in fact, Victor,\nwhen it started to getting very hard to get to Bronx Science at night, I was afraid alone.\nSo Victor would come from work and take me there. Because you know, it\u2019s a trip by\nsubway. So they said, \u201cWhat are you --.\u201d He said he would just sit there. So they said --\nused to meet in the library -- used to say, \u201cWhy is Victor sitting on the side?\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell, because he has to ring me, I\u2019m afraid to come in now.\u201d \u201cNo such thing.\u201d So he\nbecame treasurer. They pulled him in, hook or crook. They say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care what you\nsay, you sitting here, you going to be treasurer.\u201d So he was trea -- he was treasurer\neverywhere, all the time, but anyhow, Bronx Science, he said he\u2019d just take me there and\nhe\u2019 ll sit and he\u2019II read his pa -- newspapers, whatever there, on the side and they said,\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to be treasurer.\u201d So, no, the kids were very much oriented to -- not so\nmuch to succeed as to broaden their horizon. We traveled a lot with them, we -- together.\nWe did a lot of very interesting things. Kids used to go to summer camp, to the Boy\nScouts for a month. And then we used to go traveling together. Nova Scotia, Prince\nEdward Island, Canada very often. All the way to Indiana to re-visit my school. It was\nvery interesting and interesting trips and we wanted them to excel, very much and we\nwanted them -- we never pressed, you know. Harry, the older one, always knew that he\nwanted to be a lawyer or something like that and Paul knew always he could not be a\nlawyer or anything that would keep him at a desk, you see? He\u2019s a very successful,\nlovely, lovely guy, but he\u2019s all outdoors. He cannot -- you would not put him -- he\u2019s --",
        "Q: What is he doing?",
        "A: He has a landscaping business and he is very happy being outdoors, all the time. He\nruns a business, he works on the site, with -- he plans the landscaping, you know, he\ndraws projects and he does big -- you know, big jobs.",
        "Q: What does your other son [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s Paul. No, Harry is a lawyer and he\u2019s married to Cheryl and she\u2019s -- she works\nin New York for the arts. Used to work for 10 years to the -- she was director of\ndevelopment for New York City ballet and now she works for the 42nd Street\nDevelopment Corporation. You know, the people who are the -- who are developing --\nyou know the Ford Theater and the New Victory Theater, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the arts that\nshe\u2019s working for.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a coninti -- this is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Regina Gelb. This tape -- this is tape number five, side A. When\n-- when you think back about your life after liberation, is there anything in particular that\nwe haven\u2019t mentioned yet, that was very important to you or to your family that -- that\nwe should simply mention?",
        "A: Well, I think I did elaborate on the fact that certain lessons learned, through the bare\nexperiences, benefited me in a certain way. Number one is the importance of family. We\nare -- we were, the three of us, the three sisters, were extremely close. Each one of us\nmarried, we were extremely close as six people. Each one of us has children and\ngrandchildren and we are extremely close. This is no exaggeration, even though my\noldest sister has been living in Canada. They could not make it to America, you know,\nbecause by then the quota was closed or whatever, by the time they came. So they went\nto Canada, sponsored by my uncle, who lived there then. And the importance of family,\nof being there, of being there for those whom you love and who love you. This is the sum\nand substance of what I took out of my bad experiences. The reason being, that my\nparents were torn away from me, as was my extended family. Torn away in a way that\nyou don\u2019t even have a grave to go to, you see? Therefore, the idea of the family unit,\nwhich, as I\u2019m getting older, I find even more important, because society is changing so\nquickly. People are scattered. In the old days, there was always a -- a nucleus and a f --\nand a -- an extended family within one geographic area. Now, even in our own case --\nyou see Paul, our youngest son, lives in Albuquerque. Of course, we see each other two\nor three times a year, he comes to every important ceremony or celebration. A bris and\nthe Passover Seder always and unfortunately last summer, we lost my brother-in-law, he\nwent to -- came to the funeral. And other than that, he comes to New York too and we\u2019re\non the phone five to seven days a week. I mean, we have to find out where the weather 1s\nlike and such. That is the most important thing of all. And as I say, it 1s being reinforced\nas I see the culture in America changing. And the people getting alienated and scattered.\nSo, for that, I am grateful that I was able to achieve that. That was really my number one\nthing op -- uppermost -- to create a family and to stay within that unit. I have achieved\nthat. I have always been extremely attached to academics, as I said. And I was forever\ngrateful that I could get my education -- higher education here. To the extent to which an\neducation opens your eyes on things that you could do on your own. I didn\u2019t have -- I\nwas going to get the -- more degrees, but it -- 1t didn\u2019t turn out with degrees, but it turned\nout just the same that through the years, I was either involved in courses, or I was giving\ncourses, or I was engaged one way or another with the schools or whichever. Very\ngrateful for the fact that I could accomplish that, so that I could develop my mind and\nnow at my age, have all the resources. If I\u2019m interested in this, I know how to find it, I\nknow where to look for it, I know what I like, I know which museum exhibit I will go to\nand which I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t go to the movies just because it\u2019s playing. I know what I want\nand I wa -- that I don\u2019t want. I read the same way, selectively, always selectively -- so\nthat I\u2019m very grateful for that. And other than that, you know, I feel for the world that is\nsuffering. The way things have not -- have not really come to a conclusion after the\nHolocaust on -- in the larger sense. It\u2019s still the same thing 1s going on. Not to the same\nextent, but -- you read the papers and there\u2019s Ireland and there\u2019s Bosnia and now you\nhave Kosovo and you have -- so one way or another, I don\u2019t think that this -- in my\nlifetime, that I have seen a resolution of that bigger problem, which is humankind. Of\ncourse, nothing would ever -- I can\u2019t imagine a thing would ever compare to the genocide\ndone by the Nazis to the Jews. That, I think, is in a category all it\u2019s own. And much as\npeople are trying to use the word Holocaust, which is now -- I -- I noticed this in the\npapers, the Times writes about it a lot, that the people are acquiring the Holoc -- the\nJapanese Holocaust. This is totally without comparison. No experience -- no experience\ncompares to the Hol -- Jewish Holocaust -- the European Jewish Holocaust. Not in\nhistory as I know history and not the present time in anywhere, does that compare. The\nsystematic, technological destruction of people, with a plan, that 1s a separate -- totally\nseparate event. As events in history go, that must always stand on it\u2019s own. And I -- I feel\nfor other people, I sympathize with the Japanese, but I know what Holocaust is. ve been\nthere, I\u2019ve lived through it. I lost most of my family there and I can tell you that nothing\never -- nothing ever happened to compare. And I hope it will never happen, which we\ndon\u2019t know, because technology now is even more advanced than it was in Hitler\u2019s time.\nHe could gas and -- and -- and -- and burn them in the chimneys. Today, maybe they cou\n-- they could just nuke them, if they wanted to. You know, you could throw one bomb\nand th-the -- nuke the whole world. But this 1s -- those are the things that -- in the larger\nscale about the Holocaust. But on the personals -- on the person -- coming down again to\nthe specific from the general, I can tell you I consider myself extremely lucky. I survived,\nnot because I really was clever or smart or anything. It just -- just -- that was that chance.\nI married Victor, who\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful husband and a wonderful father and we\nhad a -- had a very peaceful, wonderful life. I probably could never go through life again\nwith any upheavals of any kind. We are both sort of, we\u2019re -- you know, we like quiet\nand solitude -- not solitude, but we don\u2019t like the excitement. I mean I -- when we were\nyounger, we\u2019d -- we did a little more, but absolutely I -- I -- I\u2019m very grateful that -- that\nwe are -- you know, we\u2019re married 45 years now and we\u2019ve gotten along very well and\nthe kids are very attached to us, we\u2019re very attached to the kids and our grandchildren and\neverything and -- you asked me about how much I told the children. I mean now they\u2019re\ngrown men and I talk freely. I gave them the cop-copy of my show and everything. So I\ntold them, look at the tape and ask me, ask me. Really, ask me what you want. Because\nnow they know history and they know everything. They ask me and we talk like -- as I do\nwith you now and Max, too. Max is our little nine year old grandson, Harry\u2019s and\nCheryl\u2019s boy. And I -- I tell him, I say, \u201cYou know why I have this number? Because I\nwas -- you know, I was in a concentration camp during the war, you know, when -- when\nI was in Europe.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I know all about it.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, any time you want to\nknow more about that, you ask me and I\u2019Il tell you.\u201d In other words, I always leave the\ndoor open, you see. Th-The kids, they know everything, because I am very free to talk\nabout it. I don\u2019t cry, I don\u2019t break down, in the sense as other people get terribly\nemotionally disturbed. That was a part of my life and as I think I told you before, I was so\nlucky to come here and to be a young girl in America, you know? I was just so lucky.\nAnd -- and a lot of people who came, who weren\u2019t that much older, maybe 10 years\nolder, they already had to go to work and they already had to struggle, they could never\ngo back to school, you see? Or maybe they came with a child and it was dif -- I came a\nyoung girl, like a -- like a young horse, you know, ready to get out of the stable and run. I\nwas just like that, you know? I was like an eager beaver, I was willing and ready and\neverything was a lovely, nicest experience. Even if 1t wasn\u2019t so nice, I thought was great.\nEverything I did. Everything -- every summer camp, every baby-sitting, every this and\nthat on the other, everything was wonderful, cause was a new experience, you see? And it\nreally took me away from -- not that it took me away, it was something I didn\u2019t yet\nexperience, you know? I came here, I hadn\u2019t lived yet, so everything that I lived was\ngreat. And it -- in true fashion, it -- it really was. I mean it was not an exaggeration\nbecause all these things that happened to me, everything was sort of by chance, people --\nyou know, I got a job to support myself by working in the ORT. I didn\u2019t look for it, they\nlooked for it. I got a job to teach in Indiana, I didn\u2019t look for that. You know, you know,\nyou see what I mean? Every time I do something th -- I was asked to do it or something\nand it turned out a fantastic experience, so that\u2019s fine.",
        "Q: Did you ever go back to Poland?",
        "A: Yes, I went back w -- twice. Once with Victor, to show him around and -- by which\ntime, I wasn\u2019t so eager any more to go the route of -- of nostalgia or anything. I -- \u2019m\nvery much interested -- I love Ch-Chopin, Frederick Chopin\u2019s music and I did some\ninterpret -- translating for Chopin biographies. So we traveled the Chopin route, that was\none aspect. We went wherever he was born -- where he was born, where he live, where\nthe concerts were and so on. That was one route. The second was to go to my hometown\nand visit with the old friends of my parents. And then we went to Auschwitz, of course.\nWe went to visit the camps, Shellneetsa and Mioufka. Mioufka does not exist, they\u2019re\nhousing projects now. And Shellneetsa is back to the firing range. They still -- now they\nput it back into a firing range. That was a very touching experience, going through my\nhometown with Victor. But you see, I was already with Victor, so that was an -- I was\nalready in another frame of mind. Then, of course, we went to Auschwitz and while\nthere, w-we also went to Vialeetchka, which is a salt mine. They said all the salt mine in\nEurope and they take you down on a tour. From the 11th century, all the way below, and\nI -- so | -- there was a combination and we went to Zarchoparna to visit the reserve. In\nother words, it wasn\u2019t all Auschwitz, you see? It wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t all Auschwitz and it\nwasn\u2019t all Shellneetsa. Sure, we went to Shellneetsa, th-the -- the -- the taxi driver that\ntook us there and we got there, it was after a rain, was such big potholes and he was\ndriving into the camp and I said, \u201cDon\u2019t go, you\u2019re going to ruin your taxi.\u201d He says,\n\u201cNo, no, you told me there was a camp here,\u201d Polish taxi driver, \u201cI\u2019m going to take you\nin there.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for a broken taxi.\u201d He insisted, he drove\nin and the old friends of my family\u2019s granddaughter, she was a young woman, 25, she\ntook us there, we walked around. There was nothing except that little brook where I\nremember people used to wash themselves in. And she told me, now it\u2019s back --\nShellneetsa is back to a shooting range. And the camp -- then we went to Mioufka. And\nabsolutely nothing. I mean, it\u2019s another world. Modern buildings and -- and the -- the bus\nruns through there and so on. So that\u2019s it. And the old factory was converted to trucks,\nthey do trucks. Star -- you know like Ford, Chevrolet, Star is the name, because\nStarachowice is the name of the town, so they named the trucks -- pickup trucks and\nsuch, that\u2019s -- the production was -- after the Russians -- by the way, the Russians\ndismantled the factory and took all this to Russia. And when it was rebuilt, 1t was rebuilt\nas a auto plant. So they do cars, th-the trucks. So that\u2019s the -- so nothing remained of that,\nyou see? So, as they say, you can\u2019t go home again? You see, but the old ladies, they were\nvery -- I have pictures from that trip. None of them are alive any more. Of course, this\nwas in 1980. So that was one trip and the second was as an interpreter for the Holocaust\nMemorial Museum for -- when the archives were being released, f -- actually, that was\nthe -- the negotiations for release of the archives, so I did that and that -- I went without\nVictor. And that was very interesting.",
        "Q: I know that you started a cemetery renovation project of sorts --",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Maybe you could talk a little bit --",
        "A: Okay, Pll tell you quickly about what happened. When Victor and I were in Poland in\n1980, we went to visit the Pole -- the Jewish cemetery and it was in horrible condition.\nYou know, the Germans have removed a lot of tombstones and made them for a -- for\nsidewalks, but -- but we found -- and I have pictures to prove it, we took -- Victor took\nmany pictures, houses were being built on the half of the cemetery. Well, I came back\nand I made a very big to-do about that. We meet once a year -- the Starachowice people,\nwe meet in New York, as they do everywhere, for the so-called Yurtside, which is\nOctober 27, thereabouts, we meet. So, the prayer is said for the dead and then we discuss.\nSo when I came back in 1980, with the pictures, I send the pictures to Israel and I said -- I\ngave the pictures here, in st -- and I told them, we\u2019ve got to do something, because there\nis still more building going on and we will lose that one last vestige of any -- anything\nthat shows that there was Jewish life there. We must do something. And -- I\u2019m sorry to\ntell you, that not everybody was on the same opinion. I was highly criticized. I was\nhighly criticized that I would have the nerve to say that we should pour in thousands of\ndollars for people who wouldn\u2019t care one way or another out there -- that they would ruin\nit anyhow. But there were other people who saw the problem otherwise and it took quite\na number of years to get around to the fact that we could do it. Those that will want to do\nit, should do it and not to have the naysayers negate this project. I personally have\nnobody in that cemetery. You know, w-we don\u2019t have anybody there, however, I kept\nsaying, \u201cHow would ever -- how would anybody ever know that there was a Jewish\ncommunity, except for that piece of a cemetery? Whatever is there, let us save it. Let us\nsave it.\u201d We -- so, not long ago, we got together honestly and truly, because in Israel,\nthey found somebody who goes to Poland to restore the cemeteries. First of all, I was\ninstrumental in registering it. Here, in New York, a good 15 -- 10 years ago, with a\nJewish agency, that had a list of Jewish cemeteries to be protected. They could not do\nanything about it, but just put it on a list of historic what do you call -- his-his-historic\nsites. So, maybe eight years ago, the Polish government -- Polish government put up a\nsign, historic -- okay, fine, historic area, what-whatever. Something was already done.\nThen we got, as the expression goes -- got on the stick. I collected money here, we made\na -- you know, personal, everything personal. Got on the phone, I had a list. People who -\n- whom I knew, who already expressed their opinion and great criticism, I didn\u2019t call. I\ncalled people -- I started from myself, I told everybody I gave so many hundreds of\ndollars, give me what you want, I don\u2019t mind. Send me a check, it should be mailed out --\nmade out to such and such -- Jewish projects or such. I send a few thousand dollars to\nIsrael. Canada send a few thousand dollars to Israel. Israel connected a few thou --\ncollected a few thousand dollars. Now the cemetery\u2019s a -- protected by a very beautifully\ndesigned iron fence with a beautiful gate. The sign 1s there, says this is to be preserved.\nNo more buildings could be built. The cemetery was a terrible place to see, whatever was\nleft. Stones were overturned, garbage was thrown on it. Gr -- Growth -- overgrowth of\ngreenery. First, the people who went from Israel to Poland arranged for people --\ncaretakers to clean it up. Then, a Mr. Yarley from Israel, who 1s also a -- restored already\na Jewish cemetery in Tomashavma Sovietski -- went to Starachowice, contacted people\nwho are artists, this -- the tombstones were righted, the lettering was restored, the place\nwas Cleaned up. Now it\u2019s behind a beautiful fence, now we have people who will be paid\nmonthly or y -- annually. Th-The person who is going to do it is a young artist. He\u2019s a\nsculptor and he\u2019s too thrilled to have this job of caretaker. And there is even going to be a\nbook put out, with pictures, which -- I just had a letter from Israel. But I feel very proud\nof it, because the few years that we didn\u2019t do anything, we almost lost the project and the\nreason was that -- part of it was that I -- I didn\u2019t want to create bad feelings and I -- I just\nlet it -- ya -- so, when I first brought up and I was very highly criticized. They say, \u201cI\u2019m\nsurprised at you Renia, that you should t-talk about it. We don\u2019t want to pour money in\nthere. They going to ruin it,\u201d and all this stuff and I -- I -- I just couldn\u2019t fight it, but I\nshould have, but I didn\u2019t, but anyhow, cooler heads prevailed and we decided to work\nwith the people who are willing and who are -- wh-who don\u2019t look at it that way. Now,\nwe have a beautifully restored cemetery, it\u2019s registered with the Polish government, it\u2019s\nregistered in the -- in America, which I did with another lady, in New York, when we\nregistered with this Rabbi Hyatt was his name, when the project was first started, we\nwere very lucky to get in our name on that list. I don\u2019t mean my name, but the -- the\ncommunity\u2019s cemetery. I\u2019m very proud of that accomplishment because as I said, having\nlost my parents in -- and family in a way that I never knew how they perished or where\nthey perished, that little bit of the Jewish life that was left under that soil, should really be\nhonored and preserved and I don\u2019t care if it takes money or if -- whatever. If they ruin it,\nlet\u2019s pay again an-an-and keep it up. Of course now it would not -- there will be no more\nbuildings. That\u2019s for sure because you can\u2019t press on the -- on -- on the -- on the iron\ngates. And the design was approved, who had approved it here, architectural designs. So\nit\u2019s really worth -- it -- I -- it makes me feel so good and you know, I had the money in no\ntime. As soon as I called up, everybody says, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d I -- I think I send two -- I\nsend the check twice, the first phone calls, I had one envelope with checks and then the\nsecond envelope. And before I know -- I mean it was 0 -- it was nothing. Of course I\nknew whom I should call and whom I shouldn\u2019t call and likewise in Israel. So there are\npeople that -- that -- my friend in Israel wrote me, one of them got up and made an awful\nrow about how dare you. The same thing. How dare you want money for this thing when\nthey not going to respect it. But I do know it was an important thing to do. I\u2019m very glad\nI got involved in it, even though I really felt that it was going to come with a fight. It\ndidn\u2019t come with a fight, because once we eliminated the naysayers, the coast was clear.\nAnd money -- it\u2019s only money, so -- you see, this is how it turned out and I\u2019m very\npleased about it and if there is a book, I might show you someday. I don\u2019t have it, but he\nsaid -- they told me in Israel that there will be a book, so --",
        "Q: I have only one brief question left.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: You mentioned your -- the -- the number you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] in Auschwitz. Would you mind telling us what the number is?",
        "A: Sure. First, the thing I told you -- first let me give you the number. The number is A\nand then it\u2019s 14178. As I told you when they were tattooing us, we lined up, my sisters\nlined up wi -- I lined up according to age. So my oldest sister Hanya or Anna, her number\nis A14176, Kris, the middle one, has 77 and I have 14178. As you could see, there is an\nA letter preceding the number and a lot of people ask me, \u201cWhy is there a letter?\u201d Th-th -\n- you see, they ran out of numbers and they had to start a second -- in Auschwitz., they\nstart a s -- what do you call it -- d -- a -- s-s-s -- a serial, an second serial and this 1s -- this\nis why there\u2019s A. You know, there was a number like this before, 14178, but the A is --\nyeah. And also, you know, it\u2019s very easy now to tell, that this is from the later numbers.\nYou see, as I told you, we came to Auschwitz when the Russian offensive was nearing,\nmeaning it was already late in the war. So now -- and anybody who is knowledgeable,\nwhen they see A, they know -- they can place me, so to say. To know that I wasn\u2019t there\nin 1942 or something like that, when the original people came, you see? And as I told\nyou, I\u2019m never, ever ashamed of it. I never want to remove it and I had an offer many\ntimes. I knew a plastic surgeon. In fact, when I had the job in the summer -- in a -- as a\ngoverness to a child in -- one summer, I was still in high school. He thought that I would\nbe afraid I wil -- can\u2019t afford it, so he said, \u201cPll remove your number and I won\u2019t charge\nyou anything.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I have not interest.\u201d He said, \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t charge you. You\ndon\u2019t need it.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need it, but I -- it doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\u2019 Was a Jewish doctor.\nI was a governess to his child in the summer. I went with the wife to a hotel in the\nCatskills and I was, you know, I was the baby-sitter. And he didn\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t\nremove it, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t, I go to my grave with it.",
        "Q: Is there anything that you would like to say in concluding the interview?",
        "A: Well no, it\u2019s really nice of you to have put in all this time. I know it\u2019s an -- a big\neffort. And I don\u2019t mind talking about my experiences and I don\u2019t mind pointed questions\neither and it\u2019s a long interview. I know I\u2019ve worn you out. My voice is going, too. But no\n-- I\u2019m very glad to share this and to have it for posterity. For whatever reason. Certainly I\nho -- if I have a copy, Ill be very happy to give it to my kids, even though they do know\nthe story pretty well by now. Because in bits and pieces they found out, as they asked.\nAgain -- as they asked, you see? So I really thank you. That\u2019s very nice of you. Thank\nyou.",
        "Q: Thank you very much. And this concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum interview with Regina Gelb.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nConclusion of Interview\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Regina Gelb, conducted by Regina Baier, on August 27th, 1998\ninterview conducted with Regina Gelb on September 30th, 1991. The United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. This interview, as I said to you\nbefore, is a little different from the one that we had last time, because it was really\nimportant to not interrupt your narrative too much. We covered, really, a lot of ground\nand I didn\u2019t want to intercept with too many questions. This time, it will be slightly\ndifferent. We are trying to fill in and clarify a few aspects, and to make that easier,\nbecause it is not quite so -- such a comfortable conversational mode, really, I would like\nto do that in a chronological manner. So let\u2019s start with a time when you were in Berlin,\nin the camp for displaced persons. And you wanted to -- before I ask my first question,\nyou wanted to talk a little bit about something that we didn\u2019t mention in the first\ninterview, which was the situation of Berlin at that time.",
        "Answer: Certain-Certainly, yes. Yeah, well of course you can guide the interview\nhowever you wish, because I -- I don\u2019t mind if you stop me, if you don\u2019t stop, if you just\nlet the narrative go. Either way you decide is fine with me. Coming back to Berlin,\nperhaps it would be good to mention the years again, so that we have it within a certain\nframework. I arrived in the displaced person\u2019s camp in Berlin, in the early part of 1946,\nprobably around March or so, in the company -- actually my sister, Kris was married to\nMiles Lehrman at that time and they were my guardians. So the three of us arrived in\nBerlin, in the DP camp, which was located in the American sector. Now, this is 1946, the\nwar is over not quite a year yet. And Berlin is now divided into four sectors. One is the\nAmerican, in which the DP camp was located. One is the British, one is the French and\none is the Russian. Now, a lot of people do not understand the concept of a DP camp and\nthey say, \u201cWell,\u201d that you were in concentration camp and with barbed wires and, \u201cWas\nthis another one like it?\u201d Well, obviously a DP camp was not a camp surrounded by\nbarbed wire. It was an area designated for gathering up the people who were now shifting\n-- the people who were moving from place to place for all kinds of reasons. And it was\njust an area where there were barracks for people to -- to -- to -- to live in. Everybody had\na room in a barrack. It was very, very decent. There was a -- a -- a mess hall, where\npeople went for lunch -- breakfast, lunch and dinner. There was an area which was set\naside for -- for dancing, for there wer -- they had dances. And there was the school, of\ncourse to which I went. That was a building separate from the others. We even had our\nown dining room, because a lot of the children, including myself, were highly\nundernourished. We have never yet gotten our development, fall into the -- the range of\ndevel -- of physical development, so that we actually had better food than -- not better,\nbut probably more substantial, including chocolate. Pll always remember that, including\nchocolate. They had bars of chocolate for the children all the time. Well anyhow, Berlin\nitself, the city itself, was like any other post-war city, parts of it were bombed out\nhorribly, parts of it were not bombed. And the sector -- the particular sector always\nreflected the occupier. In other words, in the Russian sector, it was very, very difficult to\nbe around, because we were taught -- even the kids in school, we used to go on -- on\nthese outings and we used to go to the theater with the class and so on. We were told we\ncan go very freely to the three sectors. One, the American, the British and the French, but\nonce you go into the Russian sector, you really -- 1f you have to, absolutely -- and\nsometimes we did have to, because the -- all city -- Berlin city, that had all the theaters,\nwas within the Russian sector, so that you really had to just mind your surroundings. The\nRussian soldiers were always asking for IDs and such. The presence of the four occupiers\nwas very visible. You could always see American soldiers, in Jeeps, on foot, in the\nAmerican sector. You could always see the British in uniform, all over. You could\nalways see the French, so that Berlin, which is a German city -- and 1t was way before it\nwas divided into south and west, we\u2019re now talking at the period of time when I was\nthere, which was from about March \u201846, til the end of January or so, in 1947. And the\ncity was vibrant, but it was first really emerging from the horror of war, which you could\nsee. I have pictures, as I mentioned before, where the -- the famous church on\nCoffersendam is all in rubble and I\u2019m standing in front of it and I have a picture with it.\nSo that was the -- that was the reality of Berlin. It was not what you would call a German\ncity, as such, because German presence was -- if at all -- little visible to the naked eye.",
        "Q: Did you have any particular feelings about the Americans?",
        "A: Well. I was thrilled, I was absolutely thrilled, because you know, to me -- I did not\nknow American history, but I just learned, during the war, that America was this great,\nfantastic country and President Roosevelt was God. And that -- that is all I knew at -- at\nthat time. And of course seeing Americans in uniform was so reassuring. Having seen\nGerman uniforms around me for the duration of the war and fearing a uniform, even\nwhen I saw it from 10 blocks away, shaking in my sh -- boots, this feeling now, of -- of\nseeing these friendly Americans, you know, they were sort of a little boisterous and they\nwere smiling. And -- and you know, the idea of just passing somebody in the street and\nsomebody smiling to you, didn\u2019t say anything to him, he didn\u2019t say anything to you, they\njust passes you by and he smiles. Well, that was a -- that was a sort of a healing kind of a\nfee-feeling. You know, I -- I'll be talking in rhymes, soon. The fact that my idea of the\nuniform, don\u2019t forget I was still a young girl, my idea of the uniform was always\nconnected with fear, always connected with fear. I thought that I would probably go to\nmy grave, sh-shaking over a military person, which of course is not the case, I mean,\nbecause you know, once you get over the original fear. So, to answer your question, yes,\nI was absolutely thrilled to see them.",
        "Q: Among the American soldiers were also black soldiers --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- [indecipherable] the American soldiers?",
        "A: Yes, I'll tell you, as a matter of fact, you know, I have never seen black people before\nin my life, because Poland was basically a white country and of course, predominantly\nCatholic. And then, being in camps and so on, I -- I\u2019ve -- ve met people -- Europeans,\nonly. Whether they were Greek or Italian, whoever, but I have never seen a -- a black\nperson until I was in -- in Germany. And my first black person was a American soldier.\nAnd I was absolutely fascinated, because he again had that smiley face, you see, he again,\nlike the others, you know? He didn\u2019t know me, I didn\u2019t know him. I just saw this -- this\nman, this black man in a -- in a American uniform, with a big smile. And of course that --\nthat was totally disarming and I -- I always remember that, because when I came to\nAmerica, of course, then I realized that this a multi-cultural country and multi-racial and\ncertainly not the kind of background that I came with, where it was predominantly\nCatholic and a min-minority being Jewish, so that it didn\u2019t compare and that was another\nsort of eye opening experience.",
        "Q: And then eventually -- eventually you left for Bremenhaven?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And the question would be, why did you go and how did you go?",
        "A: All right. Well, as I told you, we -- I -- Miles Lehrman and Kris Lehrman were my\nguardians. Miles had a -- I think I mentioned it in the other tapes, but Ill repeat it just to\ngive it context. He had an old aunt living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. She sent\nout papers for him, but wherever he went, his wife went and then I went. As I was saying,\nI was the fifth wheel, but they didn\u2019t think so. But, in any case, he received papers to go\nto America for the three of us. Now, in those days, because we were registered in the DP\ncamp, we were sent to an American agency in Berlin, which was in the American sector.\nWhether it was a consulate or the embassy, I couldn\u2019t tell, but I do know that we were\nfingerprinted there. That we were f-fully registered, our visas were processed. In other\nwords, our papers were completed at that spot. From there we were given a date when we\nshould go to Bremenhaven, where we are going to meet a ship, which is going to take us\nto America. So, we left Berlin for Bremenhaven, and I think we stayed in Bremenhaven\ntwo to three days, because the ships that were taking the refugees to America were\nconverted military transport ships. And our ship was called Marine Perch and I couldn\u2019t\ntell you the exact date when we boarded the ship, but we did arrive in New York Harbor\non February 11th, 1947. And, I might add something that\u2019s -- that might be interesting. A\nlot of people ask me, \u201cOh, so you went to Ellis Island?\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t go to Ellis Island.\nEven though Ellis Island was still functioning as a whatever you call it, transfer point or\nwhatever, we were processed -- our papers were processed fully in Germany -- in Berlin,\nI mean, within the American embassy, let\u2019s say, or wit -- or consulate. So that when we\narrived in New York and these old folks were there, this old aunt, she was I think in her\nlate 80\u2019s with this old husband and they were waiting for us. We just presented our\nprocessed papers and we got off the boat and there we were in a taxi, going to the Lower\nEast Side. So, we have never been to Ellis Island. And I think that -- that might be of\ninterest, too.",
        "Q: Let me ask you just -- before we move on to the next part of your life, one quick\nfollow-up question, you mentioned fingerprinting --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- during your processing. Which 1s sort of another way of -- of counting people in a\nsort of somewhat mechanized way.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was that -- did -- did that have a different impact on you than others that you had\nexperienced before, or was that slightly scary to you?",
        "A: Quite the opposite. You know, having been tattooed with a number, in -- in\nAuschwitz, this fingerprinting was like somebody was opening the gate for me. Because I\nknew that they are making sure that I will be secure, you see? However I -- that I --\nhowever I explain that, it absolutely had the utmost wonderful connotation. It had\nnothing to do with fear, it had everything to do with a sigh of relief. Finally, they will\nknow exactly who I am, because they did, you know, when I looked at my -- the -- that\ncard, the ship card which I -- well, that I still have. They have my height, my weight, my\n-- the color of my eyes, the color of my hair, the fact that I have a number. And of course\nI knew that -- that the fingerprints were there too, meaning they couldn\u2019t mistake me for\nanybody else. And I was going to America and that was fantastic.",
        "Q: So now you were in America, in New York and you would go to Jefferson High\nSchool, and the next questions are -- will be about that.",
        "A: That\u2019s fine.",
        "Q: That\u2019s fine?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: The -- the first question is, you went to a special, or there was a special program\nassociated with your group?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Holocaust survivors would go to special classes?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you happen to know whether or not that was the -- the only program of it\u2019s kind in\nthe United States?",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t know for sure, but let me just again put it in the context of things.\nThis was in Brooklyn. We moved to Brooklyn. We lived in Brooklyn -- we meaning\nMiles, Kris and I, we lived in Brooklyn and in those days you had to be assigned, when\nyou go -- went to high school, having come from the DP camp where the high school -- it\nwasn\u2019t a diploma, but a certificate that I was already of high school quality, so to say. In\nNew York City, in those days, high schools were what you call neighborhood high\nschools. In other words, you lived here and you were assigned to that high school. Well,\nin east New York, which is Brownsville, there was this high school, Thomas Jefferson\nHigh School, which was out of my so-called district, because I belonged in Tildon High\nSchool. But the Joint Distribution Committee advised me that I would belong -- I would\nfind my place better in Jefferson High School and they could see to it that I was allowed\nto go out of my district. It really wasn\u2019t so far out of the district, I mean, was maybe six\nor seven stops on the subway, you see. Jeffer -- Thomas Jefferson High School had a\nclass especially for refugee children. The reason being that there was a great influx of\nrefugees to Brooklyn in those years. When I arrived, I was really among the early\narrivals, except for a friend of mine who came as an orphan, by herself with a transport in\n1946, in September, I don\u2019t think anybody came to Jefferson before September or\nOctober of 1946, is when my friend -- I know, because she was there six month when I\narrived, and she was among those very first -- she did live -- she lived in the district, you\nsee? But anyhow, by the time I arrived, there was already a group formed that was called\n-- we were ca -- we weren\u2019t called refugees in -- it was called basic English, yes. It\u2019s sort\nof a --- well, euphemism, but it really wasn\u2019t far from the truth, because they did try to\naccommodate us to the English language in the first place, before they even tried to\nexpose us to the American culture. And as I mentioned before, the pres -- the principal of\nthat high school was Dr. Ludwig Karpen and he -- whether it was he who had the original\nidea, or whether by virtue of the great influx of these children, that class was formed, I\ncould not answer you this question. I only know that by the time I came to Jefferson, and\nthat probably was March or April, I met about -- there were about 30, maybe 35 of us in\nthat class. Now, how was the program arranged\u2019? The program was arranged that the first\nthing you did -- like you know, the -- wi -- they used to be called homeroom -- other\npeople had homeroom, you know, you came to class -- you came to high school and you\nhad homeroom, whatever that meant. We didn\u2019t have homeroom, we had basic English.\nWe used to meet with the head of the English department, her name was Miss Hay --\nMiss Agnes Hay. She was the one who was to be not only our guiding spirit, she was to\nbe our mother and father and surrogate everything. She -- and she was the type,\nextremely warm and outgoing and soft, you know, she didn\u2019t have any of that martinet\nkind of personality, she was a rather soft spoken woman. And, so the in gathering of\nthese different children -- the ages first of all were different. They were something --\nanywhere between 14 and -- and -- let\u2019s say 19. Some of them were 19 and didn\u2019t -- and\nbelonged to -- with -- you know, missed the education. Some of them were 17 and had a\nlot of education, more than the high school and so on. So all this had to be sorted out.\nThis class was, 1n the first place, also an orientation class as to how the educational\nsystem works. Who is the principal and what are the rights of the students and what are -\n- what you cannot do and what you shouldn\u2019t do -- what is expected of you. And another\nfact was brought out -- that of course I wasn\u2019t used to, the teacher is your best friend, so\nyou can always go to the teacher and talk to -- about your problems. In Poland there was\nno such thing. The teacher was the teacher, the student was the student and after class,\nthat was it. Here we were taught in the basic class, you can always go, if you have a\nproblem at home, if you couldn\u2019t do your homework, if you don\u2019t understand, if you find\nit hard. Whatever problem, personal or otherwise, the teacher will help you. Obviously\nthe teacher was not going to be the only one. He was going to be the one who was going\nto direct us -- direct us to other people who were also in place. You see, everything was\nvery subtle. I didn\u2019t understand a lot of it, but it -- it seemed like paradise. But obviously\nthere was a lot of planning put into it. For example, lunch was 25 cents. Now, you could\nnot make a child -- they want -- not every child could afford 25 cents to have lunch, from\nthe refugee children. They wanted us to have a free meal, but you could not make a child\nfeel inferior for not having to -- a quarter for the -- for the meal. We were given tokens\nthe size of a quarter and I remember the ladies name was Miss Frankel, or Mrs. Frankel\nor Mrs. Frank, something like this. She was Dr. Karpen\u2019s personal secretary. And all you\nhave to do it once a week goes to Miss -- go to Miss Frankel, or Frank. She s -- handed\nyou a little envelope, nobody knew what was in the envelope. And when you went on\nline in the school cafeteria, you handed in that token that looked like a quarter and no\nchild next to you or behind you, in front of you, could see that you were actually not able\nto pay for your lunch, you see? Those were the subtle arrangements. I mean, you never,\never had to say why you went to see Miss Frankel. You just went into the office, you\nsaid, \u201cI want to see Miss Frankel.\u201d You came in, she saw you, she gave you that little\nenvelope, you see? Everything was done with such dignity. But of course this has\nnothing to do now with the education itself. The -- the basic English class was the\norientation class. As to behavior, as to proper conduct in school, as to what was in-\ninvolved in American education, how th -- what things were expected of you, what was\nabout higher education and we met every day. In fact, they were telling us -- Miss Hay\nwould call a child or two up front and say, \u201cHow do you greet people in Poland?\u201d You\nknow? Because I told her that I once re -- ex-explained in the subway when we had -- wh\n-- 1-in the class, when we had -- the subject came up, I said we were in the subway, Miles,\nKris and I and somebody we knew from Berlin or from Poland, saw us in the subway and\ncame running over. He kissed Kris\u2019s hand and he kissed my hand and of course\neverybody in the subway gave us a -- I mean, people were astonished. So when we were\ntalking about proper greeting in basic English, I told Miss Hay how this thing happened\nand how peculiar that was in the subway. So those were the a -- the things that were\ndiscussed and that class also helped determine the level -- the lev -- the educational level\nof each child. So, for example, my English was rather poor, so I was put into -- in\naddition to basic English, which of course we also used to -- not memorize, but avail\nourselves of phrases -- of every day phrases, how you greet people, what you do when\nyou go to a supermar -- to the store. What do you do when you want to ask a question in\nthe street and so on. That was from basic English. But, to catch up with the English\nlanguage itself, I, for example, used to take two English classes at one time. Now, I was\nall -- by then I was already 17 and I was in a class with the 13 year olds, who were first\nentering high school, you see? Because that was my first eng -- the -- the -- the -- the\nEnglish course had to be covered, A to Z, four years. Now, as for other things, such as\nphysics or chemistry or math, we were tested on that and we were placed accordingly.\nSame went for history. Nobody was exempt from Civics, which was taught in those days,\nAmerican History, American Economics and obviously English and Speech. And the\nstrange thing was that after awhile, it really equalized, you know? That the people who\ndidn\u2019t have much background in English came up and people who had all this\nbackground in History, got on the same level with the others and we were not -- we were\nscattered in between different classes. We had to take foreign language and as I also\nmentioned, I took Hebrew as a foreign language, because I just came out of Hebrew\nschool and that was another bonanza for me, because Dr. Horowitz, who was the head of\nthe Hebrew department, and taught my class, was another source of -- not advice -- you\nsee, we\u2019re talking basically about Americanization, about acculturation. And I could tell\nyou, that from my viewpoint, Jefferson to me was the acculturation for -- for all times.\nThey saw our needs, they knew how to meet them. Everything was done with such\ndiscretion and with such dignity, that to this day I cannot -- absolutely cannot get over it.\nYou know, especially in the -- in -- in this more permissive time of welfare handouts and\nsuch, it was just a totally different scene and -- and aside from all of that, Jefferson was a\nvery, very good academic school.",
        "Q: Can I ask just one or two more question with regard to the basic English classes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You said Americanization was --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- one of the -- or was the overarching goal, probably. Could you give maybe one or\ntwo sort of more specific example of what -- what that meant? How did they teach you?\nWhat was -- what di -- what did they say was expected of you in America and did\nsomething of that strike you as odd or different, unusual?",
        "Q: Well, really the -- the underlying premise of Americanization was really democracy.\nYou see, a lot of us came from countries which were regimented, which -- I mean you\ndidn\u2019t ask questions, you were told and you obeyed. And of course, having lived under\nthe Germans, not only did you obey, you -- you feared for your life every second and you\nhad to obey. So that coming from a structure -- a political structure of pre-war Europe\ninto American democracy could really be a shock. Because I mean, you can get up and\ntell jokes in the class and I had a -- a -- apropos of that I have tell a velly funny -- a very\nfunny thing I always -- this an anecdote, I always tell it. | had a Mr. Jaffe for -- he was a\nvery elegant little man, you know, with a vest and pinned up and really proper. And Mr.\nJaffe was sort of -- he liked being humorous, but to an ex -- to just with bor -- with --\nwith limits. And we had a sort of a -- a wise guy type of fellow in the classroom and\nevery now and then he would pipe out -- of course I was offended. I mean, how can you\nstop the class? But Mr. -- Mr. Jaffe once said to him, \u201cDon\u2019t be a wise guy. I threw out\nDanny Kaye from my class and I can throw you out any time.\u201d Now -- of course, Danny\nKaye did go to Jefferson High School, but way before I got there. But the -- because he\nlived in that area. But, basically, you see, I was not used to this total freedom; freedom of\nexpression, freedom of -- of -- of -- of the being what you want and associating with wh -\n- with whoever you wanted to associate with. And the basic English class was really you\n-- our introduction to democracy, on the very simple level. I -- we\u2019re not talking here\ntheories and big things, we are talking every day living, just like not kissing somebody\u2019s\nhand in the subway, is one of them, you know? And -- and being -- feeling free. Having a\npaper that doesn\u2019t look like everybody else\u2019s newspaper read in the subway, you could\ndo that. Didn\u2019t have to hide it -- you don\u2019t -- you know, you don\u2019t have to look behind\nyou or over your shoulder to see somebody spying on you, because this is not the type of\ncountry. And you\u2019re not going to be arrested by a policeman who will come and say,\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d And, \u201cShow me your ID.\u201d That can never happen here without cause.\nSo, this was part of the -- of that basic English, which was acculturation, introduction to\nAmerican democracy, but I -- I -- I am really -- it -- it isn\u2019t all that formal, you know. I\u2019m\njust giving you the overall idea, because it was really rather loosely presented to us, not\nas a rule, with a -- wi-with a question -- with an exclamation mark at the end. It was just\nsimply put.",
        "Q: This is the end of side A of tape one interview with Regina Gelb. We\u2019re going to stop\nnow and switch over.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning of Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number one, side B. The next question would be -- I remember\nyou saying -- and it also comes out in the way you explained just the -- the things before,\nthat you were very hungry for life and you were very excited about the opportunities\noffered now. But in mingling with other students at the school or with other refugees or\nHolocaust survivors, did you talk about the war experiences at all, or was that put aside?",
        "A: If [remember correctly, I don\u2019t think we did. Because, you see, first of all we assumed\nthat -- each one of us assumed -- one was Polish, one was Hungarian, one was French and\nwhatever it was, we knew we re -- I personally was not interested in any other stories. I\nknew everybody had a story to tell. I had plenty of stories to tell. I didn\u2019t want to live\nthose stories, I didn\u2019t want to hear the other stories. Besides, I didn\u2019t have the time. We\nwere kept so busy. We were kept -- don\u2019t forget, lang -- fa -- English was a foreign\nlanguage to us and we had to study subjects such as history and others. Economics,\nwhich was -- I never studied ec -- American economics, or economics at all in Poland. Or\nCivics. And this required a lot of work. Plus the fact that each one of us had some other\nobligation after school. You know, I think I mentioned it before, I lived with Miles and\nKris, I kept house, I shopped for food and so on. I also had a job in the ORT\norganization\u2019s office on Fifth Avenue, where I had to travel after school. And then I had\nto -- I -- I -- I did absolutely stupid things there, I did filing and you know, but again, this\nwas a kind of a job that they gave me because Dr. Karpen\u2019s wife was the head of the\noffice. She was the head of the ORT, American ORT organization. Her name was\nGertrude Karpen. And for me to earn this extra little money, I cannot imagine that I could\ndo any more then than file. But I was a filing clerk, I knew the alphabet. So that was fine.\nAnd all the other kids had obligations as well. Don\u2019t forget they were more or less in my\nshoes, so to say. They had either families and they also had to scramble around to do a\nlittle something to sustain themselves so that we basically compared notes pertaining to\nthe education and to the school. And also, we got to be friendly with the Jewish kids --\nJewish kids, a lot of Jewish kids from the area. That was a blue collar Jewish section in\nthose days. So we made wonderful friends among the Jewish kids who were normal, so\nto say. Amer -- Jewish American kids. So, all this really t-to just sum it up, didn\u2019t -- this\nlife in Jefferson did not fit with sitting there comparing notes, \u201cDid you go to Auschwitz?\nNo, I didn\u2019t go to Auschwitz, I went to Ravensbrick.\u201d That was past, that was water\nunder the bridge, you know? Here we were, all these things were required of us, we were\nall willing and as I also mentioned before, a lot of these kids became academicians. They\ntaught all over the United States, professorship here and professor -- and everybody --\none wa -- most of these kids went to college and graduated from college. So that you see,\nwe were more or less on that same level of -- of trying to get on with life in an -- this new\nway, excelling educationally. Find a place in this new world and who wants to talk about\nthis old stuff? You know, that was then and so this is basically -- for example, Miss Hay\nused to invite us to ca -- to tea. She was a sort of former -- I think she was Irish by -- by --\nfrom the fam -- anyhow, she used to invite us to tea, served beautifully, elegantly, with\nbeautiful china cups. Not all of u -- them, but she had her favorites. So she had about four\nor five of us and we used to go to tea in her house, properly served with the napkins and\nthe napkin rings and it was fantastic. You see, now those are all these extra things that\nthese teachers went out of their way to -- to -- to -- to -- to do for us. But also, I might\nadd, since I was so friendly with Miss Hay for all those years after -- til af -- til the time\nshe died, she told me, \u201cYou know, Regina, I never, ever had a class like yours after your\nclass left -- after your class graduate.\u201d She said it so many times and that is a fact,\nbecause this was a very special group and -- and I must tell you that -- that there must\nhave been some kind of a spirit in these kids, for everybody to be so -- not just winning, I\nmean they -- everybody went out of his way to -- to accommodate us, to do for us, to -- to\nfind us jobs. To -- to -- so this 1s really -- this was a wh -- what is called a lucky break.",
        "Q: Well [indecipherable] eventually you moved on to Brooklyn College?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I would like to quote something back to you. You said in the first interview, that\nyour knowledge of the war until then was very personal, because obviously you were sort\nof in the eye of the storm. But now, when you went to Brooklyn College that you were\nquote, \u201cReally ready to go after the historical aspects of how things happened.\u201d So that\nyou were interested in the broader context of the war. And the question, how did you do\nthat? Did you get formal education, did you talk to people about things? How did you\nlearn about it and -- and what did you learn? Was there something surprising? It\u2019s a big\nquestion, I know.",
        "A: Well, everything was surprising, for the reason that I, for example, didn\u2019t know that\nthe -- that the eastern part of Poland was evacuated before the -- before German\noccupation -- no, I -- I\u2019m not expressing it correctly. After Germ -- after the Germans\noccupied Poland, Stalin -- th-th-the Russians occupied eastern Poland. I knew that, but I\ndid not realize that a lot of the natives -- not a lot, the majority of the natives, Jews or\nChristians were evacuated deep into Russia. I only found out about it in Berlin when\npeople came to live in the DP camp, having come from Russia. \u201cWhat do you mean from\nRussia? You speak Polish. You come from Voofe, you come from Vilna, you come --\nhow did you?\u201d Well, they came out of Russia because they were evacuated en masse.\nApparently, the Soviets were planning to -- to get rid of the native population in order to -\n- to -- to resettle it with their own, or however. So you see, that was the first thing that -- I\nstarted finding out these things. Was very easy, of course, to -- to -- to read books. I\nstarted also taking courses that pertained to -- to -- to history that -- that wasn\u2019t -- you\nknow, like I knew everything after the first war, I knew all that stuff. But after that, I\ndidn\u2019t know much, you know. So I started finding out. And then I found out that the\nPolish government -- there was a Polish government in exile, in -- in -- in England during\nthe war. And then I started finding out all the other things, the atrocities of the Russians.\nAnd being -- I\u2019m always very curious about things and I know how to get -- how to find\nthings in books, I always knew that, so it was always very easy, even if I studied\nsomething else. I did take history courses in college and European political theory and all\nthis. I took it, but while I was doing my homework, I always knew how to go after that\none s -- one something that I just discovered. For example, the -- the Cutting Forest\nmassacre I just discovered. I went to look for it, I found it, you know. And -- and -- and\nlittle by little, the -- the -- the invasion -- the Normandy invasion, the -- the Pearl Harbor.\nI did not know those things. I did not know about Pearl Harbor. I mean, I knew it, but it\nwas so sketchy, it was just an id -- something I knew, but -- so -- and -- and how -- how\nthe allies cooperate, I knew how to find it and of course I started reading papers. In fact,\nin Brooklyn College, the tea -- the political science teacher told us -- she rec -- she\nexpected every one of us to read the New York Times, every day. And she didn\u2019t mean in\na jokingly and she said, \u201cAnother thing, before the course is over, every one of us has to\nread the American constitution 12 times.\u201d Now, I am not talking about refugee children, I\nam talking about the regular course in Political Science. Those were her two\nrequirements. One was you must read it 12 times to be able to understand it and before\nthe course 1s over, you will have to know it sideways and upside down. And you have to\nread the New York Times every day. And I did. So, I -- I -- I was always curious, you\nsee, I was always curious. All of a sudden I found out another detail about the war and\nthen another detail, then of course the Nuremberg trials, you know. That sort of opened a\nwhole -- a whole new field to me that -- that I really didn\u2019t know. And then of course I\ndidn\u2019t know too much about Italy, Fascist Italy and I wanted to find out about that. And I\n-- so, little by little the puzzle got put together, because I searched, I really searched and I\n-- and I filled it in and --",
        "Q: I -- I meant to ask you the question, did you learn anything that changed your\nunderstanding of the war, but that would be wrong in a sense, because you just began to\nreally learn about the political framework, right? Or was there anything --",
        "A: Well, you know, the idea of war, to me, when I -- when I -- when -- when second war\nfirst started, was that this was just a military engagement, you know, that soldiers fight\nand soldiers get killed. And of course all this was based on the first war, not personal\nexperience, but my knowledge of the first war, from books or from my parents, who lived\nthrough the first war. Second war was a totally different thing, because it wasn\u2019t just that\nthey were bombing civilians, but it was -- 1t came to pass that they were exterminating\npeople for being Jewish. And that -- that was something that -- I mean, not only\nincomprehensible, but unbelievable and people wouldn\u2019t admit it and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve\nmentioned it in the other tapes, but I always talk about it. To this day, I had no idea what\nmy parents knew, how much they knew, what they knew, but I do know that they did\nhide a lot from us. In fact, they hid everything from us, because they nev -- I never knew\nthe truth of -- and I suspect that they knew a whole lot of things. Of the atrocities that\nwere going on. You know, my parents perished in the Holocaust, but even during the\nghetto years and all this, I am sure they knew a lot, because there were people coming\nand going and reporting what\u2019s happening here and there -- never, ever was I let in on\nwhat was happening. And of course I saw with my own eyes, plenty, so maybe they felt\nit\u2019s bad enough for a child to see and experience here, but not yet to live with the fear of\nwhat is really happening somewhere else, which is probably not true. That was the\nattitude. It couldn\u2019t be true, because such a thing couldn\u2019t be true, you know, that you\ntake groups of people and you burn them or you gas them. So that\u2019s just gossip and\nduring the war, there\u2019s so much gossip, so why burden a child with this type of talk? So\nyou see, my idea of -- of war, after 1t was o -- after the second war was all over, was\nreally that it brought out the beast in the human being. It had nothing to do with land, you\nknow, reclaiming your land one way or another. It was nothing to do with fighting for the\n-- for your culture or for your moral standards. It was just the opposite. It was just a\nbeastly expression of a human nature, which unfortunately fell within the new technology\nand it found it\u2019s expression in annihilating by the youth of new technology and not the\narmed conflict of countries, but of just people being eliminated. So this was basically my\nunderstanding of -- of -- you know, after all was said and done and I start -- started\nreading history, it go -- just confirmed what I have already experienced, that this was not\na war like any other war. That I knew Napoleonic wars and Franco -- the German war\nand this war and that war, that -- those were wars that th -- the Crimean war -- this war\nwas nothing like it and of course the -- having confirmed it by studies, further studies, it -\n- it just reinforced by so many more ho-horrendous details of things that I really didn\u2019t\nknow. History f -- the -- that I got -- the history of the second war, that I got out of books,\nreally built on my own understanding. So it sort of rounded it out and I came away with -\n- precisely with the same concept as I had originally, before I read all the books and filled\nin the gaps, you see.",
        "Q: Now, amidst all of this personal growth, expansion of -- of knowledge -- being busy\nall the time, did you ever allow yourself to mourn for your parents, for those who have\ngone, or did you make a point of -- of not doing that?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t mourn very inwardly, and of course --",
        "Q: You were still very young.",
        "A: Yes. First of all, we observe the Yourtside. This is -- Yourtside is the -- you know, the\ncommemoration of the people who passed on on the day when they passed on. Obviously\nI could not have a date for the -- for the -- for the mourning -- official mourning. But I did\njoin the group of people from Starachowice who were in New York. And they\nestablished a Yourtside service and a -- a gathering of all the people from the hometown.\nWhy? Because -- I think it was in Israel that a day was picked for a Yourtside for all the\npeople from Starachowice, to be observed on the same day, meaning the day when the\ntown was cleared of Jews. And before -- because my father died in Auschwitz, sometimes\nin October, two years after my mother died with the owseedum -- with the -- when the\ntown was liquidated, we decided that -- I decided -- everybody else decided that we still\nstick to this date, that\u2019s October 27th. So I light a candle all the time on October 27th and\nwe have annual gatherings of that Starachowice society. So we get together and prayers\nare said and in those days the group was much larger, I don\u2019t have to tell you. Kris and\nMiles, when they were in New York, they would go and prayers were said and then the\nmorning prayers were said and then there was coffee and cake and so on, a little\nsocializing. So we did that once a year. And so that was the official mourning, but of\ncourse, I missed my parents a whole lot. But you know, I was thinking about it. If I were\nstill in Poland, I probably would have missed them much more because they were -- they\nfit into the -- into the setting. Here, I was sort of on my own, you know? I had Kris and\nMiles, of course, but after they moved away, I was really on my own and I knew that I\nabsolutely cannot depend on having my mother help me out or my father help me out,\nyou see? I always missed them, you know, I always missed them. I grieved for the fact\nthat there was no cemetery that I could go to. That bothered me and it bothers me to this\nday. That I had -- if I had a place where I knew they were, I would -- of course in those\ndays, I couldn\u2019t take trips, but eventually I would get to that place. But mother went to\nTreblinka and father perished in Auschwitz, so where is the place? There is no place. And\nthe fact that we do observe October 27th -- I do, to this day, as the mourning for -- for my\nparents and for my hometown. And you know, here and there, we -- I donated money in\nIsrael to have the -- my parents name inscribed on a monument in the cem -- Jewish\ncemetery. Also in Canada, my sister showed me when we were in Canada just last year --\nand she showed me on the Jewish cemetery, there is a monument with names inscribed of\nthe Holocaust victims who perished in the Holocaust. And this was done by the\nsurvivors, SO my parents names [indecipherable]. I\u2019m just very glad about that. So we\nhave the name in Toronto -- my parent\u2019s name on the -- on the monument, and also in\nIsrael. So that is -- that I feel good about. And the fact, of course that the observance --\nthat we observe, with the -- with the commun -- the survivor\u2019s community, of whom\nthere\u2019s -- as you know, the ranks are thinning, so --",

        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: I would just like to ask you a quick, personal follow up on this one, because it just\noccurred to me that at that time, you seemed to feel quite strong and that you really\nwanted to move ahead. Did you allow yourself moments of weakness, or of rage even?\nDid you feel --",
        "A: Rage? Probably not. I am, by nature, very optimistic and I\u2019m sort of serious, but I --\nrage? No, that\u2019s not an expression of -- no. Things are more internalized with me, so that\nif anything, I grieved, you know, I think a lot. I think a lot, I mean, I probably, if I had a -\n- if I had a terrific problem, I would probably have sleepless nights, because my head\nwould be running and running and running. But that -- whenever -- I wouldn\u2019t go break a\nchair or hit somebody or -- or curse. I -- it\u2019s just in -- not in -- it\u2019s not my make-up, so to\nsay. I always wonder if that could be because I was the youngest and I was always\nspoiled, so I sort of -- you know, I was sort of singled out by my parents and oh, you\u2019re\nso good and you\u2019re so this, so may -- maybe that stayed with me. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t\nsay, but Ill tell you no, rage is -- rage at what was? No.",
        "Q: Well, maybe rage is not a good word, I guess. Let me rephrase this.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What I also meant was -- did you ever feel -- 1t\u2019s -- did you feel f -- that you wanted --\nwith regard to Germans, vengeance -- feelings of vengeance or --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Or anger?",
        "A: Yes anger, but you know, vengeance -- first of all, vengeance doesn\u2019t accomplish\nanything. What was done was done and what you do now, as a vengeful act, does not\nundo what was done. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a fact. Second 1s that if you are analytical and you\nreally follow the thread, you -- in my case, I could never accept the fact that what\nhappened was going to determine the entire course of my life, which I haven\u2019t lived yet.\nSo, you see, I -- probably that was a kind of a determination, not that I didn\u2019t have\nnightmares and -- and sleepless nights and all kinds of physical the -- th -- manifestations\nof an inner conflict. But on the outside, I most certainly did not dwell on any vengeance.\nI just felt that the Germans will probably eventually come around to understanding in\ntheir own way, what a horrible, horrible thing they did, that was unprecedented, that was\nunimaginable, that was beyond and -- above and beyond the human un -- human\nunderstanding, you know, that -- because, as I was saying before, this wasn\u2019t a war like\nthe other wars, like the Crimean war, like this war, there -- where there was shooting\nbetween soldiers and there was armistice and the war was over. This was something that I\nwas not going to allow to destroy my life, because my parents were -- my home was\ndestroyed, my parents were killed, we were lucky enough to survive. And -- and there\nwas life to be lived and -- and I wasn\u2019t going to worry about the Germans -- what was I\ngoing to take a gun and go to Germany and shoot somebody? On the other hand, what\nwas I going to do, sit home and brood and -- and ruin my life and get more nightmares\nand more -- I couldn\u2019t do that either. So thinking very logically and realistically, I\nimagined this is the conclusion I reached. And the fact that I really was very busy. I was\nvery busy, so that I rather took it as an excuse, you know, I'll think about it tomorrow.\nNot about my parents, but about the whole idea. And, as I told you before, that when I\nfinally got the -- the book knowledge about the war and put it all together, it did not\nchange my original understanding, which was personal and on a lower level. It just\nenhanced it. But my conclusion concerning the Germans was still the same. I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to get a gun and shoot them. I wasn\u2019t going to get myself sick, just immobilized by\n-- by the kind of fear I used to experience every single day of my life. I haven\u2019t lived yet.\nI wanted book knowledge, I wanted to have fun. I wanted to be a girl and go dancing and\ndo things and I wasn\u2019t going to allow that to f -- to -- to -- to -- to get in my way. And\nthat -- that is really how it was and -- and -- I -- I was grateful that my personality was\nsuch that it allowed me -- not to forget it, you don\u2019t ever forget it. You don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t\nforget anything, especially I don\u2019t forget anything. I mean, I have everything under a\nzipper in the back of the head. I have all kinds of things stored in there, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that I need to go around and curse God for what happened. Shoot the Germans for\nwhat happened. It already happened, so --",

        "Q: And that you found that quite shocking.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you room?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, because I was assi -- I told -- I told them assign me however -- wherever\nthere is a vacancy. The fact 1s, I did not come in September, I came in October, by which\ntime the school was already -- you -- everything was settled and I told them wherever\nthere is a vacancy and you can place me there, please do. Of course, the way it turned out\nwas that they -- had I had a black girl, I would have thanked God, because the one that I\nhad was the messiest girl ever, that I ever, ever, ever lived with. And it was so horrendous\nthat she used to have papers on the floor and you couldn\u2019t enter the room. So, I always\nsaid, \u201cFor heaven sakes, why didn\u2019t they give me a black girl?\u201d And of course, I couldn\u2019t\nlive with her any more than one semester -- through the end of that semester and then I\nrequested a private room, because I couldn\u2019t take it. I had all that work to do, the library\nclosed at 11. I never, ever -- we had curfew in the dormitory, so I could only be in the\nlibrary to 11, but I couldn\u2019t work -- you know, I couldn\u2019t work in the house, because I\njust couldn\u2019t be in that -- in that -- 1t was a tiny room, with -- you know, but she was on\nthe upper bunk, I was on the lower, you know, bunk beds? And the piles of dirty laundry,\nof clean laundry. I mean it was horrendous. She was a girl from Gary, Indiana. We got\nalong very well, because we were sort of cordial, but I -- I absolute -- I mean, anyhows,\nto answer your question, I took what I was assigned, because that was October and it was,\nyou know, the school was on already. The first part of your -- oh, yeah, of the McCarthy\nera. Yes?",
        "Q: Maybe we can sort of --",
        "A: Yes --",
        "Q: -- come back to that later, because I do want to ask you to -- they also asked you what\nyour religion was?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Did you -- you too -- you -- you -- you said Jewish?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And the follow-up question would be, did you feel any particular responses among\nyour students then, to you, as a -- as a Jewish person, or --",
        "A: My students?",
        "Q: No, not -- did they know?",
        "A: No, no. First of all, the housing was -- religion was import -- in the housing, for the\nhousing application. Those were the two questions asked on the housing application, not\nthe school application. Whether I would room with a black girl and whether I was Jew --\nwhat was my religion? Apparently they did not mean it the way I took it, because they\nmeant, if you\u2019re Catholic, maybe you\u2019d like to be with a Catholic girl, go together to\nmass. Or if you\u2019re Jewish, you might want to observe Yom Kippur when the others --\nthat was a very innocent question, but -- you see, in those days I was drunk on American\ndemocracy. You see, I felt that everything here was -- not that it was permissible, but all\nthose restrictions, all those qualifications, are you this or are you this or were you -- 1s\nyour father Jewish, or -- that all that didn\u2019t apply here, you see, so my shock was based\nmore on my misunderstanding of their -- of their real purpose. They wanted you to be\ncompatible with the person that you were going to be with. I took it on the other hand as\nan expression of something from the past, where I always had to say that I was Jewish,\nwhere I always -- you see? Where everybody was differentiated, you were Jewish so you\nwere this and this was a Catholic and there was the other thing, so that it shows you that\nonce in America, I -- I probably -- this -- this idea of democracy probably wasn\u2019t yet\nformulated will enough for me to understand that this was not a very personal question.",
        "Q: This is the end of tape one, side B and I think it\u2019s the garbage truck in the back.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Seven, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number two, side A and we are still in Indiana. You mentioned\nin your earlier interview, that you could, in -- in your own teaching process, you could\nchoose any conversational topic that you wanted to. Is there an example? Did you pick\nanything --",
        "A: Well, let me just tell you this. The program was run by the linguistics department. The\nstudents were all Air Force officers. The languages taught were Serbo-Croatian, there\nwas Polish, there was Russian. If I remember, Ukrainian possibly. Now, we had a\nsyllabus that we followed. We wrote our own textbook, with the head of the linguistics\ndepartment. And of course grammar was taught, Polish language you know, has\ndeclensions and conjugations, so there\u2019s plenty of grammar to learn, much more than\nthere is in the English language. But in order to make it more accessible to these people,\nwho were after all going to be stationed in a foreign country, where they would have to\ngo and buy a container of milk and then be on a bus and overhear a conversation of\npeople who are talking about wheat and baking bread, or whatever. Therefore, the\nconversation slot, that unit of time that was devoted to conversation, was to be as if you --\nfrom the teachers -- instructor\u2019s viewpoint, meaning myself, as if I was talking to\nsomebody n -- to another native, on any subject. Of course, I like to make it interesting.\nAs I probably mentioned, or maybe I didn\u2019t, I never, ever discussed the war -- the -- they\nknew I was Jewish, they knew I had a number, I was in Auschwitz, they knew I lost my\nparents. They knew th-the general information about me. They knew I came to Indiana\nsolely because I was given this job. And to make the conversations interesting, first of all\nI had a unit of time specifically designated for conversation and of course, now that I\u2019m a\ntranslator, this was the so-called Monterey rec -- Monterey system was -- Monterey,\nCalifornia had a language school and they were just developing this new idea, that\nlearning a language is best to -- to hear the music. You see, language is based on an\nintonation, so that if you are attuned to the music of the language, you will absorb it\nfaster than learning all the -- the -- the irregular verbs and the -- the -- the what --\nwhatever. So I was told to pick a subject, to tell them a story. Not in a simple language\nwhere I would have to go overboard finding simple. Simply as if I were telling anything\nto somebody else who 1s native, after which time, I should just have -- what do you think\n-- let\u2019s say I was talking about a goat that got lost, whatever, something like. What do\nyou think would happen after this was over? What would you think was -- would happen\nto that goat that got lost on the ro -- in the same pattern of speech which I delivered my\nlittle story. And they had to answer me, however ridiculous the answer was -- 1n their\nown way, for me to judge how much understanding of native -- of the native speech\npattern they had. And that was very interesting because I was free to pick subjects, you\nknow, so if it was something interesting that came up 1n school, I told them about that. If\nthere was something -- of course they knew that I was engaged to Victor and Victor was\nin -- in the -- in uniform and he used to come and visit me, so one day I told him a -- told\nthem about Victor and I wanted to double check whether they remember -- and they, you\nknow, so that was -- that was also a way of -- I had to report, you know, to the\ndepartment there -- the absorption level of the language. And I was told later -- of course\nI\u2019m in touch with these people, they\u2019re very nice people, especially one of them, through\nyears and years, we visit, we write. Anyhow, I was told that those were very good, fun\nthings to do. Because basically, that\u2019s what they had to do, they had to go behind the Iron\nCurtain and they had to be -- they were charge d\u2019 affairs for this and all kinds of other\nthings. And they had to deal with natives. And I apparently had yet, the natives music in\nthe -- in -- in the -- in the speech, so that that was worthwhile and I thought that was a\nvery good part of the -- of the program. Of course, that wasn\u2019t my idea, you know, that\nwas all included in the syllabus and decided by the linguistics department, because this\nwas done for all these other languages, you see, that were taught.",
        "Q: But -- but speaking of native, you were a native of -- Poland was your birth country?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And at that time, it was becoming, because it was the Cold War era, sort of\nstereotyped many times. Did that reflect in any way back on you? Talking now not about\nthe people you taught, but about the other people you might --",
        "A: You -- you mean stereotyped during the Cold War?",
        "Q: -- as a -- you\u2019d be, as -- as a -- as a Polish?",
        "A: Stereotyped during the Cold War?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, not among the people that I came across with. First of all, you know, Poland\nwas never incorporated into Russia. They were a satellite country during the 50 years of\nRussian regime. The Poles were fiercely opposed -- by then I als -- also knew history,\nyou see? They were fiercely opposed to the Russian government for years and years and\nthere was no such thing as Poland being willingly in the satellite orbit. The people that I -\n- | live and de-dealt with -- I never came across an expression that the Poles are\nCommunists. You see, because basically they were not. The Poles were basically, fiercely\nindependent and they expected to be liberated, period, after the second war. But they\nwere not liberated, and that is -- of course it\u2019s all historical, convoluted chain of events,\nbetween Yalta and --and Stalin being who he was and -- and the Yalta agreement actually\nenslaved Poland for 50 years, but that\u2019s another story. The -- the point 1s that the people\nthat I knew never, ever held it against me that I repre -- I was representing some -- that\nthis was a Cold War and I was representing any kind of Communist type of thing,\nbecause basically, 1-1f I may just venture a guess, the reason that the American\ngovernment was interested in sending people in there, was to really determine, are they\nturning Communist or are they staying quietly, but -- but fighting it? And this 1s exactly\nhow it really was. And I -- I even knew it much later, when Victor and I went in 1980,\nwhen we went to Poland and I had friends and I was visiting. So one friend told me,\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak in the hotel room to your husband, about anything.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do we\nthink -- what do we wa -- what are going to --\u201d She says, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. There are\nmicrophones in the walls there. Don\u2019t speak to your friends, don\u2019t speak in the taxis,\ndon\u2019t speak --\u201d I mean, they put the fear of God in me, because what I knew and I was in\nIndiana was still true in 1980, before Solidarity, you see, that there was all pervasive\nCommunist -- well, what would you call it, a -- the -- the Communist grip on Poland was\nvery strong, but underneath, it wasn\u2019t, you see? This 1s how the warnings came. And --\nand I knew that when I was in Indiana, because the Cold War was -- this wasn\u2019t just the\n50\u2019s, so the war wasn\u2019t over even 10 years yet, you see. And -- and there was still hope\nmaybe Poland would sneak out from under, but of course it never did and then\nCzechoslovakia and all, so basically that was not at -- or -- an issue, ever. Not from\npeople who I dealt with, not from people whom I met and referred to me as Polish native,\nor whatever. Never, never.",
        "Q: You were intoxicated by American democracy --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- at one time, in your own words. But did you also become aware of some particular,\npeculiar American prejudices maybe, for the first time, or --",
        "A: Well, I, for example, did not realize that the blacks were oppressed in this country. I\nreally didn\u2019t know it, I must admit. I knew that they were slaves at one time, that they\ncame on ships from Africa. I knew that they were freed by Lincoln. And I knew that there\nwas still discrimination in the south, because I knew that there was such a thing as\nbathrooms for blacks or whites, separately -- public bathrooms. And water fountains,\npublic water fountains, but no, I -- I really didn\u2019t see it, or maybe I didn\u2019t want to see it or\nmaybe -- you see, I just didn\u2019t know enough of -- of America in that sense, because I was\nstill circulating in another sphere, so to say. I was still in the academic world, you see?\nAnd I had no access, truly. I heard that there was an incident in Indiana once, but I -- wi-\nwith a person in my class, that we experienced discrimination in the restaurant, but I -- I\njust didn\u2019t feel that that was America, you know? I had an idea of America, ideal\nAmerica. So I -- even if I did see a -- a little expression of something or other, I didn\u2019t\ntake it as the expression of -- of America as I wanted to see it -- as I saw it. In fact, I saw\nit that way, because that\u2019s how I saw reality in those days.",
        "Q: You did give a -- a good impression of what -- or you have started to give a very li-\nlively impression, I think, of what America meant for you, but could you be -- maybe just\ngive one more example of what you meant with the ideals of America? What was -- was\nit -- what -- how was it different from being Polish?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t different from being Polish, 1t was different from where I came from.\nAnd that includes my war experiences in Germany and everything else, you see? Being\nPolish is something else. It\u2019s very much connected to my childhood and to very\nwonderful life with my parents and my family. That is what I mean by being Polish. But\nbeing European is what I was, really. Being European in the sense that I felt the brunt of\nGerman culture and I experienced the bestiality. So that was now part and parcel of\nEurope for me. And, though I know it wasn\u2019t, but it was, because that was my personal\nlife. So when I came here, and I told you I found out all these things, that you are free to\nread the paper and you are free to express yourself and you can get up and disagree with\nyour teacher in the classroom and all these things that you could do that were absolutely -\n- that they had no repercussions. That they were -- you weren\u2019t going to be shot or killed\nor sent in the prison, or whatever. That was -- it\u2019s a -- like a -- like an explosion of the\nmind, to me. It was not directly connected to my being Polish. It was connected to my\noverall background -- European background until I came here.",
        "Q: Now we will be jumping ahead again, for quite a few years, I think, or quite a few\nyears. You had a family, you were having a family now at this point that we are jumping\nto. And I do remember that you very vividly expressed sort of dislike for the counter-\nculture of the 60\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "Q: And there was some concern with regard -- were you concerned that your -- that your\nown children might go in a similar direction and if so, how did you teach them limits?\nHow do you teach, how di -- did you try to counteract that?",
        "A: Yes, okay, let me start from the general and come to the specific. I came out of Europe\nfrom chaos. From everything being turned upside-down, from everything being torn up\nfor an idea that the Germans had of -- of -- the hedanfolk and -- and all that. And I came\nto America, I was intoxicated with this idea that this can never happen here. And all of a\nsudden, in the 60\u2019s, not that it in any way compared to Nazi Germany\u2019s planned and --\nand organized -- and -- and -- and -- and specified the -- horrible deeds. This was all --\nthis was all in flux, but I suspected that the culture, as I have come to understand it, was\nbeing torn apart by this kind of an expression, which I took to be the other extreme, you\nsee? Whereas the first extreme was the organization -- no, perfection of the Nazis, here\nyou had a total disruption of everything, without a central idea, nevertheless, disrupting.\nYou asked me how I did wi -- how the children -- yeah. I have -- since my husband was\nworking and I was sort of call -- the mother at home, I had the idea that I wanted my\nchildren to have self-discipline, and I stuck to it. Wi -- They knew they were loved, they\nknew they were -- they weren\u2019t indulged to a point, but everything was very logical. In\nother words, if I said to a child, \u201cYou know, you have to put on your shoes, these shoes\ntoday, because the radio said it\u2019s going to be stormy later.\u201d Whatever quote unquote\norder I gave the child, there was always, immediately, why. I always explained why you\nneed to do it, why you must do it. You went to a restaurant, there are other people there,\nyou cannot be disruptive, you cannot be loud, you cannot be in and in and under the\ntable. We went to a hotel -- French hotel in the Catskills. People used to get dressed for\ndinner. The children had to be dressed for dinner, with their little bow tie. They knew it.\nCame dinner time, they had to be dressed, that was it. Otherwise we don\u2019t go there. If you\nwant to go there, you like it there? Yes, I do. Well, if you do, then you have to do what 1s\nexpected of you. And I wasn\u2019t shy about punishing. And I punished the child if he\ndisobeyed and the consequences were bad. I would take away the bicycle for a week, you\ncan\u2019t ride the bicycle for a week, you see? You were supposed to do other -- something\nor other, that was canceled. So that eventually the discipline -- our younger son Paul\nalways tells me, cause he\u2019s a free spirit, he says, \u201cYou know, that was really very good.\u201d\nAlso the fact that the homework, when they were submitting homework, the -- public\nschool. I would tear up the homework if I thought it was messy. You know, it was a\nhomework assignment, a page and a half, so he -- 10 o\u2019clock at night he scribbles out the\nhomework and it looks like a dog wrote it. So I would say no, I was a teacher once, too. I\nwould not accept homework looked like that. Even if 1t was the best homework in the\nworld, the smartest, you don\u2019t hand in anything that looks so sloppy. Was torn up, he had\nto write it again. And there was always the reason, you see? There was always a reason\nfor doing things. It wasn\u2019t the imperial, \u201cI said so.\u201d It sounded imperial to the child, but\nhe had no -- and because I was with the children most of the time, what I said, went. And\nthe fact is that they had many, many friends and they went to school next door, so every\nchild was allowed to bring a friend for lunch. And I had assignments, Wednesday was\nMelanie and Tuesday was Willy Popper and everyb -- you know, so there were -- the\nhouse was always open to friends, always. And that -- I told you, by appointment, every\nWednesday belonged to another kid that they brought from school. Black kids, white\nkids, Jewish kids, any kids that they chose to bring. So they never felt deprived of\nsomething that they wanted to do. They knew that we are there and they knew that we are\nvery reasonable. You see, that we don\u2019t order things without a basis for ordering it. And\nto this day, my older son, who now has children, you know, he disciplines the older -- the\nboy -- the older boy, the nine year old. And apparently something stayed with him,\nbecause I do believe in self-discipline. I believe that you know you have to discipline\nyour mind to -- to -- for it to find the expression in your daily living. You know, if you\nhave to do homework, you have to do it. If it\u2019s already too late, you still have to do it.\nYou have to do it, you have to be on the job at nine o\u2019clock. Can\u2019t be there five after\nnine, you know? If somebody expects you to do something, it has to be done. This is self-\ndiscipline and the parent isn\u2019t around forever to tell you so. If it\u2019s ingrained, it stays.",

She went to Brooklyn\nCollege at night for courses, psychology, this and the other thing. And she had a friend\nwho was a secretary to Victor\u2019s father. Victor\u2019s family had a textile business. So one day,\nthe secretary in the office told Victor that she is going to Brooklyn College to see -- he\ngraduated from Brooklyn College, but way before. He graduated in 1949, when I was\nfirst graduating from high school. Anyhow, so she said, there is this fantastic course she\nis taking and they are going to show a certain film, if he wants to go. So he went with her,\nhe drove her to Brooklyn College and after the film was shown, where this friend of mine\nwas, Victor drove both ladies home. So he first dropped off this one woman, Cecile and\nthen he came to drop off Fella. And Fella said to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and say\nhello? I have -- my father is there, I have a friend living with us.\u201d So he came in and there\nI was. I didn\u2019t look for him, I didn\u2019t chase him. He was -- I was there and he walked in.\nAnd so we got to know each other. And I used to have a lot of friends, male friends, boy\nfriends. I used to love dancing, so I used to go dancing with one boyfriend. I had all\nkinds, really. I had a -- a rogue\u2019s gallery album full of these guys. And then Victor\nwalked in and then he lived not very far from that. So, every now and then we used to\nmeet. We went to a -- to the opera, we went to -- his family had a subscription to the\nMetropolitan, so we -- we had tickets. Anyhow, we -- we did a lot of cultural things, we\nwent out to dinner and -- he knew about me, I mean as much as -- as he want -- as --\nagain, like the way it happened with the children. I told him some and I told him, if\nyou\u2019re interested in anything else, tell me and I\u2019Il tell you. I -- not going to sit here, bore\nyou about things that -- 1f you want to know, I'll tell you anything. Well, this is how it\nhappened. And then he was drafted in 1950, in the Korean war, he was drafted and went\nto -- upstate to Watertown. And that same year I went to Indiana. So he started coming --\nwe used to meet in New York. He started coming there or we would meet in New York\nand then we got engaged and when I graduated, he came for the graduation and then we\ngot married, in New York. Of course we came back to New York to get married.",
        "Q: How did you feel -- just mentioned that he was in the Korean war. How did you feel\nabout that war and about Victor being in it?",
        "A: I was really -- I mean -- as far for -- I was worried about him, of course, but I just\ncouldn\u2019t understand, in those days, I just -- because, you know, this is 1950, this is only\nfive years, five short years. Of course now war has this other connotation in my mind,\nyou see? I said, \u201cFor heaven sakes, there is another war and nothing has been learned?\nNothing? It\u2019s --\u201d I -- of course I didn\u2019t understand about the war, anyhow. But I -- I\nabsolutely did not understand the war, Korean War, I didn\u2019t understand. Of course,\nKorean War now, as I know it, was really the -- a -- a piece of the larger picture of the\nCold War. But in those days, I absolutely didn\u2019t understand it. But I -- I worried about\nhim an -- a whole lot, I really did. But finally, he had a very good assignment, he\u2019s such a\nprecise man and he\u2019s so good at thing that are -- that require organization and precision,\nthat the -- he was placed in the headquarters in the Camp Drum, that\u2019s upstate New York\nin Watertown. And every time a sh -- and -- and of course the -- his boss was a general\nand the general loved to play golf. Once he found Victor, he could go play golf all day\nlong and Victor would -- everything would be perfect. So, whenever there was a --\nbecause this was a transitional camp for -- for -- before people were sent to -- to -- to\nKorea. So actually what happened 1s this, Victor was drafted and he went to -- in\nMassachusetts, what was the name of the camp? It will come to me. He came for basic --\nwent for basic training and after that he was sent to Camp Drum. And once he got settled\nin that headquarters, where he was the secretary to this general, the general didn\u2019t want to\nget rid of him, because he needed him to play golf. So Victor was sitting in the office and\nfor that he was never shipped up. As a matter of fact, whenever he requested a three day\npass to come to Indiana, he got it too. So, if I came home for Christmas to New York, he\nrequested a pass, and he got it, to come to New York, you see? So, that was very, very\nlucky, but the overall picture of -- of the Cold War and Korea, as it was in -- evolving,\nwas so far -- no, it wasn\u2019t foreign to me, but it was a -- I ust could not comprehend it.",
        "Q: Did Victor feel slightly different about it?",
        "A: About the Korean War? I don\u2019t know how he felt about the Korean war, except for the\nfact that he was drafted and he had to go and he -- he was sort of brought up in a well-to-\ndo family and he never experienced anything like the six weeks of basic training. What\nwas the name of the camp in Massachusetts? Whatever. So, after that, he came back, he\nwas hard like -- you know, hardened by the push-ups and by all that stuff. And in those\ndays, American boys still -- still felt very -- this was before the 60\u2019s -- strongly about\ndoing for the country that was asked of them. Well, he was drafted -- he didn\u2019t ask for it,\nhe was drafted, he was taken in. He put in his two years. He discharged at honorable\ndischarge. So that\u2019s how it was and that was not questioned in the 50\u2019s, such things. I\ncan\u2019t imagine that he would ever try to wiggle out of it, because he probably have --\nnever would think of it. This 1s how it was and he did it. He was just lucky, knock wood,\nthat because he is so efficient in an office setting, that the guy knew whom he had, him,\nand Victor, by virtue of that was -- wa -- never went to Korea.",
        "Q: What was your actual wedding like? You mentioned it, but --",
        "A: It was very private, just his family and Kris and Miles and their little daughter. That\nwas it. And we were married in the rabbi\u2019s study. The ra -- the family rabbi. His father\nwas quite ill, in fact his father died the same year that -- we were married in March, he --\nthe father died in November. The father was after seven strokes and it was just even\nquestionable if he was going to make it to the wedding, but he did. It was -- the marriage\nwas in the rabbi\u2019s study in Brooklyn. They were supporters of the Temple there and\neverything, so the rabbi accommodated us. And then we went out to dinner in a\nrestaurant and that was it. It had to be very low key for hi -- for his father\u2019s sake, but it\nwas also very low key by -- I would have pre -- I -- I preferred it that way, you know. I\nnever would think of having a big mar -- wedding for myself, never, ever.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: I don\u2019t like to be the center of attraction, that\u2019s number one. Number two, not having\nmy parents, I didn\u2019t think that I was going to feel good about being married. But the way\nit turned out, tha -- this didn\u2019t even come up. Because the question was, how to have a\nwedding where the father -- Victor\u2019s father can still make it. Well, he made it and that\nwas the best -- was very beautiful in that rabbi\u2019s study. You know, we had the\n[indecipherable] there in the -- it\u2019s beautiful, book lined study with oriental carpets. Was\nlovely, lovely and the family -- immediate family. And that was just the way I felt\ncomfortable about, because without my parents, I did not think I really would ever want\nto be a big -- in a big wedding. And for me that wasn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not my bag to place myself\nat the center. I don\u2019t like that, so --",
        "Q: Eventually you went back to Poland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Twice, actually?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I would like to ask you about the first time, how did you feel? How did it feel\ngoing back there?",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you frankly, before we went, I was scared. I was very scared. I did a lot\nof reading, of course I always do before I go on a trip, I read this and I read that, because\nwe ha -- I -- I didn\u2019t want to take Victor to Poland -- this was my trip with Victor, to\nburden him with -- to go and cry in Treblinka and the Holocaust and the -- and\nAuschwitz, I didn\u2019t want to do that. I wanted to make it a two prong thing. One part\nwould be that and going back to my hometown to see the very lovely Christian people\nwho were my parents friends and who really were instrumental in -- in pulling us through\nthe war, survive it -- helping in the surviving. And so we organized -- in fact I went to a\nPolish travel agency here, rather than American travel -- we went on our own, you know,\nnot with any group or anything. And I thought Victor ought to be exposed to Polish\nculture a little, because I\u2019m so -- you know, I -- I have it in my blood and -- and I -- \u2019m\nstill very much attached to Polish music, Polish literature and such, so I felt this is part of\nmy life that he\u2019s not part of at all. I mean, he hears me speak Polish, h-he doesn\u2019t know\nwhat it is about, but at least if he went with me so he would have a connection to where I\ncome from, even though he\u2019s by now half-Polish in the sense, because he\u2019s been exposed\n-- he goes with me to all these sympo -- the symposium here and a concert there and the -\n- and the Polish theater, there he goes and he loves it. But in those days -- now, this was\n1980, we were already -- 1980 we were already married many years, because we got\nmarried in \u00b053. I still did not want to make it a crying kind of experience. However, I\nreally feared for myself. I really, truly was scared the first time. I just didn\u2019t know how I\nwas going to react, because my memories were -- | -- I -- I felt maybe my childhood\nmemories all gone and what I will just remember is the horrible, not the good. But it\ndidn\u2019t turn out that way at all. I had no need to worry. I had everything arranged through\na Polish travel agent, exactly the type of itinerary that I wanted to have and it so\nhappened that once we got there, since I peak -- speak Polish, was very easy to have a\ntaxi driver take us to our -- to my hometown and do all these other things, plus go on a to\n-- take tours, you see? So that th -- the experience was wonderful. We do -- did go to\nAuschwitz, it was a very painful thing for me because -- well, we were part of a tour, so it\nwasn\u2019t very personal, you know\u201d? We were there with eight other people, or -- no, there\nwere eight all of -- the total was eight. We -- we took that bus from Warsaw to Krakow.\nWe stayed in a Krakow hotel, this was a group, see? And when we went to Auschwitz,\nthis tour guide -- we were the only two Jewish people, they took us to all these places,\nexcept to Birkenau, where I was. You see, I was in Birkenau in the camp, in -- in the\nbarracks. And she cracked some anti-Semitic jokes on the bus. You know, she was\njoking. And I did not feel that that was tailored to me. This was tailored, this\n[indecipherable] in fact, just before we left, I said, \u201cI understand --\u201d we were done with\nthe visit. We went to see where Father Colba died and all this. And of course -- so I went\nout in a tower to see where the barracks were, but I never went into the barracks. So then\nwe were ready to leave, I said, \u201cI understand there\u2019s a Jewish museum here.\u201d She says,\n\u201cOh, yes, there 1s.\u201d I say, \u201cAren\u2019t we going in there?\u201d She says, \u201cNo. If you asked, we\nwould have gone.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m asking.\u201d So she took us to that Jewish museum and\nthere was Anne Frank and all the other and there was a book, so I signed the book and I -\n- and I said that my father perished there, that I survived. I wrote it in -- I think I wrote it\nin Polish and English. So that was not a very satisfactory experience. We did see a film\nbefore we went, you know, the -- you come, so this was an -- because this was an English\nspeaking tour, so we saw the film. The film gave me more than the tour itself. Course\nlater on I made up for it, but we\u2019re talking now with Victor, 1980. And a much more\nrewarding feeling was when we came to my hometown, because the old ladies were there\nand they prepared lunch for us and there was no -- there was such poverty there and there\nwas no -- there was no meat to by had for anything, why they needed meat I don\u2019t know,\nbut anyhow, she stayed at the -- one of these old ladies stood in line seven hours to get a\npiece of meat to make pirogue for us when we came. And of course I brought them stuff.\nI brought a whole suitcase there, you know, which I emptied. Full -- filled suitcase and\nthey stilled lived in the house that was -- had a crack from the bombs. Anyhow, we left\nthem money, so subsequently she moved to a better apartment. Was a very touching\nexperience because they saw Victor and I -- I was like a -- suppose like a Ping-Pong\nbecause they spoke and I told Victor and he told me and -- and there was a granddaughter\nthat I got to know that was -- she was lovely and she helped us and I -- so we had lunch\nthere and the taxi driver who -- who brought us, I told him -- we gave him some money\nto go have lunch, because I wasn\u2019t going to invite him with us, this was such a personal\nmeeting. And then of course we visited the town, which was totally different. The camp\none -- I already mentioned that one camp didn\u2019t exist any more, it was just built up new\ndevelopment. The other 1s now a shooting range, so that was very touching. The railroad\n-- Victor saw a beautiful locomotive from the 19th century at the railroad station, so we\ntook a picture of that. He -- you know, and I -- we walked around and I showed him --\nthat was -- but that wasn\u2019t the type of experience that broke me up, you see? I thought\nAuschwitz would, but because the Auschwitz was such a cold, impersonal thing, it just\npassed me, you see? The thing that I really fear turned out nothing, because it was so s --\npoorly arranged, you see? Whereas the going back to my hometown was really the\nabsolute heart of that trip. And of course, then in the ci -- yeah, w-we did other things, we\nmet other people in the hotels, they came to visit us in -- but that was on another level,\nthat was already on -- on level of 1980, people -- grownups meeting grownups, but that\nvisit to my hometown really did it and of course, as I think I mentioned, we went to the\ncemetery and we took pictures and -- that -- all this had meaning and it was touching and\nit was lovely, but it was not the kind that broke me. It did not break me and Auschwitz\ncouldn\u2019t break me, because it was too cold and too impersonal.",
        "Q: We will continue a little bit with that.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I just need to finish this side now. This is the end of tape two, side A.\nEnd of Tape Seven, Side A\nBeginning of Tape Seven, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This it tape number two, side B. And I have two follow-up questions with\nregard to Poland, and one 1s, did you feel while you were there, especially in your\nhometown, did you feel entirely, wholly American, or was there an essence, a core left\nthat was Polish?",
        "A: Well, I tell you, I still feel very Polish, so there is no getting away from that. I still\nlove the language, I love the music and I am very much part of what I was,\nso I felt very much at home, on one hand. On the other hand, I did not feel that that -- that\nPoland that I saw -- and that was Communist Poland, that\u2019s another thing, it\u2019s very\nimportant. At the height of Communism, if -- in fact, that very August that we were in\nPoland, they started having strikes there. That was the Solidarity movement just started.\nBut when we were there, as I told you, everybody was warning me, don\u2019t talk here, don\u2019t\ndo this and don\u2019t do that and the -- the whole -- the ambiance, the -- the -- the -- the -- the\natmosphere was strange. Whether it was because it was Communist or because there were\njust no more Jewish people around. Much as I considered myself part of it, I already felt\nthat I was an American with another -- besides, having Victor around, I already -- this is\nmy life, this was -- this was one time and tha -- it\u2019s now so different. But, by the same\ntoken, all life is different after 50 years. And as I was telling Victor, because we saw my -\n- part of Starachowice, which was called Wierzbnik, was very dilapidated now, in 1980.\nSo I told him, when I came to America, I went to visit somebody -- Huntspoint Avenue in\nthe South Bronx. A -- a friend I had, and it was a very decent part of the city. If you tell\nsomebody now that this was -- South Bronx was lovely, I mean -- so I told him, this\napplies to -- to Wierzbnik, this part of Starachowice that was so dilapidated. I said, \u201cIf\nyou want to south -- went to South Bronx 50 years later, that -- you have that. You come\nhere and you have this.\u201d So the resemblance to things I knew wasn\u2019t there physically.\nThe Mioufka camp was gone, was a brand new development. So except -- aside from that\nJewish cemetery and the visit with the old ladies, my parents friends, was the only true\nconnection. Other than that, we just went as tourists, we went. I told you, the shopen\nroute and we went to the salt mines and we went to zarcoparna and we went to\nChancetahova. We went to see the -- the holy picture, you know, the -- you know the\nChancetahova? No, Chancetahova is a very famous Polish monastery that has the\nMadonna -- the famous Madonna, the black Madonna picture? Okay, I had to see the\nblack Madonna, because I was brought up about that and I knew about it and I -- so since\nthe tr -- group was going there, we went to see the black Madonna. And we went into --\nwas just before a mass, we were brought in through the room where the priests were\nbeing robed in de -- and we stood right in front, against that -- against that -- the -- it was\nlike a fa -- barrier, you know, and we were the first row of the pilgrims -- that was\npilgrimage time, too, there was thousands of people in the church and we saw the black\nMadonna, so I did that -- which was interesting, because you know, this fitted -- this fit in\na vacuum that was in my -- my brain that I was -- I -- I was brought up on this thing, this\nis the holiest picture in the Christian -- in Christian faith in Poland, is the black Madonna.\nNow, I\u2019ve seen the black Madonna, so -- so this was basically the trip with -- with Victor\nand of course, he got a good feeling of what it was about. But it -- as you could see, it\ndidn\u2019t turn out to be scary, as I expected it to be. It was on another level, at another age --\nmy personal age, with Communism all around, with the -- all places having changed\nphysically, too, so it just wasn\u2019t -- it -- it -- anyhow, it was to my benefit, because the way\nit turned out. The second trip that I took with -- for the Holocaust Museum, that -- for the\ninterpreting, that was a little more personal and much more worse. Well, because we\nwent to Auschwitz and I was at the ba -- in the barrack and the -- and the bunk where I\nslept and you know, that was all very personal. But by then, since I was already in\nanother capacity as an interpreter, I couldn\u2019t allow myself to be breaking down, you\nknow, like when we came to Majdanek, and there was no interpreter, English in -- we\nwere supposed to -- the group was supposed to have an interpreter. So they only had the\nPolish interpreter, so I stood there and I was the -- I was the interpreter. So I -- I had to\nprocess the language and I couldn\u2019t -- I could not feel the meaning of the words that I\nwas saying, you see? So that -- but that was much more worthwhile, the second trip. But\nstill, I have already been through that first hoop of -- of facing up to Poland, so it -- that\nwent -- that wasn\u2019t bad.",
        "Q: I would like to tie it together and then have a question, two episodes that were very\npainful, but resolved themselves in a sense. You mentioned much earlier 1n this\ninterview, that it was very painful for you to not have a place where you could mourn\nyour parents.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: There was no cemetery, there was no place, really.",
        "A: Right.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But also from American Jewish people you knew here, who -- who weren\u2019t that\ninterested in raising money for it?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yeah. So my question would be, was it so especially painful you -- for you to have\nthat reyection here in America in a sense, because it prevented you from having a conc --\na resolution a little bit of -- of something? Do you know?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question, but I could tell you --",
        "Q: Was it important for you, 1n a sense, to have that cemetery restored -- to have a place\nrestored, because --",
        "A: Yeah, that was one part, definitely that was one part. But the other part, the\npredominant part was that having been to Poland twice, to my hometown twice and\nhaving found nothing of the old Jewish life in ei-either time, first was 1980, then was\n1987, I felt that any way of commemorating the former existence of a Jewish community\nin Poland was to save that cemetery. There wasn\u2019t much left of it, but whatever was left,\nthat that was now a mission, 1n a sense, because when I was in 1980 and Victor made all\nthose wonderful pictures and I brought them back to the Starachowice Society at the time\nwhen I told you, in October, when we meet for the Yourtside? And I was really sort of\ntold off and -- and I didn\u2019t want to create waves and I didn\u2019t want to make enemies and I\nsort of never liked to push myself, so I let it slide and I sent the pictures to Israel and\nnothing came of it and I had correspondence going on, whatever. After I was able to just\nregister the cemetery in New York, with this other lady, who was -- she happened to have\nbeen my -- Polafunk is her name, she was my religion teacher in Poland, she happens to\nlive in New York. She\u2019s an elderly lady now. We discussed it, she also was really v-v-\nvery much on the -- on -- on my wavelength, so to say. We\u2019re still around and we must\ndo it. If they -- whoever doesn\u2019t like it -- the Polish community will not do it. A, they\u2019re\npoor, B, they\u2019re not interested, C, they would rather have houses built there than have a\nJewish cemetery, because who\u2019s here? There\u2019s nobody around, nobody will know and\nsuch and such. So we did this one thing that we accomplished, we registered the cemetery\nhere in New York, just before the list was closed for the Jewish cemeteries that were\ngoing to be given to the Polish government. So we got that done. After that, when they --\nI have already spoken about it, when the idea of them -- collecti -- thing the money was --\ncame -- it was the easiest things, I just didn\u2019t call the other people and called those that\ngave and they gave and money went to Israel, then the man was sent to Poland and things\nwere done and it\u2019s done. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s easier than -- th-than pie, as they say. Had I\nknown, I would have -- or maybe you know, on the other hand, maybe 1980 people\nweren\u2019t quite ready yet for that. That\u2019s -- you know, you really have to be in a special\nframe of mind to undertake a certain -- a certain obligation. I saw this in 1980 because I\nsaw it with my own eyes. The houses were being built, the cemetery was neglected, it\nwas overgrown, it was -- the -- the -- the monuments were knocked over. The Germans\ntook out a lot of the monuments and they paved streets with it. And I said, \u201cIf you\nallowed what\u2019s going on til now, another year or two, there\u2019ll be nothing there.\u201d This\ngranddaughter of this -- these old ladies, they -- she came with us to the cemetery. And\nthrough her, you see, after I left Poland and I was constant correspondence with her. She\nwent again and then she wrote me a letter, she said -- three years later, she says,\n\u201cWhatever you and your husband saw, there 1s less of it now.\u201d When I had that letter, I\nhit the ceiling. And so this, I think, was the final -- the final push that I needed. And I got\nin touch with Israel and I got in touch with everybody else and I said, \u201cWe do it or we\u2019ll\nnever have it and let\u2019s forget everybody else.\u201d So this was a fulfillment, not -- to answer\nyour question, it wasn\u2019t only because I had no place to grieve. I have nobody in that\ncemetery, we never did have anybody there. This was to preserve a token, that this is a\ntoken, to preserve a little bit of sacred soil, so to say, to show that there was a vibrant\ncommunity here at one time and is no more and -- and if it takes money to do it -- to\nperpetuate it, that could be done. There are a lot of survivors whose children are\ninterested and there\u2019s no reason why this cannot be perpetuated, to be -- to have a\ncaretaker and to just keep that little bit of whatever was left. I personally don\u2019t even need\n-- read Yiddish. I couldn\u2019t even read the -- the monuments. Victor took close up pictures,\nI brought it to New York and I asked some people to read the names. But that\u2019s not -- that\ndoesn\u2019t mean anything. This is a Jewish cemetery and -- so that was the project that really\nwas -- 1-it -- 1t was good for me, personally. You know, however 1-it wa -- whatever good\nit did for others, it was good for me, personally, very fulfilling.",

        "A: Yes, well actually, my translation does not have much bearing with the Korchuk --\nyou see, I -- I used to write and publish articles and such and those are two separate\nissues, SO maybe I will start with the Korchuk, okay? And then with the translation, cause\nthose are separate issues. I was -- and still am, for many years, a member of the Polish\nInstitute of Arts and Sciences. It\u2019s an academic institution of -- 1-1t was organized by\nPolish Jewish -- Polish Christian -- Polish Jewish scholars during the war, when they ran\naway from Europe. And this was an academic institution and it has always done things\nthat pertain to Polish academic life. And culture, too, but Koschushka Foundation, which\nis another organization, Polish organization, deals more with the cultural aspect, but the\nPolish Institute was always part of the academic world. American fit into the academic\nworld, cause a lot of the people there were the professors, professors in American\nuniversities. Anyhow, in the early 80\u2019s, a dialog was started, a Polish Jewish dialog, you\nknow. There is a Polish Jewish dialog in London, there is one in Chicago. There -- there\nare Polish Jewish dialogs forever going on everywhere, but not much progress ha -- some\nprogress has been made, but not as much as it could have. Anyhow, there was an idea\narose that because Ko-Korchuk was a humanitarian, who was a great educator,\nphilosopher. He was also, you know, a doctor who organized the famous orphanage, the\nJewish orphanage, who had this new idea of child upbringing and he was an assimilated\nPolish Jew, who also suffered anti-Semitism while he lived in Poland. He was a -- a 19th\ncentury man who lived under the Russian occupation. Well, Korchuk was a humanist of\nmen of the highest moral and ethical standards. Of the highest devotion to -- to -- to\nhumanity. And because his considered himself a Polish Jew and a Jewish Pole, it was\ndecided, whoever it was, Polish organizations and Jewish organizations decided to use\nKorchuk\u2019s name as a core, as a central piece of a Polish Jewish dialog. I was nominated\nfrom the Polish Institute to become -- to join the group of people who were organizing\nthis dialog. And this was 1n the nine -- early 1980\u2019s, \u201c81, \u00b082, \u00b083, \u201884. Anyhow, we\nwould meet at the ADL, at the ameri -- Anti-Defamation League. The -- the whole idea\nwas -- because he was also a great writer, he wrote books for children and about children.\nBooks on psychology about children, but fantastic books for children. I -- he also had a\nradio program and every child -- he used to read books to children. So every child who\ngrew up in the Poland, in the inter war years, would know Korchuk\u2019s stories. Anyhow, he\nwas used as a central figure for the dialog. And in a competition -- international book\ncompetition was established, where books would be submitted for children -- books\nwritten for children, or about children -- two separate categories. And, when the prizes\nwere going to be given out, then it would be a gathering of Polish and Jewish -- Polish\nChristian and -- and Jewish Polish group meet and we would have ceremonies and so. I\nbecame a what you call reader, because I do book reviews a lot. I ri -- I do book reviews\nfor the American Translators Association and anyhow, since I wrote a lot of book\nreviews, too. So I became a book reader and I -- because I also worked in the Children\u2019s\nLibrary here for 11 years, I picked the children\u2019s books. So I would have 20 - 25 books to\nread. And I had an outline, how to mark that. We would submit it, then the judges would\ndecided and then there would be a ceremony. Now I really am very much interested in\nreading you the names of the organizations which participated. Unfortunately this 1s now\nall past tense, because this whole thing fell apart, this whole ca -- dialog. We had it for\nabout four or five years and then it didn\u2019t terminate, 1t petered out. There was never an\nofficial notice, we no longer do it, we -- whatever. All of a sudden -- I didn\u2019t get a notice,\nthere will be a fo -- there will be -- I was never notified that they\u2019re going to send me a\nboo -- box of books. I never heard from anybody, nobody ever heard from anybody and\nthe thing just thinned out into the air. So I thought if I read you some of this -- these\nparticipating groups, which was a mixture of Polish Christian and Polish Jewish. So there\nwere the anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai Brith, the American Council of Polish Cultural\nClubs, the American Federation of Jewish Fighters, Camp inmates and Nazi victims,\nFederation of Polish Jews in the United States Holocaust Library. The Koschushka\nFoundation, which I told you before is a cultural Polish organization. The North\nAmerican Study Center for Polish Affair, also called Studium. The Polish American\nCongress, that\u2019s -- they -- their -- their home office is in Chicago. The Polish Institute of\nArts and Sciences of America. That\u2019s this organization that I was a member from. Polish\nJudiciary Organization. Vargro, which is the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization\nand the World Federation of Bergen-Belden -- Belgen Associations. In addition to which\nthere was also the head publisher and chief editor of the Polish Noveegenyeek, which 1s a\nvery substantial, very high level Polish language newspaper in New York. His name 1s\nBola [indecipherable]. He was also part of it as a member of the institute, not as a\nrepresentative from his paper. He cannot be a newspaperman and be listed, yeah. Well\nanyhow, this, as you could see, was a very well integrated type of a group. People on\nvery high level of -- of achievement -- organizations and such. One of -- we met -- a few\nof these award ceremonies took place in [indecipherable] here in New York. One took\nplace in Washington, I remember traveling -- in the Kennedy Center. One wa -- had the\nCheswafmeewash, the Polish Nobel Prize winning poet, as keynote speaker. Once they\nhad Governor Keene from New York -- from New Jersey, a -- he was the governor then,\na keynote speaker. They had very interesting keynote speakers -- was lovely get together,\nthe prizes were handed out. First prize I think was thousand dollars, second prize -- and\nthere were two separate categories, as I told you. One was books for children, one was\nbooks about children. And the books actually were submitted internationally. That\nmeans, the books from Israel, from Poland, from England, from France, from the United\nStates and of course the judges picked -- had -- they picked the first, second and third\nprize in both categories and this was sort of a -- like a very good quote unquote excuse. It\nwasn\u2019t an excuse, but it was a very good -- th-the joining point, to -- to have something\nlike this go on and much as these -- this group was in agreement that Korchuk personified\nthe very essence of what humanitarian d-deeds should be about, as much as he\npersonified the Pole and the Jew, all one, as -- as the humanist, you see? As the -- as the\nperson of -- of the highest ethical standard. He personified humanity, so he had to\npersonify Polish Christians and Polish Jews all at once and because he was assimilated\nand he was a man of both worlds, you see? Both the Christian and the Jewish. He was not\nof the religious type of Jews, he -- they were -- there was an assimilated family. His\nfather I think was a lawyer and his grandfather was a doctor or som -- he himself was a\npediatrician, by training. So, you see, this had such great possibilities. And this had such\nvery major aspects of reconciliation built into it. Because he was that thing that we were\ntrying here to build up. We already started with a model, you know? Not a role model,\nwith a model of what we are after. And it somehow -- it fell by the wayside. It just -- I\ndon\u2019t know if I mentioned it, I had open heart surgery in 1989, so after that my ho --\npersonal situation change, I stop -- I stopped publishing and I stopped accepting\ninvitations to do this and join that, because you know, I had to slow down physically.\nAnd now of course I -- I am much better than I was in the first few years, but I still am\nnot of the same -- on the same physical level that I was before the operation, so that it\npetered out just about the time I got sick. And I wasn\u2019t going to be bothered, because I\nwas too much involved with -- then two years later I found out that it -- it isn\u2019t that they\ndidn\u2019t notify me, they just didn\u2019t -- they just -- 1t just fell apart, so -- but there are other\ndialogs, you know, going on, Polish Jewish dialogs that are going on. There is a very fine\ngroup in London and there\u2019s one very good -- good group in Chicago. At this point we\nhave nothing here and I don\u2019t know if -- it\u2019s a very thorny problem, because there\u2019s two\nsteps forward, one step back. And there\u2019s a lot of animosity and misunderstanding and\nthere shouldn\u2019t be. Absolutely should not be, and --",
        "Q: I meant to ask you something else first, but in a sense you have prepared the grounds\nfor something that I wanted to ask you later, but let me ask it now then. The -- some of\nthe key words were con -- reconciliation, that is very important to you? And thorny issues",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- that\u2019s another. There are some -- what one might call hot button issues.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Or divisive issues --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- in the Jewish American community, but also in -- among survivors.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I think maybe we can talk just briefly --",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: -- about -- about a few of those. The Arafat visit --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- earlier this year, turned out to be very difficult in many ways, of course, but also\nthe incident with the invitation, it was at first given and then withdrawn and then given\nagain from the Holocaust Museum in Washington. How do you -- how do you feel about\nthat?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know what the reasons were for what happened. From my personal\nviewpoint, if I were to decide, I would welcome him. Because you cannot resolve issues\nif you are not willing to talk to your en -- to your enemies. You don\u2019t have to talk to your\nfriends, because you know that they are on your side. But you do have to talk to your\nenemies. And there are always viewpoints that are wide spread -- spread very -- very far\napart. But, bringing them closer, you don\u2019t have to attempt to bring them together the\nfirst time or the second time, but you have to allow time for a reconciliation which\nfinalizes a point that is mutually acceptable to two sides. Therefore, I -- my personal --\nthat is nothing to do with what the politics of the matter are or how the Jewish\ncommunity feels or how the Arab community feels, had it been up to me, I would have\ninvited him. That 1s all I can tell you. And -- and I think that was an opportunity missed.",
        "Q: In slightly other terms, what -- what do you think should the role of the Holocaust\nMuseum be and the -- the leadership? Are there things that they should not be doing or\nthat it is important to do as much as possible as an educational museum? How do you\nkind of feel?",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you frankly, I am very much impressed by the work they\u2019re doing. I\nthink the museum, as an educational institution cannot be compared to any other body of\n-- of -- of -- you know, cause any -- not to any other museum, because museums don\u2019t\ndeal with education, really. This is a combination of -- of resource center, educational\ncenter and museum. And that -- and the way it\u2019s run and the way they have it all, 1s so\nimpressive. I'll tell you, I went to the -- the -- the Holo -- not the Holocaust -- the Jewish\nmuseum in Lower Manhattan, Battery Park? I liked it. I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s -- it has\nthree approaches and you know, before the Jewish experience, it\u2019s a -- encompasses the\nentire Jewish experience, whereas the Holocaust deals primarily with the Holocaust. I\nwas more impressed by the Holocaust Museum concept and I think it hits you much\nstronger than this museum, because when you go to this museum, here in New York, you\nfeel that you\u2019ve been to a museum. When you go to the other museum, it\u2019s an experience\nthat shakes you up. And that, you need. I don\u2019t mean you, the visitor, but anybody, you\nknow, who even -- never went there, but knows what this deals with specifically. It is sort\nof like a reminder, you know? Which 1s the par -- purpose, I imagine, of the museum, not\nto forget what happened and to learn from that experience. And I\u2019 Il tell you, I told Miles\nabout it. This is -- I met somebody in New Hampshire, he was an -- very simple man who\ndoes road work, you know, one of the bulldozers and -- young fellow, maybe 35 years\nold or so and he noticed my number. And he told me -- he says, \u201cOh, you one of those?\u201d\nHe -- he said it like that. And I say, \u201cYes.\u201d I say, \u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d He says, \u201cOh,\nyou know, I must tell you about a place, you must go there,\u201d he tells me. I said, \u201cWhat\nplace is 1t?\u201d He says, \u201cYou know, my wife and I and I -- our 13 year old kid and my --\nmy mother-in-law, we went to Tennessee and we decided -- we were in Washington,\nthey said there is this museum, we\u2019ll go to see it. You have no idea what kind of place\nthat is.\u201d This is this man telling me. So, he says, \u201cYou must go there.\u201d He says, \u201cYou\nknow, it\u2019s all about the war and what the Germans did to the Jews, and,\u201d he says, \u201cI can\u2019t\nget over it.\u201d Well, I told him, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you saw it, because I do happen to know about\nit.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, this deals with the kind of experience of --\u201d cause I didn\u2019t go into details\nwith him of anything. I said, \u201cWhat did your young chil -- young boy think?\u201d Oh, he\nsays, \u201cOh, he was very impressed with -- even my mother-in-law couldn\u2019t believe it. She\ndidn\u2019t want to go there,\u201d he tells me. Well, as soon as I -- the conversation was over, I\ncalled up Miles and I told him, \u201cMiles, this is one thing you have to hear, because coming\nfrom this man who -- who lives in the provinces, in a village, who happened to be in\nWashington on the way from Tennessee, they -- where they visited fa-family, who never\nhad any intention of going, but somehow or other he heard something and he went to see.\nAnd for a man -- a Christian man, obviously, to be so impressed and so overwhelmed,\nthat when he saw me, he couldn\u2019t believe that -- I -- he should tell me about it to go there\nimmediately. And I told Miles, I said, \u201cSpread the word in the museum, that whatever it\u2019s\nyou\u2019re doing, you\u2019re doing it very well, because it is reaching the kind of people that\nshould be reached.\u201d See, that is the point, that the museum -- the Holocaust Museum\nreaches people in a way that nothing else would reach them. I mean, for me to go to the\nmuseum, well, I go. But for somebody who didn\u2019t even know the story of the Holocaust,\nto go with the -- the three generations of family and everybody was impressed and he\nhimself, couldn\u2019t get over it. Now there is the sum it up. They are doing the best possible\nwork that could be done to educate, to keep the memory and to stay within the historical\nframework -- you know, without. There is very little commentary there that would make\nyou feel that it is slated -- that the -- one way or another, because I feel it\u2019s a very well\nbalanced -- the Holocaust Museum, I think is very well balanced in con -- the content 1s\nvery well balanced. So, I have the highest regard for what they are doing and I\u2019m very,\nvery pleased that it has run so efficiently and so well. And as I told you, the proof of the\npudding 1s in the eating. If this man, of all people -- I mean, if I met in -- somebody in\nNew York City and he told me, well, you know. But over there? A man lives in a hole in\nthe wall in a village somewhere and works on the -- works for the state, digging, you\nknow, the roadwork. To be so impressed as to tell me 50 times, he repeated, \u201cYou must\ngo,\u201d until I [indecipherable] \u201cI went there, I wa --\u201d He says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go again?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI know the place.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell him much about it, you know\u201d? But I found\nit so interesting, I\u2019m telling you, I called Miles immediately. I told him, \u201cThis you\u2019ve got\nto hear.\u2019 Cause there is your answer about -- not that he asked the question, but this\nbasically illustrates how I feel. I feel that it is reaching the kind of people that the New\nYork museum probably will not reach.",
        "Q: Since you have a scholarly background yourself, let me ask you this. There\u2019s\nsometimes difficult issues with regard to research -- Holocaust research, which has in a\nsense developed -- in effect developed into a very specialized field, in it\u2019s -- for the last\ndecade, I guess. Some people are a little bit worried about that, because they -- they --\nthey are concerned with a-academicizing --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- with a certain jargon that comes into it and -- and -- and sometimes people are\ninvited and disinvited again because they have controversial issues they are dealing with.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: H-How do you feel about scholarship -- specialized cholarship -- scholarship with\nregard to the Holocaust? Is there --",
        "A: I don\u2019t really quite understand the question. How should specialized scholarship be\nconducted or how should it be -- how should the conclusions be promoted, or -- or -- I\ndon\u2019t understand the question.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you feel that there 1s inhe-inherent danger in specializing in the\nHolocaust in s -- in some way? Have -- or -- did -- did you come across controversial\nissues with regard to -- to scholarship? Certain gender issues are sometimes problematic\nfor some people because --",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you -- to give you a general ex -- answer, as you know, within a society\nthere are a million -- million people with million opinions. There are issues that don\u2019t get\nresolved for many, many years. There are issues that -- that will never be resolved and I\nthink an institution that is open to the larger public -- I mean, everybody goes to the\nHolocaust Museum, you know. It isn\u2019t that only academics, or only university students\ngo there, but this is open to the larger public, Christian and otherwise, from all over the\nworld. I understand there -- they have attendance from all over the world. That issues\nhave to be presented, but not as a final conclusion, you know? There are issues, like the\nPolish Jewish dialog. It 1s inconclusive, it is ongoing, it is forever evolving and there is\nno answer. There are a trillion such issues in the world now. There 1s Ireland, that\nunfortunately has been going on for years and years within the same people. So there is\nno such a thing as preventing some viewpoints and -- and excluding other viewpoints. I\nhave always been for reconciliation of ev -- of every kind and I\u2019ve always been for\ninclusion. In this case, inclusion has to mean -- even if not resolving certain issues,\npresenting certain issues. It\u2019s -- 1t was like with the Jewish cemetery, you know? I was\ndiscouraged by the criticism that I was planning to do something. I should have\noverlooked it. I should not have been bothered. But my natural instinct was, this is\ncontroversial, I don\u2019t want to make people feel bad, I don\u2019t -- this and the other thing.\nMeanwhile, the issue was being dead and buried in front of my own eyes, until it came up\nand we seized the opportunity. And this is just a -- a stupid example, maybe, but it\nbasically applies in life. You cannot close the doors on anything and you cannot consider\nanything as a final expression of whatever it is. Because everything is evolves --\neverything evolves and you leave -- if you leave it breathing room -- you know, if you\u2019re\nleaving a roo -- if you leave it the room -- breathing room, you -- you could be all\ninclusive for every viewpoint, without having to ara -- arrive at the specific, final\ndetermination or conclusion. Those aren\u2019t always called for. Determina -- final\ndeterminations, nothing is final. You know, you grow older, you find out. Everything is\nchanging, always, everything. So if there 1s an open door type of approach, there\u2019s\nalways a chance. We\u2019ll be gone years and years, God only knows, there will be reso --\nresolution to Ireland and to -- to Middle East and -- and everything else will be -- would -\n- would resolve itself, you know? So this is personally my -- my feeling, but I have the\nhighest regard for the museum\u2019s work. And as I told you, I consider it much superior to\nthe museum in Lower Manhattan. Absolutely. Others are no comparison. This is\ninteresting, in New York. The other is profound, stimulating and it shakes you up. That 1s\nthe difference.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s -- do you have anything that you would like to say?",
        "A: No, really, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m really very grateful to you for taking the time and for coming\nback and -- and all this and it was really very nice. But this is an awfully -- that\u2019s going to\nbe part of the other tape, I imagine. So it will be an awfully long interview. I don\u2019t know\nwho will ever want to hear it.",
        "Q: Oh, I think there are people out there who would love to hear it and this concludes the\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial --\nEnd of Tape Seven, Side B\nBeginning Tape Eight, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number three, side A. And, although I had already tried to\nconclude this interview, since your name got cut off from the side before, I thought I may\nas well sneak another two questions in. And the first question is not related to anything\nthat we have talked about so -- so far, but 1n a sense, it may be. What do you base your\nJewish identity on?",
        "A: Well, you know that your -- your -- your group identity, so to say -- let\u2019s put it ina\nbigger framework, relates basically to your childhood. This is the way I see it. I do not --\nexcuse me -- I do not come from a very religious family, observant or strictly religious.\nOur parents were Progressive Jews, very much interested in Zionism and also attached to\nJudaism through religion, but certainly not of the Hassidic type that was prevalent in\nPoland, in between the wars. And of course, this sort of rubbed off on us children, the\nidea, the -- the very strong idef -- identification with the Jewish people, but not through\nreligion. Not -- no, not through religion strict observance -- through religious observance,\nbut rather on a -- on a -- on another level than the Hassidic, that the prevalent observance\nwas -- was known for at that time. Consequently, obviously, I had -- I did go to -- to\nHebrew school, as I told you, which was -- dealt with Jewish religion and it had dealt\nwith the Bible and Jewish history, but that was sort of more secular, by nature and so was\nour life at home, even though my grandmother was very religious, which I also\nmentioned prior to this ex -- to this interview. I seem to have continued in that vein. It\nwas lucky when I married Victor, that his family was affiliated with a Reform Temple in\nBrooklyn -- a rather well-known Temple, with -- Rabbi Steinback was his name, he was a\npoet and a writer and an army chaplain and he was also a very inspired type of\nclergyman, you know, he talked poetry and he -- even when he married us, it was, \u201cWhat\na -- what two beautiful names, Regina and Victor. Can you imagine a combination of two\nnames like --\u201d you know, he made a whole to-do about it. Those were his sermons, that\nwas his approach. That was Victor\u2019s background, this Rabbi Steinback. When we got\nmarried, we discovered that we more a -- we are on the same level. My identity -- Jewish\nidentity was stronger than Victor\u2019s, because of the Zionist connection, number one and of\ncourse the fact that I was singled out during the war for being Jewish and nobody ever let\nme forget it. You know, for the fact that I was going to be a victim any second, just\nbecause I was Jewish. So that most certainly, if nothing else, would remind me that that\u2019s\nwhat I am. So that when we got married, we also joined a -- a Reform Temple, in our\narea. And our -- both children were Bar Mitzvahed in that Temple. We -- we don\u2019t have a\nkosher home, you know, we observe the Jewish holidays, we are members of the Temple\nall these years, the same Temple. That goes back 35 years at least and -- we are not active\nin the Temple, even though they were trying to get us in, somehow or other, I don\u2019t\nknow, we never got involved in the Temple, but we are certainly very much interested in\nsupporting the Temple financially and seeing that it\u2019s viable then. And we enjoy going\nthere to services. We go -- th-they have a Kristallnacht observance in Novembers, we go\nto that all the time. We go to the Shoah observances, we go to -- in between the Jewish\nholidays, but we do not go regularly, like weekend services. We don\u2019t go regularly, every\nnow and then we do go, so that to this day my religious orientation 1s within those bounds\nof -- of an inner life that does not need the reinforcement, but it needs the connection, you\nsee? The connection to -- to -- to Reform Judaism is very fine with me. It -- 1t keeps me\nwithin the frame that can accommodate my inner self, you see? Whereas if you put me to\nbe with the Lubavitches, I would probably be rebelling to the point where I would deny\nthat I\u2019m Jewish, because I probably could not accept it as part of who I am. You see,\nthere\u2019s too na -- th-th-th-th -- their -- their focus is too narrow and so on. The Reform\nTemple has a wider focus and -- and that suits us very well. So, to that extent, we are\ngood Jews, so to say, not religious. And certainly, as far as identity is concerned, not only\nhundred percent identity of Judaism, but a million percent, if there 1s such a thing, you\nsee? So, I -- I -- I hope this answers your question.",
        "Q: Had your war experience an impact on your faith in any way? And had America?",
        "A: Not really. You see, I -- since I did not come from a background where religion was\nthe answer, I did not seek the answer in religion during the war, obviously, you know?\nAnd I don\u2019t know that I -- I -- I -- I ever followed this idea of everything being\npreordained or predetermined. I -- I believe in -- in free will, you see, and -- and so when\nI bak -- was in America and I became old enough to appreciate the philosophical un-\nunderpinnings of religion, I rather liked where I came from, you see, and I was happy\nwith the way I was and I\u2019m happy the way I am. And obviously we would have -- we\nwould have changed one way or another, but obviously we carried on, in -- at the -- in the\nsame vein, right through, so it has to sit well with us, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t do it, right?",
        "Q: Right. And one last question, one final question. You mentioned in our first interview,\nthat you tried to be in touch with as many old friends from all different --",
        "A: Connections.",
        "Q: Connections, yeah. Could you mention, maybe, just a -- a few people, a few persons?",
        "A: Okay. For example, I told you I know the students -- I mentioned before from my --\nthe Air F -- Air Force officers. He was a colonel. Now, we have been in touch for all\nthese years. They came to visit here, we went to Boulder, Colorado to visit them, we\ncorrespond all the time. He sends me pictures, I send him pictures of the grandchildren\nand children and we tell each other, Christmastime, all the time -- by the way, I am a\nletter writer. Other people don\u2019t write letters any more, I do. Now this is one old\nconnection I -- people from Berlin, from the DP camp. My very dearest, dearest friend\nfrom the DP camps -- DP camp, are still here. One of them is George Schwab. Another is\nRoma Lichtenthal, she\u2019s also -- she lives in Scarsdale. My friend in Argentina, I\u2019m very\nclose with her. W-We write to each other, we see each other at least once a year, because\nshe comes through New York once a year. And that\u2019s from the DP camp. Of course, from\nhigh school -- I still have my friends from high school. One lives in Albany. We still are -\n- we\u2019re still in touch, Toby. My very best, dearest friend committed suicide. She was\nfrom that connection, but that\u2019s an whole other story, because she was very dependent on\nme for many years, so she was more like friend because she -- she was psychologically\ndamaged and she was part of my family as long as she lived, for the reason that she was a\nneedy person. I don\u2019t mean financially, you know, she had a Ph.D. and everything, but\nshe was needy, very needy. Then a friend from Poland, who lives in Brooklyn, who --\nwith whom I lived for awhile. She\u2019s another connection. From Indiana University,\ncertainly -- certainly, I have Nancy, who still lives in Montreal, retired now. She was\nProfessor of Biology. Now, with Dr. Karpen, Jefferson High School, going back to\nJefferson High School, when Dr. Karpen was alive and his wife was alive, I was with --\nin correspondence with them all the time. They had a summer home in Chichester, New\nYork and whenever we used to go to the Catskills -- that\u2019s also in the ca -- upper\nCatskills -- whenever we used to go to the Catskills, we used to go visit them, with the\nchildren. I have lovely pictures from that period. Miss Hay, who was alive, while she was\nalive, she lived in Seetawket. Also went there, with the children, with -- for lunches, for\ndinners, we used to invite her, she came here. I had another very favorite teacher from\nBrooklyn College speech class, Professor Lawson, she was a lovely woman. Also, she\ndied in California. Unfortunately, all these people I\u2019m talking about, who, through the\nyears -- they were first here, then they were maybe very nearby and then they were\nmoving away. So, most of it remained as contact by correspondence, and I\u2019m just trying\nto think, although I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t do justice to most of my friends, to whom, I mean,\nth-th-th -- on Israel, well, of course, Israel is Poland, you know. Israeli connection --\nfriends in Israel, with whom I correspond to [indecipherable] and see each other. We go\nthere, they come here. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s more like family than friends. That\u2019s people that I\nwent through -- we -- through the camps with and such. And of course, I\u2019m very much in\ntouch with the Jewish organization, the Starachowice organization, which now, as I told\nyou, also, unfortunately people are passing on and the thing is not what it used to be, so --\nyou know, we used to be invited to their Bar Mitzvahs and we used to go and visit and\nhave these meetings once a year. That is now -- most of it actually is thinning out. The\ngroup is thinning out because of age -- they move away to Florida or they die. Most of us\nnow are getting on in age. I -- I can\u2019t begin to -- to think, from Bronx Science, when the\nkids were in Bronx Science, we made connections there, we had friends, neighborhood\npeople. I mean, the fact remains that I write letters and I -- I like to write letters. My\nfriend from Poland, who is now in Chicago, we\u2019re in constant correspondence and I\nhaven\u2019t seen her maybe eight years, Irene. But we -- and of course, the telephone helps,\ntoo. And family, I -- family -- I\u2019m very much attached to family, to cousins and such, so\nwe -- that telephone takes care of that, all my -- my nieces and my nephews and my -- so\nthat -- that goes without saying, but as far as friends are concerned, I can\u2019t quite now\nremember off hand, but I can tell you, I have all these friends whom I call my connection.\nThis is a Berlin connection, this is a Thomas Jefferson connection. This is Indiana\nconnection, you see? This is Bronx Science connection. So I already have these\ncategorized, these people categorized. They are friends of equal importance, otherwise I\nwouldn\u2019t have to -- stayed in touch. It\u2019s just that they are from different periods of my\nlife and I will be very sorry to see when -- when writing letters 1s no longer fashionable,\nyou know, because that will be a very great loss to -- to human contact, I can tell you.\nBecause I have Christian friends whom I don\u2019t see for 10 - 15 years at the time. Comes\nChristmas, I get a full letter, I write a full letter. And that is -- that\u2019s in fr -- friends from\nIndiana, from wherever. I have -- and of course Poland. I write to Poland a lot. But I can\njust tell you that it\u2019s like clockwork. Comes Christmas, I spend two weeks writing letters,\nbecause I know that everybody\u2019s going to write to me as well. And I think this is just\nwonderful. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s the way I love it. And people who are going to dispose of -- of\ncorrespondence, will probably be very much poorer for it. I -- I really feel that way. I\nreally, truly -- I adore receiving letters. Not le -- not mail, not bills, letters.",

        "Q: So it was basically a special program within an ordinary American high school?\nThat\u2019s what it was?",
        "Q: Let me ask you one more question, maybe. Were you encouraged at all to speak about\nyour war experience, either in that particular program or even in -- in [indecipherable]?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This it tape number four, side B.

        "Q: What are -- what are other events in America in the 50\u2019s, 60\u2019s or 70\u2019s, that were really\nimportant, that have affected you somehow? There\u2019s so much that happened.\n[indecipherable] civil rights movement.",
        "Q: Well, PIl tell you, the McCarthy period affected me very much, because I just\ncouldn\u2019t see -- anything that had to do with persecution or that had to do with hounding\nother people, I -- and of course I came from a much more structured political system than\nAmerican democracy. To me it seems a guy like McCarthy should have been kicked out\nthe same minute. But it took all that time to go through the courts and to do this\n[indecipherable] the other. Meanwhile, people li -- people\u2019s lives were ruined. And I\nbasically had never any love for the Communists, that, believe me, because we left\nPoland because -- before the Communists got there. You know, when we left they\nweren\u2019t yet established. Poland was not yet a satellite country in the way that it became\nlater. I had no love for them, because to me this was -- this was another kind of\nrepression, plus the fact that I did find out, through the Jews who were in Russia, or even\n-- | had very wonderful Christian friends, who -- who also suffered. One of my very dear\nfriends, her father was killed in Cutting. You ever heard that name, of that place? Yeah,",

The United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. This interview, as I said to you\nbefore, is a little different from the one that we had last time, because it was really\nimportant to not interrupt your narrative too much. We covered, really, a lot of ground\nand I didn\u2019t want to intercept with too many questions. This time, it will be slightly\ndifferent. We are trying to fill in and clarify a few aspects, and to make that easier,\nbecause it is not quite so -- such a comfortable conversational mode, really, I would like\nto do that in a chronological manner. So let\u2019s start with a time when you were in Berlin,\nin the camp for displaced persons. And you wanted to -- before I ask my first question,\nyou wanted to talk a little bit about something that we didn\u2019t mention in the first\ninterview, which was the situation of Berlin at that time.",

        "Q: Among the American soldiers were also black soldiers --",
        "Q: -- [indecipherable] the American soldiers?",
        "Q: And then eventually -- eventually you left for Bremenhaven?",
        "Q: And the question would be, why did you go and how did you go?",
        "Q: Let me ask you just -- before we move on to the next part of your life, one quick\nfollow-up question, you mentioned fingerprinting --",
        "Q: -- during your processing. Which 1s sort of another way of -- of counting people in a\nsort of somewhat mechanized way.",
        "Q: Was that -- did -- did that have a different impact on you than others that you had\nexperienced before, or was that slightly scary to you?",
        "Q: So now you were in America, in New York and you would go to Jefferson High\nSchool, and the next questions are -- will be about that.",
        "Q: That\u2019s fine?",
        "Q: The -- the first question is, you went to a special, or there was a special program\nassociated with your group?",
        "Q: Holocaust survivors would go to special classes?",
        "Q: Do you happen to know whether or not that was the -- the only program of it\u2019s kind in\nthe United States?",
        "Q: Can I ask just one or two more question with regard to the basic English classes?",
        "Q: You said Americanization was --",
        "Q: -- one of the -- or was the overarching goal, probably. Could you give maybe one or\ntwo sort of more specific example of what -- what that meant? How did they teach you?\nWhat was -- what di -- what did they say was expected of you in America and did\nsomething of that strike you as odd or different, unusual?",
        "Q: Well, really the -- the underlying premise of Americanization was really democracy.\nYou see, a lot of us came from countries which were regimented, which -- I mean you\ndidn\u2019t ask questions, you were told and you obeyed. And of course, having lived under\nthe Germans, not only did you obey, you -- you feared for your life every second and you\nhad to obey. So that coming from a structure -- a political structure of pre-war Europe",

        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRegina Gelb. This is tape number one, side B. The next question would be -- I remember\nyou saying -- and it also comes out in the way you explained just the -- the things before,\nthat you were very hungry for life and you were very excited about the opportunities\noffered now. But in mingling with other students at the school or with other refugees or\nHolocaust survivors, did you talk about the war experiences at all, or was that put aside?",
        "Q: Well [indecipherable] eventually you moved on to Brooklyn College?",
        "Q: And I would like to quote something back to you. You said in the first interview, that\nyour knowledge of the war until then was very personal, because obviously you were sort\nof in the eye of the storm. But now, when you went to Brooklyn College that you were\nquote, \u201cReally ready to go after the historical aspects of how things happened.\u201d So that\nyou were interested in the broader context of the war. And the question, how did you do\nthat? Did you get formal education, did you talk to people about things? How did you\nlearn about it and -- and what did you learn? Was there something surprising? It\u2019s a big\nquestion, I know.",
        "Q: I -- I meant to ask you the question, did you learn anything that changed your\nunderstanding of the war, but that would be wrong in a sense, because you just began to\nreally learn about the political framework, right? Or was there anything --",
        "Q: Now, amidst all of this personal growth, expansion of -- of knowledge -- being busy\nall the time, did you ever allow yourself to mourn for your parents, for those who have\ngone, or did you make a point of -- of not doing that?",
        "Q: You were still very young.",
        "Q: Before I go to the next period of your life, which will be Indiana, of all places --",
        "Q: I would just like to ask you a quick, personal follow up on this one, because it just\noccurred to me that at that time, you seemed to feel quite strong and that you really\nwanted to move ahead. Did you allow yourself moments of weakness, or of rage even?\nDid you feel --",
        "Q: Well, maybe rage is not a good word, I guess. Let me rephrase this.",
        "Q: What I also meant was -- did you ever feel -- 1t\u2019s -- did you feel f -- that you wanted --\nwith regard to Germans, vengeance -- feelings of vengeance or --",
        "Q: Or anger?",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s go to Indiana -- Bloomington then.",
        "Q: It was kind of an interesting situation, because the cold war era sort of came along --",
        "Q: You did say in the first interview that you were quite affected by McCarthyism --",
        "Q: -- because it just didn\u2019t seem -- after your own experience, especially --",
        "Q: -- you know, the right thing. But at the same time, you were going to Bloomington to\nteach Polish -- Polnish?",
        "Q: To people who were s -- going behind the Iron Curtain or just --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yes, so I would like to talk a little bit more about the -- the overall --",
        "Q: -- situation you found yourself in. And sort of -- questions that are hopping a little bit -",
        "Q: -- all over the place, but -- but bear with me then. You did say, first of all, that you\nwere asked in the first questionnaire whether you would be willing to room with a black\ngirl?",
        "Q: And that you found that quite shocking.",
        "Q: Did you room?",
        "Q: Maybe we can sort of --",
        "Q: -- come back to that later, because I do want to ask you to -- they also asked you what\nyour religion was?",
        "Q: Did you -- you too -- you -- you -- you said Jewish?",
        "Q: And the follow-up question would be, did you feel any particular responses among\nyour students then, to you, as a -- as a Jewish person, or --",
        "Q: No, not -- did they know?",

You mentioned\nin your earlier interview, that you could, in -- in your own teaching process, you could\nchoose any conversational topic that you wanted to. Is there an example? Did you pick\nanything --",
        "Q: But -- but speaking of native, you were a native of -- Poland was your birth country?",
        "Q: And at that time, it was becoming, because it was the Cold War era, sort of\nstereotyped many times. Did that reflect in any way back on you? Talking now not about\nthe people you taught, but about the other people you might --",
        "Q: -- as a -- you\u2019d be, as -- as a -- as a Polish?",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "Q: -- at one time, in your own words. But did you also become aware of some particular,\npeculiar American prejudices maybe, for the first time, or --",
        "Q: You did give a -- a good impression of what -- or you have started to give a very li-\nlively impression, I think, of what America meant for you, but could you be -- maybe just\ngive one more example of what you meant with the ideals of America? What was -- was\nit -- what -- how was it different from being Polish?",
        "Q: Now we will be jumping ahead again, for quite a few years, I think, or quite a few\nyears. You had a family, you were having a family now at this point that we are jumping\nto.

        "Answer: All right. Well, my name is Regina Gelb, born Laks, L-a-k-s. 1am also known\nas Renia, R-e-n-i-a. So you could refer to me as Renia and Regina, but -- but for all\npractical -- for all official purposes, I really am Regina, so you can only find me under\nthat, but everybody else knows me also as Renta. Gelb, obviously is my married name.",
        "A: Oh yes, I was born in Starachowice and I\u2019Il spell that for you because it\u2019s a very long\nname. S-t-a-r-a-c-h-o-w-i-c-e. That was, at the time of my birth, also known as\nWierzbnik, W-1-e-r-z-b-n-1-k. I was born on December 16, 1929. I just want to add that at\ntime of my birth, I was really born in Wierzbnik, but Wierzbnik was combined with\nStarachowice into one town and now you would never probably -- you will not find\nWierzbnik on the map, but you will find Starachowice. So, I sort of refer to the fact that I\nwas born in Starachowice because if you want to look me up, you will not find me\notherwise, except in Starachowice.",
        "A: Yes. Starachowice is in central Poland, about two and a half hours by car from\nWarsaw, directly south. It is an industrial town and it was -- if we go a li-little back in\nhistory, Poland, as you know, was divided up to 1918, between Russia, Prussia and\nHungary. We were -- I was born in the very heart of Poland, which was called in those\ndays, Congress Poland, because when Napoleon went through Poland, he carved up a\npiece of free Poland and that was the -- the core of the -- the core -- the -- the center of\nPoland, where Starachowice 1s located. Now, th-the town, as I a-am fond of remembering\n-- reminding everybody -- the fact that the town was an -- an industrial town played a\ngreat part in my surviving the war. The reason being that after the first war, when Poland\nbecame independent in 1918, the -- the marshall pusitski who was then the -- the head of\nthe Polish government -- it was decided that Poland has to arm itself, so they carved up a\n-- an industrial complex within the heart of Poland and they started -- there was ore to be\nsmelted and big factories went up. How this historic fact relates to my survival is\nprobably a bit farfetched, but it isn\u2019t, for the reason that the factory di -- me -- the factory\nin our town, which prior to the war, smelted ore and pro -- was -- produced iron of all\nkinds of locomotives and -- and meat grinders, from the big to the smallest, was\nconverted to a munitions factory as soon as the war broke out. By virtue of which, the\nGermans decided that the entire area, which contained these different factories, which\nwere converted into munitions factories, would need le -- slave labor. Therefore, people\nwho were living within that area, were first used as slave labor. Of course, in due time\nthey would die out and they would be shipped, whatever. The numbers would always be\nsupplemented by new people, who were either shipped out of towns or caught or\nwhichever way. The number --eventually the number of slave labor people working for\nthe -- in that factory, was constant, even though people were dying like flies. But of\ncourse we\u2019re -- are getting ahead of our story here, because this is only the beginning. I\njust meant to make the connection that Starachowice, the factory was -- before the war,\nthe factory was in Starachowice proper. The bedroom of Starachowice proper was\nWierzbnik. That was basically a town where everything took place, commerce and so on\nand it was a very sizable Jewish community, about one third of the people living in\nWierzbnik were Jews. And they were generally, as they always were -- they were\nmerchants and they were cobblers and carpenters and so on and they -- there also was\nsuch a thing as the Jewish intelligencia in those days. Of which my parents were part. But\nthat was the town and -- and Starachowice did not have Jews living in -- 1n it, because the\nJews were not allowed to work in the factory, strange as it might seem. Before the war,\nthe Jews were not allowed to live or work in the factory. In -- and, as I said, eventually\nthe two were combined so by then you couldn\u2019t do -- have these restrictions but that was\nthe fact, before the war.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: I could not tell you. You know, there are certain things which to this day remain a\nmystery to me, because I was a child. I just knew that Jewish people did not work in the\nfact -- in the plant and that there were no Jew -- Jews living there. And I'll tell you,\nactually why -- I'll tell you, I -- I almost know now, because I\u2019ve read some -- some\nbooks on the subjects about Starachowice that were written actually the last 20 years.\nStarachowice was at one time, built in colonies for people directly involved with the\nfactory. In other words, after 1918, when that factory went up, they started building\ncolonies, one was called Roboneetcha, which 1s for the workers and another one was for\nthe -- for the, I guess for the administration over there. But they had these colonies, they\nwere what you call now, you know in America, you have a lot of these developments.\nYou know, you have houses and the -- the -- but the -- the basic commerce was still in\nWierzbnik. The reason Jews did not live in Starachowice, because to qualify, you had to\nwork in the factory, you see? Yeah. And that was true up to the very war. And when the\nwar broke out, obviously things got totally changed because the resettlement of Jews\ncame into being and all this, but this is a story that we\u2019ll probably continue later.",
        "A: All right. Well, first of all, we were a family of five -- father, mother and the three of\nus. My oldest sister, Anna, who is also called Hanya. Her last name now is Wilson and\nshe\u2019s a Canadian. My sec -- my middle sister, Krisha, who\u2019s also called Kris, but her true\nname is Rosalia Kristina Lehrman. And we call her Krisha for short. And my name,\nRegina, which also is Renia. We were a secular type of family. The town was very\nJewish in the sense that it had a very sizable Orthodox Jewish community. But my\nparents, of course were part of the Jewish community, but we were not Orthodox, we\nwere not -- we were secular. And my parents were very much oriented to Zionism. But\nbefore we proceed that, let me just explain to you the other background. The fact that we\nspoke Polish at home, we were brought up in the Polish language. Both my parents spoke\nPolish beautifully, even though my father\u2019s background was really German. He came\nfrom Solsnoviets, which is western Poland, which -- Salesia, in Salesia. And he was\nbrought up in the German language, because obviously he went to school -- he was an\neducated man -- he went to school pri -- prior to the f -- end of the first war, prior to\n1918, which means that, depending on which sphere of influence you lived in, that was\nthe language in which you were taught. Well, my pa -- my father was a German, in that\nsense, because he -- he spoke German beautifully. To this day I talk about his\nencyclopedia because that played a big part in the war, also. He had his encyclopedia in\nGerman, he -- he was subscribing to magazines and other things and he spoke German\nbeautifully, but of course his Polish was wonderful. Mother, on the other ha -- hand,\ncame from the so-called Russian part of Poland, so she spoke Russian in addition to her\nPolish. But we were brought up at home in the Polish language. My parents knew\nYiddish and spoke to each other only if they didn\u2019t want the kids to understand. Now my\nfather was an engineer in the forestry business. That was a very big business in Poland.\nThey employed people who had good education, a good scientific, what\u2019s that to say?\nScience background, which my father had from his German education. Assessing forestry\nfor lumber and such. And there was a big sawmill in Starachowice -- in -- in Wierzbnik,\nStarachowice -- belonged to Jewish people, I think they were Austrians. And they were --\nthat was their ownership. And they employed -- it -- 1t was a sizable type of operation\nbecause th-the lumber was -- the -- the forests that were cut elsewhere, brought in, were --\nwere turned into lumber. And mother was -- as it was true in Poland, she was not what\nyou call a working woman, not until 1938 or so and I -- P\u2019ll come to that. And we had a\nvery good life. Of course we had a maid, as everybody else did and when I tell people\nhow it was when -- we had a -- a seamstress come to the house, you know and people\nused to buy goods and they used to sew it for you, the -- you know, the seamstress would\ncome and she would sew the sheets and she would sew the skirts for the kids and the\nblouses and all that. And this was of course another totally other way of life. And then\nyou had the laundress, she came and she did the big laundry and -- and she took it to the\nmangle and I told somebody about the mangle and said, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Well, the sheets\nwere mangled. And there is such a thing and I know the machine. I could even describe\nit. But anyhow, we had a very good life, until the late 30\u2019s. We had a wonderful life, as\nyou -- P\u2019ll show you some pictures in my albums. My mother has arthri -- had arthritis, so\nshe went for a cure to a place called Busco -- Busco\u2019s druey, which had sulfur baths and\nshe went regularly, ev -- every summer for six weeks. And after that, of course, we used\nto come -- she used to come back and we used to go so-called country, somewhere in the\n-- on the farm to -- to recover. But sh -- this was a strenuous kind of treatment and she\nused to take us with her to Busco. Not all three at one time, but two, sometimes one and I\nremember -- I have even a picture from Busco with my mother and my sister has a\npicture from Busco that -- mother did that in the summertime, but other than that she was\nvery involved with the Zionist movement in Poland. And she was instrumental in ope --\nin opening a Hebrew school called Tarbud, which was specifically designed for children\nlike ourselves, who came from secular homes, where Polish was spoken, for them to have\nthe Jewish identity. We used to go after regular school. After the Polish -- regular Polish\nschool, we used to go to Tarbud, it was called Tarbud. And Tarbud, they taught us\nHebrew and they taught us Jewish history and the Bible and such. But basically, we were\ntoo young to know Hebrew well enough to study the Bible, so that was in Polish and the\nlanguage, to an extent to which a child could manage at that age. And mother was also\nvery instrumental -- first of all, she was president of Viso the women\u2019s international\nZionist organization. Whether she was president of -- of the area, or whatever the area\nencompassed, I couldn\u2019t tell. Whether it was a county, or -- or southern Poland or central\nPoland or -- I don\u2019t know, but she was president of Viso. And these wom-women Zionist\nmovements supported very much the pioneering -- the preparation of young Jews for\nPalestine. The pioneers for Palestine. And they used to be called Hag Sharah. And Hag\nSharah was the kind of a training center which was established even in Starachowice -- in\nStarachowice, Wierzbnik where these young fellows, that was mostly young men or very\nyoung women who were not married and had no children. Young people who wanted to\ngo to Palestine and be pioneers. And they were trained in farm work and in communal\nliving and all that. And the women Zionist movement, of which my mother was\npresident, not just -- didn\u2019t just support it, but was running that Hag Sharah. Father was\nalso quite involved with it, but of course he had to earn a living. But mother, this was her\nfull-time job. All this changed about 1938 because the Jewish people who owned the fac\n-- the sawmill in the town, sold it to Christians. And -- I think they were Austrian Jews, if\nI remember correctly. Anyhow, after they have given up the -- the operation -- the plant,\nevery single Jew was fired. From the top to the bottom. Whether he was an engineer or\nwhether he was whatever. Pushed the tr -- the -- the -- the barrels or collected the --\nwhatever it was. It was completely staffed by Polish Christians. And that was also the\nvery hard time, there was lots of boycotting done of Jewish stores and Jewish enterprises.\nAnd of course, studying history, I know that this didn\u2019t come of itself, 1t was germane,\nbut at the same time, the influences coming out of Germany were also very much\ninvolved in this very open -- very open antagonism. You see, they wouldn\u2019t beat you, but\nthey -- they, if you had a store, they would march around and they would say -- they\nwould march and they would yell, \u201cDon\u2019t buy from Jews,\u201d and don\u2019t buy from Jews and\nsuch. Now, my father was without a job now -- yes?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, this 1s very, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, we had a very wonderful life. That is not just in retrospect or nostalgic\nor in any way but to describe it, we really had a wonderful childhood. The parents were,\nas I told you, very progressive minded. And we were very, very close-knit, especially\nwith my mother\u2019s side of the family, because they lived only within 20 miles or so of the\n-- or 20 kilometers, I don\u2019t know which, but very short distance from Starachowice. And\npersonally, I never knew either grandfather. My father, as I told you, came from\nSolsnoviets and that\u2019s western Poland. I never knew that grandfather, he died before I\nwas born. And I never knew my other grandfather. My mother\u2019s maiden name was\nTannenblume, so I did not know my Tannenblume grandfather and I didn\u2019t know my\nLaks grandfather. However, I knew my grandmothers very well, both of them. The --\ngrandmother Laks used to come for -- you know like you, in the old days they used to\ncome for a visit, was an extended visit, let\u2019s say for six weeks, so she lived with us. And\nthen she would go to visit her other son, Alexander, in Radom. And then she would make\nthe rounds and then she would -- she lived in Solsnoviets, but she would make these very\nlovely, extended trips. But that was the time when I saw her, but the other grandmother,\nwe called Babcha, is a grandmother for -- in Polish. The other grandmother, I really -- not\njust adored, she had great influence over me and I remember her dearly and I\u2019Il never\nforget her because of my childhood, my orientation to the importance of things. For\nexample, she was the owner of a printing shop. I never tire of talking about it because she\nwas -- she owned a printing shop with her two daughters. There were two daughters,\nunmarried daughters living with her. One of them was Regina, that\u2019s mother\u2019s sister,\nRegina Tannenblume and the other was Anja. Anja Tannenblume. Babcha was Sara\nTannenblume. Babcha was officially, so to say, the owner of the printing shop because it\nbelonged to my grandfather, but the three of them -- actually the -- th-the daughters were\nrunning it. And I would be invited -- grandmother was fond of inviting one child at a\ntime. She was religious and she was kosher and she did not think my mother was doing\nthe kind of job with the secular education, that we really needed this other something --\nthis other background. So I would go by myself on the -- it was a train, I think, or on the\nbus. And she would wait for me. You know, it was a very short ride, I mean really short.\nMy mother wouldn\u2019t trust me to somebody there thasay Babcha\u2019s going to be waiting.\nThen she did. And my total fascination with the printing shop -- I fell in love with that\nplace, totally. Not just that the man in the back, you know, that was a hand operated\nprinting machine. They allowed me to touch it and go with them. And then they would\ncut -- they would cut the material, the lets -- they used to do for movie houses, they used\nto do posters. And then they had these big cutting machine and they would cut the edges\nto be -- to be straight. Well, imagine a child -- seven, eight year old child having a bag of\nthese cuttings. I mean, you know, you co -- th-this was paradise. Then, they used to make\nledgers, you know, like ledgers for -- ledgers and they would punch these holes, they had\na punching machine. So you had the confetti. So I had another bag of confetti. I even\nremember, they used to make stickers. You know, in Poland, there was a sticker on the\nbread. You know, when you bought a loaf of bread, there was a little, as big as a postage\nstamp. I forgot why it was there, I think it named the bread, whatever. Anyhow, to punch\nthe holes for the stickers, that was another confetti, much smaller, sort of like a powder.\nAnyhow, my attachment to Babcha, of course, the grandmother Tannenblume started\nwith this fascination of the printing shop. And of course, she treated me wonderfully. She\ntook me to the park for concerts and such, which there was a big park there for that. But\nbasically she wanted me to learn the -- the prayers. So I would say the prayer before\nbreakfast and I would say the prayer before bedtime and I would say all these prayers and\nshe also was ve -- very religious and I distinctly remember she had two sinks in the room\nand a stove with a -- she had like a metal partition and she would put a metal partition\nbecause one part that was for the meat wouldn\u2019t part -- touch the other part. In other\nwords, with all her love and -- and -- and attention to me, she really got this -- this idea of\n-- th -- her idea of -- of getting something to the grandchildren that they weren\u2019t getting at\nhome, very well. She got it across very well, because I never forgot 1t and of course we\nare very much -- we\u2019re very much -- not that we feel Jewish, we are Jewish to the core.\nW -- Just never became religious in the sense that Babcha wanted me to be religious. But\nJudaism is -- 1s part -- not of the persona, but of the being, to the very core. Some of it, of\ncourse comes from -- 90 percent comes from the house, because that was the -- the\nidentity with Judaism was so very, very strong. But Babcha\u2019s identity with Judaism was\nthe other part that I didn\u2019t get. And she was very intelligent and very well educated for a\nwoman of those days. She was -- she spoke and wrote French fluently. She knew German\nvery well. She came from a very fine family. In fi -- in fact I remember her cousin had\nthe bank -- the bank in Austrovietz belonged to her cousin, they came from Sundomiesh,\na town south of Austrovietz. Babcha lived in Austrovietz, where the printing shop was,\nAustrovietz, which was very near to us. Sundomiesh was a little further south, both of\nStarachowice and Austrovietz. Old, medieval city. That\u2019s where Babcha was born and --\nand this is where the -- her extended family was. The importance here of talking about\nthe family is this, Babcha gave -- she was pr -- gave birth 13 times, but nine children\nsurvived. Nine of the 13. My mother was one of them. It was a very -- when I came on\nthe scene -- it was a very extended family because all these sons and daughters got\nmarried. Out of nine, you can probably visualize how many grandchildren there were and\nhow many -- you see? The point of it is this, that from that family, aside from the sons\nwho came to America, everybody else perished from that family. The oldest daughter --\nmy -- my mother\u2019s oldest sister, who -- her name was Kronenberg, she had two sons who\nstudied in Belgium, they were engineers. And I think they perished in the Holocaust in\nBelgium. We never found about -- out about them. Babcha and her daughters that were\nnot married yet, the two that lived -- no, one of them got married during the war, so she\nwas already married during the war, but Babcha and the two daughter thers and the son-\nin-law from Austrovietz, they went. They went to Treblinka. And -- and my other aunt,\nwho lived in Danzig with her husband -- nobody from that family survived, from my\nmother\u2019s family. Of course my parents perished. But in those days, the -- during the --\nbefore the war, Babcha came to the house very often to us. But most of it, my major\nrecollection of Babcha was that she was getting one child at a time and adoring it and\nspoiling it and teaching it to be religious. And she was a very progressive woman. I have\na picture where sh -- you could see a family picture and she\u2019s wearing -- she\u2019s wearing a\nwig. She was religious, but the combination of her religiosity and her progressiveness\nand being so well educated 1s -- is a little hard to understand for a woman who must have\n-- I don\u2019t know how old she was. Well, she was born in the 19th century for sure. She\nwas a 19th century woman. So I -- all these aunts and the cousins, I just absolutely\nadored. Now, nobody from that family survived. And one of my mother\u2019s sisters, the\nyoungest one, who was also single, became a pharmacist. She studied pharmacy before\nthe war and her first job was in 1939, in the summer. And she went to a place called\nWamsha, which is northeast Poland, around Biawastock -- around there. We never found\nout what happened to her. You know, we know what happened to the others because\npeople from Austrovietz who survived, told us what happened to the people from\nAustrovietz. Like I could tell you what peop -- what happened to people from\nStarachowice who didn\u2019t survive. They went to Treblinka. Austrovietz was the same.\nPeople -- some people who survive who knew when Babcha went and Regina and all the\naunts. This youngest sister of my mother\u2019s, whose name was Roosia, we never found out\n-- of course Wamsha was decimated as badly as any other city, as far as the Jewish\npopulation, so -- but we never -- I\u2019m saying it for the reason that as much as we know\nwho perished where, we have no idea where this one aunt perished. Now Babcha the\nother one, Babcha Laks, from Solsnoviets, she perished together with her family there.\nShe had two daughters who were married and had children. The only person that\nsurvived from Babcha -- who lived with Babcha, was one of her granddaughters,\nAnnjapatashnik, she lives in Israel. We see her and we keep in touch. Other than that, her\nson Alexander, who was my unc -- my brother -- my father\u2019s brother, Alexander Laks,\nwith his family, they survived. So from the Tannenblume side, nobody survived except\nthe three of us, the three sisters. From the Laks side of the family, only Uncle Alexander\nwith his wife and the two sons who were in Russia and Anja, my cousin Anja. And we\u2019re\ntalking about, if you add the numbers of these two families, it\u2019s an unbelievable number,\nlike 200 people or maybe even more. You see, so tho -- this 1s the immediate family, not\ncounting other cousins, you know, that were distant cousins and -- and my mother\u2019s\ncousins and such. We\u2019re just talking about the immediate family. Grandparents and\nuncles and aunts and cousins. And everybody perished, except as I told you, for the three\nof us. The three sisters, Uncle Alexander with his wife and the two sons. Of course they\ndidn\u2019t go through the Holocaust. Uncle and aunt did, the sons went to Russia and they\ncame out of Russia with unders army, with the Polish army.",
        "A: Later, right.",
        "A: The three of us, right. Well --",
        "A: All right. We were very close. First of all, as I told you, we all went to Polish schools.\nWhen the time came for my oldest sister to go to high school, she was always very\nbrilliant, she was the brain of the family, the genius. And to this day, we -- we -- we treat\nher that way. She was not to be bothered with daily things. When she came in and she\nhad to be served and she -- because she was a genius. Anyhow, she went -- she took a test\nin Radom. Radom is a town not far from us, where they had a -- a special high school\ngimnasium where Jews were not allowed, except the very smart Jews. It was a school and\n-- what was the name of that high school? I forgot, it probably come to me. Anyhow, she\nwent to -- from Starachowice, with my mother, she took the test and then you had to go\nand find your name, she made it. There were 500 girls in that school and there were five\nJewish girls. She was one of them and she was from out of town. So now it gives you an\nidea how bright she was and how -- how really sharp she was to be edout. So she -- she\nlived in Radom, before -- right before the war. She lived in Radom, went to gimnasium in\nRadom, had her Radom friends there. And she -- the tutoring, she was supplementing her\nincome always with tutoring. She was tutoring French and she was tutoring Latin. And\nthis 1s very important for my later part of the story. Because she was a tutor to others and\nshe always kept all these books and she was just -- she was the oldest and she had the\nmost academic knowledge. That came in very handy later on during the war. But now\nwe\u2019 re talking about before the war. So she lived in Radom and came home for vacations.\nShe was not to be bothered. My father knew nothing in the kitchen, he couldn\u2019t even set\nhimself a ca -- top -- glass of tea, as they called it, glass of tea. When sh -- when Hanya\ncame home, father served her a gl -- a cu -- a glass of tea, because you could not bother\ngeniuses with things like that, you see. Now Krisha, the sen -- the -- the middle child,\nLehrman, Krislerman -- she was always very beautiful. She was an exceptional beauty.\nAnd I\u2019m not just saying she was pretty. She was a striking beauty. She still is, but in\nthose days she really was a strikingly beautiful child. And she -- also she went to Polish\nschools, yes, I think I mentioned it, that Hanya first went to elementary school which was\nPolish. Th-This is the town school. And then she went to Radom to the gimnasium.\nKrisha also started the gimnasium in Starachowice. Mother\u2019s only problem about Krisha\nwas, that because she\u2019s so beautiful, she will not be as smart as my other dau -- sister. So\nif they would pass in the street and somebody said, \u201cOh, she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\u2019 So my\nmother said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d People were always reprimanded to remark that\nshe was -- my mother used to say, \u201cShe will never grow up to be anything, because\neverybody\u2019s going to tell her she\u2019s so beautiful and --\u201d, but she was. \u201cShe will think life\nis just nothing, I mean, she don\u2019t have to make the effort.\u201d But of course she was very,\nvery smart and very practical. Krisha was always very practical. Hanya, the oldest one,\nwas always on another, you know, somewhere else in the -- in -- in -- in the clouds, head\nin the clouds. But Krisha was down to earth, she was smart, she was industrious, as of\ncourse life proved later on. In true life, she was the smartest, you know. And she did in\nschool, she --very well. She did very, very good school work. And of course, then I was\nat th-th-th-the tail end, of course. I -- I wasn\u2019t what you call a ver -- I was sort of an ugly\nduckling type of kid, you know. I didn\u2019t eat much, but I -- I was sort of very curious\nabout things, you know I -- they used to call me th-the -- the -- the information agency,\nbecause I used to go out and find this happen and you know this. There was a band\nplaying fair and this -- I always was very curious about everything. I was extremely\ncurious and I was very good in school. That is the one thing that -- from the minute I hit\nschool, that was my life and I really had all th-th-the -- five was the -- the -- the -- like an\nA, you know, in America it\u2019s A, B you get in col -- in school. Well, I had fives, always\nfives, everything was five. And mother used to say the same thing, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk in\nthe front of the child about that she\u2019s so good in school. Doesn\u2019t mean anything. She\u2019s\ngoing to get an idea, she\u2019s --\u201d, this was the whole. And you know, the upbringing in those\ndays -- yo-you -- you should never praise your child for being smart. Today, I say to my\ngrandson, \u201cOh, I think you\u2019re the smartest child in the world.\u201d I always tell -- say to him,\nI say, \u201cYou know, I think you\u2019re so smart.\u201d Which he is. He\u2019s very intelligent. Max is\nnow nine years old. And I keep telling him, I say, \u201cI think you\u2019re wonderful. I think\nyou\u2019re so smart.\u201d My parents always told us we\u2019re wonderful and everything, but every\nattribute that was outstanding was not to be praised. Like Krisha\u2019s beauty was taboo, you\nshouldn\u2019t say it in front of her because she\u2019s not going to grow up to be anything. You\nshould not -- Hanya you shouldn\u2019t touch because she is -- she\u2019s a genius, so she can\u2019t --\nand as far as Renia\u2019s concerned --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yes, no, I was just saying that -- that -- as -- as a -- as a -- what you call a child who\ndid well in school, I wasn\u2019t supposed to be praised too much because that would get in\nmy head. But anyhow, we did have a very fine life, because as I already said, we had\ngrandmothers visiting with us. We had a grand -- where we\u2019re going to visit with the\ngrandparents. We went to Busco every summer. Then we went on -- as I said, on a farm\nsomewhere for a week or two because mother needed to recover from the treatment. We\nwent to Hebrew school in the afternoon after school and we also participated in the Polish\n-- in life of the Polish community. There were parades -- third of May, you know, is a\nnational holiday like July fourth, this day of -- Constitution day. Or 11th of November,\nwhich is Armistice Day here, but over there it was Poland was liberated 1918, on the\n11th. That was the end of the first war, that was a big holiday in Poland. So we would go\nand there were all kinds of things in school going on where you know, had the little -- the\n-- the speeches in the school and -- and speeches outside and we would recite poetry and\nthen everybody would go -- you know, to -- to -- even to the church for whatever called -\n- some kind of a celebration. And we would go in. We wouldn\u2019t -- you know, we\nwouldn\u2019t pray or anything, but we went into the church just like anybody else. And --",
        "A: Very fr-friendly. Very. We were part of the Polish neighbor -- of the Polish\ncommunity, but we were part of the Jewish community. It\u2019s just that we did not live the\nsame type of life as the Hasidim did, you see. Because as I said, we went to Polish\nschools and that made all the difference. Be -- we spoke Polish at home. That made all\nthe difference, you see? And the fact was that my parents were better educated and -- and\nmore, I use a vernacular -- plugged in to the bigger world. You see, the Hasidic world\nwas very insular. It isn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t -- they hated the Poles or they loved the Poles, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter. They lived their own lives. They were parallel to the lives of the Polish\ncommunity, but they didn\u2019t mingle, you know. We were being invited for Christmas\ncelebrations to other people\u2019s -- the Christian homes. Our -- my mother\u2019s dear, dear\nfriends came for Passover Seder sometimes, for Jewish holidays, for whatever. To eat the\nJewish foods, however it was. So ours was a sort of part of the overall community,\nwhereas the Hasidim lived their own life, very much along the -- the religious lines. And\nthey were not plugged in to the larger community and this was true throughout Poland.\nStarachowice was not in any way different, you see, from the prevailing -- not conditions,\nthe -- the -- the prevailing living standards, you know? This was one community that sw -\n- we were sort of in between.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. This is the one thing about which I know nothing. As I told you, my parents\nwouldn\u2019t allow us to be praised for -- they always wanted to protect us along the lines\nthat they thought were proper -- not proper, but important to bring up children. I\npersonally am the youngest -- that I knew nothing about anything. I didn\u2019t know about --\nI knew that there was Nazi movement -- that there was some bad men in -- in Germany,\nbut that the German Jews were being sent out of Germany, but this was -- this was far,\nGermany was God knows where and -- and it had nothing to do with me personally. My\nparents never spoke about it. As a matter of fact, in later years, way later, when we were\nalready in -- in the ghetto, they never told us anything. And I am quite sure they knew a\nlot. So, to this day, I question. Did they know and didn\u2019t tell us or didn -- maybe they\ndidn\u2019t know. But it\u2019s not possible that people like this wouldn\u2019t know. And when I reflect\non my background, how we were always so protected. You know, you shouldn\u2019t tal --\nyou shouldn\u2019t tell her she\u2019s smart and you shouldn\u2019t tell her she\u2019s beautiful, you know,\nbecause it\u2019s not go1 -- well, why should you tell children those horrible things, if they\nwere true? Maybe people didn\u2019t believe yet -- that what was happening was true. So\ncoming back to pre-war and the Nazi rise to power and how it affected my life, maybe it\nemboldened the Poles to open boycott, because I do remember distinctly -- to this day we\nhave an anecdote, the family anecdote. My father was coming home and there was a\nstore, a Jewish store in -- in -- up front on -- in the street level where we lived, we lived in\nthe back. And he came and there was this whole group of Poles walking around and\nsaying, \u201cBeat the Jew, beat the Jew, beat the Jew.\u201d They were walking -- picketing that\nstore and my father came up on it and one of the men was a very good friend. And when\nmy father passed by, he said, \u201cBeat the Jew, economically.\u201d So to this day when th-the\nissue of Polish anti-Semitism 1s descri -- dis -- discussed, I say I do remember when my\nfather came home laughing, he said, \u201cIn the last minute when he saw me, he says, \u201cBe jer\nda economeetchnia.\u201d He kept saying, \u201cBe jer da, be jer da,\u201d he saw me and he said, \u201cBe\njer da economeetchnia.\u201d\u201d You see? And this was open. Now there were other things that\nwent on prior to that, that were maybe a little more subtle, a little more hidden. But when\nI -- Iremembered the boycotts, only because my father is relating that incident. The last\nminute -- he says be jer da, he stops, economeetchnia. He saw my father passing by. You\nsee? And that was a true economic boycott, which really didn\u2019t get anywhere, in the\nsense that the -- the Jews were very good traders and they good stuff and -- and the Poles\nstill shop, so they shop sort of quietly, through the back door or whatever. But -- Jewish\npopulation was being squeezed, no question about that, you know, no question about it.\nIn the -- just before the war, they were getting the -- squeezed constantly, worse and\nworse. That\u2019s before the Germans.",
        "A: Well, I really have one recollection and that was around Passover. What year that was,\nI don\u2019t know. Could have been \u201838 or maybe \u201839. A new family moved in -- into the\nneighborhood and there was this little girl, Kiya. A very lovely, blonde, little girl. And\nshe was placed in the same grade as I was, so we became instant friends. She was my\nfriend, not the other -- not Krisha\u2019s and not Hanya\u2019s friend. And then was Passover --\nPassover rolled around, could have been right before the war and I told her to come in --\nno, she used to come all the time to play with me, we did homework together, you know,\nwe read poetry, such. And I told her to come and -- to come to the house. And she says\nno, now she won\u2019t come. I said, \u201cHow come?\u201d She says no, she is not going to come for\na little while, like a week or two. And I said, \u201cWhy 1s that?\u201d She says because it\u2019s\nPassover and the Jews grab children for -- that they take blood from the children for\nmatzahs. That was my first shock. I did not hear it from the children, my -- from the\ntown, but I did hear it from that child. And she never came during Passover. And then I\nthink eventually the war came. So it had to be 1939, you know, in the spring, yeah, I\u2019m\nsure that\u2019s how it was. And she says no, she wouldn\u2019t come and she didn\u2019t come. And I\nthink my mother said sh -- that I don\u2019t need such friends anyhow. So, whatever it was,\nthat was the end of the relationship. I think the war just came, then the summer came\naround and then summers we went -- you know with we\u2019re here and we were there, we\nwent to Babcha. By the time September came, I never went to school again. You know,\n1939, the war broke out the first of September, so -- she was in my class so that was --\nthat was the end of the relationship. So that was one that I never, never forgot. And\nanother one was in school, it happened to me and I -- I always look back on it and think\nto myself, what motivated this man to say that? I had a new teacher and he -- was first\nday of school and again, could have been 1938 -- yes it had to be 1938 because I didn\u2019t\ngo to school any more in \u201839. And he says, \u201cCould every child please stand up and say\nhis name?\u201d So everybody got up and then I got up and I said, \u201cRegina Laks.\u201d So he --\nand I sat down and so he tells me to get up, he says, \u201cNo, your name is not Regina. You\nare Jewish, right?\u201d I say, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYour name is not Regina.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, it is. I can\nprove it, I can show it. I mean I -- Iam surely Regina.\u201d \u201cNo, you go back to your mother\nand tell her that your name is Rifka.\u201d And I went home and I cried and my mother said\nnot to bother about it, because we can prove that my name is Regina. It\u2019s on the papers,\nit\u2019s on my birth certificate and if he doesn\u2019t like it, that\u2019s how he doesn\u2019t like it, but my\nname is not Rifka.",
        "A: I interpreted by the fact that he did not like Jews. He absolutely had it in him to -- to --\nto belittle me. I mean, you know how it is in front of a class, to be -- I mean you are a\nseven, eight or nine year old child and somebody says something like this to you in front\nof the class. And of course you know they -- the -- 1n the -- in the child is exposed to all\nkinds of other antagonisms and not necessarily out of anti-Semitism. When I was a kid,\nth-th-th-the Christian boys used to beat up the Jewish girls. But that isn\u2019t what you call\nanti-Semitism in the true sense. This is just, well they\u2019re Jews, we don\u2019t have to bother\nwith them and you can beat them up. So, however it was, I was afraid as a girl, of these\nChristian boys, but some of them were friendly and others us-used to beat us up coming\nfrom school, so we used to go home in a group. But this was very specific, this calling me\nout in the class, very specific and even as a child, I could feel that he wanted to belittle\nme, that he wanted -- one way or another to belittle me in front of the class. You see?\nBecause when I was beaten up by a Christian boy, that was just part of the way things\nwere. You know, you beat up -- the boys were rambunctious and well anyway. But this\nwas different. So that incident -- that I never forgot. Never, never, never. Like my\nfather\u2019s anecdote about Be jer da economeetchnia, I didn\u2019t forget that and I didn\u2019t forget\nthe fact that -- that my name is not Regina, but Rifka, which of course wasn\u2019t the case. So\nth-this -- to answer your question, this was about the extent of my awareness. You see --\nthe extent of my personal awareness of things around me. As far as the larger picture, I\ndon\u2019t know what my parents knew. My father had to know. I'll tell you why. There was\nan -- a magazine or something called, Ost une vest. Something like that. There we -- he\nused to -- he used to subscribe to -- used to come. I don\u2019t know where it came from,\nwhether it came from Salesia or from Germany, but he used to subscribe to that. That had\nto have something in it that would give them an idea what\u2019s going on. But I -- I really\ndon\u2019t know. I only knew that as far as the preparation of the -- the young pioneers for\nIsrael, did not have to do with anti-Semitism, you see, because that was strictly\nestablishing a Jewish homeland type of thing, with no connection. That\u2019s the way I\nunderstood it, with no connection to other things that were going on. That was a program\nand there was a whole thing of collecting money and doing this and the other thing and\ntraining and shipping and there were kinds of Jewish leaders who used to come to our\nhometown and give speeches and so on. But that had nothing to do with the official\nrecognition or condemnation or -- or anything. Anti-Semitism as such, no. That was\nanother aspect of -- of Jewish life in Poland. In the 30\u2019s, as I understand it now, a lot of\nyoung Jews, pioneers, went to Europe -- to Palestine, settled there. You know, I\ntranslated Kolchuk, Yanoush Kolchuk and I did a lot of work on him -- about him. He --\nhis children -- so-called children, who got to be 16 and -- and -- and left the orphanage,\nresettled in Palestine as did his own assistant, Vincheeska, Stefania Vincheeska. And\nKolchuk was -- absolutely begged -- begged to come to Palestine. He went to Palestine in\n1936. I mean, I know it now from history and from the research and the translations that I\ndo. He went to Israel. It was not for him. He was an older man. He was totally -- he was a\nwriter. He could not fit into a framework of another language. And he came back. And he\nwas -- he was dismissed from the Polish radio in 1938. You know, he was the -- the -- the\nfamous old doctor who gave advice, like Dr. Spock here, gave advice on child rearing to\neverybody. He was removed from the Polish radio in 1938, yet he didn\u2019t go back to\nPalestine, you see? And in my -- I used to hear Kolchuk read children\u2019s stories -- you\nknow, I used to -- in school we had the books, Kolchuk\u2019s. Maybe not in school, at home.\nBut the point is that -- coming back to how aware was I. I was aware in my small, little\nworld, but absolutely not in connection to anything on a larger scale. And my sister in\nRadom, Hanya, who was in the Polish gimnasium -- I don\u2019t know that she suffered much\nanti-Semitism, for the reason -- or maybe she did -- for the reason that she was so smart,\nyou see? So you -- you couldn\u2019t attack somebody who was just top -- tops -- tops, you\nsee?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very. Yes. The -- it\u2019s very important to say -- again you see how the factory -- the\nplant, the -- how that fits into the -- into the progression. In -- on how much my life is\ntied up with it, even though I really, frankly, I mean I had no connection to it, but how --\nwhat a big part of my life that factory was. And it wasn\u2019t -- and it wasn\u2019t part of my life,\nbut how it influenced my life. When the war broke out and there were -- the bombings\nstarted and they -- they started digging dren -- trenches, you know, for anti-aircraft, my\nfather became the captain, you know, they -- like they designated. We lived on the street -\n- the main street, it was called Putsaskago -- connected Wierzbnik and Starachowice. It\nwas the nicest street. Less commercial -- least commercial. Not where the -- all the stores\nand so on. My father was designated the captain, you know, for the anti-aircraft. And --\nso the factory was in Starachowice. The Wierzbnik town was on the other side and the --\nin between was the s -- the street Putsaskago that connected. So my father came, he --\nthere was a briefing, he was called in to the headquarters there, whatever it was. And my\nfather came and said, \u201cThe town is being evacuated, everybody has to get out.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the factory is going to be blown to pieces. Just like in the first war.\u201d The first\nthing they attacked was the factory -- the factories that produced metal things and such.\nSo, immediately we all go out and we -- we -- there were forest not far from us and the\nwhole town was evacuated. The closer we got to the forest, the more there were people\nwith cows, you know, the farmers and the -- the Jews and the religious Jews and the non-\nrel -- and the Christians and the farmers and the cows and the dogs and everybody going\ninto -- into the forest because this -- the factory 1s going to be blown up and this town 1s\ngoing to be blown away, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be, right? Because you learned from\nexperience, that\u2019s what happened, okay. We got caught in the crossfire of the worst kind.\nBecause we were in a valley and on the two hills -- one was the German artillery and the\nother was the Polish. They were shooting at each other, we were in the middle and the\nGerman planes would come down with reflectors at night and shoot with machine guns at\nthe people on the ground. Anyhow, then a few days later, after this horrend -- there was\none horrendous night during -- where we were caught in the crossfire -- that there was -- I\nthought nobody would come out. This was my first thing, I didn\u2019t yet know who was\nwho and who was Germans and who wasn\u2019t, I just couldn\u2019t imagine what people look\nlike, to do -- to do things like this. Anyhow, then it got quiet and everybody said, \u201cNow\nwe're going back.\u201d\u2019 We went back. The factory was not even touched. There wasn\u2019t a b --\none bomb fell somewhere in town, but nothing was damaged. Nothing was damaged. The\nfactory was immediately -- they must have had spies in there or something. The factory,\nwithin one week was operational for war production. Okay? So now, we all came back\nand we started seeing Germans in the street. And they all -- they all started -- we came\nback to our own apartment and everybody came back. Our apartment wasn\u2019t damaged. In\nfact, I remember we were eating quickly and we left the dishes and everything and by the\ntime we came back three or four days later, there are flies around it and everything,\nbecause was so hot. Was a tremendously, terribly hot September, you know, when the\nwar broke out. However, we dragged ourselves back and the town was not damaged. The\nfactory was not touched and the Germans were marking -- marching in formation and\nsinging. They were always singing, marching in the street. They wore boots -- high\nleather boots and they were marching and -- and my parents, you know, my father, being\na German himself, you know, he -- he wasn\u2019t German, but you -- as I explained, he spoke\nGerman and he identified with German culture. He thought th-th-that\u2019s nothing, you\nknow, nothing. Well, before we knew it, they started coming around with dogs and\ncatching people in the street -- the Germans, and they caught my father, my father was\npassing and he went and he wasn\u2019t coming back for hours. My mother got very -- my\nmother got very worried. They kept them somewhere cleaning something. So she went --\nsomebody said, \u201cOh, they took all these Jews, they took them to the railroad station to\nclean up.\u201d So my mother went over to the railroad station, there was this German guard.\nAnd she said to hi -- she spoke German too, she said to the German soldier, she said,\n\u201cVasin th-the herren.\u201d And he said, \u201cThese -- these aren\u2019t herren. These are the yuden.\u201d\nAnd he kicked her. And this was maybe second day after they arrived. Th-That was --\nnothing happened yet. This was already -- they took -- they made them clean with\ntoothbrushes, you know, they made the Jews with the beards, they had to clean st-steps\nwith beards and -- the most -- and this -- and -- and nothing was yet happening on a\nlarger scale, only those small things. Then they started coming around the how -- homes.\nThey would come with a big dog. I told you my father had an encyclopedia that was --\nnow I know it was very valuable, because it was leather bound, with gold lettering. I\nmean, I say it\u2019s very valuable in terms of antique possessions, but in those day, this was\nmy life, because it was all handpainted, like butterflies and birds was all handpaint. When\nI used to read -- not read, I couldn\u2019t read German, but I used to look at the pictures, I had\nto wash my hands. I had to have -- my father expec -- inspected my hands to see that I\ndidn\u2019t leave a stain. The most beautiful butterfly pictures, the most beautiful bird\npictures, flowers, it was all handpainted. Was very valuable encyclopedia. Well, the first\nthing, I don\u2019t know, maybe three days after the war started, very early. As I said, before\nanything bigger was happening, they came into the house and the German looked at that\nencyclopedia. My father had it in a, you know, like a breakfront with glass doors, th --\nbecause they were under a key. God forbid, you couldn\u2019t touch the stuff, you know, it\nwas sacred. So it was always under lock and key. He said to open this. He opened, then\nhe kicked my father, he said to give him boxes. They didn\u2019t have boxes, I don\u2019t know\nhow they came back with boxes. They load it in the boxes and they took it away. That\nwas the first insult. Between the fir -- time that my father was taken to clean the station,\nwhere he wasn\u2019t herren, he was just a yuden and this act of vandalism that hit to the core.\nOf course later on, when -- with the gas chambers, who would even know that person\nwould take such an insult so personally? This taking away of the encyclopedia was such\na blow to the family, to him. Was no questions asked, you know. They burst in, \u201cWhere\u2019s\nthe key?\u201d Put it out and they took it. And they went around looking for something, they\nwould take a bayonet and s -- and shove it in the car -- 1n the -- in the couch or\nsomething. Just for the fun of it. Those were personal insults for which nobody was yet\nprepared. They were terrific blows. And we\u2019re talking -- in retrospect, you\u2019re talking\nabout nothing. If you consider Auschwitz and all the other things, for heaven\u2019s sake. And\n-- and the Holocaust and the genocide and here I\u2019m talking -- but at that time, even I as a\nchild felt that insult when my mother came and cried because he -- th-that man, that\nsoldier said these were not men, they -- gentlemen, they herren, you know. He -- these\nwere just Jews. That was the one insult and then the encyclopedia was the other insult.\nAnd who even know -- knew that this was -- on the scale of things, it was nothing. You\nknow, but this was a tremendously sh -- a shake-up of the -- this was the first blow. Very\nsevere first blow. Anybody who would listen to me now, talking about the Holocaust,\nwould say, what nonsense is that? This is how it was, you see? Right away we were --\nthere was no food, they wouldn\u2019t allow us to buy food, we had to -- oh, no -- I -- Iam\nreally yet getting ahead of myself, because this is right after we came back. And very\nsoon -- this was a daily occurrence, that the Gestapo would come around with dogs, so\nyou couldn\u2019t be outside, you couldn\u2019t go -- you couldn\u2019t because if th -- you were of age,\nlike my father, they would take you to labor somewhere or just to -- to maltreat you. And\nif you were a child, they would sic the dog on you or something. So immediately we had\nto be very, very aware of -- of -- they were very brutal, that was Gestapo. And there was\nespecially one man -- what was his -- Altov I think was his name. I think it was Altov. He\ncame around with the dogs and the children were petrified. Anyhow, my parents found a\nway to have us stay home. Now, you understand, this is now September, we\u2019re not\nallowed to go to school, because this Polish school, you\u2019re not allowed -- it was very\nhard. We used to swim in the river -- was a river there, Kamiena -- can\u2019t swim in the\nriver, can\u2019t go outside because God only knows. At least if you\u2019re around the house, you\ncan run in when he comes around with the dog. So what happened was that my sister\ndecided -- Hanya the genius, she had all the books, she was a tutor anyhow, she said\nshe\u2019s going to teach us at home, that will keep us busy. So she opened a little school. I\nwas in her -- in one class with my friends, there were four of us. She was a very strict\ntaskmaster. We had French, we had Latin. I didn\u2019t even finish elementary school and we\nstarted on a much higher level, because first we finished the books that were home and\nthen she proceeded -- that\u2019s, by the way, through the ghetto -- what I\u2019m starting telling\nyou now is still as the war broke out and we\u2019re facing the new reality. So this 1s how to\nkeep the children out of trouble with -- I studied with my sister and whatever it was --\nwas a regular class and very strict and there was homework. And she always kept telling\nme that I -- she expects from me more than from the others, because she knows I can do\nit. And I was very resentful because I had to really -- I mean she lived in the same house\nand she saw that I had to do the homework. Little did I know that my basic education\nreally came -- that was th-the -- the -- the building stone of my f -- later, you know,\nhigher education. But anyhow, so life became very hard. First of all, we were now very\nimpoverished in the sense that we had -- we started selling things, you see. Whatever you\ncould sell, there wa -- first of all, my father did not have a job and we started selling\nthings to suppor -- to su -- not we, I mean I -- you know, I -- I had very little to do with\nthat. I was 10 years old. I -- you know, I wasn\u2019t much, but I\u2019m just telling you how things\nwere. Mother was an excellent cook, so she started doing things like baking cookies with\nwhite beets, sugar beets, which she never did before, she learned that, she -- she cooked\nth -- she put together whatever was possible, but life was basically now -- after the first\ntrauma of the -- of the -- of the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the encyclopedia and th-this --\nthe little things, so called. What -- what set in was hunger and fear, you see. It was so --\neverything was permeated with fear. If father had to go somewhere, even to exchange\nsomething or sell something. To -- to -- to -- to dispose of some possessions, silver or\ncrystals or whatever. You never knew if he was coming back. If -- if mother had to go\nbuy some food somewhere, you never -- the fear was a gripping kind of fear. This is why\nthe children, we were at home, just locked in -- no-not like prisoners, because life was\nwonderful and you read books, you -- I read Tolstoy. I mean, I was 10 years old, I was\nreading Tolstoy. Not that I -- I probably understood some, but I read War and Peace\nwhen I was 10 years old. Because all the books were, you know, whatever was home, I\nread it. Was 1n Polish, obviously. The thing 1s that the fear was probably the most\ncrippling until we got -- we didn\u2019t get used to it -- until we learned how to call -- to -- to\nfit 1t into -- into th-the-the -- the life, you see. Of course I don\u2019t have to tell you, they\nwere -- they were shooting people right and left. Then they started -- the factory was\nalready going, still Christians only. They started picking Jews -- able, you know, able\nJews, send them in the factory and very soon it became apparent that they have some\nplan. Now, nobody knew what plan, but people said, \u201cIf you can have a job, you\u2019ll be\nsafe.\u201d Safe from what, we didn\u2019t know. We were thrown out of that apartment, the street\nwas cleared of Jews, because that was the main street. Probably in 1940, early in 1940.\nSo we lived a few more months in the apartment, but we were already very poor and --\nanyhow, then we got moved further into Wierzbnik, you see, I told you we were between\nStarachowice and Wierzbnik on the main thi -- on the main street. We got pushed into\nWierzbnik. There was no ghetto or anything like that yet. It\u2019s just that this was the\nnumber one street to be cleared of Jews. And the Jews lived wherever, but they lived\nfurther down. And by which time my parents had to sell some pieces because I\u2019Il -- the\napartment we moved in wasn\u2019t the same size, so that was, in a way, better that they -- you\nknow, they could get some money and we could live on that. And as the word got out that\npeople were -- able bodied men might be of use. And they started taking Jews into the\nfactory there, you see? This 1s the first time that any Jew ever worked. But by now this\nwas a munitions plant. They were producing shells -- cannon shells. You see, they\ndiscontinued -- I understand you can convert such plants. They discontinued all that pre-\nwar, consumer kind of goods into warm -- war production. And of course there was a\nJewish council set up. My father was not part of 1t. We were not part of any -- anything\nlike that. Not that this was bad, good or in between, my father just wasn\u2019t. He was\nbasically a guy who -- who -- he was not a merchant and he, you know, he -- he was not\nrich by then, because by 1938, we really, I mean we lived such fantastic lives and then\neverything started changing when he was booted out of the job. Anyhow, during that\nperiod, from the time that we were eli-eliminated -- expelled from that main street, until\nsuch time as they formed -- the Germans -- the Nazis formed a specific area for a ghetto,\nwe changed apartments three times. Every time we got into this apartment, then this was\noff-limits. So then we were in another apartment and that was off-limits. And finally --\nthere was never -- this is a very important distinction to make. In Starachowice -- by the\nway, the -- the ghetto was in Wierzbnik, you see. In Wierzbnik or Starachowice -- I\nshould really refer to 1t as Starachowice, there was never a ghetto like a Warsaw ghetto or\nlike a Lodz ghetto with a -- with -- with a gate -- with the fences, no. The Jews were\nbeing cleared constantly, from this area -- as I told you, we had to go three times from\none apartment to the next, to the next. From this area here and then from this area, until\nthey picked an area where the Jews could live, but no other area. In other w -- we\ncouldn\u2019t live on Putsaskago any more, you see? We could only -- we now lived on the\nstreet called Yuzhetska. But the Christians, who lived there prior -- before us, also lived\nthere. You see? So I remembered there was in Starachowice, Wierzbnik had this -- two\ncemeteries, the old cemetery and the new cemetery. After -- past the old cemetery was a\nlittle house -- a teamster, a man with a horse and -- and -- he -- he had a wagon and a\nhorse, he was a teamster, had a little house with two room -- two, like two apartments,\nback to back. So he rented this one apartment to us, was a kitchen with a big room. And\nthey lived in the similar -- in this -- this, and he was Christian. This is our last -- this was\nour last apartment. And it was within the confines of the ghetto, but the ghetto was not\nseparated or segregated. People went from the ghetto to work in the factory and back.\nFrom the work and back. At that time, as I was telling you, my sister was my best\nteacher. Not my best -- we were continuing. As we moved, we were continuing, cause the\nkids that were studying with me, were also --",
        "A: Yes. Okay. Good time for me --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I do remember that when we dropped off -- that when the tape ended, that I\ndid want to specify the dates, to more or less put 1t within a framework. The first phase of\nthe occupation was the time when we lived on the main street, I -- up to the point at\nwhich we were thrown out of there. Meaning September 30, 1939 is the war started. By\nearly 1940, it -- we were cleared -- we were thrown out of the -- our own apartment.\nWhile we lived in that -- at that -- that stretch of time during the war, as I was saying\nbefore, we -- children, of course had to watch out because of the dogs and the Nazis and\nsuch, we were terrified of them. I think I spend at least 10 hours a day studying.\nAbsolutely didn\u2019t go anywhere. And when we were rees -- when we resettled, within the\nconfines of an area, which was designated as a future ghetto, we had three more\napartments before we ended up 1n the last one, which was our last home in Starachowice,\nbefore the alseelung, before the town was cleared of the Jews. What I meant to say is that\nthat entire period -- that entire ghetto period, no matter where we lived, in the stretch of\nthese resettlements, the object was to keep the children ins -- indoors. We were kept -- I\nwas kept indoors. My sisters were kept indoors because they were my teachers. The\noldest one, Hanya was -- was conducting the class and so on. That lasted up to the minute\nwhen the town was cleared of Jews, no matter where we lived. Life was still -- my\nparents tried to keep it very -- as -- as normal as possible, which was totally impossible to\n-- to live a normal life. But to protect us the best way they could. To have us continue\nstudying and -- and reading and -- and feeling that there is this other world, with which\nwe don\u2019t have for the time being, but eventually we\u2019ll still have it, type of attitude. I also\nmentioned in the previous tape that some people decided that they would sign up for the\nwork in the factory, because the word got around that this might be a good thing to do.\nMy two sisters, very late -- I don\u2019t know whether it was -- could have been early 1942 or\nlate in 1941, signed up -- they went and were signed up and they were -- they were sent\nto a brick factory, also in our hometown, not in the major -- the munitions factory. So\nthey went to -- there were three shifts and I think they rotated, however it was. The point\nof it all 1s this -- that when the town was to be cleared -- when the town was cleared in\n1942, in October, my two sisters were on the night shift in that brick factory. They were\nnot released, as none of the workers were allowed to leave. They were kept back.\nWhether it was the munitions factory or the brick factory, the workers were kept back,\nbecause meanwhile there was a round-up in what has now become -- is very small area of\na ghetto, still not surrounded by wire or anything like the other ghettos that -- we know\nabout Warsaw ghetto. So that, by this time, there were only a few streets where the Jews\nwere allowed to live and those Poles, Christian Poles who still lived there, lived there, but\nother than that, there were very few Poles. We were all squeezed in, I can\u2019t tell you how\nmany people to a room, but it was crowded, 1t was crowded. Meanwhile, there were\nshipments coming in from Lodz -- from the Lodz ghetto, people were shipped in and\nfrom other areas and -- and we were all being crowded in and crowded in until the day of\nOctober 27, 1942. As I said, my sisters were in the mun -- in the brick factory and five\no\u2019clock in the morning, maybe six, I don\u2019t remember -- early in the morning, we heard\nthe knock on the door, eiler rouse and we weren\u2019t allowed to take anything, just to get\nout. And -- as fast as we could and the -- the Nazis were there with the rifles and the guns\nand the dogs and with -- they had sort of like a -- you know the type of thing that you hit\na horse with?",
        "A: A whip, yes -- with the whips. And I -- I was used to the whips because whenever\nthey marched by themselves, whenever they walked the -- the streets in the town, they\nalways carried a whip. They always had guns, but they also carried whips. And we were\nordered out very quickly -- out of the house and point -- said we have to walk to the main\nsquare. Of course, we meaning -- was my father, my mother and myself, because my two\nsisters were kept back and we absolutely had no idea what was happening. I certainly\ndidn\u2019t. Maybe my parents did, but they didn\u2019t say and we didn\u2019t know what the people in\nthe factories are going to be doing. Meanwhile or later, with -- anyhow, when we came to\nthe main square -- the distance between the house and the main square was maybe about\nthree quarter miles, maybe a mile at the most. But the sights between the house and the\nmain square were the most horrendous. That was the real brutal -- naked brutality, as I\nwas forced to -- to -- to see en masse, the first time. Because, you know, I saw shooting\nhere and a shoot -- beating there and all kinds of things I did see, but I didn\u2019t see so many\nacts of brutality up to that point. We\u2019re talking now about 1942 in October. I have never\nseen such brutality with -- in the -- the numbers involved. The infants thrown against the\nwalls and -- and the old people beaten and kicked and shot as they couldn\u2019t walk, or if\nthey could walk. The whole scene, between the house, which we had to leave and the\nsquare where we had to line up, was one horrendous bloodbath. The most brutal sight I\nhave ever seen up to that point and of course, I\u2019ve seen plenty. I\u2019ve seen all kinds of\ncruelty prior to that, but nothing in such concentrated form. And we -- on the way we\npicked up -- my mother had to -- my mother didn\u2019t have to, we were walking, they were -\n- my parents were holding me by the hand and -- I was a skinny child. My mother padded\nme up with all kinds of rags, to make me look like I was developed, which I was nothing.\nShe put rougema on my cheeks, so I would look more grown. I was tall, so I could sort of\nmake myself look older if I tried. And on the way, mother noticed a friend of hers, an\nelderly lady, Miss -- Mrs. Kazimerzka, who couldn\u2019t move and so m-mother took her by\nthe -- under the arm, like and my father took me by the hand and the four of us walked\ntogether to the square. And of course when we came to the square, the acts of brutality\nhas only -- had only in-intensified, because it was a real -- like a butchery. You know, it\nwas the killing and the kicking and the -- and the -- th-this was already after the walk\ntoward the center. The center was you had to line up and not everybody knew how to line\nup and where to line up and people were frantic and people were crying and people were\npraying and the Germans wouldn\u2019t stand for any of that, they would kick and they would\nsaid, \u201cYou move fast.\u201d And then you didn\u2019t move fast, whatever it was, it was a\nterrifying scene and as we were approaching it, they pointed people to different\ndirections. There were groups all around. Well, I was pointed in one direction, my father\nwas pointed in another direction and mother, with Mrs. Kazimerzka, who -- Mother was\nholding Mrs. Kazimerzka, to another group. No-Nobody knew which group is which or\nwhich group was going where. We had no idea, by then, that there were trains already\nwaiting on -- at the siding, because as I said, we were in the ghetto, meaning we were not\nallowed outside of that area. And the railroad station was outside of that area. So very\nsoon -- it was also very hot, I remember this was very hot. My group was driven one way\nand I noticed that we were driven toward th-th-the -- toward Starachowice area, where\nthe factory was. And I found myself in the -- in a place called Shellneetsa, which\ntranslated means fir-firing range. This was at one time a firing range and now there were\nbarracks built there. I\u2019ve never heard of the place, I\u2019ve never seen the place, I had no\nidea. I knew I was still in Starachowice because it wasn\u2019t far from the -- the -- the plant,\nfrom the factory. Well, when we found ourselves there, I realized that my sisters weren\u2019t\nthere, my mother wasn\u2019t there and my father wasn\u2019t there, not the way I saw it, but later\non it turned out that he was, but I didn\u2019t know it yet, be-because he was with a group of\nmen who were lined up and brought to Shellneetsa and -- and put -- their group was\npointed to another place where I couldn\u2019t see. Anyhow, I was absolutely petrified, I was -\n- | -- I was out of my mind with fear, with total -- I always compare the feeling of fear for\nthe duration of the war and I think the fear most acute was that fear, that time when I\nfound myself alone. I was so alone and I absolutely didn\u2019t know what was going to\nhappen. And people were always very kind to me and these were people from my\nhometown, say, \u201cNo, don\u2019t cry, we\u2019re going to get together with everybody eventually\nand everything will be fine.\u201d Anyhow, I did find out father was in the same unit -- the\nsame Shellneetsa camp and what transpired -- what we found out, the extent to which I\nfound out about these things that I knew what happened. That some people -- among who\nmy mother was -- were put on trains and sent somewhere. Resettled was -- was the\neuphemism, resettled. Didn\u2019t mean anything -- but didn\u2019t know any -- I didn\u2019t know\ndirection east, west, south or north, somewhere resettled. Father was in the Shellneetsa\ncamp. He became a scribe. He always kept books and typewrite -- you know, typing and\nall this, so he did that and the two sisters, I -- we understood, were now in another camp\nthat was called Mioufka and that camp housed the people from the brick factory, because\nit was closer to the brick factory. Shellneetsa was very close to the munitions factory.\nWell, I cannot remember the dates when the -- the date when the two camps were\ncombined, but they were combined and we lived -- I met my sisters and the camp became\nmy ufecach. Shellneetsa was empty, because Shellneetsa itself, I -- I -- I never know the\nreasons why things were happening, I just know that life in Shellneetsa was dreadful,\neverybody had typhus. I worked in the laundry, in the camp laundry. I had typhus. I had\nwhat they called a mild case, because I said, they say if you are a child, you have a milder\ncase. Because my sister had typhus, the oldest one, Hanya, she was stricken by the\nseverest case of typhus. She had hallucinations, she was out of her head, she was burning\nout with fever and she was talking out of -- out of proportion to anything that -- that --\nthat would mean anything. And, you know, the -- the -- the camp guards made selections\nwhile the f -- the epidemic was going on, so you had to come out and line up and\nhowever you stood up, they could see that you are another case to be disposed of. So one\nway or another, Hanya was propped up and -- and -- and he-held up and she didn\u2019t talk\nand -- and so you couldn\u2019t see that she was out of her mind completely. I went into the\nlaundry room and there were these older ladies who took pity on me and they opened the\nbig cauldrons with the steam and I stood behind -- this -- this was not the same time as\nHanya was sick, because this was 1n -- you know, whatever the -- th-the -- the -- however\nit was one was sick. Now, three weeks later, or for whatever. But when my time came to\nhave typhus, and there was another -- course the selections were always going on. Didn\u2019t\nonly have to do with typhus, let me just finish this about the cauldron. I stood behind the\ncauldron with the steam, so that you saw me all burning up, but of course I could have\nbeen burning up from the steam from the cauldron, from the laundry and this is how I -- I\n-- I survived typhus selection. But basically, the -- the slave labor camp in my hometown\nhad selections all the time, typhus or not, because they were using these Jews, able\nbodied Jews, as long as they could. And once people got sick -- and of course there was\nno medication, there were no doctors and there was nothing. One people -- once people\ngot sick, you had to dispose of them, you see? So in Shellneetsa, they d-dug a pit in the\nforest and they shot the people over the pit. In Mioufka the same. So it really -- you\ndidn\u2019t have to have typhus to fear being eliminated. Because if you had to line up before\nthe barrack and they didn\u2019t like the way you looked, one way or another, typhus or not,\nyou could be shot there -- right there on the spot, anyhow. And they still needed an\noperational number -- number of people to do the jobs, because this was a factory that\nwas around the clock, 24 hours, with three shifts and so they were shipping in new people\nall the time. Wherever they got these people, we don\u2019t know, but they were getting these\npeople, shipping them in, to supplement those numbers that were needed for the factory\nwork. And I don\u2019t know whether I mentioned it before, but the -- probably not -- that the\nadministration of the camps was -- the highest echelon were the Germans, the SS, I think\nand the Gestapo. And everything u-under them were the Ukrainians and they wore\nGerman uniforms. The -- wasn\u2019t the same color as the German, but it was a German\nuniform with Germany insignia. Now, they were the primary overseers. They mow --\nthey manned the towers -- the watchtowers, because you know, these camps were now\nsurrounded by barbed wire. And of course you had to walk still, from the camp to the\nfactory and back. And that was three shifts a day. So they were the ones who counted the\npeople going and marched them out of the gate and marched them back. They were the\nones who were lining people up for the ind -- inside selections, which were conducted by\nthe Nazis, the German Nazis. With -- as I told you, the selections did not wait for typhus\nto -- to -- to be rampant, they just had selections, at any time of the day or night, if they\nplease like it -- if they pleased, if they felt like it. They chased you out and they -- this --\nhere and here and there and pointed you this way and before you knew it, you ended up\nin the woods being shot. So the Ukrainians were very brutal. Sometimes I felt they were\nworse than the Germans. They probably tried to prove themselves, or whichever it was,\nthey were horrendously cruel. There was cruelty be -- above and beyond the call of duty,\nyou know, the type of cruelty, the spitting, the kicking, the -- they used to use rifle butts\nto hit you over the head if you didn\u2019t line up exactly right. Anyhow --",
        "A: Oh, yes. Oh, absolutely, absolutely. We were separated from the men, you know. The\nwomen lived in women\u2019s barracks, the men in the men. But for the line up for the factory\n-- in fact, at one time, I also went to work in the factory and I don\u2019t remember how long I\nworked there. I think before the two camps combined, while I was still in Shellneetsa, I\nthink they were short or something like that. They put me up to working in the factory\nand I actually worked on one of the machinery, on the machines. The job was -- you\nknow, I was already a 13 - 14 year old girl and it wasn\u2019t a job that a 14 year couldn\u2019t\nhandle. Because what it meant is that the -- the artillery shells, you had to put it on the\nmachine and put a type of knife to it, that was part of the machine and the knife scraped\nthe first layer of the -- of the -- of the -- no, not cannon, the shell -- the shell, cannon\nshell. And then you took it off and you put it on the one end and then you reached for the\nother. Of course you were being watched all the time and you had to deliver a num -- a\ncertain number of these shells had to be peeled. Peeled is the w -- it\u2019s not the word, but if\nyou know what I mean. That outer shell had to be peeled and that was the job. And I\nworked for a time -- that was brutal work and I saw the men -- th-the Jewish men work at\nthe open ovens, you know, where the -- the smelting was done and where -- that was 1n-\nincredible -- that was just incredible. And when they were shaping these cannons and\nthey were taking them out from the hot oven with the -- like big pincers, you know, and\nputting them down. Anyhow, I worked there for a very short time, because when the\ncamps were finally combined -- and I -- I can\u2019t give the year, but was between October\n1942 and end of July 1944. So I don\u2019t remember exactly how long I lived on Shellneetsa\nand how many months I worked in the factory, but I do know that when we were\ntransferred, the two camps were combined and we all lived on Mioufka. I went back to\nthe laundry again. So here we were able, again, to see my father, but we never talk --\ncouldn\u2019t -- you know, here and there, we could maybe say something as we were passing,\nbut we knew he was there, he knew we were there and the men\u2019s barracks were on the\nother side, but we still, there was a way of waving or seeing or -- not touching or\nwhatever, but he knew we were there and -- and most families that ended up in the camp\ncould one way or another communicate. The life was very, very hard. Very, very hard.\nWe -- you know it\u2019s so hard to come back to talk about the hunger, because hunger was\nas present as -- as -- as the blood runs in your -- in your -- in your veins, you know? From\nthe day the war broke out, we knew nothing but hunger. But there was always a way of\nscraping together -- of -- of selling some things and getting money and getting some\nfood, but when you finally ended up in the camps, unless you really had big money, there\nwas no way that you could survive on what was given to you. We were very lucky,\nbecause we had -- my mother -- my parents had very dear Christian friends and before we\nwere thrown out of the original apartment, Mother begged them to take s -- to take -- to --\nto -- to save for us, some of the more personal things like little silver Passover drinking\ncups -- \u2019ll show you, I have one. The candlesticks, some crystal, some other things that\nwere inscribed, my parents wedding gifts and silver that had inscriptions and such. So\nthey took all of that, those -- sh -- they absolutely wouldn\u2019t want to do it. Th-they -- they\nsaid, \u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t give it to us.\u201d Mother says, \u201cI\u2019m not giving it to you,\nI -- \u2019'm asking you to just keep it for us.\u201d Well, it so happens that husband of -- this was\nmy parent\u2019s friends, there were a few sisters, married. One of the husbands worked 1n the\nmunitions factory, Christian. And he was able -- they were -- started selling -- they\nstarted selling -- because w-we send word that we need money desperately -- they started\nselling some of the things they had, valuable things. He would bring us and he would buy\nstuff and bring it to the factory and he would send it through people who worked in the\nfactory, so that -- in the Shellneetsa camp and even in the Mioufka camp, we still lived on\nstuff and money that they would -- they would send in the money or some bread or\nwhatever. And we could not have probably survived without that. And --",
        "A: Yes, there was -- there was always barter, because people -- you see, in the factory,\nthe Jews mixed with the Poles, you see? The Jews were slave labor, but the Poles were\nthe workers that -- the Jews, obviously were not the only ones working there. The local\nPoles worked in the factory, so some of these Jews who -- who had a way of mixing with\nthe people in the factory, had a way of bartering and sending, or -- you know. So this is\nhow we were able to really not die of hunger in -- 1n that -- in Starachowice labor camp.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Well, specifically, the people who went to work, went on an eight hours shift.\nThey were taken there by the Ukrainians, they were brought back. There was soup being\ndoled out for them. After that, you had to stay in your bunk, because there was no place\nto go and you were absolutely petrified to go outside, because if you showed yourself, the\nUkrainian or the -- the -- the Nazi German could kill you or decide to -- he wanted you to\n-- to do some other job. The worst way was to hide. So the labor in the factory was very\nhard. When you don\u2019t eat and you work so hard, all you can do when you come home is\njust drop and you just stay until they call you again. I personally worked in the laundry,\nwhere it -- everybody brought in the stuff that they wore, that was full of lice and\neverything, put it in the cauldron and we would push it with sticks and cook -- boil it.\nAnd then, after it dried, everybody would come and -- and be handed out. I mean, if you\nwere size 12, you got size 95. If you were size 14, you got size six, whatever th -- you\nknow, so what you had, you had and what you didn\u2019t have, you didn\u2019t have next time or\nyou did -- anyhow, this is how things were. The camp itself was, as I said, with barbed\nwire. It had th-th-th tower guards. There was no mixing of -- of men and women. Father\nwas a scribe again and he -- we saw him. We saw him because he worked 1n a little\noffice, like a place. So sometimes if there was business to go in that barrack where the\noffice was, we saw him. And people who went to work, as I told you, were absolutely ex\n-- exhausted beyond words when they would come back. There was no way of staying\nclean, you see. That was the bad part. In the Shellneetsa camp, there was a little brook\nrunning through, so people would go and wash themselves, even in the winter. Men\nwould undress and wash their bodies in the win -- but in Mioufka, there was -- you have\nto scrounge to get a -- a basin of water and everybody would wash up at the same time,\nyou know. It was -- lice -- lice were -- 1-1-1t w -- it was a plague of lice that was even\nmaybe not as bad as in Auschwitz, but 1t was very bad. Those were the two major things,\nhunger and lice. Of course, sickness too, but you didn\u2019t know, because once you got sick,\nyou -- that was the end of you anyhow. No matter how -- and I\u2019m not talking big\nsicknesses, typhus, but even an infection, if you -- if infection went an-any higher than an\narm and got you into a body infection, forget it. So th-they said they didn\u2019t have doctors.\nThey had little infirmary, I remember, where was that? In Mioufka, I think. That was -- I\nthink for show, because nobody who was really sick ever made it anywhere, except a gun\nto his head, so.",
        "A: Well this, I really -- you see, I think some women stopped menstruating. I personally\nnever started. Of course I was too young. I never started. I wasn\u2019t developed, I was flat\nlike a board and I never menstruated, not til the -- two years after the war. This -- I don\u2019t\nknow, they used to say -- I\u2019m sort of getting ahead of myself, but you asked me the\nquestion. Wom -- | heard it said in Auschwitz that they put something in the -- in the\nfood. They used to call it brum -- brum. I really don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what it wa --\nwhatever it was. That they -- women in Auschwitz didn\u2019t menstruate as far as I know,\nbecause they said that that was brum that was in the food. This is -- could be he-hearsay\nand could be -- might not be in any way part of the truth. I\u2019m just saying that this 1s what\nI remembered because everybody was saying that I had nothing to worry about, since I\nnever started, I wouldn\u2019t start it in Auschwitz for sure, because there was brum in the\nfood.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know who could -- whoever -- the -- the food was cooked -- in Auschwitz, this\nwas community cooking, whatever it was. The same was here. This was community\ncooking, you see? And people here, in the camp, in Mioufka camp or Shellneetsa camp,\nstill had that little piece of bread from here or there, from the town Polish people, who --\nwho bought stuff and brought in and wa -- that. But, no, those were the two major\nproblems. Not -- not two major problems and only a million others when you feared for\nyour life every second, but the daily hunger and the lice, that was like a -- something\nnever left you, never for a second. And still living -- living in Starachowice camp with\nlocal women and some -- really newcomers, but it really was still a homogenous type of\ngroup, you see? It wasn\u2019t like later on in Auschwitz when you were mixed with the\nworld, nobody knew who you were then, couldn\u2019t care less. I personally owe my survival\nvery much to people who -- who looked after me. Not just my sisters, you know, which\nthey did. They are responsible for my survival, but other people because there was\nalways the connection, they remember me as that skinny kid or whatever. They took pity\non me. They always helped me, people always helped me. Always. I don\u2019t know why, I\nmust have been a sorry sight. I must have been, you know, an undernourished, skinny kid\nlooks like a devil probably, like a skeleton. So, I don\u2019t know. But this was still a\nhomogenous group that made you feel that you are still attached to some kind of life that\nwas your own. You know, at that t -- before this life, because in Auschwitz, you already\ndoubted yourself, that you came from another life, because how could that be? You were\na million years away from something that was normal. And here there wasn\u2019t anybody\nwho even knew that you -- who you were or whatever, you see? So life in Starachowice\nlabor camps -- I said camps because you know, the two -- was still very much normal.\nAnd this lasted til 1944, where the camp was loaded onto trains into tr -- into Auschwitz.\nThat was end of July or early August. And we didn\u2019t know why, because obviously we\nnever knew why anything was happening, nobody told us and they certainly kept it from\nus on purpose. But a rumor was that the Russian front was nearing from the east and of\ncourse later on, we found out in Auschwitz that all these labor camps that were situated in\nthis heart of Poland, that did war production for the Germans were liquidated about the\ntime we were. And so we\u2019re talking now about 1944, end of July.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Very.",
        "A: Well, well, would you believe it, we were singing. We sang songs, we remember a lot\nof poetry, Polish poetry, it\u2019s true. To this day I remember Polish poetry. Not just Polish, I\nremember Shakespeare in Polish. \u201cMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d I remember. \u201cDiz bed\nbiedna sheetem shezak nie.\u201d\u201d You know, I remember these hard pieces to this day, a\nmillion years later. Well, anyhow, no, we were -- we knew mother did not get resettled.\nThat was finally brought back to us one way or another. That the train that left\nStarachowice during the ulseedlung, during the vished lenya, or whatever, clearing of the\nJews, did not get resettled, 1t got sent straight into Treblinka. So mother perished and we\nknew it. I mean we -- that much we -- because everybody knew that nobody from that --\nfrom our home people survived, that went on that train. My sisters and I were very, very,\nvery close. We told the -- talked about old times, we recited poetry, we sung, we were\nhungry, we were terribly, terribly hungry. We saw father every now and then. He got\nvery aged or very old looking. He wasn\u2019t an old man. He broke -- his spirit was broken,\nyou could see that. He was gray and he -- he was a cigarette smoker and now he coughed\nconstantly, you know. He had this bad cough and -- but the fact that we were around and\nhe saw all these other people, you know. We were, after all -- probably 80 percent of that\ncamp was still people from our hometown. So that more or less kept his spirit up, in that\nsense that people were trying to think back to good things and -- and -- and -- and -- and\nrehash and rehash. I used to dream, there and in Auschwitz, about the way the table -- my\nmother set the table. I don\u2019t know, I -- I must have had the hang up about -- hang up\nabout cooking or whatever, serving. I remembered the beautiful way the table was set. So\nI used to dream about it, you know. She had that artistic touch of setting the table. And I s\n-- we talked about it and we -- we talked about it 50 times, all the time of the same kind\nof this con-conversation. And of course father was around, that was a great consolation\nand when we came to Auschwitz, that was the last time we saw our father.",
        "A: We talked about the liquidation of the camp in Starachowice, when we were loaded up\non the train and on the way to Auschwitz. Now, there is a very important point here I\nwanted to bring up. You know, people say, well why didn\u2019t anybody do this and they\ndidn\u2019t rebel and peoples went like sheep to the slaughter. When the two camps were\ncombined, Shellneetsa and s -- and Mioufka and people were still employed by the\nfactories, living was sort of made to -- to -- generally speaking, people should be able to\nsleep and -- and -- and have a place and because they had to work next day. Just before --\ntoward the end of July, just before we were sent to Auschwitz, we were moved out of the\nlast camp, which was Mioufka, into something that was sort of like a camp, but it wasn\u2019t,\nbecause it was people just shoved into some kind of barracks and there was m-many\nmore guards with towers. And this particular enclosure was very near the siding -- the\nrailroad siding, because you know, a factory that operates, has to have a railroad siding.\nWell, that was a siding that was right adjacent to that third place, which was a camp, but\nwasn\u2019t a camp. It was like -- I can\u2019t quite describe it to you. Well, what happened is,\nsomehow the word got around that this is the end -- this is the end. Now when we\u2019re\ngetting shipped, we\u2019re really going to go like the people originally went -- wherever it\nwas they went -- we\u2019re not being resettled, this 1s for sure. We\u2019re just going to be killed.\nSo the same night, some young fellows and strong young women, tried to break out. The\nca -- that place -- I'll call 1t camp again, but it was a place, a -- like a -- a pen -- type of a\npen, you know -- had a wooden fence and behind it, wire -- on top of 1t wire. No, barbed\nwire. That night bef, -- the day -- th-the night before we were actually shipped to\nAuschwitz, some people decided to run away and they pulled out a few of the planks\nfrom the wooden fence and as soon as that happened, whoever felt this was the\nopportunity, started running that way. The German guards were shooting out of -- no, th-\nthese were Ukrainians, probably. Ukrainian guards started shooting right into this -- th-\nthe moving bodies, the reflectors, you know, they started sending them. Before you knew\nit there were dogs, there were -- all the Germans were out. Some people made it out, the\nrest didn\u2019t and there was a heap of bodies right at that opening. Whether everybody there\nwas already dead, or whether he was just d-dying, only a few people made it out. And\none of them was my brother-in-law and he made it out, the Canadian brother-in-law, he\nmade it out. But the others, I don\u2019t know how many people made ou -- made it out of that\n-- thr -- because th-the hole was very narrow and by the time they got going, it was\nalready too late. And there was a woman that was shot in the legs. She -- they let her die\nall night long, in the middle of the -- of that area and her agonies -- cries of agony went\non all night long. They did -- they -- obviously they weren\u2019t going to shoot her to kill her,\nbecause they wanted that to teach other people a lesson. And she was begging to be\nkilled. She was in -- in terrible agony. She kept yelling that her legs were shot off, I don\u2019t\nknow. Because she was laying 1n the middle and we heard her. Well, next morning, we\nwere put on the trains, there wasn\u2019t -- probably not even any marching to do because the\ntrain was right there. We were put on the train. Again, we had no idea where we were\ngoing. Women in separate cars and the men in other cars. And it so happens that the last\ncar where the men were, had my father in it. And the first car where the women were, had\nus in it. So that when we arrived in Auschwitz -- and we had no idea where we were\ngoing and we were unloaded on the platform, we saw my father in the group with the\nmen. Because they were, this was the tail end of the men th -- contingent. And we were\nfirst in the women\u2019s contingent, so we still saw him, he saw us. And that was the end. We\nnever, ever saw him again. People from my hometown who did survive Auschwitz told\nus that after he arrived in Auschwitz, he totally gave up. He was -- he was a man that was\nlost to the world. He got very sick, his legs were swollen and of course he was killed and\ncremate -- I mean he was -- he went out like everybody else, through the chimney. And\nwe were told this was in October. You see, we arrived in August in Auschwitz, early\nAugust. So he lived maybe not quite two months. He still lived, but of course we never\nsaw him. But we were told what happened, that he was -- h-he -- I think his spirit was\ngone and th -- everything just went after that and he -- he gave up. I don\u2019t really, truly\nknow what was his work assignment so to say, because you know labor in -- in -- in\nAuschwitz was not labor, it was just work to make you -- to exhaust you, you know.",
        "A: Yes, on the platform, yes. He saw us, we knew he saw us, because you know, we sort\nof communicated. And -- you couldn\u2019t wave, obviously, but he saw us, because he was at\nthe tail end of that group, that -- from which we were separated. So he knew that the three\nof us were together and that was the last we saw him. So, you see, my mother was -- my\nmother went to Treblinka in October \u201842 and my father just lived two more years and -- if\nyou call that life -- so he perished in Auschwitz.",
        "A: Well, the first thing obviously was to be tattooed. You know, they wouldn\u2019t let you\nanywhere without being tattooed. So we decided that we were going to line up one next\nto the other, because we knew by then that, you know, numbers are in sequence and if\nyou have numbers in sequence, you have a chance to -- to -- to be within that number --\ngroup number. So my oldest sister Hanya, Anna had the first num -- whatever the number\nwas. Kris, Krisha, the second, had the second number and I had the third. So we had a\nsequence of numbers. And it proved to be lifesaving because at Auschwitz, as you know,\nthere were no names any more, there were just numbers. If they needed a contingent of\npeople, they would call numbers, let say from 15 to 95. You see? So -- it so happens,\nwhenever we were sent somewhere, we were called by that -- we were lucky enough -- of\ncourse sometimes you can be cut off at the num -- end of the number too, but it so\nhappens that our numbers were always in that nu -- group number. And after we were\ntattooed, we were told to disrobe and go into what was called showers. Nobody knew\nwhat that was and there was one chimney going, you could see fire coming out. One\ncrematorium, because by then, you know, this -- this 1s 1944, August and the war isn\u2019t\ngoing so well for the Germans, so I understand that they have destroyed some of the\ncrematories. One was still belching fire when we came. The smell was incredible,\nincredible. And of course, at night, you could see the fire against the sky. And I don\u2019t\nknow, I must have rationalized that fire somehow. You know why? Because 1n my\nhometown, when they used to melt the ore -- smelt the ore, they used to -- my hometowns\nwas sort of hilly. They used to bring the lorries with the hot s -- the leftover from the --\nfrom the ve -- the ore that was smelted out of it. The leftover was called jujer, lighting it\u2019s\ncauks or whatever it was called. They used to pour it out from those lorries, over the --\nover the embankment of the hills, so that you saw a -- like a long -- now what? Like a\nbelt, you know? Pass, what is the word? Just escaped me. Anyhow, when you saw the --\nthe -- the -- this -- this -- this lava type of a fire pouring down and I knew this was just\nmelting -- this was fire. It looked like fire at night, you see, if you ever saw it. When I\nwas in Auschwitz, maybe I -- I always thought of it. Maybe I rationalized. When I saw\nthat flame going out of the chimney -- they said to me, \u201cYou know they\u2019re burning\npeople in there.\u201d But I said to myself, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s -- what is there is that what I saw as\na child when I saw that flame in the dark. The stuff that poured out of the lorries, you\nknow -- of the -- of the -- the byproduct of the smelting.\u201d But of course was a big -- as\nthey say a pipe dream, because this was the true burning flesh, which you could smell.\nYou could almost touch it, that\u2019s how pervasive it was. And we -- I don\u2019t know how\nmuch I knew, if anything, that the -- Auschwitz, the name or the -- the -- the whole --\nwhat it was all about. Except that now, having been shifted so many times, you know,\nfrom the ghetto to a camp, to another camp, to another holding place, you know, this was\njust another place, you know. And when we came in, we were held on what was called\nquarantine. The situation in Auschwitz was different too, you see, because by now, the --\nsome of the crematories were -- were gone, but they were still burning and they were still\neliminating people as fast as they could, but I don\u2019t know what the projection of time was\nwith them, how they were going to do it all. They put us on the -- what you -- what 1s\ncalled quarantine, which meant nothing. It meant they give us wo-work to do that was\nmeaningless. There was a pile of rocks here on one end and there was a pile of rocks on\nthe other end of the camp. You had to -- very heavy -- you carried the rocks from this end\nto the e-end, to the other. And then you went over to the other side and carried them\nback. In fact, in one of those rock carrying ex-expeditions, we saw my aunt, Uncle\nAlexander\u2019s wife with the Radom group. They were -- the Radom ghetto was eli -- of\ncourse, as I told you before, all -- with the Russian offensive coming from the east, all\nthese camps w -- and ghettos and whatever, were being shipped westward. We didn\u2019t\nknow that Uncle Alexander survived. We just knew that his two sons ran away to Russia\nat the beginning of the war, but we didn\u2019t know about Uncle or -- or his wife. Sure\nenough, there we saw her, in Auschwitz, going the other way with the rocks, and we were\ngoing this way. We lived in a barracks, nine people to a bunk, nine women. We slept\nhead to -- head to foot, because nine women Is totally impossible to fit into this kind of an\narea. It was just wooden bunks. As you know, Auschwitz stories -- we had to -- we were\ncounted. We had to line up for role call every morning. During the quarantine, we had to\ndo it more than twice a day. Later on, when we worked outside, we had to once. In the\nmorning once, in the evening, but during quarantine, whenever you went indoors, they\ncalled you out again and you had to line up. And if they didn\u2019t like the way you stood, or\nwhatever, they could just shoot you, which they did. And we were still very much with\nthe original group. Now, when we first arrived and we were -- you know, everybody\u2019s\nhair was cut -- I don\u2019t mean cut, you know, they grabbed alil hair and chopped it off. My\noldest sister Hanya spoke back to the women who was cutting her hair, who was a\nCzechoslovak woman. For that, the Czechoslovak woman called her, \u201cYou Polish pig,\u201d\nand she shaved her head to zero. Totally zero. And they gave us clothes that of course\ndidn\u2019t fit. I don\u2019t have to tell you because they were throwing it at you as you were\npassing out of the -- where the -- where your head was -- where your head was cut. And\nyou just took it, whatever, big, small or in between. Whether it fit or not, you had to\nchange with other people to fit you. And wooden shoes. And the barracks, that was\nanother thing. I mean, lice -- when we talked about lice in Starachowice, that\u2019s one thing,\nwhen you talk about lice in Auschwitz, that was already beyond description. There was a\nl-latrine behind the building. You had to wait your turn. Of course you had to sit with at\nleast 20 other people. They had sort of boards with holes in them -- awful. We\u2019re not\ntalking here in any way privacy or anything, believe me. At the lowest level of human\nexistence, you probably do not encounter this type -- this type of existence. This is below\n-- below what human mind considers as -- as human. This was exhausting work and it\nwas no work. It w -- we were -- we knew we -- we knew that we were expendable,\nbecause we weren\u2019t -- you know, in the factories you knew, \u201cOh, they need us.\u201d You\nknow, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll survive the war because they need us.\u201d Here they couldn\u2019t have\nneeded us, because what we were doing 1s we were taking the rocks from here to there\nand my aunt was bringing the same rocks when we saw her pass by with the other group,\nbringing the same rocks back there. So they didn\u2019t really need us. You see, that much you\ncould figure out. The barracks were run by Czechoslovak women. Very, very cruel --\nextreme. One day -- this -- this subject should really be analyzed. What makes\ncollaborators more cruel than the perpetrators? This is a very important philosophical\nquestion. Because my encounter with the Ukrainians and with the Czech women and with\nall the other collaborators or functionaries of the Nazis, actually exceeded, sometimes,\nthe brutality and the total disregard for the person. And I have an anecdote from that\nperiod, which is -- which compares to the fact when my father was first time caught to go\nand c -- to clean the -- the railroad station, the -- the insult that it was. You know, that --\nat that time, that the insult that he was called a Jew and not a gentleman and that he had\nto s -- clean. When we were in the barracks in Auschwitz and this woman, this Czech\nwoman -- big, hefty, strong, sort of like an animal type. Aronka was her name. I was\ngoing to the latrine, or coming from the latrine and she stood there, she saw me and she\ncalls me over, she always calls me Polish pigs. She always says, \u201cPolska schvina.\u201d She --\nshe -- she called all the women like that. And she put up her foot, she had boots, leather\nboots and told me to clean her -- to polish her boots and I didn\u2019t have anything and she\nsays to spit on it and polish it. I took it as such humiliation. I mean, it\u2019s like my father\u2019s\nhumiliation at the railroad station. In the scheme of things, in this -- in thi -- in this whole\npicture of what was happening, why was I so upset about this? I guess because it was\nperson to person, you know? And she wasn\u2019t a German. She was not supposed to be a\nNazi, she was only the block altester. The supervisor of the barrack. So, why I should\nhave thought that she would be more human or what -- expect -- whatever it was, it was a\nterrible personal insult to me and believe me, I was already beaten up in Auschwitz by an\nSS man by that time. He hit me with a ring, had a heavy ring on the mouth and I was\nbleeding and I -- I was suffering from hunger and from every -- and here, out of\neverything, I should get upset about that. I cried over that. I didn\u2019t cry over the others\nthings. And then of course she kicked me and she -- she didn\u2019t even -- you know, when I\nwas down she kicked me and she told me to go in or whatever. So, th-the first months,\nthat\u2019s -- that was the first very, very disorienting --",
        "A: Very good, yes.",
        "A: Yes. It was very supportive. I'll tell you that -- as I told you, we are s -- we were\ntraveling still with the same group. We are still with the people from my hometown or\neven if they weren\u2019t from my hometown, they were sent in, but they were -- they were\nalready in that group that came from Starachowice. And the relationship was family like.\nEach one was looking out for another. And then I remember, that barrack of ours\nreceived a shipment of people from Salaneeka. Jew -- of course we couldn\u2019t -- Jewish\nwomen from Greece. We couldn\u2019t speak to them. I don\u2019t know that -- whatever. But we\nfelt a kinship, I remembered -- I remember that. I remember that we felt a kinship\nbecause we were a group, we were still a group, you see? Even if -- if -- if you didn\u2019t\nsleep with the -- the nine people, or not all the people, you know, you still were a group.\nAnd I -- you know and I analyze it, I always said because they knew you when, you\nknow. These people were still a connection to your old past and you knew them as these\nother people, you know? Because the rest didn\u2019t seem human in any way. And after this\none month of quarantine, we finally were called on the job, what is called gainful\nemployment, which was -- this could have been the end of us, that\u2019s for sure. It was to cut\ntwigs in the marshes. This is now August, Sept -- something like early October. We had\nto march out so we would be counted. Now it\u2019s strictly roll call twice a day. They count\nus out, we had to stand -- whoever didn\u2019t look right got shot or got send out, because you\ncouldn\u2019t go to work any more. We would march through those gates, you know, are bike\nmarkt fry and out to the marshes, we would cut marshes. We would stand in water, cut\nthe marshes, they would bring in cauldrons of -- of soup that\u2019s -- you know, the\nAuschwitz soup. We were fed that and then we would come back at night, count, go to --\nto -- to sleep and get up in the morning and start again. And we worked there I think for a\nmonth. And this is also in my mind, you know -- sa -- th -- always there 1s -- always say a\nsnippet of a remembrance that -- that comes out of every horrible experience that sticks in\nyour mind. Just like Aronka with the shoes -- why I should cry over having to -- to -- to\nbe humiliated like this, I don\u2019t know. But then there was another aspect of this kind or\nremembrance -- this kind of remembrance, the -- you know, from the general to the\nparticular, we were marching to the march -- to the marshes. And there were these private\ndwellings, private homes around it -- alon-along the route. And I think the German\nguards lived there or whoever. Because it was so near Ausch -- near the camp that you\ncouldn\u2019t possibly have strangers. I don\u2019t know. Whoever lived there had to know\neverything that was going on. So I don\u2019t know who lived there. But anyhow, those were\nnormal houses, they had geranium boxes in the window. They had pillows airing in the\nwindows. And it broke my heart to see that people were actually living a life from which\nwe were -- we came, too, but 1t was nothing 1n any way to compare to -- how to judge our\nown existence. You see, there was this life, these people got up in the morning, it was a\nbeautiful day, cold or hot, was beautiful, dry. You put the windows u -- put the windows\nopen, you put the pillows in the window. That\u2019s what people did in Poland, you know.\nAnd people had geranium boxes in the window. And of course our own assessment of\nwho we were, wer -- was -- was already far away from what we really thought we were.\nBecause we were in -- so dehumanized in the process of all these particular humiliations\nand the group humiliations and the murder and the -- and -- and watching. Of course I -- I\ncould go on and on forever to talk about all the -- the -- the -- the unnecessary brutality,\nyou know? Okay, sometimes you explain to yourself that you see a man si -- seeing a pair\nof boots and -- and running out of the line-up and grabbing the pair of boots, well -- the g\n-- Nazi guard ha -- says to himself, \u201cWell, I have to do it, because this 1s a criminal,\nright?\u201d But aside from that, when you saw the brutality and the cruelty of people to other\npeople for no reason, it dehumanized you to the point that you yours -- your own\nassessment of yourself was -- is that other person that you were, is that pers -- is that you\nor is this, that you don\u2019t react the way you really should react to seeing those horrible\nthings? Of course when you are in it yourself, you are forever preoccupied with survival\nbecause that is a very strong instinct, you know. The instinct of survival is so strong, no\nmatter how old you are -- I don\u2019t know how it is when you\u2019re really older, but when\nyou\u2019re a young child and you haven\u2019t lived yet and you -- and -- and then of course in the\nback of my mind, I always said to myself, \u201cGee whiz, I know my mother used to say not\nto say I was smart, I was good in school, but I think maybe I am, you know, maybe I\nreally, you know, I could -- I could beat this.\u201d But then of course I realized that I was\nundernourished and all this and I didn\u2019t have the physical prospects of survival because I\nreally -- I don\u2019t know how long it would have taken for me to -- to -- to just fall by the\nwayside there, because the jobs were -- the job was extremely, extremely hard. And\nagain, to talk in a historical perspective, I s-subsequently found out that there were some\nwomen who ran away from Auschwitz and that the Germans decided -- because you\nknow, the marshes that were around the camp -- the Auschwitz - Birkenau camp, were\nsort of protective. They didn\u2019t show what was going on. But by the same token, they\ncould hide people. So some people made it out. Some people were, as a matter of fact,\ndid run away and they were caught. You know, there were executions in Auschwitz that\neven I remember. But the point was that when we were sent to cut the -- the brush from\nthe marshes, that was -- the reason was that the women who ran away hi-hid in there. So\nthey wanted now cleared. So we had this specific idea in mind, that they really need us --\nnot -- not that we knew why they want to cut it, but if they wanted to cut it, that was a job\nand it was going to take a long time, because there was plenty of it. So, by virtue of being\nneeded, we had a chance to survive. Now the question in my case was, wa -- did I have a\nchance to survive, physically? Even if I outwitted myself and worked hard and ev --\nwould I be able to survive? Well, Auschwitz -- life in -- up to that point -- it was no\nprospect of any kind of getting out of there. We knew by then that they were burning\npeople, because we inquired about the flesh -- the smell of the burning flesh and by then\nwe knew. There were other transports coming in. The Gypsies -- lots of Gypsies were\nsent in. The Hungarian transports. This is all -- you know this is -- we\u2019re talking now\nAugust, September. And we just -- anyhow, we -- we meaning my sisters and I. I\npersonally was thinking about all this time, but I was letting myself go with the -- with\nthe -- with the -- the flow, you know, however I was -- I was trying to accommodate\nmyself and of course my sisters were always protecting me. Because you know, when\nthere was a roll call and I was exhausted, I was always propped up, you know, they\npropped me up. I was the worst case of the three of us, really, because my oldest sister\nHanya, at least she was tall and she was already developed, it was a g -- nice girl, you\nknow, but she -- Kris was good too, but I didn\u2019t fit any picture of any kind of -- although\nthere were kids who came from our camp in Poland, they were younger than I am. There\nwere six and five and six and seven year old children who were in Auschwitz, who came\nfrom Starachowice camp. They were smuggled into the camps, in Starachowice by the\nparents and they were shipped with us and they lived in Auschwitz. Some of them -- a\nfew of them survived Auschwitz. But no I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t in any way figure out how that\nwas going to end. And of course there was -- it was a stroke of luck, we found out that\nthey were looking for -- we didn\u2019t find out, we were called, the numbers were called.\nThere were 30 women -- 30 women were called by num -- you know, to -- to go to\nanother place, you know? The most intelligent way of putting it -- an-another place. You\nknow, cause there was one place and there was the other, it was just one more place.\nWell, the other place happened to be a area called Brejinka, it was called Afectencomer.\nAnd there were Polish women who worked there -- only Christian Polish women. And\napparently they were either involved with the Polish underground, or suspected of\ninvolvement with the Polish underground. Whichever way, they were shipped out. And\nthey needed other people, too. So the number that came out to supplement them, to -- not\nto supplement, to replace them, was 30 and we were in the 30 and the three of us were in\nit cause we had the number. And this was a godsend because we now had to work\nindoors. You see, we were packing that -- th-that stuff that was hanging there from the\npolitical prisoners. We had to work indoors and do a lot of packing which was -- which\nwas child\u2019s play by comparison to the marshes. October, November, cold water, you\nknow. And at first we used to go back to the camp to sleep, but then that was\ndiscontinued. For whatever reason nobody told us. So they had barracks there and we\nslept. That was another godsend, it wasn\u2019t nine more people. It wasn\u2019t nine any more.\nThere were facilities to wash because we were handling things so I guess -- we didn\u2019t\nhave so mu -- many -- I mean the lice somehow -- however we controlled it. We could\nbathe now. Of course we -- they gave us clothes, because there was so much clothes in --\nin the -- you know, what was left behind. So we helped ourselves to clothes, to be -- to --\nto, you know, to dress to -- to size. Dress to size. We had -- they gave us shoes also, by\nmeasure, we could pick a pair of shoes to measure and we did not mix any more with the\nlarger camp, because they didn\u2019t want us mixed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The actual work was as follows. You know that Auschwitz was an extermination\ncamp and a slave labor camp, at one time, combined. The extermination camp was\nbasically for Jews. The slave labor camp was also for political prisoners. Now, there were\na lot of Polish political prisoners who are in the underground or whoever. The Christians\nthat were suspected of anything were called political prisoners. Some of them were\npolitical but not everybody was political, but they weren\u2019t Jews, you see? So they had to\nbe called something, they were called political prisoners. When they were sent into the ca\n-- into Auschwitz, I understand their clothes was put in a bag. Like when we came in, we\njust dumped our clothes on the -- on the heap and we were given whatever. We never saw\nour clothes again. These people had -- you know the German ob-obsession with -- with --\nwith keeping records? Well, they -- their clothes was put into bags, sort of like sacks.\nEach one had a number and it hung, it was -- you know, like in a butcher shop, with the\nhooks? And it hu -- these sacks hang on sh -- on -- on hooks. Every time a prisoner like\nthis died, the bag of -- with the number had to be crossed out and the bag was repacked\ninto a package and sent to the haw -- to -- sent home. Or, if he was resettled, the bag went\nafter him. Of all the stuff and h -- genocide on an -- on a scale -- unprecedented scale,\nhere you talk about shipping the little sack of leftover clothes. I mean this is -- this is a\nmacabre picture to draw, but that\u2019s what it was. So this is what we did. We had to repack.\nI learned to pack there, very well. We had to repack these things. We had to re-hang them\nagain by numbers, you know. And heaven help you if there was ever anything missing. I\nmean, for that you could pay with your head. If you decided, while you were packing,\nthat you were going to take a glove, or something that you thought you want to take for\nyourself -- well we were smarter by then, than that. Besides, the Polish women that were\nstill left there, not all of them were shipped because obviously you cannot staff a -- a -- a\n-- a workplace with brand new people. You have to keep some of the old ones. They told\nus they were -- they were very intelligent women there, very. I -- some of them were\npolitical prisoners. So they told us the do\u2019s and the don\u2019ts and we surely minded\neverything they ever said. Life there really brought us around. Living there brought us\naround physically. I don\u2019t know if we slept two to a bunk or three, but 1t wasn\u2019t nine and\nwe didn\u2019t wear the same raggedy, t-torn rags that weren\u2019t even fitting. Here, if you -- it\u2019s\nsometimes found that you -- your -- your -- you tore your dress, you went over to the\nsupervisor and she would say, you come with me, I -- you pick a dress. You see? So that\nthat was also very important for later on, the fact that we were dressed properly and we\nhad proper shoes when we went on the march later on, the -- the -- the death march. But\nthat -- I\u2019m anticipating. It -- what I was trying to say 1s this -- we worked in that place,\nwhich was part of the Auschwitz complex, maybe for two months or something like this.\nBecause you see, the general evacuation from Auschwitz was Jan -- about mid January,\n1945. January 15th or so. And I would say that we worked there through Feb -- through\nDecember, surely. Some of November, maybe. Some of November, all of December and\nup to that point. At which -- which gave us a very good -- our bodies a very good chance\nto recover from the cold and the -- we were counted here, too and everything, but it\nwasn\u2019t any more like it was. And by the way, we were now separated from our\nhometown group. This was a totally different -- they -- these were people -- different\npeople and there the -- the Christian Polish women. Of course, we had a very good\nrelationship because -- maybe it\u2019s not nice to say, th -- in the way of bragging. Our Polish\nwas really very pure and very, very lovely. So, people could sort of -- could peg you.\nThey could figure out who you were by the way your Polish sounded, you know?",
        "A: Right. No, in the barracks?\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: So now we\u2019re up to the general evacuation of Auschwitz. The time 1s mid-January,\n1945. Historically, to put it in perspective, the Russian army is -- offensive is moving\never closer. In fact, the part of Poland where Starachowice was -- Starachowice camp was\nlocated, was already liberated in January 1945, when we first started. But they were\nalready liberated the year -- you know, at the end of last year, so after Starachowice,\nwhen we were still going through living hell and worse, that part was liberated. Meaning,\nyou know, the Russians were there. So we found ourselves in that march -- that was the\nso-called death march. I don\u2019t know that I need to -- to dwell on it, because it has been\nvery well documented all around and that was a horrendous experience. The camp was\nbeing evacuated en masse and people were being driven to a railroad station and people\nwere just -- 1t was winter, it was snowy, snowy winter. And people were just falling by\nthe wayside because we had to walk da-day and night and people were shot and killed\nright along and groups were now totally -- you know, things were just getting mixed up\nbecause men and women, you know -- th -- th -- it was -- it -- people from different parts\nof the camp -- anyhow, the -- the most outstanding recollection for me of that period, is\nnot what I remember, but what my sisters remember, is that I fell asleep on that march\nand I could not distinguish reality fr -- I was hallucinating and they were dragging me.\nAnd really, if I ever was going to perish, that was the time. They dragged me, they\nphysically dragged me. I was totally, completely swallowed up by the dream. I just didn\u2019t\nknow -- I just thought I was in some house and then we were told to stop on the road and\neverybody was relieving himself and my sisters told me to squat down an-and I wouldn\u2019t\ndo it, cause I thought I was dreaming and I wasn\u2019t going to do that. Well, anyhow, that\nwas another -- it was a horrendous experience, except I slept through it. And what I know\nabout that is what my sisters told me and the fact that I was finally awakened with a big\nh-hit on the head when -- when we were to move on after a night\u2019s sleep in a barn, that I\nreal-realized who I was and where I was. And we ended up on open cars -- on open\nrailroad cars. Not covered, open cars. Snow -- snow was falling and we were going\nsomewhere. Now we were sitting on the floor of these cars, all kinds of people, wi --\nspeaking all kinds of languages. Women, again, we were not mixed with men. You could\nhear Greek and Y-Yiddish and Polish and Russian and French and Hungarian. You name\nit, it was all one big -- we were really by ourselves on that march, the three of us. I don\u2019t\nknow how -- this is -- we\u2019ll all -- another subject. How it was, that knock wood, that we\nwere -- like that -- we were s -- always together.",
        "A: Th-Th -- I -- I think we marched maybe four or five days. The march. Then we came\nto those trains and I still don\u2019t know where it was. Th -- There were -- there were -- these\ntrains were waiting, 1t wasn\u2019t a station, it was some kind of a siding or whatever, you\nknow. This is all -- I was going to do research into it, but w-what will it give me if I fi --\ndo -- do know this? I don\u2019t need to know it and -- anyhow, we came from there\neventually. We came at night to a place, the sign was lit uf -- lit up -- Ravensbruck. Just\nlike in Auschwitz, we didn\u2019t know what it was, what -- it was another place, you know?\nSo they unloaded us and we had to stay where we were on the snow, because there was\nno place -- th -- just -- you know, they just said, \u201cYou just stay here.\u201d",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I tell you what it was, it was -- we had with us a little sack of sugar, which was a\nluxury above luxuries, when we were leaving, the afectencomer last place. The snow was\nvery -- falling very heavily. We were covered with snow. We ate a drop of sugar and we\nate a drop of snow. You see? Mixed with -- everybody was eating snow. They scraped\ntheir coats or whatever they were wearing and how long -- you see, that\u2019s another thing, I\ndon\u2019t remember how long the march was. I don\u2019t remember how long we traveled to -- to\n-- to Ravensbriick. All I know is that when we came to Ravensbrtck, it was worse than\nanything else before. Now, if that is at all possible to say that, then -- that -- to say that\nyou came out of Auschwitz to something even worse, that\u2019s probably like a total\nexaggeration, which it isn\u2019t. The reason being that Ravensbriick was now a gathering\npoint for all the camps that were being evacuated. Now, in Auschwitz, they counted you,\nthey gave you a number, you were nine to a -- a boar -- to a -- the bunk. If one was\nmissing, the rest got th-th-th -- shot or killed, for whatever. You had to be accounted for\nand you had to do or not do exactly what you were told. And you got that -- that -- that\nslop of the soup that was nothing, but you got it. In Ravensbriick was nothing. It was\noverflowing with people. There was no room even for nine on a bunk. They built tents.\nThey kept us there because there was no room. They finally threw us into a tent. They\ntold us to get up off the snow and everybod -- the snow was all stained with urine,\nbecause we sat there, you know and everything and feces -- into that tent. There was no\nroom 1n the tents, there was like herring people next to each other. You know, like laid\nout like sardines. It was -- 1t was an incredible s-situation because you didn\u2019t have food.\nYou didn\u2019t know if you were going to get even that meager nothing, that -- that slop,\nwhatever it was. A piece of bread. You didn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t sleep, you couldn\u2019t\nundress. You -- you -- that was the end of the road. It was just bodies shoved into a tent,\nperiod. There was no organization. There was no counting, there was -- you know what I\nmean? Whereas they were obsessing about having the last -- the -- the number exactly to\nthe last digit, here they couldn\u2019t care less. So finally the word got around that the trucks\nwould be coming, that there would be shipments going out. That they were going to\nliquid -- not liquidate, they were going to reduce the number of people in Ravensbrick.\nSo my sisters decided that anything is better than this and frankly, you know, I -- I didn\u2019t\nparticipate much in the decisions, because really I didn\u2019t consider myself very much\naware of -- of -- of -- of -- that -- to plan it, to think it through. I -- I had a certain instinct\nof -- of self-preservation, but I didn\u2019t really know -- I didn\u2019t have the life experience to --\nto -- to -- to -- to do any planning type of -- you see? Of -- 0 -- any planning of any kind.\nAnyhow, they said, \u201cWherever we go is better than here.\u201d They said they were -- they\nneed people for some other place. And this could -- other place could have been another\nchimney, you know. That was to be taken into consideration. But my sisters said, \u201cAny\nplace is better than this place, because this place is -- is -- what\u2019s going to be here?\u201d So\nwe got on those trucks, the first trucks that came.",
        "A: Maybe three weeks at the most. Two weeks, maybe. Two or three at the most.",
        "A: In the tent -- in the tent -- and no, there was food here and there. You know, they\nwould come around and they would dole out some soup, but it wasn\u2019t like in Auschwitz.\nYou went to the marshes, you came back, they bri -- brought you the food there or they --\nthey -- you -- they give you the one piece of bread in the morning for the day. You knew\nyou -- it was coming. You didn\u2019t know what was coming here, what wasn\u2019t coming. You\ncouldn\u2019t figure it out. And -- and then when you did come with the food, who was going\nto get there before you, t-to -- over your head, you see? Because this wasn\u2019t anything in\nany way organized to -- for any number of people. Certainly not for this number. This --\nthis was thousands upon thousands more than the camp could ever absorb. So when we\nfinally got on those trucks -- and surely we didn\u2019t know where we were going and surely\nwe could have been going to another -- t-to be burned like they were burning the flesh in\nAuschwitz. So, by now we were smarter, we were already -- we knew a lot of things now,\nyou see, because we knew about what Auschwitz was doing before we got there and all\nthat. So we came and the place we came to was Radsoff. A small camp, I think it\u2019s in\nMecklenburg, right?",
        "A: Yes, right, exactly. And we came there and this was an empty camp. Small size,\nnothing like Auschwitz, nothing like Ravensbrick. It was just a small -- sort of the size of\na Starachowice labor camp type. Apparently that camp was near an Air Force base. There\nwere aircraft around, you know, in the -- not far and there was a base and the camp had\nbarracks and it had SS women running it. In uniform. And talk about women being\nbestial. Well, as you na -- can see, the world was opening to me all the time. All the\nassumptions I once had about how women were a little kinder than men, forget that. How\nthey collaborate as they enslaved could not be as -- as horrible -- as brutal as the\noriginators of the -- of the -- the planners and the originate -- forget about that. You see?\nSo, coming back to Radsoff -- when we arrived, I think there were only two or three\ntrucks of us. And what they wanted -- they staffed, they used us f -- to staff -- as -- as\nstaff for this camp. I ended up being a maid to one of the SS women. My sister Hanya got\na job cleaning her office. I was personal maid. Sister Hanya got a job in the office,\ncleaning the office and I forget what job my sister Krisha had. But she reminded me and I\ntotally forgot about that. She had a bad job and one day this SS woman, she took a liking\nto me, even though she wouldn\u2019t come within 10 feet of me, you know. Dirty Jew, I --\nyou -- you know, and -- so, she asks me if everything is all right and I said fine. I\u2019m -- I\nme -- I was scared of -- to death of her. I used to bring wood in and to her fire, you know,\nto heat the -- wash her laundry and iron and you know, all personal things. So, she asked\nme if everything was all right and if I have enough to eat, I said, \u201cYes, all right.\u201d So she\nsays, She left me bread -- crust -- she used to cut away the crust from the bread, but she\nwould never give it to me, because she wouldn\u2019t touch me, but she left it on the table. So\nshe says, \u201cFrom now on, whenever you come, there\u2019Il be crust here, so that\u2019s yours.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d And then said, \u201cAnd -- and -- wh-what else? Do you have anybody here?\u201d I say,\n\u201cYes, I have sisters, one who works in the office, the other one has a bad job,\u201d I said. So\nshe said, \u201cAll right, I get her a good job.\u201d And Krisha got a job in the kitchen. I didn\u2019t\neven remember that, but she reminded me about that. And so the first transport that came\nout of Ravensbrick, into Radsoff and we are now talking about end of -- end of February\nor something like that, 1945, something like that. We came into Radsoff and we were\nfirst distributed as the maids and the kitchen help and all this. And then the pe -- other\npeople were sent in -- prisoners. And they had to dig ad -- anti-aircraft, because -- no --\ntrenches and -- and work at the air base. And the fact is that we didn\u2019t really know what\nwas going on, but we sort of had a feeling that things are not -- as far as the war 1s going\non, that things are not the same, things are quite different now. And life there, for us\npersonally, was not as harsh as anywhere else. First of all, because we were in direct\ncontact with the SS women -- in other words, they had to -- to -- to have us in their house\nto clean, we had to be clean -- not to mix with the general population. So underneath the\nbarracks was like -- like a cellar-like thing -- or under the offices, I don\u2019t know, it -- they\nlet us sleep in that basement type of thing. Also on bunks, but we were not mingling with\nthe population, you see? But we -- it so happens we had some friends there from other\nplaces. So -- so we had, again, indoor jobs. I -- I don\u2019t know if that -- how impressive that\ncould be, but if you think about the time of the year and what we went through and --\nanyhow, we had these indoor jobs and -- and they looked, the SS women, cruel as they\nwere -- and they were really horrible types -- it was for their own benefit to stay with the\npeople that they picked, you know. And 1-1f you turn out that you -- they liked you,\nwhich -- she liked me, what do you mean liked, how could she have liked me when I was\na nothing Jew? But I did -- I washed her laundry and I ironed her laundry and I washed\nthe -- cleaned the floor and I did the dishes and I brought in the wood and I -- I had the\nstove on for her and I -- you know, I did all the things that -- that -- polished her shoes\nand I did the best I could. So one way or another she couldn\u2019t hate me, because you\nknow, I was doing. I was doing things for her. We were in that camp -- I\u2019m trying to\nreconstruct, you know, I -- di-di-di-direct -- d-dates like this are hard to come by, but this\nhas to be mid -- mid-April or so. Mid- April, 1945. And all of a sudden, we hear\nbombing. The allies were bombing, you see? So that was very good news, for us. We\nheard the bombs falling and they were scared to death and we didn\u2019t care any more,\nbecause just to see them scared -- and they were running down where we were. They\nwere also running down into that cellar where we were sleeping, you know? They were\npetrified. But to us, it was just one more. Besides it -- we knew it was English. The\nEnglish or the Americans, we didn\u2019t know, but we knew somebody was bombing and\nthat\u2019s good. Because one way or another, this has to get resolved now. So after some very\nheavy bombardment a few times, by the allies -- obviously they must have been bombing\nthe airf -- air base, you see? Because we were in the middle of nowhere, but there was an\nair base. So after some of these bombings were over -- and again, I can\u2019t tell you exactly,\nbut it had to be about middle of April -- or early April, I don\u2019t know, 1945, they told us\nwe have to evacuate the camp and they were going, too. But of course, they weren\u2019t\ngoing to ki -- schlepp -- carry their own things. So each one of the maids had to carry a\nrucksack. A -- a backpack with her things and we were march -- we were formed in a\nformation and I think either the -- the -- the servants, meaning myself and the others,\neither were on the end or at the front, but we weren\u2019t mixed in, we were in a place all in\none group, because we were carrying that -- that -- the belongings, you know? And then -\n- I\u2019m sorry to say, I\u2019m totally ignorant of the area, but I know that we found ourselves -- I\nknow it\u2019s in Mecklenburg, but we found ourselves on the highway -- major highway and\nI don\u2019t know which it was, east -- west highway or north-south highway or whichever\nhighway it was -- it was a major highway because it was completely covered with people.\nYou had soldiers in uniform and soldiers out of uniforms and tanks and horses and -- and\ncows and people and Jews from camps and Christian Poles from the neighboring farms,\nyou know, the Christian Poles worked slave labor on farms. And POW\u2019s and all\nlanguages and -- and uniforms and not uniform. And you know, we walked in formation,\nwe had -- our clothes was marked with a big X -- with a -- like a -- you know, shiny kind\nof painting -- paint that was on both s -- you know, to mark us. So you could tell who we\nwere, but we were carrying these rucksacks -- these knapsacks for them and we were in a\ngroup. There were 12 of us. And before long, there was no place to go. On the side there,\nthere was a -- there a -- the Swedish -- Swedish Red Cross was giving out -- was giving\nout parcels. Not parcels, food rations. I don\u2019t know -- o-out of nowhere, it\u2019s like, you\nknow, 1-1-it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s a total like -- it -- it -- like in a dream, you know, in a dream\nthings do not connect. One -- you dream that you are in school, but the school happens to\nbe in the middle of the ocean or something like that, you know, it doesn\u2019t connect. In this\nmelee of people, of -- of soldiers, of civilians, of -- of airplanes flying over, you don\u2019t\nknow which way you\u2019re going, north or south or whichever. You don\u2019t know -- and then\nyou just see rations given to you because they see that you\u2019re a prisoner, you see? Of\ncourse these German women, they grabbed all the cigarettes and everything and they\nstuck it in the knapsacks. Finally, we had to stop, because there was no place to go.\nNobody was moving, nothing was moving. There was -- it was total traffic jam, period.\nNo place to go. And there were embankments on both sides of the road and there were --\nfurther out was like a forest and on this side -- on the other side was also an embankment\nand a field. We were all sitting together, the -- the -- the servant girls, us with the\nknapsacks and one of the girls, her name was Hel-Helena, she was blonde, looked\nGerman, spoke German beautifully. She had an idea that we could now make our way\nout of here and nobody will know the difference, because it was the commotion. Not\ncommotion, th-the mixture of everything was -- you couldn\u2019t tell who was who and who\nwas going where and what was happening. So she says, why don\u2019t we sit down. The SS\nwomen were all together, they were hanging around where the rations were given out,\nbecause they could, you know, they could get their hands on things. So we\u2019re sitting on\nthe embankment and Helena says like this, \u201cYou know, I can get dressed,\u201d meaning her -\n- she can get dressed in one of the things that are in the knapsacks and we will move on\nthe side and we will sit there and if later on, after everybody moves and they find us, she\nwill say she\u2019s minding us. Which we did -- she took out a cape, a black cape out of one of\nthe knapsacks and put the head, th-th-the -- the hat on, the German hat and we moved\ndown the embankment, into the field and we walked very quietly. There was haysa --\nstacks, in the field and we hid behind the haystacks and before you knew it, everybody\nstarted moving and -- and we got left behind. Nobody even knew we got left behind,\nbecause who could even know? Who could even count? These German women, maybe\nthey themselves wanted to get away from us. If you think about it, you know?",
        "A: 12, there were 12 of us. Th-The -- ma -- two sisters, myself and the others. This is all\nfrom -- from the Radsoff group that we came with. And I am thinking that they could not\nhave been all that stupid to see that we weren\u2019t together with them, but they maybe didn\u2019t\nwant to be together with us. However, it really worked to our advantage very well,\nbecause we found ourselves behind the h-haystacks and then a Pole came -- a man came\nover and he spoke Polish very well and he ask who we were and we said we detached\nourselves, we were prisoners. We were Jewish slave laborers and such and prisoners.\nAnd he says, \u201cWell, if you want to, there\u2019s a villa not far from here, you go there, there\u2019s\na woman and you tell her to feed you.\u201d And he said there were Polish workers around,\nstill on the fields, you see. So we went over, there was really a nice villa and there was\nthis woman and she fed us, was really just like he said. And we said, \u201cOh.\u201d We still\ndidn\u2019t -- we -- then we started hearing from them that the war is ending. But this is the\nend of April now. And we really didn\u2019t know who -- who was doing what and how 1s it\nending and where are the Germans? And we just saw by the way the highway was that\nthings weren\u2019t so hot for them, you see? That they were running away somewhere, I\ndon\u2019t know where. Anyhow, when we came to that villa and -- and we stayed overnight\nand lo and behold, next morning or next day, the Russians -- Russian soldiers arrived.\nThey arrived in -- like a -- a truck or something and they wanted to know who was who\nand we said who we were and we spoke Polish and there was a Russian woman with us\ntoo, because that was already out of Radsoff. And he says, \u201cGreat. He says, \u201cYou know,\nyou are here, wonderful, because we\u2019re going to be here and we\u2019re going to need girls to\nwork for us.\u201d So, he says, \u201cWe\u2019ll be here tomorrow and then you can go with us, we\u2019ll\nreally make it -- and make it good -- I mean you'll have -- you-you\u2019ll have a better life.\u201d\nAfter they left, the Russian women said, \u201cDon\u2019t trust them.\u201d And the women -- Polish\nwomen said they were raped, that the Russians were raping women. So we took off,\nbefore they came back, we took off and we didn\u2019t know -- w -- the only thing -- we didn\u2019t\nknow what to do or where to go. We didn\u2019t know anything. I-Is the war ended? It\u2019s not\nend, it\u2019s still going on, but it was already very late April and they said th-that the war was\nover. But we didn\u2019t know what over means. What does over mean, you know? So --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Yes. That was a German villa, w-which belonged to lan -- German landowners, who\nwere employing slave labor -- Christian slave labor camp from Poland and Ukrainians --\nUkrainian women. They worked the fields while the Germans were in the army. They\nworked the fields. So that -- that\u2019s who it was.",
        "A: Much better. Much better. First of all, you know, the last months and a half or two in\nAuschwitz were already restoring our health. As I told you before we left, we were given\nshoes and we were given clothes to fit, warm clothes. So that was already -- that saved\nour life in the march -- in the death march and riding into Ravensbriick. We got out of\nRavensbruck with -- a short time before we were defeated physically and mentally. In\nRadsoff, we had an indoor job. And Krisha was in the kitchen, we always had food to eat,\nyou know? She was leaving me the bread crust that I was giving out to other women\nbecause I don\u2019t even need it -- this, any more. Because you know, we had -- we still were\nwearing the same clothes that we came out of Auschwitz, that were fitting. This is a very\nimportant point, that you have shoes to wear and it wasn\u2019t wooden shoes like, you know,\nlike in Auschwitz that we wear -- wore wooden shoes. So that if you add it all up,\nRadsoff being -- did I say about two months or so? Something like this. That restored our\nhealth. So by the time we were out of Radsoff, we are still wearing Auschwitz clothes,\nwhich I told you, which were fitting. Our health -- not health, but we were restored. And\nwe had the energy, we didn\u2019t know which way we\u2019re going to be heading, so we were --\ndecide to go back home to Poland, because you have to find out who remain, who -- what\nhappened, even though we pretty much knew, you know? In -- we didn\u2019t know what\nhappened to father, but -- but we more or less -- things were begun to fall in, because we\nstarted asking around, the people, if they knew and then nobody knew and so on. We\ndecided to go back to Poland, not so much weesaw, most of us, of the 12. And we started\nwalking, we got on the train and there were transports, so they would dump us at the next\nstation, then we got on another train and went all the way to Bitgosh like this, on and off\nthe train and by that time, people saw who you were. First of all, you couldn\u2019t -- you\ncould not mistake us for anybody else, because we were marked with the -- with the X\u2019s\non the back and the front, so -- and of course we had numbers, but you didn\u2019t have to go\naround showing your number. Anybody who looked at you close, knew who you were,\nyou see? Didn\u2019t have to introduce yourself. So, they knew -- where you going? \u201cWell,\nwe're trying to go back to Poland.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d So they would say, \u201cAll right, now a new\ntransport is going to load up soldiers here. You stay on this platform, next train comes,\nthey\u2019ll take you.\u201d You see? So this is how it worked out, that eventually we were on the\ntrain, off the train, on the train, off the train. Fi -- It was if we didn\u2019t know where we\u2019re\ngoing, but we\u2019ll thought we\u2019ll go back to Starachowice, you see? And we were -- got on\nthe train and finally, on our last -- we came out of Bitgosh, we were just heading to\nPoland, w-we didn\u2019t know how we were heading. There was a -- a Russian soldiers 1n --\nsoldier in the train, heard us speak Polish and of course he saw who we were. As I told\nyou, we didn\u2019t have to introduce ourselves. So he says, \u201cYou\u2019re one of those camp\npeople?\u201d So we said, \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere you going?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going back to Poland.\u201d \u201cWhere\nin Poland?\u201d We said, \u201cStarachowice.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of town is it?\u201d He spoke Yiddish. \u201cIs it\na big city, is ita town?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a ci -- big city, it\u2019s a town,\u201d you know, the\ntown had 30,000 people, so it isn\u2019t what you call a city. It was a city, but 1t wasn\u2019t a big\ncity. Not like Krakow or Warsaw. He said, \u201cDon\u2019t go back to Starachowice, if that\u2019s\nwhere you came from. It\u2019s not safe for Jews to return to -- to small towns, because people\nare now -- they feel you come back for your property, they are killing people around\nthere. Don\u2019t go. You have to go to a big city.\u201d Warsaw, Krakow or Lodz. He said,\n\u2018\u201cWarsaw\u2019s all bombed out. Lodz has a very good Jewish agency set up. Best thing for\nyou is to go to Lodz.\u201d \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll go to Lodz. Where are we going to go to Lodz? Who\ndo we know?\u201d He says, \u201cI have a sister there,\u201d he says. He gave us the add --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: The soldier whom we met in the train, coming out of Germany, I mean af -- when the\nwar ended, who happened to be a Jew -- a Jew in Russian uniform and who asked us on\nthe train where it was we were planning to go to -- in Poland and we told him that we\u2019re\ngoing home to Starachowice and he asked us what size town it was. Whether it was a big\ncity, which of course it wasn\u2019t, because the population was 30,000 and that\u2019s no big city.\nSo when he found out, he says, \u201cNo, you should not be going back to the small town,\nbecause they will not welcome you. They will think you\u2019re coming to claim your\nproperty or whichever it is and a lot of people returning from camps are being killed now,\nso you are better off going to one of three places. Warsaw, Krakow or Lodz. Warsaw is\nall bombed out -- unless you have somebody there, other than that, Krakow or Lodz.\u201d\nAnd we decided, \u201cFine, so we\u2019ll go to Lodz, but where do we go?\u201d And he says, \u201cWell, I\nhave a sister there,\u201d and he gave us the address. He says, \u201cYou go to her. Ring her\ndoorbell and tell her that I send you and there\u2019s a Jewish agency and you can register and\n-- and from there on, you'll be all right.\u201d\u201d\u00bb Which is exactly how it was and this is my --\nMay, 1945, now. We came and she had a lot of people -- lot of people sleeping on the\nfloor, sleeping on the stairway, all over the place. And next day we went to register. Of\ncourse we knew where to go, because she told us. The agencies, Jewish agencies that\nwere running the place, that were running the registration were HIAS and the Joint\nDistribution Committee. I think both, together or separately, however, but they were\ninternational Jewish organizations. There was also Red Cross in Lodz, that was\nregistering people, where we did register, but we were told that they are basically\ninterested in the Christians. And it\u2019s exactly how it was. So we -- as I said, we were --\nafter we registered, we had to go and check our names. Not just our names, check the\nnames of people who were returning -- whether relatives or neighbors or whoever. And\nbefore long we found out that Uncle Alexander, my father\u2019s brother arrived. Alexander\nLaks and he was from Radom. He had two sons that went to Russia when the war broke\nout and they eventually joined the unders army and went through to Herron and\nPalestine. And that\u2019s another chapter of the Holocaust, but we\u2019ll stick with this part now.\nUncle Alexander and his wife, Rose - Roosia, went through camps. We saw her in\nAuschwitz, as a matter of fact. I mentioned at the beginning when we were carrying the\nrocks one way and she was carrying the rocks the other way. Anyhow, he did not yet\nknow where she was, if she survived, but he was in -- in Lodz. He was a man of means\nbefore the war. He had real estate, a lot of real estate and property and a big business and\nso on. So he decided he would go to Radom and see what he could claim. He -- I think he\nhad some hidden assets too, hidden. The agency, the Jewish agency not only provided\nfood rations, but they also gave us a place to live in, which wasn\u2019t a place, it was more\nlike a -- the post war bombed out discard, but it was a place. And before we knew it, we\nmet Adrian, my s -- Canadian sister\u2019s husband, who was already in Lodz for quite awhile.\nHe was with us in the camps -- not in the camps, he was with us in Starachowice camps,\nup to the point where, on the eve of being shipped to Auschwitz, he broke out with the\nother prisoners, most of whom did not make it. He did make it. He made it out and he\nstayed with the Polish partisans. And of course, that was Au-August, 1944. He fought\nwith the partisans and then when that part of Poland was liberated, and that was way\nbefore we know of liberation, because that was almost like -- like -- like almost a year\nbefore we were liberated. We first went to Auschwitz. He found his mother, who was left\nbehind in Auschwitz, as human refuse, because she was totally on the verge of -- the\ncrematoria didn\u2019t work and they didn\u2019t -- they weren\u2019t going to take the time to kill her,\nfor whatever reason. So they didn\u2019t kill her, but she was left behind and she was liberated\nin January of 1945 by the Russians and somehow or other found her way to Lodz and\nfound -- he found her and they established a household. So when we were in Lodz, when\nwe just arrived in L6dz, we found Uncle Alexander and then we found Adrian and his\nmother. And we had a little -- a place to live in and we -- in fact we had this friend of\nmine from Israel, who also was the one, Hanna Tenser, who was in the gas chamber and\nwas left behind, also. She joined us, she called herself the fourth sister. So she -- she\njoined us and we tried to organize a kind of a life. Uncle Alexander was a man of means,\nso he was able to secure some money. He had a lot of hidden assets, liquid assets, money\nand such, but he also had real estate. And he rented a very lovely apartment -- large\napartment, so now we lived in the apartment, both my sisters, Hanya - Anna and Krisha -\nKris went to work and I signed up for school and I was the one to keep house. And was a\nvery interesting period of my life, because you see, I actually didn\u2019t finish elementary\nschool, you see? But, because I was taught, right through the ghetto tie -- time, which\nwas seven days a week, 10 hours a day, I knew French and I knew Latin and I knew\ngrammar and I knew history and I read Tolstoy and -- and I did all these things, which I\nwould never have done, except the books were in the house and that\u2019s what we studied\nfrom. And my sister Hanya, being the best teacher I ever had, which, it\u2019s a fact. I had this\nfantastic education, which I -- it wasn\u2019t even qualif -- qua -- classified, you know? If you\nask me -- so I went to high school and ask me, \u201cWhat grade?\u201d So there was this high\nschool, so everybody said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re 15 now, 16, you have to go to high school, but,\u201d\n-- so I came and say, \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d And I told them I studied this and I said --\nthey said, \u201cFine.\u201d They put me in the second grade of high school, you see? And I was\nkeeping house. We lived very nicely because of Uncle Alexander. And we can still\nregistering, but we found out there\u2019s nothing for us any more, to hope for.",
        "A: No, this was a Polish high school in Lodz, Polish high school. There were a lot of kids\nin my situation who were -- whose education was interrupted. And they had all kinds of\nprofessors who were floating around, university professors and everybody, who was\nwilling to teach. And we lived -- yes, I picked up as if not -- as if I really belonged there.\nI really, truly fit right in. I really fit right in. And my two sisters worked and we lived\nwith uncle and Kris met Miles, Miles Lehrman, her husband and very soon my older\nsister, Hanya was -- she got engaged to Adrian and she went to Warsaw to study\ndiplomac-diplomacy in the school of diplom -- Polish diplomacy. And she left for\nWarsaw and he left with her, soon after. And I stayed on. Kris got married. I went to high\nschool. We had a very good life in -- in Lodz, in the sense that it was sort of like catching\nyour breath, you know? First of all, we really, finally were able to find out -- to make\nconnection as to what happened, who -- we knew that the family perished, but we still\ndidn\u2019t know who or how or when or what or anything. We found out for sure that mother\nwent to Treblinka. We found out for sure that father perished in October, in 1944, in\nAuschwitz, for sure.",
        "A: Through -- because we met people in Lodz from our hometown, who were together\nwith my father in Auschwitz. They even gave us October as the date, you see, in\nAuschwitz. October, \u201844. And we tried to find out about Babcha Tannenblume and about\nBabcha Laks. And we did not know about my cousin Anja. But we know that Babcha\nLaks family -- her family was gone. We just didn\u2019t hear about Anja and then one day\nAnja showed up in -- in Lodz. And she stayed with us. And that was wonderful. And then\nwe didn\u2019t know about the Tannenblume side of the family, where they were. As I told\nyou, nine children. So, we found out specifically that Babcha Tannenblume and her\ndaughter Regina, with her husband whom she married during the war and the daughter\nAnja most definitely went to Treblinka with the Austroviets Jews, no question about it.\nAnd my aunt from Danzig, who was shipped to Austroviets with her husband. Rachella.\nShe and her husband were together with Babcha, they all went. Now, my aunt from\naround Lublin, the one that had those two -- two sons, engineers, they studied in\nBelgium. Whether or not they came home before th-th-the war, because the Belgian Jews\nwere killed just as badly as the Polish Jews. So the two cousins -- the two engineers,\neither got killed in Belgium or they got killed in Poland. Either way, they didn\u2019t survi-\nsurvive. Their mother and father, Kronenburg, Aunt Fella Kronenburg and her husband.\nThey were very well-to-do, they lived on an estate around Lublin. They -- they perished.\nThe only question was always that pharmacist. My mother\u2019s youngest daught -- sister.\nThe pharmacist who went to Wamsha, who got the job right before the war. And that is a\nmystery to this day. I mean, the others are also a mystery, because how can you really\ntell? But we know that they went with the general auseedlung -- with the general\nshipment of Jews, so we know to place them that way. But my aunt who lived, who had\nthose two sons, whether they perished in Belgium or whatever. They would have found\nus, or we would have found them, but nothing happened after the war. And they never\nregistered anywhere. And the one from Wamsha, that pharmacist, that we never knew\nwhat happened to her, so this is what -- we made the connection, sort of to finalize it, you\nknow. Because you cannot go through life forever being surrounded by mysteries. Now\nthings were coming out in the open, about what really, truly happened. And it was\nincomprehensible. And to look for individuals, that was totally out of the question, but to\nlook for people who were part of a group was easier because genocide was predicated on\nmass murder, you see? So if you were in the Austroviets group, you went to Treblinka. If\nyou were in the Starachowice group, you went to Treblinka. You see, if you were in\nanother group, you went to Majdanek or Beljets. Like Miles Lehrman\u2019s family. They\nperished in Beljets, because he comes from that part of Poland, you see? Near Beljets. So,\nyou could actually bring it to -- not to resolve it, but to bring it around to a finality where\nit puts your soul at ease, that this is what happened, you see? And so the -- the war turned\nout th-that of my mother\u2019s family, the only survivors, except for the brothers that were in\nCanada, were the three of us. Of all the cousins and the aunts and everybody else, the\nthree of us. And of my father\u2019s side, only c-cousin Anja and Uncle Alexander and with\nhis wife and the two sons, of c -- who of course survived, but not inside th -- inside of\nPoland. So, but life in Lodz was very interesting, because we kept running into all kinds\nof people coming back. And we lived -- Uncle Alexander saw to it that we lived a good\nlife and I -- now we lived in a nice apartment and -- and we even had a maid. And I still\ndid the marketing and I still did the cooking and I went to school. And Kris was working\nand Hanya was in Warsaw. And Kris got herself engaged to Miles and then we had a\nwedding in -- in the apartment and with -- I did the catering. We did the whole wedding\nourselves. It was good fun, I -- to this day when I talk about it, people laugh, because oh,\nwe had all that stuff bringing in and shipping in and all kinds of -- with gild -- geese and\nwe had the roast goose and we had the -- all these thing -- was a very, very lovely\nwedding. That was Christmas time. And right after the wedding, Uncle Alexander went\nto Sweden, because his wife -- while we were in Radsoff, after Auschwitz, she didn\u2019t go\nour route. I don\u2019t think she went to Ravensbrick, I don\u2019t know. Anyhow, she winded up\nin a small camp not far from Radsoff. And she was so deathly ill when the war -- war\nended, that the Swedish Red Cross was taking all these terribly sick people up to Sweden.\nAnd she was in the hospital and when she got well, she stayed on as a -- as a nurses m --\nhelp. So, Uncle Alexander went to meet her there and they found out that the sons\nsurvived, went through Palestine. My aunt -- my uncle\u2019s wife had family in Isra -- in\nPalestine. So, when the two sons came via Russia 1n the unders army. And the unders\narmy, you know, was traveling through the Middle East. When they came out of -- this is\nalso a historical framework. When Stalin made the pact with Shikorski -- what year was\nthat? During the war, whatever. And he agreed to let Polish military leave to -- to join the\nallies, the western allies. The -- Jews were not alla -- left out, but some Jews did go out.\nAnd they traveled through Teheran into Palestine and from there to England, you see?\nSo, my two cousins met in Palestine, because in Tel Aviv was my Aunt Rose\u2019s sister.\nAnd they met there, quite by chance. And then they went to England, then they both were\nin British uniform, fighting for the allies, til the end of the war. And Uncle Alexander\nstayed in Sweden and we eventually, in early \u201846, left Poland for Berlin. We meaning\nKrisha and Miles and myself. Because Hanya was already engaged to Adash. And she\u2019s\nlive -- she was waiting to finish her -- her studies. And we went to Berlin and --",
        "A: You see, that I cannot tell you, but Miles was now my guardian, you see? He married\nKrisha and I said, \u201cWell, now you have a wife and you don\u2019t need a fifth wheel into the -\n- to the wagon,\u201d you know? He said, \u201cNo, no, no. That\u2019s not how the way it\u2019s going to\nwork.\u201d In fact when he got engaged to Krisha, he gave me a present, a fountain pen. I\nloved plants, so he gave me a plant and to it was attached a fountain pen. It was -- 1n fact,\nwas my birthday and he was just engaged to Krisha, whatever, so this was my birthday\npresent, a fountain pen with the plant. He said, \u201cNo, that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to work\nit, that until you get married, you\u2019ll stay with us.\u201d I was trying very hard not to be a\nburden, you know, in any way. But they were both very busy. He was working, she was\nworking. Somebody had to run the house. I knew nothing about cooking, but I learned.\nSo when somebody, you know, I\u2019m supposed to be a good cook, so they say, so when\nthey say it in front of Miles, says, \u201cYou know, Renia is a pretty good cook.\u201d He says,\n\u201cSure she\u2019s a good cook, she learned on my stomach.\u201d To this day, he says, \u201cThank me,\ndon\u2019t thank her. She learned on my stomach.\u201d Because I really don\u2019t know any kind of\ncooking, much, you know. So was -- was from the imagination, but I did learn to cook,\nbecause I was trying very hard. I did the marketing, you know and I -- so I truly, I -- I --\nit\u2019s apropof marketing, no but that\u2019s a sideline, [indecipherable] keep it. That\u2019s another\nstory. Well, anyhow, when we went to -- coming back to the question. Miles was very\nmuch in touch with all the eng -- returning refugees, the people from the camps and\nfriends. I think he had some kind of a cousin in Berlin. And somebody said, \u201cIf you go to\nBerlin, there\u2019s a DP camp.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere am I going find a DP camp?\u201d They said --\nhe said he has a cousin. \u201cYou have the address, you go to the cousin and then you --.\u201d So\nwe did go to Berlin. We left Poland and that was a surreptitious kind of an operation,\ncause you\u2019re not allowed. Was called th-the green border. Because you know, the old\nernissa border was not yet established in 1945. No, this early \u201846. It was sort of fluid,\nbecause it wasn\u2019t Germany, but yet 1t was Germany, and whatever. We went from -- we\nwent to Stettin and from Stettin to Berlin. And in Berlin, we found his cousin and before\nlong, we moved into the DP camp. And of course from my viewpoint, this was just the\nhappiest of all happenings, because here in Berlin, the DP camp was run by -- basically\nby the Jewish agencies again. However, I think it had a big -- well, Palestine was\ninvolved a lot in this whole set-up, because we had Palestinian -- you had Jews from\nPalestine, from -- which is Israel in British uniform and I think they were trying to find\nout how reset -- how people were going to be resettled. Anyhow, the school was formed\nvery shortly before I got there. I got there in March or so of 1946. There was a school\nform -- how do you form a school when you have all ages and all backgrounds and\neducational backgrounds. You know, there were kids 13 years old who already had a\nhigh s -- college diplo -- college equivalent and there were kids 13 years old who didn\u2019t\neven finish second grade, you know? This type. I will have to show you the picture,\nbecause I still have a group picture from that school. They went -- whoever they were,\nwhether it was the Jewish agencies or the Palestinian who -- pal -- they -- they -- Jews\nfrom Palestine, they -- they -- whoever it was, the camp was absolutely set up to rescue\nthe children from their experiences, you see? It was about education, no question about it,\nbut it was also about restoring childhood, you see? That was the crux of the program. We\nhad our own mess hall, for bre -- for lunch. We had break from school. Now, let me\nbacktrack. This was a school in the Hebrew language. Everything was taught in Hebrew.\nI had my little bit of a Jew -- Hebrew background from my Tarbud school as a child, but\ncertainly not prepared to study Hebrew in -- in -- chemistry in Hebrew, you know,\nbecause this -- this is like -- I had a -- a -- a distance of a million miles. But one way or\nanother, we all fitted in. They had the little kids together, little kids and I was assigned to\nwhat they called the high school group. That was the oldest group. And of course the\nlittle kids had special treats, but we were totally s -- treated like -- like teenagers with a\nlife, whatever that means. We had a separate mess hall. Our food was much better. You\nknow, there were mess halls for the community. Our food was much better. We were\ngiven special rations of chocolate. We were having a very, very tender, considerate\nsupervision of life. We had dances, we went to dances. I have pictures to this day from\ndances. We had excursions into Berlin proper. Went to the opera. We had likebaumer, we\nhad picnics. Out of the camp, we had performances, we performed and we went to\nperformances. Mayor LaGuardia -- mayor of New York, LaGuardia was the unrah. This\nwas an unrah camp also, you know. Mayor LaGuardia came to visit and we were sa --\nreciting poetry for him, you know, the -- all the group. And I foun-formed many\nfriendships, some of them lasting to this day, from that period.",
        "A: Schlackenza.",
        "A: Well, I have the album. When I started, the group was maybe 40, 50 people, when I --\nand by the time I left, it was more like 300. \u2019Il show you. I have two pictures and this is\nonly within one year, don\u2019t forget. And after I left, there were more friends of mine that\nwere left behind, and the school really grew. And we had all kinds of -- we had th-the\nsoccer games being played, that we were watching or playing, you know, whatever.\nEvery effort was made to bring us around. The other -- the grown-ups didn\u2019t do much,\nbut there were dances, we all went to dances. And I used to do a lot of things privately\nwith Kris and Miles Lehrman. We used to go down to the opera, we used to do other\nthings. Went to see -- to the theater.",
        "A: Well, you see, I was in Germany, but I wasn\u2019t in Germany. I was in camp. I didn\u2019t\nknow anything about Germany. You see, I -- to me the German language in Poland was\nthe same as the German language in Radsoff or Ravensbriick or Auschwitz. Except\nStarachowice was in Polish territory and Radsoff was on German territory. I didn\u2019t have\nany -- either access or -- or connection to the outside, except to the guards, to the SS and\nto the Gestapo. And then to the women. Most of the time -- most of the time my\nconnection was all to the sold -- male. But Radsoff I had th-the women. But that was\nreally dealing more with the language, you see. They represented Germany, but I -- I was\nin Germany, but I didn\u2019t know I was in Germany, I could have been on the moon. In a\ncamp on -- you know, a camp -- a concentration camp on the moon. So that when I came\nto the DP camp in Germany, I was again, sort of, in but not in. I was physically in the\ncamp, but there was no connection to Berlin, except we -- I have all kinds of pictures I'll\nshow you, from Berlin. Berlin was bombed out, we used to go out to Couferstindam. I\nhave the church, the old church in Couferstindam that was demolished, I have it in the\nback of my head there, when I have a picture taken, but th-that Germany was nothing in\nthe context of what we\u2019re talking about, cause this was post-war Germany and there were\npeople from all over, because -- don\u2019t forget 1946, you still have droves of people\npassing through. The -- the -- the movement of people west and east, because everybody\nwas dislocated. So the Berlin that you talk about isn\u2019t really Berlin, a German Berlin. It --\nit was German, but it wasn\u2019t German, but as far as the camps are concerned and as far as\nthe DP camp is concern, I wasn\u2019t in Germany. I was, but I wasn\u2019t, really. You see? And\nthen we left th -- January, we left the DP camp. And I have to show you my report card,\nall excellents. Top to bottom. You know, I reread it in preparation, I wanted to show it to\nyou. I s -- I see the subjects, literature and chemistry and one 1s geography of Palestine --\nis the entry, one entry. I have excellents top to bottom and I was given that gift, here,\nwith an inscription. This says, \u201cSpeak Hebrew.\u201d And this is a silver pin I was given and it\nsays -- inscribed with the date on the back and says, \u201cAs a souvenir from class\nkeetadialit.\u201d\u201d And signed Berlin and the date and I keep it to this day. It\u2019s a precious gift. I\nwas given this and th-the certificate, the report card and we left for Bremenhafen.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: DP camp?",
        "A: No, not at all. Because you see, I have already lived a kind of a normal life in Poland.\nAs soon as we got settled and -- and uncle was around and then Miles Lehrman came on\nthe scene, we had a life of -- of seeing people, meeting people, going out, going -- you\nknow, doing things th-that I -- I found myself to be a grown up, though I knew that there\nwas a big gap left yet, to be filled. But it didn\u2019t bother me, because you see, when you\nlive with so many people, though the circumstances of the camps, the -- the -- the\nshifting, the going and th-the mixing up with nationalities -- it makes you, or it made me\nvery free with everybody, you see? I wasn\u2019t shy and I wasn\u2019t reserved and I wasn\u2019t\nsuspicious and I wasn\u2019t cynical. I haven\u2019t lived yet, I wanted to live, you know? Anybody\nwas wonderful, everybody was wonderful. Everybody I met was great. And -- and no\nmatter whether it was a lady or a man or a boy or a girl and that attitude, when I came to\nBerlin, of course th -- in Poland already, I went to high school, but you know there, I --\nprobably in that high school, I was more set on the academic achievement because I\nreally needed to place myself academically, you see? To -- to -- to -- to categorize myself,\nto see how do I fit in academically? But once I came to Berlin and everything was so\nmixed up and I didn\u2019t have to prove myself academically and ev -- and they were going\nout of their way to -- to -- to make us feel that we\u2019re children still, you see? That really\ndid it. That really did it, because I was sort of pretending I was grown up when I was in\nPoland and I was accommodating myself and I was adjusting, but here I was just a child\nand it was perfectly fine and I got chocolate for it. So, you see, that really was the so-\ncalled smoothing over. And when we came to America, now then my child -- not my\nchildhood, but my young life really started. And as I told you, we -- Kris and Miles\ndecided they were going to be my guardians until I get married. So, obviously, when they\nhad their papers made, Miles had an old aunt living in New York, who left Poland at the\nturn of the century, you know? And she was a very old lady and she lived in -- on the\nlower east side. So Miles secured papers for us to come to America. They were going to\nbe our sponsors, meaning this old aunt with the husband. And Krisha and Miles and I\nwent via Bremenhafen on the marine perch, which was a converted transpor -- trans --\ntroop transport that they used for refugees living -- leaving Europe. We live -- arrived in\nAmerica February 11th, 1947 and they picked us up on the -- on the -- at the boat and\nthey took us to their home and they were living on the lower east side and I -- I nev -- ina\nwalk-up, it was really amazing, you know, cause this was still the old Jewish section. The\nold immigrants. And they were totally amazed that we were sort of dressed well and we\nhad cameras and we spoke languages. And they left Poland, they ask [indecipherable]\nyou know, they left Poland at the turn of the century. The old lady showed me how to put\non the electricity. And there was a little toilet with ush -- with the -- no -- chain. So she\ntook me 1n the toilet to show me how to flush the toilet. And, of course I was very\nappreciative, I didn\u2019t really want to show her that really Poland -- the Poland I left 1s not\nthe Poland she left, you know. And anyhow, we stayed on the lower east side, maybe day\nor two and then we moved to Brooklyn. And again, we did what we did in -- in Lodz.\nKris and Miles went -- they -- they got jobs and I went to school. And I did the cooking\nand the shopping, we lived together. And again I was learning on Miles\u2019s stomach. And I\nwent to Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn. Lived in Crown Heights,\nSchenectady Avenue. I think the number was 241, if I remember. Well, whatever. It was\na walk-up and on the second floor. We lived in Brooklyn and again, by a very, very lucky\nchance, I found myself in Jefferson High School, even though in those days, you had to\ngo to a high school that was in your district and this was a little bit out of my district. But\napparently there was a group of refugee children, that was being organized into a special\nprogram. And the Jewish agency in New York, the Joint Distribution Committee, for\nwhich we were also, we were -- we registered with them. In fact, Kris and Miles found an\napartment by going to the Joint Distribution and they gave them an address. They had\norganized that group, the Joint Distribution Committee, or whoever. I -- the Joint\nDistribution didn\u2019t organize the group, they send me to Jefferson High School, to --\ntelling me that there is a group there and indeed there was. The principal of the high\nschool was Ludwig Karpen. His wife was president of international ORT, O-R-T. He -- I\ndon\u2019t know how the project was set up or whatever. By the time I came, there were a\ntotal of us, about 35 kids, war survivors, fr -- fr -- of every background, academically and\notherwise, from Hungary, from France, from Poland, from Germany. You name it, they\nwere there. And we were going to be tested and incorporated into different grades, but we\nhad what they set up to call basic English class. Basic English class was basically a\norientation class. The head of the department, who ba -- who I\u2019m -- was very fond of, she\nbecame my best friend, til she died a couple of years ago, Agnes Hay. She was head of\nthe English department and she was the head of this project. We met every day, one\nperiod in that special class, for orientation toward Americanization, toward life, towards\nha -- customs, see what customs, how do you greet people and how do you don\u2019t greet\npeople and how you shake hands or you don\u2019t shake hands and -- and you know, and we\nwere placed, for example, I was placed in two English grades. For example, they gave me\nthe test in history, they saw that I knew history up to the first war, like I know my name.\nNapoleon and all, I knew it, this was all stuff. I go-got credit for it. I don\u2019t know -- know\nAmerican history, so I had to study that. I had to study speech, definitely. I had to take\neconomics and this, you know, th-th-the s -- level was very much higher than in the high\nschool. And I met all these wonderful kids who were from all over and who were like I\nwas -- eager to do well in school, eager to -- to excel, to be ac -- they were accepted into\nthe academic background, most of us had an idea of going on to college and of course Dr.\nKarpen saw to it that we were propibliat -- properly assigned to classes, so that when we\nfinally graduated, we absolutely had the -- all the requirements covered, you see?",
        "A: Yes it was, right. And when we did graduate, eventually -- in fact I got a scholarship\nfrom the educa-educational foundation for Jewish girls, because I was heading for\ncollege. I graduated with honors as a matter of fact, from Thomas Jefferson High School,\nas many others did as well. We were excellent students. The reason is that we really knew\nit all -- we didn\u2019t know it in English that well. You see, my English was sort of shaky, but\nwhen we first came to America, we started going to night school, Kris and Miles and I\nwent to night school. I went to Jefferson in the day school -- in the day time and we came\nin February, I went to high school. About March I went to summer camp, you see? By\nrecommendation, again. To summer camp in the summer, by the time I came back from\nsummer camp, my English was good enough to be in high school. So that I had no -- you\nknow, my la-language was not a problem any more. And we were mixed in with the high\nschool population and that was a very fine, very academically high, very good school and\na lot of kids went to college from that high school. Now, it\u2019s really very bad, this high\nschool is very bad, I\u2019m telling you. There are a few very bad high schools in New York,\nthis 1s it. When I -- Jefferson -- when I tell a few people that I graduated from Thomas\nJefferson High School, they faint. They faint. \u201cYou went to Jefferson?\u201d Well, when I\nwent to Jefferson, Jefferson was not what it is today. It was a very fine academic high\nschool. Danny Kaye went there, way before I did. Shelly Winters. To this day she\u2019s very\n-- this was -- the Gershwin lived around the -- the perimeter of Jefferson High School,\nthis was east New York, which is near Brownsville, in Brooklyn. And that was a -- a blue\ncollar Jewish neighborhood when I came in and the school had very high academic level\nbecause all these kids were what you call eager beavers, you know. To get out of the -- of\nthe working class, you know, Alfred Kazan and all the writers and all kinds of important\npeople came out. They went through this -- living in that area and they broke out to\ngreater things. Now, when I came to Jefferson, that was more or less the tempo of it, you\nknow, you carried on.",
        "A: No, no. As a matter of fact, 1f I showed you some of these ar -- newspaper clippings,\nthe head of the Hebrew dep-department was Dr. Horowitz, Edward Horowitz. He was, as\na matter of fact, you know the Jewish matzah people, the Horowitz matzah people? He\nwas one of those Horowitz\u2019s, very well-to-do family. He had a PhD in Hebrew or\nwhatever. He was the head of the Hebrew department and I took Hebrew as a foreign\nlanguage, because I came out of a Hebrew school and his class was the very good class\nfor me to get oriented to other things than Hebrew lessons. To the way the school runs,\nthe requirements, all these things I could get from hi -- from -- in that class in Hebrew,\nyou see? And he took a great liking to all the -- he had a few of these kids. He took a\ngreat liking to me. I was in his school and when they found out that I had a birthday\ncoming, my 18th birthday, they gave me -- he gave me a party in his house. He invited\nthat Hebrew class. And somehow or other, he got these newspaper people to come and\ninterview me in -- in Jefferson. And one of them -- he told them that I have a number and\nthe other -- one of the -- from the New York Post, I think, he told me to show me the\nnumber -- to show him the number and for me to sit there while he took the picture,\nwhich I have to this day, pointing at my number. I found it very stupid. What was this\nthing -- what was so important about the number? You know, I -- I don\u2019t -- ah, he wants\nto know, probably Horowitz told him, but I didn\u2019t care, you know? And over there,\nnobody talked about those things. That was past and that was then and now is now and\nwe were very busy. First of all, the idea of -- th -- Americanization was a totally different\nconcept than it is now, you know\u201d? The ethnicity of things did not -- was -- wa -- wa -- did\nnot take priority. I\u2019m telling you, when he told me to pull my sleeve up and point to the\nnumber, th-the photographer from the Post, I did that, but I felt [indecipherable] this\nguy\u2019s stupid. I mean, why does he need that for? Ah, he want it, let him have it. And I\nhad a wonderful party and they gave me presents and we sung and I was so moved\nbecause that was really the first time that I was really celebrated for myself, you know?\nAnd by then I was rather well established in -- as a good student in the school, in\nJefferson, you see? So that I -- I didn\u2019t feel below anybody -- anybody American or\notherwise. I really felt on the level. I felt I -- I could just stand very proudly about -- feel\nthat way about myself. And, as I said, came time to go to college, you know? The school\nhelped us to -- we didn\u2019t know about applications and things and such. Dr. Karpen saw to\nit that most of us picked Brooklyn College, because that was the next step, you know.\nFrom Brooklyn, to go to Brooklyn College, since that was that free institution, we didn\u2019t\nhave the funds. So he -- the school helped us, applications and our records went in. We\nwere very good -- I say we, that group, were excellent students. In fact where -- when I\nfirst walked in to Brooklyn College, to one of the class, somebody cracked a joke, \u201cOh\nno, she\u2019s here again. We have to work.\u201d I mean in an outburst, you know, because they\nknew that I worked so very hard. I really did. But, anyhow, the Jefferson High School\nsaw to it that all the kids that wanted to go to Brooklyn College did so. There was no\nquestion about going out of town, because who had the funds? I lived with Kris and\nMiles. Meanwhile, I did go to Brooklyn College, but Kris and Miles -- Krisha and Miles\ndecided to move to New Jersey. But I did not want to miss the opportunity now, you see?\nSo I stayed behind and I had a scholarship from the educational foundation. I stayed with\nfriends, I lived with a family and they moved to New Jersey. And I was in Brooklyn\nCollege, about a drop over a year and I had, of course the -- some of these Polish, one of\nmy very good friends, Sonia, who 1s no longer alive -- she committed suicide, as a matter\nof fact, I told you, at age 39. There was a woman whose life was -- she had a PhD in\nEnglish and everything. But the war really made her a very unhappy person and totally\nunfit for really living. But that\u2019s another story. Anyhow, Sonia and I were in the --\ntogether in Brooklyn College, we came together out of Jefferson. She came to Jefferson a\nfew months before I did. And she was an orphan, left without any family at all. And she\nlived in orphanages and such. She had a rough life. She lived in the woods with the\npartisans and -- anyhow, when we found ourselves in Jefferson High School with -- in\nBrooklyn College together, we took about the same courses. We had such fun, because\nwe had to take all the requirements, which there was more of them -- then than now.\nPolitical science and we had a fantastic time. But every time we went home together, we\nspoke Polish. And I had a professor, his name was Felix Gross and he taught European\ntheory -- European political theory and I loved that. I -- I was very interested in history,\nalways and I was so -- now I was eager to find out -- you know, I was in the war and I\nwas -- as I always keep saying, in the eye of the storm, which is how it was. But my\nknowledge of the war was strictly on personal experience, but the wider picture was\neluding me, because I really didn\u2019t know and then I got so busy living, I didn\u2019t have the\ntime to find out. So now I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to really go after the historical aspect of how\nthe things happen.\u201d And he was teaching political -- European political history, or\nsomething like that. And he had an accent, but a lot of professors had accent, because\nthere were a lot of Jewish professors who left Europe in the 30\u2019s and this was only the\n40\u2019s, you see? Actually, this was \u201849 -- 1949. So one day -- so we saw him on the\nsubway, Sonia and I would go home and talk, you know, girl talk on the subway and talk\naway and talk. And then I used to notice that he used to sort of look at me peculiarly, but\nhe didn\u2019t say anything. He heard me in th -- I mean I -- I didn\u2019t know who he was. So one\nday, I\u2019m in another class and I get a note, Professor Gross has to see me immediately. I\nsaid -- in his office, he\u2019s waiting. Excuse me. I absolutely didn\u2019t know what happened.\nImmediately, out of the class, I have to go to see him. So I go to see him, I said, \u201cI\nreceived your message.\u201d He says, \u201cYes. I know that you speak Polish very well and you\nare going to accept a job teaching Polish at the Indiana University.\u201d I looked at him like\nhe fell off a tree. So I said, \u201cHow did you know that I speak Polish and that I speak Polish\nwell?\u201d He says, \u201cI hear you talk to your friends on the subway. On the --.\u201d Well, I\npractically wanted to kill myself that minute. I thought that was the end of everything.\nMy embarrassment, because you know, we were talking all this girl talk and the boy talk\nand he sat there and I didn\u2019t know he knew. Well, after I got over the embarrassment and\nI said, \u201cI -- what do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cI know you can do it and I know you\u2019re\nPolish, so you absolutely are the person, because they look -- they are looking for an\ninstructor who is a native and who had a back -- good -- very good, thorough European\nbackground. And you have that and you have the ability and you\u2019re going to go. And you\nhave to go downtown Manhattan to be interviewed.\u201d It was like a ton of bricks, and I\nsaid, \u201cWell, you know, I -- I can\u2019t go have a job there, I -- I got into college, I want to\nfinish college.\u201d He says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I already spoke to the -- to the head of the\ndepartment that they will adapt their schedule to your hours so that you could graduate\nchut.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to put over my graduation.\u201d I said, \u201cI have already\nlost so many years and now I\u2019m finally catching up and fitting in and I wouldn\u2019t want to\nleave Brooklyn College and get dragged out again for how long.\u201d He says, \u201cNo, no, no.\nEverything will be arranged. You have to go.\u201d I called my sister and Miles and I told\nthem, \u201cListen, I have this offer, what do I do? And he\u2019s pira -- he\u2019s pushing me here and I\nalready have an appointment.\u201d I went and I met this Professor Seebeeac. He was ahead of\nthe linguistics department at Indiana University. And he told me that they have now\nestablished a language center in Bloomington -- Bloomington, Indiana. And they -- this is\nnow the Cold War, you know, this is 1950. It\u2019s -- the Cold War is on. They need higher\nmilitary personnel. H-Higher ranked military personnel behind the Iron Curtain and they\nhave to know -- they have to be taught. And so I told him the same thing, I said, \u201cI can\u2019t\ntake a job, because I have to finish my studies.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You'll teach three hours a\nday and in the summer if you want to stay, you\u2019ll teach six hours a day.\u201d I said, \u201cFine.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWhat about writing -- what about the textbook?\u201d He says, \u201cWe'll write a\ntextbook.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s going to take m -- .\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cdon\u2019t worry.\u201d Lo and\nbehold, this is what happened, I went downtown, Manhattan, the old Barbizon Pla-Plaza\nHotel on Central Park West -- Central Park South, I was hired and within -- with a week I\nwas packed and he s -- waited at the railroad station for me. When I came -- I came by\nrailroad, Penn Station to -- to Bloom -- to Indianapolis. He was waiting for me. He got\nme into the housing office for regist -- I was asked whether I want to live alone, or in the\nsorority or what -- I said, \u201cNone of that, I want to live in the -- in the dormitory because I\nreally want to mix with people. I -- I am a people pe -- person.\u201d They asked me my\nreligion, which I was amazed about. They asked me if I would mind to live with a black\ngirl and I was practically fell through the floor, I -- how dare they ask such a stupid\nquestion. I said, \u201cNo, I -- I would live with anybody.\u201d I mean, listen -- look -- look where\nI came from, you know? I should now have prejudices yet, on top of where I come from?\nSo everything was arranged exactly as I wanted, meaning he helped me register, transfer\nmy courses, which were applicable because it was all academics. I didn\u2019t have any bean\nbag courses, you know. I had to -- he arranged housing. I -- I lived in a dormitory. He\narranged courses. Transfer of courses. I went -- I picked the courses that would fit. I\ntaught three hours a day and one professor from the linguistics department de-de-decided\nto write a book. And wa -- he -- I helped out with the exercises and such. And who -- the\npeople I was teaching, I had -- how many people did I have? Six or eight in the class.\nThese were Air Force officers. They were older than I was, of course. They were fantastic\npeople and to this day I\u2019m very friendly with them. We correspond through the years.\nThey were trained to be attach\u00e9\u2019s and such and you know, they had to know the\nlanguage. We taught grammar too, but basically there was -- half of it was conversation.\nAnd I[ had to write the conversation patterns. In other words, I picked the subject. And\nthey had to follow what I had to say and tell me -- we had a real conversation. In other\nwords, I had to judge how much of what I was -- I could pick any subject. I could talk\nabout the railroads, I could talk about love, I could talk -- I never talked about camp.\nNever, never, never. This was a totally different picture now. Meanwhile, before I left\nBrooklyn, I met Victor, my husband. And while -- he was drafted into the army, because\nthis was the Korean War -- he was drafted and meanwhile I got that offer. And so, when I\nwas in Indiana, he was in the army. And so he would come and visit me in Indiana. And\nthat\u2019s another very interesting story, because 1n those days, the dorm were not integrated.\nSo when Victor co -- used to come and visit me, he sat downstairs in the living room.\nYou know, the dorm had many rooms. When I tell it to my kids -- and there was curfew,\nI had to be back at 12 -- they said, \u201cYou allowed yourself -- you allowed them to do it to\nyou?\u201d What did they do to me? You know, this is ancient history. So Victor used to come\n-- he used to come in the uniform, because that was cheaper to travel as a uni -- you\nknow, as a -- as a military. He was stationed in Watertown, New York. No, not far from\nSt. Lawrence, which was by coincidence turned out year later as a school for Paul. But\nVictor was stationed there and I was in Indiana and I would stay on. We would meet. If I\ntook a trip, let\u2019s say for Christmas, to New York, then we would meet in New York. He\nworked in the headquarters in Watertown, New York, so he somehow managed to -- to\nget the time when I was there or he\u2019d come to Indiana and we had friends in Indianapolis,\nfrom Poland. So he would come to Indianapolis, I would come to Indianapolis and there -\n- he would stay -- we would visit with the f -- with our friends. And I had a very\nwonderful time in Indiana. That is really a very special time in my life, you know? I was\nalready academ -- I was first of all financially independent, totally. Because I was paid.\nThe courses I took, I did not have to pay the regular big fee, because instructors always\nhad a discount. I was earning enough to be truly independent, fully and enjoy and loving\nit. Loving the job, loving the company, loving the dormitory, loving the class, loving\neverything, including Bloomington, because New York I thought was Europe. You\nknow, it was like Professor Gross used to say, \u201cNew York 1s the last city -- when you\ncome from Europe to America, New York is the last European city. After that is\nAmerica.\u201d He used to say that. And I found it very true. So when I came to Bloomington\nand that was the midwest. And believe me, that was a different kind of place, too. As I\ntold you, I was asked to fill in my religion when I registered and I was asked whether I\nwould room with a black girl, with a Negro girl. So you could see those were different\ntimes. And -- however, this -- the -- the -- the whole ambiance of the place -- I took the\ncourses I loved and by the way, I took -- I ma -- I majored in social work. So my degree\nfrom Bloomington, from Indiana University is in social work. Even though I was an\ninstructor at the same time. And I met many wonderful friends, of course, again to this\nday. I keep on with everybody from -- you -- as I call my connection, my Indiana\nconnection or my Berlin connection, you know, my Jefferson connection, my Indiana\nconnection. I have a lot of friends. And it was a very exciting time, because I finally -- I\nthink it equalized for me, you know. My academic, my emotional, my physical, my all, it\nall came together, finally, you know? And I was beginning to feel very much at ease in\nAmerica. I knew English very well, ve done a lot of good things. And I\u2019ve traveled to\nCanada to visit my sister a lot and I was very attached to the Lehrman\u2019s, you know. Very\n-- | mean, we\u2019re such a close family, knock wood, to this day. I mean , we\u2019re just one.\nAnd the kids -- our kids are now their kids and -- and our kid\u2019s kid\u2019s and all the cousins,\nthat\u2019s just one, to this day. But Indiana was fantastic, 1t was rewarding, emotionally. It\nwas rewarding intellectually. It was most rewarding as a final -- it\u2019s a trite word,\nAmericanization -- but I was taken in to -- to what this life was. In other words, now --\nnot that I was done with Europe. You know, I can\u2019t be done with Europe, is like I can\u2019t\nbe done with my right hand, you know. But I finally got into the spirit of the country and\nof -- oh, I got involved and -- and -- and I already had my ideas of politics and all this. It\nreally, absolutely coalesced. It really got together. It -- it -- 1t formed into a -- a unit. And\nso that when Victor -- we were planning to get married, we got engaged, meanwhile. And\nwhen Victor was discharged from the army in January of \u201853, I was supposed to graduate\nin February, you know. In those days they graduated classes twice a year, February and\nJune. I was slated to graduate in February. So, Victor came for my graduation, I have\nlovely pictures from that time and all the girls friends that I had there. And we came back\nto New York and we got married in March of the same year. Because he was now free,\ntoo. He was free of the mel -- military. He certainly didn\u2019t want to be a military man, but\nhe had to. He was drafted, so he had to serve -- serve his time. And so we -- we got\nmarried and I didn\u2019t quite know whether I wanted to go into social work any more. You\nknow, I went -- I applied to Columbia for social work degree, PhD. But just about that\ntime, things began to be a little different -- or maybe it was different, New York was\ndifferent from Indiana. Over there, everything -- social work was still like -- they used to\ncall it welfare, you know. Welfare was very shameful. I remember one day in the class --\nI used to atte -- I used to -- I had cases, casework outside of my class. I had field work to\ndo. I had two cases. One was an old lady, was called Mrs. Wheeler. And another case\nwas a abandoned someb -- child or something like that. Anyhow, while they were\ndiscussing cases and I made a mistake and I said when I -- that Mrs. Wheeler -- I was\nstopped by the professor right then and there. She said, \u201cNever, ever, ever, ever must you\nmention the client by name. Never. Because this is very shameful to her to receive\nwelfare. That if you discuss cases, you have to keep on the professional level, without\nreference to name.\u201d I -- that was the -- th-the philosophy of welfare in those days was that\nyou can -- you are to help the person to help himself, but nothing -- not -- not to -- to\nprovide for him for a lifetime. I came to America and I went to Columbia to apply. I\ncame to America -- I came to New York and I went to apply to Columbia and they started\nb-briefing me on how the school is oriented and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not for me.\u201d This is a\nhandout. This is against my own principles, forget what I was taught at Indiana. You\nknow, this -- I remember Mitchell Ginsburg, I think was the name of the head of th-the\nsocial work school. I told acur, \u201cI don\u2019t think I belong there. I don\u2019t think Pll be happy\nthere. I can\u2019t see running programs to -- to -- to make people di -- di -- to -- to -- to live\non handouts.\u201d I mean, you know, I was poor enough in -- that we -- we didn\u2019t know\nwhere the next meal was coming cru -- from, if ever the meal will come from. And all the\nso-called schnoring, you know? It wasn\u2019t pit -- it wasn\u2019t shameful to -- to schnor for\nbread when you were starving. It was pitiful. And I would now work for an agency that\u2019s\ngoing to sa -- to -- to -- to -- to supply all the schnorer\u2019s of the world? Not for me. I\ndecided Ill wait a few years. I wouldn\u2019t go back to -- right away to social work. Then\nthey offered me jobs at the UN, I didn\u2019t want that. I really wanted -- really -- I was most\ninterested in setting up a life -- a married life, you see? I was so knocked around with so\nmany places and so many people. You know, after the Lehrman\u2019s moved to New -- to\nVineland, I lived with three families before I went to Indiana. I lived with one family and\nthen I moved to a girl\u2019s club. And that wasn\u2019t very good for me either, because there was\ntoo much commotion, I couldn\u2019t study. Then I moved with a -- another Jewish family\nfrom Poland that I knew, so that was okay. And then I moved to Indiana and I didn\u2019t yet\nhave, you know -- like when I lived with the Lehrman\u2019s, sure that was home, but it still\nwasn\u2019t what I really wanted -- to have a place of my own and to -- being self-supporting\nand doing -- being productive in a way that the life prepared me for. What was the use of\nall that education and everything, if I were not going to apply it to a normal life that\nwould finally go back to what I understand life to be, which is now a very old-fashioned\nconcept, you know. But to me, that was very important.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: Yes. Well, you see, having been orphaned during the war, I had one idea in mind. I\nmust never be a burden to anybody. Not even to my sisters. They were my protectors,\nthey were my surrogate parents, they were my everything. I still was not going to be a\nburden. And it was so ingrained into me, that when I lived with the Lehrman\u2019s and I did\nthe cooking and the cleaning, I was thrilled. Because they were so good to me, they were\nsupporting me, but at least I was not a schnorer. You see, I was not somebody -- and later\non too, whatever it was that I did -- I babysat. I had a job one summer when I was in high\nschool as a governess, 25 do-dollars a week. Five weeks job, I bought myself a mouton\nfur coat, a warm mouton, it was a fur coat, quote unquote. I had jobs in -- in summer\ncamps as a governess, as a counselor. I babysat, I -- I worked -- when I was in high\nschool, I worked. I forgot to mention that. Dr. Karpen\u2019s wife -- or maybe I did mention it,\nwas the head of the ORT organization. I got a job in ORT, in the ORT office, main office\nin New York. 23rd Street and Madison Square and I was in Brooklyn. I used to go from\nhigh school, from Jefferson High School, on the subway an hour and a half to go to ORT\nto work and back, after school. And I came home and I had to cook and clean and I was\nmore than happy. Because -- and then I babysat and Is -- and I did everything I could --\nnot that the Lehrman\u2019s ever, ever, ever brought it up to me. If Krisha got a coat, I got a\ncoat. If Krisha got -- I was -- like Mile\u2019s said, I was going to be their charge and -- until I\nget married. And it exactly was like that. But before I was married, I already had this\nthing, because I was in the war and things were so hard and we were so poor and -- not\npoor poor, but we were so deprived of everything, that I said, when I\u2019m finally -- when it\nfinally happens, never will I be a burden. So, to connect all this -- this 1s personal\nphilosophy, that precedes anything before America, even. Then I come to America and I\nsee what the Jewish agencies do for people. Put them on their feet and let them go. I go to\nIndiana and it\u2019s about the same idea. You help people along, an old lady who 1s an old\nwidow, who must never -- nobody must -- should ever know her name. She\u2019s being held\nby a young intern, myself, to go and find out what she needs and so on and so forth, but\neverything is -- not in secrecy, but it should be done with dignity, you see? And then I\ncome to New York and I bump against this new concept, that they are explaining to me\nwhat this school idea 1s, of -- of educating social workers and how I\u2019m going to fit into it.\nAnd I see I am not going to fit into it.",
        "A: The concept was -- you see, we are now talking about the mid -- th-the 50\u2019s, you see?\nThat there are too many poor people in this wor -- the America and they should be put --\nthey should be given things. There\u2019s so much goodness, because you know, America in\nthe 30\u2019s had the Depression. During the war, America brought itself out of the\nDepression, after, you know with the help of Franklin Roosevelt. In the 50\u2019s, this was a\nland of plenty. There was no war, there was prosperity and yet there were very many\npoor people. And the idea was to re-organize the society. I mean in schools of social\nwork, such as the New York school. Which I later found out he was a lidding -- leading\nliberal, I -- this head of the school, gee whiz. Well, anyhow, the idea was that now you\nhave to provide for the poor. But for me, to provide for the poor is not the way I saw\nsocial work. To me, helping the poor, is a way, but not -- it was more like Indiana, you\nsee? Where everything should be kept within very dignified -- welfare was a dirty word,\nyou know. Welfare in those days was -- they say, \u201cOh, she was on welfare.\u201d This type of\nthing was derogatory. In Indiana we had it pounded into our heads, you don\u2019t use word\nwelfare, you don\u2019t use the client\u2019s name. You -- you keep it as dignified, so that the least\npeople should know that this person is getting helped, which was aid to aged people and\nSO on, you see? So, to answer your question, I did not think that I was going to be very\nhappy in this school. Of course I could have applied to any other school of social work.\nBut I was really, basically interested in starting my own life, personal life. I said, \u201cGee\nwhiz, I already put in time for all those other things that were of importance to me. I\nfinally have the education, I finally feel myself equal to everybody else. I finally caught\nup within my own inner self, between the emotional and the intellectual and the m -- the\nmature. I already -- you know, because on one level I was very mature after the war was\nended and on another level I was totally 1ignoramus and stupid, probably. I was a kid and\n-- and it -- 1t just wasn\u2019t -- it didn\u2019t mesh yet. When I came out of Indiana and -- and we\ngot married, I really knew that I was already a person 1-1n my own right and it was time\nto really make a home for myself and -- and whatever I felt was going to be my family.",
        "A: Oh yes, eventually I shoulds -- definitely would want to have children, but at first I\nwas just interested in not having another roommate. Like everybody said to me, \u201cHow\ndoes it feel to be married?\u201d I says, \u201cYou know what? You just live with the same\nroommate. I -- I\u2019ve lived with so many roommates now. This is just one more roommate,\nso I have no problem with that.\u201d Because it\u2019s true. By that time you have no idea, since\nwe came to America, how many roommates I had, you know? So I said, \u201cNo, Victor\u2019s\njust another roommate, so I don\u2019t have a problem with that. And we get along very well,\nwe love each other. So it\u2019s great.\u201d And it was, you see? And the type of home was to -- to\nestablish -- you know, I love company and I love to see people and to -- to have people\nover and to visit with people. Yeah, I\u2019m very people oriented person, so this is how I\nvisualized it and that\u2019s more or less how we started out.",
        "A: Well, we actually -- first we lived downtown in a hotel, for about two months, three\nmonths and then we moved up into this neighborhood in a smaller apartment. Victor\nworked downtown and we -- we lived here, on Cabrini Boulevard. On that street that\nfaces the river, but further down. And oh, we didn\u2019t -- now -- now we really lived a good\nlife. We traveled, we went to Bermuda for sort of a honeymoon, we went on vacation.\nWe went to places, we -- of course New York, to me, you know, I was away from New\nYork also. So now it\u2019s -- you know I -- I -- I couldn\u2019t have enough of it. Go to the\nmuseums and join this and do that and -- and it was -- we didn\u2019t have kids yet, not for\nthree years. So life was very good. Very, very good. And we eventually, when I became\npregnant with the first child, Victor said, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to live in one bedroom\napartment and we\u2019re not going to wait til -- til we have to move after the baby\u2019s born,\nthen it\u2019s going to be much harder than it is now. And this building here was going up in\nthose years and he says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we stop and take a look?\u201d So we stopped and take a\nlook and we found this apartment, because it was just being finished. You know, the\nbuilding was just being ready for occupancy. So we moved in, I was still pregnant and\nthe first child was born -- not in this apartment, but you know, in the hospital and we\nlived here. Our older son Harry. And he -- he was born here when we were -- I don\u2019t\nknow, we moved around Thanksgiving and he was born in May, so we were about half a\nyear here when he -- and I used to go to -- Victor\u2019s family had the business and they had\nindustrial -- industrial cottons and I used to go to work in the business, before the babies\nwere born, because the children were born. So I helped out in the business for the first\nthree years. It was nicer to be around Victor all the time anyhow. And -- and I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to -- I didn\u2019t want to work at the UN. And I didn\u2019t -- certainly didn\u2019t want to go to -\n- to social work, not yet, until I really saw my way clear.",
        "A: You know, they were dealing with all kinds of things that I really didn\u2019t want to be --\nyou know, I broke away from everything, you, know? From the problems of wars, of\nresettlements, of all -- I wanted to live an American life, you know? I really wanted\nsomething, you know, like use the expression, \u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d I\u2019ve been in\nEurope, I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019ve done all the -- I had enough, I had enough of that. No UN for\nme, no. Yo -- subsequently, you know, when I became an -- and -- a translator, they\nwanted me. I could have had that job, because I have a lot of friends working there. No,\nbut going back to 1953, when we were married and we moved here, to Cabrini Boulevard\nand then we moved to this building, which is also on Cabrini, but one block up, next to\nthe park. And Harry was born.",
        "A: The second child, Paul, was born in -- four years later. So that in the first four years, I\nactually had a little hard time the first two years. I was so conscientious about everything,\nI didn\u2019t think I was doing a good job with the baby. I read a lot about -- I read about Dr.\nSpock in yesterday\u2019s paper, you know he died? So I read a lot Dr. Spock and he put me at\nease, because I didn\u2019t have family here, you see, and Victor\u2019s family wasn\u2019t in town\neither, they moved out. So, I was very -- I wasn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t well, physically. I had a hard\n-- hard childbirth and so on. But once I got over that, everything was fine and I started\ntaking courses. You know, school and me, that\u2019s one. I took -- first I took courses in the\nneighborhood. I studied Russian. Was a Mrs. Cherniak, she was a -- a retired teacher,\nRussian teacher, so we got together in group again, like in Poland during the war, there\nwere four of us, we\u2019re studying with Mrs. Cherniak. Then I went to the new school to\ncontinue the studies, the Russian studies. And of course we started having more friends\nand more going out and more, you know, a young couple. But after Harry was born, I\nstarted really more con-concentrating more on the -- on the personal fulfillment type of\nthing, you know. So I started taking courses. I went to Barnard. Then I took French\ncooking lessons. Then I did, you know, I took translation courses and all these and of\ncourse I would not leave the children to anybody, so I decided, until the children are talk\n-- older, I am not doing anything except bringing up children.",
        "A: Oh, yes. Absolutely. Had -- I had -- didn\u2019t have much to do with my war time\nexperiences. Basically, I wanted them to feel happy, that -- every mother wants that. I\nwanted them to ex-excel in school, which they did. By the way, I did a lot of volunteer\nwork while the kids were in school. They went to an public school, P.S. 187, which is\nnext door to us here. I was -- 11 -- for 11 years I was a head librarian, volunteer librarian.\nAnd then in Bronx High School of Science, when they both went to Bronx High School\nof Science, I was also very active. I was vice-president -- I never wanted presidency, not\nhere, not at -- nobody was going to get me to be president, nobody. And they tried. Vice-\npresident and chairman of the executive board at Bronx High School of Science. And we\ndid a lot of good things there. During the teacher\u2019s strike, you know, that protected the\nschool from being reorganized, but this is all academic stuff that is very important, but I\ndon\u2019t think it -- that it\u2019s very pertinent here. The point is that while the kids were growing\nup and we were very involved in the community, Victor was committee chairman for the\nBoy Scouts, both boys became Boy Scouts. Both are Eagle Scouts, by the way. Both\nHarry and Paul are Eagle Scouts. Harry, to this day is scoutmaster, every day. That\u2019s how\nhe comes here on Fridays, because he has a troop Boy Scouts here. Well, anyhow --",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, Jewish American, yes. His family originally came from Austro-\nHungary, but his father was already born in this country, so you know that he\u2019s third\ngeneration. His grandfather came to America in the 19th century, when he was a young\nman, I mean teenager, I think. And his mother\u2019s side, he has a grandmother who is buried\non Staten Island. As I told you, we go to cemeteries there. She was buried in 1886 in\nStaten Island. She was buried in \u201886, you see? So they go way back -- way, way back.\nBut -- no, w-we always were very compatible, no question about that. And he\u2019s Jewish\nand he\u2019s also of the -- not of the religious, which was important.",
        "A: Yes, we belong to the Reform Temple here. Our children were Bar Mitzvah and all\nthis and we -- we are still very good members of the Temple, we su -- we support the\nTemple financially, always, always. We go to -- we go to services dirs -- definitely on the\nhigh holidays. And Passover is very important. By the way, Passover is our community\ndinner again. We have the whole family get together. We have always the Lehrman\u2019s,\neverybody, all the kids and the grandkids and everybody, we have. That\u2019s annual. So --",
        "A: Well, I was there just for a visit, as everybody else would go. It\u2019s another type of life\nand by the time I went there, you see, I was so swallowed up by American -- by America,\nby this new life. I imagine I would have been swallowed up in Israel too, because I was\nready, you know. I -- I couldn\u2019t wait to start normal living. You see, I -- normal --\nwhatever I call normal. To -- first of all, to be plugged into academics. And then to -- to\ndo the things that stimulate the brain and the -- you know, that -- and the thing is that --\nwhen I came to Israel, well, we already had grown children and I was already an\nAmerican in more ways than one and I have a lot of friends there, we visited all the\nfriends. Of course we went to Israel to visit Israel, which we did, too. But then I -- they\nwere so smart, one friend says to me, \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to have dinner in everybody\u2019s\nhouse every night, so that you wouldn\u2019t see Israel, so I invite --\u201d, she invited everybody.\nSo I saw ev -- all the friends from camp and such, all at one time and we traveled in Israel\nand saw a lot and was -- but I couldn\u2019t see my life away from this life any more, you see?\n[ -- I\u2019m really -- this is really -- this life is what I really want and what I -- you know, as --\nwhen the kids grew up, kids went to college, you know, both went to college and Harry\u2019s\na lawyer now, he went to law school and he\u2019s married and has two children, one is nine\nyear old and -- Max and then a new one was just born, last December.",
        "A: Thank you. His name is Joseph. Lovely. And they gave him a middle name, Adrian,\nmy sister\u2019s -- from Canada, you know? Her husband just died last summer, so they gave\nhim a middle name. And the younger son, Paul, lives in Albuquerque. Remember I told\nyou he lives in New Mexico. And he had the -- a degree in geology and went into\nlandscaping and so he has a landscaping business. Real outdoorsy man. He\u2019s coming for\nthe Pa-Passover holidays, as he always does. We\u2019Il see him a little, you know, a few\ntimes a year.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Well, you see, with my husband, it\u2019s like this: he married me when I -- he knew I went\nthrough the camps. When I met him, not very m-much was known about all these things.\nHe knew I had a number and he knew I ca -- he knew my background. He -- I told him as\nmuch as I could, but th-the -- only as a -- as a fill-in, like I wanted to find out about his\nfamily, where they came from and what they did and how they did it. When the children\nwere born, I wasn\u2019t -- I was never -- I never wa -- intended to hide my background,\nnever, never. They -- and when I was in camp as this counselor, they said, \u201cYou know,\nRed,\u201d -- they used to call me Reggie, they said, \u201cShow me your number. Why did you\nput your telephone number there?\u201d Th-The kids in -- in -- 1n camp -- in the -- this was\nhere in the New York state, in a camp. And so later, when the -- my own kids were young\nand they used to say, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I used to say, \u201cThat\u2019s my telephone number,\u201d when\nthey were two years old. But later on, of course they knew everything, but I never sa --\nburdened them with, \u201cSit down and I\u2019Il tell you.\u201d Never, never, never. First of all, they\nwere both smart children and very read -- they read a lot, like I do, so they always used to\nfind out a lit -- so tell me about it. Any time they were ready to tell, I told everything.\nAnd Victor, too. He knows my life inside out and sideways, because he\u2019s already heard\neverything. And you know, as time evolves, you know, eventually I became a translator\nand interpreter and I did all kinds of jobs. And a lot of work I\u2019m doing 1s really dealing\nnow, not so much before -- I did a lot of commercial interpreting and -- and translating.\nI\u2019m a member of the National Association of Translators. Cr -- Accredited so I get calls\nfrom all over. Now I -- my husband is retired, so I don\u2019t want to take as many jobs as -- I\ncould, if I wanted to, because I always get calls for jobs. But you see, when -- the last 10\nyears, the majority of -- of -- I\u2019m a free-lancer -- of work, is -- deals with the Holocaust.\nAnd it\u2019s a -- you know, I did -- did you ever see a -- a -- a film or did you ever read a\nbook called the Lodz ghetto? Okay, you see my name in that, I did the interpr -- the -- the\n-- one third of that book came from Polish. I did the -- the translations and I worked on it\na year and a half, because I got, used to get the material on a -- in and out by pieces. You\nknow, they used to get the -- all the Lodz ghetto book and the film. Kolchuk, a lot of\nKolchuk, all of Kolchuk material I used to do way. Somebody wrote a play in California,\nfor which I did translations of Kolchuk. I just translated a book about the Krakow ghetto\nand of course, I was given a lot of mat -- other material about the Gypsies, about -- sa --\nI\u2019m telling, the last 10 years, I do still commercial work, you know, legal work and the\npositions and such. But somehow or other, because I know the background, you see? It\u2019s\nvery easy for me. I get phone calls, see? I get -- belong to this organization, so my friends\nin New York call me every now and then, they have work to do, what does this mean,\nwhat does that mean? To me, I don\u2019t even have to look it up, because if 1t deals with the\nwar years, I really, truly have a better understanding, because you don\u2019t translate words,\nyou know, you work within a framework of a -- a concept. And the underlying concept,\nanything to do with Holocaust, not everybody, even in the language, you know language\ndeflects very much the times and word that could mean one thing 50 years ago, couldn\u2019t\nmean the same today. So, what I\u2019m trying to say is that, somehow or other, because I\u2019m\nworking, I always have some Holocaust material. Victor is in -- one time, if I wa -- had\ntoo much work to do, I ask him to -- I -- I translate by hand, sometimes he would type the\nmaterial for me, you see? If it -- because I had to submit it 1n typing and if I was\noverwhelmed, he will help me out a little and sit at night, after he came from the office\nand he would -- he would help me type. So he -- he knew what I was working on and he\nwould read it, you see and now he du -- doesn\u2019t, I mean I don\u2019t do these jobs any more,\nbecause our life is too busy and he\u2019s retired and I -- I -- I should not be tying him down to\n-- you know, 1-1f I start getting jobs, even though I\u2019m a freelancer, that means he has to\nhang around, too. You know, we can\u2019t take a trip, we can\u2019t do this, we can\u2019t do that. So,\nthis way, if it\u2019s a short job I take it. Last job I did was a book, took me a year. And I told\nthe person, I said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it less than a year, because I -- absut -- don\u2019t -- I mean,\nyou want it? Fine. If not, that\u2019s fine.\u201d But I did it, so was one year.\nCutting is a place where the Polish officers, the Christian officers were killed in a ravine\nin -- in -- in, by Russians. But they said the Germans did it, but it really was the Russians.\nSo -- no, when I added all this up, what I heard from the Jews who went into Russia\nduring the war and who came out -- and through the Christians who suffered in Russia\nand through all those other things that the -- the Communist regime was doing, I -- I had\nno love for them. So when I saw that McCarthy was pursuing the so-called Communists,\nand -- and fellow travelers --used to be called in those days, a lot of it was not factual.\nYou know, because as I understood American history, in the 30\u2019s, there was a great\nliberal movement in this country, that felt for Russia, you know, that -- that -- but of\ncourse that turned out to be a whole bunch of -- bunch of lies. The Russian, so-called,\nyou know, the -- the Russian, th-the trials and the -- I mean, this was -- now you\u2019re\nfinding out that Stalin was as big a murderer as Hitler, you see. So I already had a good\ninkling in the 50\u2019s and in the 60\u2019s and when the McCarthy came, that -- 1t was absolutely\npainful to me. That was one very drastic awareness, shake-up in my head. The second\nwas the 60\u2019s, not the Civil Right Movements, because I didn\u2019t know the extent to which\nthe -- the blacks were being oppressed, prior to coming. I knew I was in Indiana with\nblacks and I was in Jefferson with and I -- it di-didn\u2019t make any difference to me and I\ndidn\u2019t acc -- understand the extent of everything. But you see, I did very much object to\nthe so-called revolution, the hippie revolution in the 60 and 80, 60\u2019s -- in the 60\u2019s,\nbecause that was already tearing at the fabric of society, you see? And I went through\nvery hard times in -- in the 1968 school strike, when I was so involved with the school\nboard and the -- the library and all these school things and we had factions of people who\nwere ready to tear down the system and -- oh, a lot of energy and a lot of tribulations, I\nassoc-associate with that, plus the 60\u2019s as an -- a revolt against the culture, American --\nyou know the hippie movement and the free love movement and the living in communes,\nwhich everything now comes out to be that it really wasn\u2019t, you know? Th-This -- this --\nth-th-the flower children and all. It was only a sort of a -- you know, their numbers were\ngreater, because they\u2019re the boom -- the boomers, the baby boomers, so they could really\nshow force in numbers. But what they stood for wasn\u2019t very much. It was something that\ndidn\u2019t pan out the way they expected it, which of course everybody knew from the\nbeginning that it wasn\u2019t going to pan out. As I knew in City College had -- they had open\nadmission and we are predicted 30 years ago, they took 30 years to come to the point,\nafter they ruined three generations of students. I predicted that open admission is going to\nkill the standards, the academic standards. That there was no reason why children could\nnot learn, as -- as I saw with my own eyes. Children can learn if they are motivated. You\ndon\u2019t bring them down to a levels of -- of whatever, you take them up. And now you see\n-- now they are to -- trying to re -- re -- in my days, Brooklyn College and City College\nwere as good as Harvard any time. You see, in high schools and everything. But the -- in\nthe 60\u2019s, where all this movement started toward liberalization of everything, so they\nthrew the baby with the bathwater together, out. And I know what we went through here\nin the schools. Bronx High School of Science was threatened to become a neighborhood\nschool, not a specialized high school. We were instrumental, through Albany, to take it\nout from under the auspices of the brook -- of the -- no, in Brooklyn, it\u2019s a school --\nschool administration for the city of New York. Place it under the state administration. I\nwas instrumental in it, because Senator Zaretski from Albany lived in our neighborhood.\nAnd we had a meeting with him -- science parents and he told us we will need a sponsor\na bill. And we had two parents with children who went to Bronx Science. It\u2019s Hirkt and\nColundra bill was put through the senate -- state senate and Science was -- five -- five\nspecialized schools were taking out from under the jurisdiction of the Board of Education\nin Brooklyn and pay -- placed under the state jurisdiction. And that was Bronx Science,\nStuyvesant, Brooklyn Tech, Music and Art and Hunter. We saved those schools, because\nthat was -- they were saying this --these schools were elitist, so they don\u2019t belong in a\ndemocratic country. They belong as neighborhood schools. Well, every neighborhood\nschool, which I told you Jefferson High School -- when I tell somebody Jefferson High\nSchool, they give me a double look. They say, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have gone to Jefferson\nHigh School.\u201d \u201cYes, I did.\u201d It was a fantastic school, it was on the highest level. And\nthese school, luckily, the bill was passed, we went to all the new -- attended to it. And we\nhad all these, we had very strong parent\u2019s association in Bronx Science, so that was\naccomplished, but all this ties in with that movement in the 60\u2019s, everything goes. In\nother words, you could tear everything that you don\u2019t think is at all valuable. Of course,\nwhen you\u2019re young, nothing is valuable, because you want to rebel. You rebel against\nthis and that and the other, but then give you 20 more years and you look back, you say,\n\u201cWhy\u2019d I do that?\u201d You know? And all these -- these yuppies today, called yuppies, you\nknow? When they were -- they were the yippies, when they were -- look at how many of\nthem ended up in -- 1n ne -- th -- the -- the -- the -- the what do they call that? Th-The --\nIndustrial complex? What was the name? Military industrial complex. I mean, look how\nmany of these went into big business, they are on top of all the big corporations and\nthings and they left all that nonsense behind. And I am sorry to say that now things are\nturning back, because what was -- it was really that 1t wasn\u2019t any good. You asked me\nbefore how I wanted to bring up my children. Well, our emphasis, as you could see with\nmy involvement with the schools, was tremendous. Both of us, but -- in fact, Victor,\nwhen it started to getting very hard to get to Bronx Science at night, I was afraid alone.\nSo Victor would come from work and take me there. Because you know, it\u2019s a trip by\nsubway. So they said, \u201cWhat are you --.\u201d He said he would just sit there. So they said --\nused to meet in the library -- used to say, \u201cWhy is Victor sitting on the side?\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell, because he has to ring me, I\u2019m afraid to come in now.\u201d \u201cNo such thing.\u201d So he\nbecame treasurer. They pulled him in, hook or crook. They say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care what you\nsay, you sitting here, you going to be treasurer.\u201d So he was trea -- he was treasurer\neverywhere, all the time, but anyhow, Bronx Science, he said he\u2019d just take me there and\nhe\u2019 ll sit and he\u2019II read his pa -- newspapers, whatever there, on the side and they said,\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re going to be treasurer.\u201d So, no, the kids were very much oriented to -- not so\nmuch to succeed as to broaden their horizon. We traveled a lot with them, we -- together.\nWe did a lot of very interesting things. Kids used to go to summer camp, to the Boy\nScouts for a month. And then we used to go traveling together. Nova Scotia, Prince\nEdward Island, Canada very often. All the way to Indiana to re-visit my school. It was\nvery interesting and interesting trips and we wanted them to excel, very much and we\nwanted them -- we never pressed, you know. Harry, the older one, always knew that he\nwanted to be a lawyer or something like that and Paul knew always he could not be a\nlawyer or anything that would keep him at a desk, you see? He\u2019s a very successful,\nlovely, lovely guy, but he\u2019s all outdoors. He cannot -- you would not put him -- he\u2019s --",
        "A: He has a landscaping business and he is very happy being outdoors, all the time. He\nruns a business, he works on the site, with -- he plans the landscaping, you know, he\ndraws projects and he does big -- you know, big jobs.",
        "A: That\u2019s Paul. No, Harry is a lawyer and he\u2019s married to Cheryl and she\u2019s -- she works\nin New York for the arts. Used to work for 10 years to the -- she was director of\ndevelopment for New York City ballet and now she works for the 42nd Street\nDevelopment Corporation. You know, the people who are the -- who are developing --\nyou know the Ford Theater and the New Victory Theater, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the arts that\nshe\u2019s working for.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: Well, I think I did elaborate on the fact that certain lessons learned, through the bare\nexperiences, benefited me in a certain way. Number one is the importance of family. We\nare -- we were, the three of us, the three sisters, were extremely close. Each one of us\nmarried, we were extremely close as six people. Each one of us has children and\ngrandchildren and we are extremely close. This is no exaggeration, even though my\noldest sister has been living in Canada. They could not make it to America, you know,\nbecause by then the quota was closed or whatever, by the time they came. So they went\nto Canada, sponsored by my uncle, who lived there then. And the importance of family,\nof being there, of being there for those whom you love and who love you. This is the sum\nand substance of what I took out of my bad experiences. The reason being, that my\nparents were torn away from me, as was my extended family. Torn away in a way that\nyou don\u2019t even have a grave to go to, you see? Therefore, the idea of the family unit,\nwhich, as I\u2019m getting older, I find even more important, because society is changing so\nquickly. People are scattered. In the old days, there was always a -- a nucleus and a f --\nand a -- an extended family within one geographic area. Now, even in our own case --\nyou see Paul, our youngest son, lives in Albuquerque. Of course, we see each other two\nor three times a year, he comes to every important ceremony or celebration. A bris and\nthe Passover Seder always and unfortunately last summer, we lost my brother-in-law, he\nwent to -- came to the funeral. And other than that, he comes to New York too and we\u2019re\non the phone five to seven days a week. I mean, we have to find out where the weather 1s\nlike and such. That is the most important thing of all. And as I say, it 1s being reinforced\nas I see the culture in America changing. And the people getting alienated and scattered.\nSo, for that, I am grateful that I was able to achieve that. That was really my number one\nthing op -- uppermost -- to create a family and to stay within that unit. I have achieved\nthat. I have always been extremely attached to academics, as I said. And I was forever\ngrateful that I could get my education -- higher education here. To the extent to which an\neducation opens your eyes on things that you could do on your own. I didn\u2019t have -- I\nwas going to get the -- more degrees, but it -- 1t didn\u2019t turn out with degrees, but it turned\nout just the same that through the years, I was either involved in courses, or I was giving\ncourses, or I was engaged one way or another with the schools or whichever. Very\ngrateful for the fact that I could accomplish that, so that I could develop my mind and\nnow at my age, have all the resources. If I\u2019m interested in this, I know how to find it, I\nknow where to look for it, I know what I like, I know which museum exhibit I will go to\nand which I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t go to the movies just because it\u2019s playing. I know what I want\nand I wa -- that I don\u2019t want. I read the same way, selectively, always selectively -- so\nthat I\u2019m very grateful for that. And other than that, you know, I feel for the world that is\nsuffering. The way things have not -- have not really come to a conclusion after the\nHolocaust on -- in the larger sense. It\u2019s still the same thing 1s going on. Not to the same\nextent, but -- you read the papers and there\u2019s Ireland and there\u2019s Bosnia and now you\nhave Kosovo and you have -- so one way or another, I don\u2019t think that this -- in my\nlifetime, that I have seen a resolution of that bigger problem, which is humankind. Of\ncourse, nothing would ever -- I can\u2019t imagine a thing would ever compare to the genocide\ndone by the Nazis to the Jews. That, I think, is in a category all it\u2019s own. And much as\npeople are trying to use the word Holocaust, which is now -- I -- I noticed this in the\npapers, the Times writes about it a lot, that the people are acquiring the Holoc -- the\nJapanese Holocaust. This is totally without comparison. No experience -- no experience\ncompares to the Hol -- Jewish Holocaust -- the European Jewish Holocaust. Not in\nhistory as I know history and not the present time in anywhere, does that compare. The\nsystematic, technological destruction of people, with a plan, that 1s a separate -- totally\nseparate event. As events in history go, that must always stand on it\u2019s own. And I -- I feel\nfor other people, I sympathize with the Japanese, but I know what Holocaust is. ve been\nthere, I\u2019ve lived through it. I lost most of my family there and I can tell you that nothing\never -- nothing ever happened to compare. And I hope it will never happen, which we\ndon\u2019t know, because technology now is even more advanced than it was in Hitler\u2019s time.\nHe could gas and -- and -- and -- and burn them in the chimneys. Today, maybe they cou\n-- they could just nuke them, if they wanted to. You know, you could throw one bomb\nand th-the -- nuke the whole world. But this 1s -- those are the things that -- in the larger\nscale about the Holocaust. But on the personals -- on the person -- coming down again to\nthe specific from the general, I can tell you I consider myself extremely lucky. I survived,\nnot because I really was clever or smart or anything. It just -- just -- that was that chance.\nI married Victor, who\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful husband and a wonderful father and we\nhad a -- had a very peaceful, wonderful life. I probably could never go through life again\nwith any upheavals of any kind. We are both sort of, we\u2019re -- you know, we like quiet\nand solitude -- not solitude, but we don\u2019t like the excitement. I mean I -- when we were\nyounger, we\u2019d -- we did a little more, but absolutely I -- I -- I\u2019m very grateful that -- that\nwe are -- you know, we\u2019re married 45 years now and we\u2019ve gotten along very well and\nthe kids are very attached to us, we\u2019re very attached to the kids and our grandchildren and\neverything and -- you asked me about how much I told the children. I mean now they\u2019re\ngrown men and I talk freely. I gave them the cop-copy of my show and everything. So I\ntold them, look at the tape and ask me, ask me. Really, ask me what you want. Because\nnow they know history and they know everything. They ask me and we talk like -- as I do\nwith you now and Max, too. Max is our little nine year old grandson, Harry\u2019s and\nCheryl\u2019s boy. And I -- I tell him, I say, \u201cYou know why I have this number? Because I\nwas -- you know, I was in a concentration camp during the war, you know, when -- when\nI was in Europe.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I know all about it.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, any time you want to\nknow more about that, you ask me and I\u2019Il tell you.\u201d In other words, I always leave the\ndoor open, you see. Th-The kids, they know everything, because I am very free to talk\nabout it. I don\u2019t cry, I don\u2019t break down, in the sense as other people get terribly\nemotionally disturbed. That was a part of my life and as I think I told you before, I was so\nlucky to come here and to be a young girl in America, you know? I was just so lucky.\nAnd -- and a lot of people who came, who weren\u2019t that much older, maybe 10 years\nolder, they already had to go to work and they already had to struggle, they could never\ngo back to school, you see? Or maybe they came with a child and it was dif -- I came a\nyoung girl, like a -- like a young horse, you know, ready to get out of the stable and run. I\nwas just like that, you know? I was like an eager beaver, I was willing and ready and\neverything was a lovely, nicest experience. Even if 1t wasn\u2019t so nice, I thought was great.\nEverything I did. Everything -- every summer camp, every baby-sitting, every this and\nthat on the other, everything was wonderful, cause was a new experience, you see? And it\nreally took me away from -- not that it took me away, it was something I didn\u2019t yet\nexperience, you know? I came here, I hadn\u2019t lived yet, so everything that I lived was\ngreat. And it -- in true fashion, it -- it really was. I mean it was not an exaggeration\nbecause all these things that happened to me, everything was sort of by chance, people --\nyou know, I got a job to support myself by working in the ORT. I didn\u2019t look for it, they\nlooked for it. I got a job to teach in Indiana, I didn\u2019t look for that. You know, you know,\nyou see what I mean? Every time I do something th -- I was asked to do it or something\nand it turned out a fantastic experience, so that\u2019s fine.",
        "A: Yes, I went back w -- twice. Once with Victor, to show him around and -- by which\ntime, I wasn\u2019t so eager any more to go the route of -- of nostalgia or anything. I -- \u2019m\nvery much interested -- I love Ch-Chopin, Frederick Chopin\u2019s music and I did some\ninterpret -- translating for Chopin biographies. So we traveled the Chopin route, that was\none aspect. We went wherever he was born -- where he was born, where he live, where\nthe concerts were and so on. That was one route. The second was to go to my hometown\nand visit with the old friends of my parents. And then we went to Auschwitz, of course.\nWe went to visit the camps, Shellneetsa and Mioufka. Mioufka does not exist, they\u2019re\nhousing projects now. And Shellneetsa is back to the firing range. They still -- now they\nput it back into a firing range. That was a very touching experience, going through my\nhometown with Victor. But you see, I was already with Victor, so that was an -- I was\nalready in another frame of mind. Then, of course, we went to Auschwitz and while\nthere, w-we also went to Vialeetchka, which is a salt mine. They said all the salt mine in\nEurope and they take you down on a tour. From the 11th century, all the way below, and\nI -- so | -- there was a combination and we went to Zarchoparna to visit the reserve. In\nother words, it wasn\u2019t all Auschwitz, you see? It wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t all Auschwitz and it\nwasn\u2019t all Shellneetsa. Sure, we went to Shellneetsa, th-the -- the -- the taxi driver that\ntook us there and we got there, it was after a rain, was such big potholes and he was\ndriving into the camp and I said, \u201cDon\u2019t go, you\u2019re going to ruin your taxi.\u201d He says,\n\u201cNo, no, you told me there was a camp here,\u201d Polish taxi driver, \u201cI\u2019m going to take you\nin there.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for a broken taxi.\u201d He insisted, he drove\nin and the old friends of my family\u2019s granddaughter, she was a young woman, 25, she\ntook us there, we walked around. There was nothing except that little brook where I\nremember people used to wash themselves in. And she told me, now it\u2019s back --\nShellneetsa is back to a shooting range. And the camp -- then we went to Mioufka. And\nabsolutely nothing. I mean, it\u2019s another world. Modern buildings and -- and the -- the bus\nruns through there and so on. So that\u2019s it. And the old factory was converted to trucks,\nthey do trucks. Star -- you know like Ford, Chevrolet, Star is the name, because\nStarachowice is the name of the town, so they named the trucks -- pickup trucks and\nsuch, that\u2019s -- the production was -- after the Russians -- by the way, the Russians\ndismantled the factory and took all this to Russia. And when it was rebuilt, 1t was rebuilt\nas a auto plant. So they do cars, th-the trucks. So that\u2019s the -- so nothing remained of that,\nyou see? So, as they say, you can\u2019t go home again? You see, but the old ladies, they were\nvery -- I have pictures from that trip. None of them are alive any more. Of course, this\nwas in 1980. So that was one trip and the second was as an interpreter for the Holocaust\nMemorial Museum for -- when the archives were being released, f -- actually, that was\nthe -- the negotiations for release of the archives, so I did that and that -- I went without\nVictor. And that was very interesting.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Okay, Pll tell you quickly about what happened. When Victor and I were in Poland in\n1980, we went to visit the Pole -- the Jewish cemetery and it was in horrible condition.\nYou know, the Germans have removed a lot of tombstones and made them for a -- for\nsidewalks, but -- but we found -- and I have pictures to prove it, we took -- Victor took\nmany pictures, houses were being built on the half of the cemetery. Well, I came back\nand I made a very big to-do about that. We meet once a year -- the Starachowice people,\nwe meet in New York, as they do everywhere, for the so-called Yurtside, which is\nOctober 27, thereabouts, we meet. So, the prayer is said for the dead and then we discuss.\nSo when I came back in 1980, with the pictures, I send the pictures to Israel and I said -- I\ngave the pictures here, in st -- and I told them, we\u2019ve got to do something, because there\nis still more building going on and we will lose that one last vestige of any -- anything\nthat shows that there was Jewish life there. We must do something. And -- I\u2019m sorry to\ntell you, that not everybody was on the same opinion. I was highly criticized. I was\nhighly criticized that I would have the nerve to say that we should pour in thousands of\ndollars for people who wouldn\u2019t care one way or another out there -- that they would ruin\nit anyhow. But there were other people who saw the problem otherwise and it took quite\na number of years to get around to the fact that we could do it. Those that will want to do\nit, should do it and not to have the naysayers negate this project. I personally have\nnobody in that cemetery. You know, w-we don\u2019t have anybody there, however, I kept\nsaying, \u201cHow would ever -- how would anybody ever know that there was a Jewish\ncommunity, except for that piece of a cemetery? Whatever is there, let us save it. Let us\nsave it.\u201d We -- so, not long ago, we got together honestly and truly, because in Israel,\nthey found somebody who goes to Poland to restore the cemeteries. First of all, I was\ninstrumental in registering it. Here, in New York, a good 15 -- 10 years ago, with a\nJewish agency, that had a list of Jewish cemeteries to be protected. They could not do\nanything about it, but just put it on a list of historic what do you call -- his-his-historic\nsites. So, maybe eight years ago, the Polish government -- Polish government put up a\nsign, historic -- okay, fine, historic area, what-whatever. Something was already done.\nThen we got, as the expression goes -- got on the stick. I collected money here, we made\na -- you know, personal, everything personal. Got on the phone, I had a list. People who -\n- whom I knew, who already expressed their opinion and great criticism, I didn\u2019t call. I\ncalled people -- I started from myself, I told everybody I gave so many hundreds of\ndollars, give me what you want, I don\u2019t mind. Send me a check, it should be mailed out --\nmade out to such and such -- Jewish projects or such. I send a few thousand dollars to\nIsrael. Canada send a few thousand dollars to Israel. Israel connected a few thou --\ncollected a few thousand dollars. Now the cemetery\u2019s a -- protected by a very beautifully\ndesigned iron fence with a beautiful gate. The sign 1s there, says this is to be preserved.\nNo more buildings could be built. The cemetery was a terrible place to see, whatever was\nleft. Stones were overturned, garbage was thrown on it. Gr -- Growth -- overgrowth of\ngreenery. First, the people who went from Israel to Poland arranged for people --\ncaretakers to clean it up. Then, a Mr. Yarley from Israel, who 1s also a -- restored already\na Jewish cemetery in Tomashavma Sovietski -- went to Starachowice, contacted people\nwho are artists, this -- the tombstones were righted, the lettering was restored, the place\nwas Cleaned up. Now it\u2019s behind a beautiful fence, now we have people who will be paid\nmonthly or y -- annually. Th-The person who is going to do it is a young artist. He\u2019s a\nsculptor and he\u2019s too thrilled to have this job of caretaker. And there is even going to be a\nbook put out, with pictures, which -- I just had a letter from Israel. But I feel very proud\nof it, because the few years that we didn\u2019t do anything, we almost lost the project and the\nreason was that -- part of it was that I -- I didn\u2019t want to create bad feelings and I -- I just\nlet it -- ya -- so, when I first brought up and I was very highly criticized. They say, \u201cI\u2019m\nsurprised at you Renia, that you should t-talk about it. We don\u2019t want to pour money in\nthere. They going to ruin it,\u201d and all this stuff and I -- I -- I just couldn\u2019t fight it, but I\nshould have, but I didn\u2019t, but anyhow, cooler heads prevailed and we decided to work\nwith the people who are willing and who are -- wh-who don\u2019t look at it that way. Now,\nwe have a beautifully restored cemetery, it\u2019s registered with the Polish government, it\u2019s\nregistered in the -- in America, which I did with another lady, in New York, when we\nregistered with this Rabbi Hyatt was his name, when the project was first started, we\nwere very lucky to get in our name on that list. I don\u2019t mean my name, but the -- the\ncommunity\u2019s cemetery. I\u2019m very proud of that accomplishment because as I said, having\nlost my parents in -- and family in a way that I never knew how they perished or where\nthey perished, that little bit of the Jewish life that was left under that soil, should really be\nhonored and preserved and I don\u2019t care if it takes money or if -- whatever. If they ruin it,\nlet\u2019s pay again an-an-and keep it up. Of course now it would not -- there will be no more\nbuildings. That\u2019s for sure because you can\u2019t press on the -- on -- on the -- on the iron\ngates. And the design was approved, who had approved it here, architectural designs. So\nit\u2019s really worth -- it -- I -- it makes me feel so good and you know, I had the money in no\ntime. As soon as I called up, everybody says, \u201cYes, of course.\u201d I -- I think I send two -- I\nsend the check twice, the first phone calls, I had one envelope with checks and then the\nsecond envelope. And before I know -- I mean it was 0 -- it was nothing. Of course I\nknew whom I should call and whom I shouldn\u2019t call and likewise in Israel. So there are\npeople that -- that -- my friend in Israel wrote me, one of them got up and made an awful\nrow about how dare you. The same thing. How dare you want money for this thing when\nthey not going to respect it. But I do know it was an important thing to do. I\u2019m very glad\nI got involved in it, even though I really felt that it was going to come with a fight. It\ndidn\u2019t come with a fight, because once we eliminated the naysayers, the coast was clear.\nAnd money -- it\u2019s only money, so -- you see, this is how it turned out and I\u2019m very\npleased about it and if there is a book, I might show you someday. I don\u2019t have it, but he\nsaid -- they told me in Israel that there will be a book, so --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Sure. First, the thing I told you -- first let me give you the number. The number is A\nand then it\u2019s 14178. As I told you when they were tattooing us, we lined up, my sisters\nlined up wi -- I lined up according to age. So my oldest sister Hanya or Anna, her number\nis A14176, Kris, the middle one, has 77 and I have 14178. As you could see, there is an\nA letter preceding the number and a lot of people ask me, \u201cWhy is there a letter?\u201d Th-th -\n- you see, they ran out of numbers and they had to start a second -- in Auschwitz., they\nstart a s -- what do you call it -- d -- a -- s-s-s -- a serial, an second serial and this 1s -- this\nis why there\u2019s A. You know, there was a number like this before, 14178, but the A is --\nyeah. And also, you know, it\u2019s very easy now to tell, that this is from the later numbers.\nYou see, as I told you, we came to Auschwitz when the Russian offensive was nearing,\nmeaning it was already late in the war. So now -- and anybody who is knowledgeable,\nwhen they see A, they know -- they can place me, so to say. To know that I wasn\u2019t there\nin 1942 or something like that, when the original people came, you see? And as I told\nyou, I\u2019m never, ever ashamed of it. I never want to remove it and I had an offer many\ntimes. I knew a plastic surgeon. In fact, when I had the job in the summer -- in a -- as a\ngoverness to a child in -- one summer, I was still in high school. He thought that I would\nbe afraid I wil -- can\u2019t afford it, so he said, \u201cPll remove your number and I won\u2019t charge\nyou anything.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I have not interest.\u201d He said, \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t charge you. You\ndon\u2019t need it.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t need it, but I -- it doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\u2019 Was a Jewish doctor.\nI was a governess to his child in the summer. I went with the wife to a hotel in the\nCatskills and I was, you know, I was the baby-sitter. And he didn\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t\nremove it, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t, I go to my grave with it.",
        "A: Well no, it\u2019s really nice of you to have put in all this time. I know it\u2019s an -- a big\neffort. And I don\u2019t mind talking about my experiences and I don\u2019t mind pointed questions\neither and it\u2019s a long interview. I know I\u2019ve worn you out. My voice is going, too. But no\n-- I\u2019m very glad to share this and to have it for posterity. For whatever reason. Certainly I\nho -- if I have a copy, Ill be very happy to give it to my kids, even though they do know\nthe story pretty well by now. Because in bits and pieces they found out, as they asked.\nAgain -- as they asked, you see? So I really thank you. That\u2019s very nice of you. Thank\nyou.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nConclusion of Interview\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "Answer: Certain-Certainly, yes. Yeah, well of course you can guide the interview\nhowever you wish, because I -- I don\u2019t mind if you stop me, if you don\u2019t stop, if you just\nlet the narrative go. Either way you decide is fine with me. Coming back to Berlin,\nperhaps it would be good to mention the years again, so that we have it within a certain\nframework. I arrived in the displaced person\u2019s camp in Berlin, in the early part of 1946,\nprobably around March or so, in the company -- actually my sister, Kris was married to\nMiles Lehrman at that time and they were my guardians. So the three of us arrived in\nBerlin, in the DP camp, which was located in the American sector. Now, this is 1946, the\nwar is over not quite a year yet. And Berlin is now divided into four sectors. One is the\nAmerican, in which the DP camp was located. One is the British, one is the French and\none is the Russian. Now, a lot of people do not understand the concept of a DP camp and\nthey say, \u201cWell,\u201d that you were in concentration camp and with barbed wires and, \u201cWas\nthis another one like it?\u201d Well, obviously a DP camp was not a camp surrounded by\nbarbed wire. It was an area designated for gathering up the people who were now shifting\n-- the people who were moving from place to place for all kinds of reasons. And it was\njust an area where there were barracks for people to -- to -- to -- to live in. Everybody had\na room in a barrack. It was very, very decent. There was a -- a -- a mess hall, where\npeople went for lunch -- breakfast, lunch and dinner. There was an area which was set\naside for -- for dancing, for there wer -- they had dances. And there was the school, of\ncourse to which I went. That was a building separate from the others. We even had our\nown dining room, because a lot of the children, including myself, were highly\nundernourished. We have never yet gotten our development, fall into the -- the range of\ndevel -- of physical development, so that we actually had better food than -- not better,\nbut probably more substantial, including chocolate. Pll always remember that, including\nchocolate. They had bars of chocolate for the children all the time. Well anyhow, Berlin\nitself, the city itself, was like any other post-war city, parts of it were bombed out\nhorribly, parts of it were not bombed. And the sector -- the particular sector always\nreflected the occupier. In other words, in the Russian sector, it was very, very difficult to\nbe around, because we were taught -- even the kids in school, we used to go on -- on\nthese outings and we used to go to the theater with the class and so on. We were told we\ncan go very freely to the three sectors. One, the American, the British and the French, but\nonce you go into the Russian sector, you really -- 1f you have to, absolutely -- and\nsometimes we did have to, because the -- all city -- Berlin city, that had all the theaters,\nwas within the Russian sector, so that you really had to just mind your surroundings. The\nRussian soldiers were always asking for IDs and such. The presence of the four occupiers\nwas very visible. You could always see American soldiers, in Jeeps, on foot, in the\nAmerican sector. You could always see the British in uniform, all over. You could\nalways see the French, so that Berlin, which is a German city -- and 1t was way before it\nwas divided into south and west, we\u2019re now talking at the period of time when I was\nthere, which was from about March \u201846, til the end of January or so, in 1947. And the\ncity was vibrant, but it was first really emerging from the horror of war, which you could\nsee. I have pictures, as I mentioned before, where the -- the famous church on\nCoffersendam is all in rubble and I\u2019m standing in front of it and I have a picture with it.\nSo that was the -- that was the reality of Berlin. It was not what you would call a German\ncity, as such, because German presence was -- if at all -- little visible to the naked eye.",
        "A: Well. I was thrilled, I was absolutely thrilled, because you know, to me -- I did not\nknow American history, but I just learned, during the war, that America was this great,\nfantastic country and President Roosevelt was God. And that -- that is all I knew at -- at\nthat time. And of course seeing Americans in uniform was so reassuring. Having seen\nGerman uniforms around me for the duration of the war and fearing a uniform, even\nwhen I saw it from 10 blocks away, shaking in my sh -- boots, this feeling now, of -- of\nseeing these friendly Americans, you know, they were sort of a little boisterous and they\nwere smiling. And -- and you know, the idea of just passing somebody in the street and\nsomebody smiling to you, didn\u2019t say anything to him, he didn\u2019t say anything to you, they\njust passes you by and he smiles. Well, that was a -- that was a sort of a healing kind of a\nfee-feeling. You know, I -- I'll be talking in rhymes, soon. The fact that my idea of the\nuniform, don\u2019t forget I was still a young girl, my idea of the uniform was always\nconnected with fear, always connected with fear. I thought that I would probably go to\nmy grave, sh-shaking over a military person, which of course is not the case, I mean,\nbecause you know, once you get over the original fear. So, to answer your question, yes,\nI was absolutely thrilled to see them.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I'll tell you, as a matter of fact, you know, I have never seen black people before\nin my life, because Poland was basically a white country and of course, predominantly\nCatholic. And then, being in camps and so on, I -- I\u2019ve -- ve met people -- Europeans,\nonly. Whether they were Greek or Italian, whoever, but I have never seen a -- a black\nperson until I was in -- in Germany. And my first black person was a American soldier.\nAnd I was absolutely fascinated, because he again had that smiley face, you see, he again,\nlike the others, you know? He didn\u2019t know me, I didn\u2019t know him. I just saw this -- this\nman, this black man in a -- in a American uniform, with a big smile. And of course that --\nthat was totally disarming and I -- I always remember that, because when I came to\nAmerica, of course, then I realized that this a multi-cultural country and multi-racial and\ncertainly not the kind of background that I came with, where it was predominantly\nCatholic and a min-minority being Jewish, so that it didn\u2019t compare and that was another\nsort of eye opening experience.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: All right. Well, as I told you, we -- I -- Miles Lehrman and Kris Lehrman were my\nguardians. Miles had a -- I think I mentioned it in the other tapes, but Ill repeat it just to\ngive it context. He had an old aunt living in Manhattan on the Lower East Side. She sent\nout papers for him, but wherever he went, his wife went and then I went. As I was saying,\nI was the fifth wheel, but they didn\u2019t think so. But, in any case, he received papers to go\nto America for the three of us. Now, in those days, because we were registered in the DP\ncamp, we were sent to an American agency in Berlin, which was in the American sector.\nWhether it was a consulate or the embassy, I couldn\u2019t tell, but I do know that we were\nfingerprinted there. That we were f-fully registered, our visas were processed. In other\nwords, our papers were completed at that spot. From there we were given a date when we\nshould go to Bremenhaven, where we are going to meet a ship, which is going to take us\nto America. So, we left Berlin for Bremenhaven, and I think we stayed in Bremenhaven\ntwo to three days, because the ships that were taking the refugees to America were\nconverted military transport ships. And our ship was called Marine Perch and I couldn\u2019t\ntell you the exact date when we boarded the ship, but we did arrive in New York Harbor\non February 11th, 1947. And, I might add something that\u2019s -- that might be interesting. A\nlot of people ask me, \u201cOh, so you went to Ellis Island?\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t go to Ellis Island.\nEven though Ellis Island was still functioning as a whatever you call it, transfer point or\nwhatever, we were processed -- our papers were processed fully in Germany -- in Berlin,\nI mean, within the American embassy, let\u2019s say, or wit -- or consulate. So that when we\narrived in New York and these old folks were there, this old aunt, she was I think in her\nlate 80\u2019s with this old husband and they were waiting for us. We just presented our\nprocessed papers and we got off the boat and there we were in a taxi, going to the Lower\nEast Side. So, we have never been to Ellis Island. And I think that -- that might be of\ninterest, too.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Quite the opposite. You know, having been tattooed with a number, in -- in\nAuschwitz, this fingerprinting was like somebody was opening the gate for me. Because I\nknew that they are making sure that I will be secure, you see? However I -- that I --\nhowever I explain that, it absolutely had the utmost wonderful connotation. It had\nnothing to do with fear, it had everything to do with a sigh of relief. Finally, they will\nknow exactly who I am, because they did, you know, when I looked at my -- the -- that\ncard, the ship card which I -- well, that I still have. They have my height, my weight, my\n-- the color of my eyes, the color of my hair, the fact that I have a number. And of course\nI knew that -- that the fingerprints were there too, meaning they couldn\u2019t mistake me for\nanybody else. And I was going to America and that was fantastic.",
        "A: That\u2019s fine.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t know for sure, but let me just again put it in the context of things.\nThis was in Brooklyn. We moved to Brooklyn. We lived in Brooklyn -- we meaning\nMiles, Kris and I, we lived in Brooklyn and in those days you had to be assigned, when\nyou go -- went to high school, having come from the DP camp where the high school -- it\nwasn\u2019t a diploma, but a certificate that I was already of high school quality, so to say. In\nNew York City, in those days, high schools were what you call neighborhood high\nschools. In other words, you lived here and you were assigned to that high school. Well,\nin east New York, which is Brownsville, there was this high school, Thomas Jefferson\nHigh School, which was out of my so-called district, because I belonged in Tildon High\nSchool. But the Joint Distribution Committee advised me that I would belong -- I would\nfind my place better in Jefferson High School and they could see to it that I was allowed\nto go out of my district. It really wasn\u2019t so far out of the district, I mean, was maybe six\nor seven stops on the subway, you see. Jeffer -- Thomas Jefferson High School had a\nclass especially for refugee children. The reason being that there was a great influx of\nrefugees to Brooklyn in those years. When I arrived, I was really among the early\narrivals, except for a friend of mine who came as an orphan, by herself with a transport in\n1946, in September, I don\u2019t think anybody came to Jefferson before September or\nOctober of 1946, is when my friend -- I know, because she was there six month when I\narrived, and she was among those very first -- she did live -- she lived in the district, you\nsee? But anyhow, by the time I arrived, there was already a group formed that was called\n-- we were ca -- we weren\u2019t called refugees in -- it was called basic English, yes. It\u2019s sort\nof a --- well, euphemism, but it really wasn\u2019t far from the truth, because they did try to\naccommodate us to the English language in the first place, before they even tried to\nexpose us to the American culture. And as I mentioned before, the pres -- the principal of\nthat high school was Dr. Ludwig Karpen and he -- whether it was he who had the original\nidea, or whether by virtue of the great influx of these children, that class was formed, I\ncould not answer you this question. I only know that by the time I came to Jefferson, and\nthat probably was March or April, I met about -- there were about 30, maybe 35 of us in\nthat class. Now, how was the program arranged\u2019? The program was arranged that the first\nthing you did -- like you know, the -- wi -- they used to be called homeroom -- other\npeople had homeroom, you know, you came to class -- you came to high school and you\nhad homeroom, whatever that meant. We didn\u2019t have homeroom, we had basic English.\nWe used to meet with the head of the English department, her name was Miss Hay --\nMiss Agnes Hay. She was the one who was to be not only our guiding spirit, she was to\nbe our mother and father and surrogate everything. She -- and she was the type,\nextremely warm and outgoing and soft, you know, she didn\u2019t have any of that martinet\nkind of personality, she was a rather soft spoken woman. And, so the in gathering of\nthese different children -- the ages first of all were different. They were something --\nanywhere between 14 and -- and -- let\u2019s say 19. Some of them were 19 and didn\u2019t -- and\nbelonged to -- with -- you know, missed the education. Some of them were 17 and had a\nlot of education, more than the high school and so on. So all this had to be sorted out.\nThis class was, 1n the first place, also an orientation class as to how the educational\nsystem works. Who is the principal and what are the rights of the students and what are -\n- what you cannot do and what you shouldn\u2019t do -- what is expected of you. And another\nfact was brought out -- that of course I wasn\u2019t used to, the teacher is your best friend, so\nyou can always go to the teacher and talk to -- about your problems. In Poland there was\nno such thing. The teacher was the teacher, the student was the student and after class,\nthat was it. Here we were taught in the basic class, you can always go, if you have a\nproblem at home, if you couldn\u2019t do your homework, if you don\u2019t understand, if you find\nit hard. Whatever problem, personal or otherwise, the teacher will help you. Obviously\nthe teacher was not going to be the only one. He was going to be the one who was going\nto direct us -- direct us to other people who were also in place. You see, everything was\nvery subtle. I didn\u2019t understand a lot of it, but it -- it seemed like paradise. But obviously\nthere was a lot of planning put into it. For example, lunch was 25 cents. Now, you could\nnot make a child -- they want -- not every child could afford 25 cents to have lunch, from\nthe refugee children. They wanted us to have a free meal, but you could not make a child\nfeel inferior for not having to -- a quarter for the -- for the meal. We were given tokens\nthe size of a quarter and I remember the ladies name was Miss Frankel, or Mrs. Frankel\nor Mrs. Frank, something like this. She was Dr. Karpen\u2019s personal secretary. And all you\nhave to do it once a week goes to Miss -- go to Miss Frankel, or Frank. She s -- handed\nyou a little envelope, nobody knew what was in the envelope. And when you went on\nline in the school cafeteria, you handed in that token that looked like a quarter and no\nchild next to you or behind you, in front of you, could see that you were actually not able\nto pay for your lunch, you see? Those were the subtle arrangements. I mean, you never,\never had to say why you went to see Miss Frankel. You just went into the office, you\nsaid, \u201cI want to see Miss Frankel.\u201d You came in, she saw you, she gave you that little\nenvelope, you see? Everything was done with such dignity. But of course this has\nnothing to do now with the education itself. The -- the basic English class was the\norientation class. As to behavior, as to proper conduct in school, as to what was in-\ninvolved in American education, how th -- what things were expected of you, what was\nabout higher education and we met every day. In fact, they were telling us -- Miss Hay\nwould call a child or two up front and say, \u201cHow do you greet people in Poland?\u201d You\nknow? Because I told her that I once re -- ex-explained in the subway when we had -- wh\n-- 1-in the class, when we had -- the subject came up, I said we were in the subway, Miles,\nKris and I and somebody we knew from Berlin or from Poland, saw us in the subway and\ncame running over. He kissed Kris\u2019s hand and he kissed my hand and of course\neverybody in the subway gave us a -- I mean, people were astonished. So when we were\ntalking about proper greeting in basic English, I told Miss Hay how this thing happened\nand how peculiar that was in the subway. So those were the a -- the things that were\ndiscussed and that class also helped determine the level -- the lev -- the educational level\nof each child. So, for example, my English was rather poor, so I was put into -- in\naddition to basic English, which of course we also used to -- not memorize, but avail\nourselves of phrases -- of every day phrases, how you greet people, what you do when\nyou go to a supermar -- to the store. What do you do when you want to ask a question in\nthe street and so on. That was from basic English. But, to catch up with the English\nlanguage itself, I, for example, used to take two English classes at one time. Now, I was\nall -- by then I was already 17 and I was in a class with the 13 year olds, who were first\nentering high school, you see? Because that was my first eng -- the -- the -- the -- the\nEnglish course had to be covered, A to Z, four years. Now, as for other things, such as\nphysics or chemistry or math, we were tested on that and we were placed accordingly.\nSame went for history. Nobody was exempt from Civics, which was taught in those days,\nAmerican History, American Economics and obviously English and Speech. And the\nstrange thing was that after awhile, it really equalized, you know? That the people who\ndidn\u2019t have much background in English came up and people who had all this\nbackground in History, got on the same level with the others and we were not -- we were\nscattered in between different classes. We had to take foreign language and as I also\nmentioned, I took Hebrew as a foreign language, because I just came out of Hebrew\nschool and that was another bonanza for me, because Dr. Horowitz, who was the head of\nthe Hebrew department, and taught my class, was another source of -- not advice -- you\nsee, we\u2019re talking basically about Americanization, about acculturation. And I could tell\nyou, that from my viewpoint, Jefferson to me was the acculturation for -- for all times.\nThey saw our needs, they knew how to meet them. Everything was done with such\ndiscretion and with such dignity, that to this day I cannot -- absolutely cannot get over it.\nYou know, especially in the -- in -- in this more permissive time of welfare handouts and\nsuch, it was just a totally different scene and -- and aside from all of that, Jefferson was a\nvery, very good academic school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.\ninto American democracy could really be a shock. Because I mean, you can get up and\ntell jokes in the class and I had a -- a -- apropos of that I have tell a velly funny -- a very\nfunny thing I always -- this an anecdote, I always tell it. | had a Mr. Jaffe for -- he was a\nvery elegant little man, you know, with a vest and pinned up and really proper. And Mr.\nJaffe was sort of -- he liked being humorous, but to an ex -- to just with bor -- with --\nwith limits. And we had a sort of a -- a wise guy type of fellow in the classroom and\nevery now and then he would pipe out -- of course I was offended. I mean, how can you\nstop the class? But Mr. -- Mr. Jaffe once said to him, \u201cDon\u2019t be a wise guy. I threw out\nDanny Kaye from my class and I can throw you out any time.\u201d Now -- of course, Danny\nKaye did go to Jefferson High School, but way before I got there. But the -- because he\nlived in that area. But, basically, you see, I was not used to this total freedom; freedom of\nexpression, freedom of -- of -- of -- of the being what you want and associating with wh -\n- with whoever you wanted to associate with. And the basic English class was really you\n-- our introduction to democracy, on the very simple level. I -- we\u2019re not talking here\ntheories and big things, we are talking every day living, just like not kissing somebody\u2019s\nhand in the subway, is one of them, you know? And -- and being -- feeling free. Having a\npaper that doesn\u2019t look like everybody else\u2019s newspaper read in the subway, you could\ndo that. Didn\u2019t have to hide it -- you don\u2019t -- you know, you don\u2019t have to look behind\nyou or over your shoulder to see somebody spying on you, because this is not the type of\ncountry. And you\u2019re not going to be arrested by a policeman who will come and say,\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d And, \u201cShow me your ID.\u201d That can never happen here without cause.\nSo, this was part of the -- of that basic English, which was acculturation, introduction to\nAmerican democracy, but I -- I -- I am really -- it -- it isn\u2019t all that formal, you know. I\u2019m\njust giving you the overall idea, because it was really rather loosely presented to us, not\nas a rule, with a -- wi-with a question -- with an exclamation mark at the end. It was just\nsimply put.",
        "A: If [remember correctly, I don\u2019t think we did. Because, you see, first of all we assumed\nthat -- each one of us assumed -- one was Polish, one was Hungarian, one was French and\nwhatever it was, we knew we re -- I personally was not interested in any other stories. I\nknew everybody had a story to tell. I had plenty of stories to tell. I didn\u2019t want to live\nthose stories, I didn\u2019t want to hear the other stories. Besides, I didn\u2019t have the time. We\nwere kept so busy. We were kept -- don\u2019t forget, lang -- fa -- English was a foreign\nlanguage to us and we had to study subjects such as history and others. Economics,\nwhich was -- I never studied ec -- American economics, or economics at all in Poland. Or\nCivics. And this required a lot of work. Plus the fact that each one of us had some other\nobligation after school. You know, I think I mentioned it before, I lived with Miles and\nKris, I kept house, I shopped for food and so on. I also had a job in the ORT\norganization\u2019s office on Fifth Avenue, where I had to travel after school. And then I had\nto -- I -- I -- I did absolutely stupid things there, I did filing and you know, but again, this\nwas a kind of a job that they gave me because Dr. Karpen\u2019s wife was the head of the\noffice. She was the head of the ORT, American ORT organization. Her name was\nGertrude Karpen. And for me to earn this extra little money, I cannot imagine that I could\ndo any more then than file. But I was a filing clerk, I knew the alphabet. So that was fine.\nAnd all the other kids had obligations as well. Don\u2019t forget they were more or less in my\nshoes, so to say. They had either families and they also had to scramble around to do a\nlittle something to sustain themselves so that we basically compared notes pertaining to\nthe education and to the school. And also, we got to be friendly with the Jewish kids --\nJewish kids, a lot of Jewish kids from the area. That was a blue collar Jewish section in\nthose days. So we made wonderful friends among the Jewish kids who were normal, so\nto say. Amer -- Jewish American kids. So, all this really t-to just sum it up, didn\u2019t -- this\nlife in Jefferson did not fit with sitting there comparing notes, \u201cDid you go to Auschwitz?\nNo, I didn\u2019t go to Auschwitz, I went to Ravensbrick.\u201d That was past, that was water\nunder the bridge, you know? Here we were, all these things were required of us, we were\nall willing and as I also mentioned before, a lot of these kids became academicians. They\ntaught all over the United States, professorship here and professor -- and everybody --\none wa -- most of these kids went to college and graduated from college. So that you see,\nwe were more or less on that same level of -- of trying to get on with life in an -- this new\nway, excelling educationally. Find a place in this new world and who wants to talk about\nthis old stuff? You know, that was then and so this is basically -- for example, Miss Hay\nused to invite us to ca -- to tea. She was a sort of former -- I think she was Irish by -- by --\nfrom the fam -- anyhow, she used to invite us to tea, served beautifully, elegantly, with\nbeautiful china cups. Not all of u -- them, but she had her favorites. So she had about four\nor five of us and we used to go to tea in her house, properly served with the napkins and\nthe napkin rings and it was fantastic. You see, now those are all these extra things that\nthese teachers went out of their way to -- to -- to -- to -- to do for us. But also, I might\nadd, since I was so friendly with Miss Hay for all those years after -- til af -- til the time\nshe died, she told me, \u201cYou know, Regina, I never, ever had a class like yours after your\nclass left -- after your class graduate.\u201d She said it so many times and that is a fact,\nbecause this was a very special group and -- and I must tell you that -- that there must\nhave been some kind of a spirit in these kids, for everybody to be so -- not just winning, I\nmean they -- everybody went out of his way to -- to accommodate us, to do for us, to -- to\nfind us jobs. To -- to -- so this 1s really -- this was a wh -- what is called a lucky break.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, everything was surprising, for the reason that I, for example, didn\u2019t know that\nthe -- that the eastern part of Poland was evacuated before the -- before German\noccupation -- no, I -- I\u2019m not expressing it correctly. After Germ -- after the Germans\noccupied Poland, Stalin -- th-th-the Russians occupied eastern Poland. I knew that, but I\ndid not realize that a lot of the natives -- not a lot, the majority of the natives, Jews or\nChristians were evacuated deep into Russia. I only found out about it in Berlin when\npeople came to live in the DP camp, having come from Russia. \u201cWhat do you mean from\nRussia? You speak Polish. You come from Voofe, you come from Vilna, you come --\nhow did you?\u201d Well, they came out of Russia because they were evacuated en masse.\nApparently, the Soviets were planning to -- to get rid of the native population in order to -\n- to -- to resettle it with their own, or however. So you see, that was the first thing that -- I\nstarted finding out these things. Was very easy, of course, to -- to -- to read books. I\nstarted also taking courses that pertained to -- to -- to history that -- that wasn\u2019t -- you\nknow, like I knew everything after the first war, I knew all that stuff. But after that, I\ndidn\u2019t know much, you know. So I started finding out. And then I found out that the\nPolish government -- there was a Polish government in exile, in -- in -- in England during\nthe war. And then I started finding out all the other things, the atrocities of the Russians.\nAnd being -- I\u2019m always very curious about things and I know how to get -- how to find\nthings in books, I always knew that, so it was always very easy, even if I studied\nsomething else. I did take history courses in college and European political theory and all\nthis. I took it, but while I was doing my homework, I always knew how to go after that\none s -- one something that I just discovered. For example, the -- the Cutting Forest\nmassacre I just discovered. I went to look for it, I found it, you know. And -- and -- and\nlittle by little, the -- the -- the invasion -- the Normandy invasion, the -- the Pearl Harbor.\nI did not know those things. I did not know about Pearl Harbor. I mean, I knew it, but it\nwas so sketchy, it was just an id -- something I knew, but -- so -- and -- and how -- how\nthe allies cooperate, I knew how to find it and of course I started reading papers. In fact,\nin Brooklyn College, the tea -- the political science teacher told us -- she rec -- she\nexpected every one of us to read the New York Times, every day. And she didn\u2019t mean in\na jokingly and she said, \u201cAnother thing, before the course is over, every one of us has to\nread the American constitution 12 times.\u201d Now, I am not talking about refugee children, I\nam talking about the regular course in Political Science. Those were her two\nrequirements. One was you must read it 12 times to be able to understand it and before\nthe course 1s over, you will have to know it sideways and upside down. And you have to\nread the New York Times every day. And I did. So, I -- I -- I was always curious, you\nsee, I was always curious. All of a sudden I found out another detail about the war and\nthen another detail, then of course the Nuremberg trials, you know. That sort of opened a\nwhole -- a whole new field to me that -- that I really didn\u2019t know. And then of course I\ndidn\u2019t know too much about Italy, Fascist Italy and I wanted to find out about that. And I\n-- so, little by little the puzzle got put together, because I searched, I really searched and I\n-- and I filled it in and --",
        "A: Well, you know, the idea of war, to me, when I -- when I -- when -- when second war\nfirst started, was that this was just a military engagement, you know, that soldiers fight\nand soldiers get killed. And of course all this was based on the first war, not personal\nexperience, but my knowledge of the first war, from books or from my parents, who lived\nthrough the first war. Second war was a totally different thing, because it wasn\u2019t just that\nthey were bombing civilians, but it was -- 1t came to pass that they were exterminating\npeople for being Jewish. And that -- that was something that -- I mean, not only\nincomprehensible, but unbelievable and people wouldn\u2019t admit it and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve\nmentioned it in the other tapes, but I always talk about it. To this day, I had no idea what\nmy parents knew, how much they knew, what they knew, but I do know that they did\nhide a lot from us. In fact, they hid everything from us, because they nev -- I never knew\nthe truth of -- and I suspect that they knew a whole lot of things. Of the atrocities that\nwere going on. You know, my parents perished in the Holocaust, but even during the\nghetto years and all this, I am sure they knew a lot, because there were people coming\nand going and reporting what\u2019s happening here and there -- never, ever was I let in on\nwhat was happening. And of course I saw with my own eyes, plenty, so maybe they felt\nit\u2019s bad enough for a child to see and experience here, but not yet to live with the fear of\nwhat is really happening somewhere else, which is probably not true. That was the\nattitude. It couldn\u2019t be true, because such a thing couldn\u2019t be true, you know, that you\ntake groups of people and you burn them or you gas them. So that\u2019s just gossip and\nduring the war, there\u2019s so much gossip, so why burden a child with this type of talk? So\nyou see, my idea of -- of war, after 1t was o -- after the second war was all over, was\nreally that it brought out the beast in the human being. It had nothing to do with land, you\nknow, reclaiming your land one way or another. It was nothing to do with fighting for the\n-- for your culture or for your moral standards. It was just the opposite. It was just a\nbeastly expression of a human nature, which unfortunately fell within the new technology\nand it found it\u2019s expression in annihilating by the youth of new technology and not the\narmed conflict of countries, but of just people being eliminated. So this was basically my\nunderstanding of -- of -- you know, after all was said and done and I start -- started\nreading history, it go -- just confirmed what I have already experienced, that this was not\na war like any other war. That I knew Napoleonic wars and Franco -- the German war\nand this war and that war, that -- those were wars that th -- the Crimean war -- this war\nwas nothing like it and of course the -- having confirmed it by studies, further studies, it -\n- it just reinforced by so many more ho-horrendous details of things that I really didn\u2019t\nknow. History f -- the -- that I got -- the history of the second war, that I got out of books,\nreally built on my own understanding. So it sort of rounded it out and I came away with -\n- precisely with the same concept as I had originally, before I read all the books and filled\nin the gaps, you see.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t mourn very inwardly, and of course --",
        "A: Yes. First of all, we observe the Yourtside. This is -- Yourtside is the -- you know, the\ncommemoration of the people who passed on on the day when they passed on. Obviously\nI could not have a date for the -- for the -- for the mourning -- official mourning. But I did\njoin the group of people from Starachowice who were in New York. And they\nestablished a Yourtside service and a -- a gathering of all the people from the hometown.\nWhy? Because -- I think it was in Israel that a day was picked for a Yourtside for all the\npeople from Starachowice, to be observed on the same day, meaning the day when the\ntown was cleared of Jews. And before -- because my father died in Auschwitz, sometimes\nin October, two years after my mother died with the owseedum -- with the -- when the\ntown was liquidated, we decided that -- I decided -- everybody else decided that we still\nstick to this date, that\u2019s October 27th. So I light a candle all the time on October 27th and\nwe have annual gatherings of that Starachowice society. So we get together and prayers\nare said and in those days the group was much larger, I don\u2019t have to tell you. Kris and\nMiles, when they were in New York, they would go and prayers were said and then the\nmorning prayers were said and then there was coffee and cake and so on, a little\nsocializing. So we did that once a year. And so that was the official mourning, but of\ncourse, I missed my parents a whole lot. But you know, I was thinking about it. If I were\nstill in Poland, I probably would have missed them much more because they were -- they\nfit into the -- into the setting. Here, I was sort of on my own, you know? I had Kris and\nMiles, of course, but after they moved away, I was really on my own and I knew that I\nabsolutely cannot depend on having my mother help me out or my father help me out,\nyou see? I always missed them, you know, I always missed them. I grieved for the fact\nthat there was no cemetery that I could go to. That bothered me and it bothers me to this\nday. That I had -- if I had a place where I knew they were, I would -- of course in those\ndays, I couldn\u2019t take trips, but eventually I would get to that place. But mother went to\nTreblinka and father perished in Auschwitz, so where is the place? There is no place. And\nthe fact that we do observe October 27th -- I do, to this day, as the mourning for -- for my\nparents and for my hometown. And you know, here and there, we -- I donated money in\nIsrael to have the -- my parents name inscribed on a monument in the cem -- Jewish\ncemetery. Also in Canada, my sister showed me when we were in Canada just last year --\nand she showed me on the Jewish cemetery, there is a monument with names inscribed of\nthe Holocaust victims who perished in the Holocaust. And this was done by the\nsurvivors, SO my parents names [indecipherable]. I\u2019m just very glad about that. So we\nhave the name in Toronto -- my parent\u2019s name on the -- on the monument, and also in\nIsrael. So that is -- that I feel good about. And the fact, of course that the observance --\nthat we observe, with the -- with the commun -- the survivor\u2019s community, of whom\nthere\u2019s -- as you know, the ranks are thinning, so --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "A: Rage? Probably not. I am, by nature, very optimistic and I\u2019m sort of serious, but I --\nrage? No, that\u2019s not an expression of -- no. Things are more internalized with me, so that\nif anything, I grieved, you know, I think a lot. I think a lot, I mean, I probably, if I had a -\n- if I had a terrific problem, I would probably have sleepless nights, because my head\nwould be running and running and running. But that -- whenever -- I wouldn\u2019t go break a\nchair or hit somebody or -- or curse. I -- it\u2019s just in -- not in -- it\u2019s not my make-up, so to\nsay. I always wonder if that could be because I was the youngest and I was always\nspoiled, so I sort of -- you know, I was sort of singled out by my parents and oh, you\u2019re\nso good and you\u2019re so this, so may -- maybe that stayed with me. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t\nsay, but Ill tell you no, rage is -- rage at what was? No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Yes anger, but you know, vengeance -- first of all, vengeance doesn\u2019t accomplish\nanything. What was done was done and what you do now, as a vengeful act, does not\nundo what was done. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s a fact. Second 1s that if you are analytical and you\nreally follow the thread, you -- in my case, I could never accept the fact that what\nhappened was going to determine the entire course of my life, which I haven\u2019t lived yet.\nSo, you see, I -- probably that was a kind of a determination, not that I didn\u2019t have\nnightmares and -- and sleepless nights and all kinds of physical the -- th -- manifestations\nof an inner conflict. But on the outside, I most certainly did not dwell on any vengeance.\nI just felt that the Germans will probably eventually come around to understanding in\ntheir own way, what a horrible, horrible thing they did, that was unprecedented, that was\nunimaginable, that was beyond and -- above and beyond the human un -- human\nunderstanding, you know, that -- because, as I was saying before, this wasn\u2019t a war like\nthe other wars, like the Crimean war, like this war, there -- where there was shooting\nbetween soldiers and there was armistice and the war was over. This was something that I\nwas not going to allow to destroy my life, because my parents were -- my home was\ndestroyed, my parents were killed, we were lucky enough to survive. And -- and there\nwas life to be lived and -- and I wasn\u2019t going to worry about the Germans -- what was I\ngoing to take a gun and go to Germany and shoot somebody? On the other hand, what\nwas I going to do, sit home and brood and -- and ruin my life and get more nightmares\nand more -- I couldn\u2019t do that either. So thinking very logically and realistically, I\nimagined this is the conclusion I reached. And the fact that I really was very busy. I was\nvery busy, so that I rather took it as an excuse, you know, I'll think about it tomorrow.\nNot about my parents, but about the whole idea. And, as I told you before, that when I\nfinally got the -- the book knowledge about the war and put it all together, it did not\nchange my original understanding, which was personal and on a lower level. It just\nenhanced it. But my conclusion concerning the Germans was still the same. I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to get a gun and shoot them. I wasn\u2019t going to get myself sick, just immobilized by\n-- by the kind of fear I used to experience every single day of my life. I haven\u2019t lived yet.\nI wanted book knowledge, I wanted to have fun. I wanted to be a girl and go dancing and\ndo things and I wasn\u2019t going to allow that to f -- to -- to -- to -- to get in my way. And\nthat -- that is really how it was and -- and -- I -- I was grateful that my personality was\nsuch that it allowed me -- not to forget it, you don\u2019t ever forget it. You don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t\nforget anything, especially I don\u2019t forget anything. I mean, I have everything under a\nzipper in the back of the head. I have all kinds of things stored in there, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that I need to go around and curse God for what happened. Shoot the Germans for\nwhat happened. It already happened, so --",

Apparently they did not mean it the way I took it, because they\nmeant, if you\u2019re Catholic, maybe you\u2019d like to be with a Catholic girl, go together to\nmass. Or if you\u2019re Jewish, you might want to observe Yom Kippur when the others --\nthat was a very innocent question, but -- you see, in those days I was drunk on American\ndemocracy. You see, I felt that everything here was -- not that it was permissible, but all\nthose restrictions, all those qualifications, are you this or are you this or were you -- 1s\nyour father Jewish, or -- that all that didn\u2019t apply here, you see, so my shock was based\nmore on my misunderstanding of their -- of their real purpose. They wanted you to be\ncompatible with the person that you were going to be with. I took it on the other hand as\nan expression of something from the past, where I always had to say that I was Jewish,\nwhere I always -- you see?

        "A: Well, let me just tell you this. The program was run by the linguistics department. The\nstudents were all Air Force officers. The languages taught were Serbo-Croatian, there\nwas Polish, there was Russian. If I remember, Ukrainian possibly. Now, we had a\nsyllabus that we followed. We wrote our own textbook, with the head of the linguistics\ndepartment. And of course grammar was taught, Polish language you know, has\ndeclensions and conjugations, so there\u2019s plenty of grammar to learn, much more than\nthere is in the English language. But in order to make it more accessible to these people,\nwho were after all going to be stationed in a foreign country, where they would have to\ngo and buy a container of milk and then be on a bus and overhear a conversation of\npeople who are talking about wheat and baking bread, or whatever. Therefore, the\nconversation slot, that unit of time that was devoted to conversation, was to be as if you --\nfrom the teachers -- instructor\u2019s viewpoint, meaning myself, as if I was talking to\nsomebody n -- to another native, on any subject. Of course, I like to make it interesting.\nAs I probably mentioned, or maybe I didn\u2019t, I never, ever discussed the war -- the -- they\nknew I was Jewish, they knew I had a number, I was in Auschwitz, they knew I lost my\nparents. They knew th-the general information about me. They knew I came to Indiana\nsolely because I was given this job. And to make the conversations interesting, first of all\nI had a unit of time specifically designated for conversation and of course, now that I\u2019m a\ntranslator, this was the so-called Monterey rec -- Monterey system was -- Monterey,\nCalifornia had a language school and they were just developing this new idea, that\nlearning a language is best to -- to hear the music. You see, language is based on an\nintonation, so that if you are attuned to the music of the language, you will absorb it\nfaster than learning all the -- the -- the irregular verbs and the -- the -- the what --\nwhatever. So I was told to pick a subject, to tell them a story. Not in a simple language\nwhere I would have to go overboard finding simple. Simply as if I were telling anything\nto somebody else who 1s native, after which time, I should just have -- what do you think\n-- let\u2019s say I was talking about a goat that got lost, whatever, something like. What do\nyou think would happen after this was over? What would you think was -- would happen\nto that goat that got lost on the ro -- in the same pattern of speech which I delivered my\nlittle story. And they had to answer me, however ridiculous the answer was -- 1n their\nown way, for me to judge how much understanding of native -- of the native speech\npattern they had. And that was very interesting because I was free to pick subjects, you\nknow, so if it was something interesting that came up 1n school, I told them about that. If\nthere was something -- of course they knew that I was engaged to Victor and Victor was\nin -- in the -- in uniform and he used to come and visit me, so one day I told him a -- told\nthem about Victor and I wanted to double check whether they remember -- and they, you\nknow, so that was -- that was also a way of -- I had to report, you know, to the\ndepartment there -- the absorption level of the language. And I was told later -- of course\nI\u2019m in touch with these people, they\u2019re very nice people, especially one of them, through\nyears and years, we visit, we write. Anyhow, I was told that those were very good, fun\nthings to do. Because basically, that\u2019s what they had to do, they had to go behind the Iron\nCurtain and they had to be -- they were charge d\u2019 affairs for this and all kinds of other\nthings. And they had to deal with natives. And I apparently had yet, the natives music in\nthe -- in -- in the -- in the speech, so that that was worthwhile and I thought that was a\nvery good part of the -- of the program. Of course, that wasn\u2019t my idea, you know, that\nwas all included in the syllabus and decided by the linguistics department, because this\nwas done for all these other languages, you see, that were taught.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: You -- you mean stereotyped during the Cold War?",
        "A: Stereotyped during the Cold War?",
        "A: Well, not among the people that I came across with. First of all, you know, Poland\nwas never incorporated into Russia. They were a satellite country during the 50 years of\nRussian regime. The Poles were fiercely opposed -- by then I als -- also knew history,\nyou see? They were fiercely opposed to the Russian government for years and years and\nthere was no such thing as Poland being willingly in the satellite orbit. The people that I -\n- | live and de-dealt with -- I never came across an expression that the Poles are\nCommunists. You see, because basically they were not. The Poles were basically, fiercely\nindependent and they expected to be liberated, period, after the second war. But they\nwere not liberated, and that is -- of course it\u2019s all historical, convoluted chain of events,\nbetween Yalta and --and Stalin being who he was and -- and the Yalta agreement actually\nenslaved Poland for 50 years, but that\u2019s another story. The -- the point 1s that the people\nthat I knew never, ever held it against me that I repre -- I was representing some -- that\nthis was a Cold War and I was representing any kind of Communist type of thing,\nbecause basically, 1-1f I may just venture a guess, the reason that the American\ngovernment was interested in sending people in there, was to really determine, are they\nturning Communist or are they staying quietly, but -- but fighting it? And this 1s exactly\nhow it really was. And I -- I even knew it much later, when Victor and I went in 1980,\nwhen we went to Poland and I had friends and I was visiting. So one friend told me,\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak in the hotel room to your husband, about anything.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do we\nthink -- what do we wa -- what are going to --\u201d She says, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. There are\nmicrophones in the walls there. Don\u2019t speak to your friends, don\u2019t speak in the taxis,\ndon\u2019t speak --\u201d I mean, they put the fear of God in me, because what I knew and I was in\nIndiana was still true in 1980, before Solidarity, you see, that there was all pervasive\nCommunist -- well, what would you call it, a -- the -- the Communist grip on Poland was\nvery strong, but underneath, it wasn\u2019t, you see? This 1s how the warnings came. And --\nand I knew that when I was in Indiana, because the Cold War was -- this wasn\u2019t just the\n50\u2019s, so the war wasn\u2019t over even 10 years yet, you see. And -- and there was still hope\nmaybe Poland would sneak out from under, but of course it never did and then\nCzechoslovakia and all, so basically that was not at -- or -- an issue, ever. Not from\npeople who I dealt with, not from people whom I met and referred to me as Polish native,\nor whatever. Never, never.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I, for example, did not realize that the blacks were oppressed in this country. I\nreally didn\u2019t know it, I must admit. I knew that they were slaves at one time, that they\ncame on ships from Africa. I knew that they were freed by Lincoln. And I knew that there\nwas still discrimination in the south, because I knew that there was such a thing as\nbathrooms for blacks or whites, separately -- public bathrooms. And water fountains,\npublic water fountains, but no, I -- I really didn\u2019t see it, or maybe I didn\u2019t want to see it or\nmaybe -- you see, I just didn\u2019t know enough of -- of America in that sense, because I was\nstill circulating in another sphere, so to say. I was still in the academic world, you see?\nAnd I had no access, truly. I heard that there was an incident in Indiana once, but I -- wi-\nwith a person in my class, that we experienced discrimination in the restaurant, but I -- I\njust didn\u2019t feel that that was America, you know? I had an idea of America, ideal\nAmerica. So I -- even if I did see a -- a little expression of something or other, I didn\u2019t\ntake it as the expression of -- of America as I wanted to see it -- as I saw it. In fact, I saw\nit that way, because that\u2019s how I saw reality in those days.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t different from being Polish, 1t was different from where I came from.\nAnd that includes my war experiences in Germany and everything else, you see? Being\nPolish is something else. It\u2019s very much connected to my childhood and to very\nwonderful life with my parents and my family. That is what I mean by being Polish. But\nbeing European is what I was, really. Being European in the sense that I felt the brunt of\nGerman culture and I experienced the bestiality. So that was now part and parcel of\nEurope for me. And, though I know it wasn\u2019t, but it was, because that was my personal\nlife. So when I came here, and I told you I found out all these things, that you are free to\nread the paper and you are free to express yourself and you can get up and disagree with\nyour teacher in the classroom and all these things that you could do that were absolutely -\n- that they had no repercussions. That they were -- you weren\u2019t going to be shot or killed\nor sent in the prison, or whatever. That was -- it\u2019s a -- like a -- like an explosion of the\nmind, to me. It was not directly connected to my being Polish. It was connected to my\noverall background -- European background until I came here.",
        "A: Yes, I did.",
        "A: Yes, okay, let me start from the general and come to the specific. I came out of Europe\nfrom chaos. From everything being turned upside-down, from everything being torn up\nfor an idea that the Germans had of -- of -- the hedanfolk and -- and all that. And I came\nto America, I was intoxicated with this idea that this can never happen here. And all of a\nsudden, in the 60\u2019s, not that it in any way compared to Nazi Germany\u2019s planned and --\nand organized -- and -- and -- and -- and specified the -- horrible deeds. This was all --\nthis was all in flux, but I suspected that the culture, as I have come to understand it, was\nbeing torn apart by this kind of an expression, which I took to be the other extreme, you\nsee? Whereas the first extreme was the organization -- no, perfection of the Nazis, here\nyou had a total disruption of everything, without a central idea, nevertheless, disrupting.\nYou asked me how I did wi -- how the children -- yeah. I have -- since my husband was\nworking and I was sort of call -- the mother at home, I had the idea that I wanted my\nchildren to have self-discipline, and I stuck to it. Wi -- They knew they were loved, they\nknew they were -- they weren\u2019t indulged to a point, but everything was very logical. In\nother words, if I said to a child, \u201cYou know, you have to put on your shoes, these shoes\ntoday, because the radio said it\u2019s going to be stormy later.\u201d Whatever quote unquote\norder I gave the child, there was always, immediately, why. I always explained why you\nneed to do it, why you must do it. You went to a restaurant, there are other people there,\nyou cannot be disruptive, you cannot be loud, you cannot be in and in and under the\ntable. We went to a hotel -- French hotel in the Catskills. People used to get dressed for\ndinner. The children had to be dressed for dinner, with their little bow tie. They knew it.\nCame dinner time, they had to be dressed, that was it. Otherwise we don\u2019t go there. If you\nwant to go there, you like it there? Yes, I do. Well, if you do, then you have to do what 1s\nexpected of you. And I wasn\u2019t shy about punishing. And I punished the child if he\ndisobeyed and the consequences were bad. I would take away the bicycle for a week, you\ncan\u2019t ride the bicycle for a week, you see? You were supposed to do other -- something\nor other, that was canceled. So that eventually the discipline -- our younger son Paul\nalways tells me, cause he\u2019s a free spirit, he says, \u201cYou know, that was really very good.\u201d\nAlso the fact that the homework, when they were submitting homework, the -- public\nschool. I would tear up the homework if I thought it was messy. You know, it was a\nhomework assignment, a page and a half, so he -- 10 o\u2019clock at night he scribbles out the\nhomework and it looks like a dog wrote it. So I would say no, I was a teacher once, too. I\nwould not accept homework looked like that. Even if 1t was the best homework in the\nworld, the smartest, you don\u2019t hand in anything that looks so sloppy. Was torn up, he had\nto write it again. And there was always the reason, you see? There was always a reason\nfor doing things. It wasn\u2019t the imperial, \u201cI said so.\u201d It sounded imperial to the child, but\nhe had no -- and because I was with the children most of the time, what I said, went. And\nthe fact is that they had many, many friends and they went to school next door, so every\nchild was allowed to bring a friend for lunch. And I had assignments, Wednesday was\nMelanie and Tuesday was Willy Popper and everyb -- you know, so there were -- the\nhouse was always open to friends, always. And that -- I told you, by appointment, every\nWednesday belonged to another kid that they brought from school. Black kids, white\nkids, Jewish kids, any kids that they chose to bring. So they never felt deprived of\nsomething that they wanted to do. They knew that we are there and they knew that we are\nvery reasonable. You see, that we don\u2019t order things without a basis for ordering it. And\nto this day, my older son, who now has children, you know, he disciplines the older -- the\nboy -- the older boy, the nine year old. And apparently something stayed with him,\nbecause I do believe in self-discipline. I believe that you know you have to discipline\nyour mind to -- to -- for it to find the expression in your daily living. You know, if you\nhave to do homework, you have to do it. If it\u2019s already too late, you still have to do it.\nYou have to do it, you have to be on the job at nine o\u2019clock. Can\u2019t be there five after\nnine, you know? If somebody expects you to do something, it has to be done. This is self-\ndiscipline and the parent isn\u2019t around forever to tell you so. If it\u2019s ingrained, it stays.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well -- well, we met in a very casual way, that there was most -- most ordinary way. I\nused to live, as I told you, when Kris and Miles moves aw -- to Jersey, I used to live with\ndifferent families and then I lived with another family in Brooklyn, in Brighton Beach\nand the person -- th-th-th -- it\u2019s a friend, my fr -- sh-she was our friend from Poland, she\nwas there and her father and I lived with her and her father. She went to Brooklyn\nCollege at night for courses, psychology, this and the other thing. And she had a friend\nwho was a secretary to Victor\u2019s father. Victor\u2019s family had a textile business. So one day,\nthe secretary in the office told Victor that she is going to Brooklyn College to see -- he\ngraduated from Brooklyn College, but way before. He graduated in 1949, when I was\nfirst graduating from high school. Anyhow, so she said, there is this fantastic course she\nis taking and they are going to show a certain film, if he wants to go. So he went with her,\nhe drove her to Brooklyn College and after the film was shown, where this friend of mine\nwas, Victor drove both ladies home. So he first dropped off this one woman, Cecile and\nthen he came to drop off Fella. And Fella said to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in and say\nhello? I have -- my father is there, I have a friend living with us.\u201d So he came in and there\nI was. I didn\u2019t look for him, I didn\u2019t chase him. He was -- I was there and he walked in.\nAnd so we got to know each other. And I used to have a lot of friends, male friends, boy\nfriends. I used to love dancing, so I used to go dancing with one boyfriend. I had all\nkinds, really. I had a -- a rogue\u2019s gallery album full of these guys. And then Victor\nwalked in and then he lived not very far from that. So, every now and then we used to\nmeet. We went to a -- to the opera, we went to -- his family had a subscription to the\nMetropolitan, so we -- we had tickets. Anyhow, we -- we did a lot of cultural things, we\nwent out to dinner and -- he knew about me, I mean as much as -- as he want -- as --\nagain, like the way it happened with the children. I told him some and I told him, if\nyou\u2019re interested in anything else, tell me and I\u2019Il tell you. I -- not going to sit here, bore\nyou about things that -- 1f you want to know, I'll tell you anything. Well, this is how it\nhappened. And then he was drafted in 1950, in the Korean war, he was drafted and went\nto -- upstate to Watertown. And that same year I went to Indiana. So he started coming --\nwe used to meet in New York. He started coming there or we would meet in New York\nand then we got engaged and when I graduated, he came for the graduation and then we\ngot married, in New York. Of course we came back to New York to get married.",
        "A: I was really -- I mean -- as far for -- I was worried about him, of course, but I just\ncouldn\u2019t understand, in those days, I just -- because, you know, this is 1950, this is only\nfive years, five short years. Of course now war has this other connotation in my mind,\nyou see? I said, \u201cFor heaven sakes, there is another war and nothing has been learned?\nNothing? It\u2019s --\u201d I -- of course I didn\u2019t understand about the war, anyhow. But I -- I\nabsolutely did not understand the war, Korean War, I didn\u2019t understand. Of course,\nKorean War now, as I know it, was really the -- a -- a piece of the larger picture of the\nCold War. But in those days, I absolutely didn\u2019t understand it. But I -- I worried about\nhim an -- a whole lot, I really did. But finally, he had a very good assignment, he\u2019s such a\nprecise man and he\u2019s so good at thing that are -- that require organization and precision,\nthat the -- he was placed in the headquarters in the Camp Drum, that\u2019s upstate New York\nin Watertown. And every time a sh -- and -- and of course the -- his boss was a general\nand the general loved to play golf. Once he found Victor, he could go play golf all day\nlong and Victor would -- everything would be perfect. So, whenever there was a --\nbecause this was a transitional camp for -- for -- before people were sent to -- to -- to\nKorea. So actually what happened 1s this, Victor was drafted and he went to -- in\nMassachusetts, what was the name of the camp? It will come to me. He came for basic --\nwent for basic training and after that he was sent to Camp Drum. And once he got settled\nin that headquarters, where he was the secretary to this general, the general didn\u2019t want to\nget rid of him, because he needed him to play golf. So Victor was sitting in the office and\nfor that he was never shipped up. As a matter of fact, whenever he requested a three day\npass to come to Indiana, he got it too. So, if I came home for Christmas to New York, he\nrequested a pass, and he got it, to come to New York, you see? So, that was very, very\nlucky, but the overall picture of -- of the Cold War and Korea, as it was in -- evolving,\nwas so far -- no, it wasn\u2019t foreign to me, but it was a -- I ust could not comprehend it.",
        "A: About the Korean War? I don\u2019t know how he felt about the Korean war, except for the\nfact that he was drafted and he had to go and he -- he was sort of brought up in a well-to-\ndo family and he never experienced anything like the six weeks of basic training. What\nwas the name of the camp in Massachusetts? Whatever. So, after that, he came back, he\nwas hard like -- you know, hardened by the push-ups and by all that stuff. And in those\ndays, American boys still -- still felt very -- this was before the 60\u2019s -- strongly about\ndoing for the country that was asked of them. Well, he was drafted -- he didn\u2019t ask for it,\nhe was drafted, he was taken in. He put in his two years. He discharged at honorable\ndischarge. So that\u2019s how it was and that was not questioned in the 50\u2019s, such things. I\ncan\u2019t imagine that he would ever try to wiggle out of it, because he probably have --\nnever would think of it. This 1s how it was and he did it. He was just lucky, knock wood,\nthat because he is so efficient in an office setting, that the guy knew whom he had, him,\nand Victor, by virtue of that was -- wa -- never went to Korea.",
        "A: It was very private, just his family and Kris and Miles and their little daughter. That\nwas it. And we were married in the rabbi\u2019s study. The ra -- the family rabbi. His father\nwas quite ill, in fact his father died the same year that -- we were married in March, he --\nthe father died in November. The father was after seven strokes and it was just even\nquestionable if he was going to make it to the wedding, but he did. It was -- the marriage\nwas in the rabbi\u2019s study in Brooklyn. They were supporters of the Temple there and\neverything, so the rabbi accommodated us. And then we went out to dinner in a\nrestaurant and that was it. It had to be very low key for hi -- for his father\u2019s sake, but it\nwas also very low key by -- I would have pre -- I -- I preferred it that way, you know. I\nnever would think of having a big mar -- wedding for myself, never, ever.",
        "A: I don\u2019t like to be the center of attraction, that\u2019s number one. Number two, not having\nmy parents, I didn\u2019t think that I was going to feel good about being married. But the way\nit turned out, tha -- this didn\u2019t even come up. Because the question was, how to have a\nwedding where the father -- Victor\u2019s father can still make it. Well, he made it and that\nwas the best -- was very beautiful in that rabbi\u2019s study. You know, we had the\n[indecipherable] there in the -- it\u2019s beautiful, book lined study with oriental carpets. Was\nlovely, lovely and the family -- immediate family. And that was just the way I felt\ncomfortable about, because without my parents, I did not think I really would ever want\nto be a big -- in a big wedding. And for me that wasn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not my bag to place myself\nat the center. I don\u2019t like that, so --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you frankly, before we went, I was scared. I was very scared. I did a lot\nof reading, of course I always do before I go on a trip, I read this and I read that, because\nwe ha -- I -- I didn\u2019t want to take Victor to Poland -- this was my trip with Victor, to\nburden him with -- to go and cry in Treblinka and the Holocaust and the -- and\nAuschwitz, I didn\u2019t want to do that. I wanted to make it a two prong thing. One part\nwould be that and going back to my hometown to see the very lovely Christian people\nwho were my parents friends and who really were instrumental in -- in pulling us through\nthe war, survive it -- helping in the surviving. And so we organized -- in fact I went to a\nPolish travel agency here, rather than American travel -- we went on our own, you know,\nnot with any group or anything. And I thought Victor ought to be exposed to Polish\nculture a little, because I\u2019m so -- you know, I -- I have it in my blood and -- and I -- \u2019m\nstill very much attached to Polish music, Polish literature and such, so I felt this is part of\nmy life that he\u2019s not part of at all. I mean, he hears me speak Polish, h-he doesn\u2019t know\nwhat it is about, but at least if he went with me so he would have a connection to where I\ncome from, even though he\u2019s by now half-Polish in the sense, because he\u2019s been exposed\n-- he goes with me to all these sympo -- the symposium here and a concert there and the -\n- and the Polish theater, there he goes and he loves it. But in those days -- now, this was\n1980, we were already -- 1980 we were already married many years, because we got\nmarried in \u00b053. I still did not want to make it a crying kind of experience. However, I\nreally feared for myself. I really, truly was scared the first time. I just didn\u2019t know how I\nwas going to react, because my memories were -- | -- I -- I felt maybe my childhood\nmemories all gone and what I will just remember is the horrible, not the good. But it\ndidn\u2019t turn out that way at all. I had no need to worry. I had everything arranged through\na Polish travel agent, exactly the type of itinerary that I wanted to have and it so\nhappened that once we got there, since I peak -- speak Polish, was very easy to have a\ntaxi driver take us to our -- to my hometown and do all these other things, plus go on a to\n-- take tours, you see? So that th -- the experience was wonderful. We do -- did go to\nAuschwitz, it was a very painful thing for me because -- well, we were part of a tour, so it\nwasn\u2019t very personal, you know\u201d? We were there with eight other people, or -- no, there\nwere eight all of -- the total was eight. We -- we took that bus from Warsaw to Krakow.\nWe stayed in a Krakow hotel, this was a group, see? And when we went to Auschwitz,\nthis tour guide -- we were the only two Jewish people, they took us to all these places,\nexcept to Birkenau, where I was. You see, I was in Birkenau in the camp, in -- in the\nbarracks. And she cracked some anti-Semitic jokes on the bus. You know, she was\njoking. And I did not feel that that was tailored to me. This was tailored, this\n[indecipherable] in fact, just before we left, I said, \u201cI understand --\u201d we were done with\nthe visit. We went to see where Father Colba died and all this. And of course -- so I went\nout in a tower to see where the barracks were, but I never went into the barracks. So then\nwe were ready to leave, I said, \u201cI understand there\u2019s a Jewish museum here.\u201d She says,\n\u201cOh, yes, there 1s.\u201d I say, \u201cAren\u2019t we going in there?\u201d She says, \u201cNo. If you asked, we\nwould have gone.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m asking.\u201d So she took us to that Jewish museum and\nthere was Anne Frank and all the other and there was a book, so I signed the book and I -\n- and I said that my father perished there, that I survived. I wrote it in -- I think I wrote it\nin Polish and English. So that was not a very satisfactory experience. We did see a film\nbefore we went, you know, the -- you come, so this was an -- because this was an English\nspeaking tour, so we saw the film. The film gave me more than the tour itself. Course\nlater on I made up for it, but we\u2019re talking now with Victor, 1980. And a much more\nrewarding feeling was when we came to my hometown, because the old ladies were there\nand they prepared lunch for us and there was no -- there was such poverty there and there\nwas no -- there was no meat to by had for anything, why they needed meat I don\u2019t know,\nbut anyhow, she stayed at the -- one of these old ladies stood in line seven hours to get a\npiece of meat to make pirogue for us when we came. And of course I brought them stuff.\nI brought a whole suitcase there, you know, which I emptied. Full -- filled suitcase and\nthey stilled lived in the house that was -- had a crack from the bombs. Anyhow, we left\nthem money, so subsequently she moved to a better apartment. Was a very touching\nexperience because they saw Victor and I -- I was like a -- suppose like a Ping-Pong\nbecause they spoke and I told Victor and he told me and -- and there was a granddaughter\nthat I got to know that was -- she was lovely and she helped us and I -- so we had lunch\nthere and the taxi driver who -- who brought us, I told him -- we gave him some money\nto go have lunch, because I wasn\u2019t going to invite him with us, this was such a personal\nmeeting. And then of course we visited the town, which was totally different. The camp\none -- I already mentioned that one camp didn\u2019t exist any more, it was just built up new\ndevelopment. The other 1s now a shooting range, so that was very touching. The railroad\n-- Victor saw a beautiful locomotive from the 19th century at the railroad station, so we\ntook a picture of that. He -- you know, and I -- we walked around and I showed him --\nthat was -- but that wasn\u2019t the type of experience that broke me up, you see? I thought\nAuschwitz would, but because the Auschwitz was such a cold, impersonal thing, it just\npassed me, you see? The thing that I really fear turned out nothing, because it was so s --\npoorly arranged, you see? Whereas the going back to my hometown was really the\nabsolute heart of that trip. And of course, then in the ci -- yeah, w-we did other things, we\nmet other people in the hotels, they came to visit us in -- but that was on another level,\nthat was already on -- on level of 1980, people -- grownups meeting grownups, but that\nvisit to my hometown really did it and of course, as I think I mentioned, we went to the\ncemetery and we took pictures and -- that -- all this had meaning and it was touching and\nit was lovely, but it was not the kind that broke me. It did not break me and Auschwitz\ncouldn\u2019t break me, because it was too cold and too impersonal.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, I tell you, I still feel very Polish, so there is no getting away from that. I still\nlove the language, I love the music and I am very much part of what I was,\nso I felt very much at home, on one hand. On the other hand, I did not feel that that -- that\nPoland that I saw -- and that was Communist Poland, that\u2019s another thing, it\u2019s very\nimportant. At the height of Communism, if -- in fact, that very August that we were in\nPoland, they started having strikes there. That was the Solidarity movement just started.\nBut when we were there, as I told you, everybody was warning me, don\u2019t talk here, don\u2019t\ndo this and don\u2019t do that and the -- the whole -- the ambiance, the -- the -- the -- the -- the\natmosphere was strange. Whether it was because it was Communist or because there were\njust no more Jewish people around. Much as I considered myself part of it, I already felt\nthat I was an American with another -- besides, having Victor around, I already -- this is\nmy life, this was -- this was one time and tha -- it\u2019s now so different. But, by the same\ntoken, all life is different after 50 years. And as I was telling Victor, because we saw my -\n- part of Starachowice, which was called Wierzbnik, was very dilapidated now, in 1980.\nSo I told him, when I came to America, I went to visit somebody -- Huntspoint Avenue in\nthe South Bronx. A -- a friend I had, and it was a very decent part of the city. If you tell\nsomebody now that this was -- South Bronx was lovely, I mean -- so I told him, this\napplies to -- to Wierzbnik, this part of Starachowice that was so dilapidated. I said, \u201cIf\nyou want to south -- went to South Bronx 50 years later, that -- you have that. You come\nhere and you have this.\u201d So the resemblance to things I knew wasn\u2019t there physically.\nThe Mioufka camp was gone, was a brand new development. So except -- aside from that\nJewish cemetery and the visit with the old ladies, my parents friends, was the only true\nconnection. Other than that, we just went as tourists, we went. I told you, the shopen\nroute and we went to the salt mines and we went to zarcoparna and we went to\nChancetahova. We went to see the -- the holy picture, you know, the -- you know the\nChancetahova? No, Chancetahova is a very famous Polish monastery that has the\nMadonna -- the famous Madonna, the black Madonna picture? Okay, I had to see the\nblack Madonna, because I was brought up about that and I knew about it and I -- so since\nthe tr -- group was going there, we went to see the black Madonna. And we went into --\nwas just before a mass, we were brought in through the room where the priests were\nbeing robed in de -- and we stood right in front, against that -- against that -- the -- it was\nlike a fa -- barrier, you know, and we were the first row of the pilgrims -- that was\npilgrimage time, too, there was thousands of people in the church and we saw the black\nMadonna, so I did that -- which was interesting, because you know, this fitted -- this fit in\na vacuum that was in my -- my brain that I was -- I -- I was brought up on this thing, this\nis the holiest picture in the Christian -- in Christian faith in Poland, is the black Madonna.\nNow, I\u2019ve seen the black Madonna, so -- so this was basically the trip with -- with Victor\nand of course, he got a good feeling of what it was about. But it -- as you could see, it\ndidn\u2019t turn out to be scary, as I expected it to be. It was on another level, at another age --\nmy personal age, with Communism all around, with the -- all places having changed\nphysically, too, so it just wasn\u2019t -- it -- it -- anyhow, it was to my benefit, because the way\nit turned out. The second trip that I took with -- for the Holocaust Museum, that -- for the\ninterpreting, that was a little more personal and much more worse. Well, because we\nwent to Auschwitz and I was at the ba -- in the barrack and the -- and the bunk where I\nslept and you know, that was all very personal. But by then, since I was already in\nanother capacity as an interpreter, I couldn\u2019t allow myself to be breaking down, you\nknow, like when we came to Majdanek, and there was no interpreter, English in -- we\nwere supposed to -- the group was supposed to have an interpreter. So they only had the\nPolish interpreter, so I stood there and I was the -- I was the interpreter. So I -- I had to\nprocess the language and I couldn\u2019t -- I could not feel the meaning of the words that I\nwas saying, you see? So that -- but that was much more worthwhile, the second trip. But\nstill, I have already been through that first hoop of -- of facing up to Poland, so it -- that\nwent -- that wasn\u2019t bad.",

        "A: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question, but I could tell you --",
        "A: Yeah, that was one part, definitely that was one part. But the other part, the\npredominant part was that having been to Poland twice, to my hometown twice and\nhaving found nothing of the old Jewish life in ei-either time, first was 1980, then was\n1987, I felt that any way of commemorating the former existence of a Jewish community\nin Poland was to save that cemetery. There wasn\u2019t much left of it, but whatever was left,\nthat that was now a mission, 1n a sense, because when I was in 1980 and Victor made all\nthose wonderful pictures and I brought them back to the Starachowice Society at the time\nwhen I told you, in October, when we meet for the Yourtside? And I was really sort of\ntold off and -- and I didn\u2019t want to create waves and I didn\u2019t want to make enemies and I\nsort of never liked to push myself, so I let it slide and I sent the pictures to Israel and\nnothing came of it and I had correspondence going on, whatever. After I was able to just\nregister the cemetery in New York, with this other lady, who was -- she happened to have\nbeen my -- Polafunk is her name, she was my religion teacher in Poland, she happens to\nlive in New York. She\u2019s an elderly lady now. We discussed it, she also was really v-v-\nvery much on the -- on -- on my wavelength, so to say. We\u2019re still around and we must\ndo it. If they -- whoever doesn\u2019t like it -- the Polish community will not do it. A, they\u2019re\npoor, B, they\u2019re not interested, C, they would rather have houses built there than have a\nJewish cemetery, because who\u2019s here? There\u2019s nobody around, nobody will know and\nsuch and such. So we did this one thing that we accomplished, we registered the cemetery\nhere in New York, just before the list was closed for the Jewish cemeteries that were\ngoing to be given to the Polish government. So we got that done. After that, when they --\nI have already spoken about it, when the idea of them -- collecti -- thing the money was --\ncame -- it was the easiest things, I just didn\u2019t call the other people and called those that\ngave and they gave and money went to Israel, then the man was sent to Poland and things\nwere done and it\u2019s done. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s easier than -- th-than pie, as they say. Had I\nknown, I would have -- or maybe you know, on the other hand, maybe 1980 people\nweren\u2019t quite ready yet for that. That\u2019s -- you know, you really have to be in a special\nframe of mind to undertake a certain -- a certain obligation. I saw this in 1980 because I\nsaw it with my own eyes. The houses were being built, the cemetery was neglected, it\nwas overgrown, it was -- the -- the -- the monuments were knocked over. The Germans\ntook out a lot of the monuments and they paved streets with it. And I said, \u201cIf you\nallowed what\u2019s going on til now, another year or two, there\u2019ll be nothing there.\u201d This\ngranddaughter of this -- these old ladies, they -- she came with us to the cemetery. And\nthrough her, you see, after I left Poland and I was constant correspondence with her. She\nwent again and then she wrote me a letter, she said -- three years later, she says,\n\u201cWhatever you and your husband saw, there 1s less of it now.\u201d When I had that letter, I\nhit the ceiling. And so this, I think, was the final -- the final push that I needed. And I got\nin touch with Israel and I got in touch with everybody else and I said, \u201cWe do it or we\u2019ll\nnever have it and let\u2019s forget everybody else.\u201d So this was a fulfillment, not -- to answer\nyour question, it wasn\u2019t only because I had no place to grieve. I have nobody in that\ncemetery, we never did have anybody there. This was to preserve a token, that this is a\ntoken, to preserve a little bit of sacred soil, so to say, to show that there was a vibrant\ncommunity here at one time and is no more and -- and if it takes money to do it -- to\nperpetuate it, that could be done. There are a lot of survivors whose children are\ninterested and there\u2019s no reason why this cannot be perpetuated, to be -- to have a\ncaretaker and to just keep that little bit of whatever was left. I personally don\u2019t even need\n-- read Yiddish. I couldn\u2019t even read the -- the monuments. Victor took close up pictures,\nI brought it to New York and I asked some people to read the names. But that\u2019s not -- that\ndoesn\u2019t mean anything. This is a Jewish cemetery and -- so that was the project that really\nwas -- 1-it -- 1t was good for me, personally. You know, however 1-it wa -- whatever good\nit did for others, it was good for me, personally, very fulfilling.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, well actually, my translation does not have much bearing with the Korchuk --\nyou see, I -- I used to write and publish articles and such and those are two separate\nissues, SO maybe I will start with the Korchuk, okay? And then with the translation, cause\nthose are separate issues. I was -- and still am, for many years, a member of the Polish\nInstitute of Arts and Sciences. It\u2019s an academic institution of -- 1-1t was organized by\nPolish Jewish -- Polish Christian -- Polish Jewish scholars during the war, when they ran\naway from Europe. And this was an academic institution and it has always done things\nthat pertain to Polish academic life. And culture, too, but Koschushka Foundation, which\nis another organization, Polish organization, deals more with the cultural aspect, but the\nPolish Institute was always part of the academic world. American fit into the academic\nworld, cause a lot of the people there were the professors, professors in American\nuniversities. Anyhow, in the early 80\u2019s, a dialog was started, a Polish Jewish dialog, you\nknow. There is a Polish Jewish dialog in London, there is one in Chicago. There -- there\nare Polish Jewish dialogs forever going on everywhere, but not much progress ha -- some\nprogress has been made, but not as much as it could have. Anyhow, there was an idea\narose that because Ko-Korchuk was a humanitarian, who was a great educator,\nphilosopher. He was also, you know, a doctor who organized the famous orphanage, the\nJewish orphanage, who had this new idea of child upbringing and he was an assimilated\nPolish Jew, who also suffered anti-Semitism while he lived in Poland. He was a -- a 19th\ncentury man who lived under the Russian occupation. Well, Korchuk was a humanist of\nmen of the highest moral and ethical standards. Of the highest devotion to -- to -- to\nhumanity. And because his considered himself a Polish Jew and a Jewish Pole, it was\ndecided, whoever it was, Polish organizations and Jewish organizations decided to use\nKorchuk\u2019s name as a core, as a central piece of a Polish Jewish dialog. I was nominated\nfrom the Polish Institute to become -- to join the group of people who were organizing\nthis dialog. And this was 1n the nine -- early 1980\u2019s, \u201c81, \u00b082, \u00b083, \u201884. Anyhow, we\nwould meet at the ADL, at the ameri -- Anti-Defamation League. The -- the whole idea\nwas -- because he was also a great writer, he wrote books for children and about children.\nBooks on psychology about children, but fantastic books for children. I -- he also had a\nradio program and every child -- he used to read books to children. So every child who\ngrew up in the Poland, in the inter war years, would know Korchuk\u2019s stories. Anyhow, he\nwas used as a central figure for the dialog. And in a competition -- international book\ncompetition was established, where books would be submitted for children -- books\nwritten for children, or about children -- two separate categories. And, when the prizes\nwere going to be given out, then it would be a gathering of Polish and Jewish -- Polish\nChristian and -- and Jewish Polish group meet and we would have ceremonies and so. I\nbecame a what you call reader, because I do book reviews a lot. I ri -- I do book reviews\nfor the American Translators Association and anyhow, since I wrote a lot of book\nreviews, too. So I became a book reader and I -- because I also worked in the Children\u2019s\nLibrary here for 11 years, I picked the children\u2019s books. So I would have 20 - 25 books to\nread. And I had an outline, how to mark that. We would submit it, then the judges would\ndecided and then there would be a ceremony. Now I really am very much interested in\nreading you the names of the organizations which participated. Unfortunately this 1s now\nall past tense, because this whole thing fell apart, this whole ca -- dialog. We had it for\nabout four or five years and then it didn\u2019t terminate, 1t petered out. There was never an\nofficial notice, we no longer do it, we -- whatever. All of a sudden -- I didn\u2019t get a notice,\nthere will be a fo -- there will be -- I was never notified that they\u2019re going to send me a\nboo -- box of books. I never heard from anybody, nobody ever heard from anybody and\nthe thing just thinned out into the air. So I thought if I read you some of this -- these\nparticipating groups, which was a mixture of Polish Christian and Polish Jewish. So there\nwere the anti-Defamation League of B\u2019nai Brith, the American Council of Polish Cultural\nClubs, the American Federation of Jewish Fighters, Camp inmates and Nazi victims,\nFederation of Polish Jews in the United States Holocaust Library. The Koschushka\nFoundation, which I told you before is a cultural Polish organization. The North\nAmerican Study Center for Polish Affair, also called Studium. The Polish American\nCongress, that\u2019s -- they -- their -- their home office is in Chicago. The Polish Institute of\nArts and Sciences of America. That\u2019s this organization that I was a member from. Polish\nJudiciary Organization. Vargro, which is the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization\nand the World Federation of Bergen-Belden -- Belgen Associations. In addition to which\nthere was also the head publisher and chief editor of the Polish Noveegenyeek, which 1s a\nvery substantial, very high level Polish language newspaper in New York. His name 1s\nBola [indecipherable]. He was also part of it as a member of the institute, not as a\nrepresentative from his paper. He cannot be a newspaperman and be listed, yeah. Well\nanyhow, this, as you could see, was a very well integrated type of a group. People on\nvery high level of -- of achievement -- organizations and such. One of -- we met -- a few\nof these award ceremonies took place in [indecipherable] here in New York. One took\nplace in Washington, I remember traveling -- in the Kennedy Center. One wa -- had the\nCheswafmeewash, the Polish Nobel Prize winning poet, as keynote speaker. Once they\nhad Governor Keene from New York -- from New Jersey, a -- he was the governor then,\na keynote speaker. They had very interesting keynote speakers -- was lovely get together,\nthe prizes were handed out. First prize I think was thousand dollars, second prize -- and\nthere were two separate categories, as I told you. One was books for children, one was\nbooks about children. And the books actually were submitted internationally. That\nmeans, the books from Israel, from Poland, from England, from France, from the United\nStates and of course the judges picked -- had -- they picked the first, second and third\nprize in both categories and this was sort of a -- like a very good quote unquote excuse. It\nwasn\u2019t an excuse, but it was a very good -- th-the joining point, to -- to have something\nlike this go on and much as these -- this group was in agreement that Korchuk personified\nthe very essence of what humanitarian d-deeds should be about, as much as he\npersonified the Pole and the Jew, all one, as -- as the humanist, you see? As the -- as the\nperson of -- of the highest ethical standard. He personified humanity, so he had to\npersonify Polish Christians and Polish Jews all at once and because he was assimilated\nand he was a man of both worlds, you see? Both the Christian and the Jewish. He was not\nof the religious type of Jews, he -- they were -- there was an assimilated family. His\nfather I think was a lawyer and his grandfather was a doctor or som -- he himself was a\npediatrician, by training. So, you see, this had such great possibilities. And this had such\nvery major aspects of reconciliation built into it. Because he was that thing that we were\ntrying here to build up. We already started with a model, you know? Not a role model,\nwith a model of what we are after. And it somehow -- it fell by the wayside. It just -- I\ndon\u2019t know if I mentioned it, I had open heart surgery in 1989, so after that my ho --\npersonal situation change, I stop -- I stopped publishing and I stopped accepting\ninvitations to do this and join that, because you know, I had to slow down physically.\nAnd now of course I -- I am much better than I was in the first few years, but I still am\nnot of the same -- on the same physical level that I was before the operation, so that it\npetered out just about the time I got sick. And I wasn\u2019t going to be bothered, because I\nwas too much involved with -- then two years later I found out that it -- it isn\u2019t that they\ndidn\u2019t notify me, they just didn\u2019t -- they just -- 1t just fell apart, so -- but there are other\ndialogs, you know, going on, Polish Jewish dialogs that are going on. There is a very fine\ngroup in London and there\u2019s one very good -- good group in Chicago. At this point we\nhave nothing here and I don\u2019t know if -- it\u2019s a very thorny problem, because there\u2019s two\nsteps forward, one step back. And there\u2019s a lot of animosity and misunderstanding and\nthere shouldn\u2019t be. Absolutely should not be, and --",

        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know what the reasons were for what happened. From my personal\nviewpoint, if I were to decide, I would welcome him. Because you cannot resolve issues\nif you are not willing to talk to your en -- to your enemies. You don\u2019t have to talk to your\nfriends, because you know that they are on your side. But you do have to talk to your\nenemies. And there are always viewpoints that are wide spread -- spread very -- very far\napart. But, bringing them closer, you don\u2019t have to attempt to bring them together the\nfirst time or the second time, but you have to allow time for a reconciliation which\nfinalizes a point that is mutually acceptable to two sides. Therefore, I -- my personal --\nthat is nothing to do with what the politics of the matter are or how the Jewish\ncommunity feels or how the Arab community feels, had it been up to me, I would have\ninvited him. That 1s all I can tell you. And -- and I think that was an opportunity missed.",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you frankly, I am very much impressed by the work they\u2019re doing. I\nthink the museum, as an educational institution cannot be compared to any other body of\n-- of -- of -- you know, cause any -- not to any other museum, because museums don\u2019t\ndeal with education, really. This is a combination of -- of resource center, educational\ncenter and museum. And that -- and the way it\u2019s run and the way they have it all, 1s so\nimpressive. I'll tell you, I went to the -- the -- the Holo -- not the Holocaust -- the Jewish\nmuseum in Lower Manhattan, Battery Park? I liked it. I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s -- it has\nthree approaches and you know, before the Jewish experience, it\u2019s a -- encompasses the\nentire Jewish experience, whereas the Holocaust deals primarily with the Holocaust. I\nwas more impressed by the Holocaust Museum concept and I think it hits you much\nstronger than this museum, because when you go to this museum, here in New York, you\nfeel that you\u2019ve been to a museum. When you go to the other museum, it\u2019s an experience\nthat shakes you up. And that, you need. I don\u2019t mean you, the visitor, but anybody, you\nknow, who even -- never went there, but knows what this deals with specifically. It is sort\nof like a reminder, you know? Which 1s the par -- purpose, I imagine, of the museum, not\nto forget what happened and to learn from that experience. And I\u2019 Il tell you, I told Miles\nabout it. This is -- I met somebody in New Hampshire, he was an -- very simple man who\ndoes road work, you know, one of the bulldozers and -- young fellow, maybe 35 years\nold or so and he noticed my number. And he told me -- he says, \u201cOh, you one of those?\u201d\nHe -- he said it like that. And I say, \u201cYes.\u201d I say, \u201cWhy did you say that?\u201d He says, \u201cOh,\nyou know, I must tell you about a place, you must go there,\u201d he tells me. I said, \u201cWhat\nplace is 1t?\u201d He says, \u201cYou know, my wife and I and I -- our 13 year old kid and my --\nmy mother-in-law, we went to Tennessee and we decided -- we were in Washington,\nthey said there is this museum, we\u2019ll go to see it. You have no idea what kind of place\nthat is.\u201d This is this man telling me. So, he says, \u201cYou must go there.\u201d He says, \u201cYou\nknow, it\u2019s all about the war and what the Germans did to the Jews, and,\u201d he says, \u201cI can\u2019t\nget over it.\u201d Well, I told him, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you saw it, because I do happen to know about\nit.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, this deals with the kind of experience of --\u201d cause I didn\u2019t go into details\nwith him of anything. I said, \u201cWhat did your young chil -- young boy think?\u201d Oh, he\nsays, \u201cOh, he was very impressed with -- even my mother-in-law couldn\u2019t believe it. She\ndidn\u2019t want to go there,\u201d he tells me. Well, as soon as I -- the conversation was over, I\ncalled up Miles and I told him, \u201cMiles, this is one thing you have to hear, because coming\nfrom this man who -- who lives in the provinces, in a village, who happened to be in\nWashington on the way from Tennessee, they -- where they visited fa-family, who never\nhad any intention of going, but somehow or other he heard something and he went to see.\nAnd for a man -- a Christian man, obviously, to be so impressed and so overwhelmed,\nthat when he saw me, he couldn\u2019t believe that -- I -- he should tell me about it to go there\nimmediately. And I told Miles, I said, \u201cSpread the word in the museum, that whatever it\u2019s\nyou\u2019re doing, you\u2019re doing it very well, because it is reaching the kind of people that\nshould be reached.\u201d See, that is the point, that the museum -- the Holocaust Museum\nreaches people in a way that nothing else would reach them. I mean, for me to go to the\nmuseum, well, I go. But for somebody who didn\u2019t even know the story of the Holocaust,\nto go with the -- the three generations of family and everybody was impressed and he\nhimself, couldn\u2019t get over it. Now there is the sum it up. They are doing the best possible\nwork that could be done to educate, to keep the memory and to stay within the historical\nframework -- you know, without. There is very little commentary there that would make\nyou feel that it is slated -- that the -- one way or another, because I feel it\u2019s a very well\nbalanced -- the Holocaust Museum, I think is very well balanced in con -- the content 1s\nvery well balanced. So, I have the highest regard for what they are doing and I\u2019m very,\nvery pleased that it has run so efficiently and so well. And as I told you, the proof of the\npudding 1s in the eating. If this man, of all people -- I mean, if I met in -- somebody in\nNew York City and he told me, well, you know. But over there? A man lives in a hole in\nthe wall in a village somewhere and works on the -- works for the state, digging, you\nknow, the roadwork. To be so impressed as to tell me 50 times, he repeated, \u201cYou must\ngo,\u201d until I [indecipherable] \u201cI went there, I wa --\u201d He says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go again?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cI know the place.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell him much about it, you know\u201d? But I found\nit so interesting, I\u2019m telling you, I called Miles immediately. I told him, \u201cThis you\u2019ve got\nto hear.\u2019 Cause there is your answer about -- not that he asked the question, but this\nbasically illustrates how I feel. I feel that it is reaching the kind of people that the New\nYork museum probably will not reach.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really quite understand the question. How should specialized scholarship be\nconducted or how should it be -- how should the conclusions be promoted, or -- or -- I\ndon\u2019t understand the question.",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you -- to give you a general ex -- answer, as you know, within a society\nthere are a million -- million people with million opinions. There are issues that don\u2019t get\nresolved for many, many years. There are issues that -- that will never be resolved and I\nthink an institution that is open to the larger public -- I mean, everybody goes to the\nHolocaust Museum, you know. It isn\u2019t that only academics, or only university students\ngo there, but this is open to the larger public, Christian and otherwise, from all over the\nworld. I understand there -- they have attendance from all over the world. That issues\nhave to be presented, but not as a final conclusion, you know? There are issues, like the\nPolish Jewish dialog. It 1s inconclusive, it is ongoing, it is forever evolving and there is\nno answer. There are a trillion such issues in the world now. There 1s Ireland, that\nunfortunately has been going on for years and years within the same people. So there is\nno such a thing as preventing some viewpoints and -- and excluding other viewpoints. I\nhave always been for reconciliation of ev -- of every kind and I\u2019ve always been for\ninclusion. In this case, inclusion has to mean -- even if not resolving certain issues,\npresenting certain issues. It\u2019s -- 1t was like with the Jewish cemetery, you know? I was\ndiscouraged by the criticism that I was planning to do something. I should have\noverlooked it. I should not have been bothered. But my natural instinct was, this is\ncontroversial, I don\u2019t want to make people feel bad, I don\u2019t -- this and the other thing.\nMeanwhile, the issue was being dead and buried in front of my own eyes, until it came up\nand we seized the opportunity. And this is just a -- a stupid example, maybe, but it\nbasically applies in life. You cannot close the doors on anything and you cannot consider\nanything as a final expression of whatever it is. Because everything is evolves --\neverything evolves and you leave -- if you leave it breathing room -- you know, if you\u2019re\nleaving a roo -- if you leave it the room -- breathing room, you -- you could be all\ninclusive for every viewpoint, without having to ara -- arrive at the specific, final\ndetermination or conclusion. Those aren\u2019t always called for. Determina -- final\ndeterminations, nothing is final. You know, you grow older, you find out. Everything is\nchanging, always, everything. So if there 1s an open door type of approach, there\u2019s\nalways a chance. We\u2019ll be gone years and years, God only knows, there will be reso --\nresolution to Ireland and to -- to Middle East and -- and everything else will be -- would -\n- would resolve itself, you know? So this is personally my -- my feeling, but I have the\nhighest regard for the museum\u2019s work. And as I told you, I consider it much superior to\nthe museum in Lower Manhattan. Absolutely. Others are no comparison. This is\ninteresting, in New York. The other is profound, stimulating and it shakes you up. That 1s\nthe difference.",
        "A: No, really, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m really very grateful to you for taking the time and for coming\nback and -- and all this and it was really very nice. But this is an awfully -- that\u2019s going to\nbe part of the other tape, I imagine. So it will be an awfully long interview. I don\u2019t know\nwho will ever want to hear it.\nBeginning Tape Eight, Side A",
        "A: Well, you know that your -- your -- your group identity, so to say -- let\u2019s put it ina\nbigger framework, relates basically to your childhood. This is the way I see it. I do not --\nexcuse me -- I do not come from a very religious family, observant or strictly religious.\nOur parents were Progressive Jews, very much interested in Zionism and also attached to\nJudaism through religion, but certainly not of the Hassidic type that was prevalent in\nPoland, in between the wars. And of course, this sort of rubbed off on us children, the\nidea, the -- the very strong idef -- identification with the Jewish people, but not through\nreligion. Not -- no, not through religion strict observance -- through religious observance,\nbut rather on a -- on a -- on another level than the Hassidic, that the prevalent observance\nwas -- was known for at that time. Consequently, obviously, I had -- I did go to -- to\nHebrew school, as I told you, which was -- dealt with Jewish religion and it had dealt\nwith the Bible and Jewish history, but that was sort of more secular, by nature and so was\nour life at home, even though my grandmother was very religious, which I also\nmentioned prior to this ex -- to this interview. I seem to have continued in that vein. It\nwas lucky when I married Victor, that his family was affiliated with a Reform Temple in\nBrooklyn -- a rather well-known Temple, with -- Rabbi Steinback was his name, he was a\npoet and a writer and an army chaplain and he was also a very inspired type of\nclergyman, you know, he talked poetry and he -- even when he married us, it was, \u201cWhat\na -- what two beautiful names, Regina and Victor. Can you imagine a combination of two\nnames like --\u201d you know, he made a whole to-do about it. Those were his sermons, that\nwas his approach. That was Victor\u2019s background, this Rabbi Steinback. When we got\nmarried, we discovered that we more a -- we are on the same level. My identity -- Jewish\nidentity was stronger than Victor\u2019s, because of the Zionist connection, number one and of\ncourse the fact that I was singled out during the war for being Jewish and nobody ever let\nme forget it. You know, for the fact that I was going to be a victim any second, just\nbecause I was Jewish. So that most certainly, if nothing else, would remind me that that\u2019s\nwhat I am. So that when we got married, we also joined a -- a Reform Temple, in our\narea. And our -- both children were Bar Mitzvahed in that Temple. We -- we don\u2019t have a\nkosher home, you know, we observe the Jewish holidays, we are members of the Temple\nall these years, the same Temple. That goes back 35 years at least and -- we are not active\nin the Temple, even though they were trying to get us in, somehow or other, I don\u2019t\nknow, we never got involved in the Temple, but we are certainly very much interested in\nsupporting the Temple financially and seeing that it\u2019s viable then. And we enjoy going\nthere to services. We go -- th-they have a Kristallnacht observance in Novembers, we go\nto that all the time. We go to the Shoah observances, we go to -- in between the Jewish\nholidays, but we do not go regularly, like weekend services. We don\u2019t go regularly, every\nnow and then we do go, so that to this day my religious orientation 1s within those bounds\nof -- of an inner life that does not need the reinforcement, but it needs the connection, you\nsee? The connection to -- to -- to Reform Judaism is very fine with me. It -- 1t keeps me\nwithin the frame that can accommodate my inner self, you see? Whereas if you put me to\nbe with the Lubavitches, I would probably be rebelling to the point where I would deny\nthat I\u2019m Jewish, because I probably could not accept it as part of who I am. You see,\nthere\u2019s too na -- th-th-th-th -- their -- their focus is too narrow and so on. The Reform\nTemple has a wider focus and -- and that suits us very well. So, to that extent, we are\ngood Jews, so to say, not religious. And certainly, as far as identity is concerned, not only\nhundred percent identity of Judaism, but a million percent, if there 1s such a thing, you\nsee? So, I -- I -- I hope this answers your question.",
        "A: Not really. You see, I -- since I did not come from a background where religion was\nthe answer, I did not seek the answer in religion during the war, obviously, you know?\nAnd I don\u2019t know that I -- I -- I -- I ever followed this idea of everything being\npreordained or predetermined. I -- I believe in -- in free will, you see, and -- and so when\nI bak -- was in America and I became old enough to appreciate the philosophical un-\nunderpinnings of religion, I rather liked where I came from, you see, and I was happy\nwith the way I was and I\u2019m happy the way I am. And obviously we would have -- we\nwould have changed one way or another, but obviously we carried on, in -- at the -- in the\nsame vein, right through, so it has to sit well with us, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t do it, right?",
        "A: Connections.",
        "A: Okay. For example, I told you I know the students -- I mentioned before from my --\nthe Air F -- Air Force officers. He was a colonel. Now, we have been in touch for all\nthese years. They came to visit here, we went to Boulder, Colorado to visit them, we\ncorrespond all the time. He sends me pictures, I send him pictures of the grandchildren\nand children and we tell each other, Christmastime, all the time -- by the way, I am a\nletter writer. Other people don\u2019t write letters any more, I do. Now this is one old\nconnection I -- people from Berlin, from the DP camp. My very dearest, dearest friend\nfrom the DP camps -- DP camp, are still here. One of them is George Schwab. Another is\nRoma Lichtenthal, she\u2019s also -- she lives in Scarsdale. My friend in Argentina, I\u2019m very\nclose with her. W-We write to each other, we see each other at least once a year, because\nshe comes through New York once a year. And that\u2019s from the DP camp. Of course, from\nhigh school -- I still have my friends from high school. One lives in Albany. We still are -\n- we\u2019re still in touch, Toby. My very best, dearest friend committed suicide. She was\nfrom that connection, but that\u2019s an whole other story, because she was very dependent on\nme for many years, so she was more like friend because she -- she was psychologically\ndamaged and she was part of my family as long as she lived, for the reason that she was a\nneedy person. I don\u2019t mean financially, you know, she had a Ph.D. and everything, but\nshe was needy, very needy. Then a friend from Poland, who lives in Brooklyn, who --\nwith whom I lived for awhile. She\u2019s another connection. From Indiana University,\ncertainly -- certainly, I have Nancy, who still lives in Montreal, retired now. She was\nProfessor of Biology. Now, with Dr. Karpen, Jefferson High School, going back to\nJefferson High School, when Dr. Karpen was alive and his wife was alive, I was with --\nin correspondence with them all the time. They had a summer home in Chichester, New\nYork and whenever we used to go to the Catskills -- that\u2019s also in the ca -- upper\nCatskills -- whenever we used to go to the Catskills, we used to go visit them, with the\nchildren. I have lovely pictures from that period. Miss Hay, who was alive, while she was\nalive, she lived in Seetawket. Also went there, with the children, with -- for lunches, for\ndinners, we used to invite her, she came here. I had another very favorite teacher from\nBrooklyn College speech class, Professor Lawson, she was a lovely woman. Also, she\ndied in California. Unfortunately, all these people I\u2019m talking about, who, through the\nyears -- they were first here, then they were maybe very nearby and then they were\nmoving away. So, most of it remained as contact by correspondence, and I\u2019m just trying\nto think, although I\u2019m sure I wouldn\u2019t do justice to most of my friends, to whom, I mean,\nth-th-th -- on Israel, well, of course, Israel is Poland, you know. Israeli connection --\nfriends in Israel, with whom I correspond to [indecipherable] and see each other. We go\nthere, they come here. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s more like family than friends. That\u2019s people that I\nwent through -- we -- through the camps with and such. And of course, I\u2019m very much in\ntouch with the Jewish organization, the Starachowice organization, which now, as I told\nyou, also, unfortunately people are passing on and the thing is not what it used to be, so --\nyou know, we used to be invited to their Bar Mitzvahs and we used to go and visit and\nhave these meetings once a year. That is now -- most of it actually is thinning out. The\ngroup is thinning out because of age -- they move away to Florida or they die. Most of us\nnow are getting on in age. I -- I can\u2019t begin to -- to think, from Bronx Science, when the\nkids were in Bronx Science, we made connections there, we had friends, neighborhood\npeople. I mean, the fact remains that I write letters and I -- I like to write letters. My\nfriend from Poland, who is now in Chicago, we\u2019re in constant correspondence and I\nhaven\u2019t seen her maybe eight years, Irene. But we -- and of course, the telephone helps,\ntoo. And family, I -- family -- I\u2019m very much attached to family, to cousins and such, so\nwe -- that telephone takes care of that, all my -- my nieces and my nephews and my -- so\nthat -- that goes without saying, but as far as friends are concerned, I can\u2019t quite now\nremember off hand, but I can tell you, I have all these friends whom I call my connection.\nThis is a Berlin connection, this is a Thomas Jefferson connection. This is Indiana\nconnection, you see? This is Bronx Science connection. So I already have these\ncategorized, these people categorized. They are friends of equal importance, otherwise I\nwouldn\u2019t have to -- stayed in touch. It\u2019s just that they are from different periods of my\nlife and I will be very sorry to see when -- when writing letters 1s no longer fashionable,\nyou know, because that will be a very great loss to -- to human contact, I can tell you.\nBecause I have Christian friends whom I don\u2019t see for 10 - 15 years at the time. Comes\nChristmas, I get a full letter, I write a full letter. And that is -- that\u2019s in fr -- friends from\nIndiana, from wherever. I have -- and of course Poland. I write to Poland a lot. But I can\njust tell you that it\u2019s like clockwork. Comes Christmas, I spend two weeks writing letters,\nbecause I know that everybody\u2019s going to write to me as well. And I think this is just\nwonderful. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s the way I love it. And people who are going to dispose of -- of\ncorrespondence, will probably be very much poorer for it. I -- I really feel that way. I\nreally, truly -- I adore receiving letters. Not le -- not mail, not bills, letters.",
