        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr\ncollection. This is an interview with Mrs. Agnes Vogel, conducted by Dan\nGediman on the ninth of July, 1997 in Indianapolis, Indiana. This is a follow-up\nJuly 14\", 1989. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape\nnumber one, side A. ... Yes, very possibly, I -- I will -- I believe real strongly in\npreserving history. You might want to put that down, cause the sound of the paper\nrattling.",
        "Answer: [inaudible] Okay.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Okay, the first -- the first thing that -- that I\u2019m going to do is, they asked me to\nfill in a couple of gaps in the interview that you did with them on the video. There\nwere a couple of things, n-not so much during the war, but before and immediately\nafter that they wanted me to ask about, to just fill in the gaps. And then we\u2019ll focus\non from after the war to the present. And if at any point you want to stop and take a\nbreak, or you need, for whatever reason, to stop, or if there\u2019s a question I ask that\nyou\u2019d rather not talk about, just say so.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Like to start by asking you about your family, about -- let\u2019s start with your\nparents. Who were they, what were they like as people, as parents?",
        "A: They were very nice people, they were very good parents. My father\u2019s name\nwas Dezso Wielisz.",
        "Q: How do you spell that, his first name?",
        "A: D-e-z-s-o, with two dots on the O. That\u2019s a real Hungarian spelling, it\u2019s a real\nHungarian name. The family name was Wieisz and after the war, in 1948, they\nchanged the family name to Varga, because of the situation in Hungary at the time.",
        "Q: And how can you s -- how do you spell that?",
        "A: Varga? V-a-r-g-a.",
        "Q: And so at what time would that name change have happened, roughly?",
        "A: I believe it happened after I left from home, and I left the end of \u201946, so the year\nit happened, probably the beginning of 48.",
        "Q: And so you say they changed it because of the situation. Do you mean -- how\ndo you mean?",
        "A: Well, Pll go -- let me go back, let me tell you something about my mother. My\nmother\u2019s maiden name was Julia Schwartz. And my mother -- actually both of my\nparents were born the northwest -- northeast part of Hungary. And my mother was\nborn in Ungvar, and my father was born in a small town named Boattfaller. They\nwere -- well, what\u2019s the word I want to use? My father was quite a few years older\nthan my mother and he waited until she grew up for them to get married.",
        "Q: How much age difference?",
        "A: About eight years, probably. And -- and by that time my father lived in a\ndifferent city in -- more in the middle of the hung -- eastern part of Hungary, that\u2019s\nwhere I was born, called Debrecen. And he was a well established businessman at\nthat time. And my mother was a very beautiful woman and they were a very\nhandsome couple. I had three sisters; there was four children in the family, all girls.\nAnd I lived a nice life.",
        "Q: Tell me about your sisters, their names.",
        "A: My sisters, oh yeah, I\u2019m the oldest, I\u2019m child number one. I have a sister who is\nalmost five years younger and another one who was born three years after her and\none three years after.",
        "Q: And their names?",
        "A: Martha, Mariann -- actually Marianna and Gabriela is the youngest.",
        "Q: Just going to move the microphone a little closer so we can pick you up better.\nNot a whole lot, but just a little. And they all made it?",
        "A: We all survived, yes. Well, our situation was a little bit different than my\nhusband.",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: So we all survived together, we were all together all through that year.",
        "Q: And what has happened to your sisters?",
        "A: They are fine, we all survived. One sister lives in New York. One lives in\nScotland and the youngest one stayed home -- home in Hungary to take care of our\nparents. See, the other two sisters, the two middle girls left Hungary in 1956, after -\n- during and after the revolution that they had in Hungary then. And one ended up\nin England and the other one made it to the United States.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re the only one that left right away?",
        "A: I left right away.",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019ll get to that, cause that\u2019s much of what we want to talk about. Were\nyou poor, middle class, well-to-do?",
        "A: Well, it went from good to bad. When I was born my father was -- we weren\u2019t\nrich, but well-to-do. And what I remember as a child growing up is hearing about\nthings. When the crash of the stock market in the United States and the\n[indecipherable] got over to Europe by the mid 30\u2019s, it had an effect on my father\u2019s\nbusiness. And then eventually, in 1938, Hitler was in power and that was getting\ndownhill. And by 1942 my father was in a labor camp.",
        "Q: Your -- your parent\u2019s parents, your grandparents, how would you describe th-\nthem in terms of their -- or theirs s-status financially, socially?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even know, I remember my grandparents as old people. Somehow they\nwere always old. My pare -- my mother\u2019s parents and my grandfather had a\nbusiness, he was a well-to-do man. They lived in a beautiful home.",
        "Q: He was a what?",
        "A: A well-to-do man. He -- they lived in a beautiful home, and I can still remember\n[indecipherable] built into the mountain there. And they had the business on the\nbottom of the -- you know, the street floor and the house was up on top, and it was\na beautiful home with beautiful furniture and all that. We used to go there to visit\nand spent -- I spent a lot of vacation time over there. My grandmother was a\nbeautiful woman, a very stately lady. And my grandfather was a sweet old man.",
        "Q: And on the other side?",
        "A: On the other side they were -- well, it\u2019s a strange stories because my two\ngrandparents -- my two grandmothers were sisters. My parents were first cousins.\nMy father\u2019s father, he was a different kind of a man, he was -- I don\u2019t know how to\ndescribe him. I just remember him during the hun -- you know, Jewish holidays.\nHe was a religious man, not overly, but he was you know, the both sides were very\nobservant Jewish people. I remember my father\u2019s father during the -- the Succoth\nholiday. And they always had a sukkah built in the yard, and he would sit there and\ntake all his meals there and have his prayer book there. Yet, when he got angry, he\ncould yell like -- and scream like a real Hungarian. He had a good temper.",
        "Q: And you had said in the interview that I saw that your -- your father was able to\ntrace your ancestors in Hungary back to the early --",
        "A: Well, when the troubles -- the -- yes --",
        "Q: -- 1700\u2019s.",
        "A: -- when the troubles started in the 30\u2019s, you had to trace your ancestry back as\nfar as you could go, because by 1938 - \u201939, they were picking up people who were\nnot so-called Hungarians. See, by that time we had a lot of people coming from\nSlovakia, from Poland, from other countries to Hungary, and they were mostly, I\nsuppose at that time looking for those people.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Little did we know that nothing 1s going to help. And yes, my father did trace\nour ancestry back into Hungary to the 1700\u2019s. On paper.",
        "Q: I want to jump around a little bit, cause again we\u2019re filling in little gaps in the\nprevious interview. You went to a Catholic school when it\u2019s --",
        "A: High school.",
        "Q: High school, 1939. I\u2019m curious, you had gone to Jewish schools prior to that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why not a Jewish high school? How did you end up there?",
        "A: There was no Jewish high school for girls, that\u2019s why.",
        "Q: So it was --",
        "A: And this was a specialized school, and unfortunately only the Catholic school\nsystem had it.",
        "Q: Specialized in what way\u201d?",
        "A: It\u2019s more of an art oriented high school.",
        "Q: And you were gifted in art?",
        "A: Sort of.",
        "Q: I understand you still --",
        "A: That was where we learned dress designing, tailoring, sewing, drawing, and all\nassociated with the arts.",
        "Q: Te-Tell me about friendships that you had in high school, both with Jewish girls\nand non-Jewish girls, if in fact you did have friendships with non-Jewish girls.",
        "A: Actually, well we had quite a few Jewish girls going to that same school where\nI went. I don\u2019t mean too many, but you know, those were very small classes\nactually, so they had maybe I don\u2019t know whether -- the first year I think maybe\nwe had about 10 Jewish girls, and after that they sort of left. They\u2019re maybe were\ntwo or three of them left altogether in the class, and -- but as far as non-Jewish\ngirls, other than being in the school with them no, I don\u2019t think I was really\nfriendly with any of them. That were strange over there, see, because we grew up\nseparated, you know, from early childhood, and we never mixed with non-Jewish\npeople. We only wil -- saw Jewish kids. So by the time you were a teenager in your\nlate teens in high school it\u2019s -- we were friendly but we were never really so-called\nfriends.",
        "Q: Was that by choice or by official design that you\u2019d -- you stayed amongst\nyourselves?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was a [indecipherable] really, it just the way it worked out.",
        "Q: Would you -- how would you -- I\u2019m thinking in terms of many American cities\nwhere blacks live on one side of town and whites live on another side of town,\nwhere -- whereas there might not at this time be a legal reason why they can\u2019t live\ntogether, they often don\u2019t, and I\u2019m wondering was it a similar situation or was it --",
        "A: No, no, no. There was one area where most -- were more dominated by Jewish\npeople, mostly by the real Orthodox and the Hassidic type of Jews, but other than\nthat, no. There was no area where you had to live.",
        "Q: That was my question.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay. Cause I know in some cities in Europe there had been the remnants of\nghettoes from previous eras.",
        "A: Shtetl, yes --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I know, and I\u2019ve been arguing that. I never lived in a shtetl, no.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was trying to establish.",
        "A: At least not in my time in Hungary, no.",
        "Q: Okay. So you did not have friends with non-Jewish kids that you were clo --",
        "A: Not close friends, no. But by the time I got to that high school, it was already\ntroubled times. Hitler was already on the horizons and as sweet as the nuns were --\nthere were a couple of them who were wonderful, and I really think of them highly\nforever, because they were nice human beings. But then there were others who just\nas soon would have hand me over to the first Nazi who came about.",
        "Q: Tell me about them. What -- what memories do you have of these nuns that you\ngot that feeling about?",
        "A: Well, I remember especially the one nun -- you know, it -- I mean, you go to a\nCatholic school and there\u2019s -- during the time you go and you have to say some\nkind of a prayer, at least in those days they did, and I remember at one time this\nparticular nun came up to me and said, you better go down on your knee and pray\nbecause what\u2019s happening out in the world. And in those days a lot of Jewish\npeople did convert to Catholicism and -- hoping it will save them, but nothing did.\nNothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in Hungary centuries\nback -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back, so it didn\u2019t\nhelp. I remember when we were in the wagon already, there was a young woman\ndoctor with us, she never knew she was Jewish. Her parents converted during the\nfirst World War or right after, so she was born, you know, as Christian. And yet\nshe was considered a Jew.",
        "Q: This -- so this nun that told you you better get on your knees, wa -- I\u2019m unclear,\nwas she saying that with malice or with concern?",
        "A: No, I think it was malice and no concern, because if it would have been\nconcern, I probably wouldn\u2019t remember it the way I do.",
        "Q: What about the other kids? You intimated in your previous interview that you\nhad experienced some -- some anti-Semitic --",
        "A: Well, while we were in the class it was fine, there was no problem. Well, the\nthing I mentioned then, I believe it was that when we were being marched from the\nghetto to the brick factory, there was one of the girls that I went to school with and\nI used to walk with her home from school, and she thought of nothing picking up a\nstone and throw it at me. See, people -- we were walking in the middle of the road\nand the people were standing on both sides on the sidewalk and watching us\nleaving town.",
        "Q: But back when you were going to school, what did you experience in terms of\nany -- or did you -- any problems with any of the other Gentile girls?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any, really.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s talk about the conditions of your deportation from your hometown.\nW -- How did that come about? You -- you rushed through it a little bit in your\nprevious interview. I mean, how did you find out that it was going to happen and\nwhat -- could you tell us, sort of take us through from when you found out that it\nwas going to happen til when you were actually --",
        "A: [indecipherable] okay, let me go back to the Jewish school, 1938, when our\nprincipal came into the class -- well, I guess he went to every class, to tell us\nwhat\u2019s happening in the world and what we may accep -- expect. And he had -- a\nbig guy, and he had tears in his eye -- his eyes as he was talking to us. That was\n1938, and I think s -- well, at first -- after that 1t was getting harder to hold a job if\nyou were a Jew. I remember in 1939 it was when my father lost his job, he was a --\na district manager for a -- a farm machinery company, and he lost his job because\nhe was a Jew. And then 1942 -- well, in 1939, when Hitler gave back the northern\npart of Hungary that belonged to Czechoslovakia, and that time to Hungary. And\nmy father was in a uniform, the Hungarian army\u2019s uniform. He fought in the first\nWorld War, so he was called up again to pay the country back. And by 1941 he\nwas called into labor camp, \u201941 - \u201942 then they let him out for awhile and then they\n-- took him back again. In 1944, March 19\", it was on a Sunday afternoon when\nthe Germans -- German army flew over Hungary. I can still see it, it was a dreary,\nnasty day. No sunshine at all, and I guess it was foreboding of what was coming.\nAnd we saw the plane fly over our city and after that it went one, two, three. They\ncame in on the 19\". By April fifth we had to put on the Jewish star. May sixth we\nwere put into the ghetto. I was watching them building the six foot high wall all\naround the area. In my town, in Debrecen, they had to make two different ghettos\nbecause there was a main road going to the railroad station which they couldn\u2019t cut\noff. So there was a smaller side where we lived and there was a larger side on the\nother side. So our house happened to be in the smaller area, so that\u2019s where we\nwere. And to the day the wall was finished we did not believe it, that it will\nhappen. It was impossible, we lived there forever. I was born there, I grew up\nthere. People were hoping that the mayor of the city, little did they know that he\nhad no say so, won\u2019t let it happen. But at any rate, May 6, 1944, we were locked\ninto the ghetto. And in June --",
        "Q: I hate -- I hate to say it, we are going to need to do something about the phone.",
        "A: Well, the only thing you can do 1s just take it off.",
        "Q: Would you trust me -- Ill be happy to put it back the way it was.",
        "A: Just take it off.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And just let -- [tape break]",
        "Q: All right. One small thing, and that is, 1f you could make an effort not to put\nyour hands in front of the microphone. I mean --",
        "A: Pll try.",
        "Q: -- only -- there were -- there were -- there was one time when you were putting\nyour hands like so.",
        "A: I was coughing, I didn\u2019t want to cough into the microphone.",
        "Q: No, you were just telling a story and you had your hands --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: So if you could just -- don\u2019t be too self conscious, but just be aware --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: -- that if you put your hand in front of it --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- it creates a problem. Okay, so you were locked into the ghetto. My question\nis, when did you find out that you were going to be deported, and how did that\ncome about? How --",
        "A: Well when we found out --",
        "Q: And how did you find out, and were there others deported before you and was it\nsomething you were expecting, or --",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know what to expect. To this day we don\u2019t know how we didn\u2019t\nknow, but we did not know what to expect. The way we found out we were gonna\ngo was a Sunday morning that the people came in with the loudspeaker, walked\nthrough the stra -- the streets, it was Sunday morning and th -- they said start\npacking because by the afternoon you all have to be at the other side in the big\nghetto. And then we knew. I mean ho-how long can you stay stupid, right? I mean,\nyou had to know something was happening. My father wasn\u2019t home and there we\nwere, my mother and the four of us and a -- a little cousin of mine, my mother\u2019s\nnephew, her sister\u2019s son who came with us to live. And that\u2019s it. We started to pack\nwhatever we could and by noon people were coming into the house to make sure\nthat we\u2019re not taking anything valuable with us. So much so that there were two\nguys and one woman who came to the house, and the woman took my mother into\nthe bedroom to check her inside, literally, her inside, to make sure that she is not\nhiding anything 1n her body that\u2019s valuable. And the afternoon we were over at the\nother side. And that was that. That was Sunday afternoon and then, for a strange\nreason, luckily, they brought my father back with a bunch of other people in his\ngroup. So at that point in time we were all together. My family and a -- a brother of\nmy mother -- father and her -- his sister. And another cousin of mine.",
        "Q: But my question is, what was it like when they took you away from your\nhometown?",
        "A: From my hometown --",
        "Q: Yes --",
        "A: -- or from the ghetto?",
        "Q: From the ghetto. When -- when you left --",
        "A: Well, we were in our home. After that we were homeless.",
        "Q: Wh-When you were --",
        "A: We were homeless. That\u2019s what we were.",
        "Q: -- when you were taken fr-from the ghetto and you were --",
        "A: And then we stayed on the other side. Not long, maybe a few days, I\u2019m not -- I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly what it was, four or five days maybe. And they were --\nthat\u2019s when we were walking to the brick factory. And we stayed there for about a\nweek or so, and that was a horror. That was absolute horror. We had to get into\ngroups every day and walk down to the railroad tracks and wait in case we were\ngoing to be taken someplace. We didn\u2019t know where, but we were going to be\ntaken someplace. And then they started to group people together, and we ended up\nin a group, they had many children in the families. And I think I was the fifth or\nsixth there and finally they put us into the wagons and we started off. We went to\nthe border of Hungary and Slovakia and I remember there was one of the\nHungarian gendars who was on the -- standing on the back of the train. I guess,\nnow in looking back I think the wagons, the car we were in, the cattle car we were\nin must have been the last one. Either that or each one of them had one of those\nguys standing there, traveling with us. And that guy, I remember when it -- they\nstart the train and he said to us, that\u2019s as far as I can go with you. God be with you.\nSo he must have been somebody with a little heart, or maybe he knew where we\nwere supposed to be going. And that was that and I remember at that point I had\nthe feeling that this is it, you know, all of a sudden it just hit that I\u2019ll probably\nnever get out of the cattle car alive. And some miracle happened, for some reason\nwe Stayed there overnight and the train didn\u2019t move and th -- early in the morning\nit started to roll again and we were looking through the cracks which way we\u2019re\ngoing and we were going back into Hungary, we were in the middle of Hungary.\nNext we knew we start to now s -- go to Budapest. And soon after that we kept\ngoing and we crossed the border to Austria and -- and there we were. We ended up\nin Austria.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s step back a little bit. What was th-the transport like in the car? What was\nthe -- I know it wasn\u2019t very pleasant, but can you describe what the -- what it was\nlike?",
        "A: Well, if you can imagine -- you know what a cattle car looks like? Okay. Can\nyou imagine that filled with about a hundred people or more? Families, children,\nold people. Small children, some who were lame and not able to move readily, you\nknow, that sort of thing.",
        "Q: Did people stand, sit, lie down?",
        "A: Whatever you were able to do, that\u2019s what you did.",
        "Q: And wh-what did you do for water, or relieving yourself, or --",
        "A: Well, they -- they -- we had a bucket of water and we had a bucket for other\nthings, and I remember when we start around the outskirt of Budapest, they gave us\nsome fresh water there, and that was it. We were very lucky because we didn\u2019t stay\nin the wagon very long. It was just one of those freak things that you don\u2019t have an\nanswer for.",
        "Q: In your -- in your interview that I saw and read the transcript of, you say that\nyou were supposed to have gone to Auschwitz.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: How did you learn that, that you were supposed to have -- that that train --",
        "A: Well, everybody was supposed to go to Auschwitz. Now we found out here in\nthe United States already, just a few years ago, there 1s a -- a historian, a Hungarian\nman, he teaches now at New York University. He wrote a book called, \u201cThe\nGenocide of the Hungarian Jews.\u201d You may have heard of it. And he found out\nthat at that point, where we were supposed to be crossing into Poland -- now we\nwere told at the time they couldn\u2019t take us through because they bombed the\nviaduct and the [indecipherable] the train couldn't get through. But what he found\nout was that there was a group of people who made a deal with the Germans to be\ntaken out of Hungary from Budapest, or wherever, from all over the country. And\nsomebody made a mistake who was directing the -- the cattle cars, and by the time\nthey realized that they took those people on the way to Auschwitz and called\nEichmann, the -- the trainload was too far gone to bring them back. And\nsupposedly Eichmann told him, whoever was in charge, to find another group with\nthe same amount of people in it and take them to Austria. And supposedly that was\nthe group we were in.",
        "Q: What did you know ahead of time? What had filtered through to your\ncommunity about what was going on and -- I mean, did you -- did you through the\ngrapevine hear -- learn things? Did you listen to the shortwave?",
        "A: We listened -- we listened to the English radio, we listened to the American\nradio. To the very last day we were hoping and praying that Mr. Roosevelt will\ncome and save us. Well, Mr. Roosevelt didn\u2019t come to save us. As wonderful a\nman as he was, but that he didn\u2019t do. We knew there was trouble, because by 1940\n- \u00b041, many, many, many Slovakian Jewish people were in Hungary. They all were\nrunning away from Slovakia, only to be caught in Hungary.",
        "Q: Had you -- I guess my question is, by the time you were on that train,\nsupposedly for Auschwitz, what did you know of -- about the camps or -- or how\npeople were being killed? Did you know any of that?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Agnes Vogel. This is tape number one, side B. What was life like --\nI\u2019m jumping ahead now with the questions, these follow-up questions, in -- 1s it\nStrasoff?",
        "A: Strasoff.",
        "Q: Strasoff, before the war ended. What was the conditions like there?",
        "A: Right before the war ended? That was terrible. See, luckily we didn\u2019t spend too\nmuch time over there, but a short time, about a month and a half while we were\nthere, that was bad. There was no food practically. Sanitary conditions were awful.\nIt was cold. That was bad.",
        "Q: Was there any sort of organizational structure amongst the --",
        "A: We had no time for that. We had no time for that. See this -- this camp wasn\u2019t\nlike Auschwitz. We saw no killing over there. There was one day when the put us\ninto the wagons and we were to be taken to Bergen-Belsen. And that was the only\ncruelty that I saw, when one of those guards, a woman, a Ukrainian woman guard\nhit my father on the head with a bat of some sort, a piece of wood, because he\ncouldn\u2019t run fast enough for her. But other than that there was no other what you\nwould call, you know, cruelty like you hear from people who were in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: Where were your sisters during this time? Were they --",
        "A: We were all together.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We left our house together and we came back together.",
        "Q: How did you decide to return home after the war? Was it an automatic decision,\ndid you -- was there any debate?",
        "A: It was decided for us, we had no other way to go. When we were -- we were\nliberated April 10\u201c when the Russians came in and a few [indecipherable] to the\nwest they were still fighting, so there was no way to go except back where we\ncame from.",
        "Q: Were you at all apprehensive about going back there?",
        "A: Oh, of course we were. Then we were leaving -- we were told to leave. There\nwas no choice, we were told to leave because they had to burn down the camp, it\nwas in such an awful condition that that had to be burned.",
        "Q: So at that time there were no displaced person camps or any place --",
        "A: Not for us, no, no. See, there was still fighting, the war wasn\u2019t over yet, and\nthen we were liberated.",
        "Q: So you went back to your hometown. What was it like -- you\u2019ve de -- you\u2019ve\ndescribed about -- well, first let me ask you how long was that trip from the --",
        "A: That trip? Over a week. We walked on foot. We somewhere along the line\nmanaged to get a wagon with a horse. So some of the people who couldn't do\nwalking well enough -- see, I had a cousin of mine who had polio since he was a\nsmall child, he was two years old and he had polio and he never walked. And so\nsome of those people were sitting on top of the wagon and the rest of us walked.\nWe walked this way and the Russian soldiers came that way.",
        "Q: For -- what -- what did you eat for a week?",
        "A: What did we eat? Well, we stopped at different farmhouses and whatever we\ncould find, we took.",
        "Q: So they were vacant?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: The-These farmhouses were vacant?",
        "A: Most of them, yeah. They left so fast they even left the hot food on the table.",
        "Q: And why did they leave?",
        "A: Be -- they were afraid of the Russians, of course.",
        "Q: When you -- when you got back to -- 1s 1t Debrecen, how do you pronounce --",
        "A: Debrecen.",
        "Q: Debrecen. I -- I understand from the interview you gave before that you were\nreceived very poorly by the people who were left there, that they were not --",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say all the people, but when we got off the train 1n the station\nand we were walking the main street towards our home, and they looked at us --\nbut then, these were young people, not older, young people, they greeted us, you\nknow, how come -- what are you doing back here? You were supposed to be dead.",
        "Q: You said not everybody was like that. Can you tell me more about the varieties\nof different reactions that you might have gotten from --",
        "A: You know, it was such a long time ago and what I can remember is there was\nreally no time to look at reactions because we had nothing on our body except the\nclothes we left a year ago -- a year before that. And th -- you know, our first -- we\nwalked into the house and there was nothing there. It was totally empty, everything\nwas taken out. So our first priority was to look around and see if we can start a new\nlife. So there was even no time to look and see what people thought and how they\nreacted.",
        "Q: How -- just so I get an idea before I ask you the next several questions, how\nlong were you there before you made the decision to leave the country?",
        "A: Well, we got back there in 1945, May, and I think by end of the year I decided\nthat I had to leave.",
        "Q: So a little over six months you were there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What --",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t convince my family to leave in the same time, because, see my\nmother have -- had at that time two sisters over here and lots of relatives. And I\nmust say they were very nice, they sn -- you know, send the papers right away and\neverything that they needed to do, they did, to get us over here as a family. But it\ntook longer than I had patience for, and I wanted to leave.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s step back a little bit before that, I -- I\u2019d like to talk to you about what life\nwas like there in your hometown before you decided to leave. You say you were\nthere for about six months or so. How did you -- you -- you came back home,\nthere\u2019s noth -- not a st -- there\u2019s no furniture, there\u2019s no nothing, you --",
        "A: Well, we came back home and you were looking for people you knew before, to\nsee if anybody came back, my uncle, my aunt\u2019s husband wasn\u2019t with us, he was in\na labor camp someplace. Luckily he survived and he came back. Yet her son, who\nwas somewhere in Germany, never made it back home. So we used to go every day\nto the center point of the Jewish life over there in that time, that was hastily put\ntogether, to look at names who they found and you know, who was alive. And that\nwas that.",
        "Q: But you had no money, you had no belongings.",
        "A: We had no money.",
        "Q: How did you get by, what did you eat? How did --",
        "A: [indecipherable] well, there was a place called the Joint Distribution\nCommittee, if you ever heard of it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they gave us some clothes, they gave us a little money to get started with.\nAnd the rest we just, I don\u2019t know, see, I -- I had my parents. I had my father. He\ntook care of all that.",
        "Q: Di-Did he find work?",
        "A: He must have, some kind of a work, because eventually he did do something to\nprovide for us.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t remember what?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Did you see when you went back, former schoolmates f -- I\u2019m ta -- I\u2019m thinking\nof Gentile folks that you would have known before you were put into the ghetto\nand before you were taken away?",
        "A: No, not any of my classmates, no. See, it was a total chaos when we went back,\nit was still soon after really, so-called liberation. Everything was in chaos. The\nschool I -- the Catholic school I went to was disbanded, there were no more nuns\naround. It was -- I don\u2019t know, everybody was everywhere.",
        "Q: Of the Jewish population in your hometown, were you all on that one train that\nwas turned around?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, they -- they took 12,000 [indecipherable] the population of\n12,000 Jewish people in that city. That city wa -- had a population of the w -- at\nthat time about 120,000 people, and 10 percent were the Jewish population.",
        "Q: And who -- how many made it back alive?",
        "A: Not a whole lot.",
        "Q: Roughly, do you know -- have any idea?",
        "A: See, the transport we were in was they weren't only from Hungary -- from\nDebrecen, they brought people over there from outlying areas in different stories.\nSo we had people with us from Szolnok, we had people with us from Szeged, from\nMiskolc, from all over the place. That was, I guess, the biggest city around and so\nthey brought people over there.",
        "Q: But do you have any idea from reading or speaking with people s-since the war\nhas ended, any notion of how many people survived from your hometown, of the\nJewish population, roughly?",
        "A: I have a book, I could -- I could look it up for you.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t worry about it.",
        "A: But I\u2019m really not sure. Not -- not too many, I know that.",
        "Q: So what was it like for you to come back to your hometown that had treated you\nbadly, if a -- if I\u2019m making sense, to come back to the same people who had been\npersecuting you beforehand and to come back and there being such a small number\nof Jews that were left and I guess -- maybe I\u2019m asking a -- an inappropriate\nquestion, that it sounds like your concerns were much more concrete, day to day,\nwhat you were going to eat, how were you going to get by. But I guess I\u2019m just\nwondering what it was like to come back to your hometown in this chaos and such\na different place than you grew up. Was it -- had many other people left?",
        "A: Everybody.",
        "Q: You mean, escaping from the -- the Russians, or --",
        "A: You mean the --",
        "Q: I mean the --",
        "A: -- people who came back?",
        "Q: No, what I\u2019m really referring to 1s Gentiles from the town. Had they -- was it\npretty much intact?",
        "A: Oh, that part of it was -- th-they all stayed. No, they didn\u2019t leave.",
        "Q: Okay, cause you were talking about the people in the countryside that had\nabandoned their farms with the --",
        "A: That was in Austria.",
        "Q: Okay. So you decided to leave, let\u2019s go to that part of it. How is it that you -- t-\ntell me about your decision to leave and why you decided to leave when the rest of\nyour family was staying.",
        "A: Well, for one thing, since I was the oldest in the family -- I saw no future there,\nfor one thing. And I always, since I was a little girl, I always wanted to come to the\nUnited States of America.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: \u2019'm not sure exactly why, but I -- at the -- you know, when I was little child, I\ndon\u2019t know why, because I heard my parents talk about it so much and we have --\nwe had so many relatives already here. And that sounded like an exciting place to\nlive. So after the war I had a choice of either going to Israel, where I also had\nrelatives, because my father\u2019s whole family was in Israel by that time, including\nmy grandparents. And -- or come to the United States. And since my mother had\ntwo sisters who were here and they ask me, they says, please go to the United\nStates because I want to go there someday too and be with -- be with my sisters.\nAnd they were very nice people, they send me the appropriate papers and here I\nam.",
        "Q: I want to -- I want to ask you in more detail about that, cause not many other\npeople, it wasn\u2019t so easy, in terms of, you know, immigration quotas and other\nproblems. How long -- when did you -- whe -- from when you decided to come, til\nyou actually came, how long did it take to -- to --",
        "A: About two years. Close to two years.",
        "Q: And what did you do in the interim? Did you spend all that time there in\nDebrecen?",
        "A: No, no, I stayed in Hungary til the very end of 1946, yeah, I worked a little bit.",
        "Q: What did you do?",
        "A: What did I do? It\u2019s a good question. See, by that time they had a very good\nZionist organization built up already and a lot of young people coming and they\nhad all sorts of offices there, and I worked in one of those places there. And for --\nend of \u201946, in December, or -- yeah, and then I left. And then I went to France, I st\n-- | stayed 1n Paris for about eight weeks until I could get in a ship and then I came.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s step back a little bit, so you spent all told about a year and a half in\nHungary before you went to Paris and then eventually to the U.S.?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: I guess I\u2019m trying to get a feel for a daily life for you then. What -- what did\nyou do? What --di-did you have friends, did you simply do things with your\nfamily?",
        "A: I had lots of friends.",
        "Q: I\u2019m -- I\u2019m trying to get a f --",
        "A: There was lot of young people who came back from labor camps, from\nAuschwitz without anybody, without their families. So what -- those were busy\ntimes. If you could do away with all the other events that led up to that, that could\nhave been a very nice time. But you know, that sort of thing lingering in the back\nof your mind, I tried to make the most of it. And everybody was trying to look for a\nway to get out.",
        "Q: When you say busy times, you tried to make the most of it, I\u2019m trying to get a\nfeel for what it was like for life to begin to get back to something resembling\nnormal. What -- wh-wha -- socially, what did you do? What -- when you --",
        "A: Well, like I said, [indecipherable] there were a lot of young people coming back\nand I had a lot of friends, and most of my friends, by the way, ended up in -- in\nIsrael. [indecipherable] I was friends with. And they were just, I guess, for lack of\na better word, trying to bide our time until we could find a way to get out, is what it\nwas.",
        "Q: So everybody was looking to leave somewhere?",
        "A: Everybody was looking to, there was no -- no future there.",
        "Q: Were there -- were those pretty much the choices, or were -- me-meaning the\nU.S. or Israel. Were people looking to go to Australia or other parts of the world?",
        "A: Some people did, it depends, you know, where you had connections, or where\nyour interests were. Or whether -- where your luck was, really, to get you wherever\nyou wanted to go.",
        "Q: Did you have -- let me ask you about friends of yours, or extended relatives. I\nthink you\u2019ve pretty much told me about your extended relatives and what happened\nto them, but did you have friends that died?",
        "A: Oh yeah, quite a few didn\u2019t come back. Yes, and some who even died before\nbecause they were taken to labor camp.",
        "Q: Close friends?",
        "A: Some.",
        "Q: So you got to Paris, train? From Hungary to Paris, did you take a train?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And where did you stay when you were there? You said eight weeks to wait for\nyour papers to come through and to get a ship.",
        "A: Well, see, what happened is my father took me to Budapest, put me on the train\nand then before the train left, he went around and see if he could find somebody\nwho was going the same way as I was. And sure enough, he did find a young lady,\nsomewhat older than myself at that time, who not only was coming to Paris, but\nalso was going to the United States of America. Not only to the States, but going to\nthe same city that I was going to and to the same neighborhood where I was going\nto.",
        "Q: Detroit?",
        "A: Detroit, Michigan, yes. To the same area where my family lived, and so we\nbecame sort of fast friends and he -- she took care of me. I stayed with her in the\nsame hotel while we were in Paris and he -- she left a few weeks before I did. But\nshe had a nephew over there who was a concert violinist and he\u2019s been living in\nParis for some time by then. So she put him in charge of me, so to speak. So I was\nwell taken care of until I got on the ship and my family took me off in the city of\nNew York.",
        "Q: What was it like -- where -- on the ship coming over, were there other Jews that\nwere coming -- immigrating?",
        "A: There were a lot of Jewish people coming, yes. Some were going to Cuba, some\nto the United States and some Mexico and they were going all over the place.",
        "Q: Do you remember at all how you felt -- I me -- that was th-that trip, about how\nlong did it take?",
        "A: About five days, I believe.",
        "Q: Were you fearful, anxious, excited? How were you -- do you remember at all\nwhat -- what it was like? I mean, you di -- here, you\u2019ve left your entire family\nbehind, this whole horrible experience --",
        "A: But see, I left my family behind in the hope that within a year\u2019s time I would be\nwith them also. So I didn\u2019t just walk out on them. But I guess it wasn\u2019t mean to be\nbecause not even a year -- before the year was up after I left, I -- they closed the\nborders and nobody ever left from there until 1956.",
        "Q: Who closed the borders? Who closed --",
        "A: Who closed the border? The Russians.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t come to join you.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t leave, when every -- everything stopped.\nAnd by 1956, my parents became ill, my father had a couple of heart attacks. My\nmother came down with th-the Parkinson disease and there was no way for them to\nleave. And this is why my youngest sister left home -- I mean, stayed home in\n1956, because the other two were already married, and she was still single, being\nthe youngest. She was just a young girl. When I came out here, I remember I used\nto send her money to take dance classes and I used to send -- I sent her money to\nbuy a bicycle when I started to work. And she was the victim of it all.",
        "Q: And she stayed there.",
        "A: She stayed there and she\u2019s still there.",
        "Q: In -- in --",
        "A: That\u2019s 1997, right?",
        "Q: In -- in the same town?",
        "A: In the same town, yes. My parents are gone and she\u2019s still there.",
        "Q: Do you have any other extended family that still live there?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Cousins, or --",
        "A: No, I had two -- I had three cousins who came back from Auschwitz. See, my\nmother\u2019s whole family ended up in Auschwitz, I had four aunts -- five. One, two --\nfour -- four aunts and an uncle who all perished in Auschwitz. And some younger\ncousins who were just small children, and the three who survived were, you know,\nyoung adults, and they made it.",
        "Q: So these were all siblings of your mother?",
        "A: Yeah, from my mother\u2019s side, yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember at all how she came to learn that and what that was like for\nher to learn wa -- that all -- was that --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- all of her siblings?",
        "A: -- to see -- my cousins, all three of them were home long before we got home\nbecause Auschwitz was liberated in January and we didn\u2019t get home til April. And\nthey came to see us and that\u2019s how we found out what happened.",
        "Q: Was that all of her siblings?",
        "A: Mm-hm, except the two sisters [indecipherable] she had here in the United\nStates.",
        "Q: Do you remember what that was like, her -- I mean, how she dealt with learning\nthat?",
        "A: That was hard. That was hard, but there was no other thing to do but deal with\nit. You know, there is an interesting thing that I remember, when they were taking\nthe people, the first transport from Hungary to Auschwitz and there was -- my\nmother\u2019s family were among the group, and I remember my mother walk up\n[indecipherable] and said, I had a terrible dream. She had a dream seeing the\nfamily walking down the road and there were two rows of candles on each side of\nthem, lit, as they were walking down the road. Now by the time we got home it\nwas more or less a fact.",
        "Q: How did you fi -- di -- I mean, how did you feel about this? Did you -- I mean,\ndid your family grieve, did -- did you grieve, did you -- was there time for\ngrieving?",
        "A: There was really no time to grieve like you do nowadays when somebody dies.\nYou had to keep alive. You were alive, you had to go on. But I think you never\nreally stop grieving. That\u2019s also just part of our life.",
        "Q: You came to New York on the ship. Do you remember what it was like the first\ntime you saw New York, the first time you saw America?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: It was overwhelming. I\u2019ve never seen such big buildings in my life. Oops. It\nwas exciting, it was unbelievable. I think I must have felt like Alice in Wonderland\nwhen I got off the boat.",
        "Q: Were you emotional, was it --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m a very emotional person so I guess I -- that was just exciting.",
        "Q: This may be a kind of a clich\u00e9, but I\u2019ve spoken to other people who have made\nthat trip who were very affected by the Statue of Liberty and you know, all of that\nand I was wondering if that had any impact at all or was it just [indecipherable]",
        "A: I guess, the fact, it probably did. I remember -- oops -- oh, I have to go back a\nlittle bit.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: On the way to -- from Paris to the ship, you know you take a little boat that\ncarries you out there to the sea. And there was a couple, an older couple sitting\nacross from me and there I was sitting all by myself with a little book of English\nand Hungarian translation and I tried to read and brush up of whatever English I\nknew. And they were trying to find out who I was and what does a young girl do\non a boat like this all by herself and where I came from and where I\u2019m going and\nthey tried to talk to me and up until that point I thought I could speak English.\nWell, when I heard them talk, forget it. I didn\u2019t understand almost [indecipherable]\nwhat they\u2019re saying. So I found out eventually that they were from Brooklyn\nvisiting Europe and coming back from Europe and they were very sweet people,\nthey took me under their arm. When they found out I was from Hungary, they went\nall over the boat searching for a person, another person from Hungary I can be with\nthrough the trip so I won\u2019t be lost. As it happened there were quite a few\nHungarians there, Jews and non-Jews. And the person they found for me to be with\nand eat, you know, the meals with, was a non-Jewish person, a guy from\nCleveland, of all places, who took his wife to Hungary because she was sick and\ntook her there for some kind of treatment and he was coming back to the States.\nAnd when we got to New York, this lady from Brooklyn grabbed my arm and\npulled me out to the, you know, end of the wherever there was in the boat. They\nsays, hey look, look, that\u2019s the Statue of Liberty. So that was my introduction to\nthe Statue of Liberty.",
        "Q: Let me just move that [indecipherable]. Did you -- let\u2019s see, how can I phrase\nthis question? Given what you had just been through in Europe, was it difficult for\nyou to be around non-Jewish people, period? Were you afraid of them, were you\nconcerned? I guess what I\u2019m trying to ask you Is --",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No. Do you mind if I [indecipherable]",
        "Q: No, not at -- not at all, not at all.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Agnes Vogel. This is tape number two, side A. I was just asking\nyou, cause I\u2019ve heard from -- from other survivors who felt very leery to be around\nGentiles when they -- when the war was over because they had been turned on by\nall the Gentiles in their life prior to that and -- and so they had a hard time trusting\nthat it wouldn\u2019t happen again. And so that\u2019s why I asked the question.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m different, but I never really had too many\nchances to be with Gentiles, because when we got to Paris, I had some friends\nalready there from home whom I met, they were all Jewish people, young -- young\npeople. So I had no reason to get friendly or get close to any of the Gentiles. And\nwhen I got to the United States my family didn\u2019t -- weren\u2019t friends with any\nGentiles. So again, I didn\u2019t have a chance to meet any.",
        "Q: Your family met you when the boat came in in New York.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Now refresh my memory, did you -- you had -- did you have relatives there in\nNew York or is everybody in Detroit?",
        "A: No, they came from Detroit. I did have a relative from New York, it\u2019s a cousin\nof my mother whom my aunt and uncle took me to visit, and they lived on Park\nAvenue someplace in a huge apartment with a beautiful, big, brown dog. And they\nwere very lovely people. They were very impressed the way I looked, coming from\nwhere I came from, and that was that. I never saw them again after that.",
        "Q: Was it at all emotional, your family that you\u2019d never met, I\u2019m assuming --",
        "A: No, not too --",
        "Q: -- coming to meet you?",
        "A: Emotionally what way?",
        "Q: Well, for some other people, coming over here and meeting up with relatives\nwas a big deal for them, for both sides. For the -- for the -- the American relatives,\ndo you know, to be --",
        "A: [indecipherable] with my -- my aunt and my uncle, yes it was a little bit\nemotional, but with the cousins, these were already second, third generation\nAmericans. They [indecipherable] They lived their life and that was a lot of story.",
        "Q: You said second or third generation Americans, who -- who would have c --\nwho of your ancestors would have come over that long before?",
        "A: Well my -- oh well, before the tur -- way before the turn of the cen -- middle of\nthe last century --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- they were coming over here, the uncles of my parents.",
        "Q: Okay. So in addition to your --",
        "A: A-Aunts and uncles and --",
        "Q: So you had quite a few relatives here, not just your mother\u2019s sisters. Okay. How\nd -- did you spend much time in New York, or -- or did you go directly with them\non to Michigan?",
        "A: No, not a whole lot, because they had to come back. See, I arrived here in\nMarch and at that time I think the tax time was in March in those days, if I\nremember right. Also, my -- one of my cousins, my aunt\u2019s daughter who picked me\nup had her birthday in March, so they had to come home, you know, for those\nreasons. But we drove -- they drove into New York, so we drove back and we\nstopped on the way in Scranton, Pennsylvania to visit another cousin of my\nparents, lovely, lovely people. And then we came home, or we came to Detroit.",
        "Q: Now they obviously spoke Hungarian, your --",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: They obviously spoke Hungarian --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- your -- your aunts.",
        "A: Oh yes, they still do.",
        "Q: And the -- the men that they married, were they Americans, were they\nHungarians as well, the -- were they married?",
        "A: Oh yes, they all had families.",
        "Q: And where had -- where did these men come from?",
        "A: Where did what?",
        "Q: Your uncles, where did they come from?",
        "A: They were also Hungarians.",
        "Q: Okay, cause I was wondering about you -- the language problem. You had poor\nEnglish, you\u2019ve already told us, when you went over -- when you came here, and I\nwas wondering what it was like for you to start to --",
        "A: It\u2019s not so much that I had poor English, because I -- I did take English lessons\nand I wrote -- as far as writing, I wrote very nice letters. My family in Detroit\ncouldn\u2019t wait for me to get here. But also, I am a rather -- well, what\u2019s the word\nthat I want to use? Bashful? And I don\u2019t like to be laughed at. And so I tried when I\ngot here, but then a few of -- little teasing and I clammed up. And I spoke no\nEnglish until I met my husband-to-be.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unusual thing. My mother has told me similar things, that\nuntil she learned English well, she was uncomfortable speaking it, just for that very\nreason.",
        "A: But then you can\u2019t learn it well unless you start talking.",
        "Q: Right. It\u2019s a problem.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, when you got to Detroit -- you were how old by this time?",
        "A: I was 20.",
        "Q: 20. What -- what did you do? What --",
        "A: Well, six weeks after I was here I went to work, they found me a job.",
        "Q: Doing?",
        "A: Ata tailor shop. Men\u2019s -- it was a men\u2019s shop, actually.",
        "Q: And you were d-doing alterations, or --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you lived with them, with your -- were there cousins your age, or similar,\nor --",
        "A: Well, close to my age.",
        "Q: Younger, older?",
        "A: [indecipherable] not exactly my age, but you know [indecipherable] here and\nthere, and most of them were younger.",
        "Q: Did you -- tell me about your first experiences with -- dealing with Americans\nother than your -- your family, who were immigrants as well, like -- like the people\nat the tailor shop were -- how did you --",
        "A: They were actually very nice people and there was a very nice lady, a nice\nPolish lady who worked there also. And she was as sweet as can be. I guess I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m really lucky because I fel -- I -- I met very few nasty people on the road.\nEventually I -- I did find some of the younger American girls, the so-called -- well,\nI don\u2019t want to say the American princess, but you know, that -- those type of girls.\nThey had no patience for me. I couldn\u2019t speak their language, so that was -- you\nknow, but that was fine, I really didn\u2019t need them because there were a lot of\npeople like myself in Detroit at the time and we had a nice group of people we\nwere friends with.",
        "Q: When you say like yourself, other immigrants, or --",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you develop friendships with native born people?",
        "A: Mm, not right away. Well, maybe one couple.",
        "Q: And how would you get to know people with these -- did you -- did you go to\nsynagogue here? Were they people in -- 1n the -- that lived in the neighborhood,\nwere th -- with work?",
        "A: Well, over there in those days -- well, through the families. See, most of the\nHungarian families, you know, they all had somebody who survived and coming\nover. So that\u2019s how we met. And then there was the Jewish center in Detroit, that\nwas the center point of going to school over there and meeting people. They just\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: You said going to school, did you pursue school?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "Q: Well, tell me about that.",
        "A: Well not -- I went -- at the beginning I went to the Jewish Center to take some\nEnglish classes and then I met my husband, then that was -- you know, life became\na whole different thing.",
        "Q: How did you -- how did you meet and when did you meet? How long were you\nhere before you met him?",
        "A: Well, I came in March and I met him, I think, a few months later at the Jewish\nCenter. He came in to say hello to the teacher and then he looked around the class\nand he -- when the class was over he was outside of the door.",
        "Q: And?",
        "A: And that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: He was outside the door, and?",
        "A: And was -- you know, we -- he walked me home after that and he -- we started\nto see each other and that was that.",
        "Q: How long did you court?",
        "A: Well, we met in -- let\u2019s see, maybe in April, May, and we got married in\nFebruary next year, following year.",
        "Q: In Detroit?",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Now he had also an aunt or uncle here, is that right?",
        "A: He had one aunt.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I thought.",
        "A: That\u2019s the only relative that he has.",
        "Q: That -- that made it. That\u2019s what I thought. Did you, during the time that you\nwere courting, talk much about your respective experiences in the war?",
        "A: Some. Probably not enough.",
        "Q: What do you mean by that?",
        "A: Well, what I mean is, we were mostly trying to look ahead, not back, if 1t makes\nany sense.",
        "Q: Mm, I understand that, but you said probably not enough, the implication being\nthat there should have been more.",
        "A: That ch -- maybe, but I don\u2019t think at that time he could have taken any more of\nit. There had to be a time to [indecipherable]. We needed time to sort of settle\ndown and live. Look at life instead of that. Eventually it came true and now we\u2019re\nat the point where we almost talk about nothing else but.",
        "Q: We'll get to that. That seems to be a very consistent experience of people, that\nthere was a -- a period of time, sometimes a very long period of time where it was\nnot comfortable to talk about 1t amongst themselves, or with others.",
        "A: It\u2019s not so much that it wasn\u2019t ca -- well, first of all -- let me just go back a little\nbit. I know when I came out here I had the grandiose notion, you know, that\neverybody wants to hear my story so Ill be going around and talking about it.\nNobody want to hear the story, come on. We were kidding ourselves. Even my\nown family, who lost so many members, close family, you try to talk to them, they\nwould change the subject. They couldn\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t bear listening to it.",
        "Q: But you tried?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: So it sounds like --",
        "A: So then you just gave up. I mean, there was no sense of talking because nobody\n-- first of all, nobody could really understand what we went through. We could tell\nthem from morning til night and from night til morning and still talk and nobody\ncan understand it. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- those things that happened to us, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s like a\nhorror story, it\u2019s -- in your wildest imagination you couldn\u2019t conceive it and picture\nit, no less understand it.",
        "Q: So, because they couldn\u2019t conceptualize it, there was little point in discussing\nit?",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Plus in the case of your -- your aunts and uncles, they had lost family, so there\nwas, in addition to the lack of empathy for what you\u2019d been through, there was also\nthat -- the -- the pain and the grief of having lost the family. What about -- did you\nknow other -- other than your husband, before you met your husband, did you\nknow other survivors that were there in Detroit?",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: Did you ever talk to them?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: What could it be like? You just listen. Most of the people I met in Detroit, they\nall came from Auschwitz. So you know, all I could say is my God, how lucky I\nwas.",
        "Q: This is, you know, I mean no disrespect to ask this, but did you ever feel guilty\nthat you were as lucky as you were?",
        "A: No, not really. I don\u2019t think I had or have any reason to feel guilty.",
        "Q: No, but --",
        "A: I just -- what they say, the luck of the draw.",
        "Q: There\u2019s no reason you should feel guilty, I just -- there are some people who do\nfeel that.",
        "A: No, I heard that mentioned many times before [indecipherable] but no, I -- I\nmean, it never even came to my mind that I need to feel guilty.",
        "Q: Was it -- do you remember the first time that you spoke to another survivor who\nhad been in Auschwitz or any of the other death camps, and actually heard from\ntheir lips what happened? [phone ringing] Let\u2019s wait til 1t\u2019s finished ringing.",
        "A: Yeah, well, the first ones I heard from, what happened 1n [indecipherable] my\ncousins who came back, you know, we met them after we got back home to\nDebrecen and they came to see us. So by that time, you know, by the time I came\nhere I -- I knew about it.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s --",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t all together, you know, new to me.",
        "Q: But -- well then, let me ask you, when your cousins came back to Debrecen and\nyou first heard about it then, do you remember what it was like to -- to hear about\nthat?",
        "A: That was such a long time ago that really -- I really can\u2019t --",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: -- I really can\u2019t remember what I felt. I\u2019m sure that it must have been awful, but",
        "Q: Okay. I just thought I would ask. Let\u2019s talk about you and your husband. So you\nmet. Do you remember at all the first time that you two talked about your\nexperiences, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: I couldn't believe -- well, first of all he\u2019s got something against the Hungarians\nto begin with, but you have to know him, too. See, he was in Auschwitz for two\nand a half years by the time the Hungarian Jews arrived, and he couldn\u2019t\nunderstand how come that we didn\u2019t know anything about it, what was going on.\nAnd they didn\u2019t run the other way, instead they ended up in Auschwitz. So that --\nand I think in some ways -- in some ways I think he held it against me that I was\nfree that much longer, while he was already in camp.",
        "Q: You know, when I first read yours and your husband\u2019s stories 1n the transcripts\nthat they sent me, I was struck by the disparity of your experiences, what he -- he\nwent through and what you went through",
        "A: Oh yeah, exactly.",
        "Q: And wondered whether over the years that\u2019s been at all problematic for the two\nof you to have such different experiences, and w -- and whether it\u2019s g -- that\u2019s\ncaused --",
        "A: No, not really.",
        "Q: -- any problems or --",
        "A: No [indecipherable] I mean, eventually he understand that it was not my fault,\nand I had nothing to do with it. No.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know if you can answer this, but because it was such a short period of\ntime after you came to this country that you met your husband, maybe this is not a\n-- a question you can even answer, but I guess what I\u2019m wondering is whether it\u2019s -\n- whether you could imagine being married to someone who hadn\u2019t had this\nexperience?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I probably could have. I don\u2019t think -- can imagine why I\ncouldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: I was just wondering whether -- I mean, certainly I know people in my own life\nwhose -- who are my age whose parents -- where one of them was a survivor and\none of them was not. So obviously it happened, but that\u2019s -- I\u2019m just wondering in\nyour life whether that was something -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s an academic\nquestion cause you did meet and you did marry, and --",
        "A: And that was that.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry\u201d?",
        "A: And that -- and that -- that was it. Well, I don\u2019t know. I wonder sometime,\nactually, what would have been like to live with somebody who didn\u2019t experience\nwhat he did.",
        "Q: What has it been like for you because his -- h-he went through so much. Not\nthat you didn\u2019t, but what has it been like as his wife to -- to deal with his\nexperiences secondhand over the past 50-odd years, 50 years or so.",
        "A: Well, at times it hasn\u2019t been all that easy, but we managed, we got through it.",
        "Q: When you say not easy, in what way not easy?",
        "A: Well, because of his, I guess because of his personality and because -- oops --\nwhat all those years, you know, did to him and the way he [indecipherable] may\nhave changed his personality and what he could have been like.",
        "Q: Did you have any -- when did you have your first child?",
        "A: 11 months after we got married.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any conversations, was there ever any question in your\nminds that you would have children?",
        "A: No, not really, that was just the way it\u2019s supposed to be.",
        "Q: Well, the reason I ask 1s I\u2019ve heard two different things from people. Number\none, pondering the now clich\u00e9 question of do I want to bring children into this\nworld, knowing what I know about what is possible. And the flip side of that which\nis I want to have as many children as I can to repopulate the world. So that\u2019s why I\nasked.",
        "A: Well, see, in those days they didn\u2019t have the birth control pills. I missed out on\nthat.",
        "Q: And you have how many children?",
        "A: Four.",
        "Q: And where did they come -- how long -- I mean, how far apart are they?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see. 1949 through 1961.",
        "Q: And how f -- what are their names, and --",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s four, almost five years between the first two, and then the third\none came 16 months later and the fourth one came seven years after that.",
        "Q: And what are their names?",
        "A: Their names?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Howard, Caryn with a C, C-a-r-y-n and in the time I picked th-that name my\nfriend really thought I was crazy.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because that was a different spelling of -- of Caryn. And today it\u2019s all over, but\nfor years I haven\u2019t seen it. But anyway, and the next one 1s Linda, and the younger\n-- the youngest is Elaine.",
        "Q: She\u2019s the one born in \u201961?",
        "A: 6l.",
        "Q: When do you recall first talking to any of your children about what had\nhappened to you and your husband?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t too long after, as soon as my son was old enough to notice\nthings, really. You know, my husband has a number on his arm, which you can see\nin the dark, big enough. So, you know, children ask questions.",
        "Q: And how do you tell a small child about this?",
        "A: Well, luckily my husband has a very good sense of humor, and so he\u2019s got a\nway of making a joke out of most things. So what do you tell a four or five year old\nchild? Right? You can\u2019t go and tell him, cause first of all they wouldn\u2019t understand\nand then, why.",
        "Q: So what did he tell him? Or do you remember at all the gist of it?",
        "A: Well, I remember he told him he was 1n jail, and he was a prisoner and that was\nthat.",
        "Q: When I was a small boy, the -- the man who cut my hair, the barber at the\nbarbershop had been in Auschwitz and I didn\u2019t -- of course I was -- I was the four\nor five year old child, and I said -- I asked him, what\u2019s that on your arm? And he\nsaid, well that\u2019s my phone -- phone number, so I don\u2019t forget my phone number.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what my husband says, too. Not only it\u2019s his phone number, it\u2019s his\nhouse number.",
        "Q: What about when your children were older? Older t -- old enough to\nunderstand?",
        "A: Well, we told them, and they knew. They knew that we were a different family\nfrom all the other friends they had, because you know, we were -- there was no\ngrandparents, there was no immediate aunts and uncles. No cousins anywhere. But\nyou know, we never made a big deal of it, so they got through it until they were old\nenough to understand and they began to learn in school and knew what it was all\nabout.",
        "Q: Do you remember the first time any of your children came to you asking\nquestions in any depth and wanting you to talk about 1t? Maybe after reading --\nseeing something in school or hearing something, or --",
        "A: I think we just sort of, as we went along, you know, as they grew older we told\nthem a little more. So it was a gradual process.",
        "Q: Was it something that you and your husband at all talked about between\nyourselves, about you know, was their any conscious thought about how to tell\nthem or what to tell them or what not to tell them, or was it just sort of --",
        "A: Not really, no. I mean, like I said, we just, as they grew older and that, we just\nwent along with whatever they were coming up with.",
        "Q: How is it that you came to leave Detroit?",
        "A: Well, because of my husband\u2019s job.",
        "Q: I -- I know [\u2019Il be talking to him tomorrow, but just basically what does your\nhusband do, or what did he do?",
        "A: At the time he was working for a clothing company, who had several stores,\nyou know, and so that\u2019s why we ended up traveling. And then he hooked up with a\nbig -- the discount outfit, one of the first discount stores in the country and we\ntraveled some more.",
        "Q: Where did you go, briefly. How did you -- from -- from --",
        "A: From -- from [indecipherable] we were --",
        "Q: -- from Detroit to here.",
        "A: -- and I went to Grand Rapids first -- Michigan, Grand Rapids, Michigan. From\nthere we went to Binghamton, New York. And then we went -- from there we went\nback to Detroit again. That was with the discount corporation, and that\u2019s how we\nended up in Indianapolis and he became a district manager and they moved us to\nIndiana [indecipherable]. That was three years ago.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: 30 years ago, almost.",
        "Q: So you -- were your children born in different cities along the way, or were --",
        "A: Actually, all four of them were born in Michigan.",
        "Q: You were there that long? Oh yeah, so 30 years ago, that -- so you --",
        "A: Well, we went back.",
        "Q: Right, I see.",
        "A: [indecipherable] when the first three were born in Detroit now, the two of them\nin Highland Park and the third one was born in the city of Detroit. And then when\nthe last one came about, we went -- we were back in Michigan again.",
        "Q: Hold on one second. So you came here, it\u2019s 30 years you said, \u201967.",
        "A: To Indian --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- Indiana? Indianapolis? Actually, we -- let me see, we came to Michigan City\nin 1964, and we were there five years, and then from there we came to\nIndianapolis. So we\u2019ve been in Indiana for over 30 years.",
        "Q: When -- okay, I\u2019m gonna -- I want to come back to these questions, there\u2019s\nsome questions, the things that I mailed to you that they specifically want me to\nask, and then I have questions that I\u2019ve come up with on my own --",
        "A: Well, okay.",
        "Q: -- just in the past day or so, having given this some thought. Hold on for a\nsecond. We talked about that. One of the questions -- I\u2019m going now with things\nthat they wanted me to ask you, what -- after having had such a horrible\nexperience, what -- what strength did you draw on to -- to go on, to -- to make a fa\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: -- absolutely.",
        "A: Three minutes, four minutes.",
        "Q: Take your time. Take as much time as you want. This is a continuation of a\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Agnes Vogel. This is\ntape number two, side B. -- asked -- that you\u2019Il be asked to do. I was asking you\nbefore the -- the tape -- the last tape ended about what -- what -- what has helped\nyou to -- to cope, to -- with the memories, with the -- the grief, with the -- has your\nfaith been helpful or -- or was that something that you struggled with when the war\nwas over?",
        "A: You mean religion?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No, [had no problem with that. The strength -- oh well, once we had a family\nand we had children, there were no question, I mean you had to go forward, that\nwas that. The children were our strength.",
        "Q: You said religion was not a problem. What did you mean?",
        "A: I -- Lam Jewish. I was born one and I always will be. I\u2019m not overly religious. I\nkeep a Jewish home, I raise my kids in the tradition, or I try to.",
        "Q: Let me rephrase the question. I guess some people would say that there\u2019s a --\ncan be a difference between the -- the rituals of being an observant Jew in terms of\nke-keeping kosher and high holidays and g-going to temple, and -- and having\nsome sort of relationship with -- with a God, meaning -- how can I pose the\nquestion? I guess it\u2019s a -- the classic question that many people have coped with\nover the past 50 years since th-the Holocaust, is -- you know --",
        "A: Where is God?",
        "Q: And how could God have let this happen and all of that. And I\u2019m wondering if\nyou ever had, at any point in your life, pondered any of that, or --",
        "A: Sometime. Sometime, yes. And I think I -- I ask where\u2019s God after the war\nwhen my parents were so sick, when my mother suffered so much, I think that was\nthe time when I asked where is God, why did she deserve what she got? After what\nwe went through.",
        "Q: Did you come to any conclusions?",
        "A: No. There 1s really no conclusion. You don\u2019t know why. Things just happen.\nWhen we started out our life together, I kept kosher. I had Friday nights traditional.\nEven my own family in Detroit didn\u2019t believe it, after what I came from, that I\nwould do something like that. Howe -- my husband couldn\u2019t care less. My son was\nBar Mitzvah because I dragged him to his classes, literally by his ear. And my\nhusband kept telling me, don\u2019t bother, he doesn\u2019t have to do it. I said yes, he have\nto do it, because that\u2019s what he is and he have to do it. And so he did. And after we\nleft Detroit, I don\u2019t know, I -- there were places we lived where it wasn\u2019t easy to\nkeep kosher. There were no kosher butcher. So I bought the meat in the\nsupermarket and I koshered it. Took it to a man who koshered. And gradually I did\naway with that, too. Not to the point that I ever -- to this day I don\u2019t eat pork, and I\ndon\u2019t bring it in the house. I don\u2019t even eat it out. Now today I have the four kids.\nMy son has nothing to do with religion. My daughter lives here in town, he marry -\n- she married a Catholic guy who turned Jewish and today he is more religious than\nthe rabbi, to the point where they don\u2019t even answer the telephone from Friday\nnight until Sunday evening when the Shabbas 1s over. So there.",
        "Q: And which daughter is that?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: Which daughter 1s that?",
        "A: That\u2019s the first one, my oldest.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: That is the oldest of the girls.",
        "Q: And then the other two daughters, what happened with --",
        "A: Now, the one in New York is not married, and the youngest one is also married,\na Swiss guy who 1s not Jewish, so -- but they did go to a Seder in Switzerland and\nhe enjoyed it very much. And she does the traditional things for the holidays, you\nknow, she bakes the hamantashen and the -- whatever. It comes [indecipherable |",
        "Q: And your single daughter in New York, does she -- is she observant at all?",
        "A: Not too. She comes home for the holidays most of the time, depending how it\nfalls, you know.",
        "Q: Pll obviously be talking to your husband in more depth about this tomorrow,\nbut was he -- you say he -- he wasn\u2019t very su-sup-supportive, or maybe that\u2019s not\nthe right word, of your --",
        "A: No, that\u2019s the right word.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable] he wanted to do nothing with religion.",
        "Q: Did he humor you? Did --",
        "A: Oh, he went along with it because I wanted to do it, but you know.",
        "Q: Did he join in? Did he do his part in the rituals, and -- or did he --",
        "A: Mm, sort of. Now he\u2019s beginning to get into it.",
        "Q: Hm. What about -- I\u2019m still staying with the thread of things that have made\nyour life meaningful since the war, and it\u2019s -- this, the largest portion of your life,\nthe -- the past 50 years. I g -- I gather you\u2019ve retained interest in the arts. I know\nwhen you were a girl you were -- I -- I gather you\u2019re still doing it, painting\nceramics.",
        "A: I\u2019m doing it again now. Th-The -- these kind of paintings pulled me through\nbetween having babies.",
        "Q: Tell me about this -- your th -- your -- this passion, hobby, avocation?",
        "A: Ah, no, it -- well, I guess you can call it both. Actually, this goes way back\nwhen I was a teenager back home. See, in those days in Europe, this was a\nbeautiful profession.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you -- why don\u2019t -- because this is an audio interview, let\u2019s describe\nwhat this is.",
        "A: This is what they call a porcelain painting. Porcelain art is what it is. And in\nthose days before the second World War, this was a beautiful profession. And my\nfamily had a very good friend who did that, and then when -- when I became a\nteenager, I took lessons, not from the family friend, but from another young\nwoman, who did some beautiful, beautiful work. And it was just in the early 40\u2019s,\nso we really didn\u2019t have much time, but we were hoping, before we knew what was\ngoing to happen to us, that someday we gonna come to the United States and bring\nour beautiful painted porcelain. Well, it didn\u2019t happen. Somebody else\n[indecipherable] otherwise. So then when I came to this country -- see, if I would\nhave ended up -- if my family would have lived in Syracuse, New York, you know,\nI could have been painting china for 50 years. But since they lived in Detroit, there\nwas no need for that.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t understand. Why would Syracuse have been different?",
        "A: Because, I believe in Syracuse, New York, isn\u2019t that the home of the Syracuse\nChina Company, whatever? Anyway, so -- a-and then I find out, after I was\nmarried already, that they\u2019re giving -- they had a very good system in the schools\nin those days in Europe, as far as adult classes were going, and I found out there\nwas one of these, and I went. And I took some classes over there, and in between\nkids, you know, when I couldn\u2019t go out of the house all day long and he would\ncome home and watch the kids and I would go to class. And I did it. And then I\nworked at it when we lived in Flint and I did it when we lived in Michigan City.\nAnd then when we moved to Indianapolis I couldn\u2019t find anybody to work with\nand so I hadn\u2019t done anything for years until about three years ago, when I met\nsomebody by accident, and so I\u2019m at it again.",
        "Q: What other -- are there other arts that you are attracted to, or get joy out of or --\neither doing or observing, or --",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s a lot of things I can do, you wouldn\u2019t really call it arts, but yeah, I\ntried stained window -- stained glass. But then the woman I was working with\nmoved away from town and so that was the end of that.",
        "Q: What other things do you enjoy doing -- that bring you joy?",
        "A: I enjoy reading.",
        "Q: Fiction, non-fiction?",
        "A: Both. History. Think it\u2019s an interesting subject.",
        "Q: Have you had other classes other than your porcelain?",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "Q: Mm-mm. What about any more passive things, concerts, I don\u2019t know, opera,\nballet, movies?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I -- I worked for a ballet school for 22 years, I just retired --",
        "Q: Doing what?",
        "A: -- end of May. I was running the office.",
        "Q: So you did that after your kids were grown, or did you start to --",
        "A: Well actually, I got into it because of my youngest daughter, believe it or not.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: She -- well, she was a very cute, dainty little girl when she was small and I took\nher to ballet classes. I started her actually in Michigan City and then -- for two\nreasons I| did that with her, because she was also a very shy child and I figured that\nwill be good and you know, bring her out a little. And the older kids took wer --\nwhen we were in Michigan City were in the children\u2019s theater group, and they did\ngreat over there. And -- but she was too young for that yet, the little one. And then\nwhen we moved to Indianapolis I -- one summer there was nothing to do for her.\nAnd so I called up and I took her to the Butler University ballet classes and she got\nhooked. She wanted to be a ballerina. And that\u2019s how I got in there and now she\nleft and I stayed.",
        "Q: Has she continued to dance?",
        "A: She did for awhile, but then she had problem with her back and then she\n[indecipherable] so she stopped.",
        "Q: Politics. Once you came to this country, did you get involved at all with de --\npolitics, domestically?",
        "A: Not really. Just on the side.",
        "Q: On the side meaning?",
        "A: I\u2019m in -- actively involved in politics? No. Am I going out campaigning, and\nthat sort of things? No. Well, first of all, I didn\u2019t have time for it, it takes time and I\nhad four kids to take care of, so you know, there was nobody else but me for them,\nso that was out of the question.",
        "Q: When did you become a citizen?",
        "A: Five years to the day I arrived here, I think.",
        "Q: What was that like for you?",
        "A: That was wonderful. It was an -- an unspeakable feeling.",
        "Q: How so\u201d?",
        "A: Well, just imagine yourself being thrown out of one country and taken into\nanother and you become a citizen. On the other hand, there is always that little,\nsmall voice, you know, in the back of your head, what if 1t will happen here too?\nSo this is why I think when I -- I raise my kids, all I wanted them to do is whatever\nthey do, to be independent enough so wherever life will take them, they will be\nable to land on their two feet, because you never know.",
        "Q: I want to talk about all three of those things, but back to your citize -- becoming\na citizen. It obviously was a -- a big deal to you.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It said that --",
        "A: It still is and I take it seriously, not like some other people.",
        "Q: It\u2019s funny, it seems like, my mother included, all the -- the people that I know\nthat emigrated here are more patriotic, for lack of a better word, than most of the\nnative born people I know. Perhaps precisely because --",
        "A: Because we know what it is. We know what it\u2019s worth.",
        "Q: Did you ever, back when you were in Europe deciding what to do after the war,\nwas there a time where you were really seriously considering going to Israel\nbecause your father\u2019s family was there?",
        "A: Yeah, I was, because most of my friends were there. And there was, you know,\nwe needed a country.",
        "Q: Have you ever in the interim regretted that decision to come here rather than\ngoing there or --",
        "A: N-No. No, no, I never did.",
        "Q: You mentioned -- kind of going all over the place here, chronologically, but you\nmentioned earlier about when you were in Europe listening to the radio and\nwaiting for Roosevelt to come and help and it never happened. Did that in any way\nlessen your, I don\u2019t know, appreciation for this country, to know that they had\nabandoned their -- I don\u2019t know how to, what to call it, their duties, their -- that\nthey had not behaved better toward the European Jews?",
        "A: Not lessened. I was probably a little bit disappointed that a big, powerful\ncountry couldn\u2019t do more. But then, you know, as you live here, you learn about\nthe country, you learn about political procedure, so to speak and you can almost\nunderstand.",
        "Q: How were you treated -- yo-you mentioned in passing about the -- y-you didn\u2019t\nwant to call them princesses, but there were some American born, presumably\nJewish women that you were encountering that were less than welcoming to you,\npresumably because you -- you had an accent and your English wasn\u2019t to -- to their\nmind --",
        "A: Some still are, that\u2019s really -- you know, people are very interesting. See, I -- I\ndid a lot of phone work, I mean answering the phone at work over there. And it\u2019s\ninteresting how people react when they hear something different. So I sort of got\nused to it. You know, at first it was bothering me a little bit, but now I don\u2019t care.\nYou don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s your problem. You know when I would answer the phone\nand on the other end I hear, oh, did I detect an accent? I said, no, you hear one. Or I\nwould say, you know, no, I don\u2019t think so. And then they wanted to know if I was\nfrom Germany, or from France, or wherever, you know. And then some people I\nwould try to answer something, they said, I don\u2019t understand you. I don\u2019t know\nwhat you\u2019re talking about. Okay.",
        "Q: Did you ever feel -- a-a-and if so, how -- ill treated by other American born\nJews here that you, you know, we -- espe -- like let\u2019s say you moved to a new\ntown, in your various moves, you know, to Flint and Michigan City --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and Syracuse, or wherever you were at, and here. How were you received by\nthe -- the Jewish communities in the places that you went, as -- as immigrants, as\nsurvivors?",
        "A: [indecipherable] but 1t was very nice. We made friends everywhere we went. It -\n- it -- it depends, it\u2019s so different, you know, the kind of people you meet, in\ngeneral. Some are nice, and curious and want to get to know you, some, don\u2019t\nbother me.",
        "Q: Do you recall any incidents in any of the places that you lived, ag-again getting\nback to how people, you know, would come to find out -- I mean, obviously your -\n- your husband has the tattoo. Did you have any memorable encounters with\npeople, I don\u2019t know, neighbors, the grocery store --",
        "A: No, not that kind, but I had through my children, where we lived in Cleveland\nfor a short time and my son went to school there. And th -- he had a fight with a\nkid behind him who called him -- I was going to say a dirty Jew, but no, it was\nsomething else, but there was a Jew in it. They got into a fight for something. That\nwas in Cleveland and then when we lived in Delaware, Newark, Delaware, we\nlived in a very nice, almost new subdivision over there and there was another\nfamily somewhere not too far from our house whose -- the father was an army\nofficer and they had two or three kids and one was as old as my son and they were\ngood friends. And there was a little boy who was my Caryn\u2019s age, the one who\nlives here in town now, and -- and she had an incident with the kid. She came\nhome one day and she says to me, Mommy, you know what -- I don\u2019t remember\nhis name any more -- what he told me on the way to school? I said, what did he\nsay? She said, he told me that it\u2019s too bad I wasn\u2019t in Germany during the war\nbecause then Hitler could have killed me too. And then another day when the --\nafter that, sometime after that, the afternoon when they come home from school,\nthree comes my daughter with a, you know, stack of books in her hand, with a\nsmile from ear to ear. I said, what happened? She said well -- and says, that boy\nwas bothering me again, was starting again being a Jew and this and that and\nwhatnot. And she says to me, I couldn\u2019t listen to it any more, so I picked up my\nbooks and I hit him on the head with it. I said, good for you. And that\u2019s from the\nsame family, two boys from the same family. So how do you -- how do you figure,\nhow do you account for that? And the older boy would come to my house and play\nwith my son, and then the other one was hassling my daughter.",
        "Q: What about not so much anti-Semitic incidents, but you know, moving to a new\nneighborhood, cause you moved so much, and you know, people asking you about\nyour survivor experiences, or it coming up in conversation or it -- neighbors --",
        "A: It\u2019s interesting, for the most -- most people w-wanted -- they couldn\u2019t hear\nenough about it.",
        "Q: Meaning they asked about it?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Sometime I think more so than the Jewish people.",
        "Q: Why do you think that is?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know why it is, but I noticed it, was -- I don\u2019t know why, but -- but the\nGentiles want to hear more about it than our own people, even today.",
        "Q: Was there a time when you were reticent to talk about it 1f someone asked you\nand would -- would th -- was there a time when you would be less than --",
        "A: Well, that depends who you talk to. You know, there was some people you\nwouldn\u2019t want to say anything. There were others who you feel that they genuinely\ninterested, so you don\u2019t mind talking about tt.",
        "Q: I guess I was thinking more in terms of was there a time in your life where you\nor your husband were making a conscious effort to put it behind you and not talk\nabout it?",
        "A: W-We were, probably the first maybe 15 - 20 years of our marriage, we just --\njust didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "Q: Well, that -- that answers my question. That\u2019s a large period of time.",
        "A: Yeah. We just didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "Q: What changed after 15 - 20 years, what -- was there anything that spurred you\non to --",
        "A: I think people began to read more and began to hear more. When the television\ncame about, there were more things that came out into the open, and people\nbecame interested. And then -- see, when my older kids went through high school,\nall through school, even here in Indianap -- in -- in Indianapolis from \u201969 on, never\na word was mentioned in school about it. Nothing. In the early 70\u2019s when they\nstarted to teach in the Sunday schools, and that\u2019s when they were start -- beginning\nto look for survivors to come and -- and speak. But up until then there was really\nnothing.",
        "Q: What was your first experience -- let me just check how we\u2019re doing here, I\nthink the tape is ending, hol -- [tape break] What was your first experience doing\nany sort of public speaking about your experiences? Was this your -- being invited\nto your children\u2019s school, or --",
        "A: I think the first time it was I was asked, it was here in Indianapolis already. I\nwas asked to go to IHC, the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation where we belong,\nto talk to a Sunday school class, and before I got there, or before I was to speak,\nthey were showing the film then -- oh God, I can\u2019t remember the title of it. All I\nknow 1s the --",
        "Q: \u201cNight and Fog?\u201d",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: \u201cNight and Fog?\u201d",
        "A: Yeah. Thank you. And it was the first time I really saw pictures of that kind.\nAnd I was so shaken by it, was the word I think, that I almost couldn\u2019t do my\nspeaking. And then the other one when I was a little bit more composed, when my\nyoungest daughter was in junior high and she was in an accelerated class and th-the\nwonderful social studies teacher, and they were reading the Anne Frank story and\nalso some other stuff related to the Holocaust. And in one of those classes, the\nteacher asked the class if anybody knows anyone who was in a camp. And our little\none put her hand up and said yeah, my parents were there. So the teacher wanted to\nknow, so do you think your mother would come in and talk to us? So she called me\nand I said yeah, I\u2019ll be glad to, sure. So we set up a time and I wrote up, you know,\nmy speech, and went [indecipherable] did my speaking. And I know my daughter\nwas very upset with me, cause she said, you sounded just like a teacher. But when\nthe bell came and the class was over, the kids wouldn\u2019t let me go. They had so\nmany questions, they wanted to hear more. And the same night the teacher called\nme again, would I come back and tell them some more. And that was when I told\nmy husband, I said look, I already told them what I know. Maybe you ought to\ncome and hear what the kids have to ask and you talk to them. And that\u2019s when,\nyou know, we really started to talk about it to other than us. And then, about the\nsame time there was a -- a book that came out, \u201cThe Hoax of the 20\" Century,\u201d and\nhe got -- my husband got very upset over that and he wrote a letter to the\nnewspaper and he wrote a letter to Northwestern University. Of course, Mr. Butz\nnever answered, but nevertheless he wrote a -- sent him a letter. And that\u2019s when\nhe started to come out.",
        "Q: And when would that have been, approximately?",
        "A: I think 1t was somewhere in the early 70\u2019s, I don\u2019t remember exactly what year,\n\u00b072 - \u00b073 -\u201974, somewhere in there, in the 70\u2019s.",
        "Q: And since then what sort of things have the two of you done in terms of\nspeaking, or --",
        "A: He is the one mostly who does the speaking, I\u2019m not very good at public\nspeaking. He is -- he is very good and he does quite a bit of it.",
        "Q: Well, let me rephrase the questions. Wh-Wh-What\u2019s, other than your -- your\ndaughter\u2019s class, what sort of places have you gone over the years?",
        "A: Some social clubs, you know, not -- not too many places, really. I let him do the\ntalking.",
        "Q: Can you talk about the long term impact that you think your experiences in the\nHolocaust have had on you raising your children, perhaps, or tr --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",

And I was just\nasking Mrs. Vogel about the long term impact that your experiences have had on\nyou in different areas of your life. And the first I was going to ask you about is in\nyour family life and in raising your children.",
        "A: It\u2019s like I said before, to make sure that they\u2019re -- become independent people.\nWe never -- tried not to teach them hate. We\u2019re both rather friendly people and we\nwelcomed anybody who came into the house, so you know, we won\u2019t hold grudges\nagainst people because that doesn\u2019t get you anywhere. And I hope my kids will\nhave enough common sense that they\u2019Il know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong.",
        "Q: How has it affected your, I don\u2019t know, we talked about politics briefly,\ncitizenship, your -- your feelings about government and the possibilities of what\ngovernment can do and should do and should not do. Is it in any way shaped by\nyour experience with what happened to you in Europe?",
        "A: [indecipherable] that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the thing, that you gotta keep your ears and eyes\nopen.",
        "Q: How so?",
        "A: To listen to what -- not just what people say, but what they do and what they\nreally mean when they say some -- say something, especially in -- people in\ngovernment. So I go out and I vote for the best people I think there 1s to put in to\nplaces in the government.",
        "Q: Do you -- your -- you talked earlier about that small voice in the back of your\nhead that says, could this happen here.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Is that voice any quieter, dimmer than it was when you first came over here,\nwhen it was fresher in your mind?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: As a matter of fact it\u2019s even more lou -- I think it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s maybe louder now\nthan it was before.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because of what\u2019s going on out there and what\u2019s happening in Washington and\nit\u2019s what happening -- what\u2019s happening in the country.",
        "Q: What things are happening that are most concerning you?",
        "A: The right wing swing of the country. All these fringe societies out there that\ncould easily, given time and a situation, God forbid, can easily become a bigger\nthreat.",
        "Q: Were you -- I want to go back in history and talk to you about some things that\nhave happened, but do you recall how you felt when this bombing happened in\nKansas City -- excuse me, Oklahoma City? Was that -- did that concern you?",
        "A: That was terrible. It was a horrible -- it -- 1t -- I mean, how can it happen in the\nUnited States? See, this is what I mean, people like that.",
        "Q: Are there sounds or smells that you have encountered here that bring back\nmemories for you of --",
        "A: Sounds yes, smells, no. But words sometimes.",
        "Q: Like?",
        "A: Maybe it\u2019s something, that I hear something and it doesn\u2019t take much, it just all\nof a sudden like a movie, everything comes back.",
        "Q: What kind of words would do that?",
        "A: N-Not any specific words, but you know, you read an article, you -- you hear\nsomething on television, and oh, that\u2019s it and off you go.",
        "Q: What about sounds, you said sounds, yes. Did you mean things other than\nwords?",
        "A: Like a big bang, an explosion, a siren.",
        "Q: And you\u2019ve -- you\u2019re hair stand up or you -- you -- you -- or you have a\nflashback or you --",
        "A: Yeah, you could call it a flashback.",
        "Q: Have you ever been concerned or -- or apprehensive or fearful, I don\u2019t know, a\nknock on the door when you\u2019re not expecting it, or a phone call late at night, or a\nsp -- anything along those lines, or --",
        "A: Not really.",
        "Q: Just wondering.",
        "A: No, not really. For the most part I feel pretty secure.",
        "Q: Is that something you\u2019ve had to work on at all, or are there any things you do, or\n-- that help you feel more secure, or things that you and your husband have done?",
        "A: I think it just -- like I said before, I think it just evolved. We been, thank God,\nvery lucky. We didn't have many unpleasant experiences, as far as that goes. So\nyou sort of become accustomed to being, you know, on an even -- what\u2019s the word\nI want to use?",
        "Q: Keel?",
        "A: Sort of.",
        "Q: I wanted to talk to you about some -- oh okay, all right, let me -- I\u2019m checking\noff these questions they wanted me to ask. Your dream life, have you been troubled\nin your dreams by nightmares, or --",
        "A: Oh, I have crazy dreams all the time. But I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s related to where I\ncome from. Not necessarily.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t -- none -- you don\u2019t ha -- specifically have dreams that you\u2019ve had\nover the years that --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- related directly that you\u2019re aware of?",
        "A: No. I had some -- a nightmare not too long ago, I woke up screaming,\nsomebody was going to come and get me. But I don\u2019t think it had any relation to --\nnot consciously.",
        "Q: You went back to Hungary some -- not -- many years later.",
        "A: Yeah, we went back, oh, it\u2019s about 10 years ago.",
        "Q: What was that like for you to go back there after so many years?",
        "A: It was [indecipherable]. It was like I was in a strange country, like I\u2019ve never\nbeen there before.",
        "Q: Just because physically it looked different, or --",
        "A: Yes, yes, and it\u2019s strange, I mean, things that I remember that I grew up with is\nnot there any more. There was a big, beautiful street in the middle of the city, and\nwe walked through there and I looked and I s -- kept saying, it\u2019s -- doesn\u2019t look the\nsame as I remember. It used to have, when -- what I remember, it used to have two\nrows of huge, beautiful trees, and in the summertime it would -- you know, all the\nbranches and the green would come out and then all come together, it\u2019s like a --",
        "Q: A tunnel?",
        "A: -- tunnel going through it. And I\u2019m looking and I said, it\u2019s not there. I kept\nasking, I said, what\u2019s missing from here? And my sister said to me, oh you\u2019re\nlooking for the trees that\u2019s no longer there, they cut it down. And went back to the\nstreet where we used to live, and I na -- had such an eerie feeling. So that was that.",
        "Q: I know your husband went, did you go together to the Holocaust gathering, the\nsurvivor\u2019s gathering in the early 80\u2019s?",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah. The one in Israel\u2019? Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me about that. What was that like for you to do that?",
        "A: That was emotional, very emotional. It was -- it was nice. At that time I was still\nlooking, trying to find out what happened. See, I have an aunt who we never really\nfound out what happened to her and her daughter. That\u2019s the sister of my mother I\nmentioned earlier whose -- the husband was taken away in 1941, I believe. They\ntook him to the Ukraine. \u00b042 and early \u00b043, the news came that he died. And my\naunt was left with a small child who was about four years old at the time and a\ndaughter who was a young teenager. And she decided to liquidate whatever she\nhad over there and then to come to live with us, because they were very close\n[indecipherable] my mother. And she wanted to be with us til the war was over.\nAnd my parents went in September between the high holidays, between Rosh\nHashanah and Yom Kippur to bring the child over to our home, so she should be\nfree to take care of her business and then would follow. Well, it took her longer\nthan she thought it would, and then around Christmas, December, they came over\nand -- Christmastime they came over and wanted to take the boy home and he\nwouldn\u2019t go, he wanted to stay with us. And then in the spring my parents wanted\nto send the child back to her, and my father almost found somebody who was\ngoing there with her -- with his daughter and at first they agreed that okay, they\u2019re\ngoing to take a chance and take the child back. In the last minute they said no,\nwe're afraid to take a child because if they find out you\u2019re taking a Jewish child,\nwe get in trouble too, so they didn\u2019t take him. And as it happened, he survived,\ntoday he is a doctor and he lives in Texas, and his mother and sister is gone and we\ndon\u2019t know how and -- but they died in Auschwitz, both of them. And they were\nyoung enough to be able to survive.",
        "Q: What other things happened when you went over there, did you see people you\nknew, did you --",
        "A: I met a lot of people I knew, yes, and so did my husband. And I went to one of\nthe museums in Tel Aviv called the dias -- Diaspora Museum. And to my surprise I\nfound in one of the computers, my whole families\u2019 history written up. So that was\ninteresting. And I saw my aunts I had [indecipherable] I haven\u2019t seen since I was a\nsmall child.",
        "Q: Did you -- other than that gathering, have you had much contact with other\nsurvivors living here in the States? Do you have any friends who are also\nsurvivors?",
        "A: [have a girlfriend I went to school with, she lives in New York, and that\u2019s\nabout it. I really don\u2019t -- and the few here in town.",
        "Q: About how many people are there here?",
        "A: Real survivors?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, some of them already passed away. Not really a whole lot.",
        "Q: Five, 10 - 20? [indecipherable] 30?",
        "A: There are a few who came over here as young children before -- just before the\nwar, came from Germany. But others [indecipherable] real -- real survivors are us\nand maybe three, four other people, that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: So th -- what about in other places you lived before you came here?",
        "A: The only place that we met survivors were in Binghamton, New York, where I\nmet some people from my hometown, and Cleveland. Other than that, in Michigan\nCity there, we were, I think, the only survivors there was.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Well, I was just thinking it must have been a -- a profound experience\nhaving had only sporadic contact with other survivors since you came here, to all\nof a sudden be there with thousands there in Israel.",
        "A: Yes and no. In some ways I think it was a relief, because you know, when two\nsurvivors get together, the only thing they talk about, what they went through and\nwhat they survived. A-And I think in order to save your sanity, so to speak, you\nneed -- you need some time away from it.",
        "Q: So it sounds like a blessing that -- that you haven\u2019t had that many encounters.",
        "A: In some ways.",
        "Q: I can understand that.",
        "A: That\u2019s my husband.",
        "Q: Yes. Do you need to communicate at all bef -- cause there\u2019s more that --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, how much more do you have to go?",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s really up to you. There are a few key things that I definitely. Can\nyou spare another 15 or 20 minutes?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay. I would ask you about a -- a handful of things that happened in the past\n50 years that -- that I\u2019m wondering what your thoughts were about, or feelings\nabout, as it relates to your own experience. The bomb, the atom bomb. The -- the n\n-- the nuclear age, the -- the fear of annihilation that was so prevalent in the 50\u2019s\nand you know, where -- you know, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. What was that\nlike?",
        "A: That was nerve-wracking, that was scary. The Cold War was scary because you\nnever really could trust the Russians, so the -- as far as the -- what, the atom bomb\nin Japan, it was a terrible thing to do, but it had to be done, otherwise we would\nstill be fighting.",
        "Q: What about the -- the trials after the war, the Nuremberg trials and other trials\nthat happened with --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t catch enough of them.",
        "Q: Did you follow them very closely?",
        "A: Yes and no. See, the Nuremberg trials were what year?",
        "Q: \u00b047, I think?",
        "A: \u00b048?",
        "Q: Something in there.",
        "A: \u00b047 - 7\u00b048.",
        "Q: I think, yeah.",
        "A: Those were the years, I don\u2019t know, I was really trying to find myself, so to\nspeak.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. During that time when you were perhaps not so apt to be thinking\nabout, talking about what happened?",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: Were you aware of how many Nazis came here, and if so how did you feel\nwhen you s -- when you learned of that?",
        "A: I was a little bit surprised and a little bit disappointed in the American\ngovernment for letting them in. There were way too many in here.",
        "Q: And they weren\u2019t just here, they were, you know, working on NASA and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you know, the CIA and --",
        "A: Well, they needed them, they had to -- those people they had to bring in because\nthey needed the knowledge. But even with that, where were our American\nscientists?",
        "Q: I have a general question to ask you. Who do you blame for what happened?",
        "A: For what happened in --",
        "Q: The holo --",
        "A: -- you mean for the Holocaust?",
        "Q: Yes. Who -- who -- where is your anger directed?",
        "A: I think the whole world. There isn\u2019t one person you can pick because all the\ngovernments in the world knew what was going on and nobody did anything. It\u2019s\nhard to believe but none of those smart people in the government couldn\u2019t see\nthrough what Hitler was about and they went along with him, country after\ncountry?",
        "Q: Do you have any more anger toward the Germans than other people who\ncollaborated with them or went along with them or --",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t call it anger, I have no sense of being angry because that just\ndestroys you. I feel sorry for them.",
        "Q: How so\u201d?",
        "A: That they have to live with this, maybe to centuries to come.",
        "Q: Have you had any encounters ever with any younger Germans?",
        "A: Yes. We were in Germany a few ye-years ago, my husband was testifying\nagainst some Nazi people from the camp. We met some lovely German people,\nthey didn\u2019t know what to do for us. As a matter of fact we became friends. And she\npractically saved my life while we were there because I became sick over there and\nshe had a friend who was a doctor and you know, she -- she took care of me. So --",
        "Q: Are you aware -- I\u2019m assuming you are, of the -- how the American Jews\nreacted to what was going on and what they did and didn\u2019t do?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t do a whole lot either, did they?",
        "Q: I was wondering how you felt when you learned that.",
        "A: Disappointed I suppose, but then I don\u2019t think it would have make any\ndifference, because even though this 1s a free country, it\u2019s still the government that\ndecides. It\u2019s Washington who makes the decisions. So regardless of what they did,\nif they would have done more than what they tried, if it would have been any help.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve been told that there were Jewish leaders who went out of their way to lobby\nWashington not to let European Jews into the country, back in the late 30\u2019s, early\n40\u2019s because they were afraid of pogroms here and -- and the backlash cause of the\ndepression, that there would be all these immigrants coming over and taking jobs\naway from Americans and --",
        "A: Well, you see, that started the trouble in Germany. That\u2019s why it all started. So\nthis 1s what I mean when I said earlier they -- that\u2019s mostly -- see, the Jewish\npeople are not so eager to hear our stories, the real American Jews.",
        "Q: Wh-Why do you guess that is?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: Why do you guess that 1s?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what it 1s, what you just mentioned, that they were lobbying not to\nhave in the 1930\u2019s. So --",
        "Q: What a -- what about the conduct of European Jews who -- like the -- the Jewish\ncouncils, the -- th-the people who -- I don\u2019t know if you had any encounter in -- in\nyour hometown where there must have been Jews who were in charge of the\nghetto?",
        "A: They were [indecipherable] in every city, it -- that was the same everywhere the\nGermans went. But see, in -- in Hungary they didn\u2019t have much time any more.\nThat was -- everything was done in a hurry. Like I said, from March 19\", by the\nend of June there were no Jews left in Hungary, everybody was gone except the\none who lived in Budapest.",
        "Q: So there wasn\u2019t much time for any sort of infrastructure to be --",
        "A: There was no time for it, no. They were gone one, two, three. By that time they\nknew what they were doing and th-their machinery was oiled pretty good.",
        "Q: Back to things that happened in the interim, between then and now. Were --\nwhat was it like the whole McCarthy era and the red scare and the people who\nwere being persecuted here for, you know, rumors that they were communists and\nwha-what did you go through with that? Did you know anybody caught up in that?",
        "A: Not personally, no.",
        "Q: What was it like to observe that, having come from the experience that you\ncame from?",
        "A: Well, it was unsettling to say the least, because if 1t goes one way it could go the\nother way, too. So there we go.",
        "Q: Si -- explain that, if it can go one way it can go --",
        "A: Well, if one -- one day you persecute the communists, the next day you gonna\nfind somebody else to do the same for, right?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What about the -- the way blacks were treated here, and the beginnings\nof the Civil Rights movement and -- what was it like for you -- I mean, there are\nvery few blacks in Europe probably, when you were growing up.",
        "A: I never seen any. One I\u2019ve seen as a child, Joe Louis was in our town.",
        "Q: So what was it like for you to come to this country and see the -- the segregation\nand the -- the way, in essence, the blacks were in -- they were -- the ghettoes --",
        "A: Oh, talking about segregation, listen, when I came to this country in 1947 in\nDetroit, one of the nicest neighborhoods, I remember standing with my aunt\nwaiting for a bus to go downtown, and I look across the street, a big, beautiful\napartment building, and there is a plaque on the door. It said no dogs -- I\u2019m trying\nto remember exactly how it was worded. No dogs, no Jews and no blacks allowed\nin the building. That was in 1947. And I turned to my aunt and I asked, how could\nyou stand for this? To me it was outrageous. But that took me awhile to -- like all\nof us who come to this country, you know, from somewhere else and this is a\nwhole different life, and to get to know it, where it came from and what it\u2019s all\nabout. No, it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not fair to treat anybody like that, regardless of color.",
        "Q: I guess I was wondering if you felt any particular affinity or connection of --\nwatching the way they were treated, versus how you were treated.",
        "A: Connection, no, not really, because it\u2019s two different things altogether. No, it\u2019s -\n- it\u2019s not the same thing, and you can\u2019t really bring it to the same level.",
        "Q: I sense I\u2019ve touched a -- a nerve.",
        "A: No, not really, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not -- that\u2019s not the same thing.",
        "Q: How is it different?",
        "A: Because it\u2019s true they were treated badly, they were segregated, some of them\nwere lynched, but they weren't taken as a group to the gas chamber as the Jews\nwere. And that is the difference.",
        "Q: I guess I -- what I was asking -- I was not myself making the equation of the\ntwo things, I was wondering if you felt particularly disturbed at all or anything,\nwhen you came over here to -- to see --",
        "A: Yes, it was disturbing because no -- no human being should be treated like that,\nthere\u2019s no reason for it.",
        "Q: Were you at all, when the Civil Rights movement was happening, did you --\nwere you involved at all in that, or did you --",
        "A: Involved? To some extent, but I wasn\u2019t involved in any of the marching as such,\nbut you know, I was for it.",
        "Q: Just wondering.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: What about the whole upheaval that went on around the Vietnam war and all\nthe demonstrations and Kent State and you know, the riots and you know, that --\nthat whole period abou -- of upheaval. Did that frighten you at all, did that concern\nyou? Did that -- did you have any familiar --",
        "A: Frighten me? No, but it was rather -- what\u2019s the word I want to use? This is\nAmerica. That\u2019s the United States. People can do anything they want to.",
        "Q: Is that a good thing?",
        "A: In some ways it is, as long as they know what really matters.",
        "Q: I'm -- \u2019'm winding down. What about the whole Watergate scandal and finding\nout in depth the level of corruption and shenanigans that were going on?",
        "A: That just shows that you can\u2019t trust the politicians in Washington.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t a particular surprise or shock or --",
        "A: Not really. That was a shock because it happened in the United States and I\nguess in -- we\u2019re supposed to be a little bit better than anybody else in the world,\nbut I guess we\u2019re not.",
        "Q: What about various -- how do I characterize them as a group? In the past 50\nyears there have been some horrible things, either that we just learned about, like in\nthe case of the revelations about what happened with Stalin in Russia and all the\nmillions of people that --",
        "A: [indecipherable] that just a -- that\u2019s another thing that nobody wanted to know. I\nwas there. Some people knew about it.",
        "Q: I take it you did.",
        "A: Well, we heard stories.",
        "Q: Hold on, let me just check. I think I have to turn this over.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Agnes Vogel. This is tape number three, side B. And I was asking\nyou about things that have happened 1n terms of other -- I don\u2019t know what to call\nthem? Catastrophic events in history, such as the -- the various ways that Stalin did\naway with millions of people in Russia, in Soviet Union.",
        "A: Well, of course it was shocking, when something like this comes into the open.",
        "Q: Or, you know, Mao in China or Pol Pot in Cambodia, or Idi Amin, or --",
        "A: And the starving of the kids in what was that country in Africa where all those\nkids were starving awhile back?",
        "Q: Just recently?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s been a few years.",
        "Q: Well, Somalia, then -- that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No, Somalia is a latecomer, but --",
        "Q: Ethiopia?",
        "A: -- there was another --",
        "Q: Biafra?",
        "A: Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m tal -- thinking [indecipherable] sure.",
        "Q: Biafra was the late 60\u2019s.",
        "A: Yeah, I think that\u2019s the one, when all those kids, children were starving and\nwhere was the world?",
        "Q: I guess what I\u2019m wondering 1s, when you, over the years have learned about\nsomething horrible that\u2019s in the midst of happening, like in Rwanda all the -- they\nwere both, you know, massacring left and right the -- you know, the -- the two\nethnic groups there. Or what has gone on in the past five years in -- in Yugoslavia.",
        "A: I was just going to say -- mention Yugoslavia. Now that, when we saw the\npictures coming from there, we looked, I said, my God, it\u2019s like concentration\ncamp. There was no reason for that either.",
        "Q: I guess my question to you is, when those things have -- when you\u2019ve seen\nthose things in the news, or read about them, does it frighten you, does it concern\nyou that --",
        "A: No, it makes you angry. It brings back all the memories, all that we went\nthrough and it makes you angry that the world didn\u2019t learn.",
        "Q: Have any of those events caused you to take any action, or -- or-or --",
        "A: Action as far as what?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know. Giving money, mobilizing support for -- I -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m --",
        "A: For who?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m inventing things here. I\u2019Il take that the answer 1s no.\nLast question, I know I\u2019ve taken a lot of your time already. Not my last question,\nbut the last thing that they wanted me to ask you about history. What about\nobserving Israel becoming its own country in 48 and then the trials and\ntribulations of the past almost 50 years?",
        "A: It\u2019s 50 years, you\u2019re right.",
        "Q: Has that been -- have there been things that have happened there that have been",
        "A: It will be 50 years next year.",
        "Q: Next year. Has -- has anything that had happened there concerned you,\ndisturbed you?",
        "A: Everything that happens there concerns me, of course. It\u2019s a beautiful country\nand it\u2019s long overdue. I mean, Jewish people need the country like that. And they\nwork very hard for it, those people over there.",
        "Q: Let me rephrase the question, when I said concerns you I -- I meant disturbs\nyou.",
        "A: Some of the thing that happens over there, yes.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Oh, all the problems and bombings they have, where innocent people, innocent\nchildren die for no reason. I mean, there is -- there is no -- there is no reason for it,\nfor that. That\u2019s -- it\u2019s a concern for, I think, the whole world.",
        "Q: How did you feel when the -- the whole Intifada started to happen and the --\nhow -- maybe I\u2019Il ask in general how you have felt about the Israeli government\u2019s\ntreatment of the Palestinians within their country?",
        "A: See, we just came back from Israel. And what we hear on the news over here\nand read in the paper, it\u2019s a whole different thing than what goes on over there. So\nwe really can\u2019t -- can\u2019t judge.",
        "Q: Okay. I\u2019ve just got a couple of questions in closing to ask you and then I\u2019 Il let\nyou to your dinner.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: What would you like people to understand? Someone, let\u2019s say of my\ngeneration who certainly did not go through what you went through. Or for that\nmatter people who are of your generation, who were here, or elsewhere and didn't\nexperience what you and your husband experienced. What would you like people\nto understand that perhaps they don\u2019t understand or fully appreciate about the\nHolocaust and the experiences you had?",
        "A: Well, let me think.",
        "Q: Is there something you would most like people to come away from hearing this\ninterview understanding?",
        "A: Not so much understanding, but maybe more aware of what goes on in the\nworld, and maybe quicker to react on what happens on the other side or wherever it\nhappens.",
        "Q: Meaning elsewhere in the world? On the other side?",
        "A: I mean, yeah, around the world. Because the world is getting smaller every day.",
        "Q: The last question I was going to ask you seems related to your answer, maybe\nyou\u2019re already answered it. How do we keep this from happening again?",
        "A: Tolerance, and be aware, and teach your children not to follow blindly.",
        "Q: So if a leader comes up who starts promising things that sound too good to be\ntrue?",
        "A: Question it, and don\u2019t believe it til you see it. And let\u2019s hope that the younger\ngenerations will be smart enough to see through somebody like this.",
        "Q: Has there been anybody, any politician si-since you\u2019 ve been in this country\nthat\u2019s particularly worried you or any not necessarily politician but figure that\u2019s\nparticularly ba -- concerned you, that could be, I don\u2019t know, a charismatic enough\nleader to cause trouble?",
        "A: Yeah, except I can\u2019t think of the name of the person.",
        "Q: Give me a hint.",
        "A: But there was one not too long ago 1n the picture. Pat Robertson 1s one. Is it --\nhave I got the right name?",
        "Q: Yes. Oh, hold it, which -- which Pat? There\u2019s Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson,\nPat --",
        "A: Well, the both of them. One is the politician, the other [indecipherable] and the\nother one the -- the religious guy, and they\u2019re equally bad.",
        "Q: Is that -- 1s one of those who you were trying to think of or is there somebody\nelse?",
        "A: [indecipherable] well, there are probably some others around that not too well\nknown at this point, but --",
        "Q: Hm. By any chance, did you ever read the book, \u201cIt Can Happen Here?\u201d",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: It was written in the mid-\u201930\u2019s about how a fascist state could start in this\ncountry.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s quite a book.",
        "A: Did you read it?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: It is available in the library?",
        "Q: Sure, it\u2019s by Sinclair Lewis.",
        "A: Oh. I think Pll go get it.",
        "Q: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s quite a book. He wrote it in the middle of the 30\u2019s, two years -- 1935,\ntwo years after Hitler came to power, and he wrote a very persuasive scenario of\nexactly how da -- you know, the right politician and the right mix of bad economic\nsituation --",
        "A: Mm-hm [indecipherable] that\u2019s all it needs.",

        "A: The only hope in this country is that -- who they gonna pick for the scapegoat?",
        "Q: How so\u201d?",
        "A: Well, they can pick the blacks, they can pick the Jews, they can pick the\nHispanics. Who they gonna pick?",
        "Q: Well, there\u2019s also the sort of generic, whoever the last people came into the\ndoor, you know, as the most recent immigrants that are taking the jobs away, or\nwhatever.",
        "A: Well, I guess we\u2019re back to square one again, huh? There we go for the Jews,\nhuh?",
        "Q: I really appreciate all the time you\u2019ve given us this afternoon. This concludes --\nis there anything you\u2019d like to say in closing?",

Yes, very possibly, I -- I will -- I believe real strongly in\npreserving history. You might want to put that down, cause the sound of the paper\nrattling.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "Q: Okay, the first -- the first thing that -- that I\u2019m going to do is, they asked me to\nfill in a couple of gaps in the interview that you did with them on the video. There\nwere a couple of things, n-not so much during the war, but before and immediately\nafter that they wanted me to ask about, to just fill in the gaps. And then we\u2019ll focus\non from after the war to the present. And if at any point you want to stop and take a",
        "Q: Like to start by asking you about your family, about -- let\u2019s start with your\nparents. Who were they, what were they like as people, as parents?",
        "Q: How do you spell that, his first name?",
        "Q: And how can you s -- how do you spell that?",
        "Q: And so at what time would that name change have happened, roughly?",
        "Q: And so you say they changed it because of the situation. Do you mean -- how\ndo you mean?",
        "Q: How much age difference?",
        "Q: Tell me about your sisters, their names.",
        "Q: And their names?",
        "Q: Just going to move the microphone a little closer so we can pick you up better.\nNot a whole lot, but just a little. And they all made it?",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "Q: And what has happened to your sisters?",
        "Q: So you\u2019re the only one that left right away?",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019ll get to that, cause that\u2019s much of what we want to talk about. Were\nyou poor, middle class, well-to-do?",
        "Q: Your -- your parent\u2019s parents, your grandparents, how would you describe th-\nthem in terms of their -- or theirs s-status financially, socially?",
        "Q: He was a what?",
        "Q: And on the other side?",
        "Q: And you had said in the interview that I saw that your -- your father was able to\ntrace your ancestors in Hungary back to the early --",
        "Q: -- 1700\u2019s.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I want to jump around a little bit, cause again we\u2019re filling in little gaps in the\nprevious interview. You went to a Catholic school when it\u2019s --",
        "Q: High school, 1939. I\u2019m curious, you had gone to Jewish schools prior to that.",
        "Q: Why not a Jewish high school? How did you end up there?",
        "Q: So it was --",
        "Q: Specialized in what way\u201d?",
        "Q: And you were gifted in art?",
        "Q: I understand you still --",
        "Q: Te-Tell me about friendships that you had in high school, both with Jewish girls\nand non-Jewish girls, if in fact you did have friendships with non-Jewish girls.",
        "Q: Was that by choice or by official design that you\u2019d -- you stayed amongst\nyourselves?",
        "Q: Would you -- how would you -- I\u2019m thinking in terms of many American cities\nwhere blacks live on one side of town and whites live on another side of town,\nwhere -- whereas there might not at this time be a legal reason why they can\u2019t live\ntogether, they often don\u2019t, and I\u2019m wondering was it a similar situation or was it --",
        "Q: That was my question.",
        "Q: Okay. Cause I know in some cities in Europe there had been the remnants of\nghettoes from previous eras.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I was trying to establish.",
        "Q: Okay. So you did not have friends with non-Jewish kids that you were clo --",
        "Q: Tell me about them. What -- what memories do you have of these nuns that you\ngot that feeling about?",
        "Q: This -- so this nun that told you you better get on your knees, wa -- I\u2019m unclear,\nwas she saying that with malice or with concern?",
        "Q: What about the other kids? You intimated in your previous interview that you\nhad experienced some -- some anti-Semitic --",
        "Q: But back when you were going to school, what did you experience in terms of\nany -- or did you -- any problems with any of the other Gentile girls?",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s talk about the conditions of your deportation from your hometown.\nW -- How did that come about? You -- you rushed through it a little bit in your\nprevious interview. I mean, how did you find out that it was going to happen and\nwhat -- could you tell us, sort of take us through from when you found out that it\nwas going to happen til when you were actually --",
        "Q: I hate -- I hate to say it, we are going to need to do something about the phone.",
        "Q: Would you trust me -- Ill be happy to put it back the way it was.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: All right. One small thing, and that is, 1f you could make an effort not to put\nyour hands in front of the microphone. I mean --",
        "Q: -- only -- there were -- there were -- there was one time when you were putting\nyour hands like so.",
        "Q: No, you were just telling a story and you had your hands --",
        "Q: So if you could just -- don\u2019t be too self conscious, but just be aware --",
        "Q: -- that if you put your hand in front of it --",
        "Q: -- it creates a problem. Okay, so you were locked into the ghetto. My question\nis, when did you find out that you were going to be deported, and how did that\ncome about? How --",
        "Q: And how did you find out, and were there others deported before you and was it\nsomething you were expecting, or --",
        "Q: But my question is, what was it like when they took you away from your\nhometown?",
        "Q: Yes --",
        "Q: From the ghetto. When -- when you left --",
        "Q: Wh-When you were --",
        "Q: -- when you were taken fr-from the ghetto and you were --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s step back a little bit. What was th-the transport like in the car? What was\nthe -- I know it wasn\u2019t very pleasant, but can you describe what the -- what it was\nlike?",
        "Q: Did people stand, sit, lie down?",
        "Q: And wh-what did you do for water, or relieving yourself, or --",
        "Q: In your -- in your interview that I saw and read the transcript of, you say that\nyou were supposed to have gone to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: How did you learn that, that you were supposed to have -- that that train --",
        "Q: What did you know ahead of time? What had filtered through to your\ncommunity about what was going on and -- I mean, did you -- did you through the\ngrapevine hear -- learn things? Did you listen to the shortwave?",
        "Q: Had you -- I guess my question is, by the time you were on that train,\nsupposedly for Auschwitz, what did you know of -- about the camps or -- or how\npeople were being killed? Did you know any of that?",

        "Q: When you -- when you got back to -- 1s 1t Debrecen, how do you pronounce --",
        "Q: Debrecen. I -- I understand from the interview you gave before that you were\nreceived very poorly by the people who were left there, that they were not --",
        "Q: You said not everybody was like that. Can you tell me more about the varieties\nof different reactions that you might have gotten from --",
        "Q: How -- just so I get an idea before I ask you the next several questions, how\nlong were you there before you made the decision to leave the country?",
        "Q: So a little over six months you were there?",
        "Q: What --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s step back a little bit before that, I -- I\u2019d like to talk to you about what life\nwas like there in your hometown before you decided to leave. You say you were\nthere for about six months or so. How did you -- you -- you came back home,\nthere\u2019s noth -- not a st -- there\u2019s no furniture, there\u2019s no nothing, you --",

        "Q: Of the Jewish population in your hometown, were you all on that one train that\nwas turned around?",

        "Q: Roughly, do you know -- have any idea?",
        "Q: But do you have any idea from reading or speaking with people s-since the war\nhas ended, any notion of how many people survived from your hometown, of the\nJewish population, roughly?",

        "Q: So what was it like for you to come back to your hometown that had treated you\nbadly, if a -- if I\u2019m making sense, to come back to the same people who had been\npersecuting you beforehand and to come back and there being such a small number\nof Jews that were left and I guess -- maybe I\u2019m asking a -- an inappropriate\nquestion, that it sounds like your concerns were much more concrete, day to day,\nwhat you were going to eat, how were you going to get by.

Given what you had just been through in Europe, was it difficult for\nyou to be around non-Jewish people, period? Were you afraid of them, were you\nconcerned? I guess what I\u2019m trying to ask you Is --",

        "Q: Right. It\u2019s a problem.",

        "Q: That\u2019s what I thought.",
        "Q: That -- that made it. That\u2019s what I thought. Did you, during the time that you\nwere courting, talk much about your respective experiences in the war?",
        "Q: What do you mean by that?",
        "Q: Mm, I understand that, but you said probably not enough, the implication being\nthat there should have been more.",
        "Q: We'll get to that. That seems to be a very consistent experience of people, that\nthere was a -- a period of time, sometimes a very long period of time where it was\nnot comfortable to talk about 1t amongst themselves, or with others.",
        "Q: But you tried?",
        "Q: So it sounds like --",
        "Q: So, because they couldn\u2019t conceptualize it, there was little point in discussing\nit?",
        "Q: Plus in the case of your -- your aunts and uncles, they had lost family, so there\nwas, in addition to the lack of empathy for what you\u2019d been through, there was also\nthat -- the -- the pain and the grief of having lost the family. What about -- did you\nknow other -- other than your husband, before you met your husband, did you\nknow other survivors that were there in Detroit?",
        "Q: Did you ever talk to them?",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "Q: This is, you know, I mean no disrespect to ask this, but did you ever feel guilty\nthat you were as lucky as you were?",

        "Q: You know, when I first read yours and your husband\u2019s stories 1n the transcripts\nthat they sent me, I was struck by the disparity of your experiences, what he -- he\nwent through and what you went through",

        "Q: I was just wondering whether -- I mean, certainly I know people in my own life\nwhose -- who are my age whose parents -- where one of them was a survivor and\none of them was not. So obviously it happened, but that\u2019s -- I\u2019m just wondering in\nyour life whether that was something -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s an academic\nquestion cause you did meet and you did marry, and --",

        "Q: Did you ever have any conversations, was there ever any question in your\nminds that you would have children?",
        "Q: Well, the reason I ask 1s I\u2019ve heard two different things from people. Number\none, pondering the now clich\u00e9 question of do I want to bring children into this\nworld, knowing what I know about what is possible. And the flip side of that which\nis I want to have as many children as I can to repopulate the world. So that\u2019s why I\nasked.",

When the crash of the stock market in the United States and the\n[indecipherable] got over to Europe by the mid 30\u2019s, it had an effect on my father\u2019s\nbusiness. And then eventually, in 1938, Hitler was in power and that was getting\ndownhill. And by 1942 my father was in a labor camp.",
        "A: I don\u2019t even know, I remember my grandparents as old people. Somehow they\nwere always old. My pare -- my mother\u2019s parents and my grandfather had a\nbusiness, he was a well-to-do man. They lived in a beautiful home.",

And they had the business on the\nbottom of the -- you know, the street floor and the house was up on top, and it was\na beautiful home with beautiful furniture and all that. We used to go there to visit\nand spent -- I spent a lot of vacation time over there. My grandmother was a\nbeautiful woman, a very stately lady. And my grandfather was a sweet old man.",

I just remember him during the hun -- you know, Jewish holidays.\nHe was a religious man, not overly, but he was you know, the both sides were very\nobservant Jewish people. I remember my father\u2019s father during the -- the Succoth\nholiday.

        "A: -- when the troubles started in the 30\u2019s, you had to trace your ancestry back as\nfar as you could go, because by 1938 - \u201939, they were picking up people who were\nnot so-called Hungarians. See, by that time we had a lot of people coming from\nSlovakia, from Poland, from other countries to Hungary, and they were mostly, I\nsuppose at that time looking for those people.",
        "A: Little did we know that nothing 1s going to help. And yes, my father did trace\nour ancestry back into Hungary to the 1700\u2019s. On paper.",
        "A: High school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: There was no Jewish high school for girls, that\u2019s why.",
        "A: And this was a specialized school, and unfortunately only the Catholic school\nsystem had it.",
        "A: It\u2019s more of an art oriented high school.",
        "A: Sort of.",
        "A: That was where we learned dress designing, tailoring, sewing, drawing, and all\nassociated with the arts.",
        "A: Actually, well we had quite a few Jewish girls going to that same school where\nI went. I don\u2019t mean too many, but you know, those were very small classes\nactually, so they had maybe I don\u2019t know whether -- the first year I think maybe\nwe had about 10 Jewish girls, and after that they sort of left. They\u2019re maybe were\ntwo or three of them left altogether in the class, and -- but as far as non-Jewish\ngirls, other than being in the school with them no, I don\u2019t think I was really\nfriendly with any of them. That were strange over there, see, because we grew up\nseparated, you know, from early childhood, and we never mixed with non-Jewish\npeople. We only wil -- saw Jewish kids. So by the time you were a teenager in your\nlate teens in high school it\u2019s -- we were friendly but we were never really so-called\nfriends.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was a [indecipherable] really, it just the way it worked out.",
        "A: No, no, no. There was one area where most -- were more dominated by Jewish\npeople, mostly by the real Orthodox and the Hassidic type of Jews, but other than\nthat, no. There was no area where you had to live.",

        "A: -- I know, and I\u2019ve been arguing that. I never lived in a shtetl, no.",
        "A: At least not in my time in Hungary, no.",
        "A: Not close friends, no. But by the time I got to that high school, it was already\ntroubled times. Hitler was already on the horizons and as sweet as the nuns were --\nthere were a couple of them who were wonderful, and I really think of them highly\nforever, because they were nice human beings. But then there were others who just\nas soon would have hand me over to the first Nazi who came about.",
        "A: Well, I remember especially the one nun -- you know, it -- I mean, you go to a\nCatholic school and there\u2019s -- during the time you go and you have to say some\nkind of a prayer, at least in those days they did, and I remember at one time this\nparticular nun came up to me and said, you better go down on your knee and pray\nbecause what\u2019s happening out in the world. And in those days a lot of Jewish\npeople did convert to Catholicism and -- hoping it will save them, but nothing did.\nNothing did because you not only had to prove that you lived in Hungary centuries\nback -- you also had to prove that you were not Jewish centuries back, so it didn\u2019t\nhelp. I remember when we were in the wagon already, there was a young woman\ndoctor with us, she never knew she was Jewish. Her parents converted during the\nfirst World War or right after, so she was born, you know, as Christian. And yet\nshe was considered a Jew.",
        "A: No, I think it was malice and no concern, because if it would have been\nconcern, I probably wouldn\u2019t remember it the way I do.",
        "A: Well, while we were in the class it was fine, there was no problem. Well, the\nthing I mentioned then, I believe it was that when we were being marched from the\nghetto to the brick factory, there was one of the girls that I went to school with and\nI used to walk with her home from school, and she thought of nothing picking up a\nstone and throw it at me. See, people -- we were walking in the middle of the road\nand the people were standing on both sides on the sidewalk and watching us\nleaving town.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember any, really.",
        "A: [indecipherable] okay, let me go back to the Jewish school, 1938, when our\nprincipal came into the class -- well, I guess he went to every class, to tell us\nwhat\u2019s happening in the world and what we may accep -- expect. And he had -- a\nbig guy, and he had tears in his eye -- his eyes as he was talking to us. That was\n1938, and I think s -- well, at first -- after that 1t was getting harder to hold a job if\nyou were a Jew. I remember in 1939 it was when my father lost his job, he was a --\na district manager for a -- a farm machinery company, and he lost his job because\nhe was a Jew. And then 1942 -- well, in 1939, when Hitler gave back the northern\npart of Hungary that belonged to Czechoslovakia, and that time to Hungary. And\nmy father was in a uniform, the Hungarian army\u2019s uniform. He fought in the first\nWorld War, so he was called up again to pay the country back. And by 1941 he\nwas called into labor camp, \u201941 - \u201942 then they let him out for awhile and then they\n-- took him back again. In 1944, March 19\", it was on a Sunday afternoon when\nthe Germans -- German army flew over Hungary. I can still see it, it was a dreary,\nnasty day. No sunshine at all, and I guess it was foreboding of what was coming.\nAnd we saw the plane fly over our city and after that it went one, two, three. They\ncame in on the 19\". By April fifth we had to put on the Jewish star. May sixth we\nwere put into the ghetto. I was watching them building the six foot high wall all\naround the area. In my town, in Debrecen, they had to make two different ghettos\nbecause there was a main road going to the railroad station which they couldn\u2019t cut\noff. So there was a smaller side where we lived and there was a larger side on the\nother side. So our house happened to be in the smaller area, so that\u2019s where we\nwere. And to the day the wall was finished we did not believe it, that it will\nhappen. It was impossible, we lived there forever. I was born there, I grew up\nthere. People were hoping that the mayor of the city, little did they know that he\nhad no say so, won\u2019t let it happen. But at any rate, May 6, 1944, we were locked\ninto the ghetto. And in June --",

The way we found out we were gonna\ngo was a Sunday morning that the people came in with the loudspeaker, walked\nthrough the stra -- the streets, it was Sunday morning and th -- they said start\npacking because by the afternoon you all have to be at the other side in the big\nghetto. And then we knew. I mean ho-how long can you stay stupid, right? I mean,\nyou had to know something was happening. My father wasn\u2019t home and there we\nwere, my mother and the four of us and a -- a little cousin of mine, my mother\u2019s\nnephew, her sister\u2019s son who came with us to live. And that\u2019s it. We started to pack\nwhatever we could and by noon people were coming into the house to make sure\nthat we\u2019re not taking anything valuable with us. So much so that there were two\nguys and one woman who came to the house, and the woman took my mother into\nthe bedroom to check her inside, literally, her inside, to make sure that she is not\nhiding anything 1n her body that\u2019s valuable. And the afternoon we were over at the\nother side. And that was that. That was Sunday afternoon and then, for a strange\nreason, luckily, they brought my father back with a bunch of other people in his\ngroup. So at that point in time we were all together. My family and a -- a brother of\nmy mother -- father and her -- his sister. And another cousin of mine.",
        "A: From my hometown --",
        "A: -- or from the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, we were in our home. After that we were homeless.",
        "A: We were homeless. That\u2019s what we were.",
        "A: And then we stayed on the other side. Not long, maybe a few days, I\u2019m not -- I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly what it was, four or five days maybe. And they were --\nthat\u2019s when we were walking to the brick factory. And we stayed there for about a\nweek or so, and that was a horror. That was absolute horror. We had to get into\ngroups every day and walk down to the railroad tracks and wait in case we were\ngoing to be taken someplace. We didn\u2019t know where, but we were going to be\ntaken someplace. And then they started to group people together, and we ended up\nin a group, they had many children in the families. And I think I was the fifth or\nsixth there and finally they put us into the wagons and we started off. We went to\nthe border of Hungary and Slovakia and I remember there was one of the\nHungarian gendars who was on the -- standing on the back of the train. I guess,\nnow in looking back I think the wagons, the car we were in, the cattle car we were\nin must have been the last one. Either that or each one of them had one of those\nguys standing there, traveling with us. And that guy, I remember when it -- they\nstart the train and he said to us, that\u2019s as far as I can go with you. God be with you.\nSo he must have been somebody with a little heart, or maybe he knew where we\nwere supposed to be going. And that was that and I remember at that point I had\nthe feeling that this is it, you know, all of a sudden it just hit that I\u2019ll probably\nnever get out of the cattle car alive. And some miracle happened, for some reason\nwe Stayed there overnight and the train didn\u2019t move and th -- early in the morning\nit started to roll again and we were looking through the cracks which way we\u2019re\ngoing and we were going back into Hungary, we were in the middle of Hungary.\nNext we knew we start to now s -- go to Budapest. And soon after that we kept\ngoing and we crossed the border to Austria and -- and there we were. We ended up\nin Austria.",
        "A: Well, if you can imagine -- you know what a cattle car looks like? Okay. Can\nyou imagine that filled with about a hundred people or more? Families, children,\nold people. Small children, some who were lame and not able to move readily, you\nknow, that sort of thing.",
        "A: Whatever you were able to do, that\u2019s what you did.",
        "A: Well, they -- they -- we had a bucket of water and we had a bucket for other\nthings, and I remember when we start around the outskirt of Budapest, they gave us\nsome fresh water there, and that was it. We were very lucky because we didn\u2019t stay\nin the wagon very long. It was just one of those freak things that you don\u2019t have an\nanswer for.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, everybody was supposed to go to Auschwitz. Now we found out here in\nthe United States already, just a few years ago, there 1s a -- a historian, a Hungarian\nman, he teaches now at New York University. He wrote a book called, \u201cThe\nGenocide of the Hungarian Jews.\u201d You may have heard of it. And he found out\nthat at that point, where we were supposed to be crossing into Poland -- now we\nwere told at the time they couldn\u2019t take us through because they bombed the\nviaduct and the [indecipherable] the train couldn't get through. But what he found\nout was that there was a group of people who made a deal with the Germans to be\ntaken out of Hungary from Budapest, or wherever, from all over the country. And\nsomebody made a mistake who was directing the -- the cattle cars, and by the time\nthey realized that they took those people on the way to Auschwitz and called\nEichmann, the -- the trainload was too far gone to bring them back. And\nsupposedly Eichmann told him, whoever was in charge, to find another group with\nthe same amount of people in it and take them to Austria. And supposedly that was\nthe group we were in.",

We knew there was trouble, because by 1940\n- \u00b041, many, many, many Slovakian Jewish people were in Hungary. They all were\nrunning away from Slovakia, only to be caught in Hungary.",

There was one day when the put us\ninto the wagons and we were to be taken to Bergen-Belsen. And that was the only\ncruelty that I saw, when one of those guards, a woman, a Ukrainian woman guard\nhit my father on the head with a bat of some sort, a piece of wood, because he\ncouldn\u2019t run fast enough for her. But other than that there was no other what you\nwould call, you know, cruelty like you hear from people who were in Auschwitz.",
        "A: We were all together.",
        "A: We left our house together and we came back together.",
        "A: It was decided for us, we had no other way to go. When we were -- we were\nliberated April 10\u201c when the Russians came in and a few [indecipherable] to the\nwest they were still fighting, so there was no way to go except back where we\ncame from.",
        "A: Oh, of course we were. Then we were leaving -- we were told to leave. There\nwas no choice, we were told to leave because they had to burn down the camp, it\nwas in such an awful condition that that had to be burned.",
        "A: Not for us, no, no. See, there was still fighting, the war wasn\u2019t over yet, and\nthen we were liberated.",
        "A: That trip? Over a week. We walked on foot. We somewhere along the line\nmanaged to get a wagon with a horse. So some of the people who couldn't do\nwalking well enough -- see, I had a cousin of mine who had polio since he was a\nsmall child, he was two years old and he had polio and he never walked. And so\nsome of those people were sitting on top of the wagon and the rest of us walked.\nWe walked this way and the Russian soldiers came that way.",
        "A: What did we eat? Well, we stopped at different farmhouses and whatever we\ncould find, we took.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Most of them, yeah. They left so fast they even left the hot food on the table.",
        "A: Be -- they were afraid of the Russians, of course.",
        "A: Debrecen.",
        "A: Well, I wouldn\u2019t say all the people, but when we got off the train 1n the station\nand we were walking the main street towards our home, and they looked at us --\nbut then, these were young people, not older, young people, they greeted us, you\nknow, how come -- what are you doing back here? You were supposed to be dead.",
        "A: You know, it was such a long time ago and what I can remember is there was\nreally no time to look at reactions because we had nothing on our body except the\nclothes we left a year ago -- a year before that. And th -- you know, our first -- we\nwalked into the house and there was nothing there. It was totally empty, everything\nwas taken out. So our first priority was to look around and see if we can start a new\nlife. So there was even no time to look and see what people thought and how they\nreacted.",
        "A: Well, we got back there in 1945, May, and I think by end of the year I decided\nthat I had to leave.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t convince my family to leave in the same time, because, see my\nmother have -- had at that time two sisters over here and lots of relatives. And I\nmust say they were very nice, they sn -- you know, send the papers right away and\neverything that they needed to do, they did, to get us over here as a family. But it\ntook longer than I had patience for, and I wanted to leave.",
        "A: Well, we came back home and you were looking for people you knew before, to\nsee if anybody came back, my uncle, my aunt\u2019s husband wasn\u2019t with us, he was in\na labor camp someplace. Luckily he survived and he came back. Yet her son, who\nwas somewhere in Germany, never made it back home. So we used to go every day\nto the center point of the Jewish life over there in that time, that was hastily put\ntogether, to look at names who they found and you know, who was alive. And that\nwas that.",
        "A: We had no money.",
        "A: [indecipherable] well, there was a place called the Joint Distribution\nCommittee, if you ever heard of it.",
        "A: And they gave us some clothes, they gave us a little money to get started with.\nAnd the rest we just, I don\u2019t know, see, I -- I had my parents. I had my father. He\ntook care of all that.",
        "A: He must have, some kind of a work, because eventually he did do something to\nprovide for us.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No, not any of my classmates, no. See, it was a total chaos when we went back,\nit was still soon after really, so-called liberation. Everything was in chaos. The\nschool I -- the Catholic school I went to was disbanded, there were no more nuns\naround. It was -- I don\u2019t know, everybody was everywhere.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, they -- they took 12,000 [indecipherable] the population of\n12,000 Jewish people in that city. That city wa -- had a population of the w -- at\nthat time about 120,000 people, and 10 percent were the Jewish population.",
        "A: Not a whole lot.",
        "A: See, the transport we were in was they weren't only from Hungary -- from\nDebrecen, they brought people over there from outlying areas in different stories.\nSo we had people with us from Szolnok, we had people with us from Szeged, from\nMiskolc, from all over the place. That was, I guess, the biggest city around and so\nthey brought people over there.",
        "A: I have a book, I could -- I could look it up for you.",
        "A: But I\u2019m really not sure. Not -- not too many, I know that.\nwondering what it was like to come back to your hometown in this chaos and such\na different place than you grew up. Was it -- had many other people left?",
        "A: Everybody.",
        "A: You mean the --",
        "A: -- people who came back?",
        "A: Oh, that part of it was -- th-they all stayed. No, they didn\u2019t leave.",
        "A: That was in Austria.",
        "A: Well, for one thing, since I was the oldest in the family -- I saw no future there,\nfor one thing. And I always, since I was a little girl, I always wanted to come to the\nUnited States of America.",
        "A: \u2019'm not sure exactly why, but I -- at the -- you know, when I was little child, I\ndon\u2019t know why, because I heard my parents talk about it so much and we have --\nwe had so many relatives already here. And that sounded like an exciting place to\nlive. So after the war I had a choice of either going to Israel, where I also had\nrelatives, because my father\u2019s whole family was in Israel by that time, including\nmy grandparents. And -- or come to the United States. And since my mother had\ntwo sisters who were here and they ask me, they says, please go to the United\nStates because I want to go there someday too and be with -- be with my sisters.\nAnd they were very nice people, they send me the appropriate papers and here I\nam.",
        "A: About two years. Close to two years.",
        "A: No, no, I stayed in Hungary til the very end of 1946, yeah, I worked a little bit.",
        "A: What did I do? It\u2019s a good question. See, by that time they had a very good\nZionist organization built up already and a lot of young people coming and they\nhad all sorts of offices there, and I worked in one of those places there. And for --\nend of \u201946, in December, or -- yeah, and then I left. And then I went to France, I st\n-- | stayed 1n Paris for about eight weeks until I could get in a ship and then I came.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I had lots of friends.",
        "A: There was lot of young people who came back from labor camps, from\nAuschwitz without anybody, without their families. So what -- those were busy\ntimes. If you could do away with all the other events that led up to that, that could\nhave been a very nice time. But you know, that sort of thing lingering in the back\nof your mind, I tried to make the most of it. And everybody was trying to look for a\nway to get out.",
        "A: Well, like I said, [indecipherable] there were a lot of young people coming back\nand I had a lot of friends, and most of my friends, by the way, ended up in -- in\nIsrael. [indecipherable] I was friends with. And they were just, I guess, for lack of\na better word, trying to bide our time until we could find a way to get out, is what it\nwas.",
        "A: Everybody was looking to, there was no -- no future there.",
        "A: Some people did, it depends, you know, where you had connections, or where\nyour interests were. Or whether -- where your luck was, really, to get you wherever\nyou wanted to go.",
        "A: Oh yeah, quite a few didn\u2019t come back. Yes, and some who even died before\nbecause they were taken to labor camp.",
        "A: Some.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, see, what happened is my father took me to Budapest, put me on the train\nand then before the train left, he went around and see if he could find somebody\nwho was going the same way as I was. And sure enough, he did find a young lady,\nsomewhat older than myself at that time, who not only was coming to Paris, but\nalso was going to the United States of America. Not only to the States, but going to\nthe same city that I was going to and to the same neighborhood where I was going\nto.",
        "A: Detroit, Michigan, yes. To the same area where my family lived, and so we\nbecame sort of fast friends and he -- she took care of me. I stayed with her in the\nsame hotel while we were in Paris and he -- she left a few weeks before I did. But\nshe had a nephew over there who was a concert violinist and he\u2019s been living in\nParis for some time by then. So she put him in charge of me, so to speak. So I was\nwell taken care of until I got on the ship and my family took me off in the city of\nNew York.",
        "A: There were a lot of Jewish people coming, yes. Some were going to Cuba, some\nto the United States and some Mexico and they were going all over the place.",
        "A: About five days, I believe.",
        "A: But see, I left my family behind in the hope that within a year\u2019s time I would be\nwith them also. So I didn\u2019t just walk out on them. But I guess it wasn\u2019t mean to be\nbecause not even a year -- before the year was up after I left, I -- they closed the\nborders and nobody ever left from there until 1956.",
        "A: Who closed the border? The Russians.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s why they couldn\u2019t leave, when every -- everything stopped.\nAnd by 1956, my parents became ill, my father had a couple of heart attacks. My\nmother came down with th-the Parkinson disease and there was no way for them to\nleave. And this is why my youngest sister left home -- I mean, stayed home in\n1956, because the other two were already married, and she was still single, being\nthe youngest. She was just a young girl. When I came out here, I remember I used\nto send her money to take dance classes and I used to send -- I sent her money to\nbuy a bicycle when I started to work. And she was the victim of it all.",
        "A: She stayed there and she\u2019s still there.",
        "A: That\u2019s 1997, right?",
        "A: In the same town, yes. My parents are gone and she\u2019s still there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I had two -- I had three cousins who came back from Auschwitz. See, my\nmother\u2019s whole family ended up in Auschwitz, I had four aunts -- five. One, two --\nfour -- four aunts and an uncle who all perished in Auschwitz. And some younger\ncousins who were just small children, and the three who survived were, you know,\nyoung adults, and they made it.",
        "A: Yeah, from my mother\u2019s side, yes.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: -- to see -- my cousins, all three of them were home long before we got home\nbecause Auschwitz was liberated in January and we didn\u2019t get home til April. And\nthey came to see us and that\u2019s how we found out what happened.",
        "A: Mm-hm, except the two sisters [indecipherable] she had here in the United\nStates.",
        "A: That was hard. That was hard, but there was no other thing to do but deal with\nit. You know, there is an interesting thing that I remember, when they were taking\nthe people, the first transport from Hungary to Auschwitz and there was -- my\nmother\u2019s family were among the group, and I remember my mother walk up\n[indecipherable] and said, I had a terrible dream. She had a dream seeing the\nfamily walking down the road and there were two rows of candles on each side of\nthem, lit, as they were walking down the road. Now by the time we got home it\nwas more or less a fact.",
        "A: There was really no time to grieve like you do nowadays when somebody dies.\nYou had to keep alive. You were alive, you had to go on. But I think you never\nreally stop grieving. That\u2019s also just part of our life.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was overwhelming. I\u2019ve never seen such big buildings in my life. Oops. It\nwas exciting, it was unbelievable. I think I must have felt like Alice in Wonderland\nwhen I got off the boat.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m a very emotional person so I guess I -- that was just exciting.",
        "A: I guess, the fact, it probably did. I remember -- oops -- oh, I have to go back a\nlittle bit.",
        "A: On the way to -- from Paris to the ship, you know you take a little boat that\ncarries you out there to the sea. And there was a couple, an older couple sitting\nacross from me and there I was sitting all by myself with a little book of English\nand Hungarian translation and I tried to read and brush up of whatever English I\nknew. And they were trying to find out who I was and what does a young girl do\non a boat like this all by herself and where I came from and where I\u2019m going and\nthey tried to talk to me and up until that point I thought I could speak English.\nWell, when I heard them talk, forget it. I didn\u2019t understand almost [indecipherable]\nwhat they\u2019re saying. So I found out eventually that they were from Brooklyn\nvisiting Europe and coming back from Europe and they were very sweet people,\nthey took me under their arm. When they found out I was from Hungary, they went\nall over the boat searching for a person, another person from Hungary I can be with\nthrough the trip so I won\u2019t be lost. As it happened there were quite a few\nHungarians there, Jews and non-Jews. And the person they found for me to be with\nand eat, you know, the meals with, was a non-Jewish person, a guy from\nCleveland, of all places, who took his wife to Hungary because she was sick and\ntook her there for some kind of treatment and he was coming back to the States.\nAnd when we got to New York, this lady from Brooklyn grabbed my arm and\npulled me out to the, you know, end of the wherever there was in the boat. They\nsays, hey look, look, that\u2019s the Statue of Liberty. So that was my introduction to\nthe Statue of Liberty.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: No. Do you mind if I [indecipherable]\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m different, but I never really had too many\nchances to be with Gentiles, because when we got to Paris, I had some friends\nalready there from home whom I met, they were all Jewish people, young -- young\npeople. So I had no reason to get friendly or get close to any of the Gentiles. And\nwhen I got to the United States my family didn\u2019t -- weren\u2019t friends with any\nGentiles. So again, I didn\u2019t have a chance to meet any.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, they came from Detroit. I did have a relative from New York, it\u2019s a cousin\nof my mother whom my aunt and uncle took me to visit, and they lived on Park\nAvenue someplace in a huge apartment with a beautiful, big, brown dog. And they\nwere very lovely people. They were very impressed the way I looked, coming from\nwhere I came from, and that was that. I never saw them again after that.",
        "A: No, not too --",
        "A: Emotionally what way?",
        "A: [indecipherable] with my -- my aunt and my uncle, yes it was a little bit\nemotional, but with the cousins, these were already second, third generation\nAmericans. They [indecipherable] They lived their life and that was a lot of story.",
        "A: Well my -- oh well, before the tur -- way before the turn of the cen -- middle of\nthe last century --",
        "A: -- they were coming over here, the uncles of my parents.",
        "A: A-Aunts and uncles and --",
        "A: No, not a whole lot, because they had to come back. See, I arrived here in\nMarch and at that time I think the tax time was in March in those days, if I\nremember right. Also, my -- one of my cousins, my aunt\u2019s daughter who picked me\nup had her birthday in March, so they had to come home, you know, for those\nreasons. But we drove -- they drove into New York, so we drove back and we\nstopped on the way in Scranton, Pennsylvania to visit another cousin of my\nparents, lovely, lovely people. And then we came home, or we came to Detroit.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, they still do.",
        "A: Oh yes, they all had families.",
        "A: Where did what?",
        "A: They were also Hungarians.",
        "A: It\u2019s not so much that I had poor English, because I -- I did take English lessons\nand I wrote -- as far as writing, I wrote very nice letters. My family in Detroit\ncouldn\u2019t wait for me to get here. But also, I am a rather -- well, what\u2019s the word\nthat I want to use? Bashful? And I don\u2019t like to be laughed at. And so I tried when I\ngot here, but then a few of -- little teasing and I clammed up. And I spoke no\nEnglish until I met my husband-to-be.",
        "A: But then you can\u2019t learn it well unless you start talking.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I was 20.",
        "A: Well, six weeks after I was here I went to work, they found me a job.",
        "A: Ata tailor shop. Men\u2019s -- it was a men\u2019s shop, actually.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, close to my age.",
        "A: [indecipherable] not exactly my age, but you know [indecipherable] here and\nthere, and most of them were younger.",
        "A: They were actually very nice people and there was a very nice lady, a nice\nPolish lady who worked there also. And she was as sweet as can be. I guess I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m really lucky because I fel -- I -- I met very few nasty people on the road.\nEventually I -- I did find some of the younger American girls, the so-called -- well,\nI don\u2019t want to say the American princess, but you know, that -- those type of girls.\nThey had no patience for me. I couldn\u2019t speak their language, so that was -- you\nknow, but that was fine, I really didn\u2019t need them because there were a lot of\npeople like myself in Detroit at the time and we had a nice group of people we\nwere friends with.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: Mm, not right away. Well, maybe one couple.",
        "A: Well, over there in those days -- well, through the families. See, most of the\nHungarian families, you know, they all had somebody who survived and coming\nover. So that\u2019s how we met. And then there was the Jewish center in Detroit, that\nwas the center point of going to school over there and meeting people. They just\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: Well not -- I went -- at the beginning I went to the Jewish Center to take some\nEnglish classes and then I met my husband, then that was -- you know, life became\na whole different thing.",
        "A: Well, I came in March and I met him, I think, a few months later at the Jewish\nCenter. He came in to say hello to the teacher and then he looked around the class\nand he -- when the class was over he was outside of the door.",
        "A: And that\u2019s it.",
        "A: And was -- you know, we -- he walked me home after that and he -- we started\nto see each other and that was that.",
        "A: Well, we met in -- let\u2019s see, maybe in April, May, and we got married in\nFebruary next year, following year.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: He had one aunt.",
        "A: That\u2019s the only relative that he has.",
        "A: Some. Probably not enough.",
        "A: Well, what I mean is, we were mostly trying to look ahead, not back, if 1t makes\nany sense.",
        "A: That ch -- maybe, but I don\u2019t think at that time he could have taken any more of\nit. There had to be a time to [indecipherable]. We needed time to sort of settle\ndown and live. Look at life instead of that. Eventually it came true and now we\u2019re\nat the point where we almost talk about nothing else but.",
        "A: It\u2019s not so much that it wasn\u2019t ca -- well, first of all -- let me just go back a little\nbit. I know when I came out here I had the grandiose notion, you know, that\neverybody wants to hear my story so Ill be going around and talking about it.\nNobody want to hear the story, come on. We were kidding ourselves. Even my\nown family, who lost so many members, close family, you try to talk to them, they\nwould change the subject. They couldn\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t bear listening to it.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: So then you just gave up. I mean, there was no sense of talking because nobody\n-- first of all, nobody could really understand what we went through. We could tell\nthem from morning til night and from night til morning and still talk and nobody\ncan understand it. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- those things that happened to us, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s like a\nhorror story, it\u2019s -- in your wildest imagination you couldn\u2019t conceive it and picture\nit, no less understand it.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What could it be like? You just listen. Most of the people I met in Detroit, they\nall came from Auschwitz. So you know, all I could say is my God, how lucky I\nwas.",
        "A: No, not really. I don\u2019t think I had or have any reason to feel guilty.",
        "A: I just -- what they say, the luck of the draw.",
        "A: No, I heard that mentioned many times before [indecipherable] but no, I -- I\nmean, it never even came to my mind that I need to feel guilty.",
        "A: Yeah, well, the first ones I heard from, what happened 1n [indecipherable] my\ncousins who came back, you know, we met them after we got back home to\nDebrecen and they came to see us. So by that time, you know, by the time I came\nhere I -- I knew about it.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t all together, you know, new to me.",
        "A: That was such a long time ago that really -- I really can\u2019t --",
        "A: -- I really can\u2019t remember what I felt. I\u2019m sure that it must have been awful, but",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: I couldn't believe -- well, first of all he\u2019s got something against the Hungarians\nto begin with, but you have to know him, too. See, he was in Auschwitz for two\nand a half years by the time the Hungarian Jews arrived, and he couldn\u2019t\nunderstand how come that we didn\u2019t know anything about it, what was going on.\nAnd they didn\u2019t run the other way, instead they ended up in Auschwitz. So that --\nand I think in some ways -- in some ways I think he held it against me that I was\nfree that much longer, while he was already in camp.",
        "A: Oh yeah, exactly.",
        "A: No, not really.",
        "A: No [indecipherable] I mean, eventually he understand that it was not my fault,\nand I had nothing to do with it. No.\n- whether you could imagine being married to someone who hadn\u2019t had this\nexperience?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I probably could have. I don\u2019t think -- can imagine why I\ncouldn\u2019t.",
        "A: And that was that.",
        "A: And that -- and that -- that was it. Well, I don\u2019t know. I wonder sometime,\nactually, what would have been like to live with somebody who didn\u2019t experience\nwhat he did.",
        "A: Well, at times it hasn\u2019t been all that easy, but we managed, we got through it.",
        "A: Well, because of his, I guess because of his personality and because -- oops --\nwhat all those years, you know, did to him and the way he [indecipherable] may\nhave changed his personality and what he could have been like.",
        "A: 11 months after we got married.",
        "A: No, not really, that was just the way it\u2019s supposed to be.",

        "A: Four.",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see. 1949 through 1961.",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s four, almost five years between the first two, and then the third\none came 16 months later and the fourth one came seven years after that.",
        "A: Their names?",
        "A: Howard, Caryn with a C, C-a-r-y-n and in the time I picked th-that name my\nfriend really thought I was crazy.",
        "A: Because that was a different spelling of -- of Caryn. And today it\u2019s all over, but\nfor years I haven\u2019t seen it. But anyway, and the next one 1s Linda, and the younger\n-- the youngest is Elaine.",
        "A: 6l.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t too long after, as soon as my son was old enough to notice\nthings, really. You know, my husband has a number on his arm, which you can see\nin the dark, big enough. So, you know, children ask questions.",
        "A: Well, luckily my husband has a very good sense of humor, and so he\u2019s got a\nway of making a joke out of most things. So what do you tell a four or five year old\nchild? Right? You can\u2019t go and tell him, cause first of all they wouldn\u2019t understand\nand then, why.",
        "A: Well, I remember he told him he was 1n jail, and he was a prisoner and that was\nthat.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what my husband says, too. Not only it\u2019s his phone number, it\u2019s his\nhouse number.",
        "A: Well, we told them, and they knew. They knew that we were a different family\nfrom all the other friends they had, because you know, we were -- there was no\ngrandparents, there was no immediate aunts and uncles. No cousins anywhere. But\nyou know, we never made a big deal of it, so they got through it until they were old\nenough to understand and they began to learn in school and knew what it was all\nabout.",
        "A: I think we just sort of, as we went along, you know, as they grew older we told\nthem a little more. So it was a gradual process.",
        "A: Not really, no. I mean, like I said, we just, as they grew older and that, we just\nwent along with whatever they were coming up with.",
        "A: Well, because of my husband\u2019s job.",
        "A: At the time he was working for a clothing company, who had several stores,\nyou know, and so that\u2019s why we ended up traveling. And then he hooked up with a\nbig -- the discount outfit, one of the first discount stores in the country and we\ntraveled some more.",
        "A: From -- from [indecipherable] we were --",
        "A: -- and I went to Grand Rapids first -- Michigan, Grand Rapids, Michigan. From\nthere we went to Binghamton, New York. And then we went -- from there we went\nback to Detroit again. That was with the discount corporation, and that\u2019s how we\nended up in Indianapolis and he became a district manager and they moved us to\nIndiana [indecipherable]. That was three years ago.",
        "A: 30 years ago, almost.",
        "A: Actually, all four of them were born in Michigan.",
        "A: Well, we went back.",
        "A: [indecipherable] when the first three were born in Detroit now, the two of them\nin Highland Park and the third one was born in the city of Detroit. And then when\nthe last one came about, we went -- we were back in Michigan again.",
        "A: To Indian --",
        "A: -- Indiana? Indianapolis? Actually, we -- let me see, we came to Michigan City\nin 1964, and we were there five years, and then from there we came to\nIndianapolis. So we\u2019ve been in Indiana for over 30 years.",
        "A: Well, okay.",
        "A: Three minutes, four minutes.\nbefore the -- the tape -- the last tape ended about what -- what -- what has helped\nyou to -- to cope, to -- with the memories, with the -- the grief, with the -- has your\nfaith been helpful or -- or was that something that you struggled with when the war\nwas over?",
        "A: You mean religion?",
        "A: No, [had no problem with that. The strength -- oh well, once we had a family\nand we had children, there were no question, I mean you had to go forward, that\nwas that. The children were our strength.",
        "A: I -- Lam Jewish. I was born one and I always will be. I\u2019m not overly religious. I\nkeep a Jewish home, I raise my kids in the tradition, or I try to.",
        "A: Where is God?",
        "A: Sometime. Sometime, yes. And I think I -- I ask where\u2019s God after the war\nwhen my parents were so sick, when my mother suffered so much, I think that was\nthe time when I asked where is God, why did she deserve what she got? After what\nwe went through.",
        "A: No. There 1s really no conclusion. You don\u2019t know why. Things just happen.\nWhen we started out our life together, I kept kosher. I had Friday nights traditional.\nEven my own family in Detroit didn\u2019t believe it, after what I came from, that I\nwould do something like that. Howe -- my husband couldn\u2019t care less. My son was\nBar Mitzvah because I dragged him to his classes, literally by his ear. And my\nhusband kept telling me, don\u2019t bother, he doesn\u2019t have to do it. I said yes, he have\nto do it, because that\u2019s what he is and he have to do it. And so he did. And after we\nleft Detroit, I don\u2019t know, I -- there were places we lived where it wasn\u2019t easy to\nkeep kosher. There were no kosher butcher. So I bought the meat in the\nsupermarket and I koshered it. Took it to a man who koshered. And gradually I did\naway with that, too. Not to the point that I ever -- to this day I don\u2019t eat pork, and I\ndon\u2019t bring it in the house. I don\u2019t even eat it out. Now today I have the four kids.\nMy son has nothing to do with religion. My daughter lives here in town, he marry -\n- she married a Catholic guy who turned Jewish and today he is more religious than\nthe rabbi, to the point where they don\u2019t even answer the telephone from Friday\nnight until Sunday evening when the Shabbas 1s over. So there.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: That\u2019s the first one, my oldest.",
        "A: That is the oldest of the girls.",
        "A: Now, the one in New York is not married, and the youngest one is also married,\na Swiss guy who 1s not Jewish, so -- but they did go to a Seder in Switzerland and\nhe enjoyed it very much. And she does the traditional things for the holidays, you\nknow, she bakes the hamantashen and the -- whatever. It comes [indecipherable |",
        "A: Not too. She comes home for the holidays most of the time, depending how it\nfalls, you know.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s the right word.",
        "A: [indecipherable] he wanted to do nothing with religion.",
        "A: Oh, he went along with it because I wanted to do it, but you know.",
        "A: Mm, sort of. Now he\u2019s beginning to get into it.",
        "A: I\u2019m doing it again now. Th-The -- these kind of paintings pulled me through\nbetween having babies.",
        "A: Ah, no, it -- well, I guess you can call it both. Actually, this goes way back\nwhen I was a teenager back home. See, in those days in Europe, this was a\nbeautiful profession.",
        "A: This is what they call a porcelain painting. Porcelain art is what it is. And in\nthose days before the second World War, this was a beautiful profession. And my\nfamily had a very good friend who did that, and then when -- when I became a\nteenager, I took lessons, not from the family friend, but from another young\nwoman, who did some beautiful, beautiful work. And it was just in the early 40\u2019s,\nso we really didn\u2019t have much time, but we were hoping, before we knew what was\ngoing to happen to us, that someday we gonna come to the United States and bring\nour beautiful painted porcelain. Well, it didn\u2019t happen. Somebody else\n[indecipherable] otherwise. So then when I came to this country -- see, if I would\nhave ended up -- if my family would have lived in Syracuse, New York, you know,\nI could have been painting china for 50 years. But since they lived in Detroit, there\nwas no need for that.",
        "A: Because, I believe in Syracuse, New York, isn\u2019t that the home of the Syracuse\nChina Company, whatever? Anyway, so -- a-and then I find out, after I was\nmarried already, that they\u2019re giving -- they had a very good system in the schools\nin those days in Europe, as far as adult classes were going, and I found out there\nwas one of these, and I went. And I took some classes over there, and in between\nkids, you know, when I couldn\u2019t go out of the house all day long and he would\ncome home and watch the kids and I would go to class. And I did it. And then I\nworked at it when we lived in Flint and I did it when we lived in Michigan City.\nAnd then when we moved to Indianapolis I couldn\u2019t find anybody to work with\nand so I hadn\u2019t done anything for years until about three years ago, when I met\nsomebody by accident, and so I\u2019m at it again.",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s a lot of things I can do, you wouldn\u2019t really call it arts, but yeah, I\ntried stained window -- stained glass. But then the woman I was working with\nmoved away from town and so that was the end of that.",
        "A: I enjoy reading.",
        "A: Both. History. Think it\u2019s an interesting subject.",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I -- I worked for a ballet school for 22 years, I just retired --",
        "A: -- end of May. I was running the office.",
        "A: Well actually, I got into it because of my youngest daughter, believe it or not.",
        "A: She -- well, she was a very cute, dainty little girl when she was small and I took\nher to ballet classes. I started her actually in Michigan City and then -- for two\nreasons I| did that with her, because she was also a very shy child and I figured that\nwill be good and you know, bring her out a little. And the older kids took wer --\nwhen we were in Michigan City were in the children\u2019s theater group, and they did\ngreat over there. And -- but she was too young for that yet, the little one. And then\nwhen we moved to Indianapolis I -- one summer there was nothing to do for her.\nAnd so I called up and I took her to the Butler University ballet classes and she got\nhooked. She wanted to be a ballerina. And that\u2019s how I got in there and now she\nleft and I stayed.",
        "A: She did for awhile, but then she had problem with her back and then she\n[indecipherable] so she stopped.",
        "A: Not really. Just on the side.",
        "A: I\u2019m in -- actively involved in politics? No. Am I going out campaigning, and\nthat sort of things? No. Well, first of all, I didn\u2019t have time for it, it takes time and I\nhad four kids to take care of, so you know, there was nobody else but me for them,\nso that was out of the question.",
        "A: Five years to the day I arrived here, I think.",
        "A: That was wonderful. It was an -- an unspeakable feeling.",
        "A: Well, just imagine yourself being thrown out of one country and taken into\nanother and you become a citizen. On the other hand, there is always that little,\nsmall voice, you know, in the back of your head, what if 1t will happen here too?\nSo this is why I think when I -- I raise my kids, all I wanted them to do is whatever\nthey do, to be independent enough so wherever life will take them, they will be\nable to land on their two feet, because you never know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It still is and I take it seriously, not like some other people.",
        "A: Because we know what it is. We know what it\u2019s worth.",
        "A: Yeah, I was, because most of my friends were there. And there was, you know,\nwe needed a country.",
        "A: N-No. No, no, I never did.",
        "A: Not lessened. I was probably a little bit disappointed that a big, powerful\ncountry couldn\u2019t do more. But then, you know, as you live here, you learn about\nthe country, you learn about political procedure, so to speak and you can almost\nunderstand.",
        "A: Some still are, that\u2019s really -- you know, people are very interesting. See, I -- I\ndid a lot of phone work, I mean answering the phone at work over there. And it\u2019s\ninteresting how people react when they hear something different. So I sort of got\nused to it. You know, at first it was bothering me a little bit, but now I don\u2019t care.\nYou don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s your problem. You know when I would answer the phone\nand on the other end I hear, oh, did I detect an accent? I said, no, you hear one. Or I\nwould say, you know, no, I don\u2019t think so. And then they wanted to know if I was\nfrom Germany, or from France, or wherever, you know. And then some people I\nwould try to answer something, they said, I don\u2019t understand you. I don\u2019t know\nwhat you\u2019re talking about. Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: [indecipherable] but 1t was very nice. We made friends everywhere we went. It -\n- it -- it depends, it\u2019s so different, you know, the kind of people you meet, in\ngeneral. Some are nice, and curious and want to get to know you, some, don\u2019t\nbother me.",
        "A: No, not that kind, but I had through my children, where we lived in Cleveland\nfor a short time and my son went to school there. And th -- he had a fight with a\nkid behind him who called him -- I was going to say a dirty Jew, but no, it was\nsomething else, but there was a Jew in it. They got into a fight for something. That\nwas in Cleveland and then when we lived in Delaware, Newark, Delaware, we\nlived in a very nice, almost new subdivision over there and there was another\nfamily somewhere not too far from our house whose -- the father was an army\nofficer and they had two or three kids and one was as old as my son and they were\ngood friends. And there was a little boy who was my Caryn\u2019s age, the one who\nlives here in town now, and -- and she had an incident with the kid. She came\nhome one day and she says to me, Mommy, you know what -- I don\u2019t remember\nhis name any more -- what he told me on the way to school? I said, what did he\nsay? She said, he told me that it\u2019s too bad I wasn\u2019t in Germany during the war\nbecause then Hitler could have killed me too. And then another day when the --\nafter that, sometime after that, the afternoon when they come home from school,\nthree comes my daughter with a, you know, stack of books in her hand, with a\nsmile from ear to ear. I said, what happened? She said well -- and says, that boy\nwas bothering me again, was starting again being a Jew and this and that and\nwhatnot. And she says to me, I couldn\u2019t listen to it any more, so I picked up my\nbooks and I hit him on the head with it. I said, good for you. And that\u2019s from the\nsame family, two boys from the same family. So how do you -- how do you figure,\nhow do you account for that? And the older boy would come to my house and play\nwith my son, and then the other one was hassling my daughter.",
        "A: It\u2019s interesting, for the most -- most people w-wanted -- they couldn\u2019t hear\nenough about it.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Sometime I think more so than the Jewish people.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know why it is, but I noticed it, was -- I don\u2019t know why, but -- but the\nGentiles want to hear more about it than our own people, even today.",
        "A: Well, that depends who you talk to. You know, there was some people you\nwouldn\u2019t want to say anything. There were others who you feel that they genuinely\ninterested, so you don\u2019t mind talking about tt.",
        "A: W-We were, probably the first maybe 15 - 20 years of our marriage, we just --\njust didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "A: Yeah. We just didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "A: I think people began to read more and began to hear more. When the television\ncame about, there were more things that came out into the open, and people\nbecame interested. And then -- see, when my older kids went through high school,\nall through school, even here in Indianap -- in -- in Indianapolis from \u201969 on, never\na word was mentioned in school about it. Nothing. In the early 70\u2019s when they\nstarted to teach in the Sunday schools, and that\u2019s when they were start -- beginning\nto look for survivors to come and -- and speak. But up until then there was really\nnothing.",
        "A: I think the first time it was I was asked, it was here in Indianapolis already. I\nwas asked to go to IHC, the Indianapolis Hebrew Congregation where we belong,\nto talk to a Sunday school class, and before I got there, or before I was to speak,\nthey were showing the film then -- oh God, I can\u2019t remember the title of it. All I\nknow 1s the --",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah. Thank you. And it was the first time I really saw pictures of that kind.\nAnd I was so shaken by it, was the word I think, that I almost couldn\u2019t do my\nspeaking. And then the other one when I was a little bit more composed, when my\nyoungest daughter was in junior high and she was in an accelerated class and th-the\nwonderful social studies teacher, and they were reading the Anne Frank story and\nalso some other stuff related to the Holocaust. And in one of those classes, the\nteacher asked the class if anybody knows anyone who was in a camp. And our little\none put her hand up and said yeah, my parents were there. So the teacher wanted to\nknow, so do you think your mother would come in and talk to us? So she called me\nand I said yeah, I\u2019ll be glad to, sure. So we set up a time and I wrote up, you know,\nmy speech, and went [indecipherable] did my speaking. And I know my daughter\nwas very upset with me, cause she said, you sounded just like a teacher. But when\nthe bell came and the class was over, the kids wouldn\u2019t let me go. They had so\nmany questions, they wanted to hear more. And the same night the teacher called\nme again, would I come back and tell them some more. And that was when I told\nmy husband, I said look, I already told them what I know. Maybe you ought to\ncome and hear what the kids have to ask and you talk to them. And that\u2019s when,\nyou know, we really started to talk about it to other than us. And then, about the\nsame time there was a -- a book that came out, \u201cThe Hoax of the 20\" Century,\u201d and\nhe got -- my husband got very upset over that and he wrote a letter to the\nnewspaper and he wrote a letter to Northwestern University. Of course, Mr. Butz\nnever answered, but nevertheless he wrote a -- sent him a letter. And that\u2019s when\nhe started to come out.",
        "A: I think 1t was somewhere in the early 70\u2019s, I don\u2019t remember exactly what year,\n\u00b072 - \u00b073 -\u201974, somewhere in there, in the 70\u2019s.",
        "A: He is the one mostly who does the speaking, I\u2019m not very good at public\nspeaking. He is -- he is very good and he does quite a bit of it.",
        "A: Some social clubs, you know, not -- not too many places, really. I let him do the\ntalking.\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: It\u2019s like I said before, to make sure that they\u2019re -- become independent people.\nWe never -- tried not to teach them hate. We\u2019re both rather friendly people and we\nwelcomed anybody who came into the house, so you know, we won\u2019t hold grudges\nagainst people because that doesn\u2019t get you anywhere. And I hope my kids will\nhave enough common sense that they\u2019Il know what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong.",
        "A: [indecipherable] that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the thing, that you gotta keep your ears and eyes\nopen.",
        "A: To listen to what -- not just what people say, but what they do and what they\nreally mean when they say some -- say something, especially in -- people in\ngovernment. So I go out and I vote for the best people I think there 1s to put in to\nplaces in the government.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: As a matter of fact it\u2019s even more lou -- I think it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s maybe louder now\nthan it was before.",
        "A: Because of what\u2019s going on out there and what\u2019s happening in Washington and\nit\u2019s what happening -- what\u2019s happening in the country.",
        "A: The right wing swing of the country. All these fringe societies out there that\ncould easily, given time and a situation, God forbid, can easily become a bigger\nthreat.",
        "A: That was terrible. It was a horrible -- it -- 1t -- I mean, how can it happen in the\nUnited States? See, this is what I mean, people like that.",
        "A: Sounds yes, smells, no. But words sometimes.",
        "A: Maybe it\u2019s something, that I hear something and it doesn\u2019t take much, it just all\nof a sudden like a movie, everything comes back.",
        "A: N-Not any specific words, but you know, you read an article, you -- you hear\nsomething on television, and oh, that\u2019s it and off you go.",
        "A: Like a big bang, an explosion, a siren.",
        "A: Yeah, you could call it a flashback.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: No, not really. For the most part I feel pretty secure.",
        "A: I think it just -- like I said before, I think it just evolved. We been, thank God,\nvery lucky. We didn't have many unpleasant experiences, as far as that goes. So\nyou sort of become accustomed to being, you know, on an even -- what\u2019s the word\nI want to use?",
        "A: Sort of.",
        "A: Oh, I have crazy dreams all the time. But I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s related to where I\ncome from. Not necessarily.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No. I had some -- a nightmare not too long ago, I woke up screaming,\nsomebody was going to come and get me. But I don\u2019t think it had any relation to --\nnot consciously.",
        "A: Yeah, we went back, oh, it\u2019s about 10 years ago.",
        "A: It was [indecipherable]. It was like I was in a strange country, like I\u2019ve never\nbeen there before.",
        "A: Yes, yes, and it\u2019s strange, I mean, things that I remember that I grew up with is\nnot there any more. There was a big, beautiful street in the middle of the city, and\nwe walked through there and I looked and I s -- kept saying, it\u2019s -- doesn\u2019t look the\nsame as I remember. It used to have, when -- what I remember, it used to have two\nrows of huge, beautiful trees, and in the summertime it would -- you know, all the\nbranches and the green would come out and then all come together, it\u2019s like a --",
        "A: -- tunnel going through it. And I\u2019m looking and I said, it\u2019s not there. I kept\nasking, I said, what\u2019s missing from here? And my sister said to me, oh you\u2019re\nlooking for the trees that\u2019s no longer there, they cut it down. And went back to the\nstreet where we used to live, and I na -- had such an eerie feeling. So that was that.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah. The one in Israel\u2019? Yeah.",
        "A: That was emotional, very emotional. It was -- it was nice. At that time I was still\nlooking, trying to find out what happened. See, I have an aunt who we never really\nfound out what happened to her and her daughter. That\u2019s the sister of my mother I\nmentioned earlier whose -- the husband was taken away in 1941, I believe. They\ntook him to the Ukraine. \u00b042 and early \u00b043, the news came that he died. And my\naunt was left with a small child who was about four years old at the time and a\ndaughter who was a young teenager. And she decided to liquidate whatever she\nhad over there and then to come to live with us, because they were very close\n[indecipherable] my mother. And she wanted to be with us til the war was over.\nAnd my parents went in September between the high holidays, between Rosh\nHashanah and Yom Kippur to bring the child over to our home, so she should be\nfree to take care of her business and then would follow. Well, it took her longer\nthan she thought it would, and then around Christmas, December, they came over\nand -- Christmastime they came over and wanted to take the boy home and he\nwouldn\u2019t go, he wanted to stay with us. And then in the spring my parents wanted\nto send the child back to her, and my father almost found somebody who was\ngoing there with her -- with his daughter and at first they agreed that okay, they\u2019re\ngoing to take a chance and take the child back. In the last minute they said no,\nwe're afraid to take a child because if they find out you\u2019re taking a Jewish child,\nwe get in trouble too, so they didn\u2019t take him. And as it happened, he survived,\ntoday he is a doctor and he lives in Texas, and his mother and sister is gone and we\ndon\u2019t know how and -- but they died in Auschwitz, both of them. And they were\nyoung enough to be able to survive.",
        "A: I met a lot of people I knew, yes, and so did my husband. And I went to one of\nthe museums in Tel Aviv called the dias -- Diaspora Museum. And to my surprise I\nfound in one of the computers, my whole families\u2019 history written up. So that was\ninteresting. And I saw my aunts I had [indecipherable] I haven\u2019t seen since I was a\nsmall child.",
        "A: [have a girlfriend I went to school with, she lives in New York, and that\u2019s\nabout it. I really don\u2019t -- and the few here in town.",
        "A: Real survivors?",
        "A: Well, some of them already passed away. Not really a whole lot.",
        "A: There are a few who came over here as young children before -- just before the\nwar, came from Germany. But others [indecipherable] real -- real survivors are us\nand maybe three, four other people, that\u2019s about it.",
        "A: The only place that we met survivors were in Binghamton, New York, where I\nmet some people from my hometown, and Cleveland. Other than that, in Michigan\nCity there, we were, I think, the only survivors there was.",
        "A: Yes and no. In some ways I think it was a relief, because you know, when two\nsurvivors get together, the only thing they talk about, what they went through and\nwhat they survived. A-And I think in order to save your sanity, so to speak, you\nneed -- you need some time away from it.",
        "A: In some ways.",
        "A: That\u2019s my husband.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, how much more do you have to go?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: That was nerve-wracking, that was scary. The Cold War was scary because you\nnever really could trust the Russians, so the -- as far as the -- what, the atom bomb\nin Japan, it was a terrible thing to do, but it had to be done, otherwise we would\nstill be fighting.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t catch enough of them.",
        "A: Yes and no. See, the Nuremberg trials were what year?",
        "A: \u00b048?",
        "A: \u00b047 - 7\u00b048.",
        "A: Those were the years, I don\u2019t know, I was really trying to find myself, so to\nspeak.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: I was a little bit surprised and a little bit disappointed in the American\ngovernment for letting them in. There were way too many in here.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, they needed them, they had to -- those people they had to bring in because\nthey needed the knowledge. But even with that, where were our American\nscientists?",
        "A: For what happened in --",
        "A: -- you mean for the Holocaust?",
        "A: I think the whole world. There isn\u2019t one person you can pick because all the\ngovernments in the world knew what was going on and nobody did anything. It\u2019s\nhard to believe but none of those smart people in the government couldn\u2019t see\nthrough what Hitler was about and they went along with him, country after\ncountry?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t call it anger, I have no sense of being angry because that just\ndestroys you. I feel sorry for them.",
        "A: That they have to live with this, maybe to centuries to come.",
        "A: Yes. We were in Germany a few ye-years ago, my husband was testifying\nagainst some Nazi people from the camp. We met some lovely German people,\nthey didn\u2019t know what to do for us. As a matter of fact we became friends. And she\npractically saved my life while we were there because I became sick over there and\nshe had a friend who was a doctor and you know, she -- she took care of me. So --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t do a whole lot either, did they?",
        "A: Disappointed I suppose, but then I don\u2019t think it would have make any\ndifference, because even though this 1s a free country, it\u2019s still the government that\ndecides. It\u2019s Washington who makes the decisions. So regardless of what they did,\nif they would have done more than what they tried, if it would have been any help.",
        "A: Well, you see, that started the trouble in Germany. That\u2019s why it all started. So\nthis 1s what I mean when I said earlier they -- that\u2019s mostly -- see, the Jewish\npeople are not so eager to hear our stories, the real American Jews.",
        "A: Hm?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s what it 1s, what you just mentioned, that they were lobbying not to\nhave in the 1930\u2019s. So --",
        "A: They were [indecipherable] in every city, it -- that was the same everywhere the\nGermans went. But see, in -- in Hungary they didn\u2019t have much time any more.\nThat was -- everything was done in a hurry. Like I said, from March 19\", by the\nend of June there were no Jews left in Hungary, everybody was gone except the\none who lived in Budapest.",
        "A: There was no time for it, no. They were gone one, two, three. By that time they\nknew what they were doing and th-their machinery was oiled pretty good.",
        "A: Not personally, no.",
        "A: Well, it was unsettling to say the least, because if 1t goes one way it could go the\nother way, too. So there we go.",
        "A: Well, if one -- one day you persecute the communists, the next day you gonna\nfind somebody else to do the same for, right?",
        "A: I never seen any. One I\u2019ve seen as a child, Joe Louis was in our town.",
        "A: Oh, talking about segregation, listen, when I came to this country in 1947 in\nDetroit, one of the nicest neighborhoods, I remember standing with my aunt\nwaiting for a bus to go downtown, and I look across the street, a big, beautiful\napartment building, and there is a plaque on the door. It said no dogs -- I\u2019m trying\nto remember exactly how it was worded. No dogs, no Jews and no blacks allowed\nin the building. That was in 1947. And I turned to my aunt and I asked, how could\nyou stand for this? To me it was outrageous. But that took me awhile to -- like all\nof us who come to this country, you know, from somewhere else and this is a\nwhole different life, and to get to know it, where it came from and what it\u2019s all\nabout. No, it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not fair to treat anybody like that, regardless of color.",
        "A: Connection, no, not really, because it\u2019s two different things altogether. No, it\u2019s -\n- it\u2019s not the same thing, and you can\u2019t really bring it to the same level.",
        "A: No, not really, but it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not -- that\u2019s not the same thing.",
        "A: Because it\u2019s true they were treated badly, they were segregated, some of them\nwere lynched, but they weren't taken as a group to the gas chamber as the Jews\nwere. And that is the difference.",
        "A: Yes, it was disturbing because no -- no human being should be treated like that,\nthere\u2019s no reason for it.",
        "A: Involved? To some extent, but I wasn\u2019t involved in any of the marching as such,\nbut you know, I was for it.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Frighten me? No, but it was rather -- what\u2019s the word I want to use? This is\nAmerica. That\u2019s the United States. People can do anything they want to.",
        "A: In some ways it is, as long as they know what really matters.",
        "A: That just shows that you can\u2019t trust the politicians in Washington.",
        "A: Not really. That was a shock because it happened in the United States and I\nguess in -- we\u2019re supposed to be a little bit better than anybody else in the world,\nbut I guess we\u2019re not.",
        "A: [indecipherable] that just a -- that\u2019s another thing that nobody wanted to know. I\nwas there. Some people knew about it.",
        "A: Well, we heard stories.",
        "A: Well, of course it was shocking, when something like this comes into the open.",
        "A: And the starving of the kids in what was that country in Africa where all those\nkids were starving awhile back?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s been a few years.",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "A: No, Somalia is a latecomer, but --",
        "A: -- there was another --",
        "A: Maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m tal -- thinking [indecipherable] sure.",
        "A: Yeah, I think that\u2019s the one, when all those kids, children were starving and\nwhere was the world?",
        "A: I was just going to say -- mention Yugoslavia. Now that, when we saw the\npictures coming from there, we looked, I said, my God, it\u2019s like concentration\ncamp. There was no reason for that either.",
        "A: No, it makes you angry. It brings back all the memories, all that we went\nthrough and it makes you angry that the world didn\u2019t learn.",
        "A: Action as far as what?",
        "A: For who?\nbut the last thing that they wanted me to ask you about history. What about\nobserving Israel becoming its own country in 48 and then the trials and\ntribulations of the past almost 50 years?",
        "A: It\u2019s 50 years, you\u2019re right.",
        "A: It will be 50 years next year.",
        "A: Everything that happens there concerns me, of course. It\u2019s a beautiful country\nand it\u2019s long overdue. I mean, Jewish people need the country like that. And they\nwork very hard for it, those people over there.",
        "A: Some of the thing that happens over there, yes.",
        "A: Oh, all the problems and bombings they have, where innocent people, innocent\nchildren die for no reason. I mean, there is -- there is no -- there is no reason for it,\nfor that. That\u2019s -- it\u2019s a concern for, I think, the whole world.",
        "A: See, we just came back from Israel. And what we hear on the news over here\nand read in the paper, it\u2019s a whole different thing than what goes on over there. So\nwe really can\u2019t -- can\u2019t judge.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, let me think.",
        "A: Not so much understanding, but maybe more aware of what goes on in the\nworld, and maybe quicker to react on what happens on the other side or wherever it\nhappens.",
        "A: I mean, yeah, around the world. Because the world is getting smaller every day.",
        "A: Tolerance, and be aware, and teach your children not to follow blindly.",
        "A: Question it, and don\u2019t believe it til you see it. And let\u2019s hope that the younger\ngenerations will be smart enough to see through somebody like this.",
        "A: Yeah, except I can\u2019t think of the name of the person.",
        "A: But there was one not too long ago 1n the picture. Pat Robertson 1s one. Is it --\nhave I got the right name?",
        "A: Well, the both of them. One is the politician, the other [indecipherable] and the\nother one the -- the religious guy, and they\u2019re equally bad.",
        "A: [indecipherable] well, there are probably some others around that not too well\nknown at this point, but --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Did you read it?",
        "A: It is available in the library?",
        "A: Oh. I think Pll go get it.",
        "A: Mm-hm [indecipherable] that\u2019s all it needs.",
        "A: The only hope in this country is that -- who they gonna pick for the scapegoat?",
        "A: Well, they can pick the blacks, they can pick the Jews, they can pick the\nHispanics. Who they gonna pick?",
        "A: Well, I guess we\u2019re back to square one again, huh? There we go for the Jews,\nhuh?",
        "A: Just one more thing. I hope for the government of the United States, that will\nstay forever what it was written to be.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"
