        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on November 23rd,\n1998, in Woodmere, Long Island. This 1s a follow up interview to a United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum videotaped interview, conducted with Frima Laub on May\nseventh, 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges\nJeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape one, side A. This 1s a\nbrief ambiance in the home of Frima Laub. This 1s a few seconds of silence in Frima\nLaub\u2019s home. There 1s, in the background, all sorts of, I guess wind blowers. They are --\nIt\u2019s a beautiful fall day and neighbors are taking the opportunity to clean off the leaves.\nSo, we are starting, along with the lawn material, which we will forget about. I wanted to\nask you first, Frima, if you could give me your full name as a child and the name of each\nof your immediate family members and just a little bit about them. Maybe where you all\nwere at first.",
        "Answer: When you say at first, at first before World War Two, or during World War\nTwo? Okay, my name 1s Frima. Maiden name was Glaser. We used Glaser-Better, B-e-t-\nt-e-r. My mother\u2019s name is Eta, my father\u2019s name was Mayer, M-a-y-e-r. My brother\u2019s\nname is David, my sister\u2019s name is Jeannie. You said you wanted to know more about --",
        "Q: A little bit about where you lived before the war and what he did and --",
        "A: Okay. Mm-hm. Okay, before the war, we live in a very lovely city, by the name of\nVolachisk -- I\u2019m sorry, not Volachisk, Proscurov, which is near Volachisk and\nPotvolachisk, where the rest of my relatives were born. Some were born in Volachisk,\nsome were born in Potvolachisk. But, we moved when I was still a little girl. We moved\nto Proscurov, which is a larger city.",
        "Q: In the Ukraine?",
        "A: And it was in the Ukraine, right and that\u2019s not too far from Kiev. Okay? We had the\nhome there, of course. My mother was a housewife, my father was in the import and\nexport -- actually mostly export, meat export business. My brother was studying in Kiev,\nin the engineering school and my sister was going to school in Proscurov.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We did --",
        "Q: We-We\u2019ll -- We\u2019ll return later to your relationship with your -- your family members,\nbut first, I wanted to ask you some of the things, just to clear up from the 1990 interview\nthat was done at the Holocaust Museum. Did you have any idea of what year it was, or\nhow old you were when you first stayed alone with the Gentile woman?",
        "A: Yes, that was in 1942, after the second pogrom in Proscurov. This is where -- My\nmother felt that she had to leave the city, of course, with my sister -- at that time, we\ndidn\u2019t know where m -- our father was. And my brother, of course, we didn\u2019t know\nwhere he was, since he was in Kiev, since before the war -- the war started. So, that was\nafter the second pogrom, when my mother felt everybody was killed in the city and she\nhad to run away because they were searching for remaining Jews. So, that\u2019s when she left\nme with that Gentile lady. So, I was six years old, little bit over six, yeah.",
        "Q: And I had a question -- two questions, actually, the first one being, do you know -- do\nyou understand now and did you understand then, why your mother left you alone?",
        "A: It\u2019s such a interesting question. Did I understand? I -- Obviously, I must have\nunderstood something when she said, \u201cYou have to stay here. I must leave with your\nsister. But,\u201d she said, \u201cin the spring, someone will come to get you and bring you to me,\nwherever I\u2019m going to be.\u201d A-And as much as I didn\u2019t like the thought that my mother\nwas leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was crying and my excuse was, \u201cMama,\u201d I says,\n\u201cbut I have a headache.\u201d Cause I felt, maybe if I tell her I have a headache, she will stay.\nAnd she said to me, she said, \u201cThe lady will give you an aspirin, and you'll feel better.\nAnd here.\u201d She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, \u201cIn case you want to buy yourself\nsomething and you need money.\u201d So she gave me the hundred rubles and she kissed me\ngoodbye, she walked out. Now -- She walked out, I -- I guess there was something that I\nmust have understood when she said, \u201cI must go, and I can\u2019t take you along,\u201d she says,\n\u201cbecause it is too cold outside.\u201d\u2019 And -- And 1-in Europe, the winters are extremely cold.\nYou can really freeze. And -- And I had very little clothing, because that clothing wasn\u2019t\neven mine, it was the clothing that belonged to somebody else from the first pogrom yet.\nSo, I guess, in the way, I understood that it\u2019s cold outside and I might get sick or freeze\nand my mother said she must leave and I knew one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to\nescape. So, that was my understanding, and I didn\u2019t make a scene. I just said, \u201cMy head\nhurts.\u201d That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Now, the part two of the question that I wanted to ask that I would -- while I was\nwatching the video, that I wondered -- now, to step way back into the -- well, way up into\nthe future from that moment, did you ever discuss this with your mother, about leaving?",
        "A: Interesting. No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Never discussed it and I never, ever felt any resentment. As the years went by, I guess\nsomebody would say, \u201cOh, Ma, you left me.\u201d or \u201cYou abandoned me.\u201d I never felt that\nway. And I just never discussed it with her and I -- but I did asked her, when we were\nreunited and she held me on her lap -- see, now I remem -- I remember, and my first\nquestion was, \u201cMama, why did you leave me?\u201d That I did, yeah. And she just explained\nto me again what she said, \u201cI had to leave, 1t was too cold and I was afraid if I take you,\nyou might freeze to death.\u201d\u2019 Cause even the clothe -- my clothing consisted of knee-highs\nand a pair of short boots. A little skirt, a sweater and a little jacket with a scarf, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: And your sister was much older than you?",
        "A: 10 years older. Right, she was already a big girl, so that was different.",
        "Q: And speaking of the reunion with your mother and your sister. Where -- In the\ninterview -- we are not quite clear from the video interview, what were the conditions,\nwhere did you live, did you work?",
        "A: W-We lived in this very, very small town, it was occupied Romania and I understand\nthis was still part of the Ukraine, but it was next to Romania and they call it occupied\nRomania. Mostly, there was a handful of Gentile people with a few homes, and -- a-and\nfarms -- fields, they had a lot of fields. And this handful of Jewish people lived with the\nGentile families, like we did. We lived with this Gentile gentleman. We were two\nfamilies in one of his rooms, because that\u2019s all he had 1s one room. And -- And he slept\non top of the brick oven and we had -- yeah, our life wasn\u2019t that simple. There was no\nbathrooms, either. If you had to go to the bathroom, you had to go out in the fields. Those\ndays, things were not the way they are today. And so there was one bed, on -- on that bed\nthere was a mother and a daughter whose fingers were a bit froze -- yeah, frozen from --\nfrom the cold -- yeah, from the cold weather. They were trying to hide and wherever they\nhid, they obviously were not dressed properly.",
        "Q: A Jewish mother and --",
        "A: Yeah, a Jewish mother and a Jew -- and her daughter. So, they slept on one -- it wasn\u2019t\nreally a bed, it was one of those four legs and -- a-a-and -- and some hay on it, I mean,\nthat was the bed. And we had another bed, which was a little bit bigger, because my\nmother, myself, my sister and then later on, a cousin of ours joined us, too. So we all\nslept on the same bed and instead of sleeping horizontally, we slept diagonally. And if\nthere wasn\u2019t enough room, so one of us will sleep on the floor. A-And that was o-our\nquarters. Now, what we did is -- is -- we had no money to pay for our -- our rent. So, we\nworked for this gentleman. Of course, we were very grateful, the fact that he even gave\nus a place where to sleep -- where to sleep. So, we worked on his -- on his fields and I\nwas one of his workers, and my job was to -- with my fingers, I would have to dig out the\npotatoes from -- you know, from under the earth. And I cleaned them up, put them in a\nsack and tied the sack and then, you know, just so -- drag it to his warehouse, which I\ndon\u2019t know how many blocks it was exactly, I never counted it. To me, it was just part of\nmy life. And for that, he would give me a loaf of black bread. So, we didn\u2019t have to pay\nfor the rent and he gave me a loaf of bread and that was a tremendous salary.",
        "Q: How often did you get bread?",
        "A: Well, every day. I wor -- I worked every day. And so did, of course, my sister and my\nmother and my cousin. We all worked for him. Well, they -- they worked in different\nparts of the field and I worked, you know, digging up the potatoes with my hands, my\nbare hands, yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember what -- what -- what they did?",
        "A: What -- I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: What your mother and sister did?",
        "A: Oh, they were also working on the fields. Well, they must have -- they -- may -- may -\n- maybe they did different, you know, diggings, different, whatchamacallit, vegetables,\nyou know, also it was -- everything was digging up, you know, because like he did the\nseeding and then, you know, y -- and you would have to -- in the springtime, that\u2019s what\nyou did. In springtime, everything was growing and you had to rip it off of, or rip it out\nof the ground and bring it into his warehouse. So we were all just working on the fields.",
        "Q: But you were not in hiding at this time?",
        "A: No. At that time, 1t was not a question of hiding, because there was no ghetto, this was\nnot a ghetto. You wo -- just would have to be very careful 1f sometimes a German would\npass by 1n the street, you understand? Or -- Or someone, some other Gentile would know\nthat you were Jewish, he might just go to the German and tell them, you know, in this\nhouse, they have Jews. So, actually, we were hiding out and nobody was supposed to\nknow that we are Jews, except for the person with whom we lived, he knew that we were\nJewish. So, that\u2019s how it worked.",
        "Q: Was he -- What would have been his motivation, was -- was it political, was it -- was\nit a spiritual motivation? Was it circumstantial?",
        "A: To say -- Do you mean to hol -- to hide out Jews? Well, there were some good people\nand he must have been one of those people wh-wh -- who felt sorry for a mother and her\nchildren and he also felt, you know, that we\u2019ll be devoted and loyal. We\u2019ll -- We\u2019ll work\nfor him, we\u2019ll help him out, because after all, he was all alone. And at the same time, he\nwas, you know, saving lives. And that\u2019s -- That was really something very, very amazing\nand very important to us.",
        "Q: That sort of reminds me a -- a little bit of what I\u2019m reading about the -- the slaves in\nAmerica and how there were certain homes, when they were on their way from the south\nto the north --",
        "A: Took them in.",
        "Q: -- where they stayed, I wondered, just jumping way into the future, did you have a --\nmake a connection with the Civil Rights movement at all, or the story of slavery in\nAmerica?",
        "A: You mean, at the present time, connecting their past and my past? Well, you know, in\nthose years, 1n my -- my times -- you\u2019re talking 55 years ago, there was no such thing as\nCivil Rights, there wa-was only such a thing as good people versing not such good\npeople. And he was one of those top people, who -- all he knew was perhaps for --\nbecause of his belief, that God said, you know, you should help others and that\u2019s what he\nwas doing. And the mere fact that he took us in, he must have been very special and --\nand -- and obviously a believer too, in saving lives. So, you know, things were different\nthen, as they are today, or --",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how your mother found him?",
        "A: No, but Iam sure my mother was something very special. She was someone who was\nalways ahead of everyone. And I imagine she just found out abis -- about this gentleman\nthat, you know, lived alone and she must have approached him and -- and offered, you\nknow, our services and he accepted them. So we are very lucky.",
        "Q: Now, from there I would love to -- whoa.",
        "A: That\u2019s the airport. We\u2019re not that far from the airport.",
        "Q: Oh. From LaGuardia?",
        "A: You see -- no, JFK. You hear that noise?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Every time -- This is not too bad, but every time, could be in the morning, could be\nduring the day, could be in the evening, suddenly there will be a tr-tremendous noise\ncoming from the airport and I think it\u2019s from the airport, from that direction, and that will\nbring horrible memories to me and I sometimes just shake and I can\u2019t do anything until\nthis noise stops. That reminds me, after the liberation, when we came back to Proscurov,\nto our home, every night for a whole year, until \u201845, the German planes, 30 or 40 of them\nwould come over every night and bombard the city. And so, we would hear that noise, f-\nfrom those planes approaching us and then, of course, either we -- if we had enough time,\nwe would run to shelters and if we didn\u2019t, we would just lie on the floors and -- and our\nho -- our glass, you know the windows would be open and we would have tapes on them,\nthat th-the -- the glass should not shatter and we would lie under our beds until they\nfinished bombarding and they left. This is how I lived.",
        "Q: Wa -- That\u2019s interesting that that plane would give us a cue, cause what -- one thing I -\n- | know we want to know about, 1s at the exact time of liberation, because you briefly\nmentioned it in the video interview and later you say that you never really felt liberated.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And I wondered, for a moment, if we might focus on your experience of the -- the\nexact moment of liberation are -- are -- and then the few days after that, from a child\u2019s --\nhow old were you?",
        "A: I was, at that time, eight. Eight years old, that was in 1944. And, actually the Russians\nliberated us, okay, the Russian army. And there was -- it was really horrible, because for\na day and night, there was door to door fighting between the Russian soldiers and -- and\nthe Germans. And, course the following day, when -- when we realized that we were free,\nthat -- I ran into the house -- to that -- to our room, where that lady with her daughter\nwere and these poor people, you know, their fingers were all frostbitten and well, while\nthey were there, I used to go in the fields and look for a special leaf. There was a special\nleaf which, when you would put to the infected area, that at least alleviated their pain.\nCause, you see, we could not get to a doctor and we were not allowed to go to a hospital\nand nobody was supposed to know that we were Jews. So, we couldn\u2019t call for help to\nhelp that mother and daughter who were constantly in excruciating pain because those --\nthat area where the fingers fell off, was just closing and half -- it wasn\u2019t completely\nclosed. So -- So I was told that if I can find those type of leaves in the fields, then they\nwould put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would\nalleviate their pain. So, I used to do that. But then, when we were told that we are\nliberated, we are free, we don\u2019t have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the\nstreet and I ran in to give them the good news. And I was so happy, I was jumping and\nthis poor lady, now I understand, you know, how she felt. Then, I couldn\u2019t understand.\nShe took a broom and she started hitting me. And she said to me, \u201cWhat is there to\nrejoice?\u201d Because she and her daughter, they were really cripples. And -- And I was\njumping for joy, so she beat me up with a broom. And she said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing to\nrejoice about.\u201d I says, \u201cBut we don\u2019t have -- the Germans are gone, the Germans are\ngone.\u201d She said, \u201cOh. So?\u201d And that was that, you know, and I just walked out of the\nhouse, because I was afraid she will beat me up some more, so that was that. Then, we\nalso ran to see the first Russian airplane that landed in that -- 1n our little town. And it\nwas on the hill and it was very big and I was so happy to see this big plane, because when\nI was little and I would go with my father for walks and I would see an airplane in the\nsky and I would say, \u201cPapa, how does this plane fly?\u201d And he would say, \u201cThere is a man\nin it.\u201d And I would say, \u201cBut it\u2019s so small, how can a person sit in it?\u201d And he would say\nto me, \u201cIt seems to you that it -- he\u2019s -- this plane is very small. That\u2019s because this plane\nis so far, far away. But it\u2019s really very, very big.\u201d Well, this was my opportunity to see\nthis big plane on the hill -- course with the -- with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh, ar\n-- that was a sunny day and oh, I was so happy. And then, we heard that this was the day\nthat the Germans were planning to kill that handful of Jews that were hiding out with the\nGentile people. They had already dug up a ditch for us. But the Russians came in and\nnever gave them a chance to kill us. So, 1-1-1t was a tremendous celebration. I remember\nwe were just dancing in the street and was just something so very special.",
        "Q: Did -- The first few days after being liberated, did your life change at all? Did you\ncontinue to be in the -- living in the same place?",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm. We lived, I -- I think for another couple of weeks in the same place,\nbecause A, we had no money to go anyplace, we had nothing. So, I -- I -- I just wou --\ndon\u2019t know exactly how my mother got the money. I think what my mother did is\nwhatever we had, like even the sheets she sold, like if you had them -- we had a sheet and\nmaybe a pillowcase and maybe a blanket. She must have sold it to the people there and\nthat\u2019s how she got money for us to take a train and go back home. And so, it\u2019s a few --\nwas a few weeks later that we went home to Proscurov. And that was in 1944, April of\n1944, spring.",
        "Q: Before we go too much further, there was one more question which I thought was\nvery interesting and that was, it -- it seemed to me when I -- when I listen to you now and\nwhen I heard your video, considering your age, that your recollection, your ability to\nrecall is very, very clear and good and I wondered if -- if your mother ever helped you\nreconstruct the events that happened during wartime, or have you always remembered\nclearly, what happened?",
        "A: Always remembered clearly. In fact, whenever I talk about my experience, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nright here. It\u2019s like \u2019'm watching a movie. Right in front of me, there\u2019s a screen and I'll\nsee it all over again. See, I can tell you how the sky was. When it was shining, when it\nwasn\u2019t. When it was raining. When we were walking -- the first pogrom when they lined\nus up and we were walking towards the outside of the city to the slaughterhouse. It was\ncloudy, it was drizzling, it was dreary, it was cold and yet, the liberation, it was sunny,\nthe sun was shining, the sky was blue. I can remember everything. There just isn\u2019t a thing\nthat I don\u2019t. And it\u2019s all just in front of me. Once I talk about it, it\u2019s in front of me. And\nnot only when I talk about it. It\u2019s -- My life is like a back -- backlash? Backflash -- back -",
        "Q: Flashback?",
        "A: Flashback. Like, Pll walk in the street and I'll see -- I'll -- Pll hear a German\nShepherd and that\u2019s -- right away, I got back to what has happened to me during those\nyears with the German Shepherds. When I pass a house that has a -- that looks like -- a\nlittle like a barn o-or has a barn in back o-of, that brings back memories again. So, every\nmovement in my life and everywhere I go, I see my past. I see a cat, brings back\nmemories. Even -- That\u2019s just unbelievable, but even, you know, the Germans, the SS,\ntheir hats. They had these caps with like a brim up front, but up front was very high and\nthen they had insignia, the insignia. Sometimes I\u20191l see someone with a hat similar to that\nand it like takes me aback. Right away, I'll look at that. And, like I told you, th-the plane,\nthat noise from the airport, right away I see the planes coming. God, there\u2019s just -- just\nabout everything brings memories. But, everything is very, very clear, from the minute\nthat -- when I was in my kindergarten and I was standing by the window, looking out to\nthe backyard and the first bomb fell. Like a little -- you know, away from our -- from my\nschool, but I was able to see the explosion of it and this 1s when the teachers realized that\nwe were in trouble and they all called, you know, th-the parents and the parents came\nrunning and they took the children home and -- and of course, and on the radio we heard\nthat -- that the Germans invaded us. So, from that moment on --",
        "Q: How old would you have been then?",
        "A: Oh, I was five years old.",
        "Q: Okay. I think I better go to side two, because I have a feeling we\u2019re going to have a\nlong story coming in liberation. So, we\u2019re now moving from tape one, side A, to side B.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: All right, this is tape one of the interview with Frima Laub, side B. And you were\nsaying?",
        "A: And I was saying that, because I was so young and this was such an impact on my life,\nthat although perhaps I could not understand exactly what a war is, but I knew that I must\nsurvive. This I knew. And I knew that the fact that I am a Jew, nobody\u2019s supposed to\nknow that. I have to be somebody else. And, for awhile, as you know, my name was not\nFrima, it was Lola.",
        "Q: No, I didn\u2019t --",
        "A: No, it was Olga. I forgot, it was Olga.",
        "Q: Your name was Olga?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. During the war, I was not Frima. I was -- We had to undertake a different\n-- different names in order for us to be somebody else. We were not supposed to be Jews.",
        "Q: What was your last name?",
        "A: Oh, now you are asking me for too much. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember what\nour last name was, but we did have, believe it or not, we did have false papers, because\nyou were not allowed to walk the street, they were -- we were all so -- the rosaca -- what\ndo we call that? Curfew? Curfew, yeah. A curfew, right, in the evening? And if anyone\nwas walking, then you had -- an-and ap -- you know, and a German would stop you,\nwhich they had the right to do it. If you show them the papers, then they would let you\ngo. If you didn\u2019t have papers, they would take you in for interrogations. So, we had -- we\nhad false papers. And this all -- My mother took care on all these things. In fact, we got\nthese papers from a church, from a pastor, because my mother realized, after the pogrom\nthat they are -- or they were looking for Jews and -- and we had no place to go and so that\nmeans we would be in the streets, trying to -- you know, like she was trying to -- to see\nwhom and how she would be able to get us where and how to leave the city. So, we went\ninto a church and my mother spoke with a pastor and he gave us false papers, yeah. You\nsee, I told you there were some good people in this world. If not for them, I wouldn\u2019t be\nhere talking to you.",
        "Q: I want to ask you about how you got -- if you can recollect, how you got from the\nknowledge of the liberation, then there was two weeks with the same farmer --",
        "A: Or three weeks --",
        "Q: -- and then -- or however --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and then, do you remember how you traveled and what -- how you felt when you\narrived in your next destination?",
        "A: Home -- hum. Well, let\u2019s see. Of course, those -- the next few weeks are -- Just by\nknowing that we don\u2019t have to worry about being killed and we don\u2019t have to hide out\nany longer and that we are going home, but we were not sure if our house will still be\nthere, you know, because of all the bombardments and all the destructions and especially\nif it\u2019s a Jewish home, of course it was destroyed quicker than any -- any -- anybody else\u2019s\nhome. But the excitement was there, the fact that perhaps my father will be there and\nperhaps my brother will be there. So, 1-1t was a mixture of excitement that we were free\nand we were going home and the worry of will we see our father again, and will we see\nour brother again, or you know, my mother\u2019s son. And -- And then, of course,\n[indecipherable] my mother always had ways of how to do things and she got that money\nand we got the tickets and we got on that train and we made it home and it was -- 1-it was\na long trip. It was -- oh, God, I know it was long. It was at least six, seven hours of, you\nknow, of traveling.",
        "Q: By train?",
        "A: By train, right, or maybe even more. I -- I don\u2019t remember exactly. Seems to me like it\nwas forever, anyway. And we made it home and sure enough, there was our house. It was\nstill there. Course, inside, everything was empty, you know. But -- And outside, it was\nonly partially destroyed. Also, obviously from the shootings and bombardments. So --\nBut -- But the fact that the house was there, was a wonderful feeling, and -- and -- and\nthen we began to -- to -- to hope that, you know, the family -- the rest of the family, my\nbrother, my father will come home and -- but no, it didn\u2019t work that way. My mother was\nwriting letters all over, you know, and the neighbors said that they did see my father with\ntwo Gestapos, walking in the street and that was the last time they saw him and nobody\nknew whatever, what happened to my father. So we -- After awhile -- After, you know ri\n-- writing to different places and not getting any response, we knew that we\u2019ll never see\nhim again. And my brother, well, he was writing to us also. See, after the war, he also\nbegan to write home, and we got his letters. And so this is how we, you know, started to\ncorresponding and then he came home.",
        "Q: Now tell me about how long was it and about his -- his coming home. You must really\nrecall that.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, first of all, wh-when we got his letter that he was alive, we were dancing.\nI mean, it was just wonderful. He is -- was the only brother, the oldest brother, the one\nand only. And we haven\u2019t seen him in -- in three -- more than three years, I mean, almost\nfour years. And so the fact that, you know, that he was alive and th -- he would be\ncoming home and so also, you know, my mother, my mother, my aunt, they write papers\nand you know, there was always a lot of paper -- a lot of paperwork, but it worked and he\ncame. He was terribly handsome, my brother, so good looking. Tall, blonde, very good\nand very intelligent and he was, ah, it was just so wonderful to see him and -- we thought,\nyou know, maybe he was in contact with our father, we just, you know, tried everything.\nBut no, it just didn\u2019t work out that way. And then, you know, and my sister, my brother,\nthey went out to work. My mother went out to work and in between she would fix up the\n-- the house outside, they made it look real nice. And we always had an open door for\nthose who needed a place to sleep over. Even we didn\u2019t have many beds, but there was\nalways the floor, so they could sleep on the floor. And whoever needed, you know, a\nmeal or something, well our meal consisted of potato soup and that -- potato soup,\nherring and some black bread and that was very good. We did very, very well. Little by\nlittle, you know, we had the bed and my mother couldn\u2019t even afford to buy shoes for me,\nso I would go to the bombed out homes -- houses and look for rope. And then, separate\nthe rope and my mother bought me a crochet needle and I would crochet slippers. And I\nwould take a cardboard, cut out the sole, put it inside and that was my shoes. And then\nlater on, of course, I -- my mother registered me to s -- in school and she had to buy me a\npair of shoes. So, she bought one pair of shoes and I had one uniform and I went to\nschool in the afternoon and in the morning my job was, course, to clean up the house and\nmake the beds, prepare lunch for my family, and they u-used to come home for lunch.\nAnd I washed my own uniform and I did my own pressing and every day you had to go\nto school with -- with a pressed up blouse, the blouse was always pressed. And my shoes\nthat my mother bought me and then when I ca -- came home, I would take off the shoes\nthat she bought me and put on my shoes, the ones that I crocheted. Hand crochet shoes.",
        "Q: Was this a school of Jewish and Gentile children?",
        "A: This was a public school. There were hardly any Jews. We were just about, I think, the\nonly family that survived.",
        "Q: Did you feel prejudice there?",
        "A: Well, prejudice was always there. Anti-Semitism always existed. Persecution always\nexisted, so I guess, from a very young age, I learned that strangers shouldn\u2019t know who\nyou are. And I did very well in school and myeah --",
        "Q: Okay, we -- we cannot change the neighbors activities, so we\u2019re going to move on.\nAnd I wanted to ask Frima, how long were you there, in your home, and what was it that\nmade you move on?",
        "A: Okay, we were home for about two years. But before that -- before the two years of\nthe -- again, I -- I went to school, I did very well, my mother was very proud of me. My\nmother received a letter from the government, the city government, that our house is too\nbi-big just for one family, so they were planning on having two other families moving 1n,\nto live with us. With that, my mother decided that it\u2019s time to go. And although it was\nextremely difficult to le-leave the country and the city and the home and -- and whatever\nshe worked for, she felt that this was the time to leave. And so she again, as smart as my\nmother was, she again made all kinds of arrangements, got in contact with certain people\nwho helped us get the right papers in order to leave the country. And that\u2019s what we did\nand that\u2019s where we started our journey from the Ukraine to Poland, from Poland to\nGermany, from Germany to France, from France to Cuba, from Cuba to the United States\nof America and God bless America.",
        "Q: So, how long did that take?",
        "A: To me it took forever. Is so much the trip. But --",
        "Q: And you were how old when you were --",
        "A: Well, when I arrived in -- in -- [indecipherable] in Cuba, because I lived in Cuba nine\nyears. So, the age when I arrived in Cuba, I was 13. In fact, I can show you some -- some\nleaflets that -- I used to entertain. I -- I had a very good voice and my aunt was very much\ninvolved -- my aunt, who brought us to Cuba, she was very much involved and -- you\nknow, in the Jewish organizations. And th-that was for her a chance to raise money for\nher organization, by running a dinner dance, having her niece who just came from the --\nfrom Europe singing all kinds, of course, Holocaust songs.",
        "Q: Now, I want you to hold this -- this thought, is if we\u2019re trying to see where you were\nbefore. Those places where you were, you mentioned, but I\u2019d like to go into a little more\ndetail --",
        "A: More details?",
        "Q: -- about anything you recall, especially in Paris, and --",
        "A: Okay, well, Paris was my last stop, so you want to --",
        "Q: So let\u2019s --",
        "A: Let\u2019s start from Poland --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- to Germany.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: Your -- Your time in Germany, did you move from place to place? Did you settle for\nlong? How did you travel?",
        "A: Okay, we are now right, okay. Okay, our first stop was Poland, where we -- we were\nthere only for about a day, or maybe a day and a half and then by train we went to\nGermany. No, excuse me -- yes, but before that, we had to cross borders, okay? We --\nYes, we did take a train from the Ukraine to Poland, that is correct. Then in Poland we\nstayed maybe a day or a day and a half, right. And then from -- from Poland, we had to\ncross a border to Germany. Now, it is illegal, in those days, it was illegal to cross the\nborders, unless you had, of course, all the right papers, or whatever. Well -- And, of\ncourse, you cannot be Jewish, either. And that\u2019s already, even after the war. But, what my\nmother did is -- there were always people who for money would smuggle you, okay? And\nwe were not the only ones, there were many Jewish people that wanted to get out of\nPoland and wanted to, you know, sort of run towards Germany or even Italy, wherever\nthey were able to go and with the hope that from there, they will come to the United\nStates or go to Palestine or go to, you know, different countries. So, this was -- the\narrangement was a --a military truck, who was not -- who was -- did not belong to the\nmilitary any longer, it belonged to those group of men, two or three of them, who would\nsmuggle people for X amount of money. And so, you know, you had to pay for each\nhead, whatever it was and I remember so distinctly, this was this -- you know, th-those\nmilitary trucks that have canvas on top? You know, those canvas trucks, right? And we\nmust have been maybe 25 - 30 people, with little children, okay? Some were sitting on\nthe side, you know, the benches on the side. Most of us were lying on the floor and -- and\n-- and people were sitting on top of those who were sitting -- who were lying on the floor.\nAnd when we got to the border, it was -- the guards stopped us and I -- we don\u2019t know\nwhat our driver told him, but th-the guards decided to check what -- what they were\ncarrying in that -- in -- in that truck, right? So, as they started walking to the back, to\nopen up the canvas and see what material they were carrying, our driver took off. And\nthey started shooting at us. And he was zigzagging and we were not hit. Were we lucky?\nI\u2019m lucky all the time. And we made it to Germany, okay? Now, we arrived in Germany,\nit was dark. And there was a -- see, once you\u2019re in Germany, they knew that these Jews\nwere displaced persons. So they -- no problem, they would just -- you know, ha -- we had\nto fill out papers, they would register us, who we are, blah, blah, blah and they would --\nand -- an-and they was send us to Berlin. Berlin was like the headquarters for all the Jews\nthat were coming from all over the world and from -- from Berlin, they would send us to\ndifferent displaced person camps -- DP camps they were called. So, all over Germany,\nthey had these DP camps, okay? Our camp was in Bavaria, part of Bavaria. And -- And\nthe city -- the name of the city was Poking, but our camp was outside of Poking, our DP\ncamp, which wa -- there were like -- there were wooden barracks and I don\u2019t know if\nthese barracks were built after the war or they were there before the war, I really don\u2019t\nknow. And -- But after the war, I found out that actually these barracks were built on top\nof a Jewish children cemetery. Jewish children were buried there. They were killed\nduring the war, they were buried there and then these barracks were built, you know,\nbefore we arrived.",
        "Q: How did you find that out?",
        "A: Well, somebody that -- that was in that area told me, a-a-and I was -- I was shocked,\nbecause I -- I didn\u2019t know -- none of us really knew. So, what happened, so we lived in\nthat area and in that DP camp, I don\u2019t know how many of us were -- but I do know that\nthe museum has a picture of one of the barracks behind me and my sister. That was my\nschool and that was also our entertainment building. We used -- I used to entertain, I used\nto sing. And there were children who danced and this was our school and this was our\nsocial hall.",
        "Q: To entertain each other?",
        "A: To entertain, yes --",
        "Q: And -- And how did you start your interest in singing, was it here at the DP --",
        "A: At -- Wh -- Yeah, yeah, at the DP camp, right",
        "Q: Did you by any chance sing when you were young, by yourself, because you spent so\nmuch time alone.",
        "A: Well no, I -- those were not the times for me to sing, when I knew that I\u2019m all alone.",
        "Q: And when did you start singing?",
        "A: After the war, when I came home.",
        "Q: So, part of your liberation is, in a way was --",
        "A: Yeah, probably you are right, yes, probably that was the reason. Yeah, come to think\nabout it.",
        "Q: Not to mention your talent",
        "A: Well, I had -- No, I had a good reason to sing then, you know?",
        "Q: And your sleeping arrangement in the barracks, were you separated the women and\nthe men, and --",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We had one room and we as a family, a whole family, you\nknow the four of us, yeah, all four of us, yeah, my -- well, m-my father wasn\u2019t with us\nany longer. That\u2019s my brother, my sister, myself and my mother, right. We had one room\nand you know, every family had a room. It was very -- That was very good. This is where\nthe HIAS and Joint came in and they helped us. HIAS? It\u2019s the Hebrew -- Hebrew, God,\nthe HIAS, how they -- they spell it? Well they, 1t\u2019s H-I-A-S. That\u2019s an organization that\nprovides people who are need of food and clothing, they provide them. And also the\nJoint. That\u2019s J-o-i-n-t, Joint. They also an -- are an organization that provide, you know,\nthe refugees and the Displaced Person with food and clothing, cause none of us had jobs\nand we had to eat. And so, whatever we got, it was no big deal, but it still was food, and -\n- and clothing. And --",
        "Q: Your family worked on --",
        "A: There was nothing to work, there are no jobs for us. We had no jobs.",
        "Q: No jobs for money, but I mean, what did you do during the day?",
        "A: Oh, oh well, you know, my mother would help out the sick people, somebody was\nsick. I went to school. Right away a school was set up. In every DP camp there was a\nschool and we went to school. We would -- We were taught Jewish, Hebrew and the\nlanguage of the country, yeah. And la -- as I said, and -- and the schoolchildren we used\nto entertain, like once a week, we would have -- you know, for the parents and the whole\nDP camp would come and we would entertain, singing and dancing and you name it and\nwe did all these things. We also, you know, we had all kinds of competitions, bicycle\nriding and running and jumping and you name it, I mean we -- they kept us really busy.\nYeah, it was --",
        "Q: Do you have pleasant memories of that time?",
        "A: They were pleasant because I didn\u2019t have to worry about pogroms and I was not\nsurrounded by barbed wires and I -- and I didn\u2019t have -- I didn\u2019t hear the German\nShepherds bark. So, that was like feeling I\u2019m safe.",
        "Q: Who were the leaders? Do you remember the leaders of the DP camps?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: So, is there any other thought or experience you had there, before -- in Bavaria, before\nwe move on to the next place?",
        "A: Yeah, well, a-a-after this -- a-after Shlupfing and that\u2019s the DP, my first DP camp\nwhere we stayed, they suddenly decided to close this DP camp and they moved us to\nanother DP camp, not too far, you know, a few kilometers from this one, which was a\nmuch larger one and the name of that camp was Volshtadt. It was also in Bavaria. So, we\nstayed in the first camp like, I think, a year or so and -- and the same amount of time in\nthe other camp, until -- well, time came when they said, ofka -- of course, you have to\nmove on. Okay, so --",
        "Q: How did they decide that?",
        "A: Well, usually what everyone tried to do is get in touch with their f-families or relatives\nin whichever country they had relatives and the relatives would have the papers ready for\nthem. Like, we had papers to come into the United States, except, when we got from\nGermany to France, from where we were supposed to come to the United States, we were\nsupposed to wait longer on that quota th-th-the am -- the American quota was very slow.\nI imagine they had maybe a lot of people. So we had to wait. And my mother --",
        "Q: Now how did -- You -- You\u2019ve gotten to the second DP camp?",
        "A: Right. And we lived there for about a year.",
        "Q: One year.",
        "A: Yeah. Continued going to school. I also, in between, would help out mothers with\nlittle children like I was a babysitter. I mean, free of charge, you know. And we had\nsynagogue who caught fire and you know, because these were old barracks, they were\ndried pieces of wood put together, huts really. I mean that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what it was. But we\nknew it was temporary and everything, you know, compared to what we had to go\nthrough during, you know, during the pogroms, this was fine. And so we were looking\nforward that, you know, tomorrow will be a better tomorrow. And sure enough, the\ntomorrow came where we had to take the train from Munich to Paris.",
        "Q: Now did you stay in Munich at all, or just passing through?",
        "A: No, we -- we just went to Munich to take the train to Paris and we did and we lived in\na rooming house. I don\u2019t think it was a hotel, I think it was a rooming house. We had one\nroom. We lived there for five months.",
        "Q: Did an organization pay for your --",
        "A: You see, I don\u2019t remember. I think 1t was a combination between the organization and\nmy family in the United States who send us, you know, send money and packages at that\ntime, you understand? They were also helping us out. So, I don\u2019t -- You know, I -- I -- I\ncan\u2019t say if they were going to say if the organization paid for our stay completely or it\nwas half and half. But, whichever way it was, they were always there if we needed help.\nThis -- This I do remember. Everyone said, you know, if we need -- you need help, you\ngo to the HIAS or you go to the Joint and they will help you, and -- and I imagine they\ndid.",
        "Q: What language were you speaking then?",
        "A: Well, when I wasn\u2019t in -- in Germany, of course I -- I spoke Russian and I spoke\nYiddish and I spoke Hebrew and I spoke a little German and I hated the language. Course\na lot of things also happened in Germany. I -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know how I got it, but one\nevening, the night of Yom Kippur, I was sitting outside the synagogue and I suddenly got\nthis terrible headache. I came home and I was running an -- a very, very high\ntemperature. And my mother called a doctor and he came and he examined me and he\nsaid that immediately they have to take me in by ambulance to outskirts of -- of Berlin,\nbecause I am very sick and I might have diphtheria and that\u2019s a contagious disease. So,\ncan you imagine? Here I am, I thought I was finished with Germany, but here I am sick\nand they taking me with a German ambulance to a hospital on the outskirts --",
        "Q: From?",
        "A: Berlin. Outskirts of Berlin --",
        "Q: Wh --",
        "A: From Berlin -- From the DP camp in Berlin. I mean, yes, you know --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go to the next tape. We\u2019re going to finish the story, but I need to change tapes.\nWe\u2019re going to Frima Laub, tape two, side A.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Frima Laub,\nconducted by Ginger Miles, on November 23rd, 1998. This is tape number two, side A.\nTell us where we are, because we started with this story --",
        "A: Right now, we are ou -- we are back in Berlin, in the DP camp. This 1s --",
        "Q: The third DP camp?",
        "A: No, the first DP camp. I\u2019m -- The reason I\u2019m going back 1s because I want to tell you\nthat I got sick, okay? Yeah, okay? How\u2019d it ever go back to us -- but anyway, this is just\na reminder as to what happened to me, while we were in -- 1n -- in Berlin -- in the\nDisplaced Person camp in Berlin, after we arrived from Poland, and after we cross the\nborder to Germany. We were there for a short while, but during that time, the night\nbefore Yom Kippur, I suddenly was -- was hit with a terrible headache, while sitting\noutside the synagogue and listening to the prayers. And my mother called the doctor and\nhe immediately ordered a -- an ambulance to take me to a German hospital outside of\nBerlin, because I was very sick, and what I had was diphtheria, which is a contagious\ndisease. And so, three weeks I was in that hospital, in isolation and I did not sleep and I\ndid not eat, because I was afraid they\u2019Il kill me again. And I -- I was not allowed to have\nvisitors, so my mother would come and stand by the window and just wave to me. And\nevery time they gave me an injection, I would say, \u201cThis is it. They killed me.\u201d And I\nwas afraid to eat, because in case there\u2019s poison in it. All because I knew I\u2019m a Jew. I\ndon\u2019t know if they knew I was Jewish, but obviously they did know that I\u2019m Jewish\nbecause they took me by ambulance from the DP camp. And the only people that went to\nthe DP camps, were the Jews. So, after that, we went to the next DP camp and then to the\nnext one, the third one, which was Volshtadt, and then from Volshtadt, we went to -- to\nMunich, to catch the train to Paris.",
        "Q: Okay, now before we --",
        "A: And here, we\u2019re on our way to Paris.",
        "Q: Before we get on our way to Paris, just because this 1s so fresh in your mind, has your\nfear of Germans or the German language carried on through to your life to this day?",
        "A: Absolutely. And --",
        "Q: Could you talk a little bit about that?",
        "A: Yes. Well, the language brings memories and many times I just -- I-I-I\u2019Il just -- Pl\nsort of cover my ears, not to hear the language, because it -- it brings memories in the --\nand I really get very upset. I -- I -- I -- I -- I never felt really, completely free, you know,\na-away. So, when I lived in Germany, there was still fear inside of me that, if they know\nthat Iam a Jew, something might happen to me, or they\u2019Il do something to me. And to\nthis day, it didn\u2019t change. And the German Shepherd, that dog, when I hear him bark, I\ndon\u2019t even have to see him. Terrible feeling. I -- I-I-It\u2019s very hard to end -- to -- to even\nexplain. It\u2019s like my -- my stomach jumps. My heart starts racing.",
        "Q: I never heard anyone speak about German Shepherds. How were they involved in\nyour history?",
        "A: In my life? Well, during the first pogrom, when we were rounded up, they came to the\nghetto, where th -- th -- the SS came with the German Shepherds and so, that is to make\nsure that we don\u2019t run or we don\u2019t do anything, right? I mean, we were helpless anyway,\nbecause it was very early in the morning. It was just beginning to light -- to get light and\nwe were sleeping and they started knocking on -- on the windows and on the doors. And\nof course, with that, as they were knocking, the German Shepherds were barking. And\nthen ho -- all -- a-after we were lined up to go, you know, to the slaughterhouse I call it,\nyou know, where they did the killings, on both sides of the roads, on the road that we\nwalked towards the slaughterhouse, they had the SS, with the German Shepherds,\nstanding there. And so, to me, as I was looking at them, was frightening. And during the\ntime that I was alone, and I was walking the streets, I used to hide between the trees at\nnight, when I would go back to the ladies house, to sleep under -- under her house, I\nwould go between the shadows of the trees, I should not be noticed by the German\nShepherd. Because, you know, they -- they -- if they see a shadow, they'll -- they\u2019Il run\nafter a shadow. I was ou -- I tried to be so careful. I-It was unbelievable. And their\nbarking just never left me. And the fear of what they can do to you, with their masters, I\nmean, 1-is something that did not change my feelings and th-this is unfortunate that -- the\nlanguage -- a-and I would just never go back. I keep saying, I would never go back to\nGermany, although sometimes I say I want to go back and see the place where I lived, the\nDP camps, but I\u2019m not sure if -- if it\u2019s -- you know, what\u2019s there. It\u2019s probably nothing,\nit\u2019s a cemetery now.",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve never gone back at all to your --",
        "A: No, I just --",
        "Q: And what about Paris, since we were about to arrive --",
        "A: Well, Paris, I would love to go back, I -- I told my husband I would like to show him -\n- | hope that that rooming house is still there, where we lived and I would like to show it\nto him.",
        "Q: And so, in Paris, you didn\u2019t need to know French?",
        "A: Oh yes, I learn quickly, a little bit of French. I -- Of course, I did not go to school,\nbecause this was in the middle of the semester, so nobody would take me, but I kept very\nbusy. I did learn, you know, I had to go shopping for my mother, I did learn important\nthings.",
        "Q: And the money, I --",
        "A: And how to travel.",
        "Q: And your money came from?",
        "A: My aunts. Remember I told you my aunts and then, you know, my mother, every so\noften, would sell something else that we had, and --",
        "Q: Your aunts in Cuba?",
        "A: I had an aunt in Cuba and twins in the United States, yeah, so they -- they really, all of\nthem helped us and th-that was very important, because none of us were able to work for\nfive months in -- in, you know, in Paris. But, we did do a lot of volunteer work. I, for\nexample, would babysit for -- for the young couples with children, all sort -- you know,\nimmigrants. They were in transit from Paris to somewheres, okay? And -- And if the\nmother wasn\u2019t feeling well, I would take care on the baby. You know, I was like a\nbabysitter or a mother\u2019s helper. Then, once a week, there was a -- a -- a group of\nMoroccan Jews that lived on a hill and I don\u2019t remember the name of the hill, also,\noutskirts of Paris. And I learned quickly, how to travel by Metro and I would go all over\nParis. I knew exactly where I had to go. And of course, as I said, I learned the necessary\nvocabulary that I needed --",
        "Q: By now you were --",
        "A: -- to -- to get around.",
        "Q: -- you were a big girl.",
        "A: Yeah, I was 12 years old, that\u2019s correct. Almost ready to get married. And I would -- I\nwould collect clothing from different people and I would go to the bakeries and collect\nbreads and cakes and pick up two valises and go to these Moroccan people and bring\nthem food and clothing. And was bit heavy because there were maybe -- maybe, oh, I\ndon\u2019t know, maybe 50, maybe 60 people, I don\u2019t know how many, 1-it -- and they lived\nlike in a cave. It wasn\u2019t even a house. It looked like a cave. And, of course, you must\nunderstand, not everyone was lucky to have a bed or a shower. So, I don\u2019t know how\nlong these people were living there, but they developed an odor that when I used to come\nto the hill, before I even walked up, I -- I -- I held my breath. And then I would walk up\nand leave the two valises in front of the entrance and run away. That -- That\u2019s what I did,\nfor five months. So -- And my mother did other volunteer work and my sister did\nvolunteer work and my brother did volunteer work, you know, whatever.",
        "Q: What encouraged you to do volunteer work, your mother?",
        "A: Yeah, my mother always did things. Our home was always open, we always had\npeople coming, going. We had a large table and the middle of the table, there was that\nsummervar -- the summervar. You know what a summervar is? It\u2019s that Russian, big\ncoffee pot or teapot. That\u2019s summervar, and with glasses and -- and we always had\npeople coming and my mother always baked a cookie, a -- you know, and fruits and\npeople would have a -- a glass of tea, not a cup of tea. So -- And -- And this thing was,\nyou know, with coal -- coal inside and that what made the water hot, and -- so it -- 1-1t\nwas an open house and -- and after the war, it was also an open house. Remember I told\nyou, whoever needed some potato soup, well, had a meal in my house and -- and if they\nneeded a place to sleep, well, there weren\u2019t enou -- there weren\u2019t enough beds, but we\nhad a floor, so no problem. M --",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you something about your comment. I know you were just making it\nlightly, but when you said you were 12 and you were almost ready to get married, does\nthat mean you were starting to get interested in boys here?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m just kidding you.",
        "Q: Oh, okay. So did you have any social life? Who did you [indecipherable]",
        "A: No. In Paris? None whatsoever, nothing. What we did in Paris is, you know, I would\ntake my mother to the Eif-Eiffel Tower, and we\u2019ll go to Pigall, to the street of Pigall,\nthere was a lot of entertainment there. I would walk -- of course I couldn\u2019t afford to go\ninto the opera, but I would walk from where I lived, just to stand there and look at this\nmagnificent building, the opera. So, no, we -- you know, like every day, I would take my\nmother someplace else and we would just go and look, you know, and I remember the\nwhole family one day, we went to Marseilles. That was very nice. You know, we kept\nbusy. You know, I was never bored, no.",
        "Q: But basically, you were there, sort of waiting to move?",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. We knew it was -- We were -- It was just sort of a hop over place, you\nknow? And after the five months that we were in France, we -- we went to Cannes -- oh,\nwell, as I said, I\u2019m jumping. We were supposed to go to the United States from Paris,\nexcept that the quota was delayed and --",
        "Q: Quota?",
        "A: Yeah, quota. There was always a quota. And my mother heard that there 1s going to be\na World War Three, and so she became panicky and she said, \u201cWe must leave Europe\nimmediately.\u201d So, she had a sister in Cuba. She call -- you know, she wrote to her a letter,\nand my aunt, you know, did whatever she was able to do, which wa -- it wasn\u2019t easy to\ncome to Cuba, but my aunt again, you know, paid whatever had to be paid and made the\nright papers and we went from Paris to Cannes and we took a boat, a commercial boat.",
        "Q: In France?",
        "A: That -- In France, yeah that -- that\u2019s the Riviera, okay, the area of Riviera, which I\ndon\u2019t know them, because again, we went there at night. But this is from where the\ncommercial -- a Polish commercial ship was leaving and we were the passengers on that\nship. And for three weeks we were on that ship, going to Cuba.",
        "Q: Do you remember it -- the other people you shared it with, or you -- it doesn\u2019t look\nlike it was a pleasant experience.",
        "A: No, because it was a commercial ship, I think we were the only family, maybe there\nwere a few other single people. Not going to Cuba, they were just working on -- on that\nship. We were the only ones who went to Cuba. But that ship made a stopover in Cuba,\neither picking up cargo or -- or delivering something. And this is how we wind up going\nwith this commercial ship. A, because I don\u2019t know 1-1-1f there were any luxury ships\ngoing from France to Cuba and B, if there were, we probably couldn\u2019t afford them. So,\nthis was the next best thing. Course, it was -- it was a very hard trip. I mean, 1-1-1t\u2019s not a\nluxury ship and we were all the way on the bottom there, in the cabins. And -- A-\nAlthough I wasn\u2019t sick, my sister was sick all the time, my mother was pretty good, my\nbrother was pretty good. And --",
        "Q: How did you eat?",
        "A: -- it seemed like forever. Well, we didn\u2019t eat much, there wasn\u2019t much to eat, but there\nwas bread and there was butter and there was milk and there was fish, I think, yeah fish.\nAnd that was fine. I mean, yes -- couldn\u2019t really starve, a hard boiled eggs, I mean, you\nknow, you -- a fruits, looks -- they didn\u2019t feed like it\u2019s a luxury boat. You have to\nunderstand, to me this was already luxury compared to my life before. This was\nwonderful. But, the sea was rough and -- a-and three weeks 1s a long time when it\u2019s not\nreally the right type of a boat, you know, to travel such a long time. But, we made it and\nit was a beautiful day when we arrived in Havana. It was beautiful. It was sunny like this\nand then when we came out on the deck and we looked down in that little launcher,\nwhich 1s a little boat, there were my aunts, waving to us, oh. That was such an exciting\nmoment in our lives, my God. These were aunts I didn\u2019t know, cause when they left, I -- I\nwas very little and my -- my -- my grandmother, who was their mother, she left, I was\nsix months old, so I -- I -- and of course, she died here, before I came. My -- My dis -- M-\nMy maternal grandmother died the day after we were liberated and she did not know that\nher oldest daughter was alive. Isn\u2019t that sad?",
        "Q: Your mother?",
        "A: Yeah, my mother was the oldest daughter out of four daughters and -- and one son.\nShe didn\u2019t know. And my aunts told me that she used to pray every day and say, \u201cOh, I\nwonder where my daughter Eta is with her ch -- family. Where 1s she? Is she al -- Is she\nalive, Is she alive?\u201d And she died the day before. It was so sad. Okay, so --",
        "Q: So these aunts were your mother\u2019s sisters?",
        "A: Yes, yes. From my father\u2019s side, everybody was killed. In fact, on Yom Kippur of\n1942, right? \u201842? *41? Get me, I think it\u2019s \u201842 - 1942. The whole town was wiped out.\nThe whole town of Volachisk was wiped out. That included my grandmother, her sons,\nher only daughter, her grandchildren, you know, aunts, uncles, you name it. The whole\ntown was wiped out. So, from my father\u2019s side, nobody. We had here a few cousins, my\nfather\u2019s few cousins. One is in Israel, one was here, she already passed away a long time\nago. So, all we really had are my mother\u2019s sisters and my mother\u2019s brother. And so my --\nth-th-the three sisters were in that boat, you know, on that little boat, launcher, you know,\nlooking up to us while we were on the deck waiting, you know, to disembark.",
        "Q: What are their names?",
        "A: Oh my, well the oldest one next to my mother is Clara, and she passed away a long\ntime ago. A lovely lady. We -- We lived with her for awhile until we were able -- she was\nthe one who lived in Cuba and she was the one who made us the papers and we lived\nwith her until we were able to afford an apartment. You know, until my mother went out\nto -- my mother never went out to work, I\u2019m sorry. My brother went out to work, my\nsister went out to work and I went out to work. Mother\u2019s wouldn\u2019t -- did not work in\nthose days, at least not by us. To us, she was a mother, and she was a widow and she\u2019s\nnot to work. So my mother was a housewife and we worked. And then my other two\naunts, the -- the other one who is next -- well, my uncle wasn\u2019t there, he was in Florida\nand his name is Abraham and he 1s not here any longer, may he rest in peace. And then\nthe next sister is Margaret and she passed away two years ago and I have just one and\nonly little aunt, my mother\u2019s youngest sister Elizabeth and she lives in Florida.",
        "Q: Your mother\u2019s maiden name 1s?",
        "A: Is Glaser.",
        "Q: Glaser.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that is the story --",
        "Q: Of Cuba?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s only the beginning, when we arrived.",
        "Q: Do you want to take a break?",
        "A: If you don\u2019t mind.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Okay. And I\u2019m going to have a cup of coffee. How\u2019s that, okay? Is it okay?",
        "Q: Absolutely.",
        "A: Yeah, I need something for my throat.",
        "Q: So we are in Cuba and you were telling me when we took a break what -- what you\ndid when you were there. When you first there and how you learned the language, how\nyou worked with a sick aunt and --",
        "A: Yeah. Okay, well, when we arrived in Cuba, in Havana, it was during middle of\nsemester. So, no school would accept me in the middle of semester. So, in the meantime,\nI learned the language on my own, and in three months I spoke Spanish fluently. It truly\nis a lovely, lovely language and lovely, lovely people. And we lived with my Aunt Clara,\nwho brought us to Cuba, for about five weeks and then my brother, my sister, they got\njobs and we were able to rent an apartment a block away from my aunt and we moved\ninto our own apartment, a one bedroom. And well, after I spoke Spanish, my cousin who\nis Clara\u2019s daughter, and she\u2019s not with us any longer, Dorothy, she went with me to a\nprivate school and asked them if they would accept me, since I came from Europe and I\nhad f-finished six grades in -- no, not six grades, I finished about five grades in -- in\nGermany and they were -- after examining me, they were willing to accept me. Now, this\nwas a private school of about 45 kids and I was the only Jewish person. And they were so\nenthused with me. And they liked me so much, of course -- oh, before they took me,\nthough, I had to go through exams from first grade, all the way to sixth grade.",
        "Q: In Spanish?",
        "A: That, absolutely. Okay? And that\u2019s when I was accepted to the sixth grade, because I\nwas up to par with them. And I was even better in math. I was very, very good in math.\nSo -- And, plus the fact that, I-I-I\u2019m a very well-behaved girl and I had the honor, and --\nand I know that a lot of the kids were very jealous and they really resented the fact that I,\nas a Jewish girl, an immigrant coming from Europe, I had the honor of holding the Cuban\nflag every morning when we sang the Cuban anthem. And after the year -- you know,\nafter graduating sixth grade, I graduated with a gold medal. And that was\n[indecipherable] school. Then, I did mention to you that my aunt [indecipherable]\nopportunity of raising money for her organization by running a dinner dance, and so I\nsang, you know, songs from the concentration camps and songs from the ghettos. And\nmy a -- my -- my -- my cousin Dorothy, her daughter, she would play the piano.",
        "Q: You sang in Spanish?",
        "A: I sang in Jewish. There were Jewish songs and Hebrew songs.",
        "Q: Do you remember what -- any one now?",
        "A: Yeah, well, except I don\u2019t have the voice and if I start singing, I will start crying.",
        "Q: Well, I don\u2019t --",
        "A: They\u2019re very sad songs, they really are. They\u2019re sad. And wa -- I will just give you the\ntitle of one of the songs and that\u2019s \u201cPuppyrosen.\u201d Puppyrosen in Russian means\ncigarettes. And the song is about a little boy who was left a orphan and -- and -- and he\u2019s\nstanding at the corner of a street, trying to make some money and it\u2019s windy and it\u2019s cold\nand it\u2019s raining. And he\u2019s asking, \u201cPlease, buy this cigarettes, so you can save my life.\u201d\nWas a really very sad. So I can\u2019t sing it for you. And there were other, you know, very\nsad songs about Jewish survival and atrocities and horrors that -- you know, that we went\nthrough. But --",
        "Q: What are any more of the songs?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: What other songs?",
        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see which other so -- oh, there wa -- there was one happy song.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: The happy song was, after all these sad songs, it was, \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to Israel, and\nI\u2019m saying goodbye to all of you and I\u2019m so happy that we are finally free and we going\nto the land -- to our Promised Land, and -- and -- oh, and this land 1s -- is a blessing for\nthe Jews and it was promised,\u201d you know, \u201cby God and -- a-a-a-and this -- this land is so\nimportant to -- a-a-a -- the -- to the Jewish nation. It\u2019s like -- a-an -- 1-it -- it\u2019s so\nimportant to -- to -- to the Jewish nations, like the right hand is to your body.\u201d I mean, a-\nand there\u2019s other which I -- offhand, I just -- I can\u2019t think. Well, anyway, she raised a lot\nof money, because so many people came an-and later on I\u2019Il show you, I have one of\nthose flyers that she made out, with my picture on it.",
        "Q: She was raising money for Jewish organizations?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, for Jewish organizations and the organizations in Cuba\nwhich dealt with, you know, children and poor people, or whatever. No, I need my thi -- I\ngot it, I got it, 1t\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. You know, so --",
        "Q: You can stop whenever you want --",
        "A: No -- no --",
        "Q: -- and have -- have some coffee.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s okay, that\u2019s fine, no. So that was that and course, after I graduated my\nSpanish school, I -- I -- I -- I took a job in a factory -- my cousin in a fac --",
        "Q: You graduated from school at what age?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: At --",
        "A: At 13 - 13.",

        "A: Yeah, 13 I graduated sixth grade.",
        "Q: Sixth grade. Oh, okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s as far as you went in Cuba?",
        "A: No, no, no. At that time. Then, I -- I -- I had -- Took my -- I had a job and I worked in\na factory and I was -- I used to pack merchandise and I -- I -- in the shipping department,\nokay? And I would go to school at night. And that\u2019s how I continued my education, by\ngoing to school at night. And in turn, my -- my -- my aunt got very sick, the one who\nbrought us to Cuba, Clara. And she -- she had her kidney removed and -- a-and I felt so\nobligated, you know, to -- to her, for being so good to us and bringing us to Cuba and\nsetting us up and helping us and -- and buying me things, clothing and all the things that I\n-- | -- I wanted to be her nurse, yeah, so I can stay with her until she gets better. And\nluckily, because I stayed with her, I discovered that she had diabetes. After surgery, she\ndeveloped diabetes. And how did I detected diabetes? Because I would change her\nwound every morning. And one morning I took that sheet and I hung it outside, she had a\nbalcony by her window. You know, by her room and later on when I went to take it in, I\nsaw ants crawling on that area and I knew it had to be sugar, glucose.",
        "Q: All right, now we\u2019re moving over to the other side of tape two.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: All right, this is tape two, side B, of an interview with Frima Laub. We are in Cuba\nand in the hospital with your aunt.",
        "A: Yeah, and so when the doctor came, I told him, I says, \u201cYou know, doctor, this and\nthis is what happened. And sure enough, when they -- after they tested her, they found\nout that she had -- she developed diabetes during surgery. Isn\u2019t that something? You\nknow, from the shock, many times people develop diabetes. Well, I remained with her at\nthe hospital 24 hours a day for five weeks, until she got better and then she went home. I\nwent home and I continued working and actually, I was able to take off from work\nbecause I worked for her son, her son had the factory, so it was no problem. My siblings\nworked. My mother did not work, because in those years, and according to our -- our way\nof life, a mother should not be working. Her place is at home, and that\u2019s what we did. My\nmother stayed home, she was a housewife and all of us worked and we all, you know,\nchipped in and paid for the rent and we had a one bedroom apartment, my mother and I,\ncause at that time already, my sister got married and she lived in a different city.",
        "Q: To a Cuban man?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, someone --",
        "Q: Jewish?",
        "A: -- ah, Jewish, yeah. A Jewi -- Cuban Jewi -- a Cuban Jew. And -- And my brother had\nhis own place in Havana and my mother and I, we lived on the outskirts of Havana, we\nhad the one bedroom apartment. And not too far from my aunt, of course, you know. And\nI -- I had -- I had a lot of friends and I loved the Cuban people. And w-we were never\nafraid we would, you know, go out at night and walk, one, two o\u2019clock in the morning.\nNobody ever was afraid of anybody, everything was very peaceful.",
        "Q: Who was the leader of Cuba at that time?",
        "A: At that time, was Batista. Fulgencio Batista. And -- In fact, while talking about\nFulgencio Batista, a group of us, we were -- we had some friends who worked in\nBatista\u2019s summer home, Valadero Beach, and we were -- you know, we went to\nValadero, which is very beautiful town near the most beautiful beach in the world. We\nwent to spend some time by the beach and our friends who worked for Batista asked us if\nwe wanted to sleep over in Batista\u2019s summer home, since the family was away. So we\ndid. How about that? Boy, boyo.",
        "Q: How old were you then? Teenager, right?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: At that time I was already a teenager, but to me it was something very exciting, to\nsleep in a president\u2019s house. Hey, that was quite an honor.",
        "Q: Were most of your friends and associates Jewish?",
        "A: Well, where I worked -- you know, later on, of course, I changed jobs. 15, I already\nworked -- was it 15 or 16? Probably 16, excuse me, at the age of 16, that means three\nyears I worked in the factory. Then, I -- I -- I worked in a department store as a buyer. I --\nI had all kinds of friends. I had a Italian friend who had a beautiful voice and he sang like\nMario Lanza. Oh, he had such a beautiful voice. And, of course, we used to sing at all our\nfriends weddings. That means we worked -- we all worked the same place. So there were\na few who were getting married. So, when we used to go to their weddings, he -- oh,\nwhat was his name? Ooh. Gino, I think. Gino, Gino. We would sing together.",
        "Q: In Spanish?",
        "A: Of course, yeah, that was in Spanish.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, we had s -- had Syrian friends. I had Italian friends, I had Cuban friends, I had\nJewish friends. I also had a -- an Oriental friend. Yeah, I -- I -- I was beautiful. Only, we\nwere just --",
        "Q: There -- There was a large population of Chinese immigrants into Cuba also, wasn\u2019t\nthere?",
        "A: Yes, I would say yes and I\u2019m thinking that it was not as large as -- the -- it wasn\u2019t very\nlarge, because you see, 1-it\u2019s a very small country, a -- really very small, so mostly,\neveryone settle in Havana, so there was, you know, X amount, a small population of\nJewish people, Chinese people, whatyouma -- Syrian people, you know?

A-And --And if they\nheard, oh you came from -- from Europe, oh then, you know, they have to extra care --\nextra good care of you, you know? This is the type of people they were. They were also\npeople like -- if they would have a piece of bread and you tell them you\u2019re hungry, they\u2019Il\ngive you half of their bread. Without asking any questions, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are.\nSo, this is the type of people that they were. Of course, I don\u2019t know what kind of people\nthey are today. Must understand, it\u2019s been over 40 years. Now, leadership had changed,\nand people changed --",
        "Q: Oh, but yi -- that\u2019s not why you left?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not at all. The reason why -- I left before Castro came into\npower and that was simply because I felt that there wasn\u2019t for me, enough, in Cuba, as far\nas a social life, as far as marriage. You know, like -- are -- and I felt that -- and my aunts\nreally wanted me to come here. That was a good reason. So they quickly made up papers\nfor me and I came to the United States.",

And while I\nwas here, Castro came into power, because I came here in 1957, okay? And Castro came\ninto power 1959 or \u201860, something like that. 19 six -- maybe \u201859. Oh well, something\nlike. So, I -- I came here and I lived with my aunts.",

        "A: Oh, yes I did. I went back to visit my mother, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Many times?",
        "A: N-Not many times, because then my mother decided to come here, too, so --",
        "Q: Because of the political scene?",
        "A: Because she felt my brother\u2019s here and I\u2019m here, then -- and her sisters are here, so\nwhat is she going to do there, you know? And the other sister were here already, too. You\nsee, like, my aunt also moved here. So my aunt and -- my mother decided she may as\nwell stay -- come to the United States. Why stay in Cuba?",
        "Q: Do you remember any particular feelings of sadness about leaving from one place to\nanother, or --",
        "A: I -- I-- You know, I -- I really didn\u2019t feel sad, because I knew Cuba\u2019s only 45 minutes\nfrom -- from Miami, so it\u2019s not like you going away -- far, far away. And then, the fact\nthat I\u2019m -- I\u2019m having family here and my brother\u2019s here an-and my mother was willing\nto come, so I didn\u2019t feel that I was lonely, you know, that I'll be alone in the world, so no,\nI -- | always felt I can go back to Cuba. Uh-huh, you have a ha -- an hour. Uh-huh.",
        "Q: All right, so, in your arrival to America, where did your family live and where did\nyou first settle?",
        "A: Okay, the first stop was east New York. My aunt lived on Miller Avenue.",
        "Q: On what?",
        "A: Miller Avenue, in east New York. And, very lovely area and this is my youngest aunt,\nwho had -- I mean, one son passed away, unfortunately, but at that time she had two boys\nand her husband and they lived in an apartment, but she had a room for me. And we got\nalong very well and I really was very happy, you know, be wi -- in her house. And during\nthat time, my brother got married, my mother came to the wedding. And --",
        "Q: Your brother married an American?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, got married here. And then, oh yeah, then I decided I wanted to stay here\npermanently, so -- but I was here on a temporary visa and the only way for me to remain,\nI either had to go to school or marry an American. So, I decided I would like to go to\nschool. But then, you know, not every school is going to admit you and I wanted to go to\na Yeshiva University. That\u2019s a teacher\u2019s institute for women, a Yeshiva University. So, I\n-- So -- [ -- Then, at that time, I moved to another aunt of mine, who is not here any\nlonger, Margaret and I went -- Manya, we used to call her, and she --",
        "Q: Manya?",
        "A: Manya, yeah. Russian name.",
        "Q: That\u2019s pa -- a Russian --",
        "A: Russian name.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re speaking English now.",
        "A: I know. So I call her Margaret.",
        "Q: So where did you learn English?",
        "A: Oh, English. Oh, wa -- English, I learned in Cuba.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, right. I learned in Cuba, in my -- you know, my -- my courses, I took English.\nJust like I took shorthand and I took typing, you know, commercial course and\neverything else. And I took bookkeeping. You name it, I took a lot of things. And let\u2019s\nsee, where was I now? And --",
        "Q: Yeshiva.",
        "A: Okay, right. Okay, so -- so my Aunt Manya took me to meet her rabbi, who 1s now a -\n- a -- the chairman of the -- oh, what do you call this? Big organization, I just forgot the\nname of it, but okay, his name is Rabbi Arthur Schnier. And he really deals now, at the\npresent time with -- with relationships between Judaism and Christian -- Christians, you\nknow, yeah, he\u2019s -- I forgot what he called it. P\u2019Il tell you in a minute.[indecipherable |\nYeah, okay, so I went and I met Rabbi Arthur Schnier and h-he was always involved in\npolitics and he knew a lot of people in Washington and he knew a lot of people here.\nAnd anyway, my aunt told him the story, that I would like to remain in, you know, this\ncountry and I would like to go to school. And so my choice is Teacher\u2019s Institute for\nWomen, I would like to be a Hebrew teacher. And so he said, \u201cOkay, Ill see what I can\ndo,\u201d and he arranged for the Yeshiva to accept me, but before, I had to go through exam.\nNow, I never had any background in the Yeshiva or anything like that, but they gave me\ntwo weeks to prepare myself for the exam and I did very well, I was accepted. And after I\nwas accepted, I -- I was going to -- to school three times a week and -- and I worked 20\nhours a week. I was allowed to work 20 hours a week, so I always had, you know, a few\ndollars of my own. And I -- I-I met, in my class, my classmate. We became very good\nfriends, with this young lady, her name was Sivia and she lived in Crown Heights,\nBrooklyn and she would occasionally invite me to her house for, you know, for the\nweekend. And then one day she said to me, \u201cYou know, I know s -- a very nice fellow I\nwould like you to meet.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh Sivia, I have so many blind dates. I really don\u2019t\nwant to meet any more.\u201d And she said to me, \u201cBut he\u2019s very nice, and I do want you to\nmeet him. So, let me give him your telephone number and I\u2019Il never bother you again.\u201d\nWell, she gave Harry, my husband my telephone number, and he called me. So, we made\na date, the day my brother was getting married. So he should come to the wedding and\npick me up. And that\u2019s what he did. And so, we met. And we went out and I guess there\nwas something that we developed in common. And then, after, you know, dating him for\nabout five months -- from January, February, March, April, May, June, five months and\nhe never said anything. So, I said to myself, \u201cOkay, Pll make him talk.\u201d I can\u2019t go on,\nyou know, I just come out and ask him, \u201cWell, are we serious? I-Is -- I mean, are you\ninterested in me or what?\u201d So, I said to myself, \u201cOkay, that gives me a chance to go back\nto visit my mother.\u201d Okay? And that wa -- no, the ma -- ma -- I\u2019m sorry, my mother was\nhere, the rest of the family, right. I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to go to Cuba.\u201d And that\u2019s\nwhat I did. So, we were dating for f-five months, he said nothing, so I told him, \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing back to Cuba and -- and I\u2019Il decide if I\u2019m -- you know, I'll think about if I\u2019m\ncoming back or not coming back, I\u2019m --\u201d this, that. So, I went back to Cuba and he\nstarted writing letters. Every day I would get a letter from him and telephone calls and\nthis and that and this and that. And then, in the meantime, I -- I was teaching in the -- in\nthe Hebrew school in Cuba, Judaism. And Labor day, my husband surprised me and\ncame to visit me, to Cuba, and -- you know, in those days we had no jets. I-It -- He had to\nfly four and a half hours -- five hours to get to Cuba from the u -- from New York. But he\ncame and he met the rest of the family.",
        "Q: This is in the early 60\u2019s?",
        "A: Yup, this was -- This was in, yeah, 1960. No, no, I\u2019m sorry, 1959, no, 1959, because\nwe got married in 1960. 1959, and then he came again Christmas -- Christmas weekend,\nyou know, the same year, and he proposed. And so, we got married --civilly married in\nCuba that is. And within three weeks, I was able to come into the United States as a\nresident, cause I married an American.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t go back because you had to, did you?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go back. I remained --",
        "Q: Okay. To Cuba?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, I just went for a visit. And then -- but he, you know, a-a-after I married\nhim, whatyoumacallit, legally, I become, automatically a resident of the United States, so\nI came in as a resident, within three weeks and then we got religiously married in April.\nApril 10th of 1960.",
        "Q: I want to ask you something about your relationship with your husband, when you\nwere courting. Did you speak to him about the -- your experiences, or did you speak to\nanyone about your experiences during the Nazi regime?",
        "A: You know, it seems like all the survivors have the same problem. After the war, when\n-- you know, when we came to Cuba, and my mother wanted to tell her sisters, as to what\nshe went through during the war, you know, the Holocaust experience. The first thing\nthey said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. It 1s past, 1t\u2019s finished with. You are free. Forget it.\u201d\nNow, you cannot forget it. You cannot just push it away. But -- Although they meant\nwell, it wasn\u2019t right. And so the minute they said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, it\u2019s finished with,\nnow you\u2019re free, you\u2019re here, everything will be all right. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201d So we never spoke\nabout it. And when I was, you know, dating my husband or when I was with whomever I\nwas, I f -- I didn\u2019t want, A, to talk about it, because it\u2019s very painful. Every time I would\nstart talking, I would start crying. It\u2019s only recently that I don\u2019t cry as much and I think I\nran out of -- of -- of tears. But, that makes me sick. Like, for example, you take this\ninterview. It\u2019ll take me a week or 10 days for me to get back to be normal. That means, I\nwon\u2019t sleep nights. That means, it\u2019s constantly even more so. Although I live with this\nexperience every day, by talking about it, it -- it intensifies and intensifies my whole\nsystem, my mind, my body, everything like, gets sick. So, we didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "Q: When did you first begin to talk about it?",
        "A: I think maybe fif -- 10 years ago, 15 years ago, maybe.",
        "Q: Before the interview with the Holocaust Museum?",
        "A: No, I think during that time, yeah. I would say I would start talking about it -- was\ntruly telling the story? That was the first time I would sit and tell the story. In between, I\nwould tell my children, here and there a little bit. Cause when they were small, I didn\u2019t\nwant to upset them. I didn\u2019t want them to be afraid of this world by thinking, \u201cOh, that\u2019s\nwhat happened to my mother. Might happen to me, too.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t want them to live\nwith that worry on their minds, so I kept quiet. But, occasionally, things would happen so\nvery quickly, I would say something, you know? And that was that, you know, but they -\n- I never really sat down to tell them the story until I was interviewed by the -- by the\nmuseum.",
        "Q: Did you have -- Pll -- We\u2019ll go back to marriage. We\u2019 ll -- We\u2019ll never forget about\nmarriage. So that\u2019ll be easy, well, that\u2019Il be the next tape, but do you have -- you\nmentioned -- made reference to dreams or nightmares or -- about what sorts of things do\nyou dream?",
        "A: Well, you know, for many, many years after the war, I was always dreams. I used to\ndream a lot about my father and just wake up screaming like -- I saw him as how he\ndisappeared, you know? I -- I -- I used to dream about the bombing. I -- I used to -- to\ndream about suddenly finding myself alone, you know, nobody\u2019s there but me, I\u2019m alone.\nI-I-I mean, you know, a lot of these things. But then, it wasn\u2019t already dreams, it\u2019s reality,\nevery day, see? Every day, there is something that reminds me of my past. So, although I\ndon\u2019t have as many dreams as I used to have, I am constantly reminded by different\nthings that I come across.",
        "Q: Tell me what kind of things.",
        "A: Well, the story with my cat who was killed while walking behind me. And so I\nalways, when I see a -- a Persian cat, 1-1t bothers me, you know, 1-it really -- tears come to\nmy eyes, because I always keep thinking, was that bullet meant for me, or was it truly\nmeant for my cat? And then, why should a cat be killed? He did nothing. I -- So, I -- I\nwould just walk and -- and -- and -- and I'll say to myself, \u201cOh, he looks just like my cat,\nmy kitty.\u201d A-A-And then, I\u2019Il hear a -- a German Shepherd bark and that\u2019 lI -- it\u2019s like\nsuddenly I find myself -- I have to hide. Hey, but why am I hiding? I am in a free\ncountry. But that\u2019s the feeling I get. I-I-I see a fellow walking with that -- with that hat,\nthat cap, a little raise up front like the German soldiers -- not the ger -- the SS would wear\nand I -- and I'll say, \u201cOoh, is he one of them?\u201d I mean, 1-it\u2019s really crazy, but that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s what this war did to you. A -- A -- A barn, I -- Pll walk by, I mean, you know, on\nthe island, the houses and they have like little barns in the back and there goes the\nmemory to when we were hiding and then we had to jump from -- fro -- from the attic of\nthat barn and -- and run away because the Germans will -- while the Germans were\nbreaking the door to get in to get us. And w-we jumped down and we ran away. A-And\nit\u2019s, hey --",
        "Q: Do you ever think of that little dog that kept you warm under the house?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. That little dog. The reason why I -- I think of him a lot 1s the fact that he\nwas so good. Can you imagine a dog would not bark when he sees me climbing in, you\nknow? And I would lie down and he would lie on my legs to keep me warm, because I\nhad no blanket. I told you, remember I was walking with knee-highs? I had nothing to\ncover myself with. An-And the lady didn\u2019t know that I slept under her house with her\ndog. And this dog just was so smart. I would just climb in and lie down and he would\nright away lie down on my legs and keep me warm.",
        "Q: Have you had pets since?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Do you think this -- there\u2019s a reason for that?",
        "A: Yeah, there is a reason, yeah. See, I only had one doll in my life and that was the doll\nthat my bro -- my father bought for me before the war. I had a beautiful doll, a big one.\nMy father took me to this store that sold only dolls. And he said to me, \u201cYou pick.\u201d And I\nwas So little, but I picked this doll from the shelf and the doll was bigger than I was. I\ncouldn\u2019t even carry the doll home, my sister had to carry it for me and the doll would sit\non the rocking chair in the living room. And this is the doll I took with me when we went\nto the ghetto, when we had to leave home. And of course, you know, after -- after the\npogrom, I never saw my doll again. After that, I never had a doll again, that was finished.\nBecause I think that with the war, my childhood went, okay? I-I think that the Holocaust\nkilled my childhood, but did not kill my spirit and did not kill, you know, the rest of my\nlife. I -- I\u2019m still alive an-and going strong. A-And then after what happened to my cat, I\nnever wanted one. I always think about my cat, but I never wanted one. And when I had\nmy little boy, my youngest son, a neighbor of mine had a -- a Siamese cat and the\nSiamese cat gave birth to little Siamese kittens and she said, \u201cFrima, you should have one\nfor your child. And I\u2019m giving it to you for nothing and you know how expensive they\nare and you know how good they are, [indecipherable].\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cFine.\u201d So I got\none for my -- for my son. But, every so often, when I used to sit down and the cat would\njump into my lap and I would, you know, caress him and I -- I would think about my --\nmy Persian cat a-and then I gave it away and I -- and I really, you know, I don\u2019t want any\n-- any more, cause it\u2019s -- it was a horrible experience, and -- and I used, you know, to\ndream about my cat and always used to scream and 1-1t was really bad, it was very a -- for\na -- to a child it was terrible, you know, terrible shock, a-a-and -- and -- and the fact that -\n- that I let him die without even turning around looking at him or picking him up or --",
        "Q: So having -- Part of what has happened through your whole experience, 1s hiding your\nfeelings?",
        "A: Sure. It was always -- no one should know you are Jewish. It\u2019s like you have some\nkind of a disease. I mean, to go as far as to know, at the age of six, that if I should turn\naround an-an-and -- and talk to my cat or pick up my cat or caress my cat or whatever,\nthat the Germans will know I\u2019m Jewish. I -- I mean, that takes an awful lot of -- out of\nyou of -- of saying, what am I, am I not human? I mean, who am I? What am I?

        "A: No, ninet -- no, civil ceremony, 1959, okay? Then, three weeks later, we came to the\nUnited States and we set a date for April the 10th, 1960, to be married. And, at that time,\nmy mother was here already. My sister was in Cuba and she did not make it to the\nwedding, but my brother was here, my aunts and my uncles and everybody was at the\nwedding and it was just very lovely.

        "Q: I want to ask you, before we -- because this getting married brings up the subject of --\nof where you get married, which brings up the subject of identity as a religious Jew.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Has this been a part -- an important part of your experience, or --",
        "A: An important part of survival.",
        "Q: In what way\u201d?",
        "A: Well, you see, by believing that God will help you and that there\u2019s someone watching\nover you, that was a -- a tremendous help for a child to survive. Because, although I was -\n- you know, I had no mother with me, I had no one, I was alone, I knew God will help\nme. And I did my praying every night, as you know that my mother left me the hundred\nrubles, and after the second lady, the one who shaved my head because I was infested\nwith lice, because here and there, I didn\u2019t have a shower or a bath or anything like that\nand I slept with mice crawling over me. I -- I bought a cross for the hundred rubles. Now,\nI knew that the reason why I need the cross is in case I\u2019m stopped by someone and they\nwill accuse me of being a Jew, I can prove I\u2019m not, cause I wanted to live. But, I also\nknew that Christianity is not me. I\u2019m a Jew and I have my own prayers and I have to say\nthose prayers and I have to talk to God and he will help me. And that\u2019s exactly what I\ndid. Every night, when I climbed in, you know, in -- one, two o\u2019clock in the morning\nwhen I climbed in to my -- my -- my doggy, to sleep with, I would take off my cross and\nin Hebrew I would say my prayers, those prayers that my mother taught me when I was a\nlittle girl.",
        "Q: Do you remember one of the prayers now?",
        "A: Well, the prayers, it 1s called, Creat schma. It\u2019s a prayer before you go to sleep, okay?\nSo, I would say Creat schma. And then in the morning, when I would get up and -- and\nshake off the hay, because we slept -- the dog and I slept on the hay, okay? And I shake\noff the hay and -- and got myself, you know, straightened out, I should -- shouldn\u2019t look\nlike I c-come hiding from someplace, put my scarf on. I would say, Moday ani. Moday\nani 1s a Jew -- is a Hebrew prayer where I thank you God for -- that I\u2019m -- that I got up,\nthat I survived another day, that I\u2019m here. And then after that, I would put the cross on\nagain. Now, I knew the reason why I was wearing a cross, not because I was giving away\nmy belief, but because, if I\u2019m a Christian, I can survive. I will not be killed. Where, if I\u2019m\na Jew, I haven\u2019t got a chance.",
        "Q: And today, are you active in a spiritual, religious community?",
        "A: Yeah. I am a religious Jew. I remained religious all through the Holocaust, after the\nHolocaust, the way I am now. And I -- I truly feel, and that is my -- my very deep belief\nthat there was and there is someone above me who guided me to do all these things that I\ndid to survive. I was only five years old and I acted as if I was someone of 50. And I was\nsix year old, I did things like a six year old person. So, there\u2019s got to be s -- a power over\nme, making me do things. Giving me that -- that -- that intelligence. I mean, I -- I -- I look\nat my grandchild, five years old and I say, \u201cOh my God, Oh my God. Please God,\u201d and I\nalways pray to God, \u201cMay -- May no child know of -- of -- of such horrors.\u201d But they\ncould never survive, because they never think the way I thought. Now, did I think\nbecause I was a genius? No, it\u2019s because there\u2019s something that I can not explain. But I\nfeel it. So, with the sad life and the hard life and the disappointments in life, I always feel\nthat I\u2019m rewarded by God. I really do. And I always thank God for everything. After the\nmeals, I thank God. When I light my candles, I thank God. Whatever there is, I always\npray, but when I pray, I really pray with my heart. And I -- And I -- And I remember wh-\nwh-when I was that little girl, that five, six year old girl and -- and I was all alone, I never\nfelt alone. I always felt that there\u2019s someone watching over me. A-A-And this is\nsomething that\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s extremely important to a child. Not to feel alone. Yeah, I\nwas frightened, but I always knew that there\u2019s a salvation, you know? Because I was\npraying, because I was talking and -- and, you know, to God. And -- And this 1s -- That\u2019s\na wonderful way of surviving.",
        "Q: It\u2019s -- It\u2019s is -- It is to some and -- and then to others, their response has been totally\ndifferent.",
        "A: Unfortunately, yes. And you can not blame those people, no. Cause they went -- the\nhorrors were -- are absolutely -- you can\u2019t understand the horrors. I-I-I-It -- Your mind\njust can not absorb or understand that such a thing exists, and -- and -- and someth -- and\none human does it to another and -- and the victim did nothing. Simply because he is a\nJew? So what does it mean? It -- Because a Jew? What is it, no good? What are we -- are\nwe -- am I diseased? A-Am I -- Di-Did I kill someone? Why such hatred? Why such\nhostility? Crime. I mean, so much. Y-You probably heard it, that when we were standing\nar -- I mean, I don\u2019t know if you want to hear it, when we were standing on line to be\nkilled, the first pogrom, a-and we were 1n like maybe two or three people ahead of us, we\nwere all in line, you know, with our underwear only, waiting to be killed. We had those\nkilling squads. There was a mother holding a little baby, right? And this German walks\nover to her, a-and wants to take the baby away from her. She wouldn\u2019t let him. And there\nwas a whole struggle going on and I\u2019m standing there in shock. I didn\u2019t know wha -- a --\na -- a-- I didn\u2019t believe my own eyes, I-I mean -- so, you\u2019re talking about a five year old\nkid standing there and watching that -- this German is trying to take the baby away from\nthe mother and the mother wouldn\u2019t let. So he pulls the baby towards him and she pulls\nthe baby towards her, right? There\u2019s how. Finally, he got the baby out of her arms, pi-\npicks up his -- his -- his leg, yeah, with those boots up there and breaks the baby\u2019s back\nand gives it back to the ba -- to the mother. Are these atrocities? Who can forget this?",
        "Q: Does this make you bitter and angry over other things in your life, I mean. Are you\nangry at --",
        "A: I\u2019m angry at the world, yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: The religious Christians?",
        "A: I-I -- I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m exactly picking out religious, non-religious. I\u2019m just angry at\nthe world, simply because the world didn\u2019t even try to save some children. There\u2019s a\nmillion and a half children slaughtered for nothing and nobody tried to help them. That\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m angry about. Has nothing to do with religion or not religion. Just as a human\nbeing, how could you not try to do something? Maybe -- M-Maybe they -- they couldn\u2019t\nsaved everyone, but some? And do you remember that there was that ship, Saint Louis,\nthat had 900 -- 850 or 900 German Jews from the high society, you are talking the\nwealthy people, they\u2019re educated people, doctors and dentists and engineers and you\nname it. And the United States didn\u2019t want to let them in. A handful of people, 900\npeople they didn\u2019t want to let them in and then, when they went to Cuba, Cuba said,\n\u201cHey, the United States 1s not letting them in, why should I bother?\u201d They are a little,\nsmall country. They didn\u2019t let them in, either. And --",
        "Q: Where were you [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was in Europe?",
        "Q: You were in Europe when this happened?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. This was -- This must have been in 1940 when the ship came around. And\nnobody wanted that ship with the 900 Jews. So, you see why I\u2019m angry?",
        "Q: Oh --",
        "A: It\u2019s the world. It\u2019s not just particular people. And nobody -- And they went back to\nGermany.",
        "Q: Do you remember who was president when you first came here?",
        "A: Well, during the war, Frankwi -- Franklin Roosevelt was president during World War\nTwo.",
        "Q: Do you remember impressions about him? Family impressions?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you the following. I\u2019m -- After the war -- after the war, I -- remember\nI told you my house was always open, people used to come and go and have a cup of tea\nand have soup. I was then eight years old, nine years old. I -- I would hear how the older\n-- you know, the older survivors would talk. And then I first realized what they were\ntalking about. They were saying that what happened to the president of the United States.\nThat the United States did nothing. That Roosevelt obviously didn\u2019t care much about\nJews. So, that\u2019s the only thing that I began to understand. That there was such a thing as a\npresident and the president just didn\u2019t care about the Jews.",
        "Q: So, you did -- you were aware that survivors then, only talked to each other about the\nexperience. You did hear other surviv -- older survivors talking, and that was the only\ntime it was every discussed?",
        "A: That\u2019s it. That\u2019s is. They were talking, saying that nobody was there to help the Jews.\nThere was nobody except God, and that was that.",
        "Q: There\u2019s a list of different things that happened in -- in the world history, but especially\nin the -- in the American history, that I\u2019d like to read to you to see if any of these things\nyou connected with your experience and with that experience and -- and if you didn\u2019t,\nwe'll just move on, you know, but I -- I think the --",
        "A: Are you talking about now or when I was 10 years old? What are we talking -- I mean,\ntalking about how I felt --",
        "Q: Well, I'll --",
        "A: Yeah, go ahead, read it.",
        "Q: This is one example, the Japanese concentration camps that happened in America.\nYou might have been not here, or [indecipherable |",
        "A: I heard of them, but there is no comparisons. No comparisons whatsoever. The\nconcentration camps that the Germans built, nobody builds concentration camps like they\ndo. And the atrocities that they committed, no one that I know of today, does what they\ndid then. Now, concentration camp might have different meanings, see? The\nconcentration camps of the Chinese people here, that the one you\u2019re talking about?",
        "Q: Yeah, Japanese camps.",
        "A: Japanese, oh, okay, was a camp where the people, because of the war with Japan, the\ngovernment wanted to make sure that these people do not commit terrorism and\ntherefore, it was a camp for people to concentrate. But there were no killings, there were\nno atrocities. There were no starvation. There were no beatings. There were no ripping\napart human -- person apart. Or pulling his a -- eyes out or pulling his teeth out or ripping\nhim to pieces w-while he\u2019s alive and burning him to death. So, how can we compare a\nUnited States camp, which is a camp just to make sure that these people do not commit\nterrorism, compared to a concentration camp -- a German concentration camp where\nthere -- the idea was to annihilate people. To get rid of them as quickly as possible and to\ndo a lot of -- what do we call it, experiments. Do you know that they -- they used the skin\nto make lampshades? And -- And some other things?",
        "Q: So, I want to ask you, Frima, cause I\u2019m trying to focus on -- on -- on your -- your\nparticular experience and that is -- so, in your life, are there things, like in your job that\nyou do right now, or that in the work that you\u2019ve had or in your attitudes toward people,\nor homeless or -- that relate, that are inspired by that experience? I hate to use the word\ninspired, but -- but are -- are you motivated still today in constructive ways?",
        "A: Very much so.",
        "Q: Could you tell me a little bit about what you\u2019re doing today that -- or --",
        "A: You see, somehow my -- my sad life and my experience, all this still left me with a\nvery good heart. And -- And it just doesn\u2019t matter to me if I\u2019m dealing with a person from\nany nationality. I-It just doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just the fact that I want to help and it\u2019s the\nright thing to do. It\u2019s to help another human being, cause we all belong to God and we all\nhis children and we should help each other. And so, as hard as my life was -- but there\nwere some of those good Gentile people that helped me. So, I-I never thought otherwise,\nthis how I\u2019m supposed to be and this is how every person should be. And -- And you\nprobably heard or maybe I didn\u2019t mention to you, that when we came back, you know,\nafter the war, after liberation, we came back home an-and remember I told you there was\na Gentile man that, when I was alone and I was starved and I needed food, I -- I went to\nhim and I told him I was hungry, so he offered me a glass of milk, a piece of black bread\nand a piece of pork. And I, as a Jew, in whose house we had no pork, I had the milk, I\nhad the bread, but I wouldn\u2019t touch the pork. And I never told him why, cause I\u2019m not\nsupposed to tell him. I just eat what he gave me and I thanked him and I loved him for it.\nAlso, the first pogrom, when we ran away, we met in his house, you know, we are\nsupposed to an-and we did, we met in his house an-and he let us stay overnight in his\ncellar and I remember the rats were running all over us, but we stayed at night there.\nNow, when we came back -- after liberation we came back home, we were notified by his\nwife that the Russian government wants to put him in jail because he was -- he was an\ninformant and -- yeah, he was an informant and we don\u2019t really know what happened,\nwhat he did, because we were in Romania, right? So, we don\u2019t know what happened\nhere. But I remember that he was good to us and his wife said, \u201cIf you child will go to\ncourt and tell them how he treated you and your family, they will let him go, he won\u2019t\nhave to go to jail.\u201d Well, I did. My mother took me to court and I remember it was a\nround room. And in the middle there was a chair and I climbed on the chair and I stood\nand told them that this man saved my life, because I was starved and he gave me food to\neat. And the night that we had no place where to go, we came to him and he let us -- and\nthey let him free. So, you see, when somebody does good for you, you learn something\nfrom it and you try to do the same.",
        "Q: And you still have kosher household -- kitchen?",
        "A: Yeah, yup. It\u2019s still a kosher home and my children follow me in the same footsteps.",
        "Q: So your children also married Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, they all married to Jewish boys, Jewish girls and -- and that\u2019s how they bring up\ntheir children and that -- that\u2019s a blessing for me.",
        "Q: Can you see them?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You see them often?",
        "A: Absolutely, we see them and we talk to each other. And it\u2019s wonderful to have\ngrandchildren and I feel especially blessed, you know, that when Hitler thought he\u2019ll get\nrid of me, look, I brought up two generations. And I was a step ahead of my enemy, all\nthe time, see? And that is something that I feel that I-I couldn\u2019t have done it on my own.\nAnd I had no -- no one to tell me what to do, right? Except God was telling me what to\ndo and that\u2019s what I did, and here I am.",
        "Q: And -- And I -- I get the feeling you also have non-Jewish friends.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh sure I do. What --",
        "Q: And your work now?",
        "A: -- why not?",
        "Q: Well yeah, why not?",
        "A: They all wonderful. You see, I look at people, not at their beliefs or their color or their\nrace. I look at people. There are good people and there are bad people and I love to work\nwith a lot of different people. And I love -- I have neighbors, all kinds of neighbors. I\nhave a Yugoslavian neighbor, an Italian neighbor, a Jewish neighbor, another Italian\nneighbor and I love them. And we get along so well. And why not? That\u2019s how is has to\nbe. Maybe if -- if we would only try to be good to each other, the world will be a better\nworld to live in and then we wouldn\u2019t let these things happen, these atrocities and some\nof them are happening today in the other countries, yugos -- what was it?

People\nwho are depressed, people who have problems with their children, hyperactive children.\nBut I like my job. I like it very much, cause I love to look at the children and I always\nsay, \u201cI hope they never go through horrors like we did in Europe.\u201d I always pray for these\nchildren. And I love it. I like to work. I like to be with young people. The thought of\nretiring scares me. Well --",
        "Q: Well, when -- when you -- when we part today, after this interview, are you going to\nhave someone to talk to about any extra experiences that you thought in your mind, that\ncame to you? Would you talk to your husband or any of your children or any of your\nfriend survivors?",
        "A: To talk to them about today? Well the rest of the month --",
        "Q: Well, about whatever comes up afterwards. You said often, you said maybe for a\nweek or 10 days --",

The husband comes home, he -- he\n-- he -- he has so many responsibilities at work. The only way that I will handle my\nfrustration and my sadness and then, you know, and everything else that this would leave\nme with, is I will just start writing and maybe someday, I would like to publish a book.\nAnd -- And -- And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I -- I do want to leave a book out there\nfor the children. For elementary school children, for high school children, so they can see\nthat there is strength and when you have belief, that helps and you can do -- you -- you ca\n-- you can do a lot of things when you have to.

        "Q: This is the final side, B, of tape three, Frima Laub and we\u2019re about to complete the\ninterview, due to time constrictions, but I did want to ask about your mother. You\nmentioned on the 1990 interview, that your mother suffered from the day she died. And I\nwondered if you -- this triggers back to the -- her experience in the Holocaust, or did you\nmean physical suffering, or --",
        "A: Well, my mother really never got over the Holocaust. Sh-She just never was able to\nrecuperate. A, a-as you know, as a mother, she -- she lost her husband. She was a very\nyoung widow. Then she went through all this and she was the one who had to make all\nthe plans for our escape. She did all this, you know, the plans. You know, you -- you\nprobably know that we were also in jail for awhile, okay. I mean, she made all these --\nthese plans of how to escape and where to run and what to say and where to -- where to\ngo, because we were children. I was a little nothing and my dau -- my sister was 10 years\nolder than I was, so she was still a child. So, my mother had to use all this. Then, the first\npogrom, I-I -- I told you, when -- when the Germans were taking off the jewelry,\nwhatever the -- the women or the men wo-wore, jewelry, rings, 1-1f you didn\u2019t take it off\nby yourself quick enough and they wanted the ring, they would rip it off with your finger.\nAnd -- And if -- And if you didn\u2019t take off your earrings fast enough, they would rip off,\nyou know, the ear or the loop -- or the loop where -- which -- which you were -- with --\nwith that earring. And my mother wasn\u2019t fast enough, so -- so one -- one SS hit her with a\n-- with a rifle -- with the end of the rifle, he hit her so hard over the he -- over the ear, that\nshe fell down. And -- And she was always deaf on this ear. She couldn\u2019t -- My mother\nnever recuperated. And she always used to say, because -- I mean -- and I\u2019m saying I\nthink since -- when she arrived, when I arrived in Cuba, she wanted to tell her sisters\nwhat she went through and they said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it.\u201d She felt very -- like\nvery explosive inside, where she wanted to talk about it, but -- but the sisters said, \u201cDon\u2019t\ntalk about it.\u201d",
        "Q: So she had no one to talk to?",
        "A: Never talked to. But, to me she would -- every -- well, I was the one who was the\nclosest to her and I was with her all the time and she would alway say, \u201cThe world should\nknow, Frima. The world should know.\u201d You know, like this. And we would never talk,\nlike -- there were a lot of questions I wanted to ask my mother, you know, as I grew\nolder, but then I didn\u2019t want to upset her, because I knew how much she was suffering\nwith -- with everything that -- everything that she went through and she -- in her own\nway, she went through a lot.",
        "Q: Is she passed on now?",
        "A: Oh, my mother passed on in -- she died in 1980. No, I\u2019m -- excuse me, that\u2019s my\nmother-in-law died in 1980 and my brother died in 1980. My mother died in 1993.",

        "A: Yeah. He died --",
        "Q: \u201893, she lived a long time.",
        "A: In 1993, she was 87.",
        "Q: Yeah, she lived a long time.",
        "A: And my brother died very young. He was 56. Yeah.",
        "Q: But do you think she had no one to talk to about the Holocaust?",
        "A: Not really, no. Not really. Unfortunately, not really. And you see, in those days, they -\n- they were not interviewing yet, you know, like -- so --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t popular to talk about it.",
        "A: R -- Thank you. Okay, so she really never got a chance to tell her side of the story. But\nshe used to tell me, \u201c\u201cFrima, make sure the world knows. Make sure the world knows.\u201d\nLike she also never went into details, but she, \u201c\u201cMake sure.\u201d Like, in Yiddish, the world\nshould know, -- Voos meels anan ibigigania -- what we went through.

        "Q: So she died to this -- speaking Yiddish?",
        "A: Oh yeah, she died speaking Yiddish, she died speaking Russian. Yeah, she spoke\nRussian and she spoke Yiddish. And she was younger, she spoke Ukrainian, she spoke\nPolish. My mother spoke a lot of languages. My father spoke many languages, too, that\u2019s\nwhy he was an interpreter to the Germans. He spoke about six, seven languages.",

        "Q: This time may be easier, because we\u2019re not going to have to go through all the -- the\nchildhood experience --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- but the -- your experience since that time. One of the things that we\u2019re very\ninterested in 1s, when you dream, what do you dream about? What part of the experience\nkeeps coming back?",
        "A: The different -- you know, different happenings. It\u2019s where -- I'll dream that there\u2019s a\nknock on the door. I-- I?ll dream that s -- you know, s -- the dogs are following me. You\nknow, the German Shepherds. So, it\u2019s really different things. I -- I -- Pll dream that I\u2019m --\nyou know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m walking in the street and -- and -- and, you know, how frightened I\n-- | am. It\u2019s just different -- different things that happen. Of course, with each dream, I get\nup, I\u2019m very upset. Or many times I\u2019Il just wake up, you know, after I have the dream, or\nif I ha -- if I\u2019m screaming or I\u2019m crying or something, I just wake up.",
        "Q: And this 10 days, does that -- since our -- our first interview, did you -- did you wake\nup every night with dreams, or --",
        "A: Well, not every night. I was upset every day. It\u2019s like -- 1-1t\u2019s in front of you all the\ntime, because when I talk about it, I relive those days, that time, you know. So it\u2019s like --\nWell, actually, I live with it every day, even if I don\u2019t talk about it. As I walk the streets,\nif I hear a German Shepherd bark, right away it goes back to what happened to me in the\npast. Something very funny, if I see a-an army officer or someone who wears, you know,\nthe hats that -- that the officer wear, and it\u2019s high up front, they remind me very much of\nthe Gestapo hats, and this upsets me. Then, since we live not too far from the airport -- I\ntold you that last time, many times, I don\u2019t know what, but suddenly there\u2019s that noise,\nand that noise reminds me, after the war, for about one year, maybe a little longer, the\nGermans used to come in like 30 - 40 planes, to bomb the city where I lived. And so, as\nthey were coming, there was the tremendous noise. And at the airport here, I can hear it\ntoo, and I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t understand why this -- you know, why this noise comes\nfrom the airport. And I get very upset, because I open the door and I will look up to the\nsky, like thinking that a plane\u2019s coming in to bomb the city, God forbid. Oh my God,\nthat\u2019s terrible.",
        "Q: Now, what town were you in, the first year after liberation?",
        "A: Well, after liberation, we were, at that time in occupied Romania, okay? Okay? We\nwere in occupied Romania, but then, after the liberation, we went back to the Ukraine\nand this is where we stayed. This is where my home was, once upon a time.",
        "Q: I remember in our first tape, you discussed how your mother never got over the\nHolocaust.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And there seemed to be a sense of incompleteness --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- in you, not -- not being able to talk with your mother about her experiences during\nthe Holocaust. Could you talk a little bit about your relationship with your mother and if\nyou ever were able to discuss the Holocaust with her?",
        "A: No. We were never able to talk about the Holocaust. She would talk about it, and you\nknow, not much. It -- I think what happened is, remember I mentioned to you that when\nwe came to Cuba, after -- after the war, after we left Germany, and we went to Cuba\nbecause my mother had one of her sisters living there. Actually, we were supposed to\ncome into the United States, but because there was a delay and my mother somewheres\nheard that there\u2019s going to be a World War Three, and she became panicky, she wanted\nto get out of Europe. So she wrote to her sister and her sister quickly made out the papers,\nand we came to Cuba. When we came to Cuba, my aunts from the United States, also\ncame to Cuba, to greet 1s when we arrived, which was wonderful, and was a beautiful,\nsunny day. It really was gorgeous. And my mother wanted to tell them about our\nexperience, about her experience and -- and everything that we went through, and all they\nsaid is, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s finished with, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s passe. Now you\u2019re in a\nfree country, you\u2019re with your family, you have nothing to fear, and we don\u2019t tal -- you\ndon\u2019t tal -- you don\u2019t -- you shouldn\u2019t be talking about it because there\u2019s nothing to talk\nabout, finished.\u201d So, I guess, after that, she was sort of, you know, she wouldn\u2019t talk\nabout it much. But occasionally, I would hear her say, remember, you know, \u201cRemember\nFrima, remember?\u201d I do. I do remember very much. So we never really sat and spoke\nabout it. It\u2019s like she remembered her life and I remembered my life. And -- A-And --\nAnd also, I remember distinctly that -- 1-in those days -- I mean, you\u2019re talking about\nwhat, 40 years ago, or 50 years ago? It was something that if we did -- if she said,\n\u201cRemember this?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d I would start crying right away. So, it was\nsomething that you just couldn\u2019t talk about it. Besides, it was always in my mind you\u2019re\nnot supposed to talk about it, because it\u2019s already past. So, we didn\u2019t really discuss it, we\ndidn\u2019t really talk about it.",
        "Q: Why do you think your relatives didn\u2019t want to hear -- was there a deeper reason, or\ndid they have fear?",
        "A: No, I-I-I-I think -- I mean, my aunts were loving, loving aunts, and I had a loving\nfamily. I think they just didn\u2019t want my mother to get upset every time she talks about it.\nCause there was a lot to be upset about. I mean, we lost a big family, including my father,\na grandmother, a -- aunts, uncles, cousins. We lost a lot of people, so I -- I think that this\nmust have been the reason why they said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it. You\u2019re in the free\ncountry now, you understand? It\u2019s finished, it\u2019s gone and you\u2019re safe with us. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nAnd I\u2019m no -- a -- a -- I really don\u2019t know if it would have been better talking about it, or\nwas it better not to talk about it? I don\u2019t know. All I know is, whenever I used to think\nabout it, I would cry. So --",
        "Q: Well, being an objective observer of the situation, and not knowing your aunts, with\nall respect to your family, it sounds like a very selfish decision. A -- A self protect -- that\nthey were protecting themselves from hearing the horrors of what -- of what happened.\nWhat do you think about that?",
        "A: That -- Well, 1-1t, you know, everything is possible. I never really asked them why,\nyou know. But, as I said, because I know that they cared a lot about us, maybe they didn\u2019t\nwant to hear the horrors, and the true of the matter 1s, there were a lot of horrors. I mean,\nfrightening things. It\u2019s just like I was afraid to tell my children when they were little,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want them to think that this is what\u2019s going to happen to them. So, I\ndidn\u2019t tell my children anything. I-In fact, my kids, you know, when you\u2019re used to -- to a\nmother with an accent, they just thought, you know, this is -- it\u2019s normal, and -- and then,\nyou know, later on in life, when they did hear about the Holocaust, and every so often I\nwould tell them a little bit, because I felt that when they were teenagers already, they\nwouldn\u2019t be so afraid. I mean, this 1s just -- unfor -- an unfortunate happening that\nhappened. Happened to the mother, happened to the grandmother, and happened to the ga\n-- to -- to their great-grandmothers. So -- I did, but -- I did, you know, occasionally tell\nthem here and there a little bit, but the -- really, the horrors, the horrors? No, I didn\u2019t tell\nthem.",
        "Q: How did they find out about the Holocaust?",
        "A: Well, you know, as they were growing older, they heard about it, and then I would\noccasionally tell them, \u201cListen, I was in Europe and there was a war and this is what\nhappened,\u201d -- you know, happened here and there, but I didn\u2019t really go into details. You\nknow, really them -- the frightening, the horrible things, I never told them. You know, I\nwas, you know --",
        "Q: What do you think they would learn out of listening to one of the -- the last tape that\nwe made, that --cause you -- I sent you copies, correct?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah, thank you, yes [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What do you think they would --",
        "A: Well, you know, what they learn is that A, you have to learn to respect all kinds of\nnationalities, all kinds of people, and that you really have to keep your eyes open against\ndifferent types of groups, those hate groups, which I think the United States sort of\nignores. We ignore, and we have them right here, in the United States, in this beautiful,\nfree country, we giving everyone freedom, including the terrorist, the criminals. And all\nthese groups, we ignoring them. But little by little, they are just getting bigger and bigger,\nand we don\u2019t know what the future will bring, how they will react. Because that\u2019s how it\nstarted in Germany, with Hitler. He was a nobody, and then he suddenly became a\nsomebody. So, it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s something that I think they would just learn to keep their eyes\nopen and -- and pay more attention to -- to what\u2019s going on around them.",
        "Q: But personally, don\u2019t you think they would be affected, knowing what their mother\nwent through as a child, now that they all have children, correct?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t you think beyond the universal --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that they would be very affected personally?",
        "A: I -- I -- [hope, I hope that they are not, because it\u2019s definitely very difficult to bring up\nchildren, with -- with a frightening feeling, and that\u2019s -- was my feeling. While bringing\nup my children, it\u2019s like I was always afraid, God forbid, it can happen again, it can\nhappen again, something can happen. And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not a healthy situation, that -- that is\nnot. It\u2019s very frightening. Not that I don\u2019t think about it now. I -- I never stop thinking, I\nalways think about it, and it\u2019s always in back of my mind, and now that I have\ngrandchildren, God bless them, all I keep praying 1s, \u201cPlease God, let it never happen\nagain.\u201d Oh, anyplace, unfortunately. But it\u2019s -- You see, what\u2019s happening now in -- in --\nin -- in Serbia, right? In Croatia, or whatever. It\u2019s horrible. It should never happen. But\nit\u2019s nothing compared to Holocaust. See, when people say, because there\u2019s mass murder\nover there, it\u2019s a Holocaust, no. It is completely different. The Holocaust -- The Hitler\ntimes were completely different from any times in history. And what he did to a nation,\nthe Jewish nation, is beyond explanation, beyond comprehension, beyond understanding.\nA-A-A-And where in the world can a human being, so-called, even come with such\nideas, to systematically finish off six million people, besides five million of other kind of\npeople, right? Different nationalities. So -- And the world let him do it. Everyone just sat\nback and, well it\u2019s not our business, right? We are in America, so whatever\u2019s happening\nin Europe, yeah, it\u2019s their -- their problem.",
        "Q: I wanted to kind of draw into a return to your personal life and your feeling about\nchildren, because I know that you\u2019re thinking about doing a book.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: And I\u2019d like to ask you about that. Why do you think you have such a need to do a\nbook?",
        "A: Well, simply because I think that children will be able to learn an awful lot from my\nexperience. Since I was such a little girl and I had a -- I think it was quite an imagination,\nto be able to survive, alone, without a mother, without any family, thinking and always\nbeing a step ahead of my enemy. That, I think, would give the children who will get to\nread the book, you know, the strength, perhaps intelligence too, that hopefully they are\nnever in trouble, but if they are, they can think that they can do certain things to survive,\nand not panic and think, well, you know, there\u2019s nothing they can do. Yes, they can do,\nbecause if they learn, a -- they can remember. And by remembering, you -- you know,\nyou react differently. Like when you don\u2019t know anything, you don\u2019t know. Today I look\nat -- at children five years old, or five and a half, or six, and I say to myself, \u201cOh my God,\nat their age, I already was hiding.\u201d I knew that no one is supposed to know that I am a\nJew. Yet, I knew, that in order to fool others, they should think that I\u2019m not Jewish, I\nwore a big cross, okay? I had to hide and I had no place where to sleep, so the lady that\nthrows me out of her house, I sleep under her house. And she doesn\u2019t even know. See\nhow I was thinking to survive, ha -- what to do. That she\u2019s not supposed to know,\nbecause if she would know, she would -- certainly wouldn\u2019t let me sleep under her house,\nbecause she was afraid. But yet -- But yet, I did it, cause I wanted to live, and I wanted to\nsurvive. I also knew that -- you know, that I should never walk on the same street twice.\nPeople should not suspect that maybe I\u2019m a Jew. And a Jew 1s being killed, so --",
        "Q: This is a little beyond the point, but I -- I still wonder, even after our first interview,\nhow you ate.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: How you fed yourself, and how you kept your clothes to look something less than a\nbum.",
        "A: Well, you know, the clothes that I have -- that I was wearing, wasn\u2019t even mine,\nbecause I don\u2019t know if I told you or I told the museum, is this was when we were taken\nto be killed. And so we were completely undressed, except for the panties -- underwear.\nBut, when we got to the slaughterhouse, where they did the killing, the mass killing, a-\nand my mother spoke to this SS person, asking him if they kill Ukrainians, too. And she\ngave him the whole story, that she was on her way with her two girls, to this town, which\n-- which was not too far from where the killing wa -- was going on, to see her husband,\nwho was in jail. And he believed her, and then he put us inside the slaughterhouse, we\nshould wait until he brings in a translator, a Ukrainian translator. And then, after he told\nthe translator to take us back to the city, we needed clothing, we were naked. So, he took\nmy sister, told my sister to go outside, and they had mountains, hills of clothing, from\neverybody else. And so she picked whatever she thought would fit me, herself and my\nmother. And so, this is what I was wearing, which was a pair of boots, short boots. And I\nhad knee highs, a little sir -- short skirt, a sweater and a little jacket and a scarf. This was\nmy clothing. And I remained with this clothing until the end of the war, which was from\n\u201941, that\u2019s right, okay? \u201941, so when we were -- the second time in the ghetto, of course\nmy mother washed it, you know, and cleaned it, okay? But, after I was on my own, the\nsix months, I never took it off. I slept this way, and I wore it during the day, cause I had\nnothing else to wear. You have -- I had no place to take a shower or a bath. So that\u2019s how\nit was. Unfortunately, 1f you remember I told you, that although I stayed with the lady for\ntwo weeks, I was infested with lice. And that 1s because the only time that I got a bath is\nwhen my mother brought me in two weeks before. So that day, sh -- that evening, she\ngave me a bath. But then, the other two weeks that I stayed with her, she didn\u2019t give me a\nbath. So, I became infested with lice. And so, when she ask me to leave her house, I\nwalked out, and I went to our friend\u2019s, which we used to visit every so often. We bought\nour house from them, and I remembered where my mother u -- my mother, my father,\nwhen we used to go visiting them, and I would walk the same way, they were on the\nother end of the city, I -- you know, I don\u2019t remember exactly how long it took me to\nwalk. But I walked, and I -- you know, I -- I went to her and she realized that I was s -- I\nwas infested. So, in the winter -- it was already in the winter was very, very cold, she\ntook me into her barn, undressed me, took my clothes and hung it outside, so everything\ncan sort of freeze. And she shaved my head, and -- and she gave me a bath and she put\ncream over my head, because I had, you know, rashes. I had blood, abs -- just blood\nalready, dripping down my -- my head, because it was so itchy. And I stayed with her for\na week, and then she said I have to go. So, how did I survive? Well, I used to go every so\noften to our neighbors, Gentile neighbors, cause there were no Jews already, in the city.\nSo I would go to them, and they would give me bread, maybe potato soup, a glass of\nmilk. Sometimes they\u2019Il give me fruits. Now, this kept me going. So, I didn\u2019t go every\nday to them, you know, I couldn\u2019t be seen going to the same place all the time, because\nthen they\u2019Il be always someone who will detect, and feel, you know, that this must be a\nJewish kid. So I -- I -- this was always in my mind, I have to be very, very careful, and I\nwas. So whatever they gave me, I made sure that I just save enough to have until I go\nagain next week, or you know, or two weeks later. So, that\u2019s how | a -- and I -- I -- I\nalways tried to go to different neighbors, and one shouldn\u2019t know if, you know, that I\nwent to this one or that one. That\u2019s how I survived. Oh God.",
        "Q: You mean, you were that young, and they -- they didn\u2019t wonder where -- where you\nstayed? They didn\u2019t ever ask?",
        "A: Never asked, no.",
        "Q: Do you think they knew?",
        "A: Well, they knew that I am somewheres, right, but you see, they just, I imagine, didn\u2019t\nask, because there was nothing they could do about it. They would not ask me to stay\nwith them, because they were also afraid. So, if I came and I just -- could you give me --\nyou know, could you give me something to eat, do you have something? In fact, if I\nremember correctly, I don\u2019t remember even walking in into the house, but rather, staying\noutside in the back and they would bring something out to me. Do you understand? So, 1-\n1-1t was -- [ -- I -- I think it was quite frightening for them, you know, worrisome for them\nto -- to deal with something like this, because you know, they could not completely\nignore me, and they could not completely reject that I -- if I\u2019m asking for food, so they\ngave me the food, which was -- that was very nice. If not for them, where would I be\ngoing to eat? I couldn\u2019t go to strangers. But if you -- I don\u2019t know if I mentioned that last\ntime, one day, it\u2019s been awhile and I had no food, and here I\u2019m walking, you know, on\none of the avenues, and there\u2019s a restaurant and it has a very big window, a glass\nwindow, and people are sitting and eating and I\u2019m so hungry. I -- I imagine -- I -- I -- it\nmust have been I didn\u2019t have enough food, really, left. So I\u2019m standing at that window\nand I\u2019m -- I\u2019m looking in and I see there\u2019s people sitting, there\u2019s one seat available, by\nthe counter. So, I walked in, and I just went over and I sat down. And I\u2019m sitting down\nnext to a gentleman, a -- I don\u2019t know him. A-And the young lady, the waitress, came\nover and asked me what I wanted. Well, you know, I always remember that I\u2019m not\nsupposed to eat things that are not kosher. So, I asked her for potato soup. So, potato\nsoup has nothing, it\u2019s just water and potatoes, and carrots maybe, maybe. And so, she\nwas -- she thought that I was together with this man. So, of course, she served me, she\nbrought me th-the -- the potato soup, and I finished eating it, and she came over and she\nsaid, \u201cYou -- You\u2019re paying? Are you paying?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d\nWhich I didn\u2019t, because the hundred rubles that my mother left me, I -- I bought myself a\ncross, so I can fool everyone. So -- And I started crying. So, the gentleman just took the\nbill from her, and he said nothing. I think he may -- maybe he realized that, you know, or\nmaybe he just thought I was an orphan, or maybe he just thought -- well, he couldn\u2019t\neven know -- he -- he couldn\u2019t really know that I was Jewish, because I had that big\ncross, and I made sure that everybody sees it, okay? And then, I don\u2019t look Jewish either.\nSo, he must have thought, you know, this kid is just an orphan from somewheres,\nwhatever, and -- and he just said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d and I was crying, and I just\nwalked out crying. But at least I had the soup, and I had the potato -- I mean, the potato\nsoup, which was -- I don\u2019t know how long it lasted me, but that\u2019s how I managed. But,\nyou see, so children can learn.",
        "Q: You were six?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: I know today, that if we saw someone who was six or seven walking alone, we would\ngo about them. I\u2019m wondering, were there lots of other orphans around? Were -- Were\nyou the only one, or --",
        "A: Well, I -- I saw myself only walking around. I didn\u2019t see other kids. I mean, you\nknow, maybe they were on different streets, but as -- again, as I told you before, at that\ntime, the city didn\u2019t have already, any Jews, because they had already a second pogrom.\nThat means they finished off the rest of the Jews that they did not kill in \u00b041. See, we had\n-- There was a pogrom in for -- in 41, and then in \u201942, a second one. So, at that time\nalready, maybe there was, you know, hiding here and there, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone, so\n-- that I know or -- or suspect, or anything like that. I mean, I wasn\u2019t in touch with\nanyone. I just live in my own world.",
        "Q: I -- I want to go to the present world for a minute, because before we started, you\nmentioned a movie that you had seen recently.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Id love to hear what you thought, and tell me what movie it was.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, the movie was \u201cLife is Beautiful.\u201d You know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s amazing the way\nthat Mr. what\u2019s his name, th-the actor and director [indecipherable] put it together. He\ntruly was a comedian. I mean, it\u2019s -- yeah, you know, if you take a -- every survivor will\nhave a different story, because there were so many happenings. Now, what he did, was --\nwas truly a -- an exceptional thing, to hide a child in the concentration camp. Now, it is --\nif it\u2019s true, it\u2019s truly an amazing thing, that he was able to pull it off, sort of, you know? I\ndid most of the time, I cried, yeah, mostly.",
        "Q: Did you identify with the man or the boy?",
        "A: The boy, you know, the boy. It\u2019s, you know, hiding him, but -- except you see, the\ndifference between the boy and myself 1s that I was alone. See, he had his father, he had\nthat security, that protection from his father. Although he knew that there is -- that there\nwere dangerous times and he\u2019s in a dangerous place, but yet he had his father there. I had\nno one. I was alone. And I had to think of how to save myself, of how to survive. And I\nthink that -- that\u2019s it\u2019s something. When I think about it now, I-I just don\u2019t understand\nhow I did it.",
        "Q: In -- Any particular scenes in the movie that really touched you the most?",
        "A: You know, the idea is that he\u2019s in concentration camp, and at any minute, somebody\nmight, you know, there\u2019s the -- he\u2019s hiding, and they might kill him. You know, you\nalways want everyone to survive. I wouldn\u2019t want to see anyone killed. I\u2019ve seen already\nenough horror, so even the movie, to me it\u2019s like I was sitting and saying, \u201cOh, I hope he\nsurvives, I hope.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what was coming, but I was hoping, of course, that he\nsurvives, and -- which he did, and I was very happy at that, and at the end he meets the --\nyou know, he finds his mother, and that\u2019s -- that was really very nice. That\u2019s something\nlike my -- my happening, you know? When I saw my mother, that was very nice. And my\nquestion was, \u201cWhy did you leave me?\u201d Y-You know, during that time, I never cried.\nCan imagine? I was alone for six months, and I never cried? And then when I -- when I\nsaw my mother, a --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",

        "A: And so, you know, all this time, I knew I\u2019m not supposed to cry, I\u2019m not supposed to\ncomplain, I\u2019m not supposed to do all these things. And so, when I finally, you know, got\ntogether with my mother, and she sees me wearing the cross, she says, \u201cMy child, what is\nthis?\u201d And I says, \u201cI wanted to live.\u201d And then -- No, she took it off and she gave it to the\npriest of the town. And then I said to her, I\u2019m look at her, I says, \u201cMama, why did you\nleave me?\u201d Well, she explained to me -- I da -- well, when she left me with the lady, she\nsaid to me, \u201cI got to go,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t take you right now, because it\u2019s very\ncold.\u201d And -- And I -- I understood, except I certainly didn\u2019t want my mother to leave\nme. So my excuse was, I says, \u201cMom, I have a headache.\u201d And she said, \u201cThe lady will\ngive you an aspirin, you'll feel better.\u201d And she said, \u201cBut -- But in springtime,\u201d she said,\n\u201cT\u2019Il send someone to pick you up and bring you to me, where I\u2019m going to be.\u201d And that\nwas that, and she walked out.

        "A: Oh, please.",
        "Q: -- would you have done that?",
        "A: No, probably not. But then, those were different times, and as you can see, six years --\nat the age of six years then, is nothing compared today. Not even a 16 year old. \u2019'm\nlooking at our beautiful generation of young Americans. They -- They -- They wouldn\u2019t\neven know how -- what to do. This is why that book is very important, because they are -\n- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a real happening to a six year old girl. When I think about it now, I say I\nmust have been 60 then. To think the way I thought, to plan the way I planned. I-I-I\nmean, remember I told you, one evening -- I used to come back very late, cause I wanted\nto make sure that everyone is asleep in the lady\u2019s house, and ev -- in the neighborhood,\nso nobody sees me crawling into -- you know, to the doghouse. And one evening, the\nwom -- and J all -- it was never earlier than -- than 12 - one o\u2019clock in the morning, cause\nI wanted to make sure that everybody is asleep. And when I got there, I saw how the\nlights were on 1n her house, so, I wouldn\u2019t dare climbing into -- to the doghouse under\nher house. So, the house next to her was bombed out from -- from shells, and I decided to\nsleep then -- there. Now, what happened 1s, 1t was completely bombed out, but there were\nfour half walls, okay? Rubbles inside. I crawl we -- went in there, I lied down. I just, you\nknow, sort of he-held onto myself, and in order to stay warm, I blew the -- my -- my --\nmy -- my breathing. I -- I blew in my air into the sweater that I was wearing, so I can stay\nwarm through the night, cause that was winter. And the winters in Europe are brutal. And\n-- And that\u2019s how I -- you know, of course I didn\u2019t sleep through the night, that\u2019s a\ndifferent story, but that\u2019s how I kept myself warm. I had no blankets, I had nothing. I was\njust lying on the rubbles.",
        "Q: Where would you be during that late supper night? I mean, between six and midnight,\nwhere would you see --",
        "A: Walking the streets. I never stopped walking the streets. Remember, I used to start at\ndawn, when it started -- when it became a little bit light, I would crawl out from under the\nhouse, shake off the -- the hay that -- that the dog was sleeping on, and so I was sleeping\nwith the dog, remember? And I would shake everything off, and put on my scarf, and I --\nI did my praying and I put on the cross, and I walked out nobody should see me, and I\nstarted walking the streets. That\u2019s how I used to do, until 12 - one o\u2019clock in the morning,\nwhen everybody was asleep in the area. I wanted to make sure nobody sees me.",
        "Q: Do you think that, as I see you now, as a very spirited person, do you think that that\nexperience gave you patience, perseverance, daring, planning, any of the above?",
        "A: Well, you know what really gave me strength? And that is I always felt there\u2019s\nsomeone watching over me. I mean, that God is watching over me. And I felt that -- that\nPll be okay. I-I sort of never felt alone. I felt there\u2019s someone watching over me and I\u2019 ll\nbe okay. And so, by praying, that\u2019s how I felt. I pray, somebody listens to me and will\ntake care of me. And -- And this is how I just kept going. And I felt very -- I felt stro -- I\nfelt -- I never thought, you know, that I'll get killed, because I already escaped two\nkillings, so I didn\u2019t think that it can happen to me again. But whether -- I just have to\nmake sure that I\u2019m not caught, and that the six months or seven months -- it\u2019s six months,\nactually, will go by, and soon there\u2019|l be spring, and sa -- my mother said she\u2019ll send\nsomeone to pick me up, and that\u2019s how I felt it will be.

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And the role of prayer in helping you to survive the Holocaust. Well, what about the\nyears after the Holocaust? Do you still pray every day? Do you pray for different things\nnow?",
        "A: Yeah. Not only do I pray for different things, but every Friday night, when I kindle the\nlights, I will stand by them and I will talk to God. I pray for peace on earth, I pray for\npeace in Israel. I pray for -- for health, and I pray for happiness, and I pray for so many\nthings. I just stand there and I pray. But most of all, I do -- I really very much concentrate\non everything that I pray and I\u2019m asking God please this and this and this and that, 1s for\npeace, God, for peace. And I hope we\u2019ll have peace. But right now, there\u2019s so many\nthings going on in the world, where\u2019s the peace? I don\u2019t have peace. I never live in peace.",

        "A: I mean, wherever I hear killings, it bothers me. It just -- It just it -- 1t\u2019s eating me that\n50 years later, the world still didn\u2019t learn anything? Why -- Why are these things\nhappening? I-I mean, there\u2019s no reason for it. But yet, the pe-people are doing it, and the\nrest of the world doesn\u2019t seem to do much about it. So, it doesn\u2019t matter if 1t\u2019s in Uganda,\nthat there is killing, in India there is killing and in -- in Croatia they are killing. I just --\nThese killings just bother me.",
        "Q: That brings up something that the museum is very interested in -- in knowing about\nand I think last time, I remember, you gave so much of your young experience 1n the\ninterview, that by the time we got to the more post-war experience, y-you were very\ntired, and so I want to revisit some of those questions that I meant to ask you then.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And one of the things which I remember upset you very much, was when I ask you\nyour response to Japanese concentration camps. Now, I\u2019m not trying to compare these\nthings to the Holocaust, I\u2019m trying to get your response, and there\u2019s a list here, which I'll\njust let you look, of events that happened in the United States, here, and if you want to\njust choose the ones that you remember especially, and how they affected you.",

        "A: Okay, right, but -- but in those days, and I think today it probably would be the same,\nthere are people who are so devoted to their original question, that although they are in\nthe United States, they might, in some way, you know, react in a terrorist way. So, in\nthose days, these camps, I think the government did the right thing, okay? Now, these\nconcentration camps, you cannot compare to Hitler\u2019s concentration camps.",

Therefore, they were careful to make sure that they don\u2019t get -\n- of course, they don\u2019t know who 1s a terrorist, who isn\u2019t and who has in mind to harm\nthe United States. So they wanted to make sure. And they just -- what they did is, they\ndidn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not a concentration camp the way Europe had, but rather an area where they\nkept all the people that they might, you know, th-that they suspected maybe will do\nsomething harmful.",

        "Q: So, do you remember anything about the Civil Rights movement going on?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I think it was -- it was a good movement. I think that we came a long way. I\nthink it was the right thing. Unfortunately, you know, the minorities had to go through a\nlot. But, they came a long way, and I think this movement was good. The Vietnam war,\nunfortunately, I think was a disaster. And that did bother me a lot. It bothered me because\nthe truth of the matter is, we had no business to be there, especially losing so many of our\nyoung people. S -- Also, the fact that France was there before, and they left it, why did\nwe take it over? It\u2019s none of our business, okay? And -- And -- And the truth of the\nmatter is, to send our boys 1s, if we would have been -- if that country would have\nattacked us, that\u2019s a different story. But here, that was a waste. And let\u2019s see, which other\none of we have here?",
        "Q: Kent State.",
        "A: The Kent State. Well, that was because of the Vietnam war, right? Because these kids\ndidn\u2019t want to stand for it, and I don\u2019t blame them. That -- That war bothered me a lot. It\nstill does to this day, when I go and I see that wall. That is, to me --",
        "Q: Which wall are you discussing?",
        "A: Where they have the Vietnam -- the names of the Vietnam boys.",
        "Q: What upset you about it?",
        "A: Well, the fact that they lost their life, and -- and 1-it\u2019s not protecting their country. It\nwasn\u2019t a war that we were, you know, like -- like -- like the Japanese. The Japanese\nattacked us, so we had to retaliate, okay? We had to defend ourselves. But the Vietnam\nwar had nothing to do with us, really. So, that was an unfortunate move from the\ngovernment, God bless them anyway. Okay, the Feminist movement, it\u2019s okay. The\nassassination of all these big people, yes, bothered me very much. John F. Kennedy,\nEvers, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy. That was very unfortunate, and that was\nsomething that I feel maybe it could have been prevented. I am not sure.",
        "Q: Which thing?",
        "A: Robert Kennedy. He was killed by -- by someone from the Middle East. And I -- I -- I\nthink that what is happening that we feel that we have so much freedom in this country,\nand it\u2019s democracy, we don\u2019t have to worry about terrorists, or killings, but we do. We\nhave a lot of assassins running around this country, and all -- they have freedom also. So,\nunfortunately, we lost some very good people, some beautiful people, and I\u2019m sorry\nabout that.",
        "Q: Who was president when you first came?",
        "A: It was Eisenhower, you\u2019re right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything distinctly different -- of course it was different from Cuba,\nor --",
        "A: Well, you have to realize that I came from Cuba, and in Cuba we had at that time, a --\na dictator, okay? And -- And I really didn\u2019t know much about politics. All I knew is, you\nknow, that -- that, you know, that I have to work and I have to get an education and that\u2019s\nthat. That takes care on that. I -- I really didn\u2019t know much about politics. And life was\nvery nice and very peaceful in Cuba. So I -- I really don\u2019t know much, as to, you know,\nwh-what -- what he did right, or what he did wrong. Reagan\u2019s visit to the gravesites of\nGerman soldiers, that disturbed me, yes, that disturbed me very much. But --",
        "Q: Tell me about that, a little bit.",
        "A: Well, first of all, to give such an honor, that an American president should go to the\nGerman soldiers who were at war, not only, you know with Russia and Poland and the\nUkraine and the other countries, but they were really also at war, sort of, with the United\nStates, and to give them the honor of having an American president, that -- that -- that\ndidn\u2019t makes much sense to me. I [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did -- Did you discuss with other Jewish people how they felt about that, at that time?",
        "A: They all felt the same way. Even not -- E-Even -- Even not the survivors, I mean just\nAmerican, you know, Jewish American people. They -- They were all definitely against\nit. They said that they -- those soldiers do not deserve the respect of the American\npresident. But then, you know, President Roosevelt wasn\u2019t exactly perfect for -- for the\npeople -- for the Jews during World War Two, either. He was a great president for this\nwonderful country, but he didn\u2019t do much for us, remember? I mean, not even when he\nwas told what was going on, and he was asked to bomb the concentration camps, or the --\nthe trains going to the concentration camps, and he said, [inaudible] that\u2019s what he said,\nthey hadn -- didn\u2019t have enough bombs or they can\u2019t do it. I -- I mean, I don\u2019t remember\nexactly, but 1-1-1t was some kind of ridiculous excuse. It just -- thoughtlessness I guess.\nPoor politics, and perhaps not a great feeling for hum-humanity, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s why I was asking you, when your relatives, your aunts, who love you very\nmuch personally, didn\u2019t want you to talk about it, \u2019m wondering if this attitude existed\neven on the part of the government. They know what\u2019s happening, but at the same time,\nthey\u2019re not there.",
        "A: A very good possibility, but I don\u2019t really know.",
        "Q: There was a lot of denial going on.",
        "A: Oh, oh, yes. I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: I\u2019m even told by American Jews.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Yeah, yes, it was.",
        "Q: Have you ever heard anybody talk about that?",
        "A: No, not -- not -- not really. You know, like -- I mean, we all felt that President\nRoosevelt did not do much for -- you know, for the Holocaust. He didn\u2019t do much, he\nsort of ignored it. And well, today I guess they are a little bit different, right? They are\ntrying to prevent killings in different countries today. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019Il be\nsuccessful or not, but with us, they didn\u2019t even let that ship of 900 Jewish -- German\nJews, le -- they -- they wouldn\u2019t let into this country. And then, of course, everybody else\nclosed their doors to that ship and they had to turn that ship back to -- to Germany. Now,\nhey, today, look at it. Today we\u2019ll let everyone in, including prisoners from Cuba,\nincluding terrorists. Everybody is welcome. We don\u2019t check them. With AIDS, without\nAIDS, whatever. So, now maybe, perhaps we\u2019re doing already, too much now, and in\nthose days we did very little, or hardly anything. So, for tha -- for the survivors it is\npainful, yeah.",
        "Q: What kind of --",
        "A: I -- I feel that the world really ignored me.",
        "Q: What kind of job do you think that Clinton is doing right now? Is he too liberal?",
        "A: Regarding?",
        "Q: Is he too liberal? Well, I guess we were discussing immigrants.",
        "A: Well, to a certain extent, I think he might be a little bit liberal. I -- I feel that this\ncountry deserves to have, you know, nice people, good people, responsible people. Not\njust anybody should come into a country like this. And that\u2019s exactly what we are doing.\nLook what\u2019s going on. We have terrorists, we have the neo-Nazis, who have the freedom\nof organizing themselves, training themselves, right here in the United States. Now, does\nit make sense? Do you know, as a survivor, how I feel? That\u2019s why I always am afraid\nwhile bringing up my children, it\u2019s always behind my ba -- in back of my head.",
        "Q: What -- What did you think then, bringing up the subject of neo-Nazis, about\nLittleton, Colorado?",
        "A: Well, well --",
        "Q: Happening on Hitler\u2019s birthday. What -- What did you think when you first saw that\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: You know what ca -- what the first thing y-you start thinking is? That we\u2019re ignoring\nthem. We are giving them the freedom and later on might be too late, we\u2019ll pay a price.",
        "Q: Ignoring who?",
        "A: The group. The neo-Nazis.. And this, after 50 years, or sic -- 55 years, that they still\nadmire a butcher like Hitler. Do you understand? And that is not from the children alone.\nThese children, or these young people, they hear about it in their homes, from their\nparents, okay\u2019? So, obviously, there are still followers. There are still those that feel that\nthe people in this world are not good enough for them. And what do you think wa -- why\nare they training?",
        "Q: What do you mean, training?",
        "A: Well, they\u2019re training how to kill. They have arms, okay? So, what do you think they\nare going to do with those arms? Let\u2019s see in 15 years, 20 -- 15 - 20 years from now, or\nmaybe even earlier. What do you think they\u2019re going to do? It\u2019s not a hobby. They have a\npurpose. It\u2019s just we are not paying that much attention to them, cause we are giving\nthem freedom. And sometimes too much freedom for criminals, you know what happens.\nWe pay, later on, a price. Now, the bombing of -- of -- of the Twin Towers, there\u2019s an\nexample. We\u2019re letting 1n terrorists to this country. We\u2019re giving them freedom, we\u2019re\ngiving them ho -- a home, we giving them everything, and look what we get in return.",
        "Q: But I -- It\u2019s kind of hard to judge who -- who is and who 1s not.",
        "A: For what?",
        "Q: A terrorist. Y-Y-You don\u2019t know until it happens.",
        "A: That 1 -- That -- That is correct, but no, no, no, no, the United States, I\u2019m sure, has\nenough of intelligence to know -- the ones that are terrorists, did things before, maybe in\na different country, not exactly in the United States. So, we are not really checking out\nthe people that are coming into this country, unfortunately, okay?",
        "Q: What about the kids? What about the people who live here, th -- they -- they are\ncitizens --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- there are a lot of citizens, I understand --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm --",
        "Q: -- who are --",
        "A: -- right, right.",
        "Q: -- arming themselves and what -- what could the government do about that?",
        "A: What could the government do about that? Well, first of all, I think we have -- there\u2019s\ntoo much freedom in getting arms in this country. If you have the money, you can get it,\nand that\u2019s number one, so right away, they should stop this, okay? And number two, even\nthe citizens here, the ones that go out to get arms, the government should know what for\nand -- and give them a certain -- even -- and they have to be checked up. I think that those\npeople that apply for arms should be checked out first, and then given a certain period of\n-- and then, you know, you have to keep an eye on certain people also. It\u2019s -- I-It\u2019s not\neasy, but we don\u2019t seem to be doing anything about it. It\u2019s really -- there are -- the arms\nhere are free for all. Any kid, any youngster, any terrorist, any anybody can just go in and\nget -- you know, get a gun or get a rifle or whatever. And, you know, it should be a little\nbit stricter. It\u2019s true, it\u2019s a democratic country, and it\u2019s, I think to me, it\u2019s the most -- the\ngreatest country in the world, but it\u2019s also frightening for me, even though I live ina\ndemocratic, free, beautiful country, why am I always afraid, why am I always worried?\nBecause I see what\u2019s going on and it\u2019s -- shouldn\u2019t be that way. What can the government\ndo? They can do. They just see -- sort of ignore it.",
        "Q: And I wanted to ask you about Israel as a state. You must especially have been aware\nof this.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah, I\u2019ve been aware of all these three wars, yeah. Well, what about\nEichmann? Well, there\u2019s a lot of these butchers that got away and were never caught.\nThey lied to this country and they came into this country and they lived in this country,\nsome of them. Of course, most of them probably died by now. But yet, they live a very\ngood life here, after butchering millions of people, okay? So that\u2019s because our country 1s\nso wonderful, they just let them in and they made up stories, right? And we let them in,\nwe never checked out on them, and that was that. As far as the wars 1n Israel, it\u2019s very sad\nthat a little country like this, with a handful of people, especially in those days, had to\nfight so many armies, from all different fronts, and yet I look at it as a miracle.",
        "Q: What -- What\u2019s the miracle?",
        "A: The miracle that they always beat the -- their neighbors. And they won most of these\nwars, even though -- even that war in -- in \u201973, that Yom Kippur, when they were\nattacked. It turned around and -- but of course, they won the war, but never peace. That\u2019s\ndifferent things and that\u2019s very, very sad. As far as today, I feel that nobody should mix\nin, into their politics and the people of the state of Israel should decide, you know, which\npresident is good for them, prime minister, or what they should do with their neighbors,\nhow to find peace. And there\u2019s no one in this world that wants peace more than they do,\nbecause there isn\u2019t a family that hasn\u2019t lost a child, a husband, an uncle, a -- a -- a sister, a\nbrother. I mean, they are constantly losing people, and really --",
        "Q: Are you discussing Jews in Israel?",
        "A: Huh? Yeah, I\u2019m discussing the -- yeah, and I\u2019m discussing that nobody should force\nthem to do anything, because nobody really knows their situation better than they do\nthemselves. And as long as they don\u2019t ask for help, then the United States should not mix\nin. They should leave them alone and they -- and they shouldn\u2019t be peace -- a land for\npeace, they should be peace for peace. There\u2019s no such thing as land for peace.",
        "Q: As what?",
        "A: Land, land. Like the president says, \u201cGive them -- Give the Arabs more land, and\nthere\u2019ll be peace.\u201d No, no, no, no. It has to be peace for peace. That means the Arabs\nhave to want peace, so there\u2019s going to be peace. You can give them land, no matter how\nmuch land you'll give them. But they obviously don\u2019t want peace [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You think they want war?",
        "A: No, what I think is they want Israel to move out of the Middle East. That\u2019s what I\nthink, because Israel is the only democratic country there. Everybody else is the same\nreligion, the same background. So they just don\u2019t want Israel there. What they don\u2019t\nfremfa -- what they don\u2019t want to remember is that Israel was there since beginning of\ntime, and they\u2019Il remain there. So nobody in this world should mix in and tell the Israeli\ngovernment what to do, but let them and the people decide what to do. And when it\ncomes to peace, nobody wants it more than the Israel -- the Israelis.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go to the next. We\u2019re moving on to tape two.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape two, side A, of a second audio follow up with Frima Laub, conducted by\nGinger Miles, on June third, 1999, for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby\nHerr for making this interview possible.",
        "A: We\u2019ll just add to, you know, the Israel\u2019s situation, as far as peace is concerned. You\nsee, I feel that the Arab countries, if they would only stop teaching the young children in\nschool about Israel being their enemy and the hatred that they have for the Israelis, or the\nJewish people in general, or the state of Israel, I think that there would be peace very\nquickly, because I imagine and I feel that the young people don\u2019t want wars either. But, if\nthey in -- they are taught since they\u2019re very little, that that -- you know, the hostility\ntowards Israel, so how can they grow up wanting peace? How can there be peace if they\nhate their next door neighbor? They don\u2019t want to tolerate a next door neighbor. So, it --\nit bothers me that we are -- that the young generation of the Arab world 1-1s -- is already\ngrowing up with hatred, and -- and -- and -- and hostility against the neighbor. And\nmaybe, hopefully, I would like to see someday that they should change their books, and\nthe way they teach those youngsters.",

        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- differently?",

        "Q: I understand that.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: But do you th -- you -- are you saying that it\u2019s a one way street, and Israel, that -- th-\nthat Jews --",
        "A: Unfortunately, unfortunately, if somebody would like to go to Israel and pick up the\nbooks that the children learn from, okay, and a -- how they\u2019re taught about their next\ndoor neighbor, and then go to the Arab countries, and look at their textbooks, you will\nsee the difference. And --",
        "Q: You\u2019ve seen both of them?",
        "A: I\u2019ve -- People have told me about it, okay? So, there is a difference, and -- and this is\nwhy I feel very strongly, that as long as the children are taught hatred towards another\nnation, they ca -- there can never be peace. Because, you know, that\u2019s -- they grow up\nwith -- always feeling that their next door neighbor is whatever, you know, and I don\u2019t\nwant to deal with him, and -- so, when the president, you know, when President Clinton\nthinks that, give them land, you can give them anything you want. If they hate you, they\nwill hate you no matter what. If they don\u2019t want you there, it doesn\u2019t matter what you\ngive them, unless you give them the whole country, period. And that\u2019s something that -- I\ndon\u2019t see peace in the future, unless there\u2019s a change in politics.",
        "Q: Do you think that -- Let\u2019s say the book that you wrote about your experience, were\ndistributed in Israel. How do you think it would affect children, first of all, Jewish\nchildren?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Do you think they know about the Holocaust?",
        "A: Well, I think they know, and I certainly hope they do, and they should. And I feel that\nwe, in -- in this country, and perhaps all over the world, we waited also a little bit too\nlong, you know, to teach our children, in their schools, about the Holocaust. I really don\u2019t\nknow why it took them so long. Maybe because we were all in denial. I mean, it\u2019s\npossible. Like, I -- I didn\u2019t talk to my children, you know, about it. Maybe this is what all\nthe parents did, they were all afraid, not to scare their children about it. But, I-I think the\nbooks are very important, because I think that now, in the 21* century, I think they heard\nquite a bit about it, and -- and -- and -- and them -- they\u2019re probably going to be a lot of\nbooks, and it\u2019s like every survivor has a story, every survivor could write a book, because\nhis experience were different, his horrors that he went through were different. And the\nchildren can learn from that. I mean, they will learn frightening things, but on the other\nhand they will also learn as to how to -- to survive and -- and -- and how to handle\nsituations and how to try to make this world a better world -- place to live.",
        "Q: But there aren\u2019t that many books, I don\u2019t think, about children in the Holocaust.",
        "A: No, no. There must be some, but not really --",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you about the children that you have worked with in a mental hospital.\nIs that what you currently do?",
        "A: No. I work now in a mental health clinic. Well, you know, the children that come\nthere have different problems. It\u2019s mental health problems and it\u2019s not because of the\nHolocaust. It\u2019s unfortunate, because these children don\u2019t have a father, and some of them\nare in foster homes. I-I-It\u2019s very sad. And they all -- breaks my heart, really. It\u2019s -- It\nbreaks my heart when I see those children, this one\u2019s in a foster home, this one doesn\u2019t\nhave a father, this one is being abused by the father, this one\u2019s being abused by the\nmother. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s just very painful and I really wish that somehow in -- 1n this\nUnited States, the minorities, the ones that -- that don\u2019t have fathers, that they would have\na family life. There\u2019s no family life, and I think this is what affects the children. And you\nsee, they are really lost souls. They are frightened, they are -- they -- they -- they don\u2019t\nknow what to do, they don\u2019t know how to cope with life. So, if they would read my book,\nI think they would get well, to realize that at this station -- you know, at -- at this age, I\nwas able to do things which they never think of doing.",
        "Q: Have you ever thought about, before you write the book, going to schools, and talking\nto them?",
        "A: I never did. And I tell you the reason. Because I would probably start crying. I still\ncry. I-I mean, it\u2019s just I -- I start talking, I\u2019m reliving situations and -- and -- and I know I\njust wouldn\u2019t be a very good speaker. I would just have to stop in the middle and -- and\nthat\u2019s not exactly what a speaker should do. As strong as I was, you know, I\u2019m different,\na little bit different now. I really live in the past a little bit, or a lot.",
        "Q: Thinking about when you say you live in the past. What\u2019s an example of what you\nmean?",
        "A: Well, you see, the past never really left me, or maybe I didn\u2019t leave -- leave the past.\nThat means, everything that -- in my daily living, are constantly memories of what\nhappened. There isn\u2019t a day that goes by where I don\u2019t -- wat -- see something that\nreminds me of what happened to me 50 years ago, 55 years ago. For example, certain\nhomes look like a barn. You know, like they\u2019re very tall and -- and those windows, or\nwhatever. Well, if I pass one of those, that reminds me when I was only five and a half\nand we were hiding in our barn. You know, we were hiding from the Germans. And then,\nyou know what happened. This neighbor of ours would bring us, once a day she would\nbring us food. And then one day somebody must have seen her do it, and they called the -\n- the SS, and they followed her while she was walking, bringing us food, and she started\nyelling to us, \u201cSave yourselves, save yourselves,\u201d and we were, you know, o -- 1-1n -- 1n\nthe attic of the barn, and so my mother and sister, in the back, you know, everything is\nwooden, you know, panels, broke two wooden panels, and we jumped like two stories\ndown and we ran and we escaped. So, when I look at this barn, 1t reminds me as to what\nhappened 55 years ago. If I see a German Shepherd, that really kills me.",
        "Q: How about you --",
        "A: My stomach --",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: -- jumps. Yes?",
        "Q: No, I was just thinking of -- of German, and I just wondered about, have you ever had\nany German friends in America?",
        "A: No. Mm-mm.",
        "Q: Never will?",
        "A: No. In fact, I never will, and when I hear that language, it -- my stomach jumps. I\nsweat. I can\u2019t -- the language, just the language, upsets me so. So no, I don\u2019t think I could\never -- and I\u2019m very broadminded, really, but a-a-and I know that today\u2019s generation had\nabsolutely nothing to do, you know, with the past generation, yet and all, I couldn\u2019t talk\nbecause it would bring back memories. Just by looking and saying, well that person\ncomes from the country that took away my loved ones. So, I\u2019d rather not -- not have any\nconnection.",
        "Q: Not even German Jews?",
        "A: Well, that is a little different, cause the German Jews had nothing to do with the\nHolocaust. Unfortunately, they were so -- they felt so secure in Germany before World\nWar Two, that unfortunate, they were hit just as bad with the Holocaust, as the European\nJew. Same thing happened to them. So, you know, it\u2019s two different things. Talking to\nsomeone whose grandparents we-were involved in -- in my -- in my life, and talking\nabout a German Jew, who went through almost the same as the European Jew. So it\u2019s two\ndifferent things, you know?",
        "Q: Do you, or have you been able to, from the beginning, or at any point in your\nmarriage, been able to talk with your husband about your experience?",
        "A: Mostly he -- Believe it or not, he talks mostly, about his experience. You know, he --\nhe was born in Germany, and -- and at the age of nine, my mother-in-law, you know, in\nthir -- that was in \u201939, she realized that it\u2019s going to -- it -- the situation is very bad, and\nthe sooner they get out of Germany, the better off they are. And my father-in-law was\nalready, at that time in labor camp. So the only -- the only way for my mother-in-law to\nget her husband out of the labor camp, is to get a visa and get out of the country. So, she\nwent through quite a bit, traveling all over the united s -- all over Germany, to try and get\na visa, to get out of the country, and finally they got a visa to go to Shanghai. And so he\nhas quite an experience himself, you know, specially the Kristallnacht. So, he usually\ntalks about it, and I listen.",
        "Q: You lived in Shanghai for how long?",
        "A: Nine years. He lived --",
        "Q: So, he speaks Chinese?",
        "A: No. They -- Because, you see, they were 1n a ghetto. So they used German, they spoke\nGerman. Perhaps they spoke a little Chinese, you know, when they went out to do their\nshopping, you know, in the market.",
        "Q: It was a ghetto set up especially for --",
        "A: Yes, it was a ghetto, just exactly for the German Jews and the European Jews. All the\nJews that -- that came to Shanghai. They all lived in -- in a -- in -- ina ghetto.",
        "Q: What years was he there?",
        "A: From \u00b039 to 47.",
        "Q: I have interviewed a survivor --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- who lived in --",
        "A: Shanghai?",
        "Q: Shanghai, and Kobe, Japan.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So maybe when I meet your husband tonight, we\u2019ll talk about it. But, do you mean,\nwhen you met each other, you knew that he was a survivor, too?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: And did you never discuss what happened to you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Never? Y -- Does he --",
        "A: As I said, occasionally, I will tell him some -- some kind of an experience that\nhappened to me, if it relates to something else. But, no --",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: -- we don\u2019t really -- I don\u2019t really know. Would you believe that? I don\u2019t really know.",
        "Q: I just wonder if the -- the nightmares that happen, after discussing 1t with someone like\nme, who you never knew, might be changed a little bit, if you shared it with your\nimmediate family.",
        "A: You know, I think that maybe the reason why I would -- and actually, when I -- I o-\nonly tell strangers when I\u2019m asked.",
        "Q: Oh, sure, sure.",
        "A: You understand? Yeah. So I think th -- I -- I think that the reason why it\u2019s easier for\nme to talk with a stranger about the Holocaust, 1s because I want the world to know. And\nthe reason, I think, why I do not discuss it with my family, I mean, you know, really\nsitting down and talk about it, although my children did watch the tape, is because A, I\nknow my husband went through his share of experiences, like starvation, you know. So,\nhe went through his own, and I just don\u2019t think he needs any more from my side, do you\nunderstand? Knowing from my side. I-I think maybe that\u2019s the reason.",
        "Q: You\u2019re protecting him?",
        "A: In a certain way, I think so. I think that -- that must be the reason. This 1s why I can sit\nwith you and I can talk and tell you my life, where I just don\u2019t get to do that -- my\nhusband or anybody else in the family.",
        "Q: I mentioned -- I mean, you mentioned that your children wa-watched the tape.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did your husband watch, too?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, were you with your children when they watched?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did they get back to you immediately, or --",
        "A: They said nothing. Isn\u2019t 1t amazing? They do not discuss it.",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s to protect you, or themselves?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. It -- It\u2019s very interesting. You know, I -- I never\nreally asked them, and -- and they never really sit down and -- and say, \u201cWell, how do\nyou feel as to what happened?\u201d Or, you know, \u201cHow do you cope with what happened?\u201d\nI guess they see me that I\u2019m coping with it, and they see me that I\u2019m -- I\u2019m strong, the\nway I was, you know, the way I\u2019m portrayed on the -- on -- on the -- on the tape, you\nknow, so -- in the tape, actually. So, I don\u2019t know. I-It\u2019s -- It\u2019s a good point.",
        "Q: Families in general, I guess, don\u2019t discuss very deep things, often.",
        "A: Probably not. Yes, prob --",
        "Q: Except maybe at funerals, I -- I think sometimes.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s sad. Yeah.",
        "Q: I'm going back a little further, just so we can move on --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- to your time in Paris.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: There were some gaps in the experience. When you talked about being involved, you\nwere helping Moroccan Jewish refugees.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: I wonder how you became involved with the work. Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Well, it -- 1 -- how very simple. I -- I did not go to school, cause we were there\ntemporarily. We really didn\u2019t know how long we are going to stay, so it was a question,\nmaybe a month or two, it wind up to be six months, that\u2019s a different story, but in the\nmeantime, I did not go to school. And my house was always a house where my mother\nalways did for the needy. She always did things for people. So, I guess, to me that was\nvery natural. If I\u2019m not going to school, I have the time to help others. And that\u2019s what\nyou do, you -- you know, they need clothing, you -- you get together clothing from other\npeople, you put it in the valise, and wicl -- and food, you go to bakeries, you -- you\n[indecipherable] need -- in Jewish it\u2019s shnorer, you know that means you -- you get\ntogether s -- food and whatever they need. Just pack it up and you take it to those people\nand you give it to them.",
        "Q: But I got the impression this was an organized --",
        "A: No, it was my own --",
        "Q: -- relief effort.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Your own, you -- the only --",
        "A: My very own thinking, my very own doing.",
        "Q: Do you remember how -- what -- when you saw them needy, or --",
        "A: Oh, I -- Well, first of all, we -- we her -- we heard about those people. That\u2019s how I\ngot to know where they live. I-I don\u2019t exactly remember the area in Paris, but it must\nhave been outside of Paris, because it was like, on a hill. And -- And -- And there was\nmaybe, in that one big room, I don\u2019t know, maybe 30 people, maybe 40 people, a lot of\nthem. And the smell was horrible, because there were no sanitary facilities. And a lot of\nchildren and [indecipherable]. But I did my share. Every week, that\u2019s what I used to do.\nAnd then I used to babysit for, you know, they had young couples, whose wives either\njust gave birth and -- and had no help, so I would go and I\u2019Il help them out, you know. I\nbe like a mother\u2019s helper, free of charge. I never -- I never accept any money. That was\nsomething that we have to do, to help others.",
        "Q: Now, do you -- do you take after your mother in your adult life in America? Have you\nbeen involved in relief efforts, or what kind of things have you been involved 1n?",
        "A: Well, you know, we always involved in the children\u2019s schools. Then we always\ninvolved in organizations that help children all over the world. So, in my own way, you\nknow. Certain organizations you have to raise money. Certain organization, you gi --\nsend in money. Certain organizations a -- are ask you for clothing, you give them\nclothing, you gi -- you know, whatever, you know, whatever you can help out with.",
        "Q: And you mentioned these two organizations as -- as their post-war agencies that\nhelped you somehow. Do you recall how -- how they helped you and when.",
        "A: Oh yes. Sure, of course. Well, the HIAS, in -- in Germany, they used to give us\nclothing. I mean, when we got there, we had nothing, you know, there\u2019s -- was still the\nsame -- the same clothing that we had from -- you know, from -- from the -- the pogroms.\nSo, they would give us clothing, and -- and food. That\u2019s that. I mean, that was very good.\nAnd, you know, we had a school, so we went -- I went to school. They did a lot and so\ndid the Joint. They more or less the s -- on the same level, you know, they each one do\ntheir share. So --",
        "Q: Do you remember being amazed at being helped?",
        "A: Amazed at being helped? Well, I guess I took it for granted that that\u2019s how it\u2019s\nsupposed to be, right? I mean, if I need something, they were there to give it to me, so, as\na child it was appreciated, definitely. It was certainly appreciated, everything, until, you\nknow, when I -- when I became an adult, I first realized how much effort these\norganizations put in, how -- how much of hard work, to get clothing, to get food,\nmedicine, you know, necessary things for people who were in need. Now, of course, I\nappreciate that even more and I understand all the other organizations that are -- you\nknow, trying to do the same for other people all over the world.",
        "Q: It just occurred to me, you have a very convincing aspect to yourself, engaging, that\nyou -- perhaps we\u2019re all born with a particular kind of nature. That little girl, \u2019'm thinking\nabout, that you were. But do you think that the skills, the survival skills you learned\nthere, still are with you today, as far as the way you live your life, the way you --",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: -- help other people get what they want?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Could you tell us about that?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Your adult -- How you think your adult was affected by that little child?",
        "A: Well, my adult life is very much connected to my little girl life, because I don\u2019t think I\nwas ever a little girl, a child. I -- I feel, and as I -- you know, as I grew older, is that\nthings that I did as a six year old, or a five and a half year old girl, was not of a little girl,\nwas of a na -- a grown up person. And that is something that gives me the -- the strength\ntoday, and the understanding of life today, of how to handle it. And I always say, if I was\nable to handle it then, I certainly can handle anything today. So, yeah, my -- the way I\nwas when I was little, during those horrible days, 1s -- is a tremendous sort of backbone.",
        "Q: But you haven\u2019t done any public speaking about it?",
        "A: Nope. No, I told you. I think I\u2019m very weak when it comes to that. See, as strong as I\nam, and I think I\u2019m a very strong person, it\u2019s still something that I would -- you know, I\nfeel I would probably constantly break down and -- and that would show my wi --\nweakness. And maybe -- maybe this is what\u2019s stopping me from -- from speaking, and\nthis is why I -- I really feel that in a book I can really, really express my thoughts, my --\nmy feelings.",
        "Q: Do you keep a journal, or have you written about your feelings?",
        "A: Not so much about my feelings as to, you know, my experience, but not, you know\nthe expression, my feelings, of how you really feel, but whether the story, and not so\nmuch your feelings. This is the only thing that\u2019s left from my father, and as you know, I\nwas six years old when he was killed, and so I\u2019ve been without a father since then. And I\ndidn\u2019t want to leave him, and I begged him he should go with me, but he said, \u201cNo, you\nhave to go with your mother, and Ill come later.\u201d But obviously it was too late. He -- If\nhe tried to escape, he probably was caught by the Germans, by the Gestapo. So, this 1s the\nonly thing that\u2019s left of my father, that\u2019s the tie that he wore on his wedding day. Can you\nimagine how many years this 1s? Look at what --",
        "Q: And your mother kept it?",
        "A: Well, no, no, you see, we -- we found it with some of our pictures by our next door\nneighbors. We didn\u2019t -- We were not able to keep anything. When we left our home, we\ncould only take the necessities. We were not allowed to take anything else. But then\nwhen we left home, neighbors went in and each one helped themselves with whatever\nthere was. And -- And -- And some things they gave us back, so there was some pictures\nand -- and this tie. They gave them back, so I-I want to show you, I ha -- we have a\npicture, on the wall, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Did your mother keep that tie?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, so --",
        "Q: It\u2019s beautifully woven.",
        "A: Yeah, isn\u2019t 1t something? A-And look, you see how worn it is? You know how many\nyears he wore it? I mean, I-I -- I -- It was, let\u2019s see, how many years was it? Were they\nmarried when -- when my brother was over 18, my si -- let\u2019s see, my brother must have\nbeen 18, so they must have been married 20 years. 20 years, and today is -- 20 years was\nin the 40\u2019s, so this is like 70 years old.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "Q: What else do you want to show me?",
        "A: I wanted you to see the -- the wedding pictures, so you\u2019ll see the tie.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: There\u2019s a picture hanging there. Now I have heart palpitations.",
        "Q: Do you really?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you want to stop?",
        "A: No. See --",
        "Q: We\u2019re looking at a picture.",
        "A: Yeah, we are looking at a picture. These were actually two separate pictures. It was\none picture of my mother, and another picture of my father. The picture of my father is\nthe day of their wedding, and the tie that he is wearing at their wedding, on their wedding\nday, is the tie that I am holding in my hand now, which 1s about 70 - 75 years later, that --\nno, that\u2019s how old the tie is, and you can see it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ripped and torn, but it\u2019s still\nsomething to hold onto. And so, what I did is, my mother\u2019s picture was very t-torn and --\nand -- and -- and scratched and everything else, I gave this, the two pictures to a\nphotographer, and he put them together. Now, this picture is later on in life when -- when\nmy mother was already a mother, she had my brother at that time. So, my father looks so\nmuch younger here, because he was, you know, they were young when they got married,\nbut since it\u2019s put together -- but to me, it\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s the only picture that I have of the\ntwo of them, cause all the other pictures were just, you know, lost, or burned or whatever,\nI don\u2019t know whatever happened to them.",
        "Q: Are they both from the same country?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They were both from -- from the Ukraine, and they were both from the\nsame town and my father was terribly handsome, and one of my granddaughters, when I\nlook at her, her eyes, I always see my father. And, as I mentioned before, I-I -- I do carry\na certain, I-I guess anger, cause my father swore to me that when I -- the evening that we\nwere supposed to escape from the ghetto, I wanted him to come with me --\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: See, would you -- would you --",
        "Q: This 1s tape two, side B, Frima Laub continued.",
        "A: You want to put 1t now, or want me to hold it? Would you ever think that someone in\ntheir 60, would still cry, because --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- because my father disappointed me. I wanted him to go with me to escape from the\nghetto, and we could not escape together, I mean, the whole family together, so we really\nhad to separate. So I wanted to --",
        "Q: Why did you have to separate?",
        "A: Because a ghetto is something that is surrounded by barbed wire, with electrical wires\non top, with Germans and German shepherds watching you. And that means, in order to\nescape, if they see too many people, then they suspect that you are planning to do\nsomething, and they\u2019Il kill you on the spot. So, we had to do it, in order to escape, as\nindividually, where they will not suspect or think you might be doing something or trying\nto escape. So, I -- I wanted my father to go with me, and then -- and then my mother\nwould go on her own, then my sister would go on her own, so, you know, they -- they --\nnobody will suspect that we are -- not even the people that we lived with, you know,\nnobody\u2019s supposed to know. But he said, \u201cNo, you go with Mama.\u201d And I said, \u201cBut I\ndon\u2019t want to go, Papa.\u201d And he said, \u201cI swear, we should live to see your brother.\u201d\nCause, as you know, my brother was studying 1n Kiev, he was not with us during the war\ntimes -- war, you know, period. He said, \u201cWe should live to see your brother, I promise I\nwill -- I will escape, I will go. But you go with Mama first, and then I\u2019Il go, after.\u201d Well -\n- And -- And the way we escaped is, my mother and I, we went to a -- a secluded area of\nthe ghetto, and we climbed out from under the -- the barbed wires. I mean, you really --\nwe really had to be very, very low, not to trigger the electrical wiring.",
        "Q: Was there anyone else with you?",
        "A: No. My mother, myself, nobody\u2019s supposed to know that we escaping, don\u2019t you\nundersta --",
        "Q: And your sister, where 1s she?",
        "A: No. She stayed with my father. Then, awhile later, she did the same thing, see?",
        "Q: Alone?",
        "A: Alone, right. Well, she was already at that time, let\u2019s see, she was 16. I was six, she\nwas 16. And then -- then we made up where we going to meet, we were going to meet in\none of our friend\u2019s houses, Gentile -- Gentile friends that we had. And so, my mother and\nI, we got there, and then about an hour later, also, my sister got there. And we sat and\nwaited for my father, and he never showed up. And that was the last time I saw my\nfather, is when I insisted that he should come with me, and he said he ke -- \u201cYou go off\nwith Mama, and [ll -- Pll come later.\u2019 Well, he never made it. And then, after the war,\nyou know, when we came back, we were all asking if somebody saw my father. And\nsome of the neighbors said they saw him walking in the middle of the street with two SS\nmen, and that was that. And -- And -- And nobody ever saw him again.",
        "Q: I want to stay with this moment, being angry with him --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- for that, because it -- if I were writing your story, I could see how you could grow\nup feeling abandoned by your father, but also by your mother, who left you. And I\nwonder if you could even think for a minute. Has this situation repeated itself in your\nadult life?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Could you tell me about it?",
        "A: Well, in my adult life, I -- I always felt that I have to face the world alone, that I\ncannot count on anyone, not even my children. That I must do it on my own. And many\ntimes, I was thinking I have a very good title for my book. Always alone, and a step\nahead of my enemy. But I always -- that\u2019s true, I always feel alone, like I -- I -- I -- I\nalways feel I can\u2019t count on anyone. I don\u2019t have a shoulder to cry on, I must cry alone, I\nmust do things alone, I must build alone, plan alone, everything alone. But I also feel\nthat, because I had to do these things alone when I was little, I certainly can do them\nalone now. That doesn\u2019t mean that it -- I don\u2019t get depressed. I do. But then I get back on\nmy feet again and I just keep going, cause I know just like I knew then, I cannot stop. I\ncannot stop in the middle of the street, I must keep on walking and walking. And you\nknow something else? Today, I cannot stay at home. I get up in the morning, and I can\u2019t\nwait to get out of the house. And I want to work and I\u2019m very busy at work, and I\u2019m very\nhappy at work. It\u2019s very stressful job, but that\u2019s a different story, a-and sometimes it\u2019s\nheartbreaking when you see those children with problems. And then when I leave work, I\ndon\u2019t go home, I\u2019m always busy in the street, doing things. And I always wonder if that is\nthe part of my past, where that\u2019s what I did in the morning. I got up, right? I -- I prayed, I\nshook off the hay, I put my scarf on, my cross on and out I went for the whole day and\nthen came back at night, when everybody was already sleeping. I think that\u2019s part of my\npast. And that\u2019s what I do today, I can\u2019t stay home. Always on the go, always moving,\nlike a Gypsy.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Yeah. And I always said, I always feel alone, and that -- that is -- you know, I just\nnever thought about it until you brought it up right just now. Yeah. Very much a\nconnection with my past.",
        "Q: Even though you\u2019ve chosen, you\u2019ve made the decision, haven\u2019t you, not to share this\nwith your husband?",
        "A: Maybe a -- Maybe I feel that he could never understand. Because, you see, when I was\nalone, I made my own decisions. And -- A-A-And I -- I felt sure about the decisions. See,\n[ -- I never doubt it. I had to do something, I just went ahead and I did it. It -- It\u2019s not that\nI was thinking or shivering, or -- or being afraid. I-I -- I knew one thing, there\u2019s no two\nways about it. This is what I have to do, this is what I have to do. And I told you -- I think\nI told you, that once during the times that I was walking the streets, I walked twice on the\nsame block, and I heard two boys saying to each other, \u201cSh -- Maybe she\u2019s Jewish.\u201d\nMaybe -- Maybe she\u2019s Jewish? I never walked that street again. Now, nobody told me\nthat, I decided. So, in my life now -- if at the age of six, I was able to make decisions and\nthink -- I think it was an intelligent thinking, then I certainly can do it now. So I said,\nalthough sometimes I -- sometimes I feel depressed because I feel I am alone, cause I\ncan\u2019t count on anyone, because I cannot depend on anyone, because I-I -- I can\u2019t lean on\nanyone. When I look back, I did it then, and I say, I can do it now, too. And that\u2019s how I\nkeep going, ooh, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: But you seem like you would be such a good friend and such a good wife and\ncompanion. So, you seem to be able to give it, but maybe receiving is more difficult. Do\nyou think those other people really would like to be giving?",
        "A: lam -- 1am a -- a giver, but again, I -- I am a giver, obviously because I saw my\nmother give, okay? Cause how else did I learn? I mean, from whom, you know? So, I am\na giver and I enjoy giving and I do have lots of love, for everybody. Lots of love for\nhumanity. But, you say receiving? Yes, I would like someone to -- to listen to my life. I\nmean, you know, someone close in my life, to listen to my life. But then it\u2019s just not\nmaterializing, so I just let it go.",
        "Q: You want someone to ask you, like you said --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s easier to talk to a stranger, because --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I come in and I ask you.",
        "A: Ask you, right. So you ask me and I give you -- you know, I can give you --",
        "Q: I imagine your -- your children and your husband have no idea you would like for\nthem to ask you.",
        "A: Maybe they don\u2019t, and maybe they just are busy with their own lives. You know, their\nlives are so busy, with their families and their children, that really, parents come in\nsecondary. And that -- that is -- that is a fact. And my question is, would I want it\ndifferent? I do want that their wives and their children come first. Yeah, it would be nice\nif they would come someday and say, \u201cMa, tell us, you know, what you went through\nwhen you were a little girl. Tell us about your life.\u201d And if they are not doing it, then\nobviously they don\u2019t have the necessity. And if they don\u2019t have the necessity, why would\nI want to add more responsibilities and thoughts than what they have today? Tho, let him\nbe happy, and Ill be happy. But the only problem is, remember I keep saying? I never\nfeel free. I\u2019m always thinking of, I hope nothing happens, I hope nothing happens. And,\nwill it ever go away? I don\u2019t know. Now, I think even more, because I have my\ngrandchildren, and I do want my grandchildren to live in a beautiful world, with peace\nand -- and enjoy, because the world is beautiful, and there are so many beautiful people.\nIt just that there is also a lot not such beautiful people, who might just harm you. And it\u2019s\nalways in back of my mind. So, all I do is, I do a lot of praying. Remember, I told you I\npray for peace on earth, which I think is very important and peace in Israel, and oh --",
        "Q: But personally, we\u2019re -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019re talking about you, personally, right now, do\nyou -- do you ever pray that someone might -- someone close to you, as you say, might --\nmight ask you?",
        "A: Well it would be nice, I would like that very much. Yeah, I would, you see, so if they\nwould ask me, I would tell them. Cause I think they can learn a lot from my -- you know,\nfrom my experience, but on the other hand, maybe -- maybe they would be upset, or\nmaybe it would frighten them. Maybe it\u2019s -- won\u2019t be so good for them, you know, e-\nevery person 1s an individualist, and -- and -- and can take things differently.",
        "Q: Wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if, on the other hand, your -- your companion, your\nhusband, had been all these years wondering, what 1s it that I have not done, that Frima\nwants? What is it? All these years, that he has no idea.",
        "A: No, he probably does not, cause he lives in a different world, he lives in a world of his\nown. So he just doesn\u2019t think that others have necessities, and he\u2019s just, you know, he just\nhas his own world. And sometimes I think we\u2019re in two different worlds, but listen, we\ncan\u2019t have everything, so I don\u2019t expect everything from everybody.",
        "Q: Well, you take care [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s me, right. That\u2019s me, and I take care and I give without expecting\nanything in return. Although s -- I -- it would be nice, it would make me very happy if --\nif there would be such a thing as Frima, here is my shoulder. That would feel very good,\nbecause I never had anyone giving me a shoulder, or -- you know, or being there for me,\nor helping me, you know, to cope. I -- I had to learn on my own, how to do it, so I had a\nlesson. Unfortunately that lesson was when I was a little girl. That\u2019s what I learned.",
        "Q: Well, you know, I think what you\u2019re describing is a -- a feeling that a lot of artists\nhave, of the idea that -- that you want to write, maybe a key to open a door of support for\nyou to write the book.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I think so. I mean, I -- I feel that beside, that this will give me a chance,\nreally, maybe, to get it off my chest, beside I -- I -- I also feel that besides getting it off\nmy chest, is also feeling that I can help others, you understand? I can transmit my\nstrength. I can transmit my knowledge, my experience, so they can be more careful in the\nfuture and nothing should happen to them, you know? Or, if things are bad, they know\nwhat to do, they\u2019 ll -- they\u2019Il just, you know, think, hey, she did it, I can do it. And that\nwould make me happy, knowing that I\u2019m helping other people, especially the younger\npeople, you know, to -- you know, to learn and to get the strength. It\u2019s very important to\nhave strength, and believe. I think prayer is a fantastic thing, it really is. It can really\nmake you very strong, and -- a-and very, you know, knowledgeable. I mean, to do things.\nCause when you feel that -- that somebody is there for you, you can move mountains.",
        "Q: So even though you don\u2019t necessarily feel the reciprocal support from your immediate\ninner circle, do you feel that from a higher being?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Do you -- Do you allow yourself to receive that support?",
        "A: Yup. Well, I -- I don\u2019t mind getting support. It\u2019s good to know that you can lean on\nsomeone. It makes things just a little bit easier. Regardless if that someone can help you\nor not, it -- it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s good to feel you\u2019re sharing something with someone.\nBut again, when I look back to my childhood, I didn\u2019t get much then, so if I don\u2019t get\nmuch now, it\u2019s okay. I can survive, regardless.",
        "Q: But you talk about prayer, prayer is really putting out a petition. What about the part\nof prayer which 1s receiving support of -- a support from a higher being?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Evidently, you can do that?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, because when you believe in what you\u2019re praying, you have to believe,\nfirst of all, you have to believe. If you believe in what you\u2019re praying, then this is where\nyou get strength from, and this 1s where, you know, you are -- you are at peace with\nwhatever you do, because you know -- you feel you did it right.",
        "Q: And have you been a member of survivor organizations or any group of survivors?",
        "A: Well, I -- you know, I always am connected with them. Personally involved, I\u2019m not.\nAgain, I can\u2019t --",
        "Q: Why -- Why can\u2019t you?",
        "A: Because it brings back memories, and when they talk about it, it brings back\nmemories. So I think in my own way, I -- I just cannot cope with the past, you know what\nI\u2019m saying? I live in the past, but yet, I get up -- very upset and so I -- I\u2019m not involved,\nbut I\u2019m connected.",
        "Q: In -- In -- Through your synagogue, or --",
        "A: Well, as I said, I -- In -- When I say connected, whatever they run, you know, for --\nfor the Holocaust, let\u2019s say memorial or Holocaust Remembrance Day or something, I\nmean, we go. That does not mean that I don\u2019t get upse -- I\u2019m not upset for a whole week\nat least, you know, because I went and I listened and I -- and I saw the survivors and I\nlistened to other survivors, it does upset me very much. And so I -- Personally, I am not --\nyou know, not involved personally, just --",
        "Q: Do you feel like then, that you can\u2019t be open to their stories, because it would be too\npainful?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And you know that?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Have you ever felt that people who were not Holocaust survivors, could understand?",
        "A: They can\u2019t. It\u2019s absolutely impossible.",
        "Q: Was there anyone in your family who you could talk with? You never talk much about\nyour sister.",
        "A: We never talk about the Holocaust either. She\u2019s in Israel right now, but we never\nspoke about the Holocaust either.",
        "Q: She lives in Israel?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you, I assume, have visited Israel?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Never?",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: Is the fate of Israel, though, interest -- of interest to you?",
        "A: Very much so.",
        "Q: And how long does your sister live there?",
        "A: Oh, about five, six years. About five or six years.",
        "Q: She moved from [indecipherable]",
        "A: From -- From the United States, yeah.",
        "Q: From near you?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Oh, well, we didn\u2019t live exactly nearby. She used to live in Staten Island,\nthen they moved to Israel.",
        "Q: Did you see her on holidays?",
        "A: Oh, when they were liv -- were -- lived here, yeah sure, we did. But now, you know,\nthings ha --",
        "Q: So you were close in a way?",
        "A: We were -- We could not be very close, because there was a 10 year difference. But\nbesides the 10 years difference 1s also the generation, see? So, when you\u2019re talking 10\nyears, she could never understand her little sister and I could never understand her world,\ncause she lived in a different world, so the two of us really lived in two separate worlds.\nThe only thing that we had in common is the Holocaust. And we never discussed it and\nwe never spoke about it, and that was that.",
        "Q: You know, we are all so different from the inside and the outside. When I see you\npick me up at the train and I see that bright hat with flowers, and you know --",
        "A: Colorful.",
        "Q: -- such a -- a great hostess and stuff. Do you think anyone knows some of the things\nyou\u2019ve shared today, about 1n-inside?",
        "A: Nope.",
        "Q: How you feel?",
        "A: Nope.",
        "Q: How serious you are?",
        "A: Serious in what respect? As -- My feelings?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: Well, you live with a lot of the pain of the past.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. I live with a lot of pain.",
        "Q: Does that not give you --",
        "A: And disappointment, yeah.",
        "Q: -- physical ailments?",
        "A: Well, it probably does, but then, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. We just have to\nkeep on going.",
        "Q: Of all the things that you\u2019ve mentioned to me, it seems that your job is the -- is the\nplace where you feel most that you can reach out --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and understand.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Do you feel your experiences have made you a -- a more -- a person who can\nempathize with the people in pain?",
        "A: With pain? Probably, yeah, probably. I -- I -- I think that, you know, every unfortunate\nexperience can connect you to somebody else, with his pain, cause you\u2019re sharing --\nthere\u2019s a pain, and you can understand, you can sort of feel it, even it\u2019s a different\nexperience, but it\u2019s a painful one. So, that\u2019s correct, yeah. You know, you sound like a\npsychiatrist.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m not [indecipherable] psychiatrist --",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- I mean, well therapist, I mean. I sometimes play therapist for my friends.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you need -- they need that, too.",
        "Q: But I think it\u2019s interesting what makes some of us identify more with people in pain.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, yes we do. But then also, it\u2019s the person\u2019s nature.",
        "Q: It\u2019s also our nature.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s also our nature.",
        "Q: Regardless of whether --",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Some people might go through experiences, and yet not be able to\nconnect themselves to somebody else\u2019s pain, you know what I\u2019m saying? They just feel\ntheirs, that\u2019s it. They don\u2019t feel anybody else\u2019s. But then, other people feel other people\u2019s\npain. Now, I feel very much pain when -- when I hear killings, when innocent people are\nkilled. Even here, somebody is pushed on the tr -- into the tracks. Or this mother with the\nfour boys that are walking on the -- on the -- on the tracks, and these things give me pain,\nand -- and -- and s -- pain, a -- I mean, really pain, physical pain. It\u2019s like as if I would\nknow them or they would be part of me, or belong to me. That\u2019s the pain I get. And it\ntakes me awhile to get them out of my mind, cause I always think about them. And every\ntime I think, I will sigh. And I remember I used to work with a Black girl in my -- in my\njob that I had, and we were working 1n the business -- business office of the Brooklyn\nJewish Hospital, and every time she would hear me sigh -- sigh, and why would I sigh?\nBecause every time if I thought of someone who just got killed, or -- or someone who\njust got stabbed, or someone something happened to, innocent people, that hurts me very\nmuch. I would sigh and she would say, \u201cFrima, you cannot do that, because with every\nsigh, you are aging five years. So think about it,\u201d she said, \u201cbefore you know it, you\u2019ll be\nfull of wrinkles. Stop,\u201d she said, \u201cstop sighing. Think about yourself.\u201d I says, \u201cDll try.\u201d\nWell, I can\u2019t do it. I still sigh. But she -- that\u2019s what she used to tell me, every time, she\nsays, \u201cYou are sighing again? That\u2019s five years older.\u201d",
        "Q: So, most of your friends are not survivors, then?",
        "A: Not most, no, not most. Some. Some are survivors.",
        "Q: And with those you don\u2019t discuss?",
        "A: No, nope. As I said, we don\u2019t really sit down and talk about experiences, but if we\u2019re\ntogether and we\u2019re discussing some kind of a situation in -- so someone will say, \u201cAh,\nwell I did this and this in \u00b041, and I did this and this in \u201942,\u201d and that\u2019s it. Only what\u2019s\npertaining to our conversation, or the situation. That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t really sit and talk\nabout it.",
        "Q: Have you been to the Memorial Museum?",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: I know you have, but did you go with your family?",
        "A: I went with my husband.",
        "Q: Did you all have a discussion after going?",
        "A: Well, usually we were discussing why we would stop and -- and look at certain\npictures, and we would discuss the horrors. And then of course I start crying, so that\u2019s the\nend of the discussion.",
        "Q: And how did he respond when you cried?",
        "A: Nothing. I guess, you know, they feel you have to cry sometimes, if that makes you\nfeel better --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not exactly, doesn\u2019t make me feel better, but I --",
        "Q: No arm on the shoulder?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Maybe he wanted to cry, too.",
        "A: Maybe, but -- but again, that\u2019s probably how -- how people feel. If you are crying, you\nneed that cry, and maybe by crying, you\u2019ll feel better. The mat -- matter of fact is, you\ndon\u2019t feel better, but you can\u2019t help it. It just comes on because it really hits you inside.\nYou are looking at something that -- that you lived with, or similarly, you know, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s a connection, so -- but that\u2019s what it 1s, that\u2019s what it is. So hey, we can\u2019t stop\non -- on ceremonies, we haven\u2019t got the time.",
        "Q: Do you think that if the museum was giving 1 -- a special exhibit on child survivors,\nand you were asked to participate in a group --",
        "A: Yeah, I would go.",
        "Q: You would?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How would that be different?",
        "A: Again, it would be because I feel that I\u2019m giving something that\u2019s important.",

        "Q: Yeah. And I\u2019ve interviewed -- since I met you, I went -- I -- I met you in November,\nand then I went to -- I was in California in January, to visit my uncle, but also\ninterviewed a child survivor.",
        "A: How old was that child? Must have been older. I think I\u2019m one of the youngest\nsurvivors in this world, I think.",
        "Q: Yeah, I think you must be.",
        "A: I think, cause it star -- the war -- World War Two started, by us, when I was five years\nold.",

        "A: So --",
        "Q: -- and very active in Civil Rights, and very -- speaking every week, speaking every\nweek, and I told her I would love for her to meet you and for you to meet her.",
        "A: Yeah, well.",

        "A: Support.",

        "Q: She wasn\u2019t lucky.",
        "A: Well, she survived. That\u2019s what I call lucky.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: Do you understand?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: None of us were lucky lucky.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But we survived, and that is already a little luck, right? So we live with pain for the\nrest of our lives, because we lost an awful lot. We gave a lot of our loved ones away, for\nno reason. Just like that, poof. So --\nEnd of Tape Five Side B\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape three, side A, of a second audio follow up interview with Frima Laub,\nconducted by Ginger Miles, on June third, 1999, for the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible.",
        "A: Yeah, you know, when you mentioned about the -- the lady that -- that lost her mother\nin the concentration camp, I want you to know that all my life, I feel that I was very, very\nlucky I was not in the concentration camps. I mean, as much as my life was difficult and I\nsaw lots of horrors, and -- and went through a lot of hunger, and everything else, but the\nfact that I was not in the concentration camps, I always say I\u2019m lucky, and I really look\nup to those people from concentration camp that -- that survived, which is truly a -- an\nunbelievable miracle. Besides that I think I\u2019m a miracle with me, too. But, yeah --",
        "Q: Well, I -- I get so amazed that people -- 1t was a miracle to get out, but then, to come\nover here, and everyone that I have interviewed has -- is materially secure. And that has\nalways sort of amazed me.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, you know, I say that all these, you know, survivors, we came from ashes,\nand we build a castle. See, we all came with nothing. We had nothing, and we came with\n-- with so much miser-misery, and -- and with so much fright. I\u2019m afraid to start all over\nagain, but yet, we had the strength to do it, and all we were thinking is how to improve\nthe world, how to make things better for our children. And -- And we started building and\nbuilding from nothing, from ashes. So, I wish that other people, you know, who are really\ndown, and -- and -- and don\u2019t have much, they should look to -- look up to the survivors\nand say, look at them. They came from -- from -- really from hell, and look at them. They\nhave a home, they make sure the children go for an education. They -- They live nicely,\nyou know? They -- Their lives are -- I mean, not all are millionaires, but most of them\naccomplished something. And the accomplishment 1s, they don\u2019t -- they -- they don\u2019t\nhave to beg, because they all make a living somehow. And their children are all educated.\nIn fact, I got to tell you this, when I lived in Brooklyn, there were 13 religious families,\nthat\u2019s it. I mean, in that area, 13 religious families, Holocaust survivors, all of us, all 13\nfamilies. Now, out of these 13 Holocaust survivor\u2019s families, many of us never went to\nschool. Of course, I went to school, cause I was the -- you know, I was a baby when I --\nwhen I -- when World War Two started. But, they were already older, so when they came\nto the United States, they didn\u2019t have the time to go to school. They had to make a living,\nthey had to survive here. But out of these 13 Holocaust surviving families, we gave to the\nworld, nine doctors. Nine doctors, that\u2019s without counting lawyers, accountant, engineer,\ndentist. Nine doctors. That means some of the families had two doctors in the families.",
        "Q: What is it about the Jewish culture --",
        "A: Well, well --",
        "Q: -- is it faith, is it intelligence, is it --",
        "A: -- no, it\u2019s the drive A, we -- those that survived, had a drive, plus a little luck, okay?\nSo we survived. Then, once we survive, we always feel that we have to improve, make\nthings better. And so the drive of accomplishment is important. So these parents, even if\nthey -- they did not have an education and they came from concentration camps, but they\ncame here and they started working and saving and working and saving. And so when\nthey had their children, oh, now\u2019s my chance. My children must get an education. And\nthese kids went to -- you know, went through all the schooling and everything else, and\nare professionals. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s the drive, and it\u2019s the fact that we want the world to be a\nbetter place to live. We want to be -- you know, bring pride to the world, and -- an-and I\nwish that, you know, people would look at it and say, if they can do it, I can do it. And\nwithout even going through hell. If these people went through hell and came out from\nashes and build a castle, I can do it, too. I live in a beautiful country, I have a beautiful\njob. All I have to do is a little struggling, a little saving. You know? I mean, all those\nthings go hand in hand. They can do it, too. Especially, I think the young generation\nshould look at it. See? And -- And -- And I want you to know that every family, from the\nHolocaust survivors, they take pride in their ch -- kids, because it\u2019s like a double\naccomplishment. It\u2019s, I didn\u2019t go to school, but look at my child, he\u2019s a professional. That\nmeans they feel like it\u2019s almost as if they did it, too, you know? And they didn\u2019t have the\nopportunity to do it. Ah, you always keep thinking -- ah, when I was young, I wanted to\nbe in -- in the research world.",
        "Q: Yourself?",
        "A: Yeah. But I had no one to support me, so instead, at the age of 13, I was supporting\nmy mother. I went out and I had the full da -- a full time job, and I went to school at\nnight.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, and I went to school at night. That -- I -- It hurts me. That bothers me, that\nnobody in the family said, you know, \u201cWhat would you like to be, and where would you\nlike to go from here?\u201d And I knew I had a very good mind. I -- I was always a very good\nstudent, I was always an A student. And you know, my mother took great pride in me,\nand I really tried, and I wa -- I never disappointed her. And yet, you know, I -- I couldn\u2019t\ncontinue with -- with sa --",
        "Q: How far did you go in school?",
        "A: No, well, no, I -- I -- I finished high school, and -- and then I came to the United\nStates.",
        "Q: Now that\u2019s something I was curious about there. There seemed to be such a almost\nidyllic life in some ways that you described it, in Cuba. I guess, compared to the\nHolocaust, it was, and you were with family. But, can you think back of some underlying\ndissatisfactions that you had in Cuba?",
        "A: Oh well, oh well, there is always underlying dissatisfaction. A lot of it, I think, was\ndue that I was -- I was angry the fact that I couldn\u2019t be what I wanted to be, and that I\nwasn\u2019t -- I was not given the opportunity to be. Like, for example, here -- and today we\nhave all kinds of grants, and -- and -- and you can, you know, get a scholarship. In those\nyears there was no such thing. So, privately, I couldn\u2019t go anyplace, because we didn\u2019t\nhave the money, and my mother was a widow, and we had nothing. And nobody in the\nfamily even thought of -- of saying, well, you know, we\u2019ll get together and perhaps\nsupport you and -- and -- and --",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you now, Frima.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s say that you got a scholarship --",
        "A: Oh, I would love to.",
        "Q: -- for next semester.",
        "A: I would run.",
        "Q: What would you study?",
        "A: Yeah, I would love to be in the -- in the --",
        "Q: College?",
        "A: No, I would love to be in research. I still like to be in research.",
        "Q: What kind of research?",
        "A: See, I would love to find out something that can save human beings. Like cancer, like\ndiabetes. I cou -- Any, anything, but mostly I think it would be diabetes and cancer. I\nthink these are two dreadful diseases, which really need a lot of research. And I would\nreally sit 24 hours a day, for that. And I think I would -- I would -- I would probably find\npeace in it.",
        "Q: What would happen if you decided to take your money now and go to school?",
        "A: Oh well, now. Now, maybe my husband would think I\u2019m nuts. He would really take\nme to a psychiatrist, and say, at this stage in your life -- but I-I don\u2019t feel my age. And I\nfeel I -- I have a lot of common sense. And I -- I am always willing to try things and I am\nalways willing to -- to discover things and look for things. It amazes me, I mean, how\nmuch we can find, if we look.",
        "Q: How about even just a class in something, like even if you took a class to start writing\nyour book, with this in mind?",
        "A: Oh, there is such a thing? I-I never looked --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- into that. Yeah? In writing there is such a thing? Because we do have in -- in this\narea, we have adult education, or continued education, whatever you call it. Well, every\nso often I do take, you know, different types of courses, nothing -- nothing, you know,\nconstructive, really. It\u2019s just pleasure, something that just is good for my mind. But, PI\nlook into it.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if Pll ever become a writer, listen, I\u2019m counting on you.",
        "Q: Well --",
        "A: I can give you the material.",
        "Q: I will help in any way I can.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "Q: I -- I would wish you great success.",
        "A: Thank you, I know.",
        "Q: And I --",
        "A: I know.",
        "Q: I wondered if there\u2019s anything else that you -- you had to say. I know that you shared\nwith me earlier that you\u2019ve been diagnosed with diabetes. Is that a new thing?",
        "A: Yeah, two years ago, yeah. And yet, I don\u2019t know of anyone in my family having it.\nAt least, my mother. Or maybe my father had it and he didn\u2019t know and I didn\u2019t know.\nAnd so -- And I was never overweight, so when this hit me, I didn\u2019t believe it. When the\ndoctor told me I had diabetes, I did not believe him, I said, it must be somebody else\u2019s\nblood results, not mine. And then, of course, you know, he took another blood test and\nthe results were --",
        "Q: And you -- do you take insulin, and --",
        "A: Not sh -- Well, right now, I\u2019m going to one of the biggest I -- I -- I am told, one of the\nfinest clinics, it\u2019s called Joslin Diab-Diabetes Clinic, in Manhattan -- Diabetes C-Center,\nactually. It\u2019s supposed to be one of the best in the United States, or perhaps in the world.\nWell, they\u2019re trying different types of medication, so every two weeks I'm on a different\ntype of medication. It\u2019s -- So far, it hasn\u2019t worked. The doctor told me there\u2019s another\nmedication that just came out on -- on the mar -- in -- you know, in the market, maybe\nwe'll try that. But, as you know, I have a tremendous drive in my life. I\u2019m very -- you\nknow, my mind 1s just, you have to keep going and you\u2019 ll be okay, just hang in there.\nAnd I\u2019m hanging in there. And hopefully, perhaps they\u2019Il be able to, you know, find a\nmedication for me, and if not, well, if that what it takes, I'll take the insulin. As long --",
        "Q: But you haven\u2019t started that yet?",
        "A: No, no. We just sort of tested it for two weeks. It didn\u2019t do much. It just didn\u2019t do\nmuch for me. But again, you know, sometimes you have to increase the dose.",
        "Q: And you watch your eating?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, but it has nothing to do with my eating.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Look at this, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m lil -- you know, I\u2019m so skinny, I lost so much weight.",
        "Q: No, but I mean, my aunt had diabetes and she -- she -- she couldn\u2019t eat sugar.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh of cour -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s passe. You don\u2019t eat -- I don\u2019t eat sugar.",
        "Q: So when you offer me a cake, you\u2019re not thinking of eating it yourself?",
        "A: No, never touch it.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: I don\u2019t touch it. I don\u2019t touch anything that has sugar, although most of the things\nhave a little bit.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay? So that you cannot help, but like cake is out of the question and anything that\u2019s\nsweet.",
        "Q: No wine.",
        "A: Don\u2019t drink wine, I don\u2019t eat watermelon, I don\u2019t eat a lot of fruits that have -- that are\nsugar. I don\u2019t touch, well, any of this junk food that might have -- or any junk food, you\nknow, I\u2019m very careful [indecipherable] I -- I -- I can\u2019t really eat junk food, because right\nnow my -- my glucose is out of control, really, so I\u2019m trying to be extremely careful. I\u2019m\ntrying to eat as much protein as I can. But then, I have high cholesterol, so that protein 1s\nnot very good for the high cholesterol. But, you know what? Okay, and I also have high\nblood pressure, so I have the three highs. I am flying high. But, nothing stops me. I feel\nokay, and I just do what I have to do. I continue with my life. Yeah, I feel that I-I have to\ndo a lot of things, because time is going by very fast. And I feel like, you know, I got to\naccomplish more, more, more than what I\u2019ve accomplished until now. Cause it\u2019s like,\nyou know, 60 plus. I\u2019m almost there, and then --",
        "Q: Almost where?",
        "A: Well, almost you know, anything can happen some -- to someone that\u2019s in the 60\u2019s, or\nit could happen in the 70\u2019s, or could happen in the 80\u2019s. But I feel that I should\naccomplish more right now, while -- you know, while I still -- my mind is sharp and w --\nI\u2019m -- I still have my feelings and my marbles and my determination and my explanation,\nmy devotion. All this I would like to put on paper. How about that?",
        "Q: That sounds wonderful.",
        "A: That sounds good to you, right?",
        "Q: A great idea to me.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. So, okay, you know, survivors survive.",
        "Q: Say that again.",
        "A: Yeah. Survivors will always survive. You know that.",

        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Frima Laub, conducted by Ginger Miles, on November 23rd,\n1998, in Woodmere, Long Island. This 1s a follow up interview to a United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum videotaped interview, conducted with Frima Laub on May\nseventh, 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges\nJeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This is tape one, side A. This 1s a\nbrief ambiance in the home of Frima Laub. This 1s a few seconds of silence in Frima\nLaub\u2019s home. There 1s, in the background, all sorts of, I guess wind blowers. They are --\nIt\u2019s a beautiful fall day and neighbors are taking the opportunity to clean off the leaves.\nSo, we are starting, along with the lawn material, which we will forget about. I wanted to\nask you first, Frima, if you could give me your full name as a child and the name of each\nof your immediate family members and just a little bit about them. Maybe where you all\nwere at first.",
        "Q: A little bit about where you lived before the war and what he did and --",
        "Q: In the Ukraine?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: We-We\u2019ll -- We\u2019ll return later to your relationship with your -- your family members,\nbut first, I wanted to ask you some of the things, just to clear up from the 1990 interview\nthat was done at the Holocaust Museum. Did you have any idea of what year it was, or\nhow old you were when you first stayed alone with the Gentile woman?",
        "Q: And I had a question -- two questions, actually, the first one being, do you know -- do\nyou understand now and did you understand then, why your mother left you alone?",
        "Q: Now, the part two of the question that I wanted to ask that I would -- while I was\nwatching the video, that I wondered -- now, to step way back into the -- well, way up into\nthe future from that moment, did you ever discuss this with your mother, about leaving?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And your sister was much older than you?",
        "Q: And speaking of the reunion with your mother and your sister. Where -- In the\ninterview -- we are not quite clear from the video interview, what were the conditions,\nwhere did you live, did you work?",
        "Q: A Jewish mother and --",
        "Q: How often did you get bread?",
        "Q: Do you remember what -- what -- what they did?",
        "Q: What your mother and sister did?",
        "Q: But you were not in hiding at this time?",
        "Q: Was he -- What would have been his motivation, was -- was it political, was it -- was\nit a spiritual motivation? Was it circumstantial?",
        "Q: That sort of reminds me a -- a little bit of what I\u2019m reading about the -- the slaves in\nAmerica and how there were certain homes, when they were on their way from the south\nto the north --",
        "Q: -- where they stayed, I wondered, just jumping way into the future, did you have a --\nmake a connection with the Civil Rights movement at all, or the story of slavery in\nAmerica?",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how your mother found him?",
        "Q: Now, from there I would love to -- whoa.",
        "Q: Oh. From LaGuardia?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Wa -- That\u2019s interesting that that plane would give us a cue, cause what -- one thing I -\n- | know we want to know about, 1s at the exact time of liberation, because you briefly\nmentioned it in the video interview and later you say that you never really felt liberated.",
        "Q: And I wondered, for a moment, if we might focus on your experience of the -- the\nexact moment of liberation are -- are -- and then the few days after that, from a child\u2019s --\nhow old were you?",
        "Q: Did -- The first few days after being liberated, did your life change at all? Did you\ncontinue to be in the -- living in the same place?",
        "Q: Before we go too much further, there was one more question which I thought was\nvery interesting and that was, it -- it seemed to me when I -- when I listen to you now and\nwhen I heard your video, considering your age, that your recollection, your ability to\nrecall is very, very clear and good and I wondered if -- if your mother ever helped you\nreconstruct the events that happened during wartime, or have you always remembered\nclearly, what happened?",
        "Q: Flashback?",
        "Q: How old would you have been then?",
        "Q: Okay. I think I better go to side two, because I have a feeling we\u2019re going to have a\nlong story coming in liberation. So, we\u2019re now moving from tape one, side A, to side B.",
        "Q: All right, this is tape one of the interview with Frima Laub, side B. And you were\nsaying?",
        "Q: No, I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Your name was Olga?",
        "Q: What was your last name?",

        "Q: -- and then -- or however --",
        "Q: -- and then, do you remember how you traveled and what -- how you felt when you\narrived in your next destination?",
        "Q: By train?",
        "Q: Now tell me about how long was it and about his -- his coming home. You must really\nrecall that.",
        "Q: Was this a school of Jewish and Gentile children?",
        "Q: Did you feel prejudice there?",
        "Q: Okay, we -- we cannot change the neighbors activities, so we\u2019re going to move on.\nAnd I wanted to ask Frima, how long were you there, in your home, and what was it that\nmade you move on?",
        "Q: So, how long did that take?",
        "Q: And you were how old when you were --",
        "Q: Now, I want you to hold this -- this thought, is if we\u2019re trying to see where you were\nbefore. Those places where you were, you mentioned, but I\u2019d like to go into a little more\ndetail --",
        "Q: -- about anything you recall, especially in Paris, and --",

        "Q: And there seemed to be a sense of incompleteness --",
        "Q: -- in you, not -- not being able to talk with your mother about her experiences during\nthe Holocaust. Could you talk a little bit about your relationship with your mother and if\nyou ever were able to discuss the Holocaust with her?",
        "Q: Why do you think your relatives didn\u2019t want to hear -- was there a deeper reason, or\ndid they have fear?",
        "Q: Well, being an objective observer of the situation, and not knowing your aunts, with\nall respect to your family, it sounds like a very selfish decision. A -- A self protect -- that\nthey were protecting themselves from hearing the horrors of what -- of what happened.\nWhat do you think about that?",
        "Q: How did they find out about the Holocaust?",
        "Q: What do you think they would learn out of listening to one of the -- the last tape that\nwe made, that --cause you -- I sent you copies, correct?",
        "Q: What do you think they would --",
        "Q: But personally, don\u2019t you think they would be affected, knowing what their mother\nwent through as a child, now that they all have children, correct?",

        "Q: -- that they would be very affected personally?",
        "Q: I wanted to kind of draw into a return to your personal life and your feeling about\nchildren, because I know that you\u2019re thinking about doing a book.",
        "Q: And I\u2019d like to ask you about that. Why do you think you have such a need to do a\nbook?",
        "Q: This is a little beyond the point, but I -- I still wonder, even after our first interview,\nhow you ate.",
        "Q: How you fed yourself, and how you kept your clothes to look something less than a\nbum.",
        "Q: You mean, you were that young, and they -- they didn\u2019t wonder where -- where you\nstayed? They didn\u2019t ever ask?",
        "Q: Do you think they knew?",
        "Q: You were six?",
        "Q: I know today, that if we saw someone who was six or seven walking alone, we would\ngo about them. I\u2019m wondering, were there lots of other orphans around? Were -- Were\nyou the only one, or --",
        "Q: I -- I want to go to the present world for a minute, because before we started, you\nmentioned a movie that you had seen recently.",

        "Q: -- I think I -- we -- we discussed your being a -- a religious Jew.",
        "Q: And the role of prayer in helping you to survive the Holocaust. Well, what about the\nyears after the Holocaust? Do you still pray every day? Do you pray for different things\nnow?",
        "Q: What part of the world disturbs you right now?",
        "Q: What struggle, specifically?",
        "Q: That brings up something that the museum is very interested in -- in knowing about\nand I think last time, I remember, you gave so much of your young experience 1n the\ninterview, that by the time we got to the more post-war experience, y-you were very\ntired, and so I want to revisit some of those questions that I meant to ask you then.",
        "Q: And one of the things which I remember upset you very much, was when I ask you\nyour response to Japanese concentration camps. Now, I\u2019m not trying to compare these\nthings to the Holocaust, I\u2019m trying to get your response, and there\u2019s a list here, which I'll\njust let you look, of events that happened in the United States, here, and if you want to\njust choose the ones that you remember especially, and how they affected you.",

        "Q: -- affected you around other big, political issues.",
        "Q: Because not everyone felt that way.",
        "Q: A lot of people felt that they were being imprisoned, just because of their race.",

        "Q: Tell me about that, a little bit.",
        "Q: Did -- Did you discuss with other Jewish people how they felt about that, at that time?",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s why I was asking you, when your relatives, your aunts, who love you very\nmuch personally, didn\u2019t want you to talk about it, \u2019m wondering if this attitude existed\neven on the part of the government. They know what\u2019s happening, but at the same time,\nthey\u2019re not there.",
        "Q: There was a lot of denial going on.",

        "Q: Do you -- Do you allow yourself to receive that support?",

        "Answer: When you say at first, at first before World War Two, or during World War\nTwo? Okay, my name 1s Frima. Maiden name was Glaser. We used Glaser-Better, B-e-t-\nt-e-r. My mother\u2019s name is Eta, my father\u2019s name was Mayer, M-a-y-e-r. My brother\u2019s\nname is David, my sister\u2019s name is Jeannie. You said you wanted to know more about --",
        "A: Okay. Mm-hm. Okay, before the war, we live in a very lovely city, by the name of\nVolachisk -- I\u2019m sorry, not Volachisk, Proscurov, which is near Volachisk and\nPotvolachisk, where the rest of my relatives were born. Some were born in Volachisk,\nsome were born in Potvolachisk. But, we moved when I was still a little girl. We moved\nto Proscurov, which is a larger city.",
        "A: And it was in the Ukraine, right and that\u2019s not too far from Kiev. Okay? We had the\nhome there, of course. My mother was a housewife, my father was in the import and\nexport -- actually mostly export, meat export business. My brother was studying in Kiev,\nin the engineering school and my sister was going to school in Proscurov.",
        "A: We did --",
        "A: Yes, that was in 1942, after the second pogrom in Proscurov. This is where -- My\nmother felt that she had to leave the city, of course, with my sister -- at that time, we\ndidn\u2019t know where m -- our father was. And my brother, of course, we didn\u2019t know\nwhere he was, since he was in Kiev, since before the war -- the war started. So, that was\nafter the second pogrom, when my mother felt everybody was killed in the city and she\nhad to run away because they were searching for remaining Jews. So, that\u2019s when she left\nme with that Gentile lady. So, I was six years old, little bit over six, yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s such a interesting question. Did I understand? I -- Obviously, I must have\nunderstood something when she said, \u201cYou have to stay here. I must leave with your\nsister. But,\u201d she said, \u201cin the spring, someone will come to get you and bring you to me,\nwherever I\u2019m going to be.\u201d A-And as much as I didn\u2019t like the thought that my mother\nwas leaving, a-and I was, you know, I was crying and my excuse was, \u201cMama,\u201d I says,\n\u201cbut I have a headache.\u201d Cause I felt, maybe if I tell her I have a headache, she will stay.\nAnd she said to me, she said, \u201cThe lady will give you an aspirin, and you'll feel better.\nAnd here.\u201d She gave me a hundred rubles, she says, \u201cIn case you want to buy yourself\nsomething and you need money.\u201d So she gave me the hundred rubles and she kissed me\ngoodbye, she walked out. Now -- She walked out, I -- I guess there was something that I\nmust have understood when she said, \u201cI must go, and I can\u2019t take you along,\u201d she says,\n\u201cbecause it is too cold outside.\u201d\u2019 And -- And 1-in Europe, the winters are extremely cold.\nYou can really freeze. And -- And I had very little clothing, because that clothing wasn\u2019t\neven mine, it was the clothing that belonged to somebody else from the first pogrom yet.\nSo, I guess, in the way, I understood that it\u2019s cold outside and I might get sick or freeze\nand my mother said she must leave and I knew one thing, that, as a Jew, we had to\nescape. So, that was my understanding, and I didn\u2019t make a scene. I just said, \u201cMy head\nhurts.\u201d That\u2019s all.",
        "A: Interesting. No.",
        "A: Never discussed it and I never, ever felt any resentment. As the years went by, I guess\nsomebody would say, \u201cOh, Ma, you left me.\u201d or \u201cYou abandoned me.\u201d I never felt that\nway. And I just never discussed it with her and I -- but I did asked her, when we were\nreunited and she held me on her lap -- see, now I remem -- I remember, and my first\nquestion was, \u201cMama, why did you leave me?\u201d That I did, yeah. And she just explained\nto me again what she said, \u201cI had to leave, 1t was too cold and I was afraid if I take you,\nyou might freeze to death.\u201d\u2019 Cause even the clothe -- my clothing consisted of knee-highs\nand a pair of short boots. A little skirt, a sweater and a little jacket with a scarf, that\u2019s it.",

        "A: W-We lived in this very, very small town, it was occupied Romania and I understand\nthis was still part of the Ukraine, but it was next to Romania and they call it occupied\nRomania. Mostly, there was a handful of Gentile people with a few homes, and -- a-and\nfarms -- fields, they had a lot of fields. And this handful of Jewish people lived with the\nGentile families, like we did. We lived with this Gentile gentleman. We were two\nfamilies in one of his rooms, because that\u2019s all he had 1s one room. And -- And he slept\non top of the brick oven and we had -- yeah, our life wasn\u2019t that simple. There was no\nbathrooms, either. If you had to go to the bathroom, you had to go out in the fields. Those\ndays, things were not the way they are today. And so there was one bed, on -- on that bed\nthere was a mother and a daughter whose fingers were a bit froze -- yeah, frozen from --\nfrom the cold -- yeah, from the cold weather. They were trying to hide and wherever they\nhid, they obviously were not dressed properly.",
        "A: Yeah, a Jewish mother and a Jew -- and her daughter. So, they slept on one -- it wasn\u2019t\nreally a bed, it was one of those four legs and -- a-a-and -- and some hay on it, I mean,\nthat was the bed. And we had another bed, which was a little bit bigger, because my\nmother, myself, my sister and then later on, a cousin of ours joined us, too. So we all\nslept on the same bed and instead of sleeping horizontally, we slept diagonally. And if\nthere wasn\u2019t enough room, so one of us will sleep on the floor. A-And that was o-our\nquarters. Now, what we did is -- is -- we had no money to pay for our -- our rent. So, we\nworked for this gentleman. Of course, we were very grateful, the fact that he even gave\nus a place where to sleep -- where to sleep. So, we worked on his -- on his fields and I\nwas one of his workers, and my job was to -- with my fingers, I would have to dig out the\npotatoes from -- you know, from under the earth. And I cleaned them up, put them in a\nsack and tied the sack and then, you know, just so -- drag it to his warehouse, which I\ndon\u2019t know how many blocks it was exactly, I never counted it. To me, it was just part of\nmy life. And for that, he would give me a loaf of black bread. So, we didn\u2019t have to pay\nfor the rent and he gave me a loaf of bread and that was a tremendous salary.",
        "A: Well, every day. I wor -- I worked every day. And so did, of course, my sister and my\nmother and my cousin. We all worked for him. Well, they -- they worked in different\nparts of the field and I worked, you know, digging up the potatoes with my hands, my\nbare hands, yeah.",
        "A: What -- I\u2019m sorry?",
        "A: Oh, they were also working on the fields. Well, they must have -- they -- may -- may -\n- maybe they did different, you know, diggings, different, whatchamacallit, vegetables,\nyou know, also it was -- everything was digging up, you know, because like he did the\nseeding and then, you know, y -- and you would have to -- in the springtime, that\u2019s what\nyou did. In springtime, everything was growing and you had to rip it off of, or rip it out\nof the ground and bring it into his warehouse. So we were all just working on the fields.",
        "A: No. At that time, 1t was not a question of hiding, because there was no ghetto, this was\nnot a ghetto. You wo -- just would have to be very careful 1f sometimes a German would\npass by 1n the street, you understand? Or -- Or someone, some other Gentile would know\nthat you were Jewish, he might just go to the German and tell them, you know, in this\nhouse, they have Jews. So, actually, we were hiding out and nobody was supposed to\nknow that we are Jews, except for the person with whom we lived, he knew that we were\nJewish. So, that\u2019s how it worked.",
        "A: To say -- Do you mean to hol -- to hide out Jews? Well, there were some good people\nand he must have been one of those people wh-wh -- who felt sorry for a mother and her\nchildren and he also felt, you know, that we\u2019ll be devoted and loyal. We\u2019ll -- We\u2019ll work\nfor him, we\u2019ll help him out, because after all, he was all alone. And at the same time, he\nwas, you know, saving lives. And that\u2019s -- That was really something very, very amazing\nand very important to us.",
        "A: Took them in.",
        "A: You mean, at the present time, connecting their past and my past? Well, you know, in\nthose years, 1n my -- my times -- you\u2019re talking 55 years ago, there was no such thing as\nCivil Rights, there wa-was only such a thing as good people versing not such good\npeople. And he was one of those top people, who -- all he knew was perhaps for --\nbecause of his belief, that God said, you know, you should help others and that\u2019s what he\nwas doing. And the mere fact that he took us in, he must have been very special and --\nand -- and obviously a believer too, in saving lives. So, you know, things were different\nthen, as they are today, or --",
        "A: No, but Iam sure my mother was something very special. She was someone who was\nalways ahead of everyone. And I imagine she just found out abis -- about this gentleman\nthat, you know, lived alone and she must have approached him and -- and offered, you\nknow, our services and he accepted them. So we are very lucky.",
        "A: That\u2019s the airport. We\u2019re not that far from the airport.",
        "A: You see -- no, JFK. You hear that noise?",
        "A: Every time -- This is not too bad, but every time, could be in the morning, could be\nduring the day, could be in the evening, suddenly there will be a tr-tremendous noise\ncoming from the airport and I think it\u2019s from the airport, from that direction, and that will\nbring horrible memories to me and I sometimes just shake and I can\u2019t do anything until\nthis noise stops. That reminds me, after the liberation, when we came back to Proscurov,\nto our home, every night for a whole year, until \u201845, the German planes, 30 or 40 of them\nwould come over every night and bombard the city. And so, we would hear that noise, f-\nfrom those planes approaching us and then, of course, either we -- if we had enough time,\nwe would run to shelters and if we didn\u2019t, we would just lie on the floors and -- and our\nho -- our glass, you know the windows would be open and we would have tapes on them,\nthat th-the -- the glass should not shatter and we would lie under our beds until they\nfinished bombarding and they left. This is how I lived.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I was, at that time, eight. Eight years old, that was in 1944. And, actually the Russians\nliberated us, okay, the Russian army. And there was -- it was really horrible, because for\na day and night, there was door to door fighting between the Russian soldiers and -- and\nthe Germans. And, course the following day, when -- when we realized that we were free,\nthat -- I ran into the house -- to that -- to our room, where that lady with her daughter\nwere and these poor people, you know, their fingers were all frostbitten and well, while\nthey were there, I used to go in the fields and look for a special leaf. There was a special\nleaf which, when you would put to the infected area, that at least alleviated their pain.\nCause, you see, we could not get to a doctor and we were not allowed to go to a hospital\nand nobody was supposed to know that we were Jews. So, we couldn\u2019t call for help to\nhelp that mother and daughter who were constantly in excruciating pain because those --\nthat area where the fingers fell off, was just closing and half -- it wasn\u2019t completely\nclosed. So -- So I was told that if I can find those type of leaves in the fields, then they\nwould put it in -- o-on the affect -- in -- affect -- infected area and -- and that would\nalleviate their pain. So, I used to do that. But then, when we were told that we are\nliberated, we are free, we don\u2019t have to be afraid, well, I ran in -- you know, I was in the\nstreet and I ran in to give them the good news. And I was so happy, I was jumping and\nthis poor lady, now I understand, you know, how she felt. Then, I couldn\u2019t understand.\nShe took a broom and she started hitting me. And she said to me, \u201cWhat is there to\nrejoice?\u201d Because she and her daughter, they were really cripples. And -- And I was\njumping for joy, so she beat me up with a broom. And she said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing to\nrejoice about.\u201d I says, \u201cBut we don\u2019t have -- the Germans are gone, the Germans are\ngone.\u201d She said, \u201cOh. So?\u201d And that was that, you know, and I just walked out of the\nhouse, because I was afraid she will beat me up some more, so that was that. Then, we\nalso ran to see the first Russian airplane that landed in that -- 1n our little town. And it\nwas on the hill and it was very big and I was so happy to see this big plane, because when\nI was little and I would go with my father for walks and I would see an airplane in the\nsky and I would say, \u201cPapa, how does this plane fly?\u201d And he would say, \u201cThere is a man\nin it.\u201d And I would say, \u201cBut it\u2019s so small, how can a person sit in it?\u201d And he would say\nto me, \u201cIt seems to you that it -- he\u2019s -- this plane is very small. That\u2019s because this plane\nis so far, far away. But it\u2019s really very, very big.\u201d Well, this was my opportunity to see\nthis big plane on the hill -- course with the -- with the Russian soldiers and -- a-and oh, ar\n-- that was a sunny day and oh, I was so happy. And then, we heard that this was the day\nthat the Germans were planning to kill that handful of Jews that were hiding out with the\nGentile people. They had already dug up a ditch for us. But the Russians came in and\nnever gave them a chance to kill us. So, 1-1-1t was a tremendous celebration. I remember\nwe were just dancing in the street and was just something so very special.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm. We lived, I -- I think for another couple of weeks in the same place,\nbecause A, we had no money to go anyplace, we had nothing. So, I -- I -- I just wou --\ndon\u2019t know exactly how my mother got the money. I think what my mother did is\nwhatever we had, like even the sheets she sold, like if you had them -- we had a sheet and\nmaybe a pillowcase and maybe a blanket. She must have sold it to the people there and\nthat\u2019s how she got money for us to take a train and go back home. And so, it\u2019s a few --\nwas a few weeks later that we went home to Proscurov. And that was in 1944, April of\n1944, spring.",
        "A: Always remembered clearly. In fact, whenever I talk about my experience, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s\nright here. It\u2019s like \u2019'm watching a movie. Right in front of me, there\u2019s a screen and I'll\nsee it all over again. See, I can tell you how the sky was. When it was shining, when it\nwasn\u2019t. When it was raining. When we were walking -- the first pogrom when they lined\nus up and we were walking towards the outside of the city to the slaughterhouse. It was\ncloudy, it was drizzling, it was dreary, it was cold and yet, the liberation, it was sunny,\nthe sun was shining, the sky was blue. I can remember everything. There just isn\u2019t a thing\nthat I don\u2019t. And it\u2019s all just in front of me. Once I talk about it, it\u2019s in front of me. And\nnot only when I talk about it. It\u2019s -- My life is like a back -- backlash? Backflash -- back -",
        "A: Flashback. Like, Pll walk in the street and I'll see -- I'll -- Pll hear a German\nShepherd and that\u2019s -- right away, I got back to what has happened to me during those\nyears with the German Shepherds. When I pass a house that has a -- that looks like -- a\nlittle like a barn o-or has a barn in back o-of, that brings back memories again. So, every\nmovement in my life and everywhere I go, I see my past. I see a cat, brings back\nmemories. Even -- That\u2019s just unbelievable, but even, you know, the Germans, the SS,\ntheir hats. They had these caps with like a brim up front, but up front was very high and\nthen they had insignia, the insignia. Sometimes I\u20191l see someone with a hat similar to that\nand it like takes me aback. Right away, I'll look at that. And, like I told you, th-the plane,\nthat noise from the airport, right away I see the planes coming. God, there\u2019s just -- just\nabout everything brings memories. But, everything is very, very clear, from the minute\nthat -- when I was in my kindergarten and I was standing by the window, looking out to\nthe backyard and the first bomb fell. Like a little -- you know, away from our -- from my\nschool, but I was able to see the explosion of it and this 1s when the teachers realized that\nwe were in trouble and they all called, you know, th-the parents and the parents came\nrunning and they took the children home and -- and of course, and on the radio we heard\nthat -- that the Germans invaded us. So, from that moment on --",
        "A: Oh, I was five years old.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: And I was saying that, because I was so young and this was such an impact on my life,\nthat although perhaps I could not understand exactly what a war is, but I knew that I must\nsurvive. This I knew. And I knew that the fact that I am a Jew, nobody\u2019s supposed to\nknow that. I have to be somebody else. And, for awhile, as you know, my name was not\nFrima, it was Lola.",
        "A: No, it was Olga. I forgot, it was Olga.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. During the war, I was not Frima. I was -- We had to undertake a different\n-- different names in order for us to be somebody else. We were not supposed to be Jews.",
        "A: Oh, now you are asking me for too much. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember what\nour last name was, but we did have, believe it or not, we did have false papers, because\nyou were not allowed to walk the street, they were -- we were all so -- the rosaca -- what\ndo we call that? Curfew? Curfew, yeah. A curfew, right, in the evening? And if anyone\nwas walking, then you had -- an-and ap -- you know, and a German would stop you,\nwhich they had the right to do it. If you show them the papers, then they would let you\ngo. If you didn\u2019t have papers, they would take you in for interrogations. So, we had -- we\nhad false papers. And this all -- My mother took care on all these things. In fact, we got\nthese papers from a church, from a pastor, because my mother realized, after the pogrom\nthat they are -- or they were looking for Jews and -- and we had no place to go and so that\nmeans we would be in the streets, trying to -- you know, like she was trying to -- to see\nwhom and how she would be able to get us where and how to leave the city. So, we went\ninto a church and my mother spoke with a pastor and he gave us false papers, yeah. You\nsee, I told you there were some good people in this world. If not for them, I wouldn\u2019t be\nhere talking to you.",
        "A: Or three weeks --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Home -- hum. Well, let\u2019s see. Of course, those -- the next few weeks are -- Just by\nknowing that we don\u2019t have to worry about being killed and we don\u2019t have to hide out\nany longer and that we are going home, but we were not sure if our house will still be\nthere, you know, because of all the bombardments and all the destructions and especially\nif it\u2019s a Jewish home, of course it was destroyed quicker than any -- any -- anybody else\u2019s\nhome. But the excitement was there, the fact that perhaps my father will be there and\nperhaps my brother will be there. So, 1-1t was a mixture of excitement that we were free\nand we were going home and the worry of will we see our father again, and will we see\nour brother again, or you know, my mother\u2019s son. And -- And then, of course,\n[indecipherable] my mother always had ways of how to do things and she got that money\nand we got the tickets and we got on that train and we made it home and it was -- 1-it was\na long trip. It was -- oh, God, I know it was long. It was at least six, seven hours of, you\nknow, of traveling.",
        "A: By train, right, or maybe even more. I -- I don\u2019t remember exactly. Seems to me like it\nwas forever, anyway. And we made it home and sure enough, there was our house. It was\nstill there. Course, inside, everything was empty, you know. But -- And outside, it was\nonly partially destroyed. Also, obviously from the shootings and bombardments. So --\nBut -- But the fact that the house was there, was a wonderful feeling, and -- and -- and\nthen we began to -- to -- to hope that, you know, the family -- the rest of the family, my\nbrother, my father will come home and -- but no, it didn\u2019t work that way. My mother was\nwriting letters all over, you know, and the neighbors said that they did see my father with\ntwo Gestapos, walking in the street and that was the last time they saw him and nobody\nknew whatever, what happened to my father. So we -- After awhile -- After, you know ri\n-- writing to different places and not getting any response, we knew that we\u2019ll never see\nhim again. And my brother, well, he was writing to us also. See, after the war, he also\nbegan to write home, and we got his letters. And so this is how we, you know, started to\ncorresponding and then he came home.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, first of all, wh-when we got his letter that he was alive, we were dancing.\nI mean, it was just wonderful. He is -- was the only brother, the oldest brother, the one\nand only. And we haven\u2019t seen him in -- in three -- more than three years, I mean, almost\nfour years. And so the fact that, you know, that he was alive and th -- he would be\ncoming home and so also, you know, my mother, my mother, my aunt, they write papers\nand you know, there was always a lot of paper -- a lot of paperwork, but it worked and he\ncame. He was terribly handsome, my brother, so good looking. Tall, blonde, very good\nand very intelligent and he was, ah, it was just so wonderful to see him and -- we thought,\nyou know, maybe he was in contact with our father, we just, you know, tried everything.\nBut no, it just didn\u2019t work out that way. And then, you know, and my sister, my brother,\nthey went out to work. My mother went out to work and in between she would fix up the\n-- the house outside, they made it look real nice. And we always had an open door for\nthose who needed a place to sleep over. Even we didn\u2019t have many beds, but there was\nalways the floor, so they could sleep on the floor. And whoever needed, you know, a\nmeal or something, well our meal consisted of potato soup and that -- potato soup,\nherring and some black bread and that was very good. We did very, very well. Little by\nlittle, you know, we had the bed and my mother couldn\u2019t even afford to buy shoes for me,\nso I would go to the bombed out homes -- houses and look for rope. And then, separate\nthe rope and my mother bought me a crochet needle and I would crochet slippers. And I\nwould take a cardboard, cut out the sole, put it inside and that was my shoes. And then\nlater on, of course, I -- my mother registered me to s -- in school and she had to buy me a\npair of shoes. So, she bought one pair of shoes and I had one uniform and I went to\nschool in the afternoon and in the morning my job was, course, to clean up the house and\nmake the beds, prepare lunch for my family, and they u-used to come home for lunch.\nAnd I washed my own uniform and I did my own pressing and every day you had to go\nto school with -- with a pressed up blouse, the blouse was always pressed. And my shoes\nthat my mother bought me and then when I ca -- came home, I would take off the shoes\nthat she bought me and put on my shoes, the ones that I crocheted. Hand crochet shoes.",
        "A: This was a public school. There were hardly any Jews. We were just about, I think, the\nonly family that survived.",
        "A: Well, prejudice was always there. Anti-Semitism always existed. Persecution always\nexisted, so I guess, from a very young age, I learned that strangers shouldn\u2019t know who\nyou are. And I did very well in school and myeah --",
        "A: Okay, we were home for about two years. But before that -- before the two years of\nthe -- again, I -- I went to school, I did very well, my mother was very proud of me. My\nmother received a letter from the government, the city government, that our house is too\nbi-big just for one family, so they were planning on having two other families moving 1n,\nto live with us. With that, my mother decided that it\u2019s time to go. And although it was\nextremely difficult to le-leave the country and the city and the home and -- and whatever\nshe worked for, she felt that this was the time to leave. And so she again, as smart as my\nmother was, she again made all kinds of arrangements, got in contact with certain people\nwho helped us get the right papers in order to leave the country. And that\u2019s what we did\nand that\u2019s where we started our journey from the Ukraine to Poland, from Poland to\nGermany, from Germany to France, from France to Cuba, from Cuba to the United States\nof America and God bless America.",
        "A: To me it took forever. Is so much the trip. But --",
        "A: Well, when I arrived in -- in -- [indecipherable] in Cuba, because I lived in Cuba nine\nyears. So, the age when I arrived in Cuba, I was 13. In fact, I can show you some -- some\nleaflets that -- I used to entertain. I -- I had a very good voice and my aunt was very much\ninvolved -- my aunt, who brought us to Cuba, she was very much involved and -- you\nknow, in the Jewish organizations. And th-that was for her a chance to raise money for\nher organization, by running a dinner dance, having her niece who just came from the --\nfrom Europe singing all kinds, of course, Holocaust songs.",
        "A: More details?",
        "A: Okay, well, Paris was my last stop, so you want to --",
        "A: Let\u2019s start from Poland --",
        "A: -- to Germany.",
        "A: All right.",
        "A: Okay, we are now right, okay. Okay, our first stop was Poland, where we -- we were\nthere only for about a day, or maybe a day and a half and then by train we went to\nGermany. No, excuse me -- yes, but before that, we had to cross borders, okay? We --\nYes, we did take a train from the Ukraine to Poland, that is correct. Then in Poland we\nstayed maybe a day or a day and a half, right. And then from -- from Poland, we had to\ncross a border to Germany. Now, it is illegal, in those days, it was illegal to cross the\nborders, unless you had, of course, all the right papers, or whatever. Well -- And, of\ncourse, you cannot be Jewish, either. And that\u2019s already, even after the war. But, what my\nmother did is -- there were always people who for money would smuggle you, okay? And\nwe were not the only ones, there were many Jewish people that wanted to get out of\nPoland and wanted to, you know, sort of run towards Germany or even Italy, wherever\nthey were able to go and with the hope that from there, they will come to the United\nStates or go to Palestine or go to, you know, different countries. So, this was -- the\narrangement was a --a military truck, who was not -- who was -- did not belong to the\nmilitary any longer, it belonged to those group of men, two or three of them, who would\nsmuggle people for X amount of money. And so, you know, you had to pay for each\nhead, whatever it was and I remember so distinctly, this was this -- you know, th-those\nmilitary trucks that have canvas on top? You know, those canvas trucks, right? And we\nmust have been maybe 25 - 30 people, with little children, okay? Some were sitting on\nthe side, you know, the benches on the side. Most of us were lying on the floor and -- and\n-- and people were sitting on top of those who were sitting -- who were lying on the floor.\nAnd when we got to the border, it was -- the guards stopped us and I -- we don\u2019t know\nwhat our driver told him, but th-the guards decided to check what -- what they were\ncarrying in that -- in -- in that truck, right? So, as they started walking to the back, to\nopen up the canvas and see what material they were carrying, our driver took off. And\nthey started shooting at us. And he was zigzagging and we were not hit. Were we lucky?\nI\u2019m lucky all the time. And we made it to Germany, okay? Now, we arrived in Germany,\nit was dark. And there was a -- see, once you\u2019re in Germany, they knew that these Jews\nwere displaced persons. So they -- no problem, they would just -- you know, ha -- we had\nto fill out papers, they would register us, who we are, blah, blah, blah and they would --\nand -- an-and they was send us to Berlin. Berlin was like the headquarters for all the Jews\nthat were coming from all over the world and from -- from Berlin, they would send us to\ndifferent displaced person camps -- DP camps they were called. So, all over Germany,\nthey had these DP camps, okay? Our camp was in Bavaria, part of Bavaria. And -- And\nthe city -- the name of the city was Poking, but our camp was outside of Poking, our DP\ncamp, which wa -- there were like -- there were wooden barracks and I don\u2019t know if\nthese barracks were built after the war or they were there before the war, I really don\u2019t\nknow. And -- But after the war, I found out that actually these barracks were built on top\nof a Jewish children cemetery. Jewish children were buried there. They were killed\nduring the war, they were buried there and then these barracks were built, you know,\nbefore we arrived.",
        "A: Well, somebody that -- that was in that area told me, a-a-and I was -- I was shocked,\nbecause I -- I didn\u2019t know -- none of us really knew. So, what happened, so we lived in\nthat area and in that DP camp, I don\u2019t know how many of us were -- but I do know that\nthe museum has a picture of one of the barracks behind me and my sister. That was my\nschool and that was also our entertainment building. We used -- I used to entertain, I used\nto sing. And there were children who danced and this was our school and this was our\nsocial hall.",
        "A: To entertain, yes --",
        "A: At -- Wh -- Yeah, yeah, at the DP camp, right",
        "A: Well no, I -- those were not the times for me to sing, when I knew that I\u2019m all alone.",
        "A: After the war, when I came home.",
        "A: Yeah, probably you are right, yes, probably that was the reason. Yeah, come to think\nabout it.",
        "A: Well, I had -- No, I had a good reason to sing then, you know?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. We had one room and we as a family, a whole family, you\nknow the four of us, yeah, all four of us, yeah, my -- well, m-my father wasn\u2019t with us\nany longer. That\u2019s my brother, my sister, myself and my mother, right. We had one room\nand you know, every family had a room. It was very -- That was very good. This is where\nthe HIAS and Joint came in and they helped us. HIAS? It\u2019s the Hebrew -- Hebrew, God,\nthe HIAS, how they -- they spell it? Well they, 1t\u2019s H-I-A-S. That\u2019s an organization that\nprovides people who are need of food and clothing, they provide them. And also the\nJoint. That\u2019s J-o-i-n-t, Joint. They also an -- are an organization that provide, you know,\nthe refugees and the Displaced Person with food and clothing, cause none of us had jobs\nand we had to eat. And so, whatever we got, it was no big deal, but it still was food, and -\n- and clothing. And --",
        "A: There was nothing to work, there are no jobs for us. We had no jobs.",
        "A: Oh, oh well, you know, my mother would help out the sick people, somebody was\nsick. I went to school. Right away a school was set up. In every DP camp there was a\nschool and we went to school. We would -- We were taught Jewish, Hebrew and the\nlanguage of the country, yeah. And la -- as I said, and -- and the schoolchildren we used\nto entertain, like once a week, we would have -- you know, for the parents and the whole\nDP camp would come and we would entertain, singing and dancing and you name it and\nwe did all these things. We also, you know, we had all kinds of competitions, bicycle\nriding and running and jumping and you name it, I mean we -- they kept us really busy.\nYeah, it was --",
        "A: They were pleasant because I didn\u2019t have to worry about pogroms and I was not\nsurrounded by barbed wires and I -- and I didn\u2019t have -- I didn\u2019t hear the German\nShepherds bark. So, that was like feeling I\u2019m safe.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yeah, well, a-a-after this -- a-after Shlupfing and that\u2019s the DP, my first DP camp\nwhere we stayed, they suddenly decided to close this DP camp and they moved us to\nanother DP camp, not too far, you know, a few kilometers from this one, which was a\nmuch larger one and the name of that camp was Volshtadt. It was also in Bavaria. So, we\nstayed in the first camp like, I think, a year or so and -- and the same amount of time in\nthe other camp, until -- well, time came when they said, ofka -- of course, you have to\nmove on. Okay, so --",
        "A: Well, usually what everyone tried to do is get in touch with their f-families or relatives\nin whichever country they had relatives and the relatives would have the papers ready for\nthem. Like, we had papers to come into the United States, except, when we got from\nGermany to France, from where we were supposed to come to the United States, we were\nsupposed to wait longer on that quota th-th-the am -- the American quota was very slow.\nI imagine they had maybe a lot of people. So we had to wait. And my mother --",
        "A: Right. And we lived there for about a year.",
        "A: Yeah. Continued going to school. I also, in between, would help out mothers with\nlittle children like I was a babysitter. I mean, free of charge, you know. And we had\nsynagogue who caught fire and you know, because these were old barracks, they were\ndried pieces of wood put together, huts really. I mean that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what it was. But we\nknew it was temporary and everything, you know, compared to what we had to go\nthrough during, you know, during the pogroms, this was fine. And so we were looking\nforward that, you know, tomorrow will be a better tomorrow. And sure enough, the\ntomorrow came where we had to take the train from Munich to Paris.",
        "A: No, we -- we just went to Munich to take the train to Paris and we did and we lived in\na rooming house. I don\u2019t think it was a hotel, I think it was a rooming house. We had one\nroom. We lived there for five months.",
        "A: You see, I don\u2019t remember. I think 1t was a combination between the organization and\nmy family in the United States who send us, you know, send money and packages at that\ntime, you understand? They were also helping us out. So, I don\u2019t -- You know, I -- I -- I\ncan\u2019t say if they were going to say if the organization paid for our stay completely or it\nwas half and half. But, whichever way it was, they were always there if we needed help.\nThis -- This I do remember. Everyone said, you know, if we need -- you need help, you\ngo to the HIAS or you go to the Joint and they will help you, and -- and I imagine they\ndid.",
        "A: Well, when I wasn\u2019t in -- in Germany, of course I -- I spoke Russian and I spoke\nYiddish and I spoke Hebrew and I spoke a little German and I hated the language. Course\na lot of things also happened in Germany. I -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know how I got it, but one\nevening, the night of Yom Kippur, I was sitting outside the synagogue and I suddenly got\nthis terrible headache. I came home and I was running an -- a very, very high\ntemperature. And my mother called a doctor and he came and he examined me and he\nsaid that immediately they have to take me in by ambulance to outskirts of -- of Berlin,\nbecause I am very sick and I might have diphtheria and that\u2019s a contagious disease. So,\ncan you imagine? Here I am, I thought I was finished with Germany, but here I am sick\nand they taking me with a German ambulance to a hospital on the outskirts --",
        "A: Berlin. Outskirts of Berlin --",
        "A: From Berlin -- From the DP camp in Berlin. I mean, yes, you know --\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Right now, we are ou -- we are back in Berlin, in the DP camp. This 1s --",
        "A: No, the first DP camp. I\u2019m -- The reason I\u2019m going back 1s because I want to tell you\nthat I got sick, okay? Yeah, okay? How\u2019d it ever go back to us -- but anyway, this is just\na reminder as to what happened to me, while we were in -- 1n -- in Berlin -- in the\nDisplaced Person camp in Berlin, after we arrived from Poland, and after we cross the\nborder to Germany. We were there for a short while, but during that time, the night\nbefore Yom Kippur, I suddenly was -- was hit with a terrible headache, while sitting\noutside the synagogue and listening to the prayers. And my mother called the doctor and\nhe immediately ordered a -- an ambulance to take me to a German hospital outside of\nBerlin, because I was very sick, and what I had was diphtheria, which is a contagious\ndisease. And so, three weeks I was in that hospital, in isolation and I did not sleep and I\ndid not eat, because I was afraid they\u2019Il kill me again. And I -- I was not allowed to have\nvisitors, so my mother would come and stand by the window and just wave to me. And\nevery time they gave me an injection, I would say, \u201cThis is it. They killed me.\u201d And I\nwas afraid to eat, because in case there\u2019s poison in it. All because I knew I\u2019m a Jew. I\ndon\u2019t know if they knew I was Jewish, but obviously they did know that I\u2019m Jewish\nbecause they took me by ambulance from the DP camp. And the only people that went to\nthe DP camps, were the Jews. So, after that, we went to the next DP camp and then to the\nnext one, the third one, which was Volshtadt, and then from Volshtadt, we went to -- to\nMunich, to catch the train to Paris.",
        "A: And here, we\u2019re on our way to Paris.",
        "A: Absolutely. And --",
        "A: Yes. Well, the language brings memories and many times I just -- I-I-I\u2019Il just -- Pl\nsort of cover my ears, not to hear the language, because it -- it brings memories in the --\nand I really get very upset. I -- I -- I -- I -- I never felt really, completely free, you know,\na-away. So, when I lived in Germany, there was still fear inside of me that, if they know\nthat Iam a Jew, something might happen to me, or they\u2019Il do something to me. And to\nthis day, it didn\u2019t change. And the German Shepherd, that dog, when I hear him bark, I\ndon\u2019t even have to see him. Terrible feeling. I -- I-I-It\u2019s very hard to end -- to -- to even\nexplain. It\u2019s like my -- my stomach jumps. My heart starts racing.",
        "A: In my life? Well, during the first pogrom, when we were rounded up, they came to the\nghetto, where th -- th -- the SS came with the German Shepherds and so, that is to make\nsure that we don\u2019t run or we don\u2019t do anything, right? I mean, we were helpless anyway,\nbecause it was very early in the morning. It was just beginning to light -- to get light and\nwe were sleeping and they started knocking on -- on the windows and on the doors. And\nof course, with that, as they were knocking, the German Shepherds were barking. And\nthen ho -- all -- a-after we were lined up to go, you know, to the slaughterhouse I call it,\nyou know, where they did the killings, on both sides of the roads, on the road that we\nwalked towards the slaughterhouse, they had the SS, with the German Shepherds,\nstanding there. And so, to me, as I was looking at them, was frightening. And during the\ntime that I was alone, and I was walking the streets, I used to hide between the trees at\nnight, when I would go back to the ladies house, to sleep under -- under her house, I\nwould go between the shadows of the trees, I should not be noticed by the German\nShepherd. Because, you know, they -- they -- if they see a shadow, they'll -- they\u2019Il run\nafter a shadow. I was ou -- I tried to be so careful. I-It was unbelievable. And their\nbarking just never left me. And the fear of what they can do to you, with their masters, I\nmean, 1-is something that did not change my feelings and th-this is unfortunate that -- the\nlanguage -- a-and I would just never go back. I keep saying, I would never go back to\nGermany, although sometimes I say I want to go back and see the place where I lived, the\nDP camps, but I\u2019m not sure if -- if it\u2019s -- you know, what\u2019s there. It\u2019s probably nothing,\nit\u2019s a cemetery now.",
        "A: No, I just --",
        "A: Well, Paris, I would love to go back, I -- I told my husband I would like to show him -\n- | hope that that rooming house is still there, where we lived and I would like to show it\nto him.",
        "A: Oh yes, I learn quickly, a little bit of French. I -- Of course, I did not go to school,\nbecause this was in the middle of the semester, so nobody would take me, but I kept very\nbusy. I did learn, you know, I had to go shopping for my mother, I did learn important\nthings.",
        "A: And how to travel.",
        "A: My aunts. Remember I told you my aunts and then, you know, my mother, every so\noften, would sell something else that we had, and --",
        "A: I had an aunt in Cuba and twins in the United States, yeah, so they -- they really, all of\nthem helped us and th-that was very important, because none of us were able to work for\nfive months in -- in, you know, in Paris. But, we did do a lot of volunteer work. I, for\nexample, would babysit for -- for the young couples with children, all sort -- you know,\nimmigrants. They were in transit from Paris to somewheres, okay? And -- And if the\nmother wasn\u2019t feeling well, I would take care on the baby. You know, I was like a\nbabysitter or a mother\u2019s helper. Then, once a week, there was a -- a -- a group of\nMoroccan Jews that lived on a hill and I don\u2019t remember the name of the hill, also,\noutskirts of Paris. And I learned quickly, how to travel by Metro and I would go all over\nParis. I knew exactly where I had to go. And of course, as I said, I learned the necessary\nvocabulary that I needed --",
        "A: -- to -- to get around.",
        "A: Yeah, I was 12 years old, that\u2019s correct. Almost ready to get married. And I would -- I\nwould collect clothing from different people and I would go to the bakeries and collect\nbreads and cakes and pick up two valises and go to these Moroccan people and bring\nthem food and clothing. And was bit heavy because there were maybe -- maybe, oh, I\ndon\u2019t know, maybe 50, maybe 60 people, I don\u2019t know how many, 1-it -- and they lived\nlike in a cave. It wasn\u2019t even a house. It looked like a cave. And, of course, you must\nunderstand, not everyone was lucky to have a bed or a shower. So, I don\u2019t know how\nlong these people were living there, but they developed an odor that when I used to come\nto the hill, before I even walked up, I -- I -- I held my breath. And then I would walk up\nand leave the two valises in front of the entrance and run away. That -- That\u2019s what I did,\nfor five months. So -- And my mother did other volunteer work and my sister did\nvolunteer work and my brother did volunteer work, you know, whatever.",
        "A: Yeah, my mother always did things. Our home was always open, we always had\npeople coming, going. We had a large table and the middle of the table, there was that\nsummervar -- the summervar. You know what a summervar is? It\u2019s that Russian, big\ncoffee pot or teapot. That\u2019s summervar, and with glasses and -- and we always had\npeople coming and my mother always baked a cookie, a -- you know, and fruits and\npeople would have a -- a glass of tea, not a cup of tea. So -- And -- And this thing was,\nyou know, with coal -- coal inside and that what made the water hot, and -- so it -- 1-1t\nwas an open house and -- and after the war, it was also an open house. Remember I told\nyou, whoever needed some potato soup, well, had a meal in my house and -- and if they\nneeded a place to sleep, well, there weren\u2019t enou -- there weren\u2019t enough beds, but we\nhad a floor, so no problem. M --",
        "A: No, I\u2019m just kidding you.",
        "A: No. In Paris? None whatsoever, nothing. What we did in Paris is, you know, I would\ntake my mother to the Eif-Eiffel Tower, and we\u2019ll go to Pigall, to the street of Pigall,\nthere was a lot of entertainment there. I would walk -- of course I couldn\u2019t afford to go\ninto the opera, but I would walk from where I lived, just to stand there and look at this\nmagnificent building, the opera. So, no, we -- you know, like every day, I would take my\nmother someplace else and we would just go and look, you know, and I remember the\nwhole family one day, we went to Marseilles. That was very nice. You know, we kept\nbusy. You know, I was never bored, no.",
        "A: Yeah, exactly. We knew it was -- We were -- It was just sort of a hop over place, you\nknow? And after the five months that we were in France, we -- we went to Cannes -- oh,\nwell, as I said, I\u2019m jumping. We were supposed to go to the United States from Paris,\nexcept that the quota was delayed and --",
        "A: Yeah, quota. There was always a quota. And my mother heard that there 1s going to be\na World War Three, and so she became panicky and she said, \u201cWe must leave Europe\nimmediately.\u201d So, she had a sister in Cuba. She call -- you know, she wrote to her a letter,\nand my aunt, you know, did whatever she was able to do, which wa -- it wasn\u2019t easy to\ncome to Cuba, but my aunt again, you know, paid whatever had to be paid and made the\nright papers and we went from Paris to Cannes and we took a boat, a commercial boat.",
        "A: That -- In France, yeah that -- that\u2019s the Riviera, okay, the area of Riviera, which I\ndon\u2019t know them, because again, we went there at night. But this is from where the\ncommercial -- a Polish commercial ship was leaving and we were the passengers on that\nship. And for three weeks we were on that ship, going to Cuba.",
        "A: No, because it was a commercial ship, I think we were the only family, maybe there\nwere a few other single people. Not going to Cuba, they were just working on -- on that\nship. We were the only ones who went to Cuba. But that ship made a stopover in Cuba,\neither picking up cargo or -- or delivering something. And this is how we wind up going\nwith this commercial ship. A, because I don\u2019t know 1-1-1f there were any luxury ships\ngoing from France to Cuba and B, if there were, we probably couldn\u2019t afford them. So,\nthis was the next best thing. Course, it was -- it was a very hard trip. I mean, 1-1-1t\u2019s not a\nluxury ship and we were all the way on the bottom there, in the cabins. And -- A-\nAlthough I wasn\u2019t sick, my sister was sick all the time, my mother was pretty good, my\nbrother was pretty good. And --",
        "A: -- it seemed like forever. Well, we didn\u2019t eat much, there wasn\u2019t much to eat, but there\nwas bread and there was butter and there was milk and there was fish, I think, yeah fish.\nAnd that was fine. I mean, yes -- couldn\u2019t really starve, a hard boiled eggs, I mean, you\nknow, you -- a fruits, looks -- they didn\u2019t feed like it\u2019s a luxury boat. You have to\nunderstand, to me this was already luxury compared to my life before. This was\nwonderful. But, the sea was rough and -- a-and three weeks 1s a long time when it\u2019s not\nreally the right type of a boat, you know, to travel such a long time. But, we made it and\nit was a beautiful day when we arrived in Havana. It was beautiful. It was sunny like this\nand then when we came out on the deck and we looked down in that little launcher,\nwhich 1s a little boat, there were my aunts, waving to us, oh. That was such an exciting\nmoment in our lives, my God. These were aunts I didn\u2019t know, cause when they left, I -- I\nwas very little and my -- my -- my grandmother, who was their mother, she left, I was\nsix months old, so I -- I -- and of course, she died here, before I came. My -- My dis -- M-\nMy maternal grandmother died the day after we were liberated and she did not know that\nher oldest daughter was alive. Isn\u2019t that sad?",
        "A: Yeah, my mother was the oldest daughter out of four daughters and -- and one son.\nShe didn\u2019t know. And my aunts told me that she used to pray every day and say, \u201cOh, I\nwonder where my daughter Eta is with her ch -- family. Where 1s she? Is she al -- Is she\nalive, Is she alive?\u201d And she died the day before. It was so sad. Okay, so --",
        "A: Yes, yes. From my father\u2019s side, everybody was killed. In fact, on Yom Kippur of\n1942, right? \u201842? *41? Get me, I think it\u2019s \u201842 - 1942. The whole town was wiped out.\nThe whole town of Volachisk was wiped out. That included my grandmother, her sons,\nher only daughter, her grandchildren, you know, aunts, uncles, you name it. The whole\ntown was wiped out. So, from my father\u2019s side, nobody. We had here a few cousins, my\nfather\u2019s few cousins. One is in Israel, one was here, she already passed away a long time\nago. So, all we really had are my mother\u2019s sisters and my mother\u2019s brother. And so my --\nth-th-the three sisters were in that boat, you know, on that little boat, launcher, you know,\nlooking up to us while we were on the deck waiting, you know, to disembark.",
        "A: Oh my, well the oldest one next to my mother is Clara, and she passed away a long\ntime ago. A lovely lady. We -- We lived with her for awhile until we were able -- she was\nthe one who lived in Cuba and she was the one who made us the papers and we lived\nwith her until we were able to afford an apartment. You know, until my mother went out\nto -- my mother never went out to work, I\u2019m sorry. My brother went out to work, my\nsister went out to work and I went out to work. Mother\u2019s wouldn\u2019t -- did not work in\nthose days, at least not by us. To us, she was a mother, and she was a widow and she\u2019s\nnot to work. So my mother was a housewife and we worked. And then my other two\naunts, the -- the other one who is next -- well, my uncle wasn\u2019t there, he was in Florida\nand his name is Abraham and he 1s not here any longer, may he rest in peace. And then\nthe next sister is Margaret and she passed away two years ago and I have just one and\nonly little aunt, my mother\u2019s youngest sister Elizabeth and she lives in Florida.",
        "A: Is Glaser.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: And that is the story --",
        "A: No, that\u2019s only the beginning, when we arrived.",
        "A: If you don\u2019t mind.",
        "A: Okay. And I\u2019m going to have a cup of coffee. How\u2019s that, okay? Is it okay?",
        "A: Yeah, I need something for my throat.",
        "A: Yeah. Okay, well, when we arrived in Cuba, in Havana, it was during middle of\nsemester. So, no school would accept me in the middle of semester. So, in the meantime,\nI learned the language on my own, and in three months I spoke Spanish fluently. It truly\nis a lovely, lovely language and lovely, lovely people. And we lived with my Aunt Clara,\nwho brought us to Cuba, for about five weeks and then my brother, my sister, they got\njobs and we were able to rent an apartment a block away from my aunt and we moved\ninto our own apartment, a one bedroom. And well, after I spoke Spanish, my cousin who\nis Clara\u2019s daughter, and she\u2019s not with us any longer, Dorothy, she went with me to a\nprivate school and asked them if they would accept me, since I came from Europe and I\nhad f-finished six grades in -- no, not six grades, I finished about five grades in -- in\nGermany and they were -- after examining me, they were willing to accept me. Now, this\nwas a private school of about 45 kids and I was the only Jewish person. And they were so\nenthused with me. And they liked me so much, of course -- oh, before they took me,\nthough, I had to go through exams from first grade, all the way to sixth grade.",
        "A: That, absolutely. Okay? And that\u2019s when I was accepted to the sixth grade, because I\nwas up to par with them. And I was even better in math. I was very, very good in math.\nSo -- And, plus the fact that, I-I-I\u2019m a very well-behaved girl and I had the honor, and --\nand I know that a lot of the kids were very jealous and they really resented the fact that I,\nas a Jewish girl, an immigrant coming from Europe, I had the honor of holding the Cuban\nflag every morning when we sang the Cuban anthem. And after the year -- you know,\nafter graduating sixth grade, I graduated with a gold medal. And that was\n[indecipherable] school. Then, I did mention to you that my aunt [indecipherable]\nopportunity of raising money for her organization by running a dinner dance, and so I\nsang, you know, songs from the concentration camps and songs from the ghettos. And\nmy a -- my -- my -- my cousin Dorothy, her daughter, she would play the piano.",
        "A: I sang in Jewish. There were Jewish songs and Hebrew songs.",
        "A: Yeah, well, except I don\u2019t have the voice and if I start singing, I will start crying.",
        "A: They\u2019re very sad songs, they really are. They\u2019re sad. And wa -- I will just give you the\ntitle of one of the songs and that\u2019s \u201cPuppyrosen.\u201d Puppyrosen in Russian means\ncigarettes. And the song is about a little boy who was left a orphan and -- and -- and he\u2019s\nstanding at the corner of a street, trying to make some money and it\u2019s windy and it\u2019s cold\nand it\u2019s raining. And he\u2019s asking, \u201cPlease, buy this cigarettes, so you can save my life.\u201d\nWas a really very sad. So I can\u2019t sing it for you. And there were other, you know, very\nsad songs about Jewish survival and atrocities and horrors that -- you know, that we went\nthrough. But --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see which other so -- oh, there wa -- there was one happy song.",
        "A: The happy song was, after all these sad songs, it was, \u201cI\u2019m -- I\u2019m going to Israel, and\nI\u2019m saying goodbye to all of you and I\u2019m so happy that we are finally free and we going\nto the land -- to our Promised Land, and -- and -- oh, and this land 1s -- is a blessing for\nthe Jews and it was promised,\u201d you know, \u201cby God and -- a-a-a-and this -- this land is so\nimportant to -- a-a-a -- the -- to the Jewish nation. It\u2019s like -- a-an -- 1-it -- it\u2019s so\nimportant to -- to -- to the Jewish nations, like the right hand is to your body.\u201d I mean, a-\nand there\u2019s other which I -- offhand, I just -- I can\u2019t think. Well, anyway, she raised a lot\nof money, because so many people came an-and later on I\u2019Il show you, I have one of\nthose flyers that she made out, with my picture on it.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, for Jewish organizations and the organizations in Cuba\nwhich dealt with, you know, children and poor people, or whatever. No, I need my thi -- I\ngot it, I got it, 1t\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. You know, so --",
        "A: No -- no --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s okay, that\u2019s fine, no. So that was that and course, after I graduated my\nSpanish school, I -- I -- I -- I took a job in a factory -- my cousin in a fac --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: At 13 - 13.",
        "A: Yeah, 13 I graduated sixth grade.",
        "A: That\u2019s it.",
        "A: No, no, no. At that time. Then, I -- I -- I had -- Took my -- I had a job and I worked in\na factory and I was -- I used to pack merchandise and I -- I -- in the shipping department,\nokay? And I would go to school at night. And that\u2019s how I continued my education, by\ngoing to school at night. And in turn, my -- my -- my aunt got very sick, the one who\nbrought us to Cuba, Clara. And she -- she had her kidney removed and -- a-and I felt so\nobligated, you know, to -- to her, for being so good to us and bringing us to Cuba and\nsetting us up and helping us and -- and buying me things, clothing and all the things that I\n-- | -- I wanted to be her nurse, yeah, so I can stay with her until she gets better. And\nluckily, because I stayed with her, I discovered that she had diabetes. After surgery, she\ndeveloped diabetes. And how did I detected diabetes? Because I would change her\nwound every morning. And one morning I took that sheet and I hung it outside, she had a\nbalcony by her window. You know, by her room and later on when I went to take it in, I\nsaw ants crawling on that area and I knew it had to be sugar, glucose.",
        "A: Yeah, and so when the doctor came, I told him, I says, \u201cYou know, doctor, this and\nthis is what happened. And sure enough, when they -- after they tested her, they found\nout that she had -- she developed diabetes during surgery. Isn\u2019t that something? You\nknow, from the shock, many times people develop diabetes. Well, I remained with her at\nthe hospital 24 hours a day for five weeks, until she got better and then she went home. I\nwent home and I continued working and actually, I was able to take off from work\nbecause I worked for her son, her son had the factory, so it was no problem. My siblings\nworked. My mother did not work, because in those years, and according to our -- our way\nof life, a mother should not be working. Her place is at home, and that\u2019s what we did. My\nmother stayed home, she was a housewife and all of us worked and we all, you know,\nchipped in and paid for the rent and we had a one bedroom apartment, my mother and I,\ncause at that time already, my sister got married and she lived in a different city.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, someone --",
        "A: -- ah, Jewish, yeah. A Jewi -- Cuban Jewi -- a Cuban Jew. And -- And my brother had\nhis own place in Havana and my mother and I, we lived on the outskirts of Havana, we\nhad the one bedroom apartment. And not too far from my aunt, of course, you know. And\nI -- I had -- I had a lot of friends and I loved the Cuban people. And w-we were never\nafraid we would, you know, go out at night and walk, one, two o\u2019clock in the morning.\nNobody ever was afraid of anybody, everything was very peaceful.",
        "A: At that time, was Batista. Fulgencio Batista. And -- In fact, while talking about\nFulgencio Batista, a group of us, we were -- we had some friends who worked in\nBatista\u2019s summer home, Valadero Beach, and we were -- you know, we went to\nValadero, which is very beautiful town near the most beautiful beach in the world. We\nwent to spend some time by the beach and our friends who worked for Batista asked us if\nwe wanted to sleep over in Batista\u2019s summer home, since the family was away. So we\ndid. How about that? Boy, boyo.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: At that time I was already a teenager, but to me it was something very exciting, to\nsleep in a president\u2019s house. Hey, that was quite an honor.",
        "A: Well, where I worked -- you know, later on, of course, I changed jobs. 15, I already\nworked -- was it 15 or 16? Probably 16, excuse me, at the age of 16, that means three\nyears I worked in the factory. Then, I -- I -- I worked in a department store as a buyer. I --\nI had all kinds of friends. I had a Italian friend who had a beautiful voice and he sang like\nMario Lanza. Oh, he had such a beautiful voice. And, of course, we used to sing at all our\nfriends weddings. That means we worked -- we all worked the same place. So there were\na few who were getting married. So, when we used to go to their weddings, he -- oh,\nwhat was his name? Ooh. Gino, I think. Gino, Gino. We would sing together.",
        "A: Of course, yeah, that was in Spanish.",
        "A: Well, we had s -- had Syrian friends. I had Italian friends, I had Cuban friends, I had\nJewish friends. I also had a -- an Oriental friend. Yeah, I -- I -- I was beautiful. Only, we\nwere just --",
        "A: Yes, I would say yes and I\u2019m thinking that it was not as large as -- the -- it wasn\u2019t very\nlarge, because you see, 1-it\u2019s a very small country, a -- really very small, so mostly,\neveryone settle in Havana, so there was, you know, X amount, a small population of\nJewish people, Chinese people, whatyouma -- Syrian people, you know? But e -- you can\ncall it, I think, you know, if you say for -- for a little country like that, maybe it was, you\nknow?",
        "A: That is very true. That is very, very true.",
        "A: They were just wonderful. There were truly -- They\u2019re -- They\u2019re not hostile -- They\nwere not hostile people. They were very compassionate people. A-And --And if they\nheard, oh you came from -- from Europe, oh then, you know, they have to extra care --\nextra good care of you, you know? This is the type of people they were. They were also\npeople like -- if they would have a piece of bread and you tell them you\u2019re hungry, they\u2019Il\ngive you half of their bread. Without asking any questions, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are.\nSo, this is the type of people that they were. Of course, I don\u2019t know what kind of people\nthey are today. Must understand, it\u2019s been over 40 years. Now, leadership had changed,\nand people changed --",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Not at all. The reason why -- I left before Castro came into\npower and that was simply because I felt that there wasn\u2019t for me, enough, in Cuba, as far\nas a social life, as far as marriage. You know, like -- are -- and I felt that -- and my aunts\nreally wanted me to come here. That was a good reason. So they quickly made up papers\nfor me and I came to the United States.",
        "A: Yeah, my mother stayed in Cuba. My sister was married and she stayed in Cuba. My\nbrother came to the United States before I did.",
        "A: Yeah, he was already here. And then I came, you know, for -- on a temporary we --\nvisa, to see, you know, do I like it, don\u2019t I like it? You know, what\u2019s doing. And while I\nwas here, Castro came into power, because I came here in 1957, okay? And Castro came\ninto power 1959 or \u201860, something like that. 19 six -- maybe \u201859. Oh well, something\nlike. So, I -- I came here and I lived with my aunts.",
        "A: Oh, yes I did. I went back to visit my mother, yeah.",
        "A: N-Not many times, because then my mother decided to come here, too, so --",

You\nsee, like, my aunt also moved here. So my aunt and -- my mother decided she may as\nwell stay -- come to the United States. Why stay in Cuba?",
        "A: I -- I-- You know, I -- I really didn\u2019t feel sad, because I knew Cuba\u2019s only 45 minutes\nfrom -- from Miami, so it\u2019s not like you going away -- far, far away. And then, the fact\nthat I\u2019m -- I\u2019m having family here and my brother\u2019s here an-and my mother was willing\nto come, so I didn\u2019t feel that I was lonely, you know, that I'll be alone in the world, so no,\nI -- | always felt I can go back to Cuba. Uh-huh, you have a ha -- an hour. Uh-huh.",
        "A: Okay, the first stop was east New York. My aunt lived on Miller Avenue.",
        "A: Miller Avenue, in east New York. And, very lovely area and this is my youngest aunt,\nwho had -- I mean, one son passed away, unfortunately, but at that time she had two boys\nand her husband and they lived in an apartment, but she had a room for me. And we got\nalong very well and I really was very happy, you know, be wi -- in her house. And during\nthat time, my brother got married, my mother came to the wedding. And --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, got married here. And then, oh yeah, then I decided I wanted to stay here\npermanently, so -- but I was here on a temporary visa and the only way for me to remain,\nI either had to go to school or marry an American. So, I decided I would like to go to\nschool. But then, you know, not every school is going to admit you and I wanted to go to\na Yeshiva University. That\u2019s a teacher\u2019s institute for women, a Yeshiva University. So, I\n-- So -- [ -- Then, at that time, I moved to another aunt of mine, who is not here any\nlonger, Margaret and I went -- Manya, we used to call her, and she --",
        "A: Manya, yeah. Russian name.",
        "A: Russian name.",
        "A: I know. So I call her Margaret.",
        "A: Oh, English. Oh, wa -- English, I learned in Cuba.",
        "A: Yes, right. I learned in Cuba, in my -- you know, my -- my courses, I took English.\nJust like I took shorthand and I took typing, you know, commercial course and\neverything else. And I took bookkeeping. You name it, I took a lot of things. And let\u2019s\nsee, where was I now? And --",
        "A: Okay, right. Okay, so -- so my Aunt Manya took me to meet her rabbi, who 1s now a -\n- a -- the chairman of the -- oh, what do you call this? Big organization, I just forgot the\nname of it, but okay, his name is Rabbi Arthur Schnier. And he really deals now, at the\npresent time with -- with relationships between Judaism and Christian -- Christians, you\nknow, yeah, he\u2019s -- I forgot what he called it. P\u2019Il tell you in a minute.[indecipherable |\nYeah, okay, so I went and I met Rabbi Arthur Schnier and h-he was always involved in\npolitics and he knew a lot of people in Washington and he knew a lot of people here.\nAnd anyway, my aunt told him the story, that I would like to remain in, you know, this\ncountry and I would like to go to school. And so my choice is Teacher\u2019s Institute for\nWomen, I would like to be a Hebrew teacher. And so he said, \u201cOkay, Ill see what I can\ndo,\u201d and he arranged for the Yeshiva to accept me, but before, I had to go through exam.\nNow, I never had any background in the Yeshiva or anything like that, but they gave me\ntwo weeks to prepare myself for the exam and I did very well, I was accepted. And after I\nwas accepted, I -- I was going to -- to school three times a week and -- and I worked 20\nhours a week. I was allowed to work 20 hours a week, so I always had, you know, a few\ndollars of my own. And I -- I-I met, in my class, my classmate. We became very good\nfriends, with this young lady, her name was Sivia and she lived in Crown Heights,\nBrooklyn and she would occasionally invite me to her house for, you know, for the\nweekend. And then one day she said to me, \u201cYou know, I know s -- a very nice fellow I\nwould like you to meet.\u201d And I said, \u201cOh Sivia, I have so many blind dates. I really don\u2019t\nwant to meet any more.\u201d And she said to me, \u201cBut he\u2019s very nice, and I do want you to\nmeet him. So, let me give him your telephone number and I\u2019Il never bother you again.\u201d\nWell, she gave Harry, my husband my telephone number, and he called me. So, we made\na date, the day my brother was getting married. So he should come to the wedding and\npick me up. And that\u2019s what he did. And so, we met. And we went out and I guess there\nwas something that we developed in common. And then, after, you know, dating him for\nabout five months -- from January, February, March, April, May, June, five months and\nhe never said anything. So, I said to myself, \u201cOkay, Pll make him talk.\u201d I can\u2019t go on,\nyou know, I just come out and ask him, \u201cWell, are we serious? I-Is -- I mean, are you\ninterested in me or what?\u201d So, I said to myself, \u201cOkay, that gives me a chance to go back\nto visit my mother.\u201d Okay? And that wa -- no, the ma -- ma -- I\u2019m sorry, my mother was\nhere, the rest of the family, right. I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to go to Cuba.\u201d And that\u2019s\nwhat I did. So, we were dating for f-five months, he said nothing, so I told him, \u201cI\u2019m\ngoing back to Cuba and -- and I\u2019Il decide if I\u2019m -- you know, I'll think about if I\u2019m\ncoming back or not coming back, I\u2019m --\u201d this, that. So, I went back to Cuba and he\nstarted writing letters. Every day I would get a letter from him and telephone calls and\nthis and that and this and that. And then, in the meantime, I -- I was teaching in the -- in\nthe Hebrew school in Cuba, Judaism. And Labor day, my husband surprised me and\ncame to visit me, to Cuba, and -- you know, in those days we had no jets. I-It -- He had to\nfly four and a half hours -- five hours to get to Cuba from the u -- from New York. But he\ncame and he met the rest of the family.",
        "A: Yup, this was -- This was in, yeah, 1960. No, no, I\u2019m sorry, 1959, no, 1959, because\nwe got married in 1960. 1959, and then he came again Christmas -- Christmas weekend,\nyou know, the same year, and he proposed. And so, we got married --civilly married in\nCuba that is. And within three weeks, I was able to come into the United States as a\nresident, cause I married an American.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go back. I remained --",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, I just went for a visit. And then -- but he, you know, a-a-after I married\nhim, whatyoumacallit, legally, I become, automatically a resident of the United States, so\nI came in as a resident, within three weeks and then we got religiously married in April.\nApril 10th of 1960.",
        "A: You know, it seems like all the survivors have the same problem. After the war, when\n-- you know, when we came to Cuba, and my mother wanted to tell her sisters, as to what\nshe went through during the war, you know, the Holocaust experience. The first thing\nthey said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. It 1s past, 1t\u2019s finished with. You are free. Forget it.\u201d\nNow, you cannot forget it. You cannot just push it away. But -- Although they meant\nwell, it wasn\u2019t right. And so the minute they said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, it\u2019s finished with,\nnow you\u2019re free, you\u2019re here, everything will be all right. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201d So we never spoke\nabout it. And when I was, you know, dating my husband or when I was with whomever I\nwas, I f -- I didn\u2019t want, A, to talk about it, because it\u2019s very painful. Every time I would\nstart talking, I would start crying. It\u2019s only recently that I don\u2019t cry as much and I think I\nran out of -- of -- of tears. But, that makes me sick. Like, for example, you take this\ninterview. It\u2019ll take me a week or 10 days for me to get back to be normal. That means, I\nwon\u2019t sleep nights. That means, it\u2019s constantly even more so. Although I live with this\nexperience every day, by talking about it, it -- it intensifies and intensifies my whole\nsystem, my mind, my body, everything like, gets sick. So, we didn\u2019t talk about it.",
        "A: I think maybe fif -- 10 years ago, 15 years ago, maybe.",
        "A: No, I think during that time, yeah. I would say I would start talking about it -- was\ntruly telling the story? That was the first time I would sit and tell the story. In between, I\nwould tell my children, here and there a little bit. Cause when they were small, I didn\u2019t\nwant to upset them. I didn\u2019t want them to be afraid of this world by thinking, \u201cOh, that\u2019s\nwhat happened to my mother. Might happen to me, too.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t want them to live\nwith that worry on their minds, so I kept quiet. But, occasionally, things would happen so\nvery quickly, I would say something, you know? And that was that, you know, but they -\n- I never really sat down to tell them the story until I was interviewed by the -- by the\nmuseum.",
        "A: Well, you know, for many, many years after the war, I was always dreams. I used to\ndream a lot about my father and just wake up screaming like -- I saw him as how he\ndisappeared, you know? I -- I -- I used to dream about the bombing. I -- I used to -- to\ndream about suddenly finding myself alone, you know, nobody\u2019s there but me, I\u2019m alone.\nI-I-I mean, you know, a lot of these things. But then, it wasn\u2019t already dreams, it\u2019s reality,\nevery day, see? Every day, there is something that reminds me of my past. So, although I\ndon\u2019t have as many dreams as I used to have, I am constantly reminded by different\nthings that I come across.",
        "A: Well, the story with my cat who was killed while walking behind me. And so I\nalways, when I see a -- a Persian cat, 1-1t bothers me, you know, 1-it really -- tears come to\nmy eyes, because I always keep thinking, was that bullet meant for me, or was it truly\nmeant for my cat? And then, why should a cat be killed? He did nothing. I -- So, I -- I\nwould just walk and -- and -- and -- and I'll say to myself, \u201cOh, he looks just like my cat,\nmy kitty.\u201d A-A-And then, I\u2019Il hear a -- a German Shepherd bark and that\u2019 lI -- it\u2019s like\nsuddenly I find myself -- I have to hide. Hey, but why am I hiding? I am in a free\ncountry. But that\u2019s the feeling I get. I-I-I see a fellow walking with that -- with that hat,\nthat cap, a little raise up front like the German soldiers -- not the ger -- the SS would wear\nand I -- and I'll say, \u201cOoh, is he one of them?\u201d I mean, 1-it\u2019s really crazy, but that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s what this war did to you. A -- A -- A barn, I -- Pll walk by, I mean, you know, on\nthe island, the houses and they have like little barns in the back and there goes the\nmemory to when we were hiding and then we had to jump from -- fro -- from the attic of\nthat barn and -- and run away because the Germans will -- while the Germans were\nbreaking the door to get in to get us. And w-we jumped down and we ran away. A-And\nit\u2019s, hey --",
        "A: Oh, yeah. That little dog. The reason why I -- I think of him a lot 1s the fact that he\nwas so good. Can you imagine a dog would not bark when he sees me climbing in, you\nknow? And I would lie down and he would lie on my legs to keep me warm, because I\nhad no blanket. I told you, remember I was walking with knee-highs? I had nothing to\ncover myself with. An-And the lady didn\u2019t know that I slept under her house with her\ndog. And this dog just was so smart. I would just climb in and lie down and he would\nright away lie down on my legs and keep me warm.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yeah, there is a reason, yeah. See, I only had one doll in my life and that was the doll\nthat my bro -- my father bought for me before the war. I had a beautiful doll, a big one.\nMy father took me to this store that sold only dolls. And he said to me, \u201cYou pick.\u201d And I\nwas So little, but I picked this doll from the shelf and the doll was bigger than I was. I\ncouldn\u2019t even carry the doll home, my sister had to carry it for me and the doll would sit\non the rocking chair in the living room. And this is the doll I took with me when we went\nto the ghetto, when we had to leave home. And of course, you know, after -- after the\npogrom, I never saw my doll again. After that, I never had a doll again, that was finished.\nBecause I think that with the war, my childhood went, okay? I-I think that the Holocaust\nkilled my childhood, but did not kill my spirit and did not kill, you know, the rest of my\nlife. I -- I\u2019m still alive an-and going strong. A-And then after what happened to my cat, I\nnever wanted one. I always think about my cat, but I never wanted one. And when I had\nmy little boy, my youngest son, a neighbor of mine had a -- a Siamese cat and the\nSiamese cat gave birth to little Siamese kittens and she said, \u201cFrima, you should have one\nfor your child. And I\u2019m giving it to you for nothing and you know how expensive they\nare and you know how good they are, [indecipherable].\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201cFine.\u201d So I got\none for my -- for my son. But, every so often, when I used to sit down and the cat would\njump into my lap and I would, you know, caress him and I -- I would think about my --\nmy Persian cat a-and then I gave it away and I -- and I really, you know, I don\u2019t want any\n-- any more, cause it\u2019s -- it was a horrible experience, and -- and I used, you know, to\ndream about my cat and always used to scream and 1-1t was really bad, it was very a -- for\na -- to a child it was terrible, you know, terrible shock, a-a-and -- and -- and the fact that -\n- that I let him die without even turning around looking at him or picking him up or --",
        "A: Sure. It was always -- no one should know you are Jewish. It\u2019s like you have some\nkind of a disease.

My sister was in Cuba and she did not make it to the\nwedding, but my brother was here, my aunts and my uncles and everybody was at the\nwedding and it was just very lovely.

        "A: An important part of survival.",
        "A: Well, you see, by believing that God will help you and that there\u2019s someone watching\nover you, that was a -- a tremendous help for a child to survive. Because, although I was -\n- you know, I had no mother with me, I had no one, I was alone, I knew God will help\nme. And I did my praying every night, as you know that my mother left me the hundred\nrubles, and after the second lady, the one who shaved my head because I was infested\nwith lice, because here and there, I didn\u2019t have a shower or a bath or anything like that\nand I slept with mice crawling over me. I -- I bought a cross for the hundred rubles. Now,\nI knew that the reason why I need the cross is in case I\u2019m stopped by someone and they\nwill accuse me of being a Jew, I can prove I\u2019m not, cause I wanted to live. But, I also\nknew that Christianity is not me. I\u2019m a Jew and I have my own prayers and I have to say\nthose prayers and I have to talk to God and he will help me. And that\u2019s exactly what I\ndid. Every night, when I climbed in, you know, in -- one, two o\u2019clock in the morning\nwhen I climbed in to my -- my -- my doggy, to sleep with, I would take off my cross and\nin Hebrew I would say my prayers, those prayers that my mother taught me when I was a\nlittle girl.",
        "A: Well, the prayers, it 1s called, Creat schma. It\u2019s a prayer before you go to sleep, okay?\nSo, I would say Creat schma. And then in the morning, when I would get up and -- and\nshake off the hay, because we slept -- the dog and I slept on the hay, okay? And I shake\noff the hay and -- and got myself, you know, straightened out, I should -- shouldn\u2019t look\nlike I c-come hiding from someplace, put my scarf on. I would say, Moday ani. Moday\nani 1s a Jew -- is a Hebrew prayer where I thank you God for -- that I\u2019m -- that I got up,\nthat I survived another day, that I\u2019m here. And then after that, I would put the cross on\nagain. Now, I knew the reason why I was wearing a cross, not because I was giving away\nmy belief, but because, if I\u2019m a Christian, I can survive. I will not be killed. Where, if I\u2019m\na Jew, I haven\u2019t got a chance.",
        "A: Yeah. I am a religious Jew. I remained religious all through the Holocaust, after the\nHolocaust, the way I am now. And I -- I truly feel, and that is my -- my very deep belief\nthat there was and there is someone above me who guided me to do all these things that I\ndid to survive. I was only five years old and I acted as if I was someone of 50. And I was\nsix year old, I did things like a six year old person. So, there\u2019s got to be s -- a power over\nme, making me do things. Giving me that -- that -- that intelligence. I mean, I -- I -- I look\nat my grandchild, five years old and I say, \u201cOh my God, Oh my God. Please God,\u201d and I\nalways pray to God, \u201cMay -- May no child know of -- of -- of such horrors.\u201d But they\ncould never survive, because they never think the way I thought. Now, did I think\nbecause I was a genius? No, it\u2019s because there\u2019s something that I can not explain. But I\nfeel it. So, with the sad life and the hard life and the disappointments in life, I always feel\nthat I\u2019m rewarded by God. I really do. And I always thank God for everything. After the\nmeals, I thank God. When I light my candles, I thank God. Whatever there is, I always\npray, but when I pray, I really pray with my heart. And I -- And I -- And I remember wh-\nwh-when I was that little girl, that five, six year old girl and -- and I was all alone, I never\nfelt alone. I always felt that there\u2019s someone watching over me. A-A-And this is\nsomething that\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s extremely important to a child. Not to feel alone. Yeah, I\nwas frightened, but I always knew that there\u2019s a salvation, you know? Because I was\npraying, because I was talking and -- and, you know, to God. And -- And this 1s -- That\u2019s\na wonderful way of surviving.",
        "A: Unfortunately, yes. And you can not blame those people, no. Cause they went -- the\nhorrors were -- are absolutely -- you can\u2019t understand the horrors. I-I-I-It -- Your mind\njust can not absorb or understand that such a thing exists, and -- and -- and someth -- and\none human does it to another and -- and the victim did nothing. Simply because he is a\nJew? So what does it mean? It -- Because a Jew? What is it, no good? What are we -- are\nwe -- am I diseased? A-Am I -- Di-Did I kill someone? Why such hatred? Why such\nhostility? Crime. I mean, so much. Y-You probably heard it, that when we were standing\nar -- I mean, I don\u2019t know if you want to hear it, when we were standing on line to be\nkilled, the first pogrom, a-and we were 1n like maybe two or three people ahead of us, we\nwere all in line, you know, with our underwear only, waiting to be killed. We had those\nkilling squads. There was a mother holding a little baby, right? And this German walks\nover to her, a-and wants to take the baby away from her. She wouldn\u2019t let him. And there\nwas a whole struggle going on and I\u2019m standing there in shock. I didn\u2019t know wha -- a --\na -- a-- I didn\u2019t believe my own eyes, I-I mean -- so, you\u2019re talking about a five year old\nkid standing there and watching that -- this German is trying to take the baby away from\nthe mother and the mother wouldn\u2019t let. So he pulls the baby towards him and she pulls\nthe baby towards her, right? There\u2019s how. Finally, he got the baby out of her arms, pi-\npicks up his -- his -- his leg, yeah, with those boots up there and breaks the baby\u2019s back\nand gives it back to the ba -- to the mother.

There\u2019s a\nmillion and a half children slaughtered for nothing and nobody tried to help them. That\u2019s\nwhat I\u2019m angry about. Has nothing to do with religion or not religion. Just as a human\nbeing, how could you not try to do something? Maybe -- M-Maybe they -- they couldn\u2019t\nsaved everyone, but some?

And the United States didn\u2019t want to let them in. A handful of people, 900\npeople they didn\u2019t want to let them in and then, when they went to Cuba, Cuba said,\n\u201cHey, the United States 1s not letting them in, why should I bother?\u201d They are a little,\nsmall country.

        "A: I heard of them, but there is no comparisons. No comparisons whatsoever. The\nconcentration camps that the Germans built, nobody builds concentration camps like they\ndo. And the atrocities that they committed, no one that I know of today, does what they\ndid then. Now, concentration camp might have different meanings, see? The\nconcentration camps of the Chinese people here, that the one you\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: Japanese, oh, okay, was a camp where the people, because of the war with Japan, the\ngovernment wanted to make sure that these people do not commit terrorism and\ntherefore, it was a camp for people to concentrate. But there were no killings, there were\nno atrocities. There were no starvation. There were no beatings. There were no ripping\napart human -- person apart. Or pulling his a -- eyes out or pulling his teeth out or ripping\nhim to pieces w-while he\u2019s alive and burning him to death. So, how can we compare a\nUnited States camp, which is a camp just to make sure that these people do not commit\nterrorism, compared to a concentration camp -- a German concentration camp where\nthere -- the idea was to annihilate people. To get rid of them as quickly as possible and to\ndo a lot of -- what do we call it, experiments. Do you know that they -- they used the skin\nto make lampshades? And -- And some other things?",

And -- And it just doesn\u2019t matter to me if I\u2019m dealing with a person from\nany nationality. I-It just doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s just the fact that I want to help and it\u2019s the\nright thing to do. It\u2019s to help another human being, cause we all belong to God and we all\nhis children and we should help each other. And so, as hard as my life was -- but there\nwere some of those good Gentile people that helped me. So, I-I never thought otherwise,\nthis how I\u2019m supposed to be and this is how every person should be. And -- And you\nprobably heard or maybe I didn\u2019t mention to you, that when we came back, you know,\nafter the war, after liberation, we came back home an-and remember I told you there was\na Gentile man that, when I was alone and I was starved and I needed food, I -- I went to\nhim and I told him I was hungry, so he offered me a glass of milk, a piece of black bread\nand a piece of pork. And I, as a Jew, in whose house we had no pork, I had the milk, I\nhad the bread, but I wouldn\u2019t touch the pork. And I never told him why, cause I\u2019m not\nsupposed to tell him. I just eat what he gave me and I thanked him and I loved him for it.\nAlso, the first pogrom, when we ran away, we met in his house, you know, we are\nsupposed to an-and we did, we met in his house an-and he let us stay overnight in his\ncellar and I remember the rats were running all over us, but we stayed at night there.\nNow, when we came back -- after liberation we came back home, we were notified by his\nwife that the Russian government wants to put him in jail because he was -- he was an\ninformant and -- yeah, he was an informant and we don\u2019t really know what happened,\nwhat he did, because we were in Romania, right? So, we don\u2019t know what happened\nhere. But I remember that he was good to us and his wife said, \u201cIf you child will go to\ncourt and tell them how he treated you and your family, they will let him go, he won\u2019t\nhave to go to jail.\u201d Well, I did. My mother took me to court and I remember it was a\nround room. And in the middle there was a chair and I climbed on the chair and I stood\nand told them that this man saved my life, because I was starved and he gave me food to\neat. And the night that we had no place where to go, we came to him and he let us -- and\nthey let him free. So, you see, when somebody does good for you, you learn something\nfrom it and you try to do the same.",

I\nhave a Yugoslavian neighbor, an Italian neighbor, a Jewish neighbor, another Italian\nneighbor and I love them. And we get along so well. And why not? That\u2019s how is has to\nbe.

I was a little nothing and my dau -- my sister was 10 years\nolder than I was, so she was still a child. So, my mother had to use all this. Then, the first\npogrom, I-I -- I told you, when -- when the Germans were taking off the jewelry,\nwhatever the -- the women or the men wo-wore, jewelry, rings, 1-1f you didn\u2019t take it off\nby yourself quick enough and they wanted the ring, they would rip it off with your finger.\nAnd -- And if -- And if you didn\u2019t take off your earrings fast enough, they would rip off,\nyou know, the ear or the loop -- or the loop where -- which -- which you were -- with --\nwith that earring.

So it\u2019s like --\nWell, actually, I live with it every day, even if I don\u2019t talk about it. As I walk the streets,\nif I hear a German Shepherd bark, right away it goes back to what happened to me in the\npast.

And so, as\nthey were coming, there was the tremendous noise. And at the airport here, I can hear it\ntoo, and I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t understand why this -- you know, why this noise comes\nfrom the airport.

        "A: Well, after liberation, we were, at that time in occupied Romania, okay? Okay? We\nwere in occupied Romania, but then, after the liberation, we went back to the Ukraine\nand this is where we stayed. This is where my home was, once upon a time.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No. We were never able to talk about the Holocaust. She would talk about it, and you\nknow, not much. It -- I think what happened is, remember I mentioned to you that when\nwe came to Cuba, after -- after the war, after we left Germany, and we went to Cuba\nbecause my mother had one of her sisters living there. Actually, we were supposed to\ncome into the United States, but because there was a delay and my mother somewheres\nheard that there\u2019s going to be a World War Three, and she became panicky, she wanted\nto get out of Europe. So she wrote to her sister and her sister quickly made out the papers,\nand we came to Cuba. When we came to Cuba, my aunts from the United States, also\ncame to Cuba, to greet 1s when we arrived, which was wonderful, and was a beautiful,\nsunny day. It really was gorgeous. And my mother wanted to tell them about our\nexperience, about her experience and -- and everything that we went through, and all they\nsaid is, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about it. It\u2019s finished with, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s passe. Now you\u2019re in a\nfree country, you\u2019re with your family, you have nothing to fear, and we don\u2019t tal -- you\ndon\u2019t tal -- you don\u2019t -- you shouldn\u2019t be talking about it because there\u2019s nothing to talk\nabout, finished.\u201d So, I guess, after that, she was sort of, you know, she wouldn\u2019t talk\nabout it much. But occasionally, I would hear her say, remember, you know, \u201cRemember\nFrima, remember?\u201d I do. I do remember very much. So we never really sat and spoke\nabout it. It\u2019s like she remembered her life and I remembered my life. And -- A-And --\nAnd also, I remember distinctly that -- 1-in those days -- I mean, you\u2019re talking about\nwhat, 40 years ago, or 50 years ago? It was something that if we did -- if she said,\n\u201cRemember this?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes,\u201d I would start crying right away. So, it was\nsomething that you just couldn\u2019t talk about it. Besides, it was always in my mind you\u2019re\nnot supposed to talk about it, because it\u2019s already past. So, we didn\u2019t really discuss it, we\ndidn\u2019t really talk about it.",
        "A: No, I-I-I-I think -- I mean, my aunts were loving, loving aunts, and I had a loving\nfamily. I think they just didn\u2019t want my mother to get upset every time she talks about it.\nCause there was a lot to be upset about. I mean, we lost a big family, including my father,\na grandmother, a -- aunts, uncles, cousins. We lost a lot of people, so I -- I think that this\nmust have been the reason why they said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it. You\u2019re in the free\ncountry now, you understand? It\u2019s finished, it\u2019s gone and you\u2019re safe with us.

        "A: That -- Well, 1-1t, you know, everything is possible. I never really asked them why,\nyou know. But, as I said, because I know that they cared a lot about us, maybe they didn\u2019t\nwant to hear the horrors, and the true of the matter 1s, there were a lot of horrors. I mean,\nfrightening things. It\u2019s just like I was afraid to tell my children when they were little,\nbecause I didn\u2019t want them to think that this is what\u2019s going to happen to them. So, I\ndidn\u2019t tell my children anything.

We ignore, and we have them right here, in the United States, in this beautiful,\nfree country, we giving everyone freedom, including the terrorist, the criminals. And all\nthese groups, we ignoring them. But little by little, they are just getting bigger and bigger,\nand we don\u2019t know what the future will bring, how they will react. Because that\u2019s how it\nstarted in Germany, with Hitler. He was a nobody, and then he suddenly became a\nsomebody.

        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well, simply because I think that children will be able to learn an awful lot from my\nexperience. Since I was such a little girl and I had a -- I think it was quite an imagination,\nto be able to survive, alone, without a mother, without any family, thinking and always\nbeing a step ahead of my enemy. That, I think, would give the children who will get to\nread the book, you know, the strength, perhaps intelligence too, that hopefully they are\nnever in trouble, but if they are, they can think that they can do certain things to survive,\nand not panic and think, well, you know, there\u2019s nothing they can do. Yes, they can do,\nbecause if they learn, a -- they can remember. And by remembering, you -- you know,\nyou react differently. Like when you don\u2019t know anything, you don\u2019t know. Today I look\nat -- at children five years old, or five and a half, or six, and I say to myself, \u201cOh my God,\nat their age, I already was hiding.\u201d I knew that no one is supposed to know that I am a\nJew. Yet, I knew, that in order to fool others, they should think that I\u2019m not Jewish, I\nwore a big cross, okay?

That she\u2019s not supposed to know,\nbecause if she would know, she would -- certainly wouldn\u2019t let me sleep under her house,\nbecause she was afraid.

And so we were completely undressed, except for the panties -- underwear.\nBut, when we got to the slaughterhouse, where they did the killing, the mass killing, a-\nand my mother spoke to this SS person, asking him if they kill Ukrainians, too. And she\ngave him the whole story, that she was on her way with her two girls, to this town, which\n-- which was not too far from where the killing wa -- was going on, to see her husband,\nwho was in jail. And he believed her, and then he put us inside the slaughterhouse, we\nshould wait until he brings in a translator, a Ukrainian translator. And then, after he told\nthe translator to take us back to the city, we needed clothing, we were naked. So, he took\nmy sister, told my sister to go outside, and they had mountains, hills of clothing, from\neverybody else. And so she picked whatever she thought would fit me, herself and my\nmother. And so, this is what I was wearing, which was a pair of boots, short boots. And I\nhad knee highs, a little sir -- short skirt, a sweater and a little jacket and a scarf. This was\nmy clothing. And I remained with this clothing until the end of the war, which was from\n\u201941, that\u2019s right, okay? \u201941, so when we were -- the second time in the ghetto, of course\nmy mother washed it, you know, and cleaned it, okay? But, after I was on my own, the\nsix months, I never took it off. I slept this way, and I wore it during the day, cause I had\nnothing else to wear. You have -- I had no place to take a shower or a bath. So that\u2019s how\nit was. Unfortunately, 1f you remember I told you, that although I stayed with the lady for\ntwo weeks, I was infested with lice. And that 1s because the only time that I got a bath is\nwhen my mother brought me in two weeks before. So that day, sh -- that evening, she\ngave me a bath. But then, the other two weeks that I stayed with her, she didn\u2019t give me a\nbath. So, I became infested with lice. And so, when she ask me to leave her house, I\nwalked out, and I went to our friend\u2019s, which we used to visit every so often. We bought\nour house from them, and I remembered where my mother u -- my mother, my father,\nwhen we used to go visiting them, and I would walk the same way, they were on the\nother end of the city, I -- you know, I don\u2019t remember exactly how long it took me to\nwalk. But I walked, and I -- you know, I -- I went to her and she realized that I was s -- I\nwas infested. So, in the winter -- it was already in the winter was very, very cold, she\ntook me into her barn, undressed me, took my clothes and hung it outside, so everything\ncan sort of freeze. And she shaved my head, and -- and she gave me a bath and she put\ncream over my head, because I had, you know, rashes. I had blood, abs -- just blood\nalready, dripping down my -- my head, because it was so itchy. And I stayed with her for\na week, and then she said I have to go. So, how did I survive? Well, I used to go every so\noften to our neighbors, Gentile neighbors, cause there were no Jews already, in the city.\nSo I would go to them, and they would give me bread, maybe potato soup, a glass of\nmilk. Sometimes they\u2019Il give me fruits. Now, this kept me going. So, I didn\u2019t go every\nday to them, you know, I couldn\u2019t be seen going to the same place all the time, because\nthen they\u2019Il be always someone who will detect, and feel, you know, that this must be a\nJewish kid. So I -- I -- this was always in my mind, I have to be very, very careful, and I\nwas. So whatever they gave me, I made sure that I just save enough to have until I go\nagain next week, or you know, or two weeks later. So, that\u2019s how | a -- and I -- I -- I\nalways tried to go to different neighbors, and one shouldn\u2019t know if, you know, that I\nwent to this one or that one. That\u2019s how I survived. Oh God.",
        "A: Never asked, no.",
        "A: Well, they knew that I am somewheres, right, but you see, they just, I imagine, didn\u2019t\nask, because there was nothing they could do about it. They would not ask me to stay\nwith them, because they were also afraid. So, if I came and I just -- could you give me --\nyou know, could you give me something to eat, do you have something? In fact, if I\nremember correctly, I don\u2019t remember even walking in into the house, but rather, staying\noutside in the back and they would bring something out to me. Do you understand? So, 1-\n1-1t was -- [ -- I -- I think it was quite frightening for them, you know, worrisome for them\nto -- to deal with something like this, because you know, they could not completely\nignore me, and they could not completely reject that I -- if I\u2019m asking for food, so they\ngave me the food, which was -- that was very nice. If not for them, where would I be\ngoing to eat? I couldn\u2019t go to strangers. But if you -- I don\u2019t know if I mentioned that last\ntime, one day, it\u2019s been awhile and I had no food, and here I\u2019m walking, you know, on\none of the avenues, and there\u2019s a restaurant and it has a very big window, a glass\nwindow, and people are sitting and eating and I\u2019m so hungry. I -- I imagine -- I -- I -- it\nmust have been I didn\u2019t have enough food, really, left. So I\u2019m standing at that window\nand I\u2019m -- I\u2019m looking in and I see there\u2019s people sitting, there\u2019s one seat available, by\nthe counter. So, I walked in, and I just went over and I sat down. And I\u2019m sitting down\nnext to a gentleman, a -- I don\u2019t know him. A-And the young lady, the waitress, came\nover and asked me what I wanted. Well, you know, I always remember that I\u2019m not\nsupposed to eat things that are not kosher. So, I asked her for potato soup. So, potato\nsoup has nothing, it\u2019s just water and potatoes, and carrots maybe, maybe. And so, she\nwas -- she thought that I was together with this man. So, of course, she served me, she\nbrought me th-the -- the potato soup, and I finished eating it, and she came over and she\nsaid, \u201cYou -- You\u2019re paying? Are you paying?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any money.\u201d\nWhich I didn\u2019t, because the hundred rubles that my mother left me, I -- I bought myself a\ncross, so I can fool everyone. So -- And I started crying. So, the gentleman just took the\nbill from her, and he said nothing. I think he may -- maybe he realized that, you know, or\nmaybe he just thought I was an orphan, or maybe he just thought -- well, he couldn\u2019t\neven know -- he -- he couldn\u2019t really know that I was Jewish, because I had that big\ncross, and I made sure that everybody sees it, okay? And then, I don\u2019t look Jewish either.\nSo, he must have thought, you know, this kid is just an orphan from somewheres,\nwhatever, and -- and he just said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay,\u201d and I was crying, and I just\nwalked out crying. But at least I had the soup, and I had the potato -- I mean, the potato\nsoup, which was -- I don\u2019t know how long it lasted me, but that\u2019s how I managed. But,\nyou see, so children can learn.",

I mean, you\nknow, maybe they were on different streets, but as -- again, as I told you before, at that\ntime, the city didn\u2019t have already, any Jews, because they had already a second pogrom.\nThat means they finished off the rest of the Jews that they did not kill in \u00b041. See, we had\n-- There was a pogrom in for -- in 41, and then in \u201942, a second one. So, at that time\nalready, maybe there was, you know, hiding here and there, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone, so\n-- that I know or -- or suspect, or anything like that.

Although he knew that there is -- that there\nwere dangerous times and he\u2019s in a dangerous place, but yet he had his father there. I had\nno one. I was alone.

That\u2019s something\nlike my -- my happening, you know? When I saw my mother, that was very nice.

Rubbles inside. I crawl we -- went in there, I lied down. I just, you\nknow, sort of he-held onto myself, and in order to stay warm, I blew the -- my -- my --\nmy -- my breathing. I -- I blew in my air into the sweater that I was wearing, so I can stay\nwarm through the night, cause that was winter. And the winters in Europe are brutal.

And I would shake everything off, and put on my scarf, and I --\nI did my praying and I put on the cross, and I walked out nobody should see me, and I\nstarted walking the streets.

It\u2019s just we are not paying that much attention to them, cause we are giving\nthem freedom. And sometimes too much freedom for criminals, you know what happens.\nWe pay, later on, a price. Now, the bombing of -- of -- of the Twin Towers, there\u2019s an\nexample. We\u2019re letting 1n terrorists to this country. We\u2019re giving them freedom, we\u2019re\ngiving them ho -- a home, we giving them everything, and look what we get in return.",
        "A: For what?",
        "A: That 1 -- That -- That is correct, but no, no, no, no, the United States, I\u2019m sure, has\nenough of intelligence to know -- the ones that are terrorists, did things before, maybe in\na different country, not exactly in the United States. So, we are not really checking out\nthe people that are coming into this country, unfortunately, okay?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm --",
        "A: -- right, right.",
        "A: What could the government do about that? Well, first of all, I think we have -- there\u2019s\ntoo much freedom in getting arms in this country. If you have the money, you can get it,\nand that\u2019s number one, so right away, they should stop this, okay? And number two, even\nthe citizens here, the ones that go out to get arms, the government should know what for\nand -- and give them a certain -- even -- and they have to be checked up. I think that those\npeople that apply for arms should be checked out first, and then given a certain period of\n-- and then, you know, you have to keep an eye on certain people also. It\u2019s -- I-It\u2019s not\neasy, but we don\u2019t seem to be doing anything about it. It\u2019s really -- there are -- the arms\nhere are free for all. Any kid, any youngster, any terrorist, any anybody can just go in and\nget -- you know, get a gun or get a rifle or whatever. And, you know, it should be a little\nbit stricter. It\u2019s true, it\u2019s a democratic country, and it\u2019s, I think to me, it\u2019s the most -- the\ngreatest country in the world, but it\u2019s also frightening for me, even though I live ina\ndemocratic, free, beautiful country, why am I always afraid, why am I always worried?\nBecause I see what\u2019s going on and it\u2019s -- shouldn\u2019t be that way. What can the government\ndo? They can do. They just see -- sort of ignore it.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah, I\u2019ve been aware of all these three wars, yeah. Well, what about\nEichmann? Well, there\u2019s a lot of these butchers that got away and were never caught.\nThey lied to this country and they came into this country and they lived in this country,\nsome of them. Of course, most of them probably died by now. But yet, they live a very\ngood life here, after butchering millions of people, okay? So that\u2019s because our country 1s\nso wonderful, they just let them in and they made up stories, right? And we let them in,\nwe never checked out on them, and that was that. As far as the wars 1n Israel, it\u2019s very sad\nthat a little country like this, with a handful of people, especially in those days, had to\nfight so many armies, from all different fronts, and yet I look at it as a miracle.",
        "A: The miracle that they always beat the -- their neighbors. And they won most of these\nwars, even though -- even that war in -- in \u201973, that Yom Kippur, when they were\nattacked. It turned around and -- but of course, they won the war, but never peace. That\u2019s\ndifferent things and that\u2019s very, very sad. As far as today, I feel that nobody should mix\nin, into their politics and the people of the state of Israel should decide, you know, which\npresident is good for them, prime minister, or what they should do with their neighbors,\nhow to find peace. And there\u2019s no one in this world that wants peace more than they do,\nbecause there isn\u2019t a family that hasn\u2019t lost a child, a husband, an uncle, a -- a -- a sister, a\nbrother. I mean, they are constantly losing people, and really --",
        "A: Huh? Yeah, I\u2019m discussing the -- yeah, and I\u2019m discussing that nobody should force\nthem to do anything, because nobody really knows their situation better than they do\nthemselves. And as long as they don\u2019t ask for help, then the United States should not mix\nin. They should leave them alone and they -- and they shouldn\u2019t be peace -- a land for\npeace, they should be peace for peace. There\u2019s no such thing as land for peace.",
        "A: Land, land. Like the president says, \u201cGive them -- Give the Arabs more land, and\nthere\u2019ll be peace.\u201d No, no, no, no. It has to be peace for peace. That means the Arabs\nhave to want peace, so there\u2019s going to be peace. You can give them land, no matter how\nmuch land you'll give them. But they obviously don\u2019t want peace [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, what I think is they want Israel to move out of the Middle East. That\u2019s what I\nthink, because Israel is the only democratic country there. Everybody else is the same\nreligion, the same background. So they just don\u2019t want Israel there. What they don\u2019t\nfremfa -- what they don\u2019t want to remember is that Israel was there since beginning of\ntime, and they\u2019Il remain there. So nobody in this world should mix in and tell the Israeli\ngovernment what to do, but let them and the people decide what to do. And when it\ncomes to peace, nobody wants it more than the Israel -- the Israelis.",
        "A: We\u2019ll just add to, you know, the Israel\u2019s situation, as far as peace is concerned. You\nsee, I feel that the Arab countries, if they would only stop teaching the young children in\nschool about Israel being their enemy and the hatred that they have for the Israelis, or the\nJewish people in general, or the state of Israel, I think that there would be peace very\nquickly, because I imagine and I feel that the young people don\u2019t want wars either. But, if\nthey in -- they are taught since they\u2019re very little, that that -- you know, the hostility\ntowards Israel, so how can they grow up wanting peace? How can there be peace if they\nhate their next door neighbor? They don\u2019t want to tolerate a next door neighbor. So, it --\nit bothers me that we are -- that the young generation of the Arab world 1-1s -- is already\ngrowing up with hatred, and -- and -- and -- and hostility against the neighbor. And\nmaybe, hopefully, I would like to see someday that they should change their books, and\nthe way they teach those youngsters.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Ma -- Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. See, hatred won\u2019t get you anywheres.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Unfortunately, unfortunately, if somebody would like to go to Israel and pick up the\nbooks that the children learn from, okay, and a -- how they\u2019re taught about their next\ndoor neighbor, and then go to the Arab countries, and look at their textbooks, you will\nsee the difference. And --",
        "A: I\u2019ve -- People have told me about it, okay? So, there is a difference, and -- and this is\nwhy I feel very strongly, that as long as the children are taught hatred towards another\nnation, they ca -- there can never be peace. Because, you know, that\u2019s -- they grow up\nwith -- always feeling that their next door neighbor is whatever, you know, and I don\u2019t\nwant to deal with him, and -- so, when the president, you know, when President Clinton\nthinks that, give them land, you can give them anything you want. If they hate you, they\nwill hate you no matter what. If they don\u2019t want you there, it doesn\u2019t matter what you\ngive them, unless you give them the whole country, period. And that\u2019s something that -- I\ndon\u2019t see peace in the future, unless there\u2019s a change in politics.",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: Well, I think they know, and I certainly hope they do, and they should. And I feel that\nwe, in -- in this country, and perhaps all over the world, we waited also a little bit too\nlong, you know, to teach our children, in their schools, about the Holocaust. I really don\u2019t\nknow why it took them so long. Maybe because we were all in denial. I mean, it\u2019s\npossible. Like, I -- I didn\u2019t talk to my children, you know, about it. Maybe this is what all\nthe parents did, they were all afraid, not to scare their children about it. But, I-I think the\nbooks are very important, because I think that now, in the 21* century, I think they heard\nquite a bit about it, and -- and -- and -- and them -- they\u2019re probably going to be a lot of\nbooks, and it\u2019s like every survivor has a story, every survivor could write a book, because\nhis experience were different, his horrors that he went through were different. And the\nchildren can learn from that. I mean, they will learn frightening things, but on the other\nhand they will also learn as to how to -- to survive and -- and -- and how to handle\nsituations and how to try to make this world a better world -- place to live.",
        "A: No, no. There must be some, but not really --",
        "A: No. I work now in a mental health clinic. Well, you know, the children that come\nthere have different problems. It\u2019s mental health problems and it\u2019s not because of the\nHolocaust. It\u2019s unfortunate, because these children don\u2019t have a father, and some of them\nare in foster homes. I-I-It\u2019s very sad. And they all -- breaks my heart, really. It\u2019s -- It\nbreaks my heart when I see those children, this one\u2019s in a foster home, this one doesn\u2019t\nhave a father, this one is being abused by the father, this one\u2019s being abused by the\nmother. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s -- It\u2019s just very painful and I really wish that somehow in -- 1n this\nUnited States, the minorities, the ones that -- that don\u2019t have fathers, that they would have\na family life. There\u2019s no family life, and I think this is what affects the children. And you\nsee, they are really lost souls. They are frightened, they are -- they -- they -- they don\u2019t\nknow what to do, they don\u2019t know how to cope with life. So, if they would read my book,\nI think they would get well, to realize that at this station -- you know, at -- at this age, I\nwas able to do things which they never think of doing.",
        "A: I never did. And I tell you the reason. Because I would probably start crying. I still\ncry. I-I mean, it\u2019s just I -- I start talking, I\u2019m reliving situations and -- and -- and I know I\njust wouldn\u2019t be a very good speaker. I would just have to stop in the middle and -- and\nthat\u2019s not exactly what a speaker should do. As strong as I was, you know, I\u2019m different,\na little bit different now. I really live in the past a little bit, or a lot.",
        "A: Well, you see, the past never really left me, or maybe I didn\u2019t leave -- leave the past.\nThat means, everything that -- in my daily living, are constantly memories of what\nhappened. There isn\u2019t a day that goes by where I don\u2019t -- wat -- see something that\nreminds me of what happened to me 50 years ago, 55 years ago. For example, certain\nhomes look like a barn. You know, like they\u2019re very tall and -- and those windows, or\nwhatever. Well, if I pass one of those, that reminds me when I was only five and a half\nand we were hiding in our barn. You know, we were hiding from the Germans. And then,\nyou know what happened. This neighbor of ours would bring us, once a day she would\nbring us food. And then one day somebody must have seen her do it, and they called the -\n- the SS, and they followed her while she was walking, bringing us food, and she started\nyelling to us, \u201cSave yourselves, save yourselves,\u201d and we were, you know, o -- 1-1n -- 1n\nthe attic of the barn, and so my mother and sister, in the back, you know, everything is\nwooden, you know, panels, broke two wooden panels, and we jumped like two stories\ndown and we ran and we escaped. So, when I look at this barn, 1t reminds me as to what\nhappened 55 years ago. If I see a German Shepherd, that really kills me.",

So no, I don\u2019t think I could\never -- and I\u2019m very broadminded, really, but a-a-and I know that today\u2019s generation had\nabsolutely nothing to do, you know, with the past generation, yet and all, I couldn\u2019t talk\nbecause it would bring back memories. Just by looking and saying, well that person\ncomes from the country that took away my loved ones. So, I\u2019d rather not -- not have any\nconnection.",
        "A: Well, that is a little different, cause the German Jews had nothing to do with the\nHolocaust. Unfortunately, they were so -- they felt so secure in Germany before World\nWar Two, that unfortunate, they were hit just as bad with the Holocaust, as the European\nJew. Same thing happened to them. So, you know, it\u2019s two different things. Talking to\nsomeone whose grandparents we-were involved in -- in my -- in my life, and talking\nabout a German Jew, who went through almost the same as the European Jew. So it\u2019s two\ndifferent things, you know?",
        "A: Mostly he -- Believe it or not, he talks mostly, about his experience. You know, he --\nhe was born in Germany, and -- and at the age of nine, my mother-in-law, you know, in\nthir -- that was in \u201939, she realized that it\u2019s going to -- it -- the situation is very bad, and\nthe sooner they get out of Germany, the better off they are. And my father-in-law was\nalready, at that time in labor camp. So the only -- the only way for my mother-in-law to\nget her husband out of the labor camp, is to get a visa and get out of the country. So, she\nwent through quite a bit, traveling all over the united s -- all over Germany, to try and get\na visa, to get out of the country, and finally they got a visa to go to Shanghai. And so he\nhas quite an experience himself, you know, specially the Kristallnacht. So, he usually\ntalks about it, and I listen.",

        "A: You understand? Yeah. So I think th -- I -- I think that the reason why it\u2019s easier for\nme to talk with a stranger about the Holocaust, 1s because I want the world to know. And\nthe reason, I think, why I do not discuss it with my family, I mean, you know, really\nsitting down and talk about it, although my children did watch the tape, is because A, I\nknow my husband went through his share of experiences, like starvation, you know. So,\nhe went through his own, and I just don\u2019t think he needs any more from my side, do you\nunderstand? Knowing from my side. I-I think maybe that\u2019s the reason.",
        "A: In a certain way, I think so. I think that -- that must be the reason. This 1s why I can sit\nwith you and I can talk and tell you my life, where I just don\u2019t get to do that -- my\nhusband or anybody else in the family.",

And my house was always a house where my mother\nalways did for the needy. She always did things for people. So, I guess, to me that was\nvery natural.

        "A: Oh yes. Sure, of course. Well, the HIAS, in -- in Germany, they used to give us\nclothing. I mean, when we got there, we had nothing, you know, there\u2019s -- was still the\nsame -- the same clothing that we had from -- you know, from -- from the -- the pogroms.\nSo, they would give us clothing, and -- and food. That\u2019s that. I mean, that was very good.\nAnd, you know, we had a school, so we went -- I went to school. They did a lot and so\ndid the Joint.

It was certainly appreciated, everything, until, you\nknow, when I -- when I became an adult, I first realized how much effort these\norganizations put in, how -- how much of hard work, to get clothing, to get food,\nmedicine, you know, necessary things for people who were in need.

The picture of my father is\nthe day of their wedding, and the tie that he is wearing at their wedding, on their wedding\nday, is the tie that I am holding in my hand now, which 1s about 70 - 75 years later, that --\nno, that\u2019s how old the tie is, and you can see it\u2019s -- it\u2019s ripped and torn, but it\u2019s still\nsomething to hold onto. And so, what I did is, my mother\u2019s picture was very t-torn and --\nand -- and -- and scratched and everything else, I gave this, the two pictures to a\nphotographer, and he put them together. Now, this picture is later on in life when -- when\nmy mother was already a mother, she had my brother at that time. So, my father looks so\nmuch younger here, because he was, you know, they were young when they got married,\nbut since it\u2019s put together -- but to me, it\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s the only picture that I have of the\ntwo of them, cause all the other pictures were just, you know, lost, or burned or whatever,\nI don\u2019t know whatever happened to them.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. They were both from -- from the Ukraine, and they were both from the\nsame town and my father was terribly handsome, and one of my granddaughters, when I\nlook at her, her eyes, I always see my father. And, as I mentioned before, I-I -- I do carry\na certain, I-I guess anger, cause my father swore to me that when I -- the evening that we\nwere supposed to escape from the ghetto, I wanted him to come with me --\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: See, would you -- would you --",
        "A: You want to put 1t now, or want me to hold it? Would you ever think that someone in\ntheir 60, would still cry, because --",
        "A: -- because my father disappointed me. I wanted him to go with me to escape from the\nghetto, and we could not escape together, I mean, the whole family together, so we really\nhad to separate. So I wanted to --",
        "A: Because a ghetto is something that is surrounded by barbed wire, with electrical wires\non top, with Germans and German shepherds watching you. And that means, in order to\nescape, if they see too many people, then they suspect that you are planning to do\nsomething, and they\u2019Il kill you on the spot. So, we had to do it, in order to escape, as\nindividually, where they will not suspect or think you might be doing something or trying\nto escape. So, I -- I wanted my father to go with me, and then -- and then my mother\nwould go on her own, then my sister would go on her own, so, you know, they -- they --\nnobody will suspect that we are -- not even the people that we lived with, you know,\nnobody\u2019s supposed to know. But he said, \u201cNo, you go with Mama.\u201d And I said, \u201cBut I\ndon\u2019t want to go, Papa.\u201d And he said, \u201cI swear, we should live to see your brother.\u201d\nCause, as you know, my brother was studying 1n Kiev, he was not with us during the war\ntimes -- war, you know, period. He said, \u201cWe should live to see your brother, I promise I\nwill -- I will escape, I will go. But you go with Mama first, and then I\u2019Il go, after.\u201d Well -\n- And -- And the way we escaped is, my mother and I, we went to a -- a secluded area of\nthe ghetto, and we climbed out from under the -- the barbed wires. I mean, you really --\nwe really had to be very, very low, not to trigger the electrical wiring.",
        "A: No. My mother, myself, nobody\u2019s supposed to know that we escaping, don\u2019t you\nundersta --",
        "A: No. She stayed with my father. Then, awhile later, she did the same thing, see?",
        "A: Alone, right. Well, she was already at that time, let\u2019s see, she was 16. I was six, she\nwas 16. And then -- then we made up where we going to meet, we were going to meet in\none of our friend\u2019s houses, Gentile -- Gentile friends that we had. And so, my mother and\nI, we got there, and then about an hour later, also, my sister got there. And we sat and\nwaited for my father, and he never showed up. And that was the last time I saw my\nfather, is when I insisted that he should come with me, and he said he ke -- \u201cYou go off\nwith Mama, and [ll -- Pll come later.\u2019 Well, he never made it. And then, after the war,\nyou know, when we came back, we were all asking if somebody saw my father. And\nsome of the neighbors said they saw him walking in the middle of the street with two SS\nmen, and that was that. And -- And -- And nobody ever saw him again.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, in my adult life, I -- I always felt that I have to face the world alone, that I\ncannot count on anyone, not even my children. That I must do it on my own. And many\ntimes, I was thinking I have a very good title for my book. Always alone, and a step\nahead of my enemy. But I always -- that\u2019s true, I always feel alone, like I -- I -- I -- I\nalways feel I can\u2019t count on anyone. I don\u2019t have a shoulder to cry on, I must cry alone, I\nmust do things alone, I must build alone, plan alone, everything alone. But I also feel\nthat, because I had to do these things alone when I was little, I certainly can do them\nalone now. That doesn\u2019t mean that it -- I don\u2019t get depressed. I do. But then I get back on\nmy feet again and I just keep going, cause I know just like I knew then, I cannot stop. I\ncannot stop in the middle of the street, I must keep on walking and walking. And you\nknow something else? Today, I cannot stay at home. I get up in the morning, and I can\u2019t\nwait to get out of the house. And I want to work and I\u2019m very busy at work, and I\u2019m very\nhappy at work. It\u2019s very stressful job, but that\u2019s a different story, a-and sometimes it\u2019s\nheartbreaking when you see those children with problems. And then when I leave work, I\ndon\u2019t go home, I\u2019m always busy in the street, doing things. And I always wonder if that is\nthe part of my past, where that\u2019s what I did in the morning. I got up, right? I -- I prayed, I\nshook off the hay, I put my scarf on, my cross on and out I went for the whole day and\nthen came back at night, when everybody was already sleeping. I think that\u2019s part of my\npast. And that\u2019s what I do today, I can\u2019t stay home. Always on the go, always moving,\nlike a Gypsy.",
        "A: Yeah. And I always said, I always feel alone, and that -- that is -- you know, I just\nnever thought about it until you brought it up right just now. Yeah. Very much a\nconnection with my past.",
        "A: Maybe a -- Maybe I feel that he could never understand. Because, you see, when I was\nalone, I made my own decisions. And -- A-A-And I -- I felt sure about the decisions. See,\n[ -- I never doubt it. I had to do something, I just went ahead and I did it. It -- It\u2019s not that\nI was thinking or shivering, or -- or being afraid. I-I -- I knew one thing, there\u2019s no two\nways about it. This is what I have to do, this is what I have to do. And I told you -- I think\nI told you, that once during the times that I was walking the streets, I walked twice on the\nsame block, and I heard two boys saying to each other, \u201cSh -- Maybe she\u2019s Jewish.\u201d\nMaybe -- Maybe she\u2019s Jewish? I never walked that street again. Now, nobody told me\nthat, I decided. So, in my life now -- if at the age of six, I was able to make decisions and\nthink -- I think it was an intelligent thinking, then I certainly can do it now. So I said,\nalthough sometimes I -- sometimes I feel depressed because I feel I am alone, cause I\ncan\u2019t count on anyone, because I cannot depend on anyone, because I-I -- I can\u2019t lean on\nanyone. When I look back, I did it then, and I say, I can do it now, too. And that\u2019s how I\nkeep going, ooh, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: lam -- 1am a -- a giver, but again, I -- I am a giver, obviously because I saw my\nmother give, okay? Cause how else did I learn? I mean, from whom, you know? So, I am\na giver and I enjoy giving and I do have lots of love, for everybody. Lots of love for\nhumanity. But, you say receiving? Yes, I would like someone to -- to listen to my life. I\nmean, you know, someone close in my life, to listen to my life. But then it\u2019s just not\nmaterializing, so I just let it go.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Ask you, right. So you ask me and I give you -- you know, I can give you --",
        "A: Maybe they don\u2019t, and maybe they just are busy with their own lives. You know, their\nlives are so busy, with their families and their children, that really, parents come in\nsecondary. And that -- that is -- that is a fact. And my question is, would I want it\ndifferent? I do want that their wives and their children come first. Yeah, it would be nice\nif they would come someday and say, \u201cMa, tell us, you know, what you went through\nwhen you were a little girl. Tell us about your life.\u201d And if they are not doing it, then\nobviously they don\u2019t have the necessity. And if they don\u2019t have the necessity, why would\nI want to add more responsibilities and thoughts than what they have today? Tho, let him\nbe happy, and Ill be happy. But the only problem is, remember I keep saying? I never\nfeel free. I\u2019m always thinking of, I hope nothing happens, I hope nothing happens. And,\nwill it ever go away? I don\u2019t know. Now, I think even more, because I have my\ngrandchildren, and I do want my grandchildren to live in a beautiful world, with peace\nand -- and enjoy, because the world is beautiful, and there are so many beautiful people.\nIt just that there is also a lot not such beautiful people, who might just harm you. And it\u2019s\nalways in back of my mind. So, all I do is, I do a lot of praying. Remember, I told you I\npray for peace on earth, which I think is very important and peace in Israel, and oh --",
        "A: Well it would be nice, I would like that very much. Yeah, I would, you see, so if they\nwould ask me, I would tell them. Cause I think they can learn a lot from my -- you know,\nfrom my experience, but on the other hand, maybe -- maybe they would be upset, or\nmaybe it would frighten them. Maybe it\u2019s -- won\u2019t be so good for them, you know, e-\nevery person 1s an individualist, and -- and -- and can take things differently.",
        "A: No, he probably does not, cause he lives in a different world, he lives in a world of his\nown. So he just doesn\u2019t think that others have necessities, and he\u2019s just, you know, he just\nhas his own world. And sometimes I think we\u2019re in two different worlds, but listen, we\ncan\u2019t have everything, so I don\u2019t expect everything from everybody.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s me, right. That\u2019s me, and I take care and I give without expecting\nanything in return. Although s -- I -- it would be nice, it would make me very happy if --\nif there would be such a thing as Frima, here is my shoulder. That would feel very good,\nbecause I never had anyone giving me a shoulder, or -- you know, or being there for me,\nor helping me, you know, to cope. I -- I had to learn on my own, how to do it, so I had a\nlesson. Unfortunately that lesson was when I was a little girl. That\u2019s what I learned.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I think so. I mean, I -- I feel that beside, that this will give me a chance,\nreally, maybe, to get it off my chest, beside I -- I -- I also feel that besides getting it off\nmy chest, is also feeling that I can help others, you understand? I can transmit my\nstrength. I can transmit my knowledge, my experience, so they can be more careful in the\nfuture and nothing should happen to them, you know? Or, if things are bad, they know\nwhat to do, they\u2019 ll -- they\u2019Il just, you know, think, hey, she did it, I can do it. And that\nwould make me happy, knowing that I\u2019m helping other people, especially the younger\npeople, you know, to -- you know, to learn and to get the strength. It\u2019s very important to\nhave strength, and believe. I think prayer is a fantastic thing, it really is. It can really\nmake you very strong, and -- a-and very, you know, knowledgeable. I mean, to do things.\nCause when you feel that -- that somebody is there for you, you can move mountains.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yup. Well, I -- I don\u2019t mind getting support. It\u2019s good to know that you can lean on\nsomeone. It makes things just a little bit easier. Regardless if that someone can help you\nor not, it -- it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s good to feel you\u2019re sharing something with someone.\nBut again, when I look back to my childhood, I didn\u2019t get much then, so if I don\u2019t get\nmuch now, it\u2019s okay. I can survive, regardless.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, because when you believe in what you\u2019re praying, you have to believe,\nfirst of all, you have to believe. If you believe in what you\u2019re praying, then this is where\nyou get strength from, and this 1s where, you know, you are -- you are at peace with\nwhatever you do, because you know -- you feel you did it right.",
        "A: Well, I -- you know, I always am connected with them. Personally involved, I\u2019m not.\nAgain, I can\u2019t --",
        "A: Because it brings back memories, and when they talk about it, it brings back\nmemories. So I think in my own way, I -- I just cannot cope with the past, you know what\nI\u2019m saying? I live in the past, but yet, I get up -- very upset and so I -- I\u2019m not involved,\nbut I\u2019m connected.",
        "A: Well, as I said, I -- In -- When I say connected, whatever they run, you know, for --\nfor the Holocaust, let\u2019s say memorial or Holocaust Remembrance Day or something, I\nmean, we go. That does not mean that I don\u2019t get upse -- I\u2019m not upset for a whole week\nat least, you know, because I went and I listened and I -- and I saw the survivors and I\nlistened to other survivors, it does upset me very much. And so I -- Personally, I am not --\nyou know, not involved personally, just --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: They can\u2019t. It\u2019s absolutely impossible.",
        "A: We never talk about the Holocaust either. She\u2019s in Israel right now, but we never\nspoke about the Holocaust either.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: Very much so.",
        "A: Oh, about five, six years. About five or six years.",
        "A: From -- From the United States, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Oh, well, we didn\u2019t live exactly nearby. She used to live in Staten Island,\nthen they moved to Israel.",
        "A: Oh, when they were liv -- were -- lived here, yeah sure, we did. But now, you know,\nthings ha --",
        "A: We were -- We could not be very close, because there was a 10 year difference. But\nbesides the 10 years difference 1s also the generation, see? So, when you\u2019re talking 10\nyears, she could never understand her little sister and I could never understand her world,\ncause she lived in a different world, so the two of us really lived in two separate worlds.\nThe only thing that we had in common is the Holocaust. And we never discussed it and\nwe never spoke about it, and that was that.",
        "A: Colorful.",
        "A: Nope.",
        "A: Nope.",
        "A: Serious in what respect? As -- My feelings?",
        "A: I don\u2019t --",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. I live with a lot of pain.",
        "A: And disappointment, yeah.",
        "A: Well, it probably does, but then, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. We just have to\nkeep on going.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: With pain? Probably, yeah, probably. I -- I -- I think that, you know, every unfortunate\nexperience can connect you to somebody else, with his pain, cause you\u2019re sharing --\nthere\u2019s a pain, and you can understand, you can sort of feel it, even it\u2019s a different\nexperience, but it\u2019s a painful one. So, that\u2019s correct, yeah. You know, you sound like a\npsychiatrist.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, you need -- they need that, too.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, yes we do. But then also, it\u2019s the person\u2019s nature.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s also our nature.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. Some people might go through experiences, and yet not be able to\nconnect themselves to somebody else\u2019s pain, you know what I\u2019m saying? They just feel\ntheirs, that\u2019s it. They don\u2019t feel anybody else\u2019s. But then, other people feel other people\u2019s\npain. Now, I feel very much pain when -- when I hear killings, when innocent people are\nkilled. Even here, somebody is pushed on the tr -- into the tracks. Or this mother with the\nfour boys that are walking on the -- on the -- on the tracks, and these things give me pain,\nand -- and -- and s -- pain, a -- I mean, really pain, physical pain. It\u2019s like as if I would\nknow them or they would be part of me, or belong to me. That\u2019s the pain I get. And it\ntakes me awhile to get them out of my mind, cause I always think about them. And every\ntime I think, I will sigh. And I remember I used to work with a Black girl in my -- in my\njob that I had, and we were working 1n the business -- business office of the Brooklyn\nJewish Hospital, and every time she would hear me sigh -- sigh, and why would I sigh?\nBecause every time if I thought of someone who just got killed, or -- or someone who\njust got stabbed, or someone something happened to, innocent people, that hurts me very\nmuch. I would sigh and she would say, \u201cFrima, you cannot do that, because with every\nsigh, you are aging five years. So think about it,\u201d she said, \u201cbefore you know it, you\u2019ll be\nfull of wrinkles. Stop,\u201d she said, \u201cstop sighing. Think about yourself.\u201d I says, \u201cDll try.\u201d\nWell, I can\u2019t do it. I still sigh. But she -- that\u2019s what she used to tell me, every time, she\nsays, \u201cYou are sighing again? That\u2019s five years older.\u201d",
        "A: Not most, no, not most. Some. Some are survivors.",
        "A: No, nope. As I said, we don\u2019t really sit down and talk about experiences, but if we\u2019re\ntogether and we\u2019re discussing some kind of a situation in -- so someone will say, \u201cAh,\nwell I did this and this in \u00b041, and I did this and this in \u201942,\u201d and that\u2019s it. Only what\u2019s\npertaining to our conversation, or the situation. That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t really sit and talk\nabout it.",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "A: I went with my husband.",
        "A: Well, usually we were discussing why we would stop and -- and look at certain\npictures, and we would discuss the horrors. And then of course I start crying, so that\u2019s the\nend of the discussion.",
        "A: Nothing. I guess, you know, they feel you have to cry sometimes, if that makes you\nfeel better --",
        "A: Not exactly, doesn\u2019t make me feel better, but I --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Maybe, but -- but again, that\u2019s probably how -- how people feel. If you are crying, you\nneed that cry, and maybe by crying, you\u2019ll feel better. The mat -- matter of fact is, you\ndon\u2019t feel better, but you can\u2019t help it. It just comes on because it really hits you inside.\nYou are looking at something that -- that you lived with, or similarly, you know, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s a connection, so -- but that\u2019s what it 1s, that\u2019s what it is. So hey, we can\u2019t stop\non -- on ceremonies, we haven\u2019t got the time.",
        "A: Yeah, I would go.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Again, it would be because I feel that I\u2019m giving something that\u2019s important.",
        "A: On the children?",
        "A: I would come down.",
        "A: How old was that child? Must have been older. I think I\u2019m one of the youngest\nsurvivors in this world, I think.",
        "A: I think, cause it star -- the war -- World War Two started, by us, when I was five years\nold.",
        "A: So --",
        "A: Yeah, well.",
        "A: Support.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Was she also in the ghetto, or she was in concentration camp?",
        "A: Oh, okay, from a ghetto --",
        "A: -- or concentration camp? From a ghetto.",
        "A: Well, she was --",
        "A: Oh yeah? She was lucky. See, I always look at --",
        "A: Well, she survived. That\u2019s what I call lucky.",
        "A: Do you understand?",
        "A: None of us were lucky lucky.",
        "A: But we survived, and that is already a little luck, right? So we live with pain for the\nrest of our lives, because we lost an awful lot. We gave a lot of our loved ones away, for\nno reason. Just like that, poof. So --\nEnd of Tape Five Side B\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "A: Yeah, you know, when you mentioned about the -- the lady that -- that lost her mother\nin the concentration camp, I want you to know that all my life, I feel that I was very, very\nlucky I was not in the concentration camps. I mean, as much as my life was difficult and I\nsaw lots of horrors, and -- and went through a lot of hunger, and everything else, but the\nfact that I was not in the concentration camps, I always say I\u2019m lucky, and I really look\nup to those people from concentration camp that -- that survived, which is truly a -- an\nunbelievable miracle. Besides that I think I\u2019m a miracle with me, too. But, yeah --",
        "A: Yeah. Well, you know, I say that all these, you know, survivors, we came from ashes,\nand we build a castle. See, we all came with nothing. We had nothing, and we came with\n-- with so much miser-misery, and -- and with so much fright. I\u2019m afraid to start all over\nagain, but yet, we had the strength to do it, and all we were thinking is how to improve\nthe world, how to make things better for our children. And -- And we started building and\nbuilding from nothing, from ashes. So, I wish that other people, you know, who are really\ndown, and -- and -- and don\u2019t have much, they should look to -- look up to the survivors\nand say, look at them. They came from -- from -- really from hell, and look at them. They\nhave a home, they make sure the children go for an education. They -- They live nicely,\nyou know? They -- Their lives are -- I mean, not all are millionaires, but most of them\naccomplished something. And the accomplishment 1s, they don\u2019t -- they -- they don\u2019t\nhave to beg, because they all make a living somehow. And their children are all educated.\nIn fact, I got to tell you this, when I lived in Brooklyn, there were 13 religious families,\nthat\u2019s it. I mean, in that area, 13 religious families, Holocaust survivors, all of us, all 13\nfamilies. Now, out of these 13 Holocaust survivor\u2019s families, many of us never went to\nschool. Of course, I went to school, cause I was the -- you know, I was a baby when I --\nwhen I -- when World War Two started. But, they were already older, so when they came\nto the United States, they didn\u2019t have the time to go to school. They had to make a living,\nthey had to survive here. But out of these 13 Holocaust surviving families, we gave to the\nworld, nine doctors. Nine doctors, that\u2019s without counting lawyers, accountant, engineer,\ndentist. Nine doctors. That means some of the families had two doctors in the families.",
        "A: Well, well --",
        "A: -- no, it\u2019s the drive A, we -- those that survived, had a drive, plus a little luck, okay?\nSo we survived. Then, once we survive, we always feel that we have to improve, make\nthings better. And so the drive of accomplishment is important. So these parents, even if\nthey -- they did not have an education and they came from concentration camps, but they\ncame here and they started working and saving and working and saving. And so when\nthey had their children, oh, now\u2019s my chance. My children must get an education. And\nthese kids went to -- you know, went through all the schooling and everything else, and\nare professionals. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s the drive, and it\u2019s the fact that we want the world to be a\nbetter place to live. We want to be -- you know, bring pride to the world, and -- an-and I\nwish that, you know, people would look at it and say, if they can do it, I can do it. And\nwithout even going through hell. If these people went through hell and came out from\nashes and build a castle, I can do it, too. I live in a beautiful country, I have a beautiful\njob. All I have to do is a little struggling, a little saving. You know? I mean, all those\nthings go hand in hand. They can do it, too. Especially, I think the young generation\nshould look at it. See? And -- And -- And I want you to know that every family, from the\nHolocaust survivors, they take pride in their ch -- kids, because it\u2019s like a double\naccomplishment. It\u2019s, I didn\u2019t go to school, but look at my child, he\u2019s a professional. That\nmeans they feel like it\u2019s almost as if they did it, too, you know? And they didn\u2019t have the\nopportunity to do it. Ah, you always keep thinking -- ah, when I was young, I wanted to\nbe in -- in the research world.",
        "A: Yeah. But I had no one to support me, so instead, at the age of 13, I was supporting\nmy mother. I went out and I had the full da -- a full time job, and I went to school at\nnight.",
        "A: Yeah, and I went to school at night. That -- I -- It hurts me. That bothers me, that\nnobody in the family said, you know, \u201cWhat would you like to be, and where would you\nlike to go from here?\u201d And I knew I had a very good mind. I -- I was always a very good\nstudent, I was always an A student. And you know, my mother took great pride in me,\nand I really tried, and I wa -- I never disappointed her. And yet, you know, I -- I couldn\u2019t\ncontinue with -- with sa --",
        "A: No, well, no, I -- I -- I finished high school, and -- and then I came to the United\nStates.",
        "A: Oh well, oh well, there is always underlying dissatisfaction. A lot of it, I think, was\ndue that I was -- I was angry the fact that I couldn\u2019t be what I wanted to be, and that I\nwasn\u2019t -- I was not given the opportunity to be. Like, for example, here -- and today we\nhave all kinds of grants, and -- and -- and you can, you know, get a scholarship. In those\nyears there was no such thing. So, privately, I couldn\u2019t go anyplace, because we didn\u2019t\nhave the money, and my mother was a widow, and we had nothing. And nobody in the\nfamily even thought of -- of saying, well, you know, we\u2019ll get together and perhaps\nsupport you and -- and -- and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, I would love to.",
        "A: I would run.",
        "A: Yeah, I would love to be in the -- in the --",
        "A: No, I would love to be in research. I still like to be in research.",
        "A: See, I would love to find out something that can save human beings. Like cancer, like\ndiabetes. I cou -- Any, anything, but mostly I think it would be diabetes and cancer. I\nthink these are two dreadful diseases, which really need a lot of research. And I would\nreally sit 24 hours a day, for that. And I think I would -- I would -- I would probably find\npeace in it.",
        "A: Oh well, now. Now, maybe my husband would think I\u2019m nuts. He would really take\nme to a psychiatrist, and say, at this stage in your life -- but I-I don\u2019t feel my age. And I\nfeel I -- I have a lot of common sense. And I -- I am always willing to try things and I am\nalways willing to -- to discover things and look for things. It amazes me, I mean, how\nmuch we can find, if we look.",
        "A: Oh, there is such a thing? I-I never looked --",
        "A: -- into that. Yeah? In writing there is such a thing? Because we do have in -- in this\narea, we have adult education, or continued education, whatever you call it. Well, every\nso often I do take, you know, different types of courses, nothing -- nothing, you know,\nconstructive, really. It\u2019s just pleasure, something that just is good for my mind. But, PI\nlook into it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if Pll ever become a writer, listen, I\u2019m counting on you.",
        "A: I can give you the material.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: Thank you, I know.",
        "A: I know.",
        "A: Yeah, two years ago, yeah. And yet, I don\u2019t know of anyone in my family having it.\nAt least, my mother. Or maybe my father had it and he didn\u2019t know and I didn\u2019t know.\nAnd so -- And I was never overweight, so when this hit me, I didn\u2019t believe it. When the\ndoctor told me I had diabetes, I did not believe him, I said, it must be somebody else\u2019s\nblood results, not mine. And then, of course, you know, he took another blood test and\nthe results were --",
        "A: Not sh -- Well, right now, I\u2019m going to one of the biggest I -- I -- I am told, one of the\nfinest clinics, it\u2019s called Joslin Diab-Diabetes Clinic, in Manhattan -- Diabetes C-Center,\nactually. It\u2019s supposed to be one of the best in the United States, or perhaps in the world.\nWell, they\u2019re trying different types of medication, so every two weeks I'm on a different\ntype of medication. It\u2019s -- So far, it hasn\u2019t worked. The doctor told me there\u2019s another\nmedication that just came out on -- on the mar -- in -- you know, in the market, maybe\nwe'll try that. But, as you know, I have a tremendous drive in my life. I\u2019m very -- you\nknow, my mind 1s just, you have to keep going and you\u2019 ll be okay, just hang in there.\nAnd I\u2019m hanging in there. And hopefully, perhaps they\u2019Il be able to, you know, find a\nmedication for me, and if not, well, if that what it takes, I'll take the insulin. As long --",
        "A: No, no. We just sort of tested it for two weeks. It didn\u2019t do much. It just didn\u2019t do\nmuch for me. But again, you know, sometimes you have to increase the dose.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, but it has nothing to do with my eating.",
        "A: Look at this, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m lil -- you know, I\u2019m so skinny, I lost so much weight.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh of cour -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s passe. You don\u2019t eat -- I don\u2019t eat sugar.",
        "A: No, never touch it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t touch it. I don\u2019t touch anything that has sugar, although most of the things\nhave a little bit.",
        "A: Okay? So that you cannot help, but like cake is out of the question and anything that\u2019s\nsweet.",
        "A: Don\u2019t drink wine, I don\u2019t eat watermelon, I don\u2019t eat a lot of fruits that have -- that are\nsugar. I don\u2019t touch, well, any of this junk food that might have -- or any junk food, you\nknow, I\u2019m very careful [indecipherable] I -- I -- I can\u2019t really eat junk food, because right\nnow my -- my glucose is out of control, really, so I\u2019m trying to be extremely careful. I\u2019m\ntrying to eat as much protein as I can. But then, I have high cholesterol, so that protein 1s\nnot very good for the high cholesterol. But, you know what? Okay, and I also have high\nblood pressure, so I have the three highs. I am flying high. But, nothing stops me. I feel\nokay, and I just do what I have to do. I continue with my life. Yeah, I feel that I-I have to\ndo a lot of things, because time is going by very fast. And I feel like, you know, I got to\naccomplish more, more, more than what I\u2019ve accomplished until now. Cause it\u2019s like,\nyou know, 60 plus. I\u2019m almost there, and then --",
        "A: Well, almost you know, anything can happen some -- to someone that\u2019s in the 60\u2019s, or\nit could happen in the 70\u2019s, or could happen in the 80\u2019s. But I feel that I should\naccomplish more right now, while -- you know, while I still -- my mind is sharp and w --\nI\u2019m -- I still have my feelings and my marbles and my determination and my explanation,\nmy devotion. All this I would like to put on paper. How about that?",
        "A: That sounds good to you, right?",
        "A: Yeah, okay. So, okay, you know, survivors survive.",
