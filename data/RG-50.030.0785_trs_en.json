You had to obey their orders. I mean, Mother was resisting.\nWhatever Father and sisters, maybe even I put on, on this vehicle, she would throw\noff.

They threaten her, if you will continue like this,\nwe'll shoot you. This is what \u2014 what the soldiers said. And my brother-in-law\nstarted talking to my mother, and says, you have to do what they tell you to do,\nbecause otherwise, you know, it may end tragically. That\u2019s what he said. Now, so\nshe calmed down, and we put some stuff on the \u2014 on these carriages, and then they\ndrove us away from our home.",

So they put all these people\ntogether in this school, and I remember that I had a violin at home. So I sneaked out\nfrom the school, went back to our house, which wasn\u2019t far, maybe half a mile. So\nwhen I entered the house, the soldiers were already cooking eggs, you know, and\nbacon, and everything else, smell nice, you know, they having a good time in our\ndining room.

I mean, you know, a large family, maybe seven, eight people, because there\nwere families like that. So there was only one family, but otherwise there were two\nfamilies, either a three or a four. So there were two or three families put into each of\nthese big rooms. And there was a iron stove here, and na \u2014 and a bed, bed made of\nwood.

        "Q: And that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it \u2014 it just started up like that.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: So it was almost similar to being in the wagon, you know, in the carriage, on the\nway.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Except that it was larger, and bay \u2014 made of logs.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 then you could cook on that stove. But after we ga \u2014 that was during the\njourney, right, you are talking about \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 1n the ra \u2014 but similar situation was at the destination, where they took us to\nShenchuga, that \u2014 that settlement.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Where they provide you with food, you didn\u2019t have to pay for it.",
        "Q: So was this the first time that the authorities actually fed you, and up til then you\nhad to eat whatever you had taken with you?",
        "A: Yeah, well, they were given \u2014 they were giving bread. At every station they were\ngiving bread.",
        "Q: Okay.January 24, 2015",

        "Q: Okay. And about how many of such log cabins were there in this settlement?",
        "A: The di \u2014 this is only from my memory, because I know how they were\ndistributed. So maybe there \u2014 there were about 30.",
        "Q: So it was large? Was \u2014 you know, for a settlement in the middle of the forest.",
        "A: In the middle of the forest, but there were like a road, and a little cabin on both\nsides, and then another row, and another row. So there was \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s probably a\n\u2014a-\u2014a-\u2014maybe between 30 and 40.",
        "Q: And the forests, were these taw \u2014",
        "A: They were people already living in s \u2014 in half of it.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because those people were deported to those areas in \u2014 during that famine.",
        "Q: Got it.January 24, 2015",
        "A: Yes. But half, or almost half of that poselok we call it, it\u2019s a settlement, was\nempty.",
        "Q: Did anybody come at that point, and when you got to that settlement \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 did they tell you why you were there, and what you were going to be doing?\nWas there any official announcement?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, they were tell, you are here to work in the forest, until you\npodokneish(ph). In other words, until you die. But it \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014 this word die is\nnot regular death, but if you \u2014 by the time you just end your life. Podokneish(ph),\nit\u2019s more towards the animal, you know, pe \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Animals, they die also, right?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We use this \u2014 at least I think we use the same word for animals and \u2014 and\nhumans.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But over there it was different for animals. The animals, they\u2019re just ending their\nlife.",
        "Q: Okay.January 24, 2015",
        "A: So you are here until you end your life. That\u2019s all. That \u2014 th-that was \u2014 they will\nalways tell you that you are here to work, until you die. You could hear it from\nevery guard, cause there were armed guards over there. It was like a \u2014 a military\ncompound.",
        "Q: And so was it surrounded by a fence?",
        "A: No, there was no fence. The \u2014 the fence was natural habitat, you know, I\u2019m \u2014\nwhere could you go?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Forest, and nothing. There was a river, a large river. Nobody could pass\nprobably, unless he knew how to swim. But what \u2014 where \u2014 where could you go?\nOn the other side of the river?",
        "Q: So \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I did swim that river, and I \u2014 although, I was \u2014 yeah, I was only 13 years old,\nto begin with, and then 14.",
        "Q: Yeah. So \u2014 so, did they tell you what the work was? What was the work that\neverybody had to do?",
        "A: The work, mostly men and able women were assigned to cut timber. They were\ncutting timber, woom, you know, and then cutting these shorter pieces, about a yard\nlong, three feet long. And somebody would put a cubical or something, you know,January 24, 2015\nlike three by three. And then they would tie it with a rope, and there \u2014 the guy\nresponsible, supervisor \u2014 a ma \u2014 a Russian guy, would come and stamp these\npieces. He had like a hammer, and he put a stamp on everyone. It was funny. Well,\nnow it\u2019s [indecipherable] but some people were \u2014 would cut the ends very tiny,\nyou know, cut it off during the night, or something like that. And they said, well,\nthis is what we did today. So he would stamp it again, but it was the same cubicle.",
        "Q: So, in other words, they cut out the \u2014",
        "A: They were cheating, people were cheating the authorities, let\u2019s say.",
        "Q: So that meant they \u2014 they\u2019d cut the end that he had stamped.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And they cut the stamp off, and they left it as if it hadn't been, and then dwi \u2014\nthey used the same cubic feet of \u2014 of logs for the next day.",
        "A: Yeah. For the next day. But it wasn\u2019t that \u2014 I mean that \u2014 it\u2019s not that typical,\nreally.",
        "Q: Yeah, not that often.",
        "A: Not that often, but it happened. I know that happened, because my brothers used\nto do it, yeah.",
        "Q: What kind of instruments did they use for cutting logs, for cutting the trees?",
        "A: Oh, hand saws.January 24, 2015",
        "Q: Hand saws.",
        "A: Hand saws. A big saw about five feet long, with big teeth, and a handle at each\nend, and they would \u2014",
        "Q: So all of this was, let\u2019s say, from human energy, no machines at all.",
        "A: There were machines at a saw mill.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because what happened, they cut the wood, timber, and they put them in the\nriver. And they would float those logs on the river \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 to a place where they had saw mills.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And there were machinery with hooks, metal hooks, that would constantly rotate\nlike this, you know, big chains, maybe 12, 14 feet long. And they \u2014 this chain would\ngo into the river. And there were men who were guiding the logs towards this\nmachine.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And the hooks came, brought the logs on the shore, and there were people who\ntook the logs again, in human strength, human force, and cut them into shorterJanuary 24, 2015\npieces, and put them into these cubicles, and from then on, they would move them\non trains, to paper \u2014",
        "Q: Paper mills.",
        "A: Factories, or paper plants, or \u2014",
        "Q: So what \u2014 what was the wood that was being cut, was it pine?",
        "A: Pine. Ba-Basically pine, yes. Yes, one like what\u2019s growing out here in this \u2014",
        "Q: And did you \u2014 you were so young, were you put to work as well?",
        "A: Until I was 14 years old, I was forced to go \u2014 I mean forced, I liked to go to\nschool. But it was a very short time, you see, when \u2014 when we arrive there, in\nFebruary, I went to school.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because there was schools for the Russian people there. So, until I was 14 years\nold, which, only few months, then I could stop going to school, and go to work.\nAnd this is what I did, cause I didn\u2019t want to go to school there, so I started working\nwhen I was 14 years old.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: I was \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 allow \u2014 I was \u2014 how you \u2014 auth-authorized. I was authorized \u2014January 24, 2015",
        "Q: Authorized.",
        "A: \u2014 to take up employment. But up to 14, no, you had to go to school and \u2014",
        "Q: And so these \u2014 you said there was a school for the Russian kids? So \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, in the regular school.",
        "Q: Okay, so in \u2014 in addition to the Ukrainians who had been deported, was there\nlike a regular \u2014 were there regular Russians who weren\u2019t prisoners of any kind, who",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",

        "A: Yeah, maybe generations, but who knows?",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did some of them live in different kinds of quarters than the one you\ndescribe?",
        "A: No, the same \u2014 the same kind of quarters, except that people wou \u2014 to expand,\nyou know, they built a little shed by the \u2014 that log cabin, or they built like an\nentrance, so that normally you would enter from \u2014 from outside, like \u2014",
        "Q: Right.\n101\nJanuary 24, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 even here, you know, I don\u2019t have anything else. But you could build a little \u2014\nlittle \u2014",
        "Q: Pre-entrance.",
        "A: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah, so \u2014",

        "A: Oh, they had beautiful \u2014 beautiful buildings.",
        "Q: Oh, did they?",
        "A: Yeah, they had beautiful buildings, large. I remember, because my father, who\nwas a builder, he worked \u2014 they put him to work right away. And they di \u2014 they ha\n\u2014 the building that was there, was falling apart. So he almost rebuild it, and it was\n[indecipherable] like a mansion. Painted white, and everything you \u2014 sometimes\nyou can see those, in the movies, big \u2014 big homes. So that\u2019s where the commandant,\nor the \u2014 the \u2014 the main administrator lived.",
        "Q: And did they have families?",

        "Q: Okay, so you were the prisoners, and they were the guards.",
        "A: We were prisoners, but we are not prisoners in th \u2014 in the sense that we couldn\u2019t\ngo out, or anything like that. But within that area, yeah, we could move freely.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Freely. But there was nowhere to go. Nowhere to go, unless somebody wanted to\nrisk, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Well, going out in the winter, into the forest to cut trees, did people \u2014 were they\ngiven the kind of clothing that you would need, or not?",
        "A: No, no, no, whatever we brought with us \u2014",
        "Q: That was it.",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 that\u2019s what they used. They wouldn\u2019t \u2014 maybe later on, because\nthen they \u2014 they \u2014 they started paying for \u2014 for your time that you worked in the\nforest. People were paid, so you could probably buy little better \u2014",
        "Q: Was there a store there?",
        "A: There was one official store. There no privacy \u2014 there were no private enterprise,\nnothing.",

        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yeah, there\u2019s \u2014 you enter into the store, so the \u2014 all the shelves were full of\nchampagne bottles. And you could buy it, if you had money. But I don\u2019t think \u2014 and\nthey were selling bread, but bread was rationed. You were allowed, for instance,\nhalf a pound of bread, and you had coupons like. You had \u2014",
        "Q: So they \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 tender \u2014 tendered the coupon, and then get the bread for it, and pay for it. But,\njust give you an example. When I reached the age of 14 years old, I started working.\nAnd I was supplying a fuel to those steam boilers. You had to constantly feed steam\nboilers to produce steam, to operate the machines.",
        "Q: Okay.January 24, 2015",
        "A: And I worked as one that was supplying the fuel to these large boilers.",
        "Q: And these \u2014 these were the machines that were \u2014",
        "A: Taking the wood out, or \u2014",
        "Q: Of the water.",
        "A: \u2014 no \u2014 and then they were also cutting, but at the saw mills, they have\nmechanical saws, big saws like this. So they were operated by steam. Every \u2014 every\nmachine that was there, was operated by sa \u2014 by steam. No electricity, by steam.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: So there were big boilers, constant, and supply tubes. They had systems, you\nknow, built pretty well. Organized, you know.",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 was it \u2014 were you warm, as you were doing this? Was this a kind of a\njob that people would have wanted to have, because of the conditions, or is it a\ndifficult job?",
        "A: No. No, no, no, you \u2014 you \u2014 you had no choice, you were \u2014 you were assigned.",

        "Q: I understand you couldn\u2019t choose.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t choose.January 24, 2015",
        "Q: My point \u2014 yeah, my question is that, was it a good job to have, in the\nconditions, or was it one that was too difficult and nobody wanted to do it?",
        "A: There was no other work available, only timber. Everything was timber. Cutting\nwood, cutting to smaller pieces, cleaning it, removing the branches. That\u2019s was \u2014",
        "Q: Was your work outside?",
        "A: Outside all the time.",
        "Q: Ah, okay.",
        "A: Outside.",
        "Q: It was outside.",
        "A: They were cutting the trees, big, tall trees, cleaning them, then cutting shorter,\nputting them on like pallets, and \u2014",
        "Q: And supplying the fuel to the steam boiler was also something that was done\noutside?",

I \u2014 if I wanted to buy all the f \u2014 bread that I was allowed, then there was\nnothing left. But sometimes I didn\u2019t buy, I only bought two portions of bread. So I\n111\nJanuary 24, 2015\nspent two rubles, and I had two rubles spared. So then I could do \u2014 do something\nelse with this money.",

        "A: No, they continued to die. There were a lot of people there were dying. Lot of\npeople dying, during the short time that we were there, I would say about 200\npeople died. And later on I got a better job because I decided to become a shepherd.\nSo re \u2014 those local Russians who lived there for \u2014 for many years, they were born\nthere and everything, they were free, right? So they had goats. Each family had one\nor two goats. So they needed a shepherd to \u2014 to tend to these goats. So myself and\nmy mother, we decided, you know, to \u2014 to get that job, or take the job if nobody\nwanted it, or couldn\u2019t, or whatever. So we \u2014 what I used to have a \u2014 a little wooden\npiece like this on a string, and I had two little pieces of wood, you know, like \u2014 like\nthe orchestra guy has, you know what that \u2014",

And when there was about 350 - 400 of them gathered together, then I took\nthem to the pasture. And I took care of them during the day, and they were just\nfeeding on \u2014 on the grass.",
        "Q: Right. So you would just mind them.",
        "A: I would mind them, take care so no \u2014 nobon \u2014 no one was lost. And in the\nevening I brought them back, and each one knew where \u2014 where she belongs. You\nknow, it\u2019s funny. I just brought them into this little village, and they \u2014 they found\ntheir own homes, and well \u2014",
        "Q: And they go back.",
        "A: And then I was paid for it by the owners of the goats, and also they gave me\nmilk, or some other things.",
        "Q: Well, this is a question I had, when you were out in the pasture, could you milk\nthe goats?",
        "A: Oh jeez, no.",

But on the other side of the river, there were just a re \u2014 remains of an old\nbuildings. Nobody lived there, but it was quite a large area maybe, I don\u2019t know,\nlike few blocks of our, maybe five, 10 blocks, completely empty, only ruins. And\nmostly what \u2014 what was standing were chimneys, because they were made of brick,\nand the fireplaces. Because in that old time, there were just fireplaces, and not like\ngas cookers, or anything like that. Just a box with a \u2014 with room for \u2014 for coal orJanuary 24, 2015\nwood, and a metal plate on top, where you could boil something. So only those\nthings remained. And I used to go there, and looking for various things, and never\nfound anything. But the ruins were there, large area.",

        "A: They \u2014 yeah, they were the people from way behi \u2014 way before. I mean, way\nseveral years. Let\u2019s say \u00b035, and this was *40, so not \u2014 not that mu \u2014 long, you\nknow, not that long.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So, this \u2014 what do you call it? These \u2014 this whole area was completely dead,\nempty, because they say that some kind of disease fell over there. And just \u2014",

        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 placed.",

        "Q: So tell us what happened in 1942. You said \u2014 you were mentioning that you\nwere allowed to be \u2014 to leave in 1942. What happened?",
        "A: When \u2014 when the Germany attacked Russia \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s in June 1941.",
        "A: June 22\", 1941, we suddenly became allies with Russia, because Poland had\nthe government in England.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: There was a government in exile. And we were allied with France, England,\nand some \u2014 Ireland, something like that. So we suddenly, since the Germans\nattacked Russia, we became ally \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 with the ru \u2014 with Russians. So the Russian says, now you are free, you\u2019re free.\nYou can go a will \u2014 anywhere you go \u2014 anywhere you want.January 24, 2015",
        "Q: Well, 1-if you say that you found out in \u201942, it took half a year for you to find\nout. I mean, from June \u201941, di\u2014 the news didn\u2019t travel too fast.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s fa \u2014 it traveled very fast.",
        "Q: Oh, it did?",
        "A: Except nobody took any action. We knew that Germany is at war with Russia,\nwe knew that. And the Russian told us right away. It happened in June, but in \u2014 in si\n\u2014 August \u2014 in August, the Polish government in exile already had an agreement\nwith the Russian government.",
        "Q: How did this affect you in Shenchuga, in those months?",
        "A: Well, they said, you are free, you can leave, you can go away if you want.",
        "Q: Right away they said that?",
        "A: Right \u2014 well, two months later, maybe.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Two months.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I can \u2014 yeah.",
        "Q: So, no longer were \u2014",
        "A: Because it was in \u2014 in \u2014 in August that we were actually told that we can \u2014 oh,\nand they give us papers.January 24, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 certificates that we can travel anywhere we want, because before, we\ncouldn\u2019t leave the area. But then we \u2014 everybody got the certificate, like a travel\ndocument or something like that, and people would leave. Some left right away, but\nwe stayed there until June \u2014 no, June? No, no, January. Until January \u201942. On the\nnew year, the first of January, \u201942, my family finally decided to leave Russia.",
        "Q: And why did it take that extra number of months to make this decision?",
        "A: Because they didn\u2019t know what to do, they didn\u2019t know where to go. You\ncouldn\u2019t go back to Poland, because Germans overrun Poland, you know, they\nwere at war with Russia. So \u2014 and where were \u2014 people were asking, what are we\ngoing to do? Said well, maybe we should move, maybe we should go south. And\nthere \u2014 then, most of them did go south. But that was later.",
        "Q: And did you still continue working under the same conditions after you were\ntold, or d\u2014 were you given more rations, or were you \u2014 did your \u2014 did your\neveryday rhythm of life change, when you were told in August \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was only from a psychological point of view that we are free. But av \u2014\neverything just went the same way.",
        "Q: Stayed the same.January 24, 2015",
        "A: Whoever \u2014 yes, whoever worked in the forest, you know, they worked in the\nforest, but they were treated differently. They were free citizens. We were free. So\nwe had something to say, and we had some rights, let\u2019s say, at that time. Because\nwe already had the Polish government in England, who was looking after our\ninterests. So they were talking to the Russian government, and the Russian \u2014\nRussian allowed more freedom, and better \u2014 better conditions and better pay, and\neverything else. They started treating us differently.",
        "Q: So their behavior was different.",
        "A: Absolutely, right. They changed. And like I say, me \u2014 a lot of people left earlier.\nLike my brother Frank, the second from the top, he left in August.",
        "Q: Right away.",

        "Q: So how did you leave? Before we get to that point, how did you leave that\nShenchuga? Was it \u2014 it wa \u2014 was it by sleigh again, or was it on foot, was it with a\nwagon? How did you leave?",
        "A: No, from \u2014 from the Shenchuga to the railway station, we were by sleigh.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Or \u2014 or no \u2014 part of it was just a freight train again.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But under free conditions, you know, the better conditions and it didn\u2019t last that\nlong, because it was fast, you know, they didn\u2019t put us on the side or anything,\ndidn\u2019t have to wait. It was just from here to there, from \u2014 from Gouza(ph), or\nJakobak(ph), there were to places on the south. We went to Caspian Sea,\nKrasnovodsk \u2014",
        "Q: Krasnovodsk, okay.",

        "Q: Okay, before we get there, when you get to Uzbekistan, what kind of situation\ndo you find there? You know, where do you go to \u2014 to make sure that you\u2019re in \u2014\nyou re \u2014",
        "A: It \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much problem, because when we reached Uzbekistan in\nFebruary \u2014 it took two months to get from north to \u2014 to the south. That I remember,\ntwo months, by various means, basically freight train. So when they \u2014 when we\ncame to Uzbekistan, Polish authorities, which were already trying to help this\ncivilian population, say that we are going to move you away from Russia, into\nPersia. So, it was a very short period of time, only two weeks when \u2014 when my\nmother and sister and I was assigned to leave Russia, in March.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And since we came by the end of February, so only a few weeks. And we were\nalready, as far as I\u2019m concerned, ready to leave, and I fell sick with typhus. Typhoid\nfever. So they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t allow me, because the transport was ready to \u2014\nto leave Russia, to Persia, and a\u2014 we were assigned to this transport, but because\nof my sickness, I was retained there. Authority says no, you cannot travel, because\nyou'll spread \u2014",

I am staying I\u2019m \u2014 until you get well,\nand we\u2019ll see what happens. But my brother Roman, he was already in\nadministrative position, he was trying to help all these civilian people get relocated,\nor taken care of, he says \u2014 he said, Mother, you leave with my sister, you go, and go\nto Persia, and I will take care of Tony. Or me. So don\u2019t worry about him, he will be\nall right.",
        "Q: And what about your father?",
        "A: Oh, my father died in Russia, we didn\u2019t say anything about that.",
        "Q: No, let\u2019s talk about that. But first tell me about this, let\u2019s finish this, then \u2014 you \u2014\nso you \u2014 did you \u2014 is that what happened, that your brother Roman stayed with\nyou?",
        "A: Yes, yes. And he says that he told Mother to go, that we \u2014 we will follow later\non, because at that time it was this time on a lot of people were leaving, Polish\npeople were leaving Russia under General Anders. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s\nfamiliar to you. He was in charge of the Polish army, which was being organized in\nthe south of Russia. He was in charge of everything, civilians, and the military.",
        "Q: Okay.\n128January 24, 2015",
        "A: So from then on we \u2014 we were really taken care of, because British were already\nhelping to take care of the Pole \u2014 civilians.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: Yes. So Mother and Sister left for Persia in March, and I stayed behind \u2014",
        "Q: With Roman.",
        "A: \u2014 and took me to a hospital, and I spent there for two weeks in a hospital. And\nwhen I got well, I was released from the hospital and joined a Polish young soldiers.\nIt was no \u2014 a sel \u2014 special unit being organized for the young people, say from 14 to\n17.",

        "Q: Okay.\n129January 24, 2015",
        "A: He was safe, and he joined the army and then left Russia early. And my mother\nand sister also left in March, while I stayed behind until August.",
        "Q: Oh, that\u2019s quite a while then.",
        "A: Yes, quite a while, because then they stopped the transpor \u2014 transports. I don\u2019t\nknow whose decision it was, but only a few thousand people left during the march \u2014\nexodus I call it, let\u2019s say exodus. And then, until August, nobody left Russia. But in\nAugust they resumed leaving \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 because General Anders was then in charge of the army and everybody that\nwas there, and he negotiated with the Russian people, with the Russian authorities.\nSo, in August they resumed, and they moved about hundred thousand people at that\ntime.",
        "Q: Huge number.",
        "A: Huge number, but it was all concentrated. August \u2014 and mainly August, yeah, a\nlot of people left.",
        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: And then when \u2014 I also left Russia.",
        "Q: What about Roman?",
        "A: Roman, yes \u2014January 24, 2015",
        "Q: Also left at the same time?",
        "A: \u2014 yes, right, yes.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s go back now, and talk about what happened to your father. The last you\nmentioned is he rebuilt this beautiful house.",
        "A: Yes, for the administrator there, the main them \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 boss of that area. And then he started getting sick. And on \u2014 on the first, like I\nmentioned, on the first of January, we le \u2014 we decided to leave. And he was already\nvery sick, very sick. But, we started the journey. And on the 17\" day of the journey,\nhe passed away, during the journey. And it was Perm, a place near Ural mountains.\nHe \u2014 he died, and I \u2014 I was, up to the last moment with him. We were talking, and\nhe was saying goodbye, and you know, that \u2014 and he just gave up. And we left him\non a platform, because when the train sto \u2014 I said, Mother \u2014 it was about one\no\u2019clock in the morning, I said, Father just passed away. Well, so the first time \u2014 the\nfirst thing, the train stopped at the station, I remember, the Perm station, you know.\nThey took his body out, and put it on a railroad platform, you know, like there are\ntracks on large stations, so there are platforms between the tracks. So there were\nalready about maybe 50 corpses on the platform, so we just took him. My \u2014\nRoman, because we traveled together, and myself, and we just left him on the\n131January 24, 2015\nrailroad platform, without \u2014 without funeral. We \u2014 we tried to get some kind of\narrangement, but 1t was impossible, you know, there \u2014 it\u2019s impossible, just leave\nhere, and a-as I say, there were already large heap of corpses there. So we just put\nsome wrapping around him, left the corpse there. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 that was the\nPerm railroad station, because in Russia, there was just tru \u2014 you know,\ncommunication, rails. That \u2014 that was the main \u2014 main system of moving around,\neither freight train or passenger train, but passenger trains very, very rare.",
        "Q: Was \u2014 you said he was saying goodbye to everybody in \u2014 as you were talking to\nhim?",
        "A: No, he was \u2014 we were \u2014 I was talking to him and saying goodbye. But after he\ngave up, then I \u2014 I woke my mother.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know when he is going to have the last breath. I didn\u2019t know that.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But it happened during the night, and I \u2014 I knew when it happens, and then I\nwoke my mother, and \u2014 and I said, the first thing we stopped at the station, they put\nhim on the platform, and \u2014 and he was left there, with others. But the death was the\nnormal way there, you know. Inhuman, terrible to talk about. Nobody can\nunderstand that. We were treated \u2014 I can\u2019t even say. Worse than animals, by theJanuary 24, 2015\nRussians. They didn\u2019t care. Because it \u2014 that was Stalin\u2019s policy. You are here until\nyou die, but in our case, we were \u2014 I mean, blessed that it \u2014 that we did get out of\nthat hell. It was pure hell. People don\u2019t realize like \u2014 you know, no \u2014 no clinic, no\ndoctor, no help. No, it \u2014 they \u2014 they didn\u2019t care. We die here or there, today,\ntomorrow. Nobody cared. Only you family cared, nobody else. The main thing was\nto get some food. That was the main thing and then I think that was Stalin\u2019s policy,\nyou know, starve the people so they cannot do anything else but think about how to\nsurvive.",
        "Q: Like you said, everybody left \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to continue, because this 1s \u2014\nthis is the worst. Worst moment of the life.",
        "Q: Do you want us to stop for a little bit?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe a little, how about \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, we can \u2014 we can \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 getting some water, or \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 soda.",
        "Q: Sure. [break]January 24, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 the Germans were \u2014 were leading some prisoners along the road, from one\nplace to another because they were, let\u2019s say, taken to do \u2014 do some work\nsomewhere. Like dig ditches, or something like that, and th-they were going home,\nand there was a farmer bringing some potatoes. And some potatoes fell. A raw\npotato fell on the ground, and this guy grabbed this potato, and started \u2014",
        "Q: To eat it.",
        "A: \u2014 eating a si\u2014 a raw potato. But the German pri \u2014 g-guard, when saw it, he shot\nhim. And he was still eating when he was \u2014",
        "Q: Falling.",
        "A: \u2014 falling, he was still eating that bre \u2014 that \u2014",
        "Q: Raw potato.",
        "A: Who \u2014 who would believe something like that, that one man can do to another?\nWhy \u2014 why \u2014 why did we have this concentration camp? Why they\u2019re so \u2014 you\nknow, mean to each other? Why?",
        "Q: Is that a question that you were asking yourself?",
        "A: I want answer, why people fall for all, that they forget that they are human being,\nthat they have soul, and responsibility. We \u2014 we are not vegetable. We are people\nwith feelings, with soul. Those who believe, I don\u2019t know, some people don\u2019t\nbelieve that, but I \u2014 I believe. I\u2014 I\u2019m a religious person. So I cannot imagine how\n134January 24, 2015\nanother human being could be so mean, you know, to his fellow man. But I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know. I\u2019ve seen a lot in my life.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you ever question while \u2014 when you were there, did you ever\nquestion your belief? Did you ever think there \u2014 there can be no God, because a \u2014\nwhat I\u2019m seeing is so terrible?",
        "A: No, this \u2014 then the \u2014 no, it did not occur to me like that, but I did question, you\nknow, how can these people be saved, or something like that, you know how \u2014\nmaybe there isn\u2019t. But, if somebody commits such a crime against another human\nbeing, he has to pay for it. It would be unfair if these people who were so sav \u2014\nsavages to another people, went free. I \u2014 I cannot imagine that. So I think that there\nis \u2014 there must be some justice, oh, some justice that people will pay somehow, one\nway or the other. But maybe there isn\u2019t a way. Well, on the other hand, you know,\nthis is probably not for social discussion.",
        "Q: Well, actually, these are the key questions.",
        "A: Question.",
        "Q: Sometimes \u2014 the-these are the key ones.",
        "A: Question that I have chance to raise with you, for instance, you know.",
        "Q: Well, I\u2019m glad.",
        "A: But we discuss these things, we\u2019re friends, I mean, you know.January 24, 2015",
        "Q: Yeah. You know, these are the sort of \u2014 like, these things that happened, and the\npeople went through, they go to the basic questions of living, and of life. And the\nquestions that you\u2019re raising, are the kind that we wish we could find answers for.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: We wish we could know.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Because how else do you \u2014 how do you explain such cruelty? How do you\nexplain such things?",
        "A: Sure, yeah.",
        "Q: You know?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, I\u2014I talked about it a lot, because my \u2014 my daughter is married to a\nAmerican \u2014 not native American, but an American of so many, many years, let\u2019s\nsay. So they \u2014 they often want to hear something of what I have to tell them, and\nsometimes, you know, I wonder if they ever get th-the real feeling what I have to \u2014",
        "Q: Share.",
        "A: \u2014 share, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. It\u2019s very hard for \u2014 for people in societies that haven\u2019t experienced\nsomething similar \u2014 individual people will be able to understand it, but the societyJanuary 24, 2015\ndidn\u2019t go through something like that, so it\u2019s unfamiliar for them. They haven\u2019t \u2014\nthey haven\u2019t gone through the same kind of historical trauma.",
        "A: No, no, no, of course not.",
        "Q: Yeah. But some do, and very well, and very deeply. Let\u2019s continue, and talk\nabout your exodus. When you leave from Krasnovodsk \u2014",

        "A: Sea.",
        "Q: Tell me, what \u2014 what was that like? Was \u2014 were you on a boat? Were you on a \u2014\na little one, a big one? What di \u2014 what did it look like?",
        "A: No, it \u2014 the journey was done on a oil tanker. There were \u2014",
        "Q: On an oil tanker, mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 oil tankers, because they were out of those ships in that area. So they just put\nus on \u2014 on top, on \u2014 on the deck. It was all metal, and if you can imagine August\nsun beating in that area, which is south, real close to the meridian.",
        "Q: Right, me \u2014",
        "A: It was hot, and the metal deck was really, you know, very, very hot.",
        "Q: So, could you cook an egg on it?January 24, 2015",
        "A: I guess, yeah. Maybe \u2014 hey, people said that they would \u2014 and a lot \u2014 and lack of\nwater, that was very bad thing, because before got on that tank, we had these little\ncanteens, so filled with water, maybe say a quart of water in there, and it \u2014 it \u2014\njourney took three year \u2014 three days. So, that water didn\u2019t last long, and there was\nno water to get on the ship.",
        "Q: Oh, wow.",
        "A: So it was real \u2014 that was real bad, but we knew that we are getting towards\nfreedom, we are leaving Russia, so everything was \u2014",
        "Q: You \u2014 you bore it \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 bearable.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: We \u2014 we were glad to. And after we disembarked in Pahlevi \u2014 Pahlavi, in\nPersia, well, people were just kneeling on the sand, after we got off the tra \u2014 off the\nships in the port, and marched towards the transit area, where there were tents, large\ntents where we could, you know, relax, and \u2014 and one thing, there was one tent\nwhere the \u2014 everybody had to go through that. We strip \u2014 stripped everything down,\nleft. Showers. New, fresh clothes at the other end of the tent, out into the freedom.\nThat was like heaven.",
        "Q: Was it? Was it?\n138\nJanuary 24, 2015",
        "A: Yeah. You entered one, leave everything behind, and out the other side. That\nwas \u2014 yeah. Beautiful moment. That\u2019s when we left Russia.",

        "A: New set of clothes, and I joined the \u2014 the si \u2014 they call them young people. It\nwas just like a cadet level, you know, that area. And they gave us uniforms. They\nwere like semi-military uniforms, and they drafted us into this \u2014 these schools.",

But that time,\nthe government was very conscientious and tried to help, the \u2014 you know, right after\nthe Poland regained independence in 1918, the \u2014 the government used to be very\nconscientious, and that they did everybo \u2014 everything that they could to help\nfarmers, professionals, to get on \u2014 get \u2014 get ahead. And those 20 years between\n1918 and 1940, or \u201939, when war started, it was a very intensive development. I \u2014 I\ncan \u2014 can vouch for that, remember that. Government was very helpful. They were\ngiving loans for \u2014 for the farmers for develop \u2014 to buy equipment. We already hadJanuary 24, 2015\nmechanized machinery to \u2014 to sow, instead of sowing like this, you know, from a\npouch, then you had machines to \u2014",

        "A: They were afraid that \u2014 first of all, S-September, let\u2019s say, first, to September\n17\", when the Russians came in, it was a very short time. So we were afraid that the\nGermans would come close to us, because Germany took over the \u2014 the western\npart of Poland.",

And some people, because the population was mixed, some were ra \u2014 of\nRussian descent, let\u2019s say, or Ukrainian, and some Poles. So those Russian people\nwould welcome them, with flowers, and they would throw flowers at the soldiers.\nAnd they were happy, waving, things like that. We were not happy. We were \u2014 we\nknew that they are not our friends, they are our enemies. So that\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no, it was sudden, came in because there was no like, radio programs\nwith news on a regular basis. So no, we only saw them when they came in to the \u2014\nthe village.",
        "A: It was a complete surprise, and they came on tanks, on dirt roads, instead of\nmaybe just armored cars on tires, you know. No, it was horrible, it was terrible. And\nwe\u2019re scared, we absolutely \u2014 well, we di \u2014 didn\u2019t know what to do, but everybody\nwas interested to see what \u2014 wha \u2014 what\u2019s going on. And right away, the local\npeople, those Ukrainians, formed like militia. Militia?",

        "A: \u2014 school together, they\u2019re our neighbors, and my friends that I played with. But\nethnic background was different. So we were scared, and it was really bad, cause\nwe didn\u2019t \u2014 Ukrainians killed a lot of people then.",
        "A: When the Russians came in, they take like a revenge or something like that, you know.\nSo \u2014",
        "A: For some personal maybe, misunderstandings, or quarrels, or something like that. I\ndon\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t have anything against anybody.",
        "A: My father was very well liked in the village. He was very well liked, because\nthey \u2014 like, he was helpful. He \u2014 he was in such a profession that everybody \u2014",

It\u2019s \u2014I still can\u2019t\nunderstand that, because I think that they \u2014 they lived in \u2014 peacefully until the very\nend when \u2014 when the Russians came in. So everybody was friendly and everything\nelse, helpful. But when the Russians came in, they already put armbands, those\nlocal \u2014 local Ukrainians, and they started cooperating, collaborating with the\nRussians. But it wasn\u2019t wrong, because the Russians then arrested those people \u2014",

        "A: I was going to school all the time, yes.",

        "A: So that was the first indication, you know, that \u2014",

        "A: Before my father bought some land there.",
        "A: So they were local people.",

So\nthey started banging on the doors, open up, open up. So, I think \u2014 I don\u2019t know who\nwas the first, Father, Mother, got up, went to the door, opened the door, they came\nin. There were about five Russian soldiers with guns \u2014 no rifles, with rifles and\nbayonets. And first of all, they said, do you have any weapon? Imet\u2019 oruzhiye.\nThat\u2019s in Russian.",
        "A: Oruzhiye. Do you have weapons? My father says no, I don\u2019t have any weapon.\nAlthough, he did have a rifle hidden somewhere, but that was useless, you know.\nHe didn\u2019t even say nothing, because he couldn\u2019t get to it, or even if he could, he\ncouldn\u2019t do anything, because there\u2019s lo \u2014 many of them, these Russian soldiers,\nwell-armed. So they say, pack up. Start packing up because we are \u2014 you are going\nto be taken away from here. And says, you \u2014 you do not belong \u2014 you do not belong\nto here. He says, Father, what? This is my land. No, it\u2019s not yours. We are taking\nover. It\u2019s no more \u2014 no longer it\u2019s yours, you \u2014 you have nothing, just pack up\nwhatever you can, food and some clothing. Because they came with those vehicles,\nCarriages.January 24, 2015",
        "A: Horse-drawn carriages, yeah. And they said, here, pack up what you want, or\nwhat you can, take some warm clothing and some food. So \u2014 and they were well,\nlike I say, armed. You had to obey their orders. I mean, Mother was resisting.\nWhatever Father and sisters, maybe even I put on, on this vehicle, she would throw\noff. She was very unreasonable, you know, wha \u2014 with them. She \u2014 she \u2014 she didn\u2019t\n\u2014 she couldn\u2019t comprehend this, you know, what\u2019s going on. Why \u2014 why are you\ntaking us away? What was \u2014 where are we going? We don\u2019t know, but you have to\nmove. We\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll take you away from here. So she was throwing things off. And\nthe soldiers would put some food, let\u2019s say, food or clothing, or \u2014 back on the\nvehicle, she would throw it back. They threaten her, if you will continue like this,\nwe'll shoot you. This is what \u2014 what the soldiers said. And my brother-in-law\nstarted talking to my mother, and says, you have to do what they tell you to do,\nbecause otherwise, you know, it may end tragically. That\u2019s what he said. Now, so\nshe calmed down, and we put some stuff on the \u2014 on these carriages, and then they\ndrove us away from our home.",
        "A: Oh, it \u2014 maybe hour and a half, it was something like that. No \u2014 no more than\ntwo hours. We \u2014 we \u2014 we were on the way. But they took us \u2014 this I remember, I\u2019 llJanuary 24, 2015\ntell you why, took us to the local school, because there was room, you know, in the\nschool, classes and everything, there was assembly hall. So they put all these people\ntogether in this school, and I remember that I had a violin at home. So I sneaked out\nfrom the school, went back to our house, which wasn\u2019t far, maybe half a mile. So\nwhen I entered the house, the soldiers were already cooking eggs, you know, and\nbacon, and everything else, smell nice, you know, they having a good time in our\ndining room. So, I took the violin. I could have run away somewhere, you know, to",

But I saw this\n[indecipherable] when they already having good time on the food and everything.\nSo imagine, I \u2014 I see \u2014 really terrible thing to even imagine how these people felt,\nthat they had to leave everything behind, for what, why? Why do \u2014 why are you\ntaking, what\u2019s \u2014 no compensation, no reason, no nothing. Just \u2014",
        "A: No, you never told. You \u2014 he says, this doesn\u2019t belong to you any more. State is\ntaking over. State means Russia, Soviet Russia. The state is taking over your \u2014\nyour possessions and everything, and they forced us out, by taking us to this school.January 24, 2015\nThey kept us there for several hours. Course, it was early in the morning, but I think\nby noon, they moved us to Podkamien, which is the town, because they had better\nfacilities there, larger.

        "A: Well, when \u2014 when they put us into this trains, the car \u2014 transport \u2014 was quite the\nlong transport, and it started to move east \u2014 east from Poland. It was in the city of\nBrody, yeah, I said that \u2014 that\u2019s what the station was. And we started the journey.\nSo, next day, the \u2014 the journey actually start the next day, because the first day, was\n10\" of February, was just moving from the house to the station.

        "A: No, wider, so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it took some time before \u2014 and they had technique \u2014 they \u2014 they had ways of\ndoing it, and it was all pretty efficient. So they just change the whole wheel\nassembly. The same box, they lifted up, changed the wheels, and off we went toJanuary 24, 2015\nRussia. So we knew that we are going to Russia, and where \u2014 wherever they\nstopped it for \u2014 for changing this wheels, that \u2014 that was the border.",
        "A: That was the border. And as far as I know, I have some notes that I took, four\ndays it took us, between our house and the time we reached the \u2014 the borders \u2014",

        "A: First of all, when \u2014 when they took us to Brody, a lot of other people would be\nco-coming. So they were gathering this transport, they were arranging a hu \u2014 long\ntransport, maybe of 40 carriages, or something like that, you know? A long\ntransport. But there were only few from our place, and few from others, and I know\nthese people because I met them later, in Canada.",

        "A: Car \u2014 cattle car? Yeah, goods train, cattle car. When the train stopped to take\nwater, as a locomotive was filling up with water, and maybe fuel, then people were\nable to get out of this transport, and just maybe walk, or go to a \u2014 because usually it\nJanuary 24, 2015\nwas like a \u2014 by the station, railway station. So they could go there, and maybe\npurchase something, like bread. On some stations, there was bread available. Or, get\nboiled water, which they called kipiatok.",
        "A: In Russia, kipiatok. Which is just boiled water, but you could use it to make\nsomething like tea, or what \u2014 or whatever you had to put in it \u2014 into it. And\nsometimes it was two hours stop, maybe three hours stop, and then everybody\nwould get back. Of course, it was guarded. There were, every few wagons, or yes,\nyes, I call it wagon, there were guards, Russian military guards. So they were taking\n\u2014 w-watching everybody. You couldn\u2019t get too far away from \u2014 from where the\nstation was, where the train was stopped. But normally, what the train was put on a\nside truck, and there was nowhere to go, really.",

        "A: Oh, not really, because wa \u2014 if you ask \u2014 and I did ask, also, so they said,\nbecause it was war. So they say, military secret. You \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 we are not\nallowed to discuss anything, you know. They couldn\u2019t tell you. But there were\nnames on the stations, so we could read the name of it.

        "A: Yeah, drive the train, or th-the trains were put on a side track and they were \u2014 we\nwere waiting for a couple days maybe.

        "A: Am I pronouncing it right, or no?",
        "A: Yeah. So, they put us on sleighs, and some people were forced to walk behind.\nThose who could. Children and older people could sit in the sleighs. And they draw\nus from this railroad station to that final destination, which was a settlement inside\nthe forest. Th-Th \u2014 there was an opening, a large opening, and there were mo \u2014 log\nhouses. They were built like twins. It was one big, log house, with a wall in between",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, what do you mean, you know, they just as \u2014 went to bed and slept it like,\non a platform, on a wooden platform. There were no beds, or mattresses.",

        "A: No, when we came in they were all empty. These \u2014 these log cabins were empty.",
        "A: So they just are assigned several people, or one family, or two families to one\nroom, and it\u2019s \u2014January 24, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 it \u2014 it just started up like that.",
        "A: So it was almost similar to being in the wagon, you know, in the carriage, on the\nway.",
        "A: Except that it was larger, and bay \u2014 made of logs.",
        "A: No, no, it didn\u2019t move.",

        "A: \u2014 then you could cook on that stove. But after we ga \u2014 that was during the\njourney, right, you are talking about \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1n the ra \u2014 but similar situation was at the destination, where they took us to\nShenchuga, that \u2014 that settlement. So, it\u2019s \u2014 the homes were just like I describe, and\nyou could \u2014 you would get cooked meal at the dining room. There was a large\ndining room, a co-community dining room.",
        "A: Where they provide you with food, you didn\u2019t have to pay for it.",
        "A: Yeah, well, they were given \u2014 they were giving bread. At every station they were\ngiving bread.",

        "A: In the middle of the forest, but there were like a road, and a little cabin on both\nsides, and then another row, and another row. So there was \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s probably a\n\u2014a-\u2014a-\u2014maybe between 30 and 40.",
        "A: They were people already living in s \u2014 in half of it.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, they were tell, you are here to work in the forest, until you\npodokneish(ph). In other words, until you die. But it \u2014 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014 this word die is\nnot regular death, but if you \u2014 by the time you just end your life.

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. For the next day. But it wasn\u2019t that \u2014 I mean that \u2014 it\u2019s not that typical,\nreally.",

        "A: Because there was schools for the Russian people there. So, until I was 14 years\nold, which, only few months, then I could stop going to school, and go to work.\nAnd this is what I did, cause I didn\u2019t want to go to school there, so I started working\nwhen I was 14 years old.",

        "A: \u2014 regular tracks. Well, we had to push this to where the other people were cutting\nthe \u2014 the wood to shorter pieces. We collect those ends, put them on the thing, and\ntake it to the boiler area.",

        "A: Potato, and you \u2014 basically soup, made with fish. So they would, let\u2019s say, cut\nthe heads off of a fish, and the fish would go to some restaurants or something like\nthat, and the heads, they would make soup with \u2014 with the heads. So, it was like a\nclam chowder.",
        "A: Yeah \u2014 no, but they were heads. Head fishes floating. And it was very popular,\nyeah.",
        "A: Well, yeah, no, but usually they always \u2014 there was some \u2014 some vegetable that\nthey could use \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 make soup. But, as I say basically, they were oh \u2014 community dining rooms.",

I \u2014 if I wanted to buy all the f \u2014 bread that I was allowed, then there was\nnothing left. But sometimes I didn\u2019t buy, I only bought two portions of bread. So I\n111\nJanuary 24, 2015\nspent two rubles, and I had two rubles spared. So then I could do \u2014 do something\nelse with this money.",
        "A: Now there\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: And that \u2014 that \u2014 that was day from day, day after day after day.",
        "A: No, they continued to die. There were a lot of people there were dying. Lot of\npeople dying, during the short time that we were there, I would say about 200\npeople died. And later on I got a better job because I decided to become a shepherd.\nSo re \u2014 those local Russians who lived there for \u2014 for many years, they were born\nthere and everything, they were free, right? So they had goats. Each family had one\nor two goats. So they needed a shepherd to \u2014 to tend to these goats. So myself and\nmy mother, we decided, you know, to \u2014 to get that job, or take the job if nobody\nwanted it, or couldn\u2019t, or whatever. So we \u2014 what I used to have a \u2014 a little wooden\npiece like this on a string, and I had two little pieces of wood, you know, like \u2014 like\nthe orchestra guy has, you know what that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and I used to do it, pum-para-rum-pum, pum-para-rum-pum, in the morning,\nabout five o\u2019clock. And these goats start coming out of their sheds on the main\nroad. And when there was about 350 - 400 of them gathered together, then I took\nthem to the pasture. And I took care of them during the day, and they were just\nfeeding on \u2014 on the grass.",
        "A: I would mind them, take care so no \u2014 nobon \u2014 no one was lost. And in the\nevening I brought them back, and each one knew where \u2014 where she belongs. You\nknow, it\u2019s funny. I just brought them into this little village, and they \u2014 they found\ntheir own homes, and well \u2014",
        "A: And then I was paid for it by the owners of the goats, and also they gave me\nmilk, or some other things.",
        "A: Oh jeez, no.",
        "A: I could, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 forbid \u2014 God forbid, I would \u2014",
        "A: No, it was strict, strict, everything, you know. And they said, they \u2014 if you did\nsomething wrong, by their \u2014 well, I mean, if there \u2014 did something wrong, like\nmaybe milk them, or so \u2014 it\u2019s bad, so you would be punished.",
        "A: Severely. I would be pun \u2014 la \u2014 people there are really well aware, well behaved,\nbecause they knew that punishment was really severe.",
        "A: Yeah, some \u2014 some people \u2014 but they were not paid, but they just gave me,\nmaybe a pint of milk, you know, something like \u2014 some nice people, some owners\nmaybe had two or three goats, so they would give us some milk.",
        "A: Ah, yeah \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, yeah, there were \u2014 there was chickens too, yeah, yeah, good, except that\noh you \u2014 you didn\u2019t have any food to feed them, so what, they were just feeding\nthemselves.January 24, 2015",
        "A: But there was no feed to keep these chickens, so how many can you \u2014 I know\nthat there were some families that had chicken, yes. We didn\u2019t. We did not have,\nmy mother and we didn\u2019t have, or my father didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t have anything,\nyeah.",

        "A: \u2014 to you \u2014 you were saying, you know, how \u2014 how they dress and everything, my\nsister was also working in the \u2014 in the forest, cutting this wood down, just like man.\nSo, during the winter, she would have those pants on her, and when she came home,\nthey were like frozen like tubes.",
        "A: So she just let them out, you know, get out of this, you know, and put them by\nthe stove to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to get warm, to dry. They were standing like you \u2014 just standing \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 pants.January 24, 2015",
        "A: And it would just melt and dry, by the next morning it would be dry. Well, that\nwas terr \u2014 in the summer it\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Well sure, of course, that\u2019s why a lot of people lost health. Lot of people\nsuffered later, the \u2014 you know, later in the life.",
        "A: Having \u2014 God thank \u2014 thank God that it didn\u2019t last too long, because in 1942, we\nwere freed. We were allowed to \u2014 to leave Russia.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, they shared, but there was no community life. Impossible, you know,\neverybody was just work and sleep in the log. Everybody \u2014 there were no social\nlife, let\u2019s say.\n116January 24, 2015",
        "A: No gatherings, nothing.",

        "A: \u2014 and his wife. Yeah.",
        "A: No, they were just \u2014 I don\u2019t know, indifferent really. I mean, they \u2014 they\nsuffered, but it was so common, every family would lose somebody. Every family\nthat I know of, lost somebody. Or the father died, or mother died, or some of their\nsiblings. Every family lost. So there was people \u2014 well, I [indecipherable] problem,\nand just very different, and they didn\u2019t despair, they didn\u2019t [indecipherable]. They\nwere \u2014 of course they suffered emotionally. But nobody cared. Nobody cared.\n117\nJanuary 24, 2015\nOfficially, the Russians that were, let\u2019s say, in charge of that area, they didn\u2019t care.\nYou know, they were \u2014 openly said, you are here to \u2014 to \u2014 to die.",
        "A: Just like [indecipherable] say, there is a word, different word for it, animal\ndeath \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and human death. And they would say, you will die like an animal.",
        "A: Podokneish(ph). You can look it up in a dictionary.",
        "A: Ah terrible, ah yeah, terrible. And maybe I should also mention that where we\nlived, there were some Russians that were there before us, and I \u2014 they were from\n1934 when \u2014 when Stalin deliberately starved a lot of people, or send them to\nSiberia. But on the other side of the river, there were just a re \u2014 remains of an old\nbuildings. Nobody lived there, but it was quite a large area maybe, I don\u2019t know,\nlike few blocks of our, maybe five, 10 blocks, completely empty, only ruins. And\nmostly what \u2014 what was standing were chimneys, because they were made of brick,\nand the fireplaces. Because in that old time, there were just fireplaces, and not like\ngas cookers, or anything like that. Just a box with a \u2014 with room for \u2014 for coal orJanuary 24, 2015\nwood, and a metal plate on top, where you could boil something. So only those\nthings remained. And I used to go there, and looking for various things, and never\nfound anything. But the ruins were there, large area.",
        "A: They \u2014 yeah, they were the people from way behi \u2014 way before. I mean, way\nseveral years. Let\u2019s say \u00b035, and this was *40, so not \u2014 not that mu \u2014 long, you\nknow, not that long.",
        "A: So, this \u2014 what do you call it? These \u2014 this whole area was completely dead,\nempty, because they say that some kind of disease fell over there. And just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 wiped everybody, right. So they \u2014 whoever was left, was moved to the other\nside of the river, and that\u2019s the \u2014 the new one, new area where we were \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 placed.",

        "A: Shenchuga.\n119\nJanuary 24, 2015",
        "A: And the larger place was Poduga. There was a hospital there, and \u2014",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t this part \u2014 yeah, this area was abandoned completely. Only ruins were\nthere.",
        "A: When \u2014 when the Germany attacked Russia \u2014",
        "A: June 22\", 1941, we suddenly became allies with Russia, because Poland had\nthe government in England.",
        "A: There was a government in exile. And we were allied with France, England,\nand some \u2014 Ireland, something like that. So we suddenly, since the Germans\nattacked Russia, we became ally \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with the ru \u2014 with Russians. So the Russian says, now you are free, you\u2019re free.\nYou can go a will \u2014 anywhere you go \u2014 anywhere you want.January 24, 2015",
        "A: No, it\u2019s fa \u2014 it traveled very fast.",
        "A: Except nobody took any action. We knew that Germany is at war with Russia,\nwe knew that. And the Russian told us right away. It happened in June, but in \u2014 in si\n\u2014 August \u2014 in August, the Polish government in exile already had an agreement\nwith the Russian government.",
        "A: Well, they said, you are free, you can leave, you can go away if you want.",
        "A: Right \u2014 well, two months later, maybe.",
        "A: Two months.",
        "A: I can \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Because it was in \u2014 in \u2014 in August that we were actually told that we can \u2014 oh,\nand they give us papers.January 24, 2015",
        "A: And \u2014 certificates that we can travel anywhere we want, because before, we\ncouldn\u2019t leave the area.

No, no, January. Until January \u201942. On the\nnew year, the first of January, \u201942, my family finally decided to leave Russia.",
        "A: Because they didn\u2019t know what to do, they didn\u2019t know where to go. You\ncouldn\u2019t go back to Poland, because Germans overrun Poland, you know, they\nwere at war with Russia. So \u2014 and where were \u2014 people were asking, what are we\ngoing to do? Said well, maybe we should move, maybe we should go south. And\nthere \u2014 then, most of them did go south. But that was later.",
        "A: Well, it was only from a psychological point of view that we are free. But av \u2014\neverything just went the same way.",
        "A: Whoever \u2014 yes, whoever worked in the forest, you know, they worked in the\nforest, but they were treated differently. They were free citizens. We were free. So\nwe had something to say, and we had some rights, let\u2019s say, at that time. Because\nwe already had the Polish government in England, who was looking after our\ninterests. So they were talking to the Russian government, and the Russian \u2014\nRussian allowed more freedom, and better \u2014 better conditions and better pay, and\neverything else. They started treating us differently.",
        "A: Absolutely, right. They changed. And like I say, me \u2014 a lot of people left earlier.\nLike my brother Frank, the second from the top, he left in August.",
        "A: He left right away. Went to south, Uzbekistan, and we decided, I don\u2019t know\nwhy, but my mother and my father were not ready, or didn\u2019t know what to do. So\nwe stayed until the first of January, \u00b042.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. It was entirely different story, as I say. He was running that newspaper in\nRowna, and when the r \u2014 Russian \u2014 Soviet \u2014 Soviet Union came into Poland, they\n123\nJanuary 24, 2015\narrested him right away, and we never heard from him, until 19 \u2014 long, long \u2014 40 \u2014\nwait a minute? Forty-three? Forty-four? Maybe we didn\u2019t hear from him at all, we\ndidn\u2019t know what happened to him. But now I know that he was arrested and sent to\nthe \u2014 the \u2014 Kolyma.

        "A: Roman was with us.",
        "A: With us, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. At that area, that Poselok. Shenchuga.",
        "A: So we left together.",
        "A: Only Frank left sooner.\nJanuary 24, 2015",
        "A: Yes, exactly right. Exactly right, we \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 we ne \u2014 found out that there is\na Polish army being organized in the south of Russia.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where we \u2014 most of the people decided to leave Russia, go south.\nAnd after we reached Uzbekistan, the army sort of extended their protection of\nRussia, and they took care of us, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, from \u2014 from the Shenchuga to the railway station, we were by sleigh.",
        "A: Sleigh. We hired it [indecipherable] or whatever. The Russians provided the\ntransportation.",
        "A: And then they also allowed us to use regular passenger trains, at that time,\npassenger trains.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s right, and \u2014 and we didn\u2019t have to pay for the journey.",
        "A: So \u2014 but \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, to Uzbekistan.",
        "A: And from Uzbekistan, we were moved to Persia. Iran.",
        "A: Oh yes, they \u2014 it was by train. From then on, everything was by train.",
        "A: Or \u2014 or no \u2014 part of it was just a freight train again.",
        "A: But under free conditions, you know, the better conditions and it didn\u2019t last that\nlong, because it was fast, you know, they didn\u2019t put us on the side or anything,\ndidn\u2019t have to wait. It was just from here to there, from \u2014 from Gouza(ph), or\nJakobak(ph), there were to places on the south. We went to Caspian Sea,\nKrasnovodsk \u2014",
        "A: On Caspian Sea, and from there by ship to Persia.\n126January 24, 2015",
        "A: It \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much problem, because when we reached Uzbekistan in\nFebruary \u2014 it took two months to get from north to \u2014 to the south. That I remember,\ntwo months, by various means, basically freight train. So when they \u2014 when we\ncame to Uzbekistan, Polish authorities, which were already trying to help this\ncivilian population, say that we are going to move you away from Russia, into\nPersia. So, it was a very short period of time, only two weeks when \u2014 when my\nmother and sister and I was assigned to leave Russia, in March.",
        "A: And since we came by the end of February, so only a few weeks. And we were\nalready, as far as I\u2019m concerned, ready to leave, and I fell sick with typhus. Typhoid\nfever. So they couldn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t allow me, because the transport was ready to \u2014\nto leave Russia, to Persia, and a\u2014 we were assigned to this transport, but because\nof my sickness, I was retained there. Authority says no, you cannot travel, because\nyou'll spread \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 typhoid to other people. So they took me to a hospital, and my mother said, I\nam staying with you, I am staying with you. I am staying I\u2019m \u2014 until you get well,\nand we\u2019ll see what happens. But my brother Roman, he was already in\nadministrative position, he was trying to help all these civilian people get relocated,\nor taken care of, he says \u2014 he said, Mother, you leave with my sister, you go, and go\nto Persia, and I will take care of Tony. Or me. So don\u2019t worry about him, he will be\nall right.",
        "A: Oh, my father died in Russia, we didn\u2019t say anything about that.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And he says that he told Mother to go, that we \u2014 we will follow later\non, because at that time it was this time on a lot of people were leaving, Polish\npeople were leaving Russia under General Anders. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s\nfamiliar to you. He was in charge of the Polish army, which was being organized in\nthe south of Russia. He was in charge of everything, civilians, and the military.",
        "A: So from then on we \u2014 we were really taken care of, because British were already\nhelping to take care of the Pole \u2014 civilians.",
        "A: Yes. So Mother and Sister left for Persia in March, and I stayed behind \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and took me to a hospital, and I spent there for two weeks in a hospital. And\nwhen I got well, I was released from the hospital and joined a Polish young soldiers.\nIt was no \u2014 a sel \u2014 special unit being organized for the young people, say from 14 to\n17.",
        "A: I was 14 years, 15.",
        "A: Going on 15. So I was accepted to this Polish young army.",
        "A: \u2014 ko \u2014 like a cadet.",
        "A: He \u2014 yes, he was already south, he was safe.\n129January 24, 2015",
        "A: He was safe, and he joined the army and then left Russia early. And my mother\nand sister also left in March, while I stayed behind until August.",
        "A: Yes, quite a while, because then they stopped the transpor \u2014 transports. I don\u2019t\nknow whose decision it was, but only a few thousand people left during the march \u2014\nexodus I call it, let\u2019s say exodus. And then, until August, nobody left Russia. But in\nAugust they resumed leaving \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because General Anders was then in charge of the army and everybody that\nwas there, and he negotiated with the Russian people, with the Russian authorities.\nSo, in August they resumed, and they moved about hundred thousand people at that\ntime.",
        "A: Huge number, but it was all concentrated. August \u2014 and mainly August, yeah, a\nlot of people left.",
        "A: And then when \u2014 I also left Russia.",
        "A: Roman, yes \u2014January 24, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 yes, right, yes.",
        "A: Yes, for the administrator there, the main them \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 boss of that area. And then he started getting sick. And on \u2014 on the first, like I\nmentioned, on the first of January, we le \u2014 we decided to leave. And he was already\nvery sick, very sick. But, we started the journey. And on the 17\" day of the journey,\nhe passed away, during the journey. And it was Perm, a place near Ural mountains.\nHe \u2014 he died, and I \u2014 I was, up to the last moment with him. We were talking, and\nhe was saying goodbye, and you know, that \u2014 and he just gave up. And we left him\non a platform, because when the train sto \u2014 I said, Mother \u2014 it was about one\no\u2019clock in the morning, I said, Father just passed away. Well, so the first time \u2014 the\nfirst thing, the train stopped at the station, I remember, the Perm station, you know.\nThey took his body out, and put it on a railroad platform, you know, like there are\ntracks on large stations, so there are platforms between the tracks. So there were\nalready about maybe 50 corpses on the platform, so we just took him. My \u2014\nRoman, because we traveled together, and myself, and we just left him on the\n131January 24, 2015\nrailroad platform, without \u2014 without funeral. We \u2014 we tried to get some kind of\narrangement, but 1t was impossible, you know, there \u2014 it\u2019s impossible, just leave\nhere, and a-as I say, there were already large heap of corpses there. So we just put\nsome wrapping around him, left the corpse there. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 that was the\nPerm railroad station, because in Russia, there was just tru \u2014 you know,\ncommunication, rails. That \u2014 that was the main \u2014 main system of moving around,\neither freight train or passenger train, but passenger trains very, very rare.",
        "A: No, he was \u2014 we were \u2014 I was talking to him and saying goodbye. But after he\ngave up, then I \u2014 I woke my mother.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know when he is going to have the last breath. I didn\u2019t know that.",
        "A: But it happened during the night, and I \u2014 I knew when it happens, and then I\nwoke my mother, and \u2014 and I said, the first thing we stopped at the station, they put\nhim on the platform, and \u2014 and he was left there, with others. But the death was the\nnormal way there, you know. Inhuman, terrible to talk about. Nobody can\nunderstand that. We were treated \u2014 I can\u2019t even say. Worse than animals, by theJanuary 24, 2015\nRussians. They didn\u2019t care. Because it \u2014 that was Stalin\u2019s policy. You are here until\nyou die, but in our case, we were \u2014 I mean, blessed that it \u2014 that we did get out of\nthat hell. It was pure hell. People don\u2019t realize like \u2014 you know, no \u2014 no clinic, no\ndoctor, no help. No, it \u2014 they \u2014 they didn\u2019t care. We die here or there, today,\ntomorrow. Nobody cared. Only you family cared, nobody else. The main thing was\nto get some food. That was the main thing and then I think that was Stalin\u2019s policy,\nyou know, starve the people so they cannot do anything else but think about how to\nsurvive.",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to continue, because this 1s \u2014\nthis is the worst. Worst moment of the life.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe a little, how about \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 getting some water, or \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 soda.",
        "A: \u2014 the Germans were \u2014 were leading some prisoners along the road, from one\nplace to another because they were, let\u2019s say, taken to do \u2014 do some work\nsomewhere. Like dig ditches, or something like that, and th-they were going home,\nand there was a farmer bringing some potatoes. And some potatoes fell. A raw\npotato fell on the ground, and this guy grabbed this potato, and started \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 eating a si\u2014 a raw potato. But the German pri \u2014 g-guard, when saw it, he shot\nhim. And he was still eating when he was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 falling, he was still eating that bre \u2014 that \u2014",
        "A: Who \u2014 who would believe something like that, that one man can do to another?\nWhy \u2014 why \u2014 why did we have this concentration camp? Why they\u2019re so \u2014 you\nknow, mean to each other? Why?",
        "A: I want answer, why people fall for all, that they forget that they are human being,\nthat they have soul, and responsibility. We \u2014 we are not vegetable. We are people\nwith feelings, with soul. Those who believe, I don\u2019t know, some people don\u2019t\nbelieve that, but I \u2014 I believe. I\u2014 I\u2019m a religious person. So I cannot imagine how\n134January 24, 2015\nanother human being could be so mean, you know, to his fellow man. But I \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know. I\u2019ve seen a lot in my life.",
        "A: No, this \u2014 then the \u2014 no, it did not occur to me like that, but I did question, you\nknow, how can these people be saved, or something like that, you know how \u2014\nmaybe there isn\u2019t. But, if somebody commits such a crime against another human\nbeing, he has to pay for it. It would be unfair if these people who were so sav \u2014\nsavages to another people, went free. I \u2014 I cannot imagine that. So I think that there\nis \u2014 there must be some justice, oh, some justice that people will pay somehow, one\nway or the other. But maybe there isn\u2019t a way. Well, on the other hand, you know,\nthis is probably not for social discussion.",
        "A: Question.",
        "A: Question that I have chance to raise with you, for instance, you know.",
        "A: But we discuss these things, we\u2019re friends, I mean, you know.January 24, 2015",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Sure, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, I\u2014I talked about it a lot, because my \u2014 my daughter is married to a\nAmerican \u2014 not native American, but an American of so many, many years, let\u2019s\nsay. So they \u2014 they often want to hear something of what I have to tell them, and\nsometimes, you know, I wonder if they ever get th-the real feeling what I have to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 share, yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no, of course not.",
        "A: Krasnovodsk.",
        "A: Sea.",
        "A: No, it \u2014 the journey was done on a oil tanker. There were \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 oil tankers, because they were out of those ships in that area. So they just put\nus on \u2014 on top, on \u2014 on the deck. It was all metal, and if you can imagine August\nsun beating in that area, which is south, real close to the meridian.",
        "A: It was hot, and the metal deck was really, you know, very, very hot.",
        "A: I guess, yeah. Maybe \u2014 hey, people said that they would \u2014 and a lot \u2014 and lack of\nwater, that was very bad thing, because before got on that tank, we had these little\ncanteens, so filled with water, maybe say a quart of water in there, and it \u2014 it \u2014\njourney took three year \u2014 three days. So, that water didn\u2019t last long, and there was\nno water to get on the ship.",
        "A: So it was real \u2014 that was real bad, but we knew that we are getting towards\nfreedom, we are leaving Russia, so everything was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 bearable.",
        "A: We \u2014 we were glad to. And after we disembarked in Pahlevi \u2014 Pahlavi, in\nPersia, well, people were just kneeling on the sand, after we got off the tra \u2014 off the\nships in the port, and marched towards the transit area, where there were tents, large\ntents where we could, you know, relax, and \u2014 and one thing, there was one tent\nwhere the \u2014 everybody had to go through that. We strip \u2014 stripped everything down,\nleft. Showers. New, fresh clothes at the other end of the tent, out into the freedom.\nThat was like heaven.",
        "A: Yeah. You entered one, leave everything behind, and out the other side. That\nwas \u2014 yeah. Beautiful moment. That\u2019s when we left Russia.",
        "A: After \u2014",
        "A: Praying.",
        "A: Praying and thanking God for \u2014 because we knew that everything was in past.",
        "A: That \u2014 because the British were taking care of us then.",
        "A: New set of clothes, and I joined the \u2014 the si \u2014 they call them young people. It\nwas just like a cadet level, you know, that area. And they gave us uniforms. They\nwere like semi-military uniforms, and they drafted us into this \u2014 these schools.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s about right, yes. Well \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 15\u201415 \u2014\u201942. It was in \u201942.January 24, 2015",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: In Persia.",
        "A: Unfortunately no, because they were always ahead of me. When I came to \u2014 to\nPersia, I found out that they left for Africa two weeks \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 before we arrived there.",
        "A: Roman saw them. Because like si \u2014 I said, he was in administrative position, so\nhe was taking care of these movements and how the transports were coming in, so\nhe would register them, and say you go here, you go here, you know. So he had\n140\nJanuary 24, 2015\npossibility to \u2014 to meet a lot of people, and he saw Mother and \u2014 and \u2014 and daughter\n\u2014 and \u2014 Mother and Sister.",
        "A: And they \u2014 they left for Teheran, and then from Teheran to \u2014 for Africa, but I\nnever caught up with them until \u201948, in England.",
        "A: After the war, a \u2014 that was well after the war.",

        "A: \u2014 ended. Sa \u2014 so we got reya \u2014 reunited in \u201948 in England, because they came\nfrom Africa to England and we all \u2014 the whole family got together, except Father.",
        "A: I call it a cadet, but maybe it\u2019s not the right way, because cadet is a little higher.\nBut it was young, Polish soldiers, they called them.",
        "A: Young Polish soldier, or boys\u2019 training school.",
        "A: Things like that. Those are the names that come up.",
        "A: So -",
        "A: Regular units. We were like military \u2014 paramilitary units, but we went to regular\nschool, and also training \u2014 military training.",
        "A: Both. Parallel, you know. Morning, learning geography, history, math, etcetera,\nin temporary classes. There were no, like schools, but there were some kind of areas\nwhere we would gather, and there were professor, or teachers. And we had notes,\nyou know, notebooks, to take notes. And we were learning, learning all the time.\nAnd then, further up, as we moved away from Russia to Persia, and from\nPalestine, then we started getting regular education, in regular surrounding, in nice\nclasses, brick buildings, and \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 just went up. Up and up, up.",

So they were always interested in hearing\nmy stories, just like now. Maybe not to the full extent \u2014\nJanuary 24, 2015",
        "A: \u2014 like now. So, as the \u2014 the \u2014 the little girls, they were playing somewhere, you\nknow, etcetera. Then suddenly, they were asking me questions. Says, how do you\nknow? Oh, I \u2014 I listen to you. Yes, and they are one in Chicago, and one other is in\nMinneapolis. Both very bright young ladies.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014 I feel that they understand, yes. They understand, and I say \u2014 I was\nsurprised, you know, how they ne \u2014 heard almost \u2014 I mean, they were never in the\nsame, say company, they were playing somewhere \u2014",
        "A: \u20141n the same room, though. But she remembered, especially the \u2014 the younger\none, they say, oh Dziadziu \u2014 dziadziu means grandpa, yes, I remember how you\nwere talking, you know, about your experiences, and \u2014 and they were interested,\nand still are, you know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I don\u2019t expect them to really understand, but I would like them to know how\nfragile is the human character, or something, that you know, people can change\nfrom being very nice, to being really like an animal to one another. Which I think\nyou have to be conscious of it and be careful, because you never know what these\npeople are capable of doing to one another. This is, unfortunately, my experience.\nAnd I \u2014 I hope that this will never happen to anybody, the way it happened to me.\nBut they should be aware of the human frailty, or human \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it \u2014\nwhat it is really \u2014 that is capable of changing the character of a \u2014 of a person.",
        "A: I do not understand. I do not understand how can people be so mean to each\nother. They can be a friend and they so mean.",
        "A: It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 to me, it\u2019s against the human nature. People should be friendly to each\nother, helpful. Extend your hand, if you can. Don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t push away the extended\nhand, or be friendly. There \u2014 there is no friendliness among people. And that \u2014January 24, 2015\nthat\u2019s very disappointing. Very disappointing. I\u2014 even now I says, why do people\nfight each o-other, all over?",
        "A: There \u2014 there are some bad, bad people, like the \u2014 you know, those terrorists and\neverything say, but they are bad, they are criminals. But I\u2019m talking about the\naverage person.",
        "A: You know, average person. He can be so nice to you, and you can be friend, and\neverything. Something may happen.",
        "A: And they \u2014 they destroy each other, or th-they are mean to each other. Then that\nhurts me. The meanness of some people. I think I am very friendly to everybody. I\nam. I\u2019m sure of it.",
        "A: I\u2019m very \u2014 oh, I am happy that there is a person who wants to listen to it.",
        "A: And understand \u2014 try to understand.",
        "A: You see, I am 88 years old. How can I influence anybody?",
        "A: There is not a lot opportunity.",
