        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nRomeo Fagiolo, conducted by Ina Navazelskis on March 1\u201c, 2010, at Leisure\nWorld in Silver Spring, Maryland. Mr. Fagiolo, can you tell us a little bit about\nyour background; where you were born; where you grew up; your family, and so on\nand so forth?",
        "Answer: Yeah, I was born in Washington, D.C., and I made a historic beginning. I\nwas born the night that the Knickerbocker Theater in Washington collapsed.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Yeah, that \u2014 they \u2014 the roof collapsed on the 28\", and I was born on the 29\".",
        "Q: On the 29\" of which month and \u2014",
        "A: Of January, 1922.",
        "Q: And you grew up in Washington?",
        "A: I grew up in Washington, I went to all school in here. I went to Central High\nSchool and graduated. And then I was \u2014 I graduated from high school in June of\n\"41. So you know what I was doing on December of \u201942 \u2014",
        "Q: I can imagine.",
        "A: k\u2014or \u201941. So I had no education other than a high school education, and I was\ndrafted in February of \u2014 of 1943, and I took my basic training at the infas \u2014\ninfamous Fort Hood, or at that time was known as Camp Hood. And the camp had\nMarch 1, 2010\njust opened, as a matter of fact, we slept in the motor pool, because the barracks\nweren\u2019t ready for us.",
        "Q: Can you tell us where was this camp?",
        "A: Camp in Texas, in Killeen, Texas. And I \u2014 I stayed there for about a year. I took\nmy basic training there, and I was sent to a s-school. When I graduated from the\nschool, they kept me there as an instructor, and I stayed maybe six or seven months.",
        "Q: How is it that you came into the army rather than one of the other branches of\nmilitary service?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s my own fault, I wanted to go into the Air Force, and I took the Air\nForce exam, passed it. But I was drafted before the Air Force could get to me. And\nthe rule in that day 1s, once you\u2019re drafted, you can\u2019t choose your service.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Your service has to be picked prior to your induction.",
        "Q: Are you the only son in your family?",
        "A: Yes, I-",
        "Q: Were there any girls?",
        "A: Yes, I had one sister, who is now deceased.",
        "Q: And your parents, when you were drafted, how did they respond to it? Were they\nupset, were they \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: No, they weren\u2019t, they \u2014 I \u2014 I think in those days I \u2014 I\u2014 we looked at it as an\nhonor to go into the \u2014 into the army. And if you were rejected, or become a 4F, it\nwas really \u2014 I\u2019ve seen men cry because they were turned down.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But my parents were from Italy. They were born over there. They met while\nthey were in the United States. And the oddity is that two sisters married two\nbrothers. And they were \u2014 well, you know, we just lived here, and my father took\nme down to Georgetown and put me on the bus, and as he was walking away, I saw\nhim cry, I had \u2014 I\u2019d \u2014 I'd never \u2014 never saw \u2014 never saw my father cry too often.\nBut I guess he was happy. But they were always good to me, I had a good family.\nAnd so I went to Fort Hood. And after I taught there for awhile, I tried to get out of\nteaching. I \u2014 I wanted to get into a \u2014 a lion outfit, which was a \u2014 not \u2014 not\nnecessarily a fighting outfit, but do something other than just teach my whole\ncareer. So I put in for what they called ASTP.",
        "Q: What does that stand for?",
        "A: I-It stand for Army Specialized Training Corp.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the purpose of that was, you would go to some university, get a degree from\ncollege, and upon graduation you were obligated to serve two years as an officer in\nMarch 1, 2010\nthe army. So I went to Texas A&M, and I was there about maybe four months, and\nthey disbanded \u2014",
        "Q: The program?",
        "A: \u2014 the program. So they sent me back, at that time was Camp Hood, and during\nthe interim, the camp had changed from a \u2014 a tank destroyer, to the infantry.",
        "Q: Why was it called an infamous camp?",
        "A: Well, ni \u2014 because of the recent \u2014 the recent episode \u2014",
        "Q: Ah, that.",
        "A: Yeah, that.",
        "Q: Okay, because of that, okay, yeah.",
        "A: But it \u2014 1t\u2014 it\u2019s one of the largest camps in the U.S. Army. I think from one end\nof the spectrum to the other is like 26 miles. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a \u2014",
        "Q: Okay. So you\u2019re talking about a shooting that took place in 2009, but you were\nthere half a century \u2014",
        "A: Before.",
        "Q: \u2014 before. Yeah, okay.",
        "A: So anyway, I ended up in the infantry, and I did one -I\u2014I was a\n[indecipherable] for one cycle, training soldiers. And then I got orders to go to\nMarch 1, 2010\nCamp Gruber, Oklahoma, which was the 42\" infantry division. And I was in that\ncamp, I think July or in August, and we moved out in \u2014 in November, probably \u2014",
        "Q: How large was the division?",
        "A: It was \u2014 well, one infantry division usually consists of about 30,000 men.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a lot.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and you moved out in \u2014",
        "A: Well, then \u2014 then \u2014 then we were shipped overseas.",
        "Q: In what time?",
        "A: It was in November of \u00b044.",
        "Q: So, already after D-Day.",
        "A: Oh yeah. D-Day had passed.",
        "Q: And so where \u2014 where was your first European landing with the division?",
        "A: In Marseilles.",
        "Q: In Marseilles, okay.",
        "A: And from there we went up and we caught the lines. And the reason they closed\nthe ASTP is that they had lost more men on D-Day than \u2014 than we\u2019ve advertised or\nreported. So they were short of infantry people. And when we went over, we were\nonly the three infantry divisions. Artillery, the medics and everything else didn\u2019t\nMarch 1, 2010\ncome over until January. So when we got there, they told us we were going to a\nquiet sector, the whole alliance. Well, the quiet sector turned out to be the Battle of\nthe Bulge.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: At Bastogne.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: So we lo \u2014 we were green soldiers and we probably made a lot of mistakes, but\nwe lost a lot of good men.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about what happened to you, what you remember from that\ntime, where you were?",
        "A: You mean from \u2014",
        "Q: When you were in these battles, when you were in the \u2014 you know, when you\nhad landed in Marseilles, your first memories of what you saw.",
        "A: Saw is just going up through France, which we \u2014 by that time had already been\nsecured. And the thing I remember is the civilians, they had soo set \u2014 two sets of\nflags. They had a white one and \u2014 and an American one. So it depend who was\ngoing by, which flag they would wave out of the window.",
        "Q: Oh my. Oh my.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: But we landed, it was very cold. We landed at what they call CP2, which was a",
        "Q: Mm-hm, what does that mean?",
        "A: That was where they organized the \u2014 the soldiers at \u2014 at \u2014 once they co \u2014 you\nleave the boat. And that\u2019s where we met Bed Check Charlie, that was a German\nplane. They would come over every night, and that was a nickname that we gave\nthem.",
        "Q: Bad check Charlie?",
        "A: Bal \u2014 Bed Check Charlie.",
        "Q: Bed Check Charlie.",
        "A: Yeah. He made sure we got to bed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Never fired on us, just flew over. So that was it, and then they \u2014 they rushed us\nto the front, and that\u2019s when we hit the \u2014 the Battle of the Bulge, the snow and the\nfreezing weather, and \u2014",
        "Q: You were in that?",
        "A: Yeah, I was in that. I went over as a corporal, and we lost so many men, that I\nbecame a staff sergeant overnight.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: Were you \u2014 and how long did that battle la \u2014 well, th \u2014 for you, how long did that\nbattle last?",
        "A: That battle last until the end of January.",
        "Q: So for \u2014 for \u2014",
        "A: For a month, five weeks.",
        "Q: For a month, five weeks.",
        "A: And my birthday is the 29\" of January, and that was the date that they took us\noff the front, and that was my birthday present.",
        "Q: Pretty good birthday present.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: I remember when I lived in The Netherlands, there is a cemetery outside the\ntown that I lived, maintained by the American military, and they had bring \u2014\nbrought 1n a lot of the soldiers who died in the Battle of the Bulge. Not only that\nbattle, but a lot of others.",
        "A: Oh, that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: It was \u2014 and th-the hills are just covered, they\u2019re just covered. And f \u2014 very\nmoving, very moving to walk around there.",
        "A: It is, it is, itis. The first person that I lost when we hit the front, was wit \u2014 was an\nold timer, and he was drafted when he was 30, you know, and that was the upper\nMarch 1, 2010\n[indecipherable]. And we became good friends. He was in the insurance business,\nmy father was also, so we had a little common interest in that. Before we went\noverseas, we used to go to the PX \u2014",
        "Q: [sneeze] Excuse me, excuse me. I was going to stifle that one.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s all right, that\u2019s all right. So anyway, we became good friends, we\u2019d go\nto the PX and so forth. And the first night that we were in battle, I had a sleeping\nbag, it was down. And I got it on a raffle, cause they only gave one per platoon. So\nthe first night we tried to bed down, I couldn\u2019t find my bedroll. And it was common\nin the army to say it was a midnight requisition, that somebody had acquired it. So\nanyway, the next day \u2014 his name was Clifford, he came over to me and he says,\nRomeo, I\u2019m sorry, I grabbed your bedroll by mistake. Cause he knew it was mine,\ncause it was the only one.",
        "Q: That was down.",
        "A: So I said, that\u2019s okay, Cliff. But anyway, about three hours later, he was dead, so\nI always felt that he had his last night on this good earth, in my nice sleeping bag.",
        "Q: At least warm, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. So \u2014",
        "Q: Do you \u2014 were you there when he \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: No, he was on another si \u2014 another gun post. We were in the anti-tank, and when\nwe got there we were supposed to have three anti-tank guns, and three trucks. And\nwe got no t\u2014 we had no trucks, and two guns.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And then we lost his gun, the Germans fired a direct hit. As a matter of fact, it\nwas told to me later that \u2014 that an 88 shell hit him in the head. And when I went\nthere after 1t was over, there was a fellow called Valentime(ph), he had red hair,\nand there was red hair all over the guns and place. So anyway, that was his last\nnight on earth, with my bedroll.",
        "Q: Was that the first time you had seen such \u2014 you had seen \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 that sort of thing?",
        "A: That was the first battle, the first. So after that, a-after January, after my\nbirthday, we had lost so many men, they took us back and we organized this, and\nrefilled the ranks.",
        "Q: Where did they take you to?",
        "A: I-It was in France, close to Nancy, France, and we \u2014 we were there about three\nweeks before they got all the men back together. And so we stayed there until\nMarch 1, 2010\nMarch, the first of March, and then that\u2019s when we tried \u2014 had the offensive, that we\nwent through the \u2014",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about that?",
        "A: Yeah, well, that was really \u2014 the resistance wa-wasn\u2019t too heavy. But it was buth\n\u2014 y-you\u2019d hit \u2014 certain times when you would hit little resistance and then you\nwould go in reserve, and then the next day you might move 20 miles with nothing,\nno resistance.",
        "Q: And was this already through southern Germany, or was this still in France?",
        "A: Th-Th \u2014 no, no, we had \u2014 still in France, and we didn\u2019t cross the Rhine, and I\nremember it was Easter Sunday.",
        "Q: At what point did you cross the Rhine, at what place? Do you remember?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t. But it was a \u2014 but probably in the south.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was south Germany. And then, and from that point on, it was just \u2014\nwe went through \u2014 we took v-various th \u2014 Daun, we took Schweinfurt, we took \u2014\nwe \u2014 we took th \u2014 three or four \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 cities.",
        "Q: Is it \u2014 did you come in contact with German POWs?\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: As you were coming along, yeah? As you were going there.",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, they were surrendering, and the story that I always tell, we were in\nreserve, and I \u2014 they used to give us a chocolate bar to eat. And I was eating that,\nand I had a tap on my shoulder and I turned around. And it was a German soldier,\nand he had a white flag.",
        "Q: And he wanted some chocolate?",
        "A: Well, I guess maybe he did, but that he had a circular from Eisenhower\nencouraging the Germans to surrender, and that they would be well taken care of,\nand so forth. So, he was all alone, and I didn't know what to do with him. And\nluckily, there were other Germans coming from the front, quite a few of them, so I\njust told him to fall in with the rest of them, and that was the last time I saw him.",
        "Q: Did he \u2014 was he young, or old?",
        "A: Ah, ah, n\u2014 he \u2014 he wasn\u2019t young, but he wasn\u2019t old. You \u2014 I \u2014 he must have\nbeen 30 or 40. I tell you, their faces were dirty, they were beard. Y-You know, it\nwas really to distinguish the age. And in those days, you know, e-every time we got\na German prisoner, they always say, you know, nicht schiessen, you know, Polack,\nPolack, you know. Don\u2019t shoot me, boy.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t shoot me, I\u2019m a Pole.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: \u2019ma Pole. And that\u2019s what they would do.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But \u2014",
        "Q: Did you come in contact with the civilian population?",
        "A: Oh, a-as you go through the town.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. And was there a difference between the French and the German\ntowns as you were going through them?",
        "A: Yes. First of all, you could tell the \u2014 being a German, the civilians were well\nclothed. The French had nothing. Clothes, you could tell the difference, I don\u2019t\nknow about soap and things like that, but once you hit Germany, there was a\ndifferent class of people, and that they had a better part of the life. And some of the\nstories that the Frenchmen tell, it\u2019s a \u2014 you know, it\u2019s disgraceful.",
        "Q: What did you hear? What were some of those stories that the \u2014 that the French\nwere telling?",
        "A: Oh, well I got \u2014I got it in here, the \u2014 a story that \u2014 actually, this was 1n \u2014 in\nFrance, a lady that \u2014 they were in nor \u2014 Norway, and it was a fishing town, and\nthey were sending messages to \u2014 to Russia, and Russia would send them to\nEngland, and the Germans caught them. And there were seven of them. So they\ntook the men out and they want them to dig their own graves. So one of them was\nMarch 1, 2010\nslow doing it, and when the officer, the German officer was pushing him along, he\nsays, I\u2019m in no hurry, I sh \u2014 he says, I know what I\u2019m digging. So the German got\nmad and spit on him. And this \u2014 and the fisherman, with his spade, turned around\nand hit him with such force, that he actually decapitated him.",
        "Q: Oh!",
        "A: And of course, when he did that, that was the end of it, and the other Germans\nhad killed the rest of them. And in retaliation, they took the wives, seven wives, and\nthey took them to \u2014 to Germany and this one lady that she had a eight months old\nbaby girl, and when she got on the boat, they took the baby from her, and the put it\non a crib, in a box on the deck of the ship. And when she came out the next morning\nthe baby was gone. And of course they assumed that \u2014 that they just threw her\noverboard. And she ended up as a \u2014 working fine wires for the German in some\nfactory. And when they were \u2014 when she was liberated \u2014 I wasn\u2019t there,\nincidentally, this was told to me by, you know, another company, that those women\nwere all in cells. They would open the cells, and they wouldn\u2019t come out. And they\nwould tell them, you know, you\u2019re free, you\u2019re free. But they were just scared. They\ndidn\u2019t know \u2014 1-1-1-it makes you cry, it really does. The people were just scared,\nthey lived from day to day. They never knew when they were going to be the last\nday. They finally coaxed them out, and then the Americans, which I take pride of,\nMarch 1, 2010\nthe-they really treated those people. They gave them their own food and clothes,\nand they were well taken care of. And s-so it \u2014 after that \u2014",
        "Q: So, as soldiers, you were swapping these stories that you were seeing, you \u2014 that\nyou were experience \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, well, you know, after [indecipherable] relates this one lady that they \u2014\nthat they had come across. And eventually, see, we have a reunion every year. And\none year, they \u2014 they brought her over. She always wanted to meet the \u2014 the soldiers\nthat liberated her. And she came over with her daughter. And \u2014 and she brought\nwith her, she had a quilt \u2014 not a quilt, it was a \u2014 a blanket. And in \u2014 while in the cell,\nwhat she did, knitting, she knitted her family tree on the quilt. And she brought that\nwith her, and it was old, and oh, but you could tell where she had spent hours just\ndoing it.",
        "Q: Doing it, yeah.",
        "A: But the thing that amazed me, they were scared to come out. They were scared to\ncome out.",
        "Q: So do you remember the first time you had contact with German civilians? Was\nit memorable, or not really [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, see, the only ones that you really hit, 1s that you\u2019re going along, and\nthe people on the street, they were \u2014 course, they had the American, and you know,\nMarch 1, 2010\nyou would wave, and maybe talk to them. One night I had an experience, I got lost\nwith my squad, and I didn\u2019t know which way to go, and there was a\u2014 a German. So\nI started to talk to him, and he spoke perfect English. So I \u2014 I was trying to get to\nma \u2014 back to my line, so he was telling me where to go. And of course, I was\nhesitant, because you know, you never know.",
        "Q: Who is he, yeah.",
        "A: But I asked him, I said, how come you speak such good English? So he said, I\nlived in Baltimore for 30 years. And he says that then he went back to his\nhometown and the war broke out. But he led us back to my lines, and he spoke\nperfect English.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: He really did. But those are the only ones that you really meet. I\u2014I sh \u2014I\nhesitate, because a lot of times I\u2019ve met people afterwards, and not \u2014 not during the\nwar.",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019m interested in figuring, and getting a picture of, you know, what your \u2014\nwhat your experience is as you\u2019re going along. You know, you\u2019re in France, then\nyou cross the Rhine at \u2014 at Easter time, the towns change from poorly dressed\npeople to very well dressed people.",
        "A: Yeah.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: You know, you find some prisoners of war. And e \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, is April\nin March or in \u2014 was Easter in a \u2014 in March or in April that year?",
        "A: I think it must have been March \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 or probably \u2014 maybe the first of April.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And so it \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s when General Patton, you know, made his \u2014 he urinated in \u2014 1n the\nRhine. That was his \u2014",
        "Q: His symbol.",
        "A: Yeah, symbol of success. But after that 1t was \u2014 the war was \u2014 you could tell it\nwas coming to an end. But then you would hit pockets, there was stiff resistance, so\nyou couldn\u2019t relax, and y-you just had to be alert and watch, and \u2014",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t lose that many men this time, after \u2014",
        "A: No, no, that I didn\u2019t. The \u2014 the second time, the only ones we lost were minor.\nMost of my [indecipherable] was frostbite from \u2014 from the snow and all. And that\n\u2014 that was a miserable life, that \u2014 that was.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re sleeping in the fields, or your \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: Oh yeah. Had no place to sleep, and \u2014 and I tell you, I don\u2019t mean to embarrass\nyou, but I tell you the worst part was going to the bathroom in the morning. I tell\nyou, you pull up your pants and snow all in them.",
        "Q: It\u2019s \u2014 yeah, I mean it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I\u2014I don\u2019t want to imagine it, but where \u2014 what \u2014 what 1s a soldier\u2019s life? It\u2019s no\nfun.",
        "A: No, it isn\u2019t. You actually become an animal.",
        "Q: You felt that way [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah, you live like an animal. You learn things that a civilian, an American\ncivilian wouldn\u2019t recognize, but \u2014 you know where to take cover, get under bushes.\nA-And you live \u2014 you live like an animal. You just pray from one spot to the other,\nand it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a rough life. And not only worrying about dying, which I never\ndid. My only fear was losing my legs, I never wanted to lose my legs. Death would\nhave been \u2014",
        "Q: Preferable?",
        "A: As many people in these camps, death would have been a blessing.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A real blessing. And I haven\u2019t gotten to Dachau, I'll save that for last \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 but \u2014 but at that time, there was no resistance, occasionally, and then we\nalways had good billets. If you were reserve, they got you good housing, or decent\nhousing, and \u2014 which was real nice.",
        "Q: Did you have \u2014 was there any news, or any thought at that point that something\nspecial had happened to the Jews? Was there any kind of \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Nothing at all. The only thing that I knew, see, I was going to high school, and\nwe used to get a paper, and he would have, you know, how many planes Germany\nwas building every month, and this and the other.",
        "Q: When you were still in Washington, you mean?",
        "A: Yeah, still a civilian.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: You know, I was in high school. And I \u2014 and that\u2019s the only thing that I knew,\nand then the \u2014 they read you through the different religious [indecipherable] they\nwould say that they\u2019re torturing the Jews, or doing this. But it \u2014 1t \u2014 that was remote.\nYou know, you were a 17 year old kid going to high school, and you did it for\ncurrent events, you know, as an assignment.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And \u2014 and you re \u2014 you didn\u2019t have the feeling of it, as you did just reading it.\nAnd that made a difference, and a lot of them, they go \u2014 they got educated very\nquickly.",
        "Q: So tell me, when you were \u2014 you crossed the Rhine, and wa \u2014 and it was April,\nyeah?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It was April. And so there\u2019s \u2014 from the Rhine to Munich, it was \u2014 it took a\nmonth \u2014 took three weeks to get there?",
        "A: Took, you know, about a month, because we were in \u2014 Dachau was taken the\n29\" of ja \u2014 April.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, maybe it was in the latter part of March.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m -\u2014 you know, I\u2019m \u2014 I always hate to give these interviews, because see, I was\nan infantry person. I-In our place, we never knew where we were, we never knew\nnothing, and it \u2014 the G.Ls always used to say, you know, someday we\u2019ll have to\ncome back and see where we\u2019ve been. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what it was. And in \u2014 in\ntime \u2014 you never knew whether it was Saturday, or Sunday, or \u2014 or if \u2014 1-1-1t was\nMarch 1, 2010\njust one day after the other. But in Germany, wi \u2014 I was in anti-tank, which are less\nburdened, because we didn\u2019t have too many trouble with tanks, like we did in\nFrance and during the Battle of the Bulge. I mean, the Germans would come at you\nwith eight, 10 tanks, so we were really busy. But when we started to move, and then\nthe battle fatigue for me, was to stay in one place. Because the longer you stayed\nthere, you would lose one man today, and another one tomorrow. And finally after a\nweek you\u2019d \u2014 you know, you would get jittery. But as long as you moving, and you\ngoing into new territory, and you just didn\u2019t have that fear that you had.",
        "Q: And were you stalled a lot? I mean, between the Rhine and Munich, did you \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, it was a steady, steady movement. Steady movement.",
        "Q: Steady movement, steady movement.",
        "A: I\u2014I had gotten a \u2014 an ear infection, and I tried to get the medics. [phone\nringing]",
        "Q: Excuse me.",
        "A: Tried to get to the medics and you couldn\u2019t find a medic, everybody was moving\nso fast.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: It \u20141t took me three days. By that time my ear was, you know, it was \u2014 it\u2019s worse\nthan an earache, cause I was in some shelling, which \u2014 well, that\u2019s another story.\nBut \u2014 but that\u2019s what it was, we were just moving along. And \u2014",
        "Q: But the shelling, nevertheless, happened during this moving along?",
        "A: Well, ye \u2014 well, yeah.",
        "Q: What was \u2014 tell me about that a little bit.",
        "A: Well, the shelling was that the Germans used to use the p \u2014 the Polish men, they\nwere set up the \u2014 the line of resistance behind the German soldiers. So when the\nGerman soldiers would retreat, those guys were already set in with guns, and that\u2019s\nthe only thing they had. So they would fire.",
        "Q: On the Germans?",
        "A: No, they would fire on us. These were \u2014",
        "Q: The Polish?",
        "A: Well, they were Polish, or at least they claimed to be Polish.",
        "Q: Because the Polish we-were enslaved by the Germans.",
        "A: I know tt.",
        "Q: So, I would be \u2014 you know, why would a German give a Pole a gun? He would \u2014",
        "A: They \u2014 na \u2014 no, no, they were firing the artillery, and whether they were actually\nfiring them, I don\u2019t know, but they would dig them in \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 and they would get the ammunition ready, and they \u2014 they were doing it. And\nthen, at that time, the Russian \u2014 the Germans, yo \u2014 I mean, they were desperate, you\nknow, I mean, they took \u2014 just like with me with that German person I asked to lead\nme the way. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know whether he was leading me right or wrong, but I was\ndesperate.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Thad to take a chance. So I was \u2014 I did it right. And I had nine men with me,\nwhich \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite some repos \u2014 responsibility.",
        "A: It really is, it really is. Cause some of them were \u2014 they were younger than I was.\nSome of them \u2014 yo-you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s disgraceful, but when I was in the hospital\njust for a day or two, there was a fellow there, he was 18 years old, he\u2019d been in the\narmy, I figured it was less than a year, and he lost a leg. Hadn\u2019t been in the army.\nSo \u2014 but that\u2019s it \u2014 but we went from one town to the other. If I knew you were\ngonna ask me that, I \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: I have sa \u2014 detailed map, it really shows where \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: Oh, that would \u2014 that would be interesting to have in the future. You know, that\nwe could have in addition to your interview, that we\u2019d have the map that shows the\nde \u2014 you know, the route.",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] Schweinfurt.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then, of course, Munich was \u2014",
        "Q: What would \u2014 was \u2014 was that \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable|",
        "Q: \u2014 was that \u2014 I mean, Munich\u2019s a huge city, so how \u2014 was it bombed, was it \u2014",
        "A: Bombed, it was \u2014 it was di \u2014 it was square blocks of rubbish. And my first \u2014 I\nhad two impressions when I got into Munich. One was, I couldn\u2019t understand how\none man would allow his citizens to go through the hell that they went through. And\nsome of those civilians really had a hard, hard life. You know, I\u2019ve had mothers tell\nme that, you know, they put the babies to bed, get them settled down, the air raid\nsiren goes on, grab the kids, take them to the shelter, get them settled. All clear\ncame out, take them back home. And that\u2019s only once, but when you do that every\nnight for months, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s very, very hard. So those \u2014 th-the civilians, even\nthough they were Germans, I always respected the Germans, and I always respected\nthe Wehrmachts. And some G.Ls weren\u2019t as liberal as I was, but I know when the\nMarch 1, 2010\nwar was over \u2014 where was I? I think it was in Munich. There, they were marching\nGerman prisoners on the street somewhere. And of course the German civilians all\nclapped, you know. And so the G.I. next to me said, what are they clapping for?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Said, well, that\u2019s their men, that\u2019s their citizens, they\u2019re Germans like them, and\nyou know, there\u2019s a certain honor between them. You know, I would do the same\nthing. But I never had any malice toward anybody. Except, I think if I would have\never captured Hitler, man, I would have \u2014",
        "Q: Yep.",
        "A: And believe it or not, I really, really hoped for that.",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: I really did. You know, and it was a far fetch, I mean, you know, it\u2019s like the\nGermans capturing Eisenhower. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a dream.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t let that happen. He made sure that he wa \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, he wa \u2014 he did the right thing, believe me, cause he would have ended up",
        "Q: Oh yeah. He knew what was coming.",
        "A: Yeah.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: So tell me, when you were in Munich and you\u2019re on your way to Dachau \u2014\nhang on a second. [tape break]",
        "A: Oh, actually, it\u2019s reversed \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, first \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] Dachau",
        "Q: \u2014 Dachau first, before Munich?",
        "A: We went \u2014 yeah \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Dachau first. And \u2014 and Dachau was a two division, 45\" and 42\", and\nincidentally, there\u2019s a bitter bitterness between the two.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 one trying to claim who was first, who was \u2014 so it\u2019s \u2014 til this day\nivsa\u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s a controversy.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Which makes no difference.",
        "Q: Okay. Can you hold on just a second please? Okay, tell me what you saw. You \u2014\nwhen you go to Dachau, tell me what you were supposed to do, and what you saw,\nMarch 1, 2010\nand what surprised you?",
        "A: Well, I came in from probably the south side, and I actually went though the\ngates, because the troops had been in front of us. But our first encounter, of course,\nwas the railroad cars. And we came down there, and that was a shock.",
        "Q: What\u2019d you see?",
        "A: Corpse. One just loaded, one car after the other, after the other, 50 cars, I think\nthere were.",
        "Q: 50 cars?",
        "A: Of \u2014 of just \u2014",
        "Q: Corpses.",
        "A: \u2014 corpses. And the sad things that you run into is they were coming down and\nthere was \u2014 some lady had \u2014 who was on a train, had gotten off with her baby, and\nshe no sooner got off the car than she collapsed, I guess, cause what we saw is they\nwere dead. And she died, and the baby outlived the mother. And you could tell that\nshe was grabbing her mother\u2019s breast, pulling her clothes away to \u2014 for something\nto eat. And then you see two of them dead, just sitting there, mother and whatever,\nthey were. But the thing is, to think that they had to suffer, that\u2019s the part that \u2014 that\nis \u2014 that\u2019s unbelievable. And those cars that they rode in, see, I rode in those cars\nunder ideal conditions, and it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: It was not ideal conditions.",
        "A: It was not, oh no, not there.",
        "Q: Did you know who those people were, the corpses, did you know who they were\nby that point?",
        "A: Oh, there was no way you could have told one from the other.",
        "Q: No, no, no, I mean by \u2014 did you know if they were Jews, did you know if they\nwere Poles? Did you know why \u2014 you know, did you know who they were a-at that\npoint, when you came upon them?",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t.",
        "A: But the assumption would be that they\u2019re Jews. I think the final calculations in\ntheir books, they\u2019 ll tell you how many Jews were involved.",
        "Q: But when you were going through there, and you\u2019re seeing this, you had no idea\nwho these corpses were?",
        "A: Just dead corpses.",
        "Q: Just dead corpses. And then when you got into Dachau, was there anybody\nliving?",
        "A: Oh yeah, there were the \u2014 they \u2014 they had there \u2014 some of \u2014 some of the people\nwere dead, living dead. I don\u2019t know if you ever seen a doctor when he tries to\nMarch 1, 2010\nverify if somebody died, they pull the eyelids back to look in his eyes. Cause you\ncan look in the eye and you can tell whether he\u2019s living [indecipherable]. And\nthat\u2019s the way these people were, they just had a dead eye. They looked straight\nahead, and they\u2019re nothing but skin and bones. And after we left Dachau, they were\nlosing 200 a day. After we got there.",
        "Q: What you \u2014 did you talk to any of them?",
        "A: No. They were filthy and dirty. Some of the people come up and they would try\nto hug you, and I push away. And one thing that really bothers me, some lady, she\nmust have had a bottle of wine, and she wanted to gi-give it, part of 1t to me. And\nshe\u2019s starving, you know, and she wanted to give me part of it. And I-I[\u2014I ca\u2014I\nmean, I couldn\u2019t drink out of it. I mean, it was just the filth, the smell, I mean, y-you\njust couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: No way. And some of them, I guess they fa \u2014 you know, they tried to hug you,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And you \u2014 you just had to push them away, push them away.",
        "Q: Did \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: But what I did, after we walked, this was the other part of our division, they had\nto secure the re \u2014 the camp. There were some prisoners who were in good shape \u2014\nnot good shape, but they were better shape.",
        "Q: Better shape.",
        "A: Course, the \u2014 all they wanted to do was get out. And they had to contain them,\nwhich wasn\u2019t an easy job to do.",
        "Q: Why would they had to be contained?",
        "A: Because they were all diseased, there was a lot of disease in the camp. They\ndidn\u2019t want the prisoners running around in the streets of Munich, in \u2014 in a diseased\nState.",
        "Q: And I can imagine that the prisoners couldn\u2019t understand, now if you\u2019re liberated\nus, how come you don\u2019t let us go?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. But \u2014 but what they did, th-they [indecipherable] they came in\nwith blankets, they came in with food, and \u2014 and they took care of them. And they\nweren\u2019t there that long. They weren't there that long. I got a \u2014",
        "Q: Were there any guards that were there?",
        "A: Oh yeah \u2014",
        "Q: Were there any Germans that you found?",
        "A: \u2014 oh yeah, yeah, they \u2014 well, I didn\u2019t \u2014 our division didn\u2019t hit them.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The 45\" division, they hit the barracks. And they killed \u2014 they killed \u2014 I think\nthere was 35 SSs, they never lived to tell the tale. And they had electric fence\naround the camp, that wasn\u2019t turned on, which made it easier for their \u2014 the troops\nin front of us. And then, the pride I take getting \u2014 walking down by those railroad\ntracks, the G.I.s in front of me, they heard a moan. And they climbed up, and they\nliterally had to walk on corpses, I mean it. They finally get to this one fellow, and\nthey pulled him out and he was still alive. And imagine just being in with a bunch\nof dead people, you know? And \u2014 but they got him on a Jeep, I saw that, and they\ntook him away, I guess they took him to the medics. And the joy part of\n[indecipherable] is that in \u201995, which is 50\" anniversary of the liberation, I went to\nit in \u2014 in \u2014 in Munich, this fellow that they pulled out came to that reunion.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: And I tell you, he was a hero. I think everybody \u2014",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: \u2014 and he \u2014 he had become a very wealthy person, doing \u2014 I don\u2019t know what he\ndid, but he got involved in some business or something. But he was living, and you\nwould never know that he came out of a \u2014",
        "Q: Pile of corpses.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: A pile of corpses.",

        "Q: What did you \u2014 what did you think, or do you remember what you thought when\nyou were walking through here, because I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, you weren\u2019t expecting\nto see this, right? You weren\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, you \u2014 we didn\u2019t expect to find a \u2014 a \u2014 th-the magnitude that it was. It was\njust \u2014 there was just corpse everywhere. And the thing I remember is that lady with\nthe baby in her arms. I\u2019Il never forget that. And the other ones in the crematories, I\nwent in there, and the soil had so much blood 1n it, that 1-1t had a purple brownish\ncolor. It just didn\u2019t look like dirt, but just from the saturation of the \u2014 of the blood.",
        "Q: Of the blood.",
        "A: It\u2019s just that, and the other one that I always remembered was the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014\nthe inmates had a \u2014 to wash up, if you want to call it that, it\u2019s like an umbrella\nopened up, and at the top, the water would come from the top, and come down and\nMarch 1, 2010\nthen it would all wash. But the dirt, the stench, the \u2014 ye \u2014 I-I mean, how could you\ngo there and clean up? I mean, it was so filthy, you know, just oh.",
        "Q: About how many people, do you know, were in the camp when \u2014 when you \u2014",
        "A: Close to 30,000.",
        "Q: When you guys walked into it, there still were about 30,000 people in there?",

        "A: That was the first battle, the first. So after that, a-after January, after my\nbirthday, we had lost so many men, they took us back and we organized this, and\nrefilled the ranks.",
        "A: I-It was in France, close to Nancy, France, and we \u2014 we were there about three\nweeks before they got all the men back together. And so we stayed there until\nMarch 1, 2010\nMarch, the first of March, and then that\u2019s when we tried \u2014 had the offensive, that we\nwent through the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, well, that was really \u2014 the resistance wa-wasn\u2019t too heavy. But it was buth\n\u2014 y-you\u2019d hit \u2014 certain times when you would hit little resistance and then you\nwould go in reserve, and then the next day you might move 20 miles with nothing,\nno resistance.",
        "A: Th-Th \u2014 no, no, we had \u2014 still in France, and we didn\u2019t cross the Rhine, and I\nremember it was Easter Sunday.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was south Germany. And then, and from that point on, it was just \u2014\nwe went through \u2014 we took v-various th \u2014 Daun, we took Schweinfurt, we took \u2014\nwe \u2014 we took th \u2014 three or four \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 cities.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, they were surrendering, and the story that I always tell, we were in\nreserve, and I \u2014 they used to give us a chocolate bar to eat. And I was eating that,\nand I had a tap on my shoulder and I turned around. And it was a German soldier,\nand he had a white flag.",
        "A: Well, I guess maybe he did, but that he had a circular from Eisenhower\nencouraging the Germans to surrender, and that they would be well taken care of,\nand so forth. So, he was all alone, and I didn't know what to do with him. And\nluckily, there were other Germans coming from the front, quite a few of them, so I\njust told him to fall in with the rest of them, and that was the last time I saw him.",
        "A: Ah, ah, n\u2014 he \u2014 he wasn\u2019t young, but he wasn\u2019t old. You \u2014 I \u2014 he must have\nbeen 30 or 40. I tell you, their faces were dirty, they were beard. Y-You know, it\nwas really to distinguish the age. And in those days, you know, e-every time we got\na German prisoner, they always say, you know, nicht schiessen, you know, Polack,\nPolack, you know. Don\u2019t shoot me, boy.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: \u2019ma Pole. And that\u2019s what they would do.",
        "A: But \u2014",
        "A: Oh, a-as you go through the town.",
        "A: Yes. First of all, you could tell the \u2014 being a German, the civilians were well\nclothed. The French had nothing. Clothes, you could tell the difference, I don\u2019t\nknow about soap and things like that, but once you hit Germany, there was a\ndifferent class of people, and that they had a better part of the life. And some of the\nstories that the Frenchmen tell, it\u2019s a \u2014 you know, it\u2019s disgraceful.",
        "A: Oh, well I got \u2014I got it in here, the \u2014 a story that \u2014 actually, this was 1n \u2014 in\nFrance, a lady that \u2014 they were in nor \u2014 Norway, and it was a fishing town, and\nthey were sending messages to \u2014 to Russia, and Russia would send them to\nEngland, and the Germans caught them. And there were seven of them. So they\ntook the men out and they want them to dig their own graves. So one of them was\nMarch 1, 2010\nslow doing it, and when the officer, the German officer was pushing him along, he\nsays, I\u2019m in no hurry, I sh \u2014 he says, I know what I\u2019m digging. So the German got\nmad and spit on him. And this \u2014 and the fisherman, with his spade, turned around\nand hit him with such force, that he actually decapitated him.",
        "A: And of course, when he did that, that was the end of it, and the other Germans\nhad killed the rest of them. And in retaliation, they took the wives, seven wives, and\nthey took them to \u2014 to Germany and this one lady that she had a eight months old\nbaby girl, and when she got on the boat, they took the baby from her, and the put it\non a crib, in a box on the deck of the ship. And when she came out the next morning\nthe baby was gone. And of course they assumed that \u2014 that they just threw her\noverboard. And she ended up as a \u2014 working fine wires for the German in some\nfactory. And when they were \u2014 when she was liberated \u2014 I wasn\u2019t there,\nincidentally, this was told to me by, you know, another company, that those women\nwere all in cells. They would open the cells, and they wouldn\u2019t come out. And they\nwould tell them, you know, you\u2019re free, you\u2019re free. But they were just scared. They\ndidn\u2019t know \u2014 1-1-1-it makes you cry, it really does. The people were just scared,\nthey lived from day to day. They never knew when they were going to be the last\nday. They finally coaxed them out, and then the Americans, which I take pride of,\nMarch 1, 2010\nthe-they really treated those people. They gave them their own food and clothes,\nand they were well taken care of. And s-so it \u2014 after that \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, well, you know, after [indecipherable] relates this one lady that they \u2014\nthat they had come across. And eventually, see, we have a reunion every year. And\none year, they \u2014 they brought her over. She always wanted to meet the \u2014 the soldiers\nthat liberated her. And she came over with her daughter. And \u2014 and she brought\nwith her, she had a quilt \u2014 not a quilt, it was a \u2014 a blanket. And in \u2014 while in the cell,\nwhat she did, knitting, she knitted her family tree on the quilt. And she brought that\nwith her, and it was old, and oh, but you could tell where she had spent hours just\ndoing it.",
        "A: But the thing that amazed me, they were scared to come out. They were scared to\ncome out.",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, see, the only ones that you really hit, 1s that you\u2019re going along, and\nthe people on the street, they were \u2014 course, they had the American, and you know,\nMarch 1, 2010\nyou would wave, and maybe talk to them. One night I had an experience, I got lost\nwith my squad, and I didn\u2019t know which way to go, and there was a\u2014 a German. So\nI started to talk to him, and he spoke perfect English. So I \u2014 I was trying to get to\nma \u2014 back to my line, so he was telling me where to go. And of course, I was\nhesitant, because you know, you never know.",
        "A: But I asked him, I said, how come you speak such good English? So he said, I\nlived in Baltimore for 30 years. And he says that then he went back to his\nhometown and the war broke out. But he led us back to my lines, and he spoke\nperfect English.",
        "A: He really did. But those are the only ones that you really meet. I\u2014I sh \u2014I\nhesitate, because a lot of times I\u2019ve met people afterwards, and not \u2014 not during the\nwar.",
        "A: Yeah.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: I think it must have been March \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or probably \u2014 maybe the first of April.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s when General Patton, you know, made his \u2014 he urinated in \u2014 1n the\nRhine. That was his \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, symbol of success. But after that 1t was \u2014 the war was \u2014 you could tell it\nwas coming to an end. But then you would hit pockets, there was stiff resistance, so\nyou couldn\u2019t relax, and y-you just had to be alert and watch, and \u2014",
        "A: No, no, that I didn\u2019t. The \u2014 the second time, the only ones we lost were minor.\nMost of my [indecipherable] was frostbite from \u2014 from the snow and all. And that\n\u2014 that was a miserable life, that \u2014 that was.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: Oh yeah. Had no place to sleep, and \u2014 and I tell you, I don\u2019t mean to embarrass\nyou, but I tell you the worst part was going to the bathroom in the morning. I tell\nyou, you pull up your pants and snow all in them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, it isn\u2019t. You actually become an animal.",
        "A: Oh yeah, you live like an animal. You learn things that a civilian, an American\ncivilian wouldn\u2019t recognize, but \u2014 you know where to take cover, get under bushes.\nA-And you live \u2014 you live like an animal. You just pray from one spot to the other,\nand it\u2019s a\u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a rough life. And not only worrying about dying, which I never\ndid. My only fear was losing my legs, I never wanted to lose my legs. Death would\nhave been \u2014",
        "A: As many people in these camps, death would have been a blessing.",
        "A: A real blessing. And I haven\u2019t gotten to Dachau, I'll save that for last \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 but \u2014 but at that time, there was no resistance, occasionally, and then we\nalways had good billets. If you were reserve, they got you good housing, or decent\nhousing, and \u2014 which was real nice.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Nothing at all. The only thing that I knew, see, I was going to high school, and\nwe used to get a paper, and he would have, you know, how many planes Germany\nwas building every month, and this and the other.",
        "A: Yeah, still a civilian.",
        "A: You know, I was in high school. And I \u2014 and that\u2019s the only thing that I knew,\nand then the \u2014 they read you through the different religious [indecipherable] they\nwould say that they\u2019re torturing the Jews, or doing this. But it \u2014 1t \u2014 that was remote.\nYou know, you were a 17 year old kid going to high school, and you did it for\ncurrent events, you know, as an assignment.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: And \u2014 and you re \u2014 you didn\u2019t have the feeling of it, as you did just reading it.\nAnd that made a difference, and a lot of them, they go \u2014 they got educated very\nquickly.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Took, you know, about a month, because we were in \u2014 Dachau was taken the\n29\" of ja \u2014 April.",
        "A: So, maybe it was in the latter part of March.",
        "A: I\u2019m -\u2014 you know, I\u2019m \u2014 I always hate to give these interviews, because see, I was\nan infantry person. I-In our place, we never knew where we were, we never knew\nnothing, and it \u2014 the G.Ls always used to say, you know, someday we\u2019ll have to\ncome back and see where we\u2019ve been. And that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s what it was. And in \u2014 in\ntime \u2014 you never knew whether it was Saturday, or Sunday, or \u2014 or if \u2014 1-1-1t was\nMarch 1, 2010\njust one day after the other. But in Germany, wi \u2014 I was in anti-tank, which are less\nburdened, because we didn\u2019t have too many trouble with tanks, like we did in\nFrance and during the Battle of the Bulge. I mean, the Germans would come at you\nwith eight, 10 tanks, so we were really busy. But when we started to move, and then\nthe battle fatigue for me, was to stay in one place. Because the longer you stayed\nthere, you would lose one man today, and another one tomorrow. And finally after a\nweek you\u2019d \u2014 you know, you would get jittery. But as long as you moving, and you\ngoing into new territory, and you just didn\u2019t have that fear that you had.",
        "A: Oh no, it was a steady, steady movement. Steady movement.",
        "A: I\u2014I had gotten a \u2014 an ear infection, and I tried to get the medics. [phone\nringing]",
        "A: Tried to get to the medics and you couldn\u2019t find a medic, everybody was moving\nso fast.",
        "A: It \u20141t took me three days. By that time my ear was, you know, it was \u2014 it\u2019s worse\nthan an earache, cause I was in some shelling, which \u2014 well, that\u2019s another story.\nBut \u2014 but that\u2019s what it was, we were just moving along. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, ye \u2014 well, yeah.",
        "A: Well, the shelling was that the Germans used to use the p \u2014 the Polish men, they\nwere set up the \u2014 the line of resistance behind the German soldiers. So when the\nGerman soldiers would retreat, those guys were already set in with guns, and that\u2019s\nthe only thing they had. So they would fire.",
        "A: No, they would fire on us. These were \u2014",
        "A: Well, they were Polish, or at least they claimed to be Polish.",
        "A: I know tt.",
        "A: They \u2014 na \u2014 no, no, they were firing the artillery, and whether they were actually\nfiring them, I don\u2019t know, but they would dig them in \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: \u2014 and they would get the ammunition ready, and they \u2014 they were doing it. And\nthen, at that time, the Russian \u2014 the Germans, yo \u2014 I mean, they were desperate, you\nknow, I mean, they took \u2014 just like with me with that German person I asked to lead\nme the way. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know whether he was leading me right or wrong, but I was\ndesperate.",
        "A: Thad to take a chance. So I was \u2014 I did it right. And I had nine men with me,\nwhich \u2014",
        "A: It really is, it really is. Cause some of them were \u2014 they were younger than I was.\nSome of them \u2014 yo-you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s disgraceful, but when I was in the hospital\njust for a day or two, there was a fellow there, he was 18 years old, he\u2019d been in the\narmy, I figured it was less than a year, and he lost a leg. Hadn\u2019t been in the army.\nSo \u2014 but that\u2019s it \u2014 but we went from one town to the other. If I knew you were\ngonna ask me that, I \u2014",
        "A: I have sa \u2014 detailed map, it really shows where \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] Schweinfurt.",
        "A: And then, of course, Munich was \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable|",
        "A: Bombed, it was \u2014 it was di \u2014 it was square blocks of rubbish. And my first \u2014 I\nhad two impressions when I got into Munich. One was, I couldn\u2019t understand how\none man would allow his citizens to go through the hell that they went through. And\nsome of those civilians really had a hard, hard life. You know, I\u2019ve had mothers tell\nme that, you know, they put the babies to bed, get them settled down, the air raid\nsiren goes on, grab the kids, take them to the shelter, get them settled. All clear\ncame out, take them back home. And that\u2019s only once, but when you do that every\nnight for months, it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s very, very hard. So those \u2014 th-the civilians, even\nthough they were Germans, I always respected the Germans, and I always respected\nthe Wehrmachts. And some G.Ls weren\u2019t as liberal as I was, but I know when the\nMarch 1, 2010\nwar was over \u2014 where was I? I think it was in Munich. There, they were marching\nGerman prisoners on the street somewhere. And of course the German civilians all\nclapped, you know. And so the G.I. next to me said, what are they clapping for?",
        "A: Said, well, that\u2019s their men, that\u2019s their citizens, they\u2019re Germans like them, and\nyou know, there\u2019s a certain honor between them. You know, I would do the same\nthing. But I never had any malice toward anybody. Except, I think if I would have\never captured Hitler, man, I would have \u2014",
        "A: And believe it or not, I really, really hoped for that.",
        "A: I really did. You know, and it was a far fetch, I mean, you know, it\u2019s like the\nGermans capturing Eisenhower. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a dream.",
        "A: Yeah, he wa \u2014 he did the right thing, believe me, cause he would have ended up",
        "A: Yeah.\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: Oh, actually, it\u2019s reversed \u2014",
        "A: [indecipherable] Dachau",
        "A: We went \u2014 yeah \u2014",
        "A: Dachau first. And \u2014 and Dachau was a two division, 45\" and 42\", and\nincidentally, there\u2019s a bitter bitterness between the two.",
        "A: Yeah, they \u2014 one trying to claim who was first, who was \u2014 so it\u2019s \u2014 til this day\nivsa\u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Which makes no difference.\nMarch 1, 2010\nand what surprised you?",
        "A: Well, I came in from probably the south side, and I actually went though the\ngates, because the troops had been in front of us. But our first encounter, of course,\nwas the railroad cars. And we came down there, and that was a shock.",
        "A: Corpse. One just loaded, one car after the other, after the other, 50 cars, I think\nthere were.",
        "A: Of \u2014 of just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 corpses. And the sad things that you run into is they were coming down and\nthere was \u2014 some lady had \u2014 who was on a train, had gotten off with her baby, and\nshe no sooner got off the car than she collapsed, I guess, cause what we saw is they\nwere dead. And she died, and the baby outlived the mother. And you could tell that\nshe was grabbing her mother\u2019s breast, pulling her clothes away to \u2014 for something\nto eat. And then you see two of them dead, just sitting there, mother and whatever,\nthey were. But the thing is, to think that they had to suffer, that\u2019s the part that \u2014 that\nis \u2014 that\u2019s unbelievable. And those cars that they rode in, see, I rode in those cars\nunder ideal conditions, and it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014\nMarch 1, 2010",
        "A: It was not, oh no, not there.",
        "A: Oh, there was no way you could have told one from the other.",
        "A: No, no, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: But the assumption would be that they\u2019re Jews. I think the final calculations in\ntheir books, they\u2019 ll tell you how many Jews were involved.",
        "A: Just dead corpses.",
        "A: Oh yeah, there were the \u2014 they \u2014 they had there \u2014 some of \u2014 some of the people\nwere dead, living dead. I don\u2019t know if you ever seen a doctor when he tries to\nMarch 1, 2010\nverify if somebody died, they pull the eyelids back to look in his eyes. Cause you\ncan look in the eye and you can tell whether he\u2019s living [indecipherable]. And\nthat\u2019s the way these people were, they just had a dead eye. They looked straight\nahead, and they\u2019re nothing but skin and bones. And after we left Dachau, they were\nlosing 200 a day. After we got there.",
        "A: No. They were filthy and dirty. Some of the people come up and they would try\nto hug you, and I push away. And one thing that really bothers me, some lady, she\nmust have had a bottle of wine, and she wanted to gi-give it, part of 1t to me. And\nshe\u2019s starving, you know, and she wanted to give me part of it. And I-I[\u2014I ca\u2014I\nmean, I couldn\u2019t drink out of it.

        "A: Course, the \u2014 all they wanted to do was get out. And they had to contain them,\nwhich wasn\u2019t an easy job to do.",
        "A: Because they were all diseased, there was a lot of disease in the camp. They\ndidn\u2019t want the prisoners running around in the streets of Munich, in \u2014 in a diseased\nState.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah. But \u2014 but what they did, th-they [indecipherable] they came in\nwith blankets, they came in with food, and \u2014 and they took care of them. And they\nweren\u2019t there that long. They weren't there that long. I got a \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah \u2014",

        "A: The 45\" division, they hit the barracks. And they killed \u2014 they killed \u2014 I think\nthere was 35 SSs, they never lived to tell the tale. And they had electric fence\naround the camp, that wasn\u2019t turned on, which made it easier for their \u2014 the troops\nin front of us. And then, the pride I take getting \u2014 walking down by those railroad\ntracks, the G.I.s in front of me, they heard a moan. And they climbed up, and they\nliterally had to walk on corpses, I mean it. They finally get to this one fellow, and\nthey pulled him out and he was still alive. And imagine just being in with a bunch\nof dead people, you know? And \u2014 but they got him on a Jeep, I saw that, and they\ntook him away, I guess they took him to the medics. And the joy part of\n[indecipherable] is that in \u201995, which is 50\" anniversary of the liberation, I went to\nit in \u2014 in \u2014 in Munich, this fellow that they pulled out came to that reunion.",
