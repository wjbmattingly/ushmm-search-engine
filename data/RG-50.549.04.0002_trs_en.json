        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr\ncollection. This is an interview with Dustin Dezube, conducted by Regina Baier,\non December 7\u201c, 2000, in Mr. Dezube\u2019s home in Boston. Mr. Dezube is the\ngrandson of Holocaust survivors Amalie and Norman Salsitz, and the son of Mrs.\nEsther Dezube, their daughter, all of whom have been interviewed for the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s oral history collection. This interview is\nMemorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this\ninterview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Okay. The first question is an\neasy one, what is your full name?",
        "Answer: My full name is Dustin Isaac Dezube.",
        "Q: And when were your born, and where?",
        "A: I was born at Brigham Women\u2019s Hospital in 1983, March 11\".",
        "Q: Were you named after somebody in particular, and if so, what do you know\nabout that person? Tell me a little bit about --",
        "A: The D in Dustin comes from my great-grandfather David on my\ngrandmother\u2019s side -- on my mom\u2019s, of course. And they didn\u2019t want to name me\nDavid, but they took the D and went with a name that started with a D. My middle\nDecember 7, 2000\nname, Isaac, I believe comes also -- comes after my grandfather\u2019s father. My last\nname is artificial, it was made up upon coming to America. And that\u2019s my name.",
        "Q: Do you -- do you relate to the people you were name -- named after in some\nway? Does it have special meaning for you?",
        "A: I\u2019ve seen pictures of them, but the fact that my name, it\u2019s not a very strong\nconnection.",
        "Q: You do have a Hebrew name, too.",
        "A: I do, Davide, and that also -- that was translated. There was no connection.",
        "Q: Okay, give me a little sen -- give me a sense of how you see your grandparents.\nWhat -- what -- wh-when you would -- okay, try to describe your grandfather a\nlittle bit. How do you see him, or how you saw him, if that -- maybe that has\nchanged, even.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: When you sort of look back at who you as a -- as a smaller boy, how did you\nrelate to both of them? Give me a picture of who she is, or was, and how you saw\nhim.",
        "A: This is, of course, on my mother\u2019s side, and they are both great people, but\nquite different. My grandfather, he\u2019s a storyteller, he\u2019s tenacious, in a good way.\nHe\u2019s funny, he\u2019s loving. He\u2019s done so much with his life. I\u2019m really proud of him,\nDecember 7, 2000\nand there\u2019s a lot of aspects of him which I'd like to emulate in myself when I grow\nolder. Not all, but a lot.",
        "Q: Like what?",
        "A: I admire his determination. His ability to stick to principles. I admire how he\nmade himself up from an immigrant to what he is now. I admire his courage and\nstrength that he exhibited during the war. And my grandmother, she\u2019s very loving,\nshe\u2019s very emotional, whereas my grandfather is not as emotional. The one thing I\ndo remember him getting very upset about was I dated, briefly, a girl that wasn\u2019t\nJewish and that deeply upset him. But that\u2019s over.",
        "Q: Did you understand why that upset him?",
        "A: I did, I -- I -- I certainly understood where he was coming from. At the time I\nwas young and I had no -- no intentions of having a serious lo -- relationship with\na non-Jewish girl. That was never -- it didn\u2019t cross my mind. I -- I do -- I do factor\nthat in when I look at girls. But my grandmother, getting back to her, she\u2019s -- well\nactually, I actually call him Sabba, which is grandfather in Hebrew, and I call her\nSavta. So ca -- 1s that -- can I --",
        "Q: Yeah, whatever",
        "A: Alright, alright.",
        "Q: -- you just keep on going until you --\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: And Savta\u2019s very loving, she\u2019s very emotional, she cares a lot about everyone\nin the family. We\u2019re especially close because I\u2019m the eldest. And I\u2019m also proud\nof her, she survived, she has a ton of interesting stories, too. She speaks seven\ndifferent languages, she\u2019s -- and just the other day I found out she knows calculus\nand she\u2019s a very intelligent woman. And she\u2019s in good shape, she walks every day.\nAnd I\u2019m very proud of each of them.",
        "Q: How do you know much about who they were as -- ab-about their history, did\nyou read their books, did they talk -- di-did they tell you?",
        "A: I\u2019ve heard stories ever since I was old enough to understand what they meant,\nabout the war. I also read Against All Odds. Of course, I\u2019ve -- ve known most\nof the stories that were going to be in the book before I read the book. My\ngrandfather\u2019s full of stories, he just tells and I treasure them because he\u2019s a great\nstoryteller. He composed a book of vignettes, and over two years ago I read that,\nit\u2019s coming out soon. And I\u2019ve heard a lot orally, and I\u2019ve read a lot. The one thing\nI -- ve heard a lot about his boyhood, his childhood in Poland. I -- I ha -- I\nhaven\u2019t really -- I started reading the book, A Jewish Boyhood in Poland, but I\ndidn\u2019t finish that.",
        "Q: Do you think you might go actually to Poland someday to sort of see where\nthat history started, or it hasn\u2019t occurred to you yet?\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: It occurred to me to go to Poland and the surrounding area, but it would have\nbeen part of more of an organization or a program like the March of the Living,\nrather than to explore his childhood. But I think it would be interesting to see\nwhere he grew up, but I don\u2019t know what remnants there are.",
        "Q: Do you remember -- not the book so much, but do you remember parts of\nstories that they told you when you were a youngster, when you go back -- not\nnow, but -- but then, when you were maybe, I don\u2019t know, five or six or\nsomething?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is there anything that is particularly strong in your mind? If you could repeat\nthat or talk about it a little bit.",
        "A: Well, I always picture my grandfather as a heroic -- I see him mostly as a\npartisan fighter. He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined\nthe Russian army, but that\u2019s the image I picture him, and he\u2019s told me heroic war\nstories and the like, and that\u2019s what comes to mind when I think of him. And my\ngrandmother, she\u2019s told me stories too, and she was beautiful, and I just picture\nher as the charmer she was, as she went as a -- she masqueraded as a Pole. And\nthat\u2019s the picture I get of her.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: Were there some stories that affected you in a different way? That were very\ndifficult for you to -- to hear, for some reason?",
        "A: A lot of the stories I was told, they inspired me and they made me proud of my\ngrandfather. One was where he was -- he was shot five times by his friends who\nturned on him, and he\u2019s obviously still alive today. And he has the bullet wounds\nto show, and -- but he -- I never heard so much of the atrocities that happened\nduring the war, only much later, now. And I learned a lot more about them through\nmy own reading, because I\u2019m also very interested in the Holocaust, I\u2019ve read more\nthan several books over -- on the issue, I\u2019ve seen movies, and through them I\u2019ve\ngotten a more complete picture. I\u2019ve visited, of course, the Holocaust Museum in\nWashington, D.C., and Israel, and --",
        "Q: Was that on your -- on your own initiative, or did you also learn about it in\nschool?",
        "A: I actually -- I -- I went to a parochial school, and surprisingly they didn't teach\nvery much about the Holocaust, I\u2019m assuming because they took it for granted that\npeople understood what it was. We only briefly touched upon it in eighth grade.\nWe didn\u2019t have a very general history course. But I\u2019m aware that a lot of my\nfriends that have gone up through the system in the public schools, they -- they\nknow -- they know about what the Holocaust 1s. They\u2019ve learned about it.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: Did you talk to your -- d-do you have a feeling that you knew more about -- in\na sense because you knew your grandparents, or because -- or did already learn\nwhat you were taught in school, kind of?",
        "A: Absolutely. I -- I feel that I know a lot, a lot more about the Holocaust, and\nabout all -- not all the aspects, but a lot more of the aspects than my friends, or\nthan I was taught in school. And even in the books that I\u2019ve read, because I have\nmy grandfather to talk to, and whenever I had a question or -- I talked to him and I\ngot firsthand feedback.",
        "Q: Did he ever -- did they ever, either your grandmother or your grandfather, come\nto school to talk about it?",
        "A: Well -- to my school? Not when I was there. They -- my grandfather, he 1s a\nspeaker, he goes around and he constantly speaks at high schools, and junior high,\ncolleges. He came to my brother\u2019s school, which was my old day school, but I was\n-- this was last year, so I must have been -- was either -- I was either a sophomore\nor junior. And he spoke briefly, and they put up a plaque.",
        "Q: Do you talk to some of your friends, or did you talk with -- to some of your\nfriends about your grandparents and about your own thoughts on the Holocaust?",
        "A: I don\u2019t talk about my own thoughts on the Holocaust because I\u2019m not sure\nthere\u2019s so much room in that aspect, I think it\u2019s an atrocity. If I ever had a friend,\nDecember 7, 2000\nwhich I haven\u2019t, but if someone made light of it, then I would. I do talk about my\ngrandparents because, as I mentioned earlier, they\u2019re just spectacular people. I\nused to brag to my best friend about how many languages they spoke, and how\nthey -- they have a very rich past, rich life. They\u2019re very impressive and I admire\nthem for that, and I\u2019ve bragged countless of times.",
        "Q: Is that interesting to you? I mean, to your friends? Do they want to know about\nit?",
        "A: It -- my friends were impressed. I -- I didn\u2019t go into all the stories, but I -- I told\nthem some and ther -- they\u2019re entertaining, they\u2019re funny. I never told them any of\nthe really sad ones.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You can think for a moment, if you want.",
        "A: Lam.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] still like to know.",
        "A: Why didn\u2019t I tell them sad ones?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: To be honest, I think that as they were my friends that I was telling these to,\nthey were meant to be more entertaining. I was younger then. I don\u2019t think that it\nDecember 7, 2000\nwould have been proper conversation material if I started going into the severity of\nthe Holocaust.",
        "Q: Did it also feel sort of private because it was something that affected your\ngrandparent\u2019s life very, very much? Do you feel like a little bit, protecting that\npart, or is that over interpreting?",
        "A: I don\u2019t feel that, but there 1s actually -- I have mentioned how I lost a lot of my\nmother\u2019s -- the family on my mom\u2019s side. That does come to mind, I have told\npeople that, because -- cause of they\u2019re -- my father and my mother\u2019s side 1s\ndisproportional. But did I -- I did not mention how it actually came to be and how\n-- | me -- I know, of course, the history of how she hid up in the apartment and sh -\n- the rest of her family was down in the basement, with the whole remainder of the\napartment building. I -- I -- I mean, I never told them that.",
        "Q: Do you -- have you sort of -- do you feel that your -- your mother\u2019s experience\nwith those -- with that -- with her parents was -- was -- and hearing the stories was\na little different than your own? Did you -- is there sort of a difference that you\nsee?",
        "A: In hearing the stories? I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: Well, in her response maybe, to them.",
        "A: Do you mean by her upbringing, and how -- how --\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: Yeah. That you were maybe a little bit more removed from it, I mean, that you\ncan sort of -- I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just fishing right now, to see whether -- you were\nlistening, are you -- do you feel that you are listening to -- to your grandparents\nmaybe in a slightly different way than your mother could?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m listening to them differently, because I feel that I have a\nvery strong connection to them. But I\u2019m positive they had a much more profound\ninfluence on her just because she lived under them, and she must have told you in\nthe other tapes. And I was just more removed from living with them, and they\ncame up and when they came up, I -- you know, I had to finish all the food on my\nplate. But she had to live with that, so in that way I think she was more profoundly\naffected. I mean, she would -- never even would have considered to date someone\nthat was not Jewish, whereas I did, despite I -- it greatly upset my mom, and even\nmore so my grandparents.",
        "Q: What does it mean for you to be Jewish? What --",
        "A: To be Jewish 1s, for me it\u2019s my identity and for me it\u2019s more a part of me than a\nreligious aspect, it\u2019s more a way of life and a sense of pride in my identity, like I\nwould say that I\u2019m Jewish not because I believe in all the aspects of Judaism. I\ndon\u2019t keep kashrut and I don\u2019t pray three times a day. And I\u2019m not absolutely the\nDecember 7, 2000\nmost religious person I know. And yet I strongly identify myself as a Jew, and am\nvery proud to be a Jew. And in that sense I feel that that\u2019s my connection.",
        "Q: You speak Hebrew.",
        "A: I do.",
        "Q: When -- when did you -- did you learn that in school, or --",
        "A: I -- I did learn Hebrew at school. I\u2019ve learned some at home, my dad speaks\nHebrew, very, very archaically, it\u2019s the equivalent to what Shakespeare would be\nto English. It -- he speaks perfect Hebrew, whereas it hasn\u2019t been modified by the\nslang and the colloquial of Israel. My grandmother also speaks Hebrew. She\ntaught it.",
        "Q: Did you go to Israel\u2019?",
        "A: I\u2019ve been to Israel s -- many times. I love Israel. I --",
        "Q: Talk a little bit more about -- about the country, what you love about it, and\nalso about the family that you the -- that you have there, maybe.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know where to begin about Israe -- it\u2019s -- you know, it\u2019s a huge\ntopic, it\u2019s beautiful in every way. The people are beautiful, the land is beautiful,\nthe culture is beautiful. But my family, I -- I -- I do have family there. I\u2019m not very\nclose to much of it, except for my grandmother\u2019s sister, whose my grand-aunt, and\nI\u2019ve been -- she used to have a kibbutz in Israel and I was there several times, and\nDecember 7, 2000\nI visit her every time I go up to Israel, and some of my cousins, but besides that\nthere\u2019s some family I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You just don\u2019t know them well enough, or you don\u2019t relate to them for some\nreason?",
        "A: I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve met all of my family.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk about the family of your -- the other grandparents, from -- from your\nfather\u2019s side.",
        "A: From my dad\u2019s?",
        "Q: Yeah. How do you -- how are they, how do you relate to them?",
        "A: My -- my grandparents on his side? I -- I don\u2019t really relate to them at all. I\u2019m\nnot close to his mother, and his father died at a young -- when I was young. I\nwasn\u2019t very close to him either. I was always much, much more close to my\nmother\u2019s parents than my father\u2019s. And that -- that was since I was a young child.\n[indecipherable] question.",
        "Q: And had that to do, had -- yeah, sort of. I just have -- always have a little follow\nup.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s okay.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: Did that have to do with who they were, or did that have to do with that you\njust were more exposed to them, that you lived more closely to them, and then you\nget to know them better, or something [indecipherable]",
        "A: They -- they both live within a half an hour away and they\u2019re each five hours\nfrom here, so no, we -- I went up, I saw each of them. We actually always slept at\nmy father\u2019s mom\u2019s house. I -- I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t connect to her as I do to my\nmom\u2019s parents. I honestly would like to be like my grandfather in so many ways.\nHe\u2019s an impressive man. I love my grandmother on my mom\u2019s side too, she\u2019s very\nkindhearted and sweet and warm and intelligent. And I don\u2019t see that in my\ngrandmother on my father\u2019s side. I -- nothing strikes me as special about her. I\ndon\u2019t want to say that because --",
        "Q: Okay, we'll leave that -- never mind, we\u2019ll just leave it at that. I don\u2019t --",
        "A: -- no, well, why don\u2019t we do that.",
        "Q: -- that -- that\u2019s all right, I just want to know more about the other grandparents\nanyway.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go to your siblings. Do you -- d-do they have as -- do you think, from\nyour perspective, do they have a similar relationship to your grandparents -- now\ntalking about your mother\u2019s parents.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Or is there a different --",
        "A: They\u2019re too young, and they -- my grandparents are getting older, less patient. I\n-- th-there\u2019s tension between the two occasionally. My -- out of the two sides, my\ngrandparents and my brothers. They get along, but I don\u2019t feel they have the same\nrelationship that I do.",
        "Q: When you talk to each other, your siblings[indecipherable] are there questions\nthat they ask you that they don\u2019t ask them, and -- to try to explain certain things, or\ndo they relate to certain stories that they may have heard, differently than you? Do\nyou have one example? I mean, I don\u2019t want to belabor this, but if there\u2019s\nsomething --",
        "A: Regarding the Holocaust at least, as I said, I think they\u2019re too young still.\nAaron\u2019s turning 13, Michael\u2019s 10, and they\u2019re much more interested in video\ngames.",
        "Q: You heard it at five though, or at four --",
        "A: Well, I was told these stories firsthand.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: At that point I was much more in contact with my mother\u2019s parents. I saw them\n-- we went up, and down to New Jersey. They came up much more frequently.\nDecember 7, 2000\nAnd -- I\u2019m trying to think back when I started reading all those books about the\nHolocaust. And I would have -- I\u2019d say yeah, you know, maybe 12, maybe 13.",
        "Q: Was it difficult for you to sort of accept that something like that cou-could\nhappen? Did you have, sort of, questions that you wondered about things, and\ncould you bring that up somewhere, if you had those questions?",
        "A: I did have questions. One of my questions was my grandparents still believed\nin God. It\u2019s such a enormous event, the Holocaust, it\u2019s not easy to just treat -- even\nin an interview like this -- how can someone not wonder why something like that\nhappened? And even when we see it again everywhere. Even now it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t\nknow, I -- I-I -- I feel it\u2019s different though. I feel like -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Try. What\u2019s -- what\u2019s the diff -- what\u2019s the -- what\u2019s the difference?",
        "A: Between -- for me, the Holocaust, from the pictures I\u2019ve created, from pictures\nI\u2019ve seen, photographs, from movies, from books I\u2019ve read, from my grandfather\u2019s\nstory, it just seems so much more atrocious than anything even now in the world\ntoday where similar things happen. Kosovo and Serbs, and -- and I just think it\u2019s\nso much more terrible, and I -- I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right, but I-I relate more to\nthe Holocaust, obviously.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family now. How do you see -- how do\nyou see your mom and your dad and your siblings? Sort of describe a little bit the -\n- the family, the relationships that you have.",
        "A: Well, Pll start it out with my mom, cause I probably have the closest\nrelationship with her. And she\u2019s a very warm woman just like my grandmother.\nShe\u2019s very understanding. We -- as I child, I -- I must have -- you know, I -- she\nwas always the one that would buy me clothes and take me to get a haircut. I was\nalways closer to her than my father. And I used to play games with her and chess\nand every night she used to sing me Shema and she used to read to me. I\u2019m very\nclose to her. A couple -- and part of 1t was because I had a girlfriend that was, in\naddition to being non-Jewish, not really the nicest of people. And my mom and her\ndidn't get along at all. And that, maybe my mom\u2019s work, other aspects led to\ntension and for the last year or so things have become more tense and she\u2019s had a\nshorter fuse and been more irate. But now I -- now that I broke up with her, my --\nmy ex-girlfriend now, I feel that things are getting -- you know, they are much\nbetter. I\u2019m very close to my mom again, I hardly fight. With my dad also, I don\u2019t -\n- we used fight all the time, it used to be an issue of he\u2019d say do this, I\u2019d no, I\ndon\u2019t want to. Now, I -- I -- I help out. You know, he instilled in me a set of values\nthat\u2019s th -- what the two of them really wanted to achieve, and I think they have.\nDecember 7, 2000\nHis main goal was to leave a legacy behind, and I think he accomplished that, and\nI get along with both of them now.",
        "Q: In terms of a legacy, in terms of what, a f -- a family, a profession of life?",
        "A: His legacy on my -- my dad\u2019s legacy would have to be one of principle. My\ngrandfather\u2019s -- of course he wants to leave a legacy behind, and that is of the\nHolocaust and his survival. And he feels, and I feel the same way, that he\nshouldn\u2019t survive to see his heritage lost.",
        "Q: Do you feel that you want to contribute, or that you can, or that you even\nshould contribute to that in some way, to keep memory alive, somewhat?",
        "A: I certainly do. And I don\u2019t doubt for a second that I will be telling my children\nand showing them in the movies, and reading them the books, of course when they\nbecome old enough to be able to understand. And teaching them about the\nHolocaust too, because | think it\u2019s extremely important that they know what their\nheritage is and where they came from.",
        "Q: Yeah, I think we should flip over the cassette at this point. This is the end of\ntape one, interview with Dustin Dezube, and it\u2019s side A.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Dustin Dezube. This is tape number one, side B. Okay, let\u2019s talk\nabout your own aspirations then, for your own family. How do you think you\u2019re\ngoing to bring up your own kids, if you want them?",
        "A: I do want kids, and I would like them to remain Jewish as well. I, myself, when\nI was dating a non-Jew as I mentioned -- I would never marry a non-Jew. If it was\na non-Jew I was dating seriously, I would exp -- implicitly -- although I would\nhave to bring it up at one point, that she would convert to Judaism. If I had a\ndaughter, I would want her to marry a Jew, as well as if I had a son, although I\u2019m\nnot sure I would disown them as I\u2019ve often been threatened myself by my\ngrandparents. I would be very disappointed, and I think that would put some\ntension on our relationship. I hope though that won\u2019t be an issue, and I hope to\nraise my daughter with the notion that that\u2019s how it should be.",
        "Q: Your grandfather told me that you went to Israel once with a youth group,\nright?",
        "A: I did.",
        "Q: What -- what did you do, what was the purpose of that trip and what did you do\nthere?\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: It was sponsored by the sawha, which 1s the Israeli army, and I toured Israel\nwith members of the army, and I participated in gonof for a couple weeks, which\nis boot camp, basically. And I went around and I got a new perspective than\nanother tour group might have given me. It was very interesting and I connected,\nand I\u2019ve often been asked to join the American army now that I\u2019m a senior. I have\nrecruiters calling me constantly, but if I was to join an army, I\u2019d much rather be\npart of the sawha than the United States army.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: I feel I connect to them more. I -- I connect to Israel more than America\nbecause in Israel everyone\u2019s Jewish. I have family there, and I have a history\ngoing back. I have learned about it since I was five years old, about Israel, about\nthe temples, about the western wall, the [indecipherable], everything.",
        "Q: What about your friends here? Are they all Jewish, or do you also have non-\nJewish friends?",
        "A: I have -- I live -- I used to be sheltered in a parochial school, and all of my\nfriends were then Jewish. When I entered high school, the atmosphere is not, of\ncourse all Jewish, and I have a lot of friends that are not Jewish. But I do live ina\ncommunity that despite being, you know, o-open to everyone, of course, there is a\nDecember 7, 2000\nlarge percentage of Jews. It\u2019s a large Jewish community. So I do have friends that\nare non-Jews, and I -- but I also have a lot of friends that are Jews.",
        "Q: What kind of hobbies do you have, and what do you want to become, in terms\nof profession, what are, sort of, your aspirations?",
        "A: I like to play pool. I like to play basketball. I -- my -- in terms of profession, I --\nI want to go into gene therapy. I think that\u2019s a fascinating field.",
        "Q: Into gene therapy?",
        "A: Gene therapy, I\u2019m taking an internship next semester at Genzyme, which is a --\nit -- it works with genes, it\u2019s a genetic industry.",
        "Q: What interests you particularly about that, the scientific challenge, the -- I don\u2019t\nwant to lead you here, just --",
        "A: The scientific challenge. It\u2019s a breakthough field. What -- it -- 1t has so little\nboundaries, it\u2019s amazing. You could take it anywhere. It\u2019s the building blocks of\nlife, you can understand everything, it\u2019s just so fascinating. That\u2019s another issue,\nit\u2019s -- it\u2019s hard to go into. I -- this diverges completely from --",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: -- the Holocaust, but --",
        "Q: It\u2019s part of your life though, so --\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: It -- itis. But with genes, you can -- you can fix what went wrong in nature. If\nsomeone has diabetes, you can insert the right sequence. And it\u2019s so small, but you\ncan insert it into them and they can start producing insulin themselves, rather than\nhave to take it from a pig. And that\u2019s amazing, I think, that you can change\nsomething like that and of course once you get on that level, and if -- we\u2019re not\nthere yet, but eventually you can cure all sorts of things, all ailments, you know,\ncancer, you can -- and I don\u2019t want -- I don\u2019t want to tamper with hu-humanity and\n[ -- it\u2019s not my idea to make a perfect race, or you know, make everyone\u2019s IQ 150.\nBut just to help people that have specific ailments.",
        "Q: How do you feel about today\u2019s Germany. Have you ever talked to a German?",
        "A: I\u2019ve never talked to a German that wasn\u2019t Jewish, except I -- I know one girl\nthat\u2019s German, but she\u2019s -- she\u2019s a classmate, she\u2019s -- she\u2019s younger than me.\nShe\u2019s a freshman now. And never about her.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: You\u2019re the first German I\u2019ve probably spoken to and -- and I -- you\u2019ve told me\nsome things, and I -- I have wondered, do Germans relate to the Holocaust? What\nis there -- what\u2019s the general attitude and I\u2019m extremely interested over what it\nwould be for the different generations. How -- what -- what did survivors from\nthat period -- or not survivors, but the generation in -- that participated in the\nDecember 7, 2000\nHolocaust, what do they feel now? What do their -- what does the second\ngeneration feel, what about the third? And yeah, I have wondered about that.",
        "Q: And there are few books here, right? One can\u2019t really read about 1t much.",
        "A: I haven\u2019t seen anything about that.",
        "Q: Could you imagine going to Germany\u201d",
        "A: I could. I could imagine going to Germany, and I[ think that would be\nworthwhile to find out.",
        "Q: When you heard that I would interview you today, what did you sort of -- have\nI asked you the question that you expected me to ask, or is there something that\nyou really wanted to talk about?",
        "A: Some of the questions were different, but they were along the lines that I\nexpected. I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d go more into depth over the Holocaust itself, and\nhit different aspects of that. But aside from that, I -- I feel that you\u2019ve covered\neverything that I expected and more.",
        "Q: Mm. I guess that was the question --",
        "A: This is a --",
        "Q: -- more like should we, is there something missing that we sort of --",
        "A: Yeah\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: -- sort of should address in terms of friends, interests, your grandparents, your\nfamily.",
        "A: I mean, there\u2019s some topics that I could go and on about if time permitted.",
        "Q: Like what -- now that you mention it. That was a dangerous thing to mention.\nLike what?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: Israel.",
        "A: Not -- not even Israel but my -- my grandparents, you know. I mean, I\u2019ve had\nsuch a close relationship to them, and they\u2019ve profoundly influenced my life, and I\ncould just go on about that for --",
        "Q: D-Do that a little bit more, if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "A: It\u2019s just that they -- they\u2019ve had a very strong impact on me, not -- not just in\nterms of the Holocaust, but it was always up to their expectations that I hoped to\nlive. I-I-In terms of grades, I used to tell them how well I did in school, and not so\nmuch my parents, that I care about what they -- what they thought, but my\ngrandparents. I never wanted -- I mean, I still do -- I don\u2019t ever want to disappoint\nthem. And I always try very hard not to, whether it\u2019s by getting good grades or\ndating a Jew. And it meant always a lot to me, what they thought, their opinions.\nAnd | -- | -- I -- I love them, they\u2019re just incredible people. And they came up for\nDecember 7, 2000\nmy Bar Mitzvah, they came up for my graduation from eighth grade. We\u2019re very\nclose. I remember from my [indecipherable] graduation, which was Hebrew high\nschool, it was the Sunday school that I continued, my grandfather came up, even\nafter there was some issue with his heart. And I\u2019m -- it me-meant a lot to me, and\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m -- I Just try to, not make them happy, but live my life in a way that\nwould make them proud. Whereas I don\u2019t do that for my father\u2019s mom, or -- or for\neven my parents, because I\u2019m -- I\u2019m close enough to my parents -- I -- I-I\u2019m close\nenough to my grandparents that I want to live up to their expectations, but I\u2019m\nremoved enough that I can -- that I can try to do that, whereas at home with my\nmom and my father, of course, they see everything what\u2019s going on every single\nday. They know when something happens if I -- if I missed school today, if I\nplayed hooky. So it -- it\u2019s a different relationship. And I would never want to\nreally present -- I only want to present the best to my grandparents, whereas my\nparents get the whole -- the whole deal.",
        "Q: The whole deal, huh?",
        "A: Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Q: Yeah, well that\u2019s -- that\u2019s -- parents have to deal --",
        "A: I want them to be -- I want my grandparents to be proud of me.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "Q: Do you think there\u2019s a little bit more patience in you dealt -- being with your\ngrandparents, a little more patience with how them dealing with you, than with\nyour mother in this, somewhere?",
        "A: In terms of?",
        "Q: In terms of with each other? Do you think you have more patience for your --\nwho your grandparents are than your mother could have, maybe, for some reason?",
        "A: Um --",
        "Q: Is it easier sometimes to be more understanding a little bit than -- across two\ngenerations apart than maybe from generation to generation, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: All right, I think I see what you\u2019re asking. I m -- live in [indecipherable] I live\na bunch of idioms in our language, sayings that sum up that some things don\u2019t\nchange. And you know, you let -- they\u2019re two generations beyond, it\u2019s not worth\nfighting over some certain points. And I -- I understand that. I understand where\nmy grands-parents are coming from when they wanted me to eat everything in my\nplate. And maybe my mom wasn\u2019t able -- she was a little less patient, but just\nprobably because she had to live with it, whereas I don\u2019t, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\ncan be an ordeal. I have to -- I mean, as much as I love my grandparents, every\ntime they come up I have to prep myself because I don\u2019t have the luxury of just\ngoing to sleep when I\u2019d want, you know I have to spend time with them, which I\nDecember 7, 2000\nlike to do, but I -- I can\u2019t go out then, and if I had to live with that constantly,\nmaybe.",
        "Q: We\u2019re jumping back and forth, but maybe that\u2019s kind of interesting in itself,\ntoo. A lot of people talk about lessons of the Holocaust. For you personally, what -\n- what is something that you draw from -- from that terrible event, from knowing\nabout it in ways that we cannot talk about quite, because the time is too short, and\nit\u2019s too complex. But sort of what are the lessons, quote unquote, as you see them?\nAt least now.",
        "A: The lessons are that you have to be proud of who you are. My mom tries to\ninstill that in me. My grandparents tried to. And that believe it -- I think it\u2019s true,\nyou -- you can\u2019t just not -- you -- you have to maintain a strong sense of identity to\nprevent these things from happening in the future. I\u2019m getting back to the point I\nwas saying, that even though I\u2019m not really religious, I strongly identify myself as\na Jew. And you need to stand up for that.",
        "Q: As an American, too?",
        "A: As American, too. I think if people wanted me to, I don\u2019t know, become a\nCanadian, I don\u2019t -- maybe. I strongly identify myself -- not s -- even more as a\nJew than as American. American is where I live. There\u2019s y -- America\u2019s a big\nmixing pot, there\u2019s all different cultures.

My middle\nDecember 7, 2000\nname, Isaac, I believe comes also -- comes after my grandfather\u2019s father. My last\nname is artificial, it was made up upon coming to America. And that\u2019s my name.",
        "A: I\u2019ve seen pictures of them, but the fact that my name, it\u2019s not a very strong\nconnection.",
        "A: I do, Davide, and that also -- that was translated. There was no connection.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: This is, of course, on my mother\u2019s side, and they are both great people, but\nquite different. My grandfather, he\u2019s a storyteller, he\u2019s tenacious, in a good way.\nHe\u2019s funny, he\u2019s loving. He\u2019s done so much with his life. I\u2019m really proud of him,\nDecember 7, 2000\nand there\u2019s a lot of aspects of him which I'd like to emulate in myself when I grow\nolder. Not all, but a lot.",
        "A: I admire his determination. His ability to stick to principles. I admire how he\nmade himself up from an immigrant to what he is now. I admire his courage and\nstrength that he exhibited during the war. And my grandmother, she\u2019s very loving,\nshe\u2019s very emotional, whereas my grandfather is not as emotional. The one thing I\ndo remember him getting very upset about was I dated, briefly, a girl that wasn\u2019t\nJewish and that deeply upset him. But that\u2019s over.",
        "A: I did, I -- I -- I certainly understood where he was coming from. At the time I\nwas young and I had no -- no intentions of having a serious lo -- relationship with\na non-Jewish girl. That was never -- it didn\u2019t cross my mind. I -- I do -- I do factor\nthat in when I look at girls. But my grandmother, getting back to her, she\u2019s -- well\nactually, I actually call him Sabba, which is grandfather in Hebrew, and I call her\nSavta. So ca -- 1s that -- can I --",

And I\u2019m also proud\nof her, she survived, she has a ton of interesting stories, too. She speaks seven\ndifferent languages, she\u2019s -- and just the other day I found out she knows calculus\nand she\u2019s a very intelligent woman. And she\u2019s in good shape, she walks every day.\nAnd I\u2019m very proud of each of them.",
        "A: I\u2019ve heard stories ever since I was old enough to understand what they meant,\nabout the war. I also read Against All Odds. Of course, I\u2019ve -- ve known most\nof the stories that were going to be in the book before I read the book. My\ngrandfather\u2019s full of stories, he just tells and I treasure them because he\u2019s a great\nstoryteller. He composed a book of vignettes, and over two years ago I read that,\nit\u2019s coming out soon. And I\u2019ve heard a lot orally, and I\u2019ve read a lot. The one thing\nI -- ve heard a lot about his boyhood, his childhood in Poland. I -- I ha -- I\nhaven\u2019t really -- I started reading the book, A Jewish Boyhood in Poland, but I\ndidn\u2019t finish that.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: It occurred to me to go to Poland and the surrounding area, but it would have\nbeen part of more of an organization or a program like the March of the Living,\nrather than to explore his childhood. But I think it would be interesting to see\nwhere he grew up, but I don\u2019t know what remnants there are.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I always picture my grandfather as a heroic -- I see him mostly as a\npartisan fighter. He was the partisan fighter for a period of time and then he joined\nthe Russian army, but that\u2019s the image I picture him, and he\u2019s told me heroic war\nstories and the like, and that\u2019s what comes to mind when I think of him. And my\ngrandmother, she\u2019s told me stories too, and she was beautiful, and I just picture\nher as the charmer she was, as she went as a -- she masqueraded as a Pole. And\nthat\u2019s the picture I get of her.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: A lot of the stories I was told, they inspired me and they made me proud of my\ngrandfather. One was where he was -- he was shot five times by his friends who\nturned on him, and he\u2019s obviously still alive today. And he has the bullet wounds\nto show, and -- but he -- I never heard so much of the atrocities that happened\nduring the war, only much later, now. And I learned a lot more about them through\nmy own reading, because I\u2019m also very interested in the Holocaust, I\u2019ve read more\nthan several books over -- on the issue, I\u2019ve seen movies, and through them I\u2019ve\ngotten a more complete picture. I\u2019ve visited, of course, the Holocaust Museum in\nWashington, D.C., and Israel, and --",
        "A: I actually -- I -- I went to a parochial school, and surprisingly they didn't teach\nvery much about the Holocaust, I\u2019m assuming because they took it for granted that\npeople understood what it was. We only briefly touched upon it in eighth grade.\nWe didn\u2019t have a very general history course. But I\u2019m aware that a lot of my\nfriends that have gone up through the system in the public schools, they -- they\nknow -- they know about what the Holocaust 1s. They\u2019ve learned about it.\nDecember 7, 2000",
        "A: Absolutely. I -- I feel that I know a lot, a lot more about the Holocaust, and\nabout all -- not all the aspects, but a lot more of the aspects than my friends, or\nthan I was taught in school. And even in the books that I\u2019ve read, because I have\nmy grandfather to talk to, and whenever I had a question or -- I talked to him and I\ngot firsthand feedback.",
        "A: Well -- to my school? Not when I was there. They -- my grandfather, he 1s a\nspeaker, he goes around and he constantly speaks at high schools, and junior high,\ncolleges. He came to my brother\u2019s school, which was my old day school, but I was\n-- this was last year, so I must have been -- was either -- I was either a sophomore\nor junior. And he spoke briefly, and they put up a plaque.",
        "A: I don\u2019t talk about my own thoughts on the Holocaust because I\u2019m not sure\nthere\u2019s so much room in that aspect, I think it\u2019s an atrocity. If I ever had a friend,\nDecember 7, 2000\nwhich I haven\u2019t, but if someone made light of it, then I would. I do talk about my\ngrandparents because, as I mentioned earlier, they\u2019re just spectacular people. I\nused to brag to my best friend about how many languages they spoke, and how\nthey -- they have a very rich past, rich life. They\u2019re very impressive and I admire\nthem for that, and I\u2019ve bragged countless of times.",

        "A: Lam.",
        "A: Why didn\u2019t I tell them sad ones?",
        "A: To be honest, I think that as they were my friends that I was telling these to,\nthey were meant to be more entertaining. I was younger then. I don\u2019t think that it\nDecember 7, 2000\nwould have been proper conversation material if I started going into the severity of\nthe Holocaust.",
        "A: I don\u2019t feel that, but there 1s actually -- I have mentioned how I lost a lot of my\nmother\u2019s -- the family on my mom\u2019s side. That does come to mind, I have told\npeople that, because -- cause of they\u2019re -- my father and my mother\u2019s side 1s\ndisproportional. But did I -- I did not mention how it actually came to be and how\n-- | me -- I know, of course, the history of how she hid up in the apartment and sh -\n- the rest of her family was down in the basement, with the whole remainder of the\napartment building.

        "A: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m listening to them differently, because I feel that I have a\nvery strong connection to them. But I\u2019m positive they had a much more profound\ninfluence on her just because she lived under them, and she must have told you in\nthe other tapes. And I was just more removed from living with them, and they\ncame up and when they came up, I -- you know, I had to finish all the food on my\nplate. But she had to live with that, so in that way I think she was more profoundly\naffected. I mean, she would -- never even would have considered to date someone\nthat was not Jewish, whereas I did, despite I -- it greatly upset my mom, and even\nmore so my grandparents.",
        "A: To be Jewish 1s, for me it\u2019s my identity and for me it\u2019s more a part of me than a\nreligious aspect, it\u2019s more a way of life and a sense of pride in my identity, like I\nwould say that I\u2019m Jewish not because I believe in all the aspects of Judaism. I\ndon\u2019t keep kashrut and I don\u2019t pray three times a day. And I\u2019m not absolutely the\nDecember 7, 2000\nmost religious person I know. And yet I strongly identify myself as a Jew, and am\nvery proud to be a Jew. And in that sense I feel that that\u2019s my connection.",
        "A: I do.",
        "A: I -- I did learn Hebrew at school. I\u2019ve learned some at home, my dad speaks\nHebrew, very, very archaically, it\u2019s the equivalent to what Shakespeare would be\nto English. It -- he speaks perfect Hebrew, whereas it hasn\u2019t been modified by the\nslang and the colloquial of Israel. My grandmother also speaks Hebrew. She\ntaught it.",

The people are beautiful, the land is beautiful,\nthe culture is beautiful. But my family, I -- I -- I do have family there. I\u2019m not very\nclose to much of it, except for my grandmother\u2019s sister, whose my grand-aunt, and\nI\u2019ve been -- she used to have a kibbutz in Israel and I was there several times, and\nDecember 7, 2000\nI visit her every time I go up to Israel, and some of my cousins, but besides that\nthere\u2019s some family I don\u2019t know.",

I\nwasn\u2019t very close to him either. I was always much, much more close to my\nmother\u2019s parents than my father\u2019s.

        "A: Regarding the Holocaust at least, as I said, I think they\u2019re too young still.\nAaron\u2019s turning 13, Michael\u2019s 10, and they\u2019re much more interested in video\ngames.",
        "A: Well, I was told these stories firsthand.",

They came up much more frequently.\nDecember 7, 2000\nAnd -- I\u2019m trying to think back when I started reading all those books about the\nHolocaust. And I would have -- I\u2019d say yeah, you know, maybe 12, maybe 13.",
        "A: I did have questions. One of my questions was my grandparents still believed\nin God. It\u2019s such a enormous event, the Holocaust, it\u2019s not easy to just treat -- even\nin an interview like this -- how can someone not wonder why something like that\nhappened? And even when we see it again everywhere. Even now it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t\nknow, I -- I-I -- I feel it\u2019s different though. I feel like -- I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: Well, Pll start it out with my mom, cause I probably have the closest\nrelationship with her. And she\u2019s a very warm woman just like my grandmother.\nShe\u2019s very understanding. We -- as I child, I -- I must have -- you know, I -- she\nwas always the one that would buy me clothes and take me to get a haircut. I was\nalways closer to her than my father. And I used to play games with her and chess\nand every night she used to sing me Shema and she used to read to me. I\u2019m very\nclose to her. A couple -- and part of 1t was because I had a girlfriend that was, in\naddition to being non-Jewish, not really the nicest of people. And my mom and her\ndidn't get along at all. And that, maybe my mom\u2019s work, other aspects led to\ntension and for the last year or so things have become more tense and she\u2019s had a\nshorter fuse and been more irate. But now I -- now that I broke up with her, my --\nmy ex-girlfriend now, I feel that things are getting -- you know, they are much\nbetter. I\u2019m very close to my mom again, I hardly fight.

And he feels, and I feel the same way, that he\nshouldn\u2019t survive to see his heritage lost.",

And I don\u2019t doubt for a second that I will be telling my children\nand showing them in the movies, and reading them the books, of course when they\nbecome old enough to be able to understand.

If it was\na non-Jew I was dating seriously, I would exp -- implicitly -- although I would\nhave to bring it up at one point, that she would convert to Judaism. If I had a\ndaughter, I would want her to marry a Jew, as well as if I had a son, although I\u2019m\nnot sure I would disown them as I\u2019ve often been threatened myself by my\ngrandparents. I would be very disappointed, and I think that would put some\ntension on our relationship.

It was very interesting and I connected,\nand I\u2019ve often been asked to join the American army now that I\u2019m a senior. I have\nrecruiters calling me constantly, but if I was to join an army, I\u2019d much rather be\npart of the sawha than the United States army.",

And you know, you let -- they\u2019re two generations beyond, it\u2019s not worth\nfighting over some certain points. And I -- I understand that. I understand where\nmy grands-parents are coming from when they wanted me to eat everything in my\nplate. And maybe my mom wasn\u2019t able -- she was a little less patient, but just\nprobably because she had to live with it, whereas I don\u2019t, and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\ncan be an ordeal.
