        "Q: Okay. We are on. Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name is Elizabeth Koenig. I was born in Vienna, Austria, on March 7, 1924.",
        "Q: Tell me about your parents. What did your father do and where did you live?",
        "A: Uh...We lived in the inner city. My father was a journalist. Uh...He now lives in New York.\nHe's an international writer. His...his studies were...he had a Ph.D\nin...uh...1nternational...uh...international...he was an international lawyer in international law.",
        "Q: What...How...Where did you live? What was it like for you as a little girl?",
        "A: We lived in a very large apartment. My parents were very lively, had a very\nlively...uh...environment. I was...uh...taken care of by a nurse maid. Uh...We had a lot of\ncompany. My parents went to the theater, to the...to the opera, to concerts, and I started to go\nto the theatre very early in my life.",
        "Q: Uh...Besides theatre, what kinds of other things did you do as a little girl?",
        "A: I learned how to read when I was...uh...4 years old. And I read a lot. And I walked a lot. We\nwent in parks. Uh...I played with my little friends. I went to art school. Uh...It was called\nCzisek Art School, and it was specially for little children.",
        "Q: What about being Jewish in Vienna?",
        "A: I can't really answer this question in general. I can only answer this for my family. Uh...We\nwere culturally contingeous Jews, but we did not practice any religious rites, and we didn't\ngo...have Jewish holidays. I went...from the time on I went to school, I had religion in\nschool. I learned about the Bible, and I learned how to read Hebrew. Uh...And I went...I was\nonce in a play...uh...when I was about 7 years old, and...uh...1t was about Esther. (Long\nPause)",
        "Q: As the Nazis began coming to power...uh...1n Germany,...uh...did that affect your life at all?",
        "A: Yes. At that time, we...my father had moved his family: my brother, myself, and my mother\nto Berlin. He was editor of the newspaper in Berlin, and when the Nazis came to power, we\nlived in..in the capital of Germany. He was very...uh... endangered because he\nwas...uh...uh...on the Nazi blacklist as a liberal writer and journalist.",
        "Q: What did that mean for you....your family, that he was on the blacklist?",
        "A: Well, I didn't know that at the time. My parents didn't tell me. Uh...I only knew that we\npacked in a hurry and left Berlin as soon as possible which was easy for us because we had\nAustrian passports. And...uh...the laws about German Jews did not apply to us. So we went\nback to Vienna. Uh...My father had lost his job. Uh...And so we had to...our life became very\nrestricted from that time on. We lived with my grandparents. My grandfather was a\npediatrician. Uh...My mother's...that's my mother's father. My father's father had died. He\nhad been a lawyer.",
        "Q: What happened next?",
        "A: When we came back to Vienna, we...uh...my brother and I went to schools...uh... There was\nno language difficulty and...uh...we continued school life until...uh...my...but my father had\ngreat difficulties finding a job. Uh...He was...uh... he resented the...uh...anti-Semitism in...1n\n...1n Austria. Uh...It was undercover, but it was there and so after he tried very hard to with\nall kinds of various jobs, he decided he's going to leave Austria and he went to Prague to\nestablish himself there. So when the Nazis came to Austria, our family was separated. My\nfather was in Prague, and my mother and my brother and I were in Vienna.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: Uh...At this point, of course,...uh...everybody was very worried, and...uh..my father wanted\nus to come to Prague, but it was too late. Somehow, I cannot give you the details, but we\ndidn't get permission and we didn't get permission to go anyplace. My mother tried\neverywhere, and my father was frantic and he...he suggested that we meet in Addis Ababa or\nin Martinque just so that we could be reunited again. And then finally he got a visa from\nPrague to...uh...France, and he moved from...to France, hoping that that he would have it\neasier to have his family follow, but it turned out that the French did not...uh..permit us to\ncome. And...uh...uh...so one day...uh...my father just said...In the meantime, the Nazi laws\napplied to Austria, and...uh...my father recognized the danger, and...uh...said we had...just\nhad to leave at all cost. And...uh...we...uh...we took a bus from Baden Baden in Germany that\nmade an excursion into France, Strasbourg, then came back to Baden Baden, and we\nintended to leave the bus in Strasbourg, but we were very foolish because...uh...we didn't\ntake much but we had one piece of luggage for the three of us. And, of course, when we\ncame across the border that piece of luggage was...uh...discovered, and...uh...people asked,\n\"Whose luggage is it?\" And we said, \"It's ours,\" and then they they said, \"You...you weren't\ngoing to visit the Cathedral of Strasbourg. You were going to come illegally to France and\nthey stamped our passport and sent us back to Germany. And...uh...my father said to my\nmother, you have to try again, and we went to...uh...we went to...uh...uh... Can you cut it off\nplease?",
        "Q: It's okay. Let's put it back it on. You are about to try again. Tell me.",
        "A: Yes. I...We went to Saarbrucken and...uh...wanted to go to France from Saabricken, and this\nwas already the...the...this was the days of the Munich Acccord, and you could feel the\ntension in both countries and the...the troops on the frontiers and when we came to\nthe...uh...railroad station, there was an SS man and he said, \"I know what you want. You\nwant to go illegally to France. You won't make it.\" And my mother said, \"Let us try it.\"\nAnd he said, \"Okay, I'll let you try it, but 1f you come back you will be sent to Dachau.\" And\nSO we went over without a visa to France, and, of course, we were caught. There were more\npolice in France than ever. And we were caught and we were put into prison, and then we\nwere put back on the train again and when we arrived the next day it was, I think, at the\nstation in Forbach....No. Excuse me....at the station in Saarbrucken, the same SS man was\nthere and he...it was like... He smiled like I told you so. And then we were put into separate\nrooms and we were... I don't know what happened exactly to my mother and my brother. I\nknow they were beaten. I know I was stripped completely and a little...little beaten.\nAnd...uh...then I was...we were released and we were thinking now we are on our way to\nDachau. And I can't explain it but somehow they gave us an opportunity to escape and we\nran and we escaped. And...uh...We found ourselves together again outside the railroad station\nand...uh...my mother contacted my father in Paris and he said, \"Go to Cologne and try to get\na visa from the Consul there. I am going to contact him and I hope he will give you the visa.\"\nAnd my mother went to with us to Cologne, but the Consul did not give her a visa. He...I\nwasn't with my mother so I don't know exactly what happened. We were...uh...waiting for\nher. When she came back, she was crushed, completely...completely crushed. She was a\nchanged person. She...At this...by this time, of course, you realize we had been...uh...always\nin the same clothes and had not changed and...uh...had not had the opportunity to...uh...have\nany... uh...semblance of human life. And...uh...she was completely...she dissolved and...and\nshe decided we had to go back to Vienna. This was the only way we could survive.\nAnd...uh...She went 1n this state in the middle...she didn't want to show it to us, I think,\nhow...how desperate she was. And so she went to...to sit on a...a...1n a little place in Cologne\nin the middle of Cologne and I only know by her story what happened. I didn't see it.\nUh...uh...Secretary from the...uh...Embassy arrived and asked her, \"Aren't you the lady that\nwanted the visa?\" And she said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"Well, do you have any jewelry?\"\nAnd she said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"Well, maybe we can do something.\" And so she traded\nall her jewelry and got three visas, and we were on our way to the airport before you could\nsay anything and we...uh...arrived in Paris and my father was there and I think I'll never\nforget walking into the airport in Paris into freedom. And...uh...my father took us to a little\nhotel and we...uh...we stayed there...uh...1n the middle of town and I remember being\nvery...uh...hungry all the time because we had very little to...money. My father had...had no\njob and...but soon after that, he...uh...managed to make a newspaper, a newsletter, not a\nnewspaper, a newsletter. He wrote it all himself, a little bit like the Kiplinger Newsletter,\nabout economic situation in Western Europe and...uh...he got people to subscribe to it and he\nhad a...uh...multiplication machine and...uh...he...he sent out his newsletter. I...I...I did the\ntechnical part, the photocopying and making of the newspaper, and we were able to live\nfrom his income and soon we had...uh...a little apartment and...uh...my brother went to\nschool and...uh...everything seemed...uh...to pick up except that we were very worried about\nour family that we had left behind. My father...my grandfather....uh...was...because he was a\ndoctor was not allowed to leave. He was under strict orders to stay in Vienna and take care of\nthe sick. And if he had tried to leave he would have been arrested. My other\ngrandmother...uh..lived with...uh...my father's brother and they tried to go to England, and\nmy mother's sister...uh...her husband was actually put into Dachau concentration camp on...\non Kristallnacht. And so we had cause to worry. And...uh...1n the end, my family was able to\ngo out of...uh...Austria in various ways.",
        "Q: Tell me...tell me about...a little more about life in Paris. Uh...I believe you had someone\nliving with you.",
        "Q: Uh...Well, as soon as we had the apartment...uh...we tried to help other people who had no\napartments and...uh...no place because as...when you pass through such...uh...events,\nyou...you feel fortunate when you get a little...a little something already. And so...uh...my\nLatin teacher, for instance, who...who left Austria... And she was...she was not Jewish. She\nwas...uh...she was Catholic, but she had a Jewish boyfriend, and was anti-Nazi. And so she\nwanted to leave Austria. She came to our place and stayed with us until she had a job. And\nit's...she had a job offer from a little village in France...uh...the name of which we had, of\ncourse, never heard before, and it turned out that her...she was going to teach German in Le\nChambon Feugerolles. And then we had other people sleeping in our place, whoever had no\nhome.",
        "Q: What did you do during this period?",
        "A: Uh...I wanted to go to art school. I always wanted to be an artist. And so I took an\nexamination to...for an arts school and prayed that I would be accepted, and I did get\naccepted. It was a question then to...uh...pay because schools in France are essentially free.\nSo it wasn't much. And...uh...I just...uh...had...uh...some lady helped me with the paying of it.\nSo I went to the art school and...uh...that was...I was very thankful for that. I had a\nwonderful...uh...experience. My brother went to boarding school too.",
        "Q: When and how did things begin to change?",
        "A: It became...it...with the declaration of war between...uh...Germany and France on...in...uh...I\nwould like to add too that in the period just before I..I met a young student who, a Czech\nstudent, who today is my husband. And...uh...he...he at this time, he was a student in Paris,\nand he liked to come to our house and discuss politics with my father. And...uh...when the\nwar was declared, I would...I have to add something that is more general now because our\nsituation in...1n France was ambiguous for the French because we were Austrians, and\nAustrians were Germans. So we were part of the enemy. On the other hand, they did\nunderstand vaguely that anti-Nazis could not really be an enemy, so it was very difficult for\nthem to apply enemy laws to these types of refugees that came to France. But...and it\ndepended actually on the individual...how he interpreted the laws. So when the...uh...war was\ndeclared on September, the 3rd, 1940...No...Excuse me...1939...uh... There immediately,\nthere was a mobilization of the French population and also there was a call for foreign\nnationals who were non-enemies to...uh...help the French effort to fight the war.\nNow...uh...My father would have joined it, but he was not allowed to join it. He was...the\nAustrian men, my father and my brother, were considered enemy aliens at this point, and\nthey were ordered to go into concentration camps. So my brother and my father had to go\ninto concentration camps. They were not together. My brother was in one camp, and my\nfather was in another. The...the women were left outside so my mother and I stayed in Paris.\nUh...The Czech student, whose name is Ernest, engaged himself into the Czech army\nthat...the Czech army in exile, and he...we were all wanting to help the war effort to fight the\nNazis. And also we didn't think it would...uh...the Nazis would win. I... mean at this point\nwe were convinced we're going to save...uh...the world from Nazism.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: What happened?",
        "Q: Your father is...your father and brother are in camps. You are outside the camps. How did\nyou live at that point?",
        "A: You know that is a good question. I hardly know how to answer. Uh...My...my\nmother...uh...my mother had, in her youth when she was about 20 years old...uh...helped my\ngrandfather to take care of the wounded in World War I, so she had a little bit of nursing\ntraining. And...uh...she then went and by word of mouth tried to do some nursing and she got\nmoney from ...from that. And...uh...1n France...[...you...I went...wanted to do babysitting or\nteaching languages or whatever, but in France...uh...there isn't no...you don't...do babysitting.\nAt that time, you didn't do babysitting. You were a nurse maid. But you didn't do babysitting\nin the evenings like you do it in America. And I didn't want to give up school, so...uh... I had\njust a few occupations, a few times that I could earn money and I tried by all means to do it,\nbut it was very difficult. We lived from day to day. That's the answer. And...uh...as a matter\nof fact, there's a...there's a very funny story, but I am not going to go into it. You want me to.\nUh...In school, we had...uh...party. And...uh...I was told, \"Oh, Elizabeth comes from Vienna.\nBring us a Viennese cake. And my mother was able to do it, but we didn't have the money to\nbuy the ingrediences, so how are we going to do this Viennese cake without saying that we\ndon't have the money? I don't remember any more how we solved the problem. I remember\nthat...uh...I was terribly embarrassed. And another story is that...uh...we had a Spanish girl in\nthe school and...uh...1n France, it was...we...there were a lot of Spanish refugees at this time.\nAnd, of course, I felt close to this girl because she was 1n my opinion a co-sufferer, and we\ngot to be very, very good and close friend. Her...her name is Maria. And at one time, Maria\ninvites me to her house. And...uh...I look at her address and it was the Rond Point des\nChamps Elyssees and...uh... Okay, I...another thing is I never had enough money for metro,\nso I walked a lot and also later I got myself a bicycle. But at this particular point, I...I walked\nto the Rond Point, and when I came to the address it...1t was the French Embassy.\nAnd...uh...I was very astounded and I rang the bell and the bell...door was open and I walk in\nand in front of me 1s the portrait...of...of Franco, an enormous portrait of Franco, and I got\nvery frightened, but I say, \"Okay.\" I walk in and I turn around and upstairs is my little\ngirlfriend, Maria, say, \"Come up. Come up.\" And I walk up, and there's a tremendous\nportrait of Hitler. And I walk up, and my little girlfriend, Maria, was the daughter of the\nFrench...of the Spanish Ambassador. (Pause) By the way, he became Ambassador to\nAmerica later.",
        "Q: You were in this limbo for awhile. Did your father come back from the internment camp at\nthis point? What happened to your father?",
        "A: Yes. And...uh...meantime, we went visiting my...I went visiting my brother once. I couldn't\nvisit my father, but he was released from camp. My brother was...uh...not released, and he\nwas released from camp. I don't know why.",
        "Q: Tell me about the visit to your brother. You have drawn a picture of it.",
        "A: Well, I...that...that is why I got a bicycle. I had to...I wanted to visit my brother\nand...uh...somebody was selling a bicycle and so I figured 1t would be much less if I bought a\nbicycle and go instead of taking the train. So I bought this bicycle, which I named\nBarthalemus, and I went to see my brother. And I got permission. It was very rare that\npeople got permission to visit. And I was very happy to do this. I was very happy to see my\nbrother.",
        "Q: So your brother remained in camp, however? He was not released?",
        "A: No. My...my father was released, maybe because of his age? I don't really know why.",
        "Q: Can you describe his coming home?",
        "A: Oh, it...one day he appeared. It was completely unexpected. He appeared and we just...1t was\nlike...like sunshine coming back. (Laughter) It was great, and I remember all he wanted is to\ntake a bath...uh, read his newspaper, and have a good meal.",
        "Q: When did things change for you yet again?",
        "A: And then...uh...he didn't stay long. My father didn't stay long because he had to engage\nhimself in to what was called Camp de Prestataire which was part of the French Army unit\nactually.\nIt was the same thing as a concentration camp, only it was called Prestataire, and the other\ndifference is...1s then we got...uh...a little compensation from the French government for his\nbeing...uh...engaged so to speak as a Prestataire. It was ...uh....1t was not any more a prisoner.\nIt was...uh...you were engaged in taking part in the war effort.",
        "Q: Alright. So your father was more or less in this service?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Uh...When did things begin to get a little worse? What...what happened to you?",
        "A: Uh...Well, things got worse when...uh...things got worse for France.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell us about that.",
        "A: Uh...We had...we had...uh...the Germans advanced. In the beginning, it was called the Drole\nde Guerre because nothing happened. And then in...in the springtime, the Germans advanced\nand...uh...the unexpected happened. They weren't...they weren't....they were victorious.\nNobody had imagined that. They conquered Belgium. They conquered Northern France.\nAnd...uh..we couldn't believe it. At one point, you could hear the...the cannons\nand...uh...and...uh...the...the streets and everything in Paris were dark...of course, darkened,\nand you could hear the bombs. And it was frightening, and people started running away.\nMost of the French people had a place in the...1n Southern France somewhere and or\ngrandparents and knew where to go, but people like us didn't know where to go, so we\ncouldn't make any plans, but also we couldn't make any plans because the police did not let\nus travel. And...uh...we were told by our conciege that we should not even think of leaving\nour apartment in Paris, because she would...uh...notify the police. And...uh..so we were\nunder...under observation, and we didn't know what to do. In the end, when the pressure\nbecame so...I mean...by pressure, I mean we realized the Germans are going to be in Paris in\n2 days. Uh...We decided we are going to leave. And...uh...we didn't know where my brother\nwere...was, and nor where my father was. Uh...We...we assumed that my father\nwas...uh...somewhere fighting perhaps or in the work camp, and my brother equally\nand...uh...but we didn't know where they were, and we didn't know where to go and we had\nno means of going any place except the bicycle. So we decided the following: My mother\nwould go on foot. She would make auto stop, and I would follow her wherever she would\ngo. And...uh...so I wouldn't have a...a destination except the destination where the car that\nwould accept her would take her. That would be my destiny and our destiny. And it...we...we\ndidn't imagine the difficulty of carrying out this plan, but we went to the Port d'Orleans in the\nsouth of Paris, which was uh...group. already filled with people leaving and it's very difficult\nto even recognize the layout. And...uh...But quickly I got a...a car for my mother. I...My\nmother was too shy to do the auto stopping herself, and...uh...so I did it for her. And then I\nput her into the car, and then I quickly asked the driver where he was going as he rolled\naway, and he said, Rambouillet and so I took my bicycle and all I knew is...was my mother\nwas on the way to Rambouillet. And as I bicycled I realized I don't know where in\nRambouillet I am going to meet her. Also there were more than one road to go to\nRambouillet, so she could be in the north, or east or west of Rambouillet. Fortunately, by\nalmost a miracle I found her at the entrance of Rambouillet. I was looking at every car and I\ncan't tell you today how come I found her. I found her. It's not very far from Paris.\nAnd...uh...We stayed the night there at a very poor woman's house who was\nvery...uh...uh...to whom we were very thankful for taking us in. We slept at her house and the\nnext day, the voyage started all over again. But we had learned to be a little more precise\nabout our destination. So we said when the...the next person says where he is going, we will\nmeet at the Marie, at the city hall of this particular village, because every village in France\nhas a city hall. So the next time, I...uh...I think it was...we went to Chauteaudun, and then we\nmet in Chauteaudun. And it was at the city hall and again we were very lucky. We met\nsomebody who offered us...uh...a...a place in his house to sleep. And the next day, my\nmother...we went to...oh, I think...no, the next... Excuse me, I...I think I am mixing it up. The\nnext day we went to Chatres, and there's a... Yes. And somehow I went much faster than my\nmother because of the....the roads were all clogged with people and...uh...the bicycle could\ngo in and out and the...the cars were stuck. So, I arrived at...uh...Chatres earlier than my\nmother and...uh...I waited for her. And then...as she came, at the moment she came, there\nwas...uh...uh...bombing attack, and we had to run into the shelter. And I remember taking my\nmother's hand and leaving the bicycle outside and taking my mother's hand and running into\nthe shelter. And when we came out of the shelter 2, 3 hours later, there was two policemen\nstanding next to my bicycle and they said, \"Is this your bicycle?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" And\nthey said, \"You're a German spy.\" And I said, \"I am not a German spy.\" And they said,\n\"What's this?\" And showed me..in my...I had taken along in my...my musette, I had taken\nalong Ernest's passport. I had taken along Goethe's Faust, and I had...and something else that\nindicated to them that I am...I had some German origins and they arrested my mother and\nmyself and put us in jail. And...uh...I couldn't believe it. I said, \"What...what are you doing?\nI mean I...We're just trying to flee from the Germans, and you say I am a German spy.\" I\ncouldn't believe it, but they didn't listen. And...uh...somehow...uh...at 5 o'clock in the\nmorning, they opened the cell and they said, \"The Germans are coming. The Germans are\ncoming. Run away.\" And I took my mother, and we ran away, literally. I even found my\nbicycle, and...uh...then we went to Chateaudun. And then from Chateaudun, the next\nday...we...the next day we...we said we are going to Blois if possible because we were\ndepending on...we couldn't say at anytime where we wanted to go, only where....where we\ncould go. Right? So, I...when my mother got into a car, this car went to Vendome. So I was\nsupposed to meet her in Vendome and I came to Vendome. And at that time the...the roads\nwere clear and I expected my mother to be in Vendome before me because with a bicycle\nyou go slower than with a car, but she wasn't there. And I was worried and...uh...but I didn't\nhave much time for worrying because a bombardment started again and...uh... a man came to\nme and said you have to...to leave where you are in front of the...uh...city hall to go and go\ninto shelter. And I said, \"I can't go into shelter. I am waiting for my mother.\" He said, \"You\ncan't stay here. It's not allowed. You have to go into the shelter.\" So I put a big piece of\npaper with my mother's name and telling her that I was in the shelter, and then I went to the\nshelter. And when I came out of the shelter, the piece of paper was gone and my mother\nwasn't there. So I couldn't understand anything, and I was pretty upset because my mother\nperhaps had seen it, but she hadn't come to the shelter or she hadn't waited for me. What was\nI supposed to do? She wasn't there. And the Germans were going to come. So in my being\nso upset, I...uh...looked at the....I1 don't think I had a map, but I must have looked at\nsomething that shown me that the camp of my father was only 3 or 4 miles away from where\nI was. So I decided that I'm going to see if I cannot find my father and then come back to this\nplace in Vendome. Or go to Blois where we said we would be together this evening. So I left\na note again at the Marie saying that I am on the way to look for my father. If it is late, I will\ngo back to Blois and find her at the Marie in Blois. And when I came to the place where my\nfather was supposed to be, there was...the camp was empty. And I found one officer there\nwho packed his luggage and he said Yes, your father was here about 4 hours ago. He...he\nwent with his...uh...group. Uh...He went into this and this direction, and you probably can\ncatch them if you bicycle fast. So I was torn between trying to find my father and going to\nBlois as I had promised my mother. And I thought I would find my father for sure, but I\nwouldn't find my mother perhaps. Perhaps I wouldn't find my mother. And so I decided to go\nto where my father was. And I bicycled and bicycled and bicycled and then finally, I realized\nI was bicycling...bicycling in the wrong direction toward the Germans and...uh...after I had\nbicycled for 4 hours and not found my father.... I don't know whether I had gotten the wrong\ndirections or whether I...I can't...I can't say what went wrong there. Anyway after 4 hours\nbicycling, I was at the end of my physical possibilities. And I propped myself against a tree\nand...and passed out. And then when I came to myself, I was surrounded by four Belgian\nsoldiers who gave me sugar and fed me sugar and then I woke up and...uh...they\nsaid...uh...you'll have to move from here. The Germans are coming instantly. And I said, \"I\nam looking for my father. I have to go to this other direction.\" They said, \"No. Your...your\nfather is not there. Your father couldn't be there.\" Then I said, \"Okay, then I go to Blois and\nfind my mother. And they said, \"Okay. We go with you.\" And we took the road and went to\nBlois, and as we came to Blois, the policeman said, \"You cannot cross the bridge anymore.\nWe are going to blow it up.\" And I was on the other side of the Loire, the city hall was on\nthe side of the bridge they were going. In other words, I couldn't go to the city hall anymore.\nAnd...uh...I...[...[ nearly threw myself on the bridge, but they took me off and...uh...they said,\n\"You can't do this. You can't go across.\" I said, \"I have to find my mother.\" And they said,\n\"Your mother is not there, because we are going to blow this whole thing up.\" And so I...this\nis why I lost my mother too. And...uh...they blew up the bridge. The...the bombs rained\ndown. The whole thing looked like in a...looked so surrealistic. The fire, the bombs, the\neverything. And...uh...I was lost. And...uh...I went to the...uh...to a barn and...uh...cried, and\nthat was it. And then the...the Belgian soldier said, \"If you want to go, you could go down\nsouth of France with us. We are going down there.\" So I said, \"Fine. I'll join you.\" And this\nwas very lucky for me, because they were very...uh...dependable fellows and I had learned in\nthe meantime that to go with four fellows was safer than to go with one. And...uh...we...this\nmust have been....I don't know what day this was anymore, but any...anyway, we went to\nthis...toward the south and bicycled and bicycled. And one day...uh...where we stayed\novernight... We...we fed ourselves by taking things from...uh...the fields actually.\nAnd...uh...the...the boys were very inventive about this and they always found something to\neat. And...uh...uh...at...at one time, however, we went to...uh...Centre..how do you say?",
        "Q: Hospital?",
        "A: No, not hospital. Uh...where they...they took in refugees and...uh...we went to this Centre\nd'Accueil and in the Centre d'Accueil was a young man.... I...everywhere I went, I asked\nabout my father, mother, and brother if anybody had seen them. And I also asked in the\nCentre d'Accuiel whether anybody had seen anybody of my family and somebody said\nfrom the description, they think they know my brother. And so where he was last seen a few\ndays ago in Toulouse. So, I said, \"I have to go and find my brother.\" And I said goodbye to\nthe boys and...uh...took off for Toulouse the next morning and bicycled as fast as I could to\nToulouse. And...uh...I arrived in Toulouse at noon...noon, before noon and I went to the\nCentre d'Accueil in Toulouse and I realized that Toulouse was a big city. It wasn't like a little\nvillage. It was already before the war...I mean...yes, before the war it was a million people.\nAnd at this particular time...uh...the refugees came all from the north, not only Belgium or\nLuxembourg, but all the French people and they had...and the city of Toulouse was swelled\nto two million people. And they had this Centre d'Accueil to take care of them...uh...take care\nof them is a euphemism...uh... It...1t was dreadful. There were murders and rapes and a\nterrible place. But what could you do? Where would you stay otherwise? And...uh...so I\nwent to this place and I inquired where I would find my brother. And at every meal I went up\nand I said, \"Is there anybody who knows my brother?\" And I couldn't find him so. So I was\npretty desperate by the evening. I went to the middle of the city and...uh...the middle of the\ncity was quite different. There were lots of people, and some people had enough money to go\nto restaurants and cafe houses, so I looked into the cafe houses and I found actually people I\nknew...uh...from Paris and...uh...but I didn't find my brother. And I was very, very\ndiscouraged because I had to go back to this awful place and as I walked down to go\nto...back to the Centre d'Assueil, I went through a little street and at the end of the street there\nwas my brother and he sold newspapers. And that's how I found my brother. He was there.\nI...I...1t was...I don't know. I can't say I mean how it happened. It was there. He was there.\nAnd, of course, we were both very happy and...uh...he...uh...he had a girlfriend with whom\nhe lived and he said he would meet me the next day at the...uh...post office and then we\nwould discuss what we would do together and we would rearrange everything what we\nwould do. And so the next day at 10 o'clock I came to the post office and...uh...I was\nimpatient. He didn't come right away, so because he was...I was impatient I went to\nthe...uh...one of the counters, one of the...where you sell things. What do you call it?",
        "Q: Store\u2019?",
        "A: No. No. No. In the post office",
        "Q:",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Opening. One of the opening windows. One of the windows in the post office.\nAnd...uh...where they...1n France they have what is called poste restante and...uh...I don't\nknow if this is here too. There is no such a thing where they keep the...uh...letters or for other\npeople, and you go. You identify yourself and you can pick up your mail that way. And so I\nwent to one of the windows and I asked, \"Do you have any letter for...for me?\" And they\nsaid, \"Yes.\" And I certainly hadn't expected anybody write me a letter because nobody knew\nI was in Toulouse. Nobody on earth knew that on that day I was going to be Toulouse. And\nthere was a letter! And I looked at it. It was from my mother. And she...that letter...1t was a\nvery short, little letter saying...uh..Elizabeth, if you get this letter, I am in Baucus, and I am\nwaiting for you. And so when I...my father...my brother came to the post office, I gave him\nthe letter. I said, \"Look here. I found my mommy and your mommy.\" And we were so\nhappy. And so...so I said, \"Immediately, I will go and find here.\" The letter was already 10\ndays old, so I was afraid she would not be there anymore. So I...uh...said to my brother,\n\"You'll hear from me when I find my mother.\" And I went to the train station with my\nbicycle. I had only enough money to go to Pau and from there on, I had to take my bicycle\nagain and bicycle to where my mother was which was close to the Spanish frontier. And I\ntook the train to Pau and took out my bicycle, and as I was in the railroad station, I saw a...a\nlittle man who was in a similar uniform as my father had when I...uh..he went into the\nPrestataire. And since I recognized the uniform, I went to him and I said...no, I went to\nhim...he... I heard him shout in German, and I went to him and I...I realized that he only\nspoke German and he...I said to him something about my father and he was very rude. He\nsaid, \"I don't want to speak about anything. I want to find my wife.\" And he...he was rude to\neverybody. So I said to him, \"This isn't anyway you are going to find your wife. I can help\nyou because I speak French. I'll help you.\" So, it turned out that his wife was in Gurs, in the\nconcentration camp in Gurs and he was looking for her. I found out how he could find...go to\nGurs from Pau, and told him exactly which train to go. In fact, went with him to the train, set\nhim into a compartment, and then I said, \"Have you ever seen my father because you have\nthe same kind of a uniform?\" And he said, \"Yes. Yesterday.\" And he...I said, \"My\ngoodness, as the train was already starting to roll. \"Please tell me where it was?\" And he\nsaid, it was in...near of Limoges.\" I said, \"Exactly where it was?\" So shouting out of the\nwindow, he gave me the telephone number I could call. And...uh...he departed. And...uh...I\nwas flabbergasted, of course, as you can imagine. I took my bicycle and just as I went to\nToulouse, I went to Barcus to find my mother. And when I came to Barcus, it wasn't as I had\nimagined either. It was a very, long drawn out village. I didn't know exactly where my\nmother was, but I...and I went to the first cafe and asked them if they would know my\nmother. And at that point I realized that everybody in the village knew I had been lost\nbecause my mother thought I had been killed in the...uh...bombardment in Blois Just as\nmuch as I had been desperate for her, she has...had been desperate for me. She did not think I\nhad survived it, and she had told everybody that she mourned her daughter. And so when I\ncame to this little village, everybody looked at me as if I were a ghost. And they told me\nwhere my mother was and I came into her little house where she lived in a peasant hut. And,\nalso, a moment I will never forget in my life, my mother looked at me like coming back from\nthe dead. And here I was, and here was my mother. And not only could I tell my mother\nand...and...uh...embrace my mother and kiss her and...but I was able to tell her, \"I know\nwhere my brother is. I know where my father 1s.\"",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. At this point, we will break and change tapes. Perfect place to break.\nTape #2",
        "Q: Go ahead. Tell us the story of the letter.",
        "A: The story of the letter? All right. While I was Toulouse, I wrote a letter to...uh...a friend of\nErnest in Switzerland, saying that I was alive and...and if he would know where Ernest is to\nwrite me a letter poste restante in Toulouse. Okay. I come now back to...to my\nmother...mother's meeting. Uh...We, of course...there was only one thing to do 1s to go back\nto Toulouse, see my brother, and go back to and find out if my father was where this man\nhad said he was. I had seen him. So we first went to the telephone booth and dialed this\nmagic number and...uh...we found my father and...uh...he came to the farm and...uh...it...1t\nwas incredible. Incredible! So, of course, he said, \"Come immediately.\" And...uh...so our\naim was... Yes, he was in Limoges, near Limoges, which was beyond Toulouse. So our aim\nwas to go to Toulouse and then from Toulouse to...to where he was. Okay? So that's what\nwe did. I...uh...1n parenthesis, I may say we took the train and...because...of course, because\nmy mother had no bicycle. We took the train and everything we owned was robbed in that\ntrain which included, unfortunately, our food cards...cards...and all identity cards. Everything\nwe still had was stolen in this train ride, which is terrible because when you don't have\nidentity cards and no food cards at this time, it's hard to exist. Well, I don't know what we did\nin..to...uh...get food at that point. I...I've forgotten. Uh...We arrived in Toulouse. It was a\nterrific reunion with my brother and...uh...we....my mother had a tiny bit of money from this\ncompensation of the French Government. That was...so we could pay for our fare. And we\nhad decided we are going then now to go to my father. My brother wanted to stay in\nToulouse and...uh...but before we went to take a train ticket to...to go my father's, I went to\nthe post office and there was a letter from...uh...Ernest's friend, saying that Ernest was very\nclose to where my mother had been. So I said to my mother, \"I am going to go and find\nErnest. Now that I know the way!\" (Chuckle) So my mother understood and she said, \"You\ngo ahead, and we meet at your father's.\" I rode down again, met Ernest, and he had\nbeen...uh...in this little place and my meeting with Ernest was also in the street. He didn't\nknow I was coming. I saw him walking tn the street and...uh...1t was also unbelievable.\nSo...and the next day, I convinced him to go with me to see my father. But he had not been\ndemobilized yet so he said, Okay, I think it's best if I go first to, I think, Tarbes, but I am not\nsure...uh...to get demobilized because then I also get a little money when I undemobilization,\nand then we can...I can take a train ticket and we don't have to go by bicycle and...and other\nstuff. And...uh...So he went to Tarbes, got a little money, and we went to see my father. And\nthen we lived with my father on my father's ration. My mother, Ernest and I, all three of us\non one ration and that couldn't last. So Ernest decided he's going to look for a job. But, of\ncourse, he wasn't allowed to work, so he had to...No, he wanted to be...Excuse me...He\nwanted to be a student actually and continue his studies, so he went to Grenoble and what\nhappened to him is another story, A very, very sad and long story. Uh...My mother and I, in\nthe meantime, stayed with my father, living off this soldier's ration, and...uh... If you ask how\nthis life was, it was very difficult, very very difficult. Uh... This village had no school, where\nI could go to. Uh...We had practically no place to sleep. Uh...Finally, we got...arranged\nfor..for a place where my mother and my father could stay in one room and I could stay in\nanother room. And...uh...I got acquainted with the library there, La bibliotheque, and...uh... I\nmust say I got as good an education from just reading one book after the other 1n the...in the\nbibliotheque ...uh... I read all of Romain Rolland, all of Baudelaire, of Maupassant...uh... Not\nbad! And...uh...uh...otherwise, we...the days were spent collecting...uh...uh...food such as\nberries and chataigne. What is it..uh...uh...uh... No. And...uh...just the daily life to...to wash\nyourself was quite a problem. We had...you had to go to a public bath and there...I don't think\nthere was any for women. It was difficult. And...uh...Well, main concern then was to find out\nwhere my grandparents were. And...uh...We couldn't get in touch with them. We couldn't\nfind them. And my...uh...that was more or less the daily task.",
        "Q: Under what circumstances did you leave that town?",
        "A: And one day we received a letter from our...the lady who was my Latin teacher in Vienna,\nwho had gone into a village...uh...to become a German teacher, and she wrote me and my\nfather...parents a letter saying that as things do not look...uh...too well... In the meantime, of\ncourse...I digress. You excuse me. In the meantime, the Vichy\ngovernment...uh...persecute...started to persecute the foreigners and to persecute especially\nthe foreign Jews and we had to live...uh...not...uh...yet in hiding, but on the edge of society.\nAnd...uh...when the letter came, the teacher said that she would suggest that I come to where\nshe is, which is Le Chambon ____ and she would have a job for me. During the summer\ntime, I could take care of Pastor Trocme\u00e9's children and in the fall, I could go to school. So\nmy parents' decided this was a much better solution for their daughter and I wasn't very\nhappy to leave my parents, but I went to Le Chambon ___ and there I was received by\nPaster Trocm\u00e9 and...uh... I...my job was to take care of the children, to help in the household,\nand to do anything else that was necessary. And...uh...that's what I did.",
        "Q: Can you describe life in the Trocm\u00e9 household please, in the school?",
        "A: That wasn't the school.",
        "Q: I'm sorry. Describe...describe...describe life taking care in the...in the Trocm\u00e9 family.",
        "A: Yes. The main...the main thing was there were four...four children. The Trocme's had four\nchildren. One of them was only 2 years younger than I, so actually...uh...uh...that...uh...Nellie\nwas not under my charge at all. She was 14 years old, and I remember played beautiful piano\nand was very independent young lady. Uh...The children that I was taking care of Jon Pierre,\nwho was 12, Jacquo, who was 10, and Danielle, who was 7. And...uh...the...this was summer\ntime and the children did not go to school, so you had to take care of the children from the\nday...from the moment they opened their eyes til the moment they closed their eyes. They\nwere very, very active little children, so that's what you had to do. And the...the main task\nwas to take them out...outside, so that they could play, and I remember taking long walks and\ntaking picnics and mainly trying to keep peace amongst them because they were\ncontinuously fighting. (Chuckle) And...uh...uh...this...then I had to help with preparing the\nmeals and...uh...the...it......but what I remember most...most is the evening meal where we all\nsit around the table and...uh... It was a very moving moment when Pastor Trocm\u00e9 said the\nprayers and the whole...the whole rhythm of the day changed. It...1t was very busy\neverywhere where...when, you know, you hear about the busyness, about the lots to do in the\nTrocm\u00e9 house and it was true. It was a dynamic situation and at that moment, everybody was\nquiet and thoughtful and completely changed.",
        "Q: What did you know about what the Trocm\u00e9 were doing to help other Jews?",
        "A: I didn't know about their plans at all. One day, however,...uh...Mother Trocm\u00e9 told me that\nthey intended to have children come from the Condegeres and that when they are in Le\nChambon, they would want me to go there in..1nto the same house to help with the children\nbecause the children would not know French. A lot...a lot of the children would not know\nFrench, and they wanted me to help with the children. Would I do that? And I said, \"Of\ncourse.\" And then, also.,...at...at...one thing happened that made...did...1t was very strange.\nThey did not treat me like a refugee child. They treated me more like a French\nchild...youngster. Right? Uh...Be...I don't...[ mean I wasn't...they did not realize so much\nmy...my background, I don't think. Until one day, I receive a letter from my grandfather\nsaying that they were going to go to Cuba and I was terribly upset. I thought that I would\nnever see my grandparents again, and I cried very much. And then they realized that...uh...I\nhad the similar background to the children that they were helping and...uh...I think they\nwere...uh...very glad I could be...uh...bridge between the people of the village and the people\nand the children.",
        "Q: Can you tell me something about the Trocm\u00e9s? What were they like as people?",
        "A: Uh...Pastor Trocm\u00e9 was a very distant person. I've read...uh..several descriptions of him as a\nperson, and he was all of them. All of the descriptions was...were...are true. When I say he\nwas a very distant person, then I mean he was a very distant person at the beginning, at the\noutset. He...he was...he was a leader. He was a leader. To...to his wife he was completely\ndifferent. His relationship with his wife, 1t was completely different. He was very warm. So\nhe was both warm and distant.",
        "Q: And Mrs. Trocm\u00e9?",
        "A: And...uh...I have a tendency to call her Mama Trocm\u00e9. Mama Trocm\u00e9 was a\nwonderful...uh...caring person...uh...who...who did everything. She...she would\n..uh...uh...do...uh...peel potatoes as much as she would help another person. I mean she\nwould be there for...for her own household. She had an awful lot to do. The daily difficulties\nwere enormous for her. Enormous. She had four boarders in her house. In order to survive\nfinancially, the Trocme's had to have boarders. And...uh..when...they... they gave her a lot of\nwork.",
        "Q: When you moved around in the town, how did it feel like for you as a Jew?",
        "A: I didn't move around in town.",
        "Q: Not at all?",
        "A: I didn't. I was with the children or in the house. I never moved around town. And then when\nI was 1n the house with the other...the house was called Lagasbe. Uh...If you want to come to\nthat period now...uh...that...I was first in LeChambon during the summer. Right? And then\nwhen the school started, I moved to Lagasbe. And...uh...when I came to Lagasbe, the\nchildren from Gurs ...were...had already arrived, I think a day or 2 before. And...uh... There\nwas a room for the girls and a room for the boys. Was very, very small. Very small and\ncrowded. So I was in the girls' room. And...uh... There my task was to...(pause)\nuh...to...uh...help them in any way you can. I mean there was not an assigned task. You\nhelped because they were des... These children had just left their parents, and they were in a\nsituation where they hardly knew where they were. They...they did not understand where\nthey were. They...uh..knew they were somewhere in France without their parents. They had\ncome from Germany. They had...uh...arrived in Gurs 1n...1in the camp. They...they had been\ntransported from Gurs to Le Chambon. And...and they had no idea where they were and\nwhat they were there for. So, you...you had to...to hold their hands. That's what it was.\nYou...you had to hold their hands because they were alone. All of them. Each one of them.\nUh...Then I was told I should go to school and I was glad to go to school. There was only\none other person who could go to school because the school was, of course,\nalready...uh...high school and you had to know French 1n order to go to school. And the other\nchildren did not know, except one boy. So the boy was____, and I...we went to school. And\nwe went to school each day so I don't really know what happened 1n the little house during\nthe day. I only know that in the evening when I came home I tried to teach them some\nFrench. I tried to sing songs with them. I...uh...tried to console, and then after our meal...well\nour meal consisted of a soup and a piece of bread, essentially, I had to study a lot. So I\nstudied til Il o'clock at night. Then I got up at 6 o'clock in the morning to study some more\nbefore I went to school. And...uh...went to school with...uh...Jon.",
        "Q: How long were you there?",
        "A: This...I...I started...uh...uh...school in September and...uh..1n November, I got a letter from\nmy father saying, \"Drop everything. We have an American visa. And come to Lyon\ntomorrow.\" And...uh...that was it. I...l was flabbergasted. I was...uh...torn...uh...I felt I am\nbetraying my little comrades. I was leaving them at the peak...I...I had realized that the...that\nwe were in hiding more or less and...uh...I.... was torn to go, but I mean I could not leave my\nfather's letter...uh...unanswered and he had already, of course, left his village, so he expected\nme to be in Lyon. And so I prepared to leave. And when I prepared to leave, the children\ntook me to the railroad station and it started snowing and the children went home and I\nwaited for the train and the train never came. And I got frantic. It was afternoon and I still\ncouldn't leave. And I was all by myself and I...uh... decided I had to...to walk to Lyon.\nAnd...uh...I left the place and...uh...about an hour later, I was lost. Completely lost!\nThe...uh...snow had turned into a tremendous snow storm. I...I was first in the snow up to my\nankles and then it became higher and higher and I got stuck til up to my knees and at one\npoint, I thought that was it. I am not going to make it either back or forth, and I remember\njust putting my head on the snow and sort of giving up and...uh...then 1t was so cold that I\nhad to move. And I started running again. Somehow I got out of it. Somehow I got into\nsomeplace where the...where people...and somehow I got into the train to Lyon. I can't\nremember exactly how. And I was...uh...I was...uh... That's the reason I can't remember much\nof this because I was in total shock. And...uh...when I came to Lyon, I don't remember how I\nmet my parents anymore. I...I was so totally shocked. Uh...My father must have gotten a visa\nthere and I must have gotten a visa there, but I don't remember anything. And...uh...I\nremember then my father and...my brother wasn't with us because he was still in a camp.\nAnd he joined us in Marseilles and I am beginning slightly to remember from that part on\nwhen we were in Marseilles...uh...my father received a letter from the Committee that we\nshould go to the Condemill to await permission to leave France. We had the America visa.\nThis visa, I must add how we got it. It...1t was a miracle almost because only a thousand\npeople got visas from the United States at this time. They was...this was a special action\nby...uh...President Roosevelt and the Refugee Committee headed by Varian Fry\nwho...uh...wanted to save European intellectuals. And they, because my father was on the\nblack list and he was a writer, they gave him this chance and gave him and his family\nanother chance to come to America. And...uh...(Pause) But we didn't have a permission to\nleave the country yet. That was another hurdle to overcome. So we were told to go to await\nthe official permission in the Condemill. And...uh...My father said, \"No. I shall not go to any\ncamp even if I have to starve.\" And so we did not go to the Condemill. We did starve, and\nwe stayed in Marseilles and...uh...things dragged on and dragged on and dragged on\nand...uh...my father became very impatient. And one day he said to us, \"We are leaving.\" It\nhappened to have been the 7th of December 1941. And we took the train from Marseilles to\nthe...to the Spanish border where we got out of the train. We went across the border with our\nAmerican visa, but not the permission. And at that particular point the border was closed, but\nwe were already on the Spanish side. So we couldn't be sent back because the border was\nclosed so we were in Spain, and the Spanish had no objections because they knew we were\nnot going to stay in Spain and...uh...uh... we had...we took a ticket...we had 50 dollars on us\nfor the four of us. My brother had joined me I think I had mentioned that. For the four of us\nwe had 50 dollars. We took the 4th class ticket to go to...uh...Portugal. And...uh...was a long\nride. When we came to Barcelona...uh...my father said, \"Let's get out of the train. I know\nsomebody in Barcelona.\" So we all left the train in Barcelona. But it wasn't...I guess they\nweren't too much afraid because we had the American visa. And then we traveled to Lisbon.",
        "Q: Go on.",
        "A: Go on? (Chuckle) Again, I mean you had to live from day to day. There was no money so\nwe went to a Committee and...uh... they helped us. They were very kind. And we stayed...of\ncourse, it was not, as I mentioned before, the war had started. Pearl Harbor and...uh...uh...the\nGermans started...uh...mining the Atlantic Ocean. The boats did not want to cross anymore\nthrough the United States. It was not easy to pursue the plans to go to America. Finally, we\ndid get...uh...a passage on the Niasa, and the Niasa did not go directly from Lisbon to New\nYork, but went first to Cuba. And, of course, we wanted to see my grandparents but we\nweren't allowed to get off the boat at all. And my grandparents never knew that we had\nlanded in Cuba. And...uh...from Cuba we went to the Bermuda's, at which point we learned\nthat the Niasa was full of spies and that we're not going to be able to pursue our voyage\nand...uh...the police came on board and they interviewed everybody for hours, found the\nSpies, arrested the spies, and we then were allowed to...to go to America. However, they did\nnot want us to go to New York, and we landed in Virginia Beach. And...uh...the American\nauthorities came on board, again screened everybody on board and then we got permission\nto...to leave. We were guided from the boat, blindfolded to a train that was also blinded...\nhad... uh...the windows were blinded. Uh...And we were given seats and we were not\nallowed to move from there, and the trains started to go to New York, but we were afraid. I\nmean we were in America, and the first thing we got was...uh...sandwiches. We had never\nseen such white bread in years and we were extremely relieved and I mean...uh...you cannot\ndescribe the feeling. It's impossible. It's...it's a feeling that you can only have once in a\nlifetime. We arrived in New York, Pennsylvania Station. I don't think a lot of immigrants did\nthat. Uh...I think it's 32nd or 34th Street. We arrived and here you were and then where did\nyou go? Right? So...uh...we...we decided we have to disburse because we didn't have any\nmoney to go to a hotel or anything like that. And...uh...so my...we all had friends and I went\nto some friends I had and I happened to be on 86th Street, West Side. So I walked from 34 to\n86th Street because it's very easy to find your way in New York, and I rang the bell and\n(laughter) I said, \"Here I am. Will you take me in?\" And they did. I imagine my father and\nmy mother and my brother had the same kind of experience. I came in. They took me tn.\nThey were very, very kind. And I fell sick. Immediately! Immediately fell sick. My...And\nthe first thing I did was, when I got better, I went to Julie Richmond High School, and\ninscribed myself and they were very, very kind. I knew two words of English. And if I say\nthem to you you will laugh. They are: cheek to cheek.\" (Laughter) Because one of the\nFred Astaire songs of that time...Now I know it was \"Together Dancing Cheek to Cheek.\"\nAnd that was the only two words, is cheek and to...uh...that I knew. I don't think I knew what\nit was. (Laughter) Uh...But I went to high school and I said I would like to go to school and\nthey said, \"Fine.\" But they, of course, noticed that I couldn't speak a word of English so they\nsent me to the French teacher in order to sort me out. It so happened that the French teacher\ndid not speak any French. She came from Spain. And I didn't know any Spanish so that\ndidn't work. And...uh...after awhile, I found a very, very wonderful English teacher who\nunderstood the...my difficulties, and...uh...she explained it to the others and so I was...uh...put\ninto...uh...into two classes at once so I would advance quickly and...uh...didn't take me long.\nI learned English and...uh...I graduated within the same year from high school. And...uh...I\nlived first with a family that needed a babysitter and I took care of the baby after I came\nhome from school and then later when my father made...could afford it and we had an\napartment, I moved in with my parents. My father, of course, joined immediately a group\nof...uh...people who...to help other refugees and...uh...he also got himself an agent and he\ncontacted the Free French. I contacted the Free French too, but they thought I was too young\nto be of any help. I didn't think so and I...today I... don't know why they didn't let me join\nthem. Uh...I was very eager to...to help the war effort. At the same time, my brother was\nrecruited into the Army and he did...he became...uh...American soldier and...uh...after basic\ntraining, he was sent overseas and he died in France on the last year of the war in the\nFrench...in the American army. And...uh...well, I thought I should make my contribution, but\nI guess...uh...I...I wasn't able to...to join any group that went on combat. I continued school.\nAfter graduation from high school, I entered Hunter College of the City of New York. At\nthat time it was not...uh...evident to get into Hunter College. You had to pass a very stiff\nexam. And...uh...I...to this day, I don't know how I managed to pass this exam, but I did. I\nwas accepted in Hunter College and there the French teacher spoke French. (Laughter) He\nwas , and only a few weeks after I...I...uh...joined the Hunter College. He went and\njoined the Free French and went back to France.",
        "Q: What happened after...very briefly, after you finished college? What did you do?",
        "A: Uh...After I finished college, still in the last year of college, I heard that Ernest Koenig had\nsurvived the war. He had looked for me via his brother. In England, his brother had written\nto somebody in New York who must have looked up the telephone book or something.\nAnyway, I was found. I was contacted by Ernest Koenig, and...uh..we decided to see each\nother again. And so my...upon graduation, I was only intend to earn enough money to pay a\nticket over to Europe and visit Ernest. So, upon graduation, I looked for a job. And I\nlooked...I was at that point also I had done the Art Students League. I didn't mention that. I\ndidn't only go to college. I went to the Arts too. I must say after my brother died, I was\ncrushed and I didn't want to go to...to see anybody or stay...stay anymore in my old\nenvironment so I went...I left...uh...college. I went to evening college to...in order to finish\nthe...the year and I went to arts school in the day time, to Art Students League.\nAnd...uh...when I graduated I...uh...I...uh...I graduated in arts. And I looked for jobs in art.\nAnd as you know, jobs in art after graduation are not easy to find unless you are ready to\ndo...uh...serial kinds of jobs, like in cartoons or that kind of thing I was offered, but I didn't\nwant to do that. So one day, I...uh...I went to the public library to get out a book and there\nwas a big advertisement for somebody with my language skills. I went in. I got the job, and I\nbecame a librarian.",
        "Q: When did you see Ernest again?",
        "A: Uh...I...after a few months on my job, I had enough money. I asked for permission if I could\ngo to Europe and they gave it to me for a week, I wanted to go. My...L...also...Ermest, by that\ntime, had lived in London and my grandmother was in London also. So very officially, I\nvisited my grandmother. And my father came with me to visit his mother, so my father and I\nwent to London, and I met Ernest at the Picadilly...uh...subway station. Uh...And...uh...we\ndecided to get married next week. (Laughter) That was it.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay. Elizabeth, thank you very much. I would like... would like to go just for 1\nminute if we can, back to LeChambon. Uh... You were teaching in the school. Uh...Can you\ntell me something about the kids, the children that you taught, that you were helping out with\nin this school?",
        "A: No. I wasn't teaching.",
        "Q: No. You were helping with them.",
        "A: No. I wasn't teaching at all. The...1t was helping them psychologically more than anything\nelse. The children were very disturbed and they were treated as a bunch and not as\nindividuals. They were not...they were the children that came from Gurs, but that wasn't so.\nEach child had a different individual story, and nobody listened to them. So what I really did\nis I...1 helped them tell me their stories. I mean I allowed them to...to...to tell their stories,\ntheir griefs, their...their unhappiness. They cried at night. They had nightmares. One of the\nchildren wet herself every night. But that wasn't known in the village. That wasn't known at\nall. We kept that to ourselves.",
        "Q: It sounds like you were very close.",
        "A: We were very, very close. We were like sisters and brothers with the boys too. The\nboys...L.... am speaking now about the girls because I was in the girls' room, but I felt for the\nboys like if they were my brothers, just as much. Especially for the teenage boys. They were\nso hungry. They...they were howling like wolves, and people didn't understand why. They\nwere hungry. They were lonesome. And...uh...I...I especially remember some of the\nboys...uh...well, you would call it, stole a potato and he was punished for it. And I was\ndevastated because he was...he was not responsible. His body needed it. We...we were so\nclose...uh...[...1n France at that time, you got...uh...you got...uh...a special allowance for\nchildren for chocolate and sugar. Up to 16 years, you got chocolate and sugar. And I\ncollected my chocolate and sugar and I didn't have a chance to say this, but in the meantime\nErnest was in a concentration camp, and I took that...and sent it in to the concentration camp\nand that was one of the reasons I didn't want to leave Europe. I felt if I didn't send my sugar\nhe would...he would not survive. So...uh...I have a letter...I think I may still have it...where\nthe children tell me, \"We will not forget Ernest. We will send him sugar.\" They had nothing\nthemselves. But we were very close. Very close!",
        "Q: Did the people from the town come into the school to try to help at all? Was there any\ncontact between your children and the town?",
        "A: I don't think so. No. I don't think so. No.",
        "Q: Alright.",
        "A: No. Uh...Maybe later. At this particular point, 1t was just being established, you see. The\nmain thing I think was the...uh...worry. Where's the money going to come from to support\nus? And that was...uh...Pastor Trocme's money and it...I must say, we were\nsupported...uh...wonderfully by the American Quakers and by the...uh... . They gave\nthe money. Those two organizations. If it weren't for the American Quakers and the\n_, they could not have had enough money to establish the house.",

        "A: My name is Elizabeth Koenig. I was born in Vienna, Austria, on March 7, 1924.",

        "A: We lived in a very large apartment. My parents were very lively, had a very\nlively...uh...environment. I was...uh...taken care of by a nurse maid. Uh...We had a lot of\ncompany. My parents went to the theater, to the...to the opera, to concerts, and I started to go\nto the theatre very early in my life.",
        "A: I learned how to read when I was...uh...4 years old. And I read a lot. And I walked a lot. We\nwent in parks. Uh...I played with my little friends. I went to art school. Uh...It was called\nCzisek Art School, and it was specially for little children.",
        "A: I can't really answer this question in general. I can only answer this for my family. Uh...We\nwere culturally contingeous Jews, but we did not practice any religious rites, and we didn't\ngo...have Jewish holidays. I went...from the time on I went to school, I had religion in\nschool. I learned about the Bible, and I learned how to read Hebrew. Uh...And I went...I was\nonce in a play...uh...when I was about 7 years old, and...uh...1t was about Esther. (Long\nPause)",
        "A: Yes. At that time, we...my father had moved his family: my brother, myself, and my mother\nto Berlin. He was editor of the newspaper in Berlin, and when the Nazis came to power, we\nlived in..in the capital of Germany. He was very...uh... endangered because he\nwas...uh...uh...on the Nazi blacklist as a liberal writer and journalist.",
        "A: Well, I didn't know that at the time. My parents didn't tell me. Uh...I only knew that we\npacked in a hurry and left Berlin as soon as possible which was easy for us because we had\nAustrian passports. And...uh...the laws about German Jews did not apply to us. So we went\nback to Vienna. Uh...My father had lost his job. Uh...And so we had to...our life became very\nrestricted from that time on. We lived with my grandparents. My grandfather was a\npediatrician. Uh...My mother's...that's my mother's father. My father's father had died. He\nhad been a lawyer.",

Uh...He was...uh... he resented the...uh...anti-Semitism in...1n\n...1n Austria. Uh...It was undercover, but it was there and so after he tried very hard to with\nall kinds of various jobs, he decided he's going to leave Austria and he went to Prague to\nestablish himself there. So when the Nazis came to Austria, our family was separated. My\nfather was in Prague, and my mother and my brother and I were in Vienna.",
        "A: Uh...At this point, of course,...uh...everybody was very worried, and...uh..my father wanted\nus to come to Prague, but it was too late. Somehow, I cannot give you the details, but we\ndidn't get permission and we didn't get permission to go anyplace. My mother tried\neverywhere, and my father was frantic and he...he suggested that we meet in Addis Ababa or\nin Martinque just so that we could be reunited again. And then finally he got a visa from\nPrague to...uh...France, and he moved from...to France, hoping that that he would have it\neasier to have his family follow, but it turned out that the French did not...uh..permit us to\ncome. And...uh...uh...so one day...uh...my father just said...In the meantime, the Nazi laws\napplied to Austria, and...uh...my father recognized the danger, and...uh...said we had...just\nhad to leave at all cost. And...uh...we...uh...we took a bus from Baden Baden in Germany that\nmade an excursion into France, Strasbourg, then came back to Baden Baden, and we\nintended to leave the bus in Strasbourg, but we were very foolish because...uh...we didn't\ntake much but we had one piece of luggage for the three of us. And, of course, when we\ncame across the border that piece of luggage was...uh...discovered, and...uh...people asked,\n\"Whose luggage is it?\" And we said, \"It's ours,\" and then they they said, \"You...you weren't\ngoing to visit the Cathedral of Strasbourg. You were going to come illegally to France and\nthey stamped our passport and sent us back to Germany. And...uh...my father said to my\nmother, you have to try again, and we went to...uh...we went to...uh...uh... Can you cut it off\nplease?",
        "A: Yes. I...We went to Saarbrucken and...uh...wanted to go to France from Saabricken, and this\nwas already the...the...this was the days of the Munich Acccord, and you could feel the\ntension in both countries and the...the troops on the frontiers and when we came to\nthe...uh...railroad station, there was an SS man and he said, \"I know what you want. You\nwant to go illegally to France. You won't make it.\" And my mother said, \"Let us try it.\"\nAnd he said, \"Okay, I'll let you try it, but 1f you come back you will be sent to Dachau.\" And\nSO we went over without a visa to France, and, of course, we were caught. There were more\npolice in France than ever. And we were caught and we were put into prison, and then we\nwere put back on the train again and when we arrived the next day it was, I think, at the\nstation in Forbach....No. Excuse me....at the station in Saarbrucken, the same SS man was\nthere and he...it was like... He smiled like I told you so. And then we were put into separate\nrooms and we were... I don't know what happened exactly to my mother and my brother. I\nknow they were beaten. I know I was stripped completely and a little...little beaten.\nAnd...uh...then I was...we were released and we were thinking now we are on our way to\nDachau. And I can't explain it but somehow they gave us an opportunity to escape and we\nran and we escaped. And...uh...We found ourselves together again outside the railroad station\nand...uh...my mother contacted my father in Paris and he said, \"Go to Cologne and try to get\na visa from the Consul there. I am going to contact him and I hope he will give you the visa.\"\nAnd my mother went to with us to Cologne, but the Consul did not give her a visa. He...I\nwasn't with my mother so I don't know exactly what happened. We were...uh...waiting for\nher. When she came back, she was crushed, completely...completely crushed. She was a\nchanged person. She...At this...by this time, of course, you realize we had been...uh...always\nin the same clothes and had not changed and...uh...had not had the opportunity to...uh...have\nany... uh...semblance of human life. And...uh...she was completely...she dissolved and...and\nshe decided we had to go back to Vienna. This was the only way we could survive.\nAnd...uh...She went 1n this state in the middle...she didn't want to show it to us, I think,\nhow...how desperate she was. And so she went to...to sit on a...a...1n a little place in Cologne\nin the middle of Cologne and I only know by her story what happened. I didn't see it.\nUh...uh...Secretary from the...uh...Embassy arrived and asked her, \"Aren't you the lady that\nwanted the visa?\" And she said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"Well, do you have any jewelry?\"\nAnd she said, \"Yes.\" And he said, \"Well, maybe we can do something.\" And so she traded\nall her jewelry and got three visas, and we were on our way to the airport before you could\nsay anything and we...uh...arrived in Paris and my father was there and I think I'll never\nforget walking into the airport in Paris into freedom. And...uh...my father took us to a little\nhotel and we...uh...we stayed there...uh...1n the middle of town and I remember being\nvery...uh...hungry all the time because we had very little to...money. My father had...had no\njob and...but soon after that, he...uh...managed to make a newspaper, a newsletter, not a\nnewspaper, a newsletter. He wrote it all himself, a little bit like the Kiplinger Newsletter,\nabout economic situation in Western Europe and...uh...he got people to subscribe to it and he\nhad a...uh...multiplication machine and...uh...he...he sent out his newsletter. I...I...I did the\ntechnical part, the photocopying and making of the newspaper, and we were able to live\nfrom his income and soon we had...uh...a little apartment and...uh...my brother went to\nschool and...uh...everything seemed...uh...to pick up except that we were very worried about\nour family that we had left behind. My father...my grandfather....uh...was...because he was a\ndoctor was not allowed to leave. He was under strict orders to stay in Vienna and take care of\nthe sick.

My other\ngrandmother...uh..lived with...uh...my father's brother and they tried to go to England, and\nmy mother's sister...uh...her husband was actually put into Dachau concentration camp on...\non Kristallnacht.

And...uh...he...he at this time, he was a student in Paris,\nand he liked to come to our house and discuss politics with my father. And...uh...when the\nwar was declared, I would...I have to add something that is more general now because our\nsituation in...1n France was ambiguous for the French because we were Austrians, and\nAustrians were Germans. So we were part of the enemy. On the other hand, they did\nunderstand vaguely that anti-Nazis could not really be an enemy, so it was very difficult for\nthem to apply enemy laws to these types of refugees that came to France. But...and it\ndepended actually on the individual...how he interpreted the laws. So when the...uh...war was\ndeclared on September, the 3rd, 1940...No...Excuse me...1939...uh...

The...the women were left outside so my mother and I stayed in Paris.\nUh...The Czech student, whose name is Ernest, engaged himself into the Czech army\nthat...the Czech army in exile, and he...we were all wanting to help the war effort to fight the\nNazis.

You were a nurse maid. But you didn't do babysitting\nin the evenings like you do it in America. And I didn't want to give up school, so...uh... I had\njust a few occupations, a few times that I could earn money and I tried by all means to do it,\nbut it was very difficult. We lived from day to day. That's the answer.

        "A: Yes. And...uh...meantime, we went visiting my...I went visiting my brother once. I couldn't\nvisit my father, but he was released from camp. My brother was...uh...not released, and he\nwas released from camp. I don't know why.",
        "A: Well, I...that...that is why I got a bicycle. I had to...I wanted to visit my brother\nand...uh...somebody was selling a bicycle and so I figured 1t would be much less if I bought a\nbicycle and go instead of taking the train. So I bought this bicycle, which I named\nBarthalemus, and I went to see my brother. And I got permission. It was very rare that\npeople got permission to visit. And I was very happy to do this. I was very happy to see my\nbrother.",
        "A: No. My...my father was released, maybe because of his age? I don't really know why.",
        "A: Oh, it...one day he appeared. It was completely unexpected. He appeared and we just...1t was\nlike...like sunshine coming back. (Laughter) It was great, and I remember all he wanted is to\ntake a bath...uh, read his newspaper, and have a good meal.",
        "A: And then...uh...he didn't stay long. My father didn't stay long because he had to engage\nhimself in to what was called Camp de Prestataire which was part of the French Army unit\nactually.\nIt was the same thing as a concentration camp, only it was called Prestataire, and the other\ndifference is...1s then we got...uh...a little compensation from the French government for his\nbeing...uh...engaged so to speak as a Prestataire. It was ...uh....1t was not any more a prisoner.\nIt was...uh...you were engaged in taking part in the war effort.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Uh...Well, things got worse when...uh...things got worse for France.",
        "A: Uh...We had...we had...uh...the Germans advanced. In the beginning, it was called the Drole\nde Guerre because nothing happened. And then in...in the springtime, the Germans advanced\nand...uh...the unexpected happened. They weren't...they weren't....they were victorious.\nNobody had imagined that. They conquered Belgium. They conquered Northern France.\nAnd...uh..we couldn't believe it. At one point, you could hear the...the cannons\nand...uh...and...uh...the...the streets and everything in Paris were dark...of course, darkened,\nand you could hear the bombs. And it was frightening, and people started running away.\nMost of the French people had a place in the...1n Southern France somewhere and or\ngrandparents and knew where to go, but people like us didn't know where to go, so we\ncouldn't make any plans, but also we couldn't make any plans because the police did not let\nus travel. And...uh...we were told by our conciege that we should not even think of leaving\nour apartment in Paris, because she would...uh...notify the police. And...uh..so we were\nunder...under observation, and we didn't know what to do. In the end, when the pressure\nbecame so...I mean...by pressure, I mean we realized the Germans are going to be in Paris in\n2 days. Uh...We decided we are going to leave. And...uh...we didn't know where my brother\nwere...was, and nor where my father was. Uh...We...we assumed that my father\nwas...uh...somewhere fighting perhaps or in the work camp, and my brother equally\nand...uh...but we didn't know where they were, and we didn't know where to go and we had\nno means of going any place except the bicycle. So we decided the following: My mother\nwould go on foot. She would make auto stop, and I would follow her wherever she would\ngo. And...uh...so I wouldn't have a...a destination except the destination where the car that\nwould accept her would take her. That would be my destiny and our destiny. And it...we...we\ndidn't imagine the difficulty of carrying out this plan, but we went to the Port d'Orleans in the\nsouth of Paris, which was uh...group. already filled with people leaving and it's very difficult\nto even recognize the layout. And...uh...But quickly I got a...a car for my mother. I...My\nmother was too shy to do the auto stopping herself, and...uh...so I did it for her. And then I\nput her into the car, and then I quickly asked the driver where he was going as he rolled\naway, and he said, Rambouillet and so I took my bicycle and all I knew is...was my mother\nwas on the way to Rambouillet. And as I bicycled I realized I don't know where in\nRambouillet I am going to meet her. Also there were more than one road to go to\nRambouillet, so she could be in the north, or east or west of Rambouillet. Fortunately, by\nalmost a miracle I found her at the entrance of Rambouillet. I was looking at every car and I\ncan't tell you today how come I found her. I found her. It's not very far from Paris.\nAnd...uh...We stayed the night there at a very poor woman's house who was\nvery...uh...uh...to whom we were very thankful for taking us in. We slept at her house and the\nnext day, the voyage started all over again. But we had learned to be a little more precise\nabout our destination. So we said when the...the next person says where he is going, we will\nmeet at the Marie, at the city hall of this particular village, because every village in France\nhas a city hall. So the next time, I...uh...I think it was...we went to Chauteaudun, and then we\nmet in Chauteaudun. And it was at the city hall and again we were very lucky. We met\nsomebody who offered us...uh...a...a place in his house to sleep. And the next day, my\nmother...we went to...oh, I think...no, the next... Excuse me, I...I think I am mixing it up. The\nnext day we went to Chatres, and there's a... Yes. And somehow I went much faster than my\nmother because of the....the roads were all clogged with people and...uh...the bicycle could\ngo in and out and the...the cars were stuck. So, I arrived at...uh...Chatres earlier than my\nmother and...uh...I waited for her. And then...as she came, at the moment she came, there\nwas...uh...uh...bombing attack, and we had to run into the shelter. And I remember taking my\nmother's hand and leaving the bicycle outside and taking my mother's hand and running into\nthe shelter. And when we came out of the shelter 2, 3 hours later, there was two policemen\nstanding next to my bicycle and they said, \"Is this your bicycle?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" And\nthey said, \"You're a German spy.\" And I said, \"I am not a German spy.\" And they said,\n\"What's this?\" And showed me..in my...I had taken along in my...my musette, I had taken\nalong Ernest's passport. I had taken along Goethe's Faust, and I had...and something else that\nindicated to them that I am...I had some German origins and they arrested my mother and\nmyself and put us in jail. And...uh...I couldn't believe it. I said, \"What...what are you doing?\nI mean I...We're just trying to flee from the Germans, and you say I am a German spy.\" I\ncouldn't believe it, but they didn't listen. And...uh...somehow...uh...at 5 o'clock in the\nmorning, they opened the cell and they said, \"The Germans are coming. The Germans are\ncoming. Run away.\" And I took my mother, and we ran away, literally. I even found my\nbicycle, and...uh...then we went to Chateaudun. And then from Chateaudun, the next\nday...we...the next day we...we said we are going to Blois if possible because we were\ndepending on...we couldn't say at anytime where we wanted to go, only where....where we\ncould go. Right? So, I...when my mother got into a car, this car went to Vendome. So I was\nsupposed to meet her in Vendome and I came to Vendome. And at that time the...the roads\nwere clear and I expected my mother to be in Vendome before me because with a bicycle\nyou go slower than with a car, but she wasn't there. And I was worried and...uh...but I didn't\nhave much time for worrying because a bombardment started again and...uh... a man came to\nme and said you have to...to leave where you are in front of the...uh...city hall to go and go\ninto shelter. And I said, \"I can't go into shelter. I am waiting for my mother.\" He said, \"You\ncan't stay here. It's not allowed. You have to go into the shelter.\" So I put a big piece of\npaper with my mother's name and telling her that I was in the shelter, and then I went to the\nshelter. And when I came out of the shelter, the piece of paper was gone and my mother\nwasn't there. So I couldn't understand anything, and I was pretty upset because my mother\nperhaps had seen it, but she hadn't come to the shelter or she hadn't waited for me. What was\nI supposed to do? She wasn't there. And the Germans were going to come. So in my being\nso upset, I...uh...looked at the....I1 don't think I had a map, but I must have looked at\nsomething that shown me that the camp of my father was only 3 or 4 miles away from where\nI was. So I decided that I'm going to see if I cannot find my father and then come back to this\nplace in Vendome. Or go to Blois where we said we would be together this evening. So I left\na note again at the Marie saying that I am on the way to look for my father. If it is late, I will\ngo back to Blois and find her at the Marie in Blois. And when I came to the place where my\nfather was supposed to be, there was...the camp was empty. And I found one officer there\nwho packed his luggage and he said Yes, your father was here about 4 hours ago. He...he\nwent with his...uh...group. Uh...He went into this and this direction, and you probably can\ncatch them if you bicycle fast. So I was torn between trying to find my father and going to\nBlois as I had promised my mother. And I thought I would find my father for sure, but I\nwouldn't find my mother perhaps. Perhaps I wouldn't find my mother. And so I decided to go\nto where my father was. And I bicycled and bicycled and bicycled and then finally, I realized\nI was bicycling...bicycling in the wrong direction toward the Germans and...uh...after I had\nbicycled for 4 hours and not found my father.... I don't know whether I had gotten the wrong\ndirections or whether I...I can't...I can't say what went wrong there. Anyway after 4 hours\nbicycling, I was at the end of my physical possibilities. And I propped myself against a tree\nand...and passed out. And then when I came to myself, I was surrounded by four Belgian\nsoldiers who gave me sugar and fed me sugar and then I woke up and...uh...they\nsaid...uh...you'll have to move from here. The Germans are coming instantly. And I said, \"I\nam looking for my father. I have to go to this other direction.\" They said, \"No. Your...your\nfather is not there. Your father couldn't be there.\" Then I said, \"Okay, then I go to Blois and\nfind my mother. And they said, \"Okay. We go with you.\" And we took the road and went to\nBlois, and as we came to Blois, the policeman said, \"You cannot cross the bridge anymore.\nWe are going to blow it up.\" And I was on the other side of the Loire, the city hall was on\nthe side of the bridge they were going. In other words, I couldn't go to the city hall anymore.\nAnd...uh...I...[...[ nearly threw myself on the bridge, but they took me off and...uh...they said,\n\"You can't do this. You can't go across.\" I said, \"I have to find my mother.\" And they said,\n\"Your mother is not there, because we are going to blow this whole thing up.\" And so I...this\nis why I lost my mother too. And...uh...they blew up the bridge. The...the bombs rained\ndown. The whole thing looked like in a...looked so surrealistic. The fire, the bombs, the\neverything. And...uh...I was lost. And...uh...I went to the...uh...to a barn and...uh...cried, and\nthat was it. And then the...the Belgian soldier said, \"If you want to go, you could go down\nsouth of France with us. We are going down there.\" So I said, \"Fine. I'll join you.\" And this\nwas very lucky for me, because they were very...uh...dependable fellows and I had learned in\nthe meantime that to go with four fellows was safer than to go with one. And...uh...we...this\nmust have been....I don't know what day this was anymore, but any...anyway, we went to\nthis...toward the south and bicycled and bicycled. And one day...uh...where we stayed\novernight... We...we fed ourselves by taking things from...uh...the fields actually.\nAnd...uh...the...the boys were very inventive about this and they always found something to\neat. And...uh...uh...at...at one time, however, we went to...uh...Centre..how do you say?",
        "A: No, not hospital. Uh...where they...they took in refugees and...uh...we went to this Centre\nd'Accueil and in the Centre d'Accueil was a young man.... I...everywhere I went, I asked\nabout my father, mother, and brother if anybody had seen them. And I also asked in the\nCentre d'Accuiel whether anybody had seen anybody of my family and somebody said\nfrom the description, they think they know my brother. And so where he was last seen a few\ndays ago in Toulouse. So, I said, \"I have to go and find my brother.\" And I said goodbye to\nthe boys and...uh...took off for Toulouse the next morning and bicycled as fast as I could to\nToulouse. And...uh...I arrived in Toulouse at noon...noon, before noon and I went to the\nCentre d'Accueil in Toulouse and I realized that Toulouse was a big city. It wasn't like a little\nvillage. It was already before the war...I mean...yes, before the war it was a million people.\nAnd at this particular time...uh...the refugees came all from the north, not only Belgium or\nLuxembourg, but all the French people and they had...and the city of Toulouse was swelled\nto two million people. And they had this Centre d'Accueil to take care of them...uh...take care\nof them is a euphemism...uh... It...1t was dreadful. There were murders and rapes and a\nterrible place. But what could you do? Where would you stay otherwise? And...uh...so I\nwent to this place and I inquired where I would find my brother. And at every meal I went up\nand I said, \"Is there anybody who knows my brother?\" And I couldn't find him so. So I was\npretty desperate by the evening. I went to the middle of the city and...uh...the middle of the\ncity was quite different. There were lots of people, and some people had enough money to go\nto restaurants and cafe houses, so I looked into the cafe houses and I found actually people I\nknew...uh...from Paris and...uh...but I didn't find my brother. And I was very, very\ndiscouraged because I had to go back to this awful place and as I walked down to go\nto...back to the Centre d'Assueil, I went through a little street and at the end of the street there\nwas my brother and he sold newspapers. And that's how I found my brother. He was there.\nI...I...1t was...I don't know. I can't say I mean how it happened. It was there. He was there.\nAnd, of course, we were both very happy and...uh...he...uh...he had a girlfriend with whom\nhe lived and he said he would meet me the next day at the...uh...post office and then we\nwould discuss what we would do together and we would rearrange everything what we\nwould do. And so the next day at 10 o'clock I came to the post office and...uh...I was\nimpatient. He didn't come right away, so because he was...I was impatient I went to\nthe...uh...one of the counters, one of the...where you sell things. What do you call it?",
        "A: No. No. No. In the post office",
        "A: Yes.\nknow if this is here too. There is no such a thing where they keep the...uh...letters or for other\npeople, and you go. You identify yourself and you can pick up your mail that way. And so I\nwent to one of the windows and I asked, \"Do you have any letter for...for me?\" And they\nsaid, \"Yes.\" And I certainly hadn't expected anybody write me a letter because nobody knew\nI was in Toulouse. Nobody on earth knew that on that day I was going to be Toulouse. And\nthere was a letter! And I looked at it. It was from my mother. And she...that letter...1t was a\nvery short, little letter saying...uh..Elizabeth, if you get this letter, I am in Baucus, and I am\nwaiting for you. And so when I...my father...my brother came to the post office, I gave him\nthe letter. I said, \"Look here. I found my mommy and your mommy.\" And we were so\nhappy. And so...so I said, \"Immediately, I will go and find here.\" The letter was already 10\ndays old, so I was afraid she would not be there anymore. So I...uh...said to my brother,\n\"You'll hear from me when I find my mother.\" And I went to the train station with my\nbicycle. I had only enough money to go to Pau and from there on, I had to take my bicycle\nagain and bicycle to where my mother was which was close to the Spanish frontier. And I\ntook the train to Pau and took out my bicycle, and as I was in the railroad station, I saw a...a\nlittle man who was in a similar uniform as my father had when I...uh..he went into the\nPrestataire. And since I recognized the uniform, I went to him and I said...no, I went to\nhim...he... I heard him shout in German, and I went to him and I...I realized that he only\nspoke German and he...I said to him something about my father and he was very rude. He\nsaid, \"I don't want to speak about anything. I want to find my wife.\" And he...he was rude to\neverybody. So I said to him, \"This isn't anyway you are going to find your wife. I can help\nyou because I speak French. I'll help you.\" So, it turned out that his wife was in Gurs, in the\nconcentration camp in Gurs and he was looking for her. I found out how he could find...go to\nGurs from Pau, and told him exactly which train to go. In fact, went with him to the train, set\nhim into a compartment, and then I said, \"Have you ever seen my father because you have\nthe same kind of a uniform?\" And he said, \"Yes. Yesterday.\" And he...I said, \"My\ngoodness, as the train was already starting to roll. \"Please tell me where it was?\" And he\nsaid, it was in...near of Limoges.\" I said, \"Exactly where it was?\" So shouting out of the\nwindow, he gave me the telephone number I could call. And...uh...he departed. And...uh...I\nwas flabbergasted, of course, as you can imagine. I took my bicycle and just as I went to\nToulouse, I went to Barcus to find my mother. And when I came to Barcus, it wasn't as I had\nimagined either. It was a very, long drawn out village. I didn't know exactly where my\nmother was, but I...and I went to the first cafe and asked them if they would know my\nmother. And at that point I realized that everybody in the village knew I had been lost\nbecause my mother thought I had been killed in the...uh...bombardment in Blois Just as\nmuch as I had been desperate for her, she has...had been desperate for me. She did not think I\nhad survived it, and she had told everybody that she mourned her daughter. And so when I\ncame to this little village, everybody looked at me as if I were a ghost. And they told me\nwhere my mother was and I came into her little house where she lived in a peasant hut. And,\nalso, a moment I will never forget in my life, my mother looked at me like coming back from\nthe dead. And here I was, and here was my mother. And not only could I tell my mother\nand...and...uh...embrace my mother and kiss her and...but I was able to tell her, \"I know\nwhere my brother is. I know where my father 1s.\"\nTape #2",
        "A: The story of the letter? All right. While I was Toulouse, I wrote a letter to...uh...a friend of\nErnest in Switzerland, saying that I was alive and...and if he would know where Ernest is to\nwrite me a letter poste restante in Toulouse. Okay. I come now back to...to my\nmother...mother's meeting. Uh...We, of course...there was only one thing to do 1s to go back\nto Toulouse, see my brother, and go back to and find out if my father was where this man\nhad said he was. I had seen him. So we first went to the telephone booth and dialed this\nmagic number and...uh...we found my father and...uh...he came to the farm and...uh...it...1t\nwas incredible. Incredible! So, of course, he said, \"Come immediately.\" And...uh...so our\naim was... Yes, he was in Limoges, near Limoges, which was beyond Toulouse. So our aim\nwas to go to Toulouse and then from Toulouse to...to where he was. Okay? So that's what\nwe did. I...uh...1n parenthesis, I may say we took the train and...because...of course, because\nmy mother had no bicycle. We took the train and everything we owned was robbed in that\ntrain which included, unfortunately, our food cards...cards...and all identity cards. Everything\nwe still had was stolen in this train ride, which is terrible because when you don't have\nidentity cards and no food cards at this time, it's hard to exist. Well, I don't know what we did\nin..to...uh...get food at that point. I...I've forgotten. Uh...We arrived in Toulouse. It was a\nterrific reunion with my brother and...uh...we....my mother had a tiny bit of money from this\ncompensation of the French Government. That was...so we could pay for our fare. And we\nhad decided we are going then now to go to my father. My brother wanted to stay in\nToulouse and...uh...but before we went to take a train ticket to...to go my father's, I went to\nthe post office and there was a letter from...uh...Ernest's friend, saying that Ernest was very\nclose to where my mother had been. So I said to my mother, \"I am going to go and find\nErnest. Now that I know the way!\" (Chuckle) So my mother understood and she said, \"You\ngo ahead, and we meet at your father's.\" I rode down again, met Ernest, and he had\nbeen...uh...in this little place and my meeting with Ernest was also in the street. He didn't\nknow I was coming. I saw him walking tn the street and...uh...1t was also unbelievable.\nSo...and the next day, I convinced him to go with me to see my father. But he had not been\ndemobilized yet so he said, Okay, I think it's best if I go first to, I think, Tarbes, but I am not\nsure...uh...to get demobilized because then I also get a little money when I undemobilization,\nand then we can...I can take a train ticket and we don't have to go by bicycle and...and other\nstuff. And...uh...So he went to Tarbes, got a little money, and we went to see my father. And\nthen we lived with my father on my father's ration. My mother, Ernest and I, all three of us\non one ration and that couldn't last. So Ernest decided he's going to look for a job. But, of\ncourse, he wasn't allowed to work, so he had to...No, he wanted to be...Excuse me...He\nwanted to be a student actually and continue his studies, so he went to Grenoble and what\nhappened to him is another story, A very, very sad and long story. Uh...My mother and I, in\nthe meantime, stayed with my father, living off this soldier's ration, and...uh... If you ask how\nthis life was, it was very difficult, very very difficult. Uh... This village had no school, where\nI could go to. Uh...We had practically no place to sleep. Uh...Finally, we got...arranged\nfor..for a place where my mother and my father could stay in one room and I could stay in\nanother room. And...uh...I got acquainted with the library there, La bibliotheque, and...uh... I\nmust say I got as good an education from just reading one book after the other 1n the...in the\nbibliotheque ...uh... I read all of Romain Rolland, all of Baudelaire, of Maupassant...uh... Not\nbad! And...uh...uh...otherwise, we...the days were spent collecting...uh...uh...food such as\nberries and chataigne. What is it..uh...uh...uh... No. And...uh...just the daily life to...to wash\nyourself was quite a problem. We had...you had to go to a public bath and there...I don't think\nthere was any for women. It was difficult. And...uh...Well, main concern then was to find out\nwhere my grandparents were. And...uh...We couldn't get in touch with them. We couldn't\nfind them. And my...uh...that was more or less the daily task.",
        "A: And one day we received a letter from our...the lady who was my Latin teacher in Vienna,\nwho had gone into a village...uh...to become a German teacher, and she wrote me and my\nfather...parents a letter saying that as things do not look...uh...too well... In the meantime, of\ncourse...I digress. You excuse me. In the meantime, the Vichy\ngovernment...uh...persecute...started to persecute the foreigners and to persecute especially\nthe foreign Jews and we had to live...uh...not...uh...yet in hiding, but on the edge of society.\nAnd...uh...when the letter came, the teacher said that she would suggest that I come to where\nshe is, which is Le Chambon ____ and she would have a job for me. During the summer\ntime, I could take care of Pastor Trocme\u00e9's children and in the fall, I could go to school. So\nmy parents' decided this was a much better solution for their daughter and I wasn't very\nhappy to leave my parents, but I went to Le Chambon ___ and there I was received by\nPaster Trocm\u00e9 and...uh... I...my job was to take care of the children, to help in the household,\nand to do anything else that was necessary. And...uh...that's what I did.",
        "A: That wasn't the school.",
        "A: Yes. The main...the main thing was there were four...four children. The Trocme's had four\nchildren. One of them was only 2 years younger than I, so actually...uh...uh...that...uh...Nellie\nwas not under my charge at all. She was 14 years old, and I remember played beautiful piano\nand was very independent young lady. Uh...The children that I was taking care of Jon Pierre,\nwho was 12, Jacquo, who was 10, and Danielle, who was 7. And...uh...the...this was summer\ntime and the children did not go to school, so you had to take care of the children from the\nday...from the moment they opened their eyes til the moment they closed their eyes. They\nwere very, very active little children, so that's what you had to do. And the...the main task\nwas to take them out...outside, so that they could play, and I remember taking long walks and\ntaking picnics and mainly trying to keep peace amongst them because they were\ncontinuously fighting. (Chuckle) And...uh...uh...this...then I had to help with preparing the\nmeals and...uh...the...it......but what I remember most...most is the evening meal where we all\nsit around the table and...uh... It was a very moving moment when Pastor Trocm\u00e9 said the\nprayers and the whole...the whole rhythm of the day changed. It...1t was very busy\neverywhere where...when, you know, you hear about the busyness, about the lots to do in the\nTrocm\u00e9 house and it was true. It was a dynamic situation and at that moment, everybody was\nquiet and thoughtful and completely changed.",
        "A: I didn't know about their plans at all. One day, however,...uh...Mother Trocm\u00e9 told me that\nthey intended to have children come from the Condegeres and that when they are in Le\nChambon, they would want me to go there in..1nto the same house to help with the children\nbecause the children would not know French. A lot...a lot of the children would not know\nFrench, and they wanted me to help with the children. Would I do that? And I said, \"Of\ncourse.\" And then, also.,...at...at...one thing happened that made...did...1t was very strange.\nThey did not treat me like a refugee child. They treated me more like a French\nchild...youngster. Right? Uh...Be...I don't...[ mean I wasn't...they did not realize so much\nmy...my background, I don't think. Until one day, I receive a letter from my grandfather\nsaying that they were going to go to Cuba and I was terribly upset. I thought that I would\nnever see my grandparents again, and I cried very much. And then they realized that...uh...I\nhad the similar background to the children that they were helping and...uh...I think they\nwere...uh...very glad I could be...uh...bridge between the people of the village and the people\nand the children.",
        "A: Uh...Pastor Trocm\u00e9 was a very distant person. I've read...uh..several descriptions of him as a\nperson, and he was all of them. All of the descriptions was...were...are true. When I say he\nwas a very distant person, then I mean he was a very distant person at the beginning, at the\noutset. He...he was...he was a leader. He was a leader. To...to his wife he was completely\ndifferent. His relationship with his wife, 1t was completely different. He was very warm. So\nhe was both warm and distant.",
        "A: And...uh...I have a tendency to call her Mama Trocm\u00e9. Mama Trocm\u00e9 was a\nwonderful...uh...caring person...uh...who...who did everything. She...she would\n..uh...uh...do...uh...peel potatoes as much as she would help another person. I mean she\nwould be there for...for her own household. She had an awful lot to do. The daily difficulties\nwere enormous for her. Enormous. She had four boarders in her house. In order to survive\nfinancially, the Trocme's had to have boarders. And...uh..when...they... they gave her a lot of\nwork.",
        "A: I didn't move around in town.",
        "A: I didn't. I was with the children or in the house. I never moved around town. And then when\nI was 1n the house with the other...the house was called Lagasbe. Uh...If you want to come to\nthat period now...uh...that...I was first in LeChambon during the summer. Right? And then\nwhen the school started, I moved to Lagasbe. And...uh...when I came to Lagasbe, the\nchildren from Gurs ...were...had already arrived, I think a day or 2 before. And...uh... There\nwas a room for the girls and a room for the boys. Was very, very small. Very small and\ncrowded. So I was in the girls' room. And...uh... There my task was to...(pause)\nuh...to...uh...help them in any way you can. I mean there was not an assigned task. You\nhelped because they were des... These children had just left their parents, and they were in a\nsituation where they hardly knew where they were. They...they did not understand where\nthey were. They...uh..knew they were somewhere in France without their parents. They had\ncome from Germany. They had...uh...arrived in Gurs 1n...1in the camp. They...they had been\ntransported from Gurs to Le Chambon. And...and they had no idea where they were and\nwhat they were there for. So, you...you had to...to hold their hands. That's what it was.\nYou...you had to hold their hands because they were alone. All of them. Each one of them.\nUh...Then I was told I should go to school and I was glad to go to school. There was only\none other person who could go to school because the school was, of course,\nalready...uh...high school and you had to know French 1n order to go to school. And the other\nchildren did not know, except one boy. So the boy was____, and I...we went to school. And\nwe went to school each day so I don't really know what happened 1n the little house during\nthe day. I only know that in the evening when I came home I tried to teach them some\nFrench. I tried to sing songs with them. I...uh...tried to console, and then after our meal...well\nour meal consisted of a soup and a piece of bread, essentially, I had to study a lot. So I\nstudied til Il o'clock at night. Then I got up at 6 o'clock in the morning to study some more\nbefore I went to school. And...uh...went to school with...uh...Jon.",
        "A: This...I...I started...uh...uh...school in September and...uh..1n November, I got a letter from\nmy father saying, \"Drop everything. We have an American visa. And come to Lyon\ntomorrow.\" And...uh...that was it. I...l was flabbergasted. I was...uh...torn...uh...I felt I am\nbetraying my little comrades. I was leaving them at the peak...I...I had realized that the...that\nwe were in hiding more or less and...uh...I.... was torn to go, but I mean I could not leave my\nfather's letter...uh...unanswered and he had already, of course, left his village, so he expected\nme to be in Lyon. And so I prepared to leave. And when I prepared to leave, the children\ntook me to the railroad station and it started snowing and the children went home and I\nwaited for the train and the train never came. And I got frantic. It was afternoon and I still\ncouldn't leave. And I was all by myself and I...uh... decided I had to...to walk to Lyon.\nAnd...uh...I left the place and...uh...about an hour later, I was lost. Completely lost!\nThe...uh...snow had turned into a tremendous snow storm. I...I was first in the snow up to my\nankles and then it became higher and higher and I got stuck til up to my knees and at one\npoint, I thought that was it. I am not going to make it either back or forth, and I remember\njust putting my head on the snow and sort of giving up and...uh...then 1t was so cold that I\nhad to move. And I started running again. Somehow I got out of it. Somehow I got into\nsomeplace where the...where people...and somehow I got into the train to Lyon. I can't\nremember exactly how. And I was...uh...I was...uh... That's the reason I can't remember much\nof this because I was in total shock. And...uh...when I came to Lyon, I don't remember how I\nmet my parents anymore. I...I was so totally shocked. Uh...My father must have gotten a visa\nthere and I must have gotten a visa there, but I don't remember anything. And...uh...I\nremember then my father and...my brother wasn't with us because he was still in a camp.\nAnd he joined us in Marseilles and I am beginning slightly to remember from that part on\nwhen we were in Marseilles...uh...my father received a letter from the Committee that we\nshould go to the Condemill to await permission to leave France. We had the America visa.\nThis visa, I must add how we got it. It...1t was a miracle almost because only a thousand\npeople got visas from the United States at this time. They was...this was a special action\nby...uh...President Roosevelt and the Refugee Committee headed by Varian Fry\nwho...uh...wanted to save European intellectuals. And they, because my father was on the\nblack list and he was a writer, they gave him this chance and gave him and his family\nanother chance to come to America. And...uh...(Pause) But we didn't have a permission to\nleave the country yet. That was another hurdle to overcome. So we were told to go to await\nthe official permission in the Condemill. And...uh...My father said, \"No. I shall not go to any\ncamp even if I have to starve.\" And so we did not go to the Condemill. We did starve, and\nwe stayed in Marseilles and...uh...things dragged on and dragged on and dragged on\nand...uh...my father became very impatient. And one day he said to us, \"We are leaving.\" It\nhappened to have been the 7th of December 1941. And we took the train from Marseilles to\nthe...to the Spanish border where we got out of the train. We went across the border with our\nAmerican visa, but not the permission. And at that particular point the border was closed, but\nwe were already on the Spanish side. So we couldn't be sent back because the border was\nclosed so we were in Spain, and the Spanish had no objections because they knew we were\nnot going to stay in Spain and...uh...uh... we had...we took a ticket...we had 50 dollars on us\nfor the four of us. My brother had joined me I think I had mentioned that. For the four of us\nwe had 50 dollars. We took the 4th class ticket to go to...uh...Portugal. And...uh...was a long\nride. When we came to Barcelona...uh...my father said, \"Let's get out of the train. I know\nsomebody in Barcelona.\" So we all left the train in Barcelona. But it wasn't...I guess they\nweren't too much afraid because we had the American visa. And then we traveled to Lisbon.",
        "A: Go on? (Chuckle) Again, I mean you had to live from day to day. There was no money so\nwe went to a Committee and...uh... they helped us. They were very kind. And we stayed...of\ncourse, it was not, as I mentioned before, the war had started. Pearl Harbor and...uh...uh...the\nGermans started...uh...mining the Atlantic Ocean. The boats did not want to cross anymore\nthrough the United States. It was not easy to pursue the plans to go to America. Finally, we\ndid get...uh...a passage on the Niasa, and the Niasa did not go directly from Lisbon to New\nYork, but went first to Cuba. And, of course, we wanted to see my grandparents but we\nweren't allowed to get off the boat at all. And my grandparents never knew that we had\nlanded in Cuba. And...uh...from Cuba we went to the Bermuda's, at which point we learned\nthat the Niasa was full of spies and that we're not going to be able to pursue our voyage\nand...uh...the police came on board and they interviewed everybody for hours, found the\nSpies, arrested the spies, and we then were allowed to...to go to America. However, they did\nnot want us to go to New York, and we landed in Virginia Beach. And...uh...the American\nauthorities came on board, again screened everybody on board and then we got permission\nto...to leave. We were guided from the boat, blindfolded to a train that was also blinded...\nhad... uh...the windows were blinded. Uh...And we were given seats and we were not\nallowed to move from there, and the trains started to go to New York, but we were afraid. I\nmean we were in America, and the first thing we got was...uh...sandwiches. We had never\nseen such white bread in years and we were extremely relieved and I mean...uh...you cannot\ndescribe the feeling. It's impossible. It's...it's a feeling that you can only have once in a\nlifetime. We arrived in New York, Pennsylvania Station. I don't think a lot of immigrants did\nthat. Uh...I think it's 32nd or 34th Street. We arrived and here you were and then where did\nyou go? Right? So...uh...we...we decided we have to disburse because we didn't have any\nmoney to go to a hotel or anything like that. And...uh...so my...we all had friends and I went\nto some friends I had and I happened to be on 86th Street, West Side. So I walked from 34 to\n86th Street because it's very easy to find your way in New York, and I rang the bell and\n(laughter) I said, \"Here I am. Will you take me in?\" And they did. I imagine my father and\nmy mother and my brother had the same kind of experience. I came in. They took me tn.\nThey were very, very kind. And I fell sick. Immediately! Immediately fell sick. My...And\nthe first thing I did was, when I got better, I went to Julie Richmond High School, and\ninscribed myself and they were very, very kind. I knew two words of English. And if I say\nthem to you you will laugh. They are: cheek to cheek.\" (Laughter) Because one of the\nFred Astaire songs of that time...Now I know it was \"Together Dancing Cheek to Cheek.\"\nAnd that was the only two words, is cheek and to...uh...that I knew. I don't think I knew what\nit was. (Laughter) Uh...But I went to high school and I said I would like to go to school and\nthey said, \"Fine.\" But they, of course, noticed that I couldn't speak a word of English so they\nsent me to the French teacher in order to sort me out. It so happened that the French teacher\ndid not speak any French. She came from Spain. And I didn't know any Spanish so that\ndidn't work. And...uh...after awhile, I found a very, very wonderful English teacher who\nunderstood the...my difficulties, and...uh...she explained it to the others and so I was...uh...put\ninto...uh...into two classes at once so I would advance quickly and...uh...didn't take me long.\nI learned English and...uh...I graduated within the same year from high school. And...uh...I\nlived first with a family that needed a babysitter and I took care of the baby after I came\nhome from school and then later when my father made...could afford it and we had an\napartment, I moved in with my parents. My father, of course, joined immediately a group\nof...uh...people who...to help other refugees and...uh...he also got himself an agent and he\ncontacted the Free French. I contacted the Free French too, but they thought I was too young\nto be of any help. I didn't think so and I...today I... don't know why they didn't let me join\nthem. Uh...I was very eager to...to help the war effort. At the same time, my brother was\nrecruited into the Army and he did...he became...uh...American soldier and...uh...after basic\ntraining, he was sent overseas and he died in France on the last year of the war in the\nFrench...in the American army. And...uh...well, I thought I should make my contribution, but\nI guess...uh...I...I wasn't able to...to join any group that went on combat. I continued school.\nAfter graduation from high school, I entered Hunter College of the City of New York. At\nthat time it was not...uh...evident to get into Hunter College. You had to pass a very stiff\nexam. And...uh...I...to this day, I don't know how I managed to pass this exam, but I did. I\nwas accepted in Hunter College and there the French teacher spoke French. (Laughter) He\nwas , and only a few weeks after I...I...uh...joined the Hunter College. He went and\njoined the Free French and went back to France.",
        "A: Uh...After I finished college, still in the last year of college, I heard that Ernest Koenig had\nsurvived the war. He had looked for me via his brother. In England, his brother had written\nto somebody in New York who must have looked up the telephone book or something.\nAnyway, I was found. I was contacted by Ernest Koenig, and...uh..we decided to see each\nother again. And so my...upon graduation, I was only intend to earn enough money to pay a\nticket over to Europe and visit Ernest. So, upon graduation, I looked for a job. And I\nlooked...I was at that point also I had done the Art Students League. I didn't mention that. I\ndidn't only go to college. I went to the Arts too. I must say after my brother died, I was\ncrushed and I didn't want to go to...to see anybody or stay...stay anymore in my old\nenvironment so I went...I left...uh...college. I went to evening college to...in order to finish\nthe...the year and I went to arts school in the day time, to Art Students League.\nAnd...uh...when I graduated I...uh...I...uh...I graduated in arts. And I looked for jobs in art.\nAnd as you know, jobs in art after graduation are not easy to find unless you are ready to\ndo...uh...serial kinds of jobs, like in cartoons or that kind of thing I was offered, but I didn't\nwant to do that. So one day, I...uh...I went to the public library to get out a book and there\nwas a big advertisement for somebody with my language skills. I went in. I got the job, and I\nbecame a librarian.",
        "A: Uh...I...after a few months on my job, I had enough money. I asked for permission if I could\ngo to Europe and they gave it to me for a week, I wanted to go. My...L...also...Ermest, by that\ntime, had lived in London and my grandmother was in London also. So very officially, I\nvisited my grandmother. And my father came with me to visit his mother, so my father and I\nwent to London, and I met Ernest at the Picadilly...uh...subway station. Uh...And...uh...we\ndecided to get married next week. (Laughter) That was it.",
        "A: No. I wasn't teaching.",
        "A: No. I wasn't teaching at all. The...1t was helping them psychologically more than anything\nelse. The children were very disturbed and they were treated as a bunch and not as\nindividuals. They were not...they were the children that came from Gurs, but that wasn't so.\nEach child had a different individual story, and nobody listened to them. So what I really did\nis I...1 helped them tell me their stories. I mean I allowed them to...to...to tell their stories,\ntheir griefs, their...their unhappiness. They cried at night. They had nightmares. One of the\nchildren wet herself every night. But that wasn't known in the village. That wasn't known at\nall. We kept that to ourselves.",
        "A: We were very, very close. We were like sisters and brothers with the boys too. The\nboys...L.... am speaking now about the girls because I was in the girls' room, but I felt for the\nboys like if they were my brothers, just as much. Especially for the teenage boys. They were\nso hungry. They...they were howling like wolves, and people didn't understand why. They\nwere hungry. They were lonesome. And...uh...I...I especially remember some of the\nboys...uh...well, you would call it, stole a potato and he was punished for it. And I was\ndevastated because he was...he was not responsible. His body needed it. We...we were so\nclose...uh...[...1n France at that time, you got...uh...you got...uh...a special allowance for\nchildren for chocolate and sugar. Up to 16 years, you got chocolate and sugar. And I\ncollected my chocolate and sugar and I didn't have a chance to say this, but in the meantime\nErnest was in a concentration camp, and I took that...and sent it in to the concentration camp\nand that was one of the reasons I didn't want to leave Europe. I felt if I didn't send my sugar\nhe would...he would not survive. So...uh...I have a letter...I think I may still have it...where\nthe children tell me, \"We will not forget Ernest. We will send him sugar.\" They had nothing\nthemselves. But we were very close. Very close!",
        "A: I don't think so. No. I don't think so. No.",
        "A: No. Uh...Maybe later. At this particular point, 1t was just being established, you see. The\nmain thing I think was the...uh...worry. Where's the money going to come from to support\nus? And that was...uh...Pastor Trocme's money and it...I must say, we were\nsupported...uh...wonderfully by the American Quakers and by the...uh... . They gave\nthe money. Those two organizations. If it weren't for the American Quakers and the\n_, they could not have had enough money to establish the house.",
