        "Question: Let me just ask you, just tell me who you are and where we are?",
        "Answer: Okay. Is that comfortable for you? All right. My name is Fritz\nSchnaittacher and we are right now in my home in Rockwell Center, where | have\nlived since 1948.",
        "Q: Tell me about when you were born and the town where you grew up?",
        "A: | was born in a little village by the name of Forth, which is 23 kilometers north east\nof Nuremberg. It's between Nuremberg and By-roit (ph). By-roit (ph), the famous\nWagner town where the fesh-beeler (ph) had taken place. And | lived, | was born in\nthis village in July of 1913, shortly before the outbreak of World War |. And hardly\ngot to know my father because he died, to some degree as a result of World War |,\nin 1919 when | was hardly six years old. | lived in the village and went to the\ngrammar school, which then was an all-Jewish school. Which is interesting because\nthe town, the little villages around Nuremberg had become centers of Jewish life\nwhen Nuremberg was not, | mean it was no longer permissible to live in Nuremberg.\nNuremberg was one of the so-called principal cities and it was only, | believe, in the\nmiddle of the 19\" century or early 19\" century that the Jews were again allowed to\nlive in Nuremberg. And that is, at that time, when the Jews began to leave these\nsmall villages. When | grew up, the village had a total population of probably 1,200\nand a Jewish population of maybe ten families, enough to have a so-called Minion\n(ph). But it wasn't long, and | would say it was in my third year of grammar school,\nthat the Jewish community could no longer afford to have the Jewish teacher and\nalso he had doubled as a Huss-in (ph). A Huss-in (ph) is who holds the prayers on\nFritz Schnaittacher 2\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 2\nSaturdays and Jewish holidays. Then the Jewish kids were being transferred to the\nso-called government school, which was in the main, a Protestant school. We also\nhad a Catholic school. And |! went to, | attended the government school for a period\nof two years and then, because of the lack of better educational facilities in the village,\n| moved to a so-called , a boarding house in Nuremberg and from\nthere went to High School. That for a period of six years. Thereafter, | took a job.\nIt is well to mention that on weekends, when | started to work, | would visit my mother\nand Aunts who lived in the village, twenty-three kilometers away. Anti-Semitism\nbegan to become noticeable. And | never forget an incident. Nuremberg had a\ndeep, what do you call it? . A fortification. And we played\nsoccer there. And one guy with a hammer and sickle on his cap came to assist us\nto, to ward off a bunch of Nazi kids.",
        "Q: Do you know when this would have been or how old you were then?",
        "A: Yes. | was 11 years old and that would have been in 1924. Shalll.. .?",
        "Q: Let me ask you about that incident. Do you remember what the provocation was?\nHow do you know they were Nazi sympathizers?",
        "A: There was no provocation on our part. It was simply an attack on the part of these\nNazi kids who recognized us as being Jewish. And they stormed upon us and tried\nto beat us up. But this lonely Communist beat them off and it's an experience which\n| will never forget.",
        "Q: How did you know that they were Nazi kids? Were they wearing anything? Did\nthey say something?\nFritz Schnaittacher 3\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 3",
        "A: They wore swastikas and they called us dirty Jews, etceteras. Now the Nazism\nin certain schools was so strong that it was necessary for the Director of the boarding\nhouse to have me transferred to a school that was less stigmatized and\ncoincidentally, the school from which | had to be transferred was near the courthouse\nin Nuremberg where ultimately the War Crimes Trials took place. It's, there are so\nmany things that are unusual coincidences in my life, that some, that was in 1924,\nand | interrogated the Chief of Staff of the German Army, Ky-kle (ph), in 1945. And\nhe had to get up and salute me. Also one of the many unforgettable incidences.\nTo bring us more up to date, beyond the period of time that | had gone to school, and\nwhen | started to work for a company in Nuremberg and that was in 1930. And it\nwas from then on that | would regularly visit my mother on weekends. This brings\nus to the time when the Nazi propaganda began to become extremely aggressive\nand particularly then, in the year 1932, when in spite of the enormous propaganda\nthat was being put over the German people, Hitler's popularity began to shrink. And\nthere were two elections. One was in the summer of 1932 and one was in the fall\nof 1932. And particularly the election in the fall of 1932 reflected a decrease in the\npopularity of Hitler. Which ultimately then, on January 30\", 1933 led to Hindenberg's\ndecision to appoint Hitler Chancellor of Germany. It was followed up by another\nelection, at the beginning of March of 1933. Which Hitler won only in combination\nwith all the other parties other than the Social Democrats and the Communists. And\nit was so deeply unfortunate that these two left wing parties had failed to really create\none common front. History would have been different, at least my belief. After the\nFritz Schnaittacher 4\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 4\nelection, when Hitler considered himself in sole power of Germany, then the wave of\nAnti-Semitism was enormously increased and this was the time when already Jewish\nstores were being pilfered or destroyed. And it ultimately led to a very important,\npersonal incident. On one of the visits in the middle of March to my mother's house,\n| was hardly at home, when there was a knock on the door and a policeman, the local\ngendarme, came into our living room and said, \"Mr. Schnaittacher, | would like to see\nyou at the police station.\" When | arrived at the police station, he very briskly told\nme that | was under arrest. And again, it was one of these painful, painful moments\nwhen | had to call up my mother, who had a severe cold, and | had to tell her, \"Mother,\nI'm under arrest.\" Well, she was shrieking and she came storming out to the police\nstation protesting that a War widow should be treated like this without any reason\nwhatsoever, but obviously it did not do any good. My village was too small to have\na prison of it's own and so | was transported to the County seat of Earl-la-len (ph)\nwhere | then, as dusk began to settle, was put into a cell in the police prison. And |\nwas being welcomed by four or five other prisoners who had already been in there,\nas a result of having been anti-Nazis, not Jewish, but anti-Nazis. Shall | continue?",
        "Q: Yes. But I'm curious about a couple of things. One, was there, did you have\nany hint when you were taken in, why you were taken in? You were living in\nNuremberg at the time that you were arrested in your hometown of Forth, is that\nright?",
        "A: Right.\nFritz Schnaittacher 9)\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 5",
        "Q: How does that happen? Did you have any sense of why? How they would even\nhave known of you?",
        "A: No. | had no idea why | was being arrested. However, as | was turned over to\nthe warden of the prison, | requested information. Why | was here. And he then,\neither that night or the following morning, gave me a slip of paper which indicated\nthat | was arrested because of having agitated against the National Socialist\nGovernment because of knowledge of secret ammunition depots and liaison of illegal\nanti-Nazi organizations. Now, actually, yes | was an anti-Nazi. I was no longer\ninvolved in anti-Nazi activities. So the actual reason was to provide the local\npopulace of the village with a degree of satisfaction, to have me arrested as a Jew.\nAnd another cousin of mine who was the only other young male Jew in the village.\nAnd it was quite an experience. As | was given the easiest job in the prison, and\nthat was to fill, we didn't have running water in the cells, but each one of us would get\na water pitcher. And it was my job to fill the water basins that we used to wash\nourselves with. And to fill these pitchers with water. And in doing so, | turned\naround and there sits my cousin in the adjoining cell. Well we had a very friendly\ngreeting, and surprising so. The moment that! had gotten into prison my mother did\nnot rest for a minute and pursued every possible approach in order to have me\nliberated, as well as my cousin. And then followed some six weeks later and | was,\nwhich would make it the beginning of May, and, no, it made it the end of April.",
        "Q: Of 1933?\nFritz Schnaittacher 6\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 6",
        "A: When | was released from prison, my cousin as well. And | was on parole for two\nmonths, which meant that | had to report to a police station every other day. Shall |\ncontinue?",
        "Q: Let me take you back just a little bit. You mentioned that you were an anti-Nazi\nbut weren't involved in anti-Nazi activities. What did it mean to you at that time, or\nwhat kind of activities had you been involved in? What was sort of the culture of\nanti-Nazism where you were living, when you were | guess about 20 years old?\nWith your friends? What were you talking about? What were you doing?",
        "A: Well we would have seminars to gain an understanding of what it would mean, of\nwhat Nazism meant and what it meant not only to the Jews but the people at large.\nThe total oppression of several areas and after all, when, | want to be sure that is\nright. When Germany finally collapsed there were over 300,000 non-Jewish\nprisoners in concentration camps in Germany. And the anti-Nazi forces were, they\nwere primarily the Social Democrats and the Communists. And who really fought\nHitler physically and with all the idealism and principal and firmness possible. But |\nhad the opportunity, after | was released not only from prison but from the parole, to\ntravel as a salesman within limited scope. Not by car but by train. And | never\nforget that some very simple people who had taken the same train | did in the vicinity\nof Munich, that they expressed without fear when they recognized me as a Jew, that\nHitler is the enemy of all of Germany. By the way, | failed to, when | corrected myself\nbefore with regard to the time that | left prison. And because of the danger of again\nbeing re-arrested in Nuremberg, | left Nuremberg and moved with an Uncle of mine\nFritz Schnaittacher 7\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 7\nin Munich. And it was May 1%, 1933. The reason that | am pointing out in this very\ninteresting coincidence, | came back to Munich on May 1*, 1945, as the conquering\nAmerican soldier after having liberated Dachau. I'm not speaking of myself but my\nregiment, my division, and it was to be sure one of the greatest moments in my life.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you were afraid in Nuremberg, that you would be re-arrested.\nWas there a sense that they were watching you? It seems that if they arrested you\nwhen you went home and you didn't live there, they must have somehow known you\nwere coming?",
        "A: Well, yes, there was the fear that one could be re-arrested and then it would not\nhave been a police prison but it would have meant to be sent to the concentration\ncamp of Dachau. Now Dachau at that time was not an extermination camp but it\nwas a camp of terror. And personally violent persecution. At that time the, a few\nfriends of mine were shot in Dachau. And the proverb, if you can call it that, was\ncreated: shot while attempting to escape. Now, so | lived in Germany having been\nrelieved from the duty to report to police stations, and | had the goal, as soon as\npossible, as early as possible, to be able to leave Germany. And particularly so\nbecause on a visit to Nuremberg, not to my village, | had arranged, my mother had\narranged to meet me in Nuremberg in order to spend a pleasant weekend together.\nWhen she came home from that visit, she was ordered by the Mayor of the village to\ncome to the village counsel and she was told, Mrs. Schnaittacher, if you have been\nhere today, during the day or yesterday, we would have arrested you. We give you\nthe opportunity to defend yourself. My mother had been extremely courageous and\nFritz Schnaittacher 8\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 8\nshe screamed at them that if they wanted to arrest her, they should do so right now\nbecause the following day she was going to leave the area to live with her mother.\nAnd that's what she did. And that, the , the precarious actions of my\nmother, and my Uncles and Aunts, was my never-ending burden and sorrow here.\n| had, and that is, goes for so many of the refugees. We had an interesting,\nrewarding time here. Cost of living was extremely low and even though | only\nearned at the beginning $13.00 a week, it was fully adequate to keep me alive. And\nto enable me on weekends to go hiking and we had a wonderful time. It is interesting\nto note that this now is the late fall of 1933. My brother had lived here already. He\ncame, not because of the Nazis, in 1929 at the behest of an Uncle of mine, who lived\nhere, had lived here for some years and had a going business and was not married\nand therefore didn't have any other children. And my brother entered his business\nand later on | joined him. We lived in the utmost of comfort, earning $13.00, $15.00,\n$17.00 a week. On 96\" Street and Western Avenue. Across the street from the,\nwhat's the name of the hotel? The Hotel Paris, which had a swimming pool and we\ncould go swimming every night, for 25 cents. And it was really a wonderful way of\nliving. Burdened only by our concern for our in Germany.",
        "Q: Can | ask you, before you came over, you sound like you were quite close with\nyour mother, were you having conversations with her about whether you should go?\nDid she give you any advice about the climate in Germany and how that should effect\nyour decision to, did you talk about that?\nFritz Schnaittacher 9\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 9",
        "A: Yes indeed. There was my mother, two spinster Aunts on my father's side.\nThere were two brothers of my mother's who were married. And one of them had\nthree children. And my mother insisted that | should leave as soon as possible after\n| was able to get a visa. And | left with a great deal of reticence because of leaving\nmy mother over there, but she promised that she would visit me. And indeed she\ndid the following year. And stayed in America for over six months. Then because\nof her love for her mother and the feeling of obligation that she had for her, she came\nback to Germany in order to take care of her mother. And it was then, only after the\nCrystalnaught (ph), after my mother suffered a nervous breakdown, that she and her\nmother, and Uncles and Aunts and cousins, all ultimately were brought over here.\nSo we were extremely fortunate that we didn't lose anybody in the Holocaust.\n[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]",
        "Q: It was that they hadn't lost anybody?",
        "A: Right. So this brings us up to 1939. And when my mother was the first member\nof the family after myself to then come back in order to remain here. And we hada\nsmall apartment on Western Avenue and 80\" Street. And then we, where some\ncousins had lived, and myself. And when my mother came, we rented, no, first she\nstayed with my Uncle, and then later on when her mother came as well, we rented\nan apartment on 151% Street and Broadway. Which is the southern part of\nWashington Heights. And at that time it was just a wonderful neighborhood. You\nnever, day or night, you would never fear of any attack or of any incident. And so\nmy brother, who by then had gotten married and his wife was pregnant, and |, and\nFritz Schnaittacher 10\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 10\nmy mother and grandmother, we lived in a five room apartment. And then, when\nother Uncles and Aunts came, we just doubled up. There was never any complaint.\nThere was only the utmost of happiness, to have succeeded in bringing our relatives\nout of Germany. And even as far as, which is of some significance with regard to\nthe question that has been raised, the integration of refugees into American life.\nThere was an Aunt of mine who then was in her late 30's or early 40's, and she didn't\nhave any children. And she and her husband, through another friend of theirs,\nstarted to pull threads out of pieces of cloth in order to separate them. And they\nstarted to do that in our dining room. And from there they developed a business\nwhere ultimately they employed some forty people on 26\" Street and Broadway.\nAnd when my Uncle and Aunt ultimately died, they took care of their nieces and\nnephews, not having had any children of their own. And that went for ever so many\nof the people, that no job was low enough as long as they were able to sustain\nthemselves. Whether young women that worked in households, or in factory jobs,\nnotwithstanding, very good educations. And this, | think, is one of the unique\naspects of this immigration.",
        "Q: Can | ask you, did your mother and Uncles and Aunts talk much about their\nexperience in Germany after you left, in the years leading up to the time that they\n2? What did they tell you about what was going on and what their\nexperiences were?",
        "A: Well that's a very good question because it leads me to one of the most satisfying\nexperiences that | had. As | had mentioned early, | had worked for my Uncle who\nFritz Schnaittacher 11\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 11\nhad a wholesale business of glassware and chinaware located in Munich. And\nwhen he came over here, he told me the following story. When he approached as\nit was customary his place of business on the morning of the Crystalnaught (ph), the\nmanager of the business, not Jewish, to wnom | had been reported when | worked\nfor him, was standing at the entrance to this business in the uniform of a storm\ntrooper, and said, \"Jews are not allowed here.\". And my Uncle did not protest\nbecause he recognized the threat that was behind him and he turned around, went\nhome, and within a few hours a Nazi knocked on his door and arrested him and took\nhim to Dachau. And the same thing happened to his brother, who lived some\nhundreds of miles away from where he lived. So my two Uncles were taken to the\nconcentration camp and that was in November 1938. And finally they were able to\nget out in January of, | believe January of 1939. The Uncle with whom | had lived,\nthe one who had lived in Munich, because of the totally inadequate clothing that they\nreceived in Dachau, suffered severe circulatory problems and that\u2019s what he died\nfrom some years later. But this is the story that he told me. So now, we go back,\nor we advance to the year 1945. Fritz, as a member of the 157'\" Regiment of the\n45\" Division, contributed to the conquest of Munich. And as soon as | had the time\nto follow up on this story which | told you, | went into my Uncle's place of business\nwhich had been bombed out, but people were there. And | inquired for the name of\nHermann. Hermann was the name of the fellow who had been the manager of my\nUncle's business, who was responsible for sending him back home and having him\narrested and taken to Dachau. And so this is now May 1945. And | finally got\nFritz Schnaittacher 12\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 12\ninformation as to where Hermann lived. And | had the deep, deep satisfaction of\nlocating him, having been an officer | had the privilege of a jeep, and | drove out\nthere. And people gleefully would point in the direction where Hermann lived. And\nthere he was. | recognized him at once. And he just wore pants and long johns.\nAnd | told him in a not too friendly a manner that he should get dressed. He didn't\nrecognize me. His wife and daughter protested vehemently. And | took him to the\nCIC Headquarters in Munich where | interrogated him. And fortunately for me,\nbecause here | was on a war of my own, and which was not allowed, but | found out\nthat he had been the guard in a concentration camp. Which made him subject to\nautomatic arrest. Eisenhower had declared the so-called automatic arrest category\nand you as an American soldier could arrest anybody who was guilty of certain\ncrimes, such as having been the guard at a concentration camp. _| didn't tell him who\n| was until | finished the interrogation and | said, \"Do you know who | am?\" And he\nsaid, \"No.\" | said, \"My name is Schnaittacher.\" So he said, \"But you should know\nhow much | did for your Uncle.\" So | said, \"Yes, indeed, | do know.\" And with that\n| turned him over to the CIC, who were less humane than | was and at least he was\nput away in prison for some months. The uniqueness of my war experience, | don't\nknow whether, should we talk about that now?",
        "Q: Let me ask you one thing. Did you Uncles, who were now in America living with\nyou, did they talk about their experience in Dachau? Did they explain what had\nhappened, what it was like?\nFritz Schnaittacher 13\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 13",
        "A: Yes. They weren't beaten at that time, yet. But there was totally inadequate\nfood. No heating. And inadequate dress. That is what is uppermost in my mind\nfrom what | remember. My Dad, keeping in mind your possible interest in our\nintegration in American life, that this was also the period of the outbreak of the\nSpanish Civil War. And most of us, of course, or all of us, were most sympathetic\nto the role of the Republican government in fighting Franco. And certainly,\nultimately, in fighting Mussolini and Hitler. And we participated in the collection of\nfunds to support the International Brigade and to render, I'm reluctant to say every\npossible support because we could have volunteered to go to Spain, which | didn't\nand very few of us did, if any. Now of some significance to my life and the lives of\nmy relatives and my mother, | had become involved in Uncle's business. And of\ncourse it was my proud attempt to support as much as possible my mother, my\ngrandmother, my Uncles and Aunts who didn't make a living of their own at the\nbeginning. And ultimately they did. And my mother kept house. And then | had\nto assume much greater responsibility because my Uncle died. And so my brother\nand | became heirs, only to some degree because we had two cousins who, or three\ncousins, who shared in the estate in equal shares. Then we became involved in the\nwar. The company that | was with produced medical supplies, which were being\nused in the war. And most important | met the girl who ultimately | was going to\nmarry. Her father shared office space with me. And ata Christmas party, 1941, |\nrecognized, and | told my mother, that that was the girl | was going to marry. And it\nwas only two and a half months later, two months later, that we got married. And\nFritz Schnaittacher 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 14\nyes, all the relatives raised their eyebrows and counted the days. But nothing\nhappened.",
        "Q: Was she also a refugee?",
        "A: No. Her father had emigrated from Russia around 1900. Her mother was born\nhere. And then! was drafted in May of 1942. And! went AWOL, do you know what\nthat means? | went AWOL very early on when Dottie visited me in Fort Dix, and we\nspent the night together. Then shortly after basic training, which | took in Cancroft\n(ph), South Carolina, Dottie joined me with a small weekend release. And it grew to\nthe point where we had a steamer truck and a dog and we separated when | was\nflown over to Germany, not to Germany, first to Africa, in July of 1944.",
        "Q: So you had been in training for about two years?",
        "A: Well the training, after basic training, | was transferred and Dottie joined me, to\nFlorida, to an Ordinance Camp. And then | applied for OCS and...",
        "Q: OCS being?",
        "A: Officers Candidate School. From which | graduated in the spring of 1943. And\nthen there was an excess of officers so we were being trained in the cooks and\nbakers school and in an Ordinance Camp, and we traveled from the East Coast to\nthe West Coast. Until January or February of 1944, when Dottie's brother was killed\nas a Marine flyer, he was in training in carrier landings. And | think that probably\nwas February or March of 1944, or February. And then | was sent to Intelligence\nTraining Schools and ultimately my main effort was the interrogation of prisoners of\nwar. So in July of 1944, Dottie and | separated. She went back to New York and |\nFritz Schnaittacher 15\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 15\nwas flown to Italy via Africa. And in order to participate in the landing in Southern\nFrance on August 15, 1944. And that's where | joined the 157\" Regiment and my\nbuddy, Fritzi, who was a Master Sargent, and | had a small intelligence team\nconsisting of Fritzi and a Staff Sargent by the name of Al Magertle (ph), from the\nMiddle West. And after landing in Southern France and moving quickly up to the\nvicinity of the Borsch-Mums (ph) where we arrived in early December or late\nNovember, in a small town by the name of . And we were stuck\nthere until we started our offensive that was really thought to end the war. And that\nwas about March 15, 1945. Now from then on, or within a week thereafter, there\nwas hardly a town or village that was of significance to my family or myself, that we\ndidn't conquer. The first experience of this kind was the town of Ah-shaf-en-berg\n(ph), which is about 100 kilometers from Frankfurt. But the Aunt that | had\nmentioned earlier, she had originated from Ah-shaf-en-berg (ph). And | had\nattended her wedding in 1923 or 1924. And |, together with Fritzi, as interrogators,\naccepted the surrender of this town. And then had some unique experiences in\nbringing about the surrender of more German outfits by apprehending the fortress\ncommander, putting him in our jeep, and wherever we went, he said, put your arms\ndown. A unique little story was some days later, when we were approaching a\nbeautiful, mid-evil town, Bumberg (ph), where | had four prisoners in front of me.\nAnd one of them stepped out and said, \"Lieutenant, didn't we go to school together?\"\nAnd | lifted his helmet, recognized him at once, and said, \"Yes, Lesline (ph).\" Lesline\n(ph) was hisname. \"Wedid.\" And he said, \"Fritz, let me gohome.\" | said, \"I can't.\"\nFritz Schnaittacher 16\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 16\nlf we have time, | could tell a very humorous story which happened the following day.\nWe had taken Bumberg (ph) and we had probably about 500 prisoners in a\nchurchyard. We had more information than they did, there was hardly any purpose\nin interrogating any of them. | just walked around to hear their voices, to hear what\nthey were talking about. And out of these hundreds, one of them came up to me,\nhe saluted, and said, \"Lieutenant, | come from a village not far from here. Couldn't\nyou let me go home?\" So | said, \"Why, where do you come from?\" He said, \"I\ncome from Forth.\" Forth is my village, where | Knew everybody. Where | knew\nevery house number. We didn't have cobblestones, we only had dirt roads. And |\nsaid to him, \"But you weren't born in Forth?\" He said, \"No.\" | said, \"How come that\nyou lived in Forth?\" He said, \"Because | married a girl from Forth.\" | said, \"Whom\ndid you marry?\" He said, \"Gunta Hause (ph).\" | said, \"Gunta Hause (ph)? She\nlived in House Number 35.\" He said, \"Yes.\" And | said, \"And that's two houses\nfrom the little fire house and three houses from the Protestant Church and the\nministries, and if you looked across the street there was House Number 52.\" And\nhis pupils grew wider and wider, he said, \"If American Intelligence has all this\ninformation how can we win the war?\" So now you know how we won the war.",
        "Q: Was it just a coincidence that you were assigned to this division that was in that\npart of Germany?",
        "A: Entirely. Entirely coincidence.",
        "Q: That must have seemed very strange to you, | would think?\nFritz Schnaittacher 17\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 17",
        "A: And a few days later we took Schnaittacher, after which I'm named. And | visited\nin the cemetery where my father is buried. And then two days later we took\nNuremberg where | went to school. And | interrogated the Commander of the town\nof Nuremberg. And then we moved on across the Danube and we came to the\nvicinity of Dachau. And ultimately liberated Dachau.",
        "Q: Let me stop you before we go into that. When you were talking about the\ninterrogations, what would you be asking them? What do you remember about the\ninterrogations themselves?",
        "A: Sure. You never ask a question that can be answered yes or no. You want\ninformation and, by and large, what we were interested in was the strength of the\nOpposing forces. Maybe some names because they would help us in further\ninterrogations. Gun positions. Location of mines. Their plan. And what | did\nforget, and what | was being decorated for, on March 15, 1945, we, one of our\ncompanies took one of the deep bunkers, fortifications, and as they went in and\npicked up the telephone, they heard voices but couldn't make out what was being\nsaid. So my Regimental S2, Intelligence Officer, said, \"This is beyond the call of\nduty, but if you want to go up, we would appreciate it. See what you can make out.\"\nAnd Fritzi and |, we went up and it was a lively night. There was a lot of fire...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nFritz Schnaittacher 18\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 18\nTape 2",
        "A: From the moment that | picked up the phone. If | would have prepared myself in\nraising questions, | couldn't have done better than the two people who were talking\nto each other. One, they were from two German divisions, different divisions. And\none of them gave information such as, that they were leaving the following day in\norder to move in a certain direction giving coordinates. And that they were going to\nestablish their ammunition depot at such-and-such coordinates. A fuel depot at\nsuch-and-such coordinates. If | really would have asked these questions, | couldn't\nhave done any better. And because we didn't introduce, we didn't make any noise.\nWe let them talk. And only at the very end did | try and make an effort to establish\ncontact without indicating who | was, but our voice didn't go through. So we reported\nback to the battalion headquarters and he was not interested in this information. But\nregimental headquarters was and they recorded our findings, our information to\ndivision headquarters and then they send up night fighters and the following day, not\nonly because of the information that we brought, but other information as well, we\nwere able to break through the German lines and advance by over 35 kilometers or\nmiles. And for that | received the Bronze Star. And Fritzi received a Bronze Star\nwith clusters because he already had one.",
        "Q: What was your experience with your fellow soldiers? | don't know, how many\npeople in your position would there have been, of German/Jewish refugees who were\nnow part of the American army? Was ita common thing or was it sort of unusual?\nHow did they treat you?\nFritz Schnaittacher 19\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 19",
        "A: It was quite common in that the U.S. Army trained people who had a intimate\nknowledge of the language and even of dialects and geography. And the school\nwas in Cambridgy, (ph) Maryland. That's where the military intelligence training\nschool was and you could be trained, not only as an interrogator, but also in aerial\nphotography and many different aspects of military intelligence. Of course we\nthought that our particular branch was the most successful one. | mentioned we\nliberated Dachau and one of the gruesome experiences was when | was suppose to\ninterrogate a Brigadier General who claimed that he was transferred against his\nwishes to the , the army, instead of .. . no, I'm sorry. That he was\ntransferred against his wishes to the SS from the Army where he had served. And\nhe was, quote, on a rest and recuperation leave. In Dachau, that's some fine place\nfor a rest and recuperation, and he had come from Dachau, er, from Auschwitz, I'm\nsorry. And he said, \"Now, Lieutenant, if you are enraged as to what you see here in\nDachau, here you see a few bodies. There you would have seen mountains.\" And\nthe physically, the worst sight were the freight trains, which were filled with people\nwho had starved to death. | have some pictures, which I'll be glad to turn over.\nWell, the war active combat didn't last much longer and | was then being transferred\nto a camp near Ludwigsberg (ph), which housed a lot of the automatic arrestees and\n| had to interrogate them. And then | was transferred to the War Crimes\nCommission. First, near Frankfurt where we were to review the archives of the\nGerman Army High Command. Particularly, my, and the guys who were working\nwith me, my responsibility was to try and find material that was of significance to Yon\nFritz Schnaittacher 20\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 20\nMar-shot (ph) who was the economic czar under Hitler. Unfortunately, we didn't find\nmuch. Or we didn't find anything that was of significance. During this period of\ntime, whenever | had the opportunity to go back to the village where | had come from,\nas long as it didn't interfere with the obligations that | had, | would do so. And this is\nalso a whole chain of unusual coincidences. It was the first time that | came back to\nmy village. The village that | was born in, my regiment did not conquer. It was an\nengineering company that served the same division as my regiment did. But! didn't\nget through there, so it was in June of 1945 that | was able to pay my first visit. And\nas | approached the village, as | approached the house that | was born in, shutters\nbegan to open and | heard voices saying, Fritz is back, Fritz is back. | came to my\nhouse. | knocked on the door and a young girl looked down from the room where |\nwas born in. And you could hear her knees shake because those were the days\nwhen an American soldier would knock on the door of somebody, the Germans\nwould be terribly fearful of what could happen. | didn't recognize her and | asked for\nher father to come down. And he too was shaking, until he recognized me and |\nrecognized him. And he had been a very decent guy, a very strong anti-Nazi and\nso | said to him, \"You can stay in my house. But tonight my driver and | want to\nsleep in the adjoining room.\" Which he, of course, gladly arranged forus. And then\n| drove to the other end of the village because my mother had had a driver who was\na radical anti-Nazi. And he himself had served as a prisoner in the concentration\ncamp of Dachau for some months. And | wanted to see him and, if possible, help\nhim with money or whatever | could do for him. He had been, he had become a\nFritz Schnaittacher 21\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 21\nprisoner of war so he wasn't back yet, but his wife was back and | helped her out with\nsome money. And then | drove back to my house and by then, as coincidence would\nhave it, that the gendarme who had arrested me in 1933 was there to welcome me\nback. Of course, | didn't shake his hand and he had, | didn't hold it against him\nbecause he had acted on orders, which he couldn't refute in 1933. Then | drove the\nfollowing day, no, | ordered the gendarme to bring to me the Mayor and to bring to\nme other people whom | had suspected that they had removed the last few Jews and\nhad sent them to Dachau, or to Auschwitz. And so the Mayor came and | ordered\nthe Mayor to give instructions to the town crier that all Jewish property that they had\nstolen should be brought back to the Mayor's office. Nothing came. Then | drove\nto Schnaittacher in order to visit my father's grave and to instruct the Mayor of\nSchnaittacher to repair the cemetery because many of the gravestones had been\nused for construction purposes. And again | drove back to my village and\napprehended a guy who definitely had been involved in the Chrystalnaught (ph).\nAnd | turned him over to the CIC. So at least | found that | had fulfilled some deep,\ndeep wishes of revenge.",
        "Q: Well tell me about that. What was going through your head as you were doing\nthese things? What was the motivation for you?",
        "A: Revenge. Deep, heart-felt revenge. These bastards, without any justification,\nhad brought so much suffering on innocent people. What! did was unusually mild.\nOf course, | could have been subject to military correction, you Know? Because |\ndid not have the necessary authorization to pursue them. And indeed it came into\nFritz Schnaittacher 22\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 22\nbeing. A friend of mine was at 7\" Army Headquarters in Heidleberg (ph) and | had\nto go to Heidleberg (ph), whether it was on the occasion when | was decorated, or\nwhatever the reasons were, and this friend of mine who had come from the town of\nEarlong (ph) and who was a German/Jew, and he saw me pass in the car, pass his\noffice, and he called me in. And he said, \"Fritz, you'd better be mindful of the fact\nthat the next time you come to Earlong (ph), the town major is going to have you\narrested.\" So | said, \"Well, look, it wouldn't be the first time. After all | had been in\nprison here in Earlong (ph).\" So indeed | was looking for the opportunity to go to\nEarlong (ph) and | went to the town major's office, American town major, and | said\nto him, \"| understand you are looking for me. Here | am and it wouldn't be the first\ntime that | have been in prison here.\" So he said, \"No, no, but you've got to go\naccording to .\" So, okay. | then went to the prison where | had been\nin prison and the warden was still the same. And | think he recognized me. And\nhe said, \"Well now a different sort of people are in prison.\"",
        "Q: Can | take you back to Dachau for a moment?",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "Q: We went over that quite quickly and I'd like you to tell me, what do you remember\nabout that, what the timing was and when you were there, what you saw, what you\nheard?",
        "A: Yeah, very good. You raise good questions. It was, dust began to settle. And\n| was as usual at my regimental headquarters, which wasn't in the camp, it was\noutside of the camp. But | received the orders to come to the camp in order to\nFritz Schnaittacher 23\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 23\ninterrogate that Brigadier General. And as | approached the camp, and there were\nthe freight trains outside of the gate, and as | came to the camp headquarters there\nwere a lot of prisoners. And the living prisoners looked worse than the dead ones.\nAnd they, some of them had cornered a German in uniform and they really wanted\nto do away with him. And | tried to stop them, which | shouldn't have. Then | went\ninto the camp headquarters where | met with that Brigadier General. And then\nthereafter | went back to the headquarters of my regiment.",
        "Q: What day was this event, do you know? What day?",
        "A: What day?",
        "Q: What was the date?",
        "A: | think it was April 30, 1945. And then the following day | didn't get into the camp\nanymore. But moved on to Munich, and we took Munich. On the way, | do\nremember that, a few incidences. Some anti-Nazis made contact with us. The\nimpression | had was that they were left wing underground. Another incident was\nwhen | came across a kid who had come out of the concentration camp and he was\nin the home of some German where we had established a temporary headquarters.\nTemporary being only maybe an hour or two. And there was a woman, and | said,\n\"| want you to take care of this boy.\" | asked him, \"Where are your parents?\" He\nsaid, \"| don't know.\" | asked, \"Where are you from?\" He answered, \"| don't know.\"\nAnd I'm going to show you something.",
        "Q: Tell me what this is. Can you describe this to me?\nFritz Schnaittacher 24\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 24",
        "A: We're looking at a piece of newspaper, The New York Telegram, of April 4, 1945.\nAnd it reads, \"A-shop-en-borg (ph), Germany. April 3. American powers\nshattered even the nerves of one of Germany's most fanatical commanders. A\nfriend of Adolph Hitler and today the last resistance East, in A-shop-en-borg (ph).\nAfter six days of attack, a Nazi Commander, a Major Lambert (ph), immaculately\ndressed in grey-green cap, neatly pressed trousers and riding boots\nstepped out together with his command staff of 100 selected officers, many carried\nwhite flags. When they reached the American lines, Major Lambert was sent in a\njeep to a school house where a Colonel O'Brien was waiting with two interpreters,\nFirst Lieutenant Fritz Schnaittacher, New York City, and Second Lieutenant Fred\nKaufmann (ph), Fritzi, Port Arthur, Texas. The Nazi Commander, his spirit broken,\ntold the Americans, 'You Americans don't fully appreciate the real power that's in you.\nWe do now, at long last.\"",
        "Q: Who had clipped that for you?",
        "A: Dottie, sure. And this is a picture of what | once looked like. And it says, \"With\nthe 7\" Army, Germany. First Lieutenant Fritz Schnaittacher of New York City was\nawarded the Bronze Star Medal for Meritorious Service in connection with military\noperations against the enemy by Lieutenant General Hi-slick (ph), Commander of\nthe 7\u00b0 Army. Lieutenant Schnaittacher is the son of Mrs. Freda Schnaittacher.\"",
        "Q: Yes, wonderful.",
        "A: And what | did want to mention yet, on the lighter side, after we had taken Munich,\none of our battalions was headquartered in the apartment of Eva Braun. And so, of\nFritz Schnaittacher 25\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 25\ncourse, we liberated things that had some significance, like letterheads, but\nsomehow they all disappeared.",
        "Q: Let me take you back just a bit, about Dachau again, if you don't mind?",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: I'm wondering, obviously your family had had experiences there. Your Uncles\nhad been inthe camp. You must have been aware that you were entering this place\nwhere they had been. I'm wondering what emotions you might have been feeling at\nthe time? What were you thinking?",
        "A: Well as | tried to say earlier in connection with the experience with Hermann, that\nit was just unbelievable that | should be able to participate in the liberation of this\nworst German concentration camp. _| think it was worse than Buchenwald and any\nnumber of other German concentration camps. __It didn't compare with Auschwitz, so\n| felt deeply, deeply gratified and | tried to bring that out in the letter that | wrote to\nDottie.",
        "Q: Had you heard from the people from your regiment who had gone in the day\nbefore what the conditions were? What did you know about the camp when you\nwent there?",
        "A: No, you know, to my best knowledge we were the first ones. But Dachau made\nan enormous impression upon me from the very earliest days on, it was the first\nconcentration camp that the Nazis created. That's where friends of mine were killed\nback in 1933. Killed, shot while attempting to escape. From the personal point of\nFritz Schnaittacher 26\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 26\nview, no spot could have given me more satisfaction that | should be able to\nparticipate in liberating it.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you tried to intercede with the group of captives... .?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What happened? What did you try to do and what happened?",
        "A: It was stupidly humane. I'm ashamed of it that | should have interceded. Where\ndo you want to go from here?",
        "Q: You tell me. Where would you like to go?",
        "A: Well, this is 1945. Do you want to develop more of the story of German/Jewish\nrefugees living in America?",
        "Q: Well, yes, we can get to that. Tell me, just wrap up the rest of your,\na little bit for me on before you came home and all that. You mentioned the research\nyou've been doing in the archives?",
        "A: Right. And that wasn't a, our screening of the archives in pursuit of the case again\nwas not successful. We couldn't find anything. On the other hand, |\ncame across some absolutely inhuman documents of a young child who was maybe\n13 or 14 years old and he describes the gift that his father gave him, which was arrival\nin a Jewish prison to do target practice. We couldn't identify this particular individual,\nbut still that was a letter that we came across. [End of side 1 of tape 2]. Thereafter,\nit wasn't too long before a degree of disillusionment began to set in. Disillusionment\nfrom the point of view that we had nothing to do. And | was stationed in a beautiful\npart of Germany, Arch-wipe-vah (ph), and there were beautiful spas nearby. And\nFritz Schnaittacher 27\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 27\nthen the news reached us of the atomic bomb and meant, sort of concluded the\nlikelihood of a military career, unless | would have volunteered to remain in Germany\nwith the occupational force. Which | didn't. | wanted to get back to my wife. She\nhad hoped that possibly there could be the opportunity for her to come to Europe but\nthat didn't pan out. And then, of course, | had to assume responsibilities in the\nbusiness that ultimately | became the head of.",
        "Q: How did you come home? When did you come home from the war and how did\nyou get there?",
        "A: By the way, | flew over and | came home by a relatively small boat, and it was a\nstormy trip. But it didn't bother me and | think it was either late November or the\nbeginning of December, and Dottie expected me. And, of course, there was a\nglorious welcome. And then not too long thereafter, we took really our first\nhoneymoon by going to Mexico.",
        "Q: Where did you sail from and where did you land, when you came home?",
        "A: Good question. We left from Belgium, from All-vair (ph) and we arrived in the\nPort of New York.",
        "Q: And she was right there?",
        "A: No. That couldn't be arranged. But let me see, | forgot. How did | get to my\nmother's house? That! forgot. And from there | made contact with Dottie.",
        "Q: Do you remember where you were when you first saw her again?",
        "A: | think she came to my mother's house. | think so.",
        "Q: Let me pause here for a second. What is that you are reading?\nFritz Schnaittacher 28\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 28",
        "A: Reading: \"Yanks enter Nuremberg, first shelling Lab-sig (ph).\". You know, Lab-\nSig (ph) is inthe east. \"Lab-sig (ph) was expected to fall soon, along with Nuremberg\nwhere the 45\" Division,\" that was my Division, \"of Lieutenant General Alexander\n7\" Army was fighting through the heart of the city after a surprise assault\nfrom the Northeast. The Germans had expected Nuremberg to be attacked from\nthe West. To the North, the Army of Lieutenant General William H.\nSimpson reached five miles beyond the Albe (ph) mowing down some of Adolph\nHitler's personal troops sent to hold the river line. Other units . . .\", let's see, this is\nof no, this | don't understand myself. Forth, my village, \"11 miles Northeast of\nNuremberg and , 20 miles northwest were cleared. To the west, French\nforces along the Rhine advanced up to 18 miles during the day and took Offenberg\n(ph).\"",
        "Q: When you got back, you were living in New York City?",
        "A: | was living in, no, | was living in Brooklyn. My in-laws had rented a furnished\napartment from friends of theirs and that's where Dottie and | had opened up\nheadquarters.",
        "Q: And tell me about how that went, when you came back? Did you start working\nright away? Was she working during the war?",
        "A: She was a psychiatric social worker and she worked in Brooklyn for, | forgot the\nname of the agency. And | would imagine that she immediately got time off. And |\ndidn't start working right away. Maybe | took off a week or two weeks, and then after\nNew Years, we went to Mexico where | had some distant relatives, whom | didn't\nFritz Schnaittacher 29\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 29\nknow, but we made contact and ultimately developed a very nice friendship.\nProbably | took three weeks off and | was discharged as a Captain, which was\nnothing unusual because of a friend's got the same incentive to possibly stay on.\nBut | really was disenchanted and possibly in retrospect unjustified so, because my\nfeeling was that we were beginning to get into the cold war. My impression had\nbeen that the Russians had done more than anybody else in bringing Hitler to his\nknees. And the battle of Stalingrad (ph) was the decisive battle in Europe. And it\nwas only two years later, well let's see, in May of 1947 we had our first child, Peter.\nAnd Dottie's mother was kind enough to take care of our son and we left for Europe.\nWe didn't go to Germany, but we left for Europe in August of 1947. Itwasabusiness\ntrip but | had the privilege of taking Dottie with me. And because Dottie's brother\nhad died as a flyer so her mother prevailed upon us not to fly. So it was a two-month\ntrip. And we went to Holland, Scandinavia, Switzerland, France. In France, we\nmade contact with a relative who had survived the war in France. She and her\nhusband, but she lost her son, one of her sons whom the Gestapo picked up and\nwho never returned. That was 1947. Then my foreign travels were more directed\nto Central and South America where | tried to build up, and succeeded in doing so,\nan export business.",
        "Q: What kind of business?",
        "A: We manufactured surgical dressings, gauze bandages, gauze, silk and cotton,\nadhesive bandages. Not to say Band-Aids, etceteras. But in the years to come,\nour ambition began to grow and we covered Australia, New Zealand, Iran, Lebanon,\nFritz Schnaittacher 30\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 30\nIsrael, Germany. Not only to sell, primarily to buy from Germany. And ultimately |\nsold the business in 1972 and my son, Peter, is still with the company, or what's left\nof it.",
        "Q: You had other children?",
        "A: Yes, | have Richard, who is our middle son. He lives in Richwood (ph), New\nJersey. And he is particularly gifted in many ways and also in difficult languages,\nlike Chinese and Hebrew. And Paul, who had been a psychiatric social worker like\nhis mother, but got burned out and he has become an excellent photographer.\nThat's my family. And | have grandchildren.",
        "Q: How many?",
        "A: Five.",
        "Q: How much did you talk to your family, to your wife, to your sons, about your\nexperiences during the war? How important was that in shaping your lives?",
        "A: Not too much. | gave each one of my sons copies of the one that Washington\nmade.",
        "Q: ?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: But before that you hadn't talked about it with them much?",
        "A: To a very limited degree.",
        "Q: Do you know why?\nFritz Schnaittacher 31\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 31",
        "A: No. You know even though one of my sons had, the photographer, had asked\nme to write up my memoirs. And | started to. Today they have their own lives to\nlive. But particularly because of the death of Dottie's, | soeak to them daily.",
        "Q: Did you remain active in any veteran's groups?",
        "A: At the very beginning there was a progressive veterans group. What was the\nname of it? | could not see myself joining the American Legion or any organization\nsuch as this and the veterans group which | did join, that's no longer in existence.",
        "Q: Is it a strong part of your identity, that you fought in the war? | mean, does that\nform a strong part of you in any way?",
        "A: Well it is interesting, | don't have too many friends who had been in the war. And\nthe ones that had been in the war and that | see, somehow we talk about it.",
        "Q: Is it a painful thing to talk about?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Tell me about your friend Fritzi.",
        "A: | met Fritzi in what we use to call the dust bowl of Naples. In our regiment, our\ndivision was being mobilized for the invasion into Southern France. And Fritzi, who\nhad been abroad from Africa on, through Sicily, Cer-learn-no (ph), Ansio (ph), he\nhardly had missed any landing in any campaign. And experience had taught him\nthat most important is to have food because very frequently during these campaigns\nthe regiment would outrun the kitchen and you had to live off the land. So he said,\n\u201cLieutenant, we've got to keep soul and mind together. And we are going to go to\nthe ration dump.\" The very first day that we were getting ready to go aboard ship in\nFritz Schnaittacher 32\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 32\nthe afternoon, and he said, now you have an interesting story to tell because you\nonly came from America a few days ago, and these guys were guarding the ration\ndump, anxious to hear this story. So you keep them fascinated with your story while\n| go into the ration dump and when | see, by then it had been dark, when | see some\nboxes that look interesting and promising, I'll whistle, you'll follow my whistle and I'll\nthrow the boxes across the fence. A very tall fence. So | followed his instructions\nand there | can catch one box, two box, three boxes. And we saw ourselves eat\ncanned chicken for days to come. We couldn't wait, but we had to wait because you\nwere not allowed to strike a match or a flashlight. So we couldn't wait until the\nfollowing morning when we woke up aboard ship. And what did we get? The boxes\nwere in our jeep. We got three boxes of canned peas. But we lived through it.\nAnd we exchanged the peas for other stuff, as it was customary. Interesting was\nthe very first day that we were aboard ship, about to land, and he was ahead of me.\nAnd | saw my first German prisoners. At that moment | could have killed every one\nof them. Until | was able to talk to them. And then that disappeared. And having\nbeen totally inexperienced in the, not just the art of questioning, but what kind of\ninformation we wanted to have, | got the most important strategic information, how to\nend the war within a matter of days. And, whereas, Fritzi had known the regimental\nCommander, a Colonel O'Brien, for a long time and he had gained his confidence.\nThe Colonel came to me and said, well what do you know? And | told him that.\nAnd, without changing the expression of his face, he turned away from me and said,\nFritz Schnaittacher 33\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 33\nFritzi what do you know? Well, that didn't last long. | learned. But! never forget\nthat one.",
        "Q: And you two stayed together for much of the rest of the war? You two were in\nthe same... .?",
        "A: Same regiment. Yes, we were together.",
        "Q: You're still in fairly close contact with him?",
        "A: Every Saturday at ten minutes to ten, my time. Ten minutes to seven his time.\nThere is a call. Either | get to him before he will or the other way around. Butit'sa\nvery, very brief conversation. Particularly because he, his wife is quite sick and he\ntakes care of her. And its of some significance too, she also worked for the War\nCrimes Commission. A very highly intelligent and very interesting woman. And\nwhen we went, Dottie and |, to Europe the first time in 1947, he joined us together\nwith Greta, his wife, and we had to give our consent.",
        "Q: What do you mean?",
        "A: For them to get married.",
        "Q:|see. Were there other people from the army who you stayed in touch with after\nthe war?",
        "A: Yes there had been. But only, no, let's see, two people, two men. One who\nbecame the supplier of printing supplies and we would meet at his printing shop\nwhich was close to where our office was in Manhattan, around 28\" Street and 5\u2018\nAvenue. And the other man, who started to work for me until he passed away.",
        "Q: And was your mother still alive wnen you came back from the war?\nFritz Schnaittacher 34\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 34",
        "A: My mother lived to a very ripe old age. Unfortunately, in her later years, she\nbecame senile but she lived to be 96.",
        "Q: When you came back and saw her again, she was still in New York at that time?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you talk to her about going back to your town, going back to Nuremberg and\nwhat you had seen and what you had done?",
        "A: Yes. | did.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: Well | don't remember these details but | do remember that she was anxious to\nknow whom | met and my grandmother was alive when | came back. As a matter\nof fact she had the joy of having her children in closer proximity to herself then for\nmany, many years. But it became painful and difficult when my mother had to be\ntaken toahome. And once when | had to play God when she required the possibility\nof an amputation and | had to give the okay.",
        "Q: It seems like your whole family was able to remain close by and also very close\nfor a long time?",

    "answers": [
        "Answer: Okay. Is that comfortable for you? All right. My name is Fritz\nSchnaittacher and we are right now in my home in Rockwell Center, where | have\nlived since 1948.",
        "A: | was born in a little village by the name of Forth, which is 23 kilometers north east\nof Nuremberg. It's between Nuremberg and By-roit (ph). By-roit (ph), the famous\nWagner town where the fesh-beeler (ph) had taken place. And | lived, | was born in\nthis village in July of 1913, shortly before the outbreak of World War |. And hardly\ngot to know my father because he died, to some degree as a result of World War |,\nin 1919 when | was hardly six years old. | lived in the village and went to the\ngrammar school, which then was an all-Jewish school. Which is interesting because\nthe town, the little villages around Nuremberg had become centers of Jewish life\nwhen Nuremberg was not, | mean it was no longer permissible to live in Nuremberg.\nNuremberg was one of the so-called principal cities and it was only, | believe, in the\nmiddle of the 19\" century or early 19\" century that the Jews were again allowed to\nlive in Nuremberg. And that is, at that time, when the Jews began to leave these\nsmall villages. When | grew up, the village had a total population of probably 1,200\nand a Jewish population of maybe ten families, enough to have a so-called Minion\n(ph). But it wasn't long, and | would say it was in my third year of grammar school,\nthat the Jewish community could no longer afford to have the Jewish teacher and\nalso he had doubled as a Huss-in (ph). A Huss-in (ph) is who holds the prayers on\nFritz Schnaittacher 2\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 2\nSaturdays and Jewish holidays. Then the Jewish kids were being transferred to the\nso-called government school, which was in the main, a Protestant school. We also\nhad a Catholic school. And |! went to, | attended the government school for a period\nof two years and then, because of the lack of better educational facilities in the village,\n| moved to a so-called , a boarding house in Nuremberg and from\nthere went to High School. That for a period of six years. Thereafter, | took a job.\nIt is well to mention that on weekends, when | started to work, | would visit my mother\nand Aunts who lived in the village, twenty-three kilometers away. Anti-Semitism\nbegan to become noticeable. And | never forget an incident. Nuremberg had a\ndeep, what do you call it? . A fortification. And we played\nsoccer there. And one guy with a hammer and sickle on his cap came to assist us\nto, to ward off a bunch of Nazi kids.",
        "A: Yes. | was 11 years old and that would have been in 1924. Shalll.. .?",
        "A: There was no provocation on our part. It was simply an attack on the part of these\nNazi kids who recognized us as being Jewish. And they stormed upon us and tried\nto beat us up. But this lonely Communist beat them off and it's an experience which\n| will never forget.\nFritz Schnaittacher 3\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 3",
        "A: They wore swastikas and they called us dirty Jews, etceteras. Now the Nazism\nin certain schools was so strong that it was necessary for the Director of the boarding\nhouse to have me transferred to a school that was less stigmatized and\ncoincidentally, the school from which | had to be transferred was near the courthouse\nin Nuremberg where ultimately the War Crimes Trials took place. It's, there are so\nmany things that are unusual coincidences in my life, that some, that was in 1924,\nand | interrogated the Chief of Staff of the German Army, Ky-kle (ph), in 1945. And\nhe had to get up and salute me. Also one of the many unforgettable incidences.\nTo bring us more up to date, beyond the period of time that | had gone to school, and\nwhen | started to work for a company in Nuremberg and that was in 1930. And it\nwas from then on that | would regularly visit my mother on weekends. This brings\nus to the time when the Nazi propaganda began to become extremely aggressive\nand particularly then, in the year 1932, when in spite of the enormous propaganda\nthat was being put over the German people, Hitler's popularity began to shrink. And\nthere were two elections. One was in the summer of 1932 and one was in the fall\nof 1932. And particularly the election in the fall of 1932 reflected a decrease in the\npopularity of Hitler. Which ultimately then, on January 30\", 1933 led to Hindenberg's\ndecision to appoint Hitler Chancellor of Germany. It was followed up by another\nelection, at the beginning of March of 1933. Which Hitler won only in combination\nwith all the other parties other than the Social Democrats and the Communists. And\nit was so deeply unfortunate that these two left wing parties had failed to really create\none common front. History would have been different, at least my belief. After the\nFritz Schnaittacher 4\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 4\nelection, when Hitler considered himself in sole power of Germany, then the wave of\nAnti-Semitism was enormously increased and this was the time when already Jewish\nstores were being pilfered or destroyed. And it ultimately led to a very important,\npersonal incident. On one of the visits in the middle of March to my mother's house,\n| was hardly at home, when there was a knock on the door and a policeman, the local\ngendarme, came into our living room and said, \"Mr. Schnaittacher, | would like to see\nyou at the police station.\" When | arrived at the police station, he very briskly told\nme that | was under arrest. And again, it was one of these painful, painful moments\nwhen | had to call up my mother, who had a severe cold, and | had to tell her, \"Mother,\nI'm under arrest.\" Well, she was shrieking and she came storming out to the police\nstation protesting that a War widow should be treated like this without any reason\nwhatsoever, but obviously it did not do any good. My village was too small to have\na prison of it's own and so | was transported to the County seat of Earl-la-len (ph)\nwhere | then, as dusk began to settle, was put into a cell in the police prison. And |\nwas being welcomed by four or five other prisoners who had already been in there,\nas a result of having been anti-Nazis, not Jewish, but anti-Nazis. Shall | continue?",
        "A: Right.\nFritz Schnaittacher 9)\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 5",
        "A: No. | had no idea why | was being arrested. However, as | was turned over to\nthe warden of the prison, | requested information. Why | was here. And he then,\neither that night or the following morning, gave me a slip of paper which indicated\nthat | was arrested because of having agitated against the National Socialist\nGovernment because of knowledge of secret ammunition depots and liaison of illegal\nanti-Nazi organizations. Now, actually, yes | was an anti-Nazi. I was no longer\ninvolved in anti-Nazi activities. So the actual reason was to provide the local\npopulace of the village with a degree of satisfaction, to have me arrested as a Jew.\nAnd another cousin of mine who was the only other young male Jew in the village.\nAnd it was quite an experience. As | was given the easiest job in the prison, and\nthat was to fill, we didn't have running water in the cells, but each one of us would get\na water pitcher. And it was my job to fill the water basins that we used to wash\nourselves with. And to fill these pitchers with water. And in doing so, | turned\naround and there sits my cousin in the adjoining cell. Well we had a very friendly\ngreeting, and surprising so. The moment that! had gotten into prison my mother did\nnot rest for a minute and pursued every possible approach in order to have me\nliberated, as well as my cousin. And then followed some six weeks later and | was,\nwhich would make it the beginning of May, and, no, it made it the end of April.",
        "A: When | was released from prison, my cousin as well. And | was on parole for two\nmonths, which meant that | had to report to a police station every other day. Shall |\ncontinue?",
        "A: Well we would have seminars to gain an understanding of what it would mean, of\nwhat Nazism meant and what it meant not only to the Jews but the people at large.\nThe total oppression of several areas and after all, when, | want to be sure that is\nright. When Germany finally collapsed there were over 300,000 non-Jewish\nprisoners in concentration camps in Germany. And the anti-Nazi forces were, they\nwere primarily the Social Democrats and the Communists. And who really fought\nHitler physically and with all the idealism and principal and firmness possible. But |\nhad the opportunity, after | was released not only from prison but from the parole, to\ntravel as a salesman within limited scope. Not by car but by train. And | never\nforget that some very simple people who had taken the same train | did in the vicinity\nof Munich, that they expressed without fear when they recognized me as a Jew, that\nHitler is the enemy of all of Germany. By the way, | failed to, when | corrected myself\nbefore with regard to the time that | left prison. And because of the danger of again\nbeing re-arrested in Nuremberg, | left Nuremberg and moved with an Uncle of mine\nFritz Schnaittacher 7\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 7\nin Munich. And it was May 1%, 1933. The reason that | am pointing out in this very\ninteresting coincidence, | came back to Munich on May 1*, 1945, as the conquering\nAmerican soldier after having liberated Dachau. I'm not speaking of myself but my\nregiment, my division, and it was to be sure one of the greatest moments in my life.",
        "A: Well, yes, there was the fear that one could be re-arrested and then it would not\nhave been a police prison but it would have meant to be sent to the concentration\ncamp of Dachau. Now Dachau at that time was not an extermination camp but it\nwas a camp of terror. And personally violent persecution. At that time the, a few\nfriends of mine were shot in Dachau. And the proverb, if you can call it that, was\ncreated: shot while attempting to escape. Now, so | lived in Germany having been\nrelieved from the duty to report to police stations, and | had the goal, as soon as\npossible, as early as possible, to be able to leave Germany. And particularly so\nbecause on a visit to Nuremberg, not to my village, | had arranged, my mother had\narranged to meet me in Nuremberg in order to spend a pleasant weekend together.\nWhen she came home from that visit, she was ordered by the Mayor of the village to\ncome to the village counsel and she was told, Mrs. Schnaittacher, if you have been\nhere today, during the day or yesterday, we would have arrested you. We give you\nthe opportunity to defend yourself. My mother had been extremely courageous and\nFritz Schnaittacher 8\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 8\nshe screamed at them that if they wanted to arrest her, they should do so right now\nbecause the following day she was going to leave the area to live with her mother.\nAnd that's what she did. And that, the , the precarious actions of my\nmother, and my Uncles and Aunts, was my never-ending burden and sorrow here.\n| had, and that is, goes for so many of the refugees. We had an interesting,\nrewarding time here. Cost of living was extremely low and even though | only\nearned at the beginning $13.00 a week, it was fully adequate to keep me alive. And\nto enable me on weekends to go hiking and we had a wonderful time. It is interesting\nto note that this now is the late fall of 1933. My brother had lived here already. He\ncame, not because of the Nazis, in 1929 at the behest of an Uncle of mine, who lived\nhere, had lived here for some years and had a going business and was not married\nand therefore didn't have any other children. And my brother entered his business\nand later on | joined him. We lived in the utmost of comfort, earning $13.00, $15.00,\n$17.00 a week. On 96\" Street and Western Avenue. Across the street from the,\nwhat's the name of the hotel? The Hotel Paris, which had a swimming pool and we\ncould go swimming every night, for 25 cents. And it was really a wonderful way of\nliving. Burdened only by our concern for our in Germany.",
        "A: Yes indeed. There was my mother, two spinster Aunts on my father's side.\nThere were two brothers of my mother's who were married. And one of them had\nthree children. And my mother insisted that | should leave as soon as possible after\n| was able to get a visa. And | left with a great deal of reticence because of leaving\nmy mother over there, but she promised that she would visit me. And indeed she\ndid the following year. And stayed in America for over six months. Then because\nof her love for her mother and the feeling of obligation that she had for her, she came\nback to Germany in order to take care of her mother. And it was then, only after the\nCrystalnaught (ph), after my mother suffered a nervous breakdown, that she and her\nmother, and Uncles and Aunts and cousins, all ultimately were brought over here.\nSo we were extremely fortunate that we didn't lose anybody in the Holocaust.\n[End of Side 1 of Tape 1]",
        "A: Right. So this brings us up to 1939. And when my mother was the first member\nof the family after myself to then come back in order to remain here. And we hada\nsmall apartment on Western Avenue and 80\" Street. And then we, where some\ncousins had lived, and myself. And when my mother came, we rented, no, first she\nstayed with my Uncle, and then later on when her mother came as well, we rented\nan apartment on 151% Street and Broadway. Which is the southern part of\nWashington Heights. And at that time it was just a wonderful neighborhood. You\nnever, day or night, you would never fear of any attack or of any incident. And so\nmy brother, who by then had gotten married and his wife was pregnant, and |, and\nFritz Schnaittacher 10\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 10\nmy mother and grandmother, we lived in a five room apartment. And then, when\nother Uncles and Aunts came, we just doubled up. There was never any complaint.\nThere was only the utmost of happiness, to have succeeded in bringing our relatives\nout of Germany. And even as far as, which is of some significance with regard to\nthe question that has been raised, the integration of refugees into American life.\nThere was an Aunt of mine who then was in her late 30's or early 40's, and she didn't\nhave any children. And she and her husband, through another friend of theirs,\nstarted to pull threads out of pieces of cloth in order to separate them. And they\nstarted to do that in our dining room. And from there they developed a business\nwhere ultimately they employed some forty people on 26\" Street and Broadway.\nAnd when my Uncle and Aunt ultimately died, they took care of their nieces and\nnephews, not having had any children of their own. And that went for ever so many\nof the people, that no job was low enough as long as they were able to sustain\nthemselves. Whether young women that worked in households, or in factory jobs,\nnotwithstanding, very good educations. And this, | think, is one of the unique\naspects of this immigration.\n2? What did they tell you about what was going on and what their\nexperiences were?",
        "A: Well that's a very good question because it leads me to one of the most satisfying\nexperiences that | had. As | had mentioned early, | had worked for my Uncle who\nFritz Schnaittacher 11\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 11\nhad a wholesale business of glassware and chinaware located in Munich. And\nwhen he came over here, he told me the following story. When he approached as\nit was customary his place of business on the morning of the Crystalnaught (ph), the\nmanager of the business, not Jewish, to wnom | had been reported when | worked\nfor him, was standing at the entrance to this business in the uniform of a storm\ntrooper, and said, \"Jews are not allowed here.\". And my Uncle did not protest\nbecause he recognized the threat that was behind him and he turned around, went\nhome, and within a few hours a Nazi knocked on his door and arrested him and took\nhim to Dachau. And the same thing happened to his brother, who lived some\nhundreds of miles away from where he lived. So my two Uncles were taken to the\nconcentration camp and that was in November 1938. And finally they were able to\nget out in January of, | believe January of 1939. The Uncle with whom | had lived,\nthe one who had lived in Munich, because of the totally inadequate clothing that they\nreceived in Dachau, suffered severe circulatory problems and that\u2019s what he died\nfrom some years later. But this is the story that he told me. So now, we go back,\nor we advance to the year 1945. Fritz, as a member of the 157'\" Regiment of the\n45\" Division, contributed to the conquest of Munich. And as soon as | had the time\nto follow up on this story which | told you, | went into my Uncle's place of business\nwhich had been bombed out, but people were there. And | inquired for the name of\nHermann. Hermann was the name of the fellow who had been the manager of my\nUncle's business, who was responsible for sending him back home and having him\narrested and taken to Dachau. And so this is now May 1945. And | finally got\nFritz Schnaittacher 12\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 12\ninformation as to where Hermann lived. And | had the deep, deep satisfaction of\nlocating him, having been an officer | had the privilege of a jeep, and | drove out\nthere. And people gleefully would point in the direction where Hermann lived. And\nthere he was. | recognized him at once. And he just wore pants and long johns.\nAnd | told him in a not too friendly a manner that he should get dressed. He didn't\nrecognize me. His wife and daughter protested vehemently. And | took him to the\nCIC Headquarters in Munich where | interrogated him. And fortunately for me,\nbecause here | was on a war of my own, and which was not allowed, but | found out\nthat he had been the guard in a concentration camp. Which made him subject to\nautomatic arrest. Eisenhower had declared the so-called automatic arrest category\nand you as an American soldier could arrest anybody who was guilty of certain\ncrimes, such as having been the guard at a concentration camp. _| didn't tell him who\n| was until | finished the interrogation and | said, \"Do you know who | am?\" And he\nsaid, \"No.\" | said, \"My name is Schnaittacher.\" So he said, \"But you should know\nhow much | did for your Uncle.\" So | said, \"Yes, indeed, | do know.\" And with that\n| turned him over to the CIC, who were less humane than | was and at least he was\nput away in prison for some months. The uniqueness of my war experience, | don't\nknow whether, should we talk about that now?\nFritz Schnaittacher 13\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 13",
        "A: Yes. They weren't beaten at that time, yet. But there was totally inadequate\nfood. No heating. And inadequate dress. That is what is uppermost in my mind\nfrom what | remember. My Dad, keeping in mind your possible interest in our\nintegration in American life, that this was also the period of the outbreak of the\nSpanish Civil War. And most of us, of course, or all of us, were most sympathetic\nto the role of the Republican government in fighting Franco. And certainly,\nultimately, in fighting Mussolini and Hitler. And we participated in the collection of\nfunds to support the International Brigade and to render, I'm reluctant to say every\npossible support because we could have volunteered to go to Spain, which | didn't\nand very few of us did, if any. Now of some significance to my life and the lives of\nmy relatives and my mother, | had become involved in Uncle's business. And of\ncourse it was my proud attempt to support as much as possible my mother, my\ngrandmother, my Uncles and Aunts who didn't make a living of their own at the\nbeginning. And ultimately they did. And my mother kept house. And then | had\nto assume much greater responsibility because my Uncle died. And so my brother\nand | became heirs, only to some degree because we had two cousins who, or three\ncousins, who shared in the estate in equal shares. Then we became involved in the\nwar. The company that | was with produced medical supplies, which were being\nused in the war. And most important | met the girl who ultimately | was going to\nmarry. Her father shared office space with me. And ata Christmas party, 1941, |\nrecognized, and | told my mother, that that was the girl | was going to marry. And it\nwas only two and a half months later, two months later, that we got married. And\nFritz Schnaittacher 14\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 14\nyes, all the relatives raised their eyebrows and counted the days. But nothing\nhappened.",
        "A: No. Her father had emigrated from Russia around 1900. Her mother was born\nhere. And then! was drafted in May of 1942. And! went AWOL, do you know what\nthat means? | went AWOL very early on when Dottie visited me in Fort Dix, and we\nspent the night together. Then shortly after basic training, which | took in Cancroft\n(ph), South Carolina, Dottie joined me with a small weekend release. And it grew to\nthe point where we had a steamer truck and a dog and we separated when | was\nflown over to Germany, not to Germany, first to Africa, in July of 1944.",
        "A: Well the training, after basic training, | was transferred and Dottie joined me, to\nFlorida, to an Ordinance Camp. And then | applied for OCS and...",
        "A: Officers Candidate School. From which | graduated in the spring of 1943. And\nthen there was an excess of officers so we were being trained in the cooks and\nbakers school and in an Ordinance Camp, and we traveled from the East Coast to\nthe West Coast. Until January or February of 1944, when Dottie's brother was killed\nas a Marine flyer, he was in training in carrier landings. And | think that probably\nwas February or March of 1944, or February. And then | was sent to Intelligence\nTraining Schools and ultimately my main effort was the interrogation of prisoners of\nwar. So in July of 1944, Dottie and | separated. She went back to New York and |\nFritz Schnaittacher 15\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 15\nwas flown to Italy via Africa. And in order to participate in the landing in Southern\nFrance on August 15, 1944. And that's where | joined the 157\" Regiment and my\nbuddy, Fritzi, who was a Master Sargent, and | had a small intelligence team\nconsisting of Fritzi and a Staff Sargent by the name of Al Magertle (ph), from the\nMiddle West. And after landing in Southern France and moving quickly up to the\nvicinity of the Borsch-Mums (ph) where we arrived in early December or late\nNovember, in a small town by the name of . And we were stuck\nthere until we started our offensive that was really thought to end the war. And that\nwas about March 15, 1945. Now from then on, or within a week thereafter, there\nwas hardly a town or village that was of significance to my family or myself, that we\ndidn't conquer. The first experience of this kind was the town of Ah-shaf-en-berg\n(ph), which is about 100 kilometers from Frankfurt. But the Aunt that | had\nmentioned earlier, she had originated from Ah-shaf-en-berg (ph). And | had\nattended her wedding in 1923 or 1924. And |, together with Fritzi, as interrogators,\naccepted the surrender of this town. And then had some unique experiences in\nbringing about the surrender of more German outfits by apprehending the fortress\ncommander, putting him in our jeep, and wherever we went, he said, put your arms\ndown. A unique little story was some days later, when we were approaching a\nbeautiful, mid-evil town, Bumberg (ph), where | had four prisoners in front of me.\nAnd one of them stepped out and said, \"Lieutenant, didn't we go to school together?\"\nAnd | lifted his helmet, recognized him at once, and said, \"Yes, Lesline (ph).\" Lesline\n(ph) was hisname. \"Wedid.\" And he said, \"Fritz, let me gohome.\" | said, \"I can't.\"\nFritz Schnaittacher 16\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 16\nlf we have time, | could tell a very humorous story which happened the following day.\nWe had taken Bumberg (ph) and we had probably about 500 prisoners in a\nchurchyard. We had more information than they did, there was hardly any purpose\nin interrogating any of them. | just walked around to hear their voices, to hear what\nthey were talking about. And out of these hundreds, one of them came up to me,\nhe saluted, and said, \"Lieutenant, | come from a village not far from here. Couldn't\nyou let me go home?\" So | said, \"Why, where do you come from?\" He said, \"I\ncome from Forth.\" Forth is my village, where | Knew everybody. Where | knew\nevery house number. We didn't have cobblestones, we only had dirt roads. And |\nsaid to him, \"But you weren't born in Forth?\" He said, \"No.\" | said, \"How come that\nyou lived in Forth?\" He said, \"Because | married a girl from Forth.\" | said, \"Whom\ndid you marry?\" He said, \"Gunta Hause (ph).\" | said, \"Gunta Hause (ph)? She\nlived in House Number 35.\" He said, \"Yes.\" And | said, \"And that's two houses\nfrom the little fire house and three houses from the Protestant Church and the\nministries, and if you looked across the street there was House Number 52.\" And\nhis pupils grew wider and wider, he said, \"If American Intelligence has all this\ninformation how can we win the war?\" So now you know how we won the war.",
        "A: Entirely. Entirely coincidence.",
        "A: And a few days later we took Schnaittacher, after which I'm named. And | visited\nin the cemetery where my father is buried. And then two days later we took\nNuremberg where | went to school. And | interrogated the Commander of the town\nof Nuremberg. And then we moved on across the Danube and we came to the\nvicinity of Dachau. And ultimately liberated Dachau.",
        "A: Sure. You never ask a question that can be answered yes or no. You want\ninformation and, by and large, what we were interested in was the strength of the\nOpposing forces. Maybe some names because they would help us in further\ninterrogations. Gun positions. Location of mines. Their plan. And what | did\nforget, and what | was being decorated for, on March 15, 1945, we, one of our\ncompanies took one of the deep bunkers, fortifications, and as they went in and\npicked up the telephone, they heard voices but couldn't make out what was being\nsaid. So my Regimental S2, Intelligence Officer, said, \"This is beyond the call of\nduty, but if you want to go up, we would appreciate it. See what you can make out.\"\nAnd Fritzi and |, we went up and it was a lively night. There was a lot of fire...\nEnd of Tape 1.\nFritz Schnaittacher 18\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 18\nTape 2",
        "A: From the moment that | picked up the phone. If | would have prepared myself in\nraising questions, | couldn't have done better than the two people who were talking\nto each other. One, they were from two German divisions, different divisions. And\none of them gave information such as, that they were leaving the following day in\norder to move in a certain direction giving coordinates. And that they were going to\nestablish their ammunition depot at such-and-such coordinates. A fuel depot at\nsuch-and-such coordinates. If | really would have asked these questions, | couldn't\nhave done any better. And because we didn't introduce, we didn't make any noise.\nWe let them talk. And only at the very end did | try and make an effort to establish\ncontact without indicating who | was, but our voice didn't go through. So we reported\nback to the battalion headquarters and he was not interested in this information. But\nregimental headquarters was and they recorded our findings, our information to\ndivision headquarters and then they send up night fighters and the following day, not\nonly because of the information that we brought, but other information as well, we\nwere able to break through the German lines and advance by over 35 kilometers or\nmiles. And for that | received the Bronze Star. And Fritzi received a Bronze Star\nwith clusters because he already had one.\nFritz Schnaittacher 19\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 19",
        "A: It was quite common in that the U.S. Army trained people who had a intimate\nknowledge of the language and even of dialects and geography. And the school\nwas in Cambridgy, (ph) Maryland. That's where the military intelligence training\nschool was and you could be trained, not only as an interrogator, but also in aerial\nphotography and many different aspects of military intelligence. Of course we\nthought that our particular branch was the most successful one. | mentioned we\nliberated Dachau and one of the gruesome experiences was when | was suppose to\ninterrogate a Brigadier General who claimed that he was transferred against his\nwishes to the , the army, instead of .. . no, I'm sorry. That he was\ntransferred against his wishes to the SS from the Army where he had served. And\nhe was, quote, on a rest and recuperation leave. In Dachau, that's some fine place\nfor a rest and recuperation, and he had come from Dachau, er, from Auschwitz, I'm\nsorry. And he said, \"Now, Lieutenant, if you are enraged as to what you see here in\nDachau, here you see a few bodies. There you would have seen mountains.\" And\nthe physically, the worst sight were the freight trains, which were filled with people\nwho had starved to death. | have some pictures, which I'll be glad to turn over.\nWell, the war active combat didn't last much longer and | was then being transferred\nto a camp near Ludwigsberg (ph), which housed a lot of the automatic arrestees and\n| had to interrogate them. And then | was transferred to the War Crimes\nCommission. First, near Frankfurt where we were to review the archives of the\nGerman Army High Command. Particularly, my, and the guys who were working\nwith me, my responsibility was to try and find material that was of significance to Yon\nFritz Schnaittacher 20\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 20\nMar-shot (ph) who was the economic czar under Hitler. Unfortunately, we didn't find\nmuch. Or we didn't find anything that was of significance. During this period of\ntime, whenever | had the opportunity to go back to the village where | had come from,\nas long as it didn't interfere with the obligations that | had, | would do so. And this is\nalso a whole chain of unusual coincidences. It was the first time that | came back to\nmy village. The village that | was born in, my regiment did not conquer. It was an\nengineering company that served the same division as my regiment did. But! didn't\nget through there, so it was in June of 1945 that | was able to pay my first visit. And\nas | approached the village, as | approached the house that | was born in, shutters\nbegan to open and | heard voices saying, Fritz is back, Fritz is back. | came to my\nhouse. | knocked on the door and a young girl looked down from the room where |\nwas born in. And you could hear her knees shake because those were the days\nwhen an American soldier would knock on the door of somebody, the Germans\nwould be terribly fearful of what could happen. | didn't recognize her and | asked for\nher father to come down. And he too was shaking, until he recognized me and |\nrecognized him. And he had been a very decent guy, a very strong anti-Nazi and\nso | said to him, \"You can stay in my house. But tonight my driver and | want to\nsleep in the adjoining room.\" Which he, of course, gladly arranged forus. And then\n| drove to the other end of the village because my mother had had a driver who was\na radical anti-Nazi. And he himself had served as a prisoner in the concentration\ncamp of Dachau for some months. And | wanted to see him and, if possible, help\nhim with money or whatever | could do for him. He had been, he had become a\nFritz Schnaittacher 21\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 21\nprisoner of war so he wasn't back yet, but his wife was back and | helped her out with\nsome money. And then | drove back to my house and by then, as coincidence would\nhave it, that the gendarme who had arrested me in 1933 was there to welcome me\nback. Of course, | didn't shake his hand and he had, | didn't hold it against him\nbecause he had acted on orders, which he couldn't refute in 1933. Then | drove the\nfollowing day, no, | ordered the gendarme to bring to me the Mayor and to bring to\nme other people whom | had suspected that they had removed the last few Jews and\nhad sent them to Dachau, or to Auschwitz. And so the Mayor came and | ordered\nthe Mayor to give instructions to the town crier that all Jewish property that they had\nstolen should be brought back to the Mayor's office. Nothing came. Then | drove\nto Schnaittacher in order to visit my father's grave and to instruct the Mayor of\nSchnaittacher to repair the cemetery because many of the gravestones had been\nused for construction purposes. And again | drove back to my village and\napprehended a guy who definitely had been involved in the Chrystalnaught (ph).\nAnd | turned him over to the CIC. So at least | found that | had fulfilled some deep,\ndeep wishes of revenge.",
        "A: Revenge. Deep, heart-felt revenge. These bastards, without any justification,\nhad brought so much suffering on innocent people. What! did was unusually mild.\nOf course, | could have been subject to military correction, you Know? Because |\ndid not have the necessary authorization to pursue them. And indeed it came into\nFritz Schnaittacher 22\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 22\nbeing. A friend of mine was at 7\" Army Headquarters in Heidleberg (ph) and | had\nto go to Heidleberg (ph), whether it was on the occasion when | was decorated, or\nwhatever the reasons were, and this friend of mine who had come from the town of\nEarlong (ph) and who was a German/Jew, and he saw me pass in the car, pass his\noffice, and he called me in. And he said, \"Fritz, you'd better be mindful of the fact\nthat the next time you come to Earlong (ph), the town major is going to have you\narrested.\" So | said, \"Well, look, it wouldn't be the first time. After all | had been in\nprison here in Earlong (ph).\" So indeed | was looking for the opportunity to go to\nEarlong (ph) and | went to the town major's office, American town major, and | said\nto him, \"| understand you are looking for me. Here | am and it wouldn't be the first\ntime that | have been in prison here.\" So he said, \"No, no, but you've got to go\naccording to .\" So, okay. | then went to the prison where | had been\nin prison and the warden was still the same. And | think he recognized me. And\nhe said, \"Well now a different sort of people are in prison.\"",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "A: Yeah, very good. You raise good questions. It was, dust began to settle. And\n| was as usual at my regimental headquarters, which wasn't in the camp, it was\noutside of the camp. But | received the orders to come to the camp in order to\nFritz Schnaittacher 23\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 23\ninterrogate that Brigadier General. And as | approached the camp, and there were\nthe freight trains outside of the gate, and as | came to the camp headquarters there\nwere a lot of prisoners. And the living prisoners looked worse than the dead ones.\nAnd they, some of them had cornered a German in uniform and they really wanted\nto do away with him. And | tried to stop them, which | shouldn't have. Then | went\ninto the camp headquarters where | met with that Brigadier General. And then\nthereafter | went back to the headquarters of my regiment.",
        "A: What day?",
        "A: | think it was April 30, 1945. And then the following day | didn't get into the camp\nanymore. But moved on to Munich, and we took Munich. On the way, | do\nremember that, a few incidences. Some anti-Nazis made contact with us. The\nimpression | had was that they were left wing underground. Another incident was\nwhen | came across a kid who had come out of the concentration camp and he was\nin the home of some German where we had established a temporary headquarters.\nTemporary being only maybe an hour or two. And there was a woman, and | said,\n\"| want you to take care of this boy.\" | asked him, \"Where are your parents?\" He\nsaid, \"| don't know.\" | asked, \"Where are you from?\" He answered, \"| don't know.\"\nAnd I'm going to show you something.",

        "A: | met Fritzi in what we use to call the dust bowl of Naples. In our regiment, our\ndivision was being mobilized for the invasion into Southern France. And Fritzi, who\nhad been abroad from Africa on, through Sicily, Cer-learn-no (ph), Ansio (ph), he\nhardly had missed any landing in any campaign. And experience had taught him\nthat most important is to have food because very frequently during these campaigns\nthe regiment would outrun the kitchen and you had to live off the land. So he said,\n\u201cLieutenant, we've got to keep soul and mind together. And we are going to go to\nthe ration dump.\" The very first day that we were getting ready to go aboard ship in\nFritz Schnaittacher 32\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 32\nthe afternoon, and he said, now you have an interesting story to tell because you\nonly came from America a few days ago, and these guys were guarding the ration\ndump, anxious to hear this story. So you keep them fascinated with your story while\n| go into the ration dump and when | see, by then it had been dark, when | see some\nboxes that look interesting and promising, I'll whistle, you'll follow my whistle and I'll\nthrow the boxes across the fence. A very tall fence. So | followed his instructions\nand there | can catch one box, two box, three boxes. And we saw ourselves eat\ncanned chicken for days to come. We couldn't wait, but we had to wait because you\nwere not allowed to strike a match or a flashlight. So we couldn't wait until the\nfollowing morning when we woke up aboard ship. And what did we get? The boxes\nwere in our jeep. We got three boxes of canned peas. But we lived through it.\nAnd we exchanged the peas for other stuff, as it was customary. Interesting was\nthe very first day that we were aboard ship, about to land, and he was ahead of me.\nAnd | saw my first German prisoners. At that moment | could have killed every one\nof them. Until | was able to talk to them. And then that disappeared. And having\nbeen totally inexperienced in the, not just the art of questioning, but what kind of\ninformation we wanted to have, | got the most important strategic information, how to\nend the war within a matter of days. And, whereas, Fritzi had known the regimental\nCommander, a Colonel O'Brien, for a long time and he had gained his confidence.\nThe Colonel came to me and said, well what do you know? And | told him that.\nAnd, without changing the expression of his face, he turned away from me and said,\nFritz Schnaittacher 33\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 33\nFritzi what do you know? Well, that didn't last long. | learned. But! never forget\nthat one.",

        "A: Every Saturday at ten minutes to ten, my time. Ten minutes to seven his time.\nThere is a call. Either | get to him before he will or the other way around. Butit'sa\nvery, very brief conversation. Particularly because he, his wife is quite sick and he\ntakes care of her. And its of some significance too, she also worked for the War\nCrimes Commission. A very highly intelligent and very interesting woman. And\nwhen we went, Dottie and |, to Europe the first time in 1947, he joined us together\nwith Greta, his wife, and we had to give our consent.",

        "A: Well | don't remember these details but | do remember that she was anxious to\nknow whom | met and my grandmother was alive when | came back. As a matter\nof fact she had the joy of having her children in closer proximity to herself then for\nmany, many years. But it became painful and difficult when my mother had to be\ntaken toahome. And once when | had to play God when she required the possibility\nof an amputation and | had to give the okay.",

Munich had changed.\nYou know, these towns, Nuremberg had been devastated and it was fully rebuilt.\nMunich also had suffered enormous damage and that was fully rebuilt. And, of\ncourse, Germany had made enormous headway, economically. | might add that in\ndoing business, having bought from Germans, | made it my business, whether | got\ntruthful answers or not that's another question, but | emphasized the fact that | was\nJewish and that | would not want to do business with Nazis. So, of course, they\nwere not Nazis. You know, | do believe that Germany has made an earnest effort\nto remove the, not the guilt, but to remove anti-Semitism and to be sure they have\nthe policy that any act of anti-Semitism is punishable.\nFritz Schnaittacher 37\n[Date not labeled]\nPage 37",
