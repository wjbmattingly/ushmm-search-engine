        "Question: Why don\u2019t we start, if you\u2019re ready.",
        "Answer: Sure.",
        "Q: Just by a -- having you say your name and identifying yourself.",
        "A: Yes, m-my name is Jan Nowak Jezioranski. The Nowak is the nom de guerre, and\nmy real family name is Jezioranski.",
        "Q: Id like to begin with you telling me where you were, and what was happening in\nyour life at the end of the war.",
        "A: Well, I was the first survivor of the Warsaw uprising who was sent as an emissary\nby the Polish commander in chief of the underground army, and of the Warsaw\nuprising to London, with microfilms, with the archives of the uprising. And the first\none who reached London, on 22\u2122 of January, \u201945. And of course, I did work for some\ntime with the Polish authorities, debriefing them, and also British and American\nauthorities, lecturing, writing, until I was hired by the Polish section of the BBC, in \u201948.\nAnd that was the beginning of my radio career. [sneezes] Excuse me. I was trained in\nmy profession as a broadcaster by the BBC, and I stayed with the corporation until the\nend of \u00b051. And th-then I was appointed the first director of the Polish service of Radio\nFree Europe in Munich. And I had to organize the entire operation, all day operation,\nfrom the scratch. I was the first Pole who was hired, and my job was to recruit people to\norganize the operation, to create, you know, the schedule, the programming, and all\nthat, unfortunately. So I started a sort of a second chapter of my life with Radio Free\nEurope, and this was probably, from the perspective of my life, the most important job\nI had. Much more important than during the war, because during the war I was an\nemissary, and I was very active in the Polish underground movement. But as an\nemissary I was rather a witness, an eyewitness of the game between Moscow, London,\nWashington, and I saw the moon from both sides, from the perspective of London, and\nin Warsaw. But I cannot say that I did really influence any -- any decisions or events.\nWhile in the radio, we learned really that we have much greater influence that could\nhave been expected. And I feel, and this is what the audience say, including such people\nas [indecipherable] opposition leaders, that we did have a considerable impact on the\ndevelopment in Poland between \u201952 and \u201989 when -- when Poland was liberated, in a\nway. So this was my most important period of -- of la -- of my life.",
        "Q: I want to talk about that, I -- I'd like to go back to the -- the -- just at the end of -- at\nthe end of the war, w-where you were --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- a-and -- and -- and what you were doing. I understand you were arrested?",
        "A: I was -- I was only once arrested by Swiss authorities, when my wife and I illegally\ncrossed the border. I was very lucky; I was never arrested by Gestapo. If I would be\narrested Gestapo, I would probably not be here. But I was very lucky, and never --\n2September 18, 1996\nnever really fall into the hands of -- of Gestapo, but when we crossed the border near\nBasel, we were immediately caught by the Swiss border guards, and arrested.",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: This was the end of \u201944. It was just, you know, the -- the end of \u201944, and the very\nbeginning of \u201945. And under pressure from British, we were released by Swiss, and\nallowed to cross into France, which was already liberated. And from France by the\nmilitary plane, we are -- we were taken to London.",
        "Q: So when the war ended, you were in London?",
        "A: I was in London.",
        "Q: And can you tell me what -- what was going through --",
        "A: Well, a-as I told you already, I was -- my job was really, to tell British and Polish\nabout the situation in Poland. The history about the Warsaw uprising. This was the\ntime before Yalta, and before the formation of the puppet su -- Polish government in\nWarsaw. So we -- we were at that time deeply involved in -- in a very desperate\nstruggle to really prevent what happened in Yalta. In other words, to s -- to rescue the\nindependence of the country. And that took me my first -- first years in London. And I\nmainly was focusing -- focusing on what was going on in Poland. I was a kind of a\nadvisor to the Polish exiled government, which still existed.",
        "Q: And where were you living for the brief period after the war?",
        "A: In London.",
        "Q: In London, how long did you live in London?",
        "A: Until 50 -- until the end of \u201951. In other words, I spent six years in London.",
        "Q: And how would you say your life changed after the war ended?",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, I was in exile. All my plan, my -- really, my -- my objective, I\ndid want to be -- to be a scholar, an economist, and I was just on the point of finishing\nmy doctorate thesis when the war broke out. That was all lost. I had no chance, and no\nwish even, to return to my scholarly career. Frankly, you know, the objective was how\nto regain freedom for my country. And that was the main objective and there were only\ntwo -- two ways of -- of doing something. One was to try to influence public opinion in\nthe west, a-and the governments in the west. And that was very difficult at that time,\nbecause immediately after the war. Still some kind -- the hopes existed that -- that\nwartime friendly relationship with Russia could continue. And second was, to try to\ninfluence and educate people in Poland. And the -- the only way of doing it was by\nradio, because in Poland there was a monopoly of media in the Communist hands. And\nthe only way people could learn truth, and learn about even their own situation was by\nlistening to foreign radio. So it suited me very well to join BBC because I had a chance\nto broadcast to Poland, although the contribution was negligible because the British\nreally did not allow so-called exiles to make any [indecipherable] contribution. Most\nof the programs were written by British, and our job was simply to translate it into\nPolish, and to deliver it.\n3September 18, 1996",
        "Q: I could interrupt you for one second, I\u2019m going to readjust this. So for those six years\nyou were working for the BBC in London, and --",
        "A: You know who I was working for s -- no, I -- for the BBC I wor -- I worked fr-from\n-- since \u00b048 until the end of \u201951, for three years.",
        "Q: What about the years from \u00b045, the end of w -- the war [indecipherable]",
        "A: I already told you that I worked for the Polish government in exile, I mean, this is the\nanswer, I mean --",
        "Q: Okay. Did -- when was the first time you went back to Warsaw?",
        "A: After 45 years, the first time I was in Warsaw in a -- a -- at the invitation of Lech\nWalesa on the 10\" anniversary of the Solidarity, or Solidarnose. And that was at the\ntime when the first non-Communist government of Poland was being formed. So it was\n-- I was there, yeah, I went to [indecipherable] to see for myself, on 20 -- on 30 of\nAugust, \u201989, after 45 years.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what that was like?",
        "A: Well, 1-1t was a very moving experience. For 45 years as the director of Radio Free\nEurope, I was on the top of the blacklist as the enemy of Communist. And of course, I\ncould not go back. And I never -- I was convinced that one day Poland will be free\nagain, because I sensed that the Soviet system has so many inherent contradictions, that\nsooner or later these contradictions will bring down the -- the system. But I never hope\nthat it may happen in my life. And it came unexpectedly really, and without bloodshed.\nAnd the people were -- felt that Radio Free Europe did make a considerable\ncontribution to this bloodless liberation. And so I went privately on the\n[indecipherable] of, I believe it was TWA plane, or a -- or Pan American plane, and\ndidn\u2019t expect any welcome. I -- I thought some members of my family will be there, bu-\nbut I didn\u2019t know that Radio Free Europe did broadcast the news of -- that I will be in\nWarsaw, and the time of arrival, the plane. So, after 45 years, the plane -- I touched\nagain the Polish soil, I was very moved, I saw the terminal with the -- this\n[indecipherable] Warsaw. And I saw many people, crowds of people on the terrace\nand around the building. And I ask myself, why, how\u2019s it? I mean, it\u2019s Tuesday, a\nweekday, why they should be there? And they -- when we were going towards the exit,\ntwo Americans were behind me and they said, there must be a VIP on the boat, because\na group of people are waiting in front of the plane. That was for me. And the entire\nleadership of Solidarity was in the front of the plane, I had fantastic welcome, and -- by\nthis hundreds of people who came to the airport. And the next -- I -- the next day, the\nhostess, my hostess, offered that she will take me to the downtown, to the city. And I\nsaid no, because after all, I was born in Warsaw, and I would like to be -- to see my\ncity alone. I said, you will have a -- it was in suburb -- you will have a problem to find a\ntaxi, because they don\u2019t stop, you have to find the taxi stop. I said, okay, I will manage.\nI went to the main street, and here was a taxi. So I raised my h -- my hand and su -- the\ntaxi stopped. So I jumped in and the taxi driver said I know who you are, because you\nwere on television, on the evening. Okay, he took me to the place which I requested,\n4September 18, 1996\nand the fare was [indecipherable] it was 27 cents, because of the dollar was very high.\nSo I decided, no, I will give him a dollar at least. I gave him a dollar and he said, keep\nthis dollar for yourself. I said, why? How much? He said nothing. Why nothing?\nBecause I was listening to Radio Free Europe for so many years, free, wh -- I -- I want\nto give you -- offer you one free drive. And that was to me very moving, you know, this\none dollar was the best reward I got for 25 years of work [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you go back to your old neighborhood, or your old home?",
        "A: No, Warsaw was destroyed, the house where I lived was rebuilt, but the place where\nI actually lived, nonex -- was non-existing. Where -- so that, no, I could not find any of\nmy old places.",
        "Q: Did your visit to Warsaw bring back memories of -- of the war?",
        "A: Oh yes, definitely, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about that?",
        "A: Well, you know, this was the city when I spent my childhood. My school, times of\nmy -- my high college, and where I spent my -- the time of -- of my underground\nactivities, until I left for the west, what ak -- what more can I say?",
        "Q: Was it -- were they -- the memories, whether it -- was the feeling the positive, or --",
        "A: Well, the po -- feelings -- th-there was a feeling of tremendous happiness, really, that\nI can be back in my own city, among my -- my old people.",
        "Q: In 1951 is when you began --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- working for Radio Free Europe.",
        "A: Radio Free Europe, right.",
        "Q: Where were you?",
        "A: Well, I moved to Munich. I got the housing there, and since that, until -- [phone\nringing]",
        "Q: I was asking about your move to Munich.",
        "A: Yes, well I moved to Munich, it was December \u201951, and took over my job and was\norganizing my -- the Polish service. I was involved in recur -- recruiting people. Run,\ndry run, training them, and organizing the program. The inauguration of our program\nwas on May third, May third, \u201952.",
        "Q: Did your experience in the underground help you in your job as -- as --",
        "A: Oh yes, well it gave me a very good knowledge of the -- of the situation in Poland.",
        "Q: And you stayed as director from 1951 --",
        "A: From 1951 until first of January, \u201976.",
        "Q: During that period is there -- 1s there any one story or any one thing that you\nremember that stands out the most?",
        "A: Look, I mean, there were so many stories. I -- I wrote the book in two volumes. I\ncannot possibly single out one story. There were so many. It was a fascinating life, full\nof stories, and full of, let\u2019s say adventures, different kind that -- during the war. But they\nwere adventures. After all, the -- we had the -- I had several fronts. I worked with the\n5September 18, 1996\nAmerican management and had to argue about the policy with the Americans. I had the\n-- my team, which was very large one. At one moment they were more than 100 people.\nAnd finally, the main front was Communism, I had to -- to fight Communism.",
        "Q: How large was your staff?",
        "A: It di -- it started with about 80 people, but later on 1t was much more -- m-more than\n-- more than 100.",
        "Q: And can you tell me a little bit about the -- the programming, how many hours a\nday?",
        "A: Yes, it was the only all time programming. We did start at five in the morning, and\nwe ended after midnight. It was a sort of a continuation of the free Polish radio which\ndid exist before the war. And we even adopted some features of the Polish radio. For\ninstance, the cra -- the -- the program did end with the Polish national anthem. In the\nmiddle we had, in the Polish radio at noon, they would transmit the so-called\n[indecipherable]. You know, the very old tune, which was played by trumpeter on the\ntop of the tower of the old gothic church in Krakow. We did broadcast this, so in fact it\nwas a kind of a substitute and continuation of the Free Polish Radio. And we had\neverything, first of all news, every hour on the hour. 10 minutes news so that everybody\nin Poland knew that when, with the strike of an hour, you can turn on [indecipherable]\nand he will hear the recent news. There were, of course, political commentaries, round\ntable discussions, press reviews, all kind of, you know, political future, such as you find\nin the public radio, public television. But there was -- there were also the program for a\n-- for a th -- for the country, for the village, for -- for the farmers. And the program for\nwomen, program for workers. There was sport, musical programs, everything that you\nexpect from the normal Polish -- normal h-home radio. This was, as I say, a substitute.",
        "Q: Were you yourself on the air?",
        "A: Oh yes, but not -- not regularly. I broadcast when something really very important\nhappened. I did not broadcast every day, or even every month, but when something of\ngreat importance happened, then I was on the air. And people knew that it was -- that\nthere was some -- something important in that time.",
        "Q: Can you give me an example of -- of one of those times?",
        "A: Well, for instance, in 1956, there were a big upheaval [indecipherable] and the\nRussians did -- or for instance when the Polish [indecipherable] was arrested, which\nwas a big blow against the church, I would go -- go on the air and make my comments\nabout it. When they were anti-com -- anti-Communist party upheavals in October \u00b056,\nthen I would make comments about it. So, whenever there was something very\nimportant, I was on the air.",
        "Q: You -- when you went back to Warsaw, you understood the impact that you had on\nthose lives.",
        "A: Oh yes, because people were telling me.",
        "Q: How -- how did you know what impact you had on people\u2019s lives in Poland during\nthe time that you were broadcasting?\n6September 18, 1996",
        "A: Yeah. Well, in the first place, we did meet people who went to the west. Two, the\nmost important indication of effectiveness were attacks -- propaganda attacks by the\nregime, which were very intense. Attempts to discredit us, discredit me, and jamming. I\nmean jamming was a very expensive operation, and the jamming, that indicated that\nthey considered our broadcast as effective and dangerous. And finally the Americans\ndid have a contract with the measure audience analysis institutions in Demark, in\nAustria, and they were conducting, you know, public opinion polls among people who\nwere coming from Poland. So we had pretty good indications of our effectiveness.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And letters, but we didn\u2019t attach too much importance to letters.",
        "Q: Were any other -- did you stay in touch with any other members of the underground\nthat you associated with during the war?",
        "A: First of all, there was no underground movement after the war. There was for\nsometime, and was eliminated by the political police. But I had my friends, and some of\nthem would, in great secret, contact me when they were in the west. So yes, I did -- I\nwas in contact with my old friends and associates.",
        "Q: Are you still today?",
        "A: Oh, by -- by all means. Y -- y -- even more, because it\u2019s no longer any risk to\nanybody.",
        "Q: Y-You talked about how your experiences a -- underground gave you experience to -\n- to do your job --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- at -- as -- at Radio Free Europe. Can you -- can you talk a little bit about how you\napplied some of those experiences?",
        "A: Well, first of all I believed that I had a very good knowledge of people, of mood, of\nthe situation. Therefore, I could build the program in such manner that it is best tune to\nthe mentality, interests, traditions of the Polish audience, something I could not do in\nBBC. In the BBC, British were deciding what to broadcast and how. Here we had --\nAmericans gave us considerable editorial autonomy. They believed that only free Poles\nknow how to broadcast to their compatriots. And therefore I could use my knowledge of\nthe audience to make broadcast as effective as possible.",
        "Q: When did you come to the United States?",
        "A: I did come to United States in November, \u201977. I spent almost two years in a sort of a\n[indecipherable] we had a small house in Austria in the Alps, [indecipherable] lonely\nhouse, with beautiful views and we spent almost two years there, and I wrote my book\nco -- called, \u201cCourier From Warsaw,\u201d which was later published, in underground in\nPoland and here in United States in English, then also in France, in Holland, in -- in\nSweden. And we spend this two years time, almost, not quite, simply to -- I -- I wrote\nmy -- my wartime memotrs.",
        "Q: And you moved to the United States --",
        "A: In November, \u201977.\n7September 18, 1996",
        "Q: And why did you decided to move to the United States?",
        "A: Because I felt that I still was not old enough to retire, that my personal friend, Dr.\nJezinski was the director of National Security Council, and I did decide that I could\nserve my old country by being here and by trying to influence American policy towards\n-- towards Poland and my part of the world. This was an ideal place, close to the\nadministration, to the Congress. And with -- as I say, with few influential friends.",
        "Q: Zbigniew Brzezinski",
        "A: Was one of them, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But you see, people whom I knew in Radio Free Europe when they were very\nyoung, in the meantime they had high positions in the American life, so I had a lot of\ncontacts.",
        "Q: What -- what was your position when you came here?",
        "A: I became the consultant to the National Security Council, and I was the consultant al\n-- until the present administration. In other words, to the end of President Bush term.\nAnd I became national director of the Polish American Congress, which is an umbrella\norganization. A spokesman for 10 million of American citizens with their roots in\nPoland.",
        "Q: Can I -- can I ask you about your personal life, meaning your wife, and -- and --",
        "A: Well, we met in the underground. She was a liaison girl, she was very active in the\nunderground. And when I came back from my secret trip to Sweden, I brought with me\nthe mail in mi-microfilms. And the liaison girl who came to pick up this film was my\nfuture wife. This is where we met. And we were married during the Warsaw uprising,\nwith the enemy lines only 100 years from the chapel where we married. And since that,\nwe are staying together. It\u2019s 52 years.",
        "Q: Have you had children?",
        "A: We have no children.",
        "Q: Did you leave the Polish American congress at -- at the end of the Bush\nadministration? Have you no -- no longer --",
        "A: No, because the Clinton administration no longer con-continued consultants. There\nwere no consultants. I was de facto consultant, and I am still in daily touch wi -- with --\nwith the -- with the NSC, National Security Council. But I was -- I am no longer on the\nlist of consultants.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you how -- how often you think about the experiences during --\nduring the war, and in the underground, if -- if there are certain things that trigger your\nmemories, music, or food, or --",
        "A: No, because frankly, I wrote my memoirs, I wrote my two books about my career in\nthe radio, and I hoped that I can put it behind me. Unfortunately, then the -- I had the\ninterviews, and people asking, but I prefer to think about the present time and about the\nfuture, rather than about the past. It\u2019s not very productive to live in the past.",
        "Q: So you feel as though writing your memoirs helped you move beyond --\n8September 18, 1996",
        "A: I -- [hoped it will be, but the people like yourself come and ask about my past.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: You had said that your time at Radio Free Europe was the most important time.",
        "A: It was definitely, by far the most important. Frankly, you know, I never thought that\nthe -- the words, as a vehicle carrying ideas and information may have such a\ntremendous impact. A-And first of all, frankly we eliminated effectiveness of\ncensorship, because it was enough to tune to us to learn everything that the censorship\nwas trying to keep from preventing to know, to learn. So we destroyed the monopoly of\nmedia, ne -- monopoly of information and education. As long as this monopoly existed\nand people were isolated from the outside world, and flow of information, th-they could\nhave been brainwashed. But once they had access to free sources of information, they\nwou -- they remained independent in their own mind and in drawing their own\nconclusions. The -- that was our role. Also, we did play a role of opposition and I\ndiscovered that the ruling group fights the opposition by doing what the opposition\nwants them to do. In other words, the [indecipherable] when it is widely known,\ngovernment reacts to the opposition. They don\u2019t want people to believe in what they\nsay. And therefore they try to prove that you were wrong by acting exactly like you\nwant them to act. We -- our first rally, probably it was the most important event in the\nhistory of political broadcasting. After Stalin\u2019s death, and after Beria was -- was killed,\na very high official of the Polish political police, who had -- knew all the secrets -- all\nthe state secrets and party secrets, defected to the west. And after being debriefed by the\nCIA, we could use him and he was broadcasting all the secrets of the party. And th-\nthere were -- the -- the entire Poland was listening. And political -- they had to find\nscapegoats because he was revealing all kind of crimes committed by the leadership. In\norder to defend themselves, they put all the blame on the political police and they -- it\nwas reorganized completely. And the resulting chaos really -- I mean, decreased the\nterror. You know, people were no longer afraid because the entire apparatus of the\nrepressions was paralyzed. And it was bef -- because of the effect of [indecipherable]\nthat opposition in Poland could became much more articulate. They could speak. They\ncould, in a sense, organize themselves. And that was our major contribution.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I -- I was curious ha -- how you at Radio Free Europe dealt with the issue\nof anti-Semitism.",
        "A: Well, you see, right after the war, I believe that anti-Semitism was pretty dormant,\nbut the regime, which was under great attack from the west, for violating democratic\ninstitutions, for forging the election, in a way that they want to -- to compromise the\nPolish people, and there are strong suspicions that so-called [indecipherable] was\ninstigated by the political police in order to, you know, compromise the Polish people,\nbut in fact, th-the sad part of the story is that this kind of provocation is that there was a\nprovocation, did find a fertile ground. There was people who did the -- the d -- the fact,\nhistorical fact is that 42 innocent Jews who survived the -- the Holocaust and lost many,\n9September 18, 1996\nmany of their relatives and friends, were murdered by the Poles in Kielce, and this is\nsomething that I myself, as a Pole, I am very am -- ashamed of. And I believe that we\nshould and we did -- Poland did apologize for it. Then, you know, there was a anti-\nSemitism made in Russia. Stalin -- Stalin was anti-Semi -- was anti-Semitic, and\nshortly before his death, he ran so-called doctor\u2019s plot, accusing his doctors of Jewish\nbackground of plotting against his life. And that was a signal for kind of anti-Semitism\nthat was instigated by Russians in order to divert the attention of people from their\npoverty, from the inefficiency of the Communist regime, and to find a kind of a\nscapegoat. Jews were to be a scapegoat. And this was the kind of anti-Semitism spread\nby the Stalinist faction, called [indecipherable], in the Communist party. And they\nwere opposed by intellectuals, liberal intellectuals. And among the intellectual\n[indecipherable] there were many Jews. And this is when we first really started to fight\nagainst anti-Semitism, \u201954 - \u00b055, after Stalin\u2019s sudden death, when this was the means\nto compromise, liberally minded Jews who were in opposition to the party line, to the\nparty system of work. And there were some very outstanding intellectuals, who were\nopposing this kind of anti-Semitic trend, and we did a lot to support them to\ncompromise the anti-Semitism as a -- something that is imported from Russia. Seeing\nas the people at that time hated Russians, this was probably the most effective way of\nfighting anti-Semitism. We did -- dedicated lot of time and work to it.",
        "Q: You had a lot of programming that --",
        "A: A lot. Scripts, they are still in -- in existence, scripts.",
        "Q: I think you had said in -- in the other interview that the -- your time in the\nunderground was the most fascinating time of your life.",
        "A: It was fascinating. Well, in the underground I had adventures. There wer -- this was\na time a -- war time adventures. And the -- in Radio Free Europe, it was much less\nromantic. We were simply broadcasting, writing program.",
        "Q: What is your attitude now toward -- toward Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Well, first of all, I hate hatred. In other words, I am strongly against the idea of\neternal enemies. The Germans inflicted terrible, you know, blows to Poland. They not\nonly murdered the -- most of the Jewish population, but the -- but about two million\nPoles were killed in the concentration camps. They were executed, or deported. And the\n-- the years of German occupation were years o -- of terrible human tragedies. So\nfrankly, you know, of course I had very strong feelings against the Germans. But after\nthe war, when I was in Germany, I discovered that you cannot generalize, that there are\nalso some Germans who are decent, and who would like to frankly, compensate in some\nway f-for what they did to the Poles. I --I -- well, this is probably a postman. Yeah, I -- I\ncan do -- do it later. And ma -- the only problem I had with the Germans is their\nterritorial claims against Poland, which were extremely dangerous to our existence\nbecause Poland was moved westward. We lost one-third of our territory and our people\nwere annexed by -- by the Soviet Union. And we were compensated by the big powers\nin the west. A considerable part of former Germany was incorporated into post-war\n10September 18, 1996\nPoland. We couldn\u2019t possibly lost it again, it would be then a sort of a remnant state.\nAnd so this was the main problem between the Poles and the Germans, but in 1990,\nGermans recognized the border as final. It was ratified by the parliament. And as of that\ndate, 1t was a turning point. And once the Germans reconciled themselves with the post-\nwar borders, they are no longer a threat and there is a tremendous improvement in the\nPolish - German relationship, which I\u2019m very happy about, because I -- I believe that\nhatred is a boomerang. If you hate other people, they will hate you. And so the\nreconciliation between Poland and Germany, which is very real, 1s probably the best\nachievement of -- of this Solidarity government.",
        "Q: When you see that kind of hatred in -- in Bosnia and other places --",
        "A: Oh, terrible.",
        "Q: -- wh-what -- what does it --",
        "A: Well, you know, this is -- you know, the hatred brings about unspeakable human\nsufferings, loss of life, tortures, everything. Senseless. Senseless. So ethnic hatred, and\nany kind of ethnic or racial prejudices are extremely dangerous to humanity, and to\neverybody, including to Poles also. So Iam very happy that Poland, after it go rid of its\n-- the Communist and Soviet domination is working towards reconciliation with all its\nneighbors, with Germans, with Lithuanians, with Ukrainians, Czechs and so on. And\nrestored all the minority ethnic rights to -- to the -- its -- its ethnic minorities.",
        "Q: In -- in the video interview you did, you talked about how angry you were, that it\nwas a crime that the world didn\u2019t do more to stop the Holocaust, that it didn\u2019t listen.",
        "A: Absolutely. You know, this was my very tragic experience, because frankly, I was\nagain an eyewitness. Of course the Jews were isolated, they were behind the walls. But\nwe could -- I could still see the starving Jews who would escape from ghetto and die on\nthe pavement from -- from starvation. So it was s -- it was a tragedy, human tragedy\nwithout any precedent. We did lose two million ethnic Poles, but only Jews were really\ncondemned to death simply because they were born Jews, and had no chance to survive.\nAnd I was the -- the first envoy who brought this information about the Holocaust, with\nmy colleague, Jan Karski. And then I will -- I followed. I was in Stockholm at the\ntime of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto, and I knew about it, and I wrote a\nmemorandum to the Polish government that they should exert their influence on the\nBritish that some kind of retaliatory measures should be threatened to stop the\nextermination of Jews. And I know that the memorandum was passed to Churchill, but\nhe was not prepared to any -- to any -- the only thing he -- I believe that my\nmemorandum did contribute to the decision to prosecute after the war wa -- German\nNazi war criminals, because soon after the decision was made to install the tri-tribunal,\nand announcements was made that Nazi criminals will be brought to justice. Then I\ncame back, it was July \u201944, and the ghetto no longer existed, but there were many Jews\nin hiding. And I got instructions to pre -- to b -- to prepare myself for my second\nmission to London. And to be briefed, to learn about the whole thing, so that I could\nagain bring about some message, about what\u2019s -- what happened to the Jews. So there\n11September 18, 1996\nwas a man by the name of Volitski, who has his, you know, plaque in Yad Vashem, he\n-- he was -- who was the kind of a liaison with the Jewish militant organization. I spent\nhours with him. He told me all about the -- the uprising and all that. He was himself in\ntouch with it. And I got on microfilms the report of the survivor of the Jewish ghetto\nuprising, and also photographs, documents, which I brought in my secret\n[indecipherable] as microfilms. And I was the one who brought this report of the\nJewish militant organization to London. I reached London in December \u201950 -- \u201943, and\nth-this report was passed by the Polish government to the British government, to the\norganization and I was -- I did see many members of the British cabinet, members of\nthe Parliament, intelligence -- people from intelligence community, and I was telling\nabout what happened to the Jews. And, frankly, you know, as far as the British cabinet,\nthere was no response.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And when I talked to Eden, Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, he told me, Mr.\nNowak, the best way and the only way we can help Jews is by winning the war. If we\ndivert our limited war, you know, military resources to such objectives as bombing the\ntracks, it will delay the end of the war. And you know, when I came back to London\nwith my wife, when I was writing my memoirs, and we went to Her Majesty\u2019s records\noffice, archives, I found piles of documents concerning my mission, including the\nreports from Eden to Churchill about our conversation. Not one word about the Jews.\nNot one word. I took to all of them, I raised the question of Jews. And I -- I strongly\nbelieve that retaliatory measures would have offered at least a moral help. That they\nwould know they are not ignored, that the -- the world 1s -- sees that trad -- trade --\ntradegy -- tragedy. So I feel that -- but even Jews would not believe me. I mean, I wa --\nthere was a Polish Jew by the name of Schwarzbat, who was in the Polish, you know,\nsort of a -- a parliament in exile, and he put me 1n contact with the American Jewish\norganization, Joint and others. And I spent hours with them, they didn\u2019t believe me.\nWhen I said that two million -- at least two million Jews were already killed, they\nthought that this is unacceptable exaggeration, and that I must have some political\nmotives --",

        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: -- to see that changes occurred.",
        "A: Absolutely. I must say that I used this very powerful instrument, Radio Free Europe,\nto fight anti-Semitism. But all -- also we did not generate hatred toward Germans or\nRussians. We were, you know, defending our national aspirations, but the per -- th-there\nwas no purpose of really generating feelings of hatred, because I strongly believe that\nhatred is a boomerang that would hit the Polish people back. And I was pa -- at the\n12September 18, 1996\ntimes when you know the -- the -- there was again the outburst of party anti-Semitism.\nIn times of a man who was in charge of political police, poli -- poli -- by the name of\nMotcha, and he was anti-Semitic. And he really unleashed anti-Semitic propaganda.\nAnd the [indecipherable] of Jews, there were many Jews in the government, many\nJews in the all kind of position, and there were many Jews among the university youth.\nAnd h-he started a campaign of anti-Semitism, like in Russia. And by discrimination,\nby persecution, by threats, he forced these people of Jewish background, who\nconsidered themselves Poles, to leave the country. There was a -- an exodus of young\nJews who didn\u2019t even know they were Jewish. They were completely assimilated with\nthe Polish culture. And there were Polish writers, Polish scholars. And this was again\nunspeakable tragedy for them. And we were going out of our way to at least offer these\npeople a moral help by condemning it. And I had a lot of satisfaction when, for\ninstance, a Polish essayist and -- and writer by the name of Roman Cast, who had to\nleave the country under this kind of purge, and he became a professor at what it\u2019s\ncalled, Brooks -- Stone -- Stonebrook University. He came to mean and said, Mr.\nNowak, if not for Radio Free Europe, I and my daughter wou -- would have committed\nsuicide. And we were on the -- on the verge of doing it. But your broadcast made us\nbelieve that we are not alone, we are not isolated. That our -- and -- and the kind of\nmoral comfort that we got by listening to Radio Free Europe, really, we decided, no,\nwe w -- we will leave the country, we -- but we -- we -- we will live on with all this.\nAnd this was for me a tremendous reward. There were my former colleagues, Jan Kott,\nwho is a very highly respected American scholar, was my schoolmate. He was of\nJewish background. And they were all really highly appreciative of our -- of our efforts.\nAlso, during the Israel six -- Six Days War, we were on the air from the morning until\nnight, and the Israel embassy got I don\u2019t know how many flowers, messages, from our\nlisteners. Because of course, since it was -- since Russia, Soviet Union was on the Arab\nside, Polish people on the -- were on the Jewish side. So I think it was -- I am very\nproud of -- of this effort, which under my leadership was undertaken by Radio Free\nEurope, in fighting hatred and prejudice.",
        "Q: Do you think the world is capable of experiencing a -- the -- the kind of hatred that --\nthat the Germans had, an-and the kind of killings that they carried out during the war?",
        "A: Well, Germans themselves did a lot to weaken this feeling. After all they -- they\nmade the democratic Germany, did not deny what they have done -- what -- what was\ndone in the name of Germans, but they were trying to first of all make truth known to\nevery German.

And I am very happy the Polish gover -- government, after the fall of\ngovernments, are doing their best to seek reconciliation with their neighbors, not only\nwith Germans, but also with pole -- with Lithuanians, for instance.

        "A: Well, I really -- as you said, I worked with all of them, and with their stuff. And I\nmust say that all of them did play a very constructive role in restoring democracy in east\ncentral Europe and in Poland. U.S. policy since the end of 70\u2019s, is a story of success.\nAnd -- and I am non-partisan and I believe that both democratic administrations of\nCarter, and now Clinton, and of Reagan and Bush, contributed greatly to rebirth of\ndemocracy, and regaining sovereignty by these countries. And so to each of them we\nowe some debt of gratitude. I must say that since the time of Woodrow Wilson, no\nother president did more to Poland than George Bush. And this is not my partisan\nview. It\u2019s simply that he was -- got deeply involved in support for Walesa, support for\nSolidarity, and then he made possible take off, successful take off of the free market\n14September 18, 1996\neconomy, by offering considerable assistance, economical assistance, by reducing\ndebts.

        "Answer: Sure.",
        "A: Yes, m-my name is Jan Nowak Jezioranski. The Nowak is the nom de guerre, and\nmy real family name is Jezioranski.",
        "A: Well, I was the first survivor of the Warsaw uprising who was sent as an emissary\nby the Polish commander in chief of the underground army, and of the Warsaw\nuprising to London, with microfilms, with the archives of the uprising. And the first\none who reached London, on 22\u2122 of January, \u201945. And of course, I did work for some\ntime with the Polish authorities, debriefing them, and also British and American\nauthorities, lecturing, writing, until I was hired by the Polish section of the BBC, in \u201948.\nAnd that was the beginning of my radio career. [sneezes] Excuse me. I was trained in\nmy profession as a broadcaster by the BBC, and I stayed with the corporation until the\nend of \u00b051. And th-then I was appointed the first director of the Polish service of Radio\nFree Europe in Munich. And I had to organize the entire operation, all day operation,\nfrom the scratch. I was the first Pole who was hired, and my job was to recruit people to\norganize the operation, to create, you know, the schedule, the programming, and all\nthat, unfortunately. So I started a sort of a second chapter of my life with Radio Free\nEurope, and this was probably, from the perspective of my life, the most important job\nI had. Much more important than during the war, because during the war I was an\nemissary, and I was very active in the Polish underground movement. But as an\nemissary I was rather a witness, an eyewitness of the game between Moscow, London,\nWashington, and I saw the moon from both sides, from the perspective of London, and\nin Warsaw. But I cannot say that I did really influence any -- any decisions or events.\nWhile in the radio, we learned really that we have much greater influence that could\nhave been expected. And I feel, and this is what the audience say, including such people\nas [indecipherable] opposition leaders, that we did have a considerable impact on the\ndevelopment in Poland between \u201952 and \u201989 when -- when Poland was liberated, in a\nway. So this was my most important period of -- of la -- of my life.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I was -- I was only once arrested by Swiss authorities, when my wife and I illegally\ncrossed the border. I was very lucky; I was never arrested by Gestapo. If I would be\narrested Gestapo, I would probably not be here. But I was very lucky, and never --\n2September 18, 1996\nnever really fall into the hands of -- of Gestapo, but when we crossed the border near\nBasel, we were immediately caught by the Swiss border guards, and arrested.",
        "A: This was the end of \u201944. It was just, you know, the -- the end of \u201944, and the very\nbeginning of \u201945. And under pressure from British, we were released by Swiss, and\nallowed to cross into France, which was already liberated. And from France by the\nmilitary plane, we are -- we were taken to London.",
        "A: I was in London.",
        "A: Well, a-as I told you already, I was -- my job was really, to tell British and Polish\nabout the situation in Poland. The history about the Warsaw uprising. This was the\ntime before Yalta, and before the formation of the puppet su -- Polish government in\nWarsaw. So we -- we were at that time deeply involved in -- in a very desperate\nstruggle to really prevent what happened in Yalta. In other words, to s -- to rescue the\nindependence of the country. And that took me my first -- first years in London. And I\nmainly was focusing -- focusing on what was going on in Poland. I was a kind of a\nadvisor to the Polish exiled government, which still existed.",
        "A: In London.",
        "A: Until 50 -- until the end of \u201951. In other words, I spent six years in London.",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, I was in exile. All my plan, my -- really, my -- my objective, I\ndid want to be -- to be a scholar, an economist, and I was just on the point of finishing\nmy doctorate thesis when the war broke out. That was all lost. I had no chance, and no\nwish even, to return to my scholarly career. Frankly, you know, the objective was how\nto regain freedom for my country. And that was the main objective and there were only\ntwo -- two ways of -- of doing something. One was to try to influence public opinion in\nthe west, a-and the governments in the west. And that was very difficult at that time,\nbecause immediately after the war. Still some kind -- the hopes existed that -- that\nwartime friendly relationship with Russia could continue. And second was, to try to\ninfluence and educate people in Poland. And the -- the only way of doing it was by\nradio, because in Poland there was a monopoly of media in the Communist hands. And\nthe only way people could learn truth, and learn about even their own situation was by\nlistening to foreign radio. So it suited me very well to join BBC because I had a chance\nto broadcast to Poland, although the contribution was negligible because the British\nreally did not allow so-called exiles to make any [indecipherable] contribution. Most\nof the programs were written by British, and our job was simply to translate it into\nPolish, and to deliver it.\n3September 18, 1996",

        "A: After 45 years, the first time I was in Warsaw in a -- a -- at the invitation of Lech\nWalesa on the 10\" anniversary of the Solidarity, or Solidarnose. And that was at the\ntime when the first non-Communist government of Poland was being formed. So it was\n-- I was there, yeah, I went to [indecipherable] to see for myself, on 20 -- on 30 of\nAugust, \u201989, after 45 years.",
        "A: Well, 1-1t was a very moving experience. For 45 years as the director of Radio Free\nEurope, I was on the top of the blacklist as the enemy of Communist. And of course, I\ncould not go back. And I never -- I was convinced that one day Poland will be free\nagain, because I sensed that the Soviet system has so many inherent contradictions, that\nsooner or later these contradictions will bring down the -- the system. But I never hope\nthat it may happen in my life. And it came unexpectedly really, and without bloodshed.\nAnd the people were -- felt that Radio Free Europe did make a considerable\ncontribution to this bloodless liberation. And so I went privately on the\n[indecipherable] of, I believe it was TWA plane, or a -- or Pan American plane, and\ndidn\u2019t expect any welcome. I -- I thought some members of my family will be there, bu-\nbut I didn\u2019t know that Radio Free Europe did broadcast the news of -- that I will be in\nWarsaw, and the time of arrival, the plane. So, after 45 years, the plane -- I touched\nagain the Polish soil, I was very moved, I saw the terminal with the -- this\n[indecipherable] Warsaw. And I saw many people, crowds of people on the terrace\nand around the building. And I ask myself, why, how\u2019s it? I mean, it\u2019s Tuesday, a\nweekday, why they should be there? And they -- when we were going towards the exit,\ntwo Americans were behind me and they said, there must be a VIP on the boat, because\na group of people are waiting in front of the plane. That was for me. And the entire\nleadership of Solidarity was in the front of the plane, I had fantastic welcome, and -- by\nthis hundreds of people who came to the airport. And the next -- I -- the next day, the\nhostess, my hostess, offered that she will take me to the downtown, to the city. And I\nsaid no, because after all, I was born in Warsaw, and I would like to be -- to see my\ncity alone. I said, you will have a -- it was in suburb -- you will have a problem to find a\ntaxi, because they don\u2019t stop, you have to find the taxi stop. I said, okay, I will manage.\nI went to the main street, and here was a taxi. So I raised my h -- my hand and su -- the\ntaxi stopped. So I jumped in and the taxi driver said I know who you are, because you\nwere on television, on the evening. Okay, he took me to the place which I requested,\n4September 18, 1996\nand the fare was [indecipherable] it was 27 cents, because of the dollar was very high.\nSo I decided, no, I will give him a dollar at least. I gave him a dollar and he said, keep\nthis dollar for yourself. I said, why? How much? He said nothing. Why nothing?\nBecause I was listening to Radio Free Europe for so many years, free, wh -- I -- I want\nto give you -- offer you one free drive. And that was to me very moving, you know, this\none dollar was the best reward I got for 25 years of work [indecipherable]",

It was a fascinating life, full\nof stories, and full of, let\u2019s say adventures, different kind that -- during the war. But they\nwere adventures. After all, the -- we had the -- I had several fronts. I worked with the\n5September 18, 1996\nAmerican management and had to argue about the policy with the Americans. I had the\n-- my team, which was very large one. At one moment they were more than 100 people.\nAnd finally, the main front was Communism, I had to -- to fight Communism.",
        "A: It di -- it started with about 80 people, but later on 1t was much more -- m-more than\n-- more than 100.",
        "A: Yes, it was the only all time programming. We did start at five in the morning, and\nwe ended after midnight. It was a sort of a continuation of the free Polish radio which\ndid exist before the war. And we even adopted some features of the Polish radio. For\ninstance, the cra -- the -- the program did end with the Polish national anthem. In the\nmiddle we had, in the Polish radio at noon, they would transmit the so-called\n[indecipherable]. You know, the very old tune, which was played by trumpeter on the\ntop of the tower of the old gothic church in Krakow. We did broadcast this, so in fact it\nwas a kind of a substitute and continuation of the Free Polish Radio. And we had\neverything, first of all news, every hour on the hour. 10 minutes news so that everybody\nin Poland knew that when, with the strike of an hour, you can turn on [indecipherable]\nand he will hear the recent news. There were, of course, political commentaries, round\ntable discussions, press reviews, all kind of, you know, political future, such as you find\nin the public radio, public television. But there was -- there were also the program for a\n-- for a th -- for the country, for the village, for -- for the farmers. And the program for\nwomen, program for workers. There was sport, musical programs, everything that you\nexpect from the normal Polish -- normal h-home radio. This was, as I say, a substitute.",
        "A: Oh yes, but not -- not regularly. I broadcast when something really very important\nhappened. I did not broadcast every day, or even every month, but when something of\ngreat importance happened, then I was on the air. And people knew that it was -- that\nthere was some -- something important in that time.",
        "A: Well, for instance, in 1956, there were a big upheaval [indecipherable] and the\nRussians did -- or for instance when the Polish [indecipherable] was arrested, which\nwas a big blow against the church, I would go -- go on the air and make my comments\nabout it.

        "A: Oh yes, because people were telling me.\n6September 18, 1996",
        "A: Yeah. Well, in the first place, we did meet people who went to the west. Two, the\nmost important indication of effectiveness were attacks -- propaganda attacks by the\nregime, which were very intense. Attempts to discredit us, discredit me, and jamming. I\nmean jamming was a very expensive operation, and the jamming, that indicated that\nthey considered our broadcast as effective and dangerous. And finally the Americans\ndid have a contract with the measure audience analysis institutions in Demark, in\nAustria, and they were conducting, you know, public opinion polls among people who\nwere coming from Poland. So we had pretty good indications of our effectiveness.",
        "A: And letters, but we didn\u2019t attach too much importance to letters.",
        "A: First of all, there was no underground movement after the war. There was for\nsometime, and was eliminated by the political police.

Therefore, I could build the program in such manner that it is best tune to\nthe mentality, interests, traditions of the Polish audience, something I could not do in\nBBC. In the BBC, British were deciding what to broadcast and how. Here we had --\nAmericans gave us considerable editorial autonomy.

        "A: No, because frankly, I wrote my memoirs, I wrote my two books about my career in\nthe radio, and I hoped that I can put it behind me. Unfortunately, then the -- I had the\ninterviews, and people asking, but I prefer to think about the present time and about the\nfuture, rather than about the past.

        "A: It was definitely, by far the most important. Frankly, you know, I never thought that\nthe -- the words, as a vehicle carrying ideas and information may have such a\ntremendous impact. A-And first of all, frankly we eliminated effectiveness of\ncensorship, because it was enough to tune to us to learn everything that the censorship\nwas trying to keep from preventing to know, to learn. So we destroyed the monopoly of\nmedia, ne -- monopoly of information and education. As long as this monopoly existed\nand people were isolated from the outside world, and flow of information, th-they could\nhave been brainwashed. But once they had access to free sources of information, they\nwou -- they remained independent in their own mind and in drawing their own\nconclusions. The -- that was our role. Also, we did play a role of opposition and I\ndiscovered that the ruling group fights the opposition by doing what the opposition\nwants them to do. In other words, the [indecipherable] when it is widely known,\ngovernment reacts to the opposition. They don\u2019t want people to believe in what they\nsay. And therefore they try to prove that you were wrong by acting exactly like you\nwant them to act. We -- our first rally, probably it was the most important event in the\nhistory of political broadcasting. After Stalin\u2019s death, and after Beria was -- was killed,\na very high official of the Polish political police, who had -- knew all the secrets -- all\nthe state secrets and party secrets, defected to the west. And after being debriefed by the\nCIA, we could use him and he was broadcasting all the secrets of the party. And th-\nthere were -- the -- the entire Poland was listening. And political -- they had to find\nscapegoats because he was revealing all kind of crimes committed by the leadership. In\norder to defend themselves, they put all the blame on the political police and they -- it\nwas reorganized completely. And the resulting chaos really -- I mean, decreased the\nterror. You know, people were no longer afraid because the entire apparatus of the\nrepressions was paralyzed. And it was bef -- because of the effect of [indecipherable]\nthat opposition in Poland could became much more articulate. They could speak. They\ncould, in a sense, organize themselves. And that was our major contribution.",
        "A: Well, you see, right after the war, I believe that anti-Semitism was pretty dormant,\nbut the regime, which was under great attack from the west, for violating democratic\ninstitutions, for forging the election, in a way that they want to -- to compromise the\nPolish people, and there are strong suspicions that so-called [indecipherable] was\ninstigated by the political police in order to, you know, compromise the Polish people,\nbut in fact, th-the sad part of the story is that this kind of provocation is that there was a\nprovocation, did find a fertile ground. There was people who did the -- the d -- the fact,\nhistorical fact is that 42 innocent Jews who survived the -- the Holocaust and lost many,\n9September 18, 1996\nmany of their relatives and friends, were murdered by the Poles in Kielce, and this is\nsomething that I myself, as a Pole, I am very am -- ashamed of. And I believe that we\nshould and we did -- Poland did apologize for it. Then, you know, there was a anti-\nSemitism made in Russia. Stalin -- Stalin was anti-Semi -- was anti-Semitic, and\nshortly before his death, he ran so-called doctor\u2019s plot, accusing his doctors of Jewish\nbackground of plotting against his life. And that was a signal for kind of anti-Semitism\nthat was instigated by Russians in order to divert the attention of people from their\npoverty, from the inefficiency of the Communist regime, and to find a kind of a\nscapegoat. Jews were to be a scapegoat. And this was the kind of anti-Semitism spread\nby the Stalinist faction, called [indecipherable], in the Communist party. And they\nwere opposed by intellectuals, liberal intellectuals. And among the intellectual\n[indecipherable] there were many Jews. And this is when we first really started to fight\nagainst anti-Semitism, \u201954 - \u00b055, after Stalin\u2019s sudden death, when this was the means\nto compromise, liberally minded Jews who were in opposition to the party line, to the\nparty system of work. And there were some very outstanding intellectuals, who were\nopposing this kind of anti-Semitic trend, and we did a lot to support them to\ncompromise the anti-Semitism as a -- something that is imported from Russia. Seeing\nas the people at that time hated Russians, this was probably the most effective way of\nfighting anti-Semitism. We did -- dedicated lot of time and work to it.",
        "A: A lot. Scripts, they are still in -- in existence, scripts.",
        "A: It was fascinating. Well, in the underground I had adventures. There wer -- this was\na time a -- war time adventures. And the -- in Radio Free Europe, it was much less\nromantic. We were simply broadcasting, writing program.",
        "A: Well, first of all, I hate hatred. In other words, I am strongly against the idea of\neternal enemies. The Germans inflicted terrible, you know, blows to Poland. They not\nonly murdered the -- most of the Jewish population, but the -- but about two million\nPoles were killed in the concentration camps. They were executed, or deported. And the\n-- the years of German occupation were years o -- of terrible human tragedies. So\nfrankly, you know, of course I had very strong feelings against the Germans. But after\nthe war, when I was in Germany, I discovered that you cannot generalize, that there are\nalso some Germans who are decent, and who would like to frankly, compensate in some\nway f-for what they did to the Poles. I --I -- well, this is probably a postman. Yeah, I -- I\ncan do -- do it later. And ma -- the only problem I had with the Germans is their\nterritorial claims against Poland, which were extremely dangerous to our existence\nbecause Poland was moved westward. We lost one-third of our territory and our people\nwere annexed by -- by the Soviet Union. And we were compensated by the big powers\nin the west. A considerable part of former Germany was incorporated into post-war\n10September 18, 1996\nPoland. We couldn\u2019t possibly lost it again, it would be then a sort of a remnant state.\nAnd so this was the main problem between the Poles and the Germans, but in 1990,\nGermans recognized the border as final. It was ratified by the parliament. And as of that\ndate, 1t was a turning point. And once the Germans reconciled themselves with the post-\nwar borders, they are no longer a threat and there is a tremendous improvement in the\nPolish - German relationship, which I\u2019m very happy about, because I -- I believe that\nhatred is a boomerang. If you hate other people, they will hate you. And so the\nreconciliation between Poland and Germany, which is very real, 1s probably the best\nachievement of -- of this Solidarity government.",
        "A: Oh, terrible.",
        "A: Well, you know, this is -- you know, the hatred brings about unspeakable human\nsufferings, loss of life, tortures, everything. Senseless. Senseless. So ethnic hatred, and\nany kind of ethnic or racial prejudices are extremely dangerous to humanity, and to\neverybody, including to Poles also. So Iam very happy that Poland, after it go rid of its\n-- the Communist and Soviet domination is working towards reconciliation with all its\nneighbors, with Germans, with Lithuanians, with Ukrainians, Czechs and so on. And\nrestored all the minority ethnic rights to -- to the -- its -- its ethnic minorities.",
        "A: Absolutely. You know, this was my very tragic experience, because frankly, I was\nagain an eyewitness. Of course the Jews were isolated, they were behind the walls. But\nwe could -- I could still see the starving Jews who would escape from ghetto and die on\nthe pavement from -- from starvation. So it was s -- it was a tragedy, human tragedy\nwithout any precedent. We did lose two million ethnic Poles, but only Jews were really\ncondemned to death simply because they were born Jews, and had no chance to survive.\nAnd I was the -- the first envoy who brought this information about the Holocaust, with\nmy colleague, Jan Karski. And then I will -- I followed. I was in Stockholm at the\ntime of the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto, and I knew about it, and I wrote a\nmemorandum to the Polish government that they should exert their influence on the\nBritish that some kind of retaliatory measures should be threatened to stop the\nextermination of Jews. And I know that the memorandum was passed to Churchill, but\nhe was not prepared to any -- to any -- the only thing he -- I believe that my\nmemorandum did contribute to the decision to prosecute after the war wa -- German\nNazi war criminals, because soon after the decision was made to install the tri-tribunal,\nand announcements was made that Nazi criminals will be brought to justice. Then I\ncame back, it was July \u201944, and the ghetto no longer existed, but there were many Jews\nin hiding. And I got instructions to pre -- to b -- to prepare myself for my second\nmission to London. And to be briefed, to learn about the whole thing, so that I could\nagain bring about some message, about what\u2019s -- what happened to the Jews. So there\n11September 18, 1996\nwas a man by the name of Volitski, who has his, you know, plaque in Yad Vashem, he\n-- he was -- who was the kind of a liaison with the Jewish militant organization. I spent\nhours with him. He told me all about the -- the uprising and all that. He was himself in\ntouch with it. And I got on microfilms the report of the survivor of the Jewish ghetto\nuprising, and also photographs, documents, which I brought in my secret\n[indecipherable] as microfilms. And I was the one who brought this report of the\nJewish militant organization to London. I reached London in December \u201950 -- \u201943, and\nth-this report was passed by the Polish government to the British government, to the\norganization and I was -- I did see many members of the British cabinet, members of\nthe Parliament, intelligence -- people from intelligence community, and I was telling\nabout what happened to the Jews. And, frankly, you know, as far as the British cabinet,\nthere was no response.",
        "A: And when I talked to Eden, Anthony Eden, the foreign secretary, he told me, Mr.\nNowak, the best way and the only way we can help Jews is by winning the war. If we\ndivert our limited war, you know, military resources to such objectives as bombing the\ntracks, it will delay the end of the war. And you know, when I came back to London\nwith my wife, when I was writing my memoirs, and we went to Her Majesty\u2019s records\noffice, archives, I found piles of documents concerning my mission, including the\nreports from Eden to Churchill about our conversation. Not one word about the Jews.\nNot one word. I took to all of them, I raised the question of Jews. And I -- I strongly\nbelieve that retaliatory measures would have offered at least a moral help. That they\nwould know they are not ignored, that the -- the world 1s -- sees that trad -- trade --\ntradegy -- tragedy. So I feel that -- but even Jews would not believe me. I mean, I wa --\nthere was a Polish Jew by the name of Schwarzbat, who was in the Polish, you know,\nsort of a -- a parliament in exile, and he put me 1n contact with the American Jewish\norganization, Joint and others. And I spent hours with them, they didn\u2019t believe me.\nWhen I said that two million -- at least two million Jews were already killed, they\nthought that this is unacceptable exaggeration, and that I must have some political\nmotives --",
        "A: -- in telling this story.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Absolutely. I must say that I used this very powerful instrument, Radio Free Europe,\nto fight anti-Semitism. But all -- also we did not generate hatred toward Germans or\nRussians. We were, you know, defending our national aspirations, but the per -- th-there\nwas no purpose of really generating feelings of hatred, because I strongly believe that\nhatred is a boomerang that would hit the Polish people back. And I was pa -- at the\n12September 18, 1996\ntimes when you know the -- the -- there was again the outburst of party anti-Semitism.\nIn times of a man who was in charge of political police, poli -- poli -- by the name of\nMotcha, and he was anti-Semitic. And he really unleashed anti-Semitic propaganda.\nAnd the [indecipherable] of Jews, there were many Jews in the government, many\nJews in the all kind of position, and there were many Jews among the university youth.\nAnd h-he started a campaign of anti-Semitism, like in Russia. And by discrimination,\nby persecution, by threats, he forced these people of Jewish background, who\nconsidered themselves Poles, to leave the country. There was a -- an exodus of young\nJews who didn\u2019t even know they were Jewish. They were completely assimilated with\nthe Polish culture. And there were Polish writers, Polish scholars. And this was again\nunspeakable tragedy for them. And we were going out of our way to at least offer these\npeople a moral help by condemning it. And I had a lot of satisfaction when, for\ninstance, a Polish essayist and -- and writer by the name of Roman Cast, who had to\nleave the country under this kind of purge, and he became a professor at what it\u2019s\ncalled, Brooks -- Stone -- Stonebrook University. He came to mean and said, Mr.\nNowak, if not for Radio Free Europe, I and my daughter wou -- would have committed\nsuicide. And we were on the -- on the verge of doing it. But your broadcast made us\nbelieve that we are not alone, we are not isolated. That our -- and -- and the kind of\nmoral comfort that we got by listening to Radio Free Europe, really, we decided, no,\nwe w -- we will leave the country, we -- but we -- we -- we will live on with all this.\nAnd this was for me a tremendous reward. There were my former colleagues, Jan Kott,\nwho is a very highly respected American scholar, was my schoolmate. He was of\nJewish background. And they were all really highly appreciative of our -- of our efforts.\nAlso, during the Israel six -- Six Days War, we were on the air from the morning until\nnight, and the Israel embassy got I don\u2019t know how many flowers, messages, from our\nlisteners. Because of course, since it was -- since Russia, Soviet Union was on the Arab\nside, Polish people on the -- were on the Jewish side. So I think it was -- I am very\nproud of -- of this effort, which under my leadership was undertaken by Radio Free\nEurope, in fighting hatred and prejudice.",
