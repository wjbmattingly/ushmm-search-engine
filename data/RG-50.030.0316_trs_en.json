        "JACK BRAUNS and AVRAHAM TORY\nSeptember 27, 1991\nB:My father is an apprentice to shoemaker. That gave him the right to go to high school, and my",
        "father went to high school and he was an excellent student. And the director of that high\nschool was my father's protege. And he was en...always encouraged my father to\ncontinue higher education. My father finished the high school with the highest in...in\nDorpet with the highest marks, and had a really new problem....a Jewish problem which\nwas to enter a university. He wanted to study medicine. He wanted to study medicine\nand for a Jew to enter Dorpet university was one of the most difficult things. More\ndifficult it was for me or anybody else to enter in the modern time in a medical school.\nAnd at that time my grandfather had a cousin who was one of the one who was\nkidnapped on the street, and was a Russian soldier for 25 years, enlisted. He had no\nchildren and he, the cousin of my grandfather, had a legal right to enroll his children to a\nRussian university. But he was not the father of my father. Therefore, 1t was worth my\ngrandfather who was the Rabbi...Rabbi in the little town of Velendi did something which\nis really...I consider thinking about it, very humiliating for him. He had to declare\nhimself mentally insane, not able to take care of his son, and legally transferred the right\nto his cousin to adopt him and take care of him. My grandfather who was a very learned\nman and a very sharp man did it for my father. As a result my father succeeded in enter\nuniversity as a faculty of medicine. Uh...After a year or 2 at the university of Tarto, my\nfather succeeded to be accepted to Cologne, the Cologne University in Germany, where\nhe completed medicine and...uh...had a excellent education. He married my mother was\nwas from Riga, and they both settled in Kaunas in 1940 and my ...excuse me...my father\nbecame...uh...interested in contagious diseases, and was in charge of the hospital, in the\nJewish hospital of the contagious disease department. In 1940, approximately 6 weeks\nbefore the World War II started, a epidemic of typhus developed in the city of Vilnos.",
        "And my father was dispatched to be in charge of the epidemic in Vilnos where\nhe...uh...directed the treatment of the thousands of people who got sick. On the day of\nthe war in...in...he...on a Sunday when the war broke up, that was the day when he came\nto Kaunas. And when he traveled in the train he still did...didn't know that the war\nstarted. When the war started...uh...he again was in charge of the contagious disease\nhospital in...in the ghetto. In...1in...I'm sorry, 1n...in...1n Kaunas. And in August when the\nGermans have ordered the...uh...the Germans have ordered the movement of the Jews\ninto the ghetto...uh...my father had the task in organizing the contagious disease hospital\nin the ghetto. Now, Avraham, as you know at that time, and you were the Secretary of\nthe Judenrat, you probably know...",
        "T:There was no Judenrat. There was an Altestenrat, a Jewish Council.",
        "B:I'm sorry. A Jewish Council.",
        "T:In Vilna, there was a Judenrat. In Kovno, there was not.",
        "B:Okay. In the Altestenrat, how was the mechanism and what role my father played in the\nbeginning in the ghetto, and later in the ghetto?",
        "T:Yes. Uh...I mentioned in many...1n many occasions, the important role that...uh...your father,\nDr. Moses Brauns, played in the ghetto from its very beginning because...uh...30,000\nJews were ordered to move in the small area of the suburb of Slobodka, which was\ninhabited about 8 thousand normally, and now 30 thousand Jews had to...to be squeezed\nin an un...1mpossible density, and this created the first...the first big problem of\ncontagious diseases because Slobodka was a very famous...uh...a very famous suburb\nfrom the point of view of big scholars were world famous. But it was",
        "one of the most neglected suburbs. There was no...no sewage, no water, not any of the\nmilitary installations and that's why there was no, for instances, toilets. There was not\nsuch houses....houses were small ones. One...one story... story houses of wooden. There\nwere in...in all of Slobodka, were approximately two or three big...uh...houses of...of\n... three story houses with bricks. Others were mostly wooden of...of one story or two\nstories. So this in itself brought about it that many Jews were...fled from Kovno to the\nghetto, didn't find there housing. And the housing department was...was...uh...was\nin...was not able to ...to ...locate houses. When I talk about houses, we speak about a\nroom. We speak about a part of a room, a dwelling. And this too was there were so\nmany thousands were in the streets under the sky. And others...we used to... we used to\nhouse them the...the roofless we used to house them in previous synagogues or Yeshivites\nbut they were packed to capacity and you___ to a former school as I did with the head\nofthe _\u2014s department. Atthattime _, we were looking for a place where we\ncould install a hospital, a general hospital. So not only in the...in the rooms, the family\nsleep but only in the staircase. Only in the...in the...the toilets. In the...in the... in the...1n\nthe upper floor where it was only for storage, there also lived people. And this created\nimmediately danger for contagious diseases. The...the Lithuanian sanitary department of\nKovno was searching where they were spying in the ghetto just to look and pick up one\ncase of a contagious diseases. It was typhus or something we've had. And there were\nsuch, because it was impossible, but also in this we called them reservats where\nhundreds of families lived in one place, a formal Shivot or formal synagogue. And\nwhen...the...happened such a thing, there was no possibility to...to isolate the sick one, so\nDoctor Brauns was the one who had two tasks in one time. First of all, to help give\nmedical care to the contagious sick person. Second to isolate him from the rest of the\npeople in the reservat, which was full packed, and where to put him...put him at a bed that\nthere was no such a bed even on the...on the ground, but to isolate him from the others.\nSecond, he was the one who served as address for those Lithuanians, municipal spies I",
        "say, medical spies or sanitary spies who came to Dr. Brauns, and they asked him how the\nsituation...where are your contagious diseases. So he said, \"We don't have any.\" And he\nwas duty bound as head of the...of the...the Department for Contagious Diseases to report\nto the municipality in Kovno, to the health department of Kovno, and they would have\ncome. In addition German Police, the Gestapo, on their own initiative, used to come to\nthe ghetto and search. On the spot they used to go into the reservot. They used to go\nin...in...uh...they used to go in the...",
        "B:The houses?",
        "T:Private dwellings. Houses. Dwellings. Corridors. Court yards. They were packed. But Dr.\nBrauns used to take out of such places the diseases and found some other places in a\nvery...1n a small hut, and it was much like as if it is just a hut, but inside the court yard, he\nused to...he built with them, and this separated them from the others. Always the night,\nhe was the buffer, I could say to...he was to rebuff...to rebuff the attacks of the Germans,\nof the Lithuanians, not less than the Germans from spying...from spying where the\ncontagious ill people are. This was...this was supposed to be the motive to liquidate all\nthe ghetto because if there is a contagious diseases in the ghetto, we wind on the other\nside of the...of the...of the free...free part of the barbed wire, there was a Lithuanian\npopulation, also in the...in the very same small suburb. So they...excuse that they would\nbe a danger to the Lithuanian population. They would even be a danger for the German\nsoldiers passing by. And he stood firm. First of all it was a very big morale\nresponsibility to cure. There were excellent physicians in the ghetto. Surgery...and in out\nthis is and out this is, and whatever not a very specialist in medicine. But not one of them\nwas ready to take over the risk and deal with, cure this diseases of typhus and so on. The\nonly who took it over and did hisself the very great, not only respect, but the trust of the\nJewish Committee, the Council. Dr. Elkes, the head of the Jewish Council. We're great",
        "friends. They wrote for long years. It was a long standing, long year\nstanding...uh...uh...friendship. And that's why they trusted him fully. He was the...the\nman, the doctor who was the only one whom the Jewish Council relied upon to protect\nthe ghetto inmates from first of all contagious diseases in...1n themselves a danger, and\nfor the other one to stand courageous...courageous and steady right to...to reject and\nto...to buff back all these questions, sometimes cynical questions, sometimes provocative\nquestions, some provocative unexpected visits. And when Dr. Brauns was...went in the\nghetto and he met on...on the streets of this___\u2014_\u2014s and he recognized...and he recognized\nthe Lithuanian physicians who came and they knew what they came for. And\nimmediately just interfered, they told them, \"Please, where are you. What are you doing?\nPlease come. You ought to see my hospital. Please and so on.\" But he knew them.",
        "They wanted sometimes to a avoid meeting with him, and to reach\nexactly...uh...the...the...uh...the _\u2014_itself, the sick man who was sick with typhus. And\nthis is a task that will be written always in the annals of the three years of the Kovno\nGhetto. I don't know of any other such person, physician, who took upon himself the\ndaily risk of life, his own life, in fight from...from both parts. This, you know,\nthe..uh...the Czars emblem was a two...two heads...uh...two heads ofa..ofa",
        "B:Eagle.",
        "T:Eagle. Two of them. And Dr. Brauns, I could say he had...he had two parts of Dr. Brauns.\nOne part they wrote it to his fellow inmates in the ghetto. Protect them from the very\ndiseases. He's a doctor, a physician. And on the part, the second Dr. Brauns who stood\non the outlook everyday against the Germans, spies, against the warnings, the threats that\nthey used to say Dr. Brauns, \"You are the person who are responsible to report to us and\nif you will not report you bear responsibility yourself.\" And you know what it means\nresponsibility? This means just death. No compromise. And I'm not exaggerating. So",
        "this is the way you, Dr. Brauns, in the ghetto...he knew very well because on the...he used\nto come to the very...very urgent cases, the very especially hard cases. When four or five\ngot sick with contagious diseases at one time, we used to find immediately to take them\nout from where they been and bring them in certain places we didn't know where.\nBecause we didn't have such hotels or somewhere to bring them there. But then we used\nto take even a hut or something like that, take out the dwelling...the...the citizens, the\ninmates and put in these...uh...under very strong and sometimes we used to put on the\noutlook on this...on this hiding... hiding hospital you see, uh...the outlook, two or three\npolicemen...Jewish policemen on the outlook so if somebody comes close, near to it.\nThis I how I knew Dr. Brauns and I cannot but end this...uh...this characteristic that in the\ncourse of the years I knew Dr. Brauns fromthe _____ from the Kovno Ghetto? He was\nthe President, but___\u2014__ the French was really...uh...really was developed in the ghetto\nand it was only nature that after the liberation when I was already in Israel and I got word\nthat...uh...this Jew came to...we were in Dachau, we were in concentration camp, and then\nwe were in Italy. We were...we were together in the 1945, 1947. You stayed there until\nlater I..Jmademy October 47. So that you came to...to America, you succeeded\nto...to...to study medicine and establish yourself as a well known physician in the United\nStates and then to learn from you when you visited Israel, you came to me and told me\nthat your father and mother were rescued. They survived and they are in... in Soviet\nUnion and you are trying to bring them out and what can I do for you in this case? I\nwhile in Italy I was the Secretary of the clandestine Aleia to Palestine. But we at that\ntime already used to send our messengers inside Russia to take out from\nthere...uh...Zionist...former Zionist leaders and bring them to Italy and then to Israel. So I\nhad all the connections how to take out from Russia to Palestine...to Palestine...to Israel.\nAnd it was a fact that I was the only one in Israel that dealt with it and when they used to\ncome to...to...uh...we used to come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for help, they told\nthem go to Avraham Tory, the lawyer, and they thought they have to come to Tory and",
        "obey me. See and so on, I never took a penny for that. And mind you, the President of\nthe State of Israel, Heil Weitzman, had a sister that remained in the Soviet Union. And\nthen Vera Weitzman, who was a very you know a lady and she was with the all the\nAmbassadors over there, so she spoke with the Russian Ambassador, they're bringing\nin...n Washington and she was here and she spoke with the French Ambassador there\nand here. And they asked. Nothing came out. So then I don't know someway they got\nword that Avraham Tory is dealing with bring the...the...the Jews from Soviet Union to\nIsrael. I was the first one to bring Pnina's father who was in Siberia, exiled, to bring him\nthe first one in 52. To bring him in...from...from Siberia to Israel. And I had there...when\nI...when I got word that he's already in Moscow, I...I spoke to the Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs and they called the Embassy in Moscow they shouldn't beat him because he is 70\nyears old man. Anyhow, so the...one of the family of the President came to my office and\nasked me could I do anything about this? And I told them...gave them one advice. If\nthey want me to deal with to bring the sister of the President, Heim Weitzman, to Israel,\nthey should not mention a word about the President, about Heim Weitzman, about Israel.\nNothing! A plain = woman comes...comes is...1s in Russia. She has a sister. It's\nmention because_\u2014\u2014__\u2014siin...in Israel. _\u2014 Only the sister should apply. And in their\nname I applied for a exit visa for this woman, and the...after 6 months she came to Israel.\nAnd then I got a very nice letter, nice but itso __\u2014.~-But when your father came to\nIsrael, came to...to...came to Russia, I told you the same thing. You cannot get your\nfather out of the Soviet Union and bring him straight from the Soviet Union to America.\nI suggest to you you formerly be...live in Israel. And I took your card and I put it on my\nprivate home as if you lived together with me in Israel. And they gave you the ...the...the\naerograms...Israeli post office and you used to write the aerograms and send them in a\nclosed envelope to me, and I used to put it in the...in the post office in Tele Aviv.

        "B:I want to add something. Being...we have two topics. We have topic of the ghetto, and topic\nof getting my parents out. I like to add an interesting story to that. When Mrs. Kruschev\nhappened to be in the United States, I was lucky enough to be introduced to Vice\nPresident Nixon. I wrote a very passionate letter to Mrs. Nixon. I compared two\nmothers. She is a mother who has two sons and lost her son and my mother who\nunfortunate lost my brother, one of her sons. And this passionate letter was given by\nPresident Nixon to Mrs. Krushev, and within one week we got a permit. However, what\nyou have done, we have really together deceived and covered because my father always\nsaid when the mailman used to come, he used to scream loud on the staircase, \"Dr.\nBrauns, I have a letter from your son from Israel.\" Sothe _, the KBG, at that time\nhas not...",
        "T:Had no idea.",
        "B:Had no idea the big deception. But the morale of the story is with your help, with President\nNixon's help, with Mrs. Krushev's generosity and interest we succeeded it, in this big\nproject to get my parents out. Going back to the ghetto thing, I am recollecting a few\nthings about the ghetto which was about about...about the period you said. First of all,\nmy father was heart broken when he had to take the patients from the contagious disease\nhospital and bring them to the ghetto. They were transported on open trucks. They were\nsick people with high temperature and they were dumped on the street. It was at that time\nwhen my father had helped to organize or I mean help...with the help of the people\nbecause he made a small hospital of 50 beds which was called the contagious disease\nhospital. The people everyone was very generous in the ghetto. They had nothing, but\neach found a little sheet, a little pillow, an extra bed to fill a 50 bed hospital, which I\npersonally was working in the hospital. And I...the hospital become a symbol of security\nfor the people. The people when the hospital felt that they feel secure. And you know\nbetter Dr. Elkes got a warning about three days before the tragedy in the...in the hospital\nthat they're planning to do something with the hospital. My father went to the hospital\nand tried to discharge everybody. And fort... mean unfortunate...fortunately, the people\nin the hospital were not very sick. They used it mostly as a shelter not to go to work. But\nnobody wanted to leave the hospital. And you described what happened on October 4th,\n1941, with this hospital which was one of the big tragedies. My own life was and my\nfather's life was saved by the fact there was a bridge to cross to the hospital.",
        "T:Up a bridge.",
        "B:An upper bridge I recall went over the highway, over the street or highway which was not part\nof the ghetto. And for some reason my father never know who it was, there was a man\nwho stopped him. And my father...",
        "T:On his way to the...near the...near the bridge?",
        "B:Near the bridge. And delayed us by 5 minutes. That was the 5 minutes that gave my father\nand me life. Why don't you describe what happened that time at the hospital?",
        "T:Well, I told already...spoke about it all I want. But what happened that Dr. Brauns usually at 6\no'clock, he was already walked to the ghetto, to the...to his hospital. And they when they\ncame to the...when they came to this day at this 4th of October 1941, he came to pass the\nbridge, they was already closed. Nobody comes into this small ghetto and nobody goes\nout. In the small ghetto was the...the contagious disease hospital headed by Dr. Brauns\nand they didn't let him in. He says, \"I am the doctor of the...of the hospital. I must be\nthere. The people are waiting.\" Not nothing. And you accompanied him. You were at\nthe age of 14 at time.",
        "16.",
        "...Pardon.",
        "...16. Well, I thought you were younger. Anyhow, it doesn't make really...uh...so...uh...both of\nyou and your father was in great distress. To leave a hospital that he 1s heading just to the\nfate of the people. And...and very short after 6 the...the hospital was put on fire with the\npatients, with the doctors, with administering personnel and also with the adjacent home\nof orphans of about 400, 300 orphans registered to the . And the ghetto...the\nwas on fire. The...uh...people...the children were taken to the ninth fortress together with\nanother thousand of the small ghetto and the ghetto, small ghetto, was liquidated.",
        "B:At that time my father made a solemn commitment that the word of contagious diseases did\nnot exist in the vocabulary. And that what led in the clandestine treatment of things.\nThere were two people, as far as I know, you and...and ...uh...and Elkes that knew about\nit. I happened to know about it too, and I tell you a little about what happened.\nUh...The...it's a very interesting thing and my father described it in his memoirs. For\nsome reason that we don't know many of the contagious diseases, like dysentery\ncompleted disappeared from the ghetto, inspite of the terrible sanitary conditions. My\nfather's nightmare at that time was the excrement that were used...the winter was very\ncold. It was the...the coldest winter in the history, actually since Napoleon time, and my\nfather was always saying, \"What will happen in the spring when all this excrements will\nstart melting?\" But in spite of this, dysentery disappeared. Diphtheria. Diphtheria is a\ndisease that is curable provided you use serum in the proper time. As you are aware, we\ndidn't have diphtheria serum. And if we succeeded by clandestine methods...my father\nsucceeded or you succeeded in the...from the ghetto, you...Altestenrat to get serum, it was\nalways given too late. In spite of that, in all the records that my father kept, there was not\none child that died of diphtheria and other diseases. But the really tragedy in the ghetto,\nfor my father, was in 1942. When the Germans were defeated in Moscow, there were a\nlot of Spanish troops who didn't have proper clothes. The blue brigade. There were\nGermans who didn't have clothes and they were amputees sick and by train they were\nsent by the Red Cross train of...German Red Cross train, they were sent to...back to\nGermany. However, the German...being this people, full of life because the hy...hygienic\nconditions were worse in the German army of that part than it was in the ghetto. And\nbeing them full lice and having typhus_\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014_\u2014s which is a little different type is from the\ntyphus of the \u2014\u2014\u2014, which is typhus ofthe __1s translated through life. So in\nKaunas, they established an , which means they delice.",
        "T:Delousing.",
        "B:Delousing. So the train would arrive and the patient would be taken out from the train, taken\noff, stripped from the clothes, shaven their hair and their clothes were disinfected, and the\ntrain was disinfected. There were two teams working. There was the Jewish team\nworking on the dirty side and there was a Lithuanian team working on the clean side. I\ndon't know if was by providence or whatever happened, the Lithuanian side...people\nworkers there developed typhus.",
        "T:I don't know. I know it.",
        "B:No. Well, developed a epidemic, and many Lithuanians died. As a result, the Lithuanian\nhealth department immediately flooded the ghetto, and it is in your book written the dates\nthey came and flooded because they justifiable looked for the...for the cause of the...of\nthe disease. But in the... on the Jewish side, they were 74 cases of typhus __ that my\nfather treated them, hid them, and he got from the Altestenrat extra soap, extra\nconsideration in moving the patient to certain parts, but he succeeded in...in treating the\npatients. Now if you take an American textbook, _, which is a top text book and you\nwrite...look up the page on typhus___, you will find that the morality rate on people\nwho are not treated with any medicine is 60 plus percent. My father in the 74 patients\nhad only 3 deaths, and the only three people were people who begged him to die. They\nsaid they would like...love to die in a bed. They are too tired to continue their life. And\nthe Godless in medicine that I practiced for 40 years, I learned that when a patient does\nnot...when a patient does not have...uh... the will to live, he doesn't live.",
        "T: That's right.",

        "B:Of my father. What the recollection. What do I remember of my father? I remember my\nfather teaching me the morality of life, which the logic in life morality which I greatly\nappreciate. I also remember of few things of my father. My father practiced medicine\nfor 40 years, like myself, and never sent a bill to a patient. And I always was wondering\nhow he survived. But he did survive. And he always told me that the last...that the last\nbill he got paid was the heaviest payment he got. And the...I have to mention it because\nit's very important. That was...there was a patient in 1938 a woman was brought to the\nJewish hospital. She was very poor. The husband was working as a clean...horse cleaner\nin the Jewish brewer in Lithuanian, which happened to be a Jewish brewery. My father\ntook care of her in 38. My mother put packages of clothes for her, and I remember the\nhouse calls that my father used to make and take me because it was in___ and I loved\nto go. I loved to go for a ride. In 1939, as you recall...uh... the Germans took away\nthe...uh...the port of Clipedell. The Lithuanians got very upset. They took all the\nLithuanians of German descent to...uh..and send them to...uh...Germany. This man knew\nonly to clean horses, and in 1944 when my father and I and Dr. ,_ and Dr.\nand...and got to...lager... Dachau, lager 2, this man was the chief of command of the\nSS. He recognized my father and he extend the most unbelievable courtesy. In fact, he\nrisked his life to help us. One of the things he did outside of helping us 1n food and I\nhave to mention later a few things, but basically he...uh...when my...when the first\npatient... person died in lager 2, I wrote in the report 'Died of starvation.\u2019 Well, to make a",
        "long story short, this... this report went to Dachau...to Berlin, to send the Commission,\nand the chief doctor of Dachau who later was hung in the Nuremberg trial was looking\nfor my father to kill him because he wrote a report and a commission came to investigate.\nAt that time the German SS were stealing food, and they were investigating exactly that\nproblem. This SS man of my father's friend took my father out, and my father lived for 6\nweek in his house til the storm was over. And...uh...1...L..after the war, letters were\nwritten by Dr. Nobliski and Dr. Pepsico to save this man from the gallow because he\nhelped. The other thing I want to tell to tell I was in Israel one day and I went into a\nfamous bakery kaposki. And I didn't know about it, but I recognized...he recognized\nme...Kaposki, the son. And he immediately called his father and he kissed me and\nhugged me and said, \"You don't know what your father did for me.\" At that time, the son\nwas dying. He had no meat, no protein and needed meat. My father asked this man to\nprovide meat. He didn't...and the German obliged him. He brought meat for Kaposki's\nson to save him. But I was a muscleman myself and I didn't have meat, and my father did\nnot worry about me because I was not in the medical condition...medical physical\ncondition that he...so this is the character of my father.
