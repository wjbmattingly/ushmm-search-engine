But there was a, I seen there a big garbage disposal there and I jumped in, not to be\nseen. And wait til the train moved away and after he was gone, I got out of there, tried to clean\nmyself up a little bit. Anyhow, it worked and I got into the next train and then from there to\nMannheim. I mentioned Mannheim. There was my brother at that time. He found a trade. And so\nI figured that was on the way home. Was staying there for a day or two and then I went back\nhome. And my father asked me, what would you have done, if you wouldn\u2019t have us send the\nmoney? Because I said at that time, send me money or I\u2019m going to do something. So I said\nnothing. And that was the end of that.",

And they told us so\ntoo but I was one of the last ones, the newest ones who come to this place. So the way I was, so\nwe let, give me one moment please.\nYes, oh yeah. Then came an order from the Nazis that every Jewish place where everything\nJews, they are gathering together, the youngsters. They want so and so many of them they should\nwork for them.

It was a bad experience for me because\nI always had wet feet and if I could not act with the equipment, shoes. The food was not too bad.\nWe got from the farmers. The farmers, they fed us. And we were sleeping at the haystacks.",

So I went to this Jewish Agency to Berlin and managed and I told them I\ncan\u2019t take that no more. So they sent somebody else instead me and I went back to Cologne.\nNow, from now on, I was there another -- how long, another few months and then there was a\ntrip organized going to Palestine now.\nI usually the newcomers, to there had to wait. They were not eligible but in my case they made a\ndifference because I did work for the Nazis over here. They says we\u2019ll get you on there. Now\nthe ones who organized those, a trip was only one trip. And that was the last one. The man who\norganized that, that was rich Jews and in return they took them also. They were allowed to go\nbecause the idea was to get the youngsters out ok. So in that case they added them also to \u2014 Then\nwe went to Vienna.",

        "A: No, no because we didn\u2019t see much Germans. They only were walking around and see if you\nare working or not, but other than that no, no. There was no problem. So like I said \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have any communication with your parents when you were \u2014",

        "A: They felt they were Germans because they were treated nice and everybody treated them nice\nuntil really shortly before the Crystal night. Then everything changed. And we knew that there\u2019s\nno future for us. And we came to Haifa so it took us a long time. I would say a couple of weeks\ntil we got there. To the \u2014",
        "Q: What was the name of the boat, do you know?",
        "A: Atific [ph]. Yeah it was a little boat. It was altogether close to a thousand tons that\u2019s all. So\nand we landed shortly before we came to \u2014 we landed in Haifa but not at the pier that is in the\nBritish. So I forgot something here, yeah. We ran out of coal. We ran out of water. We ran out\nof everything because we were several weeks on the sea. And so I volunteered to go to the\nmachine room and took care of the ovens there because I knew you get a little better food there\nwhatever. And then when we came to Haifa and there was a big ocean liner standing there. It\nwas supposed to bring us to whole lot. And one of the British islands there, Cyprus yeah. To\nCyprus. And so little by little they transferred us to that ocean liner. It was called Patcific,\nPatria. Was called Patria. And then all of a sudden nobody really wanted to go but we didn\u2019t\nhave no choice. So then the Hagenah did some things. They brought some explosives with the\nfood that they loaded. And they told everybody who was on that boat, not everybody was\ntransferred yet. Maybe were transferred I would say about 500 people and altogether we were\n900. So what happened was yeah, they told us we should go on deck in the morning. Go to the,\non deck there is a meeting so I said I\u2019m going to sleep a little longer. And then all of a sudden I\nheard a boom and I thought it was a bomb. That is over here something not 100 percent kosher\nso I was running up to the deck. And on my way up I felt already I had to hold on, on the\nrailings because the ship was leaning to the side. And then I came up to, soon I came up on top\nthere. I lost my balance and I slipped to the other side of the \u2014 and which was a little bit under\nwater already. So I had no choice. I didn\u2019t know how to swim but I jumped in the water. I had\nno choice.\nAnd some fellow seen me. He was in the water too and he seen me that I\u2019m struggling. So he\nwent behind me and he pushed me, kept on pushing me to the little boat they have which came\nto \u2014 they didn\u2019t come close to the ocean liner because they figured if something is going to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nhappen, something going to explode better to stay away from there. So everybody who got out of\nthere had to swim a little bit. Yeah. So got there on that boat and that was in fact ok with me and\nwe kept to a big, a big hole there. How you call it. I forget. And we got clothes there and we got\nfood there. That\u2019s the Jewish Agency, they took care of everything. And the British, they\nwatched us like a hawk.",
        "Q: This is in Cyprus. You\u2019re in Cyprus?",
        "A: That was, no that was in Haifa.",
        "Q: You\u2019re still in Haifa?",
        "A: We are still in Haifa. Because not everybody was yet transferred to the Patria. The ones who\nwere not transferred to the Patria yet, they think that they are the ones who sent them later to\nCyprus. So what happened to us? We went to Atlit, that\u2019s a big camp there. And we were there.\nAnd then one morning everybody, they got everybody out to Atlit, even the ones who are\nsupposed to go to Cyprus. But then the British came one morning and they got them out, the rest\nof them. They had their names. They got them out and they rejected so they had they were using\nsticks and some of the guys there, the people there, they threw their clothes away so then they\ngot, they considered that. They were standing there without clothes, without anything. But they\ntook them out anyhow.\nAnd I was in Atlit for about four months. I would say I didn\u2019t have such a bad time there because\nthe food was excellent. I was a volunteer. This time in the kitchen. And they had those big cat,\ncassels that they put the food where they made the food, I don\u2019t know exactly but there were\naltogether in the camp close to a thousand people, maybe more.\nAnd that was in the \u2014 everything was strictly kosher there.",
        "Q: Did you know Hebrew by then?",
        "A: No, I knew how to read but it didn\u2019t mean anything to me. I didn\u2019t know the meaning of it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",

        "A: Pardon.",
        "Q: You just knew German, that\u2019s all \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So and I would say I was there for about six months. And after that I went\nto a kibbutz. They didn\u2019t ask me. They came. They let us go and there was a group already in the\nkibbutz, Ashdod Yakov. And I was there several months. And I remember it was very hot and\nso they give us lessons in Hebrew in the afternoon. In the morning, everybody has a little job,\nsomething to do. Yeah. But I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the afternoon lessons because was so\nhot outside. I couldn\u2019t keep more. So that was one thing and then I\u2019m \u2014 every kibbutz had to\nsend some people into the army at that time because there was a, they called it the Palestinian\narmy. So naturally they didn\u2019t want me to go. They wanted to go people from the kibbutz who\nare there for a long time. But they told them if you go to the army, you go to the box. The box\nthat means that\u2019s the part who stays in Palestine, doesn\u2019t go out of the country. And that\u2019s\nbecause at that time, the war was going on and didn\u2019t . And they were afraid that\nGermans getting closer and closer so it\u2019s very important to be in the country, to defend ourselves.\nBut so I didn\u2019t like the kibbutz. I didn\u2019t like the life there. I didn\u2019t like the way -- they treated us\nok but I didn\u2019t like to take orders. But anyhow, usually you take anyhow when you get into the\narmy. So I volunteered to the army and \u2014",

That\u2019s the, Salafet that\u2019s the place where they got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nthe, all the people together which going to be fighting.

        "Q: But you had no contact with your parents?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have any. I knew through my sister that they transferred them to Lagosh [ph]\nand the trains and that they were there for several months and then they sent them to Auschwitz.\nSo now where was I?",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re getting training you said cause you told them \u2014",
        "A: Yeah I got training yeah. I learned how to drive a truck. That\u2019s what. So that was another\nweek so and then they sent us to E] Aleman and I felt ok. Everything was nice and quiet. There\nwas no big action going on at that time until one night and they started. Nobody knew what\u2019s\ngoing on. We heard artillery and the planes and then we went, we marched forward. And then we\ncame to Benghazi. Benghazi and then to Tripoli. I don\u2019t want to get in all the details. And that\nwas it. I was there when the invasion to Italy started. So we went to get, they put us on landing\ncrafts, big landing crafts with the trucks in there. So we drove in those landing crafts and when\nwe came to Italy that was below Salerno. And we drove out and we had a nice reception there.\nLuckily I got away without any serious injuries. But then you didn\u2019t see the Germans any more.\nThey disappeared so I was in Italy. I was there for another couple of years.",
        "Q: Oh a couple of years.",
        "A: A couple of years Let me think, yeah. I joined the British Army in 1942. I remember that.\nAnd the war was over in 46.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",

        "Q: Did you go back to Palestine or you stayed in Italy, when the war was over?",
        "A: When the war was over, it wasn\u2019t over for me yet because you know the war is over, you\ndon\u2019t pack your bag and you go home. So they kept us and then I was yeah, when the\nwar was over I was close to Italy there. Not to Italy. I mean to Austria or whatever. I was very\nclose. And I took a motorcycle and I went to Germany with it.\n(Other person: You went AWOL)",
        "A: AWOL.",
        "Q: Oh you did, away without leave. A-W-O-L.",
        "A: Oh that\u2019s what it is. Away without leave. Yeah. So was they knew of course the motorcycle\nwas missing after a while and I was missing so it was the reason. The reason why I want, wanted\nto go to Germany. I wanted to go to Germany because a friend of mine, he told me that \u2014 did I\nmention that my brother, that was in Auschwitz too.",
        "Q: No you did not.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t no. He was a good mechanic and they kept them pretty \u2014 he, I didn\u2019t know much\nbut my friend, he told me, he wrote me that he\u2019s seen a list of this . So I was \u2014 and he seen\nthe name Herzog there but that\u2019s all. So I asked, but that\u2019s all. Nothing. He says that\u2019s all he\nknows. He\u2019s a survivor. So I said to myself, I\u2019m going to take a chance. You know I had no\nrights. So anyhow, how do I get there, to Germany. You know from Italy. You know, well I\nthink that\u2019s the best bet. I took the -- a bicycle and I took off. And I went to Illingen. I figured\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nmaybe I\u2019d see him there. But he wasn\u2019t there. So I asked some people and they told me that he\nwent to Munich. I don\u2019t know what he did in Munich but he\u2019s going to come back and so I was\nwaiting there two or three days and then I decided I have to go back. Yeah. Otherwise I\u2019m going\nto get in bigger trouble. So on the way back, I stopped near Frankfurt. I stopped there and I says\nlook you have come all the way down here. It took you two days and you get there. Now I\u2019m not\ngoing to leave until I know really what\u2019s going on with my brother. So I turned around and I\nwent back to Illingen. And we\u2019re not talking about from one corner to the other. That\u2019s about\n150 kilometers or something like this.\nSo and the people there are very friendly. They always want to be with us, so I have no problem\nto stay with anybody there overnight. Sure enough, a day later my brother shows up. Yes, I was\nso lucky. I said, look maybe we can arrange, that at that time, the Jewish Altrits [ph] you know\nthe arranged to illegally deport some survives. They brought them to Palestine. Somehow, I\ndon\u2019t know but I had the same chance. To bring my brother over. He says no he\u2019s going to go to\nthe states. I says all right. So I went back to my unit and the camp commander happened to be a\nJew too. And so I got a court martial and I forgot already what it was but it was not easy but it\nwas only on paper. And that was the end of it so I was there for another few months. Then I went\nback. I was discharged, kept to, I had suit, a British suit and some money. Not too much. I think\nwas like a hundred dollars something like this tops. And they let us go. And I said that to myself.\nI\u2019m not going to go to the kibbutz any more. I go to Tel Aviv.\nSo I went to Tel Aviv first in, I also had some money for a hotel for a week or so and was\nlooking for a job.",
        "Q: This is 1946 we\u2019re talking about.",
        "A: At the end of 46 yeah. And I was with a friend. And he had a sister in Tel Aviv so we went\nthere and we had dinner with them. So in exchange we washed the dishes. Yeah and finally I\nfound a job. It was very hard but I am (both talking). So I found a job in a restaurant washing\ndishes together with my friend. So but that didn\u2019t last very long because they went bankrupt for\none reason or another. And after that I was working for the British. They had on the north side\nof Tel Aviv, they had a camp with trucks. And those trucks they went out every morning to pick\nup the Middle East mail which was distributed by Jewish, not only Jewish but Arabs too. And I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nslept in that camp because I ran out of money and I had a little tent there where I slept. So and I\npicked up every morning, picked up from Tel Aviv and from Jaffa some people and brought\nthem to the camp. They got their truck and everybody took off in different directions. And that\u2019s\nwhat I did.\nAnd so I was working there for about three months. And then I, one of the guys which I picked\nup, he says why don\u2019t you come one evening? We make a little party on Friday night. We have\nthe dancing and I says ok. And that\u2019s where I met my wife. And that\u2019s the end of story.",

You cannot stay in the house\nbecause you\u2019ve got to get up, go out. And doing. And I may have, I'll tell you the whole story.\nThere was a ad looking for a young fellow who is willing to get in the clothing trade so my father\nsaid that might be the thing for you. So I volunteered. Volunteered, they volunteered me.\n(laughs)",
        "A: I was a volunteer and it lasted quite (sound interference) I would say quite a bit, might be a\ndistance from where I used to live. I would say about 150, 200 miles away. So I was there for\none night, for one night and I said to myself I don\u2019t like it here and I\u2019m not interested in this and\nI\u2019m not going to stay here. So I, I sent a telegram to my father and I wrote send me money. Or\nI\u2019m going to do something. Well they telegraphed me money and I didn\u2019t say anything to the\nowner of that place where I was supposed to work but he knew something was not kosher and he\nwas watching every move I made. So he seen me going to the post office, picking up that, the\nmoney and I didn\u2019t even take my clothes and I run to the station. And the first train was coming\njust as I got to the station, the first train came in. But I see that the owner of that store, he was\nbehind me and so I don\u2019t know if he seen me or not but he was watching more if I step in the\ntrain or not. But there was a, I seen there a big garbage disposal there and I jumped in, not to be\nseen. And wait til the train moved away and after he was gone, I got out of there, tried to clean\nmyself up a little bit. Anyhow, it worked and I got into the next train and then from there to\nMannheim. I mentioned Mannheim. There was my brother at that time. He found a trade. And so\nI figured that was on the way home. Was staying there for a day or two and then I went back\nhome. And my father asked me, what would you have done, if you wouldn\u2019t have us send the\nmoney? Because I said at that time, send me money or I\u2019m going to do something. So I said\nnothing.

I was Ha Shara and from all parts of Germany, youngsters, they came\nover there. But Cologne was not the only one. There were more but I happened to land there in\nCologne and I was there. We were, they met. To give us an idea about how things going to be in\nPalestine. And we were all sure that they\u2019re going to send us to Palestine. And they told us so\ntoo but I was one of the last ones, the newest ones who come to this place. So the way I was, so\nwe let, give me one moment please.\nYes, oh yeah. Then came an order from the Nazis that every Jewish place where everything\nJews, they are gathering together, the youngsters. They want so and so many of them they should\nwork for them. So since I was really one of the latest who came in that place, to that place. They\ndidn\u2019t want me to go. They wanted to get the elderly, the most \u2014",
        "A: The older ones, yeah. And so we were, they were not too thrilled about it so I said, I\nvolunteered and I landed up in a village not far from Berlin. And we, that was in the winter and\nthe snow was pretty high there and we are cutting trees. It was a bad experience for me because\nI always had wet feet and if I could not act with the equipment, shoes. The food was not too bad.\nWe got from the farmers. The farmers, they fed us. And we were sleeping at the haystacks.",

So I went to this Jewish Agency to Berlin and managed and I told them I\ncan\u2019t take that no more. So they sent somebody else instead me and I went back to Cologne.\nNow, from now on, I was there another -- how long, another few months and then there was a\ntrip organized going to Palestine now.\nI usually the newcomers, to there had to wait. They were not eligible but in my case they made a\ndifference because I did work for the Nazis over here. They says we\u2019ll get you on there. Now\nthe ones who organized those, a trip was only one trip. And that was the last one. The man who\norganized that, that was rich Jews and in return they took them also. They were allowed to go\nbecause the idea was to get the youngsters out ok. So in that case they added them also to \u2014 Then\nwe went to Vienna.",

        "A: No, no because we didn\u2019t see much Germans. They only were walking around and see if you\nare working or not, but other than that no, no. There was no problem. So like I said \u2014",
        "A: Not at that time. I lost communications. Yeah but later on I picked it up again. Afterwards\nwhen I knew I was going to go to Palestine I went home and that was the so called goodbye to\nmy parents. That was the last I\u2019ve seen them.",

And my parents they will report to, oh I forgot\nsomething yeah which is very important. When yes, at the 38, there was the 38 the Crystal\nNight.

        "A: For just about a week and then they drove us to the Danube, the river. And we were, there\nwere three ships and they brought us to Sulina, that\u2019s in Romania, that\u2019s beyond the Black Sea.\nFrom the Danube we went in there. And we from there, we seen the little freighter standing and\nthey transported us to the freighter. The freighter is supposed to go to Palestine. Now when we\ncame to that freighter, they had some bunks there but not enough to take care of everybody there.\nSo we were there for several weeks because they were waiting for the crew to get our ship out.\nAnd finally they came, after several weeks and then they brought us to Palestine.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t, what it meant was to just to get out. Palestine actually, I was not a Zionist. I didn\u2019t\nknow anything about that. You thought that it would appear that they were talking about\nZionists so anyhow we came to Haifa.",
        "A: Yes, yes I did. And everybody did. Practically.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",
        "A: They felt they were Germans because they were treated nice and everybody treated them nice\nuntil really shortly before the Crystal night. Then everything changed. And we knew that there\u2019s\nno future for us. And we came to Haifa so it took us a long time. I would say a couple of weeks\ntil we got there. To the \u2014",
        "A: Atific [ph]. Yeah it was a little boat. It was altogether close to a thousand tons that\u2019s all. So\nand we landed shortly before we came to \u2014 we landed in Haifa but not at the pier that is in the\nBritish. So I forgot something here, yeah. We ran out of coal. We ran out of water. We ran out\nof everything because we were several weeks on the sea. And so I volunteered to go to the\nmachine room and took care of the ovens there because I knew you get a little better food there\nwhatever. And then when we came to Haifa and there was a big ocean liner standing there. It\nwas supposed to bring us to whole lot. And one of the British islands there, Cyprus yeah. To\nCyprus. And so little by little they transferred us to that ocean liner. It was called Patcific,\nPatria. Was called Patria. And then all of a sudden nobody really wanted to go but we didn\u2019t\nhave no choice. So then the Hagenah did some things. They brought some explosives with the\nfood that they loaded. And they told everybody who was on that boat, not everybody was\ntransferred yet. Maybe were transferred I would say about 500 people and altogether we were\n900. So what happened was yeah, they told us we should go on deck in the morning. Go to the,\non deck there is a meeting so I said I\u2019m going to sleep a little longer. And then all of a sudden I\nheard a boom and I thought it was a bomb. That is over here something not 100 percent kosher\nso I was running up to the deck. And on my way up I felt already I had to hold on, on the\nrailings because the ship was leaning to the side. And then I came up to, soon I came up on top\nthere. I lost my balance and I slipped to the other side of the \u2014 and which was a little bit under\nwater already. So I had no choice. I didn\u2019t know how to swim but I jumped in the water. I had\nno choice.\nAnd some fellow seen me. He was in the water too and he seen me that I\u2019m struggling. So he\nwent behind me and he pushed me, kept on pushing me to the little boat they have which came\nto \u2014 they didn\u2019t come close to the ocean liner because they figured if something is going to\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nhappen, something going to explode better to stay away from there. So everybody who got out of\nthere had to swim a little bit. Yeah. So got there on that boat and that was in fact ok with me and\nwe kept to a big, a big hole there. How you call it. I forget. And we got clothes there and we got\nfood there. That\u2019s the Jewish Agency, they took care of everything. And the British, they\nwatched us like a hawk.",
        "A: That was, no that was in Haifa.",
        "A: We are still in Haifa. Because not everybody was yet transferred to the Patria. The ones who\nwere not transferred to the Patria yet, they think that they are the ones who sent them later to\nCyprus. So what happened to us? We went to Atlit, that\u2019s a big camp there. And we were there.\nAnd then one morning everybody, they got everybody out to Atlit, even the ones who are\nsupposed to go to Cyprus. But then the British came one morning and they got them out, the rest\nof them. They had their names. They got them out and they rejected so they had they were using\nsticks and some of the guys there, the people there, they threw their clothes away so then they\ngot, they considered that. They were standing there without clothes, without anything. But they\ntook them out anyhow.\nAnd I was in Atlit for about four months. I would say I didn\u2019t have such a bad time there because\nthe food was excellent. I was a volunteer. This time in the kitchen. And they had those big cat,\ncassels that they put the food where they made the food, I don\u2019t know exactly but there were\naltogether in the camp close to a thousand people, maybe more.\nAnd that was in the \u2014 everything was strictly kosher there.",
        "A: No, I knew how to read but it didn\u2019t mean anything to me. I didn\u2019t know the meaning of it.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",
        "A: Pardon.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So and I would say I was there for about six months. And after that I went\nto a kibbutz. They didn\u2019t ask me. They came. They let us go and there was a group already in the\nkibbutz, Ashdod Yakov. And I was there several months. And I remember it was very hot and\nso they give us lessons in Hebrew in the afternoon. In the morning, everybody has a little job,\nsomething to do. Yeah. But I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the afternoon lessons because was so\nhot outside. I couldn\u2019t keep more. So that was one thing and then I\u2019m \u2014 every kibbutz had to\nsend some people into the army at that time because there was a, they called it the Palestinian\narmy. So naturally they didn\u2019t want me to go. They wanted to go people from the kibbutz who\nare there for a long time. But they told them if you go to the army, you go to the box. The box\nthat means that\u2019s the part who stays in Palestine, doesn\u2019t go out of the country. And that\u2019s\nbecause at that time, the war was going on and didn\u2019t . And they were afraid that\nGermans getting closer and closer so it\u2019s very important to be in the country, to defend ourselves.\nBut so I didn\u2019t like the kibbutz. I didn\u2019t like the life there. I didn\u2019t like the way -- they treated us\nok but I didn\u2019t like to take orders. But anyhow, usually you take anyhow when you get into the\narmy. So I volunteered to the army and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I think I was 17 now.",
        "A: Yeah so I went to the army and they asked me over there as someone to go overseas. So ok.\nThey took me and they prepared me in Salafet. That\u2019s the, Salafet that\u2019s the place where they got\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nthe, all the people together which going to be fighting. They prepared us in Salafet, that\u2019s the\nname of a town.",
        "A: No, I did not but my sister had contacted, somehow she contacted me.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t have any. I knew through my sister that they transferred them to Lagosh [ph]\nand the trains and that they were there for several months and then they sent them to Auschwitz.\nSo now where was I?",
        "A: Yeah I got training yeah. I learned how to drive a truck. That\u2019s what. So that was another\nweek so and then they sent us to E] Aleman and I felt ok. Everything was nice and quiet. There\nwas no big action going on at that time until one night and they started. Nobody knew what\u2019s\ngoing on. We heard artillery and the planes and then we went, we marched forward. And then we\ncame to Benghazi. Benghazi and then to Tripoli. I don\u2019t want to get in all the details. And that\nwas it. I was there when the invasion to Italy started. So we went to get, they put us on landing\ncrafts, big landing crafts with the trucks in there. So we drove in those landing crafts and when\nwe came to Italy that was below Salerno. And we drove out and we had a nice reception there.\nLuckily I got away without any serious injuries. But then you didn\u2019t see the Germans any more.\nThey disappeared so I was in Italy. I was there for another couple of years.",
        "A: A couple of years Let me think, yeah. I joined the British Army in 1942. I remember that.\nAnd the war was over in 46.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",
        "A: 45, 45. But I still was in the army til 1946. Yeah. So-",
        "A: When the war was over, it wasn\u2019t over for me yet because you know the war is over, you\ndon\u2019t pack your bag and you go home. So they kept us and then I was yeah, when the\nwar was over I was close to Italy there. Not to Italy. I mean to Austria or whatever. I was very\nclose. And I took a motorcycle and I went to Germany with it.\n(Other person: You went AWOL)",
        "A: AWOL.",
        "A: Oh that\u2019s what it is. Away without leave. Yeah. So was they knew of course the motorcycle\nwas missing after a while and I was missing so it was the reason. The reason why I want, wanted\nto go to Germany. I wanted to go to Germany because a friend of mine, he told me that \u2014 did I\nmention that my brother, that was in Auschwitz too.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t no. He was a good mechanic and they kept them pretty \u2014 he, I didn\u2019t know much\nbut my friend, he told me, he wrote me that he\u2019s seen a list of this . So I was \u2014 and he seen\nthe name Herzog there but that\u2019s all. So I asked, but that\u2019s all. Nothing. He says that\u2019s all he\nknows. He\u2019s a survivor. So I said to myself, I\u2019m going to take a chance. You know I had no\nrights. So anyhow, how do I get there, to Germany. You know from Italy. You know, well I\nthink that\u2019s the best bet. I took the -- a bicycle and I took off. And I went to Illingen. I figured\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nmaybe I\u2019d see him there. But he wasn\u2019t there. So I asked some people and they told me that he\nwent to Munich. I don\u2019t know what he did in Munich but he\u2019s going to come back and so I was\nwaiting there two or three days and then I decided I have to go back. Yeah. Otherwise I\u2019m going\nto get in bigger trouble. So on the way back, I stopped near Frankfurt. I stopped there and I says\nlook you have come all the way down here. It took you two days and you get there. Now I\u2019m not\ngoing to leave until I know really what\u2019s going on with my brother. So I turned around and I\nwent back to Illingen. And we\u2019re not talking about from one corner to the other. That\u2019s about\n150 kilometers or something like this.\nSo and the people there are very friendly. They always want to be with us, so I have no problem\nto stay with anybody there overnight. Sure enough, a day later my brother shows up. Yes, I was\nso lucky. I said, look maybe we can arrange, that at that time, the Jewish Altrits [ph] you know\nthe arranged to illegally deport some survives. They brought them to Palestine. Somehow, I\ndon\u2019t know but I had the same chance. To bring my brother over. He says no he\u2019s going to go to\nthe states. I says all right. So I went back to my unit and the camp commander happened to be a\nJew too. And so I got a court martial and I forgot already what it was but it was not easy but it\nwas only on paper. And that was the end of it so I was there for another few months. Then I went\nback. I was discharged, kept to, I had suit, a British suit and some money. Not too much. I think\nwas like a hundred dollars something like this tops. And they let us go. And I said that to myself.\nI\u2019m not going to go to the kibbutz any more. I go to Tel Aviv.\nSo I went to Tel Aviv first in, I also had some money for a hotel for a week or so and was\nlooking for a job.",
        "A: At the end of 46 yeah. And I was with a friend. And he had a sister in Tel Aviv so we went\nthere and we had dinner with them. So in exchange we washed the dishes. Yeah and finally I\nfound a job. It was very hard but I am (both talking). So I found a job in a restaurant washing\ndishes together with my friend. So but that didn\u2019t last very long because they went bankrupt for\none reason or another. And after that I was working for the British. They had on the north side\nof Tel Aviv, they had a camp with trucks. And those trucks they went out every morning to pick\nup the Middle East mail which was distributed by Jewish, not only Jewish but Arabs too.

And they were very friendly, specially when they heard\nsomebody comes from Israel. And they all used to wear the Mogen David.\n(connection dropped)\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",
        "A: It\u2019s hard for me to understand now.",
        "A: A little better.",
        "A: Yes, because the like I said, the war was over a long time ago and I remember they have\ncertain laws when it comes to Jews. I remember at that time in Berlin who was the Chancellor\nin Berlin was, Gerhard something like this. Anybody who says even dirty Jew they put them in\njail. Because they felt very guilty of what happened. And so that\u2019s a big part. So they tried to do\nthe best they could. Personally since I\u2019m very familiar with the language, I didn\u2019t have any\nproblem. And there are some, some survivors from the concentration camps, some of them that\nsaid I never could go back to Germany. Well that\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s like a completely\ndifferent story now. It\u2019s not the way it was. That you cannot forget yes, but that\u2019s what it is.",
        "A: No, right now I\u2019m feeling very American. Yeah.",

        "A: I found it yeah as I found it very exciting to be an American. Because others they are also\nAmerican. Why shouldn\u2019t I be?",
        "A: I think about it when it comes to talk about and that\u2019s not very often. I wish I could wipe out\nthe biggest part of my past but I cannot wipe it out.",
        "A: The biggest, biggest part was about my parents. And otherwise when I was a youngster, that\ndoesn\u2019t bother me anymore that much now. They were fighting with other boys.",
        "A: Yes, definitely. That doesn\u2019t, that doesn\u2019t go away. That stays with me til the end of my life.\nThere\u2019s not a single day that I don\u2019t think about it.",
        "A: No, how could I be. I could be angry of somebody I know who did something but take a look\nfor instance the place back home, from Illingen. They all liked to, they loved us you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nBefore and then the time come when I came back to see my brother. The most of them still were\nthere. And they all were very happy to see me. Yeah so you can be angry of somebody you\nknow who did something. But you cannot hate the whole world. I cannot do that.",
        "A: Yes, I do and I was in Israel. At that time.",
        "A: My thought was they make a big, too big of a fuss from that. Took a long time but the trial is\nsurprise ok. I would have made it shorter if 1t would be up to me. But I always said that it\u2019s going\nto be over. And finally it did and but maybe you heard about it. The German states are still found\nanother I think three more Nazis.",
        "A: Yes, I would say at least twice a year. When my wife was alive and her family 1s still there.\nWell now it\u2019s a little difficult for me.",
        "A: Yes I do.",
        "A: Oh my thoughts about that.",
        "A: Well it\u2019s at least something that they can do that will help me in certain things you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014\nWhat was a rich guy but every little bit helps. They cannot bring the dead back, of course not.\nSo at least they pay.",
        "A: All, yes I feel Israeli too. I follow up what everything what\u2019s going on there.",
        "A: About that time in 48.",
        "A: No I know just it was big excitement for everybody. Everybody was dancing on the street and\nfor me as a family, we got our own place. It was a big excitement but the fighting started which\ndidn\u2019t take long so they attacked us from all the sides. From the north and the south and the west\nand that, I said to myself, sometimes with everything what has happened, I\u2019m still around.",
        "A: Iam wondering. And I give you one more detail that I jumped the ship. I didn\u2019t know how to\nswim. So there was one guy he seen that I was struggling and he helped me. Maybe I mentioned\nit before. And he helped me to get out. And at that time I didn\u2019t think straight. I just want to be\nalive, that\u2019s alive that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes I did. I didn\u2019t have much of a childhood.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",
        "A: No I don\u2019t think about it now.",
        "A: My experience.",
        "A: Well not so much about my background but let me put like this because the people who are, I\nam in touch with. They already know everything. Everybody who knows me who knows what I\nwent through. I know what they went through because mostly I deal with Jewish people, mostly.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Less.",
        "A: Because of what happened. I don\u2019t believe any more.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",
        "A: No, no I\u2019m not angry about anybody. What was, that was.",

        "A: Even before yes.",
        "A: If I see a movie.",
        "A: Oh no I don\u2019t want to see them anymore. It\u2019s, I don\u2019t have to jump into something but it\u2019s not\nnecessary. I\u2019ve seen it, \u2019ve seen it more than once ok. The Nazis. Something like this no.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMarch 6, 2014",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it will happen again. But even though the world doesn\u2019t, I think didn\u2019t learn\nmuch what happened, but I don\u2019t think it should happen again. No. That\u2019s my opinion.",
        "A: Well it was nice talking to you. I don\u2019t think I have anything special right now.\n"
