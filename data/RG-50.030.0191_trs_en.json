        "Q: Would you state your name, please?",
        "A: My name 1s Milner Roberts.",
        "Q: Can we have a little background information from you, General Roberts?",
        "A: Well, I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in September of 1918 and spent most of my\nearly life there. I went to high school in a suburb of Pittsburgh, and from there I went to\nLehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania where I majored in metallurgy and had a\nminor in English and journalism, and also you might say a minor in military. And I was\ncommissioned a second lieutenant infantry reserve in May of 1940, when war was already\nraging in Europe, and they weren't calling us up at that point. So I went into industry and\nworked in Detroit for a while for a machine tool manufacturer -- was assigned to the\nChrysler tank arsenal where they were making the brand new medium tank, then called the\nGeneral Grant. Our tools were being used to machine parts of it. On December 7th, 1941, I\nwas minding my own business, driving down one of the major streets in Detroit listening to\nmy car radio, and Pearl Harbor was announced. So I thought, well, Roberts, look around.\nYou're not going to be around here very long, which turned out to be very accurate. That\nhappened to be a Sunday. he next day I went back to the tank arsenal and there was an\nordnance lieutenant colonel there in charge for the army. He knew I was a reserve officer and\nhe said, \"Roberts, why don't you go and put your uniform on? Come by, I'll put you to\nwork,\" and I said, \"Well, that's a nice idea, but I don't think the infantry would really like that\nand, furthermore, my father wouldn't like that either because he was a combat officer in\nWorld War I and he thinks that I ought to be a combat officer. So thanks very much.\" So\nsure enough, in about a week, they sent me preliminary orders and I reported at Fort\nBenning, Georgia where I went through a course to start with and then became an instructor\nin weapons. And from April, 1942 until June of 1943, I taught OSC, the general art of\nhandling machine guns and related items. And by June of 1943 I was thinking, gee, I'm here\non a training base and there's action elsewhere, and if I don't get out of here, the war might\nbe over. So I put in for the airborne and next thing I knew I was a glider infantry company\ncommander assigned to a newly organized airborne division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\nSo I went through all of the glider training for the next six months, and then the War\nDepartment, as it was called in those days, decided that they had made a mistake. They had\ntoo many glider elements and not enough parachute elements. So they said, we're going to\nbreak up this glider regiment and send you guys to Europe because they may need you over\nthere. So in the end of March or early April, 1944, I found myself in Bristol, England,\nearmarked for the 101st Airborne Division. Well, actually, I didn't look forward to flying\nover the English Channel in a glider but, anyway, that was the assignment until about five\ndays before the actual attack, which people had been talking about for literally years. When\nis the second front going to open? When are you going into Europe? I found myself assigned\nas a tactical aide to the commander of what turned out to be Omaha Beach, and this was a\nGeneral Leonard Gerow, commanding the Fifth Army Corps. So he said, \"Roberts,\" he said,\n\"Do you know how to read a map?\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\" He said, \"You know how to read a\nphoto map?\" I said, \"That in particular, because in the gliders, you didn't have any handy\ndandy maps with you. You had aerial photos -- about all you had.\" He said, \"Okay. We'll\ngive you the job.\" So I landed on D-Day with elements of the 16th Infantry in the First\nDivision right in the middle of Omaha Beach. It was called the Easy Red section.",
        "Q: A misnomer?",
        "A: Well, in a way it was a misnomer from the point of being easy, but from the point of view of\nbeing red, it had something along that line. They divided the beachhead into different\nsections, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, and George, and then each one of those with the red and\nwhite type, all for planning purposes. So without going into any great detail, I survived D-\nDay. Then for the rest of the campaign in Normandy, I would be sent out with elements of\nour combat forces every day and then report back to the general on what I had observed. And\nthis was a period when we were stalemated for awhile in what was called the Hedgerow area\nof Normandy, but we finally made a breakout in July at and within a matter of about 10 days,\nwe had swung around and headed east and actually bottled up almost the whole German\nseventh army in an area called Falaise. It was the so- called Falaise gap, and we effectively\ndestroyed the German resistance in France because -- it wasn't true for the whole country,\nbut it certainly was true for that section of France, west of the Seine River. And then we were\ngiven the opportunity to liberate Paris on the 25th of August, 1944, and that was a great\noccasion but we didn't stay long. They said, well, now, you guys go chasing Germans east of\nhere. So within a matter of about three days, we got to Sedan, which had been featured in\nWorld War I, and then we really didn't have too much effective resistance in our area. We\ngot to Bastogne, which is a pleasant little town, and we got there and we were stopped at\nwhat the Germans call the Siegfried Line, which is a line of fortifications somewhat parallel\nto the French Maginot Line but somewhat removed from it. The principle reason we were\nstopped was because we were running out of our fuel and food. Our supply line went all the\nway back to the beaches and it became difficult to really move forward and have supplies\ncatch up. Furthermore, there was a fair amount of opposition further south. After General\nPatton's Third Army got to Metz, it was stalemated for a relatively short time. And then there\nwere some problems in the Vosges Mountains further south. The northern advance had been\nfaster than the southern advance. And then I was relieved from my assignment as an aide\nbecause General Gerow had been head of the War Plans Division at the time of Pearl\nHarbor, and the first Pearl Harbor Inquiry in the Congress was made in that fall. So they call\nhim back to Washington, and he said, \"Roberts, what do you want to do?\" I said, \"Well, sir,\nwhat I really want to do is to match my old man's accomplishment, who got to be a major in\nWorld War I. So I would like to get promoted.\" He said, \"Okay. I'll put you in a staff section\nwhere you can have the opportunity to get promoted. So at that point, he put me in what was\ncalled G-5, Military Government Civil Affairs Operation of the Corps, and I continued in\nthat until the end the of the war when I was reassigned to the G-2 section, which is\nintelligence. So we got involved with the Battle of the Bulge, very heavily involved on the\nnorthern shoulder, and we were confronted with the 12th S.S. Panzer division, sometimes\ncalled Hitler Jugend. We had already been in touch with a couple of other S.S. Panzer\ndivisions, the Ist Panzer division of Adolph Hitler and the 2nd Das Reich and we were\naccustomed to these guys. We also had been up against some of their elite units -- 3rd\nParachute Division and other kinds of divisions -- but the northern shoulder held pretty\nwell.\u2019 And by February, we were straightening out the line and ready to move to the Rhine.\nWe got to the Rhine in early March of 1945, particularly to a place called Remagen where\nthe Germans tried to blow up the railroad bridge but failed. They seriously weakened it, but\nnot enough to prevent a number of our people from crossing over and getting a beachhead on\nthe other side of the Rhine, which was significant. The 69th Division is the one that actually\ncrossed that bridge. We then put pontoon bridges across the Rhine at Neuwied, which was\nquite a job. The Rhine is a very fast-moving stream, four or five miles an hour, which, if you\ntry to put pontoons across it, it takes a little doing. We had two of them across there, one east\nbound, one west bound. It was at Neuwied that we first ran across some very unhappy\npeople. These were not political refugees. They were prisoners of war who had been poorly\ntreated. They were all emaciated, not in very good shape, but at least they were alive and we\n-- that was a portrait, a kind of a little future look at what we might find later. So we then\ncircled around and completed the southern pincer of the Ruhr envelopment. The Ruhr area --\nheavily industrial, Krupp works, this kind of thing. And we closed the gap and captured tens\nof thousands of prisoners, and it was obvious that the end was coming along pretty soon. So\nafter that we headed east again and against limited opposition. I can recall going through\nKassel, a pretty good size town. The main street was probably four miles long, and in that\nentire four miles, I didn't find one building that was still intact. There were a lot of buildings\nwith the walls up but the roofs burned off. It had been pretty heavily damaged. But on the\noutskirts of Kassel, we found an airplane production plant that was still going strong until we\ngot there. So the Germans still had considerable capability even though they had been very\nheavily bombed. But just about the time we left Kassel, we found a very hideous sight, and\nthat was an insane asylum called Hadamar. Hadamar had been an ordinary institution for the\nmentally infirm probably back to maybe 1900, but after Hitler came to power in 1933 and\nbegan his pogrom against the Jews, he also found it convenient to try to get rid of a lot of\nnon-Jews who were political opponents. So sometime in the late '30s, they passed a law\nwhich said that if you were found to be insane, you would be assigned to an insane asylum\nwhere you would be eliminated; because the theory was that the insane people might\nprocreate and their progeny then would injure the purity of the Nordic race. I think that was\nthe theory. You know, it's almost laughable, this kind of thing. Anyway, when we got to\nHadamar, we found just mounds of clothing, men and women's clothing, and at that point, no\nbodies. They had already disposed of them. But we found something else, the S.S. Totenkopf\nelements of the S.S. divisions. Well, actually, it was a separate organization for prison guards\n-- had taken skulls and with a band saw, had cut them around about this area, and then there\nwas a little depression in the resulting top of the skull. And they had used these to have toasts\nto the greater glorification of the Reich, I suppose. Well, that's pretty hard to believe, that\nkind of a thing, but there it was.\n' The aforementioned divisions comprised units of the German Sixth SS Panzer Army under the\ncommand of SS Colonel Josef Dietrich.",
        "Q: Did you inspect the buildings there?",
        "A: I did not, no. Some of our other people did but I didn't have really enough time to do that.\nBut I did see the skulls, which made a great impression on everybody. We began to grasp\nthen the awful dimensions of what evidently had been going on.",
        "Q: Did you inspect the grounds at all? Do you know whether there were any gas chambers or\nany other facilities?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. There were gas chambers because that's how they dispose of these people, but not\non the scale of an Auschwitz or a Buchenwald or any of these other places. This was a\nsomewhat limited operation but, nevertheless, just as deadly.",
        "Q: Do you know how they disposed of the bodies?",
        "A: I think they buried them in mass graves. They certainly didn't bury them individually. And I\ndon't think that -- I don't know what the final report was. I didn't see it, but that's our\nimpression. They certainly didn't have individual burials. I think they just buried them in a\nmass grave, other than the ones they burned up. Anyway, we further -- went further east, and\nit was just at that time that Franklin Roosevelt died. I was in a jeep listening to the armed\nforces network when they announced that Roosevelt died, which really was a profound\nshock to everybody. I think it was the 13th of April, either the 12th or the 13th, and we were\ndismayed at the fact that he was the leader who had decided that he was going to carry out\nthe four freedoms and we were in the process of doing part of that, and he was gone. And we\nhad little knowledge of Harry Truman so -- but we couldn't afford to think about it too much.\nWe had other things to do. So we proceeded over towards Gottingen, a famous university\ntown going back hundreds of years, and it was a pleasure to note that Gottingen wasn't\ndamaged much. By the time you go through a lot of the village towns that have been terribly\nshot up, it gets depressing. That town was not badly shot up except for the Bahnhof, the\nrailroad station, which 1s always a point of attack. And it was there that I was assigned to\ntake the surrender of a German general who had passed the word that he would like to\nsurrender. It turned out that he had been injured on the eastern front and been sent back to his\nhome for recuperation. And now with his hometown completely in the possession of the\nAmericans, he felt he better opt to surrender rather than being forced to. So I and my jeep\ndriver went up to his house. My jeep driver, by the way, was a young Jewish boy named\nHarry Adler. I'll have more on him later. So I went up to the door, and the general in full\nregalia -- he was a General Korps Infantrie, which is the same as a three star general. He'd\nbeen a German corps commander. He came out in his full regalia with his hat on and the\nuniform. He saluted. I saluted him back. He then ceremoniously presented me with his\nLuger, which I said, \"Fine, good. Get out and get in the jeep.\" And then he said, \"I can get in\nthe back.\" I said, \"No, I don't think so. I think you ought to ride in the front. I'll be in the\nback.\" For all I know, he might have had another Luger. So then he said, \"Well, now, I have\nto see your general.\" All this was in German and Harry Adler was translating. So I said,\n\"Well, we'll see.\" So I took him to a P.W. cage as it was called, just an enclosure for\nprisoners, and I turned the general over to those people and that's the last I saw of him;\nexcept later on I heard he was highly incensed because they wouldn't permit him to talk to\nour general. He was briefed by probably some captain -- or debriefed. He didn't know much.\nHe'd been out of action for two or three months. But my jeep driver, Harry Adler. Harry was\nborn of a Jewish family in Germany, I suppose about 1925, something like that. So as a\nyouth in the mid-'30s, his father thought, I don't like the way things are going here. So I think\nit was about 1938, the family got out of Germany and went into France. And so young Adler\nwas sent to school in France, what turned out to be Vichy France, and then he, of course,\nthen learned to speak French. But about the time of the Vichy surrender to the Nazis, the\nfather said,\"This isn't very good either. Let's see 1f we can get to America.\" And so they got\nthrough into Spain or Portugal, I've forgotten which. Anyway, they finally got to New York\nabout 1940. So the young Adler was then sent to American high school, by that time he'd\nhad a little Lyceum in France. So by 1942 or '43 when he went in the army, he was trilingual,\nGerman, French, and English, and he was exactly what I needed, because I had a lot of high\nschool French but I had no German. It wasn't popular in those days, post World War I, to\nteach German because of the World War I situation. So as Adler and I were traveling around\ntogether, he was very much aware of what had been going on and he was very happy to be\ninvolved in taking a German general prisoner. But not long after that, in fact, on the 19th and\n20th of April, we captured Leipzig, which was a major city, and then we began to find some\nreally grisly things. About that same time the unit to our right or south of us had overrun\nBuchenwald. I was not involved in the direct liberation or -- you couldn't call it liberation, I\nguess. You can call it the capture of Buchenwald. But I did go down there because of my\nmilitary assignment, and there they had a lot of bodies not burned yet, and they were stacked\nup.",
        "Q: How soon after its liberation, for lack of a better word?",
        "A: Maybe two or three days. I wasn't there at the beginning.",
        "Q: How long did you stay there?",
        "A: Oh, it was just to visit, to see what was going on.",
        "Q: What did you see?",
        "A: Well, I saw a lot of bodies and I wasn't sure what they were going to do with them. I don't\nthink they were going to continue burning them because at that point they might have been\nable to identify some of them, but I have no exact knowledge of what they did. I do have\nmore knowledge of another one a little later. So we're talking about Leipzig.",
        "Q: Could you go back to Buchenwald and just describe what you did see when you arrived\nthere?",
        "A: Well, we went through the usual surroundings of heavily wired and floodlighted guard\nstations and this kind of thing and a lot of the barracks, and then the crematortum which we\nhad pictures of. I don't have pictures of that, but in my history we do. And it was obvious that\nthey had burned thousands of bodies there. How many thousands, we never knew. And they\nstill had some left to burn when we got there. But there were also some still -- some people\nstill survived.",
        "Q: Did you see the survivors?",
        "A: I saw a couple of them who were very emaciated and almost living skeletons, basically. It\nwasn't pleasant to look at them. Now what we did, of course, the American army would\nimmediately give them medical treatment and suitable clothing and, obviously, food and\nshelter. What happened to them later, I don't know.",
        "Q: Do you know the numbers in terms of survivors, how many survived?",
        "A: I don't know how many survived Buchenwald.",
        "Q: How many did you see?",
        "A: Oh, I only saw maybe 15 or 20. There were maybe -- have been more but not many.",
        "Q: Where were they physically located?",
        "A: They were -- apparently had been put in one barracks which, for some special reason, I don't\nknow, but they were probably people who they wanted to use for some particular purpose.",
        "Q: Did you go into the barracks?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Inspect any of them?",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "Q: Did you know of any other buildings?",
        "A: There was a headquarters -- it looked like a headquarters building, but I didn't go in there\neither. Actually it was out of my territory. In the army you're supposed to follow certain\nguidelines, and I went down there more or less just to see what was going on and with no\nresponsibility for it. But to get back to the Leipzig area, shortly after we got there, we\ndiscovered what had been a camp for slave labor. And this was a little town, more or less an\nindustrial suburb of Leipzig, northeast of the town and, like all of these places, it had been\nrun by the deaths head units of the S.S. Totenkopf. They would march these prisoners out\nduring the day and use them in the factories and then take them back at night. I doubt -- I\nhave no knowledge exactly, but I doubt if there were many Jews in this group, because I\nthink most of the Jews by that time, by late -- 20, 21st of April, had already been disposed of;\nbut there's really no way to tell because there was nobody alive when we got there. Anyway,\nthey had moved out the bulk of those people and marched them further east away from us --\nfor what good that did -- because if they marched them very far, they were going into the\nRussians. But the ones remaining who were apparently not too able, physically ill or maybe\ndisabled, they put in a wooden barracks, which apparently -- then they put some kerosene or\nsome kind of flammable on the roof and started it on fire with thermite grenades. Then they\nhad the S.S. guards standing around in case anybody got out, which some people did, and\nthey shot them down with the Schmeisser machine pistols. But the building was completely\ndestroyed. It was still smoldering when I got there and there was nothing but, for the most\npart, very badly burned-up bodies, various stages of burning. There were several corpses that\nwere entwined in the concertina wire that they had gotten to the point where they were trying\nto break away and then burned up. And there were others who had gotten up without\nburning, and they were shot down in their prison clothing. We really -- I couldn't believe\nwhat I was looking at. I should have by that time, but it's still hard to believe that humanity\nwill do something like this, particularly people who are disadvantaged. You put in and burn\nthem alive. For what reason? It was obvious the war was virtually over. These people weren't\ngoing to do any damage to anybody. It has to take a very twisted mind to authorize and carry\nout something like this.",
        "Q: How large of a barrack was it?",
        "A: I would say they were about a hundred feet long and probably about 30 feet wide.",
        "Q: Was it just one barrack?",
        "A: No. There were others that were not touched, but they put them all in one barracks, the one\nthat they burned up, but there were others that were still there with nobody in them.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea how many bodies were burned?",
        "A: We estimated at the time about 150, although I have a history book here of our operations\nwhich said 300, but I doubt that. I don't think there were that many. Now, at that time our\nunits met the Russians at the Elbe River at Torgau, and therefore our eastward movement at\nthat point was over. So we were in position for about five days. And what to do with this\nmassacre? So we decided, well, what we're going to do for one thing 1s to go around in\nLeipzig and surrounding areas and if there's anybody who has any significant position left,\nadmitted, we'll take him up there and run him through this place and let them see what\nhappened, which we did, and some of the women fainted. They couldn't stand it, which I can\nunderstand, but they all said, \"We had nothing to do with this.\" As we said, you couldn't find\na Nazi in a carload. And then we said okay, the bodies have been decomposing, what was\nleft of them, for about four or five days. We'll have them prepare them for burial. So we got\nsome of the good Burgers and said okay, we want these bodies prepared for burial and we're\ngoing to bury them in the middle of one of your most revered historic areas, which was a\nmonument in downtown Leipzig to a victory of the German forces during the Napoleonic\nwars. And there was a little ceremony and we had them actually dig the graves, individually,\nof course. And we said, well, maybe we made some kind of impression at least. That's what\nwe were trying to do. But we were a military unit. We weren't actually supposed to be in that\nbusiness, but we did what we could. Then we got orders to go south, directly south towards\nNuremberg, and we put our headquarters at Grafenwohr, which was a major German\ntraining base then and, in fact, was used by the American army all during the cold war later.\nWe got to Nuremberg. It was very, very badly destroyed. The one thing that we found made\na lasting impression on me. During the glory days of Hitler, he would have mass rallies in\nwhich they had tens of thousands of people and torches with flames coming up and red\nbanners with a swastika on them. And he'd be up there like Fidel Castro, just giving forth his\noratory, which he was master of, and everybody was shouting. When I saw the place, it was\nempty except we used it for a dump for GI salvage and some trucks sitting around with some\nboys, and I thought, well, it's a far cry from what Mr. Hitler was doing here. Then this was\nfirst couple of days of May of 1945 and we had become part of the Third Army, at that point\nGeneral Patton's army, otherwise we had been in the First Army for the entire campaign. So\nthe orders were move into Czechoslovakia. And so beginning on the fourth -- third or fourth\nof May, we began crossing the line into Czechoslovakia and actually used for the first time\nthe 16th Armored Division, which went in and occupied Plzen\u2019. The Second Infantry\nDivision was involved, the 97th infantry division was involved. And we found out when we\ngot to Plzen that the people in Prague were screaming to have us come over there; but\nunfortunately, as history later showed, we were stopped 18 kilometers east of Plzen because\nof the deal that was worked out at Yalta to between Churchill and Stalin and Roosevelt --\nand you may have seen the pictures of Roosevelt at that meeting. He was a very frail man,\nand it was literally about two months before his death and he may not have been thinking as\nclearly, but the agreement then was that Czechoslovakia would be part of -- under Russian\ncontrol more or less. So when we got into Plzen, we sent a task force over. The Russians\nweren't even to Prague by that time and I got there into Prague a little later. And the Czechs\nwere just as enthusiastic about seeing us as the French had been when we got to Paris. But\nthen another unfortunate thing came up. We had been in the place for maybe two hours. We\nhad a French liaison officer with us and he had been looking around the countryside. And we\nhad bypassed, as we were moving so fast, a place called Flossenburg where there was\nanother Buchenwald on a small scale. And he came in to us and said, \"Mon dieu! Mon dieu!\nThey are burning the bodies. They are burning the bodies.\" Okay. What bodies? Where?\nWho? \"Oh, down here, so come along.\" So some of us went down there and, sure enough,\nthese German workers with piles of bodies still there were pushing them in and burning them\nup. Well, there was absolutely no way we could identify any of these. They were beginning\nto be in an advanced state of decomposition, so we said, well, it's not appropriate to burn. On\nthe other hand, we just can't let them sit there so, actually, they were bulldozed in a mass\ngrave.\n* Also: Pilsen (German).",
        "Q: How many bodies were there?",
        "A: Oh, there must have been a couple hundred and nobody had interfered with them. The\npeople from the 2nd Division to our north had bypassed us and the 16th Armored had\nbypassed us and they were in kind of an off area so -- the guards had gone. I mean there\nwasn't any -- no guards around the place. They knew what was going on, but these workers\nwere still dutifully carrying out their job. And so this one was one that we actually saw in\noperation.",
        "Q: Were there any survivors?",
        "A: No. We didn't see any survivors. Now there may have been survivors who -- when the\nguards took off, also took off because it's quite understandable. I mean, if you got a chance to\nget out of there, you got out.",
        "Q: Can you describe the physical characteristics?",
        "A: It was a similar place to Buchenwald but a much smaller scale. There was not as many\nbuildings, the crematoria that existed there were not as large a scale, and it seemed to us as\nthough this were kind of a last kind of addition to this whole series of Auschwitz and all the\nrest of them. And so in any case, like this, including the one near Leipzig.",
        "Q: Can we just go back Flossenbiirg? Can you tell us when that was?",
        "A: It would have been on the -- either the third or fourth of May, 1945\u201d, and unfortunately it\ndoes not mention it in this book because the -- this book that I'm going to read something\nfrom was published very shortly after V-Day in Europe. It says on the cover from '42 to the\n9th of May of '45, and I think some of the details of that kind of thing were just not put in\nhere but -- oh, I was going to tell you that once we discovered something like this, the\nelements of the military police get involved. The Judge Advocate General people get\ninvolved and they then began to do an official history of what was found, when, where, and\nall the details. And I am sure that in the archives of the American Army, there is a complete\ndescription of what they found at Flossenburg.",
        "Q: Were there any prior briefings as to what to expect?",
        "A: No. I think the reason for that was that they didn't fully grasp what the potential was. They\nmight have decided to do something like that, certainly after they came across Buchenwald,\nwhich was about the same time they discovered others further south, but we had no actual\n\u00b0 According to the International Refugee Organization, Flossenbiirg was liberated on 23 April 1945\nfollowing a mass evacuation of most of the prisoners to Dachau three days earlier.\nformal instructions. What we did know was, number one, take care of any survivors\nmedically and also see to their welfare; that is, proper food and a place to stay, clothing, and\nthen have them interrogated by the representatives of the Criminal Investigation Division of\nour military police detachments -- CID it was called -- and then also have some JAG people\nthere to see from that point of view what was going on. But this was kind of a do as you find\nit. I don't recall any at that point -- I'm still talking about the battle phase of this -- at that\npoint any formal directives along this line. Now we had formal directives for the recovery of\nallied military personnel. In other words, this was what they called RAMP, acronym,\nrecovery Allied military personnel. And those directives were pretty clearly in place, and I\nmay be wrong, but I never saw any specific directives for this type of thing. I think they just\ndidn't anticipate it.",
        "Q: Any policy for what to do with the bodies?",
        "A: We had no directives. All we had was what you might call common sense. We felt that if we\ncould identify any of them, that's one thing, but no dog tags on them. I mean there simply\nwas no way to identify them and you couldn't let them rot.",
        "Q: How did this affect you personally?",
        "A: Oh, it was very bad. Let me give you an example of that. After V-E Day we were\nheadquartered in Plzen and we had a major problem with displaced persons, mostly eastern\nEuropean, but a few from the west, who obviously wanted to go home. But things were in\nsuch turmoil that we just couldn't send them home. We had to do something with them. So\nwe put them mainly in the Kaserns, previous German military installations\u2019, where at night\nthey would have a place to stay and a place where we could feed them and take care of them.\nBut there we had to maintain some kind of discipline. You just can't allow people in a very\ndistraught frame of mind to be on their own. And we weren't putting in any harsh discipline -\n- that I'll mention in a minute -- but we had to see if they had certain standards. And I was\nvisiting one of these places one day, probably about the middle of May 1945.",
        "Q: And where was this located?",
        "A: This was located outside Plzen, Czechoslovakia and I was going around inspecting. By this\ntime I was a major on the general staff. And I discovered in one the body of an infant who\nhad just died, apparently, and a rather distraught young mother. And I was so kind of\nhardened to this kind of thing, I really forgot my humanity. \"You can't have something like\nthis around here. Get that body out of here.\" I mean there wasn't any kind of spontaneous,\n\"Oh, my goodness, this is such a tragedy and this is such a terrible thing. We want for you to\nhave a proper funeral.\" At that point I had become, let's say, just kind of a hardened or\nembittered whatever to this kind of thing, and I thought to myself, well, boy, that -- that\n* German: barracks.\nwasn't the way to behave. But when you ask if it had an effect, I think that probably was the\nresult of seeing these unbelievable massacres and deliberate execution of totally innocent\npeople. It certainly affects you.",
        "Q: Were most of these D.P.s Jews?",
        "A: No, no. Most of them were Hungarians, some Poles, some people probably from Romania,\nfrom other parts of Czechoslovakia. They were mostly Slovak people who were impressed\ninto serving the Reich. Another thing that happened in our area at that point was the\ndiscovery of about 35 young women who were all that was left of -- I think they said\nsomething like 1500 women who had been marched by the Germans away from the\nadvancing Russians for maybe six weeks. And they had marched them in columns and fed\nthem practically nothing, and when they would keel over, they would just shoot them. And\nwe didn't discover this for several days after V-E Day. But we did find this small group of\nsurvivors, none of whom were more than 25, but they all looked like about 85, and they were\nemaciated, they were in terrible shape. And they told us a story and that led to a full-blown\ninvestigation.",
        "Q: Do you remember where they came from originally?",
        "A: They came, apparently, from Poland originally and they may have been Jewish. I really don't\nknow. I kind of doubt it because why would they march them that-- they'd probably just send\nthem to Auschwitz-- but at least they were about as badly treated as you can get. So another\nexample of man's inhumanity.",
        "Q: And they were discovered where?",
        "A: In the vicinity of Plzen, not far from where we were. They were out in the woods\nsomewhere, hiding.",
        "Q: So at that point, there were no longer guards?",
        "A: No, no. The word got around pretty fast that showing up in a German uniform wasn't a good\nidea unless you were getting away from the Russians. That's another story. About, oh, the\nday after V-E Day, my driver Adler and I were sent on a mission beyond our demarcation\nline. I don't remember why, but we were by ourselves in a jeep on a rural road. We were on a\nbend in the road and we discovered a whole German battalion, which kind of surprised us.\nThey had stacked arms, which I was pleased to see, and they came rushing out and said,\n\"Kamerad, Kamerad!\" So we stopped. And I didn't understand what the guy was saying, but\nthe German officer was telling us they wanted to surrender, surrender the sooner the better.\nSo Adler was getting a huge charge out of this. Here was this little Jewish boy taking a part\nin a surrender of a whole German battalion. So I said, \"All nght. We'll be back.\" So we drove\non down and accomplished our mission, whatever it was, I've forgotten. I think it was a\nrailway car we had discovered they thought had certain documents in it. Anyway, on the way\nback the officer said, \"So what are you going to do?\" I said, \"Just take it easy. We will send\npeople back here.\" So we got back to the lines. We said, \"Hey, send a detail out there and\nmarch those guys in.\" But, boy, they didn't want to surrender to the Russians. No way. They\nwanted to get back to American lines. And that happened in many places. This was just one\nexample. Having battled the Germans from Normandy to Czechoslovakia, when I went\naround that corner and saw a whole battalion, 1t shook me up a little bit, momentarily.",
        "Q: Now you indicated that you wanted to read something from the Corps History. Would you\nwant to show the book so we can see the cover?",
        "A: Right. Now, this a printed description of the incident I've told you about near Leipzig\n(reads): \"At the industrial town of Thekla northeast of Leipzig, our troops overran another\npolitical prison camp which still showed evidence of a horrible massacre on the previous\nday. With rescue by the Americans only a few hours away, inmates were herded into one\nlong wooden barracks by their brutal S.S. guards. After locking the doors and covering the\nwindows, the guards then threw incendiary grenades upon the roof. In a moment the whole\nstructure was a roaring inferno filled with screaming human beings. A few broke out into the\nopen, only to be met by a hail of rifle fire which cut them down, their clothing still burning.\nThe smaller number that escaped had cleared their way through thick rolls of barbed wire,\ntearing their burning flesh in a miraculous dash to safety. The rest were shot down and their\nnaked charred bodies were still there when our troops arrived. So here on the outskirts of one\nof Germany's greatest cities, world famous for its beautiful buildings, its culture, its\nmonuments to great men,\" Leipzig, that is, there stood a monument to a new type of\nGerman culture that the world should never forget.\u201d And this was written in June of 1945.\nAnd so this tells you how we felt about this kind of thing that we had uncovered. I think it's\nsignificant that it's in that book. Primarily that book is telling about the military operations.\nOf course, we didn't run across too much of this, but it was incidental to the principle\npurpose, which is to record how this -- how the whole battle went, who was involved, where,\nwhen, and where.",
        "Q: I heard you have two artifacts. Would you like to explain to us what they are and how you\ncame about them?",
        "A: Well, this one is a ceremonial dagger. There were a number of different Nazi organizations,\nsome military, some paramilitary, and they all had their own --",
        "Q: Excuse me. Could you jut turn it a little bit, face up?\n> United States War Crimes Investigating Team 6822 reported that Barrack No. 5 of the Thekla\nlabor camp, a subcommando of Buchenwald, was set afire on 18 April 1945 by guards and that 90\nprisoners died either in the fire or were shot in the attempt of escape.\n(Source: International Tracing Service of the International Refugee Organization.)",
        "A: They all had their own -- their own handy dandy daggers which could, of course, be used\neffectively. This shows you what it would be like to be stuck with one of these and, of\ncourse, that's a swastika here, and also up here, as a matter of fact, the name of the person\nwho owned it on the back and his town. This was Neuwied where I got this, just on the\nRhine River, on the east bank of the Rhine River. So you could use something like this to\nobviously kill somebody. Then after the person was dead, there's another type of ceremonial\nweapon -- you could hardly call this a dagger -- with which you could chop up the bodies.\nThis is basically a saw for cutting through bone. So you take your bayonet type and slice up\nthe flesh after killing the person, and then you come along if you want to, let's say, cut off the\nhead with the bone structure of the neck. You've got the serrated portions here to act like a\nsaw, and the German insignia up on top. I got several other of this type of thing which I still\nhave, but I brought two of them along today just to give you an idea of the kind of thing we\ndiscovered.",
        "Q: Were these carried by officers?",
        "A: No, not necessarily. This could have been carried by NCOs as well as officers and I'm not\ncertain if this one was actually an S.S. type. It looks like it but I'm not a hundred percent\nsure. I know there are now books where you can find -- which you can totally identify these\nthings. I have another one which is silver with a pearl handle.",
        "Q: Let's take a break.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: General, if you could explain the picture that we have?",
        "A: Yes. That picture shows what is left and what we found of the remains of the people in that\nbarracks that I talked about being deliberately burned. These remains, the corpses, you can\nsee were huddled together, and died together and there's nothing left of the buildings except\nthe ashes of these burned up bodies. Now some of them --",
        "Q: Can you again tell us the geographic location?",
        "A: Yeah. This happened in a little industrial suburb of Leipzig called Thekla, which I would\nguess was probably 12 or 14 kilometers northeast of Leipzig. And these people who were\nlargely eastern Europeans, had been treated as slave labor by the Nazis and were working in,\nfor one thing, an aircraft parts factory, and there may have been a couple of other places they\nworked. They would take them out during the day and bring them back to these barracks. As\nI said, when we approached, they marched out, some of them could still maneuver pretty\nwell. The rest of them they loaded in this barracks and burned to death.",
        "Q: Okay. Where these bodies are huddled, that's the center of what would have been the\nbarracks?",
        "A: Yes. It's approximately the center of what would have been the barracks. The outline of the\nbarracks 1s still there, of course.",
        "Q: And what is depicted in the background?",
        "A: The background shows another barracks similar to the one that was burned up. They didn't\nchoose to burn all the barracks. They just burned the one in which they had all these people\nen masse.",
        "Q: And this is an original photograph?",
        "A: These pictures were taken within 48 hours after the event, maybe less than that, and by a\nSignal Corps photographer. Contrary to army regulations, he gave me a copy of them which\nI have kept every since because, as I mentioned earlier, I couldn't believe what I was looking\nat. I thought, well, here it 1s.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to tell us about that particular photograph?",
        "A: Not especially. It just shows that when people are in a desperate situation, they'll either fight\nor flee, and some of them were deciding to try to do something. They got together and they\nwere just burned up en masse. Others decided to flee and were able to get out of the building,\na few without being burned, who were then machine gunned down, and others who were\nobviously on fire when they got out of the building. And we'll see in just a moment, if you'll\ntake a look at the next picture.",
        "Q: Okay. Would you describe the next picture for us?",
        "A: Yes. This shows about four, five, or six badly burned corpses which were outside the\nperimeter of the building and who -- obviously their clothing was on fire and they were\nburned to death outside the building trying to get out, and desperate to get to the fence and\ntrying to get out.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection of how far the bodies were from the actual building?",
        "A: Well, those bodies would be perhaps 20 to 30 feet, not very far. If you're burning from head\nto foot, you're not going to move too far. It's a very grisly thing to look at and very, very hard\nto comprehend what people will do to other people.",
        "Q: Did you determine whether these people had been shot, in addition?",
        "A: No, they had not been shot, no. They hadn't been shot. There wasn't any point in shooting\nthem. I imagine that by the time they hit the ground, they were either dead or close to it.",
        "Q: This also was taken by the same photographer?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. All these pictures were taken by the same photographer at the same time. I might\nhave mentioned the nonfraternization policy that the Army had, with good reason it turned\nout. We were not supposed to have any relations with German civilians except very\nperfunctory ones, such as where 1s the town hall and where 1s the railway station and that\nkind of thing but since -- at the time this policy was prepared, they weren't aware of how bad\nthe situation was, but they didn't want the GIs cozying up to the Germans at that point. And a\nnumber of our troops who were of German descent were pretty embarrassed about the whole\ndeal. It didn't make them proud to have been of German descent. And then you think about\nthe -- as this book says, the great accomplishments of the Germans tn the arts and music and\nscience and even theology, Martin Luther. And you come down to something like that and\nyou wonder how it can happen.",
        "Q: (Inaudible.)",
        "A: Provisional. Yeah. By that time we had no further use for anti-aircraft battalions, so they set\nup a provisional organization called security guards, and the letters on the helmet indicate\nthat. These were -- they had nearly enough military police or regular organization to go\naround to handle everything we had run across, so they conferred these A.A. battalions\nprimarily to security police and had their helmets painted accordingly.",
        "Q: Would you describe this photograph here?",
        "A: Yes. This shows more of the victims who, in their desperation to flee to safety, even though\non fire, got as far as the concertina wire that is formed around the enclosure but then\ncollapsed. You can see that their bodies continued to burn at that point. There were others\nwho actually got into the wire and twisted up in the wire, and then were a few others who\nmanaged to get there without being on fire. We have a couple of pictures showing that there\nwere some who got out with their clothes but they, again, were machine-gunned by the\nTotenkopf unit of the S.S.",
        "Q: There's one more.",
        "A: This picture shows the perimeter of the area and the type of wire enclosure they had and also\nthe floodlights so that they could illuminate it by night, and what you see up in the distance\nis a guard station. And the area was divided into a couple sections and you can see that this\nwas a path through two of the sections. The barracks aren't visible here because -- I think one\nof them is possibly visible on the right but that's off to one side. But it shows you the type of\nenclosure that they kept these people in, not nearly as elaborate as they would have around\nsome of the bigger places like Dachau or Auschwitz or Buchenwald, but then on a smaller\nscale. And they weren't organized for the same purpose, but the results were the same.",
        "Q: After leaving Flossenbiirg, where did you go from there?",
        "A: We went into Plzen and then I think I mentioned 18 kilometers east of Plzen, we were\nstopped and we were there until the 18th of June, 1945 when they pulled us out. They said\nyou're the people with amphibious attack experience, so we're going to take you out here and\nsend you back to the States. And after you have a month of R & R, so called, we will get you\naboard a ship and send you to the Pacific, because we're going to be needing your assistance\nin the invasion of the main island of Japan, Honshu. And this was scheduled for October of\n1945. Still you'll have enough time to see your friends when you get back to the States and\nthen we'll ship you out to the west coast, and from there we will ship you to the Philippines.\nAnd from the Philippines then, you will be used probably in a secondary landing after the\nprinciple one. So we thought, well, we're not looking forward to assaulting Japan, but we are\nlooking forward to getting back to the States. So we left LeHavre on the fifth of July, 1945\non board a very fast liner that had been the USS America. The army called it the West Point\nduring World War II and crossed the ocean in about six days. We got back to Manhattan and\nwe were among the early troops back so they had a big celebration for us. They had some\nvessels out in New York Harbor. They had fire boats shooting off the water, and they had\npeople with jazz bands playing and whatever, whistles blowing. We thought that was nice,\nbut it was even nicer to see the Statue of Liberty and be back home. And from there we were,\nas I say, given 30 days off. And at the end of the 30 days, the bomb went off in Japan and\nthat precluded our use in the invasion of Japan, which suited us just fine, because if, 1n fact,\nTruman had not made that decision, it would have been anybody's guess, probably half a\nmillion casualties, both American and Japanese, and there had been enough death and dying\nalready without that. So they let the genie out of the bottle as far as nuclear weapons are\nconcered, but since they haven't been used since, it probably was a good idea in the first\nplace. It saved a lot of lives at that time.",
        "Q: How long did you remain in the service?",
        "A: Well, in October of 1945 they said to me, \"Now, Roberts, would you like to stay on active\nduty?\" And I thought, well, the Army's going to be dullsville. Europe 1s flat on its back, so is\nJapan. America is preeminent total world power. Who's going to start a war? I don't want to\ndo close-order drill. So thanks a lot, but I'll go back home. But I did say I would like to have\na commission as a major in the reserve. So that was forthcoming. And I did go back home\nand I got into the advertising and public relations field. At the same time in the late 40s, they\nstarted to organize the reserve and I became increasingly active in that. And as a matter of\nfact, when Korea broke out, I was on active duty; but for reasons that the army later\nregretted, they didn't make use of organized reserve components very much then. They did to\nsome extent, but if they had used more, it might have turned out a little differently. Anyway,\nfor the next 20 years virtually I was increasingly active 1n the reserve. I went to the Army\nWar College at Carlisle. I went to the Command General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth,\nand by 1967 the Army then put me in charge of all the Army reserves in eastern Ohio, West\nVirgina, and western Pennsylvania. Then in 1970 they asked me to come back on full duty in\nthe Pentagon, initially as a Deputy Chief of the Army Reserve on the army general staff, and\nthen as Chief of the Army Reserve from 1971 to 1975. So I had an unusual career in that I\nhad four years early on of full duty, and five years virtually of full duty at the end, and\nreserve duty in between with many periods of active service and schooling. I was promoted\nto major general as I assumed Chief of the Army Reserve at the beginning of May, rather, in\nMay of 1971, and so I'm now a major general of the United States Army, retired. I'm wearing\nan insignia today of the Distinguished Service Medal, which we used to call the general's\ngood conduct medal.",
        "Q: Have you previously discussed your experiences in Europe and what you saw with other\ngroups or people or with the service?",
        "A: Not specifically in this type of area. I did do an audio oral history for the Army War College\nat Carlisle, which took me through, of course, my experiences in World War II and my early\nexperience and subsequent, but there was no concentration on this type of atrocity thing,\nalthough it was mentioned but not as much as we have done today. There have been some\nreferences to that history. A chap published a book recently in which he attributed some of\nhis comments to my oral history. So since I left the active army for nine years, I became\nexecutive director of the Reserve Officer's Association, which is a major military lobby on\nCapitol Hill. Since then, I have been working with General Daniel Graham and the Strategic\nDefense Initiative program, which seems to be going along in good shape now, despite many\nof our critics who wish we would go away, but we haven't.",
        "Q: Are there any concluding remarks you wish to make?",
        "A: Yeah. I think that it's fair to say that the American public represents a force for good in the\nworld. We have plenty of blemishes in this country and things we have done that we\nshouldn't have done, maybe things that we could do but haven't done, but by and large, the\nUnited States stands as a good moral force for good in this world. We're always the first to\nsend relief anywhere in the world, whether it's former foes or friends. The U.S. built up\nEurope after the war with the Marshall Plan. The U.S. handled the Japanese in a very\npositive way. And when things have gotten out of shape, why, dear old Uncle Sam was\nasked to come forth. And we've done that and I have been proud to be a part of that total\noperation.",

        "A: My name 1s Milner Roberts.",
        "A: Well, I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in September of 1918 and spent most of my\nearly life there. I went to high school in a suburb of Pittsburgh, and from there I went to\nLehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania where I majored in metallurgy and had a\nminor in English and journalism, and also you might say a minor in military. And I was\ncommissioned a second lieutenant infantry reserve in May of 1940, when war was already\nraging in Europe, and they weren't calling us up at that point. So I went into industry and\nworked in Detroit for a while for a machine tool manufacturer -- was assigned to the\nChrysler tank arsenal where they were making the brand new medium tank, then called the\nGeneral Grant. Our tools were being used to machine parts of it. On December 7th, 1941, I\nwas minding my own business, driving down one of the major streets in Detroit listening to\nmy car radio, and Pearl Harbor was announced. So I thought, well, Roberts, look around.\nYou're not going to be around here very long, which turned out to be very accurate. That\nhappened to be a Sunday. he next day I went back to the tank arsenal and there was an\nordnance lieutenant colonel there in charge for the army. He knew I was a reserve officer and\nhe said, \"Roberts, why don't you go and put your uniform on? Come by, I'll put you to\nwork,\" and I said, \"Well, that's a nice idea, but I don't think the infantry would really like that\nand, furthermore, my father wouldn't like that either because he was a combat officer in\nWorld War I and he thinks that I ought to be a combat officer. So thanks very much.\" So\nsure enough, in about a week, they sent me preliminary orders and I reported at Fort\nBenning, Georgia where I went through a course to start with and then became an instructor\nin weapons. And from April, 1942 until June of 1943, I taught OSC, the general art of\nhandling machine guns and related items. And by June of 1943 I was thinking, gee, I'm here\non a training base and there's action elsewhere, and if I don't get out of here, the war might\nbe over. So I put in for the airborne and next thing I knew I was a glider infantry company\ncommander assigned to a newly organized airborne division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\nSo I went through all of the glider training for the next six months, and then the War\nDepartment, as it was called in those days, decided that they had made a mistake. They had\ntoo many glider elements and not enough parachute elements. So they said, we're going to\nbreak up this glider regiment and send you guys to Europe because they may need you over\nthere. So in the end of March or early April, 1944, I found myself in Bristol, England,\nearmarked for the 101st Airborne Division. Well, actually, I didn't look forward to flying\nover the English Channel in a glider but, anyway, that was the assignment until about five\ndays before the actual attack, which people had been talking about for literally years. When\nis the second front going to open? When are you going into Europe? I found myself assigned\nas a tactical aide to the commander of what turned out to be Omaha Beach, and this was a\nGeneral Leonard Gerow, commanding the Fifth Army Corps. So he said, \"Roberts,\" he said,\n\"Do you know how to read a map?\" I said, \"Yes, sir.\" He said, \"You know how to read a\nphoto map?\" I said, \"That in particular, because in the gliders, you didn't have any handy\ndandy maps with you. You had aerial photos -- about all you had.\" He said, \"Okay. We'll\ngive you the job.\" So I landed on D-Day with elements of the 16th Infantry in the First\nDivision right in the middle of Omaha Beach. It was called the Easy Red section.",
        "A: Well, in a way it was a misnomer from the point of being easy, but from the point of view of\nbeing red, it had something along that line. They divided the beachhead into different\nsections, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, and George, and then each one of those with the red and\nwhite type, all for planning purposes. So without going into any great detail, I survived D-\nDay. Then for the rest of the campaign in Normandy, I would be sent out with elements of\nour combat forces every day and then report back to the general on what I had observed. And\nthis was a period when we were stalemated for awhile in what was called the Hedgerow area\nof Normandy, but we finally made a breakout in July at and within a matter of about 10 days,\nwe had swung around and headed east and actually bottled up almost the whole German\nseventh army in an area called Falaise. It was the so- called Falaise gap, and we effectively\ndestroyed the German resistance in France because -- it wasn't true for the whole country,\nbut it certainly was true for that section of France, west of the Seine River. And then we were\ngiven the opportunity to liberate Paris on the 25th of August, 1944, and that was a great\noccasion but we didn't stay long. They said, well, now, you guys go chasing Germans east of\nhere. So within a matter of about three days, we got to Sedan, which had been featured in\nWorld War I, and then we really didn't have too much effective resistance in our area. We\ngot to Bastogne, which is a pleasant little town, and we got there and we were stopped at\nwhat the Germans call the Siegfried Line, which is a line of fortifications somewhat parallel\nto the French Maginot Line but somewhat removed from it. The principle reason we were\nstopped was because we were running out of our fuel and food. Our supply line went all the\nway back to the beaches and it became difficult to really move forward and have supplies\ncatch up. Furthermore, there was a fair amount of opposition further south. After General\nPatton's Third Army got to Metz, it was stalemated for a relatively short time. And then there\nwere some problems in the Vosges Mountains further south. The northern advance had been\nfaster than the southern advance. And then I was relieved from my assignment as an aide\nbecause General Gerow had been head of the War Plans Division at the time of Pearl\nHarbor, and the first Pearl Harbor Inquiry in the Congress was made in that fall. So they call\nhim back to Washington, and he said, \"Roberts, what do you want to do?\" I said, \"Well, sir,\nwhat I really want to do is to match my old man's accomplishment, who got to be a major in\nWorld War I. So I would like to get promoted.\" He said, \"Okay. I'll put you in a staff section\nwhere you can have the opportunity to get promoted. So at that point, he put me in what was\ncalled G-5, Military Government Civil Affairs Operation of the Corps, and I continued in\nthat until the end the of the war when I was reassigned to the G-2 section, which is\nintelligence. So we got involved with the Battle of the Bulge, very heavily involved on the\nnorthern shoulder, and we were confronted with the 12th S.S. Panzer division, sometimes\ncalled Hitler Jugend. We had already been in touch with a couple of other S.S. Panzer\ndivisions, the Ist Panzer division of Adolph Hitler and the 2nd Das Reich and we were\naccustomed to these guys. We also had been up against some of their elite units -- 3rd\nParachute Division and other kinds of divisions -- but the northern shoulder held pretty\nwell.\u2019 And by February, we were straightening out the line and ready to move to the Rhine.\nWe got to the Rhine in early March of 1945, particularly to a place called Remagen where\nthe Germans tried to blow up the railroad bridge but failed. They seriously weakened it, but\nnot enough to prevent a number of our people from crossing over and getting a beachhead on\nthe other side of the Rhine, which was significant. The 69th Division is the one that actually\ncrossed that bridge. We then put pontoon bridges across the Rhine at Neuwied, which was\nquite a job. The Rhine is a very fast-moving stream, four or five miles an hour, which, if you\ntry to put pontoons across it, it takes a little doing. We had two of them across there, one east\nbound, one west bound. It was at Neuwied that we first ran across some very unhappy\npeople. These were not political refugees. They were prisoners of war who had been poorly\ntreated. They were all emaciated, not in very good shape, but at least they were alive and we\n-- that was a portrait, a kind of a little future look at what we might find later. So we then\ncircled around and completed the southern pincer of the Ruhr envelopment. The Ruhr area --\nheavily industrial, Krupp works, this kind of thing. And we closed the gap and captured tens\nof thousands of prisoners, and it was obvious that the end was coming along pretty soon. So\nafter that we headed east again and against limited opposition. I can recall going through\nKassel, a pretty good size town. The main street was probably four miles long, and in that\nentire four miles, I didn't find one building that was still intact. There were a lot of buildings\nwith the walls up but the roofs burned off. It had been pretty heavily damaged. But on the\noutskirts of Kassel, we found an airplane production plant that was still going strong until we\ngot there. So the Germans still had considerable capability even though they had been very\nheavily bombed. But just about the time we left Kassel, we found a very hideous sight, and\nthat was an insane asylum called Hadamar. Hadamar had been an ordinary institution for the\nmentally infirm probably back to maybe 1900, but after Hitler came to power in 1933 and\nbegan his pogrom against the Jews, he also found it convenient to try to get rid of a lot of\nnon-Jews who were political opponents. So sometime in the late '30s, they passed a law\nwhich said that if you were found to be insane, you would be assigned to an insane asylum\nwhere you would be eliminated; because the theory was that the insane people might\nprocreate and their progeny then would injure the purity of the Nordic race. I think that was\nthe theory. You know, it's almost laughable, this kind of thing. Anyway, when we got to\nHadamar, we found just mounds of clothing, men and women's clothing, and at that point, no\nbodies. They had already disposed of them. But we found something else, the S.S. Totenkopf\nelements of the S.S. divisions. Well, actually, it was a separate organization for prison guards\n-- had taken skulls and with a band saw, had cut them around about this area, and then there\nwas a little depression in the resulting top of the skull. And they had used these to have toasts\nto the greater glorification of the Reich, I suppose. Well, that's pretty hard to believe, that\nkind of a thing, but there it was.\n' The aforementioned divisions comprised units of the German Sixth SS Panzer Army under the\ncommand of SS Colonel Josef Dietrich.",
        "A: I did not, no. Some of our other people did but I didn't have really enough time to do that.\nBut I did see the skulls, which made a great impression on everybody. We began to grasp\nthen the awful dimensions of what evidently had been going on.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. There were gas chambers because that's how they dispose of these people, but not\non the scale of an Auschwitz or a Buchenwald or any of these other places. This was a\nsomewhat limited operation but, nevertheless, just as deadly.",
        "A: I think they buried them in mass graves. They certainly didn't bury them individually. And I\ndon't think that -- I don't know what the final report was. I didn't see it, but that's our\nimpression. They certainly didn't have individual burials. I think they just buried them in a\nmass grave, other than the ones they burned up. Anyway, we further -- went further east, and\nit was just at that time that Franklin Roosevelt died. I was in a jeep listening to the armed\nforces network when they announced that Roosevelt died, which really was a profound\nshock to everybody. I think it was the 13th of April, either the 12th or the 13th, and we were\ndismayed at the fact that he was the leader who had decided that he was going to carry out\nthe four freedoms and we were in the process of doing part of that, and he was gone. And we\nhad little knowledge of Harry Truman so -- but we couldn't afford to think about it too much.\nWe had other things to do. So we proceeded over towards Gottingen, a famous university\ntown going back hundreds of years, and it was a pleasure to note that Gottingen wasn't\ndamaged much. By the time you go through a lot of the village towns that have been terribly\nshot up, it gets depressing. That town was not badly shot up except for the Bahnhof, the\nrailroad station, which 1s always a point of attack. And it was there that I was assigned to\ntake the surrender of a German general who had passed the word that he would like to\nsurrender. It turned out that he had been injured on the eastern front and been sent back to his\nhome for recuperation. And now with his hometown completely in the possession of the\nAmericans, he felt he better opt to surrender rather than being forced to. So I and my jeep\ndriver went up to his house. My jeep driver, by the way, was a young Jewish boy named\nHarry Adler. I'll have more on him later. So I went up to the door, and the general in full\nregalia -- he was a General Korps Infantrie, which is the same as a three star general. He'd\nbeen a German corps commander. He came out in his full regalia with his hat on and the\nuniform. He saluted. I saluted him back. He then ceremoniously presented me with his\nLuger, which I said, \"Fine, good. Get out and get in the jeep.\" And then he said, \"I can get in\nthe back.\" I said, \"No, I don't think so. I think you ought to ride in the front. I'll be in the\nback.\" For all I know, he might have had another Luger. So then he said, \"Well, now, I have\nto see your general.\" All this was in German and Harry Adler was translating. So I said,\n\"Well, we'll see.\" So I took him to a P.W. cage as it was called, just an enclosure for\nprisoners, and I turned the general over to those people and that's the last I saw of him;\nexcept later on I heard he was highly incensed because they wouldn't permit him to talk to\nour general. He was briefed by probably some captain -- or debriefed. He didn't know much.\nHe'd been out of action for two or three months. But my jeep driver, Harry Adler. Harry was\nborn of a Jewish family in Germany, I suppose about 1925, something like that. So as a\nyouth in the mid-'30s, his father thought, I don't like the way things are going here. So I think\nit was about 1938, the family got out of Germany and went into France. And so young Adler\nwas sent to school in France, what turned out to be Vichy France, and then he, of course,\nthen learned to speak French. But about the time of the Vichy surrender to the Nazis, the\nfather said,\"This isn't very good either. Let's see 1f we can get to America.\" And so they got\nthrough into Spain or Portugal, I've forgotten which. Anyway, they finally got to New York\nabout 1940. So the young Adler was then sent to American high school, by that time he'd\nhad a little Lyceum in France. So by 1942 or '43 when he went in the army, he was trilingual,\nGerman, French, and English, and he was exactly what I needed, because I had a lot of high\nschool French but I had no German. It wasn't popular in those days, post World War I, to\nteach German because of the World War I situation. So as Adler and I were traveling around\ntogether, he was very much aware of what had been going on and he was very happy to be\ninvolved in taking a German general prisoner. But not long after that, in fact, on the 19th and\n20th of April, we captured Leipzig, which was a major city, and then we began to find some\nreally grisly things. About that same time the unit to our right or south of us had overrun\nBuchenwald. I was not involved in the direct liberation or -- you couldn't call it liberation, I\nguess. You can call it the capture of Buchenwald. But I did go down there because of my\nmilitary assignment, and there they had a lot of bodies not burned yet, and they were stacked\nup.",
        "A: Maybe two or three days. I wasn't there at the beginning.",
        "A: Oh, it was just to visit, to see what was going on.",
        "A: Well, I saw a lot of bodies and I wasn't sure what they were going to do with them. I don't\nthink they were going to continue burning them because at that point they might have been\nable to identify some of them, but I have no exact knowledge of what they did. I do have\nmore knowledge of another one a little later. So we're talking about Leipzig.",
        "A: Well, we went through the usual surroundings of heavily wired and floodlighted guard\nstations and this kind of thing and a lot of the barracks, and then the crematortum which we\nhad pictures of. I don't have pictures of that, but in my history we do. And it was obvious that\nthey had burned thousands of bodies there. How many thousands, we never knew. And they\nstill had some left to burn when we got there. But there were also some still -- some people\nstill survived.",
        "A: I saw a couple of them who were very emaciated and almost living skeletons, basically. It\nwasn't pleasant to look at them. Now what we did, of course, the American army would\nimmediately give them medical treatment and suitable clothing and, obviously, food and\nshelter. What happened to them later, I don't know.",
        "A: I don't know how many survived Buchenwald.",
        "A: Oh, I only saw maybe 15 or 20. There were maybe -- have been more but not many.",
        "A: They were -- apparently had been put in one barracks which, for some special reason, I don't\nknow, but they were probably people who they wanted to use for some particular purpose.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I did not.",
        "A: There was a headquarters -- it looked like a headquarters building, but I didn't go in there\neither. Actually it was out of my territory. In the army you're supposed to follow certain\nguidelines, and I went down there more or less just to see what was going on and with no\nresponsibility for it. But to get back to the Leipzig area, shortly after we got there, we\ndiscovered what had been a camp for slave labor. And this was a little town, more or less an\nindustrial suburb of Leipzig, northeast of the town and, like all of these places, it had been\nrun by the deaths head units of the S.S. Totenkopf. They would march these prisoners out\nduring the day and use them in the factories and then take them back at night. I doubt -- I\nhave no knowledge exactly, but I doubt if there were many Jews in this group, because I\nthink most of the Jews by that time, by late -- 20, 21st of April, had already been disposed of;\nbut there's really no way to tell because there was nobody alive when we got there. Anyway,\nthey had moved out the bulk of those people and marched them further east away from us --\nfor what good that did -- because if they marched them very far, they were going into the\nRussians. But the ones remaining who were apparently not too able, physically ill or maybe\ndisabled, they put in a wooden barracks, which apparently -- then they put some kerosene or\nsome kind of flammable on the roof and started it on fire with thermite grenades. Then they\nhad the S.S. guards standing around in case anybody got out, which some people did, and\nthey shot them down with the Schmeisser machine pistols. But the building was completely\ndestroyed. It was still smoldering when I got there and there was nothing but, for the most\npart, very badly burned-up bodies, various stages of burning. There were several corpses that\nwere entwined in the concertina wire that they had gotten to the point where they were trying\nto break away and then burned up. And there were others who had gotten up without\nburning, and they were shot down in their prison clothing. We really -- I couldn't believe\nwhat I was looking at. I should have by that time, but it's still hard to believe that humanity\nwill do something like this, particularly people who are disadvantaged. You put in and burn\nthem alive. For what reason? It was obvious the war was virtually over. These people weren't\ngoing to do any damage to anybody. It has to take a very twisted mind to authorize and carry\nout something like this.",
        "A: I would say they were about a hundred feet long and probably about 30 feet wide.",
        "A: No. There were others that were not touched, but they put them all in one barracks, the one\nthat they burned up, but there were others that were still there with nobody in them.",
        "A: We estimated at the time about 150, although I have a history book here of our operations\nwhich said 300, but I doubt that. I don't think there were that many. Now, at that time our\nunits met the Russians at the Elbe River at Torgau, and therefore our eastward movement at\nthat point was over. So we were in position for about five days. And what to do with this\nmassacre? So we decided, well, what we're going to do for one thing 1s to go around in\nLeipzig and surrounding areas and if there's anybody who has any significant position left,\nadmitted, we'll take him up there and run him through this place and let them see what\nhappened, which we did, and some of the women fainted. They couldn't stand it, which I can\nunderstand, but they all said, \"We had nothing to do with this.\" As we said, you couldn't find\na Nazi in a carload. And then we said okay, the bodies have been decomposing, what was\nleft of them, for about four or five days. We'll have them prepare them for burial. So we got\nsome of the good Burgers and said okay, we want these bodies prepared for burial and we're\ngoing to bury them in the middle of one of your most revered historic areas, which was a\nmonument in downtown Leipzig to a victory of the German forces during the Napoleonic\nwars. And there was a little ceremony and we had them actually dig the graves, individually,\nof course. And we said, well, maybe we made some kind of impression at least. That's what\nwe were trying to do. But we were a military unit. We weren't actually supposed to be in that\nbusiness, but we did what we could. Then we got orders to go south, directly south towards\nNuremberg, and we put our headquarters at Grafenwohr, which was a major German\ntraining base then and, in fact, was used by the American army all during the cold war later.\nWe got to Nuremberg. It was very, very badly destroyed. The one thing that we found made\na lasting impression on me. During the glory days of Hitler, he would have mass rallies in\nwhich they had tens of thousands of people and torches with flames coming up and red\nbanners with a swastika on them. And he'd be up there like Fidel Castro, just giving forth his\noratory, which he was master of, and everybody was shouting. When I saw the place, it was\nempty except we used it for a dump for GI salvage and some trucks sitting around with some\nboys, and I thought, well, it's a far cry from what Mr. Hitler was doing here. Then this was\nfirst couple of days of May of 1945 and we had become part of the Third Army, at that point\nGeneral Patton's army, otherwise we had been in the First Army for the entire campaign. So\nthe orders were move into Czechoslovakia. And so beginning on the fourth -- third or fourth\nof May, we began crossing the line into Czechoslovakia and actually used for the first time\nthe 16th Armored Division, which went in and occupied Plzen\u2019. The Second Infantry\nDivision was involved, the 97th infantry division was involved. And we found out when we\ngot to Plzen that the people in Prague were screaming to have us come over there; but\nunfortunately, as history later showed, we were stopped 18 kilometers east of Plzen because\nof the deal that was worked out at Yalta to between Churchill and Stalin and Roosevelt --\nand you may have seen the pictures of Roosevelt at that meeting. He was a very frail man,\nand it was literally about two months before his death and he may not have been thinking as\nclearly, but the agreement then was that Czechoslovakia would be part of -- under Russian\ncontrol more or less. So when we got into Plzen, we sent a task force over. The Russians\nweren't even to Prague by that time and I got there into Prague a little later. And the Czechs\nwere just as enthusiastic about seeing us as the French had been when we got to Paris. But\nthen another unfortunate thing came up. We had been in the place for maybe two hours. We\nhad a French liaison officer with us and he had been looking around the countryside. And we\nhad bypassed, as we were moving so fast, a place called Flossenburg where there was\nanother Buchenwald on a small scale. And he came in to us and said, \"Mon dieu! Mon dieu!\nThey are burning the bodies. They are burning the bodies.\" Okay. What bodies? Where?\nWho? \"Oh, down here, so come along.\" So some of us went down there and, sure enough,\nthese German workers with piles of bodies still there were pushing them in and burning them\nup. Well, there was absolutely no way we could identify any of these. They were beginning\nto be in an advanced state of decomposition, so we said, well, it's not appropriate to burn. On\nthe other hand, we just can't let them sit there so, actually, they were bulldozed in a mass\ngrave.\n* Also: Pilsen (German).",
        "A: Oh, there must have been a couple hundred and nobody had interfered with them. The\npeople from the 2nd Division to our north had bypassed us and the 16th Armored had\nbypassed us and they were in kind of an off area so -- the guards had gone. I mean there\nwasn't any -- no guards around the place. They knew what was going on, but these workers\nwere still dutifully carrying out their job. And so this one was one that we actually saw in\noperation.",
        "A: No. We didn't see any survivors. Now there may have been survivors who -- when the\nguards took off, also took off because it's quite understandable. I mean, if you got a chance to\nget out of there, you got out.",
        "A: It was a similar place to Buchenwald but a much smaller scale. There was not as many\nbuildings, the crematoria that existed there were not as large a scale, and it seemed to us as\nthough this were kind of a last kind of addition to this whole series of Auschwitz and all the\nrest of them. And so in any case, like this, including the one near Leipzig.",
        "A: It would have been on the -- either the third or fourth of May, 1945\u201d, and unfortunately it\ndoes not mention it in this book because the -- this book that I'm going to read something\nfrom was published very shortly after V-Day in Europe. It says on the cover from '42 to the\n9th of May of '45, and I think some of the details of that kind of thing were just not put in\nhere but -- oh, I was going to tell you that once we discovered something like this, the\nelements of the military police get involved. The Judge Advocate General people get\ninvolved and they then began to do an official history of what was found, when, where, and\nall the details. And I am sure that in the archives of the American Army, there is a complete\ndescription of what they found at Flossenburg.",
        "A: No. I think the reason for that was that they didn't fully grasp what the potential was. They\nmight have decided to do something like that, certainly after they came across Buchenwald,\nwhich was about the same time they discovered others further south, but we had no actual\n\u00b0 According to the International Refugee Organization, Flossenbiirg was liberated on 23 April 1945\nfollowing a mass evacuation of most of the prisoners to Dachau three days earlier.\nformal instructions. What we did know was, number one, take care of any survivors\nmedically and also see to their welfare; that is, proper food and a place to stay, clothing, and\nthen have them interrogated by the representatives of the Criminal Investigation Division of\nour military police detachments -- CID it was called -- and then also have some JAG people\nthere to see from that point of view what was going on. But this was kind of a do as you find\nit. I don't recall any at that point -- I'm still talking about the battle phase of this -- at that\npoint any formal directives along this line. Now we had formal directives for the recovery of\nallied military personnel. In other words, this was what they called RAMP, acronym,\nrecovery Allied military personnel. And those directives were pretty clearly in place, and I\nmay be wrong, but I never saw any specific directives for this type of thing. I think they just\ndidn't anticipate it.",
        "A: We had no directives. All we had was what you might call common sense. We felt that if we\ncould identify any of them, that's one thing, but no dog tags on them. I mean there simply\nwas no way to identify them and you couldn't let them rot.",
        "A: Oh, it was very bad. Let me give you an example of that. After V-E Day we were\nheadquartered in Plzen and we had a major problem with displaced persons, mostly eastern\nEuropean, but a few from the west, who obviously wanted to go home. But things were in\nsuch turmoil that we just couldn't send them home. We had to do something with them. So\nwe put them mainly in the Kaserns, previous German military installations\u2019, where at night\nthey would have a place to stay and a place where we could feed them and take care of them.\nBut there we had to maintain some kind of discipline. You just can't allow people in a very\ndistraught frame of mind to be on their own. And we weren't putting in any harsh discipline -\n- that I'll mention in a minute -- but we had to see if they had certain standards. And I was\nvisiting one of these places one day, probably about the middle of May 1945.",
        "A: This was located outside Plzen, Czechoslovakia and I was going around inspecting. By this\ntime I was a major on the general staff. And I discovered in one the body of an infant who\nhad just died, apparently, and a rather distraught young mother. And I was so kind of\nhardened to this kind of thing, I really forgot my humanity. \"You can't have something like\nthis around here. Get that body out of here.\" I mean there wasn't any kind of spontaneous,\n\"Oh, my goodness, this is such a tragedy and this is such a terrible thing. We want for you to\nhave a proper funeral.\" At that point I had become, let's say, just kind of a hardened or\nembittered whatever to this kind of thing, and I thought to myself, well, boy, that -- that\n* German: barracks.\nwasn't the way to behave. But when you ask if it had an effect, I think that probably was the\nresult of seeing these unbelievable massacres and deliberate execution of totally innocent\npeople. It certainly affects you.",
        "A: No, no. Most of them were Hungarians, some Poles, some people probably from Romania,\nfrom other parts of Czechoslovakia. They were mostly Slovak people who were impressed\ninto serving the Reich. Another thing that happened in our area at that point was the\ndiscovery of about 35 young women who were all that was left of -- I think they said\nsomething like 1500 women who had been marched by the Germans away from the\nadvancing Russians for maybe six weeks. And they had marched them in columns and fed\nthem practically nothing, and when they would keel over, they would just shoot them. And\nwe didn't discover this for several days after V-E Day. But we did find this small group of\nsurvivors, none of whom were more than 25, but they all looked like about 85, and they were\nemaciated, they were in terrible shape. And they told us a story and that led to a full-blown\ninvestigation.",
        "A: They came, apparently, from Poland originally and they may have been Jewish. I really don't\nknow. I kind of doubt it because why would they march them that-- they'd probably just send\nthem to Auschwitz-- but at least they were about as badly treated as you can get. So another\nexample of man's inhumanity.",
        "A: In the vicinity of Plzen, not far from where we were. They were out in the woods\nsomewhere, hiding.",
        "A: No, no. The word got around pretty fast that showing up in a German uniform wasn't a good\nidea unless you were getting away from the Russians. That's another story. About, oh, the\nday after V-E Day, my driver Adler and I were sent on a mission beyond our demarcation\nline. I don't remember why, but we were by ourselves in a jeep on a rural road. We were on a\nbend in the road and we discovered a whole German battalion, which kind of surprised us.\nThey had stacked arms, which I was pleased to see, and they came rushing out and said,\n\"Kamerad, Kamerad!\" So we stopped. And I didn't understand what the guy was saying, but\nthe German officer was telling us they wanted to surrender, surrender the sooner the better.\nSo Adler was getting a huge charge out of this. Here was this little Jewish boy taking a part\nin a surrender of a whole German battalion. So I said, \"All nght. We'll be back.\" So we drove\non down and accomplished our mission, whatever it was, I've forgotten. I think it was a\nrailway car we had discovered they thought had certain documents in it. Anyway, on the way\nback the officer said, \"So what are you going to do?\" I said, \"Just take it easy. We will send\npeople back here.\" So we got back to the lines. We said, \"Hey, send a detail out there and\nmarch those guys in.\" But, boy, they didn't want to surrender to the Russians. No way. They\nwanted to get back to American lines. And that happened in many places. This was just one\nexample. Having battled the Germans from Normandy to Czechoslovakia, when I went\naround that corner and saw a whole battalion, 1t shook me up a little bit, momentarily.",
        "A: Right. Now, this a printed description of the incident I've told you about near Leipzig\n(reads): \"At the industrial town of Thekla northeast of Leipzig, our troops overran another\npolitical prison camp which still showed evidence of a horrible massacre on the previous\nday. With rescue by the Americans only a few hours away, inmates were herded into one\nlong wooden barracks by their brutal S.S. guards. After locking the doors and covering the\nwindows, the guards then threw incendiary grenades upon the roof. In a moment the whole\nstructure was a roaring inferno filled with screaming human beings. A few broke out into the\nopen, only to be met by a hail of rifle fire which cut them down, their clothing still burning.\nThe smaller number that escaped had cleared their way through thick rolls of barbed wire,\ntearing their burning flesh in a miraculous dash to safety. The rest were shot down and their\nnaked charred bodies were still there when our troops arrived. So here on the outskirts of one\nof Germany's greatest cities, world famous for its beautiful buildings, its culture, its\nmonuments to great men,\" Leipzig, that is, there stood a monument to a new type of\nGerman culture that the world should never forget.\u201d And this was written in June of 1945.\nAnd so this tells you how we felt about this kind of thing that we had uncovered. I think it's\nsignificant that it's in that book. Primarily that book is telling about the military operations.\nOf course, we didn't run across too much of this, but it was incidental to the principle\npurpose, which is to record how this -- how the whole battle went, who was involved, where,\nwhen, and where.",
        "A: Well, this one is a ceremonial dagger. There were a number of different Nazi organizations,\nsome military, some paramilitary, and they all had their own --\n> United States War Crimes Investigating Team 6822 reported that Barrack No. 5 of the Thekla\nlabor camp, a subcommando of Buchenwald, was set afire on 18 April 1945 by guards and that 90\nprisoners died either in the fire or were shot in the attempt of escape.\n(Source: International Tracing Service of the International Refugee Organization.)",
        "A: They all had their own -- their own handy dandy daggers which could, of course, be used\neffectively. This shows you what it would be like to be stuck with one of these and, of\ncourse, that's a swastika here, and also up here, as a matter of fact, the name of the person\nwho owned it on the back and his town. This was Neuwied where I got this, just on the\nRhine River, on the east bank of the Rhine River. So you could use something like this to\nobviously kill somebody. Then after the person was dead, there's another type of ceremonial\nweapon -- you could hardly call this a dagger -- with which you could chop up the bodies.\nThis is basically a saw for cutting through bone. So you take your bayonet type and slice up\nthe flesh after killing the person, and then you come along if you want to, let's say, cut off the\nhead with the bone structure of the neck. You've got the serrated portions here to act like a\nsaw, and the German insignia up on top. I got several other of this type of thing which I still\nhave, but I brought two of them along today just to give you an idea of the kind of thing we\ndiscovered.",
        "A: No, not necessarily. This could have been carried by NCOs as well as officers and I'm not\ncertain if this one was actually an S.S. type. It looks like it but I'm not a hundred percent\nsure. I know there are now books where you can find -- which you can totally identify these\nthings. I have another one which is silver with a pearl handle.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Yes. That picture shows what is left and what we found of the remains of the people in that\nbarracks that I talked about being deliberately burned. These remains, the corpses, you can\nsee were huddled together, and died together and there's nothing left of the buildings except\nthe ashes of these burned up bodies. Now some of them --",
        "A: Yeah. This happened in a little industrial suburb of Leipzig called Thekla, which I would\nguess was probably 12 or 14 kilometers northeast of Leipzig. And these people who were\nlargely eastern Europeans, had been treated as slave labor by the Nazis and were working in,\nfor one thing, an aircraft parts factory, and there may have been a couple of other places they\nworked. They would take them out during the day and bring them back to these barracks. As\nI said, when we approached, they marched out, some of them could still maneuver pretty\nwell. The rest of them they loaded in this barracks and burned to death.",
        "A: Yes. It's approximately the center of what would have been the barracks. The outline of the\nbarracks 1s still there, of course.",
        "A: The background shows another barracks similar to the one that was burned up. They didn't\nchoose to burn all the barracks. They just burned the one in which they had all these people\nen masse.",
        "A: These pictures were taken within 48 hours after the event, maybe less than that, and by a\nSignal Corps photographer. Contrary to army regulations, he gave me a copy of them which\nI have kept every since because, as I mentioned earlier, I couldn't believe what I was looking\nat. I thought, well, here it 1s.",
        "A: Not especially. It just shows that when people are in a desperate situation, they'll either fight\nor flee, and some of them were deciding to try to do something. They got together and they\nwere just burned up en masse. Others decided to flee and were able to get out of the building,\na few without being burned, who were then machine gunned down, and others who were\nobviously on fire when they got out of the building. And we'll see in just a moment, if you'll\ntake a look at the next picture.",
        "A: Yes. This shows about four, five, or six badly burned corpses which were outside the\nperimeter of the building and who -- obviously their clothing was on fire and they were\nburned to death outside the building trying to get out, and desperate to get to the fence and\ntrying to get out.",
        "A: Well, those bodies would be perhaps 20 to 30 feet, not very far. If you're burning from head\nto foot, you're not going to move too far. It's a very grisly thing to look at and very, very hard\nto comprehend what people will do to other people.",
        "A: No, they had not been shot, no. They hadn't been shot. There wasn't any point in shooting\nthem. I imagine that by the time they hit the ground, they were either dead or close to it.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. All these pictures were taken by the same photographer at the same time. I might\nhave mentioned the nonfraternization policy that the Army had, with good reason it turned\nout. We were not supposed to have any relations with German civilians except very\nperfunctory ones, such as where 1s the town hall and where 1s the railway station and that\nkind of thing but since -- at the time this policy was prepared, they weren't aware of how bad\nthe situation was, but they didn't want the GIs cozying up to the Germans at that point. And a\nnumber of our troops who were of German descent were pretty embarrassed about the whole\ndeal. It didn't make them proud to have been of German descent. And then you think about\nthe -- as this book says, the great accomplishments of the Germans tn the arts and music and\nscience and even theology, Martin Luther. And you come down to something like that and\nyou wonder how it can happen.",
        "A: Provisional. Yeah. By that time we had no further use for anti-aircraft battalions, so they set\nup a provisional organization called security guards, and the letters on the helmet indicate\nthat. These were -- they had nearly enough military police or regular organization to go\naround to handle everything we had run across, so they conferred these A.A. battalions\nprimarily to security police and had their helmets painted accordingly.",
        "A: Yes. This shows more of the victims who, in their desperation to flee to safety, even though\non fire, got as far as the concertina wire that is formed around the enclosure but then\ncollapsed. You can see that their bodies continued to burn at that point. There were others\nwho actually got into the wire and twisted up in the wire, and then were a few others who\nmanaged to get there without being on fire. We have a couple of pictures showing that there\nwere some who got out with their clothes but they, again, were machine-gunned by the\nTotenkopf unit of the S.S.",
        "A: This picture shows the perimeter of the area and the type of wire enclosure they had and also\nthe floodlights so that they could illuminate it by night, and what you see up in the distance\nis a guard station. And the area was divided into a couple sections and you can see that this\nwas a path through two of the sections. The barracks aren't visible here because -- I think one\nof them is possibly visible on the right but that's off to one side. But it shows you the type of\nenclosure that they kept these people in, not nearly as elaborate as they would have around\nsome of the bigger places like Dachau or Auschwitz or Buchenwald, but then on a smaller\nscale. And they weren't organized for the same purpose, but the results were the same.",
        "A: We went into Plzen and then I think I mentioned 18 kilometers east of Plzen, we were\nstopped and we were there until the 18th of June, 1945 when they pulled us out. They said\nyou're the people with amphibious attack experience, so we're going to take you out here and\nsend you back to the States. And after you have a month of R & R, so called, we will get you\naboard a ship and send you to the Pacific, because we're going to be needing your assistance\nin the invasion of the main island of Japan, Honshu. And this was scheduled for October of\n1945. Still you'll have enough time to see your friends when you get back to the States and\nthen we'll ship you out to the west coast, and from there we will ship you to the Philippines.\nAnd from the Philippines then, you will be used probably in a secondary landing after the\nprinciple one. So we thought, well, we're not looking forward to assaulting Japan, but we are\nlooking forward to getting back to the States. So we left LeHavre on the fifth of July, 1945\non board a very fast liner that had been the USS America. The army called it the West Point\nduring World War II and crossed the ocean in about six days. We got back to Manhattan and\nwe were among the early troops back so they had a big celebration for us. They had some\nvessels out in New York Harbor. They had fire boats shooting off the water, and they had\npeople with jazz bands playing and whatever, whistles blowing. We thought that was nice,\nbut it was even nicer to see the Statue of Liberty and be back home. And from there we were,\nas I say, given 30 days off. And at the end of the 30 days, the bomb went off in Japan and\nthat precluded our use in the invasion of Japan, which suited us just fine, because if, 1n fact,\nTruman had not made that decision, it would have been anybody's guess, probably half a\nmillion casualties, both American and Japanese, and there had been enough death and dying\nalready without that. So they let the genie out of the bottle as far as nuclear weapons are\nconcered, but since they haven't been used since, it probably was a good idea in the first\nplace. It saved a lot of lives at that time.",
        "A: Well, in October of 1945 they said to me, \"Now, Roberts, would you like to stay on active\nduty?\" And I thought, well, the Army's going to be dullsville. Europe 1s flat on its back, so is\nJapan. America is preeminent total world power. Who's going to start a war? I don't want to\ndo close-order drill. So thanks a lot, but I'll go back home. But I did say I would like to have\na commission as a major in the reserve. So that was forthcoming. And I did go back home\nand I got into the advertising and public relations field. At the same time in the late 40s, they\nstarted to organize the reserve and I became increasingly active in that. And as a matter of\nfact, when Korea broke out, I was on active duty; but for reasons that the army later\nregretted, they didn't make use of organized reserve components very much then. They did to\nsome extent, but if they had used more, it might have turned out a little differently. Anyway,\nfor the next 20 years virtually I was increasingly active 1n the reserve. I went to the Army\nWar College at Carlisle. I went to the Command General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth,\nand by 1967 the Army then put me in charge of all the Army reserves in eastern Ohio, West\nVirgina, and western Pennsylvania. Then in 1970 they asked me to come back on full duty in\nthe Pentagon, initially as a Deputy Chief of the Army Reserve on the army general staff, and\nthen as Chief of the Army Reserve from 1971 to 1975. So I had an unusual career in that I\nhad four years early on of full duty, and five years virtually of full duty at the end, and\nreserve duty in between with many periods of active service and schooling. I was promoted\nto major general as I assumed Chief of the Army Reserve at the beginning of May, rather, in\nMay of 1971, and so I'm now a major general of the United States Army, retired. I'm wearing\nan insignia today of the Distinguished Service Medal, which we used to call the general's\ngood conduct medal.",
        "A: Not specifically in this type of area. I did do an audio oral history for the Army War College\nat Carlisle, which took me through, of course, my experiences in World War II and my early\nexperience and subsequent, but there was no concentration on this type of atrocity thing,\nalthough it was mentioned but not as much as we have done today. There have been some\nreferences to that history. A chap published a book recently in which he attributed some of\nhis comments to my oral history. So since I left the active army for nine years, I became\nexecutive director of the Reserve Officer's Association, which is a major military lobby on\nCapitol Hill. Since then, I have been working with General Daniel Graham and the Strategic\nDefense Initiative program, which seems to be going along in good shape now, despite many\nof our critics who wish we would go away, but we haven't.",
        "A: Yeah. I think that it's fair to say that the American public represents a force for good in the\nworld. We have plenty of blemishes in this country and things we have done that we\nshouldn't have done, maybe things that we could do but haven't done, but by and large, the\nUnited States stands as a good moral force for good in this world. We're always the first to\nsend relief anywhere in the world, whether it's former foes or friends. The U.S. built up\nEurope after the war with the Marshall Plan. The U.S. handled the Japanese in a very\npositive way. And when things have gotten out of shape, why, dear old Uncle Sam was\nasked to come forth. And we've done that and I have been proud to be a part of that total\noperation.",
