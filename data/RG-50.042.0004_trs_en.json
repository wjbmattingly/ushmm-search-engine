        "Let's start with your telling me how everyday life changed as of 1938 in Germany.",
        "As of 1938, well life had changed before 1938, but we didn't really acknowledge it--we didn't want\nto know, we looked the other way. We always said that it will pass, but it didn't, and life really,\nreally changed. We were no longer allowed, uh, to go to parks to go to movies, have businesses,\nand to uh, go to school, uh, no kind of education, um, we uh, uh could not buy uh, uh food or, or\nanything in stores, we had to wait till the last one was served before if ever we did get it that we\ncould ask for something. And, uh, the big change really came uh, uh what you call Kristallnacht,\nthe 8th to the 9th of November, 1938. That was when the storm troopers uh stormed your house,\ndestroyed your furniture, uh threw everything out the window, crushed your dishes, whatever you\nhad, beat everybody up, arrested everybody uh, that they lay their hands on. Take them to\nBuchenwald--concentration camp, and uh, drive people through the streets, beat them, rape them,\nburn their synagogues uh, uh down, and uh it was truly horrible at 4 0 clock in the morning. It was\na horrible uh situation. Uh, uh Jewish people were running uh, uh from one house to another, didn't\nknow where to go what to do, whom to ask for help, there was no help, there was no place to go,\nand there was no place to run. My brother, Paul, that time, he was taken to Buchenwald. Uh, my\nbrother, Bernie, the oldest one, he was hiding in a neighbor\u2019s house, uh, uh, my 3 little sisters were\nhiding under the beds, and I was hiding under the kitchen table, uh, and uh, uh, uh, we were so\nscared half to death. We didn't know what was happening. We didn't understand it. As it passed,\nmy uh, I saw my, my mother and uh, uh my father, they would go, they would be scared every day.\nThey would be afraid to go outside, wouldn't let us go outside to play or whatever. And, my father\nno don't go work at that time--he was taken to Sachsenhausen, was picked up, taken to\nSachsenhausen. And uh, my other cousin was taken to Buchenwald. It was just my 3 sisters and\nmyself. Somehow they didn't take me, but uh, that was the -----, because uh, 1n about February, of\n1939, my mother told me to go out and buy a loaf of bread and come right back. I went out, I\nbought a loaf of bread, and a kapo was out, uh, \"You a Jew? Jew boy! Get in the car!\" I didn't\nknow any better, I was 16 years old, I went into the car, and they threw me 1n jail, in my hometown\nof Leipzig. Uh, about in April, must have been about 6 to 8 weeks I was in prison, no eh, uh, uh\nexplanation was given, none was asked. This was the way it was. Suddenly I heard them call my\nname, and I, I remember the cell, cell #10, and I was taken downstairs, and I was told to sign a\npaper, that I will leave Germany within 24 hours. I was told to sign, I signed. I went home. And",
        "that is when I really understood the whole situation. It really hit me then. I went home and my\nmother stood at the door of our house, and she said to me, \"Here is 10 marks and here is a change\nof clothes. Go to the railroad station, and take a train, and go to Italy, Milan.\" And she had my\nlittle sister, the little, the littlest one, in her arm. I said, \"Where are the other two?\" She says, \"I\nsent them away with some people, to Poland. Maybe they'll be safe there for a while. And as soon\nas you leave, I will take Tony with me, and we will also go.\" I said, \"What am I going to do in\nItaly?\" She says, \"Go. Here's 10 marks and go. You\u2019ll find something to do there, just get out of\nGermany. You have to leave!\" Well, we said goodbye, and that was the end of that. I went to the\nrailroad station, and I took a train to Milan, and that's where I went. She said to me, the last words,\nI remember her last words, my mother's last words, she said to me, \"Look forward, don't ever look\nback...Run boy run, don't ever look back and may God be with you.\" And that was the time when I\nreally understood the significance of the situation. I never seen my sisters my brothers my mother,\nmy father, never see anybody anymore. You mean, I'm all alone now? Going someplace, I don't\nknow where? Being somewhere I don't want to be? Oh it was, got into Italy, to Milan, and I found\nI wasn't alone. They got hundreds and hundreds--you see, Italy was the only country where you\ncould go to because Mussolini was Hitler's friend, that opened borders. I might add that there were\nno open borders anyplace else. Which gave me to understand that nobody wanted me. That I\ncouldn't go anyplace else. That I was, I had the feeling of being trapped. But at least I was out of\nGermany. That was...a step in the right direction. I did what the others did, I slept on park\nbenches, I slept in doorways, I slept underneath bridges, and we stole the food that we needed, we\ndidn't know where we're going, or, or what we're going to do, or where, or where the next piece of\nbread was going to come from. So the Jews in Milan saw the plight of all these--these are people\nthat are mothers with children--little babies, little children. And fathers and sick people, and old\npeople. They had to give these people something to eat, they opened up soup kitchens, so one, one\ntime a day we had a meal, so they saw to it that we had a meal. So, uh, the Nazis of course found\nout about that, that the Jews were treated humanely, in Milan and some other cities, and they said,\nuh, this cannot be, that cannot, we cannot allow this to happen. So then the Italian authorities came\nout and said, uh, \"You claim you are tourists.\" That was the only way we could get in, was to say\nwe are tourists. \"You can't be a tourist. If you're a tourist, you gotta have money. And if you have\nmoney, you have no food, then you're not tourist, and we have to send you back...where you came\nfrom. And we have to close the soup kitchens up. And that was that, they closed up the soup\nkitchens, and we were right back where we started from. Suddenly they worked it out, after all,\nabout 2 or 3 weeks, they worked it out that the French embassy is giving out visas. They're good\nfor one day. All the men have to join the French army because war was imminent. You join the\nFrench army, and all the woman and girls have to join the French Red Cross. Uh, we figured that's\nthe way out. To get out of Italy now. So we did. We all piled into the French Embassy, we all go",
        "that one, they called it a one day fly, was called a one day fly because everybody, had just asked to\nthis embassy that we are flying, we are flying there, and we all got the stamp, all got the piece of\npaper. And now was the uh, uh, thing to get into France. Here we are, we are in Milan, we have to\ntake a train to get into France. There was only one last train going because since war was\nimminent, there was only one last train going to Saint Vemo. Saint Vemo -------------------, this is\nthe French Border, the next one is Montor Nice. It's right on the French/Italian------. So we had to\nget on that train. There were hundreds of us. It was pathetic. It was a pathetic view. Woman,\nchildren, people were fainting, people were, were getting sick. They were lying all over, uh, people\ngot had strokes, it was just terrible. The excitement and the and the running and squeezing into\nthese trains, these trains, and, and the pushing and the shoving and, and the fighting to get a space\non that train. It was the last one out. I managed to get on.\nWe have to stop. We have to reload.\nYeah.\nbeep.\nLet's back up to getting a one-day visa and leaving on the train.\nAll right. Yeah? Uh, you have to understand that here is a train. We are talking about a train, that\nis maybe made for 200 people, maybe. Here must have been 8, 900 people. Now I don't have to\ntell you what that train looked like. They're hanging out windows, on top of the roof, on the sides,\non the exits, the entrances, the doorways, the doorknobs, they were, they were hanging by their\nfingernails. And here we're talking about little children. The father and the mother maybe took the\nchildren, or three. It wa, it was a sad sight, but yet, we got on it. The train started moving. the\ntrain conductor couldn't go very fast. He was going slow because he was afraid that the condition\nof the train, and the people, they were falling off, they can get killed. Was dangerous. When we\ngot to Saint Vemo, train, we got there too late. We went up to the French border. They had closed,\nalready closed the border. Now the French, you have to understand this, the French wouldn't let us\nin, the Italians wouldn't let us back. On one side we had the mountains, which most of the people\nnever saw a mountain in their life, like me. And on the other side, to the front, you had the ocean,\nwith those big breakers, and in order to get into France, only two ways to do it in this kind of\nsituation. You had to either go climb the mountain, which had was snow covered mountain, which\nwe could never make, or you had to go, to go around the bend of the mountain into the beaches of\nFrance. We were now on the beach of St. Vemo, ------, but we had to go to the beach of France.",
        "There was a big mountain there. We had to go around that mountain, swim or boat whatever, and\ngo around to the beaches of France. Now, this is now what they call the St. Vemo incident. In this\nsituation I'm now to talk about, became later known as the uh, uh, uh, as the St. Vemo incident.\nNow, here's the incident. There were, there were, St. Vemo at that time was a small fishing\nvillage. Old fishermen with old boats, rotten old boats, people, impoverished people, never saw a\ndollar in their life. These people saw a chance now, to make money. They knew that we couldn't\nget back into Italy, they had their guns pointed at us. The French had their guns pointed at us the\nother way, the mountains we couldn't make, the ocean was the only answer. And we couldn't stay\nbecause we would starve to death. We, we laid on a piece of land called the no man's land. It\ndidn't belong to Italy, didn't belong to France, it was just a little tiny stretch of land that belonged to\nno one. Little tiny stretch of beach. We laid there for 4 days. In those four days, the fishermen\nsaw the plight of the people. And they said, \"I tell you what, If you give us all you have, we take\nyou around with our boats. Around the bend onto the beaches of France. And from there you have\nto make your own way. Now a lot of people didn't have much of a choice. We couldn't stay, we\ncouldn't go the other way, What choice did we have? There were children with us. I'm hungry!\nI'm thirsty! I need this, I need that! People needed medication. So, they said, \"Let's take a chance.\nAt least we have friends. At least, maybe they will give us some help. Give us something to eat.\"\nYou have to understand also there were two gunboats there--one Italian gunboat on one side, and a\nFrench gun boat on the other side--looking at each other. And there were people there, it's not like\nit was isolated. The fishermen said give us all you have, your money your jewelry whatever, and\nwe'll take you on to the beaches of France. And it was fine, the people gave whatever little they\nhave, an earring, a ring, a wedding band, whatever little they had. They put them on the boat, there\nwere about 8, 10 boats, they go out, they overloaded the boats, they had to go out about a half a\nmile or so to get around that bend. The boats cracked in two. People fell into the ocean, the\nbreakers are very high there, and all you could hear was screams, \"Help me! I'm drowning! Help\nme! Help my wife! Help my Children! Save my children! Save us!\" And there were, it was a\nbad situation, they lifted their hands, I, I saw from shore, they were lifting their hands up to the\ngunboats, like this, to the gunboats, \"Please save us! Save my children!\" Who do you save when\nyou wife drowns and your son drowns and your daughter drowns? Who do you save? They say,\n\"Papa help me.\" And you can't swim. Who do you help?...The, uh, navy people on those ships,\nthey looked down, they saw everything, there were dozens and dozens of people trying to paddle\ntheir way through the waves, going down never coming up, children.\nLet's stop and wait ......\n30 seconds of room tone with the heat on.",
        "End room tone.\nI want to redo that story.\nWhere do you want me to start from?\nI want you to start from being on no man's land...\nand the fish, and hiring the fishermen to take you around the bend.\nWell, there, there were people, I had nothing to give to these fishermen, so I was out. But, there\nwere people that had their wedding band, earrings, uh little things, a few lire, a few marks, a few\nwhatever they had, they gave it to them. They took them out their rotten boats there, overloaded,\nthey were greedy, now, not just taking, they were greedy! They want too many people on that\nboat! As much as they could get on it. And, went out to the ocean, boats cracked, I saw it from\nshore, and the people fell into the water into the ocean. Was a heartbreaking sight...because you\nhad families that were drowning, you had brothers and sisters, you had parents, you had wives and\nhusbands, young and old, and they were all screaming for someone to save them. The breakers\nwere hard, the waves were very high, the ocean was very hard, very tough. And, uh, these two\ngunboats there, the Italian and the French, their navy personnel were looking out, they were\nlooking down, and I saw they had grins, they were grinning. And they were pointing fingers at the\ndrowning people. I saw that. The screams from these people, from the children and from the\nhusbands and the wives, the people there, to this day, I have those screams in my ears, \"Papa save\nme!\" The wife would yell, \"Save our daughter, save our son!\" And then they would disappear\nbeneath the waves--wouldn't come up anymore. It was all over. The fishermen, of course, they\nknow how to swim uh these uh, uh waves, and they been swimming since they're maybe 2 or 3\nyears old--they made it back to shore. Walked away. The next day, the bodies came washing\nashore. Children, small, bigger ones, man, woman, nobody cared. So we pulled them out of the\nwater, we put them down on the------. We didn't know what to do with them. And that is when I\nreally realized, I know there's going to be a problem here. There's gonna be, we're going to have\nproblems. We're going to have big problems. Was a little boy that hung on to me, must have been\nabout 12 yrs old, 11 or 12, Heinz was his name, I remember his name. He lost his family running\nfor Europe, somehow he got lost. He hung on to me. So I took him aside, I said, \"Look, we're here\n4 days, going 5 days, there's no food, there's no water. We're going to die here. Unless we're going\nto do something very drastic, we're going to die. There's nobody coming to help.\" The only",
        "people that came to help us, monks, and few nuns, that would bring some, little bit, something for\nthe children, but not for the adults, you know, they couldn't do a great deal, because there were too\nmany people. How much could 3 or 4 nuns do? Or 3 or 4 monks or brothers, whatever you call\nthem. So I took him aside, I said, \"I'll tell you what. If you want to chance it, we can't go back to\nItaly, we look at guns, we can't go into France, we look at guns, we can't go over mountains, we,\nwe'll die, we'll freeze to death up there, we'll never make it. We can't swim because we'll drown,\nand nobody is helping us. Italy knew about it. France, France, French authorities knew about it,\nthat we were there, that we are coming, and the Italian authorities know that we just left the train.\nSo everybody knew about it. But, we're going to die right here. Nobody's going to lend us a hand.\nSo, I tell you what we're going to do. We're going right up to that barbed wire there on the French\nborder, they had some barbed wire there, and walk right up to it, and crawl through it. We'll do the\nimpossible thing, we'll do the stupid thing, that nobody expects us to do, walk right into it. Just\nwalk. He says, \"Well, you know better. I was the leader now. All of 17, 16, I was the leader.\nNightfall came, so, I said, \"Tell you what, we go in the early, early morning hour. Sure enough,\ndawn, we went to the barbed wire, I said, \"Let's crawl through it.\"\nOkay, we have to reload.\nBeep.\nBeep.\n4 second sticks\n-------------establish that you were with Heinz and...\nYeah, uh, I decided to do the thing that people would not think of doing--was go back to the barbed\nwire. I told Heinz that, I said, \"Do you realize we're going to get shot, we can get killed, uh, we'll\nnever make it, but that's the only chance we have. Well, maybe in 100, maybe the...God will look\nover here, maybe there is no God, maybe we'll make it, maybe do it. He says, \"Fine.\" So we did it.\nCrawling half way through the barbed wire, I heard a noise, I looked up and I saw, I looked into\nthe barrel of shot of a gun, and this border guard is looking down at me. Well, Heinz being a\nyoung boy started to cry. And I looked at him, I said, \"This is the end of the line. At least we\ntried.\" I said, \"Look,\" and he spoke, he spoke in broken German--he must have been from Alsace\nLorraine--or something, he must have spoke some German, he says, \"So, what you think you're\ndoing there?\" I said, \"I'm trying to get into your country.\" Uh, I tell you what, \"If you have to",
        "shoot, let him go, he's only 12 years old. He's only a kid.\" So he says, \"Get through.\" And there\nwas a voice from another guard, and he says, \"C'est ne rien---.\". That means, \"There is nothing\nhere, no, no, no nothing, no noise.\" I remember those words, although I could not speak French,\nbut I remember those words because they saved my life. And some things just stick into your head.\nHe said, \"Is your train over there? There was one train standing in Monton, on the, on the border.\"\nHe said, \"Yeah, get in it. It's going to take you into France, into Nice.\" So we run for it. Totally\nempty train. This must have been the train they had ready for us when we arrived to take us into\nFrance, but I didn't realize it at that time. When they did, suddenly the train started moving, we\nended up in Nice. Now you have to understand something, here we have no papers, no money, we\nhave no knowledge of French, we have no place to go, we were hungry, we were dirty, we were\nbloody, cold and tired. So we ran into a doorway, we said, you know, \"Let's go to sleep.\" And we\nslept, and we were arrested, of course, the concierge came out and uh, saw us sleeping in the door,\nwe arrested and uh, and I never knew anything about the French or about France, but I now felt a\nbrunt of, of the French cruelty and, and, and barbaric behavior. Believe me, the cruelty of the\nFrench police, and the garde-----------, and authorities, was next to nobody. I mean, they were\nbrutal. The brutality and cruelty of these people. And, and, and the, and the meanness of these\npeople was next to nobody. We thought we had escaped the cruelty of the Nazis. Ha, ha, ha, we\ngot into the cruelty of the French. They grabbed us, they put chains on us, and they throw us in\nprison. No food, no water, no nothing. Well, we later found out that everybody who crosses the\nborder illegally and has no papers has to spend one month in Prison before they even talk to you.\nNow spending, in, 1n the French jails, you have to understand you have company. You know you\nhave rats the size of cats. You have bugs and roaches on the walls. Ants. The filth is un, is\nindescribable, that 1s in the French prisons. Well, we, we found that out very soon. They took him\nout, and I never, I never saw Heinz again. Now I was alone. Now, once a day, they would throw a\npiece of hard bread in there which was full of ants--I felt 1t crawling when I touched the bread. Of\ncourse, the rats came, so we, I had to break off a piece of the break off a piece of the bread, throw it\nin the corner of the cell so the rats would fight over it and let me eat the other piece. Before I ate, I\nhad to knock it out, I had to knock the ants out, the hard, the bread was hard as nails. But if you\nhave nothing else, you chew on it. After a month, they took me out, I was never allowed to leave\nthe cell. No walking, no exercise, no nothing. They took me out and no explanation was given.\nThey put chains on my legs, and chains on my hand, on my arms, and they had a car, an open car\nwaiting for me with 8 guard mobile. The guard mobile, the gendarmes, are the worst kind of\npolice, the, the most brutal, the most uh, uh, the meanest people that they had, they put into the\nguard mobile. They threw me in there, chains on my arms and legs, and took me to a camp call\nAntibe. That was what they called an internment camp, but don't believe it, that was a\nconcentration camp. There were hundreds of people there. They took the chains off, and they took",
        "me out, and they threw me into the camp, I fell right flat on my face into the camp, I'll never forget\nit. And that was that, I was in that camp. Nothing to do there. Just stay there. Barbed wire. Not\nmuch food, not much water. It ------- 1t was used to be an old stadium, a football stadium, so we\nslept on the cement. There were all kinds of people there. One didn't know the other. All kind of\npeople that they picked up here and there. After 2 months, we were put on trucks, we were taken to\nLe Mille ---- Provence. Pres to Marseilles, next to Marseilles, to a brick factory. They put us to the\ncatacombs, and lock the door, the iron door. The catacombs used to be little hallways, little tun,\ntunnels, how they say, tunnels, where they used to dry the bricks with heat. There was straw on the\nfloor, no light, and no sound and no nothing like you're buried alive. We had a few candles\nflickered in the dark and that was it. After some months, they took us out, and they made a\ntransport into a place called Manosk. That used to be an old movie house. They put barbed wire\naround it. Put us there. I wasn't supposed to be there, but I met a boy, a guy named Willie, and uh,\nhe came from my hometown, and so we got friendly in Antibe, and we stuck together. He used to\nkeep an eye out for me because uh he was 10 years older. And we had uh, uh a lot of\nhomosexuality in the camp, and I was all of 17 and a half, and I fell prey to a, they tried a lot of\nthings and he sort of, uh chased them, and I didn't understand what it was all about, I never knew\nabout homosexuality, I never heard this word, I never knew what it was. But he was the smart one,\nand he never would really answer my questions, just said, \"Just stay away from this one, stay away\nfrom that one,\" that's what I did, and I went with really this transport. That night, he came to\nManosk, they called out the list of prisoners, and I wasn't on the list. They found out that I wasn't\nsupposed to have been on the transport, so he says, \"You got to get back--you can't--. I said, \"I\nwant to stay with my friend,\" they say, \"You can't. We have to take you back on the truck.\" So\nthey put me through that truck, I remember it was cold. It was so cold. And uh, I went back, I said\ngoodbye to Willie. And I went back on the truck. And there was about a 3-4 hour drive to go back\nto where we came from. And it was an open truck. The back was open, but there was no guard in\nthe back, they just throw us in the back because the guy that was supposed to guard us, he was too\ncold, he stuck with the driver up front. We drove through the night, and the truck wasn't going very\nfast, and, when they're on a bend, they slowed down quite a bit. And I saw a, a, like a ravine down,\ngoing down like. So I said, there ever is a time to get the hell out of here, this is it. I had no idea\nwhere I was, I had no idea where I was going, I had no idea in the dark of the night where that truck\nwas. I got out. And I jumped. Was pitch dark, the------------------. And I fell down that, that\nravine, and I laid there still. I was afraid, I was scared. My heart was pounding and I was so\nscared. Nothing. Still. Quiet. And I thought I heard the backlights of the truck disappear on the\nhorizon. I said, uh, they'll never know. And I start walking. I got up, I was hurting, but I start\nwalking. And I stayed there a few days and a few nights in the woods there. I was afraid to talk to\nanyone--if a farmer would pass, I was afraid to talk to him. ---------------------that October I",
        "couldn't speak French. What am I going to tell them I'm German, they, they, they take a pitchfork\nand kill me because they hated the Bosch, they hated the, the Germans. They'd think I'm from the\n5th Column or something. So, I hid up on a group of people, I heard voices, and I sneaked up.\nWait, we've got to reload.\nOh.\nBeep.\nBeep.\nWhy don't you just back up\nI'm sorry that was take 4, ----------\nI saw the opportunity to jump off the truck. The truck had slowed down, and here was my chance\nto get away. I didn't know whether it was smart of dumb, but I did it. And I jumped. Of course I\nfell down the ravine there, and, and uh, I saw the truck disappear, there, the backlights uh over the\nhorizon, I knew I was safe now, at least from them, they wouldn't notice whether I was missing.\nNot now. By the time they will know this, I'll be gone. After a few days in the woods, and a few\nnights, I, I hid up on a group of people, on the run just like me. Young ones, old ones. Children\nfrom 12 years, 10 years on up to old men. They asked me if I was hungry. By that time, I could\nhave eaten a cow, I was so hungry. They gave me food. And we stayed in the woods for a little\nwhile longer, a few more days, and then we got a, uh, message to join a group of assistant fighters,\nmore south, in a place called Langlad. Langlad is next to Nime, that is in the South of France about\n40 miles from Nice. We made our, our way, they were walking at night, and hiding during the day,\neating whatever we could find, or we stole bread in the little villages that we passed through, in\nfront of the baker, uh bakeries, and we stole fruit, and we went into backyards and stole figs, and,\nand, and grapes in the fields--whatever we could lay our hands on it. We made it to Nime. To\nLanglad. Now you have to understand, Langlad is a small village which was uh, at that time,\nevacuated, totally deserted. So we had our camp there. After a week or two, seems that somebody\ngave us away. The guard mobile got wind of it. They surrounded the camp and asked us to give\nup. And, and, so and, we knew what it meant. To surrender, then we're going to be shot, or we're\ngoing to be handed over to the Gestapo, or they're going to throw us in their filthy jails--we knew\nwhat that was, this was not good news. This was bad news. So they got together, and they said,",
        "\"Look, we were quite a few of us, 18, 20 uh boys that were under 21. 14 year olds, 15 year olds,\n16, 20, 18--so you kids, get out, we're going to engage them with a little bit of shooting, and uh,\nyou, while when we do it, we'll cover you. You run over the field and make your way to Nice. So\nwe said, what's going to happen to you, they said, \"Look we're in our 40s, 50s, 60s, maybe we'll get\naway too, maybe not, maybe it's the end of the line for us, but you're too young to die here. We\ndid. We heard shooting from far on. They covered us, we made our way to Nice. Everyone for\nhimself. There was no time to, to help anybody else, or to do it, or to go back and carry anybody.\nWe were so hungry and, and thin and skinny and tired, that we, there was just no way that we could\nhave helped anybody. I mean, we had enough of a job to help ourselves. So we got into Nice.\nNow, you have to understand something that the French did at that ttme. The French would go and\nthey would come with a few trucks, and they corded off a part of the town, and go into that part of\ntown, nobody could get out, like, like a trap, like, like a rat in a trap. They go in now by uh maybe\ntwo, three dozen automobile, and ask everybody for papers. Now if you had no money you were a\nvagrant. You go to jail. If you had no papers, you were a spy. If you couldn't prove that you lived\nthere, in that area, you were also a spy. No matter which way you would turn, you lose. No matter\nwhich way, you lose. Naturally, we didn't know all these things that they had in store for us. We\nhad no place to go, we had no place to hide, we had no money, we couldn't speak French, and we\nhad no passport. Of course, we got caught. And, back to jail we went. Now they put me, luckily,\ninto the -------------, that was an, a barracks, called the Barracks, ------------, an army barrack. And\nthey had a jail in front, right where the street is, they had a jail where they would put the soldiers\nthat go AWOL, or the, that had been in -------------- with the rules they would put \u2018em there for a\nday or two or a week. And there were 5 cells there, and they threw me in one of the cells. And\nhere I was. I didn't know what's happened to me. After about a week, the guard came to me and he\nsays, \"You know, all your people, in the other cells too, you're all going to be handed over in 2 days\nto the Gestapo. And you know what they're going to do with you.\" Seemed that he enjoyed that.\nAnd I look around. I was lucky. You see, where they had little trap door on the cell, I noticed it. I\nlearned by now to notice things. To see things to look around, wherever I go I look around. I start\nto notice. They had a little trap door where they put that little pail in there, where you urinated, in\nand out. And that little pail, that little door, trap door was only hold together with a wire. The cell\ndoor had a bolt. this only had that little wire. I said, \"Well, in the morning I'm going to get out.\"\nSure enough, I worked all night, taking the wire back and forth, back and forth till it broke. And,\noh you put wire back and forth, eventually it will crack. In the morning I, and I counted the uh\nminutes when the guard used to come around and check. I knew I had about 8 minutes between\nchecking. I went out the moment the guard left I went out, I got out, over the trap door and out.\nOpened up all the bolts, and I looked, I saw, a half a dozen people in each one of the cells supposed\nto hold one person. They were all Jews like me, on the run, that they caught. I said to them, \"Look",
        "fellas, you have 8 minutes. The wall is over there, ------------, go for it.\"\" You know what they said\nto me? \"Where are we going to go? We have no papers, we have no money, we have no place to\nstay, we have no food, we have nothing. We have no coats, no wear no clothes. Where are we\ngoing to go? We are hunted by everyone. We're like, we are less than animals.\" I said, \"Look, I\nhaven't got time for debate here. You want to go, go.\" Of course, I was the youngest of the bunch\nthere. They were all older people. And I went over the wall. They had a little piece of glass on the\nwall, I remember, I cut myself. There was a lamppost. I looked down, I saw the guard with a gun\ngoing back and forth. When he turned around, went the other way, I jumped on to the lamppost,\ndown I went, and I walked immediately, I didn't stand there. Guy comes back, he looked me, he\nseems says, \"Oh, just 2 minutes ago there was nobody here, now I see somebody walking,\" but he\ndidn't say anything. I smiled. Hi. And I walked, and I went into Nice. There 2 guys stopped me.\nI was going rather fast, I was running. They said, \"Hey, if you're on the run, there's a place that's\ncool down there, there are 3 basements. You can get a night's sleep and a piece of bread. Go down\nthere. I said here is a good idea. I went down there. I stayed 2 nights. They gave me something to\neat. They gave me a place to sl--You see, just to get a place to sleep, to lay your head down, a\npiece of bread to eat was something that was so big to us because we were always so hungry, so\ncold, so tired. Just to be able to sleep without having to worry that someone puts a gun into your\nhead or somebody puts the chains on your, on your arms and, and feet and, uh, uh, somebody beats\nyou up with a, with a stick. To us, that was heaven. After 2 days, I left. Well. We were running\nhere, we were running there, hiding here hiding there. There was no place to go. There was no\nplace to go. By now, I was suppose, I was considered dangerous subject, because of the prison\nbreak, they had my dossier, and there I was already you know, hunted. Now I was really hunted.\nNow, between the Gestapo and between the Guard mobile, and between really having had no\nchance. I mean, I didn't even have a fighting chance. I knew it. I had no fighting chance. That\nwas it. Today I slept on this doorway. Tomorrow I slept underneath the bridge, and the next day I,\nI hid in a, in a backyard someplace like a rat. I got caught, and by the way, this time, it was late.\nThey put chains on my legs, and chains on my arms, and I was transported into a concentration\ncamp called ----------------------, they were right next to the ocean. There I say about 30,000, 40,000\nmen, woman and children behind barbed wire. When the let me in in chains, and a few others.\nLet's reload.\nYeah.\nbeep.",
        "We left off at the camp of 30,000.\nI see, Camp Di Agilis (ph).\nYeah.\nYeah.\nSo why don't you describe to me that camp.\nWell, it was a rather large camp, and uh, it's called, was called an internment camp, but it was a\nconcentration camp, that's just a fancy name for a concentration camp. Really, especially by the\nFrench. They put into that camp anyone they could scoop up that was hiding, that was running,\nthat had no place to go, that was called a vagrant, that was uh, uh had no papers, no money\nwhatever, and they scooped them up and that's where they throw, that was one of the camps. Camp\ndi Vernay (ph) was another camp. Uh, that was not far from their county called Condivernay, it\nwas, 1s a terrible, that that was a nasty place, Condivernay. Uh, Agilis wasn't much better, but was\na little, little better. In Camp di Vernay they had no children. Here they put the people with\nchildren. It was...they didn't really know what to do with these people. It was, there were so many\nthat were running away uh, uh, uh from Germany and from other places that they just had no place\nto put them anymore. They were thousands. So they put us in there, and they, inside the camp,\nthey had one tent that they put barbed wire around, that's where they put the most dangerous\npeople. In other words, people that they would shoot the next day. They, into that little tent. And\nthat's where they put all the kids. They put us all, kids, no, none older than 20, 21, no they were 14\nyear olds, 12 year olds, 13, children. And as we were marched in chains into that little tent,\neverybody was clapping their hands, all the people in the camp. We stayed in there, and they told\nus that in a few days they will dispose of us. We didn't know how. And after about 3, 4 days, and\nit was dark in there, they gave us a few candles that flickered in the dark there, and we were singing\nuh little Jewish songs in the dark. He'd give us, to give us courage. Even though we were singing\nto give us something you know, so we wouldn't cry. And the minute the kids cried, you know, you\nhave to understand that, and next morning they took us out, and they said, \"Now you go, all going\nto be shot.\" We didn't really comprehend being shot, what it mean, we didn't understand really,\nyou know, the the significance of uh being shot, you know. They had a few people lined up with\ntheir rifles, and the said \"Les guns, aim, fire!\" But, uh, they were firing over our heads, they\nweren't going to shoot us.\" And the little kids were crying, they were hysterical, they were holding\non to each other, you know. Just get back into the tent. A few hours later, we are taken out, and",
        "taken down to the, it was a boat. And, we had to go into the boat. So the Guard mobile had\nanother job to do. They had whips. And chains. And they stood a line on one side, a line on the\nother side, going on to the, well we had to go between the lines to go onto the boat, and we all\nchained together, you know, we were all chained one to another. And we had to drag ourselves, on\nthe legs and on the arms, on the wrists, we had to go on that boat, and they were beating us as we\nwalked through the line, they were beating us with chains and whips. Some fell down. We had to\ndrag them with us because we are chained together. And finally the captain came out of the, the\nship, 1t was a freighter. And he said, \"This has to stop. They are under my jurisdiction now, and\nyou better stop this beating. You don't, nobody gets beaten when under my command.\" And he\nwas, he was a good man. We got onto the boat, and we realized the hopelessness and the\ndesperation of the situation. We are now on a boat. We don't know where we're going, we're all\nchained together, we don't know what's going to happen to us. We run away from the, the Germans\nwanted to gas us in the gas chambers, and hang us. The French wanted to beat us to death. So we\ndon't know what's going to be with us now. Who are we going to see now that wants to\nexterminate us? So people said they're going to put us out into the ocean and use us as target\npractice. The Germans with their planes, they're going to blow up the ship as target practice. They\nhave done it. So we said, \"Well, this is the end of the line now. There's no place we're going to\ngo.\" But somehow I felt that this captain, the way he saved us from the beating would not do this\nto us, would not allow that to be done to people. So, I had a little flicker of hope there. The ship\ntook off, we were all in the belly of the boat. The only opening was on top on deck, there was a big\nmachine gun mounted, looked down, so there was no way you could ever get out of there. And, we\npassed the coast of Spain. We could look through the openings on the belly of the boat, there was\nsome little openings there that we could look through, and one guy said, that's the coast of Spain.\nAnd, as long as we were moving, we wouldn't be target practice because you don't take a moving\nship as target so we reasoned looking for a way to assure ourselves that this is not going to happen\nto us. And, uh, guy said, he's go, we are going to go to Africa, North Africa. That's where we\nwent, to Algiers. We docked in Algiers, and they took us out and put us into the prison in Algiers.\nLater we found out that they had to wait for a big transport to come to get us, so they can make one\nbig freight train and take us out to the camp, to wherever we were going to go. Sure enough, it\ntook about, quite a long time, about 2 months, and they put us in solitary confinement. Now, you\nhave to understand, a prison in Algiers in Solitary confinement, uh, is a little cell, no light, no\nblanket, uh, nothing, just plain cement, and that is solitary confinement. The only way we kept our\nsanity in the cell, and we didn't know how long we were going to be there. The only way we kept\nour sanity, we knocked on the wall, and the other guy knocked back. Just to hear the knocking and\nthe sound of somebody else to give us, kept me, that's how we kept our sanity. Once a day they put\nsome water and the food, whatever the garbage that they put in there, and we lose complete track of",
        "time. We didn't know what day of the week, what month, what year, what time it was, winter,\nsummer, we lost total track of time, we just stayed in the dark trying to not to go crazy in that cell.\nWas a, was a very long time that we were in there. They took us out, then finally we got the rumor,\nthere's always rumors, when you have people, always rumors going around, one, one, one always\nknows more than the other guy. And he says, \"We are going to a camp in the middle of the desert.\"\nNobody can escape from there. There is no escape. Now you have to understand something, that\nin North Africa, they had about a hundred different concentration camps, they had Colubushe,\nBreeda, City Belepest, they had uh, uh Joffa, had uh, Whatchamaka, Whatchamake, something like\nthat. And these were all slave labor camps, these were bad, these were bad places. And that's\nwhere your ---------- go to die. They put us into a cattle, to a train, a freight train, where they\ntransport camels. About 50-60 people in one, in one of these wagons there. We couldn't sit down,\nwe had to stand up, people died standing up! Uh, no facilities to go to a bathroom or anything like\nthis. And we travelled for about 3-4 days, and you had to also know that the, the heat that goes\nover 100 degrees, 110, 120, during the day, at night it's very, very cold. Because we were to at the\nAtlas Mountain, the foot of the Atlas Mountain in the, in the Sahara Desert. Once a day they would\nopen the door, throw a bread in, and throw a couple of bottles of water in, and close the doors\nagain. People died standing up. You couldn't fall. We finally got there, and the railroad station is\nabout 2-3 miles from the camp, and we had to walk through the sand through the desert to, toward\nthe camp. And these Bahis, now we have someone new to deal with. We had to deal with this\nBahis. But you have to understand that this Bahis is an elite Arab troop, they're on horses. They're\nvery cruel people. We were horse whipped all the way to the camp, walking 3 or 4, 2 or 3 miles to\nthe camp through the sand, through the hot sand, we were beaten all the way down there, and\npeople that fell down we had to drag them along because with the chains. Then we saw the camp.\nWe saw tents in the middle of the desert, surrounded by barbed wire, machine guns on the end, on\nthe corners. That was Jaffa. Jaffa was known as having been the worst concentration camp in all\nof North Africa. The cruelest and worst.\nLet's wait and reload.\nYeah.\nBeep.\nOkay.\nUh, the trip, as I said, took about 3 or 4 days on the freight train, and the water that they threw in",
        "was | or 2 bottles of water for about 50 60 people, was quite inadequate, especially when the heat\noutside was 110, and who knows what the heat was inside that, that uh, uh wagon there. I can't say\nthis, what people did there was. The first was so bad, the hunger, see hunger pang goes away after\na while, but thirst makes your tongue swell up, and eventually you choke to death on your own\ntongue. The thirst was so bad. People would try to drink their urine. As we went along, all kinds\nof strange things happened there, and, and, and people went crazy. Inside that wagon there, start\nscreaming and hollering and fighting about the room. We were so crammed in that you could\nhardly breathe during the day. At night it was better because was cold, was cold. During the day\nyou could hardly breathe. And I tell you it was like a, the rite of torture, believe me. That's what it\nwas, and how, people, many people died in that train, and, and, and, that not more died was a\nmiracle. It's amazing what a human being can endure...without losing their lives. When we got out\nof the train, they gave us some water. And then we walked up to the camp. Now we knew the\nsituation was now hopeless. There was no escape, there was no getting away, there was, this, this\nwas the kind of situation that was really, really bad. We never knew really what hell was but when\nwe got into that camp, and saw the camp and stayed there awhile, we really found out what hell\nwas. If this wasn't hell, it sure came close to it. Believe me. We stood on attention for the camp\ncommander. And he came, and he says, and I've never forgotten what he said to me, to us, he says,\n\"You all came here to die. You are the scum of Europe. You are the garbage of the world. My job\nis to see to it that you all die here. It's just a matter of time. If you behave yourselves, and do as\nyou're told, you may live a little longer. If not, you're going to die sooner. This is my job. And I'm\ngood at what I'm doing.\" That was his speech. \"Now get into the tents.\" Now you have to\nunderstand something--these, the camp consisted of tents, a row, a few rows of tents. The tents\ncalled Maribou. It had a post in the middle and on the sides was tied down with, with a piece of\nrope and some pieces of wood. And, there were 40 persons to a tent. 40 to 50 persons to a tent\nmade for 8. The day consisted of working ten hours a day, one day you didn't have to work, that\nwas Sunday. Six days you worked. The French tried to build a transaharan through the desert.\nThat means that they tried to build a railroad through the desert. And in order to do that, they had\nto remove the dunes, because there are dunes in the desert, and the mister comes, the mister is a\nsandstorm, and, and, comes there for about 15 or 20 minutes, what you just cleaned out, the dune is\nback again, so you have to remove the dune again to, the tracks are covered now with sand again.\nThey'd never do it, they never did do it, but that, that's what they tried to do because they are cheap\nlabor. So they said \"What the hell, we'll try to do it.\" That is what we had to do, work on the\nTransaharian on the railroads. To work on the railroads, they gave you a sack made out of desert\ngrass, that, it had 2 sacks that you put over your shoulder, you had one in the front and one in the\nback. One wasn't heavy enough, you had to have one in the front too. And we had to clear the\nsand from 3 or 4 miles down the road, and put it in there and then bring it back, and then go back",
        "again for some more sand. Sand is heavy, and the desert is sand, and when you have a heavy load\nof sand, you sink into the sand, it's hard to walk. You go to your knees, you sink into your knees.\nDuring the day, I might add, they had about, must have been 110 or more. At night it would be so\ncold that your teeth would chatter because the cold icy wind from the uh, mountain would come\ndown on you. And it was bitter, bitter cold--the Atlas mountain. Now this wasn't the only thing we\nhad to contend with. The food consisted of uh, one cup of water a day, uh one cup of coffee, that\nthey called coffee, it was black water, in the morning, and uh, half a liter of soup at lunchtime, and\na half a liter of soup at night. A liter of soup, well, used to be hot water. But if you lucky you\nfound a rotten potato, or rotten but uh, uh whatever piece of meat, there was uh rotten stuff, if\nyou're lucky, you found a rotten onion in it. The work was ten hours a day. If you could not work,\nthey would open up, if you could not get up anymore, they would open up your veins in your arms\nand bleed you to death. And get the blood out of there. Whatever little blood you had left. The\npunishment, let me talk about some of the punishment. For the slightest infraction of the rules,\nthey would bury you in the sand up to your neck. And the Arabs would urinate on your head. And\nif you moved your head, they would take a big stone and smash your head. You weren't supposed\nto move. If a scorpion or a viper (little poisonous snakes), or ants or whatever there was bugs\nwould bite you, you could not move. You didn't get any kind of rationed?? foods. That was one of\nthe punishments. The other one, the camp commander would come in every morning. He would\ntake 8 to 10, 8 to 10 inmates out, strip them naked, tie them to a post and beat them. And where\nwould they beat them mostly? On their sex organs, where it hurts the most. And they would stand\nthere and laugh. They would just pick anyone at random. That was fun for them. If you didn't look\nright to the camp commander when he passed by or you didn't work hard enough, or this bahis\ndidn't beat you hard enough while you were drag in the sand through the desert, he would take you\nat the end of the day, and he would say, \"Quinze jours---------------------.\"\" That means fifteen days\nin the, at the fort. They would tie your arm in the back and hang you on your arms naked for about\n2, 3 days you would hang on your arms, and every night they would come in, when it's the coldest,\nand hose you down with ice cold water, and beat you about, and that was fun for them, they would\nlaugh when they did it. When you got through hanging there, and when they cut you down, you\nwere not able to walk, in fact you were lucky to be alive. I went there twice. And I was lucky they\ndidn't beat me that hard anymore. But after a while you don't feel the beatings anymore.",
        "How did all of you decide to resist that?",
        "There was one day we had to decide, we, we, we knew we were going to die there because there\nwas really no hope, really, we didn't fool ourselves. All along you fooled yourself, take a beating,\nnot eating, not drinking, no sleep, worrying for your life. We fooled ourselves there is uh maybe,",
        "maybe a little light at the end of the tunnel, maybe somebody will, we'll -----------somebody that\nwill help us, maybe is a place that we can hide, maybe there is something that we, that they won't\ncatch us or find us or, or beat us or.....1n this camp we realized, we really, this 1s really the end of\nthe line, I mean, how much can you absorb, how much beatings, how much hunger, how much\nthirst, how much lice, we used to kill the lice every morning on the rags we wore, how we walked\naround naked, we had no...\nLet's stop.\nBeep.\nLet's go back and talk about the punishments and how you decided to resist, like, by, by not\nscreaming, by not giving them the satisfaction of killing you.\nYes, uh, screaming and crying, while you absorb punishment, was a no-no, by all of us. The only\nway we could fight back, the only way we could protest this, this cruel treatment, was by not giving\nin to their punishment. There can, there could beat us all they want, they could inflict any\npunishment they wanted to us, we would quietly and silently absorb it without a peep. We would\nnot even make a, a sound, a noise. It would hurt. It would bleed. You would be in, in excruciating\npain. And as more we defied them in our own way as what they would beat us. They said, \"We\nare going to make them scream in pain, and they couldn't do that. And that got them very angry.\nAnd that made them figure out more punishments, and bigger punishments, and longer\npunishments, and more beatings, and no water for the day, and no food for 2 days, and, and, and\nstanding naked being tied to a post in the sun all day, in the hot African sun, and, and putting a\nbucket of ants over your head, and burying you in the sand to your neck and urinating on your\nhead, and beating your head open, and nothing they did could make us make a sound. Oh, we\nwanted to, but that was the only way would, we could get back at them. If you going to kill us,\nthen you can beat us to death--go ahead and do it, that's the way it's got to be. We expect it. We\nhave no hope anyhow. This is a living hell anyway.\nTalk about how the younger men helped the older men. They younger men took some of the load\noff the older ones, but the older ones died very quickly. They couldn't take it. That, you see, there\nwas many ways you could die in that camp. You could die, you had dysentery, you had malaria, a\nlack of food, a lack of water, uh, bitten, bitten by scorpions, bitten by vipers, the poisonous snake,\nyou're dead in an hour. Uh, uh, died by beating, actually beaten to death. You died of, of, of\nsunstroke by, by being buried in the sand. Uh, there were many pla, uh people really run to the",
        "barbed wire to be shot by the guard. You had to stay away 10 feet from the barbed wire. If you run\ntoo close to the 10 feet, they have the right to shoot you dead, and that's what they did, the people\njust did that. They did just that. Every other night we heard the shots going.\nWas that resisting, do you think?\nYou know, under tho--under the conditions that we lived under, it was hard to co, to, to, to live, you\nknow, how, how much can you take? I mean, really, how much can you take? How much is\nmuch? How much is enough, that you say this is it, I'm giving up. But there were many that didn't\ngive up, and, although there 4000 of, approximately 4000 people in that camp. And on, only about\n300 came out at the end. And the rest perished. They did a pretty good job. And if anybody tells\nyou now today, \"There was no Holocaust, believe me, I was there, I was there, there was a\nHolocaust, don't let anybody tell you different. It was a living hell. We spent 2 years there. The\nRed Cross would sometimes send us a little food. Well, of course, they sent us the kind of food\nyou had to cook. So cooking was a no-no in the camp. You weren't allowed to make a fire. Where\nwould we get the water from? So we did a little bit at a time--our ration of water we put into an old\npot there, we had, we cooked a little, we gave it to the sick ones that couldn't work and couldn't get\nup anymore. We gave a piece of our bread to the wor, because, once you don't work, you're sick,\nyou can't get up, and you can't move, they would give you no food, no water, you just have to die,\nthat's it. So we would share our rations with them, our water ration, our food. We would carry\ntheir load. In other words instead of making uh ten uh walks a day, we did uh 12 or 14, we walked\nfaster, and so we had a right quantity of sand, and they didn't know, they didn't come out. As far as\nmedication or, or, or doctors or anything, there was nil, there was nonexistent. You got sick, you\ndied, that was the end of it. Uh, yet we stuck together. We got organized. One day I was the one\nto make the fire. We used alpha grass. Alpha, that was desert grass, to make a little fire. Because\nwe have no wood there. There were supposed to be guys looking out for the camp commander.\nSomehow they didn't look. He stood in front of me. He says, \"What are you doing?\" I said,\n\"Nothing.\" He says, \"I see your fire there.\" I said, \"I don't see a fire.\" He said, \"You're cooking\nfood.\" I said, \"I'm not cooking food.\" \"Then what are you doing?\" \"I'm just standing here.\" \"Why\naren't you working?\" \"I'm on my break.\" I took out a few minutes. I said, \"Do you think I'm\nstupid?\" He said, \"Well, you said it, I didn't.\" Because we didn't care anymore, uh, uh, nothing\ngood anymore so what the hell, might as well tell him. -----------------------\n-----------------------: Get your garbage together. That means, on the hook again, you know that.\nThen suddenly I found the whole camp, and all the workers, everybody went in front of the gate,\nand said, \"This man isn't going anyplace. He's going to stay right here. You want him, you got to\nget him.\" This was the first defiance, open defiance, the first outrage of the camp. After about a",
        "year and a half of absorbing all that punishment. Well, he, an hour later he called his bahis in on\nhorseback, and there must have been a whole, like the cavalry they're coming, riding into the camp\nwith their sabers drawn, and all we had we had was stones, stones and sand to throw at them. And\nit was a bloody fight. Somehow was a bloody fight. And there was, the reason was twofold. They\ndidn't. They knew I was going to die if I go in the rack once again. That was it. We were skin and\nbones as it was. And the second thing they wanted to go out in the world somebody should, the\nmessage should go out, maybe somebody will help us. Because we're in the middle of a desert,\nnobody knows we're there. That's why they put us there. They don't want the world to know. And\nmaybe the message will go out because they had these wandering Bedouins, these wandering\nArabs, they go to another town, they say, \"Hey, there was some bloody fight up there, way in\nJaffa.\" The word gets out somehow. There was a bloody fight, and we lost quite a few people, and\nthey lost quite a few people. We used to knock \u2018em down off the horses, and with the stones, we\nused to beat them to death. It was a desperate fight for your, it was just desperate, last ditch stand,\nwhatever you may call it. After 1t was all over, they took off with their horses. It was all over,\nthere was no food no water, beatings every day, that we were used to, we endured it, and 2 years\npassed. The Allied, the Allied army landed in Algiers in September of 1944, 43, in 1942. When\nthey were dancing in Algiers and having a good time, they still didn't know there was a camp in\nJaffa in the middle of the desert, and we are still dying, still suffering at the hands of these\nbarbarians. Finally, I know somebody comes. A few trucks came down the dunes--British army\ntrucks with machine guns. There was a plane coming overhead somehow, and the plane must have\nnoticed some tents, a camp, and they didn't know what it was. Could have been German army or\nsomething. So they gave the message up to headquarters, and these tanks, these, uh, armored cars,\nuh trucks, half trucks came down, and they surrounded the camp. There was, suddenly there was\nno guard, no commander, nobody and the gate was open. So we thought that that gate open for us\nto escape, so they can shoot us in the back trying to escape. That would be an excuse before the\nworld uh community to say they tried to escape and we had to shoot them. So we said, nobody\nmoves, nobody gets up. We didn't know what was going to happen. Nobody runs. This was from\n1941 to 1943, 2 years in that camp. And we waited for them, they surrounded the camp, they said,\n\"Who are you people?\" You have to understand we were only about 300 and some left out of\n4000. Naked. No haircuts for 2 years. No bath for 2 years. Non-stop. Emac, emaciated.\nLet's stop. We have to reload.\nbeep.\nWhy don't you start by describing what you looked like.",
        "Yes. What did we look like? And how did we feel...when we saw freedom so close? Well, you\nlooked awful. After 2 yrs of that kind of treatment, of this kind of cruelty, this kind of beatings,\nstarvation, thirst, cold, heat, rat bites--when we are heavy we have rat bites because there were rats\naround, and around--we used to eat rats to keep our, to keep alive, we used to eat dogs, rats and\nsnakes. That was how we supplemented our, our food ration. Desert rats. Without that we\nwouldn't have survived, without uh, eating these things. We looked just about...(phone rings).\nLet's stop.\nBeep.\nBy now we looked really bad. Skin and bones. Our skin used to be like leather because of lack of\nfood and, and the, and the heat beating out. It got hard like leather. Uh. Because we had no\nclothes, uh, sick, we were dragging ourselves by now--we could hardly walk anymore. We didn't\nbother even fighting off the bugs anymore or the, or the lice that we had on the rags that we wore.\nAnd we couldn't believe that we were going to be free. We just couldn't believe it. The day has\nfinally come when we saw light at the end of the tunnel. They pointed the guns at us, then they\nlooked at us, says, \"Do we look like fighters? Like fighting people? Look at us. We are the\nremnants of a persecuted, beaten, starved people. Have you no pity? You too, have you no\ncompassion?\" He said, \"Take away the guns,\" uh, Captain said, \"and get these people on to trucks,\nand take them down to Algiers to the hospital.\" And that's what they did. We got out of the camp,\nwe looked around just once more, on to the camp, and the bodies that we left there, that died there,\nand we just said goodbye to the camp, got on to the trucks, and they took us into the hospital, to the\n96th General Hospital in Maison Carre. I never forgot it. We got there, the order came out, these\npeople are not to get any food or any big amount of water, and these army nurses came and they\napologized for not giving us food, they said, \"You're going to die if you eat food now. You can't\neat anything. Very little.\" They are people. Some of these soldiers had pity and they gave us,\n\"Here take a loaf of bread and you take a loaf of bread.\" They ate it, their stomach busted and died.\nEven afterwards. And after about 4 or 5 weeks in the hospital--they were good to us, uh, they said,\n\"Now what are we going to do with you people? You can go anywhere in the free world. You're\nfree now.\" It's over. I was very angry. And that was the time when I said, \"I don't want to be free.\nNow I don't want to be free.\" When I wanted to be free, the world wouldn't let me. When I\nwanted to live in peace, I was hunted. I was beaten, I was persecuted. Now I don't want to be\nfree.\" So these Italians always looked at me. He says, \"You're 21 years old, you've had enough.\"\n\"No,\" I says, \"I didn't have enough. Now I'm angry. And I don't want to be free. I don't want to",
        "continue this, this game. You give me a gun. Now I want to get back at them.\" He said, \"Why,\nwhy, would you, you had enough fight now?\" I said, \"I want a gun.\" That's what they did. They\nsaid \"Train this man.\" Give me uniform, give him a machine gun,\nand train--couldn't speak a word of English--train him. That's what I did. We went back ------------\n----------------, We did some fighting there, then they sent me to England to London to the wars.\nAnd they gave me a course in army intelligence, they transferred me to army intelligence, and then\nthey transferred me to Germany, to army of occupation, and my job was to look for war criminals.\nPeople that they wanted for war crimes. He says, \"We need (phone rings), He says, \"We need you\nmore to hunt these people than we need you fighting with your gun (background noise) in, in, in\nAfrica. So, I says, \"Fine.\" Then I spent 18 months uh, I spent another year or 2 in Africa, then I\nsaid, \"Okay, fine.\"\nCut. Have to wait for...\nYeah....\nTen is up. Sync take 10 is up.\nBeep.\nI want you to talk to me a little bit about choices. The choices that Jews had, and also, I want you\nto compare it to the choices that you feel various guards had. I mean, were they just following\norders?\nNo, no, no! The the, the, the cruelty, and the, and the, and the barbaric manners of the guards uh,\nuh, uh, that came out by themselves, nobody told them to beat us all the time, nobody told them to\nchain us together, nobody told them to beat us up in chains, and whips, and whip us and, and, and,\nthat camp commander in Jaffa in Africa, nobody told him to deny us water or deny us a piece of\nbread, or, or not to give us uh, not to have us work uh, uh so much in the hot sun. Nobody told\nthem, not, nobody told them to tie us naked to a post and beat us, and to hang us by our arms and\nhose us down, to bury us in the, in the sand so our heads should look up and, and, and, and bash\ntheir brains in and urinate on their heads, nobody told them to do that. They told us to keep us\nthere until, until uh, we, we're supposed to be confined and work on the Transaharian. But nobody\ntold them how much or how hard or how, or what time of day. They could have given us off the\nhottest part of the day, say for 2 hrs and, and let us go into the tent uh, and then give, take us out to\nwork again. No, the, they took this into their own hands, and they enjoyed what they did. You",
        "could see it on their faces, they enjoyed it. As more they would beat you as more they were\nlaughing. As more they hosed you out, as more they were laughing, as more they beat you with the\nback of a rifle into the small of your back, the more they were laughing. As more they saw you\nwrithing in pain, as more they laughed. Nobody told them to do that. They enjoyed it. Take the\nguard mobile. In France. Well, they could have showed more pity, more compassion, more\nunderstanding. The way they treated the people that came there is un, unbelievable. I mean the\ncruelty and the, and the, and the meanness, uh, that they, that they, that they displayed by beating\nwoman and children, throwing them on trucks that they rounded up, and throw them into camps\nand starving them to death. Nobody told them to do that. The high command couldn't care less.\nThey have other problems. They couldn't care less how they treated us, it was the little guy, the\nlittle guard that, that we, the, the perverts, the scum, the garbage of humanity! Those were the ones\nthat did--the ex-convicts, the murderers, the killers, that's what they let on us, like vicious dogs, and\nthey enjoyed what they did. And that is something I can't understand to this day. If a man is\nhelpless, if a person is helpless, and, and, and cannot fight back and is suffering, you don't have to\nadd to it. They tell, \"Put him in jail,\" put him in jail, you don't have to beat him with chains. They\nsaid, \"You have to put him on the boat,\" put him on the boat, get the ---- on the boat. You don't\nhave to beat them with whips or spit at them. Or urinate on them. That isn't necessary. Nobody\ntold them to do that. Because, uh, you have to understand that even in the high command, there\nwere people that were civilized. I mean, there people with uh, with uh, addicts, and people with uh,\nyou know, that would not do these things. You know, it's, it's, it's the underlings, you know, the,\nthe, the little guys that \"Ah, let's have some fun.\" They're the ones that did it. And they did a good\njob, believe me.\nLet's cut for a minute. All right.\nbeep.\nWell, what was the other question?\nOkay, how do you feel that you were able to survive, what you think worked?\nI don't know, the will to live. The hope of seeing my family again, that they would be still alive,\nsomehow they would have escaped. Uh, determination. Stubbornness. Call it what you may.\nThere's one thing I didn't want to do. I didn't want to die. Not at age 18.\nTalk about why you chose to fight.",
        "I had no choice. I wasn't taught to fight, I wasn't born to fight. But, I knew I had a fight on my\nhands, a fight of survival against all odds. I knew I had to fight or go under. Fight or die. Swim or\nsink. I knew that. I realized that when I left home. And I just, and I wouldn't give them the\nsatisfaction of having taken my life, if I could possibly help it.",
        "Could you talk a little about your mother, and the choices you feel that she faced, and how she\nmaybe rescued you in a sense.\nMy mother rescued me, I know that. You see when I was in prison, in --------------, my hometown,\nthere, had a, they had a transport that they put together to go to Buchenwald, and they put us in\nprison to wait till they had enough people together to make a transport to Buchenwald\nconcentration camp. My mother got me out in time. How she did it, I will never know. How I got\nout, I will never know to this day. I know she must have bribed a lot of people. She must have\npaid off a lot of people with a lot of uh, diamonds, we, we were upper middle class people, we were\nwell-to-do people back at home. My father was a chemical engineer, and uh, we had 3 factories,\nand we had uh, 9 stores, 9 businesses, we were very, quite well-to-do people and she had quite a lot\nof things. As you can see on her picture, she has 4 or 5 fur coats, and that was a, a sign of uh, you\nknow, you have it. We had a live-in maid, we had a beautiful home, and she must have, she got me\nout, I know that. And I only feel very, very bad. She was there when I needed her. I wasn't there\nwhen she needed me. And you have to live with this for the rest of your life. So how can you live\nwith? I live with this for so many years. It's hard...It was a nightmare...the cruelty and brutality of\nso many people to so few...and I wonder many times, wouldn't it be better if I would have uh, died\nwith them...they just got killed...(cries)...killed...(crying)...they didn't make it. I wished I had been\nable to help them, but I wasn't there. I guess...I guess we all got damaged by this. We didn't really\ncome out alive, because, uh, we weren't really spared. We are marked. Like the one guard said,\nwhen we said, \"Why don't you kill us, you dog?\" He said, \"No, we want you to live with it.\" And\nwe are living with it, he's right, we are living with it.\nLet's go back and talk about how when you had a chance to take a little revenge.\nThis is, was it really revenge? So what. So we caught a few, uh war criminals. So what. What did it\nhelp us. So we shot a few Nazis. So what. While I was in Africa, so we laid the ditches, and they came\nat us and we shot them down like dogs. So what. Did not help me. Did not take away my pain, my\nsuffering. Did not bring back the people back to life. Did it bring my 3 little sisters? How about my,\nuh, my brother's wife, and, and the baby, they hang them with piano wire on a tree. It took them a half\nan hour to die. Does this make it all good. So what. Your rage, you have rage in you. You have hate\nand rage. Believe me, it hurts you more that it hurts them. It's still there. You're living with it all the\ntime, day and night. There wasn't one day in the last 40 something years that I don't think of it, that I\ndon't think of my family, or what they have done to me, what we had to endure, the guys that had to die,\nthe people that died. So. We are living with it, every one of us, all these years. And the only way that's",
        "going to stop, only way that pain is going to stop, when we die. That's the only time. What else can I\nsay. I couldn't even begin to tell you the cruelties that they did on us. It would take me all day. I can't\neven begin to tell you the things they have done, the things I have seen, and the pain and the suffering\nthat we had to endure, and the hopelessness, and the despair. I can't even begin to tell you that. You\nhave to feel it. That can't be told, has to be felt. And then you ask yourself, \"Why? Why did it happen?\nWhy was it allowed to happen? Why did nobody help us? Why was it just such an unjust world?\" We\nharmed no one. We did nothing to anybody. Why? Here is a people of 60 million, the German people\nof 60million, consists of 60 million, 60 million people, tried to wipe out a people, a whole people, and\nnobody helped. Why is that? And you ask yourself same question over and over again. The rabbi\ncame to my house. He says to me why, why I don't come to the shul. You donate money, you light\ncandles, but you don't come. I said to him, \"When you can tell me where God was when I suffered,\nwhere God was when they killed my 3 little sisters and my mother, and my brothers, and where was\nGod when they threw 200 thousand on open fire and burned them alive? Where was God when they\nkilled 6 million people, like, like savages? Where was God?! You tell me where God was and why he\ndidn't help us and I will go to shul, I promise you. He says nobody has the answer. I know, I've been\nlooking for the answer for many, many years. And somehow I didn't come to terms with my life. It's a\nvery difficult thing to come to terms with your life after you have gone through the kind of, of, of\nbrutality that I have gone through, and I cannot come to terms.\nI want to reroll.\nChange film. CR-10, Sync take 12 is up.\nBeep.\nNow I want you to talk to me about any of the times that in all those horrible experiences, all of you\nsupported each other by making jokes, however, strange they seemed to be. I want you to talk about\nhow you guys stayed together and kept your spirits up.\nIt was very difficult. First of all, not everybody knew everybody. But there was always a joker here\nand there. In all that misery he cracks a joke, and you can't help but smile. You know, like I said\nbefore, we were hanging on our arms in -------- and they were hosing us down with cold water and\nbeating our, the small of our backs with the back of their rifles, and laughing, and it was dark in there,\nand we were freezing, we were hungry, we were thirsty, hanging by our arms. We felt the blood going",
        "down our faces and our bodies. After the beating was over and everything, suddenly you hear that little\nvoice, over to the right there, which says, \"I don't know, I'm trying very hard, I just can't get used to this\nkind of treatment. I wish they would stop.\" He know, they, this wouldn't stop. He says, \"I just can't get\nused, I'm trying!\" he says, \"I'm trying, but I can't get used to it.\" The next morning he was dead. He\nhad internal injuries. They beat him so bad that he had internal injuries, he was hanging there by his\narms dead, and the night before he made a joke. Yes, we got together, there was always someone that\ncould sing, that had a voice, and he would sing. Somebody else would tell a joke. There was somebody\nthat would, you know, in cases like this when you got thrown together with so many people in a small\narea, and you locked in and you can't get out, there was someone that says, \"I just got the news.\" What's\nthe news? \"We're all going to get free tomorrow morning. We're going to join the French Foreign\nLegion.\" Everybody was laughing. You know, there's always, there was always a joker, always one\nthat tried to lift your spirit a little bit. A, a guy was laying next to me. I said to him, \"You know, how\nlong do you think we, they're going to keep us here?\" And he would say, \"-----------------------------------\n-------------------,\"\" that means, \"Everything passes even life.\" That doesn't tell me anything. He said,\n\"Well, you asked me a question, that's the only answer I have. Who knows? Who knows what's going\nto happen to us.\" You see, the, we never knew what was going to happen to us, where it's going to\nhappen, or how it's going to happen. And that was so bad. You see, we never knew from one day into\nanother (phone rings) that our life would be ending, whether they're going to take us out to be shot,\nwhether they going to use for target practice, whether they going to somebody over one, and, they take\nus into an army, or they want to uh, want us to join the French Foreign Legion, which we didn't want,\nthey tried, we didn't want it. Uh, we never knew. And we never knew how long anything is going to\ntake. I was young and never needed a doctor--thank God I was healthy, and but there were people that\nneeded uh, illnesses, sicknesses. They had to live with it. And we found them dead the next day, or the\nday after, or the day after that. And that was it. But there was always somebody, we supported\nourselves uh, uh, we used to sing songs to keep our spirit up. One started a song and everybody got in\nwith it. The song was over, we did something else. Uh, some, we exercised. How did we exercise?\nWe just uh, uh did uh little things on the, on the spot, you know, uh, uh, we lay on our backs and\njumped up or whatever we did and there was always something doing. There wasn't really much, we\nwere so restricted in our activities. Restricted in our thinking, our thoughts, how much can you think\nyou're going to get out?---------------------------And then what? Then you went out of it. And you had to\nget something else to hang onto. \"Heinz, sing a song!\" or \"Marx, tell us a story.\" And that would end,\nand then what? Confinement is day and night and day and night, and there was nothing to distract us\nfrom anything. We had no quality of life of any kind. Nothing. Nothing to do, nothing to say, nothing\nto read, nothing to listen to. Back in Jaffa, we had no music for 2yrs. We didn't know what music was.",
        "We knew it was nighttime because the sun went down. It was daytime because the sun came up. That\nwas all we knew. We lost track of everything. We were totally lost in space, and that's what they\nwanted us to be. See, see he's dead, that's what's going to happen you tomorrow. And there was just\nnothing, this feeling of helplessness, despair, no hope, this is a very depressing feeling, and that 1s what\nwe had, that's what we had to live with. And then once in a while, you would think of your family. I\nwonder. I wonder what's happened to them. You see, I wonder how they died, if they died, I wonder\nhow they died, I wonder where they're buried. I wish I could lay a flower on their grave. I wished I\ncould do something for them. Whatever little I could do, I would do. I wish that I could kneel on their\ngrave and tell them that I'm so sorry, that I'm alive, and they're not. I wish I could tell them that.\nPeople cling to the idea that surviving is heroic. What is your opinion about that?\nYes, uh, surviving is something that you have in you. Nobody wants to die. Everybody wants to\nsurvive. Whether heroic or not, everybody has that will, the will to survive. No one wants to die,\nand if anybody tells you different, they're liars. You can do it any which way, you can do it in a\nheroic way, or you can do it in any other way, any way you can do, you survive any which way, but\nyou survive, that was our motto, to survive, any which, any way we can. Absorb beatings,\nstarvation, thirst, bugs, scorpion, anything that you can surv, any way you can, you survive. No\nmatter how difficult, no matter how complicated, no matter how hopeless things look, no matter\nhow bad things look, you want to live. That's all there is to 1t. And that's in every human being, the\nwill to live. Every human being has that. You don't give, you don't lay down and die. Nobody\ndoes that. You want to go on. And that's what it's all about. Go ahead, hit me some more. Go\nahead, don't give me any food, I don't care. You, you come to a point in your life with all this\ncruelty and uh, and uh viciousness that you say some, you say \"I don't feel that anymore. Let them\nnot give me food, I don't care.\" You, you don't care anymore, but you still want to live. You don't\nworry about the beatings anymore. One more, one less, what's the difference. So they bury me in\nthe sand, so what. So, so they spit in my face, so what. I'm still going to come out of in a, in spite.\nCan you understand that...philosophy? That's what we had to adopt, that kind of philosophy. No\nmatter what they do to us, I'm not going to allow them the ultimate as to kill me, I'm not going to\nallow them to do that to me, if I can help it. If my body and my spirit, uh, will keep me going.\nDon't allow them to break your spirit, that's what they try to do. That's the reason I'm sitting here\nnow. Many times I stood at the barbed wire, close to the barbed wire and I said to my friend, Max,\n\"Max, do you think we'll ever get out of here, ever? It is so long. You think we'll make it?\" His\nanswer would always be \"Tomorrow...tomorrow we'll be free.\" And after we got free after 2 yrs",
        "we couldn't believe it. I said, \"Max, are we really free? Is it really happening? We walk and no\nguard in the back of us? We're not going get beaten today? We're going to get some, what, is it, 1s\nit really true? We couldn't believe it. We cried. We couldn't believe that we are actually, got\nsomething that it was rightfully ours in the first place--that nobody had a right to take away from us\nin the first place. Can you understand that? This is, this is the feeling you have. You start a whole\nnew life. You're born again. But then you get a setback: but my family hasn't made it. I made it\nnow, but they haven't. And then you wish that...tell them you're sorry, tell them anything, talk to\nthem, talk to a piece of ground, talk to anything, we don't even have that, we can't even do that.\nWe need to reload.\nBeep.\n-----------------------------(Sandy's question--couldn't hear)\nIn 1947, no 1937, in 1937 Hitler had a speech, for the world, for the whole world. I heard the\nspeech, and he said, \"We don't want the Jews.\" He said to the world, \"Either you take them out, or\nwe will kill them. We don't want them.\" Simple as that. Send ships and planes, do whatever you\nwant, take them out, and uh, distribute them wherever you want to do, but we don't want them here\nin Germany, although Jews have lived in Germany for generations. There was no answer. The\nonly answer was from the outside was from the outside world like France, Belgium, Holland,\nwhatever countries, Switzerland, they're all, not only did they not take Jews in, they closed the\nborders. Now, the Jews were really trapped. They couldn't even get out. On top of that, the\nGermans, the Nazis, had confiscated everything the German Jews had, all their money, all their\nbank accounts, they have closed their homes, they left them nothing. If you wanted to buy a pair of\nshoes, you had to make an application. So they would give you your own money, uh, uh x amount\nof dollars so you can buy a pair of shoes and that was at the beginning, later on they wouldn't even\ndo that anymore. So everything was confiscated. Not only did the Jews have no place to go in the\nworld where nobody would take them in, but now they took away the means for them to leave. If\nyou have no money, you can't buy a train ticket. If you have no money you can't buy a bus ticket.\nThey took the cars away--if you had a car, what way you going to, supposing you have 4 children,\nand there's a mother and a father, and the children are little. Where you going to walk the, uh, walk\non the, on the, on the highways? Could they walk to Belgium? Whose got point, who has guns\npointed at you? You going to walk to France? Who's going to beat you to death? You going to",
        "walk into Italy that's going to throw you back into Germany? Where were you going to go? There\nwas no place to go and no means to do it with. It just was no, they just took every means of\ntransportation away from them, and countries didn't help. Where was the vatican? There wasn't\nanybody. They couldn't go anyplace. Where were you going to go? You have a household, you\nmaybe have a baby, where you going to run? Children saying, \"I'm hungry Ma. I'm thirsty Ma.\nI'm tired Ma.\" Where you going to go? Lay on the highway? And if you had a ----------- they\nwould beat you to death. Don't make no, make no mistake about this, they said 60 million\nGermans, there were only | million Nazis. Make no mistake. There were 60 million Germans,\nthere were 60 million Nazis. Make no mistake about that. Because you can't tell me that 1 million\nNazis could have done all that harm and hurt, and 59 million righteous Germans would not\ninterfere, could not, could not have interfered. Could not have stopped it. Nobody can tell me that.\nOh, they try to, but they can't because I don't believe it. You go on the street, people, civilians,\nthey would beat you to death, they would beat you up, they would break your windows, they, they\nwould rob you and steal from you, and rape your daughters. That was hard. They were Germans,\nafter all. And as far as, uh, the Jew went to the slaughterhouse like sheep, well, I don't know what\nyou could have done when you suddenly got torn out of your household, put into a concentration\ncamp, guarded with heavy machine guns, and, and, and, and, under the most brutal and barbaric\ncircumstances, you tell me what you could have done. Against the well-armed and well-prepared\nGerman Nazi Party. You tell me what you could have done. How you could have fought back.\nYou have a baby in one hand, and you take a spoon and hit them over the head with a spoon.\nWhat, what could you have done? What could you have, your husband do? He just looks at them\ncrooked and they shoot him down like a dog. Mothers who had little babies in their arms, the\nguards went up to them and blew the kid's brain out. They would play with them. The little baby\nplay with it, and then they would pull the trigger on it. Why the mother hold the baby in the arm,\nand tell the mother, \"We want you to live with it. We're not going to kill you, we want you to live\nwith that. We want you to have nightmares for the rest of your days.\" How would you fight back?\nHow could you fight back? My mother had 7 children. She was a housewife. Not knew nothing\nabout politics. She knew how to cook dinner, and clean a house, but she knew nothing about\npolitics. What would my mother have done? My father was a chemist. What could he have done?\nThey put you into a place, they put barbed wire around it. All it takes is 2 Nazis with machine\nguns, that's all. How you fight these people? You ------ them? You want your little son to be\nfatherless? Or you want your little daughter to have no mother? Can you take that chance.\nMaybe, there's always that maybe they won't kill you. Maybe they won't put your children in the\ngas chambers. Maybe they won't hang your wife. Maybe, just maybe. But you hang on to that",
        "maybe. You clutch to it. Maybe they won't see me. Maybe they have a change of heart. But there\nwas no maybe there. But you hung on to it. How're you going to fight back? Got to have these,\nthese barbarians with heavy guns. How do you fight them? Here, you see, you have 2 opposing\narmies, they're both armed, they're both trained to fight. Okay, let them fight. What army did you\nhave here. You had a Jewish people, working people, that raised families, they were housewives,\nthe husbands went to work in the morning, the children went to, to the, to the, school if there was a\nschool. What army? What prepared them? They prepared from 1933 to 1936-37, they prepared,\nthey were marching with their boats and with their guns and with their knives, and prepared, they,\nthey were prepared to slaughter a people. And the Jewish people be-, refused to believe it. They\nsaid, \"Nobody would do such a, such a outrageous thing! After all, we've been living here for\ngeneration, nobody would do that to another people.\" Can you understand that? Nobody believed\nit, nobody, nobody would think that such a thing would possibly happen. What kind of opponent\nwas the Jewish man or the Jewish child or the Jewish mother? What kind of opponent. Well, they\nprepared for 6 years to make war to slaughter people. They were marching with their boots since\n1933. And now they're big men. They're big strong men, they're going to take care of everything.\nAnd take a little ------, and throw it in the door, and fire, burn it alive. They're going to, they're\ngoing to show you what heroes they are. They are mighty, mighty men! No, I don't think they\nwent to the slaughter like sheep. I think they showed a lot of heroics. They showed a lot of, of\ncourage. They didn't beg for their lives. They didn't ask for pity. They went like a proud people.\nThey saw they had no choice, they kept their dignity and their pride, and that's how they died, with\ndignity and pride, and that is how we tried to endure our punishment, with dignity and pride, as\nbest as we could. They used to take a little girl, to put, to hang her with piano wire and the mother\nsays goodbye to her little daughter, 10 years old or 9 years old, may God be with you darling.\nKnowing very well I'll never see you again. Or the little girl that, the little boy that got lost who\nwas 5 years old, never see Mommy again, and the Mommy gets taken into the gas chambers, and\nhe's walking around, doesn't know what's happening. I was 16, 17, I didn't know what was\nhappening, I couldn't understand what was happening. You want them to fight? No, all they could\ndo was show dignity and pride. That's all they could do. They could, the died at least with, with\nthat much. And the little kids that died, they didn't know why, they said, \"Mama, why? Why are\nwe here?\" They couldn't understand. What are you going to tell them? What would I tell my little\ngrandson who's six years old? What could I tell them. What could I tell my little granddaughter\nwho 1s 3 years old, why she has to die. Why she has to burn alive in a, in a, in a, in a big flame, in a\nbig pot full of wood, with flaming wood, why? To this day, we are asking why. Why became a\nvery famous word. To this day, why? Nobody has the answer. Do you have the answer? I wish",
        "you'd tell me. I don't have the answer. I think of it day and night, but I don't can't find an answer. I\ncan find only pain inside me and hurt and, and, and, the burning, the burning desire to be able to, to\nuh, to accept this. To accept, you have to accept these things, it's so difficult, it's so hard to accept.\nSome things are just, very hard to accept. This is one of them. Right?\nThank you.\nWhat else can I tell you?\nNothing else.\nEnd of Sound Roll. Short roll.",
