        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Doris\nSmall. Conducted by Milda Morkyte on the 16th of October at the Kindertransport\nAssociation Conference in Arlington, Virginia. So, Doris, let's start from the beginning.\nPlease tell me when -- when you were born? Where?",
        "Answer: I was born in Berlin, Germany, in July 1923.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you were born Doris -- as Doris --",
        "A: Dora Costinski (ph).",
        "Q: Dora Costinski. Who are your parents?",
        "A: My parents came from Poland, but my father was a prisoner in the first World War\ntaken by the Germans and that's how he got to Germany. And that's how my sister and I\nwere born there.",
        "Q: What were your parents names?",
        "A: My father name was Max Mosik in Polish or Hebrew, Moshe. Whichever name you\nwant to pick.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My mother was Hilda Moyim (ph) and in German Maria.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And you see -- you had two sisters?",
        "A: I had one sister.",
        "Q: One sister.",
        "A: And one brother. I'm the youngest one. I was.",
        "Q: What were their names and when were they born?",
        "A: My brother?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: My brother's name was Alan Baer Costinski. He want that last name. And he was\nborn in Larch, Poland. And he came with my mother just shortly before the -- the first\nWorld War to Germany.",
        "Q: With your mother only?",
        "A: Yeah. Because my father was a prisoner in a German prison camp. And she knew\nabout it. She walked all the way from -- but the Germans came and they took everything\naway and there was nothing left. She had two more children younger than the one that I\nknew, and that's a boy and girl, but they both died, I really don't know how. But the\nGermans came in and they -- that's the first World War.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And they destroyed everything and there was nothing left for her. So when she only\nhad that one little boy left, she took him and she walked all night. And during the day,\nshe stopped over somewhere on a farm, and only nights she walked until she -- by the\ntime she reached the border from Poland to Germany, the war was practically over and\nshe just walked across. And she went to the prison camp where my father was and they\ngot together. And there was nothing to go back to to Poland. So they stayed in Germany.\nBut then later on after they got a little established, my sister was born in 1921 and I was\nborn in 1923.",
        "Q: What's your sister's name?",
        "A: IdA:",
        "Q: Okay. So what do you remember from Berlin? Tell me about your childhood. What\ndid your parents do?",
        "A: Well, after the war it wasn't bad. We were free. But unfortunate -- which had nothing\nto do with Hitler -- when I was only three years old, my mother fell down a flight of stairs\nand she never recovered. It wasn't anybody's fault. It was her own fault. She should\nhave gone into the hospital and be in a cast. But she said, I have small children and I\ncan't afford to go into a cast and she neglected herself, which had nothing to do with\nHitler or anything. He wasn't even there yet. And, of course, after a while instead of\ngetting better, she got worse. And she's been in and out of hospitals since I remember.\nSo I was only three so I barely remember my mother. And by the time I started school\nthere was talk about Hitler being the new chancellor of Germany. So my father said,\nwell, I think we're going to put the girls right away in a Jewish school. Because my\nbrother went to a German school.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: When he first came to Germany he couldn't speak the language, but it was different.\nBut when he heard about Hitler being so much against Jews, he says, I'm not going to put\nthe girls in the Jew -- in the German school. So we went right away into a Jewish school.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: From the time we started kindergarten.",
        "Q: But you could speak German?",
        "A: Well, we learned German and we learned Hebrew --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- in the school. We had every morning one hour of Hebrew from Monday to Friday\nfive days a week and then it was from eight to nine. And nine o'clock we had regular\nsubjects, German, arithmetic, geography, history, you know --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- regular subjects. But it was only for Jewish children.",
        "Q: So most of your friends were Jewish or did you have German friends?",
        "A: Well, not really because mostly after school you go to somebody's house. But as I did\nnot really have a home to go -- I mean, I had a home but there was nobody there --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- because my mother was in and out of the hospital. My father was busy and I had to\nmake a living so we had to go to day care. So straight from school we went into day care\nand we were there until six o'clock at night.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: By that time my father was home -- and so I --",
        "Q: So the day care was for German children too, right? It wasn't --",
        "A: No, it was Jewish.",
        "Q: Oh, it was Jewish?",
        "A: It was a Jewish day care, yes. We had sort of a hot meal during the day so at night\nwasn't much of a meal just, like, a sandwich or something.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And what did your father do?",
        "A: Well, as I said he was in the Army when he -- before he came to Germany. So he\ndidn't really have a profession. So the -- at first, he did whatever he could just to make a\nliving for us. But then he opened up a little tobacco store. And those days everybody\nsmoked and it was a good business. He was doing -- I mean, we were not rich, but he\nmade a living. We had enough to pay rent. There was always food on the table and he\nwas doing all right.",
        "Q: So you remember Hitler coming to power?",
        "A: Yes. By the time I started school it was practically -- as a matter of fact, they used to\nput on the radio in the schools and we had to listen to his speech.",
        "Q: Oh, in the --",
        "A: In the Jewish school.",
        "Q: -- Jewish school?",
        "A: Yeah. So his voice...",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism when you were a child or before?",
        "A: You mean in the street? Well, at the beginning in the early '30s it wasn't bad.\nEverybody was very nice to us. And as a matter of fact, we lived in an apartment\nbuilding. It was a walker. And as you come up the stairs there were two apartments on\neach floor. Here was our apartment and this was a -- German people. And there was\nonly one wall between our living room and their living room and you could hear\npractically -- when they walked or every word they said, you know, like the next room.\nAnd we had no problem. I don't even know if there were other Jewish people in this\napartment building. There were four floors, something like that. But because I wasn't\nhome all day. I just left 7:30 in the morning to go to school. I came home late at night. I\nnever saw anybody. But the lady that lived right next door to us on the same floor, my\nfather used to go early in the morning, like, six o'clock and that -- those days we didn't\nhave refrigeration -- and used to go down and buy some groceries. I don't know if every\nday. Depends on the weather how long you can keep it. And every time used to come\nout early in the morning and the lady came out. She used to say, good morning to you.\nHow are you how? How 1s your wife doing? Because she knew she was sick. Once --\nso sorry. You got small children and with a sick mother. And they were friendly people.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Do you know their name or --",
        "A: Oh, I can't remember the name.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I know there was only a lady and a young boy was there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I don't know. He was like a teenager later on. And as we (?certain?) were so many\nyears. But then in 1936 my mother passed away. And, you know, I wouldn't even know\nit but -- you know what a Minyan 1s?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: You have a ShivA:",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah. Or when somebody passes away for one week we have mourning.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Which they call a ShivA: People come in the morning for service and they used to\ncome in the evening. Twice we have the Minyan. Minyan means you have to have at\nleast 10 people.",
        "Q: Oh, yes. Yes.",
        "A: 10 men to make the service. So in '36 it wasn't bad. My father belonged to the\nsynagogue, people used to come. We're not allowed to go out for one week and people\nbring you food to the house. So we were in that whole week. We didn't go anywhere.\nBut the next -- the following Sunday -- my mother died on a Friday in July of '36. So on\nSunday was the funeral. So the following Sunday when we finished the Shiva, my father\nwas going downstairs to buy groceries for following week or days. So the minute he got\ninto the store the lady jumped on him. She says, I know your wife died more than a week\nago and you did not turn in her ration cards. That's how I remember we must have been\non ration. '36. That was three years before the war. And if you ask me, I wouldn't even\nknow we were on ration. Just because he came up and he told us the story. So he says, I\nbeg your pardon. I was in mourning. We don't go out for one week. And I came down\nthis morning to turn her in ration card and buy my groceries. So she calmed down.\nBecause 1n '36 it wasn't too bad.",
        "Q: When did it get bad?",
        "A: You could still talk to a Jewish person. But when we went to the park all the benches\nhad written on, not for Jews. You couldn't sit on. But there were only three benches in\nthat whole big park, huge park, only for Jews. But nobody ever sat on those three\nbenches. I remember that because some time on a Saturday --",
        "Q: How did you feel about that, that you couldn't --",
        "A: We were just kids, you know. But like on the Saturday or Sunday when we didn't go\nto school or day care we use to say, oh, Papa, can we go to the park? You know, but he\nworked hard all week. He had to get up early. And he said, oh, I'm so tired. So in the\nwinter, of course, he used to go sleep in the afternoon. But in the summer, you know, he\ntried to be nice. I mean, I didn't realize, you know, we had no mother most of the time,\nand he was mother and father. But when you're a child, you don't realize that it's a double\njob for him. So he tried to be nice and he took us to the park as much as he could. And I\nremember one day we were in the park, we were playing something like hopscotch on the\nfloor, my sister and I. And he sat down on the bench and it said, not for Jews. But he\nhad covered the writing.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And he figures, well -- but he did not look Jewish because he had light eyes. He had\ngray hair since I remember. So he must have been on the light side. And then a man, a\nGerman man, came and sat down next to him on the bench. And he was watching us\nplaying and he tried to make a conversation with my father. He didn't know who he was.\nSo he says, you know, I feel sorry for those children. Isn't it terrible what they're doing to\nthem? At that time -- so my father just sat and he nodded. He didn't say anything. So we\njust came over and we said, oh, Papa, something -- when he heard us calling him papa,\nwhich means father, he realized that he was our father. And he got up and he flew away\nlike they were chasing him. In case they catch him talking to him, they'll arrest him.\nThat's how bad it was.",
        "Q: So that was later and not -- because you said in '36 it wasn't that bad.",
        "A: No. Yeah, '36 it wasn't too bad. But Hitler was in power since '33.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And '36 it was already -- you know --",
        "Q: So do you remember --",
        "A: It was hard to walk in the street.",
        "Q: Was it gradually that...",
        "A: Yeah. Little by little it got worse and worse. But then later on the lady came up. Did\nI say this already? And she said, how is your wife and all this? And then she says, well,\nyou have to excuse me, I wouldn't able to say good morning to you anymore.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: Because my son is now in the Hitler Youths. 16-year-old boy. And if he sees me\ntalking to you, he'll report me. I'm talking to a Jew.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: 16 years old. She was afraid of him. Right next door. We were living next door to\neach other for years. She says, I have nothing against you personal. We've been living\ntogether for a long time. We've been -- you've been a good neighbor. It's nothing. So\nmy father just said, I understand. He knew. It wasn't her fault. She's a very nice lady.\nI don't know if there was a man there because he only was talking about her and the son.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: So I have no idea if there was a father there or not.",
        "Q: But you do remember her and her son?",
        "A: I don't too well. But my father used to see her very often. She probably went out the\nsame time when he used to go out in the morning.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Maybe she had to go to work or something, you know. But there was nothing\npersonal. She was very nice. We lived together for years, you know. People lived next\ndoor, they have problems, too much noise, fighting. You know, we never had a problem.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: But then, of course, in 1938 all of a sudden -- as soon as my mother died he start\ngetting sick. But he just was losing his voice. So he went to the doctor a few times. Was\ntreating him for a cough -- cough medicine. And we had no ideA: Finally, we found out\nthat it was more than a cough, he had throat cancer. And --",
        "Q: He was working at the tobacco --",
        "A: -- he suffered for two years. And to the day same July two years later he passed away.",
        "Q: And now were how old?",
        "A: 14.",
        "Q: 14?",
        "A: Yeah. I was 12 when my mother died. I was only three when she got sick. She was\nbedridden for nine years. See -- which had nothing to do with Hitler.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: It a different story. It's just my story.",
        "Q: Yes. That's --",
        "A: Yeah. But then in '38 it was already very bad. But while my father was still alive he\nwas trying so hard to get us out. He kept writing letters and letters to family he had in\nNew York. And he says, it's getting very bad here. I don't care for myself, I'm an old\nman. He was in his 50s. He thought he was old. But the children, please, try to do\nsomething for the children. So you know what they wrote him back, if you need a few\ndollars, I'll send it to you.",
        "Q: Where are the relatives?",
        "A: Yeah, relatives.",
        "Q: And where --",
        "A: In New York.",
        "Q: How close were they -- what was the relationship?",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, my father lost his mother giving -- she was giving birth to him.\nShe died in childbirth. And those brothers and sister were from second wife. So they\nwere half brothers and sisters.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But he wrote to the sister and he said --",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Oh, no, please.",
        "Q: Oh, yeah. Sure. I'm -- sure. Sure.",
        "A: I don't want to in case somebody's alive, I don't want to say it. But -- {laughter} but\nshe says -- he says, I don't want any money. I need a visA: Please take the children out.\nThings are very, very bad here. Never answered. And it was -- but in '36 and '38, the\ntwo years -- he was sick for two years. For -- as soon as she died he start getting sick.\n'38 he died. They both died in July and both on a Friday. Isn't that something?",
        "Q: That's a --",
        "A: Friday is such a day for me. Well, anyhow so --",
        "Q: So you were left orphans in '38?",
        "A: Yes, we were left orphans. That was in July of '38. But as I said, my brother was a lot\nolder than me because he was born in Poland. There were two more children after him.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: There must have been, like, two or three years old, or four something. A little boy and\na little girl but he was the oldest one. So that's why he's so much older than we --",
        "Q: So how -- how old was he?",
        "A: Well, he was 10 years older than my sister.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And 12 years older than me. Because, as I said, when they were in Poland, like, he\nwas six years old and the little one probably was two and four. So by the time he came to\nGermany must have been seven, almost eight.",
        "Q: So he was around 27 around that time?",
        "A: Yeah. But then they took a few years before my sister and I were born because you\njust can't have children.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You got to get established, you got to get a place to live, you know. It was just -- it\nwas in the war. He was a prisoner, you know. So, you know, he had to wait until he\nmakes a little money to get an apartment. And then my sister and I were born in the early\n'20s. So my brother was really quite a bit older, 10 years older.",
        "Q: So he had already -- did he already have a job when you're father died?",
        "A: My brother?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, he was working.",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "A: Well, he was working by machine, like, tailoring because he didn't have -- he couldn't\ngo to higher education, you know. And so he had to do whatever to make a living. And\nmy father had the tobacco store. And around Christmastime they used to have -- I don't if\nthey're called -- what you call it here it -- like a Christmas market.",
        "Q: Yeah, I guess a Christmas market.",
        "A: Yeah, they had -- they opened up tables and --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- sell things a few weeks -- like, a month before Christmas. So after school he used\nto take merchandise from our father's store, opened a table, put up cigarettes and cigars\nand tobacco. And they would sell. You're -- because it was so cold, Christmastime, and\nthey saw a young kid, 12, 14 years old and they used to buy from him and he make more\nmoney than my father made in the store. He was jealous on him. He was a good brother\nand a good son. And, of course, after my father died 1t was very hard. We couldn't even\nget a Minyan to go to for the funeral. We went to the cemetery when we buried our\nfather. And my father was collecting people and paying them so we could have 10\npeople for the funeral for the service. Isn't that terrible?",
        "Q: So why was --",
        "A: Because there was not many Jews left and -- from the congregation I'm talking, you\nknow. And there were very few and it was very hard. It was bad already. We wouldn't\nwalk in the street. They used to throw rocks at us. And even going to school.",
        "Q: Did you have to wear the star?",
        "A: Not at that time. It started after -- after I already came to England. So it was -- but\nthey used to throw -- especially in the winter. They used to take a rock and put the snow\non it, like, a snowball. And they used to throw that. It was so painful.",
        "Q: Was it children who would do that?",
        "A: Kids. Yeah. Teenage. They used to throw the rocks. It was so painful. I was afraid\nto go -- we walked to school. We had no transportation. So I was really afraid to go to\nschool. And after my father died, you know, my brother even tried very hard. And, you\nknow, he felt like a young father to us. He was so much older. He was responsible.",
        "Q: He was.",
        "A: He was trying to make a living for us. Well, thank God my father put away a few\ndollars. We didn't have it in the bank. So just a couple months later -- well, he died in\nJuly, this was August, September, October. Three months later. October 28, to be the\nexact date. Early in the morning, about 7:30 in the morning on a Friday, Friday morning,\nthe doorbell rang. A policeman was outside. I was afraid to open the door. And my\nbrother was just getting ready to go to the synagogue for the Minyan, you know, to say\nKaddish for my father. He said a whole year Kaddish first for my mother. Now, he\nstopped a little. Now, he had to say it for my father. So he was just getting ready to go to\nsay Kaddish for my father. And when the doorbell rang, he came out. He was still in\npajamas. I looked through the peephole. He says, who's at the door? I said, it's a\npoliceman. He says, open the door. We didn't do anything. Why are you afraid?\nI was afraid to open the door. He went over, opened the door, and the policeman says,\nHerr Costinski? You know, his name. And he says, yes, it's me. So he says, better come\nand see -- please come with me. So he says, wait a minute. What did I do? He said, oh,\nI know you didn't do anything. But we just want to take you to the police headquarters\nask you some questions. Then he looked at us two, my sister and me, kids. He says, oh,\nhe'll be back soon. So he said, would you mind if I get dressed first? He was in pajamas.\nTo him he didn't care what he wore. They wore pajamas anyhow in the camp. So he\nsays, all right. But make it snappy. Leave the door open. Watched him getting dressed.\nSo, you know, if you're in a hurry, you don't look what you're going to wear. Whatever\nwas there you put on. A pair of pants and a top. By the first October 28th, 1938, the day\nof the deportation and it was cold. But you figure he'll be back in a couple of hours. So\nhe didn't put a sweater or a jacket or anything. Just a shirt and pants. And he took him. I\nwent through the front room and I saw a truck down there and I saw him sitting right in\nthe corner. He said he'll be back soon, right? That's the last time I ever saw him. I never\nsaw him after that day. I never forget this day. We waited and waiting the whole\nweekend.",
        "Q: You were staying -- and you stayed at home and you waited?",
        "A: But it was Friday morning. We waited Saturday and Sunday. He never came back. I\nnever went back to school either, not since that day. I never saw any of my schoolmates\nor teachers. Anybody.\nMonday morning was the first of November and the doorbell rang. When I saw the agent\nfrom the landlord outside, I wasn't afraid to open the door because I've known him since I\nwas a little girl. So I open the door and I said, oh, good morning. You came for the rent.\nI'll go and get it. First of the month. Every first of the month -- we didn't pay checks that\ntime. We used to pay cash. My father always taught me, every week you put a quarter of\nthe rent away. So when the month comes, rent is the most important thing. Even if you\nhave nothing else, no money, you got to have a roof over your head. So when I turn --\noh, you came for the rent. I'll go and get it. He said. No, no, no, no, no. I didn't come\nfor the rent. I came to ask you two girls to leave this apartment at once. I said, why?\nWe're paid up. We don't owe anything. So he said, oh, I know you don't know anything\nbut you're both minors and you cannot occupy this place. So I said, but my brother is not\na minor. He was older than us. And since our father died it was put on his name. So he\nsaid, but you brother isn't here. I said, he's only been gone two days. He'll be back. Oh,\nno. Your brother was deported and he will never come back.",
        "Q: That's what he told you?",
        "A: And he knew us for years since we are little girl. While I was talking to him my sister\nwent to get the money and she came out with cash from the other room, and when he saw\nall that money in her hand he took the whole month's rent. And then -- I mean, he knew\nus for so many years since we were little. All of a sudden, you know, he was really\nfollowing orders. But he didn't want to do it, but he had no choice. So he said, okay.\nOkay. I'll let you say a little longer. And he took the whole month's rent. But that week\nwas Kristallnacht.",
        "Q: Oh, it with was the same week?",
        "A: November.",
        "Q: So did you -- when he told you that your brother was deported, did you believe that?\nDid you understand what that meant or...",
        "A: We heard on the radio that they deported all of the Jewish men from 16 to 60 from\nBerlin. And from -- as it's smallest towns, women and children also. But from Berlin\nitself it was men and boys from 16 to 60. So he was over 16. And, you know, they came\nfor my father too a little later because he was under 60. He was in his 50s so they came\nfor him too. And he was already dead. It didn't go in yet --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- you know. So I said, you can't have him anymore, he's gone. Okay. They didn't\ncare. But they would have deported him too. See, and we were alone.",
        "Q: And you were left alone and you became the -- no, your sister was older than you,\nright?",
        "A: Yeah. She was 16. Still young.",
        "Q: So what did you do after the landlord left?",
        "A: We looked around the apartment and, you know, there were five of us living here now\nthere's only two left. What do you take and where do you go? We had no place to go.\nWe didn't know what to take. Shall we take clothes? Shall we take dishes? Linens?\nWhat do you take? You know, we had no place to go. So my sister just look a few\npictures that she can still put in her pocket, you know, little pictures, old pictures from\nmy parents and the little one. One of the babies that died, we had a picture. He has them\nof us on it so I don't know if he came before or after. And she took my mother's wedding\nring and I think a necklace with, like, a watch on it. She took a few things. That's not\nmuch. A small suitcase we took. Change of clothing. And that's all. What could we\ntake? We had furniture. We had dishes. Linens. We had my mother's trousseau. Every\nsingle -- there was her name engraved. We had to leave everything behind.",
        "Q: And where did you go?",
        "A: We had no place to go. We were out in the street. But then we met somebody that\nknew my father but I didn't even know the man that well. It was a German Jew but he\nwas married to a Gentile German lady.",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?",
        "A: Yes. Albert Brusch and her name was Herta or BerthA: I don't know. But anyhow --\nbut he lived way across town. We were northeast in Berlin and he was, like, on the east\nside. You had to take one or two trains to go there. So he met us and he said, what you\ntwo girls doing in this cold weather out in the street with the suitcase? So I said, they\nthrew us out from the apartment. He said, I know your mother was sick and she passed\naway. What happened to your dad? I said, he died just a few months ago. Well, didn't\nyou have an older brother? I said, yeah, but they took him away. He said, oh, my God.\nHe says, no wonder my hair is gray. He was 64 years old. So he says, what 1s this\ncountry coming to? He was a German Jew but he did not practice Judaism. He was just\na German citizen. He fought in the first World War in the German Army. And he was,\nlike, a real German citizen.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But he still considered a Jew by the Nazis. No matter how many generations. So he\nsaid, well, I have only a one-bedroom apartment, but if you want to sleep in the bathroom\nyou're welcome. I said, thank you. Thank you. So he took us to his house and my sister\nslept in the bathtub and he put up a folding bed next to the bathtub and I slept on this.\nAnd his wife was so wonderful. She welcomed us with open arms. She said, I'm so sorry\nwhat this is coming to. She didn't approve, but she had no choice. And she cooked for\nus. First time we had a hot meal and actually a bed to sleep in, if you call it a bed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But was a roof over your head, like my father said.",
        "Q: So had you spent several days outside on the streets or was it the first day that you\nleft? Did you have to spend some days on the street, like, sleep on the street nights?",
        "A: It was cold. It was very dangerous until that man took us. Well, anyhow, we were\nthere for a while and she was very nice to us. She says, oh, my God, you girls have no\nclothes to wear. Would you believe she took me to a store and bought me clothes and my\nsister? She said, I'm so sorry. And he said, I would love to adopt you two. We have no\nchildren. I would love to have adopt you both, but there's no future for you here. She\nwas so wonderful to us.",
        "Q: Where they well-off or...",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, they had acar. In those days very few people had a car. He had a little\nbusiness. And, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying how rich they were but they had an\napartment, one bedroom, a living room, dining room, you know. They were not poor, but\nI wouldn't say they were rich, but they were comfortable. And -- but before we turned\naround it was December and it was Christmas and the doorbell rang. When she opened\nthe door her brother was there in an SS uniform, younger brother. So he wanted to spend\nChristmas Eve with them. He was probably stationed nearby and he needed a place to\nspend the evening. So they went into the dining room and he was -- she says, quickly,\nquick go to the bathroom. Lock the door. Don't make a light. Don't even breathe. She\nwas so afraid of him. So he went in and he was drinking and drinking and singing all the\nGerman songs. Oh salute, you know. And he must have been so drunk. He was\nsinging. I could hear it. I was so scared in that bathroom with my sister. It was so dark.\nWe couldn't see each other even. And I said, isn't he ever going to leave? Finally, he\nsaid, okay. Okay -- in German, of course, he's going. I said, thank God. All of a sudden\nhe said, okay. Okay. One more for the road. And back to the another drink, another\ndrink. She wanted to get rid of him already. Finally, he left. She knocked on the door of\nthe bathroom. She said, okay. Girls, you can come out now. We opened the door, we\ncouldn't see a thing because we had been so many hours in the dark. No window, no\nlight. I felt like blinded until I could open my eyes. So she says, I'm so sorry. I don't\nknow if I can keep you any longer. My brother could come anytime unexpected. I mean,\nI understood this, but what could I do? Again, we were on the go. But he said, don't\nworry. I made an application for both of you for the Kindertransport. He says that I\nheard that England opened up visas. He told us this at the beginning when we first came.\nI forgot about this. So he says, England opened up visas for 10,000 children up to 16.\nAnd I was 14 and my sister was 16. 16 she could still go. So he says, and I'm sure you\nwill both qualify, you're orphans, you're homeless, they should take you first, right? But\nanyhow from the time he made the application and he says -- well, when we had to leave\nthere he didn't throw us out, but we had to go. What about if her brother comes back and\nsees us there? So, again, we had to go. Whoever took us in. So then he says, well, I'm\nsure it will soon come through. You'll be going to England very soon. Wouldn't take\nlong. But do you know how long it took? Nine months. Next year we first had the apply\n-- the letter in July. I can go to England but my sister's birthday was in May. She was\ntwo months too old. If you would have gotten it in May she could go. But she was two\nmonths too old. They came in July and they gave you a whole list what I could take.\nOnly two pairs of shoes, two pairs of this. You know, all this. No jewelry. No nothing.\nSo I was getting ready for July to go. Everything happened on a Friday. My mother died\non a Friday, my father died on a Friday, my brother was deported on a Friday. I came to\nEngland on a Friday. I don't know what's with Friday. The Kindertransport was on a\nFriday too. Well, anyhow, so on the day when I --",
        "Q: So -- I'm sorry to interrupt. But you said it was after you left, after he told you -- they\ntold you to leave, where did you go?",
        "A: Well, somebody took us in one night here and one night there. It was difficult. You\nknow, because it wasn't my life I was afraid. I was afraid of their life. They're going to\nget into trouble. I'm in trouble already.",
        "Q: But who were the people who were taking you in? Were they --",
        "A: Well, one of them actually was a Jewish woman with two teenage girls. Her husband\nwas also deported at the same time so he must have been Polish. So she took the two\ngirls into her bedroom and she gave us -- she rented us the girls' bedroom for a while. So\nwe paid her rent. As I said, my father put away a little money and this we took, of\ncourse. So we paid her.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: No. I don't think I ever even knew her name. All I know is the girls were teenagers.\nLike 17 and 18 or 19. And that's why they were so much older than we were. They\ncalled me a baby. I said, I'm a teenager too. But you know, 14 and 18 and 17 is not the\nsame.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, anyhow, so at least we had a roof over our head. But I hated that place. Well,\nanyhow, so when the day came for me to leave, my sister took me to the station. And this\nman, Albert Brusch, you know, the one where we stayed, the two of them took me to the\nstation. When I came to the station and I looked down the platform -- oh, my God, there\nwere so many people, children and mostly woman. There was an ocean of people crying\nand everything. Those mothers took their children to the train sending them to England\non the Kindertransport knowing that they maybe never see them again. They didn't know\nif they're going to survive or what. So I'm telling you, it was terrible. But when my sister\ncouldn't go they told her that she could make an application for domestic service. So she\nhad no choice. So she did make and we were hoping that she would be able -- somebody\nwould take her in as a maid, you know, because she had to have a visa, that was the most\nimportant thing. So anyhow. So -- but she took me to the station and I was hoping,\nhoping, she'll come soon. You know, because it was easy because the English people\nwere looking for cheap help, you know. Because they didn't pay much. It was just, like,\nroom and board and so on. But she was over 16, you know. So anyhow. So then I came\nto the station. I'm on the platform waiting for the train to come in. I haven't been back to\nschool or seen any of my roommates since last year. Since '38 I haven't been back to\nschool since my father died. And this was already July '39. All of a sudden somebody\ncomes in back of me and hugs and kisses me. And she says, oh, I'm so happy you're\ngoing to be on the same transport. This is my Fritzi. That's a girl that was in my class,\nbut not just in my class, she was eight years in my class from kindergarten on.",
        "Q: What's her name?",
        "A: Fritzi Hacker, H-a-c-a -- c-k-e-r.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Fritzi is a German name. But since kindergarten her mother used to bring her to\nschool every single day. And she used to pick her up. And every morning she always\nhad a kind word for me because she says, your mother doesn't bring you to school?\nBecause I told her my mother is bedridden and she can't get out of bed. So she was so\nsorry. So every day she always ask me, how is your mother doing? And so on, you\nknow. She was very, very nice. But I didn't know if they had any other children because\nI've never seen anybody else, only that one girl. I don't even know if she had a father or\nnot. {Undetermined interruption} It's okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So -- so when I saw her at the -- until the end, she was already 12, 13, 14 -- almost 14\nyears old. She still brought her every morning to school and picked her up every day like\na baby. So when I saw her at the station bringing her to send her to England, I thought to\nmyself how can this woman bring the girl knowing that she may never see her again that\nshe was so attached, you know. So then I said to myself, oh, my God, am I glad my\nparents are dead. I didn't have to say goodbye to them. I didn't leave anybody behind\nexcept my sister and I knew she made the application. She's going to come to England\nvery soon. And then the train came and we got in. We said goodbye.",
        "Q: To your sister and...",
        "A: Well, my sister, she made the application for domestic service. And she came, like,\nthree weeks -- she came three days before the war broke out, the last minute. But she had\na very tough time. She had to make all of the arrangements for herself. And, you know,\nlike -- not like me. All we did -- we wore a name tag to know who you are, but\neverything was arranged like the train. I went through Holland. Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember crossing the border?",
        "A: Yes. Fritzi and I, we were sitting and we were looking out the window. And on the\nother side were two little kids, maybe seven, eight years old. I didn't know them. And\nwe didn't even talk to them. We were just talking to each other. I didn't see her in a year,\nyou know, or any of my schoolmates. So anyhow. So, you know, in the city in Berlin\nthere's only, like, big buildings, cement floors. You don't see trees or grass or anything\nunless you go to the park. So as we were going, didn't take long, you're out of the city\nand you see the suburbs. And there was grass and trees, little houses. So Fritzi said to\nme, isn't it like you're going on a field trip from school and tonight we'll be back home in\nour house with parents -- with our parents? So I said to -- I thought to myself, well, she\nstill had a home to go to and a mother but I didn't. But I didn't want to make her feel bad\nso I just nodded my head. I said, uh-huh, uh-huh, like this. And then as we were going,\nall of a sudden the train stopped. I said, what happened? Looked out the window and I\nsaw the Gestapo outside. I said uh-oh. Now they're going to come and take us off the\ntrain. And I was scared like anything. But I didn't realize -- I forgot we were going\nthrough Holland. So then I realized this must be the border because they came on. It was\na border crossing. So they had to come on and look at your passport. So he says,\npassports, passports. You know, young guys in Nazi uniform. So I got up and I took my\nlittle suitcase down. So you know what he said? Forget about it. He didn't want to look.\nI could have taken anything with me. I was like -- but my sister was, like, she took\neverything. Boy, what they did to her. Well, anyhow. We crossed the border. It took\n15, 20 minutes we cross the border. I said, thank God I'm out of Germany. Now I don't\nhave to worry anymore once you're out of the country. But we were going for a while\nand all of a sudden the train stopped again. I said, what? Another border from Holland?\nWe're going straight through the channel. But when I looked up there was no Gestapo\noutside. They were Dutch women with baskets of food. I still cry when I hear about this.\nI got a tissue, you know. So they knew the children were coming so they brought us\nrefreshments. Wasn't that wonder -- perfect strangers they came on the train. Wasn't that\nsomething? I never forget this. And then we traveled to Holland until the rest of the day.\nAbout 10 o'clock we got off the train that day. And we were by the -- by the British\nchannel. And then they lined us up, make sure everybody was -- I think there were 300\nchildren on that train from the connection spot. And they said, well, I want everybody to\ngo straight to the cabin where they're assigned to. And it is 10 o'clock now -- 10 o'clock\nwe got there. The boat is not going to start going until 12. But don't wait for 12 o'clock\nbecause six o'clock in the morning if you're going to be in Harwich and you have to be\npacked and upstairs ready to go. So go right to bed. Don't wait for 12 o'clock until the\nboat leaves. And when we got on the boat, Fritzi and I, we shared a cabin. So they had a\nbunk and a top one. We had to toss a coin, which one gets the top and which one gets the\nbottom. That was so cute, you know. We were just kids. And anyhow she slept on the\ntop. And as we went to bed she kept talking. She says, are you sleeping? I said, how can\nI sleep when you're talking to me? You know, we're just talking like kids. Teenagers,\nearly teens, you know. So anyhow. So all of a sudden after a while the boat started\nrocking. Uh-oh, it must be 12 o'clock because the boat starting going. He said 12 o'clock\nit's going to start. So it must be two hours already. Better go to sleep. Six o'clock we\nhave to be upstairs. So we must have fallen asleep or something. And then in the\nmorning we got up and we were in Harwich. And from there we took a train to London.\nIt took two hours. And then when we got to London there was, like, a big room, a little\nbigger than this maybe. A little wider. And there was, like, a bench here and a bench\nthere and there. And we were sitting on those benches and some people came and they\ncalled out names. You go with this person. You go with -- nobody knew where they\nwere going. I had no address and I still like to look for this girl. I wish I knew if she's\nalive, if she's in England or some place else. I never saw her since that day. Because I\ndidn't know where I was going and she didn't know where she was going.",
        "Q: And you never -- never saw her?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Never could find her?",
        "A: No. No. That's a shame. I didn't -- I have -- contact --",
        "Q: Like you don't want to talk about it --",
        "A: Anyhow I came to England on a Friday. And -- and that week I came to a couple, an\nelderly couple, I mean, old enough to be my parents. They had married children and\ngrandchildren. And I met the family over the weekend.",
        "Q: Was it in London?",
        "A: In London, yeah. I met the family over -- they had a married son, two or three kids;\nand a married daughter with some children. And then the youngest daughter was, like, in\nher 20s. And she was -- I didn't even know at the time she was expecting her first baby.\nBut it wasn't hardly to see. And at that time I didn't even know where the babies came\nfrom. Now, I do. Anyhow. So -- so on the weekend I met them and then on -- she says\nto me, well, what are you going to do with yourself? You know, it was July. The schools\nwere Closed. So she said, well, when the schools open in September, we going to register\nyou for school. So in the meantime what are you going to do with yourself? And they\nhad their own -- like, a little factory. They were making civilian trousers for men. So\nMonday morning the younger daughter that was working 1n that place for her father, you\nknow, there were a few people there. They were, like, a few men and one woman. They\nwere in their 50s or 60s, you know. Like, four or five men and one woman was right on\nthe corner. She was, like, 64. They were very nice to me. But they spoke Yiddish. I\ncouldn't speak any English. So they spoke Yiddish to me. I understood but I didn't speak\nit that good. But it's very similar to German. So I knew what they were saying. So she\nintroduced me to everybody and she showed me what to do. How to use this machine\nand this machine. A few machines she taught me at my age, you know. I never worked.\nI had to sew the buttons with the machine. And if you don't put it exactly in and the\nneedle went next to the hole, you break the needles. I must have broke a dozen needles.\nIt was very hard to get it the right way. And she was so fast because she's been used to it,\nyou know. And then there was another machine that made the hems and another machine\nfor the buttonholes. I had to work all three machines, and make tea twice a day for\neverybody who was there. I still hate teA: It reminds me. So anyhow I was working with\nher and she used to take me there in the morning. I think we went by bus. And then I\ncame home in the evening. And before I had dinner she used to say to me -- there was\nonly her and her husband living there -- she said, while the dinner 1s -- while you're\nwaiting you can wash this floor. She made me do the housework before -- after a whole\nday in the factory. Well, anyhow -- but then this was going on for quite a few months.\nSeptember came around. I forgot about it school. You know, and nobody mentioned a\nword. And I was just working, working every day. But then she was getting ready to\nhave her baby. And her name was Fannie. And so she says, well -- when she couldn't go\nto work anymore I was on my own. And then all the work what the two of us did I had to\ndo myself. So instead of going at nine o'clock in the morning I had to go eight o'clock\nand seven o'clock. And instead of staying until five or six, I used to stay until seven,\neight o'clock. Five days, six days, seven days a week, I couldn't keep up. And I don't\nknow what happened. One day I remember I was going to the bus and the bus ride was\ntuppence. Know anything about English money? Tuppence is like 20 cents. So she used\nto give me the tuppence. But then she found out they have -- what is this -- you know, if\nyou come until 7:30 -- before 7:30 in the morning you get a return ticket. So if you give\nthem tuppence and a half, Ha'penny, you get a ticket to go back at night. So she says,\nmake sure you get the bus before 7:30. And she gave me tuppence and a half, the\nHa'penny. And that's all the money I had. I never had pocket money or wages or\nanything, only food and sleep, lodging. So I tried to get the bus -- every time I came to\nthe bus, there was a line from here to God knows where. All these big guys waiting for\nthe bus. They probably had families to support. They saw me, they said, that kid's\nprobably working for pocket money and they used to push me on the side and get on the\nbus. And I tried to get on the bus but I couldn't push those guys away. I was trying to get\nvery hard. If I was lucky I got on it and I had my ticket to go back home. But I\nremember one day I tried so hard and they pushed me on the side. And -- there be\nanother bus in a minute. Half a minute later the bus came, no more return. What I'm\ngoing to do? I had to give them the tuppence and I had a Ha'penny left. I came to the\nplace and I was crying. So the woman that was working, the one woman, she says to me,\nwhat's the matter, Puppala? Puppala means little doll. Why are you crying? So I said, I\nmissed the return bus this morning. So she said, big deal. So you're five minutes late? I\nsaid, no, no, no, no, no. It's not I'm late, I have no money to go back home. She said,\nwhat it is tuppence? Big deal. Here's tuppence. And I made a Ha'penny that day. That's\nthe first money I ever had of my own. Isn't that something? I cried because I didn't make\nthe return bus. But I didn't tell her that.",
        "Q: So you were living with her too?",
        "A: I was living -- no, not the woman that worked there.",
        "Q: Or with the family?",
        "A: She was home. She didn't work there.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: There was people working for them. Well, anyhow. And then another day I was\nstanding in line again waiting for the bus. I mean, every morning I was standing in line\nwaiting for the bus. I tried to get on this as much as I could. But I don't know what\nhappened that morning. All of a sudden I remember standing in line waiting for the bus,\nbut I have no idea what happened. All of a sudden I wake up, I'm in the hospital. I have\nknow idea how I got there.",
        "Q: And what happened?",
        "A: And I'm laying on the bed or stretcher and the young doctor bending over me and\ntalking to me. I couldn't understand a word he was saying because I didn't go to school.\nNobody spoke English to me. I was already, like, a half a year in England. If I go to\nschool I would have spoken -- or people speak to you I would know a little English, but\nnobody spoke English to me. I didn't go to school so I didn't know any English. And he\nwas talking and talking. I didn't know what he was saying. So he didn't know what to do\nwith me. Couldn't even tell me how I feel, why I -- I don't know what happened. I didn't\neven remember fainting or anything. All I remember is -- was I was hot. It was just\nbefore Christmas. This I remember because Father Christmas came. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.\nThat's how I remember what time of the year it was. So he didn't know what to do with\nme so they put me in a big room like a ward with about eight or 10 people, woman, there\nall the way in the corner on one bed and they called somebody from the Bloomsbury\nHouse. That's the organization that was responsible for the children, Kindertransport\nchildren. So after a while a Ms. Feldman came to me see me and she spoke to me in\nGerman. And she says to me, how come you don't speak any English? You're here\nalready a long time. I mean, half a year 1s a long time to learn English, right? At least a\nfew words. So I said, nobody speaks English to me, how can I learn? So she said, well,\ndon't you go to school? I said, oh, my God, school. I forgot what school 1s such a long\ntime. Like, a year and a half I haven't been in school. So she says, what are you doing\nwith yourself all day long if you don't go to school? So I said, well, I work in the factory.\nShe says, well, do you have a permit? I said, what's that? I don't know what a permit is.\nSo she said, well, whenever we came we check up on our children and whenever we\ncame to your house the lady always said, she's in school. And when they came on the\nweekend I was never there. She's out with a friend. They probably went to a movie or\nsomething. Because I was never there whenever they came to check up on me. So they\nwouldn't let me go back. And they had no place where to send me. So I had to stay in\nthe hospital until they found a place for me.",
        "Q: How long was that?",
        "A: I know it was after Christmas because I know he came -- you know, Santa Clause\ncame. They call him Father Christmas. And they gave every woman a bed jacket. All\ndifferent colors. And he came to me he says, oh, you're the youngest one here. You're so\npure so I'm giving you a white one so to put on the shoulder. You know, to put on your\narms because they don't have heat there. Not at this time anyhow. So it's like to put on\nthe bed when you sit up in bed, you know.\nSo there was nothing wrong with me. I must have just had a little cold or something. I\nhave -- maybe somebody put -- I have no idea what happened. How I was -- how I end\nup in the hospital.",
        "Q: Yeah, well, you probably were exhausted.",
        "A: I don't even remember -- I don't remember falling or fainting or anything. But they\nmust have picked me up and take me. I don't remember it. All I remember I'm opening\nup my eyes and that doctor is standing over me and talking to me and I didn't know what\nhe was talking about. But I know I was hot.",
        "Q: So what happened then when --",
        "A: Well, then she says to me, well, we don't have anybody that can take you unless you\nwant to go to a hostile. I said, I don't know what a hostile 1s. And I don't -- I was just\nscared. I was afraid to go anywhere because the way I felt already. I was afraid of\neverybody. So do you have anybody here? I said, all I know is I have a sister here but I\ndon't even know where she is. She -- she's working for somebody. She same here on\ndomestic service. And you know when they --",
        "Q: How did you hear that she arrived?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: How did you hear -- how did you learn that she arrived in England? Were you --",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I know when she arrived, she wrote to me.",
        "Q: Oh, you were --",
        "A: So I saw her but she had to go to the people that vouch for her. And one weekend I\neven went to visit her for one night.",
        "Q: Where -- where was it?",
        "A: It was far away. It took a couple of hours to get there. But that one weekend when I\ndid go, I went on a Saturday afternoon and I came back Sunday in the evening. That was\nprobably before I worked day and night, you know.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And the daughter was still working there at the beginning because she came -- the\nvery last day of August '39. Just three days before the war broke out. So the daughter\nwas still working with me. So I went on a Saturday afternoon. So before I went on that\nbus, I had to go to the police station and get a special permit to spend one night at a\ndifferent address because I was considered an enemy alien.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: So -- so that's all. So I had the permit and I went there and I got there Saturday in the\nevening late. And I slept over in her room and then Sunday afternoon. But that's the\nonly time I saw her. And when she came, we picked her up from the station. So I saw --",
        "Q: Oh, you did?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Who went with you to pick her up?",
        "A: I guess the lady must have. I said, my sister is coming. Well, anyhow -- so -- but she\nhad --",
        "Q: So what was the lady's name? Sorry.",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But -- so my sister had to go right away there. But the people vouch for her and they\nwere waiting for her. So that one night I spent one weekend there. And then the war\nbroke out soon after this, three days later. But at the beginning you heard bombings and -\n- but it wasn't too bad. But later on it got very bad. Bombs were coming down one after\nthe other. You heard about the Blitz of London?",
        "Q: Yes. Sure.",
        "A: It was real bad. So all of the children were evacuated to the country. Because in\nLondon it was bad because there were factories and they tried to bomb all these things.\nAnd I lived in London. But the people my sister was staying with -- I don't know if they\nhad a place in the country or they rented, I don't know. But they couldn't take the bombs\ngoing every night to the shelter. Because I didn't even know what it was like to sleep in a\nbed anymore. For three years, four years, you know, I haven't slept in the bed. So they\nwent to the country and they took her along. So I -- then I couldn't see her at all\nanymore. So I -- I don't know if I knew any of this but I told this Ms. Feldman and they\nmust have made the arrangements. So anyhow. So my sister wrote a letter to me to the\nhospital. And they wouldn't let me out of the hospital. And Ms. Feldman said, the only\nway we can release her is if a person that's already of age. Well, she was old already.\nShe was -- what is age? 17? 18?",
        "Q: 18.",
        "A: 18. So maybe she's must have been, yeah, she must have been 18. So she says, well,\nhow can I come to London and stay with you? See, first of all, the bombs and all this is\nbad, but I have no choice you're there too. I was sleeping with the bombs every night.\nBut what am I going to do? I have no occupation. The only thing I know 1s cleaning\nhouses. That's the only thing I know. That's what she came there for. Domestic service.\nSo I said, but I know how to work. I work all three machines, four machines, and I know\n-- and I can do -- so she says, but how am I going to make a living? I said, don't worry. I\nknow how to work. I'll teach you. So that's the only way they'll let me out. So she had to\ncome to London. Take a risk being in London under the Blitz instead of being safe in the\ncountry. And so we rented a room and Ms. Feldman helped us a lot. She says, as long as\nyou're in this country you're my child no matter how old you are. So -- but my sister from\nworking all this -- they didn't have mops. She had to go on her knees and clean the floor.\nHer knees were all swollen, full of pus.",
        "Q: Oh, no.",
        "A: She was in terrible shape. A young girl, you know. But we rented a room. I think it\nwas, like, five shilling. It was very cheap. And she got us a job in a war factory to do\nsomething, something with machines. And I had to show her how to work. And we\nmade a living. And, you know, the room was very cheap. It wasn't much of a room. You\ncome up the stairs. There's was one little room. There was a little bed in there, and on\nthe landing was a sink about that size, and a little gas ring. That was our kitchen. And\nthe bathroom was an outhouse in the back.",
        "Q: Well, it still had a roof --",
        "A: Yeah, I had a roof over my head. So we worked and we supported ourselves. So\nthat's about it. But at least I was with my sister. And, eventually, we picked up, you\nknow -- when you work, you work with English people. I hear them talking. I never\neven heard -- we had no television at that time. Didn't have time to watch it anyhow, I\nwas never home. And so I picked up -- it was easier to listen than to speak. I was afraid\nto open my mouth in case it doesn't come out right. But I could understand already when\nthey were talking to me. There was an English lady sitting right next to me, she was\nabout 45 years old. Because it was an old lady to me, you know, I was still a teenager.\nAnd she was very nice and she helped me a lot explaining me what to do and this is this\nand this is that. She spoke to me English, you know. She didn't know German. And one\nday she came in and she said, oh, we had a lot of bombs last night. And they got bombed\nout the whole house went down. She was living with her elderly parents. And I said,\nwhere are you going to live now? So she says, well, they have the prefabricated houses.\nThey put them up in one day. I said, really? You know, she was very nice. English lady.\nAnd so she says, I'll take you to my house and introduce you to my parents. And she\ntook me over there and they had a beautiful living room, a kitchen, two bedrooms, and a\nbathroom. It was gorgeous. One day they put up prefabricated house. I said, it's a lot\nnicer than mine. But I wasn't jealous. I was happy. I had a roof over my head.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. It was tough. But God was with me all the time. When they came to the\nshelter they gave out little cards and I still have it in my pocketbook. I keep it with me all\nthe time. It's a little card that said, God is your refuge. Don't be afraid. He'll be with you\nall through the raid. When bombs are dropping and danger is near, He'll be with you\nuntil the all clear. And I still have it in my pocketbook. I take it with me wherever I go.",
        "Q: And did it help?",
        "A: And He was with me. Because one night I came home from the -- from work. I was\nso tired. We had to be there at 7:30 in the morning and we worked until 6:30 at night.",

        "A: My brother?",
        "A: My brother's name was Alan Baer Costinski. He want that last name. And he was\nborn in Larch, Poland. And he came with my mother just shortly before the -- the first\nWorld War to Germany.",
        "A: Yeah. Because my father was a prisoner in a German prison camp. And she knew\nabout it. She walked all the way from -- but the Germans came and they took everything\naway and there was nothing left. She had two more children younger than the one that I\nknew, and that's a boy and girl, but they both died, I really don't know how. But the\nGermans came in and they -- that's the first World War.",
        "A: And they destroyed everything and there was nothing left for her. So when she only\nhad that one little boy left, she took him and she walked all night. And during the day,\nshe stopped over somewhere on a farm, and only nights she walked until she -- by the\ntime she reached the border from Poland to Germany, the war was practically over and\nshe just walked across. And she went to the prison camp where my father was and they\ngot together. And there was nothing to go back to to Poland. So they stayed in Germany.\nBut then later on after they got a little established, my sister was born in 1921 and I was\nborn in 1923.",
        "A: IdA:",
        "A: Well, after the war it wasn't bad. We were free. But unfortunate -- which had nothing\nto do with Hitler -- when I was only three years old, my mother fell down a flight of stairs\nand she never recovered. It wasn't anybody's fault. It was her own fault. She should\nhave gone into the hospital and be in a cast. But she said, I have small children and I\ncan't afford to go into a cast and she neglected herself, which had nothing to do with\nHitler or anything. He wasn't even there yet. And, of course, after a while instead of\ngetting better, she got worse. And she's been in and out of hospitals since I remember.\nSo I was only three so I barely remember my mother. And by the time I started school\nthere was talk about Hitler being the new chancellor of Germany. So my father said,\nwell, I think we're going to put the girls right away in a Jewish school. Because my\nbrother went to a German school.",
        "A: When he first came to Germany he couldn't speak the language, but it was different.\nBut when he heard about Hitler being so much against Jews, he says, I'm not going to put\nthe girls in the Jew -- in the German school. So we went right away into a Jewish school.",
        "A: From the time we started kindergarten.",
        "A: Well, we learned German and we learned Hebrew --",
        "A: -- in the school. We had every morning one hour of Hebrew from Monday to Friday\nfive days a week and then it was from eight to nine. And nine o'clock we had regular\nsubjects, German, arithmetic, geography, history, you know --",
        "A: -- regular subjects. But it was only for Jewish children.",
        "A: Well, not really because mostly after school you go to somebody's house. But as I did\nnot really have a home to go -- I mean, I had a home but there was nobody there --",
        "A: -- because my mother was in and out of the hospital. My father was busy and I had to\nmake a living so we had to go to day care. So straight from school we went into day care\nand we were there until six o'clock at night.",
        "A: By that time my father was home -- and so I --",
        "A: No, it was Jewish.",
        "A: It was a Jewish day care, yes. We had sort of a hot meal during the day so at night\nwasn't much of a meal just, like, a sandwich or something.",
        "A: Well, as I said he was in the Army when he -- before he came to Germany. So he\ndidn't really have a profession. So the -- at first, he did whatever he could just to make a\nliving for us. But then he opened up a little tobacco store. And those days everybody\nsmoked and it was a good business. He was doing -- I mean, we were not rich, but he\nmade a living. We had enough to pay rent. There was always food on the table and he\nwas doing all right.",
        "A: Yes. By the time I started school it was practically -- as a matter of fact, they used to\nput on the radio in the schools and we had to listen to his speech.",
        "A: In the Jewish school.",
        "A: Yeah. So his voice...",
        "A: You mean in the street? Well, at the beginning in the early '30s it wasn't bad.\nEverybody was very nice to us. And as a matter of fact, we lived in an apartment\nbuilding. It was a walker. And as you come up the stairs there were two apartments on\neach floor. Here was our apartment and this was a -- German people. And there was\nonly one wall between our living room and their living room and you could hear\npractically -- when they walked or every word they said, you know, like the next room.\nAnd we had no problem. I don't even know if there were other Jewish people in this\napartment building. There were four floors, something like that. But because I wasn't\nhome all day. I just left 7:30 in the morning to go to school. I came home late at night. I\nnever saw anybody. But the lady that lived right next door to us on the same floor, my\nfather used to go early in the morning, like, six o'clock and that -- those days we didn't\nhave refrigeration -- and used to go down and buy some groceries. I don't know if every\nday. Depends on the weather how long you can keep it. And every time used to come\nout early in the morning and the lady came out. She used to say, good morning to you.\nHow are you how? How 1s your wife doing? Because she knew she was sick. Once --\nso sorry. You got small children and with a sick mother. And they were friendly people.",
        "A: Oh, I can't remember the name.",
        "A: I know there was only a lady and a young boy was there.",
        "A: I don't know. He was like a teenager later on. And as we (?certain?) were so many\nyears. But then in 1936 my mother passed away. And, you know, I wouldn't even know\nit but -- you know what a Minyan 1s?",
        "A: You have a ShivA:",
        "A: Yeah. Or when somebody passes away for one week we have mourning.",
        "A: Which they call a ShivA: People come in the morning for service and they used to\ncome in the evening. Twice we have the Minyan. Minyan means you have to have at\nleast 10 people.",
        "A: 10 men to make the service. So in '36 it wasn't bad. My father belonged to the\nsynagogue, people used to come. We're not allowed to go out for one week and people\nbring you food to the house. So we were in that whole week. We didn't go anywhere.\nBut the next -- the following Sunday -- my mother died on a Friday in July of '36. So on\nSunday was the funeral. So the following Sunday when we finished the Shiva, my father\nwas going downstairs to buy groceries for following week or days. So the minute he got\ninto the store the lady jumped on him. She says, I know your wife died more than a week\nago and you did not turn in her ration cards. That's how I remember we must have been\non ration. '36. That was three years before the war. And if you ask me, I wouldn't even\nknow we were on ration. Just because he came up and he told us the story. So he says, I\nbeg your pardon. I was in mourning. We don't go out for one week. And I came down\nthis morning to turn her in ration card and buy my groceries. So she calmed down.\nBecause 1n '36 it wasn't too bad.",
        "A: You could still talk to a Jewish person. But when we went to the park all the benches\nhad written on, not for Jews. You couldn't sit on. But there were only three benches in\nthat whole big park, huge park, only for Jews. But nobody ever sat on those three\nbenches. I remember that because some time on a Saturday --",
        "A: We were just kids, you know. But like on the Saturday or Sunday when we didn't go\nto school or day care we use to say, oh, Papa, can we go to the park? You know, but he\nworked hard all week. He had to get up early. And he said, oh, I'm so tired. So in the\nwinter, of course, he used to go sleep in the afternoon. But in the summer, you know, he\ntried to be nice. I mean, I didn't realize, you know, we had no mother most of the time,\nand he was mother and father. But when you're a child, you don't realize that it's a double\njob for him. So he tried to be nice and he took us to the park as much as he could. And I\nremember one day we were in the park, we were playing something like hopscotch on the\nfloor, my sister and I. And he sat down on the bench and it said, not for Jews. But he\nhad covered the writing.",
        "A: And he figures, well -- but he did not look Jewish because he had light eyes. He had\ngray hair since I remember. So he must have been on the light side. And then a man, a\nGerman man, came and sat down next to him on the bench. And he was watching us\nplaying and he tried to make a conversation with my father. He didn't know who he was.\nSo he says, you know, I feel sorry for those children. Isn't it terrible what they're doing to\nthem? At that time -- so my father just sat and he nodded. He didn't say anything. So we\njust came over and we said, oh, Papa, something -- when he heard us calling him papa,\nwhich means father, he realized that he was our father. And he got up and he flew away\nlike they were chasing him. In case they catch him talking to him, they'll arrest him.\nThat's how bad it was.",
        "A: No. Yeah, '36 it wasn't too bad. But Hitler was in power since '33.",
        "A: And '36 it was already -- you know --",
        "A: It was hard to walk in the street.",
        "A: Yeah. Little by little it got worse and worse. But then later on the lady came up. Did\nI say this already? And she said, how is your wife and all this? And then she says, well,\nyou have to excuse me, I wouldn't able to say good morning to you anymore.",
        "A: Because my son is now in the Hitler Youths. 16-year-old boy. And if he sees me\ntalking to you, he'll report me. I'm talking to a Jew.",
        "A: 16 years old. She was afraid of him. Right next door. We were living next door to\neach other for years. She says, I have nothing against you personal. We've been living\ntogether for a long time. We've been -- you've been a good neighbor. It's nothing. So\nmy father just said, I understand. He knew. It wasn't her fault. She's a very nice lady.\nI don't know if there was a man there because he only was talking about her and the son.",
        "A: So I have no idea if there was a father there or not.",
        "A: I don't too well. But my father used to see her very often. She probably went out the\nsame time when he used to go out in the morning.",
        "A: Maybe she had to go to work or something, you know. But there was nothing\npersonal. She was very nice. We lived together for years, you know. People lived next\ndoor, they have problems, too much noise, fighting. You know, we never had a problem.",
        "A: But then, of course, in 1938 all of a sudden -- as soon as my mother died he start\ngetting sick. But he just was losing his voice. So he went to the doctor a few times. Was\ntreating him for a cough -- cough medicine. And we had no ideA: Finally, we found out\nthat it was more than a cough, he had throat cancer. And --",
        "A: -- he suffered for two years. And to the day same July two years later he passed away.",
        "A: 14.",
        "A: Yeah. I was 12 when my mother died. I was only three when she got sick. She was\nbedridden for nine years. See -- which had nothing to do with Hitler.",
        "A: It a different story. It's just my story.",
        "A: Yeah. But then in '38 it was already very bad. But while my father was still alive he\nwas trying so hard to get us out. He kept writing letters and letters to family he had in\nNew York. And he says, it's getting very bad here. I don't care for myself, I'm an old\nman. He was in his 50s. He thought he was old. But the children, please, try to do\nsomething for the children. So you know what they wrote him back, if you need a few\ndollars, I'll send it to you.",
        "A: Yeah, relatives.",
        "A: In New York.",
        "A: Well, unfortunately, my father lost his mother giving -- she was giving birth to him.\nShe died in childbirth. And those brothers and sister were from second wife. So they\nwere half brothers and sisters.",
        "A: But he wrote to the sister and he said --",
        "A: Oh, no, please.",
        "A: I don't want to in case somebody's alive, I don't want to say it. But -- {laughter} but\nshe says -- he says, I don't want any money. I need a visA: Please take the children out.\nThings are very, very bad here. Never answered. And it was -- but in '36 and '38, the\ntwo years -- he was sick for two years. For -- as soon as she died he start getting sick.\n'38 he died. They both died in July and both on a Friday. Isn't that something?",
        "A: Friday is such a day for me. Well, anyhow so --",
        "A: Yes, we were left orphans. That was in July of '38. But as I said, my brother was a lot\nolder than me because he was born in Poland. There were two more children after him.",
        "A: There must have been, like, two or three years old, or four something. A little boy and\na little girl but he was the oldest one. So that's why he's so much older than we --",
        "A: Well, he was 10 years older than my sister.",
        "A: And 12 years older than me. Because, as I said, when they were in Poland, like, he\nwas six years old and the little one probably was two and four. So by the time he came to\nGermany must have been seven, almost eight.",
        "A: Yeah. But then they took a few years before my sister and I were born because you\njust can't have children.",
        "A: You got to get established, you got to get a place to live, you know. It was just -- it\nwas in the war. He was a prisoner, you know. So, you know, he had to wait until he\nmakes a little money to get an apartment. And then my sister and I were born in the early\n'20s. So my brother was really quite a bit older, 10 years older.",
        "A: My brother?",
        "A: Yeah, he was working.",
        "A: Well, he was working by machine, like, tailoring because he didn't have -- he couldn't\ngo to higher education, you know. And so he had to do whatever to make a living. And\nmy father had the tobacco store. And around Christmastime they used to have -- I don't if\nthey're called -- what you call it here it -- like a Christmas market.",
        "A: Yeah, they had -- they opened up tables and --",
        "A: -- sell things a few weeks -- like, a month before Christmas. So after school he used\nto take merchandise from our father's store, opened a table, put up cigarettes and cigars\nand tobacco. And they would sell. You're -- because it was so cold, Christmastime, and\nthey saw a young kid, 12, 14 years old and they used to buy from him and he make more\nmoney than my father made in the store. He was jealous on him. He was a good brother\nand a good son. And, of course, after my father died 1t was very hard. We couldn't even\nget a Minyan to go to for the funeral. We went to the cemetery when we buried our\nfather. And my father was collecting people and paying them so we could have 10\npeople for the funeral for the service. Isn't that terrible?",
        "A: Because there was not many Jews left and -- from the congregation I'm talking, you\nknow. And there were very few and it was very hard. It was bad already. We wouldn't\nwalk in the street. They used to throw rocks at us. And even going to school.",
        "A: Not at that time. It started after -- after I already came to England. So it was -- but\nthey used to throw -- especially in the winter. They used to take a rock and put the snow\non it, like, a snowball. And they used to throw that. It was so painful.",
        "A: Kids. Yeah. Teenage. They used to throw the rocks. It was so painful. I was afraid\nto go -- we walked to school. We had no transportation. So I was really afraid to go to\nschool. And after my father died, you know, my brother even tried very hard. And, you\nknow, he felt like a young father to us. He was so much older. He was responsible.",
        "A: He was trying to make a living for us. Well, thank God my father put away a few\ndollars. We didn't have it in the bank. So just a couple months later -- well, he died in\nJuly, this was August, September, October. Three months later. October 28, to be the\nexact date. Early in the morning, about 7:30 in the morning on a Friday, Friday morning,\nthe doorbell rang. A policeman was outside. I was afraid to open the door. And my\nbrother was just getting ready to go to the synagogue for the Minyan, you know, to say\nKaddish for my father. He said a whole year Kaddish first for my mother. Now, he\nstopped a little. Now, he had to say it for my father. So he was just getting ready to go to\nsay Kaddish for my father. And when the doorbell rang, he came out. He was still in\npajamas. I looked through the peephole. He says, who's at the door? I said, it's a\npoliceman. He says, open the door. We didn't do anything. Why are you afraid?\nI was afraid to open the door. He went over, opened the door, and the policeman says,\nHerr Costinski? You know, his name. And he says, yes, it's me. So he says, better come\nand see -- please come with me. So he says, wait a minute. What did I do? He said, oh,\nI know you didn't do anything. But we just want to take you to the police headquarters\nask you some questions. Then he looked at us two, my sister and me, kids. He says, oh,\nhe'll be back soon. So he said, would you mind if I get dressed first? He was in pajamas.\nTo him he didn't care what he wore. They wore pajamas anyhow in the camp. So he\nsays, all right. But make it snappy. Leave the door open. Watched him getting dressed.\nSo, you know, if you're in a hurry, you don't look what you're going to wear. Whatever\nwas there you put on. A pair of pants and a top. By the first October 28th, 1938, the day\nof the deportation and it was cold. But you figure he'll be back in a couple of hours. So\nhe didn't put a sweater or a jacket or anything. Just a shirt and pants. And he took him. I\nwent through the front room and I saw a truck down there and I saw him sitting right in\nthe corner. He said he'll be back soon, right? That's the last time I ever saw him. I never\nsaw him after that day. I never forget this day. We waited and waiting the whole\nweekend.",
        "A: But it was Friday morning. We waited Saturday and Sunday. He never came back. I\nnever went back to school either, not since that day. I never saw any of my schoolmates\nor teachers. Anybody.\nMonday morning was the first of November and the doorbell rang. When I saw the agent\nfrom the landlord outside, I wasn't afraid to open the door because I've known him since I\nwas a little girl. So I open the door and I said, oh, good morning. You came for the rent.\nI'll go and get it. First of the month. Every first of the month -- we didn't pay checks that\ntime. We used to pay cash. My father always taught me, every week you put a quarter of\nthe rent away. So when the month comes, rent is the most important thing. Even if you\nhave nothing else, no money, you got to have a roof over your head. So when I turn --\noh, you came for the rent. I'll go and get it. He said. No, no, no, no, no. I didn't come\nfor the rent. I came to ask you two girls to leave this apartment at once. I said, why?\nWe're paid up. We don't owe anything. So he said, oh, I know you don't know anything\nbut you're both minors and you cannot occupy this place. So I said, but my brother is not\na minor. He was older than us. And since our father died it was put on his name. So he\nsaid, but you brother isn't here. I said, he's only been gone two days. He'll be back. Oh,\nno. Your brother was deported and he will never come back.",
        "A: And he knew us for years since we are little girl. While I was talking to him my sister\nwent to get the money and she came out with cash from the other room, and when he saw\nall that money in her hand he took the whole month's rent. And then -- I mean, he knew\nus for so many years since we were little. All of a sudden, you know, he was really\nfollowing orders. But he didn't want to do it, but he had no choice. So he said, okay.\nOkay. I'll let you say a little longer. And he took the whole month's rent. But that week\nwas Kristallnacht.",
        "A: November.",
        "A: We heard on the radio that they deported all of the Jewish men from 16 to 60 from\nBerlin. And from -- as it's smallest towns, women and children also. But from Berlin\nitself it was men and boys from 16 to 60. So he was over 16. And, you know, they came\nfor my father too a little later because he was under 60. He was in his 50s so they came\nfor him too. And he was already dead. It didn't go in yet --",
        "A: -- you know. So I said, you can't have him anymore, he's gone. Okay. They didn't\ncare. But they would have deported him too. See, and we were alone.",
        "A: Yeah. She was 16. Still young.",
        "A: We looked around the apartment and, you know, there were five of us living here now\nthere's only two left. What do you take and where do you go? We had no place to go.\nWe didn't know what to take. Shall we take clothes? Shall we take dishes? Linens?\nWhat do you take? You know, we had no place to go. So my sister just look a few\npictures that she can still put in her pocket, you know, little pictures, old pictures from\nmy parents and the little one. One of the babies that died, we had a picture. He has them\nof us on it so I don't know if he came before or after. And she took my mother's wedding\nring and I think a necklace with, like, a watch on it. She took a few things. That's not\nmuch. A small suitcase we took. Change of clothing. And that's all. What could we\ntake? We had furniture. We had dishes. Linens. We had my mother's trousseau. Every\nsingle -- there was her name engraved. We had to leave everything behind.",
        "A: We had no place to go. We were out in the street. But then we met somebody that\nknew my father but I didn't even know the man that well. It was a German Jew but he\nwas married to a Gentile German lady.",
        "A: Yes. Albert Brusch and her name was Herta or BerthA: I don't know. But anyhow --\nbut he lived way across town. We were northeast in Berlin and he was, like, on the east\nside. You had to take one or two trains to go there. So he met us and he said, what you\ntwo girls doing in this cold weather out in the street with the suitcase? So I said, they\nthrew us out from the apartment. He said, I know your mother was sick and she passed\naway. What happened to your dad? I said, he died just a few months ago. Well, didn't\nyou have an older brother? I said, yeah, but they took him away. He said, oh, my God.\nHe says, no wonder my hair is gray. He was 64 years old. So he says, what 1s this\ncountry coming to? He was a German Jew but he did not practice Judaism. He was just\na German citizen. He fought in the first World War in the German Army. And he was,\nlike, a real German citizen.",
        "A: But he still considered a Jew by the Nazis. No matter how many generations. So he\nsaid, well, I have only a one-bedroom apartment, but if you want to sleep in the bathroom\nyou're welcome. I said, thank you. Thank you. So he took us to his house and my sister\nslept in the bathtub and he put up a folding bed next to the bathtub and I slept on this.\nAnd his wife was so wonderful. She welcomed us with open arms. She said, I'm so sorry\nwhat this is coming to. She didn't approve, but she had no choice. And she cooked for\nus. First time we had a hot meal and actually a bed to sleep in, if you call it a bed.",
        "A: But was a roof over your head, like my father said.",
        "A: It was cold. It was very dangerous until that man took us. Well, anyhow, we were\nthere for a while and she was very nice to us. She says, oh, my God, you girls have no\nclothes to wear. Would you believe she took me to a store and bought me clothes and my\nsister? She said, I'm so sorry. And he said, I would love to adopt you two. We have no\nchildren. I would love to have adopt you both, but there's no future for you here. She\nwas so wonderful to us.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, they had acar. In those days very few people had a car. He had a little\nbusiness. And, yeah, I mean, I'm not saying how rich they were but they had an\napartment, one bedroom, a living room, dining room, you know. They were not poor, but\nI wouldn't say they were rich, but they were comfortable. And -- but before we turned\naround it was December and it was Christmas and the doorbell rang. When she opened\nthe door her brother was there in an SS uniform, younger brother. So he wanted to spend\nChristmas Eve with them. He was probably stationed nearby and he needed a place to\nspend the evening. So they went into the dining room and he was -- she says, quickly,\nquick go to the bathroom. Lock the door. Don't make a light. Don't even breathe. She\nwas so afraid of him. So he went in and he was drinking and drinking and singing all the\nGerman songs. Oh salute, you know. And he must have been so drunk. He was\nsinging. I could hear it. I was so scared in that bathroom with my sister. It was so dark.\nWe couldn't see each other even. And I said, isn't he ever going to leave? Finally, he\nsaid, okay. Okay -- in German, of course, he's going. I said, thank God. All of a sudden\nhe said, okay. Okay. One more for the road. And back to the another drink, another\ndrink. She wanted to get rid of him already. Finally, he left. She knocked on the door of\nthe bathroom. She said, okay. Girls, you can come out now. We opened the door, we\ncouldn't see a thing because we had been so many hours in the dark. No window, no\nlight. I felt like blinded until I could open my eyes. So she says, I'm so sorry. I don't\nknow if I can keep you any longer. My brother could come anytime unexpected. I mean,\nI understood this, but what could I do? Again, we were on the go. But he said, don't\nworry. I made an application for both of you for the Kindertransport. He says that I\nheard that England opened up visas. He told us this at the beginning when we first came.\nI forgot about this. So he says, England opened up visas for 10,000 children up to 16.\nAnd I was 14 and my sister was 16. 16 she could still go. So he says, and I'm sure you\nwill both qualify, you're orphans, you're homeless, they should take you first, right? But\nanyhow from the time he made the application and he says -- well, when we had to leave\nthere he didn't throw us out, but we had to go. What about if her brother comes back and\nsees us there? So, again, we had to go. Whoever took us in. So then he says, well, I'm\nsure it will soon come through. You'll be going to England very soon. Wouldn't take\nlong. But do you know how long it took? Nine months. Next year we first had the apply\n-- the letter in July. I can go to England but my sister's birthday was in May. She was\ntwo months too old. If you would have gotten it in May she could go. But she was two\nmonths too old. They came in July and they gave you a whole list what I could take.\nOnly two pairs of shoes, two pairs of this. You know, all this. No jewelry. No nothing.\nSo I was getting ready for July to go. Everything happened on a Friday. My mother died\non a Friday, my father died on a Friday, my brother was deported on a Friday. I came to\nEngland on a Friday. I don't know what's with Friday. The Kindertransport was on a\nFriday too. Well, anyhow, so on the day when I --",
        "A: Well, somebody took us in one night here and one night there. It was difficult. You\nknow, because it wasn't my life I was afraid. I was afraid of their life. They're going to\nget into trouble. I'm in trouble already.",
        "A: Well, one of them actually was a Jewish woman with two teenage girls. Her husband\nwas also deported at the same time so he must have been Polish. So she took the two\ngirls into her bedroom and she gave us -- she rented us the girls' bedroom for a while. So\nwe paid her rent. As I said, my father put away a little money and this we took, of\ncourse. So we paid her.",
        "A: No. I don't think I ever even knew her name. All I know is the girls were teenagers.\nLike 17 and 18 or 19. And that's why they were so much older than we were. They\ncalled me a baby. I said, I'm a teenager too. But you know, 14 and 18 and 17 is not the\nsame.",
        "A: Well, anyhow, so at least we had a roof over our head. But I hated that place. Well,\nanyhow, so when the day came for me to leave, my sister took me to the station. And this\nman, Albert Brusch, you know, the one where we stayed, the two of them took me to the\nstation. When I came to the station and I looked down the platform -- oh, my God, there\nwere so many people, children and mostly woman. There was an ocean of people crying\nand everything. Those mothers took their children to the train sending them to England\non the Kindertransport knowing that they maybe never see them again. They didn't know\nif they're going to survive or what. So I'm telling you, it was terrible. But when my sister\ncouldn't go they told her that she could make an application for domestic service. So she\nhad no choice. So she did make and we were hoping that she would be able -- somebody\nwould take her in as a maid, you know, because she had to have a visa, that was the most\nimportant thing. So anyhow. So -- but she took me to the station and I was hoping,\nhoping, she'll come soon. You know, because it was easy because the English people\nwere looking for cheap help, you know. Because they didn't pay much. It was just, like,\nroom and board and so on. But she was over 16, you know. So anyhow. So then I came\nto the station. I'm on the platform waiting for the train to come in. I haven't been back to\nschool or seen any of my roommates since last year. Since '38 I haven't been back to\nschool since my father died. And this was already July '39. All of a sudden somebody\ncomes in back of me and hugs and kisses me. And she says, oh, I'm so happy you're\ngoing to be on the same transport. This is my Fritzi. That's a girl that was in my class,\nbut not just in my class, she was eight years in my class from kindergarten on.",
        "A: Fritzi Hacker, H-a-c-a -- c-k-e-r.",
        "A: Fritzi is a German name. But since kindergarten her mother used to bring her to\nschool every single day. And she used to pick her up. And every morning she always\nhad a kind word for me because she says, your mother doesn't bring you to school?\nBecause I told her my mother is bedridden and she can't get out of bed. So she was so\nsorry. So every day she always ask me, how is your mother doing? And so on, you\nknow. She was very, very nice. But I didn't know if they had any other children because\nI've never seen anybody else, only that one girl. I don't even know if she had a father or\nnot. {Undetermined interruption} It's okay.",
        "A: So -- so when I saw her at the -- until the end, she was already 12, 13, 14 -- almost 14\nyears old. She still brought her every morning to school and picked her up every day like\na baby. So when I saw her at the station bringing her to send her to England, I thought to\nmyself how can this woman bring the girl knowing that she may never see her again that\nshe was so attached, you know. So then I said to myself, oh, my God, am I glad my\nparents are dead. I didn't have to say goodbye to them. I didn't leave anybody behind\nexcept my sister and I knew she made the application. She's going to come to England\nvery soon. And then the train came and we got in. We said goodbye.",
        "A: Well, my sister, she made the application for domestic service. And she came, like,\nthree weeks -- she came three days before the war broke out, the last minute. But she had\na very tough time. She had to make all of the arrangements for herself. And, you know,\nlike -- not like me. All we did -- we wore a name tag to know who you are, but\neverything was arranged like the train. I went through Holland. Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Fritzi and I, we were sitting and we were looking out the window. And on the\nother side were two little kids, maybe seven, eight years old. I didn't know them. And\nwe didn't even talk to them. We were just talking to each other. I didn't see her in a year,\nyou know, or any of my schoolmates. So anyhow. So, you know, in the city in Berlin\nthere's only, like, big buildings, cement floors. You don't see trees or grass or anything\nunless you go to the park. So as we were going, didn't take long, you're out of the city\nand you see the suburbs. And there was grass and trees, little houses. So Fritzi said to\nme, isn't it like you're going on a field trip from school and tonight we'll be back home in\nour house with parents -- with our parents? So I said to -- I thought to myself, well, she\nstill had a home to go to and a mother but I didn't. But I didn't want to make her feel bad\nso I just nodded my head. I said, uh-huh, uh-huh, like this. And then as we were going,\nall of a sudden the train stopped. I said, what happened? Looked out the window and I\nsaw the Gestapo outside. I said uh-oh. Now they're going to come and take us off the\ntrain. And I was scared like anything. But I didn't realize -- I forgot we were going\nthrough Holland. So then I realized this must be the border because they came on. It was\na border crossing. So they had to come on and look at your passport. So he says,\npassports, passports. You know, young guys in Nazi uniform. So I got up and I took my\nlittle suitcase down. So you know what he said? Forget about it. He didn't want to look.\nI could have taken anything with me. I was like -- but my sister was, like, she took\neverything. Boy, what they did to her. Well, anyhow. We crossed the border. It took\n15, 20 minutes we cross the border. I said, thank God I'm out of Germany. Now I don't\nhave to worry anymore once you're out of the country. But we were going for a while\nand all of a sudden the train stopped again. I said, what? Another border from Holland?\nWe're going straight through the channel. But when I looked up there was no Gestapo\noutside. They were Dutch women with baskets of food. I still cry when I hear about this.\nI got a tissue, you know. So they knew the children were coming so they brought us\nrefreshments. Wasn't that wonder -- perfect strangers they came on the train. Wasn't that\nsomething? I never forget this. And then we traveled to Holland until the rest of the day.\nAbout 10 o'clock we got off the train that day. And we were by the -- by the British\nchannel. And then they lined us up, make sure everybody was -- I think there were 300\nchildren on that train from the connection spot. And they said, well, I want everybody to\ngo straight to the cabin where they're assigned to. And it is 10 o'clock now -- 10 o'clock\nwe got there. The boat is not going to start going until 12. But don't wait for 12 o'clock\nbecause six o'clock in the morning if you're going to be in Harwich and you have to be\npacked and upstairs ready to go. So go right to bed. Don't wait for 12 o'clock until the\nboat leaves. And when we got on the boat, Fritzi and I, we shared a cabin. So they had a\nbunk and a top one. We had to toss a coin, which one gets the top and which one gets the\nbottom. That was so cute, you know. We were just kids. And anyhow she slept on the\ntop. And as we went to bed she kept talking. She says, are you sleeping? I said, how can\nI sleep when you're talking to me? You know, we're just talking like kids. Teenagers,\nearly teens, you know. So anyhow. So all of a sudden after a while the boat started\nrocking. Uh-oh, it must be 12 o'clock because the boat starting going. He said 12 o'clock\nit's going to start. So it must be two hours already. Better go to sleep. Six o'clock we\nhave to be upstairs. So we must have fallen asleep or something. And then in the\nmorning we got up and we were in Harwich. And from there we took a train to London.\nIt took two hours. And then when we got to London there was, like, a big room, a little\nbigger than this maybe. A little wider. And there was, like, a bench here and a bench\nthere and there. And we were sitting on those benches and some people came and they\ncalled out names. You go with this person. You go with -- nobody knew where they\nwere going. I had no address and I still like to look for this girl. I wish I knew if she's\nalive, if she's in England or some place else. I never saw her since that day. Because I\ndidn't know where I was going and she didn't know where she was going.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. No. That's a shame. I didn't -- I have -- contact --",
        "A: Anyhow I came to England on a Friday. And -- and that week I came to a couple, an\nelderly couple, I mean, old enough to be my parents. They had married children and\ngrandchildren. And I met the family over the weekend.",
        "A: In London, yeah. I met the family over -- they had a married son, two or three kids;\nand a married daughter with some children. And then the youngest daughter was, like, in\nher 20s. And she was -- I didn't even know at the time she was expecting her first baby.\nBut it wasn't hardly to see. And at that time I didn't even know where the babies came\nfrom. Now, I do. Anyhow. So -- so on the weekend I met them and then on -- she says\nto me, well, what are you going to do with yourself? You know, it was July. The schools\nwere Closed. So she said, well, when the schools open in September, we going to register\nyou for school. So in the meantime what are you going to do with yourself? And they\nhad their own -- like, a little factory. They were making civilian trousers for men. So\nMonday morning the younger daughter that was working 1n that place for her father, you\nknow, there were a few people there. They were, like, a few men and one woman. They\nwere in their 50s or 60s, you know. Like, four or five men and one woman was right on\nthe corner. She was, like, 64. They were very nice to me. But they spoke Yiddish. I\ncouldn't speak any English. So they spoke Yiddish to me. I understood but I didn't speak\nit that good. But it's very similar to German. So I knew what they were saying. So she\nintroduced me to everybody and she showed me what to do. How to use this machine\nand this machine. A few machines she taught me at my age, you know. I never worked.\nI had to sew the buttons with the machine. And if you don't put it exactly in and the\nneedle went next to the hole, you break the needles. I must have broke a dozen needles.\nIt was very hard to get it the right way. And she was so fast because she's been used to it,\nyou know. And then there was another machine that made the hems and another machine\nfor the buttonholes. I had to work all three machines, and make tea twice a day for\neverybody who was there. I still hate teA: It reminds me. So anyhow I was working with\nher and she used to take me there in the morning. I think we went by bus. And then I\ncame home in the evening. And before I had dinner she used to say to me -- there was\nonly her and her husband living there -- she said, while the dinner 1s -- while you're\nwaiting you can wash this floor. She made me do the housework before -- after a whole\nday in the factory. Well, anyhow -- but then this was going on for quite a few months.\nSeptember came around. I forgot about it school. You know, and nobody mentioned a\nword. And I was just working, working every day. But then she was getting ready to\nhave her baby. And her name was Fannie. And so she says, well -- when she couldn't go\nto work anymore I was on my own. And then all the work what the two of us did I had to\ndo myself. So instead of going at nine o'clock in the morning I had to go eight o'clock\nand seven o'clock. And instead of staying until five or six, I used to stay until seven,\neight o'clock. Five days, six days, seven days a week, I couldn't keep up. And I don't\nknow what happened. One day I remember I was going to the bus and the bus ride was\ntuppence. Know anything about English money? Tuppence is like 20 cents. So she used\nto give me the tuppence. But then she found out they have -- what is this -- you know, if\nyou come until 7:30 -- before 7:30 in the morning you get a return ticket. So if you give\nthem tuppence and a half, Ha'penny, you get a ticket to go back at night. So she says,\nmake sure you get the bus before 7:30. And she gave me tuppence and a half, the\nHa'penny. And that's all the money I had. I never had pocket money or wages or\nanything, only food and sleep, lodging. So I tried to get the bus -- every time I came to\nthe bus, there was a line from here to God knows where. All these big guys waiting for\nthe bus. They probably had families to support. They saw me, they said, that kid's\nprobably working for pocket money and they used to push me on the side and get on the\nbus. And I tried to get on the bus but I couldn't push those guys away. I was trying to get\nvery hard. If I was lucky I got on it and I had my ticket to go back home. But I\nremember one day I tried so hard and they pushed me on the side. And -- there be\nanother bus in a minute. Half a minute later the bus came, no more return. What I'm\ngoing to do? I had to give them the tuppence and I had a Ha'penny left. I came to the\nplace and I was crying. So the woman that was working, the one woman, she says to me,\nwhat's the matter, Puppala? Puppala means little doll. Why are you crying? So I said, I\nmissed the return bus this morning. So she said, big deal. So you're five minutes late? I\nsaid, no, no, no, no, no. It's not I'm late, I have no money to go back home. She said,\nwhat it is tuppence? Big deal. Here's tuppence. And I made a Ha'penny that day. That's\nthe first money I ever had of my own. Isn't that something? I cried because I didn't make\nthe return bus. But I didn't tell her that.",
        "A: I was living -- no, not the woman that worked there.",
        "A: She was home. She didn't work there.",
        "A: There was people working for them. Well, anyhow. And then another day I was\nstanding in line again waiting for the bus. I mean, every morning I was standing in line\nwaiting for the bus. I tried to get on this as much as I could. But I don't know what\nhappened that morning. All of a sudden I remember standing in line waiting for the bus,\nbut I have no idea what happened. All of a sudden I wake up, I'm in the hospital. I have\nknow idea how I got there.",
        "A: And I'm laying on the bed or stretcher and the young doctor bending over me and\ntalking to me. I couldn't understand a word he was saying because I didn't go to school.\nNobody spoke English to me. I was already, like, a half a year in England. If I go to\nschool I would have spoken -- or people speak to you I would know a little English, but\nnobody spoke English to me. I didn't go to school so I didn't know any English. And he\nwas talking and talking. I didn't know what he was saying. So he didn't know what to do\nwith me. Couldn't even tell me how I feel, why I -- I don't know what happened. I didn't\neven remember fainting or anything. All I remember is -- was I was hot. It was just\nbefore Christmas. This I remember because Father Christmas came. Ho. Ho. Ho. Ho.\nThat's how I remember what time of the year it was. So he didn't know what to do with\nme so they put me in a big room like a ward with about eight or 10 people, woman, there\nall the way in the corner on one bed and they called somebody from the Bloomsbury\nHouse. That's the organization that was responsible for the children, Kindertransport\nchildren. So after a while a Ms. Feldman came to me see me and she spoke to me in\nGerman. And she says to me, how come you don't speak any English? You're here\nalready a long time. I mean, half a year 1s a long time to learn English, right? At least a\nfew words. So I said, nobody speaks English to me, how can I learn? So she said, well,\ndon't you go to school? I said, oh, my God, school. I forgot what school 1s such a long\ntime. Like, a year and a half I haven't been in school. So she says, what are you doing\nwith yourself all day long if you don't go to school? So I said, well, I work in the factory.\nShe says, well, do you have a permit? I said, what's that? I don't know what a permit is.\nSo she said, well, whenever we came we check up on our children and whenever we\ncame to your house the lady always said, she's in school. And when they came on the\nweekend I was never there. She's out with a friend. They probably went to a movie or\nsomething. Because I was never there whenever they came to check up on me. So they\nwouldn't let me go back. And they had no place where to send me. So I had to stay in\nthe hospital until they found a place for me.",
        "A: I know it was after Christmas because I know he came -- you know, Santa Clause\ncame. They call him Father Christmas. And they gave every woman a bed jacket. All\ndifferent colors. And he came to me he says, oh, you're the youngest one here. You're so\npure so I'm giving you a white one so to put on the shoulder. You know, to put on your\narms because they don't have heat there. Not at this time anyhow. So it's like to put on\nthe bed when you sit up in bed, you know.\nSo there was nothing wrong with me. I must have just had a little cold or something. I\nhave -- maybe somebody put -- I have no idea what happened. How I was -- how I end\nup in the hospital.",
        "A: I don't even remember -- I don't remember falling or fainting or anything. But they\nmust have picked me up and take me. I don't remember it. All I remember I'm opening\nup my eyes and that doctor is standing over me and talking to me and I didn't know what\nhe was talking about. But I know I was hot.",
        "A: Well, then she says to me, well, we don't have anybody that can take you unless you\nwant to go to a hostile. I said, I don't know what a hostile 1s. And I don't -- I was just\nscared. I was afraid to go anywhere because the way I felt already. I was afraid of\neverybody. So do you have anybody here? I said, all I know is I have a sister here but I\ndon't even know where she is. She -- she's working for somebody. She same here on\ndomestic service. And you know when they --",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, I know when she arrived, she wrote to me.",
        "A: So I saw her but she had to go to the people that vouch for her. And one weekend I\neven went to visit her for one night.",
        "A: It was far away. It took a couple of hours to get there. But that one weekend when I\ndid go, I went on a Saturday afternoon and I came back Sunday in the evening. That was\nprobably before I worked day and night, you know.",
        "A: And the daughter was still working there at the beginning because she came -- the\nvery last day of August '39. Just three days before the war broke out. So the daughter\nwas still working with me. So I went on a Saturday afternoon. So before I went on that\nbus, I had to go to the police station and get a special permit to spend one night at a\ndifferent address because I was considered an enemy alien.",
        "A: So -- so that's all. So I had the permit and I went there and I got there Saturday in the\nevening late. And I slept over in her room and then Sunday afternoon. But that's the\nonly time I saw her. And when she came, we picked her up from the station. So I saw --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I guess the lady must have. I said, my sister is coming. Well, anyhow -- so -- but she\nhad --",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "A: But -- so my sister had to go right away there. But the people vouch for her and they\nwere waiting for her. So that one night I spent one weekend there. And then the war\nbroke out soon after this, three days later. But at the beginning you heard bombings and -\n- but it wasn't too bad. But later on it got very bad. Bombs were coming down one after\nthe other. You heard about the Blitz of London?",
        "A: It was real bad. So all of the children were evacuated to the country. Because in\nLondon it was bad because there were factories and they tried to bomb all these things.\nAnd I lived in London. But the people my sister was staying with -- I don't know if they\nhad a place in the country or they rented, I don't know. But they couldn't take the bombs\ngoing every night to the shelter. Because I didn't even know what it was like to sleep in a\nbed anymore. For three years, four years, you know, I haven't slept in the bed. So they\nwent to the country and they took her along. So I -- then I couldn't see her at all\nanymore. So I -- I don't know if I knew any of this but I told this Ms. Feldman and they\nmust have made the arrangements. So anyhow. So my sister wrote a letter to me to the\nhospital. And they wouldn't let me out of the hospital. And Ms. Feldman said, the only\nway we can release her is if a person that's already of age. Well, she was old already.\nShe was -- what is age? 17? 18?",
        "A: 18. So maybe she's must have been, yeah, she must have been 18. So she says, well,\nhow can I come to London and stay with you? See, first of all, the bombs and all this is\nbad, but I have no choice you're there too. I was sleeping with the bombs every night.\nBut what am I going to do? I have no occupation. The only thing I know 1s cleaning\nhouses. That's the only thing I know. That's what she came there for. Domestic service.\nSo I said, but I know how to work. I work all three machines, four machines, and I know\n-- and I can do -- so she says, but how am I going to make a living? I said, don't worry. I\nknow how to work. I'll teach you. So that's the only way they'll let me out. So she had to\ncome to London. Take a risk being in London under the Blitz instead of being safe in the\ncountry. And so we rented a room and Ms. Feldman helped us a lot. She says, as long as\nyou're in this country you're my child no matter how old you are. So -- but my sister from\nworking all this -- they didn't have mops. She had to go on her knees and clean the floor.\nHer knees were all swollen, full of pus.",
        "A: She was in terrible shape. A young girl, you know. But we rented a room. I think it\nwas, like, five shilling. It was very cheap. And she got us a job in a war factory to do\nsomething, something with machines. And I had to show her how to work. And we\nmade a living. And, you know, the room was very cheap. It wasn't much of a room. You\ncome up the stairs. There's was one little room. There was a little bed in there, and on\nthe landing was a sink about that size, and a little gas ring. That was our kitchen. And\nthe bathroom was an outhouse in the back.",
        "A: Yeah, I had a roof over my head. So we worked and we supported ourselves. So\nthat's about it. But at least I was with my sister. And, eventually, we picked up, you\nknow -- when you work, you work with English people. I hear them talking. I never\neven heard -- we had no television at that time. Didn't have time to watch it anyhow, I\nwas never home. And so I picked up -- it was easier to listen than to speak. I was afraid\nto open my mouth in case it doesn't come out right. But I could understand already when\nthey were talking to me. There was an English lady sitting right next to me, she was\nabout 45 years old. Because it was an old lady to me, you know, I was still a teenager.\nAnd she was very nice and she helped me a lot explaining me what to do and this is this\nand this is that. She spoke to me English, you know. She didn't know German. And one\nday she came in and she said, oh, we had a lot of bombs last night. And they got bombed\nout the whole house went down. She was living with her elderly parents. And I said,\nwhere are you going to live now? So she says, well, they have the prefabricated houses.\nThey put them up in one day. I said, really? You know, she was very nice. English lady.\nAnd so she says, I'll take you to my house and introduce you to my parents. And she\ntook me over there and they had a beautiful living room, a kitchen, two bedrooms, and a\nbathroom. It was gorgeous. One day they put up prefabricated house. I said, it's a lot\nnicer than mine. But I wasn't jealous. I was happy. I had a roof over my head.",
        "A: Yeah. It was tough. But God was with me all the time. When they came to the\nshelter they gave out little cards and I still have it in my pocketbook. I keep it with me all\nthe time. It's a little card that said, God is your refuge. Don't be afraid. He'll be with you\nall through the raid. When bombs are dropping and danger is near, He'll be with you\nuntil the all clear. And I still have it in my pocketbook. I take it with me wherever I go.",
        "A: And He was with me. Because one night I came home from the -- from work. I was\nso tired. We had to be there at 7:30 in the morning and we worked until 6:30 at night.",
        "A: So I was really -- I was dropping.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
