        "Question: The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr\ncollection. This 1s an interview with Haim Solomon, conducted by Nina Ellis on\nJanuary 5\"\", 2004, in Silver Spring, Maryland. This interview is part of the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum\u2019s post-Holocaust interview project, and it\u2019s a\nfollow up interview to a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum videotaped\ninterview conducted with Haim Solomon in 1995. The United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this\ninterview possible. This is tape number one, side A. All right. Good morning.",
        "Answer: Good morning, Nina.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to start -- we had a little conversation a few weeks ago about\nwhere we would start this interview, and I would like to ask you if you could tell\nme if there is anything that you would like to go back over from your original\ninterview, to add to it. Maybe there\u2019s some new information that you\u2019 ve come\nacross, or do you want to -- I\u2019m talking in generalities.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Not specific issues, specific dates or anything.",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: But is there a-any -- any information that you\u2019ve come across about your years\nbefore, say 1945 that you\u2019d like to add to that original interview?",
        "A: Before 1945.",
        "Q: More or less.",
        "A: I was going to -- to go over the last part of my interview for the first person,\nwhere I stopped with the arrival in Israel.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And to go over that, a-as we -- I left Cyprus, and f -- January first of 1948 --\n\"49, \u2019'm sorry. December \u201947 -- January first, 1949. We arri -- we proceeded from\nCyprus on a small fishing boat that came from Israel with permit to fish in Turkish\nwaters, which 1s the northern part of Cyprus, and by prearrangement with the help\nof the Greeks on the island, th-the ship -- th-the fishers-man came close to the\nnorthern edge of Cyprus, with flashlights and signs and inflatable boats. They\npicked us up from the shore where the Greeks brought us and put us on that\nfishing boat named Karishe, and took us to Israel. Over there the British were still\ncontrolling the Haifa port, and we had to find a place where to land, which was in\nNetanya.",
        "Q: How many people, roughly? I mean -- and how long did it take?",
        "A: It -- it was about 80 - 90 people, because the exits or the escapes from the\nCyprus camps were arranged of -- consisted of eight to 10 people per night.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Once outside, the Greeks would pick us up and take us into an orange grove by\nthe warehouse and lock us up there, so all day we could not come out, but at night\nthey would come open the doors and we roamed somehow, in the orange grove.",
        "Q: Hold on one second.",
        "A: Okay, the fishing boat dropped us off on Netanya. They have -- two buses\nwaited for us with food, clothes, blankets, whatever we could use, and took us 12\nor 15 mile eastward, right across from Netanya, a pla -- a place called Baykleet.\nThat was a -- a place where -- of induction to the im -- Israeli army. As a former\nCyprus senior officer in the Haganah, I was immediately put in charge of\ninducting a-all sorts of newcomers with my several languages that I spoke,\nRomanian, Hebrew, French and some German, I was able to make the proper\narrangements for these youngsters and keep them there for a while. The policy\nwas that for -- to interview these youngsters and see what their future plans are,\nand send them to units where they could begin into that line of work. I was kept\nthere til March the 15\" or eight -- 16\", and as I ex-expressed my desire to study\nmedicine, I was assigned to a military hospital. Was a formerly British hospital,\nand the hospital was called Tel HaShomer. Tel Levinsky that became Tel\nHaShomer. And that\u2019s where I spent my next 30 month in Israel. At this hospital I\nwas supposed to be a -- every two month at a different, or a specialty wards, but I\nstarted at orthopedics, and s-so -- liked it so much that I stayed there all the time.\nOrthopedics and paraplegics. And it was enough t-to come in contact with Israeli\nveterans or wounded soldiers, to become so convinced that -- of our righteous\nbattle. All they wanted, these amputees and paraplegics, they wanted to get well\nso they can go back to the front and fight again. Ah --",
        "Q: And you would talk with them, and you would talk with them about these\nthings, not just about their -- their injuries?",
        "A: Of course --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- of course. That\u2019s what kept them alive, the hope to get better, for a purpose.\nThe same time we had new immigrants from Arab countries that -- that were so\ndeprived of medical attention that some of them were absolutely paralyzed, or --\nor -- they couldn\u2019t function. One particular case I remember, a young kid that\nwould walk only on four, knees and hands and he was brought to us from Yemen\n[indecipherable]. And, smart little kid, but he just couldn\u2019t walk, and ma -- Dr.\nGoldman called me and had a little talk with me that if I agree and go along with\nhim to do what he asks me to, I would -- we could make that child walk again.\nAnd we talked to -- the first thing he said, the first problem I have is you have to\nsleep with him, in the same room. And during the days we\u2019 ll operate and at night\nhe is all yours. So within a short period of time we realized -- we obtained that we\n-- we realized that, and the child started walking with crutches and\n[indecipherable] but ultimately he walked with one cane.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s just one example. Other examples were that many of the high officers in\nthe military came to that hospital for injuries in the back and the knees. I\nremember [indecipherable] Long was one of the patients, I guess, Dayan and some\nother big officers as well, as Holocaust survivors. What was his name, he was\ninvolved in the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Not [indecipherable] Levitz, but his\ndeputy. [indecipherable]. So, that\u2019s where I spent three month in Israel, during\nwhich time my family started coming ba -- over from Romania in 1949, My sister\ncame, married, with her child. In 1950 my parents arrived and in 1951 my other\nsister. One brother stayed in Romania til 1959 and ha -- arrived later.",
        "Q: Were you helping all of them, were you making it possible for them to come,\nor did they have some connections of their own?",
        "A: No, no, no. They personally initiated and arrived in Israel.",
        "Q: And when you were working in this hospital for 30 months, that\u2019s almost three\nyears, did you intend to stay in Israel that whole time? Was it your intention to go\nto school there and -- and try and make a life in Israel, or were you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That was your idea?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: In fact, 12 - 13 or 15 hours a day that I u-used to work brought me to\nexhaustion and the doctors would send me to Jerusalem for 10 - 15 days of R and\nR. And those days I would visit the university, which was then at [indecipherable |\na big Catholic school that was changed -- was given to the university for beginners\nand just visitor -- visiting students. That was part of the R and R in Jerusalem, so\nthat after two years of compulsory military in the hospital, they asked me to stay\nlonger, and I stayed another six months, to make it into 30 months service. And\nthat was the end of 1951 already, that I realized that the university in Jerusalem\nhad no medical school or no beginning of medical school. They had many\nstudents that started out abroad, and only with the third year they would start them\nin the hospital, supervised by famous doctors and this way progress towards\ngraduation. But the first two years they couldn\u2019t have, they needed dissections.\nThe Orthodox Jews wouldn\u2019t allow Jews to be dissected. That\u2019s --",
        "Q: And you needed those first years.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: You had -- you hadn't had that yet.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What -- u-up until this point what -- what kind of education did you have, what\n-- equivalent to what?",
        "A: In Europe and Romania, I graduated from high school with a baccalaureate it\u2019s\ncalled, a high school diploma. And realizing all this and being in correspondence\nwith a brother I had in Detroit, who arrived there in 1946, maybe \u00b047, I cannot\npinpoint it, but I corresponded with him and explained the condi -- situation and\nhe brought up the idea of coming here. And I liked it, and I prepared for it in a\nsense. I started all the necessary arrangements for going to America.",
        "Q: Even though your family was coming over from Romania?",
        "A: Yes, they all agreed that it\u2019s rough, tough, and I\u2019m still young to recoup, or\nrecover. So, late in 1951, I started the preparations or investigations into -- for\ngoing to America. Immediately I got me a English teacher, for more -- better\nEnglish. I started the passport applications and visas for the Americans. First they\nindicated I get the visa and get to America and there si -- approach the college.\nThen they informed me that no, it\u2019s the other way around. First you have to be\naccepted by a school in the United States, and on that basis we can grant you a\nvisa for a student. In Detroit my brother had a brother-in-law who was a professor\nat Wayne State University, and he made all these arrangements on the basis of that\nhigh school diploma and obtained from them a letter that I am accepted for the\nsemester beginning on September 12 or so, 1952. But nothing was ready in Israel\nfor me to go. So I visited the American embassy, undergo -- went a test in\nEnglish. All arrangements began to s -- to -- to shape up to the point where I\nreceived a visa and we bought a ticket at TWA and started my trip on November\nthe second of 1952.",
        "Q: Before you went, your parents had already come?",
        "A: 1950 they arrived.",
        "Q: They had already come, and your -- had brothers and sisters there.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Was it a -- difficult for you to go? Was it a wrenching, emotionally, to leave? I\nmean --",
        "A: It had to be, but they themselves were in bad shapes, really. All they could\nafford or find were very limiting -- limited housing conditions. The first sister that\ncame in \u00b049 had a one room apartment. It\u2019s the same room with -- 1950 my\nparents arrived -- had to stay with them for awhile. Then the parent moved out and\nthe other sister arrived. When her husband realized what\u2019s going on, he took off\ninto the desert, to B\u2019eyr-Sheva, and there he found all they wanted. A lot of work -\n- he was in the building area, the building business, and he build up th-the Negev,\nthe desert, all the way to the Dead Sea, kibbutzim and so on. So slowly, slowly\nthings settled in Israel, but my going was part of their settlement and after leaving\nthe hospital and [indecipherable] to take off for America, I was unemployed -- oh,\nno, I worked for the [indecipherable] right in Jaffa, where my parents lived.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know what that is, what is that?",
        "A: The [indecipherable] is the organization of all the Yishuvim, of all the Israeli\nkibbutzim and moshavim and all sorts of settlements, they are the government\u2019s\narm that supplies them with administration and also money, funds for all the\nnecessities. Ag -- agriculture implements, agricultural implements, modern\nagriculture -- tractors, plowshares, a-all sorts of things. And I worked there for\nfour or five month. And -- while taking steps towards my leaving. The trip itself\nwas problematic. At the time there were no straight flights --",
        "Q: Excuse me, before we go into the trip I want to ask you one more question\nabout your time in Israel if you don\u2019t mind.",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: You were there at a -- when the State of Israel was formed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you were there long enough, and -- I would think, to feel some\nidentification with Israeli aspirations and because you m-met so many of these\nformer soldiers and injured soldiers, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and had conversations with them, and --",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: -- and you were a young man, and probably had some idealism. Did -- did you\nfeel a -- Israeli a-at that point? Did you feel like you were giving up something, or\ndid you think you were going to come back, or was there any issue there for you\nof -- of -- of identity with the Israeli cause? Or were you just so focused on getting\nyour education and that, 1-1t was a side --",
        "A: The European experience plus the Cyprus retention of our going -- one year in\nCyprus was enough to -- to store up venom, or -- or ambition to get out, do\nsomething more. And I did all I could during these 30 month, that\u2019s why I stayed\nlonger, because I saw what is needed. But at that point I realized that there\u2019s very\nlittle I can do at the higher level, that I can do there, even though I travel and\ntoured and visited all that historic places, and the military places where famous\nbattles took place. Traveled the country it -- north and south, a lot to\n[indecipherable]. And more and more I became convinced that if I stay at that\npoint, I can work at the [indecipherable]. I spent some time in Jerusalem taken just\na biolo -- biology classes, more or less unrelated to medicine.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, but you weren't going to become a doctor?",
        "A: I did at that point -- more personally I was sure, or felt I can do a lot for these\nwounded people. And all my superiors at the hospital called me Dr. Haim and\nthey thought I could make -- I would make a big -- a good doctor.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So, 1-1-1t was this very strong drive that you had to be a doctor and you\n-- and that wasn\u2019t going to happen if you stayed around.",
        "A: No, it was not going to happen.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Reality came in the first week in America, that in America you don\u2019t just go to\nmedical school from high school as you do in Romania, as my wife went for -- at\nthe age of 17 she went to medical school.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: In America you go into pre-med, and that takes four years.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, geez.",
        "A: And after that, if you push and qualify -- I kept applying for medical schools.\nSo I -- I started this four year of pre-med, and I started liking it because at Wayne\nUniversity -- number one, I arrived in November the fourth or fifth, into a\nsemester that started September 15. And it was way up above my possibilities to\ncatch up and do any good. S-So they put me into an English for foreign students,\nwhich 1s for no credit and it doesn\u2019t matter how well you do. I was able to do very\nwell, especially in the writing, and I had to take a class on government, which was\ntotally strange to me. One -- 1n the -- in history, but European history, it was easy\nfor me. And from November til January the 15\" or 20\", when the semester ended,\nthat was a real killer.",
        "Q: Frustrating.",
        "A: Unbelievable. That\u2019s the story of America. If I had the -- the money, I would\nhave turned around and gone right back.",
        "Q: Back to Israel?",
        "A: Back to Israel.",
        "Q: In those first coup -- in those first few months.",
        "A: On the first half a year or one year.",
        "Q: Because it seemed like such a long --",
        "A: Such a --",
        "Q: -- impossibly long.",
        "A: -- difficult, difficult obstacles.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And money-wise, I did not come with money. My brother who came to pick\nme up and did all these things preparing for me, he was not well-to-do, and I felt\nvery bad and very guilty and was ready to do anything.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let me -- let me turn this tape over.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Haim Solomon. This is tape number one, side B. What -- you\u2019re in\nDetroit now, it\u2019s --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- late in the year in 1952.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You\u2019re living with your brother. What did your brother do at this point?",
        "A: Really, clearly, I don\u2019t know, but we had an uncle that had the business in\nDetroit, but he lived in New York, and so my brother, somehow, managed his\nbusinesses. Business was in the manufacturing of shuffleboard --",
        "Q: Hm. Equipment?",
        "A: -- equipment.",
        "Q: Huh.",
        "A: Yes. Horrible, because some of these shuffleboards were installed in bars and\nin -- and I had to go with my brother and collect. If you know the shuffleboard,\nyou open the box and you count the money and half goes to the bar, and half --",
        "Q: They were -- so they were games?",
        "A: Games.",
        "Q: Bar games --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- kind of. Uh-huh. Huh.",
        "A: And people --",
        "Q: And then you started full time taking classes in January --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- 1953.",
        "A: That was be -- starting -- becoming a lot simpler and easier. In the meantime I -\n- I met some other Israeli students at the university. A lot of Jewish students came\nto us. Detroit had something called a ZOA house, the Zionist Organization of\nAmerica house. And every weekend they would -- all the Zionists would meet\nthere, but on weekends they would give it to us and we brought together all the\nIsraelis and all the American Jewish students, and we sang, we danced, we ate, we\nfraternized. The whole atmosphere became warmer and more reliable, and more --\nyou could turn to any of these American students for orientation, for advice,\netcetera.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. So you started to feel more comfortable.",
        "A: Start to feel more comfortable. Classes were easier. At the university, every\nstudent is assigned to an advisor, and mine was a Dr. Theodoro. Dr. Theodoro was\nthe daughter of the ambassador from Thailand and London. So he-her teacher was\nChaim Weitzman. When I came to her with my name of Haim, she -- come from\nIsrael, she caught me, you don\u2019t want to study medicine, you want to study\nmicrobiology, because you\u2019re going back to the Hebrew references of Chaim\nWeitzman and tell me more of what you did. He was her professor, but Chaim\nWeitzman worked with an organism, a bacterium that he forced into producing\nacetone. The bacterium is called Clostridium acetobutylicum Weitzmani.",
        "Q: Hm, named after him.",
        "A: The -- this organism, if you feed it whatever is good for -- it prefers, this\nbacterium, it produces acetone and butyl alcohol, or Vitamin Bz. Chaim Weitzman\nwas able to inhibit its second part production and en -- and encourage it to\nproduce acetone, which the British needed in World War I. And for that he was\nrewarded with a Balfour Declaration.",
        "Q: Was he someone that you knew about?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I know of his activities, and he was the first president of Israel, and very active\nin -- in the process of obtaining independence from Britain. But all this personal\nconnection of this Dr. Theodoro with him, and now with me, indeed. So she\nguided me into microbiology. I took a lot of classes in it throughout the four year\nstudies towards a Bachelor of Science. And just because I had such choices, I took\nall sorts of classes that I liked in psychology and logic. French. French was\nsomething that I knew well so I took classes in order to raise my grade average.\nIndeed, 1t worked. But she wanted me to work with that organism, but this time to\ndo the opposite, inhibit its production of acetone and encourage its production of\nVitamin B2. Very important in Asia and Europe, too. But that was for graduate\nschool, later on.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Ah, in the meantime in Detroit, as I said, I began teaching Hebrew.",
        "Q: To?",
        "A: To various Hebrew or Jewish synagogues.",
        "Q: To kids?",
        "A: Such as Temple Beth El, a Reform synagogue, and Temple Emmanuel, another\nReform synagogue. Jews that wanted to be Jewish, you know. That was my\ngreatest disappointment, that Israelis, or Hebrew teachers that they had, locals,\nwouldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t want to teach in Reform synagogues. And I was so mad, I went\nto st -- teach at the Reform. And I\u2019m glad to this day that a lot of kids were so\ncurious about their Jewishness, and whatev -- in -- in -- to the degree, or to th --\nway beyond what they saw in the house.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They wanted to know more, and that\u2019s what I was teaching them. Anyway, the\nsecond job [indecipherable] at Temple Emmanuel was part already of the United\nHebrew Schools. In all of Detroit there were United Hebrew Schools. United\nHebrew Schools you can be a teacher if you attend a Hebrew academy, or\nMidrasha to get a Hebrew teacher\u2019s certificate. So you take some education\nclasses at the university, and Hebrew classes at the Midrasha, and become a\nHebrew teacher, a certified Hebrew teacher. And I did that. And also within the\nUnited Hebrew schools, with all the Israeli students that functioned as teachers,\nwe had a group of -- a choir and dancers, and we would travel around all the small\ncommunities in Michigan, and perform for them.",
        "Q: You did, too?",
        "A: I did, too.",
        "Q: You\u2019re a singer?",
        "A: A singer, a dancer, everything, like --",
        "Q: Oh, mm.",
        "A: -- to bring some Israeliskind they used to call it. In the summers I used to work\n[indecipherable] I was playing with the idea of going back. M-My brother --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s take a break, just a second. [tape break]. Okay. You were saying? You\nwere Starting to say something about your brother.",
        "A: Oh, yes. My brother was employed by the -- by our uncle, but it didn\u2019t do\nmuch and his income was very limited.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did he have a family?",
        "A: A wife, a child.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I was talking about leaving, because as a foreign student you\u2019re not\nallowed to work, and it -- if they -- 1f you get -- you come up to a B average, you\ncan get a permit for 10 - 12 hours a -- a week to work. So with my brother, we\ndiscussed this -- this, and the only arrangement [indecipherable] him is to go back\nto what he knows best, and that is to open a store, a dry goods store.",
        "Q: Just like in Romania.",
        "A: Like in Romania, and I can work there unofficially.",
        "Q: Mm, cause you were living with him the whole time?",
        "A: Only the first six months, maybe. And then I just moved to a family that rented\nout rooms.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: One room, one. They usually would have one student.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And did he do that? Did he open a store?",
        "A: Yes, he did that.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: He opened a store in 1953, late in \u201953. And after classes I would go to the\nstore, send him home to help in the house with the child. And that started opening\nup th-the possibility of doing something.",
        "Q: Where was the store?",
        "A: In Detroit.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: On Third Street.",
        "Q: Was it downtown?",
        "A: Close, not really. Close to downtown. And I worked very hard --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- and very nice, and the main business is on the weekend and so I could work\nfor 12 hours and keep it [indecipherable] became very -- did very well, to the\npoint where some years later 1t developed into a wholesale -- to a distributor --\ndistribution import and --",
        "Q: Of fabric?",
        "A: Fabrics, shoes --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- and shoes. But ready-made pants, shirts, etcetera.",
        "Q: Mm. What was the name of the business?",
        "A: Well, he bought it from another person called Bernstein, so everybody called\nus Bernstein\u2019s. But Henry was a very smart fellow.",
        "Q: That\u2019s hi -- is that your brother?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Henry.",
        "A: Henry.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you\u2019re in school full time, you\u2019ve been encouraged to study\nmicrobiology --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- which you did. You finished in four years? Did you finish 1n --",
        "A: Right, in fift --",
        "Q: -- that\u2019s pretty good. Working a lot, and --",

        "A: No. Really. But in 1956 I graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in science. And\nin \u201957, I started the graduate school, with this Dr. Theodoro, with the organism\nwhat -- that I mentioned. No need to mention it again. And we worked on it, and I\ntook a trans -- graduate classes. We worked on it for six, eight months, when she\nreceived a Fulbright scholarship to go back to Oxford and study there with Dr.\nKrebs.

This -- Dr. Theodoro was a\nphysiologist of bacteria, and Dr. Matman was more of a clinical, so when she\nswitched me to another thesis [indecipherable] but also with a organism that is\nanaerobic, lives in the absence of air. And what happened, the same, I worked in\nthe store, I taught Hebrew, and attended classes. But in 1956, before she left, she\nmade me into a laboratory assistant, and Dr. Rose -- Ross -- Rosen -- Gosen, he\nliked me, he wanted me as a laboratory assistant, but I couldn\u2019t become an\nemployee of the university without citizenship. And so within a few months he\narranged my conversion into a green card American citizen.",

        "A: It\u2019s amazing that -- how everybody locked up like a clam, and nobody spoke\nanything. Only now do I realize two brother from Polish origin, they studied at\nWayne State University. They live here now. They went through real difficult\ntimes. They -- in Poland they realized all their dif -- what goes on there. So they\nran away and lived in the woods with other partisans for months, for years. Right\nin the middle of German occupation. But we never talked about it.",
        "Q: Mm. There must have been a lot of people in Detroit with stories like that.",
        "A: Like that, yes.",
        "Q: People didn\u2019t -- they just -- why didn\u2019t they talk about it?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you. To this day, I never talked about it, I never asked anyone to\nlisten to -- to what happened. Just keep on going and advance. Forget the past.\nSome from Budapest that went through their difficulties, but Poland mostly was\nthe most dangerous place that they came out alive. Still, we didn\u2019t talk about.",

        "A: Until now.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Like my wife said, I -- we -- we didn\u2019t consider ourselves any survival --\nsurvivors of the Holocaust. And knock on wood, due to my father\u2019s\nadministration, we came out, the whole family, intact.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Difficulties, dangerous conditions, but we came out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. But you were also -- you were in a position to understand\nwhat other people had been through, and to know --",
        "A: Of course, of course --",

        "A: Oh.",

In other words, don\u2019t tell us any\nof that.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t ac-actually experience that, you just sort of assumed that that\u2019s\nwhat people were thinking, right?",

Did you have a sense of how -- whether or\nnot people were well informed about what had happened?",
        "A: American Jews -- the community in Detroit for instance, shook off their\nresponsibility. Whatever needed to be done was supposed to be done in New\nYork. And indeed there was a strong organization in New York, the American\nJewish Committee and the World Jewish Congress and -- and the -- some other\norganizations that were supposed to protest and they did.",

        "A: I was still in Detroit. I wanted to see the country here. So the summer of \u201961,\nwith another friend, we took -- we drove around 10 weeks. We drove around the\nUnited States, and stopped in all the parks in all the cities.",
        "Q: Was that the first time you had traveled in the U.S.?",
        "A: Well, during school years we would come for New Years to New York, drive -\n- driving a full car. That\u2019s about all. Maybe we went to Chicago once for a\nwedding, one of our Israeli students [indecipherable] maybe th -- Jankela. But\notherwise, we didn\u2019t know the country and we had to really t-t-to integrate here,\nwe need to travel around and see the whole place. Fascinating what America did.\nIn 1961 or \u201962, the University of Arizona at Tucson, in their catalog suggested that\neither they have it, or they\u2019re going to open a faculty microbiology of arid lands.\nVery good for Israel, very good for south amer -- South America and ourselves.\nAnd that caught my attention. A friend of mine working at the U.N. suggested\nwith my ability of languages and this kind of microbiology could really pick me\nup, bring me up. So I -- I applied there, I went there to find out that they don\u2019t\nhave it yet, they want to develop it, and I could help them, be part of it. I didn\u2019t\nlike it, but I was there already so I stayed for a year, and that\u2019s where I --",

        "A: But they needed some sort of Jewish education and I arrived there and they\nwere very happy to bring them together. We had about 30 kids, and we would\nmeet on Saturday and Sunday at a Kiwanis Club.

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I enjoyed it, I liked it, 1t gave me a sense of doing something 1n addition,\ncause with the schooling I didn\u2019t see anything ready for me to proceed. So I took\nvarious classes in microbiology, chemistry, or whatever could be helpful for -- for\nthe Ph.D. program.",

        "A: And at the end of the year I -- oh, I started that in September \u201962 and by June I\n-- it -- September, but later on, for Passover, we drove back to Detroit from\nTucson, two students from New York picked me up -- too -- dropped me in\nDetroit and they proceeded on. And while in Detroit for Passover vacation, or\nEaster vacation, I approached the University of Michi -- Michigan State\nUniversity and explained to them why I don\u2019t like it there, and what I\u2019m willing to\n-- able to do, and certainly for the fall of that year, \u00b063, I would be accepted for --\nat their university as a graduate student. And s -- exce -- I did exactly that. When\nthe school year ended in June in Tucson, Arizona, I sold the car, packed up and\ncame back to Detroit by train. Made -- started arrangements with -- at Michigan\nState University. Found a professor that thought I could help him with some of his\nprojects, and so I started with the program towards a doctorate de-degree at\nMichigan State University.",
        "Q: In Lansing.",
        "A: In Lansing, East Lansing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Very interesting work. Now I started working with this Clostridium that I was\nfamiliar with, but this time with Clostridium botulinum. Famous bacterium that\ncauses botulism --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- when consumed with canned foods or other foods. The question was --\nMichigan was basically a dairy college or university and the question was whether\nthis Clostridium botulinum would grow in milk. But the Clostridia have two\nkinds, one that spoils the milk and one that doesn\u2019t spoil the milk, but they both\nproduce a highly potent toxin. So my project was to work with the Clostridium\nbotulinum type E, the one that does not curd the milk, and see whether it will\ngrow at the refrigeration temperature, and -- before spoiling the milk. So we did a\nlot of work on that when suddenly s -- all around the Great Lakes, a large die off\nof seagulls were washed off 0 -- on the shore. And all over Michigan there were\nsmokers that smoked fish and sold them open on the roadside in stores. But when\nthe plastic -- plastics came out, they started packing these smoked fish in plastics,\nunder vacuum, and that\u2019s exact the conditions that promote growth of this\nbacterium --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- to the point where it produces toxin, and if it\u2019s that type that doesn\u2019t spoil the\nmilk, it does not show any decomposition. So people would eat and become sick\nand die. There were quite a few deaths in Michigan due to these smoked fish pla --\npacked in plastic bags. One particular case of three ladies having brunch together\nwhere they ate some such fish or tuna. And the next day two of them were dead.\nOne was dead immediately, one died in the hospital, a third one survived. And the\n-- the FDA in Detroit was in charge of this case. But this was already late, in 1965,\n64, that two ladies died, one survived, and FDA in Detroit is investigating this\ncase. Investigating means first thing go to their house and see what else there is\nthere. They found a lot of cans and a lot of products that all had these toxin. Now\nthe people in Detroit and the FDA didn\u2019t have any idea of how or what to do.\nThey went to Wayne State University, and at Wayne they told them, look, we\nhave a -- we had a person qualified to talk to you, but he is now at Michigan State\ndoing -- working exactly on the same general situation. So they came to Michigan\nState and there I showed them how to do, what to do, etcetera, etcetera, until my\nprofessor walks out of the laboratory and they said to me [indecipherable] person,\nhe says Haim, you have to come and work for us. Forget this classes here, and\ncome to us. And he kept coming every other week, every week and asking me,\njust don\u2019t -- why won\u2019t you come down to Detroit, see what we are talking about.\nSo I did, after I talked to some other professors. And there he tells me, and I tell\nhim what to do, he tells me what needs to be done. But when all is -- this is over,\nwe need to do some other work with E. coli and salmonella and all such cases.\nAnd I say no, not for me. I\u2019m strictly working with this Clostridtum botulinum. So\nhe calls up Washington and the division director asks him to talk -- to give me the\nphone to talk, and he talks to me about -- first he asks me are you married? No.\nPerfect. Smart [indecipherable] whatever he said. But he started enumerating the\nthings that they want to do here. And they have -- just starting to organize one\nlaboratory with -- and they have one person already from [indecipherable]\nDietrich who worked on this and they are looking all over the country. So, really,\nthey made me such offers I couldn\u2019t refuse. Early in 1965, we -- I -- w-we\narranged a meeting in New Jersey, a convention. And there I met with them and\nagain, they emphasized all the possibilities, you know, the activities, and what we\ncan do and what we need to do, etcetera, etcetera. And there I was fresh with this\nexperience from Detroit and at Michigan. And -- and they thought I\u2019m gonna open\nup the place for them. We started investigating, first of all the smoke-fish industry,\nwhich was completely closed down, FDA came out with a clear arrangement,\nevery one of these small places that smoke fish, just by touching, and ba -- just\nestimating. Some arrangements were made with the banks, or with the department\nHHS, or -- for them to be compensated or bought out, and only a few large\ncompanies in Chicago and New York were allowed to take all these little places\nand develop a program that will assure a safe product. There was one incident,\nhorrible incident. This smoked fish was tr -- sent out from Michigan to Kroger\nstores in the south, Tennessee, Arkansas. And the truck driver started out in\nMichigan, that suddenly the refrigeration broke down. When he realized it, it was\nalready 10 - 12 hours, but he pulled into a garage and they started fixing it. Fixing\nit, cooled up the -- cooled off th-the truck and the products, and -- and proceeded\nto deliver the product cold, refrigerated, as though nothing happened. And the six\nor eight people that bought these fish, died. A lot of Jews. It was a Jewish tasting -",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Levys, and Cohens and five, six people died. And others were affected, but\nsurvived. And so I\u2019m now an employee at the Food and Drug Administration. I\ncame in 1965, the FDA was still located in the Department of Agriculture, the\nsouth building. Soon enough we moved into a new building on 200 C Street,\nsouthwest.

        "A: Very early 1968 - \u201969, that friend of mine, Moshe Brodetsky and myself started\ntalking about doing something about Soviet Jewry because the j -- Jewish\ncommunity, the organized Jewish community didn\u2019t want to touch it.",
        "Q: Hm. Really?",
        "A: Jewish Community Council, not the center, Jewish Community Council, and\nthat\u2019s where I met these young kids from New York that were equally inclined to\ndo something, and we started the organization with a membership and newsletter,\nand -- and we found out that there are such organizations in other cities, and --\n[interruption |",
        "Q: And you said you had a newsletter, and you had regular meetings, and wa --\nand what kind of things did you do?",
        "A: Yes, we a newsletter that was nationwide, because there was a similar\norganization in Cincinnati and one in California, in Los Angeles, one in Florida.\nAnd so we had the newsletter that came out once a month. We had meetings. We\nwould go out to talk to other groups, because the Jewish Community Council felt\nthat we are interfering with their leadership, and we didn\u2019t, we weren\u2019t, we just --\neventually we made arrangements with the labor union right across the -- the\nSoviet embassy on 16\" Street, where we organized a daily vigil, which the police\ntold us we\u2019re not supposed to have any signs, or any speeches, or any\npronunciations, but it\u2019s okay for us to stand there. And every day at 12:30 to one,\nwe would assemble there in front of the building, across from the Soviet embassy\nand just stand there for half an hour, maybe read some passage [indecipherable].\nIn fact, w-we had the pastor from the -- the big church on 16\" Street in -- in\nMassachusetts -- was it 14\" str -- John Steinberg -- Steinbrook.",

        "Q: And what was going on at this time, was that the sa -- the Soviet government\nwas not allowing Jews to leave?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: An-And -- and was it that general situation that you were 1-in opposition to, or\nwere there specific cases that you were --",
        "A: Well, in the meantime, the arrested all the -- the activists that -- all those who\napplied for exit and were refused, so we had the list of refuseniks, and we\nproduced bracelets with their names, and some sort of hanging with their names,\nand we went to various synagogues and asked them adopt one of these refuseniks\nand com -- and correspond with them, and send them help. In the meantime,\npeople would travel to visit Russia and meet with these refuseniks. The famous\n[indecipherable] Sharansky, she used to come here, and we took her to the various\nsenators, congressmen. The famous Jackson amendment came out of our activities\nand our influence with Senator Jackson, of Washington, and his assistant, Richard\nPerle, who wrote the Jackson amendment, Jackson-Vanik, which made\ncommercial relations with Russia related to their -- to their treatment of Jews\naspiring to emigrate, the Jewish emigration from Russia to Israel, or to here, or to\nEurope.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Who were now fired from their government jobs, and under -- under\nobservance from all the KGB, and they were helped materially with money to just\nsur -- survive. And their names were specifically submitted to the Russians to\nallow them to -- whoever was president here, had these names ready to negotiate\nfurther.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And that worked continued for how long? Up until -- how long did\nthat go on, the work, what you were doing?",
        "A: All of the 70\u2019s, the struggle went on. I\u2019m not sure exactly when the Russians\nfinally opened the gates and they -- first they asked for payment for the education\nthat these Jews received before exiting or leaving Russia and all the advantages\nthey had enjoyed there. But eventually they opened the gates, and a large -- a large\nnumber of immigrants started out from Russia to Israel, and Germany, and\nRomania and Poland. They just went out.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. In the late 70\u2019s, I think it was 1979 specifically, there was a\ntelevision program that aired in this country on ABC about the Holocaust, and a\nlot of people point to that nationwide viewing of that program as sort of a -- a\nbeginning of -- of th -- of public education in this country about the Holocaust.\nAnd a lot of people started speaking out about their experience in -- in the late\n70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s.",

        "Q: It -- it was a -- sort of a flowering of knowledge, and -- and dissemination and\nlot of young people started observing Holocaust Remembrance Day around this\ntime.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And I\u2019m just wondering, you know, what kind of a -- how did you -- what were\nyou doing in those years and -- and did -- and -- and did you start speaking out\nabout the -- about your experiences, or -- or about other people\u2019s experiences and\ngetting involved somehow in -- in educating people about the Holocaust?",
        "A: Not yet. Not in the 80\u2019s. But like Detroit, Washington had a Jewish\nCommunity Council, involved with Jewish affairs, and we in the committee were\nforcing them to pick up more topics, and more projects, and more involvement.\nSo, when Yom HaShoah and the other such anniversaries occurred, of course we\nwere there and we were approving and supporting these renewal of activities.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. You -- in the 80\u2019s then, you had young children.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- and -- and how did you approach that question?",
        "A: -- first of all, from babyhood, we placed them in Jewish schools.",

        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where th -- they invited me to speak about -- for -- around Passover\ntime, where every Jew is supposed to experience that -- the Exodus, so this was\nmy story of the Exodus. What else?",
        "Q: Was that the first time you had spoken publicly about your experience in -- in\nfront of a group, and --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It was?",
        "A: Oh, before that, for the Soviet Jewry activities, I worked the -- I talked to\nHadassah group to s-si -- my own group that would meet Fridays.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And oh, wherever I was, at a coffeehouse, at a -- oh, maybe that\u2019s an aspect\nthat needs to be covered --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- because when we started the Soviet Jewry activities and the Jewish\nCommunity Council was adamantly against us, we are disturbing the -- we voted\nourselves into that Jewish Community Council, and there were plenty of other\nmembers that sided with us, and we were able to bring about, by democratic\nvoting, activities that we wanted the Council to do, and indeed they did. And they\napproached this Soviet Jewry activities and protest as a community -- experience\nin community involvement. From Orthodox to Reform, we had more help from\nthe Reform synagogues than from the others, and financially they said anything\nyou need, we can help you. We needed to -- mailings and rallies and such\norganizations that needed money and they supplied us very nicely. The\nWashington Hebrew congregation specifically gave us money and told us clearly,\nwhatever you need, you tell us. I was already prepared and understood that th --\nthis Reform movement in this city, or in this country, and I knew that they are\nwith us, just as in Detroit, I was with them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: In fact, when I came to Washington, I taught at the Temple Sinai for one year.\nIt was late for them to prorate me into the Hebrew curriculum, but I taught history\nand [indecipherable] Bible. Prophets, specifically. Presently I\u2019m ba -- the treasurer\nof an Orthodox congregation on 16\" Street. But I feel fine in any denomination.\nAnyone that wants to be Jewish, and wants to experience Jewishness, is fine with\nme.",
        "Q: And are you still s-speaking publicly when you\u2019re asked to do so, about your\npersonal experiences? Do you do that very often?",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And way back when I was the chairman of The Coffeehouse, Marty met his\nwife there, and -- but before that he also became interested and involved -- in fact,\nat some point, when I could no longer do that, he took over the chairmanship of\nThe Coffeehouse. And with him I would e-explain and talk about my experiences.\nSo when he became the chairman of the Holocaust Survivors, he -- every time we\nhad a meeting -- chance to meet, he would explain to me that I need to join his\ngroup as a survivor. Like my wife said I didn\u2019t feel like I went through the\nHolocaust horrors, cause with all the difficulties, our father c -- walked us through\nthe Holocaust in safety. So I kept telling him that, presently I\u2019m with the FDA and\nwhen I retire, I\u2019m coming to volunteer there.

He took me over to the library and the archives and made\nthem an offer, he said, they can\u2019t refuse; a Romanian speaking volunteer. And\nsure enough, Henry Mayer, in charge of the archives explained to me that they\nhave a large volume of Romanian documents, tapes, that need translation and they\ndon\u2019t have any translator. So we started out with a short project of five tapes and\nanother one, six - seven tapes and now I\u2019m in a project of 1944 - \u00b045 already, 17\ntapes in that series that need translation. In the meantime they -- they send me 12\ndepositions of the Gypsies in Romania that were transported to Transnistria, and\nnow they are about to receive German compensation.

        "A: I mean, they picked only the most egregious cases.",

        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: 2000 - 2001. But they picked the 12 most grave -- grav -- and I translated them\nin a way that they could see exactly what they did to them.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And what does it mean to you to be doing this volunteer\nwork?",
        "A: It\u2019s very rewarding in the sense that it will become available in English. Not in\ndetail, but only in titles, or summaries of the Jewish suffering in Romania during\nthe war. The -- th-the -- the secrets or th-the -- the way they -- they brought about\nthe loss of 400,000 Jews in Romania during these years, every new laws that they\ncould use to -- to obstruct and to prevent Jews from just living normal lives.\nProfessionals expelled from their professions, assets were nationalized, or -- as\nthey called it. Romanians were allowed to buy Jewish properties for very minimal\nprices, then rent them out to the Jews. Even some that didn\u2019t -- the la -- the -- the\nrules were -- th-the laws were called, for people who didn\u2019t have any housing, to\ntake over the Jewish houses. But these were just making business out of it, even\nthough they had wonderful houses, they took over from the Jews, and rented them\nout to Jews. They would advertise them as such, Jews preferred, and exorbitant\nprices, and just made out a -- a business out of it. All sorts of aspects are --\natheistic Jews -- Jews or a -- or non-Jews, they were still considered Jews for\ndeportation. And a bunch, a large number of baptized Jews, baptized to either\nGreek Orthodox or Catholic, and the Catholic Nuncio and the Pope insisted that\nthey are Catholics and they are not to be treated or mistreated as Jews. But the\nGreek Orthodox, they insisted that they -- if they claim to be Christian, they\nshould be deported as -- to go out and a-as -- what do you call it, to proselytize\nother Jews in Transnistria. So that was their position. And certain pogroms in\nKishinev and in Iasi. The one in Iasi, I personally experienced, in hiding. And a\nlot of things that even though I was youngster and lived there during these years, I\ndid not understand it, and did not know it exactly the way it happened, until I meet\nit, or find it now in the Romanian text that I translate into English.",

And my older son worked here for three months, at the\nNational Food Processors Organization.

But I want to\nshow him Iasi, where the pogrom took place, that house where we lived, the place\nwhere my brothers were almost killed. Maybe Bucharest. We went from Bivolari\nto Iasi to Bucharest to Cyprus to Israel to Detroit.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s a long journey.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That takes away years. And here I am, I need to make it up and at the FDA, I\nreally developed for all these years. The 60\u2019s, we -- we put some sense and some\nsecurity, safety, into the fish industry. In the 70\u2019s we had the -- the mushroom\nindustry, was poisoning people all over the country. In the 80\u2019s, we had the\nsalmon industry, that we regulated. You know, the salmon industry is the larg --\nthe only country in the world that produces that much salmon, all around the\nworld, except that the canning it -- of 1t was so primitive that they used to make a -\n- th-the cans, flatten them without the top or the bottom, and take them to Alaska,\nand there press into th-the -- the bottom of the can, fill the can, put the top and\n[indecipherable] it. Well, people died. In London and Belgium and Australia, all\ndue to American salmon. So FDA was able to a-abolish that system and FDA\nhired additional inspectors, about 600 of them to go around and look for these\ncans, and these cases. And finally we came about a safe product, the canning\nindustry, the -- the salmon industry, the tuna industry, and a few, new modern\nmeans of -- of marketing foods that needed FDA intervention.",

In addition to those two days that I -- I am at the museum, we\nhave meetings on Wednesdays many times. I also take some classes at a Jewish\ncenter in Rockville. Subjects of interest, and of distraction, of -- like music, opera.\nWe\u2019re very avid opera lovers. During the Holocaust I studied violin, so I\u2019m -- I\nlike th-the classical music.

        "A: I was going to -- to go over the last part of my interview for the first person,\nwhere I stopped with the arrival in Israel.",
        "A: And to go over that, a-as we -- I left Cyprus, and f -- January first of 1948 --\n\"49, \u2019'm sorry. December \u201947 -- January first, 1949. We arri -- we proceeded from\nCyprus on a small fishing boat that came from Israel with permit to fish in Turkish\nwaters, which 1s the northern part of Cyprus, and by prearrangement with the help\nof the Greeks on the island, th-the ship -- th-the fishers-man came close to the\nnorthern edge of Cyprus, with flashlights and signs and inflatable boats. They\npicked us up from the shore where the Greeks brought us and put us on that\nfishing boat named Karishe, and took us to Israel. Over there the British were still\ncontrolling the Haifa port, and we had to find a place where to land, which was in\nNetanya.",
        "A: It -- it was about 80 - 90 people, because the exits or the escapes from the\nCyprus camps were arranged of -- consisted of eight to 10 people per night.",
        "A: Once outside, the Greeks would pick us up and take us into an orange grove by\nthe warehouse and lock us up there, so all day we could not come out, but at night\nthey would come open the doors and we roamed somehow, in the orange grove.",
        "A: Okay, the fishing boat dropped us off on Netanya. They have -- two buses\nwaited for us with food, clothes, blankets, whatever we could use, and took us 12\nor 15 mile eastward, right across from Netanya, a pla -- a place called Baykleet.\nThat was a -- a place where -- of induction to the im -- Israeli army. As a former\nCyprus senior officer in the Haganah, I was immediately put in charge of\ninducting a-all sorts of newcomers with my several languages that I spoke,\nRomanian, Hebrew, French and some German, I was able to make the proper\narrangements for these youngsters and keep them there for a while. The policy\nwas that for -- to interview these youngsters and see what their future plans are,\nand send them to units where they could begin into that line of work. I was kept\nthere til March the 15\" or eight -- 16\", and as I ex-expressed my desire to study\nmedicine, I was assigned to a military hospital. Was a formerly British hospital,\nand the hospital was called Tel HaShomer. Tel Levinsky that became Tel\nHaShomer. And that\u2019s where I spent my next 30 month in Israel. At this hospital I\nwas supposed to be a -- every two month at a different, or a specialty wards, but I\nstarted at orthopedics, and s-so -- liked it so much that I stayed there all the time.\nOrthopedics and paraplegics. And it was enough t-to come in contact with Israeli\nveterans or wounded soldiers, to become so convinced that -- of our righteous\nbattle. All they wanted, these amputees and paraplegics, they wanted to get well\nso they can go back to the front and fight again. Ah --",
        "A: Of course --",
        "A: -- of course. That\u2019s what kept them alive, the hope to get better, for a purpose.\nThe same time we had new immigrants from Arab countries that -- that were so\ndeprived of medical attention that some of them were absolutely paralyzed, or --\nor -- they couldn\u2019t function. One particular case I remember, a young kid that\nwould walk only on four, knees and hands and he was brought to us from Yemen\n[indecipherable]. And, smart little kid, but he just couldn\u2019t walk, and ma -- Dr.\nGoldman called me and had a little talk with me that if I agree and go along with\nhim to do what he asks me to, I would -- we could make that child walk again.\nAnd we talked to -- the first thing he said, the first problem I have is you have to\nsleep with him, in the same room. And during the days we\u2019 ll operate and at night\nhe is all yours. So within a short period of time we realized -- we obtained that we\n-- we realized that, and the child started walking with crutches and\n[indecipherable] but ultimately he walked with one cane.",
        "A: That\u2019s just one example. Other examples were that many of the high officers in\nthe military came to that hospital for injuries in the back and the knees. I\nremember [indecipherable] Long was one of the patients, I guess, Dayan and some\nother big officers as well, as Holocaust survivors. What was his name, he was\ninvolved in the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Not [indecipherable] Levitz, but his\ndeputy. [indecipherable]. So, that\u2019s where I spent three month in Israel, during\nwhich time my family started coming ba -- over from Romania in 1949, My sister\ncame, married, with her child. In 1950 my parents arrived and in 1951 my other\nsister. One brother stayed in Romania til 1959 and ha -- arrived later.",

        "A: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: In fact, 12 - 13 or 15 hours a day that I u-used to work brought me to\nexhaustion and the doctors would send me to Jerusalem for 10 - 15 days of R and\nR. And those days I would visit the university, which was then at [indecipherable |\na big Catholic school that was changed -- was given to the university for beginners\nand just visitor -- visiting students. That was part of the R and R in Jerusalem, so\nthat after two years of compulsory military in the hospital, they asked me to stay\nlonger, and I stayed another six months, to make it into 30 months service. And\nthat was the end of 1951 already, that I realized that the university in Jerusalem\nhad no medical school or no beginning of medical school. They had many\nstudents that started out abroad, and only with the third year they would start them\nin the hospital, supervised by famous doctors and this way progress towards\ngraduation. But the first two years they couldn\u2019t have, they needed dissections.\nThe Orthodox Jews wouldn\u2019t allow Jews to be dissected. That\u2019s --",

        "A: No.",
        "A: In Europe and Romania, I graduated from high school with a baccalaureate it\u2019s\ncalled, a high school diploma. And realizing all this and being in correspondence\nwith a brother I had in Detroit, who arrived there in 1946, maybe \u00b047, I cannot\npinpoint it, but I corresponded with him and explained the condi -- situation and\nhe brought up the idea of coming here. And I liked it, and I prepared for it in a\nsense. I started all the necessary arrangements for going to America.",
        "A: Yes, they all agreed that it\u2019s rough, tough, and I\u2019m still young to recoup, or\nrecover. So, late in 1951, I started the preparations or investigations into -- for\ngoing to America. Immediately I got me a English teacher, for more -- better\nEnglish. I started the passport applications and visas for the Americans. First they\nindicated I get the visa and get to America and there si -- approach the college.\nThen they informed me that no, it\u2019s the other way around. First you have to be\naccepted by a school in the United States, and on that basis we can grant you a\nvisa for a student. In Detroit my brother had a brother-in-law who was a professor\nat Wayne State University, and he made all these arrangements on the basis of that\nhigh school diploma and obtained from them a letter that I am accepted for the\nsemester beginning on September 12 or so, 1952. But nothing was ready in Israel\nfor me to go. So I visited the American embassy, undergo -- went a test in\nEnglish. All arrangements began to s -- to -- to shape up to the point where I\nreceived a visa and we bought a ticket at TWA and started my trip on November\nthe second of 1952.",
        "A: 1950 they arrived.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It had to be, but they themselves were in bad shapes, really. All they could\nafford or find were very limiting -- limited housing conditions. The first sister that\ncame in \u00b049 had a one room apartment. It\u2019s the same room with -- 1950 my\nparents arrived -- had to stay with them for awhile. Then the parent moved out and\nthe other sister arrived. When her husband realized what\u2019s going on, he took off\ninto the desert, to B\u2019eyr-Sheva, and there he found all they wanted. A lot of work -\n- he was in the building area, the building business, and he build up th-the Negev,\nthe desert, all the way to the Dead Sea, kibbutzim and so on. So slowly, slowly\nthings settled in Israel, but my going was part of their settlement and after leaving\nthe hospital and [indecipherable] to take off for America, I was unemployed -- oh,\nno, I worked for the [indecipherable] right in Jaffa, where my parents lived.",
        "A: The [indecipherable] is the organization of all the Yishuvim, of all the Israeli\nkibbutzim and moshavim and all sorts of settlements, they are the government\u2019s\narm that supplies them with administration and also money, funds for all the\nnecessities. Ag -- agriculture implements, agricultural implements, modern\nagriculture -- tractors, plowshares, a-all sorts of things. And I worked there for\nfour or five month. And -- while taking steps towards my leaving. The trip itself\nwas problematic. At the time there were no straight flights --",

        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: The European experience plus the Cyprus retention of our going -- one year in\nCyprus was enough to -- to store up venom, or -- or ambition to get out, do\nsomething more. And I did all I could during these 30 month, that\u2019s why I stayed\nlonger, because I saw what is needed. But at that point I realized that there\u2019s very\nlittle I can do at the higher level, that I can do there, even though I travel and\ntoured and visited all that historic places, and the military places where famous\nbattles took place. Traveled the country it -- north and south, a lot to\n[indecipherable]. And more and more I became convinced that if I stay at that\npoint, I can work at the [indecipherable]. I spent some time in Jerusalem taken just\na biolo -- biology classes, more or less unrelated to medicine.",
        "A: I did at that point -- more personally I was sure, or felt I can do a lot for these\nwounded people. And all my superiors at the hospital called me Dr. Haim and\nthey thought I could make -- I would make a big -- a good doctor.",
        "A: No, it was not going to happen.",
        "A: Reality came in the first week in America, that in America you don\u2019t just go to\nmedical school from high school as you do in Romania, as my wife went for -- at\nthe age of 17 she went to medical school.",
        "A: In America you go into pre-med, and that takes four years.",
        "A: And after that, if you push and qualify -- I kept applying for medical schools.\nSo I -- I started this four year of pre-med, and I started liking it because at Wayne\nUniversity -- number one, I arrived in November the fourth or fifth, into a\nsemester that started September 15. And it was way up above my possibilities to\ncatch up and do any good. S-So they put me into an English for foreign students,\nwhich 1s for no credit and it doesn\u2019t matter how well you do. I was able to do very\nwell, especially in the writing, and I had to take a class on government, which was\ntotally strange to me. One -- 1n the -- in history, but European history, it was easy\nfor me. And from November til January the 15\" or 20\", when the semester ended,\nthat was a real killer.",
        "A: Unbelievable. That\u2019s the story of America. If I had the -- the money, I would\nhave turned around and gone right back.",
        "A: Back to Israel.",
        "A: On the first half a year or one year.",
        "A: Such a --",
        "A: -- difficult, difficult obstacles.",
        "A: And money-wise, I did not come with money. My brother who came to pick\nme up and did all these things preparing for me, he was not well-to-do, and I felt\nvery bad and very guilty and was ready to do anything.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Really, clearly, I don\u2019t know, but we had an uncle that had the business in\nDetroit, but he lived in New York, and so my brother, somehow, managed his\nbusinesses. Business was in the manufacturing of shuffleboard --",
        "A: -- equipment.",
        "A: Yes. Horrible, because some of these shuffleboards were installed in bars and\nin -- and I had to go with my brother and collect. If you know the shuffleboard,\nyou open the box and you count the money and half goes to the bar, and half --",
        "A: Games.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And people --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was be -- starting -- becoming a lot simpler and easier. In the meantime I -\n- I met some other Israeli students at the university. A lot of Jewish students came\nto us. Detroit had something called a ZOA house, the Zionist Organization of\nAmerica house. And every weekend they would -- all the Zionists would meet\nthere, but on weekends they would give it to us and we brought together all the\nIsraelis and all the American Jewish students, and we sang, we danced, we ate, we\nfraternized. The whole atmosphere became warmer and more reliable, and more --\nyou could turn to any of these American students for orientation, for advice,\netcetera.",
        "A: Start to feel more comfortable. Classes were easier. At the university, every\nstudent is assigned to an advisor, and mine was a Dr. Theodoro. Dr. Theodoro was\nthe daughter of the ambassador from Thailand and London. So he-her teacher was\nChaim Weitzman. When I came to her with my name of Haim, she -- come from\nIsrael, she caught me, you don\u2019t want to study medicine, you want to study\nmicrobiology, because you\u2019re going back to the Hebrew references of Chaim\nWeitzman and tell me more of what you did. He was her professor, but Chaim\nWeitzman worked with an organism, a bacterium that he forced into producing\nacetone. The bacterium is called Clostridium acetobutylicum Weitzmani.",
        "A: The -- this organism, if you feed it whatever is good for -- it prefers, this\nbacterium, it produces acetone and butyl alcohol, or Vitamin Bz. Chaim Weitzman\nwas able to inhibit its second part production and en -- and encourage it to\nproduce acetone, which the British needed in World War I. And for that he was\nrewarded with a Balfour Declaration.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I know of his activities, and he was the first president of Israel, and very active\nin -- in the process of obtaining independence from Britain. But all this personal\nconnection of this Dr. Theodoro with him, and now with me, indeed. So she\nguided me into microbiology. I took a lot of classes in it throughout the four year\nstudies towards a Bachelor of Science. And just because I had such choices, I took\nall sorts of classes that I liked in psychology and logic. French. French was\nsomething that I knew well so I took classes in order to raise my grade average.\nIndeed, 1t worked. But she wanted me to work with that organism, but this time to\ndo the opposite, inhibit its production of acetone and encourage its production of\nVitamin B2. Very important in Asia and Europe, too. But that was for graduate\nschool, later on.",
        "A: Ah, in the meantime in Detroit, as I said, I began teaching Hebrew.",
        "A: To various Hebrew or Jewish synagogues.",
        "A: Such as Temple Beth El, a Reform synagogue, and Temple Emmanuel, another\nReform synagogue. Jews that wanted to be Jewish, you know. That was my\ngreatest disappointment, that Israelis, or Hebrew teachers that they had, locals,\nwouldn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t want to teach in Reform synagogues. And I was so mad, I went\nto st -- teach at the Reform. And I\u2019m glad to this day that a lot of kids were so\ncurious about their Jewishness, and whatev -- in -- in -- to the degree, or to th --\nway beyond what they saw in the house.",
        "A: They wanted to know more, and that\u2019s what I was teaching them. Anyway, the\nsecond job [indecipherable] at Temple Emmanuel was part already of the United\nHebrew Schools. In all of Detroit there were United Hebrew Schools. United\nHebrew Schools you can be a teacher if you attend a Hebrew academy, or\nMidrasha to get a Hebrew teacher\u2019s certificate. So you take some education\nclasses at the university, and Hebrew classes at the Midrasha, and become a\nHebrew teacher, a certified Hebrew teacher. And I did that. And also within the\nUnited Hebrew schools, with all the Israeli students that functioned as teachers,\nwe had a group of -- a choir and dancers, and we would travel around all the small\ncommunities in Michigan, and perform for them.",
        "A: I did, too.",
        "A: A singer, a dancer, everything, like --",
        "A: -- to bring some Israeliskind they used to call it. In the summers I used to work\n[indecipherable] I was playing with the idea of going back. M-My brother --",
        "A: Oh, yes. My brother was employed by the -- by our uncle, but it didn\u2019t do\nmuch and his income was very limited.",
        "A: A wife, a child.",
        "A: And I was talking about leaving, because as a foreign student you\u2019re not\nallowed to work, and it -- if they -- 1f you get -- you come up to a B average, you\ncan get a permit for 10 - 12 hours a -- a week to work. So with my brother, we\ndiscussed this -- this, and the only arrangement [indecipherable] him is to go back\nto what he knows best, and that is to open a store, a dry goods store.",
        "A: Like in Romania, and I can work there unofficially.",
        "A: Only the first six months, maybe. And then I just moved to a family that rented\nout rooms.",
        "A: One room, one. They usually would have one student.",
        "A: Yes, he did that.",
        "A: He opened a store in 1953, late in \u201953. And after classes I would go to the\nstore, send him home to help in the house with the child. And that started opening\nup th-the possibility of doing something.",
        "A: In Detroit.",
        "A: On Third Street.",

        "A: -- and very nice, and the main business is on the weekend and so I could work\nfor 12 hours and keep it [indecipherable] became very -- did very well, to the\npoint where some years later 1t developed into a wholesale -- to a distributor --\ndistribution import and --",

And\nin \u201957, I started the graduate school, with this Dr. Theodoro, with the organism\nwhat -- that I mentioned. No need to mention it again. And we worked on it, and I\ntook a trans -- graduate classes. We worked on it for six, eight months, when she\nreceived a Fulbright scholarship to go back to Oxford and study there with Dr.\nKrebs. Weitzman was no longer there. Famous name, Dr. Krebs.",
        "A: Krebs cycle, you heard of the Krebs cycle, yes.",
        "A: I have a book from that period, Dr. Krebs signature. So she went away and\nturned me over to another professor, Dr. Matman. This -- Dr. Theodoro was a\nphysiologist of bacteria, and Dr. Matman was more of a clinical, so when she\nswitched me to another thesis [indecipherable] but also with a organism that is\nanaerobic, lives in the absence of air. And what happened, the same, I worked in\nthe store, I taught Hebrew, and attended classes. But in 1956, before she left, she\nmade me into a laboratory assistant, and Dr. Rose -- Ross -- Rosen -- Gosen, he\nliked me, he wanted me as a laboratory assistant, but I couldn\u2019t become an\nemployee of the university without citizenship. And so within a few months he\narranged my conversion into a green card American citizen.",

        "A: -- when consumed with canned foods or other foods. The question was --\nMichigan was basically a dairy college or university and the question was whether\nthis Clostridium botulinum would grow in milk. But the Clostridia have two\nkinds, one that spoils the milk and one that doesn\u2019t spoil the milk, but they both\nproduce a highly potent toxin. So my project was to work with the Clostridium\nbotulinum type E, the one that does not curd the milk, and see whether it will\ngrow at the refrigeration temperature, and -- before spoiling the milk. So we did a\nlot of work on that when suddenly s -- all around the Great Lakes, a large die off\nof seagulls were washed off 0 -- on the shore. And all over Michigan there were\nsmokers that smoked fish and sold them open on the roadside in stores. But when\nthe plastic -- plastics came out, they started packing these smoked fish in plastics,\nunder vacuum, and that\u2019s exact the conditions that promote growth of this\nbacterium --",
        "A: -- to the point where it produces toxin, and if it\u2019s that type that doesn\u2019t spoil the\nmilk, it does not show any decomposition. So people would eat and become sick\nand die. There were quite a few deaths in Michigan due to these smoked fish pla --\npacked in plastic bags. One particular case of three ladies having brunch together\nwhere they ate some such fish or tuna. And the next day two of them were dead.\nOne was dead immediately, one died in the hospital, a third one survived. And the\n-- the FDA in Detroit was in charge of this case. But this was already late, in 1965,\n64, that two ladies died, one survived, and FDA in Detroit is investigating this\ncase. Investigating means first thing go to their house and see what else there is\nthere. They found a lot of cans and a lot of products that all had these toxin. Now\nthe people in Detroit and the FDA didn\u2019t have any idea of how or what to do.\nThey went to Wayne State University, and at Wayne they told them, look, we\nhave a -- we had a person qualified to talk to you, but he is now at Michigan State\ndoing -- working exactly on the same general situation. So they came to Michigan\nState and there I showed them how to do, what to do, etcetera, etcetera, until my\nprofessor walks out of the laboratory and they said to me [indecipherable] person,\nhe says Haim, you have to come and work for us. Forget this classes here, and\ncome to us. And he kept coming every other week, every week and asking me,\njust don\u2019t -- why won\u2019t you come down to Detroit, see what we are talking about.\nSo I did, after I talked to some other professors. And there he tells me, and I tell\nhim what to do, he tells me what needs to be done. But when all is -- this is over,\nwe need to do some other work with E. coli and salmonella and all such cases.\nAnd I say no, not for me. I\u2019m strictly working with this Clostridtum botulinum. So\nhe calls up Washington and the division director asks him to talk -- to give me the\nphone to talk, and he talks to me about -- first he asks me are you married? No.\nPerfect. Smart [indecipherable] whatever he said. But he started enumerating the\nthings that they want to do here. And they have -- just starting to organize one\nlaboratory with -- and they have one person already from [indecipherable]\nDietrich who worked on this and they are looking all over the country. So, really,\nthey made me such offers I couldn\u2019t refuse. Early in 1965, we -- I -- w-we\narranged a meeting in New Jersey, a convention. And there I met with them and\nagain, they emphasized all the possibilities, you know, the activities, and what we\ncan do and what we need to do, etcetera, etcetera. And there I was fresh with this\nexperience from Detroit and at Michigan. And -- and they thought I\u2019m gonna open\nup the place for them. We started investigating, first of all the smoke-fish industry,\nwhich was completely closed down, FDA came out with a clear arrangement,\nevery one of these small places that smoke fish, just by touching, and ba -- just\nestimating. Some arrangements were made with the banks, or with the department\nHHS, or -- for them to be compensated or bought out, and only a few large\ncompanies in Chicago and New York were allowed to take all these little places\nand develop a program that will assure a safe product. There was one incident,\nhorrible incident. This smoked fish was tr -- sent out from Michigan to Kroger\nstores in the south, Tennessee, Arkansas. And the truck driver started out in\nMichigan, that suddenly the refrigeration broke down. When he realized it, it was\nalready 10 - 12 hours, but he pulled into a garage and they started fixing it. Fixing\nit, cooled up the -- cooled off th-the truck and the products, and -- and proceeded\nto deliver the product cold, refrigerated, as though nothing happened.

        "A: And oh, wherever I was, at a coffeehouse, at a -- oh, maybe that\u2019s an aspect\nthat needs to be covered --",
        "A: -- because when we started the Soviet Jewry activities and the Jewish\nCommunity Council was adamantly against us, we are disturbing the -- we voted\nourselves into that Jewish Community Council, and there were plenty of other\nmembers that sided with us, and we were able to bring about, by democratic\nvoting, activities that we wanted the Council to do, and indeed they did. And they\napproached this Soviet Jewry activities and protest as a community -- experience\nin community involvement. From Orthodox to Reform, we had more help from\nthe Reform synagogues than from the others, and financially they said anything\nyou need, we can help you. We needed to -- mailings and rallies and such\norganizations that needed money and they supplied us very nicely. The\nWashington Hebrew congregation specifically gave us money and told us clearly,\nwhatever you need, you tell us. I was already prepared and understood that th --\nthis Reform movement in this city, or in this country, and I knew that they are\nwith us, just as in Detroit, I was with them.",
        "A: And they are looking for causes --",
        "A: -- to get involved in.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: In fact, when I came to Washington, I taught at the Temple Sinai for one year.\nIt was late for them to prorate me into the Hebrew curriculum, but I taught history\nand [indecipherable] Bible. Prophets, specifically. Presently I\u2019m ba -- the treasurer\nof an Orthodox congregation on 16\" Street. But I feel fine in any denomination.\nAnyone that wants to be Jewish, and wants to experience Jewishness, is fine with\nme.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Maybe you know mor -- Marty Goldman, he is in charge of the Holocaust\nSurvivors.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And way back when I was the chairman of The Coffeehouse, Marty met his\nwife there, and -- but before that he also became interested and involved -- in fact,\nat some point, when I could no longer do that, he took over the chairmanship of\nThe Coffeehouse. And with him I would e-explain and talk about my experiences.\nSo when he became the chairman of the Holocaust Survivors, he -- every time we\nhad a meeting -- chance to meet, he would explain to me that I need to join his\ngroup as a survivor. Like my wife said I didn\u2019t feel like I went through the\nHolocaust horrors, cause with all the difficulties, our father c -- walked us through\nthe Holocaust in safety. So I kept telling him that, presently I\u2019m with the FDA and\nwhen I retire, I\u2019m coming to volunteer there. And he kept after me, and he was\naware of my interviews, and of the Shoah Foundation interview. And before I\nretired, I called him and I --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, I arranged to visit --",
        "A: -- him on January the fifth, I retired on January the third. During that week, I\nguess, I met with Marty. He took me over to the library and the archives and made\nthem an offer, he said, they can\u2019t refuse; a Romanian speaking volunteer. And\nsure enough, Henry Mayer, in charge of the archives explained to me that they\nhave a large volume of Romanian documents, tapes, that need translation and they\ndon\u2019t have any translator. So we started out with a short project of five tapes and\nanother one, six - seven tapes and now I\u2019m in a project of 1944 - \u00b045 already, 17\ntapes in that series that need translation. In the meantime they -- they send me 12\ndepositions of the Gypsies in Romania that were transported to Transnistria, and\nnow they are about to receive German compensation. So they picked th-the 12\nmost violent ones that I translated and they are very, very happy, or so -- satisfied\nwith that [indecipherable] I arranged that in a way that the importance is stressed.",
        "A: I mean, they picked only the most egregious cases.",
        "A: Where Gypsies lived -- they\u2019re either traveling from place to place --",
        "A: -- or they settled in one place in housings, but to get them out, th-the Romanian\nNazis burned their villages. And they came out and they transported them to\nTransnistria.",
        "A: They were done in Romania.",
        "A: 2000. Ni --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: 2000 - 2001. But they picked the 12 most grave -- grav -- and I translated them\nin a way that they could see exactly what they did to them.",
        "A: It\u2019s very rewarding in the sense that it will become available in English. Not in\ndetail, but only in titles, or summaries of the Jewish suffering in Romania during\nthe war. The -- th-the -- the secrets or th-the -- the way they -- they brought about\nthe loss of 400,000 Jews in Romania during these years, every new laws that they\ncould use to -- to obstruct and to prevent Jews from just living normal lives.\nProfessionals expelled from their professions, assets were nationalized, or -- as\nthey called it. Romanians were allowed to buy Jewish properties for very minimal\nprices, then rent them out to the Jews. Even some that didn\u2019t -- the la -- the -- the\nrules were -- th-the laws were called, for people who didn\u2019t have any housing, to\ntake over the Jewish houses. But these were just making business out of it, even\nthough they had wonderful houses, they took over from the Jews, and rented them\nout to Jews. They would advertise them as such, Jews preferred, and exorbitant\nprices, and just made out a -- a business out of it. All sorts of aspects are --\natheistic Jews -- Jews or a -- or non-Jews, they were still considered Jews for\ndeportation. And a bunch, a large number of baptized Jews, baptized to either\nGreek Orthodox or Catholic, and the Catholic Nuncio and the Pope insisted that\nthey are Catholics and they are not to be treated or mistreated as Jews. But the\nGreek Orthodox, they insisted that they -- if they claim to be Christian, they\nshould be deported as -- to go out and a-as -- what do you call it, to proselytize\nother Jews in Transnistria. So that was their position. And certain pogroms in\nKishinev and in Iasi. The one in Iasi, I personally experienced, in hiding. And a\nlot of things that even though I was youngster and lived there during these years, I\ndid not understand it, and did not know it exactly the way it happened, until I meet\nit, or find it now in the Romanian text that I translate into English.",

It was -- Bivolari is one long\nstreet, unpaved, and muddy in the spring. So he should go, he should see it, and\nsee the rest of the s -- country. It\u2019s a beautiful country, no question. But I want to\nshow him Iasi, where the pogrom took place, that house where we lived, the place\nwhere my brothers were almost killed. Maybe Bucharest. We went from Bivolari\nto Iasi to Bucharest to Cyprus to Israel to Detroit.",
        "A: It\u2019s a long journey.",
        "A: That takes away years. And here I am, I need to make it up and at the FDA, I\nreally developed for all these years. The 60\u2019s, we -- we put some sense and some\nsecurity, safety, into the fish industry. In the 70\u2019s we had the -- the mushroom\nindustry, was poisoning people all over the country. In the 80\u2019s, we had the\nsalmon industry, that we regulated. You know, the salmon industry is the larg --\nthe only country in the world that produces that much salmon, all around the\nworld, except that the canning it -- of 1t was so primitive that they used to make a -\n- th-the cans, flatten them without the top or the bottom, and take them to Alaska,\nand there press into th-the -- the bottom of the can, fill the can, put the top and\n[indecipherable] it. Well, people died. In London and Belgium and Australia, all\ndue to American salmon. So FDA was able to a-abolish that system and FDA\nhired additional inspectors, about 600 of them to go around and look for these\ncans, and these cases. And finally we came about a safe product, the canning\nindustry, the -- the salmon industry, the tuna industry, and a few, new modern\nmeans of -- of marketing foods that needed FDA intervention.",

        "A: To the extent that\u2019s possible. In Bivolari there was no time and no means, but\nstill my father was involved with the community affairs, with the synagogue.",
        "A: But that\u2019s -- was enough for me to see that in spite of this need and activities,\nthat he was involved in, just to keep a family of five alive.",

In addition to those two days that I -- I am at the museum, we\nhave meetings on Wednesdays many times. I also take some classes at a Jewish\ncenter in Rockville. Subjects of interest, and of distraction, of -- like music, opera.\nWe\u2019re very avid opera lovers. During the Holocaust I studied violin, so I\u2019m -- I\nlike th-the classical music.

We had, starting in \u201965, an organization of -- a long name -- of the\nIBRCC, the botulism research organization. But it met -- meets once a year. I\nmade sure that it\u2019s not during Jewish holidays, cause we meet in the fall. And I\nwrote a history of that organization because I participated in it from the beginning.\nSo this is what I leave as a -- these publications and leadership in that\norganization. So --",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Comes out of there.",

        "A: That is another problem.",
        "A: And we need s -- rapid tests to detect it and products that might have the\npoison.",
        "A: Right now at -- most of FDA\u2019s activities in the field are directed to rapid\nmethods of detection, and the military is doing vaccinations. Like, I\u2019m\nimmunized. When I worked with it, I was immunized to the point that even if I\nmake a mistake or injure myself, I would be immune to it.",
