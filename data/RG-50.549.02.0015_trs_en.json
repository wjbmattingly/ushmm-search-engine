        "Question: This is tape one of an interview with Hanne Leibmann in her home in Bayside,\nQueens, for the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum. And the interviewer is Joe\nRichmond. Let\u2019s start -- let\u2019s start going all the way back, just talking about your family a\nlittle bit. Just tell me briefly who was in your family, your --\nHanne Leibmann: In my family at what time? At what point of time?",
        "Q: Before the war, when you were growing up.\nHL: When I was growing up, okay, how far do we go back?",
        "Q: As far as you want to go back.\nHL: Well, I was born in 1924 and you have that on some of the tapes already. And at the\ntime I was born, I obviously had a mother. I had a father, I had a brother three and a half\nyears older. However, my father died in 1925, about three months after I was born, so I\ngrew up in a one parent household, okay? My fath -- my mother maintained my father\u2019s\nbusiness, which was a photo studio, okay. At the time my father passed away, we still\nhad an art gallery as well, which my mother gave up around 1926, because she could not\nmaintain a business and an art gallery and two children and everything else. Besides, at\nthat point in Germany, after the inflation, the art business was not the hottest item\nanyway. So I grew up like any other child, okay. My mother had several sisters. She had\nthree that lived in the city where I was born. She had a -- equally a brother who lived in",
        "Q: Did you mention your brothers and sisters?\nHL: My brother -- I had only one brother, three and a half years older, as I said and well,\nwe grew up like all children do, I suppose. I remember the rise of Hitler, I remember the\nstreet fights in the 20\u2019s. Our place was next to a left wing newspaper and there were a lot\nof street fights and shootings and flag burnings. And these are some of my earliest\nchildhood memories. Included in that is the people who came begging for food to our\napartment door. Carts going through the street, horse drawn carts going through the\nstreet, collecting clothes for the poor. It was a very, very bad time in Germany. Hitler\ncame to power, I remember April one 1s the boycott. I remember that very well. Went to\nschool, public school. There was some harassment, obviously there was harassment of a -\n- of us kids in the street. I did not have Gentile girlfriends, probably, after 1935, because\nit became too dangerous for them, as well as for us. And my mother had Gentile friends t-\nto the very end. Til the day we were deported, we had Gentile friends who came to our\nhouse at night, in the dark, when it was, you know, what do you call it? Brown out here?\nBlack-out? Black-out, really. And school, of course, for us Jewish kids, we had to leave\npublic school in 1936 and go to an all Jewish school. Many of the larger cities already\nhad established Jewish schools -- long established Jewish schools. Karlsruhe did not, so",
        "Q: Let me sto -- w-what was your brother\u2019s name?\nHL: My brother\u2019s name was Alex. His full name was Alexander. Okay, but he was\nreferred to as Alex.",
        "Q: And your maiden name was Hiss -- Hiss --\nHL: Hirsch, yeah. October 22nd we were deported. We were the second deportation out\nof Germany, the first one having been from Stettin to Lublin in February of 1940. Of\ncourse, previously, in \u00b038, the Polish - Jewish people who had lived in Germany had been\ndeported to Poland. And that was this miserable situation, they did not have a qua -- they\ndidn\u2019t have -- they had not acquired German citizenship and the Polish government said,",
        "Q: Did you know at that point on the train, did you know -- did you know --\nHL: Where we were going?",
        "Q: Where you were going, what was happening, [indecipherable] be?\nHL: Not at all. Most people did not know. My mother and I knew that we were going to\nthe south of France. And we knew, because the morning of the deportation, my mother\nsent me to a Mrs. Fite, okay? These were very decent people. And my mother was\nfriendly with them to the very last. And she told me to bring them certain items from our\nhousehold which they very much liked. It was Bohemian glass, it was very -- a crystal, it\nwas very beautiful stuff. And she said, \u201cGo over there, bring it to them and come right\nback.\u201d And so I did and when I came to Mrs. Fite, she told me, \u201cMy husband said you\nwill be going to the south of France.\u201d But of course we didn\u2019t know, what does it mean\nthe south of France? Where were we going to be, right? And I came home and told my\nmother and she said, \u201cYou crazy.\u201d Okay\u201d? Because she fully expect to be -- expected to be\ntaken to a concentration camp in Germany or even to Poland, because we knew already\nfrom the people who had been deported from Stettin, that they were taken to Lublin. So\nour expectations were not the south of France and my mother said, \u201cYou\u2019re\n[indecipherable]. We did go to France, but what was going to happen to us -- I mean it\nwas very obvious once the train went, you know, was set in motion and we were going\nwest, that we were not going to go -- let\u2019s say Dachau, which is in Germany or any of the\nother camps, right? And indeed, we were taken to France. And on the train we were\nallowed to take with us 100 marks. Our money was changed into French francs. We got\n2000 French francs for the 100 marks, which was a pittance. So the trip took three days",
        "Q: Most of what I know is from your -- 1s from your interviews. So tell -- so tell me in\nyour -- in your experience.\nHL: My experience, well, like everybody who got there, six and a half thousand people\ngot there, was utter confusion. Totally -- most of the people were totally traumatized.\nUnderstandably so, right? First of all the three -- three day trip. Then we were taken off\nthe train in open trucks, in pouring rain. From the railroad station in Orlong San Marie, to\nGurs is about 15 kilometers. Not terribly far, right? But enough to be thoroughly soaked.\nThe camp itself was built on a land that had been completely deforested. There were no\ntrees. There are trees today, but that\u2019s 50 years or 60 years later. And the ground was\nmud. It was real mud, like -- clay-like sort. And of course, with the rain, this became an\nimpossible situation. So here we came to the place already, we stepped right into the\nmud, right? The barracks were totally empty. They were wooden structures, only\ntarpaper, no windows. There were no windows. We had flaps that could be opened, but\nyou had to prop them up. Now if you opened the window -- so-called window, right, it\nwould rain in. You closed it, you were without air and light. Had a door on each end -- at\neach end and -- there comes my husband -- and --",
        "Q: Pll stop the tape for a -- we\u2019re back. So yeah, just the -- the daily life and the\nconditions [indecipherable] talking about.",
        "Q: So -- so, did you --\nHL: I don\u2019t think there are many camps or you have ever heard that people would --\nsometimes it was a struggle to get people to really pay up, you know, their -- whatever\npercentages it was, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So it was sort -- it was a self government, essentially.\nHL: It was -- a c-certain amount of it was self-government, definitely. Each block -- now\nthe camp had -- was divided by one main road on each side of the main road, where",
        "Q: And you said -- you said, \u201cWe instituted this system.\u201d\nHL: We instituted that system.",
        "Q: Again that was -- that was a system that -- that you had [indecipherable]\nHL: Yeah, but this -- this system had to be approved by the administration. On holidays,\nwhen there was a holiday, you could -- could get out of your block and circulate and",
        "Q: So you describe an admin-administration that was fairly hands off, that just\nHL: It was not entirely hands off. When it came to cultural things they -- they were all\nwith it, because that\u2019s the way the French are, right? There was no problem. You have to\nask my husband, because he worked more in the office than I did. I worked in the office\nin our block. But he was -- in his block he also worked in the office, he was more\ninvolved than I was. My job was more of giving out the mail, running, you know, giving\nout the mail that came. Run the errands, do some statistical work, things like that, you\nknow. Anyway, life in camp was very, very hard. I would not say it was life like you hear\nabout from Auschwitz or any of the other camps. No, that 1t wasn\u2019t. It was tough,\nnevertheless. Once you are a prisoner, you\u2019re a prisoner. So we didn\u2019t have to stand in\nformation, okay? This did not exist. We were counted, however, in the morning. There\nwas a woman who came through the barracks every morning to count us. God forbid if\nshe overlooked a small child, because we had some small children with us and you know\nhow it is, children go always under the blanket, right and she didn\u2019t see them. She was\nmiscount and then she was -- she was just horrible, you know. Screaming, stamping her\nfeet and -- I mean it was just terrible. Totally unnecessary. There were some escapes.\nSome were on -- people were unfortunately caught and brought back. Others made it, that\ndepended on if you had contacts outside, if you spoke the language, if you had money,\nyou knew where you were going. Most of us -- only some young people tried from our",
        "Q: Did you live with your mother at that time and other relatives [indecipherable]\nHL: In -- in Gurs?",
        "Q: In Gurs.\nHL: Yes, with my mother and my three aunts. The first few months I think we were in\nthe same barracks and then my mother and I were shifted over to another barracks, but\nwe were just a couple of -- what, maybe 50 meters, you know, something like that. So\nthat was not a problem.",
        "Q: And communication an-and information?\nHL: Between us? Between the people in each block? Constant communication. What did\npeople have to do other than talk? I mean, let\u2019s face it. My cousin was in the same block,\nmy -- that was the daughter of my mother\u2019s brother. Her mother was in the same block.\nCousins of my mother were in the same block, right? As long as they were female. The\nmales were all in separate blocks. So there was constant communication between us and\nthe other people. Also many times fights. Bread -- distributing the bread. Cutting it into\nportions, because you got the whole loaf, usually was the flashpoint for a fight. Some",
        "Q: Okay, this is side B of tape one, interview with Hanne Leibmann. Okay, you were\nsaying about the social service agencies?\nHL: Do you know my name is misspelled?",
        "Q: Oh, it\u2019s misspelled?\nHL: It\u2019s L-1-e.",
        "Q: Yeah. We\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll fix that on here. It\u2019s spelled about three different ways on these\nforms so, we\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s the right one.\nHL: Possibly with a P too. The social service agencies were very helpful to us. And\nindeed one day a social worker came to my mother and asked me whether she would let\nme go out of the camp to a village called Le Chambon. And by now you must have heard\nabout Le Chambon. There was a concerted effort to get the children and young people\nout of the camp and they started with the younger ones first, because they were in greater\ndanger. Danger of malnutrition, danger of -- you know, I mean the whole thing. So this y\n-- young lady from the OC came around and asked whether she would let me go to that",
        "Q: How long had you been in the camp at that point?\nHL: At the point I left -- well, we got to the -- we were arrested on the 22nd of October\nand arrived in Gurs on the 25th, 1940. I left the camp on the seventh of September, 1941.\nSo, 11 months, little more than -- whatever. More or less. We were four boys and three\ngirls to leave and we came to Le Chambon and that was the most marvelous experience\nanyone could have had, ever. I don\u2019t know if you have seen the documentary, \u201cWeapons\nof the Spirit\u2019? Well, you have to see it to understand what I\u2019m talking about. We were\nplaced in a home that was run by the Swiss Red Cross, children\u2019s division. We were quite\nwell taken care of, under the circumstances. France was very hungry, they had very little\nto eat and even so, we were in the country surrounded by farmers, these farmers were\nvery poor. We had enough to eat, with the exception of one or two of the boys who were\ngrowing like weed and you know how teenagers can eat, like non-stop, 24 hours.\nHowever, we were free. We were in wonderful surroundings, people who appreciated us.\nIt was a flip-flop from Germany. It was a total flip-flop from Germany. After having been\npersecuted, discriminated against, segregated out of society, right? We now where the\npeople -- that we are wanted, right? And no difference was made between the French and",
        "Q: And before you went, how many Jews do you think --\nHL: Live in Chambon today?",
        "Q: No. Were there at that ttme? How many were being hidden?\nHL: The official number is 5000 people. Among the 5000 were Christian people who\nwere persecuted, okay, for one reason or another. Being that they were German Gentiles\nwho had fled into France because of political reasons. People who had become Protestant\nbut were of Jewish background, they had become or were baptized at birth -- we had a\nfriend like that. She was in Le Chambon and she was in a Protestant home. We had all\nsorts of people. The number of 5000 is the accepted number today by the papers, the false\npapers that were issued in the village and the surrounding area. People came, stayed, got\ntheir papers, went on. Because once they had the false identification papers, especially\nwith the French Jews, could maneuver, okay? So, if you figure 5000 people, or\napproximately 5000, to a popu -- equal population of about 5000, this is a tremendous",
        "Q: Before we talk about --\nHL: Yeah.",
        "Q: Your -- your -- about going to Switzerland, tell me h-how you met your husband. You\nmet in -- in the camp.\nHL: We met in the camp, yes.",
        "Q: How did that happen? What hap -- do you --",
        "Q: How did you maintain a courtship, though, in that situation like that, in the camp?\nHL: How -- courtship. I don\u2019t even think it was a courtship. It was a friendship, really.\nYou know young people are sort of drawn together -- yes I fell in love with him, of\ncourse I did. I would be foolish to say not, that I didn\u2019t, right? But it was a totally\nplatonic thing. There was very little privacy, right? Most of the time people saw us with\nhis mother. Some even thought we were brother and sister. You know, I mean it -- s-\nsome others, maybe they found some privacy or were looking for it. We weren\u2019t. And --\nyou know, I speak -- I speak in schools and colleges to the students about this time. And I\nmention my boyfriend became my husband. And not too long ago, in one class at\nQueensboro Community College, one girl in the question and answer session said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know how you could look for a man under these circumstances.\u201d I corrected her\nthat I was not looking for a man, that 1s was totally platonic, which she couldn\u2019t\nunderstand, right? It was almost funny, you know. So -- we kept a cor -- kept up a\ncorrespondence after I left. It\u2019s as simple as that. I always knew where he was, when he",
        "Q: I guess the wi -- 1n a situation like that, you think that there are both advantages and\ndisadvantages to -- to having a new relationship, whether it\u2019s a friendship or a boyfriend -\n- to [indecipherable |\nHL: Or a girlfriend, or whatever.",
        "Q: Or a girlfriend, you know, to hav -- that there -- you know, there are certain\nadvantages in having a close companion and certain fears.\nHL: There is an advantage to having someone, yes, especially if you\u2019re in the same\nsituation, because you\u2019re each other\u2019s support. The same as when you\u2019re a group of\npeople. Like we were seven young people, right? We were each other\u2019s support. There is\nno doubt about it. And it made things easier for us, right -- than being alone. If you\u2019re\ntotally alone, without having this support, right -- it is much more difficult. One of my\nfriends, who came from the camp with me, eventually, after I had left, split from the\ngroup. I\u2019m not quite sure why she split. We assume she had a boyfriend somewheres.\nAnd she split from the group. And I think she -- in that time that she had left the group,\nuntil the end of the war, she suffered more psychological damages than any of us did.",
        "Q: Did you maintain, or do you still maintain contact with other people in this group?\nHL: All of them. All -- all but -- well, one lives in Brazil, I don\u2019t actually have contact\nwith him, but with his twin brother in Paris. One -- we know he came here to this country\nand we have lost track of him. And all the others, yes, of course. Absolutely.",
        "Q: Can you say -- can you say some of their names, just [indecipherable]\nHL: Well, there is Elizabeth Koenig, nee Kauffman, she was with us. She did not come\nfrom Gurs, but she came to us in Le Chambon. She was, by the way, the chief librarian of\nthe Holocaust Museum, til she became too ill and had to retire. There is Wiltrud Lavell,\nnee Eanee. She lives partly here in the States and partly in Spain. There 1s Jack Lewin,\nwho lives right here, out in Long Island. There is Rudy Appel, who was not originally\nfrom Gurs, but came from Rivesaltes. The Atlas boys. Yeah, we all have contact with one\nanother, absolutely. And we wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. It took us a long time to even\nget together, because somewheres along the line we lost each other, because everybody --\nyou know, after they emigrated here, we didn\u2019t all come at the same time. Jack Lewin,",
        "Q: Let\u2019s come back to that a little bit later. L-Let\u2019s keep going on talking about y-you\nmade -- how you made it into Switzerland.\nHL: How I made it into Switzerland? I went on my own.",
        "Q: And -- and -- and -- and why? You -- you -- you [indecipherable |\nHL: I just felt -- well, there were two reasons. First of all, Max had gone there, he was\nthere already. I had made up my mind after I saw my mother being deported that I was\nnot going to stay in France, no matter how safe in Chambon. I just felt -- and I had family\nin -- in -- in Switzerland. So my -- I was focused on Switzerland. One of my friends who\nlives out in Palo Alto, who came with Max from the Jewish boyscout farm outside of\nLyon, we had arguments. He said, \u201cYou go to Switzerland, you go in a mousetrap.\nSomething happens, you are lost there. Come with me, we go to Spain.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to Spain, I go to Switzerland.\u201d So we had arguments back and forth. He went\nexactly to Spain, with the help of the French underground, Madame Philip. His way was\nSpain, North Africa, England, joined the French army in England and came marching\nback into France. He then lived again for sometime in France and then came here to the\nUnited States. So, yes we did have arguments whether we do go to Spain. And from there\non, or to Switzerland. So I chose Switzerland. And my trip to Switzerland, well, I went",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape two, side A, interview with Hanne Leibmann, once again. So we\u2019re\ntalking about your escape into Switzerland.\nHL: My escape into Switzerland -- as I walked along the road, I saw this custom\u2019s office,\nas I mentioned before and I walked past and the officer called me back and asked for my\npapers, which I gave him. And he looked at them and then out of the blue came, \u201cAre\nyou Jewish?\u201d Question I was not prepared for at all. And just as quickly, I answered, in\ngood Nazi propaganda -- and don\u2019t ask me where it came from, I simply said, \u201cI have\nnothing to do with this dirty race.\u201d And he sort of had a ha-half smile on his face and\nsaid, \u201cOkay, you can go.\u201d Whether he believed me or not, I don\u2019t know, but he let me go.\nAnd I walked on and made my way to the priest of the village, the Catholic priests, which\nwas one of my contact points. And he told me to what house I had to go to meet the man\nwho would help me cross the border. This man was hired by my relatives in Switzerland\nto cross me over. He was paid for the job. There were a family there with two boys and\nlater on a single young man whom they had found in the church [indecipherable] the\nstory was and he wanted to cross over into Switzerland. So this night he crossed over six\npeople. He took us -- actually, he was very close to the border. What he did was carry\nacross -- carry us across the water. There was a little stream. He carried us across so we\nwouldn\u2019t get wet. Told us exactly what direction to walk -- now please, this isn\u2019t --\nduring the night, in the dark. In what direction to walk to get the street car that would",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?\nHL: No, not at all. If I ever really knew it. Or if I knew a name, it might not have been his\nreal name, I mean you had to have lots of safeguards. In Anisee when I got off the train, I\nhad to show my papers, right? And police looked at it and said, \u201cGo on.\u201d You know,\nthere was no problem. There were a lot of people and [indecipherable] you know. We\nreached a street car -- we had a few Swiss coins, which the man had given us -- the\npasseur had given us and he told us where to get off, and there would be a person\nstanding there waiting for us, taking us to a little hotel for the night. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. We got off at that point. I don\u2019t remember what the station was from the\nstreetcar. There was a young lady standing there and she took us to this hotel, which\ndidn\u2019t ask for any registration or anything. They must have been, obviously, paid off.\nAnd in the morning she came and picked us up, took us to her house -- to her apartment,\ngave us a breakfast. And I had asked her, as soon as I got off the streetcar, I said, \u201cPlease\ncall my family immediately.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s 11:30 at night.\u201d I said, \u201cPlease, call immediately.\u201d",
        "Q: Let me just go back a little bit.\nHL: Yeah.",
        "Q: You said that you had found out that your -- your mother had died. When did you find\nout and how did you find out after [indecipherable]\nHL: Look, when my mother was deported and we had this hour or so together, she -- my\nmother was a realist. She told me she would never come back, that this was the last trip,\nthat they were certainly going to be taken east and somehow people had a sense for what\nwas going to happen to them. And so, you know, news filtered into Switzerland in \u201843,\nslowly and surely and there was no doubt in my mind that this is what happened. Besides,\nmy mother had diabetes and I never even thought she would make it as far as -- as\nAuschwitz, which she did, unfortunately. In this case, unfortunately [indecipherable]. So,\nto me it was a sure thing.",
        "Q: Were you ever able to find a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you felt that whole time that --\nHL: That my mother was lost, absolutely.",
        "Q: Were you able later on to find out any information about what happened?\nHL: She was indeed -- she made it as far as Aus-Auschwitz and she was killed in\nAuschwitz. Because I looked into the Gedenk book, you know what that is? That\u2019s a\nmemorial book that the German government publishes with all the names of German\nJews that were killed. There\u2019s some mistakes in the book, however, essentially, you can\nfind what you need to find. You can -- the museum has the book. You ask for it up in the\nlibrary, they have it. So, to me, that -- there was -- we knew. There was no doubt in our\nmind, especially people of a certain age. When I saw my mother last, she had already lost\nso much weight. I\u2019d never seen my mother that skinny in her whole life. So how much\nresistance was there left? So living with my relatives was not a good experience, not at\nall. I left them on December 24th and I mention that date because my uncle was\nProtestant, my aunt always remained Jewish and was a member of the Jewish\ncommunity, but he was Protestant, and so Christmas, of course was celebrated because\ntheir sons were raised as Protestants. And my cousin, her middle son, threatened her that\nunless I was out of the house, he would not come for Christmas. And I had already been\nin negotiations with Geneva, where Max was taking a social service course -- to get a job\nthere and the only job I could get was as a maid. And Mademoiselle DeMomela was the",
        "Q: When -- when and why did you decide to -- to leave Switzerland and come to the\nUnited States?\nHL: Switzerland made it very clear to you that you better go on. My husband had a\ncousin in Switzerland, had a clothing factory for men -- men\u2019s clothing. And he could\nhave used him very much, to help him in the factory, in the office and so on and so forth.\nAnd so he asked for permission for us to stay, for him to work. And so the little village\nsaid, oh well, if the contone, which is like the state, right? We\u2019ll go along with that, this is\nfine. Then the contone said well, if the federal government will permit it. And the federal\ngovernment turned around and said, when the -- if the contone will permit it. And wa --\nyou know what it became? A catch 22. And I said, \u201cForget it, we go to America.\u201d I had\nfamily here, right? Max had family in Israel, however this was not an option for us. And s",
        "Q: Why not?\nHL: We just felt we didn\u2019t want to go to Israel. We just felt that was not the place we\nwould want to be. And --",
        "Q: W-W-Why?\nHL: I don\u2019t know whether it actually had to do something with his aunt -- it prob -- aunt\nand uncle, really, because they were not willing to -- to do anything for him, even before\nwe were deported. You have to ask him exactly what went on. And they were not",
        "Q: And what happened when you first arrived?",
        "Q: Wh-What was his job?",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B, interview with Hanne Leibmann. And you were just talking\nabout -- h-how long were you sick for, actually, with TB?",
        "Q: How old was your daughter when you -- when she [indecipherable]\nHL: Came back? Almost seven.",
        "Q: So that must have been very hard.\nHL: It was very hard. You have to find your way back. It\u2019s really -- you know, a\nrelationship has been -- not totally cut of course, but still -- we could see her -- after the\nfirst year we could see her every three months, I think. But a couple of hours is not much,\nright? We would call her every Sunday, 12 o\u2019clock sharp. She knew 12 o\u2019clock on",
        "Q: How did -- how did your experiences during the war affect the way that you sort of\nsaw yourself as -- as a mother or an -- an -- you know, here in the United States, how did\n-- how did that -- you know, color the way that you --\nHL: You mean, did our daughter know what happened to us, did we tell her what\nhappened to us? We didn\u2019t. Well, she asked me one day, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have\ngrandparents?\u201d And she must have been about 10, something like that. And that was an\nunexpected question really, because I\u2019d never thought of it. And I told her, \u201cYour\ngrandparents were killed in a concentration camp.\u201d Now that was a little much for a\nchild, I know that now. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time. And then she didn\u2019t say anything\nany more. And my two aunts were sort of stand in grandmothers, right? She heard us talk\nabout Gurs, definitely. She heard me talk to my aunts when we were talking about things\nin the past. So she always knew this, but we didn\u2019t push it. We did not say to her, like I\nknow from other mothers, \u201cYou have to be very good, because of what happened to us.\u201d\nMm-mm. We did not say, \u201cYou cannot go here or there,\u201d right? \u201cYou cannot have this or\nthat, because we didn\u2019t have that you can be without.\u201d You know. She wanted to go out\nas a teenager or when she went to college, she went to Adelphi. And she wanted to go at\nnight to the city, on Saturday night like all young people. We never said, \u201cYou cannot do\nthat.\u201d I know parents who would not let their children do that. Simply because they felt,\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have it. We had to do without that.\u201d They had no understanding for a normal\nlife of a teenager, right? And they wouldn\u2019t let their children have it. And they really -- a",
        "Q: And why do you think they have these problems?\nHL: Because of the parents, really because the parents were overprotective. I have friends\nwho outright say, \u201cYes, we were overprotective of our children. We wouldn\u2019t let them do\nthis and that and the other thing and we always worried where they were and what they\ndid.\u201d And we just didn\u2019t do that. Or if we worried, we didn\u2019t tell her, and let her -- you\nknow. One night my husband and I had a terrific fight. Why? Because Evelyn decided,\nwith her girlfriend, to go to the city to a hangout. And this hangout was perfectly fine,\nthere was nothing wrong, but it was snowing. It was snowing very heavily. And he -- she\nwanted to go with the car, obviously, from Jackson Heights. I said, \u201cGo take the car. Go.\u201d\nAnd he was upset that in the snow I let her drive and go to city. \u201cThis 1s too dangerous,\u201d\nthis is this, this is that. I said, \u201cYou know what? She wants to do it. If she gets stuck, she\nhas to find a way to come home.\u201d She did. I didn\u2019t say you can\u2019t go, it\u2019s too dangerous,\nor this or that or the next thing. We let -- I let her go, he was -- he was upset about it. But\nI felt that, she\u2019s a young person, she has to find out what she can do, what she can not do.\nAnd we never stopped her from whatever she wanted to do because maybe we\u2019re too\nafraid of it.",
        "Q: When she got older, did you talk to her more and more about your experiences?\nHL: Well, she always knew some of them and eventually -- when we gave the interview\nto the museum, | think it was, she listened to the tape. I said, \u201cWell?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, I",
        "Q: Do you think that you felt differently or taught her differently about things like\nreligion or being Jewish, based on your experiences?\nHL: She had -- she went to Sunday school for a year or two. We are not a religious home,\nright? We are more cultural Jews than religious Jews. Yes, we do observe the holidays,\nright? We will have Passover and we will have people here for Passover or -- for\nPassover or for Rosh Hashanah or whatever, right? Yes, we had Hanukah but we are not,\nas such, religious people. She knows very well where she belongs, okay\u2019? There\u2019s no\nquestion about that. But to me, you know, it is by far more important that someone 1s a\ngood human being, over being very religious and maybe not such a good person. One\ndoesn\u2019t exclude the other, but you know, to me it\u2019s more important.",
        "Q: What -- what do you think may have -- what do you think\u2019s been changed by your\nexperiences during the war in terms of that -- in terms of the way you see religion or\nbeing Jewish? I mean, is th -- are there things that you can --\nHL: I have never been ashamed of being Jewish, I was always so proud of being Jewish. I\nwould never have entertained the thought of conversion of any kind. And by the way, in\nLe Chambon, there was never an attempt by anyone to convert us, right? That was an\nabsolute taboo. Would have been very easy for these people to persuade us, right?",
        "Q: Have you gone back there at all?\nHL: To where?",
        "Q: To either France or Switzerland?\nHL: Oh, to the village? To Le Chambon? Many times. And I must tell you that when I go\nthere, I feel very much at home. I know few people, right, as such. The people that I sort\nof knew have all passed on. But there\u2019s just something about the place that -- well, I feel\nvery much at home. We have not gone back to Gurs, no. By the way, there is nothing\nstanding of the camp, there is only the cemetery, which has been totally redone, partly or\nentirely with money from Germany. And moneys that were raised otherwise, I suppose,\nbut it\u2019s totally redone, it doesn\u2019t look anything like what it originally was. It\u2019s like -- now\nlike a nice military cemetery. So --",
        "Q: You were talking about this group that you were -- that you were with there and then\nyou sort of maintained contact with --\nHL: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- over the years. When you first came to the United States, was that important, to find\npeople who had been through the war and had similar experiences? Or has it been more\nimportant [indecipherable]\nHL: Well, we found many of our friends here, again, friends from before this total\nexperience, you know, having be deported, Gurs and so on. Most of them, my husband\u2019s,\nsome mine. Yeah, it was important to find our friends again. That was definitely\nimportant to us. Many had other experiences. I have friends who went into England with\nthe kinder transport and I found them here again. Others came directly from Germany to\nhere. Others had been in Switzerland. Yeah, it\u2019s important to have your friends and\nfriends with whom you share a past. There is sort of an unspoken, you know, connection.\nYou know, you don\u2019t have to explain to this person how you feel about a certain thing or\na situation or in -- what it was in the past. You don\u2019t have to do that, they know. The ones\nwho don\u2019t know, are the ones who don\u2019t even want to know. Or didn\u2019t want to know\nwhen we first came. When we first came, we were with one of my husband\u2019s friends and\nthey said something and Max says, \u201cWell, I had to go across the Alps -- not the Alps, but\nthrough the mountains.\u201d And the way we came here and so on and [indecipherable] so he\nsort of made a funny joke about a very sad situation and they really didn\u2019t want to know.\nAnd this is the complaint of all survivors, that the people really didn\u2019t want to know. And\nthen I come across American Jewish people, \u201cOh, we didn\u2019t know what went on.\u201d \u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t know what went on, when it was daily in the newspapers? Didn\u2019t you read them?\u201d\nI mean there -- we have volumes of paper clippings from the New York Times, over here",
        "Q: That one of the reasons that --\nHL: The survivors did not talk for so long. They couldn\u2019t and they knew that other\npeople had no -- no understanding, didn\u2019t really want to know. I spoke in a school in\nStaten Island several weeks ago. Jewish school. Not a yeshiva, but a Jewish school. On\nthe line of maybe Hamas. You know Hamas school? They are a wonderful school, Jewish\nschool in the middle of the city, have highly intelligent children there and a wonderful\nstaff of teachers. And this 1s run -- there are boys and girls, so it\u2019s not, you know. But we\nwear long skirts and long sleeves and -- religious. I was over there and I spoke to about\n100 children. And then I asked, \u201cHow many of you have grandparents that are\nsurvivors?\u201d And I would say 70 percent of the kids there had grandparents that were\nsurvivors. And I asked them, \u201cWhat did your grandparents tell you?\u201d Nothing. Nothing.\n\u201cMy grandparents don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d I said, \u201cGo back to your grandparents, make them\ntalk to you and tell you.\u201d I said, \u201cIf you are supposed to remember the Shoah,",
        "Q: Why do you think the grandparents aren\u2019t -- aren\u2019t telling their story?\nHL: I don\u2019t know. They should tell their grandchildren. You have this opposite, the ones\nwho don\u2019t talk and the others who pile it on. Literally. And put a great burden on these\nchildren. It is almost a burden the way they do it. So you have these two opposites.",
        "Q: Do you feel like your experience has been different as a survivor, having been married\nto another survivor?\nHL: You will find most survivors being married to other survivors.",
        "Q: But in your case, you actually had such similar experiences all the way through --\nthrough the war.\nHL: Yeah, and many people met in the DP camps in Germany or even knew each other at\none point or another in the ghettos. Many of them got married in the ghetto, were lucky\nto survive.",
        "Q: Can you explain in your experience why that -- why that\u2019s been so --\nHL: I think again because people were comfortable with each other, not necessarily\nbecause they were terribly in love, but because they wanted someone, right? Someone\nwith the similar experience who understands what this was all about, right? And because\nthey wanted a family. And I don\u2019t think there were many divorces among these survivor\nmarriages. Many of the people already had lost a family. Had lost a wife or a husband",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you want to [indecipherable]\nHL: No, not really.",
        "Q: Post war experiences?\nHL: No.",
        "Q: No?\nHL: Not really. At war\u2019s end -- when the war was over. The day it was announced on the\nradio and I listened to the speech of King George and I just understood enough English to\nunderstand what he was saying. We were in a refugee home in Shesare, where we had\nthis horrible woman in charge of the home. I must tell you, I felt totally drained. It was a\nbeautiful, sunny day. And here were the Alps in full sunshine and I felt totally drained. It\nwas not hooray the war was over. We had lost everyone and everything. The last one to\ndie was my brother in 1945 in the Battle of the Bulge. So we felt drained. There was no\njubilation. Not a -- for any of us. You would think people would have been totally happy\nand s -- no. Mm-mm. In fact, we have a picture somewheres -- this woman in that home,\nin that refugee home, found it in her heart to say, \u201cWell, the war is over, let\u2019s have in the\nafternoon, something special. Let\u2019s have some coffee and cake outdoors on the\nverandah.\u201d And so we did, and picture was taken and everybody looks glum. That was\nthe hooray, hooray, you know. So, I think maybe you would want to speak to Max.",
        "Q: I would like to speak to Max.",
        "Q: But, recent years has been easier?\nHL: Recent years have been good, yes.",
        "Q: Well, thank you so much --\nHL: Eventually.",
        "Q: For talking, 1t was wonderful.\nHL: Eventually I did go to work, but I cannot [indecipherable] that officially.",
        "Q: Shall I turn this off?\nHL: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: -- tape three, and the beginning of the interview with Max Leibmann. And the\ninterviewers name is Joe Richmond. So let\u2019s start just -- let\u2019s review your childhood that\n-- talking about your brothers and sisters, their names and ages.\nML: I -- no, I don\u2019t have brothers and sisters, I was an only child. Was born in\nMannheim, Germany. I had a perfectly normal, middle class childhood and I started\nschool in -- after [indecipherable] 1928. I switched schools in 1932, meaning that in\nGermany you normally completed either f-four years of public school and then went into\nhigh school, or if you did not qualify for high school, you continued for four more years\nof public school, then became an apprentice and went to school twice a week in the\nafternoon. So I switched schools. After four years I went into the -- a high school called\nGrayagunasium, which meant that in the first year we had Latin, and Latin continued of\ncourse, throughout school. In the third year we added French. So we had Latin and\nFrench and in the fourth year we had Latin, French and English. The difference between\nmy high school and a gimnasium was, that in the gimnasium, you would learn Latin first,\nthen they would add Greek and as a third language I think they added French. But the\nGreek was meant particularly for students who would become either lawyers or doctors.",
        "Q: In your -- in your upbringing, though, you -- was it a religious household, was it --\nML: No. We were not -- we were not religious. I mean, we knew we were Jewish. My\nfather was very active in the Jewish community, in fact he was an elected official to the --\nlet us call it lower house. And he was requested, I think in 1935 or 1936 to join the",
        "Q: [inaudible] And how old were you when -- when you were deported?",
        "Q: What can you tell me about that?\nML: Slow. Let\u2019s step back first.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.\nML: Let\u2019s go back to Kristallnacht first. We had moved, in order to preserve money,\nbecause no inco -- there was no more income, we had given up our own apartment and\nmoved in-into the apartment with my grandmother. My grandmother happened to have\nbeen a French citizen. And the house my grandmother owned had a ba -- a loft 1n the\nback, where there was a Jewish firm which sold electrical fixtures. On Krist -- on -- on --\nnot on Kristallnacht -- during the day when they started smashing everywhere, they also\ncame into my grandmother\u2019s house and went into the back in the loft and had a field day\nwith smashing all these electrical fixtures which were stored [indecipherable] hanging,\netcetera, but my mother had enough presence of mind to call the French consulate.\nBecause, after all, this was a Fr -- a French possession, this was not German property.\nAnd the consulate called the police and within 10 or 15 minutes after these hoodlums had\nentered th-the loft, there was a uniformed brown shirt, who pulled everybody out and\nstood guard the whole day so that nothing would -- would happen to my grandmother\u2019s\napartment, because after all, she was a foreign citizen. That\u2019s -- our apartment was -- was\nwhole, was never smashed. When the war broke out, of course, with mobilization, we\nalso had to report to the military, but we are immediately discharged as not fit for service\nas being Jews. Mustered out. And the next thing we knew 1s I was drafted for the first",
        "Q: You can speak up.\nHL: Oh. I can?",
        "Q: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: So you knew that you were being deported the next day?\nML: I knew, but I were -- we weren\u2019t -- I --",
        "Q: Did you know anything else? Did you know where you were going to go, how\n[indecipherable |\nML: No, all -- all we knew is that we would be sent away to France. That\u2019s all we knew.\nNow, the Gestapo, or rather the SS, left the trains at the so-called demarcation line. The\ndemarcation line was that part of France which was occupied and th -- and the -- the other\npart was unoccupied. The -- the -- the Germans left, the train went on to Lyon and I\nhappened to have been in the first train which went to France. There were seven trains all\ntogether, I was the first train -- in the first train with my mother. And it so happened that\nin my car was a former German officer of World War One and somehow or other he\ncaught the attention of the SS and they came to him and said, \u201cYou are the transport\nchief.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask for it, he didn\u2019t want it, but you are the transport chief. So when the\n-- when we arrived in Lyon and the French gendarmerie, the French police wanted to",
        "Q: Were you able to maintain contact with your mother at that point?\nML: Yes, we were able to con -- to maintain contact -- con -- contact with our relatives.\nThere was a system where the so-called block administration was issued little tickets -- I\ndon\u2019t remember how many -- which permitted you to go to visit, maybe one hour every\nso many days. I don\u2019t recall the details. I was somewhat more fortunate because I had\noffice skills, so I very soon made my way into they office and I worked in the office. So I\nhad privileges. I could go more often to my mother and then eventually we were also",
        "Q: T-T-Tell me how you met your wife.\nML: My wife was a runner in the block.\nHL: [inaudible] message.\nML: A messenger where my mother worked in the office. She was the principle -- my\nmother was the principle clerk in -- in the block where she was located and my wife\nserved as a messenger. There was mail to be distributed, there was mail to be picked up,\nso the youngsters, you know, th -- see u-us youngsters adapted much better to these\nbrutal conditions than the -- the -- the -- the grown-ups. And you have to visualize that\nthe so-called streets within the blocks were earth, and when it rained hard -- and it rained\nhard there very often in this region, it was tho -- for -- about 25 miles or 20 miles north of\nthe Spanish border. Sees -- the ground turned to mud. Now you have to realize, I had\nriding boots and with my riding boots when it rained, I would sink in almost up to the top\nof the riding boots, into this mud, which meant that we had at least one or two deaths of\npe -- old people who had to go to the latrines at night, fell and couldn\u2019t get out -- and\ncouldn\u2019t get up. Was one -- I think it was one woman. The food we got was between four\nand 600 calories a day. Not only was it very limited, but it was also established later that",
        "Q: You both talked a little bit about how it was [indecipherable] a self government --\ngovernment system --\nML: Well, each block --",
        "Q: H-How did that work, yeah.\nML: -- each block had a so-called blo-block aldist, a vice block aldist and an office. You\nknow, in -- in every 0 -- camp, you have to keep track of numbers, you have to keep --\nfor food rations, you have to do your own cooking in so-called field kitchens, whatever\nwe got. We got -- we got -- the bread was assigned so we had to count. There were\nconstant reports to be made, that\u2019s why there was an office.\nHL: Excuse me. I mentioned before there were constant statistics to be made. You have\nto report the people who die, right?\nML: And we soon had deaths, because the old people died like flies.\nHL: Just a moment. I brought you here what I usually take to --",
        "Q: You\u2019re still remembering good details.\nML: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me how you -- how it came about that you left the camp.\nML: Well, let\u2019s finish with the camp first.",
        "Q: Okay.\nML: Eventually, and I\u2019m sorry to say this, it became evident to the French su-supervisors\nthat the so-called two block aldist of our camp were more corrupt than other block aldist.\nAnd so one day they decided to dissolve our block, to stage an example for the others.\nAnd while this was going on, one day, shortly before the exodus started, where people\nwere distributed to the other blocks. And actually, they probably did this also because\nthey had moved a certain amount of people, transferred a certain amount of people to\nother camps. So one day, the supervisor of our block stood in front of me and said, \u201cI\nwant you to do something for me. I want you to do the inventory of what you are giving\nback to us.\u201d You know, blankets, etcetera, kitchen stuff. So I did this. Was be a lot of",

        "Q: This is tape three, side B, continuing the interview with Max Leibmann.\nML: Yeah, the -- the -- this facility was run by a French chemist and two rabbis who had\nmanaged to get from the -- the camp where I was in Gurs, to this farm. And unfortunately\nfor me, it was an orthodox -- it was run along very Orthodox lines. The chemist, a -- a\nFrederick Hammer -- or Hamel was Orthodox, as were the rabbis. So I was in this farm",
        "Q: Because you were not --\nML: Because we were not religious. And so the young fellow was much yo -- was a few\nyears younger than | and I -- I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m going to join Hanne or to try to find\nHanne,\u201d and so the next morning we set out and went up to Le Chambon. We arrived at -\n- Hanne had told me how to get there, so that was not a problem. And the problem was",
        "Q: Before you go onto that, at this time, y -- did you know -- first of all, did you know\nwhere Hanne was?\nML: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: And did you have any sense of how often these raids would come [indecipherable]\nML: No, we didn\u2019t know anything. Nobody knew. Hanne was somewhere else.",
        "Q: You -- you had to stay hidden the whole time?\nML: I was hidden two or three weeks. And -- but they took me back. The first thing they\ndid is they photographed me. They explained to me, \u201cWe will get you false papers now\nand then we will help you to escape to Switzerland.\u201d And I think there were four of us\nwho went to -- who were helped escape to Switzerland, I think we were the first group,\nbecause we went by railroad from Le Chambon to a village in the French Alps. I believe\nit was a Sta -- I don\u2019t remember the station where we went to, but I believe it was the\nstation one station before Seshaway, which to this day is a major vacation point in -- in\nthe French Alps. And there there was a 10 year old who picked us up. He knew we were\ncoming apparently, his father sent him. He took us to the house of his father, where we\nstayed overnight and we met there also a young, French pastor who would go with us\npart of the way the next day, because he was supposed to learn how to get people across",
        "Q: You were traveling by yourself at this point, or still with [indecipherable]\nML: No, I was -- had -- this -- with this other fellow. And so he cautioned us, \u201cDon\u2019t go\ninto an express train, because the express trains are being patrolled by a military police.\u201d\nSo we took a local train, it wasn\u2019t that far, into Lausanne and in Lausanne I went -- after\nsome moments of hesitation, I didn\u2019t know where to go, I said to myself, \u201cYou are a Jew,\ngo to the Jewish congregation.\u201d There I went to a telephone, looked up the address of the\nJewish congregation of Lausanne, which was -- which happened to be within half a block\nof the railroad station. And then we went there and when we explained to them that we --\nwe are refugees, just came into Switzerland, they told us, \u201cLook, welcome to\nSwitzerland. We have to turn you over to the military, but we can promise you that you\nwill not be returned anywhere.\u201d We didn\u2019t tell them that we were already once returned.\nAnd this is how I got first into Switzerland. So, they picked the -- somebody came with a\ncar, I think and picked us up and took us to one barrack in the park in -- in -- in a suburb\nof Lausanne, where we spent the night. We were interrogated there. And fortunately the\ninterrogator was a Swiss -- a Swiss speaking fren -- a French speaking Swiss -- Switzer --\nSwiss military who did not understand German, so I translated for the other guy, who\ndidn\u2019t speak French -- for my companion. And I translated the way I wanted to translate,\nnot what he necessarily had said. And from there we were taken to a so-called quarantine",
        "Q: Okay, when you say quarantine, do you -- were these -- were these like DP camps,\nwere they interment camps? Were they --\nML: No, no. That was -- everything in quarantine was military control. We were guarded\nby military personnel and this is the first -- where we first -- and everything in Mouton\nwhere I was and then in Appensel, this was military control. Everything was military. Btu\nthe military -- that was now German Swiss, not French Swiss any more, they took us out\nevery day on a walk. With the gun -- bayonet on the gun, you know. And we started an\nargument with the company commander or the platoon commander -- we explained to\nhim there is absolutely no reason to guard us with guns, because where does he think we\ncan go? Does he think we are escaping Germany or escaping elsewhere? We cannot go\nanywhere. So w-we eventually prevailed and this -- the Swiss soldiers walked with us,",
        "Q: Now at that point, did you entertain thoughts about not reporting to the -- to the labor\ncamp? Did you have any sense of what the labor camp would be like?",
        "Q: So the way you describe it, that there were no guards --\nML: No.",
        "Q: You were getting paid, although a small amount --\nML: Yeah.",
        "Q: How was it different from maybe just having had a job? I mean why -- what -- what --\nML: Well --",
        "Q: What made it feel like a labor camp?\nML: Number one, in the labor camp you did physical work, or if you were in these\nrefugee homes, the homes had to be maintained. So I happened to be in the office, but the\nother people -- there were people that were working the kitchens, there were people who\nhad to clean the house.",
        "Q: Were they -- were there bad conditions?\nML: No, there were no bad conditions. Number one, in all of these facilities, every six\nweeks, we were entitled to a pass. We would get a free railroad ticket anywhere you\nwanted to go, if you had some money to go, but the railroad ticket was free. You had\nyour pocket money. The food was not luxurious and not -- not gourmet food, but it was\ntotally adequate. I mean you weren\u2019t hungry. Not withstanding what many people claim,",
        "Q: Who was in the facilities? Who were -- who were in the [indecipherable] was it mostly\nJews, was it many refugees --\nML: Th-Th-There were mostly Jews, but we were in some facilities later on, after I was\nmarried, where we had Gentile political refugees. For instance, in the labor camp, we had\na German doctor who was a political refugee. And in fact, I got sick. I had hepatitis and\nthis man absolutely did not want me to go in the hospital because he didn\u2019t trust the\nSwiss, that they would feed me properly, because I had to be on a diet. In those days, you\nknow, I could -- no -- ee -- I didn\u2019t get any meat. I was permitted bread, I was permitted a\njam, I was permitted some cheese and liquids. And he didn\u2019t trust them to give me what I\nshould have gotten because of rationing. So, in the camp, it doesn\u2019t matter if one person\ngets more from one thing and less from something else, so he kept me for two or three\nweeks in the sick bay, until was able -- until I was recovering and could back -- go back\nto work.

And while I was in Geneva, one day, I was contacted by\na -- a Mr. Bauer. He would like to meet with Hanne and me -- we were not married yet,\nbut Hanne happened to be in Geneva already and I was in Geneva, so he invited us one\nafternoon for a cup of tea. And that was very in -- a very interesting conversation. The --\nI di -- wasn\u2019t quite sure if the man was a left wing Socialist, or if he was really a\nCommunist.

We got married at the same time in Geneva and\nthen Hanne joined me in -- in camp. I got permission to -- she got permission to come\nwith me into camp, for which we had to pay, by the way.

Just tell me briefly who was in your family, your --\nHanne Leibmann: In my family at what time? At what point of time?",

        "Q: As far as you want to go back.\nHL: Well, I was born in 1924 and you have that on some of the tapes already. And at the\ntime I was born, I obviously had a mother. I had a father, I had a brother three and a half\nyears older. However, my father died in 1925, about three months after I was born, so I\ngrew up in a one parent household, okay? My fath -- my mother maintained my father\u2019s\nbusiness, which was a photo studio, okay. At the time my father passed away, we still\nhad an art gallery as well, which my mother gave up around 1926, because she could not\nmaintain a business and an art gallery and two children and everything else. Besides, at\nthat point in Germany, after the inflation, the art business was not the hottest item\nanyway. So I grew up like any other child, okay. My mother had several sisters. She had\nthree that lived in the city where I was born. She had a -- equally a brother who lived in",
        "Q: Did you mention your brothers and sisters?\nHL: My brother -- I had only one brother, three and a half years older, as I said and well,\nwe grew up like all children do, I suppose. I remember the rise of Hitler, I remember the\nstreet fights in the 20\u2019s. Our place was next to a left wing newspaper and there were a lot\nof street fights and shootings and flag burnings. And these are some of my earliest\nchildhood memories. Included in that is the people who came begging for food to our\napartment door. Carts going through the street, horse drawn carts going through the\nstreet, collecting clothes for the poor. It was a very, very bad time in Germany. Hitler\ncame to power, I remember April one 1s the boycott. I remember that very well. Went to\nschool, public school. There was some harassment, obviously there was harassment of a -\n- of us kids in the street. I did not have Gentile girlfriends, probably, after 1935, because\nit became too dangerous for them, as well as for us. And my mother had Gentile friends t-\nto the very end. Til the day we were deported, we had Gentile friends who came to our\nhouse at night, in the dark, when it was, you know, what do you call it? Brown out here?\nBlack-out? Black-out, really. And school, of course, for us Jewish kids, we had to leave\npublic school in 1936 and go to an all Jewish school.

And we knew, because the morning of the deportation, my mother\nsent me to a Mrs. Fite, okay? These were very decent people. And my mother was\nfriendly with them to the very last. And she told me to bring them certain items from our\nhousehold which they very much liked. It was Bohemian glass, it was very -- a crystal, it\nwas very beautiful stuff. And she said, \u201cGo over there, bring it to them and come right\nback.\u201d And so I did and when I came to Mrs. Fite, she told me, \u201cMy husband said you\nwill be going to the south of France.\u201d But of course we didn\u2019t know, what does it mean\nthe south of France? Where were we going to be, right? And I came home and told my\nmother and she said, \u201cYou crazy.\u201d Okay\u201d? Because she fully expect to be -- expected to be\ntaken to a concentration camp in Germany or even to Poland, because we knew already\nfrom the people who had been deported from Stettin, that they were taken to Lublin. So\nour expectations were not the south of France and my mother said, \u201cYou\u2019re\n[indecipherable].

And indeed, we were taken to France. And on the train we were\nallowed to take with us 100 marks. Our money was changed into French francs. We got\n2000 French francs for the 100 marks, which was a pittance. So the trip took three days",

We had flaps that could be opened, but\nyou had to prop them up. Now if you opened the window -- so-called window, right, it\nwould rain in. You closed it, you were without air and light.

        "Q: Pll stop the tape for a -- we\u2019re back. So yeah, just the -- the daily life and the\nconditions [indecipherable] talking about.",
        "Q: So -- so, did you --\nHL: I don\u2019t think there are many camps or you have ever heard that people would --\nsometimes it was a struggle to get people to really pay up, you know, their -- whatever\npercentages it was, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: So it was sort -- it was a self government, essentially.\nHL: It was -- a c-certain amount of it was self-government, definitely. Each block -- now\nthe camp had -- was divided by one main road on each side of the main road, where",
        "Q: And you said -- you said, \u201cWe instituted this system.\u201d\nHL: We instituted that system.",
        "Q: Again that was -- that was a system that -- that you had [indecipherable]\nHL: Yeah, but this -- this system had to be approved by the administration. On holidays,\nwhen there was a holiday, you could -- could get out of your block and circulate and",
        "Q: So you describe an admin-administration that was fairly hands off, that just\nHL: It was not entirely hands off. When it came to cultural things they -- they were all\nwith it, because that\u2019s the way the French are, right? There was no problem. You have to\nask my husband, because he worked more in the office than I did. I worked in the office\nin our block. But he was -- in his block he also worked in the office, he was more\ninvolved than I was. My job was more of giving out the mail, running, you know, giving\nout the mail that came. Run the errands, do some statistical work, things like that, you\nknow. Anyway, life in camp was very, very hard. I would not say it was life like you hear\nabout from Auschwitz or any of the other camps. No, that 1t wasn\u2019t. It was tough,\nnevertheless. Once you are a prisoner, you\u2019re a prisoner. So we didn\u2019t have to stand in\nformation, okay? This did not exist. We were counted, however, in the morning. There\nwas a woman who came through the barracks every morning to count us. God forbid if\nshe overlooked a small child, because we had some small children with us and you know\nhow it is, children go always under the blanket, right and she didn\u2019t see them. She was\nmiscount and then she was -- she was just horrible, you know. Screaming, stamping her\nfeet and -- I mean it was just terrible. Totally unnecessary. There were some escapes.\nSome were on -- people were unfortunately caught and brought back. Others made it, that\ndepended on if you had contacts outside, if you spoke the language, if you had money,\nyou knew where you were going. Most of us -- only some young people tried from our",
        "Q: Did you live with your mother at that time and other relatives [indecipherable]\nHL: In -- in Gurs?",
        "Q: In Gurs.\nHL: Yes, with my mother and my three aunts. The first few months I think we were in\nthe same barracks and then my mother and I were shifted over to another barracks, but\nwe were just a couple of -- what, maybe 50 meters, you know, something like that. So\nthat was not a problem.",
        "Q: And communication an-and information?\nHL: Between us? Between the people in each block? Constant communication. What did\npeople have to do other than talk? I mean, let\u2019s face it. My cousin was in the same block,\nmy -- that was the daughter of my mother\u2019s brother. Her mother was in the same block.\nCousins of my mother were in the same block, right? As long as they were female. The\nmales were all in separate blocks. So there was constant communication between us and\nthe other people. Also many times fights. Bread -- distributing the bread. Cutting it into\nportions, because you got the whole loaf, usually was the flashpoint for a fight. Some",
        "Q: Okay, this is side B of tape one, interview with Hanne Leibmann. Okay, you were\nsaying about the social service agencies?\nHL: Do you know my name is misspelled?",
        "Q: Oh, it\u2019s misspelled?\nHL: It\u2019s L-1-e.",
        "Q: Yeah. We\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll fix that on here. It\u2019s spelled about three different ways on these\nforms so, we\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s the right one.\nHL: Possibly with a P too. The social service agencies were very helpful to us. And\nindeed one day a social worker came to my mother and asked me whether she would let\nme go out of the camp to a village called Le Chambon. And by now you must have heard\nabout Le Chambon. There was a concerted effort to get the children and young people\nout of the camp and they started with the younger ones first, because they were in greater\ndanger. Danger of malnutrition, danger of -- you know, I mean the whole thing. So this y\n-- young lady from the OC came around and asked whether she would let me go to that",
        "Q: How long had you been in the camp at that point?\nHL: At the point I left -- well, we got to the -- we were arrested on the 22nd of October\nand arrived in Gurs on the 25th, 1940. I left the camp on the seventh of September, 1941.\nSo, 11 months, little more than -- whatever. More or less. We were four boys and three\ngirls to leave and we came to Le Chambon and that was the most marvelous experience\nanyone could have had, ever. I don\u2019t know if you have seen the documentary, \u201cWeapons\nof the Spirit\u2019? Well, you have to see it to understand what I\u2019m talking about. We were\nplaced in a home that was run by the Swiss Red Cross, children\u2019s division. We were quite\nwell taken care of, under the circumstances. France was very hungry, they had very little\nto eat and even so, we were in the country surrounded by farmers, these farmers were\nvery poor. We had enough to eat, with the exception of one or two of the boys who were\ngrowing like weed and you know how teenagers can eat, like non-stop, 24 hours.\nHowever, we were free. We were in wonderful surroundings, people who appreciated us.\nIt was a flip-flop from Germany. It was a total flip-flop from Germany. After having been\npersecuted, discriminated against, segregated out of society, right? We now where the\npeople -- that we are wanted, right? And no difference was made between the French and",
        "Q: And before you went, how many Jews do you think --\nHL: Live in Chambon today?",
        "Q: No. Were there at that ttme? How many were being hidden?\nHL: The official number is 5000 people. Among the 5000 were Christian people who\nwere persecuted, okay, for one reason or another. Being that they were German Gentiles\nwho had fled into France because of political reasons. People who had become Protestant\nbut were of Jewish background, they had become or were baptized at birth -- we had a\nfriend like that. She was in Le Chambon and she was in a Protestant home. We had all\nsorts of people. The number of 5000 is the accepted number today by the papers, the false\npapers that were issued in the village and the surrounding area. People came, stayed, got\ntheir papers, went on. Because once they had the false identification papers, especially\nwith the French Jews, could maneuver, okay? So, if you figure 5000 people, or\napproximately 5000, to a popu -- equal population of about 5000, this is a tremendous",
        "Q: Before we talk about --\nHL: Yeah.",
        "Q: Your -- your -- about going to Switzerland, tell me h-how you met your husband. You\nmet in -- in the camp.\nHL: We met in the camp, yes.",
        "Q: How did that happen? What hap -- do you --",
        "Q: How did you maintain a courtship, though, in that situation like that, in the camp?\nHL: How -- courtship. I don\u2019t even think it was a courtship. It was a friendship, really.\nYou know young people are sort of drawn together -- yes I fell in love with him, of\ncourse I did. I would be foolish to say not, that I didn\u2019t, right? But it was a totally\nplatonic thing. There was very little privacy, right? Most of the time people saw us with\nhis mother. Some even thought we were brother and sister. You know, I mean it -- s-\nsome others, maybe they found some privacy or were looking for it. We weren\u2019t. And --\nyou know, I speak -- I speak in schools and colleges to the students about this time. And I\nmention my boyfriend became my husband. And not too long ago, in one class at\nQueensboro Community College, one girl in the question and answer session said, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know how you could look for a man under these circumstances.\u201d I corrected her\nthat I was not looking for a man, that 1s was totally platonic, which she couldn\u2019t\nunderstand, right? It was almost funny, you know. So -- we kept a cor -- kept up a\ncorrespondence after I left. It\u2019s as simple as that. I always knew where he was, when he",
        "Q: I guess the wi -- 1n a situation like that, you think that there are both advantages and\ndisadvantages to -- to having a new relationship, whether it\u2019s a friendship or a boyfriend -\n- to [indecipherable |\nHL: Or a girlfriend, or whatever.",
        "Q: Or a girlfriend, you know, to hav -- that there -- you know, there are certain\nadvantages in having a close companion and certain fears.\nHL: There is an advantage to having someone, yes, especially if you\u2019re in the same\nsituation, because you\u2019re each other\u2019s support. The same as when you\u2019re a group of\npeople. Like we were seven young people, right? We were each other\u2019s support. There is\nno doubt about it. And it made things easier for us, right -- than being alone. If you\u2019re\ntotally alone, without having this support, right -- it is much more difficult. One of my\nfriends, who came from the camp with me, eventually, after I had left, split from the\ngroup. I\u2019m not quite sure why she split. We assume she had a boyfriend somewheres.\nAnd she split from the group. And I think she -- in that time that she had left the group,\nuntil the end of the war, she suffered more psychological damages than any of us did.",
        "Q: Did you maintain, or do you still maintain contact with other people in this group?\nHL: All of them. All -- all but -- well, one lives in Brazil, I don\u2019t actually have contact\nwith him, but with his twin brother in Paris. One -- we know he came here to this country\nand we have lost track of him. And all the others, yes, of course. Absolutely.",
        "Q: Can you say -- can you say some of their names, just [indecipherable]\nHL: Well, there is Elizabeth Koenig, nee Kauffman, she was with us. She did not come\nfrom Gurs, but she came to us in Le Chambon. She was, by the way, the chief librarian of\nthe Holocaust Museum, til she became too ill and had to retire. There is Wiltrud Lavell,\nnee Eanee. She lives partly here in the States and partly in Spain. There 1s Jack Lewin,\nwho lives right here, out in Long Island. There is Rudy Appel, who was not originally\nfrom Gurs, but came from Rivesaltes. The Atlas boys. Yeah, we all have contact with one\nanother, absolutely. And we wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. It took us a long time to even\nget together, because somewheres along the line we lost each other, because everybody --\nyou know, after they emigrated here, we didn\u2019t all come at the same time. Jack Lewin,",
        "Q: Let\u2019s come back to that a little bit later. L-Let\u2019s keep going on talking about y-you\nmade -- how you made it into Switzerland.\nHL: How I made it into Switzerland? I went on my own.",
        "Q: And -- and -- and -- and why? You -- you -- you [indecipherable |\nHL: I just felt -- well, there were two reasons. First of all, Max had gone there, he was\nthere already. I had made up my mind after I saw my mother being deported that I was\nnot going to stay in France, no matter how safe in Chambon. I just felt -- and I had family\nin -- in -- in Switzerland. So my -- I was focused on Switzerland. One of my friends who\nlives out in Palo Alto, who came with Max from the Jewish boyscout farm outside of\nLyon, we had arguments. He said, \u201cYou go to Switzerland, you go in a mousetrap.\nSomething happens, you are lost there. Come with me, we go to Spain.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m not\ngoing to Spain, I go to Switzerland.\u201d So we had arguments back and forth. He went\nexactly to Spain, with the help of the French underground, Madame Philip. His way was\nSpain, North Africa, England, joined the French army in England and came marching\nback into France. He then lived again for sometime in France and then came here to the\nUnited States. So, yes we did have arguments whether we do go to Spain. And from there\non, or to Switzerland. So I chose Switzerland. And my trip to Switzerland, well, I went",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape two, side A, interview with Hanne Leibmann, once again. So we\u2019re\ntalking about your escape into Switzerland.\nHL: My escape into Switzerland -- as I walked along the road, I saw this custom\u2019s office,\nas I mentioned before and I walked past and the officer called me back and asked for my\npapers, which I gave him. And he looked at them and then out of the blue came, \u201cAre\nyou Jewish?\u201d Question I was not prepared for at all. And just as quickly, I answered, in\ngood Nazi propaganda -- and don\u2019t ask me where it came from, I simply said, \u201cI have\nnothing to do with this dirty race.\u201d And he sort of had a ha-half smile on his face and\nsaid, \u201cOkay, you can go.\u201d Whether he believed me or not, I don\u2019t know, but he let me go.\nAnd I walked on and made my way to the priest of the village, the Catholic priests, which\nwas one of my contact points. And he told me to what house I had to go to meet the man\nwho would help me cross the border. This man was hired by my relatives in Switzerland\nto cross me over. He was paid for the job. There were a family there with two boys and\nlater on a single young man whom they had found in the church [indecipherable] the\nstory was and he wanted to cross over into Switzerland. So this night he crossed over six\npeople. He took us -- actually, he was very close to the border. What he did was carry\nacross -- carry us across the water. There was a little stream. He carried us across so we\nwouldn\u2019t get wet. Told us exactly what direction to walk -- now please, this isn\u2019t --\nduring the night, in the dark. In what direction to walk to get the street car that would",
        "Q: Do you remember his name?\nHL: No, not at all. If I ever really knew it. Or if I knew a name, it might not have been his\nreal name, I mean you had to have lots of safeguards. In Anisee when I got off the train, I\nhad to show my papers, right? And police looked at it and said, \u201cGo on.\u201d You know,\nthere was no problem. There were a lot of people and [indecipherable] you know. We\nreached a street car -- we had a few Swiss coins, which the man had given us -- the\npasseur had given us and he told us where to get off, and there would be a person\nstanding there waiting for us, taking us to a little hotel for the night. And that\u2019s what\nhappened. We got off at that point. I don\u2019t remember what the station was from the\nstreetcar. There was a young lady standing there and she took us to this hotel, which\ndidn\u2019t ask for any registration or anything. They must have been, obviously, paid off.\nAnd in the morning she came and picked us up, took us to her house -- to her apartment,\ngave us a breakfast. And I had asked her, as soon as I got off the streetcar, I said, \u201cPlease\ncall my family immediately.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s 11:30 at night.\u201d I said, \u201cPlease, call immediately.\u201d",
        "Q: Let me just go back a little bit.\nHL: Yeah.",
        "Q: You said that you had found out that your -- your mother had died. When did you find\nout and how did you find out after [indecipherable]\nHL: Look, when my mother was deported and we had this hour or so together, she -- my\nmother was a realist. She told me she would never come back, that this was the last trip,\nthat they were certainly going to be taken east and somehow people had a sense for what\nwas going to happen to them. And so, you know, news filtered into Switzerland in \u201843,\nslowly and surely and there was no doubt in my mind that this is what happened. Besides,\nmy mother had diabetes and I never even thought she would make it as far as -- as\nAuschwitz, which she did, unfortunately. In this case, unfortunately [indecipherable]. So,\nto me it was a sure thing.",
        "Q: Were you ever able to find a [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you felt that whole time that --\nHL: That my mother was lost, absolutely.",
        "Q: Were you able later on to find out any information about what happened?\nHL: She was indeed -- she made it as far as Aus-Auschwitz and she was killed in\nAuschwitz. Because I looked into the Gedenk book, you know what that is? That\u2019s a\nmemorial book that the German government publishes with all the names of German\nJews that were killed. There\u2019s some mistakes in the book, however, essentially, you can\nfind what you need to find. You can -- the museum has the book. You ask for it up in the\nlibrary, they have it. So, to me, that -- there was -- we knew. There was no doubt in our\nmind, especially people of a certain age. When I saw my mother last, she had already lost\nso much weight. I\u2019d never seen my mother that skinny in her whole life. So how much\nresistance was there left? So living with my relatives was not a good experience, not at\nall. I left them on December 24th and I mention that date because my uncle was\nProtestant, my aunt always remained Jewish and was a member of the Jewish\ncommunity, but he was Protestant, and so Christmas, of course was celebrated because\ntheir sons were raised as Protestants. And my cousin, her middle son, threatened her that\nunless I was out of the house, he would not come for Christmas. And I had already been\nin negotiations with Geneva, where Max was taking a social service course -- to get a job\nthere and the only job I could get was as a maid. And Mademoiselle DeMomela was the",
        "Q: When -- when and why did you decide to -- to leave Switzerland and come to the\nUnited States?\nHL: Switzerland made it very clear to you that you better go on. My husband had a\ncousin in Switzerland, had a clothing factory for men -- men\u2019s clothing. And he could\nhave used him very much, to help him in the factory, in the office and so on and so forth.\nAnd so he asked for permission for us to stay, for him to work. And so the little village\nsaid, oh well, if the contone, which is like the state, right? We\u2019ll go along with that, this is\nfine. Then the contone said well, if the federal government will permit it. And the federal\ngovernment turned around and said, when the -- if the contone will permit it. And wa --\nyou know what it became? A catch 22. And I said, \u201cForget it, we go to America.\u201d I had\nfamily here, right? Max had family in Israel, however this was not an option for us. And s",
        "Q: Why not?\nHL: We just felt we didn\u2019t want to go to Israel. We just felt that was not the place we\nwould want to be. And --",
        "Q: W-W-Why?\nHL: I don\u2019t know whether it actually had to do something with his aunt -- it prob -- aunt\nand uncle, really, because they were not willing to -- to do anything for him, even before\nwe were deported. You have to ask him exactly what went on. And they were not",
        "Q: And what happened when you first arrived?",
        "Q: Wh-What was his job?",
        "Q: This is tape two, side B, interview with Hanne Leibmann. And you were just talking\nabout -- h-how long were you sick for, actually, with TB?",
        "Q: How old was your daughter when you -- when she [indecipherable]\nHL: Came back? Almost seven.",
        "Q: So that must have been very hard.\nHL: It was very hard. You have to find your way back. It\u2019s really -- you know, a\nrelationship has been -- not totally cut of course, but still -- we could see her -- after the\nfirst year we could see her every three months, I think. But a couple of hours is not much,\nright? We would call her every Sunday, 12 o\u2019clock sharp. She knew 12 o\u2019clock on",
        "Q: How did -- how did your experiences during the war affect the way that you sort of\nsaw yourself as -- as a mother or an -- an -- you know, here in the United States, how did\n-- how did that -- you know, color the way that you --\nHL: You mean, did our daughter know what happened to us, did we tell her what\nhappened to us? We didn\u2019t. Well, she asked me one day, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I have\ngrandparents?\u201d And she must have been about 10, something like that. And that was an\nunexpected question really, because I\u2019d never thought of it. And I told her, \u201cYour\ngrandparents were killed in a concentration camp.\u201d Now that was a little much for a\nchild, I know that now. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time. And then she didn\u2019t say anything\nany more. And my two aunts were sort of stand in grandmothers, right? She heard us talk\nabout Gurs, definitely. She heard me talk to my aunts when we were talking about things\nin the past. So she always knew this, but we didn\u2019t push it. We did not say to her, like I\nknow from other mothers, \u201cYou have to be very good, because of what happened to us.\u201d\nMm-mm. We did not say, \u201cYou cannot go here or there,\u201d right? \u201cYou cannot have this or\nthat, because we didn\u2019t have that you can be without.\u201d You know. She wanted to go out\nas a teenager or when she went to college, she went to Adelphi. And she wanted to go at\nnight to the city, on Saturday night like all young people. We never said, \u201cYou cannot do\nthat.\u201d I know parents who would not let their children do that. Simply because they felt,\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have it. We had to do without that.\u201d They had no understanding for a normal\nlife of a teenager, right? And they wouldn\u2019t let their children have it. And they really -- a",
        "Q: And why do you think they have these problems?\nHL: Because of the parents, really because the parents were overprotective. I have friends\nwho outright say, \u201cYes, we were overprotective of our children. We wouldn\u2019t let them do\nthis and that and the other thing and we always worried where they were and what they\ndid.\u201d And we just didn\u2019t do that. Or if we worried, we didn\u2019t tell her, and let her -- you\nknow. One night my husband and I had a terrific fight. Why? Because Evelyn decided,\nwith her girlfriend, to go to the city to a hangout. And this hangout was perfectly fine,\nthere was nothing wrong, but it was snowing. It was snowing very heavily. And he -- she\nwanted to go with the car, obviously, from Jackson Heights. I said, \u201cGo take the car. Go.\u201d\nAnd he was upset that in the snow I let her drive and go to city. \u201cThis 1s too dangerous,\u201d\nthis is this, this is that. I said, \u201cYou know what? She wants to do it. If she gets stuck, she\nhas to find a way to come home.\u201d She did. I didn\u2019t say you can\u2019t go, it\u2019s too dangerous,\nor this or that or the next thing. We let -- I let her go, he was -- he was upset about it. But\nI felt that, she\u2019s a young person, she has to find out what she can do, what she can not do.\nAnd we never stopped her from whatever she wanted to do because maybe we\u2019re too\nafraid of it.",
        "Q: When she got older, did you talk to her more and more about your experiences?\nHL: Well, she always knew some of them and eventually -- when we gave the interview\nto the museum, | think it was, she listened to the tape. I said, \u201cWell?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, I",
        "Q: Do you think that you felt differently or taught her differently about things like\nreligion or being Jewish, based on your experiences?\nHL: She had -- she went to Sunday school for a year or two. We are not a religious home,\nright? We are more cultural Jews than religious Jews. Yes, we do observe the holidays,\nright? We will have Passover and we will have people here for Passover or -- for\nPassover or for Rosh Hashanah or whatever, right? Yes, we had Hanukah but we are not,\nas such, religious people. She knows very well where she belongs, okay\u2019? There\u2019s no\nquestion about that. But to me, you know, it is by far more important that someone 1s a\ngood human being, over being very religious and maybe not such a good person. One\ndoesn\u2019t exclude the other, but you know, to me it\u2019s more important.",
        "Q: What -- what do you think may have -- what do you think\u2019s been changed by your\nexperiences during the war in terms of that -- in terms of the way you see religion or\nbeing Jewish? I mean, is th -- are there things that you can --\nHL: I have never been ashamed of being Jewish, I was always so proud of being Jewish. I\nwould never have entertained the thought of conversion of any kind. And by the way, in\nLe Chambon, there was never an attempt by anyone to convert us, right? That was an\nabsolute taboo. Would have been very easy for these people to persuade us, right?",
        "Q: Have you gone back there at all?\nHL: To where?",
        "Q: To either France or Switzerland?\nHL: Oh, to the village? To Le Chambon? Many times. And I must tell you that when I go\nthere, I feel very much at home. I know few people, right, as such. The people that I sort\nof knew have all passed on. But there\u2019s just something about the place that -- well, I feel\nvery much at home. We have not gone back to Gurs, no. By the way, there is nothing\nstanding of the camp, there is only the cemetery, which has been totally redone, partly or\nentirely with money from Germany. And moneys that were raised otherwise, I suppose,\nbut it\u2019s totally redone, it doesn\u2019t look anything like what it originally was. It\u2019s like -- now\nlike a nice military cemetery. So --",

        "Q: -- over the years. When you first came to the United States, was that important, to find\npeople who had been through the war and had similar experiences? Or has it been more\nimportant [indecipherable]\nHL: Well, we found many of our friends here, again, friends from before this total\nexperience, you know, having be deported, Gurs and so on. Most of them, my husband\u2019s,\nsome mine. Yeah, it was important to find our friends again. That was definitely\nimportant to us. Many had other experiences. I have friends who went into England with\nthe kinder transport and I found them here again. Others came directly from Germany to\nhere. Others had been in Switzerland. Yeah, it\u2019s important to have your friends and\nfriends with whom you share a past. There is sort of an unspoken, you know, connection.\nYou know, you don\u2019t have to explain to this person how you feel about a certain thing or\na situation or in -- what it was in the past. You don\u2019t have to do that, they know. The ones\nwho don\u2019t know, are the ones who don\u2019t even want to know. Or didn\u2019t want to know\nwhen we first came. When we first came, we were with one of my husband\u2019s friends and\nthey said something and Max says, \u201cWell, I had to go across the Alps -- not the Alps, but\nthrough the mountains.\u201d And the way we came here and so on and [indecipherable] so he\nsort of made a funny joke about a very sad situation and they really didn\u2019t want to know.\nAnd this is the complaint of all survivors, that the people really didn\u2019t want to know. And\nthen I come across American Jewish people, \u201cOh, we didn\u2019t know what went on.\u201d \u201cYou\ndidn\u2019t know what went on, when it was daily in the newspapers? Didn\u2019t you read them?\u201d\nI mean there -- we have volumes of paper clippings from the New York Times, over here",
        "Q: That one of the reasons that --\nHL: The survivors did not talk for so long. They couldn\u2019t and they knew that other\npeople had no -- no understanding, didn\u2019t really want to know. I spoke in a school in\nStaten Island several weeks ago. Jewish school. Not a yeshiva, but a Jewish school. On\nthe line of maybe Hamas. You know Hamas school? They are a wonderful school, Jewish\nschool in the middle of the city, have highly intelligent children there and a wonderful\nstaff of teachers. And this 1s run -- there are boys and girls, so it\u2019s not, you know. But we\nwear long skirts and long sleeves and -- religious. I was over there and I spoke to about\n100 children. And then I asked, \u201cHow many of you have grandparents that are\nsurvivors?\u201d And I would say 70 percent of the kids there had grandparents that were\nsurvivors. And I asked them, \u201cWhat did your grandparents tell you?\u201d Nothing. Nothing.\n\u201cMy grandparents don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d I said, \u201cGo back to your grandparents, make them\ntalk to you and tell you.\u201d I said, \u201cIf you are supposed to remember the Shoah,",
        "Q: Why do you think the grandparents aren\u2019t -- aren\u2019t telling their story?\nHL: I don\u2019t know. They should tell their grandchildren. You have this opposite, the ones\nwho don\u2019t talk and the others who pile it on. Literally. And put a great burden on these\nchildren. It is almost a burden the way they do it. So you have these two opposites.",
        "Q: Do you feel like your experience has been different as a survivor, having been married\nto another survivor?\nHL: You will find most survivors being married to other survivors.",
        "Q: But in your case, you actually had such similar experiences all the way through --\nthrough the war.\nHL: Yeah, and many people met in the DP camps in Germany or even knew each other at\none point or another in the ghettos. Many of them got married in the ghetto, were lucky\nto survive.",
        "Q: Can you explain in your experience why that -- why that\u2019s been so --\nHL: I think again because people were comfortable with each other, not necessarily\nbecause they were terribly in love, but because they wanted someone, right? Someone\nwith the similar experience who understands what this was all about, right? And because\nthey wanted a family. And I don\u2019t think there were many divorces among these survivor\nmarriages. Many of the people already had lost a family. Had lost a wife or a husband",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you want to [indecipherable]\nHL: No, not really.",
        "Q: Post war experiences?\nHL: No.",
        "Q: No?\nHL: Not really. At war\u2019s end -- when the war was over. The day it was announced on the\nradio and I listened to the speech of King George and I just understood enough English to\nunderstand what he was saying. We were in a refugee home in Shesare, where we had\nthis horrible woman in charge of the home. I must tell you, I felt totally drained. It was a\nbeautiful, sunny day. And here were the Alps in full sunshine and I felt totally drained. It\nwas not hooray the war was over. We had lost everyone and everything. The last one to\ndie was my brother in 1945 in the Battle of the Bulge. So we felt drained. There was no\njubilation. Not a -- for any of us. You would think people would have been totally happy\nand s -- no. Mm-mm. In fact, we have a picture somewheres -- this woman in that home,\nin that refugee home, found it in her heart to say, \u201cWell, the war is over, let\u2019s have in the\nafternoon, something special. Let\u2019s have some coffee and cake outdoors on the\nverandah.\u201d And so we did, and picture was taken and everybody looks glum. That was\nthe hooray, hooray, you know. So, I think maybe you would want to speak to Max.",
        "Q: I would like to speak to Max.",
        "Q: But, recent years has been easier?\nHL: Recent years have been good, yes.",
        "Q: Well, thank you so much --\nHL: Eventually.",
        "Q: For talking, 1t was wonderful.\nHL: Eventually I did go to work, but I cannot [indecipherable] that officially.",
        "Q: Shall I turn this off?\nHL: Yeah.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: -- tape three, and the beginning of the interview with Max Leibmann. And the\ninterviewers name is Joe Richmond. So let\u2019s start just -- let\u2019s review your childhood that\n-- talking about your brothers and sisters, their names and ages.\nML: I -- no, I don\u2019t have brothers and sisters, I was an only child. Was born in\nMannheim, Germany. I had a perfectly normal, middle class childhood and I started\nschool in -- after [indecipherable] 1928. I switched schools in 1932, meaning that in\nGermany you normally completed either f-four years of public school and then went into\nhigh school, or if you did not qualify for high school, you continued for four more years\nof public school, then became an apprentice and went to school twice a week in the\nafternoon. So I switched schools. After four years I went into the -- a high school called\nGrayagunasium, which meant that in the first year we had Latin, and Latin continued of\ncourse, throughout school. In the third year we added French. So we had Latin and\nFrench and in the fourth year we had Latin, French and English. The difference between\nmy high school and a gimnasium was, that in the gimnasium, you would learn Latin first,\nthen they would add Greek and as a third language I think they added French. But the\nGreek was meant particularly for students who would become either lawyers or doctors.",
        "Q: In your -- in your upbringing, though, you -- was it a religious household, was it --\nML: No. We were not -- we were not religious. I mean, we knew we were Jewish. My\nfather was very active in the Jewish community, in fact he was an elected official to the --\nlet us call it lower house. And he was requested, I think in 1935 or 1936 to join the",
        "Q: [inaudible] And how old were you when -- when you were deported?",
        "Q: What can you tell me about that?\nML: Slow. Let\u2019s step back first.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.\nML: Let\u2019s go back to Kristallnacht first. We had moved, in order to preserve money,\nbecause no inco -- there was no more income, we had given up our own apartment and\nmoved in-into the apartment with my grandmother. My grandmother happened to have\nbeen a French citizen. And the house my grandmother owned had a ba -- a loft 1n the\nback, where there was a Jewish firm which sold electrical fixtures. On Krist -- on -- on --\nnot on Kristallnacht -- during the day when they started smashing everywhere, they also\ncame into my grandmother\u2019s house and went into the back in the loft and had a field day\nwith smashing all these electrical fixtures which were stored [indecipherable] hanging,\netcetera, but my mother had enough presence of mind to call the French consulate.\nBecause, after all, this was a Fr -- a French possession, this was not German property.\nAnd the consulate called the police and within 10 or 15 minutes after these hoodlums had\nentered th-the loft, there was a uniformed brown shirt, who pulled everybody out and\nstood guard the whole day so that nothing would -- would happen to my grandmother\u2019s\napartment, because after all, she was a foreign citizen. That\u2019s -- our apartment was -- was\nwhole, was never smashed. When the war broke out, of course, with mobilization, we\nalso had to report to the military, but we are immediately discharged as not fit for service\nas being Jews. Mustered out. And the next thing we knew 1s I was drafted for the first",
        "Q: You can speak up.\nHL: Oh. I can?",
        "Q: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: So you knew that you were being deported the next day?\nML: I knew, but I were -- we weren\u2019t -- I --",
        "Q: Did you know anything else? Did you know where you were going to go, how\n[indecipherable |\nML: No, all -- all we knew is that we would be sent away to France. That\u2019s all we knew.\nNow, the Gestapo, or rather the SS, left the trains at the so-called demarcation line. The\ndemarcation line was that part of France which was occupied and th -- and the -- the other\npart was unoccupied. The -- the -- the Germans left, the train went on to Lyon and I\nhappened to have been in the first train which went to France. There were seven trains all\ntogether, I was the first train -- in the first train with my mother. And it so happened that\nin my car was a former German officer of World War One and somehow or other he\ncaught the attention of the SS and they came to him and said, \u201cYou are the transport\nchief.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask for it, he didn\u2019t want it, but you are the transport chief. So when the\n-- when we arrived in Lyon and the French gendarmerie, the French police wanted to",
        "Q: Were you able to maintain contact with your mother at that point?\nML: Yes, we were able to con -- to maintain contact -- con -- contact with our relatives.\nThere was a system where the so-called block administration was issued little tickets -- I\ndon\u2019t remember how many -- which permitted you to go to visit, maybe one hour every\nso many days. I don\u2019t recall the details. I was somewhat more fortunate because I had\noffice skills, so I very soon made my way into they office and I worked in the office. So I\nhad privileges. I could go more often to my mother and then eventually we were also",
        "Q: T-T-Tell me how you met your wife.\nML: My wife was a runner in the block.\nHL: [inaudible] message.\nML: A messenger where my mother worked in the office. She was the principle -- my\nmother was the principle clerk in -- in the block where she was located and my wife\nserved as a messenger. There was mail to be distributed, there was mail to be picked up,\nso the youngsters, you know, th -- see u-us youngsters adapted much better to these\nbrutal conditions than the -- the -- the -- the grown-ups. And you have to visualize that\nthe so-called streets within the blocks were earth, and when it rained hard -- and it rained\nhard there very often in this region, it was tho -- for -- about 25 miles or 20 miles north of\nthe Spanish border. Sees -- the ground turned to mud. Now you have to realize, I had\nriding boots and with my riding boots when it rained, I would sink in almost up to the top\nof the riding boots, into this mud, which meant that we had at least one or two deaths of\npe -- old people who had to go to the latrines at night, fell and couldn\u2019t get out -- and\ncouldn\u2019t get up. Was one -- I think it was one woman. The food we got was between four\nand 600 calories a day. Not only was it very limited, but it was also established later that",
        "Q: You both talked a little bit about how it was [indecipherable] a self government --\ngovernment system --\nML: Well, each block --",
        "Q: H-How did that work, yeah.\nML: -- each block had a so-called blo-block aldist, a vice block aldist and an office. You\nknow, in -- in every 0 -- camp, you have to keep track of numbers, you have to keep --\nfor food rations, you have to do your own cooking in so-called field kitchens, whatever\nwe got. We got -- we got -- the bread was assigned so we had to count. There were\nconstant reports to be made, that\u2019s why there was an office.\nHL: Excuse me. I mentioned before there were constant statistics to be made. You have\nto report the people who die, right?\nML: And we soon had deaths, because the old people died like flies.\nHL: Just a moment. I brought you here what I usually take to --",
        "Q: You\u2019re still remembering good details.\nML: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me how you -- how it came about that you left the camp.\nML: Well, let\u2019s finish with the camp first.",
        "Q: Okay.\nML: Eventually, and I\u2019m sorry to say this, it became evident to the French su-supervisors\nthat the so-called two block aldist of our camp were more corrupt than other block aldist.\nAnd so one day they decided to dissolve our block, to stage an example for the others.\nAnd while this was going on, one day, shortly before the exodus started, where people\nwere distributed to the other blocks. And actually, they probably did this also because\nthey had moved a certain amount of people, transferred a certain amount of people to\nother camps. So one day, the supervisor of our block stood in front of me and said, \u201cI\nwant you to do something for me. I want you to do the inventory of what you are giving\nback to us.\u201d You know, blankets, etcetera, kitchen stuff. So I did this. Was be a lot of",
        "Q: Wh-What happened one week later?",
        "Q: This is tape three, side B, continuing the interview with Max Leibmann.\nML: Yeah, the -- the -- this facility was run by a French chemist and two rabbis who had\nmanaged to get from the -- the camp where I was in Gurs, to this farm. And unfortunately\nfor me, it was an orthodox -- it was run along very Orthodox lines. The chemist, a -- a\nFrederick Hammer -- or Hamel was Orthodox, as were the rabbis. So I was in this farm",
        "Q: Because you were not --\nML: Because we were not religious. And so the young fellow was much yo -- was a few\nyears younger than | and I -- I said to him, \u201cI\u2019m going to join Hanne or to try to find\nHanne,\u201d and so the next morning we set out and went up to Le Chambon. We arrived at -\n- Hanne had told me how to get there, so that was not a problem. And the problem was",
        "Q: Before you go onto that, at this time, y -- did you know -- first of all, did you know\nwhere Hanne was?\nML: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: And did you have any sense of how often these raids would come [indecipherable]\nML: No, we didn\u2019t know anything. Nobody knew. Hanne was somewhere else.",
        "Q: You -- you had to stay hidden the whole time?\nML: I was hidden two or three weeks. And -- but they took me back. The first thing they\ndid is they photographed me. They explained to me, \u201cWe will get you false papers now\nand then we will help you to escape to Switzerland.\u201d And I think there were four of us\nwho went to -- who were helped escape to Switzerland, I think we were the first group,\nbecause we went by railroad from Le Chambon to a village in the French Alps. I believe\nit was a Sta -- I don\u2019t remember the station where we went to, but I believe it was the\nstation one station before Seshaway, which to this day is a major vacation point in -- in\nthe French Alps. And there there was a 10 year old who picked us up. He knew we were\ncoming apparently, his father sent him. He took us to the house of his father, where we\nstayed overnight and we met there also a young, French pastor who would go with us\npart of the way the next day, because he was supposed to learn how to get people across",
        "Q: You were traveling by yourself at this point, or still with [indecipherable]\nML: No, I was -- had -- this -- with this other fellow. And so he cautioned us, \u201cDon\u2019t go\ninto an express train, because the express trains are being patrolled by a military police.\u201d\nSo we took a local train, it wasn\u2019t that far, into Lausanne and in Lausanne I went -- after\nsome moments of hesitation, I didn\u2019t know where to go, I said to myself, \u201cYou are a Jew,\ngo to the Jewish congregation.\u201d There I went to a telephone, looked up the address of the\nJewish congregation of Lausanne, which was -- which happened to be within half a block\nof the railroad station. And then we went there and when we explained to them that we --\nwe are refugees, just came into Switzerland, they told us, \u201cLook, welcome to\nSwitzerland. We have to turn you over to the military, but we can promise you that you\nwill not be returned anywhere.\u201d We didn\u2019t tell them that we were already once returned.\nAnd this is how I got first into Switzerland. So, they picked the -- somebody came with a\ncar, I think and picked us up and took us to one barrack in the park in -- in -- in a suburb\nof Lausanne, where we spent the night. We were interrogated there. And fortunately the\ninterrogator was a Swiss -- a Swiss speaking fren -- a French speaking Swiss -- Switzer --\nSwiss military who did not understand German, so I translated for the other guy, who\ndidn\u2019t speak French -- for my companion. And I translated the way I wanted to translate,\nnot what he necessarily had said. And from there we were taken to a so-called quarantine",
        "Q: Okay, when you say quarantine, do you -- were these -- were these like DP camps,\nwere they interment camps? Were they --\nML: No, no. That was -- everything in quarantine was military control. We were guarded\nby military personnel and this is the first -- where we first -- and everything in Mouton\nwhere I was and then in Appensel, this was military control. Everything was military. Btu\nthe military -- that was now German Swiss, not French Swiss any more, they took us out\nevery day on a walk. With the gun -- bayonet on the gun, you know. And we started an\nargument with the company commander or the platoon commander -- we explained to\nhim there is absolutely no reason to guard us with guns, because where does he think we\ncan go? Does he think we are escaping Germany or escaping elsewhere? We cannot go\nanywhere. So w-we eventually prevailed and this -- the Swiss soldiers walked with us,",
        "Q: Now at that point, did you entertain thoughts about not reporting to the -- to the labor\ncamp? Did you have any sense of what the labor camp would be like?",
        "Q: So the way you describe it, that there were no guards --\nML: No.",
        "Q: You were getting paid, although a small amount --\nML: Yeah.",
        "Q: How was it different from maybe just having had a job? I mean why -- what -- what --\nML: Well --",
        "Q: What made it feel like a labor camp?\nML: Number one, in the labor camp you did physical work, or if you were in these\nrefugee homes, the homes had to be maintained. So I happened to be in the office, but the\nother people -- there were people that were working the kitchens, there were people who\nhad to clean the house.",
        "Q: Were they -- were there bad conditions?\nML: No, there were no bad conditions. Number one, in all of these facilities, every six\nweeks, we were entitled to a pass. We would get a free railroad ticket anywhere you\nwanted to go, if you had some money to go, but the railroad ticket was free. You had\nyour pocket money. The food was not luxurious and not -- not gourmet food, but it was\ntotally adequate. I mean you weren\u2019t hungry. Not withstanding what many people claim,",
        "Q: Who was in the facilities? Who were -- who were in the [indecipherable] was it mostly\nJews, was it many refugees --\nML: Th-Th-There were mostly Jews, but we were in some facilities later on, after I was\nmarried, where we had Gentile political refugees. For instance, in the labor camp, we had\na German doctor who was a political refugee. And in fact, I got sick. I had hepatitis and\nthis man absolutely did not want me to go in the hospital because he didn\u2019t trust the\nSwiss, that they would feed me properly, because I had to be on a diet. In those days, you\nknow, I could -- no -- ee -- I didn\u2019t get any meat. I was permitted bread, I was permitted a\njam, I was permitted some cheese and liquids. And he didn\u2019t trust them to give me what I\nshould have gotten because of rationing. So, in the camp, it doesn\u2019t matter if one person\ngets more from one thing and less from something else, so he kept me for two or three\nweeks in the sick bay, until was able -- until I was recovering and could back -- go back\nto work. So --",
        "Q: Tell me how -- how you got back in touch with Hanne and how [indecipherable]",
        "Q: It -- it seems like 1t would have been difficult just to -- for her letters to find you and --\nand [indecipherable]\nML: No, she knew where I was. I wrote her immediately when I got to --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, this is tape four, side A, we\u2019re continuing the interview with Max Leibmann.\nYou -- we were just talking about getting back in touch with Hanne once you were in\nSwitzerland in the labor camps.\nML: That was not a problem, because we corresponded already when I was in the camp\nand she was still in France. And the mail worked miraculously, quite well. And once she\nwas in -- in -- in Switzerland, I saw her every six weeks. And now, you want me to go\nthrough this again, with -- with a -- all of it, because this 1s all on the [indecipherable]\ntape.",
        "Q: Yeah, well maybe -- let\u2019s move ahead to what happened when -- when the war was\nover.\nML: When the war was over, that was very simple. We had nowhere to go. We di -- we\nknew we didn\u2019t want to go back to Germany, even though, I don\u2019t know if Hanne\nmentioned that in her tape, I was released from the facility I was in, to participate in the\nsocial service course in Geneva. And while I was in Geneva, one day, I was contacted by\na -- a Mr. Bauer. He would like to meet with Hanne and me -- we were not married yet,\nbut Hanne happened to be in Geneva already and I was in Geneva, so he invited us one\nafternoon for a cup of tea. And that was very in -- a very interesting conversation. The --\nI di -- wasn\u2019t quite sure if the man was a left wing Socialist, or if he was really a\nCommunist. But the purpose of the conversation was to try to entice us to go back to\nGermany when the war was over, because it would people -- it wou -- they would need",
        "Q: Wh-What was his name? Do you remember?\nML: Bauer. I don\u2019t know his first name. So that was -- and after I finished his soci --\nservice calls, I went back to internment. We got married at the same time in Geneva and\nthen Hanne joined me in -- in camp. I got permission to -- she got permission to come\nwith me into camp, for which we had to pay, by the way. They charged me the same\namount of what the Swiss personnel had to pay. And so we were in -- in Switzerland until\nwe were able to obtain an -- an affidavit to come to the United States.",
        "Q: What were the interment camps like at that point, after the war?\nML: They had not changed. That was -- we were -- I was not in a camp, I was in a home\nfor families. And these homes had not sh -- that were -- has not -- they did not change",
        "Q: Were there other place you considered going?\nML: No, we had nowhere to go.\nHL: Well, excuse me, we were talking about Israel [indecipherable]\nML: We were talking about Israel, but this was another sore point. My parents -- I had an\n-- an uncle and an aunt who went in 1934 already, to what was then Palestine, with\nmoney. They left Germany at the time because they -- their money basically was in",
        "Q: Do you remember when you first got here, what -- what you -- what you felt?\nML: Well, it was, you know, we had to -- it was a strange country. And we came with at\n-- a two year old child, our daughter. And --\nHL: What did we feel when we came here?\nML: Bewildered.\nHL: Bewildered.",

        "Q: So, we\u2019ve talked -- Hanne and I have talked a little bit about just how your\nexperiences during the war have sort of affected maybe the -- the -- the type of parents\nyou\u2019ve been and the type of people you\u2019ve been in terms of --\nML: Well, look, we\u2019ve --",
        "Q: -- and the kind of choices you\u2019ve made.",
        "Q: Is there any reason why, before 1983 or before this -- this time period, that -- that you\nweren\u2019t involved or maybe weren\u2019t -- I mean, did you talk about it amongst -- amongst\nyourselves?\nHL: Ourselves to get involved, well our f -- as I mentioned, our first involvement came\nthrough the book.\nML: Yeah, we looked -- we were, to start out with, busy making a living. My wife\nworked, I worked. Our daughter was growing up. She eventually, in 1967 graduated --\nno, in 1963 graduated high school and went to college. So we were busy making a living.",
        "Q: Y-Your friend now and then, as well?\nHL: Yeah.\nML: Yeah. The -- look -- bo -- some -- one of my friends I went to school with, started in\nsecond grade. We are still friends. Our wives got along when we came here, so we, you\nknow, just continued. There are people like this on -- on my wife\u2019s side. So, there was --\nwe have a -- a Gentile friend who once said to us, \u201cYou are an incestuous society.\u201d We\nmostly get together with -- with our friends from Germany and since I am working at the\nAmerican gathering, of course, we have other -- we made other friends, which are all\nsurvivors. And what was interesting 1s, I found when we talked for the first time to",
        "Q: When -- when --\nHL: But we are friends just the same with all of them.\nML: Yeah, in fact --\nHL: We have a vast circle of friends.",
        "Q: And how many of these people who -- who aren\u2019t your survivor friends, how many of\nthem know that you are a survivor [indecipherable]\nML: Oh, I made no -- I made no --\nHL: All of them.\nML: All of them.\nHL: All of them.\nML: I make no bones about it. I don\u2019t hide.",
        "Q: And how -- how many of them are curious and ask you stories and --\nML: Well, if you --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] converse with them about it.\nHL: Very few.\nML: Very few. Look, our -- those of -- of our friends who came here in the 30\u2019s really\ndidn\u2019t want to know about our experiences either, when we came. That was a taboo\nsubject. They didn\u2019t want to know, they didn\u2019t want to face it. They were lucky, they\ncame here in time. And some of them to this day really haven\u2019t ask us much about our\nexperiences during this period.",
        "Q: How does that make you feel?",
        "Q: This is tape four, side B and we\u2019re continuing the interview with Max and Hanne\nLeibmann. We were just talking about the people who came before the war, how did they\n-- how they can\u2019t comprehend these -- the -- the experiences of a survivor.\nML: Look, basically those who came before the war, moved to America. They didn\u2019t\nhave the experiences we had. Most of them came even before Crystal Night and those",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you this. You said that -- that no one who didn\u2019t go through those\nexperiences can comprehend. So, what do you then do? Do you try to tell your story and\nmake them comprehend --\nML: No --",
        "Q: -- or do you just --\nML: We have never -- we have never --\nHL: Well, I --",
        "Q: Or -- or -- or, a-as it seems that you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve preferred to --\nto socialize with people who have those sort of experiences [indecipherable |\nML: No, we\u2019ve socialized with our --\nHL: [indecipherable] socialize --\nM: -- fr -- w-we socialized with both groups, but with our friends, we never imposed the -\n- or forced them to listen to our story. They didn\u2019t want to -- didn\u2019t want to listen, fine.\nHL: In the beginning, they didn\u2019t want to listen. They know now, some of the -- some of\nit. It is really never a topic of conversation as such. We might speak of the Holocaust in\ngeneral, right? But the personal thing never really becomes a topic of conversation, or\nvery little. The people who came here were Max\u2019s, well they just moved here, yell -- yes,\nthey moved here. They had their own problems when they came here in the 30\u2019s. There",
        "Q: Has that been a part of your marriage, that sort of [indecipherable]\nHL: I don\u2019t think so.\nML: No. It hasn\u2019t.\nHL: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t talk with each other about your stories?\nML: No, no.\nHL: No, because the story\u2019s --",
        "Q: They were the s -- they were the same story.",
        "Q: Well, let me ask you this. At -- at this point, you look back on that history and you\nhave a -- you have certain stories that you know and that you tell, that you tell in schools\nor -- are there still times when you remember new things that -- that all of a sudden you\u2019 ll\nremember something or that isn\u2019t part of the story that you usually tell? You want to hold\non for a second?\nML: Yeah.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]\nHL: Yes, the -- a few weeks ago -- you know, I speak in schools. And I tell them of the\nday when we were deported and what went on.\nML: And she speaks without notes.",
        "Q: It was [indecipherable]\nHL: Mm-hm. Sometimes --",
        "Q: She\u2019s [indecipherable]\nHL: You know, sometimes there are small details that you don\u2019t --\nML: You miss.\nHL: -- you miss. You miss them. Sometimes it\u2019s a manner of not having enough time to\ngo into details when I speak. Sometimes you really -- you know, like I did not tell you\nwhen you -- we were speaking here, when you interviewed me, about my grandmother on\nthe train. I mentioned that she lost her mind, that she was totally -- the kids would say she\nlost it. So this -- this Mr. Wile that you have here on your notes, well, at one point, after\nthe SS had gotten off the train in Shalons Urson, we were able to get the one doctor that",
        "Q: [indecipherable] things that you even have forgotten about for 40 years yourself and\nthen, you know, come back to you sort of later in life then as you\u2019re --\nHL: Not really.\nML: Not really.\nHL: Some people do say you have a marvelous memory, but I don't know whether it\u2019s\nsuch a good memory as having absorbed everything, you know, that went on in -- or as\nmuch as I could absorb as a child. Yeah, there are things like, I don\u2019t usually talk about\nwhen one day in a nice summer day and the doors to the balconies in our dining room\nwere wide open. And in the street, a bunch of Hitler youths were marching and they were\nsinging one of their horrible things, that when the Jewish blood jumps off the edge of the\nknife, things will be twice as good. And my father got up and went out on the balcony\nand watched them marching by. And I became totally hysterical, right? Because I thought",
        "Q: What sort of notions?\nML: Well, you know the questions -- they wanted to hear certain things and we didn\u2019t\nplay ball with this. There is always -- we had -- we had -- the only thing I can think of\nright now is -- and this has come again and again -- what -- what -- the questions was, \u201cIn\nLe Chambon, what prompted these people to help?\u201d And they thought this was -- I don\u2019t\nknow what. And we tried to explain to them that when you -- when they helped, it was a\nspontaneous and they might not have known 10 minutes ago that they would help,\nbecause th -- th -- 1t\u2019s a question didn\u2019t come up. You know, they did this for religious\nreasons, for moral reasons, but one didn\u2019t know from the other, there was no organization",
        "Q: Did you go back and visit there?\nML: Oh yeah, we were there a number of times. We even participated at their first\nsymposium -- historic-historical symposium where they were trying to put things together\nin an orderly fashion, with historians and there was a controversy which was very\ninteresting. There was a historian who researched this, a young French Ph.D., who stood\nup and said -- there were 150 people -- 150 Jewish young people who were in this\nvillage. The man was almost lynched, because what he found was, the 150 --\nHL: [inaudible] it\u2019s 50 - 50.\nML: Oh, 50 people. He found the 50 people are registered in -- in police documents who\nwere Officially registered as living in a forced residence in Le Chambon. That there was\nsomething going on. All along during the war where people came and went and were\nfitted with false papers, never entered his -- his brain. The man was almost lynched and --\nand was called a revisionist and God knows what. Because he took the number -- he",
        "Q: Did you ever think 20 years ago or however many years ago that you would be so\ninvolved with --\nML: No, no.",
        "Q: -- doing that sort of thing now?\nML: Because we are so far removed from organized religion that it never occurred it -- to\nus. And we were too busy. We never belonged -- we belonged for three or four months to\na Jewish congregation and our daughter went for a few weeks to Sunday school. Other\nthan that --\nHL: She went two -- one or two weeks.\nML: Other than that, we never belonged to an organized congregation or anything.\nHL: We are not joiners.\nML: We are not joiners, we are not religious, we don\u2019t practice. That doesn\u2019t mean we\nare not Jews. I mean, we may not be Jews in the eyes of the Orthodox, the ultra-\nOrthodox. But nobody ask us if we were religious or not religious when we were\ndeported.",
        "Q: So why then do you think you\u2019re so involved now with hearing people\u2019s stories and --\nand [indecipherable] and being part of the gathering and --\nML: That ts --\nHL: I think one has to give something back to society.\nML: To society, yeah.",
        "Q: I --\nHL: Do you speak any Yiddish?",
        "Q: Only a few words.\nHL: Oh.",
        "Q: But I wanted to show you this. It\u2019s the one -- the museum sent me this, which I\nthought was interesting, this is Netanyahu and he says, \u201cThis is the lesson of the\nHolocaust, this and only this. That the existence of the Jewish people is tied to Jewish\nsovereignty and a Jewish army that rests on the strength of Jewish faith.\u201d\nML: Yeah, but this Jewish faith, of course is somewhat neb -- in my book nebulous\nbecause the ultra-Orthodox in Israel don\u2019t serve in the army. They don\u2019t even recognize,\nper se, the state of Israel.\nHL: [indecipherable] Israel.\nML: [indecipherable] these people don\u2019t want the state.",
        "Q: But this 1s a st --\nML: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- a very specific sort of lesson of the Holocaust. I wonder, you know, if you have\nyour own sort of idea of what the lesson 1s.\nML: The lesson is remember, teach so that it will never be forgotten.\nHL: Teach tolerance. Teach understanding. This is what I ask of the children, to get to\nknow each other. To understand and respect each other. Because if that all breaks down,\nthen you get hatred. And hatred, we cannot live with that. Many times the children ask\nme, \u201cDo you hate?\u201d And I will ask them, \u201cDo you know what hate does?\u201d And they look\nat me. I said, \u201cDo you know who gets hurt first when you hate? It\u2019s you yourself, because\nyour soul dies. Before the other guy knows that you hate him, you are already destroyed.\u201d\nAnd they look at me and then they start thinking about it. So I\u2019m not only telling them\nwhat happened to me, but I\u2019m trying to tell them what they have to do and what they\nhave to learn and the consequences they have, you know, if things go wrong.\nML: And you know, one of the functions I have in the American gathering is I act,\nactually as an ombudsman on behalf of survivors, vis a vis of the claims conference.\nMany people can\u2019t get what they think they should get -- a pension, for whatever reason.\nThere are many restrictions why they cannot get it. And the personnel of the claims\nconference, 1s basically Russian. With a -- to us totally alien mentality, in Russia, I\nalways say, in Russia, y -- a social service is -- is not social service, civil servants are not\nthere for you. You are there for civil servants. And that is the attitude which you get",

        "Karlsruhe. She had a sister in Switzerland, she had a sister in Czechoslovakia. On my\nfather\u2019s side, I had an uncle who lived in Munich, who was a photographer and\nauctioneer. I -- and a brother who lived in Berlin. He was an agent for artists for movies,\nopera, concerts, that was his business.",
        "we had to start a Jewish school. I do not remember how many children we were, probably\ntwo - 300, I would say, at the beginning. And with parents emigrating, it became, of\ncourse, a smaller and smaller school. We were first located in a public school building,\nactually. We had one or two floors in that public school building. The other floors were\nfor retarded children. And eventually we had to get out of there, too and have the school\nin community -- in the community building. I remember No-November 10th very well. I\nremember the synagogue being vandalized and whatever. Actually, a friend and I went\ninto the synagogue a couple of days later to see what we could save. And since the\ncommunity building was adjacent to the synagogue, we literally watched the destruction\nof the synagogue as it was being torn down. The community sold the real estate where\nthe synagogue was standing on, because they needed that money to feed the families who\nno longer could make a living. Things became very, very tough and we had a lot of\nJewish people who no longer could afford to feed themselves, so the community had a\nsoup kitchen. And they needed this money to feed all these people and take care of\nwhatever needed to be done. 1940, I was for [inaudible] June, July -- five months in the\narea of Hannover, in the north of Germany, in a place called Arlem. It had a Jewish\nagricultural school, and -- long established school, as a matter of fact. This school did not\nonly teach agriculture, it also taught homemaking and all sorts of other things. And since\nmy mother didn\u2019t know what to do with me and I was hanging around the house, she sent\nme up there for several months. Beginning of 1939, actually, the three sisters of my\nmother moved in with us, because end of \u201838 we could not have businesses any more. We",
        "were deprived of our livelihood and in order to save funds, we all moved together. It also\nmeant that no other Jewish family could be moved in with you if you had a lot of -- if you\nhad a large apartment. They had a large apartment, we had a large apartment, so it was --\nalso my grandmoth-mother had moved in with us. She was a very elderly lady of 90,\nmaybe she was only 80 - 89 when she moved in with us, whatever. So that the household\nconsisted actually of six women. My brother left Germany in 19 -- s-summer of 1937, to\ncome here to America. He was first with a half brother of our father. That didn\u2019t work out\ntoo well, then he was down in Atlanta, at the university to study whatever. I think he\nstudied radio technology or something like that. He got a -- a scholarship. And actually,\nwhen he left in \u201837 was the last time I saw my brother. He eventually joined the\nAmerican army and was killed in the Battle of the Bulge in January of 1945. We\nourselves were deported in Oc --",
        "\u201cNo, we don\u2019t take them back,\u201d and so on and so forth, which by the way, was the\nofficial reason for the pogrom in 19 -- on November 10th. The German took this incident\nin Paris, where this young fellow, Grynszpan, murdered miss -- consular employee vom\nRath, because he was so angry that his parents had been deported out of Germany. This is\nthe official story. I know a book has been written about it. I have not read the book.\nThere might have been other reasons for the shooting, but this was the official version.\nAnd this brought about the government organized pogrom of November 10th, what you\ncall here Crystal Night, or Kristallnacht. It was a frightful time. In any case, we were\ndeported in October of 1940. We were deported to France. French did not know who we\nwere, or whatever and simply sent us in the unoccupied zone of France. Or the Germans\nactually sent us in the unoccupied zone of France. And the French sent us all the way\ndown south -- southwest, to Gurs, a camp called Gurs, it\u2019s spelled G-u-r-s. It\u2019s very close\nto the Spanish border, only about 40 kilometers to the Pyranees in the Spanish border,\nand here we were in a camp. Not a nice place to be, it was awful. The trip was awful. My\ngrandmother, at this point over 91 years old, lost her mind on the train. On this paper\nhere, you have the name of Weil? This Mr. Weil was with us in the same car when we\nwere deported. He also was a very elderly man and he as well, lost his mind, as did my\ngrandmother. Became totally confused, was totally out. Okay, so we had two in one car,\nit was -- it was a horrible situation.",
        "and then we found ourselves in Gurs. And Gurs -- I don\u2019t know, have you heard about\nGurs? Have you read about it?",
        "HL: The daily life -- daily life was very hard. The first night we got there, we were given\nsome straw and not sufficient for everybody. That for days people were really lying on\nthe wooden planks. There were no cots, there was nothing. Eventually we were given\nblankets, we were given straw, we were given those cotton -- something like a sack to put\nthe straw in, make something similar to a mattress, right? The food, like in all\nconcentration camps, was -- I guess almost everywhere the same. We got something that\nresembled coffee in the morning, half a pound of bread, it was our daily ration. We got a\nwatery soup at lunchtime with some vegetables in it. Mostly root vegetables, turnips,\ncarrots, things like that. It had also some chickpeas and occasionally a little meat. Our\nmeat ration per week was about four ounces. A good sized hamburger, okay? For the\nwhole week. Evening was the same thing. Life was very, very difficult. No one who ever\nwas in Gurs will forget the mud we had to live in. No one will forget the rats, the mice,\nthe fleas, the lice and the bedbugs. There were no beds, but we had bedbugs. And I think\nthis was the most -- the constant dampness in winter, the constant rain, the constant\ndampness. Being cold all the time, even though we had our own clothes. They did not\ntake our clothes away. We were constantly cold and damp. And heat, yeah, there was in\nevery barracks was a stove. But we very rarely had even two pieces of wood, you know,\nwhatever. We had electricity, contrary to some reports that I have read, we did have\nelectricity. We had two lightbulbs in each barracks, small ones. We did not have to work,\nwe were not forced to work. People created their own -- in that they started handicrafts. A\ncultural life was born. My husband, by the way, participated in that. Music was made.",
        "The Y provided instruments. You have to understand that in France the camps were just a\nlittle different from what you usually hear, in that social service agencies could function\nin the camp. And so we had the Young Man\u2019s Christian Association. We had the Crakas,\nwhich is an American organization. We had the Swiss Red Cross -- children\u2019s division,\nor children\u2019s aid. It was ch -- first the Children\u2019s Aid Society and then they combined it\nwith the Swiss Red Cross, because otherwise they could not have functioned. We had\nthem and we had Catholic and Protestant agencies and most of all we had the OSE, which\nis ach -- Jewish child welfare organization in France. And OSE did tremendous work.\nAbsolutely tremendous work, their social workers were far superior to anyone you can\nfind, really and truly. And more oft -- most of these social workers, if not all, were\nJewish. And so they really took a lot of chances and faced a lot of dangers helping us in\nthe camp and taking children out of the camp, to place them in their children\u2019s homes.\nBecause they had to travel, they were on the road, they had to -- you know. And even in\nunoccupied France, things became evermore difficult. So they did a tremendous job. The\nSwiss Red Cross brought in some food for the most desperate. And they would feed\nyoung people in the morning and it went in rotation and then in the afternoon, day or\nsomething, they fed adults who really had nothing at all. We could receive money in the\ncamp. We also could write letters and receive letters. So, these are things that did not\nexist in other concentration camps. It was most helpful. The money we could receive,\nwell it created a black market of phenomenal, you know, prices. This was possible\nbecause we had a lot of Spanish people with us, who came to this camp, 1939, from the",
        "Spanish Civil War. These were refugees from the Spanish Civil War. For them this was\nnot a concentration camp. For them it was a place where they could live. So-called, right?\nBut they could go in and out of the camp. They had special -- that was a completely\nseparate situation. These people brought in food, as much as they could get from the\nfarms around or wherever and then, of course sold it at tremendous prices in the camp.\nThat was their way of making a living. So the prices went up and up and up til one day\nwe ourselves decided this can not go on because not everybody can really participate in\nthis thing and a lid was put on the amount of money you could get each month. It was\nsomething we instituted ourselves, we kept an account for everyone, right? And out of\nthis account, twice a month, you got a certain amount of money, several hundred francs.\nBut that meant that you no longer could pay total fantasy prices, and it curbed this thing.\nWe also instituted -- you could say it -- almost self help, in the following way. If people\ngot money that was sent to them from wherever, they had to pay a certain percentage into\na fund. This fund was used to help the people who received nothing at all, okay?",
        "wooden -- the wooden barracks subdivided into blocks. Each block, of course surrounded\nby barbed wire and a ditch and a gate with a ga -- military guard standing there or\nwhatever. And -- and a rifle. Little did we know they didn\u2019t have ammunition. But we\ncould not circulate between the blocks. We had to invent a system by which the men and\nthe women were separated, so that was a great hardship, because husbands and wifes\ncould not talk to one another. They could not see one another. So the first thing that\nhappened is then, when people died, all right, they would go to the funerals, because we\ndid have funerals. And they would meet at the cemetery so they could talk to one another,\nright? And that was one way in the beginning. And people died very, very soon. Very\nquickly. Dysentery broke out. Meningitis had broken out. There were a number of -- you\nknow, diseases that very rapidly spread and so many -- especially the elderly, died very\nquickly. I can show you the list of the people who passed away. I have one. And\neventually we instituted a system with little tickets that were given out for an hour\u2019s visit\nor else in the men\u2019s block, so the wi-wife\u2019s could go to the husbands and then the\nhusbands would get a ticket to come another day to see the wife. But this of course also\nwent, you know, in rotation. Not everybody could go every day.",
        "there was no problem. But this was a holiday treat. But for the rest, this was instituted\nwith the approval of the French administration.",
        "group, I think . The group of German Jews that came from Barton and the Polatinate\nwere an overaged group of people. Very -- percentage-wise very few young people and\nchildren. It was mostly 50 and up. So 50 and up, people are not quite this adventurous\nany more, you know. And they were all traumatized and in shock and it took a long time\nbefore people started to function. The ones who functioned from the beginning were the\nyoung people.",
        "people were very good at it, some were not. And when the bread was cut in portions,\neverybody watched, obviously, that none should get even one millimeter more. And there\nwere Some women who were not as good at it and bingo. My mother did it, it went in\nrotation, to make it, you know, equal. My mother did it, there was never, never a\nquestion, it was very funny. Never. There were some other people doing --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "village, that there was a minister there by the name of Trocme and they wanted to take\nsome young people out of the camp. And my mother left the decision to me and I decided\nthat I wanted to go. And so after quite some time, actually, maybe six, seven weeks, we\nwere finally told we would leave. And we were seven young people -- seven teenagers all\ntogether, to leave for Le Chambon.",
        "us, right? Whether in the children\u2019s home, in the group home or anywhere. Obviously,\nwe were foreigners, obviously we did not speak French or not a good French. Obviously,\nwe were dressed differently. I mean, we were very obvious in the village, no doubt about\nit. And there was -- we were just always appreciated. People always helped us. There\ncame the moment when we had to be hidden. The farmers took us in and hid us, at their\nown risk, I mean, the risk of their own lives and the family, right? Even so, til 19 -- what\nwas it, 1942, the unoccupied zone became totally occupied, right? All of France was\noccupied. The danger of -- for the farmers to be arrested, why -- because they were\nhiding us -- had they found us, was real. And they shared their bread with us -- shared it\nwith us. They had children to feed. And yet, there never was a question. If fact, in one of\nthe farms where I was hidden -- I was hidden on two different farms, in a four week\nperiod. Both farms the police came to search. On the second farm, the police asked the\nfarmer, \u201cAre you hiding anybody? Are you hiding any Jews?\u201d And we could hear this\nupstairs in our hiding place. And the farmer was very calm, answered, \u201cNot hiding\nanybody and I don\u2019t know what Jews look like.\u201d And after a little pause, he said, \u201cWould\nyou care for a glass of red wine?\u201d Our hearts sank to our feet, believe you me, thinking\nthat this guy is now going to accept and stay, right? We have to stay in our hiding place,\nbeing scared to death, right? And then we could hear, \u201cNo thank you. I am on my way.\u201d\nBut this farmer was so calm about it, it was unbelievable. Just with a few words he\nfinished the whole thing, \u201cI\u2019m not hiding body and I don\u2019t know what Jews look like.\u201d\nWell, no Jewish person had ever lived in Le Chambon, except for a few years, a Mr. Sesh",
        "lived there maybe a few years before the war. They had never known Jewish people.\nThey knew the Jewish people only from the Bible. That was enough. They were the\nchosen people and you helped them and you took care of them. Being Huguenot, they\nknew their own history of persecution. They knew what this was all about, because, like\nthe Jews, they always talk about their history. And so there was never a question. So this\nwhole Chambon, their whole attitude, everything was the total flip from what we had\nexperienced in Germany. I was in Chambon til February of 1943. In *43 I went to\nSwitzerland.",
        "amount of -- of people saved. Or given an opportunity to survive. It\u2019s tremendous. There\nwere no 5000 people surviving in hiding in Germany, Jewish people. I think the number\nis 2000, but I\u2019m not quite sure. So think of what one village did or one village and the\nsurrounding villages, what they did in comparison to others. It is enormous. I must tell\nyou that in the summer of 1942, I went back to Gurs to see my mother, because she had\nbeen very ill. I was promised a week\u2019s stay and they would let me go. That was the\narrangement that was made for me, through the various social service agencies. And I\nwent. About a week or 10 days before I went down to Gurs, my husband -- then\nboyfriend, was able to leave the camp and he was placed on a Jewish boyscout farm\noutside of Lyon. Now in order to go from Le Chambon down to Gurs, you have to come\ndown from Chambon, go to Sentatien, go to Lyon, because that\u2019s the way the train would\ngo, and he was outside of Lyon, so I stopped there first to see him. Then I went on to\nGurs. And he told me, because he had been working for sometime 1n the so-called\nhospital in Gurs, that the ambulance comes through Orlong at such and such a time, such\nand such a -- blah blah. And when I asked, when I arrived in Orlong and asked for the\nambulance from the camp, they said ambulance had not come for several days. So this\nalready didn\u2019t sound too good. So I went by bus to the camp. And when I came to the\ncamp I could not enter, I was not allowed to enter. And then I found a room in a nearby\nvillage, in an inn, very simple inn, but it was fine. And within -- I went -- saw my mother,\nbecause she was notified that I\u2019m there. Saw my mother through many layers of barbed\nwire, great distance away and it was sort of shouted conversation like if I shout from",
        "here, across the street to the other house, okay\u2019? From the road. And they did chase me,\npolice would come and chase me, I would go back. And then, within two days, I think, I\nwas told that the first deportation trains would leave. And my mother was on the first\ntrain out. I was given permission to see my mother at the railroad station, the freight\nyards. And I believe the people were loaded on the trains during the night. And I was told\nthat I had to be there very early in the morning. So went to Orlong -- back to Orlong,\nslept in the street, between two houses. Was at one time asked for my papers, which then\nwere still my real papers, not phony papers -- by the police and after that they left me\nalone. I explained to them why I was there. And as soon as day broke, I went to the rayer\n-- rail yards -- freight yards and found my mother, with the help of a French policeman,\nactually. He was sort of keeping himself separate from the rest and he asked me why I\nwas there and I explained it to him and he found my mother for me, because I didn\u2019t\nknow in which -- which car. And so he also offered me -- five thirty in the morning, a\ndrink of alcohol from hi-hip -- his hip flask. And I said no, thank you. I wasn\u2019t used to\ndrinking at five thirty in the morning. And I spent probably an hour or an hour and a half\nwith my mother. And then, of course, the trains were closed and locked and the train\npulled out. On my way back, I went to see my boyfriend again and told him what\nhappened and at that point, when I was there, I heard the first time, round ups for the\npeople who lived free. And when I came back to Le Chambon, I told some of his friends\nwho were in a American funded student home -- and told them -- told my friends that we\nhad no longer any parents, that they were taken away. It was a horrible job. It was a",
        "horrible mission, really. The whole situation was incredible. And I told some of his\nfriends, \u201cWe have to leave. We have to ma-make our way into Switzerland.\u201d And they\nlooked at me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, then I\u2019m crazy, but that\u2019s where\nI\u2019m going to go.\u201d Guess who went first? The ones who called me crazy. They went way\nbefore I did. I only went in February of 1943. I told my husband at the time I saw him, on\nthat boyscout farm, Jewish boyscout farm, run by two rabbis incidentally, that if he felt\nhe was not safe there, to come to Le Chambon -- which he did, together with another\nyoung fellow. And I took him to Madame Philip, the wife of Andr\u00e9 Philip, who was the\nright hand man to General DeGaulle. And she asked me only one question, \u201cCan we trust\nhim?\u201d And I said, \u201cOf course you can.\u201d And by evening he had been hidden away. He\nwas hidden away for four weeks. He didn\u2019t know if anyone remembered where he was,\nhe will tell you himself. And when he came back he was given false papers and together\nwith some others and a guide, he was taken to Switzerland. So this village has done more\nin every way, than anyone else that I know, okay?",
        "HL: How did that happen? Well, his mother worked in the office in the block where we\nwere. She worked there -- everybody, you know, there was no pay involved or anything.\nBut she spoke a fluent French. And we needed people in the office who spoke French in\norder to understand the orders that came from the administration. The statistics that had\nto be done and all of that. All right, you had to have people could communicate. And I\nhappened to be helping in this office and he would come and see his mother and that\u2019s\nhow we met. Very simple. Very simple story.",
        "left the camp, where he was, that\u2019s why I could go visit him, right? Once he left\nChambon and went to Switzerland, as soon as he came into Switzerland, he let me know\nwhere he was, right? And we kept on corresponding. There was no problem\ncorresponding between France and Switzerland at the time. After all, 1t was supposed to\nbe neutral, right? We know a little differently today. Let\u2019s see, we even -- maybe we\nalways knew. There -- there was not a problem, really.",
        "Because all of a sudden she no longer had the support group -- of the group -- of the\ngroup who was in the same situation, you know. But she\u2019s -- you know, she\u2019s suffered\nreally psychological damages to this day. And she\u2019s now in her 70\u2019s. She cannot deal\nwith it. She lives in -- outside of Washington and to this day she has not gone to the\nHolocaust Museum. She cannot deal with it. Her mother was deported, her father was\ndeported. Her brother was deported, he lived in Berlin. And she just cannot. And I feel\nit\u2019s very much the time that she segregated herself from this group.",
        "yes, he was in Switzerland, he also fled into Switzerland, I had contact with him. But\nthen he came, I think before we did and somehow we didn\u2019t know where he was. So it\ntook years and years and years to find him. But eventually we fo -- he -- we found each\nother again. So we are really in constant contact, yes.",
        "on my own. I went alone from Chambon, which I left on foot to go to the next village,\nbecause I did not want anyone in the village to see me take the train. This way I just\ndisappeared. I stayed one night with the minister in Toanse, which 1s the next little town.\nAnd the -- in the morning I took the train, from there to go to Sentertien and from\nSentertien you have to change to go to Lyon. Then you go from Lyon to Anmass, Anisee,\nAnmass and Geneva. And I did all that, 1t was not easy, it was not a joy ride. I was stuck\nin Lyon at the railroad station for a long, long time because there was no train going -- to\nwait for hours. At this point, in 1943, all of France was occupied. The railroad stations\nwere full of German military. So I put myself in the waiting room, bought a magazine,\nright? Pretended to read this magazine, watched what was going on, right? Was as\ninvisible as possible. I had bought my ticket, right -- and when the time came, I just\nwalked quietly to the train -- to the pier -- to the platform. And took the train. Trains were\novercrowded at that time. Stood a long time in the -- no, what do you call it, you know\nthey have compartments in [indecipherable] and there\u2019s this -- it\u2019s like a corridor that\nruns along. I stood there for a long time and I put myself right next to a policeman. I\nfigured if I stand right next to him, he won\u2019t know that I\u2019m scared to death, right? I did\nnot start a conversation with him, he didn\u2019t talk to me. But I figured, if I stand close to\nhim, he will not think even to ask me for my papers. And that was exactly right. Took a\nlong time before I found a seat. And there were three people -- funny enough, a lot of\npeople must have gotten off. I found a seat, put myself in the corner, pretended to sleep.\nAnd these three people were talking about work in the resistance, which was a terrible",
        "mistake, because I could have been anybody who is going to denounce them. And in\nAnmass I got off and I -- no, Anisee, Anmass [indecipherable]. Got off in Anisee. Was\nsupposed to go to an orphanage, a Catholic orphanage. Who -- and the man on the train,\nwho was in this compartment said to me, \u201cDo you know where you are going?\u201d I said,\n\u201cYes, I have to go to the orphanage.\u201d \u201cDo you know the way?\u201d I said, \u201cI will find it,\nthank you.\u201d \u201cI will take you there.\u201d I said, \u201cThank you, I will find it.\u201d Well, he insisted\non taking me there. Turned out not to be too far from the railroad station. We came there,\nnobody would open the door. So he said, \u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d I said, \u201cWell,\nI guess I have to find a hotel.\u201d I had very little money. And he said, \u201cOkay, I will find\none for you.\u201d Well, what he found was a very simple place and downstairs was some sort\nof a bar type thing. And there were a lot of people in there, some of them from North\nAfrica and I had never experienced that. And I got a room and I made sure I locked that\ndoor very tightly. I gave them a totally phony address. I gave them the name as it\u2019s my --\nin -- in my identification paper and as an address, I gave an address in Lyon. Every town,\nevery city in France has a rue -- oh God, I can\u2019t think of it just now. Rue Garibaldi.\nDoesn\u2019t exist a town that doesn\u2019t have a Rue Garibaldi. Such and such a number\nGaribaldi, Lyon. They didn\u2019t look too closely, di -- neither did they care. And in the\nmorning I paid and I left and I went back to this orphanage and then I could get in. They\nsimply did not answer bells at night, for security reasons, obviously. And they gave me a\nlittle breakfast and told me how to go on. Which bus to take, where I had to walk, what I\nhad to do. And so I made my way to Anmass and from Anmass I walked to another little",
        "place and on the way was a customs office. And I figured customs office, it\u2019s war time,\nthere\u2019s no trade, what -- what customs office? And I walked by.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B",

        "take us into Geneva. Now, you know what streetcars do? They have the overhead electric\nwires and it sparks when they hit the connections. So you see this and you get confused.\nAnd we walked and came exactly back from where we had started. So then we knew a\nlittle better what we had to do, but it was a very anxious moment. This man was a\nwidower, he had six children, teenagers and up. At one point, several months later, he\ntook 40 people across the border, was caught and shot. So, it\u2019s a very sad story. That left\nall of his children without parents. Yeah, he was paid for it, but, you know, what good?",
        "And she did and my aunt came the next morning to pick me up. Around 11 o\u2019clock or so,\nshe was in Geneva to come and pick me up. Now, my entry into Switzerland was easy,\ncompared to other peoples. Also, once I was on Swiss soil, I was legal, because my\nfamily had obtained an immigration visa for me. So only my crossing was -- in a way,\nillegal, right? But once I was in Switzerland, I was a legal whatever you -- immigrant,\nokay? While all the others, like my husband, were illegal immigrants, right? They were\nrefugees -- illegal refugees. I lived with my family from March first til Decem -- 1943, til\n-- 24th of December, 1944. Much too long. My relatives did not understand what I had\nexperienced. They had no understanding -- even so, my aunt had lost her sister. She could\nnot accept that my mother w-was dead, til I flung it in her face one day. They just never\nunderstood. My uncle was a very Victorian man. Very Swiss, very Victorian. I was 18,\nhe was in his 70\u2019s, right? I mean, this alone, right? And there were a lot of frictions. A lot\nof frictions also because I felt that he was a well-to-do man and he did not do enough.\nDid not do enough for the family, to save them. Two sisters of my mother were able to\nleave Gurs to go to Cuba. My grandmother died in Gurs. My mother\u2019s oldest sister died\nin Gurs, okay? And there was my cousin, who was a young woman of 35. There was a lot\nto be done and he could have done better. And the answer I got from him one day was, \u201cI\ncannot eat my bricks.\u201d He had several houses and the answer was, \u201cI cannot eat my\nbricks.\u201d And it was just so outrageous, you know. My aunt could be speaking about her\nbrother that was lost, right, with his wife, daughter, son-in-law. And sees a stain on a\nlittle tablecloth with red wine and she became totally upset about this stain, while talking",
        "of her brother who died in Auschwitz. She didn\u2019t know about Auschwitz at the time, but\nshe knew these people were lost. So you can see that they had absolutely no\nunderstanding. And the fact that I wanted to get married, well that was altogether\noutrageous. How can you get married to someone who has nothing -- who 1s nothing?\nYou have to have at least -- all this was too much. And I must say that if I ever came\nclose to a nervous breakdown, it was in my family -- in my aunt\u2019s and uncle\u2019s house. And\none of my cousins didn\u2019t help the situation at all.",
        "HL: Also, a woman of 52 and the strain and stress and the deprivation of everything,\nright? And sick. How long can you last?",
        "one who negotiated that deal. And I got a job with a very nice Bulgarian family. He was\nsecretary at the Bulgarian consulate and resigned because of the Bulgarians being so\nGerman friendly, okay? He opposed the Germans with everything. So, I worked for them\nfor several months. They were very nice to me. I worked hard, but they were very nice to\nme, very understanding. And in the mornings he would come and tell me, \u201cI listened to\nthe radio last night.\u201d The broadcast, the clandestine broadcast from Bulgaria. \u201cThey shot\nthat friend of mine and they shot this friend of mine,\u201d and I got an up to date report every\nday of what was going on in Bulgaria. He associated with a lot of people that worked for\nvarious resistance groups all over. And they were really very nice. And I worked for them\ntil the day we got married, which was the 14th of April, 1945. And then I asked for\nvoluntary internment, so I could be with my husband. Because as an immigrant, I was to\nbe free. So I asked for internment and the Swiss government said, yes, I could do that.\nAnd so we lived in various refugee homes. Now, Max had been in a work camp at one\ntime. And we hear a lot about these things and 1s all so distorted. Some people like to say\nthey were slave labor camps. These were not slave labor camps, they were work camps.\nThey lived like all the military did, right? We got the same rations the Swiss got. We\nwere paid a small sum of money every 10 days for the work we did. We could go out.\nThere was never a fence, there was never anyone to say you cannot, you know, leave the\nhouse. Yeah, they had to do their work for certain hours and then they could do what they\nwanted. Weekends they could go in the village, go to the movies or to -- to local inn or\nwhatever they wanted to do. And every six weeks we got a pass for the railroad, to go",
        "anywhere we wanted in Switzerland, provided someone was good enough to take a\nrefugee in for a two or three day pass. So it was nothing at all like what you read today in\nthe papers. It\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s sad. I mean, the Swiss did a lot of dirty things. What went on\nduring the war, you know, it was immoral, it was terrible, but people will do things --\nterrible, immoral things, in order to stay independent. And I cannot even fault them for\nthat. Because, had they not done that, you and I wouldn\u2019t be talking to each other.\nGermany would have gone in there, right? And you and I wouldn\u2019t be talking. Had the\nGermans gone in there, those 28,000 Jews that were in Switzerland, would not be. Surely\nSwitzerland was wrong in sending back 30,000 Jews to their death. This was as immoral\nand as unnecessary as can be. There was room for these people. But the things\nSwitzerland did after the war, with the gold, and not paying out the moneys that people\nwere entitled to and denying them what was rightfully theirs, this is what I resent. We\ndidn\u2019t expect anything from the Swiss. We were glad to be there, we were glad to be safe.\nAs long as they were safe, we were safe. Yes, there was harassment, yes we were the\ndirty refugees. Yes, we were the unwanted guests, right? But we survived and the name\nof the game was survival. Harassment? We had been harassed before, right? That they are\nanti-Semitic, no doubt about it. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But the name of the game\nwas survival. I must tell you that Max and I were in three different homes. One of them,\nthe woman who ran it -- the Swiss woman who ran it was not a nice person. She was a\nsmall, petty soul, who now had power over people and she let them know it. So this was\nnot a nice place. We had mostly Dutch people in this home, who came from",
        "Theresienstadt and they were mostly elderly people, very few young people among them.\nAnd she was not nice to them. We then asked for a transfer, after the -- the Dutch went\nhome very quickly after the -- after the end of the war. Within a few weeks they went\nback to Holland. We then got a Russian group of people. These people were probably\nUkrainian, possibly slave laborers, possibly all the people who had volunteered to work\nin Germany. Okay? We never knew the full story, except that they were Russians. And\nwe -- they were a rough bunch. Most of them were pretty rough. And we asked for a\ntransfer to another home, because Max worked in the office, so he had connections. He\nasked for a transfer and we went to Cloastuss, which is a lovely place. And there the\nSwiss management was just the nicest, really the nicest people. This house -- this home\nburned down -- this home burned down after the -- we first had Polish people there,\nGentile people and then we had also again Russian people. And the Russian people, that\nwas a very dirty story, what happened to them. What happened was that Switzerland did\nnot have diplomatic relations with Russia, since 1917. Now, they were itching to re-\nestablish this after the war and what better thing to do than to sell out these Russian\npeople? And they were the only group of people who were forced out of the country. The\nRussian military came and picked them up. And you saw it, when they came. All of a\nsudden, this house was Russian property. This was the way they behaved. We had a\nhundred people in Cloastuss in this home. Four of them hid in the woods and did not go\nback. We later on found out from someone in the government in Switzerland that this\nwhole transport of Russians, was killed in Austria by the Russian military, including the",
        "infants, and we had infants. So this was a group of people sold out in order to get\ndiplomatic relations. Amoral? You better believe it.",
        "particularly helpful during the time that his mother was in Gurs. His father took an\nentirely different route. They were not willing to help him either. And so we probably felt\nwe better, you know, it was not the place we wanted to be. Later on relations straightened\nout, but it took a long, long time. In any case, our chance of coming here was probably\nalso better. And so we came here in February of 1948. No, actually beginning of March.\nThe first day in our -- in this country was our daughter\u2019s second birthday. Our\n[indecipherable] was born in Switzerland. And I tell you, we were in a refugee home in\nTaratae where the woman who was in charge was very, very nice. We had approximately\n30 infants in that house, many of them born in Switzerland. No infant, no baby could\nhave been better taken care of anywhere, than our children were. Each mother took care\nof her baby. We had a whole floor with nothing but babies, okay? A whole floor.\nSeparate kitchen. Two pediatric nurses to supervise the whole thing, okay? I mean, these\nkids were so well taken care of, it wasn\u2019t even -- and I -- I mean it was really exceptional.\nIf anyone says the kids weren\u2019t taken care of, it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not true. We had older\nchildren with us, they went to school. One of the refugees was a doctor from Yugoslavia\nwho had -- was with the Hungarian group, was in Bergen-Belsen and was brought out\nand came to Switzerland, this group of people, I don\u2019t know if you heard about them.\nAnd he was a terrific doctor and a specialist in pediatrics. So our children couldn\u2019t have\nhad it better. And she was just two years old when we came here.",
        "HL: When we first arrived, my family had arranged for us to stay at the Steven Weiss\nhome. Steve -- Rabbi Steven Weiss was running a -- a house on 70th Street, 1t was in the\n70\u2019s on the West Side. And there were a lot of refugees in this house. We had a room to\nourselves, large room for the three of us. And, it was -- we had breakfast, lunch and\ndinner. And the first week our relatives paid for us, I think it came to 30 dollars for the\nthree of us. And it was really a very good set up because I could go down in the kitchen\nand get for the baby what I needed, you know? And so on and so forth. And then we\nwanted some help from some organizations here and my uncle, who was a brother to my\nfather said, \u201cLet\u2019s go down.\u201d I think they went to the HIASs. And Max and he went and I\nstayed back with the child. And down at the organization they told him, \u201cWell yeah, but -\n- we can help you, but only if you move out of New York.\u201d And Max said, \u201cWell, where\ndo you think I should be going?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, go to Peoria, Illinois.\u201d So he asked,\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s in Peoria, Illinois for me?\u201d \u201cWell, go to the library and look it up. And the\nfirst thing you have to do is move out of the Steven Weiss home and move into the Hotel\nMarseilles on 100 Street and Broadway.\u201d And that was a terrible place. So we did and\nthen we thought about all of this and it was a ridiculous idea. I have family in New York,\nI have family upstate New York. I have family in Pennsylvania. Why should I go -- be\ngoing out to -- to Illinois? I know -- don\u2019t know anybody, right? So, about 10 days or 12\ndays after we came here, Max found a job and very soon after that we moved into a s-\nsingle room occupancy situation and chugged along as best we could. And --",
        "HL: He worked in an office for an importer - exporter. Oh, some stuff. You have to ask\nhim exactly what they were doing. Unfortunately I was sick. I spent some time in the\nhospital. My daughter went upstate to my cousin. And Max had a problem with his knee,\nhe also had to stay in bed for several weeks. And it was a very rough beginning. After all,\nthis was straightened out, we found a little place in Flushing, because we didn\u2019t want to\nbe in Manhattan with the child and also the rents were much too high, we couldn\u2019t find\nanything. If I had walked into a place with a tiger on a leash, I probably would have\nfound an apartment, but not with a child. Nobody wanted a couple with a child. And in\nFlushing we found something, 1t was very bad, but we had two rooms, a kitchenette, you\nknow and we could sort of almost afford the rent. Not really. And we lived in that house\ntil we had the house condemned, for the unsanitary conditions in the house. And then we\nfound an apartment in Astoria with a very nice landlady who wanted someone with a\nchild. And we -- that was a partly furnished apartment and it was very nice. And we just\nsort of got our feet on the ground when disaster struck. And disaster struck one night\nwhen I was coughing and first [indecipherable] really kind of funny. Then I was\ncoughing again and then, by then I knew I better get up. And I went in the bathroom and\nI coughed up blood. Now, nobody had to tell me what happened, okay? My aunts, who\nwent to Cuba from Gurs, had arrived in the States few weeks after us, so I had my two\naunts here and of course they were no help to me because one had Parkinson\u2019s, the other\none was even older, why not sick, but an aunt with Parkinson\u2019s is -- is enough --\n[indecipherable] to tell them. And went to the hospital and they diagnosed the obvious, I",
        "had TB. And that was in 1950. Now we came in \u201848, this was the fall of 1950. My uncle\nhad died, s -- maybe six weeks before that and then of course they took x-rays of my\nhusband and of the child. And Max was equally sick with TB. The only one not sick, like\na miracle, was the child. So we first had to send her up to my cousin to be taken care of,\nbecause she was not to [indecipherable] with us any more. And we then were placed in\nsanitorium, in Bedford Hills, which is Westchester County. Montefiore Hospital in the\nBronx, had a sanitorium up in Westchester County and we were placed there. We were\nthere -- Max probably 18 months and I was there 21 months. Our daughter had to come\nback from upstate New York in order to be placed 1n a foster home. I could not leave her\nwith my cousin. I cannot ask someone to take care of a child, a two year old -- a four year\nold at this point -- or four and a half, without being able to compensate them in some\nway. It is a [indecipherable] responsibility. And she came back to New York and she was\nplaced in a foster home out on the island with a very wonderful person, who had been\ntaking in foster children for many years. And there were other children in this house and\nshe was very well taken care of. I mean, very well taken care of, but still knowing that\nher parents were someplace else. And it left 1t\u2019s mark on the long run. The woman was\nvery good, she had great understanding for children. And she was away from us for --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",

So it was felt that it\u2019s\nenough if you have -- if I t-take care of the child and my husband and the household, that\nI couldn\u2019t possibly go to work. He went to school. He went for accounting. He finished a\ncourse in nine months that usually takes two years. And we actually lived on welfare. We\nhad to go on welfare, we had no choice. We got a s -- apartment eventually. When we\nfirst came out we had -- we subleased a room -- Max subleased a room in someone\u2019s\napartment. And then after we got clearance from the government -- because we were not\ncitizens, we got an apartment in Brooklyn, in the 14 section. There\u2019s a housing project,\nthe 14 houses.

But you have to find\nyour way back. We would do anything and everything to -- you know, make this again a\nfamily. And yet, after maybe two years, maybe less, she threw at me one day, \u201cYou got\nsick on purpose, both of you, so you could get rid of me.\u201d This is a child\u2019s thinking, a\nchild\u2019s imagination, a child\u2019s reasoning. A child doesn\u2019t know you don\u2019t get sick on\npurpose, right? And when I told our pediatrician, the very man who was -- who saw her\nborn, practically, in Switzerland, he then said, \u201cWell, maybe she should have some\npsychiatric care.\u201d And I figured that\u2019s going a little far, I think she will outgrow that.\nWell, she did not outgrow certain aspects. She realized, yes we didn\u2019t get sick on\npurpose, when she was older, but there were certain aspects that she did not overcome.\nAnd so she ended up with many years of psychiatric care. She\u2019s now the most level-\nheaded, wonderful human being that you -- you know, not because it\u2019s my daughter and\nI\u2019m prejudiced in favor of my daughter, but she really is, you know. And she is very\nunderstanding of other people. So it really has done what it was supposed to do. I mean\nshe had to deal with another situation several years later when I got sick again -- again\nwith TB, in 1961. So that was something that was just -- you know, a repetition, even so,\nthis time I didn\u2019t have to go to a sanitorium, I was home.

We\npr-produced concerts, we produced opera, as -- when this -- when we were excluded, we\nadded a -- an orchestra, a string orchestra And th-thus we were able to perform all kinds\nof things. I was in this orchestra by the time I was about 15 or 16. In 1935 or 1936, I\njoined the orchestra and this went on until Crystal Night. Now, it should -- I have to\nemphasize that I was permitted to stay in school and not change to a Jewish school,\nbecause my father was a front line war veteran. And the children of Jewish front war --\nwar veterans, had the privilege -- some privilege -- of -- of remaining in school til Crystal\nNight. However, I did not stay in school after December 1937. I had decided by then that\nenough is enough. I could never go to the university in Germany, so it made no sense to\nstay in s-s-school, learn Latin -- continue with Latin and I switched from a -- from the\nhigh school, to a private commercial school where I -- with an emphasis on languages,\nbut where I continued French and English studies. I also learned some steno -- German\nsteno. Why I learned this I will never know, because I knew I would never use it.

He was a representative of textile goods, to go to Greece and start -- try to\nstart selling there on their behalf and thus create a new existence which would -- should\npermit us eventually to follow him to Greece. This did not really work out. The\ncompetition became aware of his activities when he started to sell goods. And the\ncompetition managed to get him expelled in 1939. My father went to Italy. And from\nItaly, just before the outbreak of the war, illegally went to France, where he was first\narrested, put i-into jail for six weeks and then lived a precarious life until he was caught\nin 1940 in Nice -- until he was caught by accident in a raid and was deported to\nAuschwitz.

I know of other\npeople who also were from my city, who never were permitted to come back home. So\nwhen I came back home, my mother saw to it that I was able to work starting January\nfirst, 1940, in the equivalent of Hiyas in Germany, which was centrally administered by\nthe G-German Jewish administration in -- in Berlin and for the next 10 months, I served\nas a secretary in what was called in g -- what we called in Germany, histroin and we\ndevoted the ent -- our -- all -- all our efforts, his whole office was devoted to helping\npeople emigrate.

And she finally -- I finally convinced her\nthat I\u2019m not kidding, since it\u2019s not a joke, that we really would be deported. So, by the\ntime the Gestapo came the next morning to arrest us, at least we had reasonably packed\nwhat we could carry. We had wa-warm clothes in, we had the right shoes. We had the\nblanket. So when they told us this -- this you can take, we were all ready, which we\ndidn\u2019t tell them. And this was how the deportations started.

But the time we left, there were only three\nclasses, but they used the old fourth class passenger cars to load us and send us to -- to\nFrance.

These people didn\u2019t know who we\nwere. They were told there are Alsatians coming -- or Lorraines coming, who don\u2019t want\nto stay under German occupation, which was not true.

And eventually, as it became dark, we came into -- I don\u2019t\nknow if it was a village. There were some houses along the -- the -- the way where we\nwalked and I picked one because I didn\u2019t want to stay out overnight. Besides, we had no\nfood and my sugar was running out, which was what sustained me on the way up the\nmountain and down the mountain. So I knocked at the door. They took me -- they took us\nin. We explained we are refugees. They took us in, they fed us, they gave us a bed. They\ngave us breakfast the next morning and they explained to us where to go and where not to\ngo. For instance these people told -- were nice enough to tell us not to go to the next big\nvillage because it was a big military assembly point and there would be a lot of military\npolice who would stop us. So we went to the next village, all the way down into the --",

        "without any arms. On December 22nd, I was handed a ticket -- a railroad ticket to a labor\ncamp. Again it\u2019s the French part of Switzerland. All alone. And I want to emphasize this\nbecause there was -- there was all kind of ouhaha about how badly we were treated 1n --\nin Switzerland. Even the quarantine camps never had barbed wire or anything of this\nnature. Yes, in the -- in -- in the quarantine camp we were guarded by -- by Swiss troops.\nBut I was given, when I -- when I was transferred to a labor camp, I was given a ticket,\ngo there, alone. I went s-strictly on my own. There was nobody with me. I was the only\nguy who was transferred on that day. And when I arrived in the afternoon in this labor\ncamp, the director of this camp looked at me like if I\u2019m a ghost. \u201cWhat are you doing\nhere?\u201d It was the 22nd of December, the camp was closed. There was not a soul in the\ncamp besides the camp director, who had a ba -- a military barrack, which was outfitted\nas an apartment, where he lived with his wife and his daughter. Everybody else was on\nleave. So the next question was, \u201cDo you have relatives here? Can you go somewhere?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cYes, I have a cousin.\u201d So I called my cousin and he said, \u201cAll right, come on.\u201d So I\nwas handed another ticket and I was told, you be back on such and such a day, the day\nafter Christmas. And I went right back, practically the way I came from, because I was in\nAppensel, and my cousin lived in -- in s -- in a -- in a village in Saint Garron. So I spent\nChristmas 1942 with my cousin, who was married to a Gentile woman and then I started\nmy career in the Swiss labor camp.",
        "ML: I had no sense of anything and where would I go? Where should I have gone?\nSwitzerland is a small country, you can\u2019t hide. You know, I mean it would have been\nfutile. Never occurred to me, either. I mean, you know, if you were brought up in\nGermany, you thought like a German in th -- in that you follow orders. So I went back to\nthe labor camp and by the time I came back there was a few feet of snow. And the first\nthing we as -- we are supposed to do is clean the access road from the highway to the\ncamp. The camp was in Seeare and it was -- oh, maybe a mile and a half or two miles to\nthe access road, which you walked and then you walked the access road to the camp. The\ncamp was put there in order to clear land. But the first thing of course we had to do 1s\nclear the access road. And I didn\u2019t like that kind of physical work, so I made it my\nbusiness to get into the office within a week. And now, let me explain, the labor camp\nhad barracks -- had military barracks. They were no better, they were no worse, they\nwere identical military barracks which were used by the Swiss military. We had barracks\nwhich had bunk beds and we were given mattresses, I don\u2019t remember with what they\nwere filled, but we had ma-mattresses. It was a two-tiered affair, you slept either high or\nlow and there was a barrack for -- for dining. There was a latrine. There was an office\nbarrack. There was another barrack where there was a sick room -- a sick bay where the\nSwiss personnel who helped run the camp lived -- I think we had one or two people in\naddition to the camp director. But there was not a single guard. And there was, of course,\nno barbed wire anywhere. It was open. And in fact something very funny happened along\nthe way. In the morning you made a count. So one day -- I was already long in the office,",

We got a call back. \u201cHow\ncome you reported everybody is there, when we are holding a guy who belongs to you?\u201d\nWhat had happened was, that we had, apparently, a homosexual whose -- whose\ncompanion was somewhere in Zurich and he had gone to Zurich without our knowing.\nAnd the -- my -- the man who was in charge of counting missed him. He miscounted. I\nmean nothing happened, but I mean, you know, they had caught him somehow. We\nwould never have known. I was in this camp quite awhile. I don -- I don\u2019t have the exact\ndates any more, you can look them up. The museum has my so-called Swiss\nidentification book, where all the camps are listed and where -- you know, where -- it was\nended when I was issued some shoe coupons or some shoes or whatever, clothing,\nbecause all that was rationed.

And one of the cousins in Switzerland\nonce said, \u201cThey never talk about it to each other.\u201d I said, \u201cThere is no need for them to\ntalk about it. They know each other\u2019s story. They lived through it. They don\u2019t have to go\nand say what happened in this place or what happened in that pla -- they know.\u201d So we\ndon\u2019t have to talk about it.\nML: No.\nHL: We know.\nML: No. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s not necessary.",
        "HL: And all of a sudden I realized something 1s missing in my story, but what is it that is\nmissing? And then I remembered that this morning a young girl was in our house, a\nJewish girl, whose mouth was very loose. I mean, she -- she\u2019s a character. She would say\nthings that she shouldn\u2019t say, right? And the Gestapo came and arrested her in our\napartment. And we all thought, \u201cWell, one more time she talked too much in the wrong\nplace, and --\u201d you know, that some -- they arrested her, before we were arrested, we\ndidn\u2019t know yet. We just knew that that young lady, she was maybe a few months older\nthan I, was arrested. And that was the thing that had slipped my mind, totally and\ncompletely, til I realized there is something -- there is something in that story, what is 1t?\nAnd then it finally came to me -- that she had been arrested before we were taken away.",
        "was on the train. He was the last doc-doctor in the city I come from -- from Karlsruhe,\nwas a lot Jewish, was allowed to practice. By the way, he couldn\u2019t call himself a doctor\nany more, he was some sort of a healer. And was able to come to our car and he took a\nlook at my grandmother and he assessed the situation and gave me several sleeping pills\nfor her, which I managed to get into her -- not a small undertaking without any water or\nanything. And the intent really was clear, right? Unfortunately and it sounds horrible,\nunfortunately they were not enough. And so the poor woman had to suffer two and a half\nmore months, okay? This is a -- as you say, a detail -- not a small detail, but something\nthat I didn\u2019t mention when I was speaking to you.",
        "it was outrageous that he stepped out, that he shouldn\u2019t do that, right? Yeah, sometimes\nyou forget to mention these things, but they don\u2019t really slip out of your mind, you know.\nYou might temporarily when you speak not mention it, you know, because you\u2019re\ninvolved in whatever you\u2019re -- what else. But it doesn\u2019t really get lost.\nML: What -- what struck me 1s the first few times when we spoke, in that time, is we\nspoke together. With a -- our first major effort in this respect, was an invitation by\nPrinceton University. And what struck me then was, we were in an academic\nsurrounding, our audience was mostly intellectuals, lawyers and doctors. And we got\nquestions which were slanted to what they thought they would like to hear. And you\nknow, you had to knock this down. It was na -- it struck me that some people --\nAmericans, have -- had preconceived notions and it was quite difficult to answer these\nquestions 1n such a way as to make it clear to them that their notions are not right.",
        "in Chambon. You know, you do this, you do that. And the widow of the pastor who was\npass [indecipherable] always said when she spoke to people, \u201cIf it would have been\norganized, it would have failed.\u201d The left hand did literally not know what the right hand\nwas doing. There might have been people in the house next to you and the people who\nlived next to it didn\u2019t have no idea what these people were doing. And maybe tomorrow\nthey would take people and nobody else knew. One didn\u2019t talk about it. It was\nspontaneous. When the need arose. And this was something very difficult to convey to\npeople.",
        "disputed, you know, that there were 5000 people who were helped. And the 5000 number\ncame from a man who forged papers. He\u2019s a doctor today in France, but at that time he\nwas a teenager who knew how to forge papers. You know, you get all kinds of crazy\nideas. The his-historian didn\u2019t understand that if you are illegal, you cannot be counted.\nYou\u2019re not there, officially. When I was in Le Chambon, nobody knew I was there. And\nthe -- certainly not the officials or the police. I came, I was hidden, I came back, I was\nfitted with false papers and I went. And that happened before this man who -- who said\nhe made at least 5000 false paper was ever in this village. He came much later. So you\nhave all kinds of things where you have to dispute even historians. I had a -- we had a\nconfrontation at the occasion of the opening of the Research Institute in the US Holocaust\nMuseum in Washington. That was years after the museum was already open. We had the\nconfro-confrontation with a German professor who was considered the German authority\non the Holocaust. He never -- he -- he -- he stated in a speech, which he had prepared and\nwhich was slated for publication that the first deportations in Germany ha-happened in\n1941. Oh? There was -- in March of 1940, there was Stettin, who were deported into --\nsomewhere into Poland. Then there w-were we, with 6504 people who were deported to -\n- to France. And there were of course the expulsions in -- in October of \u201838 of -- of the\nPolish Jews without proper Polish passports into no man\u2019s land between Germany and --\nand Poland. Never mentioned it. And he got so upset when we confronted him and told\nhim that he\u2019s revising history. I\u2019m talking about Professor Yecky. So, you know there,\nwe are trying to keep all of this historically correct. And that is a big undertaking.",
        "HL: I think it 1s necessary that the young people know about it. That they understand\nwhat can happen when a dictatorship takes over. When I speak to the kids, I always tell\nthem that you have to do everything so democracy doesn\u2019t get lost, because choice is\nzero after that. That they have no future and no life in a dictatorship. These are really\nsome of the reasons. So they know what has happened, right? And that they can learn\nfrom the experience of others, what mankind can do.\nML: Yeah, and the motto of the -- the basic motto of the American gathering 1s thekor. In\nYiddish, gdank and in English, remember.",
        "when -- when a survivor calls the claims conference with a question. They can\u2019t get\nanswers, they get nastiness. So I am the one, they are calling us and my name by now\nseems to be known up and down the country. Call Max, Max might be able to do\nsomething for you. So I am trying to be something of an ombudsman and if I explain to\nthem -- some of them -- why they cannot get that pension which they are longing for, I do\nit in such a way as not to offend them, but when they get the answers from the claims\nconference, it is done in such a way that there 1s an absolute hatred against it.
