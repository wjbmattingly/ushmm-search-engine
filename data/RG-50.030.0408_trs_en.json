        "Question: Good morning, Ambassador Dolibois, it\u2019s a very nice to have you here in Washington.",
        "Answer: Thank you, it\u2019s a pleasure to be here.",
        "Q: Tell me, what was your full name at birth.",
        "A: Well, actually, it was Jean, J-e-a-n. Jean Ernest Dolibois, pronounced Dolibois in\nLuxembourg because it 1s a -- a French name. My father is Parisian -- Parisian ancestry, so in --\nin Europe it\u2019s Dolibois. But Dolibois like Illinois in the United States, it makes it a lot easier, so\nthat\u2019s just a -- but a -- when I became naturalized, I paid a dollar extra for the naturalization fee,\nto change the Jean, J-e-a-n, which would be pronounced Jean, to John, J-o-h-n. So at least my\nfirst name is still a -- Americanized.",
        "Q: And tell me what year you were born and where in Luxembourg you were born.",
        "A: I was born in Luxembourg City, actually a s-s -- the suburb Bonava, of Luxembourg City, on\nthe avenue -- on the Rue de Chicago, predestination apparently. And the -- I was born on\nDecember fourth, 1918. My -- was immediately after -- shortly after the signing of the armistice\nand I was born the youngest of eight children. Unfortunately my mother died 10 days later. So\nmy oldest sister Marie had to step in and -- and play the role of my mother. And she actually\nraised me. In fact, up until the day she died, I called her mom, you know, she was -- al-although\nshe was my sister.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting.",
        "A: But she actually is involved in my coming to the United States as an immigrant. I don\u2019t know\nif you want to hear that --",
        "Q: Yeah, I do, I do, yes, I kn --",
        "A: -- romantic story, because it is that. Well after World War I, we did have American\noccupation troops in Luxembourg because the United States -- the Americans had liberated\nLuxembourg from four years of occupation by the Germans. So there were American troops\nstationed in Luxembourg and some Americans were billeted in our home. And as things would\nhappen, my sister was 19 years old, fell in love with one of the Americans, and they planned to\nget married, if -- when he got out of the service. But then I was born, my mother died, and my\nsister had to take care of the rest of the family and play the role of mother. So the American\ncame back empty handed, but they corresponded with each other for 10 years. He came back in\n1929 and married her and brought her to the United States, to Akron. Meanwhile my brothers\nand si -- brothers and sisters had all grown up and married, and my father and I were all alone.\nSo my father, who had pretty good political sense, and could look across the Mosselle river and\nsee what was happening in Germany, and he didn\u2019t see much of a future for -- for me, at least, in\nLuxembourg, and he thought history could repeat itself, so he decided we ought to get out, come\nto the United States and take advantage of the land of opportunity. And so my father and I came\nto the States in 1931 --",
        "Q: Let me ask you --",
        "A: -- and joined my sister now.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. It\u2019s quite a story about your sister --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I must say, 10 years of correspondence that --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- I\u2019m sure is a rare -- rare story. I -- I -- I understand from your autobiography that your --\nyour dad and you were quite different and your interest in education did not match his interest, is\nthat true? Was that difficult?",
        "A: Yeah, my -- my father, who was a -- a very loving father and I respected him greatly, and --\nand love him dearly, but he was not what we think of as a dad in the United States, there. There\nwas no such thing as going to a ballgame or even going on vacation. I don\u2019t remember my father\never taking me on a vacation trip or anything. He worked -- he worked hard, he was in the\nconstruction business. But we had eight children, I was the -- the youngest of the eight and my\nfather had been quite successful in business. All of my brothers, with one exception, all worked\nfor my father. They all went into the building trade, plastering and bricklaying and carpentry, and\neach one of them had a specialty and they worked in my father\u2019s company. And naturally that\u2019s\nwhat was in store for me. Well, for some reason or other I had different ideas, I\u2019m -- I had\nambitions. So when we came to the United States my father resisted my interest in having an\neducation, and he -- he liked to point out that he never went to college, and he never even went to\nhigh school, and he was a success in life, why did I want to waste my time? And he had peculiar\nideas, and -- you know. Don\u2019t read so much, you\u2019 ll ge -- you\u2019Il ruin your eyes. And he didn\u2019t\neven want me to have a bicycle because he said it was a useless article, y-you pump your legs off\nto give your rear end a ride, you know. But he had very narrow views about that sort of thing.\nBut strangely enough, when I insisted and followed my own path, he was the first one to step up\nfront and point with pride. And he did really enjoy whatever success I had in school. He -- he\ntook upon himself to let everybody know that -- when I became a valedictorian in high school, he\n-- he patted himself on the back, too, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a --",
        "Q: Do you think he was frightened in some way of the difference that -- how you were different\nfrom --",
        "A: Of -- that\u2019s absolute -- that\u2019s absolutely right, he -- he -- he never adapted. And he made the\nsacrifice, coming to the United States, for my sake. And I\u2019ve always given him credit for that.\nBut he never assimilated. He never wanted to be part of the -- he -- he didn\u2019t even bother to learn\nthe language. He wanted to just remain what -- what he was. And proud of it. But -- and so I\ndidn\u2019t fit that pattern, right, I created a pattern of my own. And naturally, with his old fashioned,\nbasically European viewpoint, he just didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t see that. He couldn\u2019t agree with that. I\nmean, we didn\u2019t have any arguments about it, but he would just pooh pooh the idea, na -- da --\nyou don\u2019t need to do that, I never did it, look at me. And --",
        "Q: And did your sister support your -- your doing what --",
        "A: Oh yeah, she -- as much as poss -- but I had to be pretty much on my own, because I -- I was -\n- made perfectly clear that I wasn\u2019t going to sponge off of my sister and her family. She had her -\n- her own child, she had one daughter, Madeline. And -- so it was still possible to do it in the\nUnited States --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- the land of opportunity, and for me it was.",
        "Q: Did your dad work when he came over here, or did he stop working?",
        "A: Well, he wa -- he was really -- he stopped working as far as following his trade was\nconcerned. But he did work around the neighborhood. He would, you know, repair things for --\nfor people and do some small building jobs and that sort of thing, and -- but we sold our family\nhomestead -- our family home, and my father could pretty much live on that. He -- he was up in\nyears, he was a --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- see, well it\u2019s the 50 -- he was born in 1972 -- a -- 1872 rather.",
        "Q: 1872. Right, so he wasn\u2019t such a young --",
        "A: So, he was retired.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And so. But he did manage to keep busy around the neighborhood and -- in Akron and earn\nsome pocket money and so forth, but there was never a -- never any want, I mean --",
        "Q: So he never learned English?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: He -- oh, he never [indecipherable]",
        "Q: He never learned English?",
        "A: No, no, it -- he could -- he\u2019d read the paper, at least he pretended to read, and he kept pretty\nmuch informed of what\u2019s going on. But there was a German church in -- in Akron that he went\nto. At least one sermon was preached in German in Saint Bernard church, I recall. So he kept up\nhis contacts that way, and he subscribed to a -- a Luxembourg paper and a German paper. He\ncould read German. Although he was born in f -- in France, his French was not very good. He\nwas primarily Germanic because his family had moved from Paris to the Saar Basin, at the time\nthat Saar was still a part of France.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Of course, the Saar went back and forth and one time German, then it was independent, and\nthen it was again part of France. So in the Saar almost everybody spoke French and German, too.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But my father primarily spoke the Saar dialect, which is very close to the Luxembourg patois.",
        "Q: Did you like -- did you like the idea of coming to the United States? Were you happy about\nthat?",
        "A: Well, I think -- you know, I wa -- I was -- the only movies I saw at Luxembourg were\nAmerican movies and they were cowboy movies, Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson. And the idea of\ncowboys and Indians appealed to me. There\u2019s an author that every boy in -- in Luxembourg, and\nfor that matter, I think 1n western Europe reads as a boy and those are a series of novels about the\nAmerican Indians and cowboys, written by Karl May. And everybody has read Karl May, as I\ndid. And so I fantasized, I had ideas of what life was like in United States. That part appealed to\nme very much, but I was 12 years old, going on 13, and the idea of also leaving all my friends,\nand the culture that I was used to in Luxembourg, that created some problems, so I had a\nconflict. I was excited in one way, and another way a -- I could hardly wait to have it happen.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Yet, I -- I was afraid of it. So the -- I didn\u2019t want to leave, so --",
        "Q: Wh-When you came here in \u00b031, it\u2019s two years prior to the Nazis taking over in Germany.\nWhen they take over in Germany, does that impact you at all? I mean, you\u2019re still European in\nsome way, so the consciousness of what\u2019s going on in Europe --",
        "A: Oh, I think I was too young to be aware of -- of really what was going on. I don\u2019t think that I\nbecame particularly interested in what was happening. Wa -- once we got to the States, I did, I\nthink, what I now think every immigrant should do. First of all concentrate on learning the\nlanguage, and I -- I couldn\u2019t speak a word of English, so I had work pretty hard, because I went\nto school, public school, and they immediately sent me back two years. I should have been in the\neighth grade, and I ended up in the sixth grade, but before that I -- they put me in kindergarten.\nAnd here I am 13 years old, and I\u2019m in kindergarten, the biggest boy in class, but that was the\nonly advantage. But I had to learn English from the bottom up, and I spent th-three months in\nkindergarten and then a couple of more months in the third grade. And then moved me up to,\nfinally, the sixth grade, and I went on from there. But I think I concentrated on becoming a Boy\nScout, and becoming Americanized, and I -- I loved the Boy Scout experience. That contributed\na great deal to my Americanization. And learning the language was -- was a challenge. And as I\nsay, assimilating, which I -- I think is essential to become a part of the American scene, you\nknow, you should. So I didn\u2019t -- I really sort of forgot all about Luxembourg and -- to the point\nwhere even corresponding with my friends became secondary and I didn\u2019t do much of it any\nmore. That all came back later, see.",
        "Q: Right. But all of your brothers and sisters, except for Marie, are -- are in Luxembourg.",
        "A: One more brother had come to Chicago.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I had a brother in Chicago, my brother Ted. And my sister Marie in Akron. All the others\nwere -- were back in Luxembourg.",
        "Q: So was there some concern then, when the war started in \u00b039 --",
        "A: Very much so, and of course, after the war started, there was no communication, and no mail,\nwe couldn\u2019t get any. After the -- the Germans occupied Luxembourg, mail service to the United\nStates was just unheard of. The only way -- I think once or twice we did get some\ncommunication from one of my brothers, because somebody who was going to another country,\nmailed a letter for him, I -- I do recall my -- my father getting a letter once from my brother\nHeinrich that way. But there was no communication. N-No such thing as transatlantic telephone\ncalls, and -- and the mail service was nonexistent. But there th -- there\u2019s definitely a -- a\ncessation of communication. There was just no -- no way of being in touch, so --",
        "Q: So when did you gra -- you graduated high school when, in \u201938, \u00b039?",
        "A: 1938.",
        "Q: \u00b038?",
        "A: Yes. Akron -- Akron North High School. That --",
        "Q: So then the question is w-well now what? Because now you have to pave the way for the next\nstep [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, I had -- as I say, I had pretty much made up my mind, and -- and -- and this is a --\nagain, the -- the a -- the hero worship that we\u2019re all guilty of in our youth, and I had picked my\nhero. He was a scout executive, a camp director. My favorite place in the United States as a boy\nwas the scout camp, Camp Manatoc in Akron, Ohio, that I attended regularly. In fact, I\nremember my junior year in high school, I spent more nights at camp than I did in my own bed at\nhome. But I loved Camp Manatoc, an -- an -- an ideal boy scout camp, and the man who was\ncamp director of it, was just the -- he was my idol. He was the kind of man I wanted to be in\nevery way. Tall, and handsome and -- and a beautiful singing voice, a speaking voice. A lot of\npersonality and that is what I wanted to be like. And I decided I would be a professional scout\nexecutive so I could be like Mr. Josselle and follow in that -- that pattern. So naturally that meant\nan education and going to college, and my ambition was to get a college degree and go into\nprofessional scouting. And I had the audacity at that time to write to the chief scout executive,\nDr. James E. West, I recall at that time, professional scout executive. And they answered my\nletter, and we started up a correspondence. He s -- sort of became my -- my mentor by mail,\nencouraging me on what to study in high school and college and preparing myself for a\nprofessional career in scouting. So that was my idea. Well, at scout camp I met some of the\nyounger leaders, who were students at Miami University. And there was also one who was a -- a\ngraduate of Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania. And both of these\ninterests, they started recruiting me for their particular institution. And I did get a scholarship at\nWashington and Jefferson. And it was worth a lot more financially than another scholarship I had\nat Miami University, so I decided to go to Washington and Jefferson. And I would graduate and\nthen go to the Schiff scout reservation and become a professional scout executive. That was my\nambition. Then I fell in love and -- during the summer of 1938, I met the young lady whom I\nsubsequently married. And we decided during our summer romance that we would go to college\ntogether. And that meant going to a co-educational school. So --",
        "Q: You switched.",
        "A: Washington and Jefferson was a male school, all male. So I ended up taking the scholarship\nfrom Miami University because then we can go together.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That wasn\u2019t the only reason. Miami also had a good reputation, was a good school and there\nwere a lot of alumni who influenced me at scout camp. So we made a very happy choice. And\nwe both enrolled at Miami University and went all through college together, four years.",
        "Q: And what were you studying there?",
        "A: Oh, I majored in psychology, again at Dr. West\u2019s suggestion. As a scout executive he thought\npsychology ought to be my major because it\u2019s working with people, understanding people, and\nworking with scouts and the whole leadership concept, so I majored in psychology for that\nparticular reason, so --",
        "Q: Which became very fortuitous for you later on when [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, came -- s-served me -- it served me very well --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- later on too, see, Particular at -- it tied in as part of my pattern of circles into what\neventually did happen during the war and --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- my career in the military and afterwards, so --",
        "Q: Now, by the time you\u2019re at the university, you\u2019re a young man, you\u2019re in love and having a\nrela -- a relationship. Are you now much more conscious of the war in -- in an everyday way?",
        "A: Oh yes, th-the -- the minute wore broke out we became very conscious of it.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And of course we were in school, we were in -- you know, in an education institution and I\nwas taking a lot of courses that involved current events and development in Europe. And then\nbecause of my European connection, I really went into that as a -- I became an avid follower of\nthe news, of what was happening in -- in -- in Luxembourg particularly after the Germans\ninvaded Luxembourg. You know, after all, they were invading my homeland. Now I became\nvery much concerned and followed it very closely. And I think what -- what added to the -- the\nstimulus there was not being able to communicate with anybody in Luxembourg, and that sort of\nadded an extra challenge, or pizzazz to the whole relationship.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I was very conscious of what was going on in Europe by then, so --",
        "Q: Were there courses on the rise of Nazism, on th-the kind of society, or -- or was it too soon\nfor that sort of thing?",
        "A: Much too soon.",
        "Q: Much too soon.",
        "A: Actually, a -- an-and this is something that -- that really struck me during the war and after the\nwar and now, in retrospect, how very little we knew about what was going on in Germany. We\nreally -- from the in -- the military intelligence standpoint and the political intelligence\nstandpoint, we had no idea what Nazism was all about, I mean the headlines, nothing in depth.\nAnd much of what we did learn, scratchy as it was -- sketchy as it was, was written off as\npropaganda.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s the sort of thing we -- we said about the Germans in World War I. And you\nknow, there were the America [indecipherable] who were very active in the early stage, 1939 -\n1940, before Pearl Harbor and before we got involved. And there was this feeling of this is not\nour war, this is none of our business, and -- so what little we did know that could be introduced\nin a history class or political science class was either propaganda or as I say, was on the surface,\nnothing really in depth. And it wasn\u2019t, until we got involved in the war, and began to make\npersonal contact with prisoners of war, and with German government officials, that we began to\nbecome aware of what Nazism 1s all about. And this is what made my own assignment such a big\nchallenge. We were pioneering in military intelligence work.",
        "Q: So tell me, when -- le-let me just go back a little bit, although I\u2019m trying to figure out how old\nyou were. In 1938, when Kristallnacht happens in Germany and there\u2019s all these riots and 30,000\npe -- Jews are put into -- arrested, do you hear about this?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t?",
        "A: What -- what we did here, as I say, was -- was very sketchy. Remember now, we were no\nlonger allowing refugees to come to United States.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We actually turned them away, as you know, which I think is one of the -- the dark sides in\nAmerican history. But no German immigrants came to the United States after the -- the war\nbegan. And -- and after Nazism, when the Germans starting working on a final solution. So the\ninformation we had, as I say, was -- was very incomplete and a lot of it was written off as -- as\npropaganda.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: We -- we really didn\u2019t know -- Kristallnacht, that could be a perfectly good propaganda story.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: A-And so what? So they were going around breaking windows, who cared? We -- we didn\u2019t\nreally take any of that seriously, unfortunately.",
        "Q: Did you hear about the Nazi Olympics in \u201936, and the issue of should Jewish boys go -- go\nover and participate, or not?",
        "A: D-During the 1936 --",
        "Q: 1936.",
        "A: -- Olympic?",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Oh yes, well of course, we were very excited about our own Jesse Owens --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and -- and proud of that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But that was -- that really had nothing to do with the politics of it as far as we as young people\nare concerned --",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- in other words, gee, our boy won --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and so one of our -- one of our guys made it. And we didn\u2019t relate that to the philosophy of\nNazism versus democracy or -- or anything else, no, no.",
        "Q: So tell me, you --",
        "A: We were quite naive.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You both -- you graduated and got married in 1942, is that right?",
        "A: We -- we got married first.",
        "Q: First.",
        "A: Which -- you know, Miami University, like many other institutions, Miami University is a\nstate institution and very strict regulations. I remember when we started going to college, my\nfreshman year boys and girls didn\u2019t even sit together at a football game.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I mean, we had a woman\u2019s section and a men\u2019s section. And that changed during the course\nof my freshman year. But there was a lot of strict regulation. Girls had to be in at 11 o\u2019clock at\nnight on Fridays, 10 o\u2019clock during the week. No telephone calls after 10 o\u2019clock, or before three\no\u2019clock in the afternoon. It was very rigid. The idea of two students being married to each other\nand going to school at Miami University was -- that just didn\u2019t exist. Well, then came Pearl\nHarbor, in December \u2019\u00b040 -- 1941, and I -- I felt -- I -- I really felt that I wanted -- not only would\nget involved, but wanted to get involved. And so I signed up for the navy, a special\n[indecipherable] program. I was going to go in the navy and get -- when I graduated, and through\n[indecipherable] program I could go to a special training school and graduate as an ensign in the\nnavy and that would be the natural thing for me to do. So we knew that was going to happen, and\nif that\u2019s the case, then we wanted to get married before I left. So the university had, meanwhile,\nchanged the rules after Pearl Harbor and many of the students who wanted to get married, could.\nNow we were the first to sign up. So in January 17\", 1942, a month after Pearl Harbor, a little\nover, we got married on the weekend in Oxford. I remember our classes were dismissed. Our\nprofessors came to our wedding. We still have a -- a film of a -- of our wedding that my father-\nin-law took, and -- of all my professors coming to our wedding, including the president of the\nuniversity and his wife, Dr. and Mrs. Upham. And they gave us special permission to get\nmarried. And we started it and then of course there were others who did the same thing. Well, as\nit turned out, I didn\u2019t get that navy program because I hadn\u2019t been a naturalized citizen long\nenough. You -- you -- and I don\u2019t know if the navy still has that rule, but you could not become\nan officer in the navy, air force or marines, unless you\u2019d been a American citizen 10 years. You\ncould be an officer in the army, but not in the other branches. So I had gone through all the\nprocedures of joining this [indecipherable] program when they decided I hadn\u2019t been a citizen\nlong enough and didn\u2019t qualify. So I just continued my course. Then the draft board got me.\nNaturally, and we expected that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And they put me in one B. That was a -- one A were drafted immediately, one B you were\npostponed because you were in school, or -- and I had a slight vision problem in my left eye,\nwhich I didn\u2019t even know about. So they classified me one B, which meant we could get married\n-- we could graduate. We were married, we could graduate. So we actually graduated in June of\n1942. And meanwhile I got a job with Proctor and Gamble in Cincinnati, and we set up\nhousekeeping in Cincinnati. And then in November of \u201942, one B number came up and my\npostponement -- postponement had ended. So on November 13\", 1942, I got the word, you\nknow, you\u2019re now in the army. So that changed everything, so we were ready to go. We\nanticipated it all along, just a matter of time, you know. And believe it or not, you know, I was\ndrafted, but I really was eager to go. I felt \u2019'd benefited so much and -- and I don\u2019t have a false\nsense of patriotism, it\u2019s very genuine. I really thought I wanted to serve and at the same time\nthere was a relationship with -- I wanted to help liberate Luxembourg, so there\u2019s a little bit of\nthat entered into it as well, so 1t was a -- a mutual, satisfying agreement.",
        "Q: So do you go first to basic training?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Basic training.",
        "Q: How basic was it?",
        "A: Well, th-that, of course, is a -- you know, every once in awhile I ma -- I\u2019m making a speech\nand -- and I have a lot of fun explaining how I actually ended up where I eventually did. But I\nknow when I was inducted at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and a -- a -- a young personnel officer, I\nthink was a corporal or a PFC asked me what I could do, and I told him I could speak German\nfluently and I\u2019d like to get into -- into military intelligence. And his answer, \u201cWell did you ever\ndrive a truck?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, but I can speak German fluently.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to give up so easily.\nBut he wanted to know if I could drive a bus or a tractor, or -- or plow with something heavy,\nwith air brakes, and -- and no I didn\u2019t qualify for any of that. But by that time my minute and a\nhalf was over, and I ended up being sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky to be a tank driver. That\u2019s what\nthey needed that particular day. So I started my career in the army being trained to be a tank\ndriver. I was in the armored force, armored force replacement training center at Fort Knox. So I\nlearn how to drive a heavy vehicle in the armored force, even a motorcycle, which I hated. But\nthe big trucks and armored cars and tanks; fired every weapon from a revolver on up to the big\nHowitzers and, you know, it\u2019s kind of exciting, right? I -- I -- I kind of liked it. So, after I\nfinished my basic training, I did have a college degree, the army decided I was officer material.\nSo I became one of those 90 day wonders. I went to officer\u2019s candidate school and after 90 days\nat Fort Knox, I got a commission as a second lieutenant. And incidentally got my commission\nfrom General George S. Patton, Jr. General Patton was the commencement speaker when I -- I\ngraduated. And my commission was in mechanized cavalry, and since Patton was a cavalry\ngeneral, he pinned a cavalry insignia on the -- the members of my class who were taken into the\nmechanized cavalry, there were 10 of us -- 10 of us. So I thought that was a -- a good beginning\nof my career. Course Patton wasn\u2019t as famous then as -- as he subsequently became, but --",
        "Q: Can you explain what mechanized cavalry is?",
        "A: Well, you know, the horse cavalry.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, during World War II, we\u2019re -- we\u2019re now --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] horses.",
        "A: -- mechanized cavalry, and the mechanized cavalry 1s light -- light tanks and fast moving\nvehicles, Jeeps, light tanks and light armored cars, half tracks, actually. And the mechanized\ncavalry is used for reconnaissance. They\u2019re in the forefront, they\u2019re reconnoitering th-the terrain\nand enemy strength. So reconnaissance 1s the -- the spearhead of an armored division, and\narmored division, of course, are your heavy guns and your heavy tanks, and you have your c-\ncavalry reconnaissance for the lead, to explore the territory ahead, so -- and that was the purpose\nof the mechanized cavalry. I was assigned to the 23\u2122 cavalry reconnaissance squadron of the 16\"\narmored division, Camp Chaffee, Arkansas. So after I got my commission, that was my first\nmilitary assignment, in Arkansas, 16\" armored division, so -- then, months later, the army found\nout I could speak German.",
        "Q: It finally got to them.",
        "A: And that ties into what -- what I said earlier. We were ready to invade North Africa and we\nwere going to begin to make our first eyeball to eyeball contact with the enemy and it suddenly\noccurred to somebody here in Washington that gee, you know, what are we going to talk to them\nabout? And who\u2019s going to do the talking? We hadn\u2019t thought of setting up ike -- IPW teams, or\ncounterintelligence teams, or -- we hadn\u2019t even thought of military government, in case we won\nthe war. So all of a sudden the lights went on and they decided we got to round up all the people\nwho can speak German. So regardless of where you belonged, or regardless of what your\nbackground was, if you spoke German, you -- you got yanked into military intelligence. And just\na -- acry went out, order went out, cooks, bakers, quartermasters, even some medical personnel,\nall put in the military intelligence.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And we were sent to Camp Richie, Camp Richie, Maryland, which is the Maryland National\nGuard camp, about 90 miles north of Washington. And that became the secret training center for\nmilitary intelligence personnel. And that\u2019s where I ended up on very short notice, from Arkansas\nto Camp Richie, Maryland. So I was transferred from the armored force to military intelligence.\nAnd my specialty then wa-was interrogating prisoners of war. That\u2019s what I was trained to do.",
        "Q: How many of you were sent there [indecipherable] Richie, Maryland, do you think?",
        "A: Oho, that is a -- you know, 1-if I were younger and had the ambition, I\u2019d write another book\nand I -- I would just write about Camp Richie, because that was the most fascinating place. You\ncould -- there was a poem that a very intelligent military intelligence officer wrote, and it starts\nout, was you ever at Camp Richie, the [indecipherable] of all, where the sun comes up like\n[indecipherable] recorded bugle call. And that\u2019s the way the poem starts out. You could hear\nevery language under the sun spoken at Camp Richie, Maryland. And they brought in people --\nnot just German speaking, French, Italian, Arabic, everything. You -- you -- we had a\nconglomeration of people. And quite a few, including quite a few Jewish refugees who had come\nto the United States earlier, who had been taken into the army, they were all sent to Camp Richie\nbecause they were the only ones who could speak fluent German still. And they were the ideal\nmilitary government and military intelligence personnel. Their -- their f -- their German was\nfluent. There were very few a -- a that type of German speaking military personnel available. So\nmost of the others were people who had studied German in school, or majored in German in\ncollege, or had German parents who spoke German at home. But the real fluent German speaker\n-- and a lot of our intelligent officers were -- were Jewish. My colleagues at -- that I lived with\nwere all refugee families who had come to these United States early, in the 30\u2019s, with their\nfamilies. So all these people were thrown together and they had different sections, there were\neight sections all together, and I was in section five, that was the IPW section. But there were the\nCIC, the counter-intelligence, there was the photo interpretation, the photo intelligence, people\nwho studied aerial photos and -- and could make sense out of -- out of that particular effort. And\nth-there were the OSS people, and ha-hand to hand combat people who worked behind the lines,\nthe forerunner of the CIA. We -- we trained them in everything, and we had regular German\nprisoners of war, the very first who had been taken in North Africa were brought to Camp\nRichie. And the -- we -- you know, we had a chance to practice first hand --",
        "Q: I was going to --",
        "A: -- with real German prisoners. So it was a -- a very exciting place. What we taught then was\nGerman army organization, which we knew nothing about. National Socialism, which we knew\nvery little about. All the paramilitary organizations under the Hitler regime, we didn\u2019t know what\nthe NSKK was, or the NSFK, the National Socialist Flying Corps, National Socialist Motor\nCorps. This was the paramilitary that the Hitler regime had organized. These people were getting\nsubtle military training by belonging to the truck driver\u2019s corps, or the flying corps, but they\nwere being prepared for military. So there were a lot of those. Germany was limited to a hundred\nthousand man army, but bor -- by the time Hitler was ready to invade Poland, he had more than a\nhundred thousand men, I mean, well trained from the Hitler youth on up. We didn\u2019t know that.\nWe had to learn about all these things. We learned about the characteristics and the personalities\nof the high ranking Nazis; we knew nothing about them. If you\u2019ve heard of the film, \u201cTriumph\ndes Willens\u2019, that was our -- our text -- o-our textbook, I should say. Every Thursday I recall, all\nthe classes -- the German classes were brought together in a theater at -- at Camp Richie, and we\nshowed Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s, \u201cTriumph des Willens,\u201d a three hour documentary of a Nuremberg\nrally. And that was the only documentary film, and the only photographic evidence we had of the\nNazi leaders, like Hess, and Goering, and Stryker, and Lie, and seeing them perform in this,\n\u201cTriumph des Willens,\u201d in this film, was the only way that our -- our trainees could learn\nanything about what these Nazis even looked like. That was the beginning of it, and that\u2019s all we\nhad to go on. So our training was somewhat primitive. We had limited intelligence, really,\nbecause we hadn\u2019t done much over there in the way of gathering information, so --",
        "Q: So who were -- who were the teachers? Were they historians, or were they mil -- another set\nof military intelligence people?",
        "A: They were -- they were people like me. For instance, the course lasted two months, and\nduring that time you learned or-order battle and German army, all the things that I mentioned.\nThen you were sent overseas as a member of an IPW team, which consisted of two officers and\nthree or four enlisted men, all trained at Richie. And you would go overseas and be assigned to a\ndivision, or -- or a regiment, or even an army group, or an army, as interrogator and when those\nunits advanced and took prisoners, the IPW team interrogated them. So Camp Richie was\nfeeding all these interrogators and other intel-telligence personnel to the different divisions as\nfast as we could produce them. Well, every once in awhile there\u2019d be a graduate like me, who\nalso had pretty good training -- [phone ringing |",
        "Q: Excuse me [indecipherable] stop? Are we okay? I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t unplug the phone. They\nshould know when to call back here.",
        "A: Changing film?",
        "Q: No, there was a f -- the f -- the -- the telephone rang, for some reason.",
        "A: Oh, oh.",
        "Q: Can you find the plug? That\u2019s -- you\u2019re having trouble [indecipherable]. All right, we\u2019re back\nfrom our little interruptions. You were talking about --",
        "A: Yeah, well, there were people like me --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- with -- with a -- a college education, and particularly a psychology major, which was\nexactly the sort of thing they wanted. To interrogate prisoners of war you kind of have to have a\nlittle bit of a psychological background -- the -- from the technique of it. And then the German\nlanguage. But th-the military training I had gave me an advantage over those who came from the\nquartermaster corps, or the cooks and bakers school, and -- or some other branch of the service\nwhich was not as military as technical. So I became a teacher. And I started training others,\ninstead of going overseas as a member of an IPW team, I became one of the -- the staff members\nin section five. Our commanding officer was the colonel, Colonel Warndorf, and the -- the other\nteachers in that section, in the German section were graduates of the Richie school who had been\npicked because they had specific background that made good teachers of them. So they were the\nones who were teaching others. By then we were also getting not just people that we were\ntraining in interrogation, but we were also getting general officers and field grade officers from\nmilitary divisions in the country and also some from units already overseas, who were brought\nback to get some special training in military intelligence, particularly aerial photos and\ninterrogation and -- and order of battle, German army organization, that sort of thing. So our\nstudents were not only in a German section IPW members, they were also what we call the S2\nand G2 officers of different divisions. So I was a second lieutenant and a lot of my students were\ngeneral officers, who were the G2 of their divisions, who came for their special training course at\nCamp Richie. It was a very exciting, a very interesting time. And our staff sergeant at the -- in\nsection five, for instance, was Walter Schneider. Walter Schneider was an assistant manager the\nWaldorf-Astoria. Our chef in the mess hall a-at Camp Richie was a chef from one of the leading\n-- | forget which -- hotel of -- of New York or Boston, but he was a super chef and the food was\nsuperb. It was served on metal trays, but it was wonderful. It was gourmet food. The food was\nsuperb because the people we brought in to Richie, we -- were special -- specialists in different\nfields, including cooks and bakers. So -- so we had the best.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Cu -- they could also speak German, so that helped also.",
        "Q: Tell me, in th -- in the training, in your courses, when -- when you were being taught, were\npeople talking about the Holocaust at all, about the murder of Jews?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: None?",
        "A: No, no, very --",
        "Q: So it was the structure of National Socialism, and the structure of the military, etcetera?",
        "A: Yeah, it -- mostly military based, because that\u2019s what we were interested in getting\ninformation about.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They -- the Holocaust and the atrocities as-associated with the Nazi regime was not part of the\nmilitary.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: W1 -- we really didn\u2019t know too much about it. A lot of that didn\u2019t begin to develop until we\nstarted invading Germany and liberating camps and saw what was going on.",
        "Q: Now the Jewish boy, I ga -- these are all men in the -- in Camp Richie, yes? The -- the Jewish\nfellows that you met, who had experience with the Nazis --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- did you talk to them and find out things?",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes, now that was -- but that was not part of the training.",
        "Q: I understand.",
        "A: That would be a personal relationship.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And frankly, you take a lot of that with a grain of salt, and you say, well, you know, that\nsounds like propaganda. That\u2019s supposed to make us hate the Germans. Is it really true? And you\nhad to really get to know the people and once you had their -- they had your confidence, then you\nbegan to realize there\u2019s something to this. But that came much later, really. I know oh, golly,\nnames like Watson, Landauer, Daniels, Verna Daniels, Viel. These are all Jewish colleagues of\nmine, and much of what they knew is hearsay, second hand information. So that was not part of\nthe official development or training at all. That was -- that was talk. You know, was just\nsomebody re -- reciting a story that he had heard from somebody else, about somebody. Ya -- ya\n-- you know, as I say, we -- we had no refugees. Nobody who had been in a concentration camp\ncame to Germany -- I mean, came from Germany to the United States, not at that time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, that -- that\u2019s all post-war.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we really were, as I say, very naive. Probably no one was more surprised -- and I speak\nfirst hand knowledge -- at the atrocities or the things that they saw than some of our commanding\ngenerals, like Eisenhower and -- and Bradley, as our units advanced, and the advancing troops\nwould liberate a camp and then generals like Eisenhower and -- and others would come and see\nfor the first time. And that\u2019s the first time they heard of some of these things.",
        "Q: Or, what you\u2019re saying is that they heard of them, and they thought it was propaganda.",
        "A: That -- yeah, didn\u2019t believe it, it -- 1t was, you know, we went back to first World War, and\nthe Germans were mutilating nuns and that kind of stories you heard.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: See, but that\u2019s necessary in war. You have to -- you have to make propaganda in order to\nmake you hate the enemy and fight him. So it was taken with a grain of salt.",
        "Q: So you saw the w -- the war -- I don\u2019t want to say it was sort of a natural war, but it was -- it\nwas just a war. These were the enemy --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- and they happened to be a big enemy.",
        "A: They were -- we\u2019re looking at it fr --",
        "Q: They\u2019re just a --",
        "A: -- yeah, we\u2019re looking at strictly from the military standpoint --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- you know? We just -- the rest of it really was -- came much later --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- much to our surprise.",
        "Q: Right. So how long do you stay in Camp Richie? This 1 -- til ni -- yeah, how long are you\nthere? You go there when?",
        "A: Yeah, the training course is two months.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And then you were immediately shipped out.",
        "Q: Right. But you weren\u2019t.",
        "A: But -- but I stayed another 10 months beyond that. Meanwhile, we had -- when I was assigned\nto the 16\" armored division at Camp Chaffee, Arkansas, that was a brand new division, and I\nwas a cavalry officer, in other words I -- we were training people for that division. So I knew I\nwould be in Arkansas at least two years before I go overseas. So we decided now is the time to\nhave a family. Then when my wife was nine months pregnant, one week before our firstborn\nchild was due, I was transferred to military intelligence. Boom. And that -- that was a big\nsurprise. Now everything changed. Well, Winnie, my wife, decided I at least had -- had to see the\nbaby. So a week before Johnny Mike was due, she got permission from her doctor in Arkansas to\nmake the trip and she came from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Blueridge Summit, Pennsylvania by\ntrain, on a troop train. Arrived on a Monday, and our Mike was born the Sunday of that week,\nMother\u2019s day, 56 years ago this Sunday. He was born in Blueridge Summit, Pennsylvania, so --\nand we had to decide whether Mike would be -- whether Winnie would be taken to the hospital\nin Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, which is near Blueridge Summit, or Hagerstown. And the doctor\non Sunday morning decided Waynesboro, so our Mike was born north of the Mason-Dixon line.\nBut if Dr. Bridges had decided to go to Hagerstown, we\u2019d have had a southerner in our family.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Cause Blueridge Summit is right on the Mason-Dixon line, so -- so -- but -- so now we had a\nbaby and I was at Richie for 10 months, so I was able to see our child at least up til the age of --\nof 10 months.",
        "Q: So did Winnie then come and live with you in Camp Richie?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Well, she came to Camp Richie, yes, an-and that\u2019s where --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- we lived in Blueridge Summit --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Camp Richie was --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- right about a mile from Blueridge Summit, and we lived in Blueridge Summit,\nPennsylvania, it\u2019s right on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania. And when -- and then when\nI was shipped overseas, she went home to Akron with the baby, you know --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and lived with her sister who also had a husband in the army, so the two sisters kept house.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] right. So you\u2019re shipped out of the United States in April of 1945, is that\nright?",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And do you know your destination?",
        "A: No, that was all -- that was top secret. I had no idea what I was going to do or where I was\ngoing. We left out of Camp Kilmer, New York on a troop train -- troop -- on the troop ship. That\nwas the -- the Ile de France, a luxury liner which had been converted into a -- a troop ship. And\nwe went from New York then to Greenark, Scotland and from there by train all the way south to\nSouthampton, England. And then by ferry boat, actually, ferry steamer across the channel into Le\nHavre and then by troop train from Le Havre, eventually to Paris after doing a lot of zigzag-ing\nbecause somebody gotten our orders messed up, we were -- ended up in the wrong place, and the\nship back to Paris. Then I was in Paris about five days, in La Vaisam\u00e9, which was the temporary\nheadquarters of military intelligence in Paris at that particular point. And then I was assigned to\nthe 6824 DIC. 6824 detailed interrogation center. Now here I have to distinguish between the\nregular IPW team that I mentioned earlier. Their function was to get tactical information.\nTactical meaning what\u2019s going on across the river, or what unit is our unit facing. When are they\nplanning to attack, how strong are they. That\u2019s t-tactics. We were also interested now, at this late\nstage of the game in strategic information. Again, we want to know more about do the Germans\nhave the atom bomb? What\u2019s this V1 and V2 business? Chemical bacterial warfare. All of those\nthings we knew nothing about. That was strategic information, and we call that detailed\ninterrogation. So we had a center in the Ardens in northern France, [indecipherable] way up the\npoint where the Mers river goes into Belgium and then comes back down, we were there in a\nhunting lodge. And we\u2019d taken over this little town of Revan. We were billeted in private homes\nand -- and used a hunting lodge for our working area. And we brought prisoners who had\nstrategic information, like general officers, members of the German generals staff. Chemists,\nscientists, physicists, working on the V1, V2. Anybody who had information at a strategic, high\npolitical level, we would bring to this -- taken prisoner along the battlefields anywhere, we\nwould bring to this detailed interrogation center for strategic information. Some of them we\nwould find would have such valuable information that we bring them to the States. Now we had\na very secret place, whose name I still don\u2019t know, right here in Washington, where we brought\nGerman prisoners of war who knew inside information on a very high ranking -- well, anyhow,\nmy assignment was a really exciting one. I was given a Jeep and a driver, and orders by\ncommand of General Eisenhower, I could go anywhere I wanted to go. And my job was to go\nwherever there were prisoners, which was now everywhere.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And screen prisoners that we thought might have this kind of strategic information. A lot of\nGerman generals put on enlisted men\u2019s uniforms and were taken prisoner as ordinary corporals\nand privates, but they were really general officers. So we had to find that kind of people, and\nthose who were scientists and -- and had this kind of information we wanted. If they did, I would\narrange to have them shipped back to Revan for detailed interrogation. So my job was to travel\nall along the front wi -- as we were advancing toward the end of the war, and talk to interrogation\nofficers who thought they had a prisoner who --",
        "Q: Who would fit this.",
        "A: -- who -- who will fit that category, and then I would interrogate him and if he did, then I\nbring him back to Revan, to 6824DIC. So that was my job. So, I could go wherever I wanted,\nwhich opened up a lot of adventures, you know, like the Lipizzaner horses that I mention in my\nbook.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: I happened to be at the right place at the right time. Or the liberation of Dachau.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I arrived there the day after Dachau was liberated. Or, going back in my own unit, I found out\nwhere the 16\" armored division that I had trained with in Arkansas, I found out where it was, so\nI could say, okay, let\u2019s go there. So even up to Czechoslovakia, and the 16\" armored division\nwas going into Pilsen, and so I saw some of my old colleagues again, friends that I had trained\nwith in Arkansas, pattern of circles. I met them just outside of Pilsen, Czechoslovakia during the\nend of the war. And that\u2019s where we had the Lipizzaner horse adventure, and that\u2019s when --\nwhere the war ended. That\u2019s where I happened to be when it all came to an end, so -- so --",
        "Q: Right. Well, the -- the tape is running out --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- so we\u2019re going to change tapes and get back to some of these stories.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Tell me about your arrival in Dachau the day after it was liberated, that must have been some\nexperience for you.",
        "A: I had never heard of Dachau before, I didn\u2019t know anything about it. All I knew was that I\nwanted to go into Munich to look for a place to sleep, really. During the war when we were\ntraveling like this, and there were just my driver and I, and we were just try to find a military\nunit, one of ours, that was billeted in some hotel, and -- or whenever we advanced, they would\nfind a public building, like a hotel, and just confiscate it and say this is the headquarters. And this\nis where the division officers would -- would sleep and they would just take over the hotel. So\nwith my orders, which were really marvelous because I was traveling by command of General\nEisenhower, I could get a room or a free meal almost anyplace I went. So we were always\nlooking for some place like that, and I was heading toward Munich when I -- I don\u2019t know\nwhether -- whether my driver, or whether we were getting directions from someone, toward\nDachau just outside of Munich and -- and -- and so we went over that way. And then came -- just\nto see what -- what was going on there. We had heard in getting the directions that this was a\nspecial camp that the -- the Germans had operated. So we made a little detour on our way to\nMunich. Actually, it was on the way, and then came upon Dachau. Then I found that it was just\nthe day after the liberation -- the -- the day -- actually, it was two days after, because the day\nafter the liberation, the grand duke of Luxembourg, the Prince Felix -- not the grand duke, but\nthe Prince Consort of the Grand Duchess had been there to greet and liberate, or -- or be present\nfor the liberation of Luxembourgers who had been at the Dachau concentration camp. So if I had\nbeen there one day earlier, I would have had the opportunity to meet the -- th-the Prince Consort,\nPrince Felix. So we got there, and -- and that\u2019s how we came upon the camp. Even then, I don\u2019t\nthink it made an impact on me that it has in retrospect, looking back on it, having learned so\nmuch more about the Holocaust and the atrocities, all I know is this was a horrible place. But I\nthought it was -- my first interpretation without anybody telling me -- we really didn\u2019t know. I\nsay -- we honestly were very naive. Concentration camp per se didn\u2019t mean a thing to me. I\nthought this was a -- a prison camp where people who committed crimes were put. And so I\ndidn\u2019t really get the feel for this, except the hu -- the humanity aspect of it. Even a -- a prisoner\nwho committed murder shouldn\u2019t be treated the way these people had been treated, the way they\nlooked. And Dachau you know, was not a -- a death camp, Dachau was just -- but these people\nwere starving, and -- and had starved. I m-mean, the -- the corpses we saw. And it just didn\u2019t\nregister until long after, as I found out more and more about it, and I could say, I was there, I saw\nthis and didn\u2019t realize what it was.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know what you were seeing.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I didn\u2019t realize, I thought 1t was a prison camp where the prisoners were just not\nproperly treated.",
        "Q: So tell me, did you walk around, or you just --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- you just looked from your Jeep?",
        "A: No, frankly, I couldn\u2019t. I -- I\u2019m -- I have a weak stomach. I -- I really -- you know, for a long\ntime, I -- I -- I still have difficulty -- \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d was the first movie I ever saw in which a\nconcentration camp was depicted that I -- that I could tolerate, because I -- I thought it was very\ntastefully done. Was excellently -- and yed -- you know, he didn\u2019t dwell on -- he just showed\nenough to realize the horror of it without going into the detail that some of the films do. But I -- I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t like to read books that have a lot of graphic murder scenes in it, I -- I -- Ihave a\nweak stomach. That probably isn\u2019t the best way to say a we -- weak stomach, I -- I just -- I\u2019m\njust softy, I\u2019m a softy, I don\u2019t like to see people suffer. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t li-like to see animals\nsuffer, I certainly don\u2019t like to see people suffer. So I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m like a lot of other people, you\nknow, if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019d just rather not look at it anyway, if you don\u2019t\nhave to.",
        "Q: Were you frightened? When you wa -- when you came to that place?",
        "A: No, more -- more shocked. The -- the idea of, you know, inhumanity that was evident there.\nAnd as I say, I thought this was just a prison camp, where -- where prisoners were kept. Under\nthose circumstances, how could they treat people like that? Even if they deserved rough\ntreatment, they shouldn\u2019t be treated -- that was my reaction. And --",
        "Q: And how long did you stay --",
        "A: Oh not more -- we were just couple of hour -- not even couple of hours, we just --",
        "Q: Did your driver walk --",
        "A: -- going through.",
        "Q: -- or did your driver stay with you?",
        "A: Oh ya -- you -- just walked -- walked in and ge -- and the wooden gate was there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I saw -- I actually saw one person die. He was too weak to even -- a man who was just\ntoo weak to even talk. And that -- that was devastating to me. I had -- I didn\u2019t want to see much\nmore of it. I saw corpses. I saw one building that had obviously been torched with people having\nbeen locked in the building, and then tried to dig their way out underneath it. That w -- that was\nit, that was the -- the worst of it all. So beyond that I didn\u2019t want to see any more. And I -- I just -\n- I saw enough to realize how horrible it was.",
        "Q: Did you talk to the American troops who were there? Were they finding guards that you\nmight have interrogated, or did you just want to get out of there as fast as you could?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see a single German --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t see a single German?",
        "A: -- at -- at my [indecipherable] I mean, a single German soldier --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- at that point. They had already rounded up -- what happened at -- at -- and this is second\nhand information -- at -- at Buchenwald, for instance, the guards took off. I mean, they -- they\nweren\u2019t equipped to fight the advancing an -- German -- so when -- when the am -- advancing\nAmerican. When the Americans advanced, they just all ran away. And Buchenwald, the inmates\nliberated Buchenwald, and that story I know first hand because we eventually come to it because\nthere were Luxembourgers involved in the Buchenwald camp. I actually -- by then I knew quite\na bit about it, and so the Buchenwald story I know more about, even though I hadn\u2019t been there,\nof how it was liberated and so forth.",
        "Q: Well why don\u2019t you get into that and then we can go back to the -- the horse story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you --",
        "A: Well, th-the Buchenwald thing actually didn\u2019t come to my attention until the trials and then\nBuchenwald was just a name of other camps that had been there. But it became personally close\nto me during my embassy days, 40 years later. In Luxembourg there is an Amicale de\nBuchenwald, and these are Luxembourgers, some Jewish, non-Jews, some were deserters of the\narmy, some were the parents of Luxembourgers who had been forced into the German army,\nwho deserted and then the parents were thrown into the concentration camp, so we had a -- a\nmix. There were about si -- I think at that pra -- point, 74 Luxembourgers in Buchenwald who 40\nyears later still made up what they call the Amicale de Buchenwald, the alumni of Buchenwald.\nThey were liberated, or actually they saw the first the Americans at 11:30 on the 11\" of April,\n1945. They had sent an SOS on their homemade -- secretly homemade radios, giving away their\nlocation where they were. They could hear the gunfire, and they could hear even the -- the\nmotors of the tanks of the sixth armored division advancing. The Nazi guards took off, the -- the\nSS people took off, and -- and the liberators caught a few of them, and -- I mean, not the liberator\n-- the inmates caught a few of the Nazi guards before the liberators came and -- and took care of\nthem. But most of them I -- were gone. The -- the whole leadership of the camp was gone. So by\nthe time the Americans arrived, they were met with open arms by the inmates who had liberated\nthem. Well among them were these Luxembourgers. From that time on, when they got back to\nLuxembourg, they organized their reunion group, their amicale. There are a lot of these in\nLuxembourg, resistance groups who have organized alumni of this particular -- they call the\nLPL, the League Patiotigue Luxembourgoise. The LPL, that was the Luxembourg underground,\nwhich worked with the FFI. Well, they all have alumni clubs, and they have luncheons and -- and\ni-it\u2019s really a -- a very moving experience to be with those people. Well, the Amicale de\nBuchenwald for 40 years, and still today, at 11:30 on the 11\" of April, every year, meet at the\nAmerican military cemetery and place a wreath at the tomb of General Patton, whose third army\nliberated the camp. And then they have a -- a little prayer cer-ceremony and a little reminiscing\nand then they all go and have lunch together and -- and reminisce, and -- and renew their\nfriendships. Well they invited the American ambassador to participate naturally, and so I took\nthem up on it. And so I became part of the activity and it got to the point where after the first\nyear they asked me to give a talk, and I would talk to them, and -- and so that they made me an\nhonorary member of the Amicale de Buchenwald. In 1945, the -- I received a letter from the\nsixth armored division, a veteran\u2019s group, it\u2019s the sixth armored association, they\u2019re called the\nSuper Sixes. And a bunch of them are coming back to Europe to celebrate the 40\" anniversary of\nthe end of the war and the liberation. And they want to come to Luxembourg, and they asked me\nif I would speak to them at the cemetery. A lot of these veteran\u2019s groups did that. During a 10\nmonth period of celebrating the end of the war and the liberation of Luxembourg, I was at that\ncemetery 69 times in 10 months, officially, not counting times when I would take a visit or two,\nto visit. A Colonel Reed from Louisville, Kentucky, he wrote to me and -- and said that he was\nbringing a group of veterans and would I speak to them at the cemetery and of -- I said of course\nI would. But could you arrange to make your visit at a ttme when we could also have the\nAmicale de Buchenwald at the same time. I -- I mention this incident in my book, because it -- it\nwas one of the highlights I think of my embassy career. When I arrived there -- it was all --\nalways arranged for the ambassador to be the last one to arrive, when everybody\u2019s -- ev --\neverything is in place. American flag on the fender, and ambassador flag, and -- and a lot of\nwhoop-de-doo. And I arrived, and was quite a shocking experience because there were two\ngroups standing at General Patton\u2019s grave, and then 5,000 white marble crosses and Stars of\nDavid behind them. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a memorable scene every time. You don\u2019t visit that cemetery\nwithout getting a lump in your throat. Every one of these people buried there died during the\nBattle of the Bulge, at the military cemetery in Luxembourg. And then General Patton\u2019s grave is\nright at the front of it. I arrived there, and here were the -- the Americans on one group and -- and\nthe Amicale de Buchenwald, Luxembourgers 1n the other group, just looking at each other.\nNobody knew what to do, or what to say, because you know, you could -- the atmosphere was so\nheavy you could -- you c -- cut it. And I thought, oh what have I wrought here, you know, I\u2019ve\nbrought these people together, how am I going to break this -- break the ice here. And just as I\nwalked up -- and I knew the Luxembourgers of course, and -- and just as I walked up I heard one\nof the Luxembourg women say to one of the Americans, \u201cI think I remember you, isn\u2019t your\nname Buddy?\u201d And it was, and these two got together and hugged each other, and -- and that\nbroke the ice, I didn\u2019t have to do anything. Th-They s-started mingling then an-and introducing\nthemselves to each other, and -- and that was just a -- a moving experience. The leader of the\nAmicale de Buchenwald, or the president of it was the mayor -- at that time the mayor of a little\ntown called Beaufort where there is a very historic and romantic castle ruin in Luxembourg.\nThere are quite a few castles in Luxembourg, 74 of them to be exact, and Beaufort is one of the -\n- the most romantic because the ruin is fairly well preserved and you can tour it and imagine you\ncan still see the dungeon and -- and the torture chamber and everything else. So it\u2019s a big tourist\nattraction, and the mayor, of course, 1s responsible for the community and the chateau which\nbelongs to the community. He invited the entire sixth armored division bunch to come to\nBeaufort as his guests and sure the -- the buses loaded up and they spent the rest of the day --\nthey changed their whole itinerary. They spent the rest of the day at this site and having their\ndinner in Beaufort, and mingling with the people and -- and they were just a very warm\nexperience. And to this day, and every time we\u2019ve gone back now since our embassy days, we\nalways go to Beaufort, look up the mayor and -- and reminisce about the days. They published a\nbook about Buchenwald and it tells the whole story of the liberation and -- and the inmates and\nwhat -- what it was like, the condition. And it ends with pictures of this reunion group at the 40\"\nanniversary. It\u2019s -- a-and this might well be a book that ought to be in -- in the museum library,\ntoo, I -- I'll -- Pll see to that, yeah. But I learned more about Buchenwald from those people,\nassociating with them than I did Dachau because as I say, 1-1t\u2019s a real emotional challenge, more\nthan I could cope with. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not -- you have to really have a strong stomach. People who\ndon\u2019t believe the Holocaust ever happened ought to make a visit. Not now, should have been\nthere, see the real thing. The -- they\u2019d find out it happened, yeah.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go to a -- a more -- a happier story --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- although it\u2019s still involved in this time period, where you got to save the Lipizzaner horses.\nLet\u2019s talk about that.",
        "A: Well, yeah I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think -- well, maybe -- maybe I\u2019m -- I\u2019m the savior of the --\nthe mares anyway, not the stallion. There are two stories about the Lipizzaner horses and they\nalways get mixed up. Walt Disney got them all -- got it all mixed up in his, \u201cMiracle of the\nWhite Stallion.\u201d But I\u2019m in that movie.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, but now identified -- the role in -- in that movie actually did happen that way and -- and I\nwas involved in it. I had arrived there with my driver on a search for -- actually I was looking for\nHeisenberg, you know, Heisenberg the physicist Nobel prize winner. And our Manhattan project\npeople were convinced that Germany was working on an atom bomb. And they wanted to know\nwhat Friedisch and Weisecker, and what Heisenberg had done and how far they had gotten. And\nthe truth of it all is that the Germans really were not working on an atomic bomb. They weren\u2019t,\nbut we didn\u2019t know that, so we were looking for people who knew something about Heisenberg,\nand von Weisecker and atomic research and if nothing else it gave me an excuse to go hither and\nyon, and go everywhere. So anyhow, that\u2019s who I was supposedly looking for and it -- and I\nmanaged to be where the 16\" armored division was, near Hofe and [indecipherable] Germany,\nright near the Czech border. I was the only one at -- and there was a s -- a second armored\ncavalry regiment which was heading in that particular sector. And the colonel who was in -- in\ncharge of that particular battalion couldn\u2019t speak German. But one evening I was playing cards\nwith somebody and they need an interpreter and the colonel sent for me and I went over to\ninterpret for him, the reason being that a German captain had voluntarily surrendered and was\nbrought before the colonel to be interrogated and he -- the colonel couldn\u2019t talk to him because\nhe couldn\u2019t speak German, so I was called in to be the interpreter and Disney does have that\nscene in the movie. The colonel is actually eating his dinner and when the prisoner is brought in\nand I do the interrogating. In the movie the prisoner tells the colonel about a horse farm, but that\ndidn\u2019t -- that -- that wasn\u2019t the case at all. He was telling the colonel about dienst stella ost,\nservice station east, translation. Which is a military intelligence unit, German military\nintelligence unit, very much like ours, detailed interrogation. This was a German intelligence unit\ngathering information about the Soviet Union. And they were in a hunting lodge in the Bohemian\nforest, just halfway between the border and Pilgrin, and they were interrogating German -- I\nmean, Russian PW, who had information of a strategic nature, like we were doing on our side.\nThis unit had been in existence for five years and they had maps of every airport in the Soviet\nUnion, of every bridge, of every installation, every weapon, anything you wanted to know about\nthe Soviet army, they had it. The Soviets were about five miles to the east of them, the\nAmericans about five miles to the west of them, they were in the middle. Now what should they\ndo? Do nothing, Soviets might get there first. If they find out what the Germans had been doing\nthere, it\u2019d be their heads. They could just destroy everything they had and take to the woods, but\nthat wouldn\u2019t be German. They\u2019re not going to destroy anything they\u2019ve been gathering for five\nyears. So their third option was to surrender to the Americans before the Soviets would get there.\nSo this captain voluntarily came to our unit and surrendered and told my colonel all about his\ndienst stella ost. They wanted to surrender to us and turn over to us all of the documentation and\nall of the interrogation reports, maps and everything they had about the Soviet Union. So they\nneeded a German speaking officer and I was the only one there, so the colonel said, you know,\n\u201cDoli, your -- you go in, we\u2019ll arrange this.\u201d So we had a two and a half ton truck and driver and\nenlisted man guard and then the sergeant and I in the Jeep -- and sergeant [indecipherable] the\ntruck and I in my Jeep with my driver and we drove into this hunting lodge. It was an air force\ncolonel -- Luftwaffe colonel, a lieutenant colonel, actually, who was the commander of this unit,\nHolters was his name and he made a big show, a very formal first wor -- World War I general\nstaff officer, with a surrender s -- the whole thing. We loaded all the stuff on the trucks and there\nwere just a few officers and enlisted men and they got on the truck with the documents and the\ncolonel got in the Jeep with me and then we drove back to our place. The whole thing didn\u2019t take\nmore than about 20 minutes. But on the way Colonel Holters told me -- asked me if I knew\nanything about horses. And I didn\u2019t know a thing about horses. Well, particularly he wanted to\nknow if I knew anything about the Lipizzaner horses. And I didn\u2019t know anything about them\neither. So he proceeded to tell me about Spanish riding school, and the history of the Lipizzaner,\nvery fascinating. And then I found out the purpose of it all was to tell me that there was a -- a gut\n-- stut -- stud -- stud farm under the German department of agriculture, which had been brought\nto this place -- I forget the name of the owner of the estate now, Arco whatever it was, located\njust in Czechoslovakia, sort of a equivalent to a bluegrass region, which particularly fertile grass\nand particularly good region to breed horses. And the German Department of Agriculture had\nbrought these mares and some stallions and other horses of a different breed, Caucasians and\nsome were from the Russian steppes. About 200 horses, but primarily Lipizzaners for breeding\npurposes to this stud farm. And they were just about two miles south of where w -- two\nkilometers south of where we were. And he told me all about this, so when he explained the\nSpanish riding school to me, I -- I just felt well, we ought to get involved here. So we took a\ndetour. I sent a sergeant and a truck with the other prisoners, and documents and everything on,\nand we took a little detour and this how we came upon this stud farm. And th-the -- they -- there\nwere all the lipi -- my first look at Lipizzaner horses, a beautiful sight. This 1s in May, and the\nmeadow was in bloom and everything else is just beautiful. And I had learned enough about the\nhorses to really appreciate this. There were some young horses who were frolicking in -- 1n the\nmeadow and doing things that is officially described as airs above the ground, which are the\nthings that we train the stallions to do -- I mean we -- they trained the stallions to do at the\nSpanish riding school and wherever they have Lipizzaner horses, there are two farms here in the\nUnited States where they train lipid -- breed and train Lipizzaners. Anyhow, these foals -- th-\nthese horses we-were -- were doing these things naturally. The trick is to teach them to do it on\ncommand. And that was the beauty of this development that I saw. Anyhow, the point was that I\nhad the opportunity to -- to meet Colonel Potisky, who was the leader of the Spanish riding\nschool, who happened to be there at that particular time. Well, to make a long story short, from\nthe stud farm, once I saw it, I took some pictures and I went on back then, reported to Colonel\nReed what I had seen. He had a brother who -- who had performed an e -- an eques -- equestrian\nof the Olympics. And he went riding a horse that was named Potisky in honor of Colonel Potisky\nof the Spanish riding school. So he knew all about them. And I said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a stud farm.\u201d\nHere we are and -- so he took over. And we had German PW and a lot of Polish DPs who were\nin the area, who then helped some of our American forces move the horses back into Germany\nbecause the fear was that the ri -- Soviets would get there first, and they would eat them, because\nthe rumor, and it\u2019s -- I guess it was true, too, there was a Spanish riding school in Budapest, and\nthe Soviets tried to get those horses to use them to pull wagons and the Lipizzaners wouldn\u2019t\nrespond, so they ji -- but-butchered them. And so they were afraid this what would happen to the\nLipizzaner. Plus the fact that the Polish DPs didn\u2019t like the Germans, and they would take care of\nthe Lipizzaners also if they got a chance. So we rescued them, we -- we brought them. Some of\nthe stallions were there, but mostly they were the -- the mares and the foals and some of the other\nhorses. And we moved them across into a sector of -- of Germany, Schwartzburg, which is in the\ncommand of the second armored cavalry regiment. That\u2019s the story that I was involved in.\nMeanwhile, at about the same time, General Walker of the 20\" corps came into Austria to St.\nMartin in -- in Crise, and came to an estate there which they set up as their headquarters, where\nthe stallions of the Spanish riding school from Vienna had been brought by Colonel Potisky. And\ncolonel -- General Walker was quite impressed and knowing that Patton was a horse lover and\ncavalryman, notified Patton, who was at that time I think in -- in Frankfort. And Patton and the\ndeputy secretary of war, who was visiting the front at that time, got into Patton\u2019s plane and they\nflew to Saint Martin\u2019s and the stallions from the Spanish riding school put on a show for Patton -",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: -- with the result that Patton put the Lipizzaners under the protection of the United States\narmy, all Lipizzaners, which included the ones from the stud farm, who were included in that\ngeneral order. Nobody could touch the Lipizzaner horses who were under the protection of the\nUnited States army, because Patton was quite impressed with them. And it turned out that he had\nwid -- ridden in the Olympics in 1912 against Colonel Potisky. And the most famous quote to\nme, a Patton quote is -- I don\u2019t have the exact quote, but he was quite peevishly concerned that\nwhy the Austrians used 57 healthy, well-trained men to teach horses how to dance, when they\nshould be at the front fighting. I mean, that was the gist of it. Imagine these guys teaching horses\nto dance instead of fighting for their country. But nevertheless he -- he did protect the horses, and\n-- so Patton really is the liberator of the Lipizzaners. And that\u2019s the Disney story. Now Disney\nhad the whole thing --",
        "Q: Together.",
        "A: -- brought together, you know, and there was fighting and -- and that -- there was resistance,\nand -- but not really, 1t was a very peaceful operation, but a great adventure. And the sequel was\nthat my pattern of circles again, is that 50 years later, my wife and I were in Vienna, were going\nto Vienna and wanted to go to the Spanish riding school, to see a performance there. And we had\nour youngest son Brian with us. And we couldn\u2019t get any tickets. It was the opening\nperformance, September 12\" and they were all sold out. Nobody could get me any tickets. And\nconsequently, I had a photograph and I brought some of the photographs with me of Colonel\nPotisky and myself shaking hands, with a Lipizzaner standing next to us. So I -- very brash, I\nwrote a letter to Colonel Potisky, commandant of the Spanish riding school in Vienna, Austria\nand I included that picture. And told him, you know, this is me, and [indecipherable] the incident\nof our -- our -- our visit and said that I was trying to get tickets for the opening performance and\nif he could possibly help me I would appreciate it, etcetera. I didn\u2019t hear from him until about a\nweek before we left for Europe on our vacation trip. I got a letter from the Spanish riding school,\nnot from Colonel Potisky, saying that he had retired, he\u2019s on a trip around the world, my letter\nhad caught up with him in Paris. And they had tickets for the three of us to come to the Spanish\nriding school performance, and I should pick them up in the -- before 11 o\u2019clock on the\nperformance on that day. And sure enough, we stayed at the Sarka hotel, and that morning I went\nto -- I had this -- the whole [indecipherable] where the school performs, there\u2019s a big line of\npeople standing in line to buy tickets for standing room only because they\u2019re sold out. But you\ncould buy tickets on the day of the performance to stand. Well, only -- only time in my life I\u2019ve\never crashed a line. I went to the front, got a lot of dirty looks, but I presented the letter from\ncolonel -- from that Spanish riding school and sure enough they had tickets for me. Had to pay\nfor them, they weren\u2019t free. I paid for the tickets, went back hotel, got Winnie and our -- our son,\nand then at 11 o\u2019clock we went back for the performance. And as we came in there to present our\ntickets, the usher looked at the tickets and held up his hand and motioned to somebody who took\nus in a direction different from where everybody else was going. And I thought there\u2019s a mistake\nmade, and we -- our tickets aren\u2019t any good. But instead they took us to the royal box, and we\nhad the perf -- we sat in there, in the royal box of the Spanish riding school. That was a big, big\nthrill.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And when the horses came in in the opening, they all come in single file, 16 of them, and they\ncome right toward the royal box, and they -- simultaneously the riders tip their hats. And\neverybody thought we must be somebody very important. That was a thrilling moment.",
        "Q: I bet it was.",
        "A: And that was -- and that\u2019s 50 years after this particular incident, so it had a special meaning.\nThat -- that\u2019s the Lipizzaner story.",
        "Q: Okay. Your next assignment, I gather, is to go to the Palace Hotel in Mondorf, yes?",
        "A: The war is over, in fact the war ended, unbeknownst to me at the time, this unit of the dienst\nstella ost, Colonel Holters and two of his officers -- we decided to send them to Augsburg, and\nthen from Augsburg to our special service sta -- our own detailed interrogation center, our own\nservice station in the Ardenst, in Revan. And meanwhile my driver and I headed back to Revan,\nand I continued on that particular project for about a week or so in Revan, of Colonel Holters and\n-- and his staff. And 1t was a wonderful time because we got back the day the war ended, got\nback into Revan. And the next day we had a victory parade, full dress uniform, just my unit,\n6824DIC, we had a drummer who played the drum, no -- no band, orchestra, and an American\nflag, and we got all dressed up, officers and enlisted men, and we had a parade right through\nRevan, and th-the French people cheering us on, viva |\u2019Amerique. And it was a great -- a great\nvictory. And the next week or two I had a wonderful time going down to Rans for the opera, and\ninterrogating -- finishing the job of Colonel Holters. Then we ran into trouble cause our war\ndepartment wasn\u2019t interested in having that information about Soviet Union, cause that was our -\n- they were our allies. And so there was a resistance. And then the fact my commanding officer\nwas -- supposedly I heard, reprimanded for either -- either -- for even gathering this information.\nBut you probably know the name Bob Lovitt, and Bob Lovitt was a deputy secretary of state, I\nbelieve at the time. And he used his influence and eventually Colonel Holters, the two officers,\nand all the documents we -- we captured in the Bohemian forest were brought to this secret\nlocation here in Washington. And that\u2019s the end of that relationship, that\u2019s all I knew about. My\ncommanding officer called me in and said I had a new assignment, and our detailed interrogation\ncenter was going to be dissolved and I was going to go to a place that he had never heard of\nbefore, and that\u2019s Mondorf, Luxembourg. Meanwhile, I had made one trip to Luxembourg on a\nspecial assignment to go back and see if I could locate any of my family. So this transfer to\nLuxembourg came as a real surprise. In fact, I had -- I had no idea there were even Americans\nstationed in Luxembourg. I assumed, of course, but I hadn\u2019t pursued that. So that was a real\nassignment, to get back into Luxembourg. And that assignment was to the central prisoner of war\nenclosure number 32, which was also coded in our orders as Ashcan. That was the code word\nthat they used, send us to the place. And that\u2019s all I knew about it. I had no idea what the place\nwas, what it was used for or what I\u2019d be doing. All I know is I was transferred. The good news\nwas that my best friend and colleague, Malcolm Hilkey, with whom I had been at -- at-at -- in\nVienna, and -- and in Paris, and also at Revan, was going to the same place. And my\ncommanding officer would be Captain Sensnik, whom I had met at Camp Richie, Maryland. So I\nwould be with old friends and -- and ready for whatever they had in store for me. So I arrived in\nLuxembourg, my second visit, this time on official assignment. There was a lot of talk when the\nwar ended that we were now going to go to the far east in military intelligence, and I anticipated\nthat that\u2019s probably what would happen to me. But instead I was sent to Luxembourg, which to\nme was a miracle, and which shouldn\u2019t have happened that way, but I didn\u2019t question it. So I\narrived in Mondorf. I knew Mondorf because I had gone there with my brother Heinrich who 1s\nmarried, when I was still in Luxembourg as a boy. And he and his wife had taken me to Mondorf\non occasion. There was a little train called the Jongelly that went from Luxembourg city to\nMondorf, for people who went there, this resort, Mondorf was a -- a spa, mineral water and\nhealth resort health spa. And I knew the place that I was assigned to, that was the palace hotel.\nFour story hotel casino, with gambling tables and the works. And guest rooms, and all of the\nfacilities for casino for -- for a health resort. So I reported there and then I found it -- it had\nchanged quite a lot from what I remember as a boy. A fence around it, Klieg lights overheard,\ncamouflage material, and [indecipherable] hanging, you know, you couldn\u2019t see what was going\non inside. There were machine gun towers on each of the four corners of this fenced in area. And\nthere was a roving guard, a Jeep, military police riding around, I think, constantly. And all I\nknew is I been transferred to CCPW number 32, I didn\u2019t know what was -- what was going on\ninside there. So I asked the sergeant of the guard in the Jeep, say what\u2019s going on here? And hi --\nhis answer is very typical of sergeant of the guard, he said, th-the -- \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been\nhere three weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been inside. All I know is to get in here you have to have\na pass signed by God, and somebody has to verify the signature.\u201d So that aroused my curiosity,\nbut I had the right papers, and they let me in, they -- I was expected. There was a\nnoncommissioned officer in the lobby of the hotel when I walked in, and he read my orders, and\nsigned me to my room. He said, \u201cThis is where you\u2019re going to live, and that\u2019s also where you\u2019re\ngoing to work.\u201d And I asked him, \u201cWhat kind of a place is this?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s an\ninterrogation center, it\u2019s a wa -- interrogating prisoners of war.\u201d So I assumed this is continuation\nof what we\u2019ve been doing at the -- at Revan, at DIC. So as I was in -- in the process of unpacking\nmy belongings in my room, which was rather sparsely furnished, but comfortable. And I heard a\nknock on the door, and I thought this is one of other officers coming in to introduce himself. So I\nopened the door, and before me stood none other than Herman Goering, the Reichsmarshall of\nthe Third Reich. So I was the most surprised person in the world, and stood there with my mouth\nopen. He clicked his heels and says, \u201cGoering, Reichsmarshall.\u201d So I asked him to step inside.\nHe was carrying a pair of trousers and he said, \u201cThis an extra pair of trousers.\u201d I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand this, but he, in a smirking fashion -- he had a way of delivering his lines with a smirk\non his face. He said, \u201cWell, I wanted to be a model prisoner, and several days ago we were\ndeclassified. We are now ordinary prisoners of war. And we only permitted a certain amount of\nclothing. And I overlooked this particular pair of trousers. I didn\u2019t want to get in trouble, so I\nwant to turn them in to you.\u201d Well, I -- I wasn\u2019t quite in tune with what he was leading up to, and\nthen 1t suddenly dawned on me that he needed an excuse to come and see me and I think he was\nsacrificing an extra pair of trousers for an excuse. I didn\u2019t know anything about the operation yet,\nbut it ma -- was made clear to me later on. What he wanted to know is he wanted to know who I\nwas. He fancied himself the -- the leader of the group that was imprisoned. And I didn\u2019t know\nwho they were, but I knew now that one of them was Goering. So it was his business to find out\nwho the newcomers, who the arrivals were. And he had seen me coming in through the gate, so\nhe followed procedure and came to see me, using the trousers as an excuse. And then he asked\nme, \u201cWhat is your particular assignment here? You\u2019re a young man, what are you doing here?\u201d I\nwas 26 at the time. And before I could answer him, he said, \u201cAre you by any chance the welfare\nofficer, who would see to it that we all get treated properly, in accordance with the rules of\nGeneva convention?\u201d So I was just going to say no, I\u2019m an interrogation officer, but when he\nsuggested I might be the welfare officer, I said, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m going to see to it that you get\ntreated properly,\u201d and he was satisfied. So he then started a list of complaints. And he was\nunhappy with the way he was brought here, that he was --",
        "Q: Wa -- wa -- can we wait just one moment? Is that [indecipherable]. Okay, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Well he had -- he had decided then -- well, I had decided, rather, that I would see to it that\nthey would all get a square deal. And he lodged his cam -- ki -- campaign of complaints about he\nwas supposed to go to -- go into exile. He had brought with him 11 suitcases, with all of his\nuniforms and decorations and his Reichsmarshall baton, all his belongings. And he, after all, was\nthe head of the German state, successor to Hitler and he was going to go to -- into exile like\nNapoleon or any head of state. Instead they brought him to this very meager hotel, with a folding\narmy cot, straw mattress, and he was very unhappy with that whole arrangement. And I said well\nI knew nothing about that. And that ended our conversation, he clicked his heels and bowed and\nleft. That evening at five o\u2019clock, I was to report to my commanding officer, to Captain Sensnik.\nAnd I was a first lieutenant at that time. And I reported to Captain Sensnik and I told him that I\nhad a visitor. I told him of this particular visit from Goering. And Captain Sensnik, \u201cThat\u2019s\ngreat,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s your cover.\u201d He said, \u201cEvery one of us needs a cover, and by the way, use\na different name, don\u2019t use your name. You still have relatives in Europe, brothers and sisters,\nand we don\u2019t know what\u2019s ahead, but most of us are using different names, so pick a name.\u201d\nWell, I picked a n -- a name of a -- a good Luxembourg name, Gellen. Said, \u201cOkay, Pll be John\nGellen.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s your name from now on. All your orders, everything you get will\nbe in the name of John Gellen. And you pretend to be the welfare officer. You visit all the\nprisoners, listen to what they have to say, keep a file of what you hear, and we\u2019ll coordinate that\nwith our interrogation reports. So yi -- ni -- that\u2019s your job from now on, that\u2019s your cover.\u201d\nThen he explained to me that all the prisoners were on the third and fourth floor, some two in a\nroom, some single rooms. The second floor was a buffer zone, nothing was happening on that\nfloor. The first floor, where we were -- we were billeted in our sleeping rooms and also our\nworking offices, but we were trying to find private billets outside of the compound so we could\ngo home at night after work, so we wouldn\u2019t be in the same building with the prisoners. The\nground floor was a dining room, where the prisoners would eat, a lounge where they could read,\nunder supervision. If they wore glasses, their glasses were kept on the rack in the lounge, they\nweren\u2019t allowed to take their glasses upstairs. Danger of suicide. They might break their glasses\nand cut their wrists, as some of them had tried to do. There was a veranda around the front of the\nhotel where they could sit and sunbathe. They could actually walk in the garden, a nice little\ngarden. But they had to stay within a barb wire enclosure and there\u2019s an electric -- electric wire. I\nhad a picture of that, by the way, of the electric wire, with a German sign warning high voltage\nso they wouldn\u2019t beyond that. And of course there was a machine gun tower. Now I have my\nown theory of why we had this heavy guard around the place. None of these people is going to s\n-- going to escape. W-We didn\u2019t have to worry about that. We had to worry about the people on\nthe outside who might want to get at them. So they were more defense, and guard were more to\nprotect them from the outside and keep them alive and in good shape for the trials, than\notherwise. Each room was equipped with a folding army cot, straw mattress, two or three GI\nblankets, a four legged stool and a bucket of water, and a cake of Lifebuoy soap. The --",
        "Q: Lifebuoy?",
        "A: Lifebuoy, the original Lifebuoy. The kind your mother put in your mouth when you used a\ndirty word. That was the offi -- the official issue, a deodorant soap. There were no doorknobs on\nthe doors because they could use the screws to -- use the sc -- the sharp end of a screw if they\nwanted to hurt themselves. The flush toilet were the kind with the tank above and the chain, that\nwas removed. The chain was removed cause they might use the chain. They were not pu --\npermitted to wear belts, neckties, shoestrings -- which was a real problem. How to keep them in\ntheir shoes if they wore hightops without shoestrings. We had to get special permission and they\nwere allowed four inch shoestrings so they could at least tie the top two holes together. It\u2019s kind\nof humorous and they made much of that when they exercised a little -- a little sense of humor.\nThey had absolute freedom to move within the hotel. This is how Goering came to my room. He\ncould see who was going where and follow and knock on the door. This was by design. This --\nthis helped to stimulate communication. It allowed them to visit each other, they could go to each\nother\u2019s rooms and get involved in discussions and arguments, and get mad at each other and we\nbenefited from that. That was part of our technique of gathering information. What did one\nprisoner say about the other prisoner, especially if he was mad at him. This --",
        "Q: Did -- did you walk around a lot so you could watch what the socialization was, and --",
        "A: Yes -- we --",
        "Q: -- and see how they were interacting?",
        "A: -- We -- we -- we -- we took advantage of their mutual -- of their -- the way they\ncommunicated with I -- who spoke to whom, and who snubbed whom, because we would then\nplay that guy off with a -- against the other one and -- and get information out of him.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was very effective. We -- we did -- we didn\u2019t use any what we now consider modern\ninterrogation [indecipherable] like recordings. There were no secret tapes, definitely no torture\ndevises, I mean we didn\u2019t -- thumbscrews or any kind of torture device. We didn\u2019t need it. They\nwere all willing to talk, a-and they\u2019re quite willing to talk.",
        "Q: Why do you think that was so, that they were so willing to talk?",
        "A: First of all, the more they were interrogated, the more important they were, because if -- if\nyou had a lot of interrogations, in the eyes of the other prisoners, the enemy considered you a\ndecision maker, you were obviously one of the top men. If you were not interrogated at all,\nwhich was true of some of the people, I don\u2019t know why we had them, I mean, they shouldn\u2019t\nhave been there. Nobody knew who they were. But they had a uniform on and they happened to\nbe at the wrong place at the right time and were taken prisoner, cause they had a title, or they\nwere with somebody, if they were in the presence of Goering. Like his -- his adjutant, or his aid.\nThey were all taken prisoner, unfortunately because they happened to be Goering\u2019s aid, but they\nhad no intelligence value, and they were not permitted to continue to be his aid. They just\nbecame ordinary prisoners of war. So we -- we had prisoners who -- who -- who just -- we didn\u2019t\nknow why they were there, and they didn\u2019t know why they were there, and they wanted to be\ninterrogated so they could -- they could at least feel that they were important. That was one\nthing. The other thing was none of these prisoners presented themselves as a unit, a -- a -- none\nof them worked as part of a team, a united effort to protect each other. They were all protecting\nonly themselves. Not a single one ever thought in terms of protecting the German general\u2019s staff,\nor protecting the -- the Nazi element, or the bureaucracy, the bureaucrats whom we had. And\nthose were the three categories that automatically they divided themselves into. The general\u2019s\nstaff pretty much stuck together socially in the prison, in their -- their discussion groups and their\ncliques. Excuse me. When they sat on the veranda or in the lounge, or when they ate together,\nthey pretty much stuck together, and the Nazis pretty much stuck together. And the same thing\nwith the statesmen or the ministers and some of those. So each one was out to save his own neck.\nAnd they had grievances that went back to Hitler\u2019s time, back to 1934 - \u201935. If Goering snubbed\nthis particular general, this general now had an opportunity to spill the beans about Goering.\nPetty stuff, but this 1s exactly what we wanted -- w-we wanted to hear. So the socializing with\neach other and visiting with each other was all part of a interrogation scheme. We had a conflict\nof our own, cause on one hand, there were five of us, five interrogators. And we belonged to the\nRichie crowd, we were the trained military intelligence personnel. We had nothing to do with the\noperation of the prison, of how the prisoners were fed, or how they were housed or anything else.\nThat was under the command of the -- of Colonel Andrews, Burton C. Andrews, of the 391\"\nanti-tank battalion -- were his personnel. Andrews actually was brought into this job in charge of\nthis detention center from a -- a prisoner of war -- not a prisoner of war enclosure, but a regular\nprison -- what do you call it? A prison camp. For military prison camp, American prisoners. He\nwas in charge of -- of a prison camp. So he was a trained military warden, and he was in charge\nof this prison. We had f -- about 40 or so ordinary German soldiers who were ordinary prisoners\nof war. They were the cadre, the work cadre. They we -- they did the manual labor. The prisoners\ndidn\u2019t do their own cooking or serving of the food or cleaning up, except their rooms, they had to\nclean their own rooms. But they didn\u2019t run the sweepers, or -- or do the dusting or anything in\nthe public rooms. So we had German soldiers who were carpenters, electricians, cooks, bakers,\neven the chaplain, a doctor. Most anything we needed to run a prison. But these were ordinary\nGerman prisoners who were now in a position to be associated with the -- what they called the\nbunsin, the big animals who had run the -- the dictatorship under Hitler\u2019s regime. Was quite a --\nthat interplay was very interesting to watch. Well then we had the prison guards, the Americans,\nwho supervised all of this, who directed the German PW, who were the work cadre. And they\nwere responsible for the security and -- and everything else. Now Colonel Andrews came from a\nregular detention center, from a prison. We had difficulty convincing him that these were not\npeople who were being punished. They were people who were being interrogated in preparation\nfor a trial. And that we needed them in pretty good physical condition and good mental condition\nin order to get their cooperation while we interrogated them. But he looked upon them as\ncriminals. And he was the -- the prison warden. So if they didn\u2019t exactly behave as he thought\nthey should, like if they didn\u2019t have their room very clean, then he would put them in solitary\nconfinement. They\u2019d stay in a basement for 24 hours, or maybe two days if their shoes weren\u2019t\nshined properly. And we\u2019d say that doesn\u2019t help our interrogation, because if they get mad and\nresentful, then they won\u2019t cooperate with us. So we had that interplay, so -- and we finally had to\ngo pretty high up, as high as Wild Bill Donovan, the commanding general of the -- what was\nthen the OSS, who was our mentor. He is the one who coached us on how to get information out\nof the prisoners, he was a -- an expert in that kind of thing. And Donovan then had to use his\ngeneral rank to get Colonel Andrews to cooperate with the idea that this was a -- a processing\ncenter, not a center for punishment.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to have to stop the tape now --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- because we\u2019re running out.\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: We -- when we completed the last tape, you were talking about the problem with Colonel\nAndrews --",
        "A: Andrews, yeah.",
        "Q: -- and his view of the prisoners versus -- or were these prisoners, were these criminals, who\nwere these people?",
        "A: Well, he treat -- as far as he was concerned, they were prisoners of war. And one of my jobs --\nAndrews took a personal liking to me, primarily because I knew my way around Luxembourg.\nSo whenever we had a VIP visitor like General Eisenhower, or -- or any one of the higher\nofficials who came to visit, I would be ap -- appointed tour guide. So that became one of my\nfunctions. In addition to what I had to do, I would take them around Luxembourg and show them\nplaces. Well, Andrews enjoyed that part of it himself because he would always go along and --\nand I\u2019d on a couple of occasions invited Prince Felix, who liked American bourbon. And\nbourbon was just not available anywhere, except as we got it in our liquor ration in Mondorf. So\nevery once in awhile, on Saturday nights, the few of us officers would get together and have a\nlittle party, and we invited Prince Felix to a couple of these affairs, which impressed Colonel\nAndrews very much. So we finally got around to the point of where he saw our viewpoint in\naddition to the official persuasion he got from above. You know, we can\u2019t treat these people like\nconvicted criminals serving their sentences. We have to try them first, and before we can try\nthem, we had to interrogate them, and -- and that public relations effort helped considerably. It\nalso resulted in my being at Nuremberg when I had done everything possible to avoid going to\nNuremberg, cause I was tired of the whole thing. But once I arrived there on temporary duty,\nAndrews snagged me and he wouldn\u2019t let me go because he wanted me back on his staff again.\nSo it had its -- its pluses and minuses. But he used me also to translate his messages to the -- the\nprisoners whenever -- for instance, when Streicher arrived, Doenitz refused on behalf of the other\nprisoners, to eat in the same dining room with Streicher. Well then Andrews wrote a message to\nbe delivered to them, and I -- of course I translated that and read the message to the prisoners and\n-- which we told them it -- you have no choice. I mean, he\u2019s your boy and you\u2019re going to eat\nwith him whether you like it or not, cause you\u2019re all alike. We\u2019re not looking at you as a grand\nadmiral, or you as a Reichsmarshall. We\u2019re looking at you as a declassified prisoner of war, and\nthat\u2019s what Streicher is, and you\u2019re going to eat in the same dining room, and that was it. That --\nthat\u2019s the kind of message that Andrews enjoyed delivering and -- and always -- he had a riding\ncrop that he carried all the time. High polished boots, polished helmet, he was sort of a spittin\u2019\nimage of General Patton when it came to dress and bearing and he loved to play the commanding\nofficer, which sometimes the Nazis u-used against all of us in a humorous sense. For instance,\none general, I forget what his name was, had not -- Andrews came walking into the room and --\nand the general didn\u2019t stand up and click his heels, so he was punished and he was put in the\nbasement room which Andrews kept for solitary confinement. And then he wrote an order that\nwhenever he walked into a room they were to stand up at attention and -- and salute him. Well,\nthey carried it to the other extreme so whenever any one of us entered the room they did the\nsame thing. And it got to be sort of humorous, here I was a first lieutenant and if they were all\nsitting on the vera -- veranda in the afternoon, about 30 or 40 of these guys, and I would come\nback from lunch and walk it up -- they would all stand up and click their heels and bow, and say\ngood afternoon Herr [indecipherable] you know. And it got to be a joke until they got tired of it,\nbut we had a -- light moments with them too. But we did convince Andrews finally to let us do\nour -- our thing, as long as the prisoners didn\u2019t violate any of the rules he\u2019d go along with it, but\nthat was one of the challenges. Other than that, our interrogation technique, as I said, was one of\n-- in my particular case I was the welfare -- I pretended to be the welfare officer. Well, I was the\nwelfare officer because I made the rounds. I would go from room to room and I would ask the\nprisoner how -- how are you today, and at first they were very busy writing letters to General\nEisenhower, to President Truman, to -- you know, they were heads of state, or former heads of\nstate. And they were complaining about their treatment and making demands. And our job was to\ntranslate those letters, send them -- send them out through channels. And we never got any\nreplies, I assume they\u2019re still going through channels. But -- so if they had a letter that they\nwanted to write to someone, they would give it to me to translate for them, and send it on. Or if\nthey wanted to locate their family. You know, I -- I don\u2019t know where my wife is, could you try\nto find out where she is? And we would, which is very simple thing because for instance, a lot of\nthem lived -- th-the Nazi -- I always refer to them as the bunsin, the big -- the big boys -- a lot of\nthe Nazi leaders, they had a tendency to cluster. Ma-Many of them had their villas at Tegernsee\nin Bavaria. So if Kesserling wanted to locate his wife the last time he heard from her, we could\ncontact a military unit of ours stationed near Tegernsee and ask them to investigate. And we got\nto the point where we could sometimes forward letters. And that helped tremendously in getting\ntheir cooperation and telling me things that -- that we wanted to hear. So I would make the\nrounds and -- and somebody would say, I don\u2019t have any toothpaste, could you get me a -- an\nextra ration of toothpaste, shampoo, or I have a dandruff problem. Goering had a skin problem\nand he always -- he wanted special lotions and special soaps, which we couldn\u2019t furnish, but at\nleast I listened to his complaints and -- and by listening and sympathizing with him, that -- that\nhelped pave the way. What happened then was that every one of us had a specialty. I really\nspecialized in the German general\u2019s staff. The history of the German general\u2019s staff, and so forth.\nSo a lot of my interrogations were of the high ranking generals, based on military strategies and\norganization and so forth. With the result that each one of the five of us would have only a\ncertain number of prisoners under their jurisdiction and they wouldn\u2019t get to know anything\nabout any of the others. Well, I was the welfare officer, so I got to meet a lot of them, even\nthough I never interrogated them. But I would g-go in and chat with them, ho-how are you doing,\nhow do you feel? And I would end up getting a lot of information that helped my performance,\nbecause I kept this gossip file about one s -- prisoner said about the other. But one in particular\nstands out, was old Papa Schwartz, Franz Xavier Schwartz, was called Papa Schwartz. He was\nthe Nazi party treasurer. Simple, kind old guy, really. He didn\u2019t know what the score was. But he\nwas a very popular politician in Bavaria and Hitler used him to collect the dues. If you belong to\nthe Nazi party, you paid yo-your party dues. And that\u2019s all Schwartz did, he collected dues. And\nnow you think Nazi party treasurer would have been a very important guy, who certainly would\nhave a lot to do with buying property and -- and receiving big contributions. That wasn\u2019t\nSchwartz\u2019s job, that was somebody else\u2019s responsibility. That was Funk, and to a certain extent\nat first, Schacht. So Schwartz, I don\u2019t even know why we -- we brou -- he was never\ninterrogated. He really served no particular purpose. And his son, Franz Xavier Schwartz, jr. was\nthe president of German breweries, which really had no particular connection, but he did have a -\n- a paramilitary rank in th -- either the SS or the SA. A lot of people, if you made a big\ncontribution financially, if you were an industrialist, you would got a -- get a rank like a\nsturmbondfuhrer in the SS, which was nothing more than an honorary title, and 1 -- and you\ncould -- got to wear a uniform. So if you were president of the breweries, you could wear a\nuniform as a brigadier general in the SS, but you really had nothing to do in the SS. But it did put\nhim in the automatic arrest category, because everybody who was an SS officer was\nautomatically arrested by us. So we ended up with a lot of these deadbeats. Well, Schwartz\nlooked very much like my father, physical image. My father had sort of a white mustache, little\n[indecipherable] like Hindenburg. And Schwartz looked like my father and the first time I went\nin to see Schwartz, I was taken aback because it looked almost like my own papa sitting there.\nAnd he noticed that and wanted to know what -- you know, what made you -- he said --\nupshraken was the German word, la -- what made you pull back. And just in a moment of candor\nI said, \u201c\u201cW-Well, because you look very much like my father.\u201d And then I showed him a picture\nof my father. And he -- he started to cry, he got -- he -- he got very emotional about that. He th --\nhe thought that was just a wonderful coincidence. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s a Roman Catholic, he was very\ndevout, and he thought surely that God had ordained for this to happen. Well, I -- I had to take\nadvantage of that because all the other prisoners kind of looked upon ov -- Schwartz as almost a\nfather confessor. And they would go to Papa Schwartz and tell him things that they didn\u2019t tell\nanybody else, especially after an -- an interrogation. They were going to Papa Schwartz and say,\nwell they asked me about this, but I told them that, but the truth of the matter is. Well then, after\nI showed -- after wa -- won the confidence of Papa Schwartz, I could go to him, he\u2019d say, don\u2019t\ntrust so and so. And he would -- he would tell me things about what the prisoner had said to him.\nAnd it was that kind of play that -- that resulted in our getting more information than we really\nknew how to cope with, in addition to our official interrogation. We worked for the Nazi war\ncrimes commission, which was headed by Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, who was to be\nour prosecutor for the United States. And they were located in Paris. And -- and this was his\nstaff, th-the general, General Telford Taylor, and Colonel Amon and others who were the\nassistant prosecutors. And they would make up questionnaires, what they wanted to know about\na certain prisoner. They were preparing the case for the prosecution against, say Karl Doenitz,\nGrand Admiral Doenitz. So they had questions about him. Was he present when this particular\ntreaty was signed? Was he there when -- at the Wannsee conference when the final solution was\ndecided on? And then we would get those questionnaires, and then we would have a staff\nmeeting. And Captain Sensnik would say, okay, we have a questionnaire on Doenitz, Dolibois,\nyou -- you handle that one. And then I would -- I would get that questionnaire and then I would\nprepare my interrogation of Doenitz, the intent being to get the answers to those questions, but --\nbut building it around a autobiographical sketch sort of thing. And these were very fascinating\nbecause the prisoner would brag about his accomplishments, what he had done and everything.\nAnd in the course of that you could work in the pas -- specific questions that colonel -- Justice\nJackson wanted answered for his staff. And this is what made the -- it\u2019s kind of a -- a -- an\ninteresting challenge, an interrogation. Well that was the job of each interrogator. We\u2019d\ninterrogate and sometimes it would go on for a week, you\u2019d do nothing but interrogate one\nprisoner, then spend the afternoon writing up your report.",
        "Q: L-L-Let me ask you just specifically, were you taking hand notes --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- or was there someone there taking notes, not --",
        "A: That\u2019s the wor -- no, that\u2019s the worst thing you could do.",
        "Q: Because they would [indecipherable]",
        "A: Psychologically you would -- they would freeze up, ooh, he\u2019s writing that down. I\u2019m not\ngoing to tell him that, that\u2019s going to go on a record. Conversation is what they really wanted to\nknow. And -- and they would just -- a -- this meant -- this is why I said 1t\u2019d go on for a week,\nbecause you\u2019d interrogate maybe for an hour, and then you spend two or three hours putting\ntogether what you -- you had. Part of our training was to pick out pertinent facts to remember, to\nput down in our -- in our reports. Sometimes we\u2019d take a break and then quickly jot down the\nthings that I want to remember and then continue the interrogation, and then from the jotted\nnotes later. But if you sat there with a pencil and asked questions, they freeze, and they would --\nbut if they could just go on and -- and ex -- expound on what they had accomplished, and I did\nthis and I did that and thanks to me this was done. And that\u2019s the sort of thing we were\nencouraging.",
        "Q: Now tell me, were they not suspicious of you five guys walking around talking with them?",
        "A: Well, they knew it -- first of all, they didn\u2019t believe if they were anything but prisoners of\nwar. To tell them, you\u2019re going to have a trial, and you\u2019re going to be tried, that is something that\n-- that was ri -- in the book. There\u2019s nothing in the Geneva Convention or the Warsaw Treaty\nthat says if you lose the war and you\u2019re arrested and you become a prisoner, you might be tried\nfor your crimes. I mean, what -- what is a war crime? That had never been decided until the\nNuremberg trial. And then it isn\u2019t quite clear. Look what we\u2019re doing now. I mean, nobody really\nknows what a war crime is. This -- this business in The Hague going on now with international\ncriminal court, they haven\u2019t defined a war crime as yet. When somebody in Bosnia, a Serb, rapes\na -- a Muslim woman, is that a war crime? Or is it a crime against humanity? What international\ncourt 1s going to try that per -- well, these are the -- the philosophical, legal things that hadn\u2019t\ncome up. So these people didn\u2019t expect to be tried. They were prisoners of war, special prisoners\nof war because of their high rank in -- in the government, or -- and therefore sometimes they\nwould tell you things that they wished they hadn\u2019t told you when they finally went to trial. The\ntrial in itself really wasn\u2019t decided, the specifics of it, until an agreement was reached I think\nsometime in July or August of 1945. Back in May when we were beginning to interrogate these\nmen, nobody knew that there was going to be a trial, per se. We knew that something was going\nto happen.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know what.",
        "A: But we had to get a lot more information before that decision could be reached. And that was\nreally the function of the detention center Ashcan in Luxembourg, to sort of gather information\nto assist the prosecuting staff in developing a case --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- which then would be s -- like a grand jury, yes? A crime has been committed, so now this\nperson is going to be tried for it. A-And that is the -- the function. And we were the investigators\nfor the so-called grand jury, the war crimes commission. Now in my case, in addition to getting\nthese interrogation, I would -- I would go around and -- and collect gossip of what\n[indecipherable] and do them little favors, you know, if -- if the shoestring broke, I\u2019d get them\nanother shoestring. Just little simple things, little toothpaste, a -- or if they had a problem, you\nknow, I\u2019ve a got a toothache, I\u2019d arrange for the dentist to see them, and -- and in that way they -\n- they just started talking. Never -- no, I shouldn\u2019t say never, seldom, about themselves, when it\ncame to I\u2019m guilty of this, or I\u2019m guilty of that, or -- I knew about concentration camps, for\ninstance. But they would say, oh, Dachau, yeah, there was a place like -- ask so and so. He was\ninvolved in that, a-and -- you know, this was the kind of leads that would help us in our\ninterrogation. So our summer travail -- travails in -- in Luxembourg was primarily to get to know\nthe prisoners, their character, their personalities, which would help the prosecutors in developing\ntheir approach when they tried them, and also for historical purposes. We had a lot of historic\nwar cri -- war department commissioned historians who wanted to interrogate these prisoners. So\nmany times we would have a -- a professor from the Hoover Institute or some other think tank,\nwho was working on a particular aspect of the war history that would come and we would\ninterrogate on their behalf, they would sit in on it, but they couldn\u2019t speak German. And we\nwould interrogate the prisoner, and get the information they wanted for their historical prese --",
        "Q: And how would you explain that visit to the prisoner, just --",
        "A: We tell them the truth. Say this man is an historian --",
        "Q: And then when --",
        "A: -- and he\u2019s writing the history of the tank --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- as used by the German command. A-And the -- the tactics that Rommel used in -- in Africa,\nor Goodarian in his tank warfare. And oh yes, they\u2019II tell you all about that.",
        "Q: Because this made them --",
        "A: Yeah, because it -- it -- they could -- this is how they were important. They could build up\ntheir own importance. It\u2019s -- you get that once in awhile in a crime that is committed where the\ncriminal is willing to brag about how many people he has killed, or how many banks he has\nrobbed, because this is the way he builds up his own ego.",
        "Q: Give -- within the context -- I mean, in your autobiography you clearly name so many of the\npeople. Could you just give whoever\u2019s watching this o -- some list of the names of these pri --\nthere were --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- 51 people at the -- at the height of the --",
        "A: Yeah, at -- we had, altogether I think, total, we -- we kept a -- a daily roster of the newcomers\narrivals. Gains -- gains and losses we called them. And the -- and the total number of German\nprisoners who came through this process at nur -- at Luxembourg was 86. That just about\nencompasses everybody who was anybody in the Nazi regime. They would stay with us maybe a\nfew weeks. We had another place near Wiesbaden, it was called Dustbin. And somebody had a\ngood sense of humor, between Ashcan and Dustbin, I like to say we all got a lot of trash between\nAshcan and Dustbin. So somebody at -- at Wiesbaden would -- would want to interrogate a\ncertain prisoner we had in Mondorf and we -- that prisoner would be with us, and then we\u2019d se --\nAlbert Speer, for instance, Speer was traveling all over Europe because people in Paris wanted to\ninterrogate him and then he was up in Wiesbaden and then he went somewhere else, some other\ninstallation. Wherever we had a military unit working on something particularly interesting for\nthat prisoner, we\u2019d move him out. So, nevertheless, the prisoners were divided into three distinct\ncategories. We had members of the German general\u2019s staff. A field marshall -- a generale\nfieldmarshall, General Fieldmarshall Keitel, the chief of the armed forces high command, the\nequivalent to Colin Powell as the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, in that position. He was\nundoubtedly the highest ranking of the Nazi generals. And I call him a Nazi general because he\nwas a member of the general\u2019s staff who was a Nazi. He wouldn\u2019t have been the ch -- with his\nlimited ability, he would never have been the chairman or the -- not chairman, but the -- the\ncommander in chief of the armed forces high command if he hadn\u2019t been a Nazi and ardent\nHitler supporter. So we had Keitel. His deputy, Jodl, generale august Jodl, Alfred Jodl, was the\nchief of operations. Under Jodl it was Warlimont, Walter Warlimont, who was my special\nproject when I worked on the history of that German general staff. He was very cooperative. He\nwas Colonel Geito, who commanded the [indecipherable] during the Spanish revolution when\nthe German -- German army was in -- a German military was supporting Franco in -- in Spain.\nHe was a very interesting guy, spoke English fluently, had married an American girl whom he\nhad met when he was attendin -- attending our army war college in 1928, and he -- he was a very\nhelpful individual. He was present at the attempted assassination of Hitler on July 20\", \u00b044, and\nwas seriously wounded, a brain injury. So he had a medical discharge, which saved him from\nbecoming one of the people -- probably he would have been tried at Nuremberg. But he got a\nmedical discharge and he was out of it after July 20\", \u201944. So a lot of the things that happened\nlater on during the war, the -- the real war crimes, the violations of -- of the Warsaw Treaty and\nGeneva Convention, u -- Warlimont was out of it. Now he was very cooperative and he helped\nus 1n -- in many ways, and I mention in my book an expedition I made with him to get an\nconnection with the history of the general\u2019s staff, and -- and Warlimont was -- was a big help to\nme in gathering information. And he was never tried. And in fact, he was rele -- re -- released\nafter a couple of months at Nuremberg and wasn\u2019t even around when the trials started. Well, then\nthere was General Blaskowitz, and there was von Woonstadt, leader of the Battle of the Bulge,\nvon Blumberg, a former chief of staff. These were members of the German general staff, career,\nhigh ranking, elite. In some cases men of principle because they belonged to the highest social\nclass you but -- you could belong to in Germany, the ger -- genralshtapper, that was it. But with a\nfew exceptions, they were not necessarily in sympathy with the Nazi way of doing things, at least\nas far as we could tell. I don\u2019t think we could ever link von Blumberg, who was a victim of -- of\nHitler\u2019s doings -- von Blumberg was kicked out on a manufactured story and Keitel took his\nplace because Keitel polished the apple and did what Hitler wanted. You couldn\u2019t hold those\nguys responsible for the atrocities because they really were not a part of that. [indecipherable]\nwouldn\u2019t have been tried under those circumstances. So they were very cooperative in working\nwith us, and if you did come to a point where you were discussing war crimes, or tried to weave\nthem into the atrocity aspect, their answer was always, hey, I was just a soldier. I -- I followed\ncommand. Keitel is the guy who was the -- the chief of the armed forces high command, talk to\nhim. The admirals, Grand Admiral Doenitz, who was the successor to Hitler and Grand Admiral\nRaeder, commander in chief the German navy, were part of this, they were members of the\nGerman general\u2019s staff, and they were in that category. In the second group we had what I call\nthe real Nazi trash. The leader of which, of course, would be Julius Streicher, the Jew baiter, who\nprided himself of being a racist. And he, to the very end he was beating his chest with pride, I\u2019m\n-- I\u2019m the leading racist, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a [indecipherable] he called himself a [indecipherable]\nminister. Hasa, the word -- German for hate, and rasa, the word for race, of course, y-you could\njust see that in -- in Streicher right from the beginning. Streicher, gaolighter Franconia, publisher,\neditor, pornographic anti-Semitic newspaper, Der Sturmer. Robert Ley, Labor front leader, who\nsucceeded in strangling himself before the trials began. Leader of the arbeitsfront, the German\nlabor front. You couldn\u2019t get a job in Germany without belonging to the labor front. Fritz\nSauckel, who was the procurement officer for bringing in slave labor to work in Albert Speer\u2019s\nfactories and mines and munitions industries and to build up the war machine and maintain it\nduring the war. Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who betrayed Austria, later became the military governor\nof the Netherlands. Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader. Hans Frank, the butcher of\nPoland, governor general of Poland, who was willing to admit that he signed the documents\nresponsible for the execution of more than two and a half million Jews in -- in Auschwitz and\nBirkenau and the other camps in Poland, for which he had the responsibility. And in this\nparticular case, confessed it, admitted it. Let\u2019s see, in that category were men like Kaltenbrunner,\nErnst Kaltenbrunner, the successor to the hangman Heydrich, who had -- was assassinated in\nCzechoslovakia as you know. I mentioned Hans Frank --",
        "Q: Rosenberg --",
        "A: -- some others come --",
        "Q: Rosenberg, was that --",
        "A: Oh yeah, wi -- Alfred Rosenberg, of course, the Nazi philosopher. Hess would have been in\nthat category, but of course he sat in prison in England and didn\u2019t join us until Nuremberg. But\nhe would have been in that particular group as well. These were the ultercamfer, the old fighters\nwho helped Hitler come to power, who were with him during the putsch in 1923. And he\nreordered them with the positions of -- that had the power of life and death, the gaolighters who\ncould send people to the concentration camp without trial, send them off. They were the people\nwho had limited intelligence. Streicher had the lowest IQ.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Julius Streicher had the IQ of 106, the lowest IQ of the 22 Nazis tried in the first session of\ntribunal. Lot of them had -- lacked even a sound education. Sauckel never went beyond the fifth\ngrade, but they had the power of life and death. They were the -- the Hitler henchmen who had\nhelped -- helped Hitler in the rise of the party. In the third category were the -- the bureaucrats,\nMeisner, Lamers, Schterlein, Selter, von Popham, Admiral [indecipherable] of Hungary. These\nwere the ministers and secretaries who ran the German government. Some of them were active\nduring the Kaiser\u2019s regime in World War I. They changed their political affiliation during the\nWeimar republic and kept their cushioned jobs. When Hitler came along, they became Nazis and\nkept their government jobs. Probably if they\u2019d been there long enough for Stalin to come along,\nthey\u2019d have become communists.",
        "Q: So they were opportunists?",
        "A: They were opportunists. They went with whatever political wind was blowing. So when you\ntake all these people, put them under one roof, you get a real mix, and y-you -- you tend to have\na cliquish development, where they just set off in groups by themselves. And that, from the\npsychology of interrogation was very much in our favor, because we just played one off against\nthe other. We wanted to know about the generals, they told us all they knew about the Nazis.\nAnd if we wanted to know about the Nazis we asked the -- the statesmen, or vice versa, we could\n-- and in that respect they were more cooperative than we wanted them to be because it just made\nus work that much harder. I mean, the more information we got, the harder we had to work in\nwriting it all up. So --",
        "Q: After you\u2019re there for a couple of weeks doing this, 1s -- does this wear on you, having to talk\nwith these folks?",
        "A: Definite -- definitely so. And it got to the point where just living in the same building with\nthem was a real hardship and soon, within three or four weeks after I got there, we moved out.\nAnd we would just come to work in the morning, do our interrogation, and our -- our write-ups\nand do our office work and then at five o\u2019clock go home, and -- unless we had a visitor that we\nhad an evening interrogation with a special commission coming up. A-And -- and that was\nnecessary for your own state of mind because frankly, you got -- you got tired of the smell of it\nall. It was -- even in -- in what used to be a luxury hotel, it had a prison smell, most of all\nbecause sanitary conditions weren\u2019t such that these guys could take a shower every morning, and\nthey didn\u2019t have fresh clothing to put on. You know, they were wearing, a lot of times, the\nclothes that they were taken prisoner in, and months later they\u2019re still wearing the same clothes.\nNow we did try to -- we had a prison laundry, but the laundry service wasn\u2019t exactly a resort\nhotel style. That whole atmosphere, you never really had the privacy. You couldn\u2019t just walk\nfrom my office in room 32, I couldn\u2019t just walk down a hall and go to Captain Sensnik\u2019s office\nwithout meeting one of the prisoners maybe along the way who wanted to gripe about\nsomething, or had a question about something, or who wanted something. And you kind of got\ntired of seeing them. They\u2019re under foot all the time. So we needed to get away. That definitely\nwas -- was necessary. And in my case, personally, because I was playing this role of welfare\nofficer, I was seeing more of them than the other officers were. Consequently, you had the\nwearing -- wearing thin happened a lot quicker with me, probably, than it did with the others. But\nwe all had the same feeling. If I never see another Nazi again I'll be perfectly happy. That was\nsort of the -- the slogan we all adopted there.",
        "Q: But you also had to appear kind of sympathetic. You were not just asking questions and trying\nto get answers. You were creating an atmosphere so that they would trust you. That puts you in a\n-- almost a schizophrenic situation, that\u2019s --",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, that wa -- that was the other as -- especially in cases where families who were\ninvolved. Now I did visit -- I didn\u2019t begin to visit, actually, families, until we moved out of\nLuxembourg and went to Oberhausen. And a part of the group went to Oberhausen, mostly the\ngeneral officers and then others went directly to Nuremberg. Then I went from Oberhausen to --\nexcuse me, to Nuremberg. But during that period, when I started seeing families with children,\neven Edda Goering and -- and Herman Goering would write a letter to his daughter, and I would\nread his letter to his daughter sitting on my lap, and that had to get to me, and -- but the difficulty\n-- and I think this is where our training at Richie was emphatic, on this don\u2019t get personally\ninvolved. Don\u2019t show sympathy, don\u2019t show understanding even in body language. And we were\ntrying not to agree, not to nod your head when they made one of their profound statements which\nmight make them think, he agrees with me. He would have done the same thing if he were in my\nshoes. You had to avoid giving them an opportunity to transfer their doings to you -- their -- their\nphilosophy. In other words, yeah, he may be the enemy, but he agrees with me, cause I saw him\nnod his head, or I saw him smile when I said that. So we had to learn to be very impersonal and\nstone faced, and not to let ourselves be moved by -- by what they -- they said, or what they\nsometimes did. So body language is very important in talking to them, especially someone -- I --\nI -- I like to move my hands when I\u2019m talking so it was very difficult to -- to sort of sit still and --\nand -- and just listen. Little things, like Herr Streicher, a man who couldn\u2019t talk for five minutes -\n- oh, two minutes, without becoming anti-Semitic. Every conversation would lead into his hatred\nof the Jews. Whether he thought that sometimes you felt like giving him a real argument, or even\npunching him in the mouth, because his conversation could rub you the wrong way. He was a\nfoul mouth to begin with, a-and his -- his language was just uncouth. So that was difficult to just\ntolerate. But that same man, when his wife Adele came to the prison, and I told him -- your wife\n-- now, they couldn\u2019t have visitors, and this happened in Nuremberg, not -- not in Luxembourg,\nbut I take that out of sequence here. I told him, your wife is here, what do you want me to tell\nher? And our purpose for being -- for playing this role was to get information. We wanted to\nknow more about th-the prisoner, about his family. Sometimes the wife would tell us -- tell us\nthings about his activities that he hadn\u2019t revealed, just through a short, 10 minute visit. When I\ntold him his wife was there, and that\u2019s the only time she came to visit, he gave me a message for\nher, telling me she should visit hospitals and visit the sick and do whatever she could to help any\norphan children. Well, he was obviously playing up to me. I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: This was Streicher?",
        "A: Streicher.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I -- I can\u2019t believe that he really was that concerned, because if -- 1f you read my report on\nhim, he\u2019s not the kind of a guy who would worry about orphans. But then he suddenly walked up\nto me, and he put his arm on my -- my -- his hand on my arm right here. And he just held it there\nfor a moment and I didn\u2019t know what to make of this because we had no physical contact, we\nnever shook hands, and we never addressed them by their -- their titles, 1t was always Herr\nStreicher. And they very seldom knew our names, even so that they couldn\u2019t call us by name,\nunless they specifically asked, then you told them your name, but we used false names anyhow.\nBut he put his hand right here on my arm and for a moment I didn\u2019t know what to make of this,\nand he held it there. And then he stepped back and he said, \u201cWhen you see my wife, tell her to\nput her hand in the same place on your arm, so we can be -- so we can be close to each other.\u201d\nNow, that sort of thing haunts you because it comes from a man who you\u2019ve already decided,\nhard-hearted, cold, the originator of the Nuremberg Laws, his pornographic, anti-Semitic\nnewspaper. But then a gesture like that catches you completely unawares. And -- and there were\nincidents like that in their correspondence or their conversation where you -- you had to really\nsteel yourself to avoid being sympathetic or giving the impression that yeah, I think you have a\npoint. I agree with you. So --",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: At -- at what point in the -- in the work at Ashcan -- which is such a great name for where you\nwere, did you really understand about the genocides? About the sort of factory-like killing of\nJews, and the mobile killing operations, and the concentration camp system. Was that very\nquick?",
        "A: Well actually, that aspect of it, to me personally, didn\u2019t come to light -- now, two of my\ncolleagues were Jewish, two of about five officers. And one of them had lost his -- his parents at\nAuschwitz. He knew, he -- he knew the sa -- a-and -- and the -- the tales he -- but his knowledge\nof it was limited to his own family experience. He had no idea of what --",
        "Q: Of the scope of it.",
        "A: -- the big scope, the big picture of this was. That really did -- didn\u2019t begin develop until I got\nto Nuremberg and began to see some of the evidence --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- the films. German films.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Their own films captured, and began to see some of the documents, 1 -- which -- which came\nto our intention in the course of an interrogation because questions that were given to us were\nbased on the documents that we were asked to -- the existence of which we were asked to verify,\nthe signatures which we wanted to authenticate and make -- verify as well. That\u2019s when I began\nto -- to learn the atrocities. Then after the trials began, I did have the opportunity, after I left\nNuremberg a-at my strong, urgent request -- but I did go back to Nuremberg time to time to\nfinish a project with a particular general officer, of the generale staff. And I would attend a\nsession and I would hear the evidence. For instance, this man Herse, I heard his testimony. And I\nthink that was one of the first times I really realized how vast this thing was, it -- it wasn\u2019t just\none individual\u2019s doings that led to a certain crime, or an atrocity, this is really a machine, a -- a\nwhole -- this was a government action. Thi -- this weren\u2019t just isolated incidents. And it wasn\u2019t\nuntil really the trials began that -- that that came to my -- to my attention. There\u2019s a -- a -- a very\nserious incident I mention in -- in my book, one I\u2019ve had first hand, for the very first time,\noutside of that brief exposure to Dachau, I d -- I didn\u2019t see any more evidence of the atrocities\nuntil we met a convoy and one particular incident, a convoy of seven two and a half ton trucks\nloaded with bodies being shifted from one mass grave to another. I think I point to that particular\nincident even more so than my first visit to Dachau as the -- the turning point. I realized that this\nwas more than just one crime by one man, or one adventure that one or two people participated\nin, this -- this is mass -- mass production.",
        "Q: I -- I want to ask you about some of these particular men that you were talking with in\nMondorf but -- but let me ask you something. When -- when you would do your rounds, you\nobviously couldn\u2019t see everybody each day --",
        "A: Ob no, no.",
        "Q: -- right?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So you would pick --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",

        "Q: -- a group of people.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And how long would you spend with each of these folks? Would it vary? Would it be 10\nminutes sometimes --",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Frankly, von Ribbentrop, I found him very a -- very repulsive, very annoying. He wa -- he\nwas a -- 1-- 1-- he was a nervous wreck. He was -- annoying is a good way to put -- he got -- he\ngots on your nerves, you -- you\u2019ve met people who get on your nerves?",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, von Ribbentrop was that way. So if I went to see von Ribbentrop, it would be very\nbrief. And I didn\u2019t go see him regularly at all, and maybe I -- I talked to him five or six times in\nthe course of that summer --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- because he didn\u2019t interest me. Rosenberg was another one like that, he was a - a nervous\ntwitcher, he always had -- had something he had to fiddle with, and -- and he had all these\nnervous facial gestures. And -- and he was again somebody whose company you didn\u2019t\nparticularly enjoy or find interesting. So those people you -- you avoided, I -- I would spend\nmore time with somebody like Papa Schwartz or Warlimont. Keitel intrigued me because he was\nsuch a pompous idiot that I sort of always felt superior when I talked to Keitel. Yet, he was a\ngeneral field marshall, you know, five star general, I was just a first lieutenant, but -- [tape break,\nmusic] -- very painful it was, how he hadn\u2019t been able to sleep a wink. And I said why didn\u2019t you\ntell the guard, we had a guard, all he had to do was call th -- call the guard. He could walk out of\nhis room and tell the guard in the hall that he wanted to see the doctor. Well, he was a general\nfield marshall, he wasn\u2019t going to tell an ordinary enlisted man that he had a boil on his neck.\nHe\u2019d rather suffer all night long and wait until an officer came, so he could say officer to officer.\nWell, my reaction to that was, good, I hope the boil really gave you a pain. S-So that was a\ndifferent kind of a visitor. And then there were -- Streicher fascinated me because it was like\ngoing to a zoo and -- and watching a particularly strange animal because he\u2019s repugnant in one\nsense, but you can\u2019t take your eyes off him. I liked to spend time with Streicher, just to see him -\n- hear him rant and rave until I got bored, and then I -- I would leave him. Ley was another\ncomedian.",
        "Q: Comedian?",
        "A: Comedian. Ley was -- well, first of all, he stammered. He stammered -- he -- he stuttered\noccasionally only on a letter. Like, my name 1s ho -- h-ho -- ho -- [tape break, ad for USN] --\nlook at -- h-he would say, if I could have some of that good American whiskey, it would [speaks\nGerman here] it would loosen my tongue.",
        "Q: Loosen my tongue.",
        "A: Yeah, it -- make a smooth talker out of him.",
        "Q: But you also said in your book that he was never sensible, he didn\u2019t -- there was no sensible\nconversation out of him.",
        "A: No, you couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I say he was a comedian. He -- he would just -- you would end\nup laughing, he would amuse you, without trying to amuse you, because he took himself very\nseriously. He felt that he -- he really was a creator, he had big ideas, and he did, but he didn\u2019t\nhave the ability to carry them out. He could fantasize and he was going to reconstruct Germany\nand bring in all the Jews that had left Germany and bring them back and make up to the Jews the\npersecution and the atrocities that we had enforced on them. And give them a chance to help\nreorganize a-and reconstruct Germany with himself in charge. And he\u2019d be willing to do it out of\nhis prison cell in Nuremberg.",
        "Q: Oh really?",
        "A: Course, he\u2019d like to have it fixed up a little bit so it\u2019d be more comfortable, but -- but he\u2019d be\nperfectly willing to --",
        "Q: To do that.",
        "A: -- to direct the whole thing. But this sort of nonsense, he was good at. When we finally told\nhim point blank that the allied -- allied authorities were not about to accept his master plan for\nthe reconstruction of Germany, he became suicidal. And that\u2019s when we put a 24 hour guard on\nhis cell. And this is in Nuremberg now.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But he fooled the guard and -- and he did strangle himself. And I was on duty that night. I had\nthe questionable pleasure of -- of cutting him down and calling for help, and -- and h-he had\nsucceeded in ripping the strong edge of a towel, out of which he made a noose. And then he tore\nparts of his underwear, which he stuffed in his mou -- keeping in mind he\u2019s under guard,\nsomebody\u2019s watching him, with a spotlight on him all night long. And he put the -- the fragments\nof his underwear in his mouth so he wouldn\u2019t gag, put the noose around his neck, then went to\nthe toilet. And when he sat on the toilet, only his feet would show far -- from the viewpoint of\nthe guard outside his door. Then he looped that noose over the flushpipe, stand pipe with a\nbutton on it to flush the toilet, came about yay high, and he put the noose over, and then literally\nforced himself forward and strangled himself. When the guard gave the alarm because he\u2019d been\nsitting on the toilet too long, I was the duty officer that night and I had the key to the cell. And\nwhen I opened it up, it was too late already, he was dead. Of course then we got the doctors and\neverything else. Dr. -- a Swiss -- Zukli, a Swiss doctor performed an autopsy on him and found a\n-- a damaged brain. Part of his brain was damaged, and that was the result of an -- he was a\nnavigator in airplane in the Luftwaffe in World War I, which crashed. And that really is what\nresulted in his stuttering, stammer, and also probably is -- the way his mind functioned, he just\nwasn\u2019t quite the same, so -- but -- but he was an interesting person to talk to from that standpoint,\ncause you didn\u2019t know what he was going to come up with next to get -- to provide a little levity\nin the -- the day\u2019s operations.",
        "Q: Can I go back to Streicher a few minutes?",
        "A: But di -- he --",
        "Q: When he -- when -- when Streicher came into the Palace hotel, t-to Ashcan, and Doenitz\ncomes up to you and says we da -- you know, we\u2019re not eating with this guy, he\u2019s not coming\ninto the dining room, right.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You -- you all end up -- you put him on another floor.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: On a separate [indecipherable]",
        "A: Nobody wanted to room with him.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But Ley was willing to -- we called them the Bobbsey Twins.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Ley was the only one who was sympathetic to Streicher. So Ley said that he would -- he\nwould be willing to room with Streicher. But we put Streicher at first into -- into -- on the second\nfloor where there were no other prisoners, because nobody wanted to room with him and we\ndidn\u2019t have any more room upstairs. And then Streicher indicate -- Ley indicated that he\u2019d be\nwilling to room with Streicher, so we put the two together, cause as I say, we had a purpose for\nwanting them to relate to each other, conversation-wise and everything else. Ley was very much\ntaken with Streicher, he admired him. But that feeling wasn\u2019t particularly returned on Streicher\u2019s\npart. He -- he didn\u2019t -- Streicher didn\u2019t particularly care for Ley, he -- he thought he was a\nweakling. He -- he wasn\u2019t match -- a masochist like Streicher was. Streicher was all muscle and -\n- and show off masochist. But Ley was just a direct opposite, he was a wimp. And so Streicher\nhad this tendency to look down on Ley. But that was the only one -- the only two who -- who\nwere willing to be together. And the dining room -- course they had to eat together, but they had\ndifficulty finding somebody to -- to sit with them, unless there was no place, and they -- they had\nto sit with them. But there was very little conversation between Streicher -- everybody despised\nhim. I mean, they -- they just didn\u2019t care for him, especially Goering, who was the one that filed\ncharges against him, and brought him before the court, the Nazi court, which is -- Walter Buch,\nwho was another one of our prisoners that I didn\u2019t mention. He was the chief justice of the -- of\nthe Nazi court, you know, the -- when a Nazi committed a crime against another Nazi, he was\nnot tried in a criminal court, he was tried in a Nazi court, and Walter Buch was the superior\njudge of this -- this Nazi court. Buch, incidentally, was the father-in-law of Martin Bormann,\nwho was Hitler\u2019s adjutant and the guy that pretty much spoke for Hitler and signed a lot of orders\nthat are still today being questioned as to the authenticity, did they come from Bormann or\nHitler. So Bormann was a very important guy, you know, he -- unfortunately we didn\u2019t have him\nwith us. And Buch was the father-in-law of this man, too. Another one that I didn\u2019t mention who\nwas part of that Nazi trash [indecipherable] was Wilhelm Frick, who\u2019d been sec -- Minister of\nthe Interior and was really the guy who wrote the -- the original Nuremberg laws. The -- the law\n-- the legal --",

        "Q: -- to start talking about Wilhelm Frick --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and your experience with him, what kind of a person was he, and what was your experience\nin talking with him?",
        "A: He was a nonentity, I would say. And even the Nazis considered him a -- a nobody. He was\npowerful because, you know, the Minister of the Interior in Germany, even today in -- in many\nEuropean governments, is in charge of the police force, and has a lot more power than the\nSecretary of the Interior does in -- in -- comparatively in the United States. So the Minister of the\nInterior was truly a -- an important position. But once Hitler became the fuehrer, when he was --\nyou know, Hitler held three jobs. He was the fuehrer, that\u2019s the leader of the Nazi party, that was\nreally the title fuehrer, and the one that he preferred, which incidentally Streicher gave him.\nWhen they first met, in a beer hall in -- in Munich, and Streicher, who was the leader of an anti-\nSemitic faction in Nuremberg, heard about this labor party group in Munich, which was headed\nby Hitler. And he went to Munich to hear this man Hitler, about whom he had heard, speak. And\nhe describes in his testimony, he thought he actually saw a halo around his head, he thought this\nis the Messiah, this is the man who is going to ser -- s-save Germany, whereupon he went to\nHitler, and said, \u201cYou are my fuehrer. I will follow you, and everything I have is yours.\u201d In his\nfamous words. And Streicher was one of the few members of the inner party who could dootz\nHitler, address him in the familiar German du. Streicher was one of the few who cou -- even\nGoering didn\u2019t have that power, but Streicher could -- could do that. And Hitler liked that fuehrer\nbusiness, and it was Streicher, at their first meeting, who suggested it to him. And it was the\nunion of those two parties from Nuremberg and from Munich that made the -- the dare -- day ap\n-- the deutsche arbeit party of Munich a national deutsche arbeit party, because the two\ncommunities merged, thanks to Streicher, which was why Streicher was particularly dear to\nHitler, and considered him very close, and vice versa. Well, Frick was important at -- at the\nbeginning, and he was a -- I think he wanted to be the police, or he was the police commissioner\nin -- in Munich at the time of the putsch. And he was active in Hitler\u2019s political endeavors, and\nof course became one of the followers. And then he was elected to the Reichstag and Hitler\nbecame chancellor and named him Minister of the Interior. But then when Himmler came into\nthe play, and took over the Gestapo and the -- the -- the SS and all -- all the police duties and the\nsecurity services went to Himmler and Frick really had nothing to do. He -- his position was\nstrictly a -- up until beyond 1935, he -- he was really nobody. He really did -- didn\u2019t have much\nof a -- arole, and colorless, sort of a -- a gray aura about him. His whole appearance, gray hair,\ngray face and gray clothes, he -- he was just -- in a bunch of people, he would never stand out.\nEven if there were only two people in a room, he wouldn\u2019t stand out.",
        "Q: Did he admit to being a racist?",
        "A: He wa --",
        "Q: Did he admit to being a racist?",
        "A: Well, ya --",
        "Q: Do you remember?",
        "A: Yeah, well, yeah -- yes --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- but it was legal. You see, 1-1t was -- everything he did was legal. He -- he was the -- a legal\ninterpretation. And yes, of course the Jews had to be done away with because that was the law,\nand the Nuremberg laws, and no question about it. Now, if you say, did you have anything to do\nwith the concentration camp -- which incidentally was not a question we -- I don\u2019t remember -- I\ndon\u2019t think I ever asked it of anybody, cause I really didn\u2019t know. I -- I just -- wasn\u2019t in my -- I\nthink with Streicher, it -- 1t had to come up, as I recall, o-of his -- of his own volition. Where he\nwould bring it up, but never the details, as far as people being abused or starved. The\nconcentration camp, as Streicher explained it to me, is very simple. Here were these communists,\nand these communists were causing a lot of problems -- I\u2019m giving Streicher\u2019s explanation. And\nso when the big election came along, at which time Hitler was to be the plebiscite, when Hitler\nwas to be the supreme being, the fuehrer of the political party and then the chancellor of the\nGerman Reich, which ran the government, and then the president of the German Reich, after\nHindenburg. So he was president, chancellor and fuehrer. Political, organizational and\nceremonial. So he really had three jobs under the title of fuehrer. Well, when all of this came into\nbeing, the communists had to be concentrated out of sight so that they couldn\u2019t cause any\nproblems. They were having demonstrations and disrupting political meetings, and the\ncommunists were causing problems. So they were put into school buildings and even some\nabandoned factories, as a temporary measure to concentrate them out of sight where we could\nconcentrate -- keep our eyes on them. Then, after the election, and Hitler came to power, it was\njust convenient to keep them there. It turned out that many of the communists were Jews, so it\nwas natural for those communists, and those Jews to end up in the concentration camps. But you\ncouldn\u2019t keep them in these temporary facilities, so he had to build facilities for them. And this is\nhow Dachau came into being a concentration camp, to bring these people together from the\nschool building and factories where they were tentatively kept, and put them into one camp. That\nof course was the beginning. The ultimate solution, of course was, as the camps grew bigger and\nmore and more people ended up in them, and the problem of feeding them, and they could no\nlonger buy their way out of Germany by surrendering their property to the German regime, they\nhad to come up with a final solution, the final solution was extermination. And that, of course is\nwhen Birkenau and -- and Auschwitz and the others came in -- into being. And that was the\nwhole pattern. Now Streicher took responsibility only up to when the camps were built, like\nDachau. And then points out that he actually at Christmastime, as a Christmas gift, a humane\ngesture on his part, to prove what a big heart he had, he actually arranged for the release of some\nof these people from concentration camps. Communists, never Jews. He never arranged for a\nJew. And this -- I\u2019m quoting him now, how proud he was, \u201cNobody could ever accuse me of\nletting a Jew out of a concentration camp.\u201d That had to be put in. That was part of his -- his\nmake-up. But he had a Christmas party and he would invite the families of these people that he\nwas releasing from the concentration camp. And they didn\u2019t know it, the families didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going to happen, neither did the prisoners. They were suddenly whisked away to some\ngym, or some public building, then the doors would be opened, and the families, and the -- the\ninmates would come together. And you know, nine out of 10 of those would become members of\nthe Nazi party in appreciation. And this is why he did it, because he was the goodwill -- a lot of\nthese communists became Nazis after he released them from the concentration camp.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what he told you.",
        "A: That was one of his accomplishments and -- and that was really his motivation, but he never\nlet Jews out. That was his kins -- his principles. Well, Fr-Frick, as I said, his role in all of this\nwas that he merely -- his job was to write the laws, interpret the laws as Minister of the Interior,\nand to follow those laws. And nothing he did was ever illegal, according to him, he always\nfollowed the law. So he did not -- couldn\u2019t understand why he was being put in with all these\nother people who were -- who -- who went beyond the law, obviously, because that resulted in\nall the atrocities.",
        "Q: How about Herman Goering? Let -- let me quote -- quote you from your autobiography, you\nsaid he was the easiest Nazi to interrogate. He was able, shrewd manager, brilliant and brave,\nruthless and grasping. At times almost a pleasure to be with, at other times a pain in the ass.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "Q: But it was always interesting to be with him.",
        "A: Yup, well that --",
        "Q: How about [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- that -- that is it in -- and I\u2019ve saved that characterization because it -- 1t still fits in\nretrospect, looking back on it. And first of all, Goering did not fit any of the three categories that\nI mentioned. Nor was he accepted in those three categories. Now, he was president of the\nReichstag, which would put him in with the bureaucracy, wouldn\u2019t it? With the government, the\nsecretaries and the ministers. Well, they didn\u2019t accept him. They didn\u2019t want him. He was not\nreally one of them. So he was shut out of that group, von Popham, and -- and Meisner, Selta,\nthose, they wanted nothing to do with him. First of all, because he was promoted over their\nheads. They were the men with experience and everything else, and here he -- overnight, he\nbecame the president of the Reichstag, he wasn\u2019t really one of them. Military man, yes, seven\nstar general, Reichsmarshall, the highest military rank ever attained by anybody in history,\nexcept Hannibal maybe. But he wasn\u2019t mem -- a member of the German general\u2019s staff. He -- he\nwas never considered the -- the red stripe of the generale\u2019s staff. So they didn\u2019t accept him, none\nof the generals wanted anything to do with him. I mean, imagine a guy who, you know, who\ncomes from the rank of a -- a lieutenant in the riktorfin squadron suddenly becomes a seven star\nReichsmarshall of the Reich. And so there was jealousy and there was lack of respect and they\nnever took him seriously. And incompetence. Goering was not a very competent man in a sense\nof organization and -- he -- he could talk a big show, but he could never deliver the goods. He\nreally wasn\u2019t a producer. So he was resented by the military and he wasn\u2019t accepted. And he\ndidn\u2019t really fit into the Nazi element because he was above them all. He was strutting in his\nuniforms and make -- making himself super rich by his acquisitions of art and [indecipherable]\nand special train. And then of course the -- the four year plan and the Herman Goering werker.\nSo he\u2019s also an industrialist, in addition to being the huntmaster of Germany, in addition to being\nthe commander in chief of the Luftwaffe. So the other Nazis never considered him part of their\ngroup, even though he had participated in the putsch. So he\u2019s pretty much isolated. He really\nwasn\u2019t accepted. Plus, the conflict between Doenitz and Goering. Hitler in his last will and\ntestament specified that Doenitz, Grand Admiral Doenitz was to be -- to take his place and\nbecome the president or whatever, of the Reich, of the fourth Reich. But as far as Goering was\nconcerned, he was designated to be Hitler\u2019s successor, and it was only because Bormann either\nmisinterpreted or withheld Goering\u2019s last message to Hitler from the [indecipherable] Salzburg\nto Berlin, which resulted in Hitler condemning Goering and supposedly sentencing him to death,\nto be assassinated by the -- by -- executed by the SS. That really wasn\u2019t Hitler\u2019s doing, that was\nBormann, who intercepted the letters and acted not on Hitler\u2019s behalf, but on his own behalf. So\nas far as Goering was concerned, he was still the president of the class. And this group photo I\nhave, who sits in the middle? The president of the class. Who is the successor, Doenitz? He\u2019s in\nthe back row. Well, those two fought each other all the time, never face to face, but to us they\nsay, well Goering did this wrong, he did that wrong, and he\u2019s a nobody and then of course,\nDoenitz didn\u2019t do this and didn\u2019t do that right. So that contest was going on all the time,\ncompeting for each other for the crown under those circumstances, which was amusing. Now\nGoering personally then, to be with him was -- was -- the nice part was, when you left Goering,\nif you got bored with his pomposity and his braggadocio, you could just say, well Herr Goering,\nI -- I have to leave now, I have another appointment. And as far as he was concerned, that\u2019s\nokay, I let you go now, I\u2019m giving you permission to leave. He was always condescending. He\nnever -- he never acted like he was a prisoner in -- he was always in charge. When you went to\ninterrogate him, you were visiting him. It wasn\u2019t interrogation. Or when he came to your room\nfor an interrogation. Sometimes an interrogation was done out in the gar -- on the garden. We\u2019d\ngo for a walk together in the hotel gardens and talk. But it was always, I\u2019m free to talk to you\nnow, you can come and see me. Or I\u2019Il give you an appointment at one o\u2019clock this afternoon for\na visit to your room. So he dismissed you and welcomed you always as the Reichsmarshall on\n[indecipherable]. Secondly, you -- you had to take that with a grain of salt and that\u2019s part of the\ngame. Secondly, he had a terrific sense of humor, he really did. And he enjoyed himself\ntremendously, h-his own jokes. He could laugh harder at his own jokes than anybody I knew.\nAnd I think I mentioned in my book that he had a collection of jokes being told about him in the\nunderground, which he collected, he had written up in a little ba -- joke book. And occasionally,\nif he was in the mood, he would produce his little book and that reminded him of a story, and he\nwould tell you a joke out of his -- his little book. Sometimes off-color jokes, but always with\nhimself as the butt of the joke. If you were caught telling a joke like that in Germany, that was\ngood for six months in a concentration camp. But he collected the joke and -- and save it. He was\nable to laugh at himself, which is a strange thing to say about a man who took himself very, very\nseriously, and who spent every living moment making sure that you knew that he was really the\nleading Nazi and he was really in charge. And he did this and did that, and he was one of the few\nwho admitted building this and building that, and this was really his responsibility. He\naccomplished that; I, Herman Goering. Yet, he could tell jokes about himself if he was in the\nmood. He had to be in the mood; he was a very moody person. Part of which was due to the fact\nhe\u2019s a drug addict. He took paracodeine tablets -- well, the numbers differ. Some writers say a\nhundred tablets a day. I would say that was a little bit much. But he -- he chewed them like\nM&Ms. And he had a pocket full. He actually arrived with -- with a box. I think he confiscated\nall the paracodeine in Germany before he was taken prisoner. And these were tablets that he just\nchewed. One individual tablet probably very weak, but four or five would have the effect of a\nValium, and he would take a handful and just chew on them, and then maybe a half an hour later,\ntake another handful. And we guessed that he consumed -- by Dr. Flicker, who was the German\ndoctor, and we had an American doctor as well, estimated that he was taking between 60 and 80\na day of -- of these little paracodeine tablets, about the size of M&Ms. They broke him of the\nhabit, with his cooperation, by reducing the dosage. At first he didn\u2019t realize they were doing it,\nand then gradually he participated, and then willingly, and almost proudly, to the extent that he\nlost weight, he lost 80 pounds while in prison, and actually began to feel pretty good. As he\nwould say, prison life was good for my health, and -- because he lost weight and said that\nphysically he felt better after six months in Mondorf and Nuremberg than he had ever in his adult\nlife, ever since the time of the putsch when he became morphine addicted, so -- but all the time\nthat he was in the Reich, he was, of course, was a morphine addict, and went into the tank from\ntime to time to be dried out and to take the cure. And this paracodeine was a way of -- of setting\nthat. And when they broke him of the habit, he really -- by the time the trials began, he was in\npretty good shape, compared to the flab that he was when he first was taken prisoner. Now, other\ntimes, if he was in a bad mood, we just stayed away from him because he wouldn\u2019t cooperate, he\nwouldn\u2019t talk. He would just say, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like talk -- talking today, and -- I\u2019m not interested,\nI don\u2019t want to talk to you today.\u201d And that was it, nothing you could do about it. He was afraid\nof thunder and lightning.",

        "Q: He was --",
        "A: Yeah that, I think Hasenclever or somebody else, another author has mentioned that. But I -- I\nactually went in his cell one time during a thunderstorm, and he was hiding under the -- under\nthe cot. Literally shrunk under the cot, because of the -- the terrific thunder storm and lightning,\nand he was frightened. And this was early in Mondorf. And I think part of that was the -- the\ndrug mentality. I wa -- being generous in saying that, I -- he was not a coward, cause he was an --\nan ace in World War I, so it wasn\u2019t on that basis. It had to be part of his mental outlook, or -- or\nhis mental condition at -- at that particular time.",

        "A: And like -- yeah, it just -- cowed.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: L1-Literally cowed by it, yeah. One amusing anecdote, which is part of my pattern of circles, I\n-- I tell in my book and is worth repeating, because it\u2019s quite significant. As I said, Goering was\npretty much isolated by the others, with the result that most frequently he would eat by himself,\nsometimes by choice because all the -- all the other guys were eating there, but here is where the\nReichsmarshall eats. When he did eat with somebody else, it would usually be because he\nwanted to discuss some important matter that came to mind. Then he would actually make an\nappointment for lunch with -- or -- or dinner with -- with the people. Well, we took turns, the\nduty officer on occasion, like the meal times. And I happened to be duty officer, you know,\nduring a dinner -- lunch time, once. And as I said, we had ordinary German prisoners who\ndelivered -- who prepared the food and -- and serve it. And this German -- ex-German corporal, I\nthink he was, who was a regular prisoner of war, worked in the kitchen, served -- came in. And I\nhappened to be standing near Goering\u2019s table when he sat down and this man brought plate of\nstew, set it before Goering on a heavy porcelain dish, no knives or forks permitted, they -- they\nate with spoo -- they ate with the spoons and all the food that was prepared was spoonable. They\ndidn\u2019t need a knife to cut their food, there were stews and things of that nature. 1600 calories a\nday, no more. That was prescribed by the Geneva Convention. This man set the plate of stew\nbefore Goering and Goering looked at it and smelled it, then he pushed it aside. And then he\ngrowled at this PW, he said, \u201cTake that slop away. I fed my dog much better than that back\nhome.\u201d And this PW took the plate of stew, and stepped back and he clicked his heels and\nbowed, and he said, \u201cIn that case, Herr Reichsmarshall, your dog ate much better than we\nGerman soldiers did.\u201d Made an about face and walked out. Well, that was quite a memorable\noccasion. Forty years later, I\u2019m the ambassador in Luxembourg and the city of Mondorf decided\nto make me an honorary citizen of Mondorf, which is quite an honor over there, because the -- I\ndon\u2019t know what -- what you get for it. I think you don\u2019t get arrested if you speed, or you can\npark any place you want to. Whatever, I\u2019ve never taken advantage of it, but they have a street\nnamed for me, which -- which 1s great, I think that\u2019s a real thrill because every day somebody is\nmentioning my name. They\u2019ve got to -- you know, if they\u2019re arrested, or have groceries shipped\nto them, or apply for a driver\u2019s license, where do you live? They\u2019ve got to name me and so that\u2019s\na -- that\u2019s an everlasting honor that\u2019s going to be there as long as the street is. But I became an\nhonorary citizen, they had a big ceremony, the mayor, and the town council and the boy scouts\nand girl scouts and the village band, everybody was out. And Winnie and I arrived in the embas -\n- embassy car with the American flag, embassy flag. One of those nice ego trips, of which we\nhad many. And we stepped out and they played the national anthems of both countries and -- and\nthen the mayor, with his red, white and blue sash, his symbol of rank. And we had a\n[indecipherable] there. And then we met some -- met some of the other guests, including a man\nwho was very Germanic in his approach, you know, the stiff legged, head bowing. And he\nintroduced himself as Rudolf Diebenbush from Koblenz, and he was a special guest because he\nhad asked to be invited to this occasion because he had read in the paper that the American\nambassador was a former interrogator and was being honored in Mondorf as an honorary citizen.\nAnd since he had been a PW at the installation at that particular time, he was sure that he knew\nthe ambassador, although Dolibois didn\u2019t mean anything to him, he knew me as Gillen. So then\nhe came -- then when he saw my face, he began to put two and two together and says, that -- that\n-- that was Lieutenant Gillen, Oberloitman Gillen. So he was pleased to meet me and -- and\nmade a big show of who he was and so forth. Well, I was pleased to meet him too, and we started\nto make -- compare some notes. Then he tapped me on the shoulder, and he said, \u201cMr.\nAmbassador, Herr [indecipherable],\u201d he said, \u201cdo you remember the incident when a soldier\nserved a plate of stew to Goering?\u201d And said, \u201cThat was me, Rudolf Diebenbush from Koblenz.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same. I didn\u2019t recognize him because he\u2019s 40 years older. But that was Rudolf\nDiebenbush from Koblenz. P-Pattern of circles.",
        "Q: And what did Goering do when he did that? Did he just -- he didn\u2019t say -- did he say anything,\nor --",
        "A: Well, it -- it is -- I -- I was in the back -- back of the --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- so I didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t see his facial expression, and he -- there nothing he could say, but in\nmy own mind, that man would have lost his head if that had happened six months earlier, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The tables had been turned. I classify that as one of my ironic experiences.",
        "Q: I -- I understand when you were talking with Goering about German atrocities, he would\nmention the atrocities committed by other countries.",
        "A: Oh yes, very quickly, beginning with the atom bomb, who dropped it on Hiroshima and\nNagasaki. And who is the -- who\u2019s the real war criminal. By comparison how many did you kill,\ncompared to the numbers you accuse us of killing? That was one of his favorite lines.\nConcentration camps? We learn about concentration camps from the Russians. And of course he\n-- he didn\u2019t bring up the -- the massacre in Poland and he --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] Polish --",
        "A: -- he had all of that very ca -- yeah.",
        "Q: -- the Polish [indecipherable |",
        "A: And he -- he had -- he had all the history. He -- he knew -- and he could go back to\nconcentration camps of long, long time ago. You know, he never -- he was not anti-Semitic\naccording to him. It all depended who the Jew was. If he was an eastern Jew from\nCzechoslovakia or Poland, that\u2019s different, we don\u2019t want them, get them out of Germany, get rid\nof them. Now don\u2019t kill them. He didn\u2019t believe in killing them, but he believed in getting rid of\nthem by hook or by crook, just get rid of them. Don\u2019t torture them, don\u2019t kill them. That was not\nhis idea, he says. Now, if he was a German Jew, and had not committed any crime against the\ngovernment, he very frequently said that he protected them. In fact, there was some good -- some\npeople in his household who were Jewish. Even his successor, Milch, was part Jewish, and he\nsucceeded him as commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, and he claimed that he was criticized for\nthat because Milch is part Jew. But in Germany, I say who is a Jew and who isn\u2019t a Jew. That\nwas one of his bylines. So, he was an interesting character, no matter how you -- how you sliced\nit, no matter what mood he was in.",
        "Q: But at one point in -- in your autobiography, you said it wasn\u2019t difficult to get them to talk,\nbut what was really difficult was to try to figure out what the truth was.",
        "A: What the truth was, yes. And -- and what was deliberate gossip. They were -- they were just\ngossiping, or -- or were they really telling the truth. The challenge in that was for us to try to\nlearn as much -- what -- I can only speak for myself, to learn as much about the German\ngeneral\u2019s staff before I interrogated somebody about the staff, so that I could tell when -- you\nknow, when he was pulling my leg, or when he was just stretching a point. Which meant doing\nhomework before you even begin an interrogation. And that was difficult because we knew very\nlittle. We knew more about Frederick the Great and the German general\u2019s staff back in the 18\"\ncentury, but we didn\u2019t know anything about the relationship of the German general\u2019s staff to the\nrise of Hitler, the role that they played in his coming to power, or the role that they played in\nexecution and planning of the war. And this 1s what we needed to learn, we -- that\u2019s what our\nhomework is all about. And that is where this man Warlimont proved very valuable to me. It got\nto the point where if I had a sp-specific interrogation report about the general\u2019s staff to ask of\nDoenitz, for instance -- Jodl -- I never interrogated Jodl cause he was very uncooperative, yes or\nno. Everything was yes or no. And -- and he -- he just -- you never got much out of him. I don\u2019t\nknow who -- I don\u2019t know of anybody of the other interrogators ever got anything out of him. He\nwas a very strict soldier, name, rank and serial number, and he played that for all he was worth.\nAnd as far as he was concerned, the prisoner of war and you didn\u2019t have a right to try him. So, if\nI would interrogate Kesselring, or Blaskowitz, or one of those guys, I go to Warlimont first and\nask him the same questions, by way of doing homework. And then doing the interrogation and\nverifying what Warlimont had given me in relationship to the answers to the questions I was\ngetting from the prisoner.",
        "Q: So what has hap -- obviously before the Nuremberg trial, there must be a huge number of\npeople looking over all the confiscated papers, the documents. Now, is Jackson and some of the\npeople working for him coming down to Mondorf and talking with you folks?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, so you don\u2019t -- you\u2019re not getting that --",
        "A: That didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: -- that information.",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t -- they separated legal staff and the military intelligence staff\ncompletely. We were -- it is just like a private investigator working on a crime, and giving his\ninformation to the prosecutor. But the -- the investigator then doesn\u2019t become part of the -- the\nprocess. And that\u2019s pretty much the role we play. We were investigating the character and -- and\nthe people and the incidents and verifying. A lot of our stuff was, do you recognize this\ndocument, do you know what it means? Is that your signature, or is that Goering\u2019s signature as\nyou know it? That\u2019s -- that type of thing. Then after we got to Nuremberg -- I did no\ninterrogating at Nuremberg. At -- at Nuremberg I was strictly -- first sent there to get the\ninformation that Ley had, who claimed that he had some important information that he would\ngive only to me -- in a letter he sent to Lieutenant Gillen. So I was sent to Nuremberg on -- on\ntemporary assignment for six days to -- to get that from Ley. And after that I was to come back\nhome. But meanwhile, unbeknownst to me, Colonel Andrews pulled strings to keep me in\nNuremberg because I guess -- well, because it was comfortable to have -- have me around, cause\nI brought back his days of power in -- in Luxembourg. In Nuremberg Andrews didn\u2019t have much\nclout because Jackson was in charge. And except for guarding the prison, Andrews really had\nnothing to do with the prisoners. For that matter, I don\u2019t think he ever -- he -- he didn\u2019t see the\nprisoners day by day, face -- eyeball to eyeball like he did in Luxembourg. And he missed that,\nand he -- he really was a figurehead in -- in Nuremberg. So he wanted his old team back, so he\ntried to keep me there. And that was -- but he had to find something for me to do. So I became\nspecial assistant to -- to him, to carry out his orders. Well, he had no orders, he really had none,\nexcept let him know -- if you talk to these guys, let me know if they\u2019re committing suici -- trying\nto commit suicide, or if they\u2019re doing something unusual. Like one guy who was -- who had\nbeen Himmler\u2019s chauffeur, who listened to the radio all the time, putting his ear to the\n[indecipherable] dial, I mean that kind of stuff, and Andrews liked him, then it -- so then, in\norder to have something to do -- meanwhile, I was pulling strings to get out of Nuremberg. I was\nfed up with the whole operation, I didn\u2019t want any more of it. And Andrews 1s trying to keep me,\nand we finally made a deal. If I got somebody to succeed me, then I could go, and then he would\nstop trying to hold onto me; cause he needed me. And that is when we got Gustav Gilbert. I went\nthrough the Richie crowd, and Gilbert had been an interrogator, I think at Wiesbaden, so that\nwhen he came to Nuremberg -- he was a psychologist professionally and he got -- he had book\nwritten all over him before he came, and he was ready to go. He had his book planned. And --\nand so Gilbert began to take over this visiting each prisoner in his cell. And up to that point, the\nRorschach analysis test came into play in that -- Major Douglas, Douglas Kelly was the prison\npsychiatrist. He was a professional psychiatrist, whose job it was to test these prisoners, you get\ntheir IQ, their personality quirks, their state of mind. Anything else that the inkblot test reveals.\nA lot of these people were self-appointed. Back in those days, really, for those first six months or\nso after the war, you could pretty much do what you wanted to do, and write your own orders\ncause everyb -- everybody\u2019s in turmoil. And if you could just get somebody to say, okay, I\u2019m\nappointing Lieutenant Dolibois chairman of the zoo, and I\u2019d be chairman of the zoo. So this guy\nGilbert arrived -- Douglas arrives on the scene, and he\u2019s a prison psychiatrist, a-and he\u2019s\nprimarily working for some institute, I think it was the Drexel Institute, to test these prisoners.\nBut the information would also be useful to the tribunal because it would help them understand.\nSo he became very important, prison psychiat -- except he couldn\u2019t speak German. So then they\nfound out that I had majored in psychology in college, so I knew -- I knew that -- the terms, with\nthe result I became the interpreter for the Rorschach analys -- which I loved, it was a lot of fun.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: And -- I just -- he gave the questions and I interpret -- translated and gave the answers. And --\nand then he would ask me to write what I thought after an interroga -- after an -- an interview,\nwhat\u2019d you think of this? And then I would write my layman\u2019s report of what I think the prisoner\nwas like. And then he combined that with his technological -- his -- his scientific analysis, and it\nmade for a pretty intelligent report. The layman could read his report, whereas if it had been all\nscientific, probably nothing would have -- not much would have come of -- and this is my first\nmeeting with Hess, I had not interrogated Hess before, because he was in England. So was my --\nmy meeting with Hess 1s strictly for the Rorschach analysis test. And that was interesting, and of\ncourse on Goering and -- and Rosenberg. And that opened up a whole new avenue of getting to\nknow them from -- from that side, see?",
        "Q: What did you learn that was different from doing these Rorschach tests than what you already\nknew, do you think?",
        "A: Well, our interrogation before was based on the questionnaires. We were merely getting\nanswers to what we were asked to get informa -- then, mine was supplemented by -- by me,\nwhen my -- my inquiring about their welfare, and how many children you have, and how is your\nwife, and where is your wife now, and where did you live. What did you do before you became\nthis. That kind of gossip information.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: And then the personality -- as I said, the gossip, who was sleeping with whom. Who was\nhaving an affair with whose wife. Bormann\u2019s thigh bones were actually abnormally short, did\nyou know that?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Well, see now Buch told me that, I would never have known, that Bormann seldom appeared\nin public and seldom appeared in movies because he really was a little bit abnormal in his shorter\nthigh bone. And Bormann also was quite an adulterer. And Bormann had also made his wife into\nsuch a Nazi that she became estranged from her father and didn\u2019t speak to her father for decades.\nHad absolutely nothing more to do with her father; that was Walter Buch. And -- thanks to\nBormann. But that kind of gossip. But that had nothing to do with the trial, that merely gave us a\npicture. Now the Rorschach test then, gave us a complete characterization of the prisoners. First\nof all, the IQ. The highest IQ was Hjalmar Schacht, who was close to genius. Second highest\nArthur Seyss-Inquart. Third highest was Herman Goering. He was a very intelligent man. And\nthen it went down on the line, all the way to the lowest IQ, was Julius Streicher with 106. And so\nthat -- that -- that was an interesting statistic. Racial attitudes, Rosenberg, for instance, who was a\n-- a latvi -- you know, born in the Balkans -- in -- in Baltics.",
        "Q: Baltics [indecipherable]",
        "A: You\u2019re not -- he was not a German. Hess was born in Egypt, and never came to Germany til\nhe was 15 years of old -- of age. Hitler, to Hess, was a father image. Hess, we learned -- this is\nthe Rorschach test now, nobody told us these things, Hess was a man who was completely\ndependent on somebody else, he was not a man of his own, not a leader certainly, a follower.\nAlways a good second in command, as long as somebody else told him what to do, he -- he was -\n- he was effective as a flunkie. Keitel was in the same kind of a personality. No leader, but -- but\na -- a-- a good follower. Hess was a flake, physically. He had every ail -- ailment. If he read an\narticle about some disease, he ended up having it. He saw every doctor, every quack in Germany\nabout all the different ailments he had. He took more pills, more medicines during his life -- he\u2019s\na vegetarian. When he was invited to dinner with Hitler he brought his own food, until Hitler\nfinally forbade it, and wouldn\u2019t allow it any more because Hess, when I invite you to dinner, you\neat the food I -- Hitler was a vegetarian too, but Hess was more of a vegetarian than Hitler, so he\nbrought his own meal, his own food to a dinner at Hitler\u2019s home. Well, that kind of information\nall revealed itself in the course of the Rorschach test. Hess saw things in -- in the inkblots that\nother people never saw. He -- he saw blood where somebody else saw valentines. He -- it was all\nvery fascinating. Rosenberg -- I had a copy of Rosenberg\u2019s book out of the prison library. His\nmyth [indecipherable] the myth of -- \u201cMyth of the Twentieth Century.\u201d Not the mythos, mythis. I\nwanted him to autograph it for me, and I asked him to autograph it for me, and I -- this is one of\nthose memories -- memorable moments that stick out. And he grabbed the book and actually put\nit behind his back, and says, \u201cI can\u2019t let you have this.\u201d Well, this is very amusing, and I said,\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, because when I wrote this book, I was looking for a new faith, a\nnew belief, and I found it in writing the book. And I\u2019m afraid if you read this book -- and I found\nout that you\u2019re a good American officer, and you\u2019re a good Christian. You\u2019 ll read my book and\nyou'll give up your faith and you\u2019ll give up your spirit of democracy, and you\u2019ll accept my\nconcepts of -- of the world, and Pll have that on my conscience.\u201d Which -- thinking pretty much\nof his book. But I promised that I would never read it, 1f he would just autograph it I\u2019d have it as\na souvenir. So he did autograph it for me. He didn\u2019t inscribe it, just A. Rosenberg. I mentioned\nthis to Hess. I asked Hess if he had ever written a book. \u201cNo, why do you ask?\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWell, because I\u2019m collecting books with autographs and I thought if you had one, I would look\nfor it, and get your autograph.\u201d And I told him about Rosenberg. And his -- Hess said -- oh, I\u2019m\nsorry, not he -- not Hess, Schacht -- Schirach, the you -- the youth leader, said that Rosenberg\u2019s\nbook is the only bestseller that nobody has ever read, because it\u2019s a mish mosh of anti-\nCatholicism, anti-Christianity, anti-Semitism, anti everything that\u2019s decent [indecipherable]\nrespect. So that was von Schirach\u2019s answer to that particular incident. He had never written a\nbook either, Schirach.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something, where did you -- wha -- why did you get this idea of asking people\nfor autographs, did you have a --",
        "A: Yeah, th-tha -- there was a reason -- there was a reason for that. I came through Rass on the\nday Jodl signed a surrender document, and -- surrendering unconditionally, and his signature was\nstrictly Jodl, J-o-d-l. And then under that, Generaloberst. That was all. But someone who was\nthere, an at -- an historian, Colonel Hale, University of Virginia, mentioned this to me, and I\nthought, gee that\u2019s -- you know, I could have stopped in Rass and I could have seen Jodl.\nImagine -- I would have liked to have a -- see what the guy looked like. This is before\nLuxembourg, so I didn\u2019t know I was going to end up in Luxembourg and actually live in the\nsame building with Jodl for -- for months. So when Jodl showed up in Luxembourg and\neverything, I thought, well here\u2019s -- I -- I'll get his autograph. So I went to Jodl with a three by\nfive card, and I asked him if he would sign this for me, like he signed the surrender. And her\naccommodated me, Jodl, Generaloberst. Then it occurred to me that I -- I had Jodl\u2019s, and I\nshould have Keitel\u2019s, who signed the surrender on the eastern front, then I would have two. And\nI had visions I\u2019d frame it, have -- these are the signatures that appeared on the surrender that\nended the war. So I got Keitel\u2019s. Well, apparently Keitel or Jodl told some of the other prisoners\nthat I had asked them for an autograph. I don\u2019t know why -- because when we were getting ready\nto move them from Luxembourg to Nuremberg, five or six of them came to me and said they\u2019d\nlike to give me their autograph. Doenitz was one of them. So they gave me their autograph on a\npiece of paper, and so forth. So I became known as an autograph collector, and I really didn\u2019t\nhave that in mind at all. When I was sent [indecipherable] my commanding officer was Colonel\nPhelp, and on the occasion one time was having lunch with Colonel Phelp, and I told him about\nthis. I said, \u201cWould you want to see the names of the -- the guys who signed the surrender\ndocument?\u201d And I showed them to Colonel Phelp. He says, \u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cthat gives me an\nidea.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get me the signatures of all those guys when you go to\nNuremberg, next time you go to Nuremberg? Get all their signatures and their photographs.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cI\u2019Il make up a scrapbook, I\u2019m going to give it to Eisenhower.\u201d A scrapbook, a\npicture of each one of the high ranking Nazis and their autographs. And I said okay, and that\ngave me an idea, I thought, well in that case, I\u2019ll get two autographs, I\u2019ll keep one for myself,\nand I\u2019Il have a complete collection. So that was my idea. So that was my -- when I went to\nNuremberg then to get -- to -- to talk to Ley about his master plan for the reconstruction of\nGermany, I had autographs in mind. And I willingly got them, at least half a dozen others, but\nsome refused to sign. Hess, for instance, refused to sign his. So I made up a certificate,\nmimeographed, [speaks German here]. I certify herewith that this is my official signature. Then I\nwent to them, I said, you know, in relation to documents in a trial, we want to have your official\nsignature on record. And I got their autographs, two copies; one for me and one for the -- the\nscrapbook for General Eisenhower. The sequel to that is that I had this collection, my own. I\ndidn\u2019t have any photographs, we weren\u2019t allowed to take pictures. But I met a Navy officer, a\nNavy officer in Nuremberg, American, and -- in the Panther Pit, that\u2019s the bar at the Grand Hotel\nwhere a lot of us were billeted. And we happened to sit at the bar together and I said, you know,\nwhat\u2019s the Navy doing in Nuremberg? You know, there are no Navy ships here, and -- and he\nsaid well he\u2019d been -- he was naval intelligence, and he was assigned to -- in the photo --\nbusiness of photo intelligence, identification of documents and so forth. And he said, you know,\nfunny thing, Hitler\u2019s official photographer was just brought in a couple of days ago, and he had a\nwhole suitcase full of pictures of all the -- the high ranking Nazis and where they lived and all\nthat kind of stuff. So here was my boy, and I told him that I was trying to get some photographs,\ncould he -- he get me some copies. So he very obligingly made copies of some of the\nphotographs of all of the -- the Nazis that were in -- in Hoffman, the photographer\u2019s collection.\nHe gave them to me. I mean, we met a few days later, I got copy. So I had photographs and --\nand autographs and I gave a set to Colonel Phelp. There\u2019s a sequel to that, very recent one. I told\nyou earlier, I was not a souvenir collector, and there was a time a few years ago when -- when it\nwas just -- at least in my part of the world, where having Nazi souvenirs sort of made you stand\nout if you showed them to anybody, as a Nazi sympathizer. And I\u2019m thinking of Marge Schott,\nwho was even mentioned in the newspapers because she had a swastika armband -- in a negative\nway. None of my grandchildren were interested in any of this stuff, so I found somebody who\nwas interested, who said that he would give these to a museum connected with the Simon\nWiesenthal Center in California. And I gave them to him, the autographs and the pictures. Gave\nthem to him. A month ago I got a book in the mail, by a man named John K. Latimer, M.D.,\ndoctor, who was a doctor at Nuremberg, off and on. One of these guys who could -- I want to go\nsee what it\u2019s like at Nuremberg, so he went there, and he went to Nuremberg. And actually, as a\ndoctor, could interview some of the prisoners, which he did. And just a month ago, his book\ncame out, and the title of the book 1s, \u201cHitler\u2019s Fatal Disease, and Other Anecdotes.\u201d He knew\nme, because I had interpreted for him a couple of times. So it\u2019s inscribed to -- he read my book,\ninscribed to Ambassador Dolibois and in parentheses, our Lieutenant Gillen from Nuremberg.\nAnd he wrote this book, it just came out a month ago, and he sent me a complimentary copy,\ncause he had read my book, and reminded me, in a letter that I sent to him thanking him, I said,\n\u201cHow did you get my name?\u201d And he said, \u201cAbout five years ago I wrote to you about your book\nand you sent me a complimentary copy and I\u2019m returning the favor.\u201d And I\u2019d completely -- I\ndon\u2019t remember it at all. I had sent him a copy of my book with my autograph, because we met\nas a-- a -- a fellow -- a colleague or something, a fellow Nuremberger, cause I had interpreted\nfor him. Now his book comes out, on \u201cHitler\u2019s Fatal Disease,\u201d explaining why Hitler did the\nthings he did and also some stories about some of the others. Some of the stories based on my\nbook. And he credits me, he -- he does say, according to Lieutenant Dolibois, or Lieutenant\nGillen at that point, so and so said what. And then accompanying each one of these articles was\ntheir photograph and their autograph. So I wrote to him, and I said where did you get those\npictures, because some of the ata -- autograph have my own handwriting on them, where I write\nthe -- the titles in, like generale fieldmarshall Keitel. And he said he bought them from a\ncollector, he didn\u2019t remember his name, but he paid a pretty good price for them. So my\nphotograph collection, and autographs are in the possession of Dr. John K. Latimer, who is a\nmedical doctor and has written a book about Hitler\u2019s fatal disease. Do you know what the fatal\ndisease 1s?",
        "Q: Tell me. Tell me.",
        "A: Parkinson\u2019s disease. Hitler had Parkinson\u2019s disease, and this man analyzes this based on what\nother doctors who had interviewed Hitler, or people whom he interviewed who knew Hitler, and\na series of photographs in the book, which is a feature. Toward the end of his years, every\nphotograph you see of Hitler, he is either clasping his belt with his left hand, or has his left hand\nin his pocket, or is -- is holding an umbrella or a staff or cane or something 1n his left hand, to\nprevent his showing the -- the Parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms. And this Dr. Latimer has\nconcluded on the basis -- on the interviews, and his medical observation and other tests, that\nHitler suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and many of the decisions that Hitler made, like the\ninvasion of the Soviet Union, were due to the fact that he knew he didn\u2019t much time left before\nhis disease would be publicly known and he would lose his effectiveness with the German\npeople, and he would no longer be able to fulfill all of his dreams. So he made many fatal\ndecisions based on the knowledge that he -- that he had a fatal disease of which he was going to\ndie. And that\u2019s the title of this book, just came out a month ago. \u201cHitler\u2019s Fatal Disease, and\nOther Anecdotes,\u201d or stories about other Nazis. And my pictures are in there.",
        "Q: But how did he get these photographs if you donated the --",
        "A: He bought them from a collector. And the --",
        "Q: But you donated them to the ba -- the Wiesenthal Center.",
        "A: I gave them to an individual who was going to give them to the Wiesenthal Center.",
        "Q: I see, right, so he lied to you.",
        "A: I sold my epaulets to that same individual, and for that I got paid, but he didn\u2019t say anything\nthat he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t say anything about selling the photographs. All he said was I\u2019m going\nto give these to the museum at the Wiesenthal Center. And he had --",
        "Q: And the epaulet was from Goering?",
        "A: The epaulets were Goering\u2019s epaulet --",
        "Q: Goering\u2019s, right.",
        "A: -- which Goering gave to me.",
        "Q: Right. Okay.",
        "A: But that\u2019s what happened to autographs.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s stop this tape.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: Okay. I\u2019m going to ask you a bunch of questions that are not necessarily in order --",
        "A: Fine.",
        "Q: -- since you\u2019ve been so good chronologically, but I thought I would like to get some\nimpressions from you. You told the story about a woman spy in your book, a woman named Gail\nWichell?",
        "A: Vitchell, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Vitchell. And how she got --",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: -- sa -- it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s sort of funny in a [indecipherable] a little bit. She\u2019s the only woman --",
        "A: Yup, yup.",
        "Q: -- in the story, so I thought maybe it would be interesting for you to retell that.",
        "A: Yeah, that -- there was several other women in the story, but very -- very briefly, one of them\nbeing Jodl\u2019s wife --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- and -- that I -- that I mentioned, and Streicher\u2019s wife --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- Adele. But this Guyon Vitchell was -- she was a professional spy. And she apparently had\nsome relationship, whether a love -- whether it was a love relationship, but she knew one of the\ngenerals that we had in a prison da -- now we had in Nuremberg -- this is in Nuremberg now, not\nin Luxembourg, we didn\u2019t have any women in Luxembourg, but in Nuremberg, the top floor, one\nside of the top floor of the prison where all the Nazis were kept was reserved for women. And\nHimmler\u2019s -- Himmler\u2019s secretary, and Ribbentrop\u2019s secretary were among the prisoners, mostly\nas witnesses, not because they were charged with any crimes, or intended to be. And this Vitchell\napparently, I don\u2019t know why she was taken prisoner, cause there were a lot of spies, and -- and\nsome of them we even knew about. But this one, I think because she had the connection with this\ngeneral -- and we thought that was the -- the spy on the higher rank, because the relationship --\nand they were exchanging notes with each other. And we -- our curiosity was aroused by how --\nhow she could write a note and end up -- ends up in his cell. So obviously one of our guards was\ndelivering messages from one prisoner to another. And that was strictly verboten, that wa -- that\nwas not allowed at all. So this was one of my functions, that -- that Colonel Andrews delegated\nto me when I became his special assistant. So I was to find out how this note business was going\nabout. And wi -- the -- the whole incident was that I -- I went -- went to her cell, naturally. And\nthe guards were not allowed in the cells at all. They were -- they had to stand outside the cell.\nAnd up at that section I think was one guard for the whole corridor, we only had five or six\nwomen prisoners. But I noticed that Vitchell, who was a rather striking looking woman, and\nwhen -- when I entered, she was dressed in a robe that came all the way to her feet. And -- which\nI thought was unusual prison garb, but they weren\u2019t really being held as -- as criminals, so I\ndidn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. But I was asking her questions, and I forget how the sequel\nwent, because I didn\u2019t attach that much importance to it, but I did notice that she had a good\nstack of American cigaret -- cigarettes brand -- American brand cigarettes, loosely, not in a pack,\nbut 1-in a tray on her table in -- in the prison. And in the course of questioning, she -- I asked her\nwhere she got those cigarettes and she had no hesitancy at all in answering by just opening her\nrobe. And I found out she was abs -- absolutely stark naked underneath the robe. Which was\nunusual prison garb also. And then I put two and two together and I said, \u201cLet me see if I have\nthis figured right. You get those cigarettes,\u201d because they were not prison issue, \u201cyou get those\ncigarettes from the guard. And you give him peep show and he tosses in a cigarette,\u201d through the\nopening where we pass their food. And she said I had that absolutely right. Well, I don\u2019t know\nwhether the guard was listening on the outside, which I think he was, and there really wasn\u2019t\nanything I could do about it, and it really wasn\u2019t that much of an issue. But obviously one of the\nguards who was willing to carry the messages was giving extra cigarettes and doing her that\nfavor, which -- it struck my sense of humor. I don\u2019t think it was a criminal offense, I didn\u2019t want\nto -- but I knew if I reported this to Colonel Andrews, somebody would end up in the -- in the\nbrig, and somebody would be severely punished. So I -- I had a little fun, I came out of the cell,\nand the guard was standing in there, and just by looking at him, I could tell that he -- he knew\nwhat I -- what the conversation was, cause he\u2019s all red in the face, and -- and being extra polite\nand standing at rigid attention, almost like a statue. So I just went up to him right face to face and\nlooked at him and said, if you won\u2019t tell, I won\u2019t tell, or something to that effect, and walked\naway. And he said, \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d And he clicked his heels. And I became very popular with\nthe guards cause the word got around very quickly. But I reported this to Colonel Andrews, who\nhad no sense of humor at all. And Colonel Andrews would occasionally repeat the same story,\nbut he had it all mixed up. And he was giving a -- I think it was Ribbentrop\u2019s secretary or one of\n-- one of those people\u2019s secretaries\u2019 credit for being the -- the person that exposed herself. And\nthat particular person was extremely ugly, and -- and nobody would give up a cigarette to look at\nher in the nude or even dressed. So that made it good, but I never corrected the colonel cause he -\n- he enjoyed his story so much, but he did have it all screwed up. He had one other joke that he\nhad to tell every newcomer, saying that -- he said, hell, I always -- I thought -- I -- God\u2019s last\nname was damn. When he grew up he thought God\u2019s last name was damn, and that was an\nhilarious story, when he though -- he thought that was just great until he found out otherwise.\nBut he had no sense of humor, compared to Reichsmarshall Goering, who had a pretty good\nsense of humor.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]. Tell me why it was that you visited the wives -- I guess at least three, right?\nGoering\u2019s wife, Kesselring, and Selta. Why was it that you -- that you went --",
        "A: I -- I visited Kesselring and Selta\u2019s wife when I went to Tegernsee with Warlimont to get\nthose documents a -- I don\u2019t know if you want to go into that story, but it\u2019s kind of humorous and\ninteresting, too. But Warlimont -- mind you now, he\u2019s general of the artillery, a three star\ngeneral, came to me one day in Oberoszul and told me that he had a proposition, that he would\nlike to visit his wife and his children, he had three children, two daughters and a son, at\nTegernsee where -- where they lived on -- in Bavaria and that if I would take him there so he\ncould visit his family, he would in turn make available to me, all the minutes of all the meetings\nof the German general\u2019s staff, bound in volumes all the way back to 1792 or \u201932, when the\ngeneral\u2019s staff was founded. Not only that but he would also have some other books and\ndocuments, manuscripts, he\u2019d make them available to me, on the history of the German general\u2019s\nstaff. Well, that was extremely valuable, but the idea of my taking that prisoner to visit his family\nwas just so ridiculous that I had repeat it as a joke to my commanding officer, I said to him,\n\u201cColonel, you -- you won\u2019t believe this,\u201d and -- and I told him. And he thought it over, and he\nsmiled a little bit, and made no other comment. But the next day he called me in and said he had\nbeen thinking it over, and that I ought to just go ahead and take Warlimont, but we just keep\nquiet about it. We wouldn\u2019t make this an o-official record, he would just give me the travel\norders, by order of the commanding officer, and authorize me to go to Tegernsee, and be\naccompanied by PW W. Warlimont. But we wouldn\u2019t talk to anybody about it, because we --\nobviously wasn\u2019t going to be allowed by anyone higher up. So I arranged a week later to take\nWarlimont on a tour in a Jeep and I had my 45 caliber gun, and he was dressed in civilian clothes\nanyway, because he was no longer active in the army when he surrendered to us. No problem,\nbut I passed him off as my interpreter and my driver. The first problem we had was when we\nstopped in Stuttgart at a military mess to get lunch. And the mess sergeant of course saw my\norders, which I presented to him, and sure enough sir, you can eat and all the courtesy and\neverything else, he said, but the Kraut isn\u2019t going to get any food. And I had convinced the\nsergeant that the Kraut was a pretty nice guy and he was my interpreter and give him a big sales\ntalk and finally the sergeant relented and allowed the Kraut to get some food in the kitchen, but I\nheard him give a -- General Warlimont orders about washing his mess kit afterwards and\ncleaning it -- cleaning up after him, and he used a four -- a few selective phrases. I wondered\nwhat he would have done if he had known he was talking to a three star German general,\nordering him to wash his own mess kit. Well, that story became interesting as we got to\nTegernsee. It seemed that Warlimont lived right next door to his in-laws. His wife\u2019s mother and\nfather, his ma -- wife\u2019s father was an opera singer, and the wife\u2019s mother was a native American,\nhad been born in United States, related to the Anheuser-Busch family, a distant relative of the\nAnheuser-Busch family. And he had met their daughter in the United States. He wa -- the opera\nsinger Baron von Cleidorf was his name, had tour -- was touring the United States when he met\nthis girl, whom he then married in 1903, and they had a daughter, and that daughter became the\nwife of General Warlimont. So now Baron and Baroness von Cleid -- Cleidorf lived next door to\nthe Warlimonts. I stayed with them, and the general stayed with his wife and his three children.\nThey had a very happy family reunion. And we visited for three days and during that visit -- I\nthen took off in my Jeep and went to visit Kesselring\u2019s wife and Selta\u2019s wife, and brought them\nnews. They had not heard of their husbands, where they were, if they were even alive. So I was\nreally the harbinger of joy. And as a result of that visit, as a gift to me in the course of\nconversation, they developed an interest in my family. And I pointed out that I had a little son at\nhome, and so I ended up with a pair of lederhosen as a special gift from Mrs. Selta for my son.\nAnd those are authentic lederhosen, they\u2019re the real McCoy. So I was very proud and happy to\nhave them. But it was on that occasion I visited those two wives. And --",
        "Q: But -- go ahead.",
        "A: Go ahead, yeah.",
        "Q: No, no, go ahead.",
        "A: No. Well, the -- the whole purpose of that visit -- and that was fully understood -- in fact, I\nhad orders. Remember, there was a non-fraternization law, and American personnel were not\npermitted to fraternize with Germans. You could get in real trouble just by seeing -- seeing -- by\nbeing seen talking to a German. So I had a special set of orders, as to -- that I was a member of\nmilitary intelligence, and was authorized to enter German homes, and also authorized to\ninterrogate, investigate whatever mission I\u2019d -- I decided on. But I had official authorization.\nAnd this was on my -- on my orders, which I always carried with me, because like an instance,\nlike if anybody, military police had seen me going into a German home, I could have gotten in\nreal trouble if I wasn\u2019t authorized. Course, there was a lot of fraternization going on throughout\nGermany, but it was one of those rules that was a little bit ridiculous because in my\n[indecipherable] here was our opportunity with an army of occupation to really do some\nbrainwashing of the Germans, and convince them that our system is far superior to the Nazi\nsystem. And we could have organized the German youth into basketball teams and soccer teams\nand football teams and tell them about American sportsmanship. Instead, we weren\u2019t allowed to\ntalk to them, which to me seemed a little silly. We -- we missed a wonderful opportunity, which\nwas reversed when the Marshall plan went into effect and we then did what we should have done\nimmediately after the war. But this fraternization policy was ridiculous. One more secret to the\nstory of Warlimont is that on our way home -- and I did get the documents. And I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to all of the documents, but I do know that years later I purchased a book from\nmy library written by John Wheeler Bennett, which was the -- the mc -- \u201cNemesis of Power; A\nHistory of the German General\u2019s Staff.\u201d And I know that a lot of the research and documentation\nthat appeared in John Wheeler Bennett\u2019s book had to come from the documents that we\nrecovered through General Warlimont on this visit -- il-illegal visit to his family. On the way\nhome I didn\u2019t travel the Autobahn, I took the side roads, because just in case of an accident or\nsomething, I still would have trouble explaining what I was doing traveling with a three star\nGerman general who was really a prisoner of war. So I took the side roads pretty much. And we\nwere right near the Bavarian headquarters of General Patton, who had been appointed the\nmilitary governor of Bavaria. And we were traveling along this somewhat isolated country road,\nheading back toward Oberoszul when there was a commotion ahead of us, and obviously some\nkind of a traffic disturbance. And I pulled my Jeep over to side of the road and got out and stood\nby the road to see what was coming my way, and when they reached me with the sirens going, it\nwas a Jeep with a flasher and siren, full blast, and then a staff car with license plate and four\nstars. And in the back seat was no less a person than General Patton and his dog. And of course I\nthrew a fancy salute and General Patton acknowledged it by raising his riding crop, which he had\nin his hand, and passed on. And a fantastic thought that occurred to me was that if I had only had\nenough nerve to stop the -- that particular convoy, and introduced General Patton to the German\ngeneral, who had arranged all of the offensive and defensive maneuvers, including the invasion\nof Normandy, and say, \u201cThis is the guy who tried to stop you, general. And this general is the\nman who -- whom you couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d It would have been quite a meeting, but I would have had\nan awful time explaining what I was doing illegally with -- traveling with this important PW. So\nthat was the whole story of that. Visiting Mrs. Goering was part of the same scheme, th-the\nagreement was -- and our military intelligence was that any way we could gather information be\nuseful, and visiting their families was not only a gesture that opened up and loosened tongues,\nbut it also gave us a chance to get another viewpoint as I -- I mentioned earlier. So I went to --\nwent to visit Mrs. Goering. The housekeeper answered the door and saw my American uniform\nand all but slammed the door in my face, she would have nothing to do with me. So I went back\nand I told Goering that I tried to see his wife. He knew that -- where I was going, I said I\u2019m -- I\nwas going on a trip and I was coming near where his wife was. I think was one of the -- one of\nthe chateaus that had once belonged to him, she was living in part of it. He then gave me a -- a\npicture of himself and Emmy and their little daughter Edda, and wrote on the back of it that\nOberloitman Gillen has my confidence and -- and trust, and signed Hermann Goering, and the\ndate, August eighth, I remember, 1945. It was August -- yeah, I think it\u2019s August eighth.\nAnyhow, I went back there several weeks later on another business trip and stopped there, and\nthis time I showed the housekeeper the photo and she took it into Mrs. [indecipherable] Miss\n[indecipherable] -- Mrs. Goering, and she herself came to the door and invited me in. I only\nstayed a few minutes, just small talk and -- and talking to her a little bit. I promised that I would\ncome back, because I had someone else in the car with me as I recall, and I didn\u2019t want to make\ntoo much of a -- a visit out of it, other than my just delivering a letter, and so I promised to come\nback. And I went back again a couple of weeks later with a letter to the little girl from her father.\nAnd Mrs. Goering was in prison, she\u2019d been arrested by military government -- government for\nthe art treasures, and she certainly was involved in s-some of that art confiscation. And the little\ngirl was in a children\u2019s home. So I went to visit her and actually held her on my lap and read her\nfather\u2019s letter to her, which was a kind of an emotional experience that I wasn\u2019t soliciting. But\nthat was the occasion of -- of that partis -- personal visit. Others were -- wives visiting\nNuremberg during the time that I was working for Colonel Andrews directly, as sort of an\nassistant prison public relations officer. And when they had visitors like that, I know Mrs. Jodl\ncame, and Streicher\u2019s wife, and oh, two or three others that -- oh, von Ribbentrop\u2019s wife, who\nincidentally is a very ugly woman, personally di -- but she was a -- an heir to the Henkle\nchampagne people. In this case -- and he was a salesman for the champagne line, I think it was\nHenkle [indecipherable] Henkle or one of the others. Anyhow, he married the boss\u2019s daughter\nand this is how he -- how he got ahead. Von Ribbentrop, incidentally, I don\u2019t know if you knew\nthat he was not really a von. No, he -- h-he was born Ribbentrop, but there was an aunt who was\nmarried -- his mother\u2019s sister who was married to von Ribbentrop -- the other way around,\nbrother, who was knighted, and he had the right to the title von Ribbentrop. And at age 32, von\nRibbentrop himself, the foreign minister, Joachim, arranged for his aunt, Mrs. von Ribbentrop to\nadopt him at age 32, so that he would become Joachim von Ribbentrop. Which helped him\ntremendously because it helped sell him to Hitler, who was impressed by the von idea, plus the\nfact that von Ribbentrop could speak English and -- and other things. But she was another one\nwho came to visit in a relationship with families.",
        "Q: I-I -- I understand that justice Jackson came and gave a seminar [indecipherable] international\nmilitary tribune -- was this in Mondorf?",
        "A: In Nuremberg.",
        "Q: In Nuremberg.",
        "A: No this is -- by the time the trials were ready to begin.",
        "Q: So he gave the seminar to whom?",
        "A: To the staff, the American officers who were assigned, both the guard element and people like\nme, a-and the prison psychiatrist and anybody else involved in the trial procedure. There were\nthe -- the -- there was a tremendous judicial staff, lawyers and -- and others who were acting as\nthe -- well, assistants to the prosecuting staff. The prosecuting staff had, I think -- well, Colonel\nAmon was the deputy to Justice Jackson, Telford Taylor were the only two I ever had any\nrelationship with. I -- I interpreted for Amon on a few occasions, particularly the Ley episode\nwhere Ley was presenting his master plan, and -- and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m the one who took -- I took Ley\u2019s\ndocument to Colonel Amon and then he and Jackson ruled on insignificance of it and ordered me\nto -- to tell Ley that it wasn\u2019t any good. So Amon and -- and Telford Taylor are the only two I\nhad any connections with. Justice Jackson decided he could give a talk, a seminar to all of the\npeople connected with the prison. And the purpose of the seminar was to explain the\ninternational tribunal, because again, none of us knew what we were really doing -- what this\nwas all about, why we were having a tribunal and who was going to participate. The organization\nof the tribunal. The fact that we were having four judges and assistant judges from each of the\nmajor nations participating. And the prosecuting staff of each of the four nations. And the\nconduct of the whole trial, and -- and what we were doing. And even the -- the redesign -- not th\n-- the rebuilding of the Palace of Justice, which had been heavily bombed. And we had SS men\nwho were doing the hard labor on -- who -- building the tribunal room, which was ironic again, I\nthought, because their high ranking leaders were going to be tried in the courtroom that they\nwere repairing, in the building that they were reconstructing for this purpose. So Jackson\u2019s\npurpose was to explain this to us, and that was the first detailed account I ever received, the only\none for that matter, of what the purpose of the trial was, and what we were doing and had been\ndoing and why -- why we had been doing it. And I was quite impressed with Justice Jackson, I\nthought he was quite a -- an outstanding person.",
        "Q: And what did you think of his explanation?",
        "A: Well, I had my own questions about it, but again, that\u2019s from the standpoint of a then 27 year\nold, rather naive person. Question number one was, we had Soviet judges sitting at trial, for the\nkind of crimes that the Soviet Union had also committed. Somehow here is the kettle calling the\npot black, you know. And I knew that if I were preparing a defense and it were allowed, I would\ncertainly raise that question in a courtroom. You know, you are accusing us and finding us guilty\nof crimes that one of the judges up here represents a country which committed the same crimes.\nThat of course, was one of the first questions. Next question was strictly out of naivet\u00e9. The\nmoral position we were taking on the dropping of the atom bombs, for instance. While I, even to\nthis day say I think we did the right thing in dropping it, but from the standpoint of civilians\nbeing killed who really were not involved, and we were killing civilians too, weren\u2019t we, with\nthat bomb? I\u2019d say do it again if we had to under the same circumstances, but it still raised the\nquestion in my mind. It also made me think again about the very serious questions that Goering\nhimself, and Doenitz, and two or three other of the more intelligent of the high ranking personnel\nthat we had in captivity raised. They said -- not a question, but prediction they made, the day will\ncome when you wish Germany were on yo -- were on your side and helping you against the\nSoviet Union. That was only a year before the Cold War broke out. Their prediction was true.\nBillions that we have spent in creating a bulwark between western democracy and Soviet\ncommunism [indecipherable] Germany. And what we did in building up the -- the Marshall plan\nto begin with, in rebuilding Germany, to the point where I\u2019ve asked myself, who won the war?\nAnd that question certainly came up in this discussion. So while it was very informative from the\nstandpoint of the mechanics, from the standpoint of the philosophy of the trials, I had to ask\nmyself that question -- those questions. That was my -- not a reply to Jackson cause I wouldn\u2019t\ndare have stood up and asked those questions, but they came to mind, where th -- I still maintain\nto this day that the trial was fair, 1t was justice, I\u2019m proud to have been a part of it, and my only\nconcern now is as -- as I\u2019m approach old age, is the imitation of the Nuremberg trials that\u2019s\ngoing on around the world. And I think they take away from what the Nuremberg trials really\ntried to accomplish; that is to make it illegal to invade another country and enslave its people. To\nmake crimes against the peace, violation of treaties and non-aggression pacts an international\ncrime. To punish those who -- who practice crimes against humanity. Thou shalt not kill.\nNothing original about that, that goes back thousands of years, thou shalt not kill. And people\nwho do kill, whether they do it on behalf of their government or not, should be tried and\npunished. And thirdly, if you have an agreement on how to conduct a war, war crimes, define\nwhat the rules are, and if you break those rules, you\u2019re guilty of war crimes. Don\u2019t mix apples\nand oranges. Don\u2019t mix crimes against humanity with war crimes or crimes against the peace.\nAnd these imitation international tribunals going on now in certain places, are -- th-they\u2019re not\nreal, they\u2019re imitations. They\u2019re not the real thing. They don\u2019t have the same objective, they\ndon\u2019t have the same basis for operation, or for being. And we\u2019re -- we\u2019re opening doors there we\nmight be sorry about someday. And --",
        "Q: Why do you call them imita -- in what sense are they 1m -- imitate --",
        "A: The ha -- well, The Hague, the international --",
        "Q: No, I understand what -- to what you\u2019re referring, but why are you calling them an 1m --\nimitation, and clearly you think they\u2019re a pale imitation, so why?",
        "A: Well, bec -- because they are taking an individual Serb, who is responsible for 12 women\nbeing raped, and they\u2019re saying he committed the war crime. But there\u2019s never been a war\ndeclared. There -- there\u2019s never been -- the war crimes don\u2019t apply in that particular case. It\u2019s a\ncrime against humanity. It\u2019s a violation of -- of a -- a law. Rape is immoral, it\u2019s illegal, it\u2019s\nwrong. That man should be punished for rape. He shouldn\u2019t be punished for a war crime. That --",
        "Q: Are you saying that in Bosnia there was no war? There was a war.",
        "A: Yeah, there w -- there was a war, but who established it to be a war? The Croats were fighting\nwith the Germans against the Serbs, who were on our side in World War II, right? I mean, the\nSerbs were on the American side. The Croats and the Muslims were on the German side.",
        "Q: Well, the mu --",
        "A: Yeah. And they committed crimes against the Serbs, crimes against humanity. I mean, they --\nthey did the Nazi\u2019s bidding in Yugoslavia, and they committed crimes that were quite\nhorrendous. Now the tables are turned, Tito is gone and Milosevic comes into power. Now\nMilosevic is committing the same crimes that the s -- that the Croats and the Muslims committed\nagainst him. Now which one of them is the war criminal? They both committed the same crimes.",
        "Q: But you -- you\u2019re -- you\u2019re talking about two different time periods. You can\u2019t only say that\nWorld War II is the only time that war crimes or crimes against humanity have been committed.",
        "A: No, I -- I maintain that an international tribunal --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- ought to be an international court -- it ought to be established the same way the Nuremberg\ntrials were established. I don\u2019t think that any nation can suddenly say we\u2019re going to have an\ninternational trial and -- and set it up -- it won\u2019t work -- it --",
        "Q: Do you think there should be a permanent international tribunal?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t.",
        "A: I -- I really -- because it -- it can get out of hand, like The Hague is going to get out of hand.\nYou know who is going to be tried next? The United States. For war crimes. You know -- you\nremember the North Korean -- the South Koreans, 300 of them, civilians who were massacred by\nAmerican troops, who were told that North Koreans are invading and were under the impression\nthat under that bridge were North Koreans who were pretending to be South Koreans, and so\nthey killed them. And there are -- now people are saying that was a war crime. The Americans\nkilled those innocent civilians. When we invaded Panama to capture Noriega, some civilians\nwere killed. We hadn\u2019t declared war on Panama. We just invaded Panama to catch Noriega. And\nwe killed some civilians. There are now Panamanians who want restitution, and they want the\nUnited States to be tried for war crimes, because we invaded their country and killed civilians.",
        "Q: But you certainly wouldn\u2019t maintain that en -- if there is such a thing as a war crime --",
        "A: It should be punished --",
        "Q: It should be punished --",
        "A: -- oh by -- oh yeah, oh -- oh -- oh, no, I do -- I\u2019m sorry, I gave that im -- no, no --",
        "Q: -- it should -- no, no, I\u2019m sure that you would --",
        "A: -- | -- I\u2019m saying -- all I\u2019m saying is it should be on a sound foundation. I feel that the\nNuremberg international war crimes tribunal, which was signed by 23 nations who had been very\ndirectly, and some indirectly involved --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and suffered by the Nazi regime, and they signed an accord, an agreement, an authorization,\nthat a trial should be established, and these people should be indicted for crimes against the\npeace, war crimes, crimes against humanity. Admitting that the crimes against the peace charge\nis -- was novel at the time, because it -- it had not yet been established that violation of a treaty\nwas an international crime. It takes a court process --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- to make that into law, so that was necessary. And there wasn\u2019t a country in the world which\nobjected to the international tribunal at Nuremberg, but how many people are objecting to what\u2019s\ngoing on in The Hague, or even in Geneva, or in some of these other international cour -- you\ndon\u2019t have a really international court if you don\u2019t have the agreement of the international\ncommunity in support of it. Now that -- that\u2019s my whole point. So when these people say -- and\nthis is largely in the media, the -- the trials in The Hague where so and so from Serbia is going to\nbe tried for war crimes, similar to the war crimes committed by the Nazis in Nuremberg, I think\nit takes away from the Nuremberg trials. It demeans them, because th -- it\u2019s not the same thing.\nThere\u2019s no comparison. Now, if -- who voted for the establishment of the inter -- international\ncriminal\u2019s court? United Nations. The majority vote of the members of the United Nations. All\nright. If you had a vote today against United States, do you think -- do you believe the majority\nof the members of the United Nations would vote for, or -- in support of or against the United\nStates?",
        "Q: I have no idea.",
        "A: Well, I have the feeling we don\u2019t have the support in the United Nations that we would need\nin order to objectively meet a tribunal of that court.",
        "Q: So let me go -- let me go back to the [indecipherable] Jackson for a second. Did anybody ask\nhim any questions? You didn\u2019t raise those questions with Justice Jackson?",
        "A: At that time?",
        "Q: At that time.",
        "A: Oh, no, no I wouldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did -- did everybody just sit there and ju -- they took what he said and [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah, well that\u2019s what I say, I -- I wouldn\u2019t have had the nerve. In fact, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m\ntalking in -- in hindsight now, you know, hindsight 1s --",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s very --",
        "A: -- and I -- I have a lot of hindsight at this point.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- a lot of points that I\u2019m making now, of course, I had no -- no reasons for raising back in\nthose days, and I was just a -- a kid listening to what was going on. But in my own mind, I did\nhave the questions that I had mentioned earlier, you know --",
        "Q: Now when you --",
        "A: -- what 1s the Soviet role in this, and -- and the rest of it.",
        "Q: -- when you sat in on some of the Nuremberg -- did you see the subsequent Nuremberg trials,\nor only the Nuremberg trials, the first trials?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: The major trials.",
        "A: The major trial, yeah.",
        "Q: The major trial.",
        "A: I was home by the time --",
        "Q: You were.",
        "A: -- actually, I -- I was home by the time the trials ended.",
        "Q: Ended.",
        "A: I -- I was just there the early part of 1946.",
        "Q: So given -- given that in many ways you were getting pieces of information, even though you\nwere interrogating all these top Nazis, you didn\u2019t have the whole picture.",
        "A: Oh no, no.",
        "Q: And you began to see it when you walked into these trials and listened [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, and I\u2019m still learning.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re still learning. It\u2019s a very complicated story.",
        "A: Yeah. There\u2019s still an awful lot that hasn\u2019t been revealed yet, and this is why I -- I\u2019m very\nsupportive of the efforts, for instance, of the Holocaust museum, and your oral history idea of\ngetting some of the story told. As I say, I do a lot of public speaking, and it depresses me when I\ntalk to young people who have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about high school and\ncollege students, and I mention names like Goering, Goebbels, Himmler, Streicher, Ley, and\nthey get a blank look on their face. You know, who is he talking about? Who are these people?\nAnd they don\u2019t know anything about the Nuremberg trials.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the minute you talk international war crimes tribunal to a great majority of the young\npeople, they\u2019re immediately talking about oh yeah, that -- that\u2019s in Bosnia, they\u2019re getting those\nSerbs for raping somebody, and that\u2019s what the international war crimes tribunal is about. And\nthat is my -- what I\u2019m saying. I -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a comparison. They\u2019re not in the same\nlevel, they\u2019re not the same operation. So I think it\u2019s important for survivors to tell their story. I\nthink it\u2019s important for anybody whose had a connection, even -- o-or maybe especially, this\nvery new idea that this Dr. Latimer brings out in a book just -- just out, that Hitler was a victim\nof Parkinson\u2019s disease. Not a victim of, but had Parkinson\u2019s disease, and that influenced many of\nthe decisions he made. I -- I think that\u2019s a -- an interesting line to follow and -- and pursue, yeah.",
        "Q: When -- when you think back on those months -- actually, it\u2019s more than months, it\u2019s more\nthan a year that you spent with these Nazis and doing interrogations.",
        "A: Yeah. All together, yeah, sure.",
        "Q: What effect do you think it had on you?",
        "A: On me personally?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve been asked that question before. It contributes substantially to, I think,\nmy maturity, to a certain amount of cynicism I have now. I just don\u2019t trust everybody just\nbecause he has a title. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he\u2019s always right. In fact, it taught me also\nthat no matter how important you are, you still put your pants on one leg at a time. And I\u2019ve seen\nmen whose faces were on the cover of Time magazine, and Life magazine, full blown, in color,\nwho begged me for an extra tube of toothpaste, or even a stick of chewing gum, or a pack of\ncigarettes. And they were four star generals. They were ministers and -- and heads of state. And\nso I -- when I then came into the -- the commercial world and started working for a living, I\ndidn\u2019t swoon when the corporate executive -- when I called on the corporate executive to ask for\na major contribution to the Miami University foundation, because, you know, I -- I actually had\nunder my control people who were much more important than he was. I don\u2019t mean by that to --\nto demean the person, but all I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s -- 1t stopped me from being in awe of everybody\nwho has a title, or a position. And in turn, it taught me to respect the person rather than the title.\nAnd that I could have more respect for a corporal than I could for a five star general, because\nI\u2019ve seen five star generals that I wouldn\u2019t promote to corporal.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: See what I mean?",
        "Q: Yes, I do.",
        "A: A-And tha -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the lesson I learned. Cynicism to a certain extent, yes. But maybe\nit\u2019s made me a better citizen. I question things I hear now. I just don\u2019t take anything for granted\nbecause it comes from high above.",
        "Q: Did it depress you about the human condition, about the capacity for human beings to be --",
        "A: Yes, yes, very much so. And I was just going to say, that\u2019s the other thing I -- I worry my\nwife because I -- I let news developments depress me, because I can see -- I can draw\ncomparisons. I can\u2019t help but feel -- and I\u2019ve been asked this question many times when -- when\nI was on [indecipherable], what is a typical Nazi? Blonde, blue-eyed Aryan, six feet tall? Mm-\nmm. The typical Nazis, if there is such a thing, and there is, in my book, I knew some. He could\nbe shorter than I am, he could be bald-headed. He could be fat, he could be skinny. He could be\nmistaken for an American if I met him on the street. There is no typical Nazi. You don\u2019t have to\nbe a German to be a Nazi.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You have to be a certain personality, a certain type to be a Nazi, and it\u2019s not a physical type.\nIt\u2019s a person who fits a -- a category that would -- wouldn\u2019t hesitate to shoot you if it benefited\nhim. Or wouldn\u2019t hesitate to sell out his children if there was some benefit for him. A person\nwithout character. And I mentioned to you the quotation from fieldmarshall Kesselring. That left\na tremendous impression on me, because I got so involved as a boy in the Boy Scouts, and the\nBoy Scouts of America is about building character. And that stuck with me, and here 1s a five\nstar general, a fieldmarshall -- a general fieldmarshall, who tells me -- now I\u2019m 27 years old, and\nalmost three times the age of the cub scout that I was, saying character is more important than\nanything else. More important than knowledge and ability. And I remember that as a Boy Scout,\nthat\u2019s what I was taught. Character, integrity, telling the truth, being honest. Treating other\npeople as you would like to be treated. That\u2019s all part of being character. When I see what\u2019s\nhappening, and I give talks and people say, Nazism can happen only in Germany. I say, \u201cYou\u2019re\nwrong, Nazism can happen here in the United States.\u201d We have neo-Nazis in the United States.\nHatred, racism. I can see things repe -- I can see patterns repeating themselves, because there are\npeople without character, who are doing the kind of things that the Nazis did in Germany. And\nthey\u2019re doing the kind of things that enable them to come to power. And I see patterns in our\ncountry repeating what -- exactly what happened in Germany, during the 20\u2019s and the 30\u2019s. A\nlack of interest in supporting education at the local level. In Germany during the 30\u2019s, let Berlin\ntake care of it. Let the government handle it. We don\u2019t want to support our local schools. So the\nlocal gover -- the national government takes over the school system, and they pay the teacher\u2019s\nsalaries, and they pay for the schools. And then they also tell them what to teach, and they teach\nonly Nazism. And you can\u2019t be a teacher in Germany during those days without belonging to the\nNational Socialist Teacher\u2019s Association. I get a little bit worried when everybody has to belong\nto the NEA in the United States before they can teach. That bothers me. Maybe no problem. I get\nworried when I see nobody wants to be a scoutmaster any more. Nobody wants to volunteer for\nthe YWCA, or the YMCA, or -- or the y-m-a -- y -- young men Hebrew asso -- the volunteer\ngroups. People aren\u2019t interested. So what happens? Let the government organize a youth\nprogram. Then you have a Hitler youth, and a Baldur von Schirach, who organizes the boys and\nthe girls, because the local leaders don\u2019t want to do it any more. A-And this -- you can keep on\nmultiplying this. If you get a media that all sings the same tune, I get very depressed. When the\nmedia becomes the voice for one party, who is going to speak for the other party? Whose going\nto express their viewpoint? The [indecipherable] publications in Germany released all the\ngovernment news, and it was only news when -- the news was only what the Nazis wanted you\nto read. And then you had the Voelkischer Beobachter, and the -- and the -- the Der Stuemer, and\nall the Nazi newspapers, telling you exactly what the news is, their government news outlets. If I\nfeel that all the news 1s controlled, and in support of only one concept, I draw a comparison, I\nworry a little bit. There are signs. I frankly worry about gun control. People say to me, why\ndidn\u2019t the Jews defend themselves? Why didn\u2019t the Jews organize? I mean, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re\nsmart. Not just the Jews, but the others too, minorities in other countries, 1n -- in Germany and\ncountries that they occupy. What\u2019s the first thing Hitler did when he came to power after the\nburning of the Reichstag? Guns were illegal, confiscate all the guns. And the Gestapo had the\nright to come knocking at your door and search your home to see if you own a gun. I\u2019m against\ngun control. I\u2019m for gun registration. I think everybody owns a gun, like a car, ought to register\nthat gun. If he has it legally, he shouldn\u2019t object to that. Waiting period is fine. Your picture on a\ngun license, that\u2019s fine with me. But don\u2019t take away my right to carry a weapon. We did that tha\n-- we -- they did that in Germany. Instead we say, why didn\u2019t the people up -- weren\u2019t they\norganize -- defend themselves? With what? Pocket knives? I think -- I interpret the Constitution\nand our founder\u2019s purpose along that particular line. Our founders, in creating the United States,\nand our Constitution were getting away from King George and the oppression, and the\ndictatorship of that royal family. And they created the revolution, and they -- they had their\nmilitia men, and their minute men, who defended themselves and we have a free country. What\nif we get a government that deprives us of all of our freedoms? How do we -- we\u2019ve -- how do\nwe organize a revolution in defense of our -- of free thinking and of free spirits? Well, that\u2019s\nwhat it did to me. It makes me think about those things that -- and it depresses me if I am\nwrongly, or rightfully, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m -- I\u2019m right, I could be all wrong, but it still\ndepresses me as I make the comparisons. That\u2019s a long answer to your question.",
        "Q: You did some interviewing of German citizens before you left to go to the United States?",
        "A: Yes. That was a very negative assignment. We had some of our officers -- this is during the\nnon-fraternization period. And some of our people in military intelligence -- high up military\nintelligence, ask themselves what can we do to win these people over? I mean, the war is over,\nbut the German people who -- they claim, look t -- to us as the liberators, those who were anti-\nHitler, but woke up to that fact much too late to do anything about it. By the time the German\npeople realized -- and I\u2019m not talking about an unknown quantity of German people, by the time\nthey realized they had lost any freedom, that they were now living under a very controlled\nmalignant dictatorship, it\u2019s too late to do anything about it, because the fear psychosis had been\nso firmly established. You know, parents couldn\u2019t talk about any ideas or about the government\nin their home, because the children would tell the teachers what their parents said about the\nHitler -- about the government, or whether they listened to BBC on the radio. And people were\nafraid to talk to their neighbors. The blocklighter might be listening. [speaks German here]. That\ncould also be taken the other way, the find -- the enemy could be the government. When people\nwoke up, it was much too late to do anything about that. So there are Germans who claimed,\nwhen the war was over, we look upon you Americans as having liberated us from this. But\ninstead of liberating us, you have subjected us to a fra -- non-fraternization policy, you won\u2019t\neven talk to us. Our schools are closed, and they been closed for -- for months. In the Soviet\nUnion, schools were opened a week after the war ended, with textbooks and everything already\nprinted. Schools in Germany, West Germany, in the American zone, and the British zone, didn\u2019t\nopen for nine months after the war ended. And when they did open, we used outdated textbooks\nand untrained teachers. We could have used a lot of those G.I.\u2019s who were fraternizing with\nGerman frauleins as schoolteachers, as youth organizers, to teach them something about\ndemocracy. But we didn\u2019t, we missed that opportunity. And some of the people, older than I and\nmore ma -- mature and wise, thought what did we do wrong, what are we doing wrong? Let\u2019s\nfind out. Let\u2019s get an opinion of -- of the people, let\u2019s get a -- a reaction. So secretly, four of us\nwere -- were selected. Selected only because we speak dialect. I -- I can speak the Zaar dialect\nbecause that\u2019s what we spoke at home, which is very much like the Luxembourg dialect. And we\nmingled among the German people, pretending to be German soldiers returning from PW camps,\nwe'd just been released. And we actually had German uniform and -- and we just sit in bus\nstations and we talk to people. And you know, I\u2019ve been a PW for the last two and a half years,\nand what\u2019s going on, you know, what\u2019s happening here? Wha -- what -- what happened in\nGermany? Why -- why is everything the way it is? Where did the -- the Third Reich fail? And\ngot their reactions. And what about the Americans? What do you think of them? And then we put\nall of that together in a report, and then my commanding officer was severely reprimanded,\nbecause it was critical of the -- of the way we were doing things in Germany after the war. And\nso they ordered all the copies of this report destroyed, and nothing ever came of it.",
        "Q: Did you keep a copy?",
        "A: Yeah. But it was only confidential, it wasn\u2019t top secret.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But I kept a copy of it, and I quote from it in my book. I mean, in my own quotes, my own\nopinion, because I brought it back from question. And we -- we talked to people who confessed,\nI was a Nazi, yes. Especially women, who continued to be very ardent Nazis and who gave their\nopinion very freely. They were pining for the day when German troops come goose-stepping\ndown the street again. And we thought that our authorities ought to know that there are people in\nGermany who think that way. And the higher ups who got our report said, oh, you know, you\ntrying to tell us that the Germans are still Nazis, or -- that isn\u2019t so, we -- we\u2019ve -- we\u2019ve liberated\nthem, we\u2019ve done away with them, and they aren\u2019t Nazis. Well, there are Nazis in Germany still.\nEven as a tourist you can -- I can -- I can ferret them out when I\u2019m traveling. I -- I remember --\noh, this is -- should be off the record, but we -- we had organized the Miami alumni tour for\ninstance, in Denmark [indecipherable] 1n Copenhagen. And -- a tour, and I was the -- the tour\nhost, my wife and I organized the Miami alumni tour. And we came in -- one of the people in our\ngroup, a very good friend of mine, a Miami alumna, elderly woman, had hurt her knee very\nbadly on the tour, she could hardly walk, she was in agony and pain. We came into this dining\nroom in this hotel where we were staying. Came off the elevator and my -- my lady friend\nimmediately went to the nearest table to the elevator and sat down, so she wouldn\u2019t have to walk\nwith her painful knee. And this headwaiter came storming across the dining room. And before he\neven opened his mouth I could tell he was German. He was not -- no -- and not a Dane, he was a\nGerman, and with a very German accent, in English, he just told our friend, our fellow traveler,\nthat she was not allowed to sit there, she had to go to the end of the dining room where this\nwhole group is all eating together. You can\u2019t sit here, we will not serve you if you sit here. And\nhe was just sounding so much like a Nazi, all I had to do was close my eyes and -- and -- and see\nthe SS insignia.

And that was it. He actually clicked his heels. He said yavollt,\nand he served my lady friend at that -- and her companions, and she -- served at that table. The\nrest of the group ate at the end of the dining room, but this part of our group ate at that table.\nWell, some of my friends couldn\u2019t get over that, said, \u201cHow did you know he was a Nazi?\u201d And\nI could just tell he -- and he was, he was -- I\u2019d swear he was a Nazi.

        "Q: My last question has to do with this incident that happened in 1986. This was after you had\ncompleted your assignment as ambassador to Luxembourg and President Reagan was going to\ngo to Bittburg, which caused a huge flurry, and he didn\u2019t change his plans. And you did\nsomething other, didn\u2019t you? So could you explain what you thought --",

        "Q: I thought it was \u201986.",
        "A: No, no, it\u2019s 1985, was the 40\" anniversary of the end of the war.",
        "Q: Oh no, you\u2019re right, yes.",
        "A: Yeah. And President Reagan was coming to Europe to commemorate the 40\" anniversary and\nalso to attend the summit meeting -- I forget in which one of the countries. And Germany -- I --\nHelmut Kohl in -- invited him to make an official state visit to Germany while he was in Europe.\nAnd Reagan accepted, and was going to Europe -- was going to Germany while he was in\nEurope for the summit conference, and it would be a state visit. Now, in a state visit, the -- the\nway it usually works is the ambassador of the host country and his counterpart in the United\nStates would get together and plan an agenda. And Helmut Kohl had requested of the German\nambassador to the United States that the president should accept an invitation for a state visit,\nand while there he ought to visit an American -- a -- a German military cemetery and lay a\nwreath to commemorate -- to -- to memorialize the -- the 40\" anniversary and to commemorate\nthe end of friction between Germany, a -- a gesture, a recognition of the bravery of those who\nfought, so forth, so forth. And Reagan, who was pretty easily ac -- accepting recommendation,\naccepted that he would -- he would do this. I was attending a birthday party for Arthur Burns,\nwho was our ambassador to Germany, and Arthur Burns told me that Reagan was coming to\nGermany for an official visit. And he thought that he shouldn\u2019t visit the German military\ncemetery, that would cause a lot of friction. Arthur Burns knew what the score was. And I agreed\nwith him. And then Arthur Burns said, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a counter-suggestion and have him\ncome to the American cemetery in Luxembourg instead?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you, Arthur?\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWe\u2019re both passing the buck.\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m the host ambassador and if I get\ninvolved it\u2019s really a violation of protocol. I -- I shouldn\u2019t do this, because I\u2019m -- I\u2019m supposed to\ngo along with what the host government wants,\u201d and so forth. So I stuck my neck out and I sent a\ncable, and that was a mistake. There is such a thing as a White House signal, and that is a direct\ntelephone line from an ambassador to a White House office, the president, vice president, and\nalso the secure -- national security advisor. And you use that for really important messages. And\nI should have been brave enough to use the White House signal, be the only time I would have --\nhave used it. You\u2019d use it 1f Luxembourg is planning to declare war on the United States or\nsomething like that. But I should have used it to call the president and tell him -- to invite him to\ncome to Luxembourg, my proposal being that the helicopter, which is at his disposal would come\nfrom Bittburg where he was making an official visit to the military -- that was our biggest\nmilitary base, and our most important -- 15 -- 15 minutes less than, he could be in Luxembourg.\nHe could land in a parking lot, I had it all described, and lay a wreath at General Patton\u2019s tomb.\nThen go down 500 yards from the American cemetery, there\u2019s a German military cemetery\nwhere 11,000 Germans are buried. And he could lay a wreath there at the tomb of the unknown\nsoldier. And they could play [indecipherable] and guaranteed no SS, Waffen SS is buried in that\ncemetery, the Luxembourgers would never stand for it. The whole thing would take 45 minutes,\nhe could be back in Bittburg, no harm done, everybody would be happy, nobody would criticize.\nBut I made the mistake of s -- using a regular cablegram, which goes to the state department.\nAnd the state department routinely routes this to the European director, who routes it to the\npresident\u2019s office as a recommendation from an ambassador. And I think Michael Dever got it\nand f -- the gist of the cablegram I got back was in so many words, mind your own business. This\nis all settled. And that was the e-end of it. I should have had the courage to -- cause I\u2019d\ncorresponded with the president, and I had occasion to meet him on several occasions, after I\nbecame ambassador of course, but he knew who I was, and it was on Dear John basis. And I\nthink I could have gotten through to him, and I\u2019ve kicked myself ever since. But anyhow,\nReagan came to Bittburg and he went to the cemetery where some Waffen SS were buried, I\nforget, 49 or some -- what the number was. Michael Dever had been there to inspect the site, but\nthe cemetery was covered with snow, so he couldn\u2019t tell. Well, he could have gone to the\nregistration office, any high school kid could have told him that there were SS men buried in the\nAmerican military ceme -- Waffen SS. But he didn\u2019t [indecipherable] but that -- that was his\nproblem, among others. Well, then I received an invitation from the Jewish community\ncongregation in Luxembourg, that there was going to be sort of a protest ceremony at the same\ntime that Reagan was in Bittburg at the cemetery, at the American cemetery in [indecipherable].\nWould I accept to come? And my good friend, Mr. Ocks, who was the president of the\ncongregation was very surprised when I personally called him and said, \u201cOf course, I'll come,\nPll be very happy to be there.\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe it, he said, \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re putting you\non the spot.\u201d Beca -- I had a very good relationship with him, I used to give talks to a roomful of\nsurvivors from Luxembourg and -- and Rabbi Boltz is a -- a good personal friend, and used to\ninvite him to our embassy, along with the Catholic Archbishop of Luxembourg. Was always a\nvery in -- but they real good buddies, they were real good friends, h-had a very nice relationship.\nTalk about freedom of religion, they really have it over there. The respect. Grand Duke and\nGrand Duchess would come to synagogue on many occasions, and it was just a wonderful\nrelationship. Anyhow, when I accepted they were very much surprised, and I went. And that\u2019s\nwhere I met Rabbi Here, and also some other members of the Wiesenthal Center. And the second\nsurprise was that I was willing to make a talk -- give a talk, and so I did. And I brought greetings\nfrom the president. And I was wise enough to at least notify the president that I was going to be\nthere. Well, the media was there in force, and they really expected me to take off and either blast\nthe president or make some comment. And -- and I didn\u2019t, all -- the only thing I said was I think\nPresident Reagan should be here instead of in Bittburg, because this where he could have devil --\ndeliver a really significant message. But he\u2019s not, and I\u2019m here to represent him, and I bring you\ngreetings and then I\u2019m -- went into my spiel about how grateful we are those who sacrificed and\nwe'll never forget them -- made the regular speech for the occasion, and everybody was happy,\nexcept the media, cause I really let them down, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t stick my neck out and\njeopardize my job. But I was jeopardizing it because if Reagan had taken offense, or somebody\nelse had wanted to take issue -- but Schulz was very understanding, and he complimented me.\nAnd Weinberger complimented me and they all said fine, everything is great. And then Reagan\u2019s\nown specch -- that afternoon, we went -- Winnie and I went to Bittburg and -- and heard his\nspeech and -- and I\u2019ve quoted his speech many times, and -- we can\u2019t undo what\u2019s been done, we\ncan\u2019t bring back to life those who have died, but the one lessons we\u2019ve been taught by World\nWar II is that good much triumph over evil -- I\u2019m quoting roughly, good must triumph over evil\nand freedom must triumph over totalitarianism. And a -- we should never forget the lessons\nlearned because that\u2019|l help us make a better future than -- the gist of his [indecipherable] which\nhe would build his speech. So everybody was okay, except the media, and the thi -- and people\nwho got the idea from some media presentations, with which I disagree, that he was perfectly\nwilling to go to that cemetery. Actually, at that point -- President Reagan was the kind of\npresident who relied pretty much on his lieutenants. He -- he delegated, and he was a eight to\nfive man, and some of that is good and some of it is bad. But he didn\u2019t get involved in details, he\nnever did. Some presidents get too involved in details and that\u2019s wrong, too. And you do have a\nstaff, you do have people around you and a cabinet, so take what you will of that. But -- but\nReagan really didn\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t think ever -- anybody ever told him that there were Waffen\nSS buried there. And if they had, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have known the difference, unless somebody\ntold him. I mean, how many people know the difference between the SS of the concentration\ncamp type and the Waffen SS? There is a difference. And the Waffen SS, unfortunately, was sort\nof an elite military unit, and sort of like our Green Berets and -- but toward the end, the Waffen\nSS ended up with a lot of regular SS men in it, and they began to do a lot of the things that the --\nthe occupying forces, the atrocities against the civilian population, and of course the\nconcentration camp, the thing [indecipherable] so there was a -- a definite mix, but the president\nwouldn\u2019t have known that. In fact, I don\u2019t think anybody in his staff would have particularly\nknown this, unless somebody told them.",

So Winnie and I were wandering around the park and visiting different places that\nwere very dear to us, celebrating the last day in -- before I had to go into the army.",

This picture was taken in\nGermany with my own Jeep, you\u2019ll notice that\u2019s Jeep number one, and the name on the -- the\nwindshield is Johnny Mike, our first-born son.

        "A: Actually taken clandestinely by a Luxembourger, who wasn\u2019t supposed to know what\u2019s going\non inside there, but he did.

And the Luxembourgs -- the Luxembourgers\ndecided they needed a more modern casino, and they also felt that they din -- didn\u2019t want this to\nbecome a national shrine to which Germans could make pilgrimages, and pay tribute to the Nazis\nlast home. So they tore it down, and bi --",
        "Q: Okay, so who is this?",
        "A: This is a group photograph that actually appeared in Time magazine in their November 1945\nissue, after we open up our facility to the media. Time magazine took this picture, they called it\nthe class of 1945, with the class president, Hermann Goering, the Reichsmarshall, occupying the\nmost prominent place. The Reichsmarshall considered himself the -- the leader still, even though\nhe had been defrocked, more or less, by Hitler.",
        "Q: And whose that?",
        "A: His competitor in this particular case was Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, who had been named\nby Hitler to be his successor, so that in this situation, both Goering and Doenitz competed with\neach other for leadership of the class of 1945.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: Now this is a close-up of a -- a section of the fence that completely surrounded the compound\nwhere Ashcan, the Palace Hotel was located. The bottom strand of wire, barbed wire, has a sign,\n[speaks German] because that was the electrified wire. If you stepped across that one, then you\ntook your life in your hands. This is one of the machine gun towers. There were four of them on\neach -- one on each corner of the fence on the compound. A man with a 30 caliber machine gun\nand two armed guards. This is the entrance to the Palace Hotel. And the guest just being ushered\nin, carrying his own suitcase, is Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader and former\ngaolighter of Vienna. This is one of the rooms inside the Palace Hotel, which served as the\nbarber shop and also as a first aid office for the doctor and a dentist who took care of the -- the\ninmates.",
        "Q: And this room?",
        "A: This is actually one of the rooms in the Palace Hotel. As a matter of fact, it happens to be\nHermann Goering\u2019s room. Note that the complete furnishings are the folding army cot, which did\nhave a straw mattress on it, and then a rather shaky chair, and table, and a washstand. Iron bars\non the window, plastic Plexiglas. And the view from that particular room of the approach, the\ngardens of the Palace Hotel is on this picture. We did allow the prisoners to walk 1n this\nparticular area inside the barbed wire enclosure. By comparison, when the prisoners were moved\nfrom Luxembourg to Nuremberg, they were put into a Franconian state prison, and this is one of\nthe cells in that Franconia state prison, where they spent their time all during the course of the\nNuremberg trials, both before and during the trials, until they were sentenced to death, or moved\nto prison in Berlin. This is another view of the same cell with the window and a new paint job.",

        "A: Note -- note the niche in that cell, that actually is where the ho -- the toilet is located with the\nstand pipe and a flush button at the top, which Robert Ley, the leader of the German labor front,\nthe arbeitsfront, used to strangle himself with a piece of towel, by sitting on the toilet and putting\nforce against the noose that he had manufactured and fastened to the pipe.

All of my brothers, with one exception, all worked\nfor my father. They all went into the building trade, plastering and bricklaying and carpentry, and\neach one of them had a specialty and they worked in my father\u2019s company. And naturally that\u2019s\nwhat was in store for me. Well, for some reason or other I had different ideas, I\u2019m -- I had\nambitions. So when we came to the United States my father resisted my interest in having an\neducation, and he -- he liked to point out that he never went to college, and he never even went to\nhigh school, and he was a success in life, why did I want to waste my time?

But he had very narrow views about that sort of thing.\nBut strangely enough, when I insisted and followed my own path, he was the first one to step up\nfront and point with pride. And he did really enjoy whatever success I had in school. He -- he\ntook upon himself to let everybody know that -- when I became a valedictorian in high school, he\n-- he patted himself on the back, too, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a --",
        "A: Of -- that\u2019s absolute -- that\u2019s absolutely right, he -- he -- he never adapted. And he made the\nsacrifice, coming to the United States, for my sake. And I\u2019ve always given him credit for that.\nBut he never assimilated. He never wanted to be part of the -- he -- he didn\u2019t even bother to learn\nthe language. He wanted to just remain what -- what he was. And proud of it. But -- and so I\ndidn\u2019t fit that pattern, right, I created a pattern of my own. And naturally, with his old fashioned,\nbasically European viewpoint, he just didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t see that. He couldn\u2019t agree with that. I\nmean, we didn\u2019t have any arguments about it, but he would just pooh pooh the idea, na -- da --\nyou don\u2019t need to do that, I never did it, look at me. And --",
        "A: Oh yeah, she -- as much as poss -- but I had to be pretty much on my own, because I -- I was -\n- made perfectly clear that I wasn\u2019t going to sponge off of my sister and her family. She had her -\n- her own child, she had one daughter, Madeline. And -- so it was still possible to do it in the\nUnited States --",
        "A: -- the land of opportunity, and for me it was.",
        "A: Well, he wa -- he was really -- he stopped working as far as following his trade was\nconcerned. But he did work around the neighborhood. He would, you know, repair things for --\nfor people and do some small building jobs and that sort of thing, and -- but we sold our family\nhomestead -- our family home, and my father could pretty much live on that. He -- he was up in\nyears, he was a --",
        "A: -- see, well it\u2019s the 50 -- he was born in 1972 -- a -- 1872 rather.",
        "A: So, he was retired.",
        "A: And so. But he did manage to keep busy around the neighborhood and -- in Akron and earn\nsome pocket money and so forth, but there was never a -- never any want, I mean --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: He -- oh, he never [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, no, it -- he could -- he\u2019d read the paper, at least he pretended to read, and he kept pretty\nmuch informed of what\u2019s going on. But there was a German church in -- in Akron that he went\nto. At least one sermon was preached in German in Saint Bernard church, I recall. So he kept up\nhis contacts that way, and he subscribed to a -- a Luxembourg paper and a German paper. He\ncould read German. Although he was born in f -- in France, his French was not very good. He\nwas primarily Germanic because his family had moved from Paris to the Saar Basin, at the time\nthat Saar was still a part of France.",
        "A: Of course, the Saar went back and forth and one time German, then it was independent, and\nthen it was again part of France. So in the Saar almost everybody spoke French and German, too.",
        "A: But my father primarily spoke the Saar dialect, which is very close to the Luxembourg patois.",
        "A: Well, I think -- you know, I wa -- I was -- the only movies I saw at Luxembourg were\nAmerican movies and they were cowboy movies, Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson. And the idea of\ncowboys and Indians appealed to me. There\u2019s an author that every boy in -- in Luxembourg, and\nfor that matter, I think 1n western Europe reads as a boy and those are a series of novels about the\nAmerican Indians and cowboys, written by Karl May. And everybody has read Karl May, as I\ndid. And so I fantasized, I had ideas of what life was like in United States. That part appealed to\nme very much, but I was 12 years old, going on 13, and the idea of also leaving all my friends,\nand the culture that I was used to in Luxembourg, that created some problems, so I had a\nconflict. I was excited in one way, and another way a -- I could hardly wait to have it happen.",
        "A: Yet, I -- I was afraid of it. So the -- I didn\u2019t want to leave, so --",
        "A: Oh, I think I was too young to be aware of -- of really what was going on. I don\u2019t think that I\nbecame particularly interested in what was happening. Wa -- once we got to the States, I did, I\nthink, what I now think every immigrant should do. First of all concentrate on learning the\nlanguage, and I -- I couldn\u2019t speak a word of English, so I had work pretty hard, because I went\nto school, public school, and they immediately sent me back two years. I should have been in the\neighth grade, and I ended up in the sixth grade, but before that I -- they put me in kindergarten.\nAnd here I am 13 years old, and I\u2019m in kindergarten, the biggest boy in class, but that was the\nonly advantage. But I had to learn English from the bottom up, and I spent th-three months in\nkindergarten and then a couple of more months in the third grade. And then moved me up to,\nfinally, the sixth grade, and I went on from there. But I think I concentrated on becoming a Boy\nScout, and becoming Americanized, and I -- I loved the Boy Scout experience. That contributed\na great deal to my Americanization. And learning the language was -- was a challenge. And as I\nsay, assimilating, which I -- I think is essential to become a part of the American scene, you\nknow, you should. So I didn\u2019t -- I really sort of forgot all about Luxembourg and -- to the point\nwhere even corresponding with my friends became secondary and I didn\u2019t do much of it any\nmore. That all came back later, see.",
        "A: One more brother had come to Chicago.",
        "A: I had a brother in Chicago, my brother Ted. And my sister Marie in Akron. All the others\nwere -- were back in Luxembourg.",
        "A: Very much so, and of course, after the war started, there was no communication, and no mail,\nwe couldn\u2019t get any. After the -- the Germans occupied Luxembourg, mail service to the United\nStates was just unheard of. The only way -- I think once or twice we did get some\ncommunication from one of my brothers, because somebody who was going to another country,\nmailed a letter for him, I -- I do recall my -- my father getting a letter once from my brother\nHeinrich that way. But there was no communication. N-No such thing as transatlantic telephone\ncalls, and -- and the mail service was nonexistent. But there th -- there\u2019s definitely a -- a\ncessation of communication. There was just no -- no way of being in touch, so --",
        "A: 1938.",
        "A: Yes. Akron -- Akron North High School. That --",
        "A: Well, I had -- as I say, I had pretty much made up my mind, and -- and -- and this is a --\nagain, the -- the a -- the hero worship that we\u2019re all guilty of in our youth, and I had picked my\nhero. He was a scout executive, a camp director. My favorite place in the United States as a boy\nwas the scout camp, Camp Manatoc in Akron, Ohio, that I attended regularly. In fact, I\nremember my junior year in high school, I spent more nights at camp than I did in my own bed at\nhome. But I loved Camp Manatoc, an -- an -- an ideal boy scout camp, and the man who was\ncamp director of it, was just the -- he was my idol. He was the kind of man I wanted to be in\nevery way. Tall, and handsome and -- and a beautiful singing voice, a speaking voice. A lot of\npersonality and that is what I wanted to be like. And I decided I would be a professional scout\nexecutive so I could be like Mr. Josselle and follow in that -- that pattern. So naturally that meant\nan education and going to college, and my ambition was to get a college degree and go into\nprofessional scouting. And I had the audacity at that time to write to the chief scout executive,\nDr. James E. West, I recall at that time, professional scout executive. And they answered my\nletter, and we started up a correspondence. He s -- sort of became my -- my mentor by mail,\nencouraging me on what to study in high school and college and preparing myself for a\nprofessional career in scouting. So that was my idea. Well, at scout camp I met some of the\nyounger leaders, who were students at Miami University. And there was also one who was a -- a\ngraduate of Washington and Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania. And both of these\ninterests, they started recruiting me for their particular institution. And I did get a scholarship at\nWashington and Jefferson. And it was worth a lot more financially than another scholarship I had\nat Miami University, so I decided to go to Washington and Jefferson. And I would graduate and\nthen go to the Schiff scout reservation and become a professional scout executive. That was my\nambition. Then I fell in love and -- during the summer of 1938, I met the young lady whom I\nsubsequently married. And we decided during our summer romance that we would go to college\ntogether. And that meant going to a co-educational school. So --",
        "A: Washington and Jefferson was a male school, all male. So I ended up taking the scholarship\nfrom Miami University because then we can go together.",
        "A: That wasn\u2019t the only reason. Miami also had a good reputation, was a good school and there\nwere a lot of alumni who influenced me at scout camp. So we made a very happy choice. And\nwe both enrolled at Miami University and went all through college together, four years.",
        "A: Oh, I majored in psychology, again at Dr. West\u2019s suggestion. As a scout executive he thought\npsychology ought to be my major because it\u2019s working with people, understanding people, and\nworking with scouts and the whole leadership concept, so I majored in psychology for that\nparticular reason, so --",
        "A: Yeah, came -- s-served me -- it served me very well --",
        "A: -- later on too, see, Particular at -- it tied in as part of my pattern of circles into what\neventually did happen during the war and --",
        "A: -- my career in the military and afterwards, so --",
        "A: Oh yes, th-the -- the minute wore broke out we became very conscious of it.",
        "A: And of course we were in school, we were in -- you know, in an education institution and I\nwas taking a lot of courses that involved current events and development in Europe. And then\nbecause of my European connection, I really went into that as a -- I became an avid follower of\nthe news, of what was happening in -- in -- in Luxembourg particularly after the Germans\ninvaded Luxembourg. You know, after all, they were invading my homeland. Now I became\nvery much concerned and followed it very closely. And I think what -- what added to the -- the\nstimulus there was not being able to communicate with anybody in Luxembourg, and that sort of\nadded an extra challenge, or pizzazz to the whole relationship.",
        "A: But I was very conscious of what was going on in Europe by then, so --",
        "A: Much too soon.",
        "A: Actually, a -- an-and this is something that -- that really struck me during the war and after the\nwar and now, in retrospect, how very little we knew about what was going on in Germany. We\nreally -- from the in -- the military intelligence standpoint and the political intelligence\nstandpoint, we had no idea what Nazism was all about, I mean the headlines, nothing in depth.\nAnd much of what we did learn, scratchy as it was -- sketchy as it was, was written off as\npropaganda.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s the sort of thing we -- we said about the Germans in World War I. And you\nknow, there were the America [indecipherable] who were very active in the early stage, 1939 -\n1940, before Pearl Harbor and before we got involved. And there was this feeling of this is not\nour war, this is none of our business, and -- so what little we did know that could be introduced\nin a history class or political science class was either propaganda or as I say, was on the surface,\nnothing really in depth. And it wasn\u2019t, until we got involved in the war, and began to make\npersonal contact with prisoners of war, and with German government officials, that we began to\nbecome aware of what Nazism 1s all about. And this is what made my own assignment such a big\nchallenge. We were pioneering in military intelligence work.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: What -- what we did here, as I say, was -- was very sketchy. Remember now, we were no\nlonger allowing refugees to come to United States.",
        "A: We actually turned them away, as you know, which I think is one of the -- the dark sides in\nAmerican history. But no German immigrants came to the United States after the -- the war\nbegan. And -- and after Nazism, when the Germans starting working on a final solution. So the\ninformation we had, as I say, was -- was very incomplete and a lot of it was written off as -- as\npropaganda.",
        "A: We -- we really didn\u2019t know -- Kristallnacht, that could be a perfectly good propaganda story.",
        "A: A-And so what? So they were going around breaking windows, who cared? We -- we didn\u2019t\nreally take any of that seriously, unfortunately.",
        "A: D-During the 1936 --",
        "A: -- Olympic?",
        "A: Oh yes, well of course, we were very excited about our own Jesse Owens --",
        "A: -- and -- and proud of that.",
        "A: But that was -- that really had nothing to do with the politics of it as far as we as young people\nare concerned --",
        "A: -- in other words, gee, our boy won --",
        "A: -- and so one of our -- one of our guys made it. And we didn\u2019t relate that to the philosophy of\nNazism versus democracy or -- or anything else, no, no.",
        "A: We were quite naive.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We -- we got married first.",
        "A: Which -- you know, Miami University, like many other institutions, Miami University is a\nstate institution and very strict regulations. I remember when we started going to college, my\nfreshman year boys and girls didn\u2019t even sit together at a football game.",
        "A: I mean, we had a woman\u2019s section and a men\u2019s section. And that changed during the course\nof my freshman year. But there was a lot of strict regulation. Girls had to be in at 11 o\u2019clock at\nnight on Fridays, 10 o\u2019clock during the week. No telephone calls after 10 o\u2019clock, or before three\no\u2019clock in the afternoon. It was very rigid. The idea of two students being married to each other\nand going to school at Miami University was -- that just didn\u2019t exist. Well, then came Pearl\nHarbor, in December \u2019\u00b040 -- 1941, and I -- I felt -- I -- I really felt that I wanted -- not only would\nget involved, but wanted to get involved. And so I signed up for the navy, a special\n[indecipherable] program. I was going to go in the navy and get -- when I graduated, and through\n[indecipherable] program I could go to a special training school and graduate as an ensign in the\nnavy and that would be the natural thing for me to do. So we knew that was going to happen, and\nif that\u2019s the case, then we wanted to get married before I left. So the university had, meanwhile,\nchanged the rules after Pearl Harbor and many of the students who wanted to get married, could.\nNow we were the first to sign up. So in January 17\", 1942, a month after Pearl Harbor, a little\nover, we got married on the weekend in Oxford. I remember our classes were dismissed. Our\nprofessors came to our wedding. We still have a -- a film of a -- of our wedding that my father-\nin-law took, and -- of all my professors coming to our wedding, including the president of the\nuniversity and his wife, Dr. and Mrs. Upham. And they gave us special permission to get\nmarried. And we started it and then of course there were others who did the same thing. Well, as\nit turned out, I didn\u2019t get that navy program because I hadn\u2019t been a naturalized citizen long\nenough. You -- you -- and I don\u2019t know if the navy still has that rule, but you could not become\nan officer in the navy, air force or marines, unless you\u2019d been a American citizen 10 years. You\ncould be an officer in the army, but not in the other branches. So I had gone through all the\nprocedures of joining this [indecipherable] program when they decided I hadn\u2019t been a citizen\nlong enough and didn\u2019t qualify. So I just continued my course. Then the draft board got me.\nNaturally, and we expected that.",
        "A: And they put me in one B. That was a -- one A were drafted immediately, one B you were\npostponed because you were in school, or -- and I had a slight vision problem in my left eye,\nwhich I didn\u2019t even know about. So they classified me one B, which meant we could get married\n-- we could graduate. We were married, we could graduate. So we actually graduated in June of\n1942. And meanwhile I got a job with Proctor and Gamble in Cincinnati, and we set up\nhousekeeping in Cincinnati. And then in November of \u201942, one B number came up and my\npostponement -- postponement had ended. So on November 13\", 1942, I got the word, you\nknow, you\u2019re now in the army. So that changed everything, so we were ready to go. We\nanticipated it all along, just a matter of time, you know. And believe it or not, you know, I was\ndrafted, but I really was eager to go. I felt \u2019'd benefited so much and -- and I don\u2019t have a false\nsense of patriotism, it\u2019s very genuine. I really thought I wanted to serve and at the same time\nthere was a relationship with -- I wanted to help liberate Luxembourg, so there\u2019s a little bit of\nthat entered into it as well, so 1t was a -- a mutual, satisfying agreement.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: Basic training.",
        "A: Well, th-that, of course, is a -- you know, every once in awhile I ma -- I\u2019m making a speech\nand -- and I have a lot of fun explaining how I actually ended up where I eventually did. But I\nknow when I was inducted at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and a -- a -- a young personnel officer, I\nthink was a corporal or a PFC asked me what I could do, and I told him I could speak German\nfluently and I\u2019d like to get into -- into military intelligence. And his answer, \u201cWell did you ever\ndrive a truck?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, but I can speak German fluently.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to give up so easily.\nBut he wanted to know if I could drive a bus or a tractor, or -- or plow with something heavy,\nwith air brakes, and -- and no I didn\u2019t qualify for any of that. But by that time my minute and a\nhalf was over, and I ended up being sent to Fort Knox, Kentucky to be a tank driver. That\u2019s what\nthey needed that particular day. So I started my career in the army being trained to be a tank\ndriver. I was in the armored force, armored force replacement training center at Fort Knox. So I\nlearn how to drive a heavy vehicle in the armored force, even a motorcycle, which I hated. But\nthe big trucks and armored cars and tanks; fired every weapon from a revolver on up to the big\nHowitzers and, you know, it\u2019s kind of exciting, right? I -- I -- I kind of liked it. So, after I\nfinished my basic training, I did have a college degree, the army decided I was officer material.\nSo I became one of those 90 day wonders. I went to officer\u2019s candidate school and after 90 days\nat Fort Knox, I got a commission as a second lieutenant. And incidentally got my commission\nfrom General George S. Patton, Jr. General Patton was the commencement speaker when I -- I\ngraduated. And my commission was in mechanized cavalry, and since Patton was a cavalry\ngeneral, he pinned a cavalry insignia on the -- the members of my class who were taken into the\nmechanized cavalry, there were 10 of us -- 10 of us. So I thought that was a -- a good beginning\nof my career. Course Patton wasn\u2019t as famous then as -- as he subsequently became, but --",
        "A: Well, you know, the horse cavalry.",
        "A: Well, during World War II, we\u2019re -- we\u2019re now --",
        "A: -- mechanized cavalry, and the mechanized cavalry 1s light -- light tanks and fast moving\nvehicles, Jeeps, light tanks and light armored cars, half tracks, actually. And the mechanized\ncavalry is used for reconnaissance. They\u2019re in the forefront, they\u2019re reconnoitering th-the terrain\nand enemy strength. So reconnaissance 1s the -- the spearhead of an armored division, and\narmored division, of course, are your heavy guns and your heavy tanks, and you have your c-\ncavalry reconnaissance for the lead, to explore the territory ahead, so -- and that was the purpose\nof the mechanized cavalry. I was assigned to the 23\u2122 cavalry reconnaissance squadron of the 16\"\narmored division, Camp Chaffee, Arkansas. So after I got my commission, that was my first\nmilitary assignment, in Arkansas, 16\" armored division, so -- then, months later, the army found\nout I could speak German.",
        "A: And that ties into what -- what I said earlier. We were ready to invade North Africa and we\nwere going to begin to make our first eyeball to eyeball contact with the enemy and it suddenly\noccurred to somebody here in Washington that gee, you know, what are we going to talk to them\nabout? And who\u2019s going to do the talking? We hadn\u2019t thought of setting up ike -- IPW teams, or\ncounterintelligence teams, or -- we hadn\u2019t even thought of military government, in case we won\nthe war. So all of a sudden the lights went on and they decided we got to round up all the people\nwho can speak German. So regardless of where you belonged, or regardless of what your\nbackground was, if you spoke German, you -- you got yanked into military intelligence. And just\na -- acry went out, order went out, cooks, bakers, quartermasters, even some medical personnel,\nall put in the military intelligence.",
        "A: And we were sent to Camp Richie, Camp Richie, Maryland, which is the Maryland National\nGuard camp, about 90 miles north of Washington. And that became the secret training center for\nmilitary intelligence personnel. And that\u2019s where I ended up on very short notice, from Arkansas\nto Camp Richie, Maryland. So I was transferred from the armored force to military intelligence.\nAnd my specialty then wa-was interrogating prisoners of war. That\u2019s what I was trained to do.",
        "A: Oho, that is a -- you know, 1-if I were younger and had the ambition, I\u2019d write another book\nand I -- I would just write about Camp Richie, because that was the most fascinating place. You\ncould -- there was a poem that a very intelligent military intelligence officer wrote, and it starts\nout, was you ever at Camp Richie, the [indecipherable] of all, where the sun comes up like\n[indecipherable] recorded bugle call. And that\u2019s the way the poem starts out. You could hear\nevery language under the sun spoken at Camp Richie, Maryland. And they brought in people --\nnot just German speaking, French, Italian, Arabic, everything. You -- you -- we had a\nconglomeration of people. And quite a few, including quite a few Jewish refugees who had come\nto the United States earlier, who had been taken into the army, they were all sent to Camp Richie\nbecause they were the only ones who could speak fluent German still. And they were the ideal\nmilitary government and military intelligence personnel. Their -- their f -- their German was\nfluent. There were very few a -- a that type of German speaking military personnel available. So\nmost of the others were people who had studied German in school, or majored in German in\ncollege, or had German parents who spoke German at home. But the real fluent German speaker\n-- and a lot of our intelligent officers were -- were Jewish. My colleagues at -- that I lived with\nwere all refugee families who had come to these United States early, in the 30\u2019s, with their\nfamilies. So all these people were thrown together and they had different sections, there were\neight sections all together, and I was in section five, that was the IPW section. But there were the\nCIC, the counter-intelligence, there was the photo interpretation, the photo intelligence, people\nwho studied aerial photos and -- and could make sense out of -- out of that particular effort. And\nth-there were the OSS people, and ha-hand to hand combat people who worked behind the lines,\nthe forerunner of the CIA. We -- we trained them in everything, and we had regular German\nprisoners of war, the very first who had been taken in North Africa were brought to Camp\nRichie. And the -- we -- you know, we had a chance to practice first hand --",
        "A: -- with real German prisoners. So it was a -- a very exciting place. What we taught then was\nGerman army organization, which we knew nothing about. National Socialism, which we knew\nvery little about. All the paramilitary organizations under the Hitler regime, we didn\u2019t know what\nthe NSKK was, or the NSFK, the National Socialist Flying Corps, National Socialist Motor\nCorps. This was the paramilitary that the Hitler regime had organized. These people were getting\nsubtle military training by belonging to the truck driver\u2019s corps, or the flying corps, but they\nwere being prepared for military. So there were a lot of those. Germany was limited to a hundred\nthousand man army, but bor -- by the time Hitler was ready to invade Poland, he had more than a\nhundred thousand men, I mean, well trained from the Hitler youth on up. We didn\u2019t know that.\nWe had to learn about all these things. We learned about the characteristics and the personalities\nof the high ranking Nazis; we knew nothing about them. If you\u2019ve heard of the film, \u201cTriumph\ndes Willens\u2019, that was our -- our text -- o-our textbook, I should say. Every Thursday I recall, all\nthe classes -- the German classes were brought together in a theater at -- at Camp Richie, and we\nshowed Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s, \u201cTriumph des Willens,\u201d a three hour documentary of a Nuremberg\nrally. And that was the only documentary film, and the only photographic evidence we had of the\nNazi leaders, like Hess, and Goering, and Stryker, and Lie, and seeing them perform in this,\n\u201cTriumph des Willens,\u201d in this film, was the only way that our -- our trainees could learn\nanything about what these Nazis even looked like. That was the beginning of it, and that\u2019s all we\nhad to go on. So our training was somewhat primitive. We had limited intelligence, really,\nbecause we hadn\u2019t done much over there in the way of gathering information, so --",
        "A: They were -- they were people like me. For instance, the course lasted two months, and\nduring that time you learned or-order battle and German army, all the things that I mentioned.\nThen you were sent overseas as a member of an IPW team, which consisted of two officers and\nthree or four enlisted men, all trained at Richie. And you would go overseas and be assigned to a\ndivision, or -- or a regiment, or even an army group, or an army, as interrogator and when those\nunits advanced and took prisoners, the IPW team interrogated them. So Camp Richie was\nfeeding all these interrogators and other intel-telligence personnel to the different divisions as\nfast as we could produce them. Well, every once in awhile there\u2019d be a graduate like me, who\nalso had pretty good training -- [phone ringing |",
        "A: Changing film?",
        "A: Oh, oh.",
        "A: Yeah, well, there were people like me --",
        "A: -- with -- with a -- a college education, and particularly a psychology major, which was\nexactly the sort of thing they wanted. To interrogate prisoners of war you kind of have to have a\nlittle bit of a psychological background -- the -- from the technique of it. And then the German\nlanguage. But th-the military training I had gave me an advantage over those who came from the\nquartermaster corps, or the cooks and bakers school, and -- or some other branch of the service\nwhich was not as military as technical. So I became a teacher. And I started training others,\ninstead of going overseas as a member of an IPW team, I became one of the -- the staff members\nin section five. Our commanding officer was the colonel, Colonel Warndorf, and the -- the other\nteachers in that section, in the German section were graduates of the Richie school who had been\npicked because they had specific background that made good teachers of them. So they were the\nones who were teaching others. By then we were also getting not just people that we were\ntraining in interrogation, but we were also getting general officers and field grade officers from\nmilitary divisions in the country and also some from units already overseas, who were brought\nback to get some special training in military intelligence, particularly aerial photos and\ninterrogation and -- and order of battle, German army organization, that sort of thing. So our\nstudents were not only in a German section IPW members, they were also what we call the S2\nand G2 officers of different divisions. So I was a second lieutenant and a lot of my students were\ngeneral officers, who were the G2 of their divisions, who came for their special training course at\nCamp Richie. It was a very exciting, a very interesting time. And our staff sergeant at the -- in\nsection five, for instance, was Walter Schneider. Walter Schneider was an assistant manager the\nWaldorf-Astoria. Our chef in the mess hall a-at Camp Richie was a chef from one of the leading\n-- | forget which -- hotel of -- of New York or Boston, but he was a super chef and the food was\nsuperb. It was served on metal trays, but it was wonderful. It was gourmet food. The food was\nsuperb because the people we brought in to Richie, we -- were special -- specialists in different\nfields, including cooks and bakers. So -- so we had the best.",
        "A: Cu -- they could also speak German, so that helped also.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, very --",
        "A: Yeah, it -- mostly military based, because that\u2019s what we were interested in getting\ninformation about.",
        "A: They -- the Holocaust and the atrocities as-associated with the Nazi regime was not part of the\nmilitary.",
        "A: W1 -- we really didn\u2019t know too much about it. A lot of that didn\u2019t begin to develop until we\nstarted invading Germany and liberating camps and saw what was going on.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yes, now that was -- but that was not part of the training.",
        "A: That would be a personal relationship.",
        "A: And frankly, you take a lot of that with a grain of salt, and you say, well, you know, that\nsounds like propaganda. That\u2019s supposed to make us hate the Germans. Is it really true? And you\nhad to really get to know the people and once you had their -- they had your confidence, then you\nbegan to realize there\u2019s something to this. But that came much later, really. I know oh, golly,\nnames like Watson, Landauer, Daniels, Verna Daniels, Viel. These are all Jewish colleagues of\nmine, and much of what they knew is hearsay, second hand information. So that was not part of\nthe official development or training at all. That was -- that was talk. You know, was just\nsomebody re -- reciting a story that he had heard from somebody else, about somebody. Ya -- ya\n-- you know, as I say, we -- we had no refugees. Nobody who had been in a concentration camp\ncame to Germany -- I mean, came from Germany to the United States, not at that time.",
        "A: I mean, that -- that\u2019s all post-war.",
        "A: So we really were, as I say, very naive. Probably no one was more surprised -- and I speak\nfirst hand knowledge -- at the atrocities or the things that they saw than some of our commanding\ngenerals, like Eisenhower and -- and Bradley, as our units advanced, and the advancing troops\nwould liberate a camp and then generals like Eisenhower and -- and others would come and see\nfor the first time. And that\u2019s the first time they heard of some of these things.",
        "A: That -- yeah, didn\u2019t believe it, it -- 1t was, you know, we went back to first World War, and\nthe Germans were mutilating nuns and that kind of stories you heard.",
        "A: See, but that\u2019s necessary in war. You have to -- you have to make propaganda in order to\nmake you hate the enemy and fight him. So it was taken with a grain of salt.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: They were -- we\u2019re looking at it fr --",
        "A: -- yeah, we\u2019re looking at strictly from the military standpoint --",
        "A: -- you know? We just -- the rest of it really was -- came much later --",
        "A: -- much to our surprise.",
        "A: Yeah, the training course is two months.",
        "A: And then you were immediately shipped out.",
        "A: But -- but I stayed another 10 months beyond that. Meanwhile, we had -- when I was assigned\nto the 16\" armored division at Camp Chaffee, Arkansas, that was a brand new division, and I\nwas a cavalry officer, in other words I -- we were training people for that division. So I knew I\nwould be in Arkansas at least two years before I go overseas. So we decided now is the time to\nhave a family. Then when my wife was nine months pregnant, one week before our firstborn\nchild was due, I was transferred to military intelligence. Boom. And that -- that was a big\nsurprise. Now everything changed. Well, Winnie, my wife, decided I at least had -- had to see the\nbaby. So a week before Johnny Mike was due, she got permission from her doctor in Arkansas to\nmake the trip and she came from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Blueridge Summit, Pennsylvania by\ntrain, on a troop train. Arrived on a Monday, and our Mike was born the Sunday of that week,\nMother\u2019s day, 56 years ago this Sunday. He was born in Blueridge Summit, Pennsylvania, so --\nand we had to decide whether Mike would be -- whether Winnie would be taken to the hospital\nin Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, which is near Blueridge Summit, or Hagerstown. And the doctor\non Sunday morning decided Waynesboro, so our Mike was born north of the Mason-Dixon line.\nBut if Dr. Bridges had decided to go to Hagerstown, we\u2019d have had a southerner in our family.",
        "A: Cause Blueridge Summit is right on the Mason-Dixon line, so -- so -- but -- so now we had a\nbaby and I was at Richie for 10 months, so I was able to see our child at least up til the age of --\nof 10 months.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, she came to Camp Richie, yes, an-and that\u2019s where --",
        "A: -- we lived in Blueridge Summit --",
        "A: Camp Richie was --",
        "A: -- right about a mile from Blueridge Summit, and we lived in Blueridge Summit,\nPennsylvania, it\u2019s right on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania. And when -- and then when\nI was shipped overseas, she went home to Akron with the baby, you know --",
        "A: -- and lived with her sister who also had a husband in the army, so the two sisters kept house.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: No, that was all -- that was top secret. I had no idea what I was going to do or where I was\ngoing. We left out of Camp Kilmer, New York on a troop train -- troop -- on the troop ship. That\nwas the -- the Ile de France, a luxury liner which had been converted into a -- a troop ship. And\nwe went from New York then to Greenark, Scotland and from there by train all the way south to\nSouthampton, England. And then by ferry boat, actually, ferry steamer across the channel into Le\nHavre and then by troop train from Le Havre, eventually to Paris after doing a lot of zigzag-ing\nbecause somebody gotten our orders messed up, we were -- ended up in the wrong place, and the\nship back to Paris. Then I was in Paris about five days, in La Vaisam\u00e9, which was the temporary\nheadquarters of military intelligence in Paris at that particular point. And then I was assigned to\nthe 6824 DIC. 6824 detailed interrogation center. Now here I have to distinguish between the\nregular IPW team that I mentioned earlier. Their function was to get tactical information.\nTactical meaning what\u2019s going on across the river, or what unit is our unit facing. When are they\nplanning to attack, how strong are they. That\u2019s t-tactics. We were also interested now, at this late\nstage of the game in strategic information. Again, we want to know more about do the Germans\nhave the atom bomb? What\u2019s this V1 and V2 business? Chemical bacterial warfare. All of those\nthings we knew nothing about. That was strategic information, and we call that detailed\ninterrogation. So we had a center in the Ardens in northern France, [indecipherable] way up the\npoint where the Mers river goes into Belgium and then comes back down, we were there in a\nhunting lodge. And we\u2019d taken over this little town of Revan. We were billeted in private homes\nand -- and used a hunting lodge for our working area. And we brought prisoners who had\nstrategic information, like general officers, members of the German generals staff. Chemists,\nscientists, physicists, working on the V1, V2. Anybody who had information at a strategic, high\npolitical level, we would bring to this -- taken prisoner along the battlefields anywhere, we\nwould bring to this detailed interrogation center for strategic information. Some of them we\nwould find would have such valuable information that we bring them to the States. Now we had\na very secret place, whose name I still don\u2019t know, right here in Washington, where we brought\nGerman prisoners of war who knew inside information on a very high ranking -- well, anyhow,\nmy assignment was a really exciting one. I was given a Jeep and a driver, and orders by\ncommand of General Eisenhower, I could go anywhere I wanted to go. And my job was to go\nwherever there were prisoners, which was now everywhere.",
        "A: And screen prisoners that we thought might have this kind of strategic information. A lot of\nGerman generals put on enlisted men\u2019s uniforms and were taken prisoner as ordinary corporals\nand privates, but they were really general officers. So we had to find that kind of people, and\nthose who were scientists and -- and had this kind of information we wanted. If they did, I would\narrange to have them shipped back to Revan for detailed interrogation. So my job was to travel\nall along the front wi -- as we were advancing toward the end of the war, and talk to interrogation\nofficers who thought they had a prisoner who --",
        "A: -- who -- who will fit that category, and then I would interrogate him and if he did, then I\nbring him back to Revan, to 6824DIC. So that was my job. So, I could go wherever I wanted,\nwhich opened up a lot of adventures, you know, like the Lipizzaner horses that I mention in my\nbook.",
        "A: I happened to be at the right place at the right time. Or the liberation of Dachau.",
        "A: I arrived there the day after Dachau was liberated. Or, going back in my own unit, I found out\nwhere the 16\" armored division that I had trained with in Arkansas, I found out where it was, so\nI could say, okay, let\u2019s go there. So even up to Czechoslovakia, and the 16\" armored division\nwas going into Pilsen, and so I saw some of my old colleagues again, friends that I had trained\nwith in Arkansas, pattern of circles. I met them just outside of Pilsen, Czechoslovakia during the\nend of the war. And that\u2019s where we had the Lipizzaner horse adventure, and that\u2019s when --\nwhere the war ended. That\u2019s where I happened to be when it all came to an end, so -- so --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: I had never heard of Dachau before, I didn\u2019t know anything about it. All I knew was that I\nwanted to go into Munich to look for a place to sleep, really. During the war when we were\ntraveling like this, and there were just my driver and I, and we were just try to find a military\nunit, one of ours, that was billeted in some hotel, and -- or whenever we advanced, they would\nfind a public building, like a hotel, and just confiscate it and say this is the headquarters. And this\nis where the division officers would -- would sleep and they would just take over the hotel. So\nwith my orders, which were really marvelous because I was traveling by command of General\nEisenhower, I could get a room or a free meal almost anyplace I went. So we were always\nlooking for some place like that, and I was heading toward Munich when I -- I don\u2019t know\nwhether -- whether my driver, or whether we were getting directions from someone, toward\nDachau just outside of Munich and -- and -- and so we went over that way. And then came -- just\nto see what -- what was going on there. We had heard in getting the directions that this was a\nspecial camp that the -- the Germans had operated. So we made a little detour on our way to\nMunich. Actually, it was on the way, and then came upon Dachau. Then I found that it was just\nthe day after the liberation -- the -- the day -- actually, it was two days after, because the day\nafter the liberation, the grand duke of Luxembourg, the Prince Felix -- not the grand duke, but\nthe Prince Consort of the Grand Duchess had been there to greet and liberate, or -- or be present\nfor the liberation of Luxembourgers who had been at the Dachau concentration camp. So if I had\nbeen there one day earlier, I would have had the opportunity to meet the -- th-the Prince Consort,\nPrince Felix. So we got there, and -- and that\u2019s how we came upon the camp. Even then, I don\u2019t\nthink it made an impact on me that it has in retrospect, looking back on it, having learned so\nmuch more about the Holocaust and the atrocities, all I know is this was a horrible place. But I\nthought it was -- my first interpretation without anybody telling me -- we really didn\u2019t know. I\nsay -- we honestly were very naive. Concentration camp per se didn\u2019t mean a thing to me. I\nthought this was a -- a prison camp where people who committed crimes were put. And so I\ndidn\u2019t really get the feel for this, except the hu -- the humanity aspect of it. Even a -- a prisoner\nwho committed murder shouldn\u2019t be treated the way these people had been treated, the way they\nlooked. And Dachau you know, was not a -- a death camp, Dachau was just -- but these people\nwere starving, and -- and had starved. I m-mean, the -- the corpses we saw. And it just didn\u2019t\nregister until long after, as I found out more and more about it, and I could say, I was there, I saw\nthis and didn\u2019t realize what it was.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I didn\u2019t realize, I thought 1t was a prison camp where the prisoners were just not\nproperly treated.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, frankly, I couldn\u2019t. I -- I\u2019m -- I have a weak stomach. I -- I really -- you know, for a long\ntime, I -- I -- I still have difficulty -- \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d was the first movie I ever saw in which a\nconcentration camp was depicted that I -- that I could tolerate, because I -- I thought it was very\ntastefully done. Was excellently -- and yed -- you know, he didn\u2019t dwell on -- he just showed\nenough to realize the horror of it without going into the detail that some of the films do. But I -- I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t like to read books that have a lot of graphic murder scenes in it, I -- I -- Ihave a\nweak stomach. That probably isn\u2019t the best way to say a we -- weak stomach, I -- I just -- I\u2019m\njust softy, I\u2019m a softy, I don\u2019t like to see people suffer. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t li-like to see animals\nsuffer, I certainly don\u2019t like to see people suffer. So I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m like a lot of other people, you\nknow, if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019d just rather not look at it anyway, if you don\u2019t\nhave to.",
        "A: No, more -- more shocked. The -- the idea of, you know, inhumanity that was evident there.\nAnd as I say, I thought this was just a prison camp, where -- where prisoners were kept. Under\nthose circumstances, how could they treat people like that? Even if they deserved rough\ntreatment, they shouldn\u2019t be treated -- that was my reaction. And --",
        "A: Oh not more -- we were just couple of hour -- not even couple of hours, we just --",
        "A: -- going through.",
        "A: Oh ya -- you -- just walked -- walked in and ge -- and the wooden gate was there.",
        "A: And I saw -- I actually saw one person die. He was too weak to even -- a man who was just\ntoo weak to even talk. And that -- that was devastating to me. I had -- I didn\u2019t want to see much\nmore of it. I saw corpses. I saw one building that had obviously been torched with people having\nbeen locked in the building, and then tried to dig their way out underneath it. That w -- that was\nit, that was the -- the worst of it all. So beyond that I didn\u2019t want to see any more. And I -- I just -\n- I saw enough to realize how horrible it was.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t see a single German --",
        "A: -- at -- at my [indecipherable] I mean, a single German soldier --",
        "A: -- at that point. They had already rounded up -- what happened at -- at -- and this is second\nhand information -- at -- at Buchenwald, for instance, the guards took off. I mean, they -- they\nweren\u2019t equipped to fight the advancing an -- German -- so when -- when the am -- advancing\nAmerican. When the Americans advanced, they just all ran away. And Buchenwald, the inmates\nliberated Buchenwald, and that story I know first hand because we eventually come to it because\nthere were Luxembourgers involved in the Buchenwald camp. I actually -- by then I knew quite\na bit about it, and so the Buchenwald story I know more about, even though I hadn\u2019t been there,\nof how it was liberated and so forth.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, th-the Buchenwald thing actually didn\u2019t come to my attention until the trials and then\nBuchenwald was just a name of other camps that had been there. But it became personally close\nto me during my embassy days, 40 years later. In Luxembourg there is an Amicale de\nBuchenwald, and these are Luxembourgers, some Jewish, non-Jews, some were deserters of the\narmy, some were the parents of Luxembourgers who had been forced into the German army,\nwho deserted and then the parents were thrown into the concentration camp, so we had a -- a\nmix. There were about si -- I think at that pra -- point, 74 Luxembourgers in Buchenwald who 40\nyears later still made up what they call the Amicale de Buchenwald, the alumni of Buchenwald.\nThey were liberated, or actually they saw the first the Americans at 11:30 on the 11\" of April,\n1945. They had sent an SOS on their homemade -- secretly homemade radios, giving away their\nlocation where they were. They could hear the gunfire, and they could hear even the -- the\nmotors of the tanks of the sixth armored division advancing. The Nazi guards took off, the -- the\nSS people took off, and -- and the liberators caught a few of them, and -- I mean, not the liberator\n-- the inmates caught a few of the Nazi guards before the liberators came and -- and took care of\nthem. But most of them I -- were gone. The -- the whole leadership of the camp was gone. So by\nthe time the Americans arrived, they were met with open arms by the inmates who had liberated\nthem. Well among them were these Luxembourgers. From that time on, when they got back to\nLuxembourg, they organized their reunion group, their amicale. There are a lot of these in\nLuxembourg, resistance groups who have organized alumni of this particular -- they call the\nLPL, the League Patiotigue Luxembourgoise. The LPL, that was the Luxembourg underground,\nwhich worked with the FFI. Well, they all have alumni clubs, and they have luncheons and -- and\ni-it\u2019s really a -- a very moving experience to be with those people. Well, the Amicale de\nBuchenwald for 40 years, and still today, at 11:30 on the 11\" of April, every year, meet at the\nAmerican military cemetery and place a wreath at the tomb of General Patton, whose third army\nliberated the camp. And then they have a -- a little prayer cer-ceremony and a little reminiscing\nand then they all go and have lunch together and -- and reminisce, and -- and renew their\nfriendships. Well they invited the American ambassador to participate naturally, and so I took\nthem up on it. And so I became part of the activity and it got to the point where after the first\nyear they asked me to give a talk, and I would talk to them, and -- and so that they made me an\nhonorary member of the Amicale de Buchenwald. In 1945, the -- I received a letter from the\nsixth armored division, a veteran\u2019s group, it\u2019s the sixth armored association, they\u2019re called the\nSuper Sixes. And a bunch of them are coming back to Europe to celebrate the 40\" anniversary of\nthe end of the war and the liberation. And they want to come to Luxembourg, and they asked me\nif I would speak to them at the cemetery. A lot of these veteran\u2019s groups did that. During a 10\nmonth period of celebrating the end of the war and the liberation of Luxembourg, I was at that\ncemetery 69 times in 10 months, officially, not counting times when I would take a visit or two,\nto visit. A Colonel Reed from Louisville, Kentucky, he wrote to me and -- and said that he was\nbringing a group of veterans and would I speak to them at the cemetery and of -- I said of course\nI would. But could you arrange to make your visit at a ttme when we could also have the\nAmicale de Buchenwald at the same time. I -- I mention this incident in my book, because it -- it\nwas one of the highlights I think of my embassy career. When I arrived there -- it was all --\nalways arranged for the ambassador to be the last one to arrive, when everybody\u2019s -- ev --\neverything is in place. American flag on the fender, and ambassador flag, and -- and a lot of\nwhoop-de-doo. And I arrived, and was quite a shocking experience because there were two\ngroups standing at General Patton\u2019s grave, and then 5,000 white marble crosses and Stars of\nDavid behind them. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a memorable scene every time. You don\u2019t visit that cemetery\nwithout getting a lump in your throat. Every one of these people buried there died during the\nBattle of the Bulge, at the military cemetery in Luxembourg. And then General Patton\u2019s grave is\nright at the front of it. I arrived there, and here were the -- the Americans on one group and -- and\nthe Amicale de Buchenwald, Luxembourgers 1n the other group, just looking at each other.\nNobody knew what to do, or what to say, because you know, you could -- the atmosphere was so\nheavy you could -- you c -- cut it. And I thought, oh what have I wrought here, you know, I\u2019ve\nbrought these people together, how am I going to break this -- break the ice here. And just as I\nwalked up -- and I knew the Luxembourgers of course, and -- and just as I walked up I heard one\nof the Luxembourg women say to one of the Americans, \u201cI think I remember you, isn\u2019t your\nname Buddy?\u201d And it was, and these two got together and hugged each other, and -- and that\nbroke the ice, I didn\u2019t have to do anything. Th-They s-started mingling then an-and introducing\nthemselves to each other, and -- and that was just a -- a moving experience. The leader of the\nAmicale de Buchenwald, or the president of it was the mayor -- at that time the mayor of a little\ntown called Beaufort where there is a very historic and romantic castle ruin in Luxembourg.\nThere are quite a few castles in Luxembourg, 74 of them to be exact, and Beaufort is one of the -\n- the most romantic because the ruin is fairly well preserved and you can tour it and imagine you\ncan still see the dungeon and -- and the torture chamber and everything else. So it\u2019s a big tourist\nattraction, and the mayor, of course, 1s responsible for the community and the chateau which\nbelongs to the community. He invited the entire sixth armored division bunch to come to\nBeaufort as his guests and sure the -- the buses loaded up and they spent the rest of the day --\nthey changed their whole itinerary. They spent the rest of the day at this site and having their\ndinner in Beaufort, and mingling with the people and -- and they were just a very warm\nexperience. And to this day, and every time we\u2019ve gone back now since our embassy days, we\nalways go to Beaufort, look up the mayor and -- and reminisce about the days. They published a\nbook about Buchenwald and it tells the whole story of the liberation and -- and the inmates and\nwhat -- what it was like, the condition. And it ends with pictures of this reunion group at the 40\"\nanniversary. It\u2019s -- a-and this might well be a book that ought to be in -- in the museum library,\ntoo, I -- I'll -- Pll see to that, yeah. But I learned more about Buchenwald from those people,\nassociating with them than I did Dachau because as I say, 1-1t\u2019s a real emotional challenge, more\nthan I could cope with. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not -- you have to really have a strong stomach. People who\ndon\u2019t believe the Holocaust ever happened ought to make a visit. Not now, should have been\nthere, see the real thing. The -- they\u2019d find out it happened, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, yeah I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think -- well, maybe -- maybe I\u2019m -- I\u2019m the savior of the --\nthe mares anyway, not the stallion. There are two stories about the Lipizzaner horses and they\nalways get mixed up. Walt Disney got them all -- got it all mixed up in his, \u201cMiracle of the\nWhite Stallion.\u201d But I\u2019m in that movie.",
        "A: Yes, but now identified -- the role in -- in that movie actually did happen that way and -- and I\nwas involved in it. I had arrived there with my driver on a search for -- actually I was looking for\nHeisenberg, you know, Heisenberg the physicist Nobel prize winner. And our Manhattan project\npeople were convinced that Germany was working on an atom bomb. And they wanted to know\nwhat Friedisch and Weisecker, and what Heisenberg had done and how far they had gotten. And\nthe truth of it all is that the Germans really were not working on an atomic bomb. They weren\u2019t,\nbut we didn\u2019t know that, so we were looking for people who knew something about Heisenberg,\nand von Weisecker and atomic research and if nothing else it gave me an excuse to go hither and\nyon, and go everywhere. So anyhow, that\u2019s who I was supposedly looking for and it -- and I\nmanaged to be where the 16\" armored division was, near Hofe and [indecipherable] Germany,\nright near the Czech border. I was the only one at -- and there was a s -- a second armored\ncavalry regiment which was heading in that particular sector. And the colonel who was in -- in\ncharge of that particular battalion couldn\u2019t speak German. But one evening I was playing cards\nwith somebody and they need an interpreter and the colonel sent for me and I went over to\ninterpret for him, the reason being that a German captain had voluntarily surrendered and was\nbrought before the colonel to be interrogated and he -- the colonel couldn\u2019t talk to him because\nhe couldn\u2019t speak German, so I was called in to be the interpreter and Disney does have that\nscene in the movie. The colonel is actually eating his dinner and when the prisoner is brought in\nand I do the interrogating. In the movie the prisoner tells the colonel about a horse farm, but that\ndidn\u2019t -- that -- that wasn\u2019t the case at all. He was telling the colonel about dienst stella ost,\nservice station east, translation. Which is a military intelligence unit, German military\nintelligence unit, very much like ours, detailed interrogation. This was a German intelligence unit\ngathering information about the Soviet Union. And they were in a hunting lodge in the Bohemian\nforest, just halfway between the border and Pilgrin, and they were interrogating German -- I\nmean, Russian PW, who had information of a strategic nature, like we were doing on our side.\nThis unit had been in existence for five years and they had maps of every airport in the Soviet\nUnion, of every bridge, of every installation, every weapon, anything you wanted to know about\nthe Soviet army, they had it. The Soviets were about five miles to the east of them, the\nAmericans about five miles to the west of them, they were in the middle. Now what should they\ndo? Do nothing, Soviets might get there first. If they find out what the Germans had been doing\nthere, it\u2019d be their heads. They could just destroy everything they had and take to the woods, but\nthat wouldn\u2019t be German. They\u2019re not going to destroy anything they\u2019ve been gathering for five\nyears. So their third option was to surrender to the Americans before the Soviets would get there.\nSo this captain voluntarily came to our unit and surrendered and told my colonel all about his\ndienst stella ost. They wanted to surrender to us and turn over to us all of the documentation and\nall of the interrogation reports, maps and everything they had about the Soviet Union. So they\nneeded a German speaking officer and I was the only one there, so the colonel said, you know,\n\u201cDoli, your -- you go in, we\u2019ll arrange this.\u201d So we had a two and a half ton truck and driver and\nenlisted man guard and then the sergeant and I in the Jeep -- and sergeant [indecipherable] the\ntruck and I in my Jeep with my driver and we drove into this hunting lodge. It was an air force\ncolonel -- Luftwaffe colonel, a lieutenant colonel, actually, who was the commander of this unit,\nHolters was his name and he made a big show, a very formal first wor -- World War I general\nstaff officer, with a surrender s -- the whole thing. We loaded all the stuff on the trucks and there\nwere just a few officers and enlisted men and they got on the truck with the documents and the\ncolonel got in the Jeep with me and then we drove back to our place. The whole thing didn\u2019t take\nmore than about 20 minutes. But on the way Colonel Holters told me -- asked me if I knew\nanything about horses. And I didn\u2019t know a thing about horses. Well, particularly he wanted to\nknow if I knew anything about the Lipizzaner horses. And I didn\u2019t know anything about them\neither. So he proceeded to tell me about Spanish riding school, and the history of the Lipizzaner,\nvery fascinating. And then I found out the purpose of it all was to tell me that there was a -- a gut\n-- stut -- stud -- stud farm under the German department of agriculture, which had been brought\nto this place -- I forget the name of the owner of the estate now, Arco whatever it was, located\njust in Czechoslovakia, sort of a equivalent to a bluegrass region, which particularly fertile grass\nand particularly good region to breed horses. And the German Department of Agriculture had\nbrought these mares and some stallions and other horses of a different breed, Caucasians and\nsome were from the Russian steppes. About 200 horses, but primarily Lipizzaners for breeding\npurposes to this stud farm. And they were just about two miles south of where w -- two\nkilometers south of where we were. And he told me all about this, so when he explained the\nSpanish riding school to me, I -- I just felt well, we ought to get involved here. So we took a\ndetour. I sent a sergeant and a truck with the other prisoners, and documents and everything on,\nand we took a little detour and this how we came upon this stud farm. And th-the -- they -- there\nwere all the lipi -- my first look at Lipizzaner horses, a beautiful sight. This 1s in May, and the\nmeadow was in bloom and everything else is just beautiful. And I had learned enough about the\nhorses to really appreciate this. There were some young horses who were frolicking in -- 1n the\nmeadow and doing things that is officially described as airs above the ground, which are the\nthings that we train the stallions to do -- I mean we -- they trained the stallions to do at the\nSpanish riding school and wherever they have Lipizzaner horses, there are two farms here in the\nUnited States where they train lipid -- breed and train Lipizzaners. Anyhow, these foals -- th-\nthese horses we-were -- were doing these things naturally. The trick is to teach them to do it on\ncommand. And that was the beauty of this development that I saw. Anyhow, the point was that I\nhad the opportunity to -- to meet Colonel Potisky, who was the leader of the Spanish riding\nschool, who happened to be there at that particular time. Well, to make a long story short, from\nthe stud farm, once I saw it, I took some pictures and I went on back then, reported to Colonel\nReed what I had seen. He had a brother who -- who had performed an e -- an eques -- equestrian\nof the Olympics. And he went riding a horse that was named Potisky in honor of Colonel Potisky\nof the Spanish riding school. So he knew all about them. And I said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a stud farm.\u201d\nHere we are and -- so he took over. And we had German PW and a lot of Polish DPs who were\nin the area, who then helped some of our American forces move the horses back into Germany\nbecause the fear was that the ri -- Soviets would get there first, and they would eat them, because\nthe rumor, and it\u2019s -- I guess it was true, too, there was a Spanish riding school in Budapest, and\nthe Soviets tried to get those horses to use them to pull wagons and the Lipizzaners wouldn\u2019t\nrespond, so they ji -- but-butchered them. And so they were afraid this what would happen to the\nLipizzaner. Plus the fact that the Polish DPs didn\u2019t like the Germans, and they would take care of\nthe Lipizzaners also if they got a chance. So we rescued them, we -- we brought them. Some of\nthe stallions were there, but mostly they were the -- the mares and the foals and some of the other\nhorses. And we moved them across into a sector of -- of Germany, Schwartzburg, which is in the\ncommand of the second armored cavalry regiment. That\u2019s the story that I was involved in.\nMeanwhile, at about the same time, General Walker of the 20\" corps came into Austria to St.\nMartin in -- in Crise, and came to an estate there which they set up as their headquarters, where\nthe stallions of the Spanish riding school from Vienna had been brought by Colonel Potisky. And\ncolonel -- General Walker was quite impressed and knowing that Patton was a horse lover and\ncavalryman, notified Patton, who was at that time I think in -- in Frankfort. And Patton and the\ndeputy secretary of war, who was visiting the front at that time, got into Patton\u2019s plane and they\nflew to Saint Martin\u2019s and the stallions from the Spanish riding school put on a show for Patton -",
        "A: -- with the result that Patton put the Lipizzaners under the protection of the United States\narmy, all Lipizzaners, which included the ones from the stud farm, who were included in that\ngeneral order. Nobody could touch the Lipizzaner horses who were under the protection of the\nUnited States army, because Patton was quite impressed with them. And it turned out that he had\nwid -- ridden in the Olympics in 1912 against Colonel Potisky. And the most famous quote to\nme, a Patton quote is -- I don\u2019t have the exact quote, but he was quite peevishly concerned that\nwhy the Austrians used 57 healthy, well-trained men to teach horses how to dance, when they\nshould be at the front fighting. I mean, that was the gist of it. Imagine these guys teaching horses\nto dance instead of fighting for their country. But nevertheless he -- he did protect the horses, and\n-- so Patton really is the liberator of the Lipizzaners. And that\u2019s the Disney story. Now Disney\nhad the whole thing --",
        "A: -- brought together, you know, and there was fighting and -- and that -- there was resistance,\nand -- but not really, 1t was a very peaceful operation, but a great adventure. And the sequel was\nthat my pattern of circles again, is that 50 years later, my wife and I were in Vienna, were going\nto Vienna and wanted to go to the Spanish riding school, to see a performance there. And we had\nour youngest son Brian with us. And we couldn\u2019t get any tickets. It was the opening\nperformance, September 12\" and they were all sold out. Nobody could get me any tickets. And\nconsequently, I had a photograph and I brought some of the photographs with me of Colonel\nPotisky and myself shaking hands, with a Lipizzaner standing next to us. So I -- very brash, I\nwrote a letter to Colonel Potisky, commandant of the Spanish riding school in Vienna, Austria\nand I included that picture. And told him, you know, this is me, and [indecipherable] the incident\nof our -- our -- our visit and said that I was trying to get tickets for the opening performance and\nif he could possibly help me I would appreciate it, etcetera. I didn\u2019t hear from him until about a\nweek before we left for Europe on our vacation trip. I got a letter from the Spanish riding school,\nnot from Colonel Potisky, saying that he had retired, he\u2019s on a trip around the world, my letter\nhad caught up with him in Paris. And they had tickets for the three of us to come to the Spanish\nriding school performance, and I should pick them up in the -- before 11 o\u2019clock on the\nperformance on that day. And sure enough, we stayed at the Sarka hotel, and that morning I went\nto -- I had this -- the whole [indecipherable] where the school performs, there\u2019s a big line of\npeople standing in line to buy tickets for standing room only because they\u2019re sold out. But you\ncould buy tickets on the day of the performance to stand. Well, only -- only time in my life I\u2019ve\never crashed a line. I went to the front, got a lot of dirty looks, but I presented the letter from\ncolonel -- from that Spanish riding school and sure enough they had tickets for me. Had to pay\nfor them, they weren\u2019t free. I paid for the tickets, went back hotel, got Winnie and our -- our son,\nand then at 11 o\u2019clock we went back for the performance. And as we came in there to present our\ntickets, the usher looked at the tickets and held up his hand and motioned to somebody who took\nus in a direction different from where everybody else was going. And I thought there\u2019s a mistake\nmade, and we -- our tickets aren\u2019t any good. But instead they took us to the royal box, and we\nhad the perf -- we sat in there, in the royal box of the Spanish riding school. That was a big, big\nthrill.",
        "A: And when the horses came in in the opening, they all come in single file, 16 of them, and they\ncome right toward the royal box, and they -- simultaneously the riders tip their hats. And\neverybody thought we must be somebody very important. That was a thrilling moment.",
        "A: And that was -- and that\u2019s 50 years after this particular incident, so it had a special meaning.\nThat -- that\u2019s the Lipizzaner story.",
        "A: The war is over, in fact the war ended, unbeknownst to me at the time, this unit of the dienst\nstella ost, Colonel Holters and two of his officers -- we decided to send them to Augsburg, and\nthen from Augsburg to our special service sta -- our own detailed interrogation center, our own\nservice station in the Ardenst, in Revan. And meanwhile my driver and I headed back to Revan,\nand I continued on that particular project for about a week or so in Revan, of Colonel Holters and\n-- and his staff. And 1t was a wonderful time because we got back the day the war ended, got\nback into Revan. And the next day we had a victory parade, full dress uniform, just my unit,\n6824DIC, we had a drummer who played the drum, no -- no band, orchestra, and an American\nflag, and we got all dressed up, officers and enlisted men, and we had a parade right through\nRevan, and th-the French people cheering us on, viva |\u2019Amerique. And it was a great -- a great\nvictory. And the next week or two I had a wonderful time going down to Rans for the opera, and\ninterrogating -- finishing the job of Colonel Holters. Then we ran into trouble cause our war\ndepartment wasn\u2019t interested in having that information about Soviet Union, cause that was our -\n- they were our allies. And so there was a resistance. And then the fact my commanding officer\nwas -- supposedly I heard, reprimanded for either -- either -- for even gathering this information.\nBut you probably know the name Bob Lovitt, and Bob Lovitt was a deputy secretary of state, I\nbelieve at the time. And he used his influence and eventually Colonel Holters, the two officers,\nand all the documents we -- we captured in the Bohemian forest were brought to this secret\nlocation here in Washington. And that\u2019s the end of that relationship, that\u2019s all I knew about. My\ncommanding officer called me in and said I had a new assignment, and our detailed interrogation\ncenter was going to be dissolved and I was going to go to a place that he had never heard of\nbefore, and that\u2019s Mondorf, Luxembourg. Meanwhile, I had made one trip to Luxembourg on a\nspecial assignment to go back and see if I could locate any of my family. So this transfer to\nLuxembourg came as a real surprise. In fact, I had -- I had no idea there were even Americans\nstationed in Luxembourg. I assumed, of course, but I hadn\u2019t pursued that. So that was a real\nassignment, to get back into Luxembourg. And that assignment was to the central prisoner of war\nenclosure number 32, which was also coded in our orders as Ashcan. That was the code word\nthat they used, send us to the place. And that\u2019s all I knew about it. I had no idea what the place\nwas, what it was used for or what I\u2019d be doing. All I know is I was transferred. The good news\nwas that my best friend and colleague, Malcolm Hilkey, with whom I had been at -- at-at -- in\nVienna, and -- and in Paris, and also at Revan, was going to the same place. And my\ncommanding officer would be Captain Sensnik, whom I had met at Camp Richie, Maryland. So I\nwould be with old friends and -- and ready for whatever they had in store for me. So I arrived in\nLuxembourg, my second visit, this time on official assignment. There was a lot of talk when the\nwar ended that we were now going to go to the far east in military intelligence, and I anticipated\nthat that\u2019s probably what would happen to me. But instead I was sent to Luxembourg, which to\nme was a miracle, and which shouldn\u2019t have happened that way, but I didn\u2019t question it. So I\narrived in Mondorf. I knew Mondorf because I had gone there with my brother Heinrich who 1s\nmarried, when I was still in Luxembourg as a boy. And he and his wife had taken me to Mondorf\non occasion. There was a little train called the Jongelly that went from Luxembourg city to\nMondorf, for people who went there, this resort, Mondorf was a -- a spa, mineral water and\nhealth resort health spa. And I knew the place that I was assigned to, that was the palace hotel.\nFour story hotel casino, with gambling tables and the works. And guest rooms, and all of the\nfacilities for casino for -- for a health resort. So I reported there and then I found it -- it had\nchanged quite a lot from what I remember as a boy. A fence around it, Klieg lights overheard,\ncamouflage material, and [indecipherable] hanging, you know, you couldn\u2019t see what was going\non inside. There were machine gun towers on each of the four corners of this fenced in area. And\nthere was a roving guard, a Jeep, military police riding around, I think, constantly. And all I\nknew is I been transferred to CCPW number 32, I didn\u2019t know what was -- what was going on\ninside there. So I asked the sergeant of the guard in the Jeep, say what\u2019s going on here? And hi --\nhis answer is very typical of sergeant of the guard, he said, th-the -- \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been\nhere three weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been inside. All I know is to get in here you have to have\na pass signed by God, and somebody has to verify the signature.\u201d So that aroused my curiosity,\nbut I had the right papers, and they let me in, they -- I was expected. There was a\nnoncommissioned officer in the lobby of the hotel when I walked in, and he read my orders, and\nsigned me to my room. He said, \u201cThis is where you\u2019re going to live, and that\u2019s also where you\u2019re\ngoing to work.\u201d And I asked him, \u201cWhat kind of a place is this?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s an\ninterrogation center, it\u2019s a wa -- interrogating prisoners of war.\u201d So I assumed this is continuation\nof what we\u2019ve been doing at the -- at Revan, at DIC. So as I was in -- in the process of unpacking\nmy belongings in my room, which was rather sparsely furnished, but comfortable. And I heard a\nknock on the door, and I thought this is one of other officers coming in to introduce himself. So I\nopened the door, and before me stood none other than Herman Goering, the Reichsmarshall of\nthe Third Reich. So I was the most surprised person in the world, and stood there with my mouth\nopen. He clicked his heels and says, \u201cGoering, Reichsmarshall.\u201d So I asked him to step inside.\nHe was carrying a pair of trousers and he said, \u201cThis an extra pair of trousers.\u201d I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand this, but he, in a smirking fashion -- he had a way of delivering his lines with a smirk\non his face. He said, \u201cWell, I wanted to be a model prisoner, and several days ago we were\ndeclassified. We are now ordinary prisoners of war. And we only permitted a certain amount of\nclothing. And I overlooked this particular pair of trousers. I didn\u2019t want to get in trouble, so I\nwant to turn them in to you.\u201d Well, I -- I wasn\u2019t quite in tune with what he was leading up to, and\nthen 1t suddenly dawned on me that he needed an excuse to come and see me and I think he was\nsacrificing an extra pair of trousers for an excuse. I didn\u2019t know anything about the operation yet,\nbut it ma -- was made clear to me later on. What he wanted to know is he wanted to know who I\nwas. He fancied himself the -- the leader of the group that was imprisoned. And I didn\u2019t know\nwho they were, but I knew now that one of them was Goering. So it was his business to find out\nwho the newcomers, who the arrivals were. And he had seen me coming in through the gate, so\nhe followed procedure and came to see me, using the trousers as an excuse. And then he asked\nme, \u201cWhat is your particular assignment here? You\u2019re a young man, what are you doing here?\u201d I\nwas 26 at the time. And before I could answer him, he said, \u201cAre you by any chance the welfare\nofficer, who would see to it that we all get treated properly, in accordance with the rules of\nGeneva convention?\u201d So I was just going to say no, I\u2019m an interrogation officer, but when he\nsuggested I might be the welfare officer, I said, \u201cOh yeah, I\u2019m going to see to it that you get\ntreated properly,\u201d and he was satisfied. So he then started a list of complaints. And he was\nunhappy with the way he was brought here, that he was --",
        "A: Well he had -- he had decided then -- well, I had decided, rather, that I would see to it that\nthey would all get a square deal. And he lodged his cam -- ki -- campaign of complaints about he\nwas supposed to go to -- go into exile. He had brought with him 11 suitcases, with all of his\nuniforms and decorations and his Reichsmarshall baton, all his belongings. And he, after all, was\nthe head of the German state, successor to Hitler and he was going to go to -- into exile like\nNapoleon or any head of state. Instead they brought him to this very meager hotel, with a folding\narmy cot, straw mattress, and he was very unhappy with that whole arrangement. And I said well\nI knew nothing about that. And that ended our conversation, he clicked his heels and bowed and\nleft. That evening at five o\u2019clock, I was to report to my commanding officer, to Captain Sensnik.\nAnd I was a first lieutenant at that time. And I reported to Captain Sensnik and I told him that I\nhad a visitor. I told him of this particular visit from Goering. And Captain Sensnik, \u201cThat\u2019s\ngreat,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s your cover.\u201d He said, \u201cEvery one of us needs a cover, and by the way, use\na different name, don\u2019t use your name. You still have relatives in Europe, brothers and sisters,\nand we don\u2019t know what\u2019s ahead, but most of us are using different names, so pick a name.\u201d\nWell, I picked a n -- a name of a -- a good Luxembourg name, Gellen. Said, \u201cOkay, Pll be John\nGellen.\u201d He said, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s your name from now on. All your orders, everything you get will\nbe in the name of John Gellen. And you pretend to be the welfare officer. You visit all the\nprisoners, listen to what they have to say, keep a file of what you hear, and we\u2019ll coordinate that\nwith our interrogation reports. So yi -- ni -- that\u2019s your job from now on, that\u2019s your cover.\u201d\nThen he explained to me that all the prisoners were on the third and fourth floor, some two in a\nroom, some single rooms. The second floor was a buffer zone, nothing was happening on that\nfloor. The first floor, where we were -- we were billeted in our sleeping rooms and also our\nworking offices, but we were trying to find private billets outside of the compound so we could\ngo home at night after work, so we wouldn\u2019t be in the same building with the prisoners. The\nground floor was a dining room, where the prisoners would eat, a lounge where they could read,\nunder supervision. If they wore glasses, their glasses were kept on the rack in the lounge, they\nweren\u2019t allowed to take their glasses upstairs. Danger of suicide. They might break their glasses\nand cut their wrists, as some of them had tried to do. There was a veranda around the front of the\nhotel where they could sit and sunbathe. They could actually walk in the garden, a nice little\ngarden. But they had to stay within a barb wire enclosure and there\u2019s an electric -- electric wire. I\nhad a picture of that, by the way, of the electric wire, with a German sign warning high voltage\nso they wouldn\u2019t beyond that. And of course there was a machine gun tower. Now I have my\nown theory of why we had this heavy guard around the place. None of these people is going to s\n-- going to escape. W-We didn\u2019t have to worry about that. We had to worry about the people on\nthe outside who might want to get at them. So they were more defense, and guard were more to\nprotect them from the outside and keep them alive and in good shape for the trials, than\notherwise. Each room was equipped with a folding army cot, straw mattress, two or three GI\nblankets, a four legged stool and a bucket of water, and a cake of Lifebuoy soap. The --",
        "A: Lifebuoy, the original Lifebuoy. The kind your mother put in your mouth when you used a\ndirty word. That was the offi -- the official issue, a deodorant soap. There were no doorknobs on\nthe doors because they could use the screws to -- use the sc -- the sharp end of a screw if they\nwanted to hurt themselves. The flush toilet were the kind with the tank above and the chain, that\nwas removed. The chain was removed cause they might use the chain. They were not pu --\npermitted to wear belts, neckties, shoestrings -- which was a real problem. How to keep them in\ntheir shoes if they wore hightops without shoestrings. We had to get special permission and they\nwere allowed four inch shoestrings so they could at least tie the top two holes together. It\u2019s kind\nof humorous and they made much of that when they exercised a little -- a little sense of humor.\nThey had absolute freedom to move within the hotel. This is how Goering came to my room. He\ncould see who was going where and follow and knock on the door. This was by design. This --\nthis helped to stimulate communication. It allowed them to visit each other, they could go to each\nother\u2019s rooms and get involved in discussions and arguments, and get mad at each other and we\nbenefited from that. That was part of our technique of gathering information. What did one\nprisoner say about the other prisoner, especially if he was mad at him. This --",
        "A: Yes -- we --",
        "A: -- We -- we -- we -- we took advantage of their mutual -- of their -- the way they\ncommunicated with I -- who spoke to whom, and who snubbed whom, because we would then\nplay that guy off with a -- against the other one and -- and get information out of him.",
        "A: It was very effective. We -- we did -- we didn\u2019t use any what we now consider modern\ninterrogation [indecipherable] like recordings. There were no secret tapes, definitely no torture\ndevises, I mean we didn\u2019t -- thumbscrews or any kind of torture device. We didn\u2019t need it. They\nwere all willing to talk, a-and they\u2019re quite willing to talk.",
        "A: First of all, the more they were interrogated, the more important they were, because if -- if\nyou had a lot of interrogations, in the eyes of the other prisoners, the enemy considered you a\ndecision maker, you were obviously one of the top men. If you were not interrogated at all,\nwhich was true of some of the people, I don\u2019t know why we had them, I mean, they shouldn\u2019t\nhave been there. Nobody knew who they were. But they had a uniform on and they happened to\nbe at the wrong place at the right time and were taken prisoner, cause they had a title, or they\nwere with somebody, if they were in the presence of Goering. Like his -- his adjutant, or his aid.\nThey were all taken prisoner, unfortunately because they happened to be Goering\u2019s aid, but they\nhad no intelligence value, and they were not permitted to continue to be his aid. They just\nbecame ordinary prisoners of war. So we -- we had prisoners who -- who -- who just -- we didn\u2019t\nknow why they were there, and they didn\u2019t know why they were there, and they wanted to be\ninterrogated so they could -- they could at least feel that they were important. That was one\nthing. The other thing was none of these prisoners presented themselves as a unit, a -- a -- none\nof them worked as part of a team, a united effort to protect each other. They were all protecting\nonly themselves. Not a single one ever thought in terms of protecting the German general\u2019s staff,\nor protecting the -- the Nazi element, or the bureaucracy, the bureaucrats whom we had. And\nthose were the three categories that automatically they divided themselves into. The general\u2019s\nstaff pretty much stuck together socially in the prison, in their -- their discussion groups and their\ncliques. Excuse me. When they sat on the veranda or in the lounge, or when they ate together,\nthey pretty much stuck together, and the Nazis pretty much stuck together. And the same thing\nwith the statesmen or the ministers and some of those. So each one was out to save his own neck.\nAnd they had grievances that went back to Hitler\u2019s time, back to 1934 - \u201935. If Goering snubbed\nthis particular general, this general now had an opportunity to spill the beans about Goering.\nPetty stuff, but this 1s exactly what we wanted -- w-we wanted to hear. So the socializing with\neach other and visiting with each other was all part of a interrogation scheme. We had a conflict\nof our own, cause on one hand, there were five of us, five interrogators. And we belonged to the\nRichie crowd, we were the trained military intelligence personnel. We had nothing to do with the\noperation of the prison, of how the prisoners were fed, or how they were housed or anything else.\nThat was under the command of the -- of Colonel Andrews, Burton C. Andrews, of the 391\"\nanti-tank battalion -- were his personnel. Andrews actually was brought into this job in charge of\nthis detention center from a -- a prisoner of war -- not a prisoner of war enclosure, but a regular\nprison -- what do you call it? A prison camp. For military prison camp, American prisoners. He\nwas in charge of -- of a prison camp. So he was a trained military warden, and he was in charge\nof this prison. We had f -- about 40 or so ordinary German soldiers who were ordinary prisoners\nof war. They were the cadre, the work cadre. They we -- they did the manual labor. The prisoners\ndidn\u2019t do their own cooking or serving of the food or cleaning up, except their rooms, they had to\nclean their own rooms. But they didn\u2019t run the sweepers, or -- or do the dusting or anything in\nthe public rooms. So we had German soldiers who were carpenters, electricians, cooks, bakers,\neven the chaplain, a doctor. Most anything we needed to run a prison. But these were ordinary\nGerman prisoners who were now in a position to be associated with the -- what they called the\nbunsin, the big animals who had run the -- the dictatorship under Hitler\u2019s regime. Was quite a --\nthat interplay was very interesting to watch. Well then we had the prison guards, the Americans,\nwho supervised all of this, who directed the German PW, who were the work cadre. And they\nwere responsible for the security and -- and everything else. Now Colonel Andrews came from a\nregular detention center, from a prison. We had difficulty convincing him that these were not\npeople who were being punished. They were people who were being interrogated in preparation\nfor a trial. And that we needed them in pretty good physical condition and good mental condition\nin order to get their cooperation while we interrogated them. But he looked upon them as\ncriminals. And he was the -- the prison warden. So if they didn\u2019t exactly behave as he thought\nthey should, like if they didn\u2019t have their room very clean, then he would put them in solitary\nconfinement. They\u2019d stay in a basement for 24 hours, or maybe two days if their shoes weren\u2019t\nshined properly. And we\u2019d say that doesn\u2019t help our interrogation, because if they get mad and\nresentful, then they won\u2019t cooperate with us. So we had that interplay, so -- and we finally had to\ngo pretty high up, as high as Wild Bill Donovan, the commanding general of the -- what was\nthen the OSS, who was our mentor. He is the one who coached us on how to get information out\nof the prisoners, he was a -- an expert in that kind of thing. And Donovan then had to use his\ngeneral rank to get Colonel Andrews to cooperate with the idea that this was a -- a processing\ncenter, not a center for punishment.",
        "A: Right.\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Andrews, yeah.",
        "A: Well, he treat -- as far as he was concerned, they were prisoners of war. And one of my jobs --\nAndrews took a personal liking to me, primarily because I knew my way around Luxembourg.\nSo whenever we had a VIP visitor like General Eisenhower, or -- or any one of the higher\nofficials who came to visit, I would be ap -- appointed tour guide. So that became one of my\nfunctions. In addition to what I had to do, I would take them around Luxembourg and show them\nplaces. Well, Andrews enjoyed that part of it himself because he would always go along and --\nand I\u2019d on a couple of occasions invited Prince Felix, who liked American bourbon. And\nbourbon was just not available anywhere, except as we got it in our liquor ration in Mondorf. So\nevery once in awhile, on Saturday nights, the few of us officers would get together and have a\nlittle party, and we invited Prince Felix to a couple of these affairs, which impressed Colonel\nAndrews very much. So we finally got around to the point of where he saw our viewpoint in\naddition to the official persuasion he got from above. You know, we can\u2019t treat these people like\nconvicted criminals serving their sentences. We have to try them first, and before we can try\nthem, we had to interrogate them, and -- and that public relations effort helped considerably. It\nalso resulted in my being at Nuremberg when I had done everything possible to avoid going to\nNuremberg, cause I was tired of the whole thing. But once I arrived there on temporary duty,\nAndrews snagged me and he wouldn\u2019t let me go because he wanted me back on his staff again.\nSo it had its -- its pluses and minuses. But he used me also to translate his messages to the -- the\nprisoners whenever -- for instance, when Streicher arrived, Doenitz refused on behalf of the other\nprisoners, to eat in the same dining room with Streicher. Well then Andrews wrote a message to\nbe delivered to them, and I -- of course I translated that and read the message to the prisoners and\n-- which we told them it -- you have no choice. I mean, he\u2019s your boy and you\u2019re going to eat\nwith him whether you like it or not, cause you\u2019re all alike. We\u2019re not looking at you as a grand\nadmiral, or you as a Reichsmarshall. We\u2019re looking at you as a declassified prisoner of war, and\nthat\u2019s what Streicher is, and you\u2019re going to eat in the same dining room, and that was it. That --\nthat\u2019s the kind of message that Andrews enjoyed delivering and -- and always -- he had a riding\ncrop that he carried all the time. High polished boots, polished helmet, he was sort of a spittin\u2019\nimage of General Patton when it came to dress and bearing and he loved to play the commanding\nofficer, which sometimes the Nazis u-used against all of us in a humorous sense. For instance,\none general, I forget what his name was, had not -- Andrews came walking into the room and --\nand the general didn\u2019t stand up and click his heels, so he was punished and he was put in the\nbasement room which Andrews kept for solitary confinement. And then he wrote an order that\nwhenever he walked into a room they were to stand up at attention and -- and salute him. Well,\nthey carried it to the other extreme so whenever any one of us entered the room they did the\nsame thing. And it got to be sort of humorous, here I was a first lieutenant and if they were all\nsitting on the vera -- veranda in the afternoon, about 30 or 40 of these guys, and I would come\nback from lunch and walk it up -- they would all stand up and click their heels and bow, and say\ngood afternoon Herr [indecipherable] you know. And it got to be a joke until they got tired of it,\nbut we had a -- light moments with them too. But we did convince Andrews finally to let us do\nour -- our thing, as long as the prisoners didn\u2019t violate any of the rules he\u2019d go along with it, but\nthat was one of the challenges. Other than that, our interrogation technique, as I said, was one of\n-- in my particular case I was the welfare -- I pretended to be the welfare officer. Well, I was the\nwelfare officer because I made the rounds. I would go from room to room and I would ask the\nprisoner how -- how are you today, and at first they were very busy writing letters to General\nEisenhower, to President Truman, to -- you know, they were heads of state, or former heads of\nstate. And they were complaining about their treatment and making demands. And our job was to\ntranslate those letters, send them -- send them out through channels. And we never got any\nreplies, I assume they\u2019re still going through channels. But -- so if they had a letter that they\nwanted to write to someone, they would give it to me to translate for them, and send it on. Or if\nthey wanted to locate their family. You know, I -- I don\u2019t know where my wife is, could you try\nto find out where she is? And we would, which is very simple thing because for instance, a lot of\nthem lived -- th-the Nazi -- I always refer to them as the bunsin, the big -- the big boys -- a lot of\nthe Nazi leaders, they had a tendency to cluster. Ma-Many of them had their villas at Tegernsee\nin Bavaria. So if Kesserling wanted to locate his wife the last time he heard from her, we could\ncontact a military unit of ours stationed near Tegernsee and ask them to investigate. And we got\nto the point where we could sometimes forward letters. And that helped tremendously in getting\ntheir cooperation and telling me things that -- that we wanted to hear. So I would make the\nrounds and -- and somebody would say, I don\u2019t have any toothpaste, could you get me a -- an\nextra ration of toothpaste, shampoo, or I have a dandruff problem. Goering had a skin problem\nand he always -- he wanted special lotions and special soaps, which we couldn\u2019t furnish, but at\nleast I listened to his complaints and -- and by listening and sympathizing with him, that -- that\nhelped pave the way. What happened then was that every one of us had a specialty. I really\nspecialized in the German general\u2019s staff. The history of the German general\u2019s staff, and so forth.\nSo a lot of my interrogations were of the high ranking generals, based on military strategies and\norganization and so forth. With the result that each one of the five of us would have only a\ncertain number of prisoners under their jurisdiction and they wouldn\u2019t get to know anything\nabout any of the others. Well, I was the welfare officer, so I got to meet a lot of them, even\nthough I never interrogated them. But I would g-go in and chat with them, ho-how are you doing,\nhow do you feel? And I would end up getting a lot of information that helped my performance,\nbecause I kept this gossip file about one s -- prisoner said about the other. But one in particular\nstands out, was old Papa Schwartz, Franz Xavier Schwartz, was called Papa Schwartz. He was\nthe Nazi party treasurer. Simple, kind old guy, really. He didn\u2019t know what the score was. But he\nwas a very popular politician in Bavaria and Hitler used him to collect the dues. If you belong to\nthe Nazi party, you paid yo-your party dues. And that\u2019s all Schwartz did, he collected dues. And\nnow you think Nazi party treasurer would have been a very important guy, who certainly would\nhave a lot to do with buying property and -- and receiving big contributions. That wasn\u2019t\nSchwartz\u2019s job, that was somebody else\u2019s responsibility. That was Funk, and to a certain extent\nat first, Schacht. So Schwartz, I don\u2019t even know why we -- we brou -- he was never\ninterrogated. He really served no particular purpose. And his son, Franz Xavier Schwartz, jr. was\nthe president of German breweries, which really had no particular connection, but he did have a -\n- a paramilitary rank in th -- either the SS or the SA. A lot of people, if you made a big\ncontribution financially, if you were an industrialist, you would got a -- get a rank like a\nsturmbondfuhrer in the SS, which was nothing more than an honorary title, and 1 -- and you\ncould -- got to wear a uniform. So if you were president of the breweries, you could wear a\nuniform as a brigadier general in the SS, but you really had nothing to do in the SS. But it did put\nhim in the automatic arrest category, because everybody who was an SS officer was\nautomatically arrested by us. So we ended up with a lot of these deadbeats. Well, Schwartz\nlooked very much like my father, physical image. My father had sort of a white mustache, little\n[indecipherable] like Hindenburg. And Schwartz looked like my father and the first time I went\nin to see Schwartz, I was taken aback because it looked almost like my own papa sitting there.\nAnd he noticed that and wanted to know what -- you know, what made you -- he said --\nupshraken was the German word, la -- what made you pull back. And just in a moment of candor\nI said, \u201c\u201cW-Well, because you look very much like my father.\u201d And then I showed him a picture\nof my father. And he -- he started to cry, he got -- he -- he got very emotional about that. He th --\nhe thought that was just a wonderful coincidence. He\u2019s -- he\u2019s a Roman Catholic, he was very\ndevout, and he thought surely that God had ordained for this to happen. Well, I -- I had to take\nadvantage of that because all the other prisoners kind of looked upon ov -- Schwartz as almost a\nfather confessor. And they would go to Papa Schwartz and tell him things that they didn\u2019t tell\nanybody else, especially after an -- an interrogation. They were going to Papa Schwartz and say,\nwell they asked me about this, but I told them that, but the truth of the matter is. Well then, after\nI showed -- after wa -- won the confidence of Papa Schwartz, I could go to him, he\u2019d say, don\u2019t\ntrust so and so. And he would -- he would tell me things about what the prisoner had said to him.\nAnd it was that kind of play that -- that resulted in our getting more information than we really\nknew how to cope with, in addition to our official interrogation. We worked for the Nazi war\ncrimes commission, which was headed by Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, who was to be\nour prosecutor for the United States. And they were located in Paris. And -- and this was his\nstaff, th-the general, General Telford Taylor, and Colonel Amon and others who were the\nassistant prosecutors. And they would make up questionnaires, what they wanted to know about\na certain prisoner. They were preparing the case for the prosecution against, say Karl Doenitz,\nGrand Admiral Doenitz. So they had questions about him. Was he present when this particular\ntreaty was signed? Was he there when -- at the Wannsee conference when the final solution was\ndecided on? And then we would get those questionnaires, and then we would have a staff\nmeeting. And Captain Sensnik would say, okay, we have a questionnaire on Doenitz, Dolibois,\nyou -- you handle that one. And then I would -- I would get that questionnaire and then I would\nprepare my interrogation of Doenitz, the intent being to get the answers to those questions, but --\nbut building it around a autobiographical sketch sort of thing. And these were very fascinating\nbecause the prisoner would brag about his accomplishments, what he had done and everything.\nAnd in the course of that you could work in the pas -- specific questions that colonel -- Justice\nJackson wanted answered for his staff. And this is what made the -- it\u2019s kind of a -- a -- an\ninteresting challenge, an interrogation. Well that was the job of each interrogator. We\u2019d\ninterrogate and sometimes it would go on for a week, you\u2019d do nothing but interrogate one\nprisoner, then spend the afternoon writing up your report.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That\u2019s the wor -- no, that\u2019s the worst thing you could do.",
        "A: Psychologically you would -- they would freeze up, ooh, he\u2019s writing that down. I\u2019m not\ngoing to tell him that, that\u2019s going to go on a record. Conversation is what they really wanted to\nknow. And -- and they would just -- a -- this meant -- this is why I said 1t\u2019d go on for a week,\nbecause you\u2019d interrogate maybe for an hour, and then you spend two or three hours putting\ntogether what you -- you had. Part of our training was to pick out pertinent facts to remember, to\nput down in our -- in our reports. Sometimes we\u2019d take a break and then quickly jot down the\nthings that I want to remember and then continue the interrogation, and then from the jotted\nnotes later. But if you sat there with a pencil and asked questions, they freeze, and they would --\nbut if they could just go on and -- and ex -- expound on what they had accomplished, and I did\nthis and I did that and thanks to me this was done. And that\u2019s the sort of thing we were\nencouraging.",
        "A: Well, they knew it -- first of all, they didn\u2019t believe if they were anything but prisoners of\nwar. To tell them, you\u2019re going to have a trial, and you\u2019re going to be tried, that is something that\n-- that was ri -- in the book. There\u2019s nothing in the Geneva Convention or the Warsaw Treaty\nthat says if you lose the war and you\u2019re arrested and you become a prisoner, you might be tried\nfor your crimes. I mean, what -- what is a war crime? That had never been decided until the\nNuremberg trial. And then it isn\u2019t quite clear. Look what we\u2019re doing now. I mean, nobody really\nknows what a war crime is. This -- this business in The Hague going on now with international\ncriminal court, they haven\u2019t defined a war crime as yet. When somebody in Bosnia, a Serb, rapes\na -- a Muslim woman, is that a war crime? Or is it a crime against humanity? What international\ncourt 1s going to try that per -- well, these are the -- the philosophical, legal things that hadn\u2019t\ncome up. So these people didn\u2019t expect to be tried. They were prisoners of war, special prisoners\nof war because of their high rank in -- in the government, or -- and therefore sometimes they\nwould tell you things that they wished they hadn\u2019t told you when they finally went to trial. The\ntrial in itself really wasn\u2019t decided, the specifics of it, until an agreement was reached I think\nsometime in July or August of 1945. Back in May when we were beginning to interrogate these\nmen, nobody knew that there was going to be a trial, per se. We knew that something was going\nto happen.",
        "A: But we had to get a lot more information before that decision could be reached. And that was\nreally the function of the detention center Ashcan in Luxembourg, to sort of gather information\nto assist the prosecuting staff in developing a case --",
        "A: -- which then would be s -- like a grand jury, yes? A crime has been committed, so now this\nperson is going to be tried for it. A-And that is the -- the function. And we were the investigators\nfor the so-called grand jury, the war crimes commission. Now in my case, in addition to getting\nthese interrogation, I would -- I would go around and -- and collect gossip of what\n[indecipherable] and do them little favors, you know, if -- if the shoestring broke, I\u2019d get them\nanother shoestring. Just little simple things, little toothpaste, a -- or if they had a problem, you\nknow, I\u2019ve a got a toothache, I\u2019d arrange for the dentist to see them, and -- and in that way they -\n- they just started talking. Never -- no, I shouldn\u2019t say never, seldom, about themselves, when it\ncame to I\u2019m guilty of this, or I\u2019m guilty of that, or -- I knew about concentration camps, for\ninstance. But they would say, oh, Dachau, yeah, there was a place like -- ask so and so. He was\ninvolved in that, a-and -- you know, this was the kind of leads that would help us in our\ninterrogation. So our summer travail -- travails in -- in Luxembourg was primarily to get to know\nthe prisoners, their character, their personalities, which would help the prosecutors in developing\ntheir approach when they tried them, and also for historical purposes. We had a lot of historic\nwar cri -- war department commissioned historians who wanted to interrogate these prisoners. So\nmany times we would have a -- a professor from the Hoover Institute or some other think tank,\nwho was working on a particular aspect of the war history that would come and we would\ninterrogate on their behalf, they would sit in on it, but they couldn\u2019t speak German. And we\nwould interrogate the prisoner, and get the information they wanted for their historical prese --",
        "A: We tell them the truth. Say this man is an historian --",
        "A: -- and he\u2019s writing the history of the tank --",
        "A: -- as used by the German command. A-And the -- the tactics that Rommel used in -- in Africa,\nor Goodarian in his tank warfare. And oh yes, they\u2019II tell you all about that.",
        "A: Yeah, because it -- it -- they could -- this is how they were important. They could build up\ntheir own importance. It\u2019s -- you get that once in awhile in a crime that is committed where the\ncriminal is willing to brag about how many people he has killed, or how many banks he has\nrobbed, because this is the way he builds up his own ego.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, at -- we had, altogether I think, total, we -- we kept a -- a daily roster of the newcomers\narrivals. Gains -- gains and losses we called them. And the -- and the total number of German\nprisoners who came through this process at nur -- at Luxembourg was 86. That just about\nencompasses everybody who was anybody in the Nazi regime. They would stay with us maybe a\nfew weeks. We had another place near Wiesbaden, it was called Dustbin. And somebody had a\ngood sense of humor, between Ashcan and Dustbin, I like to say we all got a lot of trash between\nAshcan and Dustbin. So somebody at -- at Wiesbaden would -- would want to interrogate a\ncertain prisoner we had in Mondorf and we -- that prisoner would be with us, and then we\u2019d se --\nAlbert Speer, for instance, Speer was traveling all over Europe because people in Paris wanted to\ninterrogate him and then he was up in Wiesbaden and then he went somewhere else, some other\ninstallation. Wherever we had a military unit working on something particularly interesting for\nthat prisoner, we\u2019d move him out. So, nevertheless, the prisoners were divided into three distinct\ncategories. We had members of the German general\u2019s staff. A field marshall -- a generale\nfieldmarshall, General Fieldmarshall Keitel, the chief of the armed forces high command, the\nequivalent to Colin Powell as the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, in that position. He was\nundoubtedly the highest ranking of the Nazi generals. And I call him a Nazi general because he\nwas a member of the general\u2019s staff who was a Nazi. He wouldn\u2019t have been the ch -- with his\nlimited ability, he would never have been the chairman or the -- not chairman, but the -- the\ncommander in chief of the armed forces high command if he hadn\u2019t been a Nazi and ardent\nHitler supporter. So we had Keitel. His deputy, Jodl, generale august Jodl, Alfred Jodl, was the\nchief of operations. Under Jodl it was Warlimont, Walter Warlimont, who was my special\nproject when I worked on the history of that German general staff. He was very cooperative. He\nwas Colonel Geito, who commanded the [indecipherable] during the Spanish revolution when\nthe German -- German army was in -- a German military was supporting Franco in -- in Spain.\nHe was a very interesting guy, spoke English fluently, had married an American girl whom he\nhad met when he was attendin -- attending our army war college in 1928, and he -- he was a very\nhelpful individual. He was present at the attempted assassination of Hitler on July 20\", \u00b044, and\nwas seriously wounded, a brain injury. So he had a medical discharge, which saved him from\nbecoming one of the people -- probably he would have been tried at Nuremberg. But he got a\nmedical discharge and he was out of it after July 20\", \u201944. So a lot of the things that happened\nlater on during the war, the -- the real war crimes, the violations of -- of the Warsaw Treaty and\nGeneva Convention, u -- Warlimont was out of it. Now he was very cooperative and he helped\nus 1n -- in many ways, and I mention in my book an expedition I made with him to get an\nconnection with the history of the general\u2019s staff, and -- and Warlimont was -- was a big help to\nme in gathering information. And he was never tried. And in fact, he was rele -- re -- released\nafter a couple of months at Nuremberg and wasn\u2019t even around when the trials started. Well, then\nthere was General Blaskowitz, and there was von Woonstadt, leader of the Battle of the Bulge,\nvon Blumberg, a former chief of staff. These were members of the German general staff, career,\nhigh ranking, elite. In some cases men of principle because they belonged to the highest social\nclass you but -- you could belong to in Germany, the ger -- genralshtapper, that was it. But with a\nfew exceptions, they were not necessarily in sympathy with the Nazi way of doing things, at least\nas far as we could tell. I don\u2019t think we could ever link von Blumberg, who was a victim of -- of\nHitler\u2019s doings -- von Blumberg was kicked out on a manufactured story and Keitel took his\nplace because Keitel polished the apple and did what Hitler wanted. You couldn\u2019t hold those\nguys responsible for the atrocities because they really were not a part of that. [indecipherable]\nwouldn\u2019t have been tried under those circumstances. So they were very cooperative in working\nwith us, and if you did come to a point where you were discussing war crimes, or tried to weave\nthem into the atrocity aspect, their answer was always, hey, I was just a soldier. I -- I followed\ncommand. Keitel is the guy who was the -- the chief of the armed forces high command, talk to\nhim. The admirals, Grand Admiral Doenitz, who was the successor to Hitler and Grand Admiral\nRaeder, commander in chief the German navy, were part of this, they were members of the\nGerman general\u2019s staff, and they were in that category. In the second group we had what I call\nthe real Nazi trash. The leader of which, of course, would be Julius Streicher, the Jew baiter, who\nprided himself of being a racist. And he, to the very end he was beating his chest with pride, I\u2019m\n-- I\u2019m the leading racist, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m a [indecipherable] he called himself a [indecipherable]\nminister. Hasa, the word -- German for hate, and rasa, the word for race, of course, y-you could\njust see that in -- in Streicher right from the beginning. Streicher, gaolighter Franconia, publisher,\neditor, pornographic anti-Semitic newspaper, Der Sturmer. Robert Ley, Labor front leader, who\nsucceeded in strangling himself before the trials began. Leader of the arbeitsfront, the German\nlabor front. You couldn\u2019t get a job in Germany without belonging to the labor front. Fritz\nSauckel, who was the procurement officer for bringing in slave labor to work in Albert Speer\u2019s\nfactories and mines and munitions industries and to build up the war machine and maintain it\nduring the war. Arthur Seyss-Inquart, who betrayed Austria, later became the military governor\nof the Netherlands. Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader. Hans Frank, the butcher of\nPoland, governor general of Poland, who was willing to admit that he signed the documents\nresponsible for the execution of more than two and a half million Jews in -- in Auschwitz and\nBirkenau and the other camps in Poland, for which he had the responsibility. And in this\nparticular case, confessed it, admitted it. Let\u2019s see, in that category were men like Kaltenbrunner,\nErnst Kaltenbrunner, the successor to the hangman Heydrich, who had -- was assassinated in\nCzechoslovakia as you know. I mentioned Hans Frank --",
        "A: -- some others come --",
        "A: Oh yeah, wi -- Alfred Rosenberg, of course, the Nazi philosopher. Hess would have been in\nthat category, but of course he sat in prison in England and didn\u2019t join us until Nuremberg. But\nhe would have been in that particular group as well. These were the ultercamfer, the old fighters\nwho helped Hitler come to power, who were with him during the putsch in 1923. And he\nreordered them with the positions of -- that had the power of life and death, the gaolighters who\ncould send people to the concentration camp without trial, send them off. They were the people\nwho had limited intelligence. Streicher had the lowest IQ.",
        "A: Julius Streicher had the IQ of 106, the lowest IQ of the 22 Nazis tried in the first session of\ntribunal. Lot of them had -- lacked even a sound education. Sauckel never went beyond the fifth\ngrade, but they had the power of life and death. They were the -- the Hitler henchmen who had\nhelped -- helped Hitler in the rise of the party. In the third category were the -- the bureaucrats,\nMeisner, Lamers, Schterlein, Selter, von Popham, Admiral [indecipherable] of Hungary. These\nwere the ministers and secretaries who ran the German government. Some of them were active\nduring the Kaiser\u2019s regime in World War I. They changed their political affiliation during the\nWeimar republic and kept their cushioned jobs. When Hitler came along, they became Nazis and\nkept their government jobs. Probably if they\u2019d been there long enough for Stalin to come along,\nthey\u2019d have become communists.",
        "A: They were opportunists. They went with whatever political wind was blowing. So when you\ntake all these people, put them under one roof, you get a real mix, and y-you -- you tend to have\na cliquish development, where they just set off in groups by themselves. And that, from the\npsychology of interrogation was very much in our favor, because we just played one off against\nthe other. We wanted to know about the generals, they told us all they knew about the Nazis.\nAnd if we wanted to know about the Nazis we asked the -- the statesmen, or vice versa, we could\n-- and in that respect they were more cooperative than we wanted them to be because it just made\nus work that much harder. I mean, the more information we got, the harder we had to work in\nwriting it all up. So --",
        "A: Definite -- definitely so. And it got to the point where just living in the same building with\nthem was a real hardship and soon, within three or four weeks after I got there, we moved out.\nAnd we would just come to work in the morning, do our interrogation, and our -- our write-ups\nand do our office work and then at five o\u2019clock go home, and -- unless we had a visitor that we\nhad an evening interrogation with a special commission coming up. A-And -- and that was\nnecessary for your own state of mind because frankly, you got -- you got tired of the smell of it\nall. It was -- even in -- in what used to be a luxury hotel, it had a prison smell, most of all\nbecause sanitary conditions weren\u2019t such that these guys could take a shower every morning, and\nthey didn\u2019t have fresh clothing to put on. You know, they were wearing, a lot of times, the\nclothes that they were taken prisoner in, and months later they\u2019re still wearing the same clothes.\nNow we did try to -- we had a prison laundry, but the laundry service wasn\u2019t exactly a resort\nhotel style. That whole atmosphere, you never really had the privacy. You couldn\u2019t just walk\nfrom my office in room 32, I couldn\u2019t just walk down a hall and go to Captain Sensnik\u2019s office\nwithout meeting one of the prisoners maybe along the way who wanted to gripe about\nsomething, or had a question about something, or who wanted something. And you kind of got\ntired of seeing them. They\u2019re under foot all the time. So we needed to get away. That definitely\nwas -- was necessary. And in my case, personally, because I was playing this role of welfare\nofficer, I was seeing more of them than the other officers were. Consequently, you had the\nwearing -- wearing thin happened a lot quicker with me, probably, than it did with the others. But\nwe all had the same feeling. If I never see another Nazi again I'll be perfectly happy. That was\nsort of the -- the slogan we all adopted there.",
        "A: Yes. Yeah, that wa -- that was the other as -- especially in cases where families who were\ninvolved. Now I did visit -- I didn\u2019t begin to visit, actually, families, until we moved out of\nLuxembourg and went to Oberhausen. And a part of the group went to Oberhausen, mostly the\ngeneral officers and then others went directly to Nuremberg. Then I went from Oberhausen to --\nexcuse me, to Nuremberg. But during that period, when I started seeing families with children,\neven Edda Goering and -- and Herman Goering would write a letter to his daughter, and I would\nread his letter to his daughter sitting on my lap, and that had to get to me, and -- but the difficulty\n-- and I think this is where our training at Richie was emphatic, on this don\u2019t get personally\ninvolved. Don\u2019t show sympathy, don\u2019t show understanding even in body language. And we were\ntrying not to agree, not to nod your head when they made one of their profound statements which\nmight make them think, he agrees with me. He would have done the same thing if he were in my\nshoes. You had to avoid giving them an opportunity to transfer their doings to you -- their -- their\nphilosophy. In other words, yeah, he may be the enemy, but he agrees with me, cause I saw him\nnod his head, or I saw him smile when I said that. So we had to learn to be very impersonal and\nstone faced, and not to let ourselves be moved by -- by what they -- they said, or what they\nsometimes did. So body language is very important in talking to them, especially someone -- I --\nI -- I like to move my hands when I\u2019m talking so it was very difficult to -- to sort of sit still and --\nand -- and just listen. Little things, like Herr Streicher, a man who couldn\u2019t talk for five minutes -\n- oh, two minutes, without becoming anti-Semitic. Every conversation would lead into his hatred\nof the Jews. Whether he thought that sometimes you felt like giving him a real argument, or even\npunching him in the mouth, because his conversation could rub you the wrong way. He was a\nfoul mouth to begin with, a-and his -- his language was just uncouth. So that was difficult to just\ntolerate. But that same man, when his wife Adele came to the prison, and I told him -- your wife\n-- now, they couldn\u2019t have visitors, and this happened in Nuremberg, not -- not in Luxembourg,\nbut I take that out of sequence here. I told him, your wife is here, what do you want me to tell\nher? And our purpose for being -- for playing this role was to get information. We wanted to\nknow more about th-the prisoner, about his family. Sometimes the wife would tell us -- tell us\nthings about his activities that he hadn\u2019t revealed, just through a short, 10 minute visit. When I\ntold him his wife was there, and that\u2019s the only time she came to visit, he gave me a message for\nher, telling me she should visit hospitals and visit the sick and do whatever she could to help any\norphan children. Well, he was obviously playing up to me. I don\u2019t --",
        "A: Streicher.",
        "A: I -- I can\u2019t believe that he really was that concerned, because if -- 1f you read my report on\nhim, he\u2019s not the kind of a guy who would worry about orphans. But then he suddenly walked up\nto me, and he put his arm on my -- my -- his hand on my arm right here. And he just held it there\nfor a moment and I didn\u2019t know what to make of this because we had no physical contact, we\nnever shook hands, and we never addressed them by their -- their titles, 1t was always Herr\nStreicher. And they very seldom knew our names, even so that they couldn\u2019t call us by name,\nunless they specifically asked, then you told them your name, but we used false names anyhow.\nBut he put his hand right here on my arm and for a moment I didn\u2019t know what to make of this,\nand he held it there. And then he stepped back and he said, \u201cWhen you see my wife, tell her to\nput her hand in the same place on your arm, so we can be -- so we can be close to each other.\u201d\nNow, that sort of thing haunts you because it comes from a man who you\u2019ve already decided,\nhard-hearted, cold, the originator of the Nuremberg Laws, his pornographic, anti-Semitic\nnewspaper. But then a gesture like that catches you completely unawares. And -- and there were\nincidents like that in their correspondence or their conversation where you -- you had to really\nsteel yourself to avoid being sympathetic or giving the impression that yeah, I think you have a\npoint. I agree with you. So --",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well actually, that aspect of it, to me personally, didn\u2019t come to light -- now, two of my\ncolleagues were Jewish, two of about five officers. And one of them had lost his -- his parents at\nAuschwitz. He knew, he -- he knew the sa -- a-and -- and the -- the tales he -- but his knowledge\nof it was limited to his own family experience. He had no idea of what --",
        "A: -- the big scope, the big picture of this was. That really did -- didn\u2019t begin develop until I got\nto Nuremberg and began to see some of the evidence --",
        "A: -- the films. German films.",
        "A: Their own films captured, and began to see some of the documents, 1 -- which -- which came\nto our intention in the course of an interrogation because questions that were given to us were\nbased on the documents that we were asked to -- the existence of which we were asked to verify,\nthe signatures which we wanted to authenticate and make -- verify as well. That\u2019s when I began\nto -- to learn the atrocities. Then after the trials began, I did have the opportunity, after I left\nNuremberg a-at my strong, urgent request -- but I did go back to Nuremberg time to time to\nfinish a project with a particular general officer, of the generale staff. And I would attend a\nsession and I would hear the evidence. For instance, this man Herse, I heard his testimony. And I\nthink that was one of the first times I really realized how vast this thing was, it -- it wasn\u2019t just\none individual\u2019s doings that led to a certain crime, or an atrocity, this is really a machine, a -- a\nwhole -- this was a government action. Thi -- this weren\u2019t just isolated incidents. And it wasn\u2019t\nuntil really the trials began that -- that that came to my -- to my attention. There\u2019s a -- a -- a very\nserious incident I mention in -- in my book, one I\u2019ve had first hand, for the very first time,\noutside of that brief exposure to Dachau, I d -- I didn\u2019t see any more evidence of the atrocities\nuntil we met a convoy and one particular incident, a convoy of seven two and a half ton trucks\nloaded with bodies being shifted from one mass grave to another. I think I point to that particular\nincident even more so than my first visit to Dachau as the -- the turning point. I realized that this\nwas more than just one crime by one man, or one adventure that one or two people participated\nin, this -- this is mass -- mass production.",
        "A: Ob no, no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, just a --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It -- 1t would depend on the individual.",
        "A: If he was an interesting person I\u2019d want to be -- spend more time with him.",
        "A: Frankly, von Ribbentrop, I found him very a -- very repulsive, very annoying. He wa -- he\nwas a -- 1-- 1-- he was a nervous wreck. He was -- annoying is a good way to put -- he got -- he\ngots on your nerves, you -- you\u2019ve met people who get on your nerves?",
        "A: Well, von Ribbentrop was that way. So if I went to see von Ribbentrop, it would be very\nbrief. And I didn\u2019t go see him regularly at all, and maybe I -- I talked to him five or six times in\nthe course of that summer --",
        "A: -- because he didn\u2019t interest me. Rosenberg was another one like that, he was a - a nervous\ntwitcher, he always had -- had something he had to fiddle with, and -- and he had all these\nnervous facial gestures. And -- and he was again somebody whose company you didn\u2019t\nparticularly enjoy or find interesting. So those people you -- you avoided, I -- I would spend\nmore time with somebody like Papa Schwartz or Warlimont. Keitel intrigued me because he was\nsuch a pompous idiot that I sort of always felt superior when I talked to Keitel. Yet, he was a\ngeneral field marshall, you know, five star general, I was just a first lieutenant, but -- [tape break,\nmusic] -- very painful it was, how he hadn\u2019t been able to sleep a wink. And I said why didn\u2019t you\ntell the guard, we had a guard, all he had to do was call th -- call the guard. He could walk out of\nhis room and tell the guard in the hall that he wanted to see the doctor. Well, he was a general\nfield marshall, he wasn\u2019t going to tell an ordinary enlisted man that he had a boil on his neck.\nHe\u2019d rather suffer all night long and wait until an officer came, so he could say officer to officer.\nWell, my reaction to that was, good, I hope the boil really gave you a pain. S-So that was a\ndifferent kind of a visitor. And then there were -- Streicher fascinated me because it was like\ngoing to a zoo and -- and watching a particularly strange animal because he\u2019s repugnant in one\nsense, but you can\u2019t take your eyes off him. I liked to spend time with Streicher, just to see him -\n- hear him rant and rave until I got bored, and then I -- I would leave him. Ley was another\ncomedian.",
        "A: Comedian. Ley was -- well, first of all, he stammered. He stammered -- he -- he stuttered\noccasionally only on a letter. Like, my name 1s ho -- h-ho -- ho -- [tape break, ad for USN] --\nlook at -- h-he would say, if I could have some of that good American whiskey, it would [speaks\nGerman here] it would loosen my tongue.",
        "A: Yeah, it -- make a smooth talker out of him.",
        "A: No, you couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I say he was a comedian. He -- he would just -- you would end\nup laughing, he would amuse you, without trying to amuse you, because he took himself very\nseriously. He felt that he -- he really was a creator, he had big ideas, and he did, but he didn\u2019t\nhave the ability to carry them out. He could fantasize and he was going to reconstruct Germany\nand bring in all the Jews that had left Germany and bring them back and make up to the Jews the\npersecution and the atrocities that we had enforced on them. And give them a chance to help\nreorganize a-and reconstruct Germany with himself in charge. And he\u2019d be willing to do it out of\nhis prison cell in Nuremberg.",
        "A: Course, he\u2019d like to have it fixed up a little bit so it\u2019d be more comfortable, but -- but he\u2019d be\nperfectly willing to --",
        "A: -- to direct the whole thing. But this sort of nonsense, he was good at. When we finally told\nhim point blank that the allied -- allied authorities were not about to accept his master plan for\nthe reconstruction of Germany, he became suicidal. And that\u2019s when we put a 24 hour guard on\nhis cell. And this is in Nuremberg now.",
        "A: But he fooled the guard and -- and he did strangle himself. And I was on duty that night. I had\nthe questionable pleasure of -- of cutting him down and calling for help, and -- and h-he had\nsucceeded in ripping the strong edge of a towel, out of which he made a noose. And then he tore\nparts of his underwear, which he stuffed in his mou -- keeping in mind he\u2019s under guard,\nsomebody\u2019s watching him, with a spotlight on him all night long. And he put the -- the fragments\nof his underwear in his mouth so he wouldn\u2019t gag, put the noose around his neck, then went to\nthe toilet. And when he sat on the toilet, only his feet would show far -- from the viewpoint of\nthe guard outside his door. Then he looped that noose over the flushpipe, stand pipe with a\nbutton on it to flush the toilet, came about yay high, and he put the noose over, and then literally\nforced himself forward and strangled himself. When the guard gave the alarm because he\u2019d been\nsitting on the toilet too long, I was the duty officer that night and I had the key to the cell. And\nwhen I opened it up, it was too late already, he was dead. Of course then we got the doctors and\neverything else. Dr. -- a Swiss -- Zukli, a Swiss doctor performed an autopsy on him and found a\n-- a damaged brain. Part of his brain was damaged, and that was the result of an -- he was a\nnavigator in airplane in the Luftwaffe in World War I, which crashed. And that really is what\nresulted in his stuttering, stammer, and also probably is -- the way his mind functioned, he just\nwasn\u2019t quite the same, so -- but -- but he was an interesting person to talk to from that standpoint,\ncause you didn\u2019t know what he was going to come up with next to get -- to provide a little levity\nin the -- the day\u2019s operations.",
        "A: But di -- he --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Nobody wanted to room with him.",
        "A: But Ley was willing to -- we called them the Bobbsey Twins.",
        "A: Ley was the only one who was sympathetic to Streicher. So Ley said that he would -- he\nwould be willing to room with Streicher. But we put Streicher at first into -- into -- on the second\nfloor where there were no other prisoners, because nobody wanted to room with him and we\ndidn\u2019t have any more room upstairs. And then Streicher indicate -- Ley indicated that he\u2019d be\nwilling to room with Streicher, so we put the two together, cause as I say, we had a purpose for\nwanting them to relate to each other, conversation-wise and everything else. Ley was very much\ntaken with Streicher, he admired him. But that feeling wasn\u2019t particularly returned on Streicher\u2019s\npart. He -- he didn\u2019t -- Streicher didn\u2019t particularly care for Ley, he -- he thought he was a\nweakling. He -- he wasn\u2019t match -- a masochist like Streicher was. Streicher was all muscle and -\n- and show off masochist. But Ley was just a direct opposite, he was a wimp. And so Streicher\nhad this tendency to look down on Ley. But that was the only one -- the only two who -- who\nwere willing to be together. And the dining room -- course they had to eat together, but they had\ndifficulty finding somebody to -- to sit with them, unless there was no place, and they -- they had\nto sit with them. But there was very little conversation between Streicher -- everybody despised\nhim. I mean, they -- they just didn\u2019t care for him, especially Goering, who was the one that filed\ncharges against him, and brought him before the court, the Nazi court, which is -- Walter Buch,\nwho was another one of our prisoners that I didn\u2019t mention. He was the chief justice of the -- of\nthe Nazi court, you know, the -- when a Nazi committed a crime against another Nazi, he was\nnot tried in a criminal court, he was tried in a Nazi court, and Walter Buch was the superior\njudge of this -- this Nazi court. Buch, incidentally, was the father-in-law of Martin Bormann,\nwho was Hitler\u2019s adjutant and the guy that pretty much spoke for Hitler and signed a lot of orders\nthat are still today being questioned as to the authenticity, did they come from Bormann or\nHitler. So Bormann was a very important guy, you know, he -- unfortunately we didn\u2019t have him\nwith us. And Buch was the father-in-law of this man, too. Another one that I didn\u2019t mention who\nwas part of that Nazi trash [indecipherable] was Wilhelm Frick, who\u2019d been sec -- Minister of\nthe Interior and was really the guy who wrote the -- the original Nuremberg laws. The -- the law\n-- the legal --",
        "A: -- phrase -- phrases themselves, so --\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He was a nonentity, I would say. And even the Nazis considered him a -- a nobody. He was\npowerful because, you know, the Minister of the Interior in Germany, even today in -- in many\nEuropean governments, is in charge of the police force, and has a lot more power than the\nSecretary of the Interior does in -- in -- comparatively in the United States. So the Minister of the\nInterior was truly a -- an important position. But once Hitler became the fuehrer, when he was --\nyou know, Hitler held three jobs. He was the fuehrer, that\u2019s the leader of the Nazi party, that was\nreally the title fuehrer, and the one that he preferred, which incidentally Streicher gave him.\nWhen they first met, in a beer hall in -- in Munich, and Streicher, who was the leader of an anti-\nSemitic faction in Nuremberg, heard about this labor party group in Munich, which was headed\nby Hitler. And he went to Munich to hear this man Hitler, about whom he had heard, speak. And\nhe describes in his testimony, he thought he actually saw a halo around his head, he thought this\nis the Messiah, this is the man who is going to ser -- s-save Germany, whereupon he went to\nHitler, and said, \u201cYou are my fuehrer. I will follow you, and everything I have is yours.\u201d In his\nfamous words. And Streicher was one of the few members of the inner party who could dootz\nHitler, address him in the familiar German du. Streicher was one of the few who cou -- even\nGoering didn\u2019t have that power, but Streicher could -- could do that. And Hitler liked that fuehrer\nbusiness, and it was Streicher, at their first meeting, who suggested it to him. And it was the\nunion of those two parties from Nuremberg and from Munich that made the -- the dare -- day ap\n-- the deutsche arbeit party of Munich a national deutsche arbeit party, because the two\ncommunities merged, thanks to Streicher, which was why Streicher was particularly dear to\nHitler, and considered him very close, and vice versa. Well, Frick was important at -- at the\nbeginning, and he was a -- I think he wanted to be the police, or he was the police commissioner\nin -- in Munich at the time of the putsch. And he was active in Hitler\u2019s political endeavors, and\nof course became one of the followers. And then he was elected to the Reichstag and Hitler\nbecame chancellor and named him Minister of the Interior. But then when Himmler came into\nthe play, and took over the Gestapo and the -- the -- the SS and all -- all the police duties and the\nsecurity services went to Himmler and Frick really had nothing to do. He -- his position was\nstrictly a -- up until beyond 1935, he -- he was really nobody. He really did -- didn\u2019t have much\nof a -- arole, and colorless, sort of a -- a gray aura about him. His whole appearance, gray hair,\ngray face and gray clothes, he -- he was just -- in a bunch of people, he would never stand out.\nEven if there were only two people in a room, he wouldn\u2019t stand out.",
        "A: He wa --",
        "A: Well, ya --",
        "A: Yeah, well, yeah -- yes --",
        "A: -- but it was legal. You see, 1-1t was -- everything he did was legal. He -- he was the -- a legal\ninterpretation. And yes, of course the Jews had to be done away with because that was the law,\nand the Nuremberg laws, and no question about it. Now, if you say, did you have anything to do\nwith the concentration camp -- which incidentally was not a question we -- I don\u2019t remember -- I\ndon\u2019t think I ever asked it of anybody, cause I really didn\u2019t know. I -- I just -- wasn\u2019t in my -- I\nthink with Streicher, it -- 1t had to come up, as I recall, o-of his -- of his own volition. Where he\nwould bring it up, but never the details, as far as people being abused or starved. The\nconcentration camp, as Streicher explained it to me, is very simple. Here were these communists,\nand these communists were causing a lot of problems -- I\u2019m giving Streicher\u2019s explanation. And\nso when the big election came along, at which time Hitler was to be the plebiscite, when Hitler\nwas to be the supreme being, the fuehrer of the political party and then the chancellor of the\nGerman Reich, which ran the government, and then the president of the German Reich, after\nHindenburg. So he was president, chancellor and fuehrer. Political, organizational and\nceremonial. So he really had three jobs under the title of fuehrer. Well, when all of this came into\nbeing, the communists had to be concentrated out of sight so that they couldn\u2019t cause any\nproblems. They were having demonstrations and disrupting political meetings, and the\ncommunists were causing problems. So they were put into school buildings and even some\nabandoned factories, as a temporary measure to concentrate them out of sight where we could\nconcentrate -- keep our eyes on them. Then, after the election, and Hitler came to power, it was\njust convenient to keep them there. It turned out that many of the communists were Jews, so it\nwas natural for those communists, and those Jews to end up in the concentration camps. But you\ncouldn\u2019t keep them in these temporary facilities, so he had to build facilities for them. And this is\nhow Dachau came into being a concentration camp, to bring these people together from the\nschool building and factories where they were tentatively kept, and put them into one camp. That\nof course was the beginning. The ultimate solution, of course was, as the camps grew bigger and\nmore and more people ended up in them, and the problem of feeding them, and they could no\nlonger buy their way out of Germany by surrendering their property to the German regime, they\nhad to come up with a final solution, the final solution was extermination. And that, of course is\nwhen Birkenau and -- and Auschwitz and the others came in -- into being. And that was the\nwhole pattern. Now Streicher took responsibility only up to when the camps were built, like\nDachau. And then points out that he actually at Christmastime, as a Christmas gift, a humane\ngesture on his part, to prove what a big heart he had, he actually arranged for the release of some\nof these people from concentration camps. Communists, never Jews. He never arranged for a\nJew. And this -- I\u2019m quoting him now, how proud he was, \u201cNobody could ever accuse me of\nletting a Jew out of a concentration camp.\u201d That had to be put in. That was part of his -- his\nmake-up. But he had a Christmas party and he would invite the families of these people that he\nwas releasing from the concentration camp. And they didn\u2019t know it, the families didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going to happen, neither did the prisoners. They were suddenly whisked away to some\ngym, or some public building, then the doors would be opened, and the families, and the -- the\ninmates would come together. And you know, nine out of 10 of those would become members of\nthe Nazi party in appreciation. And this is why he did it, because he was the goodwill -- a lot of\nthese communists became Nazis after he released them from the concentration camp.",
        "A: That was one of his accomplishments and -- and that was really his motivation, but he never\nlet Jews out. That was his kins -- his principles. Well, Fr-Frick, as I said, his role in all of this\nwas that he merely -- his job was to write the laws, interpret the laws as Minister of the Interior,\nand to follow those laws. And nothing he did was ever illegal, according to him, he always\nfollowed the law. So he did not -- couldn\u2019t understand why he was being put in with all these\nother people who were -- who -- who went beyond the law, obviously, because that resulted in\nall the atrocities.",
        "A: Exactly.",
        "A: Yup, well that --",
        "A: -- that -- that is it in -- and I\u2019ve saved that characterization because it -- 1t still fits in\nretrospect, looking back on it. And first of all, Goering did not fit any of the three categories that\nI mentioned. Nor was he accepted in those three categories. Now, he was president of the\nReichstag, which would put him in with the bureaucracy, wouldn\u2019t it? With the government, the\nsecretaries and the ministers. Well, they didn\u2019t accept him. They didn\u2019t want him. He was not\nreally one of them. So he was shut out of that group, von Popham, and -- and Meisner, Selta,\nthose, they wanted nothing to do with him. First of all, because he was promoted over their\nheads. They were the men with experience and everything else, and here he -- overnight, he\nbecame the president of the Reichstag, he wasn\u2019t really one of them. Military man, yes, seven\nstar general, Reichsmarshall, the highest military rank ever attained by anybody in history,\nexcept Hannibal maybe. But he wasn\u2019t mem -- a member of the German general\u2019s staff. He -- he\nwas never considered the -- the red stripe of the generale\u2019s staff. So they didn\u2019t accept him, none\nof the generals wanted anything to do with him. I mean, imagine a guy who, you know, who\ncomes from the rank of a -- a lieutenant in the riktorfin squadron suddenly becomes a seven star\nReichsmarshall of the Reich. And so there was jealousy and there was lack of respect and they\nnever took him seriously. And incompetence. Goering was not a very competent man in a sense\nof organization and -- he -- he could talk a big show, but he could never deliver the goods. He\nreally wasn\u2019t a producer. So he was resented by the military and he wasn\u2019t accepted. And he\ndidn\u2019t really fit into the Nazi element because he was above them all. He was strutting in his\nuniforms and make -- making himself super rich by his acquisitions of art and [indecipherable]\nand special train. And then of course the -- the four year plan and the Herman Goering werker.\nSo he\u2019s also an industrialist, in addition to being the huntmaster of Germany, in addition to being\nthe commander in chief of the Luftwaffe. So the other Nazis never considered him part of their\ngroup, even though he had participated in the putsch. So he\u2019s pretty much isolated. He really\nwasn\u2019t accepted. Plus, the conflict between Doenitz and Goering. Hitler in his last will and\ntestament specified that Doenitz, Grand Admiral Doenitz was to be -- to take his place and\nbecome the president or whatever, of the Reich, of the fourth Reich. But as far as Goering was\nconcerned, he was designated to be Hitler\u2019s successor, and it was only because Bormann either\nmisinterpreted or withheld Goering\u2019s last message to Hitler from the [indecipherable] Salzburg\nto Berlin, which resulted in Hitler condemning Goering and supposedly sentencing him to death,\nto be assassinated by the -- by -- executed by the SS. That really wasn\u2019t Hitler\u2019s doing, that was\nBormann, who intercepted the letters and acted not on Hitler\u2019s behalf, but on his own behalf. So\nas far as Goering was concerned, he was still the president of the class. And this group photo I\nhave, who sits in the middle? The president of the class. Who is the successor, Doenitz? He\u2019s in\nthe back row. Well, those two fought each other all the time, never face to face, but to us they\nsay, well Goering did this wrong, he did that wrong, and he\u2019s a nobody and then of course,\nDoenitz didn\u2019t do this and didn\u2019t do that right. So that contest was going on all the time,\ncompeting for each other for the crown under those circumstances, which was amusing. Now\nGoering personally then, to be with him was -- was -- the nice part was, when you left Goering,\nif you got bored with his pomposity and his braggadocio, you could just say, well Herr Goering,\nI -- I have to leave now, I have another appointment. And as far as he was concerned, that\u2019s\nokay, I let you go now, I\u2019m giving you permission to leave. He was always condescending. He\nnever -- he never acted like he was a prisoner in -- he was always in charge. When you went to\ninterrogate him, you were visiting him. It wasn\u2019t interrogation. Or when he came to your room\nfor an interrogation. Sometimes an interrogation was done out in the gar -- on the garden. We\u2019d\ngo for a walk together in the hotel gardens and talk. But it was always, I\u2019m free to talk to you\nnow, you can come and see me. Or I\u2019Il give you an appointment at one o\u2019clock this afternoon for\na visit to your room. So he dismissed you and welcomed you always as the Reichsmarshall on\n[indecipherable]. Secondly, you -- you had to take that with a grain of salt and that\u2019s part of the\ngame. Secondly, he had a terrific sense of humor, he really did. And he enjoyed himself\ntremendously, h-his own jokes. He could laugh harder at his own jokes than anybody I knew.\nAnd I think I mentioned in my book that he had a collection of jokes being told about him in the\nunderground, which he collected, he had written up in a little ba -- joke book. And occasionally,\nif he was in the mood, he would produce his little book and that reminded him of a story, and he\nwould tell you a joke out of his -- his little book. Sometimes off-color jokes, but always with\nhimself as the butt of the joke. If you were caught telling a joke like that in Germany, that was\ngood for six months in a concentration camp. But he collected the joke and -- and save it. He was\nable to laugh at himself, which is a strange thing to say about a man who took himself very, very\nseriously, and who spent every living moment making sure that you knew that he was really the\nleading Nazi and he was really in charge. And he did this and did that, and he was one of the few\nwho admitted building this and building that, and this was really his responsibility. He\naccomplished that; I, Herman Goering. Yet, he could tell jokes about himself if he was in the\nmood. He had to be in the mood; he was a very moody person. Part of which was due to the fact\nhe\u2019s a drug addict. He took paracodeine tablets -- well, the numbers differ. Some writers say a\nhundred tablets a day. I would say that was a little bit much. But he -- he chewed them like\nM&Ms. And he had a pocket full. He actually arrived with -- with a box. I think he confiscated\nall the paracodeine in Germany before he was taken prisoner. And these were tablets that he just\nchewed. One individual tablet probably very weak, but four or five would have the effect of a\nValium, and he would take a handful and just chew on them, and then maybe a half an hour later,\ntake another handful. And we guessed that he consumed -- by Dr. Flicker, who was the German\ndoctor, and we had an American doctor as well, estimated that he was taking between 60 and 80\na day of -- of these little paracodeine tablets, about the size of M&Ms. They broke him of the\nhabit, with his cooperation, by reducing the dosage. At first he didn\u2019t realize they were doing it,\nand then gradually he participated, and then willingly, and almost proudly, to the extent that he\nlost weight, he lost 80 pounds while in prison, and actually began to feel pretty good. As he\nwould say, prison life was good for my health, and -- because he lost weight and said that\nphysically he felt better after six months in Mondorf and Nuremberg than he had ever in his adult\nlife, ever since the time of the putsch when he became morphine addicted, so -- but all the time\nthat he was in the Reich, he was, of course, was a morphine addict, and went into the tank from\ntime to time to be dried out and to take the cure. And this paracodeine was a way of -- of setting\nthat. And when they broke him of the habit, he really -- by the time the trials began, he was in\npretty good shape, compared to the flab that he was when he first was taken prisoner. Now, other\ntimes, if he was in a bad mood, we just stayed away from him because he wouldn\u2019t cooperate, he\nwouldn\u2019t talk. He would just say, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like talk -- talking today, and -- I\u2019m not interested,\nI don\u2019t want to talk to you today.\u201d And that was it, nothing you could do about it. He was afraid\nof thunder and lightning.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah that, I think Hasenclever or somebody else, another author has mentioned that. But I -- I\nactually went in his cell one time during a thunderstorm, and he was hiding under the -- under\nthe cot. Literally shrunk under the cot, because of the -- the terrific thunder storm and lightning,\nand he was frightened. And this was early in Mondorf. And I think part of that was the -- the\ndrug mentality. I wa -- being generous in saying that, I -- he was not a coward, cause he was an --\nan ace in World War I, so it wasn\u2019t on that basis. It had to be part of his mental outlook, or -- or\nhis mental condition at -- at that particular time.",
        "A: That could be it too, yeah, I\u2019m not -- I don\u2019t -- no, that wa -- I didn\u2019t mention that --",
        "A: -- but that -- that\u2019s a good point. That could be it, too. I-It -- but 1t definitely was a --",
        "A: -- was Sa -- it was an extreme, yeah, for a man, it was kind of humorous.",
        "A: And like -- yeah, it just -- cowed.",
        "A: L1-Literally cowed by it, yeah. One amusing anecdote, which is part of my pattern of circles, I\n-- I tell in my book and is worth repeating, because it\u2019s quite significant. As I said, Goering was\npretty much isolated by the others, with the result that most frequently he would eat by himself,\nsometimes by choice because all the -- all the other guys were eating there, but here is where the\nReichsmarshall eats. When he did eat with somebody else, it would usually be because he\nwanted to discuss some important matter that came to mind. Then he would actually make an\nappointment for lunch with -- or -- or dinner with -- with the people. Well, we took turns, the\nduty officer on occasion, like the meal times. And I happened to be duty officer, you know,\nduring a dinner -- lunch time, once. And as I said, we had ordinary German prisoners who\ndelivered -- who prepared the food and -- and serve it. And this German -- ex-German corporal, I\nthink he was, who was a regular prisoner of war, worked in the kitchen, served -- came in. And I\nhappened to be standing near Goering\u2019s table when he sat down and this man brought plate of\nstew, set it before Goering on a heavy porcelain dish, no knives or forks permitted, they -- they\nate with spoo -- they ate with the spoons and all the food that was prepared was spoonable. They\ndidn\u2019t need a knife to cut their food, there were stews and things of that nature. 1600 calories a\nday, no more. That was prescribed by the Geneva Convention. This man set the plate of stew\nbefore Goering and Goering looked at it and smelled it, then he pushed it aside. And then he\ngrowled at this PW, he said, \u201cTake that slop away. I fed my dog much better than that back\nhome.\u201d And this PW took the plate of stew, and stepped back and he clicked his heels and\nbowed, and he said, \u201cIn that case, Herr Reichsmarshall, your dog ate much better than we\nGerman soldiers did.\u201d Made an about face and walked out. Well, that was quite a memorable\noccasion. Forty years later, I\u2019m the ambassador in Luxembourg and the city of Mondorf decided\nto make me an honorary citizen of Mondorf, which is quite an honor over there, because the -- I\ndon\u2019t know what -- what you get for it. I think you don\u2019t get arrested if you speed, or you can\npark any place you want to. Whatever, I\u2019ve never taken advantage of it, but they have a street\nnamed for me, which -- which 1s great, I think that\u2019s a real thrill because every day somebody is\nmentioning my name. They\u2019ve got to -- you know, if they\u2019re arrested, or have groceries shipped\nto them, or apply for a driver\u2019s license, where do you live? They\u2019ve got to name me and so that\u2019s\na -- that\u2019s an everlasting honor that\u2019s going to be there as long as the street is. But I became an\nhonorary citizen, they had a big ceremony, the mayor, and the town council and the boy scouts\nand girl scouts and the village band, everybody was out. And Winnie and I arrived in the embas -\n- embassy car with the American flag, embassy flag. One of those nice ego trips, of which we\nhad many. And we stepped out and they played the national anthems of both countries and -- and\nthen the mayor, with his red, white and blue sash, his symbol of rank. And we had a\n[indecipherable] there. And then we met some -- met some of the other guests, including a man\nwho was very Germanic in his approach, you know, the stiff legged, head bowing. And he\nintroduced himself as Rudolf Diebenbush from Koblenz, and he was a special guest because he\nhad asked to be invited to this occasion because he had read in the paper that the American\nambassador was a former interrogator and was being honored in Mondorf as an honorary citizen.\nAnd since he had been a PW at the installation at that particular time, he was sure that he knew\nthe ambassador, although Dolibois didn\u2019t mean anything to him, he knew me as Gillen. So then\nhe came -- then when he saw my face, he began to put two and two together and says, that -- that\n-- that was Lieutenant Gillen, Oberloitman Gillen. So he was pleased to meet me and -- and\nmade a big show of who he was and so forth. Well, I was pleased to meet him too, and we started\nto make -- compare some notes. Then he tapped me on the shoulder, and he said, \u201cMr.\nAmbassador, Herr [indecipherable],\u201d he said, \u201cdo you remember the incident when a soldier\nserved a plate of stew to Goering?\u201d And said, \u201cThat was me, Rudolf Diebenbush from Koblenz.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same. I didn\u2019t recognize him because he\u2019s 40 years older. But that was Rudolf\nDiebenbush from Koblenz. P-Pattern of circles.",
        "A: Well, it -- it is -- I -- I was in the back -- back of the --",
        "A: -- so I didn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t see his facial expression, and he -- there nothing he could say, but in\nmy own mind, that man would have lost his head if that had happened six months earlier, you\nknow.",
        "A: The tables had been turned. I classify that as one of my ironic experiences.",
        "A: Oh yes, very quickly, beginning with the atom bomb, who dropped it on Hiroshima and\nNagasaki. And who is the -- who\u2019s the real war criminal. By comparison how many did you kill,\ncompared to the numbers you accuse us of killing? That was one of his favorite lines.\nConcentration camps? We learn about concentration camps from the Russians. And of course he\n-- he didn\u2019t bring up the -- the massacre in Poland and he --",
        "A: -- he had all of that very ca -- yeah.",
        "A: And he -- he had -- he had all the history. He -- he knew -- and he could go back to\nconcentration camps of long, long time ago. You know, he never -- he was not anti-Semitic\naccording to him. It all depended who the Jew was. If he was an eastern Jew from\nCzechoslovakia or Poland, that\u2019s different, we don\u2019t want them, get them out of Germany, get rid\nof them. Now don\u2019t kill them. He didn\u2019t believe in killing them, but he believed in getting rid of\nthem by hook or by crook, just get rid of them. Don\u2019t torture them, don\u2019t kill them. That was not\nhis idea, he says. Now, if he was a German Jew, and had not committed any crime against the\ngovernment, he very frequently said that he protected them. In fact, there was some good -- some\npeople in his household who were Jewish. Even his successor, Milch, was part Jewish, and he\nsucceeded him as commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, and he claimed that he was criticized for\nthat because Milch is part Jew. But in Germany, I say who is a Jew and who isn\u2019t a Jew. That\nwas one of his bylines. So, he was an interesting character, no matter how you -- how you sliced\nit, no matter what mood he was in.",
        "A: What the truth was, yes. And -- and what was deliberate gossip. They were -- they were just\ngossiping, or -- or were they really telling the truth. The challenge in that was for us to try to\nlearn as much -- what -- I can only speak for myself, to learn as much about the German\ngeneral\u2019s staff before I interrogated somebody about the staff, so that I could tell when -- you\nknow, when he was pulling my leg, or when he was just stretching a point. Which meant doing\nhomework before you even begin an interrogation. And that was difficult because we knew very\nlittle. We knew more about Frederick the Great and the German general\u2019s staff back in the 18\"\ncentury, but we didn\u2019t know anything about the relationship of the German general\u2019s staff to the\nrise of Hitler, the role that they played in his coming to power, or the role that they played in\nexecution and planning of the war. And this 1s what we needed to learn, we -- that\u2019s what our\nhomework is all about. And that is where this man Warlimont proved very valuable to me. It got\nto the point where if I had a sp-specific interrogation report about the general\u2019s staff to ask of\nDoenitz, for instance -- Jodl -- I never interrogated Jodl cause he was very uncooperative, yes or\nno. Everything was yes or no. And -- and he -- he just -- you never got much out of him. I don\u2019t\nknow who -- I don\u2019t know of anybody of the other interrogators ever got anything out of him. He\nwas a very strict soldier, name, rank and serial number, and he played that for all he was worth.\nAnd as far as he was concerned, the prisoner of war and you didn\u2019t have a right to try him. So, if\nI would interrogate Kesselring, or Blaskowitz, or one of those guys, I go to Warlimont first and\nask him the same questions, by way of doing homework. And then doing the interrogation and\nverifying what Warlimont had given me in relationship to the answers to the questions I was\ngetting from the prisoner.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: That didn\u2019t --",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t -- they separated legal staff and the military intelligence staff\ncompletely. We were -- it is just like a private investigator working on a crime, and giving his\ninformation to the prosecutor. But the -- the investigator then doesn\u2019t become part of the -- the\nprocess. And that\u2019s pretty much the role we play. We were investigating the character and -- and\nthe people and the incidents and verifying. A lot of our stuff was, do you recognize this\ndocument, do you know what it means? Is that your signature, or is that Goering\u2019s signature as\nyou know it? That\u2019s -- that type of thing. Then after we got to Nuremberg -- I did no\ninterrogating at Nuremberg. At -- at Nuremberg I was strictly -- first sent there to get the\ninformation that Ley had, who claimed that he had some important information that he would\ngive only to me -- in a letter he sent to Lieutenant Gillen. So I was sent to Nuremberg on -- on\ntemporary assignment for six days to -- to get that from Ley. And after that I was to come back\nhome. But meanwhile, unbeknownst to me, Colonel Andrews pulled strings to keep me in\nNuremberg because I guess -- well, because it was comfortable to have -- have me around, cause\nI brought back his days of power in -- in Luxembourg. In Nuremberg Andrews didn\u2019t have much\nclout because Jackson was in charge. And except for guarding the prison, Andrews really had\nnothing to do with the prisoners. For that matter, I don\u2019t think he ever -- he -- he didn\u2019t see the\nprisoners day by day, face -- eyeball to eyeball like he did in Luxembourg. And he missed that,\nand he -- he really was a figurehead in -- in Nuremberg. So he wanted his old team back, so he\ntried to keep me there. And that was -- but he had to find something for me to do. So I became\nspecial assistant to -- to him, to carry out his orders. Well, he had no orders, he really had none,\nexcept let him know -- if you talk to these guys, let me know if they\u2019re committing suici -- trying\nto commit suicide, or if they\u2019re doing something unusual. Like one guy who was -- who had\nbeen Himmler\u2019s chauffeur, who listened to the radio all the time, putting his ear to the\n[indecipherable] dial, I mean that kind of stuff, and Andrews liked him, then it -- so then, in\norder to have something to do -- meanwhile, I was pulling strings to get out of Nuremberg. I was\nfed up with the whole operation, I didn\u2019t want any more of it. And Andrews 1s trying to keep me,\nand we finally made a deal. If I got somebody to succeed me, then I could go, and then he would\nstop trying to hold onto me; cause he needed me. And that is when we got Gustav Gilbert. I went\nthrough the Richie crowd, and Gilbert had been an interrogator, I think at Wiesbaden, so that\nwhen he came to Nuremberg -- he was a psychologist professionally and he got -- he had book\nwritten all over him before he came, and he was ready to go. He had his book planned. And --\nand so Gilbert began to take over this visiting each prisoner in his cell. And up to that point, the\nRorschach analysis test came into play in that -- Major Douglas, Douglas Kelly was the prison\npsychiatrist. He was a professional psychiatrist, whose job it was to test these prisoners, you get\ntheir IQ, their personality quirks, their state of mind. Anything else that the inkblot test reveals.\nA lot of these people were self-appointed. Back in those days, really, for those first six months or\nso after the war, you could pretty much do what you wanted to do, and write your own orders\ncause everyb -- everybody\u2019s in turmoil. And if you could just get somebody to say, okay, I\u2019m\nappointing Lieutenant Dolibois chairman of the zoo, and I\u2019d be chairman of the zoo. So this guy\nGilbert arrived -- Douglas arrives on the scene, and he\u2019s a prison psychiatrist, a-and he\u2019s\nprimarily working for some institute, I think it was the Drexel Institute, to test these prisoners.\nBut the information would also be useful to the tribunal because it would help them understand.\nSo he became very important, prison psychiat -- except he couldn\u2019t speak German. So then they\nfound out that I had majored in psychology in college, so I knew -- I knew that -- the terms, with\nthe result I became the interpreter for the Rorschach analys -- which I loved, it was a lot of fun.",
        "A: And -- I just -- he gave the questions and I interpret -- translated and gave the answers. And --\nand then he would ask me to write what I thought after an interroga -- after an -- an interview,\nwhat\u2019d you think of this? And then I would write my layman\u2019s report of what I think the prisoner\nwas like. And then he combined that with his technological -- his -- his scientific analysis, and it\nmade for a pretty intelligent report. The layman could read his report, whereas if it had been all\nscientific, probably nothing would have -- not much would have come of -- and this is my first\nmeeting with Hess, I had not interrogated Hess before, because he was in England. So was my --\nmy meeting with Hess 1s strictly for the Rorschach analysis test. And that was interesting, and of\ncourse on Goering and -- and Rosenberg. And that opened up a whole new avenue of getting to\nknow them from -- from that side, see?",
        "A: Well, our interrogation before was based on the questionnaires. We were merely getting\nanswers to what we were asked to get informa -- then, mine was supplemented by -- by me,\nwhen my -- my inquiring about their welfare, and how many children you have, and how is your\nwife, and where is your wife now, and where did you live. What did you do before you became\nthis. That kind of gossip information.",
        "A: And then the personality -- as I said, the gossip, who was sleeping with whom. Who was\nhaving an affair with whose wife. Bormann\u2019s thigh bones were actually abnormally short, did\nyou know that?",
        "A: Well, see now Buch told me that, I would never have known, that Bormann seldom appeared\nin public and seldom appeared in movies because he really was a little bit abnormal in his shorter\nthigh bone. And Bormann also was quite an adulterer. And Bormann had also made his wife into\nsuch a Nazi that she became estranged from her father and didn\u2019t speak to her father for decades.\nHad absolutely nothing more to do with her father; that was Walter Buch. And -- thanks to\nBormann. But that kind of gossip. But that had nothing to do with the trial, that merely gave us a\npicture. Now the Rorschach test then, gave us a complete characterization of the prisoners. First\nof all, the IQ. The highest IQ was Hjalmar Schacht, who was close to genius. Second highest\nArthur Seyss-Inquart. Third highest was Herman Goering. He was a very intelligent man. And\nthen it went down on the line, all the way to the lowest IQ, was Julius Streicher with 106. And so\nthat -- that -- that was an interesting statistic. Racial attitudes, Rosenberg, for instance, who was a\n-- a latvi -- you know, born in the Balkans -- in -- in Baltics.",
        "A: You\u2019re not -- he was not a German. Hess was born in Egypt, and never came to Germany til\nhe was 15 years of old -- of age. Hitler, to Hess, was a father image. Hess, we learned -- this is\nthe Rorschach test now, nobody told us these things, Hess was a man who was completely\ndependent on somebody else, he was not a man of his own, not a leader certainly, a follower.\nAlways a good second in command, as long as somebody else told him what to do, he -- he was -\n- he was effective as a flunkie. Keitel was in the same kind of a personality. No leader, but -- but\na -- a-- a good follower. Hess was a flake, physically. He had every ail -- ailment. If he read an\narticle about some disease, he ended up having it. He saw every doctor, every quack in Germany\nabout all the different ailments he had. He took more pills, more medicines during his life -- he\u2019s\na vegetarian. When he was invited to dinner with Hitler he brought his own food, until Hitler\nfinally forbade it, and wouldn\u2019t allow it any more because Hess, when I invite you to dinner, you\neat the food I -- Hitler was a vegetarian too, but Hess was more of a vegetarian than Hitler, so he\nbrought his own meal, his own food to a dinner at Hitler\u2019s home. Well, that kind of information\nall revealed itself in the course of the Rorschach test. Hess saw things in -- in the inkblots that\nother people never saw. He -- he saw blood where somebody else saw valentines. He -- it was all\nvery fascinating. Rosenberg -- I had a copy of Rosenberg\u2019s book out of the prison library. His\nmyth [indecipherable] the myth of -- \u201cMyth of the Twentieth Century.\u201d Not the mythos, mythis. I\nwanted him to autograph it for me, and I asked him to autograph it for me, and I -- this is one of\nthose memories -- memorable moments that stick out. And he grabbed the book and actually put\nit behind his back, and says, \u201cI can\u2019t let you have this.\u201d Well, this is very amusing, and I said,\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, because when I wrote this book, I was looking for a new faith, a\nnew belief, and I found it in writing the book. And I\u2019m afraid if you read this book -- and I found\nout that you\u2019re a good American officer, and you\u2019re a good Christian. You\u2019 ll read my book and\nyou'll give up your faith and you\u2019ll give up your spirit of democracy, and you\u2019ll accept my\nconcepts of -- of the world, and Pll have that on my conscience.\u201d Which -- thinking pretty much\nof his book. But I promised that I would never read it, 1f he would just autograph it I\u2019d have it as\na souvenir. So he did autograph it for me. He didn\u2019t inscribe it, just A. Rosenberg. I mentioned\nthis to Hess. I asked Hess if he had ever written a book. \u201cNo, why do you ask?\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWell, because I\u2019m collecting books with autographs and I thought if you had one, I would look\nfor it, and get your autograph.\u201d And I told him about Rosenberg. And his -- Hess said -- oh, I\u2019m\nsorry, not he -- not Hess, Schacht -- Schirach, the you -- the youth leader, said that Rosenberg\u2019s\nbook is the only bestseller that nobody has ever read, because it\u2019s a mish mosh of anti-\nCatholicism, anti-Christianity, anti-Semitism, anti everything that\u2019s decent [indecipherable]\nrespect. So that was von Schirach\u2019s answer to that particular incident. He had never written a\nbook either, Schirach.",
        "A: Yeah, th-tha -- there was a reason -- there was a reason for that. I came through Rass on the\nday Jodl signed a surrender document, and -- surrendering unconditionally, and his signature was\nstrictly Jodl, J-o-d-l. And then under that, Generaloberst. That was all. But someone who was\nthere, an at -- an historian, Colonel Hale, University of Virginia, mentioned this to me, and I\nthought, gee that\u2019s -- you know, I could have stopped in Rass and I could have seen Jodl.\nImagine -- I would have liked to have a -- see what the guy looked like. This is before\nLuxembourg, so I didn\u2019t know I was going to end up in Luxembourg and actually live in the\nsame building with Jodl for -- for months. So when Jodl showed up in Luxembourg and\neverything, I thought, well here\u2019s -- I -- I'll get his autograph. So I went to Jodl with a three by\nfive card, and I asked him if he would sign this for me, like he signed the surrender. And her\naccommodated me, Jodl, Generaloberst. Then it occurred to me that I -- I had Jodl\u2019s, and I\nshould have Keitel\u2019s, who signed the surrender on the eastern front, then I would have two. And\nI had visions I\u2019d frame it, have -- these are the signatures that appeared on the surrender that\nended the war. So I got Keitel\u2019s. Well, apparently Keitel or Jodl told some of the other prisoners\nthat I had asked them for an autograph. I don\u2019t know why -- because when we were getting ready\nto move them from Luxembourg to Nuremberg, five or six of them came to me and said they\u2019d\nlike to give me their autograph. Doenitz was one of them. So they gave me their autograph on a\npiece of paper, and so forth. So I became known as an autograph collector, and I really didn\u2019t\nhave that in mind at all. When I was sent [indecipherable] my commanding officer was Colonel\nPhelp, and on the occasion one time was having lunch with Colonel Phelp, and I told him about\nthis. I said, \u201cWould you want to see the names of the -- the guys who signed the surrender\ndocument?\u201d And I showed them to Colonel Phelp. He says, \u201cHey,\u201d he said, \u201cthat gives me an\nidea.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get me the signatures of all those guys when you go to\nNuremberg, next time you go to Nuremberg? Get all their signatures and their photographs.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cI\u2019Il make up a scrapbook, I\u2019m going to give it to Eisenhower.\u201d A scrapbook, a\npicture of each one of the high ranking Nazis and their autographs. And I said okay, and that\ngave me an idea, I thought, well in that case, I\u2019ll get two autographs, I\u2019ll keep one for myself,\nand I\u2019Il have a complete collection. So that was my idea. So that was my -- when I went to\nNuremberg then to get -- to -- to talk to Ley about his master plan for the reconstruction of\nGermany, I had autographs in mind. And I willingly got them, at least half a dozen others, but\nsome refused to sign. Hess, for instance, refused to sign his. So I made up a certificate,\nmimeographed, [speaks German here]. I certify herewith that this is my official signature. Then I\nwent to them, I said, you know, in relation to documents in a trial, we want to have your official\nsignature on record. And I got their autographs, two copies; one for me and one for the -- the\nscrapbook for General Eisenhower. The sequel to that is that I had this collection, my own. I\ndidn\u2019t have any photographs, we weren\u2019t allowed to take pictures. But I met a Navy officer, a\nNavy officer in Nuremberg, American, and -- in the Panther Pit, that\u2019s the bar at the Grand Hotel\nwhere a lot of us were billeted. And we happened to sit at the bar together and I said, you know,\nwhat\u2019s the Navy doing in Nuremberg? You know, there are no Navy ships here, and -- and he\nsaid well he\u2019d been -- he was naval intelligence, and he was assigned to -- in the photo --\nbusiness of photo intelligence, identification of documents and so forth. And he said, you know,\nfunny thing, Hitler\u2019s official photographer was just brought in a couple of days ago, and he had a\nwhole suitcase full of pictures of all the -- the high ranking Nazis and where they lived and all\nthat kind of stuff. So here was my boy, and I told him that I was trying to get some photographs,\ncould he -- he get me some copies. So he very obligingly made copies of some of the\nphotographs of all of the -- the Nazis that were in -- in Hoffman, the photographer\u2019s collection.\nHe gave them to me. I mean, we met a few days later, I got copy. So I had photographs and --\nand autographs and I gave a set to Colonel Phelp. There\u2019s a sequel to that, very recent one. I told\nyou earlier, I was not a souvenir collector, and there was a time a few years ago when -- when it\nwas just -- at least in my part of the world, where having Nazi souvenirs sort of made you stand\nout if you showed them to anybody, as a Nazi sympathizer. And I\u2019m thinking of Marge Schott,\nwho was even mentioned in the newspapers because she had a swastika armband -- in a negative\nway. None of my grandchildren were interested in any of this stuff, so I found somebody who\nwas interested, who said that he would give these to a museum connected with the Simon\nWiesenthal Center in California. And I gave them to him, the autographs and the pictures. Gave\nthem to him. A month ago I got a book in the mail, by a man named John K. Latimer, M.D.,\ndoctor, who was a doctor at Nuremberg, off and on. One of these guys who could -- I want to go\nsee what it\u2019s like at Nuremberg, so he went there, and he went to Nuremberg. And actually, as a\ndoctor, could interview some of the prisoners, which he did. And just a month ago, his book\ncame out, and the title of the book 1s, \u201cHitler\u2019s Fatal Disease, and Other Anecdotes.\u201d He knew\nme, because I had interpreted for him a couple of times. So it\u2019s inscribed to -- he read my book,\ninscribed to Ambassador Dolibois and in parentheses, our Lieutenant Gillen from Nuremberg.\nAnd he wrote this book, it just came out a month ago, and he sent me a complimentary copy,\ncause he had read my book, and reminded me, in a letter that I sent to him thanking him, I said,\n\u201cHow did you get my name?\u201d And he said, \u201cAbout five years ago I wrote to you about your book\nand you sent me a complimentary copy and I\u2019m returning the favor.\u201d And I\u2019d completely -- I\ndon\u2019t remember it at all. I had sent him a copy of my book with my autograph, because we met\nas a-- a -- a fellow -- a colleague or something, a fellow Nuremberger, cause I had interpreted\nfor him. Now his book comes out, on \u201cHitler\u2019s Fatal Disease,\u201d explaining why Hitler did the\nthings he did and also some stories about some of the others. Some of the stories based on my\nbook. And he credits me, he -- he does say, according to Lieutenant Dolibois, or Lieutenant\nGillen at that point, so and so said what. And then accompanying each one of these articles was\ntheir photograph and their autograph. So I wrote to him, and I said where did you get those\npictures, because some of the ata -- autograph have my own handwriting on them, where I write\nthe -- the titles in, like generale fieldmarshall Keitel. And he said he bought them from a\ncollector, he didn\u2019t remember his name, but he paid a pretty good price for them. So my\nphotograph collection, and autographs are in the possession of Dr. John K. Latimer, who is a\nmedical doctor and has written a book about Hitler\u2019s fatal disease. Do you know what the fatal\ndisease 1s?",
        "A: Parkinson\u2019s disease. Hitler had Parkinson\u2019s disease, and this man analyzes this based on what\nother doctors who had interviewed Hitler, or people whom he interviewed who knew Hitler, and\na series of photographs in the book, which is a feature. Toward the end of his years, every\nphotograph you see of Hitler, he is either clasping his belt with his left hand, or has his left hand\nin his pocket, or is -- is holding an umbrella or a staff or cane or something 1n his left hand, to\nprevent his showing the -- the Parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms. And this Dr. Latimer has\nconcluded on the basis -- on the interviews, and his medical observation and other tests, that\nHitler suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and many of the decisions that Hitler made, like the\ninvasion of the Soviet Union, were due to the fact that he knew he didn\u2019t much time left before\nhis disease would be publicly known and he would lose his effectiveness with the German\npeople, and he would no longer be able to fulfill all of his dreams. So he made many fatal\ndecisions based on the knowledge that he -- that he had a fatal disease of which he was going to\ndie. And that\u2019s the title of this book, just came out a month ago. \u201cHitler\u2019s Fatal Disease, and\nOther Anecdotes,\u201d or stories about other Nazis. And my pictures are in there.",
        "A: He bought them from a collector. And the --",
        "A: I gave them to an individual who was going to give them to the Wiesenthal Center.",
        "A: I sold my epaulets to that same individual, and for that I got paid, but he didn\u2019t say anything\nthat he didn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t say anything about selling the photographs. All he said was I\u2019m going\nto give these to the museum at the Wiesenthal Center. And he had --",
        "A: The epaulets were Goering\u2019s epaulet --",
        "A: -- which Goering gave to me.",
        "A: But that\u2019s what happened to autographs.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Fine.",
        "A: Vitchell, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "A: Yup, yup.",
        "A: Yeah, that -- there was several other women in the story, but very -- very briefly, one of them\nbeing Jodl\u2019s wife --",
        "A: -- and -- that I -- that I mentioned, and Streicher\u2019s wife --",
        "A: -- Adele. But this Guyon Vitchell was -- she was a professional spy. And she apparently had\nsome relationship, whether a love -- whether it was a love relationship, but she knew one of the\ngenerals that we had in a prison da -- now we had in Nuremberg -- this is in Nuremberg now, not\nin Luxembourg, we didn\u2019t have any women in Luxembourg, but in Nuremberg, the top floor, one\nside of the top floor of the prison where all the Nazis were kept was reserved for women. And\nHimmler\u2019s -- Himmler\u2019s secretary, and Ribbentrop\u2019s secretary were among the prisoners, mostly\nas witnesses, not because they were charged with any crimes, or intended to be. And this Vitchell\napparently, I don\u2019t know why she was taken prisoner, cause there were a lot of spies, and -- and\nsome of them we even knew about. But this one, I think because she had the connection with this\ngeneral -- and we thought that was the -- the spy on the higher rank, because the relationship --\nand they were exchanging notes with each other. And we -- our curiosity was aroused by how --\nhow she could write a note and end up -- ends up in his cell. So obviously one of our guards was\ndelivering messages from one prisoner to another. And that was strictly verboten, that wa -- that\nwas not allowed at all. So this was one of my functions, that -- that Colonel Andrews delegated\nto me when I became his special assistant. So I was to find out how this note business was going\nabout. And wi -- the -- the whole incident was that I -- I went -- went to her cell, naturally. And\nthe guards were not allowed in the cells at all. They were -- they had to stand outside the cell.\nAnd up at that section I think was one guard for the whole corridor, we only had five or six\nwomen prisoners. But I noticed that Vitchell, who was a rather striking looking woman, and\nwhen -- when I entered, she was dressed in a robe that came all the way to her feet. And -- which\nI thought was unusual prison garb, but they weren\u2019t really being held as -- as criminals, so I\ndidn\u2019t pay too much attention to it. But I was asking her questions, and I forget how the sequel\nwent, because I didn\u2019t attach that much importance to it, but I did notice that she had a good\nstack of American cigaret -- cigarettes brand -- American brand cigarettes, loosely, not in a pack,\nbut 1-in a tray on her table in -- in the prison. And in the course of questioning, she -- I asked her\nwhere she got those cigarettes and she had no hesitancy at all in answering by just opening her\nrobe. And I found out she was abs -- absolutely stark naked underneath the robe. Which was\nunusual prison garb also. And then I put two and two together and I said, \u201cLet me see if I have\nthis figured right. You get those cigarettes,\u201d because they were not prison issue, \u201cyou get those\ncigarettes from the guard. And you give him peep show and he tosses in a cigarette,\u201d through the\nopening where we pass their food. And she said I had that absolutely right. Well, I don\u2019t know\nwhether the guard was listening on the outside, which I think he was, and there really wasn\u2019t\nanything I could do about it, and it really wasn\u2019t that much of an issue. But obviously one of the\nguards who was willing to carry the messages was giving extra cigarettes and doing her that\nfavor, which -- it struck my sense of humor. I don\u2019t think it was a criminal offense, I didn\u2019t want\nto -- but I knew if I reported this to Colonel Andrews, somebody would end up in the -- in the\nbrig, and somebody would be severely punished. So I -- I had a little fun, I came out of the cell,\nand the guard was standing in there, and just by looking at him, I could tell that he -- he knew\nwhat I -- what the conversation was, cause he\u2019s all red in the face, and -- and being extra polite\nand standing at rigid attention, almost like a statue. So I just went up to him right face to face and\nlooked at him and said, if you won\u2019t tell, I won\u2019t tell, or something to that effect, and walked\naway. And he said, \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d And he clicked his heels. And I became very popular with\nthe guards cause the word got around very quickly. But I reported this to Colonel Andrews, who\nhad no sense of humor at all. And Colonel Andrews would occasionally repeat the same story,\nbut he had it all mixed up. And he was giving a -- I think it was Ribbentrop\u2019s secretary or one of\n-- one of those people\u2019s secretaries\u2019 credit for being the -- the person that exposed herself. And\nthat particular person was extremely ugly, and -- and nobody would give up a cigarette to look at\nher in the nude or even dressed. So that made it good, but I never corrected the colonel cause he -\n- he enjoyed his story so much, but he did have it all screwed up. He had one other joke that he\nhad to tell every newcomer, saying that -- he said, hell, I always -- I thought -- I -- God\u2019s last\nname was damn. When he grew up he thought God\u2019s last name was damn, and that was an\nhilarious story, when he though -- he thought that was just great until he found out otherwise.\nBut he had no sense of humor, compared to Reichsmarshall Goering, who had a pretty good\nsense of humor.",
        "A: I -- I visited Kesselring and Selta\u2019s wife when I went to Tegernsee with Warlimont to get\nthose documents a -- I don\u2019t know if you want to go into that story, but it\u2019s kind of humorous and\ninteresting, too. But Warlimont -- mind you now, he\u2019s general of the artillery, a three star\ngeneral, came to me one day in Oberoszul and told me that he had a proposition, that he would\nlike to visit his wife and his children, he had three children, two daughters and a son, at\nTegernsee where -- where they lived on -- in Bavaria and that if I would take him there so he\ncould visit his family, he would in turn make available to me, all the minutes of all the meetings\nof the German general\u2019s staff, bound in volumes all the way back to 1792 or \u201932, when the\ngeneral\u2019s staff was founded. Not only that but he would also have some other books and\ndocuments, manuscripts, he\u2019d make them available to me, on the history of the German general\u2019s\nstaff. Well, that was extremely valuable, but the idea of my taking that prisoner to visit his family\nwas just so ridiculous that I had repeat it as a joke to my commanding officer, I said to him,\n\u201cColonel, you -- you won\u2019t believe this,\u201d and -- and I told him. And he thought it over, and he\nsmiled a little bit, and made no other comment. But the next day he called me in and said he had\nbeen thinking it over, and that I ought to just go ahead and take Warlimont, but we just keep\nquiet about it. We wouldn\u2019t make this an o-official record, he would just give me the travel\norders, by order of the commanding officer, and authorize me to go to Tegernsee, and be\naccompanied by PW W. Warlimont. But we wouldn\u2019t talk to anybody about it, because we --\nobviously wasn\u2019t going to be allowed by anyone higher up. So I arranged a week later to take\nWarlimont on a tour in a Jeep and I had my 45 caliber gun, and he was dressed in civilian clothes\nanyway, because he was no longer active in the army when he surrendered to us. No problem,\nbut I passed him off as my interpreter and my driver. The first problem we had was when we\nstopped in Stuttgart at a military mess to get lunch. And the mess sergeant of course saw my\norders, which I presented to him, and sure enough sir, you can eat and all the courtesy and\neverything else, he said, but the Kraut isn\u2019t going to get any food. And I had convinced the\nsergeant that the Kraut was a pretty nice guy and he was my interpreter and give him a big sales\ntalk and finally the sergeant relented and allowed the Kraut to get some food in the kitchen, but I\nheard him give a -- General Warlimont orders about washing his mess kit afterwards and\ncleaning it -- cleaning up after him, and he used a four -- a few selective phrases. I wondered\nwhat he would have done if he had known he was talking to a three star German general,\nordering him to wash his own mess kit. Well, that story became interesting as we got to\nTegernsee. It seemed that Warlimont lived right next door to his in-laws. His wife\u2019s mother and\nfather, his ma -- wife\u2019s father was an opera singer, and the wife\u2019s mother was a native American,\nhad been born in United States, related to the Anheuser-Busch family, a distant relative of the\nAnheuser-Busch family. And he had met their daughter in the United States. He wa -- the opera\nsinger Baron von Cleidorf was his name, had tour -- was touring the United States when he met\nthis girl, whom he then married in 1903, and they had a daughter, and that daughter became the\nwife of General Warlimont. So now Baron and Baroness von Cleid -- Cleidorf lived next door to\nthe Warlimonts. I stayed with them, and the general stayed with his wife and his three children.\nThey had a very happy family reunion. And we visited for three days and during that visit -- I\nthen took off in my Jeep and went to visit Kesselring\u2019s wife and Selta\u2019s wife, and brought them\nnews. They had not heard of their husbands, where they were, if they were even alive. So I was\nreally the harbinger of joy. And as a result of that visit, as a gift to me in the course of\nconversation, they developed an interest in my family. And I pointed out that I had a little son at\nhome, and so I ended up with a pair of lederhosen as a special gift from Mrs. Selta for my son.\nAnd those are authentic lederhosen, they\u2019re the real McCoy. So I was very proud and happy to\nhave them. But it was on that occasion I visited those two wives. And --",
        "A: Go ahead, yeah.",
        "A: No. Well, the -- the whole purpose of that visit -- and that was fully understood -- in fact, I\nhad orders. Remember, there was a non-fraternization law, and American personnel were not\npermitted to fraternize with Germans. You could get in real trouble just by seeing -- seeing -- by\nbeing seen talking to a German. So I had a special set of orders, as to -- that I was a member of\nmilitary intelligence, and was authorized to enter German homes, and also authorized to\ninterrogate, investigate whatever mission I\u2019d -- I decided on. But I had official authorization.\nAnd this was on my -- on my orders, which I always carried with me, because like an instance,\nlike if anybody, military police had seen me going into a German home, I could have gotten in\nreal trouble if I wasn\u2019t authorized. Course, there was a lot of fraternization going on throughout\nGermany, but it was one of those rules that was a little bit ridiculous because in my\n[indecipherable] here was our opportunity with an army of occupation to really do some\nbrainwashing of the Germans, and convince them that our system is far superior to the Nazi\nsystem. And we could have organized the German youth into basketball teams and soccer teams\nand football teams and tell them about American sportsmanship. Instead, we weren\u2019t allowed to\ntalk to them, which to me seemed a little silly. We -- we missed a wonderful opportunity, which\nwas reversed when the Marshall plan went into effect and we then did what we should have done\nimmediately after the war. But this fraternization policy was ridiculous. One more secret to the\nstory of Warlimont is that on our way home -- and I did get the documents. And I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to all of the documents, but I do know that years later I purchased a book from\nmy library written by John Wheeler Bennett, which was the -- the mc -- \u201cNemesis of Power; A\nHistory of the German General\u2019s Staff.\u201d And I know that a lot of the research and documentation\nthat appeared in John Wheeler Bennett\u2019s book had to come from the documents that we\nrecovered through General Warlimont on this visit -- il-illegal visit to his family. On the way\nhome I didn\u2019t travel the Autobahn, I took the side roads, because just in case of an accident or\nsomething, I still would have trouble explaining what I was doing traveling with a three star\nGerman general who was really a prisoner of war. So I took the side roads pretty much. And we\nwere right near the Bavarian headquarters of General Patton, who had been appointed the\nmilitary governor of Bavaria. And we were traveling along this somewhat isolated country road,\nheading back toward Oberoszul when there was a commotion ahead of us, and obviously some\nkind of a traffic disturbance. And I pulled my Jeep over to side of the road and got out and stood\nby the road to see what was coming my way, and when they reached me with the sirens going, it\nwas a Jeep with a flasher and siren, full blast, and then a staff car with license plate and four\nstars. And in the back seat was no less a person than General Patton and his dog. And of course I\nthrew a fancy salute and General Patton acknowledged it by raising his riding crop, which he had\nin his hand, and passed on. And a fantastic thought that occurred to me was that if I had only had\nenough nerve to stop the -- that particular convoy, and introduced General Patton to the German\ngeneral, who had arranged all of the offensive and defensive maneuvers, including the invasion\nof Normandy, and say, \u201cThis is the guy who tried to stop you, general. And this general is the\nman who -- whom you couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d It would have been quite a meeting, but I would have had\nan awful time explaining what I was doing illegally with -- traveling with this important PW. So\nthat was the whole story of that. Visiting Mrs. Goering was part of the same scheme, th-the\nagreement was -- and our military intelligence was that any way we could gather information be\nuseful, and visiting their families was not only a gesture that opened up and loosened tongues,\nbut it also gave us a chance to get another viewpoint as I -- I mentioned earlier. So I went to --\nwent to visit Mrs. Goering. The housekeeper answered the door and saw my American uniform\nand all but slammed the door in my face, she would have nothing to do with me. So I went back\nand I told Goering that I tried to see his wife. He knew that -- where I was going, I said I\u2019m -- I\nwas going on a trip and I was coming near where his wife was. I think was one of the -- one of\nthe chateaus that had once belonged to him, she was living in part of it. He then gave me a -- a\npicture of himself and Emmy and their little daughter Edda, and wrote on the back of it that\nOberloitman Gillen has my confidence and -- and trust, and signed Hermann Goering, and the\ndate, August eighth, I remember, 1945. It was August -- yeah, I think it\u2019s August eighth.\nAnyhow, I went back there several weeks later on another business trip and stopped there, and\nthis time I showed the housekeeper the photo and she took it into Mrs. [indecipherable] Miss\n[indecipherable] -- Mrs. Goering, and she herself came to the door and invited me in. I only\nstayed a few minutes, just small talk and -- and talking to her a little bit. I promised that I would\ncome back, because I had someone else in the car with me as I recall, and I didn\u2019t want to make\ntoo much of a -- a visit out of it, other than my just delivering a letter, and so I promised to come\nback. And I went back again a couple of weeks later with a letter to the little girl from her father.\nAnd Mrs. Goering was in prison, she\u2019d been arrested by military government -- government for\nthe art treasures, and she certainly was involved in s-some of that art confiscation. And the little\ngirl was in a children\u2019s home. So I went to visit her and actually held her on my lap and read her\nfather\u2019s letter to her, which was a kind of an emotional experience that I wasn\u2019t soliciting. But\nthat was the occasion of -- of that partis -- personal visit. Others were -- wives visiting\nNuremberg during the time that I was working for Colonel Andrews directly, as sort of an\nassistant prison public relations officer. And when they had visitors like that, I know Mrs. Jodl\ncame, and Streicher\u2019s wife, and oh, two or three others that -- oh, von Ribbentrop\u2019s wife, who\nincidentally is a very ugly woman, personally di -- but she was a -- an heir to the Henkle\nchampagne people. In this case -- and he was a salesman for the champagne line, I think it was\nHenkle [indecipherable] Henkle or one of the others. Anyhow, he married the boss\u2019s daughter\nand this is how he -- how he got ahead. Von Ribbentrop, incidentally, I don\u2019t know if you knew\nthat he was not really a von. No, he -- h-he was born Ribbentrop, but there was an aunt who was\nmarried -- his mother\u2019s sister who was married to von Ribbentrop -- the other way around,\nbrother, who was knighted, and he had the right to the title von Ribbentrop. And at age 32, von\nRibbentrop himself, the foreign minister, Joachim, arranged for his aunt, Mrs. von Ribbentrop to\nadopt him at age 32, so that he would become Joachim von Ribbentrop. Which helped him\ntremendously because it helped sell him to Hitler, who was impressed by the von idea, plus the\nfact that von Ribbentrop could speak English and -- and other things. But she was another one\nwho came to visit in a relationship with families.",
        "A: In Nuremberg.",
        "A: No this is -- by the time the trials were ready to begin.",
        "A: To the staff, the American officers who were assigned, both the guard element and people like\nme, a-and the prison psychiatrist and anybody else involved in the trial procedure. There were\nthe -- the -- there was a tremendous judicial staff, lawyers and -- and others who were acting as\nthe -- well, assistants to the prosecuting staff. The prosecuting staff had, I think -- well, Colonel\nAmon was the deputy to Justice Jackson, Telford Taylor were the only two I ever had any\nrelationship with. I -- I interpreted for Amon on a few occasions, particularly the Ley episode\nwhere Ley was presenting his master plan, and -- and I\u2019m -- I\u2019m the one who took -- I took Ley\u2019s\ndocument to Colonel Amon and then he and Jackson ruled on insignificance of it and ordered me\nto -- to tell Ley that it wasn\u2019t any good. So Amon and -- and Telford Taylor are the only two I\nhad any connections with. Justice Jackson decided he could give a talk, a seminar to all of the\npeople connected with the prison. And the purpose of the seminar was to explain the\ninternational tribunal, because again, none of us knew what we were really doing -- what this\nwas all about, why we were having a tribunal and who was going to participate. The organization\nof the tribunal. The fact that we were having four judges and assistant judges from each of the\nmajor nations participating. And the prosecuting staff of each of the four nations. And the\nconduct of the whole trial, and -- and what we were doing. And even the -- the redesign -- not th\n-- the rebuilding of the Palace of Justice, which had been heavily bombed. And we had SS men\nwho were doing the hard labor on -- who -- building the tribunal room, which was ironic again, I\nthought, because their high ranking leaders were going to be tried in the courtroom that they\nwere repairing, in the building that they were reconstructing for this purpose. So Jackson\u2019s\npurpose was to explain this to us, and that was the first detailed account I ever received, the only\none for that matter, of what the purpose of the trial was, and what we were doing and had been\ndoing and why -- why we had been doing it. And I was quite impressed with Justice Jackson, I\nthought he was quite a -- an outstanding person.",
        "A: Well, I had my own questions about it, but again, that\u2019s from the standpoint of a then 27 year\nold, rather naive person. Question number one was, we had Soviet judges sitting at trial, for the\nkind of crimes that the Soviet Union had also committed. Somehow here is the kettle calling the\npot black, you know. And I knew that if I were preparing a defense and it were allowed, I would\ncertainly raise that question in a courtroom. You know, you are accusing us and finding us guilty\nof crimes that one of the judges up here represents a country which committed the same crimes.\nThat of course, was one of the first questions. Next question was strictly out of naivet\u00e9. The\nmoral position we were taking on the dropping of the atom bombs, for instance. While I, even to\nthis day say I think we did the right thing in dropping it, but from the standpoint of civilians\nbeing killed who really were not involved, and we were killing civilians too, weren\u2019t we, with\nthat bomb? I\u2019d say do it again if we had to under the same circumstances, but it still raised the\nquestion in my mind. It also made me think again about the very serious questions that Goering\nhimself, and Doenitz, and two or three other of the more intelligent of the high ranking personnel\nthat we had in captivity raised. They said -- not a question, but prediction they made, the day will\ncome when you wish Germany were on yo -- were on your side and helping you against the\nSoviet Union. That was only a year before the Cold War broke out. Their prediction was true.\nBillions that we have spent in creating a bulwark between western democracy and Soviet\ncommunism [indecipherable] Germany. And what we did in building up the -- the Marshall plan\nto begin with, in rebuilding Germany, to the point where I\u2019ve asked myself, who won the war?\nAnd that question certainly came up in this discussion. So while it was very informative from the\nstandpoint of the mechanics, from the standpoint of the philosophy of the trials, I had to ask\nmyself that question -- those questions. That was my -- not a reply to Jackson cause I wouldn\u2019t\ndare have stood up and asked those questions, but they came to mind, where th -- I still maintain\nto this day that the trial was fair, 1t was justice, I\u2019m proud to have been a part of it, and my only\nconcern now is as -- as I\u2019m approach old age, is the imitation of the Nuremberg trials that\u2019s\ngoing on around the world. And I think they take away from what the Nuremberg trials really\ntried to accomplish; that is to make it illegal to invade another country and enslave its people. To\nmake crimes against the peace, violation of treaties and non-aggression pacts an international\ncrime. To punish those who -- who practice crimes against humanity. Thou shalt not kill.\nNothing original about that, that goes back thousands of years, thou shalt not kill. And people\nwho do kill, whether they do it on behalf of their government or not, should be tried and\npunished. And thirdly, if you have an agreement on how to conduct a war, war crimes, define\nwhat the rules are, and if you break those rules, you\u2019re guilty of war crimes. Don\u2019t mix apples\nand oranges. Don\u2019t mix crimes against humanity with war crimes or crimes against the peace.\nAnd these imitation international tribunals going on now in certain places, are -- th-they\u2019re not\nreal, they\u2019re imitations. They\u2019re not the real thing. They don\u2019t have the same objective, they\ndon\u2019t have the same basis for operation, or for being. And we\u2019re -- we\u2019re opening doors there we\nmight be sorry about someday. And --",

It\u2019s a violation of -- of a -- a law. Rape is immoral, it\u2019s illegal, it\u2019s\nwrong. That man should be punished for rape. He shouldn\u2019t be punished for a war crime. That --",

        "A: Yeah. And they committed crimes against the Serbs, crimes against humanity. I mean, they --\nthey did the Nazi\u2019s bidding in Yugoslavia, and they committed crimes that were quite\nhorrendous. Now the tables are turned, Tito is gone and Milosevic comes into power.

And there are -- now people are saying that was a war crime. The Americans\nkilled those innocent civilians. When we invaded Panama to capture Noriega, some civilians\nwere killed. We hadn\u2019t declared war on Panama. We just invaded Panama to catch Noriega. And\nwe killed some civilians. There are now Panamanians who want restitution, and they want the\nUnited States to be tried for war crimes, because we invaded their country and killed civilians.",

        "A: -- and suffered by the Nazi regime, and they signed an accord, an agreement, an authorization,\nthat a trial should be established, and these people should be indicted for crimes against the\npeace, war crimes, crimes against humanity. Admitting that the crimes against the peace charge\nis -- was novel at the time, because it -- it had not yet been established that violation of a treaty\nwas an international crime. It takes a court process --",
        "A: -- to make that into law, so that was necessary. And there wasn\u2019t a country in the world which\nobjected to the international tribunal at Nuremberg, but how many people are objecting to what\u2019s\ngoing on in The Hague, or even in Geneva, or in some of these other international cour -- you\ndon\u2019t have a really international court if you don\u2019t have the agreement of the international\ncommunity in support of it. Now that -- that\u2019s my whole point. So when these people say -- and\nthis is largely in the media, the -- the trials in The Hague where so and so from Serbia is going to\nbe tried for war crimes, similar to the war crimes committed by the Nazis in Nuremberg, I think\nit takes away from the Nuremberg trials. It demeans them, because th -- it\u2019s not the same thing.\nThere\u2019s no comparison. Now, if -- who voted for the establishment of the inter -- international\ncriminal\u2019s court? United Nations. The majority vote of the members of the United Nations. All\nright. If you had a vote today against United States, do you think -- do you believe the majority\nof the members of the United Nations would vote for, or -- in support of or against the United\nStates?",

        "A: Yeah. There\u2019s still an awful lot that hasn\u2019t been revealed yet, and this is why I -- I\u2019m very\nsupportive of the efforts, for instance, of the Holocaust museum, and your oral history idea of\ngetting some of the story told. As I say, I do a lot of public speaking, and it depresses me when I\ntalk to young people who have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about high school and\ncollege students, and I mention names like Goering, Goebbels, Himmler, Streicher, Ley, and\nthey get a blank look on their face.

And\nthat is my -- what I\u2019m saying. I -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a comparison. They\u2019re not in the same\nlevel, they\u2019re not the same operation. So I think it\u2019s important for survivors to tell their story. I\nthink it\u2019s important for anybody whose had a connection, even -- o-or maybe especially, this\nvery new idea that this Dr. Latimer brings out in a book just -- just out, that Hitler was a victim\nof Parkinson\u2019s disease. Not a victim of, but had Parkinson\u2019s disease, and that influenced many of\nthe decisions he made. I -- I think that\u2019s a -- an interesting line to follow and -- and pursue, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. All together, yeah, sure.",
        "A: On me personally?",
        "A: You know, I\u2019ve -- I\u2019ve been asked that question before. It contributes substantially to, I think,\nmy maturity, to a certain amount of cynicism I have now. I just don\u2019t trust everybody just\nbecause he has a title. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that he\u2019s always right. In fact, it taught me also\nthat no matter how important you are, you still put your pants on one leg at a time. And I\u2019ve seen\nmen whose faces were on the cover of Time magazine, and Life magazine, full blown, in color,\nwho begged me for an extra tube of toothpaste, or even a stick of chewing gum, or a pack of\ncigarettes. And they were four star generals. They were ministers and -- and heads of state. And\nso I -- when I then came into the -- the commercial world and started working for a living, I\ndidn\u2019t swoon when the corporate executive -- when I called on the corporate executive to ask for\na major contribution to the Miami University foundation, because, you know, I -- I actually had\nunder my control people who were much more important than he was. I don\u2019t mean by that to --\nto demean the person, but all I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s -- 1t stopped me from being in awe of everybody\nwho has a title, or a position. And in turn, it taught me to respect the person rather than the title.\nAnd that I could have more respect for a corporal than I could for a five star general, because\nI\u2019ve seen five star generals that I wouldn\u2019t promote to corporal.",
        "A: See what I mean?",
        "A: A-And tha -- that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the lesson I learned. Cynicism to a certain extent, yes. But maybe\nit\u2019s made me a better citizen. I question things I hear now. I just don\u2019t take anything for granted\nbecause it comes from high above.",
        "A: Yes, yes, very much so. And I was just going to say, that\u2019s the other thing I -- I worry my\nwife because I -- I let news developments depress me, because I can see -- I can draw\ncomparisons. I can\u2019t help but feel -- and I\u2019ve been asked this question many times when -- when\nI was on [indecipherable], what is a typical Nazi? Blonde, blue-eyed Aryan, six feet tall? Mm-\nmm. The typical Nazis, if there is such a thing, and there is, in my book, I knew some. He could\nbe shorter than I am, he could be bald-headed. He could be fat, he could be skinny. He could be\nmistaken for an American if I met him on the street. There is no typical Nazi. You don\u2019t have to\nbe a German to be a Nazi.",
        "A: You have to be a certain personality, a certain type to be a Nazi, and it\u2019s not a physical type.\nIt\u2019s a person who fits a -- a category that would -- wouldn\u2019t hesitate to shoot you if it benefited\nhim. Or wouldn\u2019t hesitate to sell out his children if there was some benefit for him. A person\nwithout character. And I mentioned to you the quotation from fieldmarshall Kesselring. That left\na tremendous impression on me, because I got so involved as a boy in the Boy Scouts, and the\nBoy Scouts of America is about building character. And that stuck with me, and here 1s a five\nstar general, a fieldmarshall -- a general fieldmarshall, who tells me -- now I\u2019m 27 years old, and\nalmost three times the age of the cub scout that I was, saying character is more important than\nanything else. More important than knowledge and ability. And I remember that as a Boy Scout,\nthat\u2019s what I was taught. Character, integrity, telling the truth, being honest. Treating other\npeople as you would like to be treated. That\u2019s all part of being character. When I see what\u2019s\nhappening, and I give talks and people say, Nazism can happen only in Germany. I say, \u201cYou\u2019re\nwrong, Nazism can happen here in the United States.\u201d We have neo-Nazis in the United States.\nHatred, racism. I can see things repe -- I can see patterns repeating themselves, because there are\npeople without character, who are doing the kind of things that the Nazis did in Germany. And\nthey\u2019re doing the kind of things that enable them to come to power. And I see patterns in our\ncountry repeating what -- exactly what happened in Germany, during the 20\u2019s and the 30\u2019s. A\nlack of interest in supporting education at the local level. In Germany during the 30\u2019s, let Berlin\ntake care of it. Let the government handle it. We don\u2019t want to support our local schools. So the\nlocal gover -- the national government takes over the school system, and they pay the teacher\u2019s\nsalaries, and they pay for the schools. And then they also tell them what to teach, and they teach\nonly Nazism. And you can\u2019t be a teacher in Germany during those days without belonging to the\nNational Socialist Teacher\u2019s Association. I get a little bit worried when everybody has to belong\nto the NEA in the United States before they can teach. That bothers me. Maybe no problem. I get\nworried when I see nobody wants to be a scoutmaster any more. Nobody wants to volunteer for\nthe YWCA, or the YMCA, or -- or the y-m-a -- y -- young men Hebrew asso -- the volunteer\ngroups. People aren\u2019t interested. So what happens? Let the government organize a youth\nprogram. Then you have a Hitler youth, and a Baldur von Schirach, who organizes the boys and\nthe girls, because the local leaders don\u2019t want to do it any more. A-And this -- you can keep on\nmultiplying this. If you get a media that all sings the same tune, I get very depressed. When the\nmedia becomes the voice for one party, who is going to speak for the other party? Whose going\nto express their viewpoint? The [indecipherable] publications in Germany released all the\ngovernment news, and it was only news when -- the news was only what the Nazis wanted you\nto read. And then you had the Voelkischer Beobachter, and the -- and the -- the Der Stuemer, and\nall the Nazi newspapers, telling you exactly what the news is, their government news outlets. If I\nfeel that all the news 1s controlled, and in support of only one concept, I draw a comparison, I\nworry a little bit. There are signs. I frankly worry about gun control. People say to me, why\ndidn\u2019t the Jews defend themselves? Why didn\u2019t the Jews organize? I mean, they\u2019re -- they\u2019re\nsmart. Not just the Jews, but the others too, minorities in other countries, 1n -- in Germany and\ncountries that they occupy. What\u2019s the first thing Hitler did when he came to power after the\nburning of the Reichstag? Guns were illegal, confiscate all the guns. And the Gestapo had the\nright to come knocking at your door and search your home to see if you own a gun. I\u2019m against\ngun control. I\u2019m for gun registration. I think everybody owns a gun, like a car, ought to register\nthat gun. If he has it legally, he shouldn\u2019t object to that. Waiting period is fine. Your picture on a\ngun license, that\u2019s fine with me. But don\u2019t take away my right to carry a weapon. We did that tha\n-- we -- they did that in Germany. Instead we say, why didn\u2019t the people up -- weren\u2019t they\norganize -- defend themselves? With what? Pocket knives? I think -- I interpret the Constitution\nand our founder\u2019s purpose along that particular line. Our founders, in creating the United States,\nand our Constitution were getting away from King George and the oppression, and the\ndictatorship of that royal family. And they created the revolution, and they -- they had their\nmilitia men, and their minute men, who defended themselves and we have a free country. What\nif we get a government that deprives us of all of our freedoms? How do we -- we\u2019ve -- how do\nwe organize a revolution in defense of our -- of free thinking and of free spirits? Well, that\u2019s\nwhat it did to me. It makes me think about those things that -- and it depresses me if I am\nwrongly, or rightfully, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m -- I\u2019m right, I could be all wrong, but it still\ndepresses me as I make the comparisons. That\u2019s a long answer to your question.",
        "A: Yes. That was a very negative assignment. We had some of our officers -- this is during the\nnon-fraternization period. And some of our people in military intelligence -- high up military\nintelligence, ask themselves what can we do to win these people over? I mean, the war is over,\nbut the German people who -- they claim, look t -- to us as the liberators, those who were anti-\nHitler, but woke up to that fact much too late to do anything about it. By the time the German\npeople realized -- and I\u2019m not talking about an unknown quantity of German people, by the time\nthey realized they had lost any freedom, that they were now living under a very controlled\nmalignant dictatorship, it\u2019s too late to do anything about it, because the fear psychosis had been\nso firmly established. You know, parents couldn\u2019t talk about any ideas or about the government\nin their home, because the children would tell the teachers what their parents said about the\nHitler -- about the government, or whether they listened to BBC on the radio. And people were\nafraid to talk to their neighbors. The blocklighter might be listening. [speaks German here]. That\ncould also be taken the other way, the find -- the enemy could be the government. When people\nwoke up, it was much too late to do anything about that. So there are Germans who claimed,\nwhen the war was over, we look upon you Americans as having liberated us from this. But\ninstead of liberating us, you have subjected us to a fra -- non-fraternization policy, you won\u2019t\neven talk to us. Our schools are closed, and they been closed for -- for months. In the Soviet\nUnion, schools were opened a week after the war ended, with textbooks and everything already\nprinted. Schools in Germany, West Germany, in the American zone, and the British zone, didn\u2019t\nopen for nine months after the war ended. And when they did open, we used outdated textbooks\nand untrained teachers. We could have used a lot of those G.I.\u2019s who were fraternizing with\nGerman frauleins as schoolteachers, as youth organizers, to teach them something about\ndemocracy. But we didn\u2019t, we missed that opportunity. And some of the people, older than I and\nmore ma -- mature and wise, thought what did we do wrong, what are we doing wrong? Let\u2019s\nfind out. Let\u2019s get an opinion of -- of the people, let\u2019s get a -- a reaction. So secretly, four of us\nwere -- were selected. Selected only because we speak dialect. I -- I can speak the Zaar dialect\nbecause that\u2019s what we spoke at home, which is very much like the Luxembourg dialect. And we\nmingled among the German people, pretending to be German soldiers returning from PW camps,\nwe'd just been released. And we actually had German uniform and -- and we just sit in bus\nstations and we talk to people. And you know, I\u2019ve been a PW for the last two and a half years,\nand what\u2019s going on, you know, what\u2019s happening here? Wha -- what -- what happened in\nGermany? Why -- why is everything the way it is? Where did the -- the Third Reich fail? And\ngot their reactions. And what about the Americans? What do you think of them? And then we put\nall of that together in a report, and then my commanding officer was severely reprimanded,\nbecause it was critical of the -- of the way we were doing things in Germany after the war. And\nso they ordered all the copies of this report destroyed, and nothing ever came of it.",
        "A: Yeah. But it was only confidential, it wasn\u2019t top secret.",
        "A: But I kept a copy of it, and I quote from it in my book. I mean, in my own quotes, my own\nopinion, because I brought it back from question. And we -- we talked to people who confessed,\nI was a Nazi, yes. Especially women, who continued to be very ardent Nazis and who gave their\nopinion very freely. They were pining for the day when German troops come goose-stepping\ndown the street again. And we thought that our authorities ought to know that there are people in\nGermany who think that way. And the higher ups who got our report said, oh, you know, you\ntrying to tell us that the Germans are still Nazis, or -- that isn\u2019t so, we -- we\u2019ve -- we\u2019ve liberated\nthem, we\u2019ve done away with them, and they aren\u2019t Nazis. Well, there are Nazis in Germany still.\nEven as a tourist you can -- I can -- I can ferret them out when I\u2019m traveling. I -- I remember --\noh, this is -- should be off the record, but we -- we had organized the Miami alumni tour for\ninstance, in Denmark [indecipherable] 1n Copenhagen. And -- a tour, and I was the -- the tour\nhost, my wife and I organized the Miami alumni tour. And we came in -- one of the people in our\ngroup, a very good friend of mine, a Miami alumna, elderly woman, had hurt her knee very\nbadly on the tour, she could hardly walk, she was in agony and pain. We came into this dining\nroom in this hotel where we were staying. Came off the elevator and my -- my lady friend\nimmediately went to the nearest table to the elevator and sat down, so she wouldn\u2019t have to walk\nwith her painful knee. And this headwaiter came storming across the dining room. And before he\neven opened his mouth I could tell he was German. He was not -- no -- and not a Dane, he was a\nGerman, and with a very German accent, in English, he just told our friend, our fellow traveler,\nthat she was not allowed to sit there, she had to go to the end of the dining room where this\nwhole group is all eating together. You can\u2019t sit here, we will not serve you if you sit here. And\nhe was just sounding so much like a Nazi, all I had to do was close my eyes and -- and -- and see\nthe SS insignia. And I lost my cool; I never did that very often, but I just went over, in German,\nand I read him the riot act in -- 1-1n German, no uncertain terms, and what I thought of him, and\nthe Nazis and that this lady was going to be served right at this table, right by the elevator\nbecause she couldn\u2019t walk very far. And that was it. He actually clicked his heels. He said yavollt,\nand he served my lady friend at that -- and her companions, and she -- served at that table. The\nrest of the group ate at the end of the dining room, but this part of our group ate at that table.\nWell, some of my friends couldn\u2019t get over that, said, \u201cHow did you know he was a Nazi?\u201d And\nI could just tell he -- and he was, he was -- I\u2019d swear he was a Nazi.

And Germany -- I --\nHelmut Kohl in -- invited him to make an official state visit to Germany while he was in Europe.\nAnd Reagan accepted, and was going to Europe -- was going to Germany while he was in\nEurope for the summit conference, and it would be a state visit. Now, in a state visit, the -- the\nway it usually works is the ambassador of the host country and his counterpart in the United\nStates would get together and plan an agenda. And Helmut Kohl had requested of the German\nambassador to the United States that the president should accept an invitation for a state visit,\nand while there he ought to visit an American -- a -- a German military cemetery and lay a\nwreath to commemorate -- to -- to memorialize the -- the 40\" anniversary and to commemorate\nthe end of friction between Germany, a -- a gesture, a recognition of the bravery of those who\nfought, so forth, so forth. And Reagan, who was pretty easily ac -- accepting recommendation,\naccepted that he would -- he would do this. I was attending a birthday party for Arthur Burns,\nwho was our ambassador to Germany, and Arthur Burns told me that Reagan was coming to\nGermany for an official visit. And he thought that he shouldn\u2019t visit the German military\ncemetery, that would cause a lot of friction. Arthur Burns knew what the score was. And I agreed\nwith him. And then Arthur Burns said, \u201c\u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a counter-suggestion and have him\ncome to the American cemetery in Luxembourg instead?\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you, Arthur?\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cWe\u2019re both passing the buck.\u201d And he said, \u201cI\u2019m the host ambassador and if I get\ninvolved it\u2019s really a violation of protocol. I -- I shouldn\u2019t do this, because I\u2019m -- I\u2019m supposed to\ngo along with what the host government wants,\u201d and so forth. So I stuck my neck out and I sent a\ncable, and that was a mistake. There is such a thing as a White House signal, and that is a direct\ntelephone line from an ambassador to a White House office, the president, vice president, and\nalso the secure -- national security advisor. And you use that for really important messages. And\nI should have been brave enough to use the White House signal, be the only time I would have --\nhave used it. You\u2019d use it 1f Luxembourg is planning to declare war on the United States or\nsomething like that. But I should have used it to call the president and tell him -- to invite him to\ncome to Luxembourg, my proposal being that the helicopter, which is at his disposal would come\nfrom Bittburg where he was making an official visit to the military -- that was our biggest\nmilitary base, and our most important -- 15 -- 15 minutes less than, he could be in Luxembourg.\nHe could land in a parking lot, I had it all described, and lay a wreath at General Patton\u2019s tomb.\nThen go down 500 yards from the American cemetery, there\u2019s a German military cemetery\nwhere 11,000 Germans are buried. And he could lay a wreath there at the tomb of the unknown\nsoldier. And they could play [indecipherable] and guaranteed no SS, Waffen SS is buried in that\ncemetery, the Luxembourgers would never stand for it. The whole thing would take 45 minutes,\nhe could be back in Bittburg, no harm done, everybody would be happy, nobody would criticize.\nBut I made the mistake of s -- using a regular cablegram, which goes to the state department.\nAnd the state department routinely routes this to the European director, who routes it to the\npresident\u2019s office as a recommendation from an ambassador. And I think Michael Dever got it\nand f -- the gist of the cablegram I got back was in so many words, mind your own business. This\nis all settled. And that was the e-end of it. I should have had the courage to -- cause I\u2019d\ncorresponded with the president, and I had occasion to meet him on several occasions, after I\nbecame ambassador of course, but he knew who I was, and it was on Dear John basis. And I\nthink I could have gotten through to him, and I\u2019ve kicked myself ever since. But anyhow,\nReagan came to Bittburg and he went to the cemetery where some Waffen SS were buried, I\nforget, 49 or some -- what the number was. Michael Dever had been there to inspect the site, but\nthe cemetery was covered with snow, so he couldn\u2019t tell. Well, he could have gone to the\nregistration office, any high school kid could have told him that there were SS men buried in the\nAmerican military ceme -- Waffen SS. But he didn\u2019t [indecipherable] but that -- that was his\nproblem, among others. Well, then I received an invitation from the Jewish community\ncongregation in Luxembourg, that there was going to be sort of a protest ceremony at the same\ntime that Reagan was in Bittburg at the cemetery, at the American cemetery in [indecipherable].\nWould I accept to come? And my good friend, Mr. Ocks, who was the president of the\ncongregation was very surprised when I personally called him and said, \u201cOf course, I'll come,\nPll be very happy to be there.\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe it, he said, \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re putting you\non the spot.\u201d Beca -- I had a very good relationship with him, I used to give talks to a roomful of\nsurvivors from Luxembourg and -- and Rabbi Boltz is a -- a good personal friend, and used to\ninvite him to our embassy, along with the Catholic Archbishop of Luxembourg. Was always a\nvery in -- but they real good buddies, they were real good friends, h-had a very nice relationship.\nTalk about freedom of religion, they really have it over there. The respect. Grand Duke and\nGrand Duchess would come to synagogue on many occasions, and it was just a wonderful\nrelationship. Anyhow, when I accepted they were very much surprised, and I went. And that\u2019s\nwhere I met Rabbi Here, and also some other members of the Wiesenthal Center. And the second\nsurprise was that I was willing to make a talk -- give a talk, and so I did. And I brought greetings\nfrom the president. And I was wise enough to at least notify the president that I was going to be\nthere. Well, the media was there in force, and they really expected me to take off and either blast\nthe president or make some comment. And -- and I didn\u2019t, all -- the only thing I said was I think\nPresident Reagan should be here instead of in Bittburg, because this where he could have devil --\ndeliver a really significant message. But he\u2019s not, and I\u2019m here to represent him, and I bring you\ngreetings and then I\u2019m -- went into my spiel about how grateful we are those who sacrificed and\nwe'll never forget them -- made the regular speech for the occasion, and everybody was happy,\nexcept the media, cause I really let them down, I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t stick my neck out and\njeopardize my job. But I was jeopardizing it because if Reagan had taken offense, or somebody\nelse had wanted to take issue -- but Schulz was very understanding, and he complimented me.\nAnd Weinberger complimented me and they all said fine, everything is great. And then Reagan\u2019s\nown specch -- that afternoon, we went -- Winnie and I went to Bittburg and -- and heard his\nspeech and -- and I\u2019ve quoted his speech many times, and -- we can\u2019t undo what\u2019s been done, we\ncan\u2019t bring back to life those who have died, but the one lessons we\u2019ve been taught by World\nWar II is that good much triumph over evil -- I\u2019m quoting roughly, good must triumph over evil\nand freedom must triumph over totalitarianism. And a -- we should never forget the lessons\nlearned because that\u2019|l help us make a better future than -- the gist of his [indecipherable] which\nhe would build his speech. So everybody was okay, except the media, and the thi -- and people\nwho got the idea from some media presentations, with which I disagree, that he was perfectly\nwilling to go to that cemetery. Actually, at that point -- President Reagan was the kind of\npresident who relied pretty much on his lieutenants. He -- he delegated, and he was a eight to\nfive man, and some of that is good and some of it is bad. But he didn\u2019t get involved in details, he\nnever did. Some presidents get too involved in details and that\u2019s wrong, too. And you do have a\nstaff, you do have people around you and a cabinet, so take what you will of that. But -- but\nReagan really didn\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t think ever -- anybody ever told him that there were Waffen\nSS buried there. And if they had, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have known the difference, unless somebody\ntold him. I mean, how many people know the difference between the SS of the concentration\ncamp type and the Waffen SS? There is a difference. And the Waffen SS, unfortunately, was sort\nof an elite military unit, and sort of like our Green Berets and -- but toward the end, the Waffen\nSS ended up with a lot of regular SS men in it, and they began to do a lot of the things that the --\nthe occupying forces, the atrocities against the civilian population, and of course the\nconcentration camp, the thing [indecipherable] so there was a -- a definite mix, but the president\nwouldn\u2019t have known that. In fact, I don\u2019t think anybody in his staff would have particularly\nknown this, unless somebody told them.",
        "A: Well, and --",
        "A: -- ve enjoyed -- it\u2019s brought back a lot of memories, and --",
        "A: -- and so --",
        "A: Okay, yeah.",
        "A: That very attractive young lady was my wife. And that picture was taken on the last day in\ncivilian clothes. She and I spent the day in our favorite park in Cincinnati, where we were living\nat the time. So Winnie and I were wandering around the park and visiting different places that\nwere very dear to us, celebrating the last day in -- before I had to go into the army.",
        "A: And this is in Eden Park in Cincinnati. And this is the last picture taken of me in civilian\nclothes for four and half years. The following day I went into the army at Fort Thomas,\nKentucky.",
        "A: Now this is the other extreme, almost the last day in uniform. This picture was taken in\nGermany with my own Jeep, you\u2019ll notice that\u2019s Jeep number one, and the name on the -- the\nwindshield is Johnny Mike, our first-born son. We had the privilege in those times of adding our\nown name, or any name we choose to our Jeeps and I named mine for our first-born son, Johnny\nMike.",
        "A: This is the Palace Hotel in Mondorf, Luxembourg. It was the special detention center, code\nnamed Ashcan, where we kept the high ranking Nazis during the summer of 1945, in preparation\nfor the Nuremberg trials. The 10 foot barbed wire fence completely around the compound, and a\nmachine gun tower in each of the four corners, indicates the security being taken to keep the\nprisoners in, and any visitors who might want to take justice into their own hands, out. But that\u2019s\nthe Palace Hotel --",
        "A: -- nicknamed Ashcan.",
        "A: That -- that\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "A: Actually taken clandestinely by a Luxembourger, who wasn\u2019t supposed to know what\u2019s going\non inside there, but he did. And it was actually during our embassy years that he gave it to me,\nsaid it\u2019s the picture I took, along with several others. This is the Palace Hotel when it\u2019s still a\nPalace Hotel, also a casino in connection with the spa, the health resort, which makes up\nMondorf and is the major industry in Mondorf. But when you put the fence around it, the\nmachine gun towers, and the camouflage nets, then you have Ashcan. This is the peaceful Palace\nHotel, which incidentally has since been torn down. And the Luxembourgs -- the Luxembourgers\ndecided they needed a more modern casino, and they also felt that they din -- didn\u2019t want this to\nbecome a national shrine to which Germans could make pilgrimages, and pay tribute to the Nazis\nlast home. So they tore it down, and bi --",
        "A: This is a group photograph that actually appeared in Time magazine in their November 1945\nissue, after we open up our facility to the media. Time magazine took this picture, they called it\nthe class of 1945, with the class president, Hermann Goering, the Reichsmarshall, occupying the\nmost prominent place. The Reichsmarshall considered himself the -- the leader still, even though\nhe had been defrocked, more or less, by Hitler.",
        "A: His competitor in this particular case was Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, who had been named\nby Hitler to be his successor, so that in this situation, both Goering and Doenitz competed with\neach other for leadership of the class of 1945.",
        "A: Now this is a close-up of a -- a section of the fence that completely surrounded the compound\nwhere Ashcan, the Palace Hotel was located. The bottom strand of wire, barbed wire, has a sign,\n[speaks German] because that was the electrified wire. If you stepped across that one, then you\ntook your life in your hands. This is one of the machine gun towers. There were four of them on\neach -- one on each corner of the fence on the compound. A man with a 30 caliber machine gun\nand two armed guards. This is the entrance to the Palace Hotel. And the guest just being ushered\nin, carrying his own suitcase, is Baldur von Schirach, the Hitler youth leader and former\ngaolighter of Vienna. This is one of the rooms inside the Palace Hotel, which served as the\nbarber shop and also as a first aid office for the doctor and a dentist who took care of the -- the\ninmates.",
        "A: This is actually one of the rooms in the Palace Hotel. As a matter of fact, it happens to be\nHermann Goering\u2019s room. Note that the complete furnishings are the folding army cot, which did\nhave a straw mattress on it, and then a rather shaky chair, and table, and a washstand. Iron bars\non the window, plastic Plexiglas. And the view from that particular room of the approach, the\ngardens of the Palace Hotel is on this picture. We did allow the prisoners to walk 1n this\nparticular area inside the barbed wire enclosure. By comparison, when the prisoners were moved\nfrom Luxembourg to Nuremberg, they were put into a Franconian state prison, and this is one of\nthe cells in that Franconia state prison, where they spent their time all during the course of the\nNuremberg trials, both before and during the trials, until they were sentenced to death, or moved\nto prison in Berlin. This is another view of the same cell with the window and a new paint job.",
        "A: Note -- note the niche in that cell, that actually is where the ho -- the toilet is located with the\nstand pipe and a flush button at the top, which Robert Ley, the leader of the German labor front,\nthe arbeitsfront, used to strangle himself with a piece of towel, by sitting on the toilet and putting\nforce against the noose that he had manufactured and fastened to the pipe. When he was on the\ntoilet he was out of sight of the 24 hour guard who was outside his door, checking on him.\nMoved the spotlight over the door -- o-over the -- the window in the door on the -- this is the\ndining room in the Palace Hotel in Mondorf where the prisoners ate their meals, served on\nporcelain plates with spoons only, no knives or forks permitted. The food was prepared by\nordinary German prisoners, who also did the serving. [indecipherable] Ribbentrop eating -- this\nis at the mess facilities in Nuremberg, before they were being served in the individual cells. Note\nthe mess kits, and the regular fare that prisoners -- prisoner of -- prisoners of war are consuming\nby rules of Geneva Convention, 1600 calories, no more, no less.",
        "A: This is the pass, a very rare one, issued by the internal security detachment. If you had this\npass, you were permitted in the war criminals wing of the Nuremberg prison, where only the 22\nmajor Nazis were to be tried in the first session of the tribunal were being interned -- interred --\ninterned.",
        "A: Yeah, this 1s a -- the pass that admits you to the Palace of Justice, the -- the court session\nitself, and also the officers in the area. The other pass entitled you to the war criminals wing\nonly. This pass also entitled you to visit the Nazis in another wing, who were not being tried at\nthe first session tribunals.\n"
