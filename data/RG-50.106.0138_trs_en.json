        "Q: Mm-hm. And was the relations good generally fo \u2014 in the school with the\nchildren from the two different religions?",
        "A: I never knew any difference, so I really, when people talk about anti-Semitism\nand this and that, I don\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel any, you know, except once in\nawhile or \u2014 later on the Polish \u2014 the teach \u2014 teacher of Polish would say, you don\u2019t\nsay it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a st \u2014 it stands in a \u2014 it stands in a newspaper, that\u2019s a German\nexpression, which of course you pick it up from if they were talking Yiddish at\nhome, you know, th-they tranpor \u2014 transported that into Polish, and that \u2014 that\u2019s the\nonly thing I remember the teacher says, that he says don\u2019t say that because that\u2019s not\ngood Polish, and that was the only thing. But I \u2014 I didn\u2019t see any difference, I mean,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI played with them and went to school with them and \u2014 and I did even a sinful thing\nbecause sometimes we would feed them ham sandwiches, and \u2014",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself as a child? Were you outgoing, or were you\nquiet?",
        "A: Oh, I was very outgoing and very curious. Any [indecipherable] that did \u2014 I was\nalways very inquisitive, why is it so, and a \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and how it could \u2014 it \u2014 how\nis it that is so and so. And it was in the same school that \u2014 I don\u2019t know what grade\nhe was, but anyhow, the \u2014 there was a time when the ve \u2014 Viennese Jews came to\nPoland. And of course they were very rich and brought their stuff and bought houses\nand all that, and \u2014 but the kids had to come to school with us. And a \u2014 they didn\u2019t sp\n\u2014 when they \u2014 the parents always spoke German, but the kids would answer them in\nPolish. And \u2014 but there was this one who, well I think we were just so jealous of her\nbecause she was big and \u2014 and she had a maid who carried her satchel to school. But\nof course she was so heavy that she couldn\u2019t carry all this stuff. And there were four\nof us going along the side \u2014 in the \u2014 Beniki(ph) there was this \u2014 this close to the\nVistula river, so there\u2019s this part where you walk, but \u2014 but then 1t comes down. Not\nin a ditch, but it just \u2014 and the bank lowers a little bit towards the street. And low \u2014\nwe all \u2014 there were four friends of us, and we all wish we\u2019d got together, and so\nwhenever this girl and the maid would come, we wouldn\u2019t let her through. And one\nday, I don\u2019t know why, one of us, some newcomer came and she \u2014 sh-she joined the\nFebruary 2, 2001\ngroup and it came so that we pushed this other gir \u2014 not the girl, but the maid fell\ndown. And so she went to the school and she complained that we are misbehaving\nand all that kind of stuff, and then the teacher called us in and then the principal\ncalled us in, and then the teacher said \u2014 cause she went to the principal and then the\nprincipal told the teacher that \u2014 what kind of children she\u2019s bringing up. Course, that\nwas a class of 40 kids, so she couldn\u2019t really watch over everyone. But she says to\nus, why did you push them, or did you push her? And somebody says, because she 1s\na Jew. And the teacher said, uh-uh, then you would push Holy Mary in the ditch too.\nNo, never. How would we? She said, oh yes you would, and you would put Jesus in\na ditch, too. And we said why? She says, because they were Jews. And of course,\nnobody ever told us that, you know, you always talk about all this other stuff. And\nwe had a religion class every day, so the Jewish girls went to school, th-they had a\nfree period, and then on \u2014 when they had to go to school, I think on Sunday they had\ntheir religious school, so for religion they went to their own rabbi. And so there was\n\u2014 I had an afet \u2014 uncle who was an atheist, and he all \u2014 and this preacher \u2014 I mean,\nthis religion teacher always says, any questions? And this uncle of mine always\nwould ask \u2014 say ask him about this and that, and there were all kinds of questions,\nyou know, that a priest couldn\u2019t really answer to s \u2014 little children. And so this day,\nit \u2014 I\u2019m just keep on, you know, telling him [indecipherable] when he said, are there\nany questions, I say, yeah, yeah, he \u2014 but he just want \u2014 disregarded me, because he\nFebruary 2, 2001\ndidn\u2019t want any stupid questions again. But I almost knock his glasses off, and I say\n\u2014 so he says okay, now what is it today? And I say, is this true that J-Jesus was a\nJew? And he say, yeah, and his mother and his apostles and the first Christians were\nJews. And then I say, how come we never knew about it, you know. But anyhow, I\nthink that from that moment on, mine attitude toward Jews was changed. You know\nthere was that, before when I \u2014 when I looked \u2014 course, you couldn\u2019t tell who was a\nJew if they were not having the itzkeys(ph) and all that kind of stuff, and the\nmitzkeys(ph) on top, or howarts(ph) with all this stuff, you couldn't tell. But then\nsince that time I keep looking, you know, whether I \u2014 cause there was this stupid\nidea that I recognize Jesus in one of them, but I mean \u2014 anyhow, that\u2019s how my\nattitude \u2014 I never had any non-attitude toward Jews since they were my school\nfriends, okay, and school friends don\u2019t talk about religion. You talk about your\nschool things, and your girl things and you don\u2019t talk about big things. But since\nthen I\u2014I was more friendly, and how would I say? Yeah, more interested, you\nknow. And so then when I was [indecipherable] my best friend was Sarah\nFeldman and they lived on the corner there. By the way in the same house that the\npope used to live as a little boy. And that was on the Vistula river. W-We live on\nthis corner, on the Debieniczka(ph) market, and on the other one, Sarah Feldman\nlive in this house, and here\u2019s some place lived the present pope as a young boy. And\nSarah was telling me something about the Diaspora, you know. Course, it wasn\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\ncalled Diaspora in those days, but she says [indecipherable] Jew, and I just didn\u2019t\nbelieve her, you know. I always thought there \u2014 I thought this old par \u2014 Polish Jews\nwere \u2014 there were no Jews anyplace else but in Poland. Especially then, when I went\nto school, we are no longer \u2014 we are asked never to call them Jews, but Poles of\nMosaic confession \u2014 or persuasion, pardon me. Because my te \u2014 now my teacher\nsaid, this word Jews is a word that came from Russia and it was an insulting word.\nAnd that\u2019s where you to \u2014 when we \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t be using it. And \u2014 but then, you\nknow how when you says Pole of a Mosaic persuasion, how long that is, your\nmouth, you \u2014 to say she 1s \u2014 and we never said she is Jewish. I don\u2019t know, maybe\nwe did. No [indecipherable] and we always says in the Jewish she or he, because in\nPolish that\u2019s possible. And anyhow, that\u2019s how I was brought up. You know, even\ntoday when I do the translations for the Red Cross and it says of nationality Polish,\nand religion, I always say Mosaic, because I \u2014 I had to \u2014 and they always would put\n\u2014 tho-those who correct those things said Jewish, and I said no, so I wrote j \u2014 the\nPolish Red Cross and I said, now what is it? Because when I went to school, in\n[indecipherable] documents, it said confession, it says either Roman Catholic or\nEvangelic or whatever, or Mosaic. I mean, there was no such a thing like Jewish. So\n\u2014 and besides I say to this lady in the Red Cross, that\u2019s an insult. And\n[indecipherable] Jews used an insulting words where it\u2019s possible, you know. And \u2014\nbecause they didn\u2019t know any different. But anyhow, so that\u2019s how \u2014 if you have\nFebruary 2, 2001\nfriends \u2014 and this also played \u2014 how to say, not \u2014 I don\u2019t know, of course, in \u2014 in the\ngymnasium too, we had girls who were Jewish, and one of my \u2014 I was one Eva, and\nthe other one al \u2014 Eva Kliseberg(ph). But then we were in \u2014 we used a bad Polish \u2014\nwell we \u2014 if we wanted to insult her, if somebody wanted to insult anyone whose\nname end in erg, like Kliseberg(ph) or Oberberg(ph) or something, well in Polish\nthere, to indicate a young girl, a daughter of somebody, you end \u2014 you put the ending\nuvna to indicate that she is an unmarried young girl. Now, but if your name ends in\nG, [indecipherable] and you end and you add this uvna, that gives you a word for\nhuman waste. And so the teacher would say, my goodness gracious, we \u2014 you\u2019re\nsupposed to say po \u2014 in Polish, the \u2014 the gare(ph) changes to jer(ph). And she\n[indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff and how she was a movie star, theater\nstar. She played with Martha Eggert(ph) and this Polish singer, forgot his name.\nBut anyhow she was a beautiful girl, I [indecipherable] Polish officer who was an\ninvalid, he left his \u2014 lost his leg during the war. And I will never see such a beautiful\ngirl, and we were so jealous of her mother because her mother was always assisting\nher, comes to class, picks her up and all this. And the jealousy is a long-lived\nsentiment, you know. But anyhow \u2014 but, I mean, she survive Auschwitz and she\nlives in Szezecin, or Stettin and she is in the theater and we correspond and\n[indecipherable]. And one time we had the school ball and the \u2014 both of us were\nchosen queen, as a \u2014 were a little crown on the \u2014 and she didn\u2019t even know. And \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001\nand \u2014 and I said we just look at the school picture and you see you got something on\nyour head. And I don\u2019t know how the teacher did it, but they give us two crowns,\none for her and one for me. But she was a gorgeous little girl, and she probably still\nis. And of course the girls \u2014 and the only time that I saw her during the war was on\nthe street. And she is working together with the other ones to work on the \u2014 to clean\nthe streets of snow. And when I saw her I couldn\u2019t believe it. I said, what are you\ndoing here? And she says, go away because they gonna take you, too. So I ran away.\nThat was the only time that I saw her during the war, before she went to Auschwitz.\nBut she survived. I couldn\u2019t imagine she wouldn\u2019t, you know, with her luck and\nbeautiful looks. And she was a good \u2014 she could have very easily said, because \u2014 that\nshe was not Jewish, cause you can\u2019t prove it. But then you could be denounced\nsometimes and that was even worse.",
        "Q: Were you a very athletic, strong child?",
        "A: Oh no, I was very anemic and I know that because I couldn\u2019t get to write \u2014 th-the\nPolish or European one has a little hook, and I never knew whether the hook was on\nthe right, the left. Anyhow, I couldn\u2019t make a very nice one, and the teacher always\ncomplained, this Madame [indecipherable]. And she said, why can\u2019t you write a\none as beautifully as you write a two? Because the two has those curly-curlies and I\nkind of like them, but the one, it was just too sharp for me. And I \u2014 and I say, w-will\nI live to the year 2000? And she said \u2014 she looked at me and she says, you? And \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001\ncause I was small, anemic and thin and she looks at me, says oh child, no, no. None\nof us will live to the year 2000. But then she says, why? Why do you want to live to\nthe year 2000? I said, well because you always praise my two and you always\ncomplain about \u2014 I didn\u2019t say complain, I don\u2019t remember what exactly I said \u2014 or\nbecause you love \u2014 you like my two and you don\u2019t like my one. So if \u2014 if it was the\nyear 2000, I always get a praise for you. And that\u2019s \u2014 and I was a thin, and then I \u2014\nvery anemic, had to drink this horrible fish liver oil and all that. You never \u2014 your\nchildren \u2014 I mean, this the ge \u2014 your generation didn\u2019t have to suffer from this fish\nliver oil, but we did. I sold it too, I\u2014 I paid my cousin, one of the cousins I was\nliving with to drink it for me. We put it first in the flower pots, but then we \u2014\neverybody knew there was a fish odor in the flower plants, but he loved it, so he was\njust gulping it. I think I paid him like a cent or something like that.",
        "Q: Did you like to read, did you have other interests?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I was an avid reader, I always get prizes for reading nicely and reading\nmany books. And I used to misbehave to be able to stay after school, and the teacher\nalways would work in the library. And one day she says to me, now what 1s it with\nyou? Why do you \u2014 because that was a \u2014 for her it was a pain in the neck to have to\nhave this \u2014 watch this kid in the library all the time. And I said well, because I can\nread books. And she says, what? You can get all the books you want and you don\u2019t\nha \u2014 and I don\u2019t have to be here with you. And besides that, I returned to that village\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwhere I lived in the country when I was little and I had a cousin there. Well, actually,\nit was really a son of \u2014 of \u2014 of that aunt that brought me up. And he went to some\nkind of photograph school or something like that and here\u2019s this big box with books.\nAnd I looked in this \u2014 in this \u2014 one time he forgot to lock it, so I\u2014 I looked at \u2014 in,\nthere was this one book about legends or something and I started reading it. And I so\nloved it that I went through many books, which I can understand anyhow. But\nanyhow, ever since then I loved reading. I learned that you can have the whole world\nto yourself when you read books.",
        "Q: What languages did you speak? Ju \u2014 more than Polish?",
        "A: Well, in \u2014 at that time I only spoke Polish. And \u2014",
        "Q: Then after elementary school you went on to \u2014",
        "A: To the gymnasium [indecipherable] had to choose, and you could either take \u2014\nwe \u2014 we had to have Latin, but you could choose either French or German, but that\nwas this time when the \u2014 and my father said, you have to know the language of your\nenemy, so I would suggest you take German. And I said no-nothing to it, Pll never\ntake any German.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what did you know about German and Germany?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see now, that was the year \u2014 see, there was already from 30 \u2014 what I\nknew it\u2019s from that atheistic uncle, he read the \u201cMein Kampf\u201d and he wa \u2014 had to \u2014\nand he was in the business of foreign exchange. And of course when you\u2019re in that\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbusiness you have lots of Jewish clientele. And he was telling them, you know, that\nif he \u2014 1f \u2014 if they know what\u2019s good for them, they would emigrate. And they said\noh, what does this dumb Polack knows, you know, and all that kind of stuff. They\nwouldn\u2019t listen. And then I remember that during the war one of them, because he\nsaved some of them, he said, gosh, how ba \u2014 how dumb were we that we didn\u2019t\nlisten to you. Because they had the money, they could have gone away. But \u2014",
        "Q: What was your uncle\u2019s name?",
        "A: Jakub(ph). Very nice Christian name, too. Jakub Seftrik(ph). And he was a \u2014 he\nwas the fellow who during the war ask me \u2014 my mother was very \u2014 I\u2019d say \u2014 I don\u2019t\nwant to say bad words about her, but I would say she spent half a day she \u2014 oh \u2014 in\nprayer, okay [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So she was a very religious woman?",
        "A: Yeah, but more than that. I mean, she was overly religious, you know, she paid\nfor her childhood sins [indecipherable] maiden sins or whatever [indecipherable].\nBut anyhow, since my uncle, who \u2014 he ask us \u2014 he ask me \u2014 es \u2014 he kind of asked\nme things that I thought were kind of funny. And he says, do you think you would\nhave room for an old lady in your house? And I said, my mother can ope \u2014 for\nmoney my mother \u2014 for rent my mother can always find a room. So they made up \u2014\nwhat it really was, it was the family of this lady left, and they left this Jewish old\nlady alone with the cook. And so, my uncle made out that this lady was a nanny\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwhom the Jews left, and \u2014 and she was old and that\u2019s why this [indecipherable] the\ncook was taking care of her. Which in reality she was not. But the trouble with this \u2014\nso we took her in \u2014 other \u2014 my mother took her in, no-not knowing who she was.\nAnd I swore that I would never tell. And so in this [indecipherable] I was bringing\nfood and feeding and what kind of stuff. And I don\u2019t know what \u2014 she died\npeacefully, because I was taken to Germany, so I never went to the funeral or\nanything like that. But anyhow, she died peacefully in her bed. But the thing was that\nshe had to look Catholic, so I went to the \u2014 well, and the pri \u2014 th \u2014 my uncle says,\nyou have to buy her a rosary, cause all old Polish woman had the rosary, you know.\nAnd you have to teach her some prayers, so that she, you know \u2014 the trouble with\nher was that she was already a little deaf. And teaching her wasn\u2019t very easy. So I\nhave \u2014 I beny \u2014 I belong to the sodality, you know, as a servants of Mary, and I had\na couple girlfriends [indecipherable] kind of change, and by the time we\u2019re \u2014 well,\nshe finally learned how to say Halle(ph) Mary, and what\u2019s this other one. No\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t even know how you say that in English. But anyhow, there\nare two prayers that you have to say for the rosary, and then you have to say the\n\u201cOur Father,\u201d [indecipherable] the \u201cOur Father.\u201d But anyhow \u2014 but she finally\ngot it and all she did was sitting on this bed with this rosary in her hand and saying\nthis rosary all the time. And \u2014 but I was \u2014 I was okay. But she never talked much\nabout Jewishness, because she was one of those Gentile \u2014 I mean, Polandized\nFebruary 2, 2001\nJewish, you know. And besides, she was deaf, so when you had to talk to her, you\nhad to shout and you really couldn\u2019t get any \u2014 she would say, huh? What?",
        "Q: Whe-When did you first start hearing about a man named Hitler?",
        "A: Oh, it must have been in 30 \u2014 \u201933 or I\u2014no, it must have been \u201933 when my uncle\ngot this \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d cause they were selling it in \u2014 so 1t must have been in 30 \u2014\nbefore \u00b033.",
        "Q: And what did he mean to you, what did Hitler mean to you when you were\nyoung?",
        "A: Well, my uncle always said that he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he was a tyrant and he was\ndangerous, that\u2019s all he was always saying, but he didn\u2019t explain the book to me and\nall anything like that. But he says that this man means trouble for Poland, that\u2019s\nwhat he said. And our f \u2014 now tho \u2014 1n those days he didn\u2019t mean much to me and\nexcept that that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to learn any German because that had a\nconnections with him and my father said you \u2014 you learn the language of your\nenemy. And so \u2014 but anyhow I didn\u2019t take German, I took French, and I didn\u2019t \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kristine Belfoure. This is tape one, side B, and\nyou were talking about how your father wanted you to take German, but you did not.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: No, I took French and I didn\u2019t learn German til the war started. And when all the\nPoles of German heritage didn\u2019t want to sign up the volkes(ph) list, so they were all\nkicked out from what they call the vartigal(ph) and they had \u2014 they had to leave\ntheir homes with nothing on them, but they had one thing, they spoke German. And\nthe way for them to make a living was to give German lessons. And so then\neverybody wanted to help them, and [indecipherable] then I realized that my father\nwas right. So I took the lessons from someone, a lady, and then \u2014 then there were no\nmore Polish schools, so there were all \u2014 people were trying to get some kind of\nschooling for their children. And because in Krakow there are lots of Poles of\nGerman descent, or Austrian descent, so they \u2014 they said, you can\u2019t just leave those\nchildren out of two \u2014 two classes of high school. We have to have something else. So\nthey had some kind of petition and they change, because the academic high schools\nwere all over, they were all finished, but they \u2014 they turned \u2014 they started a new\nschool for kindergarten teachers. And so we went to school underground for normal\nclasses to continue our high school, but on top we were doing all this getting ready\nto be kindergarten teachers.",
        "Q: Before we talk about that, let\u2019s just talk a little bit about \u2014 more about before \u2014\nthe time before the war started. Before 1939, before September \u00b039, did you notice\nany different treatment of the Jews in your town?",
        "A: Well, let me see.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: Before the Germans came.",
        "A: Before the Germans.",
        "Q: Or did life go on normally?",
        "A: Yeah, life \u2014 for me went on normally because I went to the same \u2014 with the same\npeople, I knew those same girls. And personally, I didn\u2019t. I lived in a \u2014 how shall I\nsay it, you know, a place where \u2014 I-I didn\u2019t \u2014 I mean, I was never there where\nprobably the action was, and there weren\u2019t any new index and index was the \u2014\nthere\u2019s this \u2014 th-they call this national [indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff.\nBut I never associated with them or anything like that, so I really didn\u2019t notice it.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: So until September \u00b039, life was going along normally?",
        "A: Very normally for me and for my Jewish friends, too. But \u2014",
        "Q: And then what was your f \u2014 when \u2014 what \u2014 what was the first change or the first\nsight of German soldiers? What \u2014 what do you first remember?",
        "A: Well, I first remember \u2014 well, the first re \u2014 memories is on the big marketplace,\nthe Germans came in and set up their tents, the soldiers then started shaving and\nwashing and all that kind of stuff. So Krakow was left alone because they thought\nit\u2019s \u2014 you know, they \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful city and they wanted it as probably their\ncapitol. They didn\u2019t even steal the golden domes from the churches. And so I \u2014 I\nonly saw the regular young men washed and shave and all that kind of stuff. And a\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbunch of my Jewish boys who were talking to them and asking them question\nbecause they were \u2014 you know, they were \u2014 they were the ones who knew German.\nAnd we\u2019re \u2014 so 1f we wanted to know something, we say ask him why this and all\nthat sort of thing. But there was no terror, there was no \u2014 terror started when the\neinsatz \u2014 wh-when \u2014 after the soldiers came, the Einsatztruppen(ph), that\u2019s when\nall those things started. And that\u2019s what is big about the difference between the\nRoman Catholic Poles and the Mosaic Poles started to blew up, and the big signs on\nthe kiosks came that all Jews have to report and that no Pole is allowed to work for a\nJew or any Jewish store, or in the Jewish household. And later on that any Pole\ncaught helping a Jew or giving him food or shelter would be shot and all that kind of\nstuff. So people started being afraid.",
        "Q: What was your \u2014 I mean, you were young, you were 15 - 16 years old. What \u2014\nwhat \u2014 what was your reaction, as a teenager?",
        "A: I just \u2014 I \u2014I just really couldn\u2019t believe that people of Schiller and Guta(ph)\ncould do anything like that. I mean, that was my reaction. And I just couldn\u2019t believe\nit, til the first person \u2014 first persons that were punished was the Polish intelligentsia.\nIn our house there was dot \u2014 a dentist\u2019s son \u2014 I mean there was a son of a lady who\nwas dentist. And another one was \u2014",
        "Q: You lived in an apartment house?",
        "A: Yeah.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: And then the other lady\u2019s son was a medical student, and then another \u2014 it was the\nthree people whose sons went to Auschwitz. So we knew what was going on in a\nsense that we always met at this tailor [indecipherable] you know [indecipherable]\ntailor, and that was usually the place where everybody went to for gossip and all that\nkind of stuff. And so that was where we met and she was telling us about\nAuschwitz, but she just used to make a package for her son and we all would give\nher something to \u2014 to put it in a package and all that. And \u2014",
        "Q: These are Polish Christians who were sent to Auschwitz?",
        "A: Polish Christians, yeah. And then this other lady \u2014 well, anyhow, we all kind of\nmet at this tailor\u2019s and these ladies were telling us about Auschwitz and about their\nsons and we could never understand how a dentist \u2014 why a dentist would end up \u2014 in\nthose days we had absolutely no idea that they idea was to kill the intelligentsia and\nleave the old, poor folks alone so they can do with them what they want. And so\nthose three men \u2014 so we knew about Auschwitz. But up un \u2014 we had no idea what\u2019s\n\u2014 why. A-And you just keep asking yourself. And \u2014 but that\u2019s \u2014 but I knew about\nAuschwitz immediately what \u2014 because the first day, that first day that they \u2014 war\nwas over, they started rounding up Polish intelligentsia and shipping them off. And\nthe teachers too, and they didn\u2019t make \u2014",
        "Q: The first day the war began, you mean?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: No, th-the first day the war was ended. I mean, the Polish campaign didn\u2019t last\nvery long.",
        "Q: Oh, oh-oh that, I see what you mean.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I thought you meant World War II.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, the Polish campaign, okay?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where the horrors really started. And at first they really \u2014 although\nsomebody said, one of the ladies, oh yeah, her son was a teacher and she says no, she\ntold the dentist\u2019s mother, the first one to go are the teachers. And they didn\u2019t give a\ndarn whether the teacher was a Jew or Pole, as long as he was a teacher, they just\nwanted to do away with the people who can stand against them or start trouble or\nanything like that. So because they were on a list of \u2014 of \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I heard it\nsomeplace, a list of teachers that are arrested, and it didn\u2019t make any difference who\nthey were, whether they were Catholic or Jews, a Mosaic, pardon me. My teacher\nwouldn\u2019t like that. And anyhow, that\u2019s where the \u2014 then when the Einsatztrup(ph) \u2014\nthen there all you see 1s the Jews in the winter, because \u2014 having to clean the streets\nand do all kind of stuff like that, and you couldn\u2019t go into a Jewish store and they\nwere all closed. Or what the Jew \u2014 suppose that you \u2014 a Jewish store di \u2014 sometimes\nthey make some kind of contract with their workers, or their salespeople and so\nFebruary 2, 2001\nsometimes they were given the \u2014 selling the business or something like that. I mean,\nthere was all kinds of deals that were done just to \u2014",

        "A: No, never. We were kind of sheltered, you know, in a way. I knew about what\nwas happening, because my uncles said, if you didn\u2019t \u2014 if this lady \u2014 if you don\u2019t\ntake this lady she \u2014 she will die. So I knew that \u2014",
        "Q: And why did you do \u2014 I mean, that was very brave of you as a teenager. Why did\nyou do this?",
        "A: Well, after all, I was a sodality and I was supposed to be doing good deeds. So,\nbesides I did a favor for my uncle. And another thing, I used to steal apples from this\nlady\u2019s ya \u2014 orchard. I mean, not steal, but \u2014 well, yes. This family had a beautiful\nvilla and they had these gorgeous pears. And anyhow, I feel like it was doing for\natonement [indecipherable] know about the pears tha \u2014 and apples I stole from her\ngarden.",

        "Q: Were you aware of the danger of what you were doing?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t, it was an adventure. Same thing like I was \u2014 and I just don\u2019t know,\nmust have been that uncle of mine, because I was asked to \u2014 to meet somebody \u2014 oh,\nin Krakow there\u2019s a street that\u2019s nothing but booksellers, called Spitana(ph). And\nthere were lots of \u2014 a very many of the booksellers were antique \u2014 it was called antiq",
        "Q: Antiquarian.",
        "A: Antiquarians who were very famous, they had \u2014 so I know that one day I was\napproached to \u2014 I don\u2019t know, they were fe \u2014 my uncle says, you know, I have a job\nfor you. And I say, yeah, what kind, you know, cause he always need jobs for me.\nAnd he says, I want you to meet somebody. And so I met this gentleman, this\nsukanice(ph) and he says, I-I need you do me a favor, to take this package and\ndeliver it to the ghetto. And it turned out it was gold. And I don\u2019t know, to this day I\ncannot understand how they trusted me with this gold. But 1t \u2014 what you had to do is\nyou went on that streetcar, then you had to jump off and get into the ghetto. And\nFebruary 2, 2001\nthen, after all this trouble that I went through, this old antiquarian says, child, you\ntell them \u2014 he gives his back to me and he says, just tell them that I\u2019m too old. Tell\nthem to give it to somebody younger. And I s \u2014 and so I went second time and they\nsaid, make sure that he takes it, and he gets out. But they, of course 1n those days,\nbecause it was very easy to bribe somebody with gold, you know, the guards and all\nthat kind of stuff, it wasn\u2019t that tight yet, 1t was just the first \u2014 they weren\u2019t very well\norganized yet, but \u2014 so I went a couple more times to deliver it to somebody else, but\n\u2014 and I learned to jump off the streetcars so well that when I started going to school\nin Frankfurt in Germany, instead of getting out on a station behind the university,\non the \u2014 when the tram went around I would jump off and a policeman caught me\nand [indecipherable]. And he says, my God, aren\u2019t you afraid you\u2019re gonna break\nyour leg or something? I said, oh no, I\u2019ve got a good preparation for it.",

I mean, you know, we used to go\nin the country to do the black market, and there are usually some children to buy the\nstuff, so those children were \u2014 children could be \u2014 I mean, who would suspect\nchildren having a big chunk of bacon around, or something like that? And there were\nthese handsome, beautiful boys with blue eyes and with this star. And I said, what\nFebruary 2, 2001\nthe \u2014 why do you have to wear this thing? All you have to do is take off your\npaysy(ph) and \u2014 and \u2014 and nobody will know who you are. And they say oh, we\ncannot, because that\u2019s \u2014 the rabbi said we cannot do it. And from that time on I never\nhave any \u2014 how shall I say? Not confidence, but you know, I \u2014 dying for a religion is\none thing, okay, but young people, young men who \u2014 oh, there were some\n[indecipherable] I mean, there\u2019s no question about that, but the very religious ones,\nunder the pressure of their parents, they would never do it. But still, there were some\nwho did it, and \u2014 and run away, and \u2014 this \u2014 that was difficult for boys, for girls it\nwas nothing.",

        "A: I mean.",
        "Q: How did you know that the ghetto was being established in \u2014 we\u2019re talking about\nthe ghetto in Krakow.",
        "A: Ah yeah, because in the first place there was this big thing that no \u2014 no Pole can\nget into the ghetto, there\u2019s gonna be a \u2014",
        "Q: Big sign, you mean?",
        "A: Big sign, that\u2019s it, there\u2019s gonna be a ghetto and that no Jew can live outside of it,\nand every Jew who lives on the outside has to come in. And of course in our street\nthere \u2014 there were quite a few of them. And on the corner of my street 1t was this \u2014\noh yeah, that\u2019s how I really know about this, because in the corner of our street, in a\nFebruary 2, 2001\nhouse, there was this janitress, and she took in a Jewish boy. She \u2014 one of the boys\nwho lived in her house, and all the \u2014 some Poles said to her, why do you keep this\nJewish bastard in your house? And she said \u2014 why are you raising this Jewish\nbastard in your house? That\u2019s about the anti-Semitism that I heard. And she said, I\nam not raising a bastard, I am raising my future son-in-law. And 1s \u2014 and then she\nsays, if you say anything about it, I know about every one of you something, that if\nyou betray me, I do the same, I pay you back. So that nobody did. Now I really don\u2019t\nknow what happened, but somebody said they did get married. But \u2014 but anyhow, I\nremember like today, you know, somebody was saying something, do you know that\nshe keeps the Jewish child? And to me that was nothing, I mean, there were Jewish\nchildren all over. And \u2014 but she called bastard, and I say, that\u2019s a not nice word to\nsay. And she said, now remember how I said, that\u2019s not a bast \u2014 Jewish bastard,\nthat\u2019s my future son-in-law. So \u2014",

The only \u2014 the only poor \u2014 well, I really didn\u2019t see, because even the one \u2014\nmy friends, they were all shop owners, so they had very comfortable houses, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did you say goodbye to any of them?",
        "A: No. Because what happened is that I moved from Dembiniki(ph) to this other\npart of the city and by the time I went to Dembiniki(ph) again, they were already\ngone. So I couldn\u2019t. And one of them, the Cohen girl, they ar \u2014 they \u2014 just the day\nbefore the war broke out, she le \u2014 they left for America. And I was \u2014 and when she\nsays, we\u2019re going to America, and I said, what for? And I had absolutely no idea,\nyou know, I mean, I know that my uncle said Hitler was a tyrant and all that kind of\nstuff and it\u2019s bad luck for Poland, but I had no idea what they going to be doing.\nThen of course, with this lady is in Auschwitz and all this, but I had no \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, mm-hm, and he was a \u2014 yeah, he was a prisoner of war and then he was\nreleased and came home and was kind of half broken. My mother was always a bad\nfeeling about 1t because Polish army was in dira \u2014 array, and so he \u2014 all of a sudden,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI think must have been September two or three, she says, what are you doing here?\nAnd he says, well, I can\u2019t find my company. And the next neighbor was a young\nwoman whose hu-husband was a waiter, and she said, oh, this old man is coming\nhome and my poor husband has been taken prisoner. And so my m \u2014 or something\nlike that. And so my mother says, go back and look for your company. And so he\ngets on this bicycle and he bicycled off to the front and got taken prisoners. So I\nthink he felt guilty all the time, you know. She looked for him and she found him in\nsome POW camp and make eye \u2014 made eyes at the German guards to let her drop\nstuff for him after \u2014 first they looked what\u2019s there, so there\u2019ll be no weapons,\nanything like that. And then she cried, but she says why, he got this big package, it\nwas like a bag, he distributed all the bread and the stuff, he gave them to the other\nprisoners. And she says, and I worked the whole month to get this for him. But I \u2014 I\nsaid I couldn\u2019t im \u2014 really imagine that he would just eat 1t by himself while the\nothers were hungry.",
        "Q: Was your father in the army?",
        "A: Yeah, he was in \u2014 intern \u2014 he went to Hungary where the Polish army was\ndestroy, he went with the other ones through Hungary and then from Hungary to\nFrance, because at that time France was \u2014 and then when France fell, they were\nvery lucky to have a general, a commanding general, Prugar-Ketling, a very nice\nFebruary 2, 2001\nPolish name, who led them from southern France to Switzerland and they laid their\narms at the Swiss border, and they were all interned for the duration of the war.",
        "Q: What \u2014 let\u2019s get back to the ghetto. What did it look like when you went inside?\nCan you describe it at all, some of the sights you saw?",
        "A: Well, at that time I didn\u2019t see anything, I was so \u2014 I - really, I didn\u2019t think much.\nI do \u2014 I don\u2019t remember much, okay, because I was just looking for this certain\nhouse to meet this certain person. I noticed that it was cramped. That\u2019s the\nimpression that I have that \u2014 that here was a guy who owned this \u2014 this beautiful\nbookstore and all of a sudden he has this one room with three or four other people.",
        "Q: How did you get into the ghetto? What did you say to the guard?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t do anything, I jump off the streetcar, and in the ghetto.",
        "Q: Oh, the streetcar went into the ghetto.",
        "A: Into the ghetto. And if you\u2019re at a certain point you can jump off and you were in\nthe ghetto. And bi \u2014 children \u2014 I mean, I was very small, I really was, at 14 years old,\n15.",
        "Q: But ordinarily you could \u2014 I mean, if you hadn\u2019t jumped off, it wouldn\u2019t have\nstopped \u2014",
        "A: You would have to go through a \u2014 yeah, yeah, I would have to go through a gate.\nBut I didn\u2019t have to go through a gate because I jumped off, so that I \u2014 there were \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t see any guards. So the same way all the other boys who went outside or inside\nFebruary 2, 2001\ngot in the streetcar or \u2014 and of course the Polish streetcar drivers knew that we were\ndoing this, so they even slowed down a little bit.",
        "Q: So you went in several times to the ghetto?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did you see any changes from one visit to the next?",
        "A: Just this \u2014 I was kind of scared a little bit, okay, to begin with. And then I went to\ndifferent houses, but except for \u2014 1t was not al \u2014 enou \u2014 enough time for them to get\nso hungry that you could spot it. All you did \u2014 all I saw was overcrowding. That \u2014\nand that people just like \u2014",
        "Q: Did other people try to give you messages?",
        "A: Oh yeah, but I \u2014 I \u2014 I would just \u2014 then they are \u2014 would deliver them on the other\nside, to the \u2014",
        "Q: You did take the me \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 same person.",
        "Q: Besides the message from the bookseller, did you ever take other messages?",
        "A: Oh yeah, but not \u2014 I never knew any names or who and all that. Ther-There was\njust one point that they all would \u2014 you know, that gentleman, I don\u2019t even know\nwhat he look like any more, it was an elderly gentleman. And I don\u2019t know what you\nlook like, but anyhow, bi \u2014 h-he \u2014 I would give it to him and he would distribute it.\nBut he never was on a col \u2014 0-on the envelope, the names and to whom it was, it was\nFebruary 2, 2001\nalways on the inside. So \u2014 and they all had kind of funny names too, because one\ntime I looked in one of those things, and the names were like \u2014",
        "Q: False names, you mean?",
        "A: False name, Roosevelt, and \u2014 in Polish, you know, and all kinds of false\n[indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff.",
        "Q: So now you were in school?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And then what was the next change?",
        "A: Well, the next change was that they closed the school, they \u2014 because they\ndiscovered that we were going underground. And some \u2014 well, th-the \u2014 all there was\n[indecipherable] map of Poland or anything like that on the books or notebooks.\nAnd so lots of people didn\u2019t see any use of tearing off the maps, cause all Polish\nbooks \u2014 notebooks rather, had this po \u2014 map of Poland and then something on one\nside wi \u2014 and some historical dates on the others that the kids could rem \u2014 that was\nthe way of teaching, too. And they did say that it was forbidden. And I don\u2019t know,\none time came this German inspection and they found some kid with a \u2014 with this\nmaps and they said that\u2019s it. So they closed this school. And then \u2014 but then the\nparents went again, you know, and after we finished this kindergarten thing, the\nparents were thinking, what else can we do? And then the Germans needed people\nwho spoke German to help them govern this new kingdom of theirs. And they\nFebruary 2, 2001\nneeded people to \u2014 to do their commercial things. So they opened this school, wi \u2014 it\nwas called the preparatory school for \u2014 preparatory commercial school from higher\npreparatory school commerci \u2014 oh, it gos \u2014 anyhow, the name was so long that it\nhardly got on the thing. But then that \u2014 we didn't finish that \u2014 yeah, so we did finish\nthat, but before we finished this, came Germans into the school and pulled some of\nus out, because they were looking for children who were talented for languages. Is\nthere any \u2014 and they did that all over Krakow in many schools, so that who \u2014\nbecause they needed this workforce and they needed somebody who knew Polish\nand German. And so they send me to a three [indecipherable] in the German school.\nIt was like \u2014 like three months long, where we learn German and typewriting, typing\nand shorthand. So that\u2019s the next schooling I got.",
        "Q: And then you stayed there how long?",
        "A: Law \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long, was three months and I just got this paper, 1t was\nkind of orange thing and it said in work, and that\u2019s when I was called, maybe the\nnext day.",
        "Q: To do what?",
        "A: To be s \u2014 go to a transit camp and then go to a\u2014 to Germany.",
        "Q: Oh, okay, so you finished this course.",
        "A: Course.",
        "Q: Of three months.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: And I was to be working \u2014 oh yeah, and I was to be working in a agricultural\nbank.",
        "Q: In Krakow?",
        "A: In Krakow. But this \u2014 the Gestapo needed workers, and since I was one of the\nbest students, they switched it and send me to this Gestapo school. Not Gestapo\nschool but with this \u2014 to type for this guy, for this Gestapo man.",
        "Q: This 1s still in Krakow?",
        "A: This is still in Krakow. But when I was in this German school, the man, the\nteacher was one of those ger \u2014 Germans who would \u2014 cou \u2014 would do away with all\nforeign words in German and just put all the Germanic words. So that when we were\ntalking about comma, we called them bystreek(ph). And when I went to take\ndictation for this Gestapo man, e-every time that he said comma, cause he was an old\nAustrian, every time he \u2014 he used the word comma, but it is written with a K in\nGerman, I wrote komma. So then I typed it out and I gave it to him, you see? You\ncan just imagine what this piece looked like. And so he \u2014 he looks at it and he says\nder Polisher(ph) schweine. And I just learned the word ferkel, which means also a\nsw \u2014 literally a swine in German. And I say u-un(ph) du bist in Pr-Preussischer\nferkel ond(ph). You are a Prussian pig. And then \u2014",
        "Q: You said that to him?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah, and I [indecipherable] idea, you know, what I was doing really, I just was\noffended that he called me a Polisher(ph) swine. And \u2014 and I run out, and he got up\nand he run after me. But before that, we used to, before we had this Jewish lady\nduring the war, we had a Ukrainian law student living with us. And I met her right\nwhen the war broke out and Poland lost and she says, now listen, you were so nice\nto me, so whenever you\u2019re in trouble, you come to see me, because I will \u2014 I\u2019m a big\nfish now at the German labor office in Krakow. So if you need any help \u2014 so when I\nrun out, I remember this girl and I runned \u2014 and I run to the \u2014 to \u2014 to the arbeitsamt\nand I told \u2014 told her what happened. I didn\u2019t tell her how I called him, but I said I got\nin trouble with him. And she says, don\u2019t go home, go to one of your friends. Can you\nthink of a friend when I can contact you? And I said \u2014I give her a name of a girl.\nUnfortunately, this girl lived by the railroad station, the street \u2014 you want to stop?\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nFebruary 2, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kristina Belfoure, and this is tape number two,\nside A, and you were talking about how you went to your friend, the Ukrainian law\nstudent who was going to help you out.",
        "A: And so I w \u2014 and she said, now don\u2019t go, and she s \u2014 so I went to this\n[indecipherable] street, which 1s right by the railroad station, that\u2019s the transit route\nto the \u2014 every Polish village and town had to deliver a certain amount of people for\nwork to Germany. And so there was columns of slave work \u2014 future slave workers\ngoing by that street, and they always counted them before they entered the railroad\nstation, and if there were some missing, they would close off one of the streets and\ncaught anybody \u2014 catch anybody who didn\u2019t have a papers. And I don\u2019t know how I\ndidn\u2019t have that little paper with me.",
        "Q: Y-You had papers, but you just didn\u2019t have them that day?",
        "A: That day, yeah. And \u2014 and you could not be on the street without a working\npaper. I mean, 1-if you were, that\u2019s \u2014 and you got caught, that\u2019s it, cause they were\nafter getting as many people as possible for work to Germany, because they needed\nlabor. And so this Nina went to my parents and my parents said she didn\u2019t come\nhome, she went to this girl. And she said, no, she never got here. So she \u2014 because\nshe knew the \u2014 how this all works, and she went to the transit camp. And I saw her\nFebruary 2, 2001\nand she fixed so up that I would go to a tobacco factory in Germany, that was easy\nwork. And that\u2019s how I got to this factory in Germany called Hanewacker, which\nwas making chewing tobacco.",
        "Q: So we were talking about early 1942?",
        "A: Uh-huh, January [indecipherable]",
        "Q: January 1942.",
        "A: I don\u2019t re \u2014 quite remember what \u2014 whether it was January or February, but it was",
        "Q: And you were 17 and a half?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: An-And what was your reaction when they told you you couldn\u2019t \u2014 they were\ngoing to take you away? You couldn\u2019t even go home.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go home, and \u2014 and I didn\u2019t \u2014 no, I didn\u2019t go home, because I was\ncaught while I was going to my girlfriend\u2019s and that nobody really knew what\nhappened to me except for this woman, this lawyer who knew where I could\npossibly be, if I got caught.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: And so she just was so wonderful that she gave me this easy job. Or she could\nhave just let me \u2014",
        "Q: Could you communicate with your \u2014 with your family?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: No, no, not \u2014 I \u2014 they got a note from me when \u2014 when I was really in \u2014 in\nHanewacker in Germany.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what was your emotional state at that point? Were you very frightened?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I was frightened, but in a way it was an adventure and I knew German.\nSo I knew I\u2019m gonna get through with this. I mean, I\u2019m gonna get my\n[indecipherable] out somehow, okay.",
        "Q: You were leaving Poland to go to Germany \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 did \u2014 but what did Poland \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, and another thing that happened to me was in that transit camp they\nwere cutting everybody\u2019s hair off, and I had pigtails. And I don\u2019t know why they\ndidn\u2019t cut my off. This lady \u2014 but I heard of something whisper, you know, and the \u2014\nmaybe she just took pity on me, and she didn\u2019t shore my head.",
        "Q: Did you look old?",
        "A: No, I was like a child, I looked like a child, okay, so maybe that\u2019s why \u2014 I think\nthat\u2019s maybe why they took pity on me, I imagine.",
        "Q: But what were your thoughts about having to leave Poland? I mean, you felt very\nproud of being a Pole.",
        "A: Of course I felt proud and I was scared, I mean yeah, cause I didn\u2019t know what I\nwas going. But on the other hand, this \u2014 this lady said \u2014 oh, oh yeah, I'll tell you why\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI wasn\u2019t scared, because after Poland and Germany had this pact of non-aggression,\nPolish textbooks in school didn\u2019t picture Germany as a horrible place. When you\nopen a \u2014 and my cousin studied German, okay, so they had those \u2014 those books and\nyou had just beautiful palaces and \u2014 and sights and all this. I mean, they \u2014 for some\nreason they did not \u2014 they changed a \u2014 they changed the way of teaching, and they\nwere not stressing the horrible ta \u2014 thing that it \u2014 Prussians did to Poland before. All\nthey was talking was beautiful Alps, beautiful Bavaria, beautiful Rhine river. And\nyou can see this Rhine river and the castles around it and this whole\n[indecipherable]. And so I really \u2014 how shall I say? I say, well finally I\u2019m gonna see\nthose things. Was ka \u2014 I had no idea that I\u2019Il never get out of a camp, but I mean, it\nwas a Slave labor camp and you \u2014 well, there was no way of [indecipherable] if we\nwere \u2014 but that\u2019s early on. But anyhow, I was \u2014 you know, I went away, it was like\nadventure. I didn\u2019t expect what was coming and god \u2014 thanks God, you know. I had\nno idea.",
        "Q: Did you know anybody else in the group that you were in at this transit camp?",
        "A: No, nobody.",
        "Q: So you were totally alone in it?",
        "A: I was to-totally alone, but then immediately the first thing they did 1s, did this\ndelousing, and you going with this hot bath, it almost burned you and all this kind of\nstuff, and already there you started looking for somebody you may like, to talk and\nFebruary 2, 2001\nsay what\u2019s going to happen to us, and this and that. Then somebody said, well\nnothing\u2019s going to happen, we\u2019re gonna go to work to Germany. And then \u2014",
        "Q: Now this transit camp is in Krakow?",
        "A: Krakow.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And whenever you\u2019re in a situation like that you always look for somebody that\nyou can hook up to \u2014 to \u2014 to have some kind of support or something, you know, and\nSO \u2014",
        "Q: And the \u2014 the people were all Polish Christians, no Jews.",
        "A: Yeah, no Jews. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know who they were, but then anyhow, I bet you they\nhad a selection later on. But \u2014 but I wa \u2014 didn\u2019t witness it. And then the girls \u2014",
        "Q: Where \u2014 where was the transit clamp located, do you know\u201d?",
        "A: Gee, I have no idea where it was.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s too far back \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 to \u2014 to remember.",
        "Q: And so then what happened?",
        "A: Nothing. I was all of a sudden \u2014 first we were in the regular trains. No, I don\u2019t\nknow. No, first we were in a kind of cattle trains and then they changed to regular\nFebruary 2, 2001\ntrains the minute we left Germany \u2014 Poland, and I was so disappointed with this\nGermany, you know, it was \u2014 1s dirty and the snow is dark and all this kind of stuff,\nyou know. I always think about those books with this beautiful sight, and here 1s this\n\u2014I mean, because I was to Silesia, you see, so which that\u2019s all industrial region, you\ndon\u2019t see a village or anything like that. And I said, wow. So, and finally we get to\nthis Hanewacker and to this station, and they started being very nice to us. Tow \u2014\ntoward civilians, whenever there were German civilians present, they changed their\nattitude, too, cause they didn\u2019t want the \u2014 I \u2014 I imagine they didn't want the civilians\nto know what they were really doing with people. And especially \u2014 probably too\nbecause we were all very young, and oh \u2014",
        "Q: Was this men and women?",
        "A: No, just women. And \u2014 really young girls. And it was night, and we got off,\ncarried all our bundles, and they didn\u2019t say raus like they usually said, you sh \u2014 they\nsaid ausweichen, which means, you know, get out, but not in a very \u2014 1n a nasty\nway. And we just walk and walk and walk and then we arrive at this factory. Oh\nyeah, and then we \u2014 they let us in and it was lights, it was like oh, thanks God, cause\nwe were already hungry and thirsty. And we went to this room tha \u2014 it was like a\ncafeteria or a dining room or something like that. And that\u2019s when I knew about\nwhat\u2019s happening to the Jews, because when I got there \u2014 when we got there, there\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwas a group of girls with yellow covers on their head, what do you call those thing?\nIf you have to wear it, like \u2014",
        "Q: Kerchief?",
        "A: No, not a kerchief.",
        "Q: A bandana.",
        "A: Not a bandana, like a doctor\u2019s wear, what do they wear?",
        "Q: Oh, a\u2014a cap, a se \u2014",
        "A: Cap, something like that, and they had yellow caps. White smocks and yellow\ncaps. And you know, I was inquisitive, so I wanted to s \u2014 they were like giving up\ntheir dishes, getting ready to go, as they went by this thing and some of them \u2014 every\none of them that I watch were putting away the dishes. And I wanted to go to them\ncause I wanted to find out well, what is this place like? And the guard says no, no,\nverboten, those are Jews. And I \u2014 when d \u2014 he said Jews, Jewish girls, I said well,\nthat\u2019s good, then I can\u2019t \u2014 and so I went to them, I mean when he turned around, and\nI started talking Polish. [indecipherable] And they \u2014",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t answer?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t answer, and finally they called somebody, here comes this lady and\nsays in Polish \u2014 she also has this yellow thing on her head. And she says, what do\nyou want from them? And I say, how come they don\u2019t speak any Polish if they\u2019re\nJews? And she says, because they are Jewish girls from Vienna and they don\u2019t know\nFebruary 2, 2001\nany Polish. That was an eye opener. [indecipherable] was right there, there are other\nJews that are not Polish. And sa \u2014 and I am \u2014 I say, oh \u2014 she says \u2014 I say, what\u2019s with\nthe \u2014 what are they so afraid of? Because you came and you\u2019re gonna be replacing\nthem and they\u2019re going to Poland. And I said, well they would love it here, I mean\nPoland. There\u2019s so many Jews in Poland. My hometown every fifth person is a Jew.\nAnd she looks at me, you know, like that, and says child, child, they\u2019re not going \u2014\nthey\u2019re going probably to die there. I just couldn\u2019t believe it, you know, I said why?\nPeople who follow every blessed God\u2019s commandment and there\u2019s a hundreds of\nthem. How? I mean, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. But I met her couple of days after,\nbecause they were the ones who were dishing out the food, you know. So I say, have\nyou heard from your friends? And she said no, they were someplace in Poland, so\nthey probably died. But that was the first time that I knew of the fate of the Polish\nJews \u2014 not Polish Jews, but I mean Jews. And I got a history lesson th-that isn\u2019t such\na n-not all Poles of Mosaic faith don\u2019t speak Polish. And so that was an eye opener,\nreally an eye opener. Cause you have to imagine, I was inquisitive and I say\n[indecipherable]. And \u2014 but they looked at us, because we\u2019re skinny an-and they\nwere going out. And they knew that the minute we come, they\u2019Il be gone. And here I\ntelling about all this, how they love Jews in Poland and how they\u2019re gonna love it,\nthat every fifth person is a Jew. I mean \u2014 I mean, I have ta \u2014 absolutely no idea. I\ndon\u2019t know whether I was dumb or naive, or \u2014 or \u2014 or I just lived in another world or\nFebruary 2, 2001\ns \u2014 what. But it \u2014 it was an eye opener. And the first shocking news about the\ndestruction of Jewry. That was the first time that I really \u2014 and this lady whenever\nshe saw me, cause she was like a leader of those gir \u2014 Viennese girls, you know, she\njust always look at me like that, you know, and what could I tell her?",
        "Q: Sh-She was a Jewish woman?",
        "A: Oh yeah, she was a Jewish woman.",
        "Q: But she stayed.",
        "A: Well, th \u2014 she left too, later, but not too long after that. After the last girls left, she\nleft too. She gave me a lesson. She really opened my \u2014 you know, when you\u2019re\nyoung and you\u2019re sheltered by parents, they \u2014 you don\u2019t really realize what\u2019s going\non because you have th \u2014 all those childish things in your mind and boyfriends and\nthis and that and books, and you don\u2019t really take part in what\u2019s going on. And that\nwas the first lesson that I got. And then of course in that factory there are \u2014 the\nsecond time that I really at \u2014 felt guilty. First time I felt guilty that I didn\u2019t do\nsomething for this Eva Kriseberg(ph), because my uncle could have pulled her out.\nAnd I didn\u2019t get in touch with her and I don\u2019t know just why I didn\u2019t get in touch\nwith her, just because she scare me, she says, go away, go away. And th \u2014 and she\nsays, we don\u2019t live in our \u2014 I say where are your parents, where do you live? She\nsays, we don\u2019t live in this pla \u2014 in our place any more. We lived in this compound.\nAnd so I felt so guilty then, in this Hanewacker comes this big mass \u2014 big\nFebruary 2, 2001\nsupervisor and couple Gestapo men, and come to this girl. And he calls her\nsomething like Miss Ringelbaum(ph) or something like that. And she says, oh, I\u2019m\nnot Ringelbaum(ph), I\u2019m Kratkauska(ph), and he says yeah, we know who you\nare. And they took her. Because there were \u2014 you know, it\u2019s easy for a Jewish girl\nthat looks \u2014 doesn\u2019t look \u2014 I just \u2014 I really don\u2019t know what that means to look\nJewish, to tell you the truth. It always baffled me, how you can tell, you know. But\nbecause I lived together, I just didn\u2019t see any difference. And they have taken her\nand I felt so helpless. Just the day that I saw Eva going with this broom through the\nsnow, I mean, this was \u2014 just nothing you can do, cause there\u2019s always some soldiers\nbehind you.",
        "Q: This was a Jewish girl who was passing as a Polish girl?",
        "A: Is a Jewish girl passing as a Polish girl, yeah. And somebody must have betray\nher or denounced her. And then somebody said, she\u2019s not the only one. So we knew\nthere were other ones, but then \u2014 see, the idea was to act Catholic, say all the crosses\nand all this kind of stuff and \u2014 and say Jesus, Mary all the time. I mean, there was a\nway of \u2014 there was a way of keeping \u2014 passing, but then sometimes \u2014 but if you\ncame from a Hasidic home, you couldn\u2019t. There was no way. Cause first you got this\nidea to betraying your religion, betraying your parents, your grandparents. But \u2014 so\nthat\u2019s a shi \u2014 there was no way for a Hasidic girl to get safe. But there were those\nwho were hiding and there were \u2014 but that \u2014 that was one of the ways, you could\nFebruary 2, 2001\nalways pray and say prayers and Jesus, Mary and all this, and \u2014 what you felt in\nyour heart was a different story. And then I ask one girl, I say, y-you don\u2019t have \u2014 do\nyou s \u2014 sometimes think that you\u2019re doing the wrong thing? And she says no, we all\npray to the same God. And the same thing was, when I first started teaching this\nJewish lady, pau \u2014 saying the prayers, some \u2014 some \u2014 I went to the priest and I say \u2014\nbecause I thought I was doing bad thing converting this Jewish lady, teaching her\nPolish prayers, Catholic prayers. And so I went to this priest and I said \u2014 I took \u2014 you\ncan go to confession and you know, and all that, and he says, well, confess your sins.\nAnd I said, well, I have this woman big \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sin or not, and I\nwas telling him that, you know, I was teaching this Catholic prayers to a woman who\nwas Jewish, and was this a sin. And he says oh no, no, no, you\u2019Il be saving her life,\nno. So he give me a blessing and told me to say three Holy Mary\u2019s and that thing\nwas over. So I thought that meant, because then I really knew that when she says we\nall believe in one God, so who \u2014 who \u2014 what does it matter. But \u2014",
        "Q: You felt safe telling the priest that you were hiding a Jewish woman?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t telling him hiding, I was telling him I was teaching her. But I was\nteaching her Catholic prayers, then he says [indecipherable] were you successful?\nAnd I said, not very, cause the lady\u2019s deaf. And he was the one who said, well get\nsome girlfra \u2014 don\u2019t you have any other friends who could teach her?",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re in this factory, what kind of factory is it?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: It\u2019s a chewing tobacco factory.",
        "Q: And what were your duties?",
        "A: Well, when you chew \u2014 when you make chewing tobacco there\u2019s this \u2014 takes two\npeople, one if \u2014 one that lays, dry strips of tobacco leaves, they kind of small ones.\nAnd then after them goes the fellow who puts \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is, but they put\n\u2014 they cut up the tobacco, put it in some kind of prune juice to make it sweet, and\nthen you go and you \u2014 a-and you put that stuff on top \u2014 no, behind him and he goes\nand he takes a piece of this horrible chewing stuff and puts it on the leaf, and he rolls\nit into it, and it comes like a little sausage, continuous sausage and he just rolls it in.\nHe gets to the end of it and he puts it on some kind of wheel and the thing starts\nanew. And then they put this tobacco sausage into this \u2014 into this syrup and it gets\ncooked, and then \u2014 then they get it out again and they cut it in very tiny pieces, and\nthen, this was supposed to help the war effort, because thi-this tobacco, that you\ndon\u2019t smoke it, you chew it. This 1s like a spitting \u2014 well, one time I saw somebody\nusing it here, too, urch. But anyhow, one thing we learned, that you cannot eat it,\nalthough was s-sweet, because a \u2014 one of us got sick from it. But, so I was doing\nthat, and then one day \u2014",
        "Q: Did you see any other groups of Jews?",
        "A: No, just those, that was \u2014",
        "Q: That was that one group.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: That was that one group and there\u2019re no more Jews \u2014 Jewish girls from any place\ncoming. There was \u2014 they were get \u2014 getting us. And then we also said, we-ell, after\nthey \u2014 after them we\u2019ll go away because they were [indecipherable] girls coming,\nso we thought, oh, they\u2019re gonna do with us the same thing they did with the Jewish\ngirls, but they didn\u2019t. So \u2014 but we were all so scared to death then, cause we thought\nwell, we\u2019re the next ones.",
        "Q: Did you get enough food to eat?",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember, food was never very important to me, but I think \u2014 oh,\nno, no, we didn\u2019t, but there were always the civilian Germans who would sneak food\nfor us. Like, 1f you had this woman, or the man for whom you worked, and\nespecially if you spoke their language, they would always help you. I remember the\nfirst time there was \u2014 I had this man \u2014 boy, who \u2014 hm, I don\u2019t know how we got\ntogether with this boy there. I was working for him, or he \u2014 but anyhow \u2014 or th \u2014 he\nworker for z \u2014 on the other table. But anyhow he says to me one day, look in that \u2014\non that shelf and \u2014 and sometimes we would talk to \u2014 I would talk to this boy and I\nwas telling him how the Germans were horrible in Poland and all this kind of stu \u2014\nand \u2014 and he \u2014 I thought he was gonna \u2014 and I told him how I love books and I can\u2019t\nfind the books. So I thought he gave me a book. And it turned out to be a piece of\ncake from his mother, and he says, that\u2019s from my mother. And then there \u2014 the\nother guys started making fun, that he was in love with me, so the mother, who was a\nFebruary 2, 2001\nspinner took him away and he was helping her and I got some \u2014 and I was helping\nsome other men. But anyhow, sometimes, you know, they would put something for\nyou in the \u2014 or give you something. And later on they ask us to come to their house\nand there was this big \u2014 big sign that says fraternization with the Poles is forbidden,\ndon\u2019t you ever have them at your table and all that. But the way they went around\nthis, that they would say, we need worker in my house, or in my garden. Because\nmost of these people were in a small farm [indecipherable] and all that, so they\nneeded help. And I heard one woman that, I don\u2019t know how I got to talking about\nsmoked fish. And I says oh, I\u2019m dreaming of that smoked fish [indecipherable]\nsmoked fish and scruts(ph) and all that. And he says, you dreaming about that? And\nI say yeah, because I\u2019m hungry. And wa \u2014 he said, you know, when we get the\nsmoked fish on rations, then you \u2014 I \u2014 you come to my house. And I said, didn\u2019t you\nsee this where it says no \u2014 and they said \u2014 and I said, the only way you can get me is\nto say you need a help to work [indecipherable] every house in Germany had this\nsupervisor was a Hitlerjugend \u2014 I mean a Hitler \u2014 a Nazi party woman that watched\nover the houses so nothing happened. So when we heard this woman coming, I\nalways went on the floor, you know, and pretended to be pu \u2014 shi \u2014 shining it or\nscrubbing it, whatever it was, you know. But there were people who almost, you\nknow, I was just pure lucky, we all were pure lucky, and that\u2019s why I wrote this\nbook, because when my father [indecipherable] this conversation, I said no, not all\nFebruary 2, 2001\nGermans were brutal, cruel and all that. It was the system, but there were some good\npeople, ah ba-ba-ba-ba, so that\u2019s why this whole book came about, but \u2014",
        "Q: We-We\u2019ll talk about the book. This factory was in the town of Hanewacker\u2019?",
        "A: No, in the ha \u2014 Hanewacker was the name of the factory and it was the town of\nNordhausen.",
        "Q: Oh, you were already in Nordhausen, okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm, that was in Nordhausen.",
        "Q: I see. And did you live in a barracks?",
        "A: We lived in a barracks and the first \u2014 when we got there \u2014 when I got up in the\nmorning, the first \u2014 cause you had to get \u2014 there were three stories of beds \u2014 I mean,\nthree tiers of beds, I didn't know how to get up on them. Course, everybody got the f\n\u2014 you know, the ground floor. I g \u2014 I \u2014 there must have been a [indecipherable] they\njust pushed me up and said, now finally. But early in the morning, I wanted to\npractice coming down, how to \u2014 not to trample on the girl under me. And I went to\nthe window and it was somebody closing the window. Th-There were \u2014 not the\nwindows, but the \u2014",
        "Q: Shutters?",
        "A: Shutters. And the guy kind of, you know, beckoned me to look out. And he says\nto me, look \u2014 look at the world before I lock you up. And \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know\nwhether I should say I understand what he is saying or not, because at that time I\nFebruary 2, 2001\ndidn\u2019t know whether it was good to say you know it, or it\u2019s better to be quiet so you\nknow what they gonna do with him. And so I said \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: \u2014 you know, like that. Turn out that this man was the supervisor of the barracks,\nkind of physical supervisor, you know. And so we all \u2014 he was so good we all called\nhim Opa, which means grandfather in German. And so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how it was and\nthen you had to get up, I don\u2019t know how \u2014 what time in the morning and\n[indecipherable] for this breakfast. Oh yeah, and there were no toilets, toilets were\nalso in the barrack, a separate barrack. And were not \u2014 not toilets, was just a hole in\na \u2014 you know, kind of a hole in the ground and \u2014 but \u2014 and the toilet paper were\npieces of little newspaper, I read that a little bit, at least it was something.",
        "Q: What about clothes, did they give you clothes?",
        "A: No, we were \u2014 oh yeah, you \u2014 no, we had our own cl \u2014 and thanks God I had my\nwinter coat, which was woolen, and \u2014 but they gave us smocks, so that you \u2014\nwhatever you were \u2014 you always wore a white smock and a little thi \u2014",
        "Q: And your own shoes?",
        "A: Yeah, own, yeah. Although they did still \u2014 although I think they gave us a pair of\nthose wooden \u2014",
        "Q: Clogs?",
        "A: Clogs, yeah.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: Were you menstruating then?",
        "A: I think I was, yeah.",
        "Q: Did they ha \u2014 provide you with any supplies?",
        "A: No, no. We just use anything we could. But \u2014 or maybe they \u2014 no, they didn\u2019t. I\ndon\u2019t think they did.",
        "Q: And so \u2014",
        "A: We used toilet paper and all kind of stuff.",
        "Q: And how long were you in the chewing tobacco factory?",
        "A: Janu \u2014 February \u2014 hm, I think 1t was May, because that\u2019s where we got kicked out\nbecause in the [indecipherable] factory, we were together with the British POWs.",
        "Q: They were working in the factory also?",
        "A: Yeah, also. And they were the wounded at Dunkirk, so they couldn\u2019t do any \u2014\nthey were not supposed to be working anyhow, but they were working doing easy\nwork. And of course we were flirting with them and passing letters and all that.",
        "Q: Did you understand any English?",
        "A: No. And \u2014 no. And \u2014",
        "Q: By the way, did you have any connection with your family, I mean letters?",
        "A: Yeah, letters, there were letters and then later on when I \u2014 later on when I \u2014 well,\nwhen I worked for this private ana \u2014 f-firm, I used to send the letters through this\nFebruary 2, 2001\nlady. She would send my letters to Poland and I would receive the letters to her\nhouse.",
        "Q: So you have this correspondence?",
        "A: Yes, I have the correspondence. But anyhow \u2014",
        "Q: You were talking about the British POWs.",
        "A: POWs, and then we always \u2014 we had to wear this P on our things and we always\n\u2014 once \u2014 if we behave we would be given a Sunday off. I don\u2019t know how many, one\nSunday a month or something like that.",
        "Q: What di-di \u2014 what did your P look like?",
        "A: Well, it was a yellow background with a purple P on it, and you had to wear it\nlike on your heart, and all that kind of stuff. But of course you can always cover it up\nwith a scarf. So when we went out, we always covered that with a scarf or we ripped\nit off.",
        "Q: It was sewn on?",
        "A: Yeah, it was supposed to be sewn on.",
        "Q: How did you feel having to wear that?",
        "A: Awful, I mean I \u2014",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Why? Because I [indecipherable] you feel like you\u2019re subhuman or something,\nwas the time to humiliate you, just like there was the Star of David, that\u2019s just\nFebruary 2, 2001\nexactly the same thing. And \u2014 but with at \u2014 with it you couldn\u2019t go anyplace, and we\njust found out that \u2014 oh yeah, and of course this \u2014 this man whom we call Opa, next\n\u2014 across the street from that camp, those barracks, there was a \u2014 not a restaurant, but\nkind of joint and he said, will you be coming by? Bring me a beer. And so we would\ngo and bring him a beer and we always \u2014 and he would never look at our passes,\nwhether they \u2014 cause you had to have a pass. Sometimes we had a pass that was\nalready a month old, you know. But he never \u2014 but he told us to watch out for other\nguys, if there\u2019s somebody else, to be very careful and all that. Well, anyhow, we\ntrespassed the law of the camp many a many times and finally we got kicked out of\nthis ammu-ammunition factory, Schmidt and Kranz, with \u2014 which was really\nworking for the metal -- metalwerker(ph) which was making those V-Is and V-2s\nlater on.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kristina Belfoure. This is tape number two, side\nB. And you were saying that you were going to have to move out of Hanewacker\nbecause \u2014 what kind of things did you do wrong that made you have to move?",
        "A: Well, in the first place we were going out without a \u2014 a \u2014 without this P, without\nthe \u2014 you know, the sign that we are Poles. And then we were flirting with the\nFebruary 2, 2001\nBritish prisoners and sending and receiving letters and then there were some German\nwomen who were corresponding with the [indecipherable] so we \u2014 oh, we did them\nfavors too, and all this and well, anyhow \u2014",
        "Q: Did you realize how dangerous that was?",
        "A: No, I have absolutely no idea how dangerous. The first time that I was \u2014 this is \u2014\nwe were four people, four girls, and one of them says, what would I do to be in a real\nrestaurant? And so we said, why not? We could, since we have a Sunday off we\ncould get dressed. But we really didn\u2019t have good shoes and all that. But since we\nknew the German women who are flirting with the British, we could \u2014 we thought\nwe ca\u2014 we could possibly ask them to help us, you know? And so I said, can you\nborrow \u2014 can I borrow a pair of shoes of \u2014 from you? And she said, what for? And I\nsaid, well, Janka has this idea \u2014 or Hedwig was her na \u2014 real name, Hedwig has this\nidea that she would love to go to a good German restaurant and we saw, on our way\nto church we saw this restaurant. And she says no, you could never go there because\nthat\u2019s all this Nazi cra \u2014 cream goes to that restaurant, they would immediately\nrecognize a s-stranger. If you really want to go, you can go to some kind of a little\ncaf\u00e9 or a konditori(ph) which 1s this \u2014 he serves coffee and also serves cakes. And\nyou could go to something like that. There, nobody will notice it \u2014 notice you. So \u2014\nbut, I mean, there\u2019s no way for you to be successful going to a fine restaurant, but\nthis girl is just dreaming of going to a fine restaurant after all these crummy meals\nFebruary 2, 2001\nand barracks and all this. And so \u2014 and then one time \u2014 what we didn\u2019t know is that\nNordhausen was this forbidden place where they were making those \u2014 before they\nstarted making V-1s, V-2s, there were underground galleries where they making\nbombers and practicing inventions or, I mean, trying out stuff.",
        "Q: But you were not aware of that?",
        "A: No, I was not aware. So those two girls got a bicycle. Now, there was this bice \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how this happened, but those two girls, since the Germans were so\nhelpful, you know, th-this \u2014 oh no, this \u2014 some \u2014 this \u2014 one of the girls says, I would\nso love to get on a bicycle, and she says, oh you can take mine, the German woman\nsaid. And then \u2014 then the other one got a bicycle from somebody else and took off\nthe [indecipherable] and went. Except that they hadn\u2019t been on a bicycle for so long\nthat they were going like this, wa \u2014 left, right, left, right, and then the other girl was\nscared to fall off, so she was just pushing the bicycle. And the policeman saw her\ndoing it, and \u2014 and he wanted to help her. And then, while he was helping her, he\nsays, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this bicycle, but while she was getting up, she\nbrushed on her \u2014 he brushed on her coat and well, they both end up in jail, and they\nsaid \u2014",
        "Q: He saw the P, you mean?",
        "A: He saw the P, okay. And there\u2019s the one time we got this idea of going out on the\nrailroad by a train, you know, just to see what it looks like outside of the barracks.\nFebruary 2, 2001\nAnd we asked this \u2014 a-again we made this mistake of asking a ticket to this place\nwhere the factory was, because we had no idea where it was. And \u2014 and I remember\nsaying two tickets \u2014 or sa \u2014 no, a round trip ticket. And the guy says \u2014 and there was\nthis [indecipherable] anyhow, they were \u2014 but, this factory didn\u2019t want to lose me\nbecause I was this interpreter, you know, so I \u2014",
        "Q: So \u2014so he saw the P and he did not sell you the ticket?",
        "A: No, they said, of course not. The woman who was selling me the ticket says, I\u2019m\nsorry, I didn\u2019t know they were Poles, they had tickets \u2014 I mean, they had Ps. I mean,\nthey looked so normal, we didn\u2019t think they were Poles, you know. But anyhow, so\nthat was on our \u2014 and so this grandpa s \u2014 was saying, watch out, this is the last time\nthat I can intervene for you. Because with the bicycle what happened, so she didn\u2019t\ncome in, she says, where is she? And I said, well, I don\u2019t know, she hasn\u2019t come in\nyet. So she called the police and she says, you wouldn\u2019t see a\u2014 you haven\u2019t seen a\nPolish girl with a yellow \u2014 a yel \u2014 a red \u2014 Polish redhead on a bicycle? She must me\n\u2014 mus \u2014 could have had an accident or some, was there \u2014 oh no, there was a Polish\nredhead on a accident or something. He says no, she\u2019s not 1n accident, she\u2019s in jail.\nAnd so, but then she came the next morning. But \u2014 and \u2014 but she swore that she just\ntook the bicycle, that she stole the bicycle. No, no, nots what she said, sh-she saw\nthis bicycle in the \u2014 outside the barracks and it was a broken bicycle and she fixed it.\nThat\u2019s what she lie. And the German woman was kissing her all over that she didn\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbetray her that she give her the bicycle, but \u2014 but anyhow, so then th \u2014 we already\nhad all this on our index, and they said that\u2019s it. And so that\u2019s how they push this in\nthe \u2014 send us to work. We really know that we are in a camp, and that was the nation",
        "Q: So you were in Nordhausen for a few months \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and then you were sent \u2014",
        "A: I mean, it \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 I mean, you were in Hanewacker for a few months.",
        "A: Few months, and then I went to this \u2014 we were sent to this mashee \u2014 machine\nammunition factory called Schmidt and Kranz \u2014",
        "Q: Also in Nordhausen.",
        "A: \u2014 in it \u2014 Nordhausen, and we \u2014 the factory was in town and the camp was on the\noutskirts and we had to walk every day. But at that \u2014 in the same camp where \u2014",
        "Q: Now, we\u2019re talking about summer \u00b042?",
        "A: Yeah, because that was May. Yeah, yeah, something like that.",
        "Q: May, June, July",
        "A: May, yeah. And \u2014 yeah, first place the barracks were even worse than they were\nin Hanewacker. And there we were with the \u2014 supposed to be with the Russian\ngirls, and let\u2019s see, what else? But anyhow, it was horrible.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do?",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, we were doing all kind of metalwork and all that kind of stuff, you\nhad to put some kind of glasses to protect your eyes while you were doing all this\nthing. But, since they knew I spoke German, there was this old major who \u2014 who st \u2014\nin a cabin, he was trying out the bullets and all that kind of stuff. And they ute \u2014 they\nused me like a Girl Friday. If somebody was absent and the ammunition could not \u2014\nyou cannot stop this [indecipherable] because everybody was doing his little bit like\nin a \u2014 like in a car factory, you know, that you \u2014 everybody does the same work",
        "Q: The assembly line.",
        "A: Yeah, assembly line. And so I would be sent \u2014 I would be sent where somebody\nwas missing, so that it goes on. And one day they send me with a letter to this booth,\nto this mayor \u2014 he was a major? Yeah, he was a major, kind of old guy. And of\ncourse he had this ear phones on him and was keep on shooting and I didn\u2019t know\nhow to get to him, so I just knock and knock and then finally I said, well, 1s the man\nof the house here or not? And well anyhow, somehow he heard me and I gave him\nthe message and he \u2014 while he was reading this he says, go and get me some coffee\nin the canteen, they had a canteen there, and biscuits, or some special cakes he\nwanted. But they didn\u2019t have it so I bought him this biscuit and I said, they didn\u2019t\nhave anything. And since then he always ask for me to bring him this coffee. So\nwhen I was \u2014 I was so dumb when \u2014 you couldn\u2019t believe it. In this \u2014 anyhow, since\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwe were \u2014 it was very important because we would meet the English \u2014 we had to \u2014\non the certain corner we would meet the English POWs and we would exchange the\nletters. It was absolutely necessary that one of \u2014 that one of his runs first and \u2014 and in\nthis factory you had to have those time sheets, you know, you have the time clock\nand you had to do the \u2014",
        "Q: The punching in?",
        "A: Punch in. And I was \u2014I was the fastest was \u2014 I was punching in for all four of\nthem. And I was doing this one day, somebody goes [coughs] and I look up and\nthere\u2019s this man looking down and he says, the big one would be the better one to do\nwhat you\u2019re doing. I said, I\u2019m not doing anything, but I was saying in German. And\nhe says, ah, if they catch you that you are cheating their factory o-of time for the four\nof you, you gonna wind yourself in a worse camp than the Schmidt and Kranz. And\nI said, well, she is carrying something. And at that time I don\u2019t know what she was\ncarrying, her shoes or something, I don\u2019t remember, but anyhow, it saved me. But,\ncouple of months after that \u2014",
        "Q: It \u2014 th-thi\u2014 when you say the four of you, those were the f \u2014 th \u2014 your three\nfriends \u2014",
        "A: Four girls.",
        "Q: What were their names?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Well, real names was Hedwig, Amalia(ph) and Aniela(ph) and what was the\nfourth one?",
        "Q: You.",
        "A: Oh yeah, was me. Anyhow, so \u2014",
        "Q: And were you still going by your given name?",
        "A: By Eva? Yeah. And anyhow, she \u2014 she came anyhow, so after a few months after\nthat, they got us this engineer and this engineer with some three civilians or\nsomething like that, through the hall. And they stop at my de \u2014 I was doing\nsomething with those \u2014 cutting some stuff. And took off the mask and this guy starts\ntalking to me, the civilian. But instead of as \u2014 waiting for my answers, he starts some\nother \u2014 you know, cuts another theme, I mean, asking a different question without\nwa \u2014 waiting for the answer. So he, after awhile he says to me in French, thank you\nfor you\u2019re an \u2014 thank you. And I say in French pas de quoi, you know. And so this\nengi-engineer says to him, didn\u2019t I tell you she speaks good engli \u2014 good German\u2019?\nAnd that\u2019s it. Then I\u2019m calling \u2014 called in the office and they said, would you like to\ngo and be a kitchen help in this man\u2019s \u2014 this 1s a private firm, but they getting\nconcentration camp people and Russian and God knows they had some Frenchmen\ntoo. And they need the \u2014 a trans \u2014 interpreter and they need a kitchen help. Well, to\nget out of this camp from under this woman that beat me up and all that \u2014",
        "Q: Y-You got beaten up?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: O-Oh yeah, because \u2014",
        "Q: Wha \u2014 how did that happen?",
        "A: How did that happen? Well, the French who were working on the outside, the\nFrench civilians were providing f\u2014 if some \u2014 if the English wanted to escape \u2014 if the\nEnglish POWs wanted to escape, they needed I.D. cards, clothing, and all that kind\nof stuff, and tho \u2014 the French civilians who were delivering it. But we got this\nmessage that there\u2019ll be no delivery tonight. And we had to give this to \u2014 somehow\nlet the English prisoners of war know. But we were in contact with the girls who\nwere still staying in Hanewacker so that we could telegraph [indecipherable]",
        "Q: How were you in contact with them?",
        "A: With whom, with the girls?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, well, we were coming out to \u2014 we \u2014 somehow they had their free day too,\nyou know, so we could \u2014",
        "Q: You would meet.",
        "A: Yeah, we would \u2014 we would meet in that park. And we didn\u2019t know how to do it\nbecause this has got to \u2014 the Frenchman says it\u2019s got to be done tonight.",
        "Q: These are French prisoners?",
        "A: No, no, they were French civilians.",
        "Q: What were they doing there?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Oh, they were not in a camp, they were on the outside. They were slave workers,\nwith th \u2014 except that they were not slave workers, the Vichy government had to\nprovide a certain number of French laborers ex \u2014 and even the French POWs never\nwent \u2014 had it a little easier too, because they didn\u2019t have to march together, they just\n\u2014 they were two or three employed in a bakery, or there was butch \u2014 butcher or\nsomeplace like that, you know, so they \u2014 they were free and they could do things that\nnobody else could. And so how we gonna do this tonight? At that moment I was\ngiving Russian lessons to this guardsman, cause he wanted to go to the eastern front,\nso he was \u2014 he was \u2014 he didn't like the \u2014 he was afraid of the camp supervisor, who\nwas a horrible woman, but he said that if I was cau \u2014 he was caught with me, giving\nme this lesson, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad because we can always say I was just doing\nsomething for him. But anyhow, so when we got this news, I was teaching him, I\ndon\u2019t remember was a difficult [indecipherable] idiot anyhow, wanting to go to the\neastern front. But \u2014",
        "Q: You knew Russian?",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable]",
        "Q: How did you know Russian?",
        "A: How did I know Russian? From the tailor. He \u2014 he would give me a \u2014 a \u2014 no, I\nwould bring my coat to be pressed, or something like that and in order to keep me\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbusy he would give me a\u2014 a Russian, because he was a White Russian, that\u2019s where\nthe White Russians \u2014",
        "Q: This is the tailor in Krakow?",
        "A: Yeah, and he \u2014 they were White Russians, and so he would give me this Russian\nnewspaper and [indecipherable] I said, I can\u2019t read it, and he \u2014 every time I came he\nwould give me a different Russian letter to print, and to learn to \u2014 so I knew how it\nwas \u2014 you know, I could read, but I didn't know what I was reading, but that\u2019s besi \u2014\nthe same thing that I did with this German, that I could perfectly typing and writing,\ndidn\u2019t know what I was doing. And he \u2014 anyhow, was wor \u2014 easy words I could tell,\nI mean, and \u2014",
        "Q: So you\u2019re teaching this guy?",
        "A: Teaching this guy, and the girl says finish it, finish it, oh we \u2014 I have news for\nyou, you know. And then she says, we\u2019ve a \u2014 got to do something, and aw \u2014 for my\nbad luck, the guy who \u2014 who watches the camp for this woman, had to go around to\nsee if all barracks were closed. And he leaves the door open. So I was going to climb\nthough the window anyhow to get to the telephone, and get in touch with these\nfriends who was on the PWs line. I mean, he was their helper, you know, like he\nsometimes will let him go. Or if they went to shop, he would, you know be easy f\u2014\non them. And \u2014 but this guy leaves this door open, okay? And I call and I say th \u2014\ncall this numb \u2014 or \u2014 no, how is that I didn\u2019t know the telephone numbers? It took\nFebruary 2, 2001\nme quite a while cause I didn\u2019t know where to look for the number of the camp. But\nthen I see oh, she\u2019s got a whole list there in front of her of the camps, you know. But\nI \u2014 I just called and then I said, may I speak to Fritz? And this says,\n[indecipherable] Fritz, and I know \u2014 oh, you\u2019re not the one I want. And I made this\nmistake saying you\u2019re not the one that I want, that was number one mistake. And she\nslammed the thing down. Then \u2014 but since I was having my finger on the number,\nthey know what I was calling. And so she calls \u2014 she says, who 1s this, what\u2019s this,\nand I made a st \u2014 absolutely idiotic mistake and I said, well, I just wanted to get in\ntouch with a German soldier I used to know. And that\u2019s against all the \u2014 so, she calls\nit, she calls this number, and he says, would you please stop bothering me?\n[indecipherable] you \u2014 and I think he called her a bitch, but I no \u2014 that\u2019s what she\nsaid anyhow. She says, if you had a boyfriend that was a nice fellow, I wouldn\u2019t say\nanything, but bah-ba-ba-ba-ba. And so, how did you get here in \u2014 so, and I said\nwell, it was open. And of course that was number three mistakes because the guy\nwas supposed to lock the office, left it open. So f \u2014 three things against him, so\nanyhow, she hit this a bam \u2014 a bamboo stick and he says \u2014 whacks, whacks, whacks.\nAnd anyhow he beat me too, but anyhow \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know anything would\nhappen because finally fainted, you know, because [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You were so badly hurt?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah, but I think that I was so glad that I was hurt, because they would have\nbeaten it out of me.",
        "Q: The information?",
        "A: Yeah, that I knew the German guard who was helping the British. And \u2014 and the\nguy, when we once ask him why, he says, well, one day I may be a British prisoner\nof war, and \u2014 well, anyhow. So that\u2019s how I got \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] did you get back to your barrack after you were beaten?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how it happened, but anyhow I found myself der \u2014 with girls\nlooking at me and they said \u2014 and they says, you didn\u2019t say anything, because if you\nsaid something you wouldn\u2019t be here any more. But I was also [indecipherable] so\nthen this guard, this Willie came and brought me some hot tea and some sandwiches\nfrom the girls and I couldn\u2019t eat anything because my mouth was so swollen. And\nthe kid says \u2014",
        "Q: Did they beat you all over your body, or just your face?",
        "A: I don\u2019t mi \u2014 my body too, of course. But anyhow, he says, oh this is not\n[indecipherable] he said, you write \u2014 see ya \u2014 I think I\u2019m gonna write a letter to the\nRed Cross, they\u2019re not supposed to do things like that. This is not a concentration\ncamp, this is a labor camp. And I say Willie, it\u2019s not for civilians, Red Cross is only\nfor military and you better not get involved in this. And I said to myself, what on\nearth \u2014 how can this fellow want to be [indecipherable] an SS man. But the only\nFebruary 2, 2001\nreason why he was, cause he wanted to go to the eastern front. But anyhow, that\u2019s\nhow, after \u2014 oh yeah, and this old mayor \u2014 major, so used to this coffee business and\nthe biscuits, says where is she, what\u2019s the matter? Nobody brings me coffee. And\nthey said well, she is sick in camp. And \u2014 what happened to her. And she said, but t\n\u2014 if you don\u2019t \u2014 we tell you what happened, but don\u2019t tell anybody else. But he calls\nthe camp, and the doctor comes and looks me over and he says nah, you\u2019re gonna be\nokay. And nothing on the inside was hurt. So that\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s why I already was\nin sort of a \u2014 people were kind of looking out for me, fo \u2014 and I was looking for a\nway out of this. So when this opportunity to be this interpreter in kitch \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nknow \u2014 the girl says to me, are you crazy? You don\u2019t know what it means to be a\nkitchen help. You have to s-s \u2014 to peel potatoes and cut [indecipherable] and all that\nkind of stuff. I said, I\u2019d do anything, I would even make up for that man if I could\nget out of here. And so that\u2019s how I was transferred to this private company, but the\nprivate company was working with \u2014 because they were in this \u2014 that was a building\ncompany and they would go to the woods and get these huge stumps of trees, you\nknow, that they would use to support the galleries in the underground factory and all\nthat kind of stuff. So \u2014",
        "Q: So how long were you at Schmidt and Kranz?",
        "A: I was not very long, because from \u2014",
        "Q: You were a few months in Hanewacker \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",

        "Q: In septem \u2014 and you \u2014 in September, mm-hm.",
        "A: Mm-hm, so it wasn\u2019t long. And I stayed there til the end of stin \u2014 til liberation.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And the reason why he got me out of this Schmidt and Kranz was because he\nknew all this Gestapo and he work 1n this \u2014 the \u2014 see, the SS already was in this\nbuilding, running concentration camps for profit. So there is somehow \u2014 anyhow, he\nknew enough people to get me out to his firm. Then when the time came to deliver\nme back to the camp, he had my \u2014 he again used his connections not to send me back\nto the camp, and he really saved my life. And I know that because I read his\ncorrespondence while I was cleaning his room, hi-his office and so I know there was\na correspondence about when are you sending this \u2014 this woman back, or this girl\nback and all that. Then I said to the children \u2014 they had two children, I said to them,\nwell, you better watch \u2014 I don\u2019t think I will be telling you any more stories, because\nI have to go away. And they said, oh no, you\u2019re not going away, my \u2014 my daddy and\nmommy and doing anything just to keep you here.",

        "A: Ratzfeldt(ph).",
        "Q: And his first \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",

        "A: Oh my gosh, peeling potatoes and rutabags. Cleaning the old lady \u2014 his mother\u2019s\n\u2014no, his mother didn\u2019t never employ me, she only \u2014 his old mother only asked me to\ncarry wood into the house so I could take a bath in her bathtub, because they didn\u2019t\nwant to send me to delousing, because that would take a whole day. So there was\nsome kind of shower someplace in the building in this \u2014 in this Russian kitchen, so\nto say for me to take a shower there. So \u2014",
        "Q: Th-They didn\u2019t want to send you where?",
        "A: To the delousing.",
        "Q: Oh, to delousing.",
        "A: Delousing.",
        "Q: This is when you first came, you mean?",
        "A: Yeah. And it \u2014 so, I was telling her it was too cold in there, you know. She says,\nwell you don\u2019t have to get \u2014 this old lady says, you don\u2019t have to \u2014 to go there, you\ncan take a bath in my house. She says, don\u2019t tell my son or my \u2014 especially my\ndaughter-in-law. And I was \u2014 I would be carrying a big basket of \u2014 the first time it\nhappened she told me to bring this big basket of wood. And I said, what\u2019s happening\nto her? I mean, she never asked me to do any heavy work, so all of a sudden \u2014 well,\nanyhow, she had the servant and the servant would say \u2014 she says, well, that\u2019s just a\ncamouflage so you can take a bath. And then her son find that out. And he says,\nMother, I know what you\u2019re doing. If my wife finds out, there\u2019s gonna be a murder\nFebruary 2, 2001\nin this house. Well, she says, we\u2019re not gonna tell her. So she di \u2014 she didn\u2019t, but\nsomehow her mother, the young woman, his wife\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is, I must\nhave \u2014 that\u2019s another mistake I made, cause she says, you like the old Mrs.\nRatzfeldt(ph)? And I said oh yeah, she reminds me of my grandmother, or whatever,\nand besides, she lets me take a bath. And then this woman was jealous that she lets\nme take a bath, so she would say, oh you can take a bath in my thing. But she had\nthe diabetes and I said \u2014 I thought that was some kind of sickness you can catch, you\nknow, and I said oh, no thank you, I \u2014 anyhow, and I \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re using the wood to heat the water?",
        "A: Yeah. And, you know, it\u2019s kind of stove when you use the wood. But anyhow, so\nit was \u2014 was really \u2014 it was really ridiculous already. So I cleaned this hi \u2014 her\nmother\u2019s house and her \u2014 she told her mother, she doesn\u2019t know how to do anything,\nshe doesn\u2019t even know how to sweep the floor. And I said, excuse me, but I do\nknow. I mean, I used to \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I told them, but anyhow, I would have\ndone anything just to \u2014 so I had to \u2014 and then, I had to give the children French\nlessons. And then, if they had guests, because lots of times, you know, in business\nlike that you entertain a lot, so I had to work overtime. Clean the dishes and all that.\nSince you in \u2014 but she was a fantastic cook, so \u2014 anyhow, this old lady had the\nservant hang up over the house entrance a sign that says God bless this house. Then\nthe young lady would \u2014 the wife would come out, take it down and put heil Hitler\nFebruary 2, 2001\nsign. And I never off \u2014 forgot how she said to me, go and hang it out. And I said,\nwell, I\u2019m small, I might fall down. But anyhow, she said \u2014 I was doing it so\nawkwardly that \u2014 that she grabs it away from me, gets on this chair and almost fells\nover, you know, but 1-it was such a funny \u2014 and I took it all like an adventure.",
        "Q: How did you celebrate your 18\" birthday?",
        "A: Gee, I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You were in this house, it\u2019s October \u201942.",
        "A: Oh yes, I didn\u2019t celebrate, they celebrated for me. Oh yeah, and I also had to\nwork in a garden. This woman had a garden outside the city, the old mu \u2014 the mother\nof the young woman, and I had to \u2014 and this one day \u2014 I forgot all about my\nbirthday, and I \u2014 sh-she always gives me work, extra work and I said please hurry\nup, because I\u2019Il be late for the Russian kitchen, I have to get the food out. And she\nalways finds this stuff to do for me, do this or that. And I used to pull a little wagon\nin the middle of the street and it was loaden with potatoes or fruits or whatever she\ngot, or [indecipherable]. And I get there and she kind of laughs and I look to \u2014 go to\nthe Russian kitchen and it says, all food has been given out, it\u2019s all done. The kitchen\nis closed. And I go upstairs and I open the door to this little room, and I can\u2019t believe\nmy eyes. This had curtains on the windows and it had like a little table there and\nthere were books on a shelf. And somebody says, happy birthday and there were\nthose \u2014 the man and the woman. And that\u2019s how I started celebrating my birthday,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbecause in \u2014 in Catholic countries you celebrate your name\u2019s days for the name of\nyour patron saint. And Adam and Eve are not exactly saints, but \u2014 but they on the \u2014\ntheir day comes on the 24\" of December, that\u2019s where Adam and Eve celebrate their\nbirthdays. And so that\u2019s how I cele \u2014 I really beautifully celebrated my birth \u2014 and\nthen I said to myself, I used to believe in guardian angels, but I knew that when I\nsaw this old lady, I said, he can rest now, because I got another guardian angel, so \u2014\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nFebruary 2, 2001\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kristina Belfoure. This is tape number three,\nside A. And could you explain a little bit what you meant by the Russian kitchen?",
        "A: Well, the Ratzfeldts(ph) employed Russians, foreign slave workers. And of\ncourse they got different rations than the Frenchmen. The Frenchmen got better food\nrations than the Russians. And so, since there were so many of them, I think 32 or\nsomething like that, they had to \u2014 the \u2014 they \u2014 the old lady and her maid originally\nwere the bosses of this Russian kitchen, but then they couldn\u2019t manage it, so his wife\nbecame the boss of this kitchen. And of course, her mother was helping her. That\nwas just too big a kitchen for one. But anyhow, I \u2014 what I was doing 1s washing\ndishes and peeling potatoes and starting the fire and bringing \u2014 making the coffee\nand the sandwiches for the Frenchmen, and then the Russians came and I would give\nthem her breakfast and her br \u2014 their bread and then I would sn \u2014 all day long cook\nthe so-soup for the Russians. And there was always a different stuff for the\nFrenchmen, too. And then when the people from the concentration camp came,\nbecause we \u2014 they \u2014 she also employed people in concentration camps and Dora was\nstarted, he also employed the people from the concentration camps, and \u2014 well,\nanyhow, to make a long story short, he wanted to \u2014 I was looking out the window\nseeing prisoners coming and he says, oh you \u2014 you making signs at them, which I\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwas, and I said no, I was just watching why they walk so slowly, you know, because\nthrough that street there was a columns of \u2014 of \u2014 of concentration camps people\npassing by. And I say, an hour or so, oh so, so slow. And he says yeah, I wonder\nabout that too. It takes four of them to lift a \u2014 lift a \u2014",
        "Q: Tr-Trunk?",
        "A: Trunk. And of course he says, I \u2014 and I say, my \u2014 must be hungry. So she says,\nask what they getting to eat. And of course I asked a kapo, and I asked the cook,\nbecause they also had there another cook, cause we just couldn't \u2014 I couldn\u2019t make it.\nAnd he says well, I don\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t tell us, because she thought it was a\ncatch and the cook wouldn\u2019t eat it. And I said, why don\u2019t you ask them yourself?\nCause they wouldn\u2019t tell me. And so evidently \u2014 he says he don\u2019t have paper, he\nlooks like they\u2019re getting enough to eat. And the kapo says sure, and all on paper it\nlooks enough, but by the time everybody steals, the prisoners don\u2019t get anything, or\nhardly anything. And so this woman used to get couple of those Russian workers and\ngo into the fields and there [indecipherable] around, and she would say w-we can g-\nglean your fields. And so \u2014 but the people who were leaving the potatoes or the\nrutabags(ph) knew that she would come and pick them up so they always left some\nextra, and that\u2019s how she cooked the soup for \u2014 to add it to the prisoners, because the\nguy said \u2014 the kapo said, well, she wants us to work. He says, a slave only works\nwhen somebody\u2019s watching him, but I, of course, didn\u2019t tell him that. But I say, if he\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwants us to work more, then he has to give us food. And so that\u2019s exactly what the \u2014\nhe was thinking too, you know. That\u2019s how they started cooking those soups. And \u2014",
        "Q: Who \u2014 who were the concentration camp victims, were they Jews?",
        "A: N-No, ther \u2014 ther \u2014 I don\u2019t know who they were but I don\u2019t think they were Jews.\nI think they were just Poles and French, Poles, Frenchmen and Germans who wer \u2014\nanybody who was in \u2014 in the \u2014 in Mittelbau-Dora. More \u2014 lots of them were people\nwho knew how to \u2014 were former technicians or former engineers, or \u2014 or they \u2014 of\ncourse there was just simple labor force, too, but I mean \u2014 I-I really never learned\nwho they were, you know. And I don\u2019t know whether they were Jews or not. They\nprobably were.",
        "Q: Did you see any Jews when you were living with this family?",
        "A: You can tell, that everybody has a stripped \u2014 and most of them were political\nbecause they di \u2014 they had red triangles. So \u2014",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t see yellow stars?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Who \u2014 who was Gise \u2014 Gisela(ph) \u2014 Gisela(ph)?",
        "A: Oh, Gisela(ph) was a niece of the boss of \u2014 in the lumberyard, one of the bosses\nin the lumberyard, and they lived on a side house, in the same side where the French\nslave labor \u2014 oh, not slave, they were not slave [indecipherable] the French wer \u2014\nworkers were living. And after we got those two Russian girls and they occupied\nFebruary 2, 2001\nthose two rooms under the roof, I didn't have a place to stay, so the old Mrs.\nRatzfeldt(ph) said I could live in the room where her son used to live.",
        "Q: In her \u2014 1n her house?",
        "A: Yeah, in the \u2014 and the son was on the eastern front. And so when the family of\nthe boss called Langer(ph) came out of Hamburg, they were bumped out, he took\nthem in their house. And so the girl, Gisele(ph) was staying with me, and that\u2019s who\nit was and we became friends.",
        "Q: I just wanted to read a little bit from your book, and if you could then elaborate\non it when I finish \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 I would appreciate it. Gisela(ph) 1s telling you, you know you\u2019re getting more\nand more over-sensitive, she said. And you answer, \u201chow can I avoid being\noversensitive, when I feel as if I\u2019m in a cage, even a big one like the\nRathshear\u2019s(ph) lumberyard? Everything 1s so weird, people are afraid of me and\nI\u2019m afraid of them and of the surroundings. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of all\nGermans, Gisela(ph) was trying to soothe my nerves. Not all are rascals and not all\nare monsters.\u201d And then you say, \u201canyone can be a rascal or a monster. Give a man a\ngun, teach him to hate, give him prisoners and a free hand with them and the best\nman will become a rascal, if not a complete monster at one time or another. Even a\nFebruary 2, 2001\nchild will lend his hand to the sufferings of others.\u201d Did you want to elaborate a little\nbit what you meant by that?",
        "A: Well, it was this obvious, that I\u2019ve seen it happen and that\u2019s how you probably\nturn or \u2014 so-called ordinary people into monsters when they have power over\nsomebody else\u2019s, or they want to f-further a career, or they want to get more money,\nor they want to just show that they can do with other people what they want to do,\nthat they are this powerful once.",
        "Q: When you were there, were you aware of what was happening in the rest of\nEurope? Did you have a sense of what was going on in the other countries, and with\nthe war?",
        "A: Well, I knew \u2014 well one time Gisel(ph) and I were \u2014 I had a key to the house, and\nGisel(ph) \u2014 I was afraid to cross the yard, so I would open the front door and walk\nher to the side entrance of that \u2014 what do they call that, barracks. And since she was\nfrom Hamburg, one time we were \u2014 we were walking and she was talking and there\nwere two f-flyers, German flyers and they rec \u2014 one of them says, hey, there\u2019s a girl\nfrom Hamburg. And they started talking to her, and of course I was scared to death\nthat they gonna discover me. And \u2014 well, anyhow, is \u2014 this other one says \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow what I said, and he says, oh, I hate those bastards. And I say, what bastards?\nAnd he says oh, those Polish flyers. They don\u2019t care if they die as long as they get\nsome of us down. And that\u2019s how I learned that there were Polish flyers in England,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nyou know, and I was almost \u2014 and Gisela(ph) was just shaking, just hope she doesn\u2019t\nsay anything to betray who she is. Of course I was so glad all of a sudden I was so \u2014\nI was so glad that they are fighting, that they are there, you know, and \u2014 anyhow, I\nmade it up that somebody is calling us, so we went into the house and I never went\non the street again. But Gisela(ph) went out with this one flyer and the other one\nwanted a date, but of course that\u2019s how it gets when you wear civilian clothes and a\nP, small, not like the Jewish star.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you were still wearing your P?",
        "A: Oh yeah, but of course when I went out, y-you put it on \u2014 I put it so that it got\nunder the \u2014",
        "Q: Under the lapel.",
        "A: \u2014 lapel, and you \u2014 then, 1f somebody was looking, I \u2014 well anyhow, about the\nmonsters, the Ratzfeldts(ph) used me for many things. I mean, I had this Russian\nkitchen, that was my main job from f-five o\u2019clock in the morning til whenever the\nlast dish was handed out and the kitchen was clean, okay? But they also would, if\nneed be, do something \u2014 send me someplace. And one time they had to get\nsomething from the bank, so they send me to the bank. And in order to get to the\nbank, since I didn\u2019t ride the bicycle and I \u2014 and \u2014 a-and I couldn\u2019t get on the tram \u2014\non the streetcar, cause I had this P, but a-anyhow, I got to the bank and I \u2014 oh yeah,\nand in order to get on the bus, I took off the P, to get on a streetcar. But when I got\nFebruary 2, 2001\nto the bank, I\u2019m waiting and waiting, and I was to come home immediately with this\npaper that they needed. And the \u2014 the bank director comes out and he says to the boy\non the door, has this Pole showed up? And he says no. And I say, here I am. And the\nguy says, oh, but she doesn\u2019t have her P. And he denounced me, and then that even \u2014\nthat afternoon came two Gestapo men, or SS, whatever they are, and wa \u2014 that I de \u2014\ndid tell them, the Ratzfeldts(ph) what happened, you know, but they were to be\npunished for letting me walk and going \u2014 getting me go to the bank and all that, so\nall this was hanging together. And so when they came, they said well, either you\nshow her \u2014 I don\u2019t know what he says \u2014 either you teach her a lesson or we do. And\nthat meant that he had to hit me and beat me, you know, so he did hit me, but with\n[indecipherable]. And so after that when they left, you know, I was [crying]. And\nhe says \u2014 they called me in and I wouldn\u2019t talk to them \u2014 and he says, what ha \u2014\nwhat were we supposed to do?",
        "Q: Wh-Who \u2014 who was the one to beat you, your \u2014",
        "A: The Ratzfeldt(ph), the owner. And he says that if they would have done, if I\nhadn\u2019t done, they would \u2014 they would have done. And he says, and you know the\nGestapo. And I said no, I don\u2019t [indecipherable] don\u2019t tell me the story because I\nknow all about you and \u2014 and the Gestapo man in Krakow and all that. So I didn\u2019t\nhave \u2014 didn\u2019t want to say anything. But I know that he \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t his case,\nokay. But \u2014 but this guy in the camp too, you know, when he hit me, I mean, it was\nFebruary 2, 2001\njust power, you just \u2014 shows how powerful he 1s, he [indecipherable] hit somebody\nand the somebody has to suffer. So \u2014",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s true of everyone, or some people resist that urge?",
        "A: Well, ins \u2014 under certain sim \u2014 circumstan \u2014 in circum \u2014 certain circumstances,\nthey\u2019ll be very few people who are resistant. If you have to fear for your own life, or\nfor your life of your family, or life of your community, you probably would do what\nthey want you to do, if the system was like that Hitlerian(ph) system was",
        "Q: Di\u2014 when you said something before about you saw some of the concentration\ncamp workers walking along the street \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 did you know what a concentration camp was, or what did it mean to you?",
        "A: Well, of course when they came to us \u2014 oh, well, I know that there was \u2014 there\nwas supposed to be a p \u2014 I knew there were political prisoners and I already know\nabout Auschwitz and all that. I know \u2014 but I had absolutely no idea what they do in\nthem. And just \u2014 they just went to work, and they were dressed differently so that\nthey couldn\u2019t escape.",
        "Q: Did you know about the killings that were going on?",
        "A: No, no, because nobody was allowed to talk about it. No civilians \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t\neven \u2014 I only learned that now from the things that I translated for the museum, from\nthe Gestapo in whatever, that they were not allowed to even write anything about\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwhat happened. So that nothing \u2014 1f you \u2014 somebody died in a concentration camp,\nthey were just to give orally the information, they were not to write, so that there\nreally were no written accounts about that, except that the Germans could help but\nbeing as \u2014a\u2014how can I say, they loved to write and have everything in order, so\n[indecipherable] some of them did write this stuff. But they were not allowed to.\nBut I still thin \u2014 I think still that they treated German Jews better than they did any\nother Jews, because someplace I think that they would return the urn with the ashes,\neven if 1t wasn\u2019t the \u2014 the ashes of the ones who died, and they could bury them \u2014 I\nread it someplace in those 1 \u2014 in those \u2014 1n those testimony, that they could bury\nthem in a Jewish cemetery. So \u2014 but they wouldn\u2019t do that for any other Jew, just the\nGerman Jew.",
        "Q: Di-Did you ever hear about the assassination attempt on Hitler\u2019s life?",
        "A: Oh yeah, everybody heard about that, you know, and \u2014",
        "Q: What was your response, or your reaction?",
        "A: Gosh, how could he [indecipherable] now, in the first place, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I\nthought everybody was for him, see, because openly the newspapers, the propaganda\nand nobody would say a word against, except that old lady with this heil Hitler sign\nthat she didn\u2019t want to have over her house. But I \u2014 I ask this lady, why is it that they\nwant to assassinate him if he is getting so much land for him and so all this forced\nlabors and all that, and bring so much money into the thing, why would they want to\nFebruary 2, 2001\na-assassinate him? And he says well, because he\u2019s not doing the right things. And\nMr. Ratzfeldt(ph) said, I\u2019ve \u2014 because \u2014 she was blaming the generals for losing the\nwar in Russia and all that kind of stuff, that\u2019s why the generals got into it. And \u2014 but\nthe ran \u2014 radio was full of Goering \u2014 not Goerings, but Goebbels saying that God\nsaved Hitler and he has \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 has to have a s \u2014 God\u2019s help to let him stay alive\nand all that, otherwise he would \u2014 but then when they started \u2014 except that when they\nstarted hanging up the people who were doing it, that was at the same time that I\nthink the Warsaw up \u2014 ghetto uprising was going on, I think, so that \u2014",
        "Q: That was spring of \u201943 was the Warsaw ghetto.",
        "A: No, then that was the Polish uprising, yeah.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I thought, yeah, in \u201944.",
        "A: \u201944, and they were all \u2014 the newspaper were full of \u2014 so Hitler got kind of lost\nsomeplace.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t want to advertise this idea that there 1s somebody against him, so\nthat they wouldn't \u2014 wouldn\u2019t all come together and get rid of him.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they publicize all this uprising and he was kind of on the back burner\nthen.",
        "Q: Did you used to hear his speeches on the radio?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah, I wa \u2014",
        "Q: What were your \u2014 what were your impressions?",
        "A: Impressions \u2014 I hated him already, you know, my impressions weren\u2019t that\nfavorable, he was a good demagogue and sa \u2014 I saw him personally, too. He couldn\u2019t\nhave a per \u2014 victory parade in Warsaw because Warsaw was bombed, so he had a\nwi \u2014 victory parade over Poland in Krakow, and he was marching there. And\npeople were su-supposedly pushed through the streets and they were \u2014 so he would\nsee people lined up and all that kind of stuff.",
        "Q: Were you lined up to see him?",
        "A: Oh, I know because I was upstairs on the \u2014 in the \u2014 on my uncle\u2019s house, looking\ndown from the window.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t want to go downstairs?",
        "A: Are you kidding? Are you kidding? Having seen so many people \u2014 of your own\npeople dead, city ruined and all that? Literally - somehow we knew he is gonna lose,\nthe minute the Americans came in. Gisela(ph) said, it\u2019s gonna be over soon. My\nuncle said, minute the Americans come in, it\u2019s gonna be over. And it was over.\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: So you spent the rest of the war years doing this same work with this family?",
        "A: Oh yeah.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: Any other experiences there that you want to talk about, while you were working\nthere?",
        "A: Well, really nothing. Was a normal sa \u2014 I just loved the old lady, and \u2014",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Elsa(ph). And she was from Berlin and she hated Nordhausen. She married this\nma \u2014 she hated little towns and she didn\u2019t like the wife of the son because she\nmarried \u2014 she had already planned his marriage and he didn't marry somebody she\nwanted to marry. So I think I was really getting the better of this quarrel between the\ntwo of them, but they of course \u2014 they \u2014 they had \u2014 they had this \u2014 they had this aunt\nwho lost her fianc\u00e9 in the first war \u2014 war, and she was working for the Red Cross.\nAnd she just stopped working there, and I said, wh-why \u2014 why? And she says \u2014 I\nsays, cannot see how young people can go to war so happy and laugh. Cause she saw\nthis \u2014 she was handing coffee to the soldiers, and of course they were waving and\nshouting and singing. And he says, they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going. They don\u2019t\nknow that they\u2019re going to their death. And she \u2014 she says, I Just can\u2019t take it. I just\ncan\u2019t take young people being butchered. So I, to this day I all \u2014 the father was\ndiscovered after the war with \u2014 oh, with an English revolver or something, and of\ncourse that was in East Germany, and so he was in prison and then he was sent to\nSiberia, where he died. And nobody told me \u2014 everybody knew, and I \u2014 he was\naccused of having killed me, by some woman there. And his mother, who knew that\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI was alive, didn\u2019t say one word for me to come to his help. After all, this guy set me\nfree, instead of sending me [indecipherable] shot this pistol and that kind of stuff.\nBut she \u2014 there were Gestapo men in the house, and \u2014 and maybe they didn\u2019t want\nany witnesses and so \u2014 so she got out and \u2014 but she took the stu \u2014 children, and she\ntold me run, run. And \u2014",

        "A: Well, the town was bombed and they \u2014 these people had a ha \u2014 house in the\nwoods, and whenever they could escape they would go to this house in the woods.\nAnd of course, where everything was bombed, they \u2014 they moved to the woods. And\nI used to \u2014 and I remember that I helped them carry out the \u2014 he had a \u2014 he had there\na truck and he used to take the things from the house and from his mother-in-law to\nthe \u2014 course, his mother said I\u2019m not moving, I\u2019m staying here. And while I was \u2014 I\nbrought the things into the house and I think I was gonna \u2014 a-and they were those SS\nmen or Gestapo men, I don\u2019t know, they had uniforms, they were sitting there. And\n\u2014 or rather, there were \u2014 there were the Gestapo men who already changed their\nclothes, but I knew them. And evidently, I don\u2019t know, I was nervous so I don\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nknow what happened, but anyhow all of a sudden he \u2014 they were talking, blah, blah,\nblah and then he says to me, ah, leave what you\u2019re doing there and come out. But he\nalso calls the children, the girl and the little boy. And we go outside and I see him\nwith his revolver. And I said, my gosh, is he gonna shoot me or something? And he\nsaid, now, you run and run straight to Nordhausen so you can see my mother,\nbecause I promised I\u2019d bring you back, or you come back. And \u2014 but watch it. And I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, so I didn\u2019t run. And he says run, so my bullet doesn\u2019t get you.\nAnd he b \u2014 of course, he shot in the air you know, and I run. And that\u2019s how \u2014 and\nnobody \u2014 nobody told the police, or the \u2014 or the whatever they had, NK VD, or\nwhatever they had in those days, that I was alive, that [indecipherable] his mother\nmust have hated him, or whatever there was, you know, they were scared for their\nown lives, so that\u2019s why they helped this man. And I would have told them he was\ngood to the prisoners and he helped to feed them and \u2014 and all that, but \u2014 I could\nhave been a good witness for him.",
        "Q: So you ran back to his mother?",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and so \u2014 and while I was going to his mother, I didn\u2019t get there yet, I\nsaw this big American tanks coming in. And the first soldiers that were coming were\nthe black men \u2014 I mean the \u2014 the f\u2014 they were black, the \u2014 course they used them\nmostly you know, just the big trucks and all that. Well, but anyhow, so here they\nwere and they\u2019re laughing and throwing candies and all that. And I \u2014 and I don\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nknow but \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether I was such a \u2014 I was really awful. I must have put\nthe P on my thing. But anyhow \u2014 and they were shouting Polski, Polska\n[indecipherable]. I pick up the candy and I go, because I was so worried his mother\nand this maid and her servant will be suffering, you know, the American occupied,\nbecause there were few houses still standing and one \u2014 theirs was one of them. And I\nget in there and there sit these four American young soldiers and she speaks English\nwith them. And they giving her, I don\u2019t know what they were eating, or something\nlike that, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about that, because I was worried to death, you\nknow, what on \u2014 on earth\u2019s going to happen to those two old women. There was a\nthird one, she was a nurse, too, and she was the nurse to this old lady, but she also\nwas a nurse in a gynecologist\u2019s office or something. So all these three old ladies, I\nsaid oh my God, what\u2019s going to happen to them? Nothing happened. They were\ntaken care of by the Americans, so \u2014",
        "Q: You still didn\u2019t speak English, right?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So then what did you do when you saw them?",
        "A: Well, when I saw them \u2014 oh, I spoke fren \u2014 oh yeah, now there was a Polish\nsoldier \u2014 I mean, an American who was Polish, you know, and he came looking in\ntoo, looking for girls. And he has this, you know, a wedding band on his hand. I said,\noh [indecipherable] that\u2019s how married men are. Well, anyhow. And th \u2014 but there\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwere people who far \u2014 couple of them spoke French and the rest was in sign\nlanguage.",
        "Q: Did you feel liberated, and \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I did, my goodness gracious, the minute I saw that truck, I felt liberated.",
        "Q: What was that like for you?",
        "A: You can\u2019t really describe it. You can absolutely not describe it. I\u2019m so happy that\nI lived through and I \u2014 and I got to this \u2014 that this moment has come. See ya \u2014 that\ntime you didn\u2019t count how many people had to die to bring you freedom. You didn\u2019t\nthink about a grave of the American soldiers, of the ones who have fallen or\nwounded, and \u2014 and they was blinded or would spend years and years 1n all those\nhospices. You don\u2019t think about that, all you think is about yourself and how they\nbrought you freedom, but at what cost, you know? Y-You didn't even think about it.\nBut that was a glorious moment. Just the fact that you survived and that you feel this\n\u2014 course we all knew America\u2019s gonna win anyhow, so yeah, especially with\nGisela(ph) you know, who was saying me \u2014 I\u2019m telling you, once the American\ncomes \u2014 come, the war is over. And it was [indecipherable]",
        "Q: How did you know that once the American \u2014 what did America mean to you?",
        "A: Well, they always meant they\u2019d always bring you freedom. In the first World War\nthey brought freedom, and there was President Wilson, who \u2014 who ha \u2014 with his\npoints, he made independent Poland and all that. And so of course, I mean, America\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwas always like a land of freedom, land of liberty and y-you knew that once\nAmericans get here, Hitler will be finished. Of course you never knew that for sure,\nbecause he had developed that V-1s, V-2 sooner, you never know how it would have\nended.",
        "Q: Then what did you do?",
        "A: What did I do? Well, I \u2014",
        "Q: Did you stay with the older women?",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t stay because the \u2014 immediately the Americans issued a \u2014\nAmericans issued a proclamation that all POWs, foreign POWs and slave workers\nhave to report \u2014 guess where? To Dora. They \u2014 out of Dora they made this transit\ncamp for all liberated people, so that\u2019s how I really knew that gas chambers and\nhospital and \u2014 and that\u2019s where I really learned about what was going on in Dora\nbefore. And I stayed there.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what did that do to you when you realized what \u2014 the extent of what was\ngoing on?",
        "A: When I first [indecipherable] thank God it wasn\u2019t me, because that\u2019s what you\nalways think, you know? And then there\u2019s this \u2014 this enormity of this crime was just\nhards to grasp. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did people talk \u2014 or did you talk about it with the other Polish \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: When they \u2014 they talk. And \u2014 and there were \u2014 you know, wherever you went\nthere was something, see what we\u2019re together with \u2014 there were still the s \u2014 s \u2014 the\nsurvivors of the concentration camps were the people who were sick and they\ncouldn\u2019t finish them off, they left them in this hospital, or took some of them inside\nthe galleries and that\u2019s why the people from Nordhausen could not escape the\nbombing and be saved, because they didn\u2019t want to say what they were doing in\nthose underground tunnels, and the \u2014 all the dead people there. And so they had dead\non both side. And it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to believe, you know, and you just say\nhow come me? How \u2014 how come I am alive and the many thousands died, you ask\nyourself, what am I for here, why have I been left? And you have this question, you\nknow, what am I gonna do, how am I gonna repay all this liberty? That\u2019s why I\nalways give to the \u2014 to the American war veterans, the blinded veterans and all this.\nAnd that\u2019s probably one of the reason why I work here, too. Maybe to atone for the\nthings that I could have done and didn\u2019t do to save the Jews, that I could. And I may\nbe \u2014 of course, I was too young to do anything, but I re \u2014 could have done more. But\nthen you \u2014 you wonder, how come I, and I bet you every survivor is asking the same\nquestion. They say, what does God have in store for me to have let me live?",
        "Q: So then you \u2014 you went, and how long did you stay in this transit camp?",
        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see, that was the year \u2014 1t ga \u2014 was the co \u2014 camp was called Heilbronn.\nThose were the displaced persons who were not from \u2014 oh no, and then in Dora\nFebruary 2, 2001\nthere was a \u2014 here is a convoy transport going to Poland, and those of you who don\u2019t\nwant to go to Poland can go west. And of course that was the time where, from what\nI have heard from the Russians, an the Ukrainians, how horrible Russian and the\nSoviet system is, I said, even worse than the Germans, than the Nazis even at war \u2014 I\nmean, they are just as the Nazis if not worse. And so, not going to go into any Soviet\noccupied Poland, so I decided then I\u2019m going west.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kristine Belfoure. This is tape number three,\nside B, and you were talking about how you didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland, that\nyou wanted to go west and that \u2014 and I had asked you about your parents, did you\nnot want to go back to be with your family.",
        "A: All my \u2014 oops \u2014 no, I\u2019ve \u2014 I didn\u2019t even think about my family at that time,\nespecially under the Soviets, I wasn\u2019t going to \u2014 to fall into the clutches of any \u2014 of\nany system like that any more, so I just wanted to go west. And I went west, and I\nwent to the \u2014 this DP camp in Heilbronn. I work for them in the office there. I really\nstarted peeling potatoes again in a kitchen, but then there was somebody coming\nthrough the kitchen, and somebody must have told them that I know languages and\nall that kind of stuff, and they were asking for my name, and I pretended I didn\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nhear anything, cause I wasn\u2019t going to be involved in anything else. And then\nsomebody pointed to me and says, that\u2019s she and says what are you doing here\npeeling potatoes when we need help in this Polish office? I mean, the Pole \u2014 they\nhave Germans and Dutch and all that, and Lithuanians and Latvians, but the Polish\nliaison officer has no help. So what are you doing here? And so I got out and started\nworking for them. And then the UNRRA, the \u2014 the ur \u2014 United Nations Refugee\norganization, the director said to me, what would you have been doing if you were \u2014\nif there hadn\u2019t been no war? And I said oh I\u2019Il be \u2014 probably finish my \u2014 going to the\nuniversity. And he says, well you know what? The UNRRA is paying for education\nof candidates who are coo \u2014 acceptable. Would you like to go to school? And I say,\nyeah, I would like to go to school. But I still stayed in Heilbronn and I would go to\n\u2014 I went to the \u2014 to the ga \u2014 Johns \u2014 to John \u2014 Wolfgang Goethe University in\nFrankfurt. And \u2014 but this going back and forth was just a little bit too much, so I\ngot a room. I was going there for food, because I already had the room. I got a room\nassigned, but I n \u2014 I need f-food.",
        "Q: You had a room assigned in Frankfurt?",
        "A: Yeah, but I had to have food, too, so I was going back and forth to Heilbronn,\ngetting this food. And then somebody in school sa \u2014 I was so sleepy and I said, geez,\nI just hate \u2014",
        "Q: How far was the distance?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Well, I just don\u2019t remember how far, but was quite awhile, because it was \u2014",
        "Q: By train, or bus?",
        "A: By train, by train. And somebody says, well, you don\u2019t have to go, you can join\nour camp, the displaced person camp in Darmstadt or someplace, and we go once a\nweek \u2014 oh yeah, and I belong to a Polish fraternity. And they said, the hola \u2014 we \u2014\none or two people from the fraternity all go every week and they bring the food for\neverybody and then you don\u2019t have to go and take \u2014 do this journey. So that\u2019s why I\nquit this camp in Heilbronn and came to stay in Frankfurt to \u2014 til the time came to\nemigrate.",
        "Q: How did that come about?",
        "A: Well, everybody \u2014 I \u2014 I think it\u2019s the Catholic charities \u2014 no, Catholic refugee \u2014\nCatholic \u2014",
        "Q: Relief services?",
        "A: Relief. That\u2019s where yo-you signed up and they were looking for places for you.\nAnd I got this sponsor, and I was a domestic. Because that was the fa \u2014 the people\nwho said they were from Wellesley, Wellesley hills. And somebody said, oh, there\u2019s\nthis famous school in Wellesley. And then \u2014 there is absolutely no way for me to\nWellesley on my domestic salary and besides, no time. And [indecipherable] is\nthinking of going to school, and I get this letter from my old friends from Saint\nFebruary 2, 2001\nLouis and they all go to school and this and that and they say, well, why don\u2019t you\ncome to Saint Louis, maybe you can get a job here and \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, wa-wait a minute, let\u2019s back up a little bit. So you\u2019re in Germany and the\nCatholic Relief Services arranges for you to go to the United States.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And when did you leave?",
        "A: Oh, I think it was 1950.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Was ni\u2014 was June, I think, 1950 [indecipherable] June.",
        "Q: So you are almost 26 by now, 26 years old?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When you were in Frankfurt, what were you studying?",
        "A: Oh, I really stu \u2014 I want to have medicine, because in the camps everybody said\nonly mechanics and doctors stay alive. But since I kept fainting when I smelled this\nformaldehyde, the doctor said you\u2019re not \u2014 you\u2019ll never make it in medicine, go into\nphilology or something like that. And so I went to study rome \u2014 romance languages.",
        "Q: In \u20141in Frankfurt.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And did you help out any of the chaplains in \u2014 in the DP camps?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that was before there, that was \u2014 that was right after the liberation.\n100\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: What \u2014 what did you do then?",
        "A: Oh, I just went with them from lo \u2014 to \u2014 right after the liberation there was still\nsome of the Nordhauser(ph) \u2014 Nordhauser(ph) concentration camp inmates living,\nbut they were sick and they were dying, so the chaplain said to go and talk to them,\ngive them the last unction, or whatever.",
        "Q: What was your ra \u2014 role?",
        "A: I was just translating. And so that\u2019s what I was doing. And I really liked that\nwork, to tell you the truth.",
        "Q: Why \u2014 why did you like it?",
        "A: Well, because we\u2019re helping people and just \u2014 it was \u2014 was really \u2014 it was really\nso touching, where these dying almost people would grab the soldiers hands, you\nknow. And they were dying even more than did before because the soldiers were\ngiving them candy and stuff like that, and here was somebody who didn\u2019t eat for 10\ndays, and you can imagine what happens. And then they\u2019re \u2014 they were not allowed\nto give them anything. But just to see them there, you know, and being able to shake\nthe liberators hand, it was so touching and those poor kids didn't know what to do\nand they got kissed on their hands, and it was \u2014 it was just \u2014 it was hard to describe\nthe feeling that\u2019s \u2014 that you had. A-And how it was glorious 1n a way and it was so\nsad in the other. And \u2014 but then the Americans took the ones who were still alive to\ndifferent houses and hospitals and all that, so the ones got saved. But there was not\nFebruary 2, 2001\nmuch to be done to the dying ones except to give them a benediction and that\u2019s it.\nThere must have been Jewish prisoners too, because there were rabbis still. I mean,\nthere were a chaplain \u2014 I mean, what do they call them, rabbi chaplains? Mosaic\nfaith. Mosaic [indecipherable]. Yeah, because I remember a couple of times you\nknow, they would \u2014 they all had some things that they would rec \u2014 be recognized,\nyou know. And they were just looking at the prisoners and just shake their hands, so\nthere must have been Jewish prisoners too.",
        "Q: This was in Dora?",
        "A: No, that was already in Nordhausen.",
        "Q: In Nordhausen.",
        "A: Nordhausen, cause Nordhausen considers \u2014 Nordhausen was considered \u2014 they\n\u2014 they call it vacationland, but what they did, out of Dora they sent the prisoners\nwho were dying, cause they didn\u2019t have enough room there, so they would send\nthem to Nordhausen Boelcke Kaserne where they just drop them there and wait til\nthey die. And they were na \u2014 they were not counting the dead, they were counting\nthe living. And that\u2019s how the Americans came in, na \u2014 alls you see is this row of\ndead people, you know, because that\u2019s how the \u2014 1n this German order they always\nlined them up very nicely, and so that\u2019s when the German \u2014 when the Americans\ncame and saw it.",
        "Q: And you saw this ba \u2014 Kaserne?\n102February 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I did see it. But that was already after the Americans came, when \u2014\nwhen the Americans came, when they started. The first thing that told me about \u2014\nwho told me shi \u2014 this Mr. Ratzfeldt(ph) came back and he was awfully \u2014 and I say,\nwhat\u2019s happening to him? And I said to Gisela(ph), why don\u2019t you go and see what\nhappening in this Boelcke Kaserne in Nordhausen. And she told me, well, there\u2019s\nnothing happens, they\u2019re not counting the dead, they\u2019re counting the living, cause\nthey have these rows of \u2014 of dead people lined up. And that\u2019s what \u2014 she says, that\u2019s\nwhat he saw. And of course, somebody\u2019s gonna have to pay for it. So that\u2019s how \u2014",
        "Q: And so you, you yourself went with the chaplains to these \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 to this Kaserne. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, wherever were the \u2014 the ones who were still alive. But I wasn\u2019t going to\nsay that I have no foreign languages, you know, but then I said \u2014 I remember the last\ntime I li-lied, I said dear God, forgive me all the lies and bad things I have done. But\nwhen the war is over, I shall not lie \u2014 I shall lie no more, steal no more or deceive\nanyone. And then when the \u2014 oh yeah, and while I was liberated I see this man with\nall these five suitcases on him. And he was the dentist, a friend of the sa \u2014\nRatzfeldt(ph). And he used \u2014 and he had my \u2014 he healed my tooth. And he said to\nme, now if it still hurts, come the next day because I am leaving. And ho \u2014 he left\nand he comes back and I say, I help you. And I hardly could lift what he was\n103February 2, 2001\ncarrying, is all this stuff that he used, false teeth and all. And I get to his house and\nthere\u2019s Americans standing in front of it, and he says raus krauts and all that. And I\nsay, 1s there anybody who speaks Polish, but the \u2014 no, is there anybody who speaks\nFrench? And they say yeah, there\u2019s \u2014 and he says, voulez vous coucher avec moi?\nAnd I say, and I don\u2019t want that kind of French, I want somebody who I can tell him.\nAnd then comes \u2014 they call up this Polish guy \u2014 I mean, Polish American. And said,\nwhat do you do with this kraut? And I said, this is a dentist who is a very good\n[indecipherable] slave to \u2014 we didn\u2019t call our slave laborers then \u2014 to everybody,\nvery fine workers and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and all she wants to do is put his tools\ndownstairs. And he says no, this is a headquarters, cause there were few houses there\nwere still standing. We don\u2019t want that. And I say, but he was such a good man and\nall that. So anyhow, so he call the sergeant or somebody else, and he says, now look\nin his junk. So he look in his thing, and he says okay, you can tell him he can get that\n\u2014 put that downstairs. And then get out of here. So he put down his dentistry stuff.\nAnd he says, and precisely who are you? You a kraut too? And I said no, I am\nPolish. He says, well, show me a\u2014 show me a I.D., and I say, I don\u2019t have any. How\ndo we know? You could be a kraut hiding, pretending you are Polish. And the\ndentist says, oh I know, in my office there is a \u2014 I have an index card and it tells\nthere, you know, a nationality. Well, the guy says to me, well next time, don\u2019t go\nanyplace without an I.D. And I said, where I\u2019m going to get any? And that\u2019s when\n104February 2, 2001\nhe said, well, there\u2019s gonna be a camp in Dora for all slave laborers and I have to go\nthere and get an I.D. That\u2019s how it happened then.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: And that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So then, skipping forward to 1950, y-you had these arrangements made for you to\ngo to \u2014",

And I go down,\nit\u2019s the last floor.

But he didn\u2019t say cook in a kitchen, he said wash\nthe toilets. And that\u2019s how I start and I later married this guy, but anyhow, that\u2019s\nhow I got here, on this Blatchworth(ph).

And I was doing\nnothing, but he would bring me this apple and this black coffee.

And here I come to this\nhouse, when I take this job away from this \u2014 oh, so she was old and she could have\nre \u2014 she said she was happy to retire now. But this whole idea, you know, that I\nreally didn\u2019t feel \u2014 after awhile, of course I came to myself, you know, I went\nstraight and I slept, I don\u2019t know, I think 12 hours after that, I \u2014 but I had to start\nworking again, so it wasn\u2019t \u2014 I didn't realize really that I was here til \u2014 til I started\ngoing to school in Saint Louis, and then we \u2014 1n school we were together, we were\ntalking about democracy and all that in this history class, and we were at some Swiss\n115February 2, 2001\n\u2014 we had some students from Switzerland and they said, oh there\u2019s no democracy in\nAmerica, you d \u2014 you treat the blacks like dirt, and all that kind of stuff, and I said,\nwell it\u2019s easy for you to say because you don\u2019t have any \u2014 you don\u2019t have your \u2014\nyou\u2019re foreigners. And well, to tell you the truth, isn\u2019t polical \u2014 socially it wasn\u2019t\nwhat I expected.

And before we go on about your experiences in the United States, I just\nwanted to ask you another question about the DP camps. Did you have any contact\nwith Jewish survivors, and if so did you feel any connection to them, or did you see\nany difference?",
        "A: There were absolutely no Jewish D \u2014 displaced persons because they were in a\nseparate camp. And so \u2014 but I knew some friends that once in awhile I would meet,\nbut they were just in different locations and ju \u2014 only once in awhile I would see\nthem, they would come and visit, but that was [indecipherable] or I go and visit.\nBut otherwise we had no \u2014 since we all had to have passes to leave the camp, you\ncouldn\u2019t leave the camp without the pass and all that, and you have to prove why\nyou have to go and all this sort of thing. And I always lied and I said, well, I have to\nsee family, I found somebody, and all that kind of stuff. But otherwise you just\nwouldn\u2019t get the pass. So I \u2014 it was difficult really to \u2014 to \u2014 to go by train or anyplace\nlike that. It was easy, it was like another camp except that it was so called free camp,\nbut it was also very limited. Course you weren\u2019t afraid somebody is gonna shoot\nyou, but I mean, 1-1t \u2014 1t was a difficult life. It was a li \u2014 it was a \u2014 it was like in\nEgypt waiting for getting out into the free land.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: To the promised land. But when you did see those few Jewish survivors, did \u2014 di\n\u2014 could you tell the difference between the Jewish survivors and the non-Jewish\nsurvivors?",
        "A: Well, I never could tell the difference between Jewish people anyhow. I mean,\nyeah, I lived with them and they didn\u2019t look like any difference to me. Of course I\nknew that her father use \u2014 had long beard and [indecipherable] all that and that \u2014\nyou know, like Hasidic Jews. But young people I could never tell the difference,\ncause especially in school we were all in uniforms. And you couldn\u2019t tell, I mean it\u2019s\njust absolutely unpossible for me to tell the difference.",
        "Q: Now let\u2019s move ahead. You said you came to the United States in 1950 and you\ndid say what you were doing in those years from 1945 to 1950, we went through that\nalready. But did you try to get out earlier? Why did you, in a sense, wait until 1950?\nWas that the first time you were allowed to leave?",
        "A: No, I \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that was the first occasion and I wouldn\u2019t have even gotten out\nbecause while I was the \u2014 after the war I worked for a friend, rather a boyfriend of\nmy aunt was working for the Polish consulate in Frankfurt am Main when I was\nworking to school, and somehow I met him on the concert, and we were \u2014 were\ncoming down from some concert and there was this queen of Holland or Belgium, I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t remember which one, and she\u2019s the \u2014 was the woman with this fat legs\nand we were laughing at, saying that\u2019s she got a piano legs. And there was a bunch\n118February 2, 2001\nof Polish officers walking behind us. And they say oh, you Poles. And I say, yeah,\nyou too. And we look at them, and see if they have a s \u2014 a Polish communist signs,\nor the Polish London signs, cause you can tell. And one of them asked, where are\nyou from? And I said, \u2019'm from Krakow. And he said, oh I know Krakow very\nwell, this captain said, I had a girlfriend there. And he turned out to be my aunt. And\nthen we were starting talking, he said, oh you speak languages? And I said oh yeah, I\nstudy languages. And he said oh, could you work for me a couple hours? I don\u2019t \u2014 I\nneed somebody to translate and write German letters. And I said okay, but I was\nfoolish, because you see, I was in the London supported fraternity and I was an anti-\ncommunist so to say, and all of a sudden \u2014 but I did this because he was my friend \u2014\nmy aunt\u2019s boyfriend. And then he was in a car accident, was killed. So after he was\nkilled, this Judge Shanteski(ph) who took over the legal department says oh my\nGod, he left me with so many \u2014 so many letters, correspondence that I \u2014 could you\nwork for me? So I says, but I go to school, and I cannot give you much time, but just\nmaybe a few hours. And so he \u2014 I did work, and of course when the time came \u2014 by\nthe time I got this certificate I have to come to the immigration office, and so when\nthey learned that I working for a consulate and for the Polish Trade and Commerce\nlater on, well somebody told me, don\u2019t work for the consulate because they might\ntake you back to Poland or persecute your family if you don\u2019t go back, and they\nswitched me to this new office, commerce and trade representative\u2019s office. And I\n119February 2, 2001\nwas there and I really stopped going to school because he had so much work, so Is \u2014\ninterrupted my studies. And the meantime I got my papers to come to the\nimmigration office. Well, when they \u2014 but I did have some friends who were\nAmericans, and also military personnel, and I \u2014 I went with them, or rather they went\nwith me to this office. And of course there is this group of people sitting and asking\nme, did you get paid for the \u2014 no, this man, this captain says, but she work for the\nAmericans, she work for the CIC. No, it was called different in those days, 1t wasn\u2019t\nCIC, it was this something intelligence service. And they ask me, oh did you \u2014 oh\nyeah, and this friend of mine said ma \u2014 re-remember that when she has to go to the\nStates that you vouch for her that she work for the Americans. And so he says well \u2014\njust then somebody who was asking me says, well did you get money for it? And I\nsaid, why should I have gotten money for it? I mean, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t like the Soviets and\nI didn\u2019t like the Polish government, and that was it. And that\u2019s \u2014 I didn\u2019t do anything\noutrageous, all I did is translated stuff. And \u2014 but I almost got rejected for the\nemigration, but then all of a sudden I got this call and this lady says there\u2019s\nsomebody wanting to talk to you. And I said, who on earth can it be? Ba \u2014 she didn't\nunderstand the name. It turned out to be the boss of this intelligence service, who\nsays, don\u2019t worry, your papers have been cleared. And he said, you work for us and I\njust \u2014 only by chance did he come across my papers. And he says, I just by chance\ngot to your files and I saw this rejection and I \u2014 and he says, you\u2019re all cleared up\n120February 2, 2001\nnow. So I was all cleared up and the people at Wellesley had to wait for me like six\nmonths, because I was supposed to come and all of a sudden I was stopped and now\nI\u2019m going again, so \u2014 any \u2014 like they say, alls well that ends well.",

        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: \u2014 had this, mostly their hats. And \u2014",
        "Q: And the communists had a different symbol?",
        "A: They had their \u2014 they had the eagle without a crown.",
        "Q: Oh. Tell me a little bit about the fa \u2014 okay, now we\u2019re back into Wellesley. Tell\nme a little bit about the family that you stayed with.",
        "A: Well, the family owned a department store in Waltham, it was one of those\ndepartment stores and there was this invalid father, the mother, and that was all.\nThey had two sons and they had a daughter, they lived in Rhode Island or\nsomeplace like that, but they always \u2014 they would come home to visit the father. One\n121February 2, 2001\nwas a navy man and one was still in college. And the daughter was already married\nin \u2014 I think she was in Rhode Island.",
        "Q: And this was a Catholic family?",
        "A: Was a very Catholic family, yeah, they went to church every blessed satur \u2014\nSunday. I\u2019m still Saturday [indecipherable] Sabbath. And it\u2019s funny, tha \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s where lots of people think I\u2019m Jewish because when I talk, not only do I move\nmy hands, and I say oh. I never said oy vey, or [indecipherable] but anyhow \u2014 so,\ngoing back to the family, and they said to begin with that if \u2014 that if I ever wanted to\nleave to go to school that I can do it. And of course later on I had the letter from her\nthat I s-s \u2014 they wished I would have stayed until the father died, because he really\nmissed me. But I got the letter from this friend of mine, and she says, well, come and\nyou stay with us and I\u2019m already going to school and I\u2019m working and all this, in\nSaint Louis. And so I can get you a job in our firm.",
        "Q: So how long were you in Massachusetts?",
        "A: Were in Massachusetts? Not very long. Must have been May \u2014 I think about six\nmonths, that was about all.",
        "Q: When you first came here, did you feel very much like a foreigner, did you feel\nthe people looked at you differently in those first six months?",
        "A: No, because maybe they did look at me differently, but I have this facility to get\nadjusted to any country I\u2019m in. My father always says, you have this talents to adapt,\n122February 2, 2001\nor to whatever \u2014 to \u2014 to find a replace \u2014 to me, really ever \u2014 wherever there were\npeople and good people, that was the world to me, I never felt \u2014 course, my English\nwas horrible to begin with, but \u2014 but if I did \u2014",
        "Q: But you fe \u2014 you felt respected?",
        "A: Y-Yeah. I mean, if I didn\u2019t open my mouth, nobody knew I was a foreigner, was\na well-dressed, and the lady always send me to a hairdresser in her department store.",
        "Q: Did you feel safe here?",
        "A: Yeah, fairly safe. I know nobody\u2019s gonna touch me or anything like that. The\nonly unsafe thing was going to the street with all those cars. But otherwise I \u2014 but I\nwanted to go to school, that was my aim, and it was no \u2014 Wellesley College was so\nexpensive and I, with my house-help salary, there was absolutely no way I could,\nand no time to go to school. Had no idea how important \u2014 how great Wellesley hills\nwas, everybody was talking about Wellesley College, and I [indecipherable]\ncollege. I was very well prepared because European schools, hi-high schools really,\nyou like in a junior hi \u2014 like a yunior college. I mean, I knew more than did junior\ncollege kids, because they have better schools, ca \u2014 for the simple reason that they\ndon\u2019t take anybody, they \u2014 you have to pass tests to be accepted, to show that you\u2019re\ncapable of \u2014 of working the material. So \u2014 but I never felt strange. I maybe looked\nstrange to them, but \u2014",
        "Q: Now, you\u2019re 26 years old now.\n123February 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah. And I go to Saint Louis and go to school there, and I \u2014",
        "Q: And where did you live? With a family?",
        "A: I lived with this family in this \u2014 sleeping on a cot and all that. And \u2014 but the\nschool was way \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 oh yes, and the girls said, you know, they said\nthere\u2019s a Polish invasion in the \u2014 1-in this match \u2014 Universal Match Company. A\nbunch of foreigners getting work and all that. And you know, it\u2019d be better if you\ndidn\u2019t work here, because it\u2019s gonna be bad for me, too. So there I was, and that was\nat noon and we always went to the YMCA to eat. And I was crying all the way and\nthere was a blonde woman sitting there and she says, what is she crying about? And\nshe knew this girl. And she says, ah, because she just lost her work. And she \u2014 this\nwoman says something \u2014 somehow it ca \u2014 wa \u2014 came to tell me, she says oh, she can\ncome and stay with us, and we\u2019re gonna look for a job for her. Because the office \u2014\nnot the office, but the universal \u2014 the office of the Universal Match Company, the\nheadquarters is really n-near where we live. And so I went to live with them, was the\nfamily of a mother and three sisters. One sister, the one that \u2014 Blondie, or Bonnie,\nwho took me in, and two sisters from the other father. And it turned out \u2014 she later\ntold me that she only \u2014 oh yeah, the sister said, oh she only took her in so there\nwould be two against two, because they were always quarreling about who 1s a better\nperson in this family. But anyhow, they took me to this office in Ferguson and the \u2014\nto this Universal Match Company and the director of whoever the personnel office\n124February 2, 2001\nis. Oh sorry, but we don\u2019t have any work for her. And I started crying and I said,\ngosh, after all this. I don\u2019t know, somehow I mentioned the word camps. The minute\nI said the word camps, the guy woke up and he says, what camps? And of course the\ndirectors were all Jewish, to say the tra \u2014 to say the least. And he says, what camp?\nAnd I says, through the tears and I said, well this and that and all that. And he tooks\n\u2014 picks up the telephone and he calls up the office of the Universal Match Company\nin Saint Louis and he says, I need that work for a person that you just let go. She\u2019s a\ntypist. And, do you take shorthand? And I say yeah, a little bit, but not very \u2014 yeah, I\nknew Polish and German shorthand, so I always took notes in German shorthand,\nbut \u2014 anyhow, so \u2014 and I was so lucky that next to \u2014 across the street from the girls\nwhere I lived, lived one of the personnel \u2014 one of \u2014 somebody there lived who also\nworked in Universal Match Company, so he would take me home and bring me\nback. You have to get up five o\u2019clock because it was far away from this \u2014 yeah, ferg\n\u2014 was called Ferguson, | think. And so, I started working and I start first time on an\nelectric typewriter. And I was used to this regular typewriter. So I \u2014 I hit this type \u2014 I\nmean, you know, I hit this thing and somebody says, thanks God this \u2014 it\u2019s look as if\nthis typewriter was gonna float \u2014 fly out through the window. But somebody says\nthanks God sh \u2014 she \u2014 the windows were closed because otherwise I don\u2019t know\nwhat would happen. You know, I was at seventh or eighth floor, or tenth, I don\u2019t\nknow. But anyhow, ni \u2014 so I worked there, and I stayed with the girls, but since I\n125February 2, 2001\nwas starting going to school, it was so difficult for me because I had after cl \u2014 after\nwork I went to school, to night school at Washington U. And I\u2019m just coming home,\nI was asleep and I was holding onto this strap in a bus and the ba \u2014 guy would say,\nsleeping beauty, time to get up, you arrived. And so I said I got to look for another\nplace to live. So I was looking and I was going through this Washington Street, I\nthink, and every place it says for rent, for rent, and it \u2014 then I see this one it says for\nrent, for rent, and it was just cl \u2014 you know, in the middle between work and school.\nBut it says, no women wanted or somethi \u2014 only from \u2014 only for men. I don\u2019t\nremember the wording on this thing. And so, as I pass by, the two old ladies were\nsitting on a porch and I look at the sign and I pass by. And one of them gets up and\nshe says, aren\u2019t you gonna come in? And I say, why I\u2019m a woman, I can\u2019t come in.\nAnd I was dressed up, you know, to kill. And so what are you looking for? And I\nsay, well, I\u2019m looking for a place, because I live in Ferguson, it\u2019s too far for me to\nschool, between work and school. She says, well, why don\u2019t you look at the room?\nSo, take me up. She took me upstairs and I went upstairs and this and that and I said,\nwell how about cooking facilities? And she says, well, we don\u2019t let anybody cook,\nbut if you promise that you never leave any dirty dishes and that you \u2014 and we give\nyou a little place. She evidently liked me, okay? And so I stayed with them. I stayed\nwith them until I got married.",
        "Q: Now, did you have any correspondence with your family back in Poland?\n126February 2, 2001",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yes, yes, we corresponded all the time. My father said, as a matter of\nfact, don\u2019t come to Poland, there\u2019s no future for you there.",
        "Q: So they were happy that you were in \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 in the United States?",
        "A: Especially since I qu-quit the \u2014 since I quit this Polish consulate, you know, cause\nthis was just too much Soviet [indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff. Our consul\ngot arrested. [indecipherable] his wife got arre \u2014 he \u2014 how was it? He had to send\nhis own wife back to Warsaw because before she was married to this consul,\nZambritski(ph) I think was his name, she was married to another guy and the guy\nwas in the Polish underground army. And so he said \u2014 has to send her back. And\neverybody was saying how could you \u2014 could he do that? And I say, well he did,\ncause otherwise he would have to go too. But anyhow, everybody was afraid. And\nthere is this \u2014 my stepfather needed a new radio, he says oh, my old radio doesn\u2019t\nwork. I say oh, I have a beautiful radio, I give you one, so on. And there was a\ncashier from the consulate that was going to Poland and he says, oh, I can take the\nradio and deliver. Oh here, take the radio. And then I hear from my boss\n[indecipherable] she said, you know what happen at the frontier? On the border,\nPolish Czech border or something, the guy was stopped, his ra \u2014 his car was check,\nthe radio was taken apart and there he was let go. Then he comes and visits my\n127February 2, 2001\nmother and stepfather and he brings this radio and he says he\u2019s got to go someplace.\nAnd so my stepfather says oh, Ill take you there, I know where it is, you don\u2019t have\nto \u2014 was in the evening, so you don\u2019t have to wander through Krakow. The minute\nthey stepped out of the house they were arrested. And \u2014 yeah, and then every \u2014 it\nturn out that every place that this guy went, people were arrested because they were\nsaying that a con \u2014 Polish consulate in Frankfurt was an American spy\nheadquarters. See, everybody that had anything to do with that, I don\u2019t know if we\ncould have been a spy there, except maybe for me, I mean I \u2014 which I wasn't even a\nspy, you know. All I did was \u2014 most of my work there for them was to \u2014 to go with\nthem and trans \u2014 translate things for them, you know. But anyhow, so he and my\nmother never forgotten \u2014 has forgiven me for \u2014 because when he came back he had\nemphysema. They say \u2014 I\u2019m not even sure now, but it says he was put in a \u2014 that\u2019s\nhow they would get the truth out of you, they would put you in water and they would\nfreeze it and they let you out and all that. Anyhow that\u2019s what he was telling, and\nthat\u2019s probably a true [indecipherable]. And \u2014",
        "Q: So they ar \u2014 they arrested him and put him in prison?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: For how long?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember for how long, but both \u2014 he was freed every \u2014 cause they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 after \u2014 but when he got out he was just not a man any more, he was just a\n128February 2, 2001\npiece of [indecipherable] that was old and in \u2014 so and he died from this\nemphysema. And of course if 1t hadn\u2019t been for my radio, he would never been\nwhere he was. And so \u2014 so then \u2014",
        "Q: So then we\u2019re \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, so I was told \u2014 somebody says to me, I don\u2019t know how it was said, but\nI really \u2014 I really stopped \u2014 stopped working there for \u2014 for this consulate and I went\nback to school and then the papers come and then the guy says, you\u2019re all clear to go\nto the United States and I went to Bremen and \u2014 and Bremenhaven(ph) and on\nBlatchford and back, I mean in \u2014 to America. On the borg \u2014 on the ship that \u2014 that\nthe marines \u2014 course it\u2019s really, the ship was run by the navy, but it was worked by\nthe people, and that\u2019s how I met my husband there. But anyhow they were saying, oh\nthere comes this bunch of foreigners who are gonna take our jobs. So it wasn\u2019t very\n\u2014 so, I got the bad preparation, I expected worse things America and I didn\u2019t see any\nbad things, so \u2014",
        "Q: So you kept up a correspondence with your future husband after you got off the\nboat? Cause you said you\u2019re now in Saint Louis, and \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and I had this other friend with whom I \u2014 whom I known because of my\nwork and \u2014 and we always \u2014 but this \u2014 this navy \u2014 the \u2014 the sailor kept wri-writing to\nme. And comes Christmas time and I say to one of the girls, how do you say a\nChristmas card, and what do you say on a Christmas card? And they all say, dear\n129February 2, 2001\nCharles, and so I wrote dear Charles, but by mistake I have sent this letter to the\nfellow in Chicago. He comes in, you know, what is this? What\u2019s this with Charles?\nAnd I say well \u2014 what\u2019s her name [indecipherable] or something says, well that\u2019s\nhow you write to people, but what do you have to do with him? And I said, the guy\nwas nice, he saved me from being seasick and I work in his cabin, and \u2014 what cabin?\nAnd I said, well, there are 260 people and all that. But anyhow, all he \u2014 and so we\nbroke off. And I send this card to Charles Belfoure and I said, this card cost me my\nboyfriend. And Charles says, that\u2019s good, because then I can be your boyfriend.\nThis is how we got together. And that was a big mis \u2014 bad mistake too, but you make\nmistakes without knowing, you marry somebody without knowing his background,\nanything like that, I mean the \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but he was charming.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what \u2014 when did you get married?",
        "A: When? \u00b053 or something like that.",
        "Q: And the \u2014 so you stayed in Saint Louis for three years?",
        "A: I stayed, yeah, and then we \u2014 and when we got married we went to Milwaukee,\nthe Great Lakes where the navy station was.",
        "Q: Wa-Was he in Saint Louis doing \u2014 during that time?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, he was in \u2014 he was in Great Lakes in the navy, he was just\ncoming, yeah. And he was a good mathematician really, because the vise \u2014 we\nwould meet in New York, and \u2014 because he was coming from the ship. And I said I\n130February 2, 2001\ncan\u2019t come because I have a math exam. He says, oh I can help you and all that. So I\nthought he was a really university person, which he was not. And to me, educated\nperson was \u2014 I mean, I just \u2014 I know from experience from other people that\nmismatched educationally people never get along. And so \u2014 well, I\u2014 I made a\nchoice, and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: And so then in \u2014 you got married in \u00b053 and where did you live?",
        "A: Then we went \u2014 then he wanted to \u2014 his mother got sick and her \u2014 his mother live\nin Cumberland, Maryland, that\u2019s where his family live. And so we moved to\nCumberland, Maryland and he got to work for the navy \u2014 naval reserves office\nthere. He was a petty officer, and \u2014 but he was always typing. And so we worked\nthere \u2014 I mean he worked there and I lived there in a very small apartment. And all I\nwas dreaming about is going back to school. And next to Cumberland was\nFrostburg, which is a uni \u2014 was a college town at that time. And I don\u2019t know, I had\nsome neighbors nex \u2014 next door, very wealthy people. And one time I got to know\nthem and the man says, all dressed up and no place to go. I was waiting for my\nhusband to pick me up someplace, and we started talking and then they invited me\nand my husband, and he would never come, because I said, why don\u2019t you want to\ncome? And he said oh, because those are millionaires. And I said, millionaires are\npeople too, big deal. But that\u2019s where he wouldn\u2019t go because they were not his \u2014 he\n\u2014 he has nothing to show up. And anyhow, so these people kept saying, why don\u2019t\n131February 2, 2001\nyou just go back to college? And so I went and I got accepted and I had some credits\nfrom Washington U., except they were not all acc \u2014 accepted in Frostburg because\nthey have their own standards and all that. And since I signed up that I will teach two\nyears after graduation, I didn\u2019t have to pay tuition, all I had to pay is like student\u2019s\ndues and all that. And I think one of my brothers will always give me \u2014 without\nname \u2014 naming he \u2014 without saying his name, he always give me like a gift for me\nfor 45 dollars or something, so \u2014 specially since they saw me on the Dean\u2019s list and\nthey were proud of me and all that. And my husband hated it, but anyhow. And then\n\u2014 and then one day, the marriage ended and there was this little boy. And this little\nboy is now 46 years old and he is an architect, but he still 1s sore at me that he didn\u2019t\nlive with a father and mother and all that kind of stuff. I could \u2014 just couldn\u2019t live\nwith a man who made a kid with somebody else, I just couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t take it off,\ncause even if I was a real Christian I would have forgiven him because I pray every\nday, I say forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. But,\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not an easy thing to do. And I wanted to go to school, I knew that\nif I stayed with him, there was no way for me to finish school. And he also said to\nthe chaplains [indecipherable] we were so happy, but \u2014 until she started wanting to\ngo to school. So that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So then \u2014\n132February 2, 2001",
        "A: So then after I graduated, and since I gradu \u2014 had some more credits or I\ngraduated bef \u2014 oh yeah, before I even graduated I started going to graduate school\nin Middlebury, Vermont. And my son, I put my son in a Catholic camp in summer\non this, some kind of lakes in Lawrence, or something. And he went to camp and I\nwent to school. And so then when I was graduating from Frostburg State I already\nhad credits \u2014 some credits from the graduate school. And then co \u2014 I continue and I\ngot \u2014 oh yeah, before I even \u2014 before I even \u2014 I really never made an application for\na job because one of my chemistry teachers \u2014 professor, one time I got a 65 and so I\nwent to him and I said, how come I only got 65? He says, because you didn\u2019t know\nanything. And he says to me \u2014 then he explains to me how I should study chemistry\nand all this, says if it\u2019s water [indecipherable] cascading water in the sea, you think\nabout it what\u2019s in it chemicals and all that, what it can do, temperatures. And he says\nto me, well, not everybody be \u2014 could be a genius or Copernicus. And I said, do you\nknow that Copernicus was Polish? He didn\u2019t even know that Copernicus was\nPolish. But anyhow, he says not everybody can be Copernicus. When I was\nstudying German, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I was such \u2014 such a bad student, I couldn\u2019t understand\nthe difference when to say this and that. And I said, oh that\u2019s very easy, I can explain\nit to you. If you\u2019re going to it, it\u2019s accusative [indecipherable] are in there, it\u2019s a\nquestion of the in. And if you\u2019re there, then you use the [indecipherable]. Well, that\nwas my certificate for being a good teacher. Because one time I was going through a\n133February 2, 2001\nhall and his office was open and he had three men in it and he says, oh, there goes a\nte \u2014 there goes somebody who can teach anybody. And those people were the\nBaltimore county recruiters for teachers.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kristina Belfoure. This is tape number four,\nside B. And you were talking about the recruiters, who happened to be in the office\nat the time.",
        "A: The office and they \u2014 they said, you have a \u2014 you have a job in Baltimore county.\nNow it\u2019s a question of what school. And I have \u2014 I have \u2014 Janet Levin was a very\ngood friend. Her husband used to be a rabbi, but he stopped being a rabbi and\nbecome a lawyer, and they moved to Baltimore. And they said, why don\u2019t you come\nand si\u2014 you know, we\u2019re such a good friends, you know, that to stay, and we can be\nfriends. [indecipherable] big friends but we can \u2014 you can be with us and all that\nand your son can have a home like he used to have. Because they used to pick us up\non a Friday for Shabbas and I was a \u2014 a Shabbas goy for them, and then they would\ntake us back home on a Sunday. And he ha \u2014 and he had \u2014 they had little children, so\nhe play with them, he was older than they were, but he was this big boss and all this.\nSo he had like a family life. And \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: How \u2014 how old was your son when you and your husband got divorced?",
        "A: We never \u2014 we have never been divorced.",
        "Q: Oh, because you\u2019re Catholic.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And he didn\u2019t want to be divorced because so he wouldn\u2019t have to marry all the\nwomen that he seduced, or they seduced him. But anyhow, so he \u2014 he was four years\nold, four years old. We just stayed together until his mother died, because his mother\n\u2014 he didn't want to make his mother unhappy. And so Janet says, come to\nBaltimore, and I said, well I\u2014 so the question was, where \u2014 what high school to get\nin order to \u2014 since I didn\u2019t drive a car I had to be close by. And so Janet was looking\nfor a school \u2014 for a place to live, and the secretary of the school \u2014 because I finally\ndecided Woodlawn, but as \u2014 I couldn\u2019t take it, because they were \u2014 and somebody\njust \u2014 their teacher got married so 1n the middle of the year, in January they were\nwithout a teacher for four \u2014 French four and five. And so I said I will take the job,\nbut I need a place to live close by so that I can walk to school. And so when they\nwere asking in the \u2014 all those places that rented apartments, one of them says, oh, I\u2019d\n\u2014 we just rented an apartment in Woodlawn, and she\u2019s also a teacher. And the\nsecretary says, her name wouldn\u2019t be Belfoure would it? And she says yes, how did\nyou know? And she says, oh [indecipherable] so she \u2014 the \u2014 the director later on\n135\nFebruary 2, 2001\nsaid the principal [indecipherable] she came running into his office and he says, we\nhave a teacher. And so that\u2019s how I \u2014 except that 1t was winter and I was putting my\ntrashcans out and my son opened the door and he says, do I look good in this type?\nCause he was going for the first time to his new school, so he wanted to look good.\nAnd I turned around, but since I didn\u2019t know that \u2014 I didn\u2019t know the \u2014 where I was\nreally standing and I fell down. Thanks God I had this Persian lamb coat on me so I\ndidn\u2019t get all bruised, but my knees were bruised and my face and all that. So my\nfirst day to school I was wearing black gla \u2014 dark glasses and I look really \u2014 I can\nimagine, in winter, to wear dark glasses. But that\u2019s how I started at the school.",
        "Q: And then how long did you remain a teacher?",
        "A: 25 years in the same school. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did you say \u2014 did you get a graduate degree from Middlebury\u201d",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what did you get?",
        "A: French.",
        "Q: A\u2014a master\u2019s degree?",
        "A: Yeah, a master\u2019s degree, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, uh-huh.",
        "A: And of course they said you don\u2019t really need to spend money on German\nmaster\u2019s, because you know German better than the masters. But I \u2014 I-I si\u2014I-\u2014I-\n136February 2, 2001\ntoo bad I didn\u2019t, because I would have gotten more money. Everybody was saying,\nwhy don\u2019t you teach in college? And I said, because it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve been to college, so I\nknow how they teach. You cannot influence anybody, and if you teach younger kids\nin high school, you still \u2014 oh, you still can do something and help them or tell them \u2014\nput them on a straight route, how important education is and all that. Once you\u2019re in\ncollege they don\u2019t care, all they do is listen to you \u2014 to your lecture and put down\nstuff and they repeat to you verbatim, so on.",
        "Q: So you felt very accepted. Did you feel very Polish then, or American?",
        "A: I think I feel very American. I \u2014",
        "Q: Whe-Whe-When did you get your citizenship?",
        "A: When I was still married.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. What was that like for you to become an American citizen?",
        "A: Well, in the first place, 1t were \u2014 in \u2014 1n those days the first thing you did when\nyou got off the boat, you went to the naturalization service to ask for citizenship \u2014 I\nmean, you have to request this thing. And then because I was married to an\nAmerican military, I didn't have to wait seven years, but I think I only had to wait\nfive years or something like that. But then you had to prepare for all those exams and\nmy husband and his fishing friend would stay home and help me with this thing. But\none wa \u2014 my husband was a republican and this other was a democrat and they\nwould quarrel all the time. And so when I went to this, because you have to \u2014 they ca\n137February 2, 2001\n\u2014 asked you to \u2014 the wa \u2014 this \u2014 the lawyer has to present you to the things at this \u2014\nas a person who wants to take the examination. All during the examination they said\nto me, now what do you think of the americ \u2014 of the democrats and the republicans?\nAnd I said, I still wonder how on earth this country be run effectively with all these\nguys quarreling among themself. And the guy, the judge says, no that\u2019s not\nquarreling, that\u2019s disputing. [indecipherable] they disputing or not. And I got it, but\nmy husband never told his mother that I got that citizenship, she had to read it in the\nnewspaper. Cause they took the picture with a \u2014 the senator from Maryland was\nBell, and there was some Italian lady too who \u2014 in a small town, you know,\nsomething like that, to be \u2014 to be a citizen is a big deal, you know, not \u2014 not as in\nother place where you have hundred of them, you know.",
        "Q: What did it mean to you?",
        "A: Well, what shall I say? That I was really proud of the country and I can vote. I\ncouldn\u2019t da \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait til I could vote, I mean, that was my thing, cause you\nhear \u2014 that was Eisenhower at that time and they said, but you are a democrat, and I\nwasn\u2019t a democrat, I was really a republican at that time. And of course Eisenhower\nwas my liberator, so I voted for him. But then \u2014 then when I was in school in\nFrostburg, I had to make extra money after my husband left, and I work in a\nkitchen. And I lived in a house where there was a restaurant dow-downstairs and\nthen we live upstairs. And so it was the easiest work for me because I didn't have to\n138February 2, 2001\nget dressed or anything like that. And I could leave the boy upstairs and the people\nfrom the hotel were watching him. But I didn\u2019t leave him upstairs, I \u2014 really he came\nwith me and he was painting and drawing and sometimes he would fill the\nsaltshakers and all that. And I only stopped working in this restaurant because they\nsaid, be very polite to the customers, but the customers always weren\u2019t \u2014 he says,\nand don\u2019t put the bill on the \u2014 on the table, give it to them \u2014 give it to his hand. Well,\nyou give this to his hand and he holds your hand. He asks you for a date and all that\nkind of stuff. And I said, but you are married, cause you can see. And he says, well,\nthat doesn\u2019t matter. So that\u2019s how I say, oh my gosh, I can\u2019t work like that and then\nstudy and all this. So there was the \u2014 he says, well the only other job he says, to wash\ndishes. And so I went to wash dishes, but my son was always showing \u2014 there\u2019s a\npeephole and he was showing people that his mother is working washing dishes.\nWell \u2014 and well, I wouldn\u2019t have stopped this work except that one day I put my\nchemistry notes al \u2014 on this washing machine, and when I open it, you know, the \u2014\nthe damp, or \u2014",
        "Q: The steam?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: The steam?",
        "A: The steam took the \u2014 took all my notes and so here I da \u2014 that was a lost day for\nme. So then I [indecipherable] these people would say, can\u2019t you get \u2014 you can get\n139February 2, 2001\na job in college, can\u2019t you? And so then I accepted a job in a college. First I worked\nsome kind of thing, some paperwork for a psychology department. Then I was teach\n\u2014 then I was \u2014 1-it was a blind girl who was taking French and I was helping her,\ntaking notes and \u2014 and \u2014 for her and all that. And then \u2014 then I no \u2014 by that time I\ngraduated, and I already had this job waiting for me, so anyways [indecipherable]\n[tape break] Well, anyhow, Janet Levin was \u2014 I met Janet Levin in Cumberland\nand before I met Janet Levin I knew a Jewish family, a furrier\u2019s family that I went\nto visit and \u2014 and I saw the Hanukkah candle and so she says, oh how do you \u2014 I\nsaid, when is Hanukkah? And she said, how do you know about Hanukah? And I\nsaid well, I come from a place that has every fra \u2014 fifth person is a Jew, so you have\nto know about Hanukkah. But anyhow, one day this man says, I got bad news \u2014 bad\nnews for you, I\u2019m losing my sight. And I said, oh you [indecipherable] your\nHebrew, I could read it to you. Cause I was a lady of leisure at that time. And so here\ncomes, I don\u2019t know, next month or something, he says hi, I\u2019ve got the \u2014 I \u2014 I made a\nda \u2014 date with the rabbi and you can learn Hebrew because they giving \u2014 there\u2019s a\nnew rabbi in town and he\u2019s giving cu \u2014 his wife 1s giving classes for beginners. And\nso that\u2019s how I met Janet because I was looking for a rabbi and this \u2014 you know, the\nPolish rabbi with the harvartz(ph) and all that kind of stuff and I didn\u2019t see\nanything, I just saw young men at the door of the shul. And this redhead comes to\nme and says, you waiting for somebody? And I say yes, for the rabbi. Oh, there he 1s.\n140February 2, 2001\nAnd I said, where? And she says there, there, the man at the door, shaking hands\nwith the people. I said, that\u2019s not a rabbi. You sure he\u2019s a rabbi? I ought to know,\nhe\u2019s my husband. That\u2019s how I met Janet and we become very good friends. And it\n\u2014 the deal ended because they left for Israel, the whole family left for Israel and \u2014\nand I got \u2014 I said goodbye at the \u2014 New York, at the si\u2014 ship. But she gave me, as\ninheritance, to her friend Linda Ford, who still lives in Baltimore, and she says,\nnow remember when there\u2019s any holidays, make sure you invite her to your house\nfor holidays. So ever since I\u2019ve been going to this Linda Ford. And before she was\nLinda Ford, she was Linda Polack(ph). And so that comes New Year\u2019s, or Easter, I\nmean I \u2014 I\u2019m always there, as an inheritance. So when she introduces me to other\npeople she says, that\u2019s my inheritance. And so that\u2019s how \u2014",
        "Q: And then \u2014 and then you \u2014 you said you retired after 25 years. And when was that\napproximately, in the late 80\u2019s?",
        "A: It was either \u201989, or se \u2014 80 \u2014 I [indecipherable] \u201988, but I heard on the television\nthat there \u2014 there\u2019s a new office, Red Cross office that looks for translators, cause\nthere\u2019s a new office tracing \u2014 the Holocaust an \u2014 war victims tracing office of the\nRed Cross and is looking for a translator. And since I was al-always a champion for\nthe Red Cross, I was even a president of the Polish Red Cross, had a certain\n[indecipherable] junior Red Cross in my school, so I always thought very highly of\nFebruary 2, 2001\nthe Red Cross, so I jumped to the Red Cross, okay. And I went there and we got a\nlittle schooling what the Red Cross is all about and all that and then we \u2014",
        "Q: This is the Red Cross office in Baltimore?",
        "A: Baltimore, yeah, that\u2019s the central \u2014 this is really a central office for the tracing\nfor Holocaust victims and \u2014 Holocaust war victims. The national searches for\nmilitary and all this, but we do search for Holocaust and war victims. And I started\nworking, but then one day, on the door of the Red Cross, we see an announcement\nby the Holocaust Museum, that the Holocaust Museum is looking for translators.\nAnd so Morris Rosen and I jumped at it and \u2014 course we didn\u2019t know how difficult\nit is to get to Washington from where I lived, and we started working. The museum\nwasn\u2019t open yet, so we worked, I think it\u2019s Eighth Street, or E Street, who \u2014",
        "Q: Tw \u2014 20\" and L. We\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll get to that in a minute. I wanted to talk a little bit\nmore about your Red Cross work first. Wa \u2014 just exactly what did you do at the Red\nCross?",
        "A: Well, I do \u2014 in the very beginning we would get application that f \u2014 somebody is\nlooking for mother, father, brother, whatever it 1s, so there are certain forms,\nspecially the forms \u2014 the forms were different [indecipherable] in every year the\nforms got \u2014 were changed just to \u2014 to make it easier because the \u2014 you get an\napplication from us, and we send this to the international tracing service in Arolsen.\nAnd then they look in the papers and course they have all their lists, and if anybody\n142February 2, 2001\ncan find anybody, it\u2019s supposed to be there. Because there were \u2014 but however it\u2019s\ndifficult because before the Gestapo and the SS left, they burned most of their\nmaterials. So it\u2019s very difficult to \u2014 to really find somebody. You can never find\nnames, for example, of \u2014 right after the war, when Poland lost the war, all the\nJewish synagogues were burned, and po \u2014 Jewish population\u2019s registers was kept by\n\u2014 by the synagogues, the birth and the marriage records and all that. So once the\nsynagogue was burned, that was it. And ben \u2014 then besides, since the Jews never\nlived together with the Poles, or the very few Pole \u2014 Poles knew the Jews and the\nJews knew the Poles. They only knew each other in commercial situations, but not\nthat I could go \u2014 some \u2014 somebody could swear yeah, I know this \u2014 this Jew came\nfrom this and this place, or this. So we can\u2019t really find anybody like that. Besides,\nwhat they did sometimes, they got this whole Jewish population on the side of some\nriver or something and shot them, or whatever it was. And in the very beginning it\nwas like that. And \u2014 course they didn\u2019t use them for work like they did later, they\njust got smarter [indecipherable] smarter in quotation marks. And so it\u2019s \u2014 so we\nwere looking for these people, but it\u2019s very difficult to find it, especially women. But\nseems like men, who were then put to work, were easier to trace, whereas women\nand children were shot before they were even put to work or anything like that, so \u2014\nso what we did, we would just write out the names and professions and where they\nwere born and all that, and you think possible that could facilitate the finding.\n143February 2, 2001",
        "Q: So you \u2014",
        "A: And this ki \u2014 since that was also \u2014 we had to write this in German because we\ndidn\u2019t want to \u2014 otherwise they would have to have somebody in Germany translate\nfrom \u2014 so \u2014 and then their Holocaust tracing went to Germany and they kind of set\nup special forms so that they were easy to read and now they have databa \u2014 base, so\nit\u2019s much easier too, to find, but of course now it\u2019s 50 years. But believe me on that,\nthey still people who 60 or 50 years after, look for their mother or father. I say they\ncouldn\u2019t have done that a little bit early? But maybe they thought they didn\u2019t\nsurvive, so they had giving up. And now they find out that after so many years some\ncousin meets another cousin and so \u2014 and it\u2019s mostly the grandchildren, or\ngrandchildrens, who want to know where the fathers \u2014 grandfathers or grandmother\ndied, or where they come from and all this, so \u2014",
        "Q: These are Jewish and non-Jewish survivors?",
        "A: Yeah. Well now, there are no more non-Jewish survivors, but \u2014 but the families\nof the Jewish survivors.",
        "Q: I\u2014I meant for families of Jewish and non-Jewish.",
        "A: Yes. A-And then \u2014 now it\u2019s \u2014 since the Polish slave laborers came to this age that\nthey need some kind of documents that there was slave laborers, now we are looking\nfor those, too. And \u2014",
        "Q: So you are still working for the Red Cross?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And how much time do you devote to it?",
        "A: Ah, the Thursday and sometime I\u2019Il take home p-papers home if I don\u2019t finish,\nbut most likely I just work on a Thursday.",
        "Q: So wa \u2014 do you \u2014 do y \u2014",
        "A: What we\u2019re doing right now is in order to facilitate this with the Polish Red\nCross, we develop forms that we translate the applications into Polish. So then that\ntakes less time in Poland, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m practically doing. And once they put in\na base, or database, I translate it in Polish so then they can be sent to Poland and\ntaken care of by the Polish Red Cross without the people knowing English. So that\u2019s\nmy work there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you find that rewarding work?",
        "A: Oh yes, in the first place, here I doing something, maybe you bring some kind of\nclosure or something, and besides, I like translating and I like Red Cross, so the all\nthree things goes together.",
        "Q: At the end of the war, when you were still in Europe and word came out of the ta\n\u2014 what truly happened to many of the victims, which I assume you didn\u2019t know\nduring the war time, do you \u2014 can you describe what some of your thoughts were\nwhen you saw pictures from the camps, from Auschwitz?\n145February 2, 2001",
        "A: You know, I cannot say it over and over again that I could not understand how a\ncultured nation could come so low to kill innocent people. That \u2014 this was my \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, and then there was my own guilt that I didn\u2019t do more. So \u2014",
        "Q: What could you have done more?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I had \u2014 I could have maybe help hiding more people. Maybe \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, I just still feel that I have not done enough, and I could have done,\nbecause I had this \u2014 thi-this uncle who was doing it and I could have maybe \u2014 maybe\nhelped. I don\u2019t know, but by the time I got to all my friends \u2014 see, I was in a\ndifferent part of time \u2014 town then. When I went to elementary school I went with a\nbunch of Jewish girls and all that. But when I moved away, and then I came back,\nnone of them was left. So \u2014 but still I\u2014I feel like I should have done more. It\u2019s this\nguilt, plus this why am I here? Why they and not I, you know, this is \u2014 I think\nanyone who survive all this is asking himself that question. So there \u2014 here I am, for\nhow many years, I don\u2019t even remember how long. Anyhow [indecipherable] to\nremember, in the museum.",
        "Q: You had gone over to Europe a couple of years ago for the Red Cross, to a\nconference?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell a little bit about that trip?\n146February 2, 2001",
        "A: Well, to tell you the truth I don\u2019t remember very much. I went to Arolsen, and we\nwent to [indecipherable] to Volary, because Morris Rosen wanted to see the\ngraves of the \u2014 he was \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 his sister bri \u2014 on the death march to Volary, or from\nVolary or from wherever it was, there were lots of girls who were \u2014 who died, and\nsome of them \u2014 of his sister\u2019s friends were buried there and he wanted to see if their\ngraves are taken care of. So that\u2019s when we went to Volary and then we went to\nMunich with the Americ \u2014 with the German Red Cross, and \u2014 and to the\ninternational tracing service and that\u2019s where I found out that I don\u2019t even exist,\nexcept after the war. And \u2014 well, because evidently the man that I worked for had\nmy file destroyed so he wouldn\u2019t have to send me back to this camp. And so I don\u2019t\nexist, so \u2014 but it [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you know exist in the fil \u2014 in the files? Do you know exist?",
        "A: I still don\u2019t exist during the war. And \u2014 so, but we saw Arolsen, how it is\norganized and all that, and \u2014 and I don\u2019t think they \u2014 they have enough help.",
        "Q: This is the center?",
        "A: The center. The International Tracing Center. They don\u2019t have enough personnel,\nthey don\u2019t have enough translators, they don\u2019t have any volunteers like we have. I\nmean, we have paid personnel, but without volunteers, you couldn\u2019t do anything,\nyou know. And \u2014 but they don\u2019t have that stuff. Somebody who can help them with\ntheir knowledge for nothing, so to say. And so that they overworked, underpaid\n147February 2, 2001\nprobably, but \u2014 and \u2014 so it\u2019s very hard to \u2014 for them to \u2014 and people always\ncomplained and they call this \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I think I\u2019ve seen a \u2014 some kind of\nvideo about \u2014 they call 1t Biederman\u2019s Reich. And Biederman is the man who ta \u2014\nwho is in charge of the International Tracing Service in Arols-sen and now they\ndon\u2019t do the things that they supposed to do. If they cannot wri \u2014 read the letter, they\njust put it away and th-they can\u2019t find it all. I don\u2019t know if this 1s a lie. It\u2019s very\npossible that somebody who worked there and thought he or she was mis \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow, put it abused in quotation marks, as taking revenge or what, I mean I don\u2019t \u2014\nall I know that from what I have seen there is they just understaffed a-and the halls\nare full of those documents and they just don\u2019t have enough people to \u2014 to work\nthere. So \u2014",
        "Q: S-So you are \u2014 are gi-giving one day a week in Baltimore and \u2014 yeah. And then\nyou said you saw the sign about the Holocaust Museum, so you began to do what?",
        "A: Well, so Morris and I said, let\u2019s go. So we came here and we started translating.\nAnd he mostly translated from Yiddish and Hebrew, and I from Polish and German.\nAnd sometimes there were some French things too, to do, but mostly \u2014 in the very\nbeginning it was lots of those diaries, Jewish diaries. And I co \u2014 you read the Jewish\ndiaries and m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 was like he was occupied with the Gestapo files, and \u2014 but\nMorris was reading those diaries and he had to summarize them, and then lots of\ntime I did that for him too, so \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 it was really heartbreaking sometimes. The\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwhole work here, really is heartbreaking. Or rather it was more heartbreaking when\nwe read this, the diaries. But you get so that you \u2014 that th \u2014 oh yeah, and then from\nthe Red Cross, we work in Suitland at this archives. And in the archives we were\nlooking in the death books and we found about 40,000 names for the Red Cross, for\nthe tracing service, and got the little certificate from Mrs. Dole for \u2014 for dedicated\nwork and all this kind of stuff. And for example, and we looked through the State\ndepartment files too, and one of the rarely flu \u2014 yeah, I failed with that one. When\nyou were poor and you didn\u2019t have a sponsor here, you couldn\u2019t get to the ameri \u2014 to\nthe States. And one lady says, are you my son? You only take care of the rabbis, you\ndon\u2019t take care of the regular people. And that was really \u2014 you only save the\nyeshivas and that \u2014 no, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if she said yeshivas [indecipherable]\nanyhow she says rabbis or something like that. And that was heartbreaking too, I\nmean just showing how \u2014 how unjust this whole world is arranged. And that\u2019s \u2014 but\nthe law has nothing to do with justice anyhow, so \u2014",
        "Q: Does working on records of Jews, is that any different for you than working on\nrecords of non-Jews?",
        "A: I never work on any records for non-Jews, so I don\u2019t really know. Well, you\nknow, I \u2014 when we work in Suitland, it was always Jewish records they were after.\nWe were after getting the numbers for the tracing service of the Red Cross, so most\nlikely we were looking for \u2014 for \u2014 for Jews. And, you know, any person who suffers\n149February 2, 2001\nis, really to me, is a [indecipherable] except that there\u2019s so much \u2014 if I was \u2014 if I\nwere to be killed, I would be killed because I did something against the Nazis, not \u2014\ncause it\u2019s true, all the Polish intelligentsia went \u2014 was killed too, but I mean, I would\nhave to do something, whereas if I were Jewish, I was to be dead because I was\nJewish, I didn\u2019t have to do anything. And so in a way it is different. But \u2014 so that\u2019s\nwhy I never say I\u2019m a survivor, because I\u2019m \u2014 really don\u2019t feel like one, because my\ns-suffering was not in the slave camps, was not like the suffering of the Polish Jews.\nSo if somebody asked me why don\u2019t you come to the meeting or something like that\nand I say well, because I really don\u2019t belong there.",
        "Q: This is the meeting of survivors?",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, but you survive and you suffer, and this is true, I suffered and I\nsurvived, but \u2014 but it\u2019s \u2014 my suffering was not like that of \u2014 of the others.\n[indecipherable] all the same, well, in a way.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what else is \u2014 so, I say \u2014 you\u2019ve been doing the same kind of work for the\nmuseum since you started the translating?",
        "A: Yeah, all the \u2014 except that sometimes is \u2014 the Gestapo file 1s sometimes is some \u2014\nnow right now w-we had this new Polish archivist, Mrs. Alexandra Boretska(ph)\nand she works \u2014 I do a lot of stuff for her now, to help her. And right now I think \u2019m\nworking on two things. One was a finished thing about the Jews who got\n[indecipherable], where they are, as you know, like where they were deported, and\n150February 2, 2001\nwho kept the records from [indecipherable] and all that. And the other thing that I\njust finished now that I\u2019m really working on the, which ghetto [indecipherable] and\nI was working on Ringlebaum\u2019s(ph) archives too, there, onek(ph) shabbad(ph).\nAnd I stood in the back, so I have thing about the Gestapo [indecipherable] from\nParis.",
        "Q: So when you say you\u2019re working on something, you mean translating it from that\nlanguage into English?",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] into English, looking at the microfiche or something and\nthen translating it. It would be easier for me if I could have a typewriter there, and I\ndidn\u2019t have to write by hand and somebody had to write it again on the typewriter,\nbut unless there is a silent typewriter, I [indecipherable]. But I like my work, and I\n\u2014 I [indecipherable] now that I got old and sick, if I go to work, like I have to go in\nthis rainy and snowy day, I really should be in bed, but when I come here I don\u2019t feel\nsick at all, because ma \u2014 my mind 1s occupied with what I\u2019m doing and not with my\nsickness.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nFebruary 2, 2001\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kristina Belfoure. This is tape number five, side\nA. And you were talking about your experiences at the th-the museum, and you said\nit stimulates your mind. What about emotionally? What does it mean to you when\nyou walk into this building, in an emotional sense?",
        "A: Well, at the beginning it was very emotional, but in the time, it\u2019s \u2014 I forget about\nthat, wh-what this place stands for. Cause otherwise I don\u2019t think I could really work\nand \u2014 and be effective, if I was always thinking about the horrors and the persecution\nand the suffering and all that, I don\u2019t think I could work. I \u2014 I think that if I Just say\nthis 1s just work, that it makes it easier for me. But then if I see the people in the\nhalls, when pick up those passports, it\u2019s \u2014 1n a way it\u2019s very good that I go all the\nway up to the fifth floor, that I don\u2019t have to go through \u2014 I even stopped going for\ncoffee downstairs so I don\u2019t have to see the people walking through, because it\nalways \u2014 I \u2014 you be thinking about, I wonder for whom are they work \u2014 wal \u2014 whom\ndo they want to find out about, and who did they \u2014 whom did they lose? And so I\njust take up to the fifth floor, I don\u2019t have to meet anybody, and I just can go open\nthe door and go to work.",
        "Q: Is there any particular part of the exhibit that you relate to?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Well, of course, the first time I saw it, 1t was on \u2014 I don\u2019t know what floor it is,\nbut [indecipherable] this will happen in from three \u2014 three down, but then the most\n\u2014I don\u2019t know, emotional is when you see this Germans taking down the Polish\nborder, what is it, border flag, o-or Polish border line that\u2019s white and red, you know,\nI mean, to me that was the \u2014 because I know \u2014 I \u2014 I lived through it when they came\nin, so thi-this was the most emotional to me, and I really didn\u2019t look through the\nother ones, because I just couldn\u2019t. And then of course, I still never could understand\nwhy nobody wanted to help them, and us too, to help them. I mean, that was \u2014 you\nsee the newspapers and all this kind of stuff, and nobody really did anything. And of\ncourse, privately people did, probably, but I just can\u2019t imagine how all this could\nhave happened, but of course it happened before, it happened with the Armenians,\nand it\u2019s gonna happen probably with other people, and we haven\u2019t learned anything.\nAnd \u2014 but the people dying out, I don\u2019t know, we just have to do something that\npeople remember how cruel one man can be towards the other.",
        "Q: Have you been through the permanent exhibit more than once?",
        "A: Twice, because I wanted to \u2014 you know, but then I never was looking down, you\nknow, to this \u2014 where you\u2019re not su \u2014 when \u2014 this place that they really show the\ntortures and all that. But then I already saw Dora and I know \u2014 I didn\u2019t see the\npeople suffering thereby, so all the places where they were suffering, so \u2014 and I saw\nthe ra \u2014 right after liberations it was a \u2014 1-it wasn\u2019t clean or anything like that. I\n153February 2, 2001\nmean, it wasn\u2019t like it is now that it\u2019s a museum. It \u2014 it was still the old place that \u2014\nthat you can \u2014 could see the bunker and the [indecipherable] and all these places\nwhere all horrible things happen. And the appelleplatz, and \u2014 and \u2014 and you hear the\npeople telling about it, and you see it, too. So I really, about that, I \u2014 I knew, but then\nin those books and here in the documents, I meet the people.",
        "Q: Wh-What is your relationship with the other volunteers? Both Jewish volunteers,\nor non-Jewish volunteers?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know if there are any no \u2014 Jewish volun \u2014 non-Jewish, I am\nprobably the only non-Jewish, because everybody thought that I was Jewish, and one\nwoman lost a bet with her husband, cause he worked upstairs and he swore I was\nJewish. And she tol \u2014 she says, I just won a bet with my husband, I told him you\nwere not, and \u2014 and since I always go with Morris Rosen, they all think either I\u2019m\nhis wife or his girlfriend or whoever it is. And they call us your mates, and they call\nus your partner in crime, and whatever.",
        "Q: This is another volunteer.",
        "A: Volunteer, Mr. Rosen, yeah. And he comes from Baltimore, so if we can we\ncome together, cause it\u2019s safer, you know. Neither Baltimore nor Washington are\nsafe places to walk through, and that\u2019s why we never come to any of those\nvolunteers\u2019 evenings, because in the first place, cost us money. Not that we couldn\u2019t\nafford this, but then, just to come here for dinner, it doesn\u2019t pay, because we can\u2019t\n154February 2, 2001\ncatch \u2014 th-the last train goes away at 10:30, and who 1s gonna be paying hotel for\n150 dollars just for \u2014 it\u2019d be nice to meet all the volunteers too, you know, and be in\n\u2014 and listen to a concert or see a movie or something like that, but you know, I\nguess, close your eyes and you s \u2014 re-remember what you read, you can see a movie.\nSo \u2014",
        "Q: Have you gotten any special insights because of your work here? Have you\nlearned anything since the late 80\u2019s, when you started?",
        "A: Well, what I learned 1s this, that every one of our religions teaches about\nbrotherly love and love your neighbor as yourself and we still not doing it. That\u2019s the\ninsight that I got. And I don\u2019t know on the other hand \u2014 no, that\u2019s not maybe in the\nmuseum I didn't learn that, but I was asking myself, how would \u2014 you know, when\nyou hear all this at \u2014 anti-Polish expressions, how we \u2014 how we have killed the Jews,\nand how we didn\u2019t help and all that. Nobody ever \u2014 I don\u2019t know somebody \u2014 I\nwrote to the paper and was published, too. Like, for example, the present te \u2014 two\norganizations that, where the Jewish mothers threw their children through the floor\ntraps, somebody would pick them up, and I \u2014 I was serving on one of those \u2014 how is\nit, stations, so to say. If you saw a train that was coming through and has a certain\nmarkings, which meant there were children on it. Now, didn\u2019t say Jewish children or\nPolish children, but there were some markings on the trains that \u2014 that you knew\nthere were children, and you had to tell somebody else that so and so train passed\n155February 2, 2001\nthrough this station. And there were \u2014 then you knew that someplace between one\nplace and the other, there could have been a child who was dropped through the\nfloor. And then the \u2014 somebody would see to it that the child was picked up. And\nthis was all organized, and I think it was organized by the present pope, I think, of \u2014\nhe wasn\u2019t a pope then, of course. But it was all organized this way to pick up the\nchildren that were dropped, so \u2014 and it \u2014 nobody even knows about it. And it\u2019s true,\nthere were [indecipherable] and were bad people, like in every nation you had bad\npeople. But why should I be paying and be responsible for people who were bad?\nAnd yet, it\u2019s just because I\u2019m saying I\u2019m Polish, the mother says, huh oh. I mean, it\nhappens very often. I mean, in Red Cross there was this new worker there and she\nsays to me, ah, the Poles were so horrible to the Jews, killed them during \u2014 and she is\nnot even Jewish. And she says \u2014 and I said, who told you stuff like that? Absolute\nthere were people like that, but they weren\u2019t any better than the J-Jewish O.D. I\nmean, you know what O.D. is? Ordnungsdienst, so the Jewish police. I mean, it\nwas just as cruel as the Polish police or anybody else. I mean, and you \u2014 nobody \u2014\nthey were more hated in the ghetto some \u2014 for example, than \u2014 than even the Polish\npolice, cause you can always bribe the Polish police. And of course I understand the\n\u2014 the Ordnungsdienst, or the yi \u2014 Jewish police, they wanted to stay alive, so \u2014 I\nmean, this whole idea was that everybody who was in this situation had to \u2014 wanted\nto survive, and the will to survive makes you do things that \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I\n156February 2, 2001\nwould do if it was I who had to decide, who had to fight for my life, and f \u2014 and\nmake a \u2014 prolong it for one or two or three days. Of course, ther \u2014 you were always\npromised you\u2019re gonna stay alive longer. And I mean, the insight probably that I\ngain is that you never know what you would do in a given situation, that no matter\nhow much I b \u2014 was taught about this forgive our trespasses, love your brother like\nyour own, like yourself. I don\u2019t know what I would do, if I were pushed toward the\nwall. If my back was toward the wall, what would I do? And for God to judge\npeople. I don\u2019t know if we have the right to do it. Like the Indians say, don\u2019t judge a\nperson until you walk in his moccasins. And that\u2019s the truest truth there is, really.",
        "Q: You\u2019ve written three books?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What prompted you to write these books?",
        "A: Well, the first one was written by my \u2014 was \u2014 the first one that I wrote in a\nGerman \u2014 in a little German town was because my father \u2014 well, when I came to\nPoland, and you know, the Poles hated the Germans because almost every one of us\nlost somebody from the family. My uncle was killed because the \u2014 all the professors\nwere killed in Lvov when the Nazis came. And there were other members of the\nfamily that were incarcerated, and they say her, she\u2019s crazy, saying that there are\ngood Germans. But I say, but I\u2019ve lived there and I know that there were good ones,\ncause if \u2014 without them we would have never survived. And so \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "Q: This is when you came back to Poland after the war?",
        "A: To Poland to v \u2014 after the war to visit. And wherever I went it was the same\nstory, so finally my father says, why don\u2019t you just sit down and write the book\nabout, in quotation marks, the good Germans. And I say I understand why you think\nthere were no good, all you saw was the Nazis, the SS, the Gestapo and the\nEinsatztrup(ph) and you didn\u2019t ever see \u2014 I said, the system was horrible, but there\nwere still good Germans. Oh no, of course not. And so that\u2019s why I sit down to write\nthe book, but you know how \u2014 I was teaching and raising a son, I didn\u2019t have that\nmuch time to write a book. But so he never read it because he died in \u201976, so \u2014 so he\nnever read it. But then once I started it, somebody says no, so what, don\u2019t leave us\nlike \u2014 don\u2019t leave us \u2014 tell us what happened. So I wrote about the displaced persons,\nhow our life was in the camps. And then somebody says again well, what\u2019s the end?\nWhat\u2019s the ending, can \u2014 oh yeah, I remember I gave it to some Jewish couple to\nread and they said, well, can\u2019t you write about some happy times? And I say \u2014 ya \u2014\nlike in America and all that kind of stuff. So I said okay. So the last one is called\n\u201cAmerica: Dreams and Reality,\u201d and tells \u2014 this is the longest book, because of\ncourse it describes from what, \u201951 to \u201990 or 200. No, it was published 1n 200\n[indecipherable] in \u00b089. And the first one didn\u2019t sell well at \u2014 at all in Poland. And\nas a matter of fact, the [indecipherable] went bankrupt. But I don\u2019t think it was\nbankrupt on account of my book, praising \u2014 talking about good Germans, but it was\n158February 2, 2001\nbecause the guy didn\u2019t know how to \u2014 that was this time when all this new capitalists\nwanted to grab money and he just probably didn\u2019t have any idea how to sell books.",
        "Q: This is the book, \u201cIn the Shadow of Dora,\u201d that you\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: Yes, \u201cIn the Shadow of Dora,\u201d I cou \u2014 I \u2014",
        "Q: Now that \u2014 that\u2019s here in the \u2014 in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nlibrary.",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Are the other two books here?",
        "A: I\u2014 nobody could find. I gave them \u2014 I gave it to the \u2014 I give this in the dep \u2014 from\n[indecipherable] lan \u2014 land of slavery, I gave it here and it\u2019s not here, I can\u2019t find it.\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve given America to the \u2014 no, I don\u2019t think yet, because I only had\none copy, so I don\u2019t think \u2014 and I don\u2019t think that would interest anybody, because \u2014\nthat might interest the displaced persons, because they went through the same stages\nof being \u2014 getting here and getting acquainted and all that.",
        "Q: Now, ba \u2014 these books have been in both languages, in Polish and in English?",
        "A: No, they all are in Polish except the one in the little German town that was\npublished in Germany, because the Germans got hold of it and translated it and\npublished without sending me the copy of the translations. So they are \u2014 and I was\nan idiot enough, I have \u2014 I have no contract or anything like with \u2014 with them. So\nfinally the guy said, if they sell 1,000 and the editor, I mean the publisher says 1,000\n159February 2, 2001\ncopies, then I get some \u2014 and the \u2014 his financial assistant said 1,500. And so I\u2019m not\ngonna wait for that, okay\u2019? The fact is that I put down something so that those who\ncome after us knows what this generation of us went through and yet somehow\nsurvived. And I think that the reason why we really survive is the 20 years of po \u2014\nPolish independence, cause then we were \u2014 after the 123 years of being taken by\nRussians, Prussians and Austrians, in this free Poland, the Pilsudski\u2019s free Poland,\nwe \u2014 it was imbued in this crowd of the old Poland, and I always was in this camp\nof this nation of a ma \u2014 kingdom or republic of free nations, you know how that if\nyou le \u2014 stick together instead of quarrel, you can be somebody. And I always\nwanted Poland to be multi-culture and multi-religious. And I had this teacher who\nalways \u2014 in elementary school, who always complain how dumb the Polish\ngovernment is and those national democrats and all and this \u2014 and so finally \u2014 and\nwe finally said well, can you tell us when Poland was really big? And \u2014 and she\nsays, Ill tell you. And she said, when the Russian Greek \u2014 no, when the Ukrainian\nGreek Orthodox pre \u2014 prince said to his son, whom he sent to Italy to study,\nremember son, you are a Pole. He says, that\u2019s where Poland could be proud of\nherself. And that stuck with me so that \u2014 of course that\u2019s impossible in this situation,\nwhen all those new ethnical quarrels and all this. I mean, people somehow didn\u2019t\nknow that you can live in peace, speaking a different language, pursuing a different\nreligion, and \u2014 and I mean, and live in peace in one country. Somehow people just\n160February 2, 2001\ndon\u2019t see it, you can see it now, Africa or Yugoslavia, wherever we are, you see the\nsame old stuff, this hatred. And \u2014 but then everybody says that I am is \u2014 all cynical\nand only see the bad side of the \u2014 of the history and I have a friend who says, now\nmy gosh, she finally said something good. And she sa \u2014 no, because I always see the\ndownside of life. And I said, when you look around, there is no up side. There are\nthe rich and there are the poor. There are the educated and uneducated. And I know\nit\u2019s the fault of an uneducated who drop from school and all that. And I see it\u2019s the \u2014\nevery religious \u2014 whether it be a rabbi or a priest or whoever the others ones, they all\npreach their own catechism and \u2014 but I said, but now, since we \u2014 since I see the\nCatholic church said we \u2014 not every \u2014 I have to \u2014 have to tell this to Mr. Rosen, but\nthis \u2014 this writing in the bulletin and says something about [indecipherable] yeah,\nsomething about the desert through which our ancestors fr \u2014 no, it\u2019s talking aya \u2014 in\nthe life, working through life as in a \u2014 like our spiritual forefather or faithful father \u2014\nyeah, I got my faithful fathers walked through the desert, as they coming back, th-\nthis Judeo-Christian idea. And \u2014 but to see that written in a bulletin, that\u2019s kind of \u2014 I\nmean, that\u2019s a totally different aspect as you have seen, let\u2019s say, even 20 years ago,\nbefore this pope. And I \u2014 I think that \u2014 but then you own the other \u2014 the Christian\nand the Jews can get together now, but how about the Arabs and the Jews? I mean,\nthis idea of killing \u2014 going to heaven when you kill an enemy? I mean it\u2019s just so\nFebruary 2, 2001\ninhuman, the whole thought is inhuman. But maybe if we keep working at it we\u2019re\ngonna get better, who knows?",
        "Q: Have you been back to Poland many times?",
        "A: Yes, I have been back to Poland and \u2014 but I never got a reception in Poland like\n\u2014 except for my parents and families and all that, like I got in \u2014 in \u20141n Tel Aviv,\ncause my \u2014 when I went to the wedding, to Janet\u2019s daughter, she already told\neverybody that her friend is coming and that she is from Poland. And I went from\none store to another, on one person to another, cause they said, oh we would like to\nmeet you cause my mother\u2019s from Poland, my grandmother was from Poland, and\nshe would so want to hear. So I just went from one place to another, you know? It\nwas \u2014 you know, nobody was talking about anti-Semitism, or anti \u2014 because all these\npeople, you know, left before the war. So their life was cultural, organized, and \u2014 a-\nand you know, usually people that are smart remember good things. They don\u2019t go\nback to the horrible things, cause that just sours up your life. And it wa \u2014 1t was\nreally great, and when we started talking and we one time all thought about the same\nthing. Here the matzos are so small, you know, and back home the matzos were\nhuge, you know, like for a whole family nah. And we talking about the kudskis(ph),\nyou know, that you make for \u2014 what\u2019s that holiday that you build a shelter on the\noutside?",
        "Q: A \u2014a sukkah?\n162February 2, 2001",
        "A: Sukkahs, yeah. And \u2014 we call this kudski(ph), I think. But anyhow, so we talked\nabout all these things and it was fun, it was really, really fun, those happy\nremembrances.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. What \u2014 what else were your feelings in Israel when you got there?",
        "A: Oh, in the first place, when I got there this guy \u2014 I was proud, you know, finally\nthey have their own land, you know. I don\u2019t know whether I said \u2014 although I\nshowed this guy my passport and he said oh \u2014 no, the American\u2019s passport don\u2019t\nmention religion, do they?",
        "Q: Place of birth, but not religion.",
        "A: Yeah, and anyhow, I ca \u2014 he just keeps looking at it and now there\u2019s flags, you\nknow. And I don\u2019t know, maybe I was \u2014 ah, no. I was supposed to be picked up by\nJanet, but Janet messed up the arrival time. And so here I am waiting and waiting\nand nothing happens. And then maybe I had tears in my eyes, but anyhow, I was\nlooking at these flags and you know that not to think about, cause I\u2019m always this\nperson who thinks something worse \u2014 something bad happened to you if you didn\u2019t\nshow up. And the guy says to me, why you \u2014 he says, I exchange your dollars for the\nShekel and I put you in a taxi and you can \u2014 and you can go where you\u2019re going.\nAnd I kind of keep on looking and I say \u2014 I don\u2019t know how, but anyhow he said \u2014 I\nwas about to cry, I think, or something like \u2014 and I said, well I\u2019m not crying for not\nmeeting my friend, I\u2019m crying cause I\u2019m so happy seeing all this \u2014 these flags and all\n163February 2, 2001\nthat, that you finally have your own land and you don\u2019t have to wander through. And\n\u2014 and that was really \u2014 that was really great, when you think about it. And then, all\nthese Jews from Poland brought their Polish individuality and you have two \u2014 and\nyou have 10 political parties like it used to be in Poland. They have all this idea, I\u2019m\nthe king and I know what\u2019s right and you don\u2019t. And I\u2019m not listening to what you\nare saying [indecipherable] still think about, and that didn\u2019t fall from the sky, that\u2019s\nthe Polish experience, where everybody could be a king. Even had the saying that no\nwomen on his estate and his estate wasn\u2019t bigger this \u2014 this room, is equal to the big\ngovernor, I mean that kind of stuff. And you see that in Israel when they start having\nall those political parties and all these different words. It\u2019s nothing but that they\nheard it. That they brought with them.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 do you think because of your background you\u2019re \u2014 th-the way you raised\nyour son was affected? I mean, obviously it was because of the conditions that you\nwere in, a single mother and having to work and go to school. But because of your\nEuropean background and the difficulties that you went through.",
        "A: I wou \u2014",
        "Q: Did that affect how you brought him up?",
        "A: Well, I was trying to just make sure that he gets good education. That was my\nmain thing, my \u2014 however, since \u2014 I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t teach him Polish, when he\nwas little he knew it, but then my husband says, I don\u2019t understand anything he\u2019s\n164February 2, 2001\nsaying. And then I went to school and I didn\u2019t have time, and I\u2019m very sorry for that.\nAnd I didn\u2019t imbue him with this proud Polishness that I have. And he says, well you\nnever say \u2014 you always praise Poland. And I said, but I never said anything bad\n[indecipherable] America, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m proud of being Polish, I have a thousand\nyear history behind me. And \u2014 of course he would have rather been born to some\nFrench woman \u2014 I mean French immigrant or English immigrant. He \u2014 for some\nreason he, no matter how I brought him up he still \u2014 he \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have the same\nnature I have. He always complains that all I do is always take care of other people\ninstead of myself. And I say, because in real life, I mean at the end of your life, it\u2019s\nnot what you did for yourself, 1t\u2019s what you did for other people. And what got to\nhim, that\u2019s so alien. Absolutely alien, and yet, since he was brought up with, in a\nJewish home, so to say, he married a Jewish girl.",
        "Q: Wh-Why do you say he was brought up in a Jewish home?",
        "A: Well, [indecipherable] Shabbas we went to a Jewish home, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, okay, that\u2019s your friends, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, with my friends. And I mean, he \u2014 he thought that all Jewish people are\nthe same like Janet and Stanley Levin, for education and not for money and all this\nkind of stuff. And then he marries this girl. I don\u2019t know what he expected. And he\nsays, you know, there\u2019s ka \u2014 all ki \u2014 they\u2019re so cluster, they\u2019re so exclusive, they\u2019re\nso \u2014 see with Janet and \u2014 and Stanley he was used to, you know, being included,\n165February 2, 2001\nand he thought that every Jewish family is like that, that they would \u2014 that if they\nlike somebody they would sort of, yeah, greet him as their own. And he says, they\u2019re\nnot like that at all, they\u2019re very exclusive. They don\u2019t consider you one of their own.\nAnd I-I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 anyhow, the marriage failed because of the money, I\nthink, she wanted to stay in a little town, and he \u2014 and I said, well, I have those two\nJudo-Christian grandchildren.",
        "Q: Have you \u2014 di-did you become more religious because of your experience during\nthe war?",
        "A: No, becau \u2014",
        "Q: Or less religious? Did it affect you in any way, religiously?",
        "A: On the contrary, I didn\u2019t. I had less religious for a simple reason that when I saw\nthe suffering of the Jews, or I heard about it, and later I saw it \u2014 here 1s a nation that\nprays, keeps all these hundreds of commandments, prays to this God, and he lets his\nchosen people be chosen to the ovens. I really stopped being religious. I go to church\nby tradition and I know there isn\u2019t \u2014 there\u2019s got to be somebody, cause even there\nwasn\u2019t, we have to invent him to make sense 1n life. What for how, why, but when \u2014\nI mean, and I\u2019m not the only one, there are lots of Jewish people who lost their faith\nbecause of that. I mean, when you really think what 1s \u2014 all this \u2014 so many people \u2014 I\nremember this one fellow who \u2014 who got a chicken and he says \u2014 and his mother\nwouldn\u2019t eat it, she\u2019d rather be hungry and skinny because it was not kosher chicken.\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI mean, here the guy goes through all this trouble to buy this chicken and his mother\nrefuses to eat because it\u2019s not kosher. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 I understand, walking through\nthe desert you had to keep your hygiene so that you stay alive, cause the \u2014 not\nenough water and \u2014 and p-plagues and bad food could just kill a whole family, whole\ntribe. But I mean, in modern times? But that \u2014 that was what makes me \u2014 what made\nme really not believe. I just know that there\u2019s all this preachers and rabbis, they tell\ntheir own story now because they want to stay in clerical garbs. But I-I \u2014 I really \u2014\nand I go to church and I look at it and I say my prayers and then I say, what a\nhypocrite you are. And then \u2014 but when I\u2019m in that church, I pray, and I say this Our\nFather and all this. And of course \u2014 an-and the reason why I really don\u2019t see any af \u2014\nsaw any anti-Semitism is because you always read this first old Bible, you know the\n\u2014 you know the \u2014 they is \u2014 and then be \u2014 the Bible, the story from the Bible \u2014",
        "Q: You mean \u2014 you mean the he \u2014 the Hebrew Bible, you mean?",
        "A: Hebrew Bible and then you read the evangel and the new things, you know, so\nthere is always this connection and they always say the ceremony about this Old\nTestament and \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s what they call 1t, Old Testament and this New\nTestament. And so I always saw this connection, but the \u2014 in practical \u2014 in practice,\nthis thing didn\u2019t work out. It\u2019s only now coming back that they stress all this Judeo-\nChristian relationship. And so, maybe it\u2019s only insurance, you know, since I don\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nknow what\u2019s up there or down below, going to church is my insurance and I should\n\u2014 gosh, it\u2019s a sin to say stuff like that.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Kristina Belfoure. This is tape number five, side\nB. Do you think you would be a different person today if you hadn\u2019t gone through\nthe experiences that you went through as a young \u2014 young woman?",
        "A: Well, definitely I would. In the first place I wouldn\u2019t have met so many people\nand learned that among the bad ones, there are good ones. And that people are all the\nsame, no matter where they are. And you \u2014 you have to forgive the bad ones and\nhave \u2014 thank God that you met some good ones. And basically that before I always\nthought that the only good people were Polish pe \u2014 I mean Poles, whether they were\nMosaic or Catholic. But then when you go out in the world, you learn that people are\nall the same, in a way, that they are formed by their cultures. And language brings \u2014\nthat the characteristics, that they just have \u2014 they\u2019re influenced by their language, by\ntheir cultures, but basically when you go down to it, they\u2019re si \u2014 they\u2019re all the same,\ngood and bad. And you-your \u2014 when you have your own children you try to make\nthem citizens of the world so that we see that everybody is \u2014 that we all human and\nyou\u2019re never really successful, because sometimes, I see by my own son that not all\n168February 2, 2001\npeople are the same \u2014 or have the same value in his eyes. So I wasn\u2019t very\nsuccessful, although I tried. But there\u2019s nothing that we can do but hope, and try to\nbe better. And I tried, and sometimes I fall back and say bad things about other\npeople. I try not to, but that\u2019s a very human thing, you blame somebody else for your\nown unhappiness and so \u2014 but I never, never made a difference between a Jew, ora\nCatholic or a German or a French, or an English if she was a good person.",
        "Q: Because of what you went through as a \u2014 a young woman, has that affected you\npolitic \u2014 politically?",
        "A: Which one are you \u2014 a woman?",
        "Q: Well, your experiences in Poland and in Germany, and so forth. Has that \u2014 do\nyou think that\u2019s affected you politically?",
        "A: Well, of course I would never be a communist. And I think that democracy,\nguarded by public schools, and education in public schools is the best way of\ngoverning. But I also know that power and greed can buy certain rights and political\npower, and that you have to watch out for that. Because I\u2019m too old to do anything\nabout it, but if \u2014 one thing I know for sure, that I always will be voting, because if\nyou don\u2019t vote, you \u2014 you have nothing to complain about later on, if things go\nwrong. And sometimes you get your \u2014 you don\u2019t get Gore, you get Bush, but you\nhave to put up with it, cause you know, four years from now he can get \u2014 he gave his\n\u2014 if he was good, he stays, if he wasn\u2019t, can go out. So I \u2014 I \u2014 politically \u2014 but then I\n169February 2, 2001\nalways was sort of a\u2014 maybe not a democrat, but I was more \u2014 I always saw\ninjustice in the world, and I just always thought that \u2014 and I think that the\ngovernment is the only place really in this \u2014 that can help p-people, and \u2014 in\nwhatever situations. And so I don\u2019t \u2014 I think I would never be one of those\ngovernment haters, and no matter \u2014 but you have to watch it, you can\u2019t just let\ngovernment do what they want to do if it\u2019s not right. So that\u2019s politics, that\u2019s what I\nam.",
        "Q: Would you just \u2014 if someone asked you, are you Polish or American, how would\nyou answer?",
        "A: First I would say I\u2019m a human, a woman and then I would say a teacher and then\nI would say a mother and then I would say of Polish origin. That\u2019s what I would say.",
        "Q: Would you say you\u2019re American?",
        "A: Oh, if \u20141f I am abroad I am always an American. I mean, here if somebody \u2014\ncause here is this business of Polish-American, Spanish-American, that kind of stuff.\nNow they came up with African-American. If they ever been in the Africa they\nknow that there are 50 nations at least. But I am Americanized. I do keep some\nPolish traditions, but \u2014",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Ah, such was this, before Christmas eve, when you have this \u2014 they call this\nVigilia(ph), that\u2019s the vigil of Christmas and you take this white waffle and you\n170February 2, 2001\nbreak it with whoever is with you and you say forgive me and be brothers again and\nall this kind of stuff. I find this a very nice custom. And let\u2019s see, what else? That\u2019s\nabout all that I really believe in when it goes for \u2014 and of course there\u2019s the language\nthat ties me to Poland.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what language do you think in?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, I think ever since I have fallen, math, definitely first Polish.\nWhen it goes for counting, I count in Polish. But otherwise, I think in the language\nthat I am speaking. But when \u2014 since I\u2019ve fallen on my head, and I s-sometime \u2014 and\nI speak with a person who knows both languages, I\u2019m not sure whether I can keep\nwith \u2014 in one language. I never have that trouble with French because I know they \u2014\nthis \u2014 oh yeah, there\u2019s a Spanish, but I mean, that doesn\u2019t bother me. But since I\nnever learned Italian very well and I don\u2019t know Spanish very well, I ran \u2014 really\nnever know what you \u2014 whether I\u2019m speaking Spanish or Italian, but \u2014 so I avoid it.\nBut I think that I basically \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Now right now I am talking English to\nyou, so I think in English.",
        "Q: When you go back to Poland, what are your thoughts about the country now, and\ndo you feel yourself at home when you\u2019 re there?",
        "A: Well, I haven\u2019t been in this new Poland, but you ni \u2014 I always knew that nobody\nliked what was going on there, cause you can hear all those jokes, the taxi drivers\nalways told \u2014 tell you the jokes. And you still see this dislike of the Soviets. Well,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nnot so much Soviets, like the Russians. And I speak \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I really \u2014 not that I miss\nPoland, but I have love for it, for my beginnings and \u2014 on \u2014 but now on the other\nside I\u2019m very \u2014 I love America because it gives a chance, those of us who were su \u2014\ncouldn\u2019t go back or didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland, gave us a new beginning. It\u2019s\nlike a \u2014 it\u2019s like a promised land, in a way. And of course, not everybody\u2019s life was a\nparadise on the country. Some people had a very, very hard life. Not I, not that \u2014\nbeing not excluded. But yeah, it\u2019s a country that gave us a chance to be something.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I notice you\u2019re wearing a pin that says teacher for the millennium.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Was that an award that you received?",
        "A: When \u2014 no, it\u2019s \u2014 one of my students gave me, and send it from California and\nthey says, make sure you wear it, and so \u2014 because I was meeting her aunt or\nsomebody, I wore it, cause she \u2014 I knew \u2014 and then I forgot to take it off.",
        "Q: Id like to have you read, or \u2014 or me read this last paragraph in the book that you\nwrote, called, \u201cIn the Shadow of Dora,\u201d and see if you have any con \u2014 comments\nafter.",
        "A: Well, \u201cWe the ones who lived through the terror, and those who would learn of it,\nwhen the temptation of conquest and power presents itself, remember the terror. Will\nthey remember the sacrifice of 50 million people during the conflict began by the\nNazis, no matter what the revisionists say? Will they remember the Holocaust and\n172February 2, 2001\nthe warning of the changing wheel of fortune? We learn so little from history, and\nrepeat the same old horrible mistakes, again and again. I know only that I would not\nwant to forget the good of the few people in Nordhausen, nor would I want to fail\ntelling others about them.\u201d",
        "Q: That\u2019s beautiful. Is there anything you wanted to add to that?",
        "A: Well, no. I just hope that we never \u2014 that our children and our grandchildren will\nnever have to suffer or see others suffer and not do anything about it. And that this\nwhole horror was brought to me by this death of Jan Karski, who \u2014 who tried so\nbravely to na \u2014 to \u2014 to tell the world about what\u2019s going on and nobody would listen\nto him. And whenever I think about har \u2014 and about how this man felt, that he failed,\nhe \u2014 in his life, because despite all he tried, he couldn\u2019t move anybody to do\nanything. On the other hand, I don\u2019t know what he expected people to do, and what\ncould have been done. But 1-it\u2019s just he, when I first saw him, o-on Lehrman Miles\nwith us, his goodbye dinner or something, you know, and he \u2014 he was talking about\nhow Mr. Lehrman Miles help him after his wife died, and then Mr. Miles said the\nsame thing about him, how wonderful Karski was, and how a courageous man. But\nI know that he felt, yeah, from the talk \u2014 talking \u2014 from talking with him, he knew\nthat he felt that he really didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t do \u2014 that he failed to do what he wanted to\ndo. But then, it\u2019s easy to judge again, without knowing. And even American Jewry\ndidn\u2019t do anything, but on the other hand I understand they were afraid of a\n173February 2, 2001\nbacklash. And so this worl \u2014 life is so complicated. There\u2019s no such a thing like a\neasy, straight line. And everybody brings into this life his own dislikes and likes, his\nown ideas, and they always in conflict with somebody else\u2019s. And the wisdom is \u2014 or\nwould be, t-to do the right thing, but how many of us think about it? Not everybody\ncan think that clearly and long distance. Then we have our own problems, and\neverybody\u2019s involved in our own life and pr \u2014 solving our problems, and it\u2019s not\neasy to live. So that\u2019s why probably people are believing in God, because this \u2014\nwithout knowing that \u2014 believing that there is something up there, or wherever, in\nspace, life would be worthless. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Is there any message you wanted to leave to your grandchildren?",
        "A: My grandchildren? Love the people around you and be truthful to yourselves,\nespecially.",

        "A: I don\u2019t think so, because all the Jewish teachers were in the cheder school.",
        "A: But there were Jewish teachers too, but not many.",
        "A: I never knew any difference, so I really, when people talk about anti-Semitism\nand this and that, I don\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel any, you know, except once in\nawhile or \u2014 later on the Polish \u2014 the teach \u2014 teacher of Polish would say, you don\u2019t\nsay it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a st \u2014 it stands in a \u2014 it stands in a newspaper, that\u2019s a German\nexpression, which of course you pick it up from if they were talking Yiddish at\nhome, you know, th-they tranpor \u2014 transported that into Polish, and that \u2014 that\u2019s the\nonly thing I remember the teacher says, that he says don\u2019t say that because that\u2019s not\ngood Polish, and that was the only thing. But I \u2014 I didn\u2019t see any difference, I mean,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI played with them and went to school with them and \u2014 and I did even a sinful thing\nbecause sometimes we would feed them ham sandwiches, and \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I was very outgoing and very curious. Any [indecipherable] that did \u2014 I was\nalways very inquisitive, why is it so, and a \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and how it could \u2014 it \u2014 how\nis it that is so and so. And it was in the same school that \u2014 I don\u2019t know what grade\nhe was, but anyhow, the \u2014 there was a time when the ve \u2014 Viennese Jews came to\nPoland. And of course they were very rich and brought their stuff and bought houses\nand all that, and \u2014 but the kids had to come to school with us. And a \u2014 they didn\u2019t sp\n\u2014 when they \u2014 the parents always spoke German, but the kids would answer them in\nPolish. And \u2014 but there was this one who, well I think we were just so jealous of her\nbecause she was big and \u2014 and she had a maid who carried her satchel to school. But\nof course she was so heavy that she couldn\u2019t carry all this stuff. And there were four\nof us going along the side \u2014 in the \u2014 Beniki(ph) there was this \u2014 this close to the\nVistula river, so there\u2019s this part where you walk, but \u2014 but then 1t comes down. Not\nin a ditch, but it just \u2014 and the bank lowers a little bit towards the street. And low \u2014\nwe all \u2014 there were four friends of us, and we all wish we\u2019d got together, and so\nwhenever this girl and the maid would come, we wouldn\u2019t let her through. And one\nday, I don\u2019t know why, one of us, some newcomer came and she \u2014 sh-she joined the\nFebruary 2, 2001\ngroup and it came so that we pushed this other gir \u2014 not the girl, but the maid fell\ndown. And so she went to the school and she complained that we are misbehaving\nand all that kind of stuff, and then the teacher called us in and then the principal\ncalled us in, and then the teacher said \u2014 cause she went to the principal and then the\nprincipal told the teacher that \u2014 what kind of children she\u2019s bringing up. Course, that\nwas a class of 40 kids, so she couldn\u2019t really watch over everyone. But she says to\nus, why did you push them, or did you push her? And somebody says, because she 1s\na Jew. And the teacher said, uh-uh, then you would push Holy Mary in the ditch too.\nNo, never. How would we? She said, oh yes you would, and you would put Jesus in\na ditch, too. And we said why? She says, because they were Jews. And of course,\nnobody ever told us that, you know, you always talk about all this other stuff. And\nwe had a religion class every day, so the Jewish girls went to school, th-they had a\nfree period, and then on \u2014 when they had to go to school, I think on Sunday they had\ntheir religious school, so for religion they went to their own rabbi. And so there was\n\u2014 I had an afet \u2014 uncle who was an atheist, and he all \u2014 and this preacher \u2014 I mean,\nthis religion teacher always says, any questions? And this uncle of mine always\nwould ask \u2014 say ask him about this and that, and there were all kinds of questions,\nyou know, that a priest couldn\u2019t really answer to s \u2014 little children. And so this day,\nit \u2014 I\u2019m just keep on, you know, telling him [indecipherable] when he said, are there\nany questions, I say, yeah, yeah, he \u2014 but he just want \u2014 disregarded me, because he\nFebruary 2, 2001\ndidn\u2019t want any stupid questions again. But I almost knock his glasses off, and I say\n\u2014 so he says okay, now what is it today? And I say, is this true that J-Jesus was a\nJew? And he say, yeah, and his mother and his apostles and the first Christians were\nJews. And then I say, how come we never knew about it, you know. But anyhow, I\nthink that from that moment on, mine attitude toward Jews was changed. You know\nthere was that, before when I \u2014 when I looked \u2014 course, you couldn\u2019t tell who was a\nJew if they were not having the itzkeys(ph) and all that kind of stuff, and the\nmitzkeys(ph) on top, or howarts(ph) with all this stuff, you couldn't tell. But then\nsince that time I keep looking, you know, whether I \u2014 cause there was this stupid\nidea that I recognize Jesus in one of them, but I mean \u2014 anyhow, that\u2019s how my\nattitude \u2014 I never had any non-attitude toward Jews since they were my school\nfriends, okay, and school friends don\u2019t talk about religion. You talk about your\nschool things, and your girl things and you don\u2019t talk about big things. But since\nthen I\u2014I was more friendly, and how would I say? Yeah, more interested, you\nknow. And so then when I was [indecipherable] my best friend was Sarah\nFeldman and they lived on the corner there. By the way in the same house that the\npope used to live as a little boy. And that was on the Vistula river. W-We live on\nthis corner, on the Debieniczka(ph) market, and on the other one, Sarah Feldman\nlive in this house, and here\u2019s some place lived the present pope as a young boy. And\nSarah was telling me something about the Diaspora, you know. Course, it wasn\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\ncalled Diaspora in those days, but she says [indecipherable] Jew, and I just didn\u2019t\nbelieve her, you know. I always thought there \u2014 I thought this old par \u2014 Polish Jews\nwere \u2014 there were no Jews anyplace else but in Poland. Especially then, when I went\nto school, we are no longer \u2014 we are asked never to call them Jews, but Poles of\nMosaic confession \u2014 or persuasion, pardon me. Because my te \u2014 now my teacher\nsaid, this word Jews is a word that came from Russia and it was an insulting word.\nAnd that\u2019s where you to \u2014 when we \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t be using it. And \u2014 but then, you\nknow how when you says Pole of a Mosaic persuasion, how long that is, your\nmouth, you \u2014 to say she 1s \u2014 and we never said she is Jewish. I don\u2019t know, maybe\nwe did. No [indecipherable] and we always says in the Jewish she or he, because in\nPolish that\u2019s possible. And anyhow, that\u2019s how I was brought up. You know, even\ntoday when I do the translations for the Red Cross and it says of nationality Polish,\nand religion, I always say Mosaic, because I \u2014 I had to \u2014 and they always would put\n\u2014 tho-those who correct those things said Jewish, and I said no, so I wrote j \u2014 the\nPolish Red Cross and I said, now what is it? Because when I went to school, in\n[indecipherable] documents, it said confession, it says either Roman Catholic or\nEvangelic or whatever, or Mosaic. I mean, there was no such a thing like Jewish. So\n\u2014 and besides I say to this lady in the Red Cross, that\u2019s an insult. And\n[indecipherable] Jews used an insulting words where it\u2019s possible, you know. And \u2014\nbecause they didn\u2019t know any different. But anyhow, so that\u2019s how \u2014 if you have\nFebruary 2, 2001\nfriends \u2014 and this also played \u2014 how to say, not \u2014 I don\u2019t know, of course, in \u2014 in the\ngymnasium too, we had girls who were Jewish, and one of my \u2014 I was one Eva, and\nthe other one al \u2014 Eva Kliseberg(ph). But then we were in \u2014 we used a bad Polish \u2014\nwell we \u2014 if we wanted to insult her, if somebody wanted to insult anyone whose\nname end in erg, like Kliseberg(ph) or Oberberg(ph) or something, well in Polish\nthere, to indicate a young girl, a daughter of somebody, you end \u2014 you put the ending\nuvna to indicate that she is an unmarried young girl. Now, but if your name ends in\nG, [indecipherable] and you end and you add this uvna, that gives you a word for\nhuman waste. And so the teacher would say, my goodness gracious, we \u2014 you\u2019re\nsupposed to say po \u2014 in Polish, the \u2014 the gare(ph) changes to jer(ph). And she\n[indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff and how she was a movie star, theater\nstar. She played with Martha Eggert(ph) and this Polish singer, forgot his name.\nBut anyhow she was a beautiful girl, I [indecipherable] Polish officer who was an\ninvalid, he left his \u2014 lost his leg during the war. And I will never see such a beautiful\ngirl, and we were so jealous of her mother because her mother was always assisting\nher, comes to class, picks her up and all this. And the jealousy is a long-lived\nsentiment, you know. But anyhow \u2014 but, I mean, she survive Auschwitz and she\nlives in Szezecin, or Stettin and she is in the theater and we correspond and\n[indecipherable]. And one time we had the school ball and the \u2014 both of us were\nchosen queen, as a \u2014 were a little crown on the \u2014 and she didn\u2019t even know. And \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001\nand \u2014 and I said we just look at the school picture and you see you got something on\nyour head. And I don\u2019t know how the teacher did it, but they give us two crowns,\none for her and one for me. But she was a gorgeous little girl, and she probably still\nis. And of course the girls \u2014 and the only time that I saw her during the war was on\nthe street. And she is working together with the other ones to work on the \u2014 to clean\nthe streets of snow. And when I saw her I couldn\u2019t believe it. I said, what are you\ndoing here? And she says, go away because they gonna take you, too. So I ran away.\nThat was the only time that I saw her during the war, before she went to Auschwitz.\nBut she survived. I couldn\u2019t imagine she wouldn\u2019t, you know, with her luck and\nbeautiful looks. And she was a good \u2014 she could have very easily said, because \u2014 that\nshe was not Jewish, cause you can\u2019t prove it. But then you could be denounced\nsometimes and that was even worse.",
        "A: Oh no, I was very anemic and I know that because I couldn\u2019t get to write \u2014 th-the\nPolish or European one has a little hook, and I never knew whether the hook was on\nthe right, the left. Anyhow, I couldn\u2019t make a very nice one, and the teacher always\ncomplained, this Madame [indecipherable]. And she said, why can\u2019t you write a\none as beautifully as you write a two? Because the two has those curly-curlies and I\nkind of like them, but the one, it was just too sharp for me. And I \u2014 and I say, w-will\nI live to the year 2000? And she said \u2014 she looked at me and she says, you? And \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001\ncause I was small, anemic and thin and she looks at me, says oh child, no, no. None\nof us will live to the year 2000. But then she says, why? Why do you want to live to\nthe year 2000? I said, well because you always praise my two and you always\ncomplain about \u2014 I didn\u2019t say complain, I don\u2019t remember what exactly I said \u2014 or\nbecause you love \u2014 you like my two and you don\u2019t like my one. So if \u2014 if it was the\nyear 2000, I always get a praise for you. And that\u2019s \u2014 and I was a thin, and then I \u2014\nvery anemic, had to drink this horrible fish liver oil and all that. You never \u2014 your\nchildren \u2014 I mean, this the ge \u2014 your generation didn\u2019t have to suffer from this fish\nliver oil, but we did. I sold it too, I\u2014 I paid my cousin, one of the cousins I was\nliving with to drink it for me. We put it first in the flower pots, but then we \u2014\neverybody knew there was a fish odor in the flower plants, but he loved it, so he was\njust gulping it. I think I paid him like a cent or something like that.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I was an avid reader, I always get prizes for reading nicely and reading\nmany books. And I used to misbehave to be able to stay after school, and the teacher\nalways would work in the library. And one day she says to me, now what 1s it with\nyou? Why do you \u2014 because that was a \u2014 for her it was a pain in the neck to have to\nhave this \u2014 watch this kid in the library all the time. And I said well, because I can\nread books. And she says, what? You can get all the books you want and you don\u2019t\nha \u2014 and I don\u2019t have to be here with you. And besides that, I returned to that village\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwhere I lived in the country when I was little and I had a cousin there. Well, actually,\nit was really a son of \u2014 of \u2014 of that aunt that brought me up. And he went to some\nkind of photograph school or something like that and here\u2019s this big box with books.\nAnd I looked in this \u2014 in this \u2014 one time he forgot to lock it, so I\u2014 I looked at \u2014 in,\nthere was this one book about legends or something and I started reading it. And I so\nloved it that I went through many books, which I can understand anyhow. But\nanyhow, ever since then I loved reading. I learned that you can have the whole world\nto yourself when you read books.",

And I said no-nothing to it, Pll never\ntake any German.",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see now, that was the year \u2014 see, there was already from 30 \u2014 what I\nknew it\u2019s from that atheistic uncle, he read the \u201cMein Kampf\u201d and he wa \u2014 had to \u2014\nand he was in the business of foreign exchange.

And they said\noh, what does this dumb Polack knows, you know, and all that kind of stuff. They\nwouldn\u2019t listen. And then I remember that during the war one of them, because he\nsaved some of them, he said, gosh, how ba \u2014 how dumb were we that we didn\u2019t\nlisten to you. Because they had the money, they could have gone away. But \u2014",
        "A: Jakub(ph). Very nice Christian name, too. Jakub Seftrik(ph).

        "A: Yeah, but more than that. I mean, she was overly religious, you know, she paid\nfor her childhood sins [indecipherable] maiden sins or whatever [indecipherable].\nBut anyhow, since my uncle, who \u2014 he ask us \u2014 he ask me \u2014 es \u2014 he kind of asked\nme things that I thought were kind of funny. And he says, do you think you would\nhave room for an old lady in your house? And I said, my mother can ope \u2014 for\nmoney my mother \u2014 for rent my mother can always find a room. So they made up \u2014\nwhat it really was, it was the family of this lady left, and they left this Jewish old\nlady alone with the cook. And so, my uncle made out that this lady was a nanny\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwhom the Jews left, and \u2014 and she was old and that\u2019s why this [indecipherable] the\ncook was taking care of her. Which in reality she was not. But the trouble with this \u2014\nso we took her in \u2014 other \u2014 my mother took her in, no-not knowing who she was.\nAnd I swore that I would never tell. And so in this [indecipherable] I was bringing\nfood and feeding and what kind of stuff. And I don\u2019t know what \u2014 she died\npeacefully, because I was taken to Germany, so I never went to the funeral or\nanything like that. But anyhow, she died peacefully in her bed. But the thing was that\nshe had to look Catholic, so I went to the \u2014 well, and the pri \u2014 th \u2014 my uncle says,\nyou have to buy her a rosary, cause all old Polish woman had the rosary, you know.\nAnd you have to teach her some prayers, so that she, you know \u2014 the trouble with\nher was that she was already a little deaf. And teaching her wasn\u2019t very easy. So I\nhave \u2014 I beny \u2014 I belong to the sodality, you know, as a servants of Mary, and I had\na couple girlfriends [indecipherable] kind of change, and by the time we\u2019re \u2014 well,\nshe finally learned how to say Halle(ph) Mary, and what\u2019s this other one. No\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t even know how you say that in English. But anyhow, there\nare two prayers that you have to say for the rosary, and then you have to say the\n\u201cOur Father,\u201d [indecipherable] the \u201cOur Father.\u201d But anyhow \u2014 but she finally\ngot it and all she did was sitting on this bed with this rosary in her hand and saying\nthis rosary all the time. And \u2014 but I was \u2014 I was okay. But she never talked much\nabout Jewishness, because she was one of those Gentile \u2014 I mean, Polandized\nFebruary 2, 2001\nJewish, you know. And besides, she was deaf, so when you had to talk to her, you\nhad to shout and you really couldn\u2019t get any \u2014 she would say, huh? What?",
        "A: Oh, it must have been in 30 \u2014 \u201933 or I\u2014no, it must have been \u201933 when my uncle\ngot this \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d cause they were selling it in \u2014 so 1t must have been in 30 \u2014\nbefore \u00b033.",
        "A: Well, my uncle always said that he wasn\u2019t \u2014 he was a tyrant and he was\ndangerous, that\u2019s all he was always saying, but he didn\u2019t explain the book to me and\nall anything like that. But he says that this man means trouble for Poland, that\u2019s\nwhat he said. And our f \u2014 now tho \u2014 1n those days he didn\u2019t mean much to me and\nexcept that that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to learn any German because that had a\nconnections with him and my father said you \u2014 you learn the language of your\nenemy.

And\nthe way for them to make a living was to give German lessons. And so then\neverybody wanted to help them, and [indecipherable] then I realized that my father\nwas right. So I took the lessons from someone, a lady, and then \u2014 then there were no\nmore Polish schools, so there were all \u2014 people were trying to get some kind of\nschooling for their children. And because in Krakow there are lots of Poles of\nGerman descent, or Austrian descent, so they \u2014 they said, you can\u2019t just leave those\nchildren out of two \u2014 two classes of high school. We have to have something else. So\nthey had some kind of petition and they change, because the academic high schools\nwere all over, they were all finished, but they \u2014 they turned \u2014 they started a new\nschool for kindergarten teachers. And so we went to school underground for normal\nclasses to continue our high school, but on top we were doing all this getting ready\nto be kindergarten teachers.",

        "A: Yeah, life \u2014 for me went on normally because I went to the same \u2014 with the same\npeople, I knew those same girls. And personally, I didn\u2019t. I lived in a \u2014 how shall I\nsay it, you know, a place where \u2014 I-I didn\u2019t \u2014 I mean, I was never there where\nprobably the action was, and there weren\u2019t any new index and index was the \u2014\nthere\u2019s this \u2014 th-they call this national [indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff.\nBut I never associated with them or anything like that, so I really didn\u2019t notice it.\nAnd \u2014",

        "A: Well, I first remember \u2014 well, the first re \u2014 memories is on the big marketplace,\nthe Germans came in and set up their tents, the soldiers then started shaving and\nwashing and all that kind of stuff. So Krakow was left alone because they thought\nit\u2019s \u2014 you know, they \u2014 it\u2019s a beautiful city and they wanted it as probably their\ncapitol. They didn\u2019t even steal the golden domes from the churches. And so I \u2014 I\nonly saw the regular young men washed and shave and all that kind of stuff. And a\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbunch of my Jewish boys who were talking to them and asking them question\nbecause they were \u2014 you know, they were \u2014 they were the ones who knew German.\nAnd we\u2019re \u2014 so 1f we wanted to know something, we say ask him why this and all\nthat sort of thing. But there was no terror, there was no \u2014 terror started when the\neinsatz \u2014 wh-when \u2014 after the soldiers came, the Einsatztruppen(ph), that\u2019s when\nall those things started. And that\u2019s what is big about the difference between the\nRoman Catholic Poles and the Mosaic Poles started to blew up, and the big signs on\nthe kiosks came that all Jews have to report and that no Pole is allowed to work for a\nJew or any Jewish store, or in the Jewish household. And later on that any Pole\ncaught helping a Jew or giving him food or shelter would be shot and all that kind of\nstuff. So people started being afraid.",

And \u2014 but that\u2019s \u2014 but I knew about\nAuschwitz immediately what \u2014 because the first day, that first day that they \u2014 war\nwas over, they started rounding up Polish intelligentsia and shipping them off.

And they didn\u2019t give a\ndarn whether the teacher was a Jew or Pole, as long as he was a teacher, they just\nwanted to do away with the people who can stand against them or start trouble or\nanything like that.

        "A: Ah yeah, because in the first place there was this big thing that no \u2014 no Pole can\nget into the ghetto, there\u2019s gonna be a \u2014",
        "A: Big sign, that\u2019s it, there\u2019s gonna be a ghetto and that no Jew can live outside of it,\nand every Jew who lives on the outside has to come in. And of course in our street\nthere \u2014 there were quite a few of them. And on the corner of my street 1t was this \u2014\noh yeah, that\u2019s how I really know about this, because in the corner of our street, in a\nFebruary 2, 2001\nhouse, there was this janitress, and she took in a Jewish boy. She \u2014 one of the boys\nwho lived in her house, and all the \u2014 some Poles said to her, why do you keep this\nJewish bastard in your house? And she said \u2014 why are you raising this Jewish\nbastard in your house? That\u2019s about the anti-Semitism that I heard. And she said, I\nam not raising a bastard, I am raising my future son-in-law. And 1s \u2014 and then she\nsays, if you say anything about it, I know about every one of you something, that if\nyou betray me, I do the same, I pay you back. So that nobody did. Now I really don\u2019t\nknow what happened, but somebody said they did get married. But \u2014 but anyhow, I\nremember like today, you know, somebody was saying something, do you know that\nshe keeps the Jewish child? And to me that was nothing, I mean, there were Jewish\nchildren all over. And \u2014 but she called bastard, and I say, that\u2019s a not nice word to\nsay. And she said, now remember how I said, that\u2019s not a bast \u2014 Jewish bastard,\nthat\u2019s my future son-in-law. So \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Not from my street.",
        "A: That\u2019s a \u2014 Slowacki alley. It\u2019s really Natuvieza(ph), which is a side street of this\n\u2014 th-there\u2019s this huge alley \u2014 alleys \u2014 not alleys, avenues, they\u2019re called Avenues of\nFebruary 2, 2001\nthe Three Poets, and my poet was Slowacki, so the beautiful houses and all that. So\nthe smart ones already left, and the pru \u2014 I never seen any, to tell you the truth,\nhouses of poor Jews. So the ones like they had in [indecipherable] and all that kind\nof stuff. The only \u2014 the only poor \u2014 well, I really didn\u2019t see, because even the one \u2014\nmy friends, they were all shop owners, so they had very comfortable houses, and \u2014",
        "A: No. Because what happened is that I moved from Dembiniki(ph) to this other\npart of the city and by the time I went to Dembiniki(ph) again, they were already\ngone. So I couldn\u2019t. And one of them, the Cohen girl, they ar \u2014 they \u2014 just the day\nbefore the war broke out, she le \u2014 they left for America. And I was \u2014 and when she\nsays, we\u2019re going to America, and I said, what for? And I had absolutely no idea,\nyou know, I mean, I know that my uncle said Hitler was a tyrant and all that kind of\nstuff and it\u2019s bad luck for Poland, but I had no idea what they going to be doing.\nThen of course, with this lady is in Auschwitz and all this, but I had no \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, he was a prisoner of war.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm, and he was a \u2014 yeah, he was a prisoner of war and then he was\nreleased and came home and was kind of half broken. My mother was always a bad\nfeeling about 1t because Polish army was in dira \u2014 array, and so he \u2014 all of a sudden,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI think must have been September two or three, she says, what are you doing here?\nAnd he says, well, I can\u2019t find my company. And the next neighbor was a young\nwoman whose hu-husband was a waiter, and she said, oh, this old man is coming\nhome and my poor husband has been taken prisoner. And so my m \u2014 or something\nlike that. And so my mother says, go back and look for your company. And so he\ngets on this bicycle and he bicycled off to the front and got taken prisoners. So I\nthink he felt guilty all the time, you know. She looked for him and she found him in\nsome POW camp and make eye \u2014 made eyes at the German guards to let her drop\nstuff for him after \u2014 first they looked what\u2019s there, so there\u2019ll be no weapons,\nanything like that. And then she cried, but she says why, he got this big package, it\nwas like a bag, he distributed all the bread and the stuff, he gave them to the other\nprisoners. And she says, and I worked the whole month to get this for him. But I \u2014 I\nsaid I couldn\u2019t im \u2014 really imagine that he would just eat 1t by himself while the\nothers were hungry.",
        "A: Yeah, he was in \u2014 intern \u2014 he went to Hungary where the Polish army was\ndestroy, he went with the other ones through Hungary and then from Hungary to\nFrance, because at that time France was \u2014 and then when France fell, they were\nvery lucky to have a general, a commanding general, Prugar-Ketling, a very nice\nFebruary 2, 2001\nPolish name, who led them from southern France to Switzerland and they laid their\narms at the Swiss border, and they were all interned for the duration of the war.",
        "A: Well, at that time I didn\u2019t see anything, I was so \u2014 I - really, I didn\u2019t think much.\nI do \u2014 I don\u2019t remember much, okay, because I was just looking for this certain\nhouse to meet this certain person. I noticed that it was cramped. That\u2019s the\nimpression that I have that \u2014 that here was a guy who owned this \u2014 this beautiful\nbookstore and all of a sudden he has this one room with three or four other people.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t do anything, I jump off the streetcar, and in the ghetto.",
        "A: Into the ghetto. And if you\u2019re at a certain point you can jump off and you were in\nthe ghetto. And bi \u2014 children \u2014 I mean, I was very small, I really was, at 14 years old,\n15.",
        "A: You would have to go through a \u2014 yeah, yeah, I would have to go through a gate.\nBut I didn\u2019t have to go through a gate because I jumped off, so that I \u2014 there were \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t see any guards. So the same way all the other boys who went outside or inside\nFebruary 2, 2001\ngot in the streetcar or \u2014 and of course the Polish streetcar drivers knew that we were\ndoing this, so they even slowed down a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Just this \u2014 I was kind of scared a little bit, okay, to begin with. And then I went to\ndifferent houses, but except for \u2014 1t was not al \u2014 enou \u2014 enough time for them to get\nso hungry that you could spot it. All you did \u2014 all I saw was overcrowding. That \u2014\nand that people just like \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, but I \u2014 I \u2014 I would just \u2014 then they are \u2014 would deliver them on the other\nside, to the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 same person.",
        "A: Oh yeah, but not \u2014 I never knew any names or who and all that. Ther-There was\njust one point that they all would \u2014 you know, that gentleman, I don\u2019t even know\nwhat he look like any more, it was an elderly gentleman. And I don\u2019t know what you\nlook like, but anyhow, bi \u2014 h-he \u2014 I would give it to him and he would distribute it.\nBut he never was on a col \u2014 0-on the envelope, the names and to whom it was, it was\nFebruary 2, 2001\nalways on the inside. So \u2014 and they all had kind of funny names too, because one\ntime I looked in one of those things, and the names were like \u2014",
        "A: False name, Roosevelt, and \u2014 in Polish, you know, and all kinds of false\n[indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, the next change was that they closed the school, they \u2014 because they\ndiscovered that we were going underground. And some \u2014 well, th-the \u2014 all there was\n[indecipherable] map of Poland or anything like that on the books or notebooks.\nAnd so lots of people didn\u2019t see any use of tearing off the maps, cause all Polish\nbooks \u2014 notebooks rather, had this po \u2014 map of Poland and then something on one\nside wi \u2014 and some historical dates on the others that the kids could rem \u2014 that was\nthe way of teaching, too. And they did say that it was forbidden. And I don\u2019t know,\none time came this German inspection and they found some kid with a \u2014 with this\nmaps and they said that\u2019s it. So they closed this school. And then \u2014 but then the\nparents went again, you know, and after we finished this kindergarten thing, the\nparents were thinking, what else can we do? And then the Germans needed people\nwho spoke German to help them govern this new kingdom of theirs. And they\nFebruary 2, 2001\nneeded people to \u2014 to do their commercial things. So they opened this school, wi \u2014 it\nwas called the preparatory school for \u2014 preparatory commercial school from higher\npreparatory school commerci \u2014 oh, it gos \u2014 anyhow, the name was so long that it\nhardly got on the thing. But then that \u2014 we didn't finish that \u2014 yeah, so we did finish\nthat, but before we finished this, came Germans into the school and pulled some of\nus out, because they were looking for children who were talented for languages. Is\nthere any \u2014 and they did that all over Krakow in many schools, so that who \u2014\nbecause they needed this workforce and they needed somebody who knew Polish\nand German. And so they send me to a three [indecipherable] in the German school.\nIt was like \u2014 like three months long, where we learn German and typewriting, typing\nand shorthand. So that\u2019s the next schooling I got.",
        "A: Law \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long, was three months and I just got this paper, 1t was\nkind of orange thing and it said in work, and that\u2019s when I was called, maybe the\nnext day.",
        "A: To be s \u2014 go to a transit camp and then go to a\u2014 to Germany.",
        "A: Course.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: And I was to be working \u2014 oh yeah, and I was to be working in a agricultural\nbank.",
        "A: In Krakow. But this \u2014 the Gestapo needed workers, and since I was one of the\nbest students, they switched it and send me to this Gestapo school. Not Gestapo\nschool but with this \u2014 to type for this guy, for this Gestapo man.",
        "A: This is still in Krakow. But when I was in this German school, the man, the\nteacher was one of those ger \u2014 Germans who would \u2014 cou \u2014 would do away with all\nforeign words in German and just put all the Germanic words. So that when we were\ntalking about comma, we called them bystreek(ph). And when I went to take\ndictation for this Gestapo man, e-every time that he said comma, cause he was an old\nAustrian, every time he \u2014 he used the word comma, but it is written with a K in\nGerman, I wrote komma. So then I typed it out and I gave it to him, you see? You\ncan just imagine what this piece looked like. And so he \u2014 he looks at it and he says\nder Polisher(ph) schweine. And I just learned the word ferkel, which means also a\nsw \u2014 literally a swine in German. And I say u-un(ph) du bist in Pr-Preussischer\nferkel ond(ph). You are a Prussian pig. And then \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah, and I [indecipherable] idea, you know, what I was doing really, I just was\noffended that he called me a Polisher(ph) swine. And \u2014 and I run out, and he got up\nand he run after me. But before that, we used to, before we had this Jewish lady\nduring the war, we had a Ukrainian law student living with us. And I met her right\nwhen the war broke out and Poland lost and she says, now listen, you were so nice\nto me, so whenever you\u2019re in trouble, you come to see me, because I will \u2014 I\u2019m a big\nfish now at the German labor office in Krakow. So if you need any help \u2014 so when I\nrun out, I remember this girl and I runned \u2014 and I run to the \u2014 to \u2014 to the arbeitsamt\nand I told \u2014 told her what happened. I didn\u2019t tell her how I called him, but I said I got\nin trouble with him. And she says, don\u2019t go home, go to one of your friends. Can you\nthink of a friend when I can contact you? And I said \u2014I give her a name of a girl.\nUnfortunately, this girl lived by the railroad station, the street \u2014 you want to stop?\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nFebruary 2, 2001\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: And so I w \u2014 and she said, now don\u2019t go, and she s \u2014 so I went to this\n[indecipherable] street, which 1s right by the railroad station, that\u2019s the transit route\nto the \u2014 every Polish village and town had to deliver a certain amount of people for\nwork to Germany. And so there was columns of slave work \u2014 future slave workers\ngoing by that street, and they always counted them before they entered the railroad\nstation, and if there were some missing, they would close off one of the streets and\ncaught anybody \u2014 catch anybody who didn\u2019t have a papers. And I don\u2019t know how I\ndidn\u2019t have that little paper with me.",
        "A: That day, yeah. And \u2014 and you could not be on the street without a working\npaper. I mean, 1-if you were, that\u2019s \u2014 and you got caught, that\u2019s it, cause they were\nafter getting as many people as possible for work to Germany, because they needed\nlabor. And so this Nina went to my parents and my parents said she didn\u2019t come\nhome, she went to this girl. And she said, no, she never got here. So she \u2014 because\nshe knew the \u2014 how this all works, and she went to the transit camp. And I saw her\nFebruary 2, 2001\nand she fixed so up that I would go to a tobacco factory in Germany, that was easy\nwork. And that\u2019s how I got to this factory in Germany called Hanewacker, which\nwas making chewing tobacco.",
        "A: Uh-huh, January [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t re \u2014 quite remember what \u2014 whether it was January or February, but it was",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go home, and \u2014 and I didn\u2019t \u2014 no, I didn\u2019t go home, because I was\ncaught while I was going to my girlfriend\u2019s and that nobody really knew what\nhappened to me except for this woman, this lawyer who knew where I could\npossibly be, if I got caught.",
        "A: And so she just was so wonderful that she gave me this easy job. Or she could\nhave just let me \u2014",
        "A: No, no, not \u2014 I \u2014 they got a note from me when \u2014 when I was really in \u2014 in\nHanewacker in Germany.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I was frightened, but in a way it was an adventure and I knew German.\nSo I knew I\u2019m gonna get through with this. I mean, I\u2019m gonna get my\n[indecipherable] out somehow, okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, and another thing that happened to me was in that transit camp they\nwere cutting everybody\u2019s hair off, and I had pigtails. And I don\u2019t know why they\ndidn\u2019t cut my off. This lady \u2014 but I heard of something whisper, you know, and the \u2014\nmaybe she just took pity on me, and she didn\u2019t shore my head.",
        "A: No, I was like a child, I looked like a child, okay, so maybe that\u2019s why \u2014 I think\nthat\u2019s maybe why they took pity on me, I imagine.",
        "A: Of course I felt proud and I was scared, I mean yeah, cause I didn\u2019t know what I\nwas going. But on the other hand, this \u2014 this lady said \u2014 oh, oh yeah, I'll tell you why\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI wasn\u2019t scared, because after Poland and Germany had this pact of non-aggression,\nPolish textbooks in school didn\u2019t picture Germany as a horrible place. When you\nopen a \u2014 and my cousin studied German, okay, so they had those \u2014 those books and\nyou had just beautiful palaces and \u2014 and sights and all this. I mean, they \u2014 for some\nreason they did not \u2014 they changed a \u2014 they changed the way of teaching, and they\nwere not stressing the horrible ta \u2014 thing that it \u2014 Prussians did to Poland before. All\nthey was talking was beautiful Alps, beautiful Bavaria, beautiful Rhine river. And\nyou can see this Rhine river and the castles around it and this whole\n[indecipherable]. And so I really \u2014 how shall I say? I say, well finally I\u2019m gonna see\nthose things. Was ka \u2014 I had no idea that I\u2019Il never get out of a camp, but I mean, it\nwas a Slave labor camp and you \u2014 well, there was no way of [indecipherable] if we\nwere \u2014 but that\u2019s early on. But anyhow, I was \u2014 you know, I went away, it was like\nadventure. I didn\u2019t expect what was coming and god \u2014 thanks God, you know. I had\nno idea.",
        "A: No, nobody.",
        "A: I was to-totally alone, but then immediately the first thing they did 1s, did this\ndelousing, and you going with this hot bath, it almost burned you and all this kind of\nstuff, and already there you started looking for somebody you may like, to talk and\nFebruary 2, 2001\nsay what\u2019s going to happen to us, and this and that. Then somebody said, well\nnothing\u2019s going to happen, we\u2019re gonna go to work to Germany. And then \u2014",
        "A: Krakow.",
        "A: And whenever you\u2019re in a situation like that you always look for somebody that\nyou can hook up to \u2014 to \u2014 to have some kind of support or something, you know, and\nSO \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, no Jews. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know who they were, but then anyhow, I bet you they\nhad a selection later on. But \u2014 but I wa \u2014 didn\u2019t witness it. And then the girls \u2014",
        "A: Gee, I have no idea where it was.",
        "A: It\u2019s too far back \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to \u2014 to remember.",
        "A: Nothing. I was all of a sudden \u2014 first we were in the regular trains. No, I don\u2019t\nknow. No, first we were in a kind of cattle trains and then they changed to regular\nFebruary 2, 2001\ntrains the minute we left Germany \u2014 Poland, and I was so disappointed with this\nGermany, you know, it was \u2014 1s dirty and the snow is dark and all this kind of stuff,\nyou know. I always think about those books with this beautiful sight, and here 1s this\n\u2014I mean, because I was to Silesia, you see, so which that\u2019s all industrial region, you\ndon\u2019t see a village or anything like that. And I said, wow. So, and finally we get to\nthis Hanewacker and to this station, and they started being very nice to us. Tow \u2014\ntoward civilians, whenever there were German civilians present, they changed their\nattitude, too, cause they didn\u2019t want the \u2014 I \u2014 I imagine they didn't want the civilians\nto know what they were really doing with people. And especially \u2014 probably too\nbecause we were all very young, and oh \u2014",
        "A: No, just women. And \u2014 really young girls. And it was night, and we got off,\ncarried all our bundles, and they didn\u2019t say raus like they usually said, you sh \u2014 they\nsaid ausweichen, which means, you know, get out, but not in a very \u2014 1n a nasty\nway. And we just walk and walk and walk and then we arrive at this factory. Oh\nyeah, and then we \u2014 they let us in and it was lights, it was like oh, thanks God, cause\nwe were already hungry and thirsty. And we went to this room tha \u2014 it was like a\ncafeteria or a dining room or something like that. And that\u2019s when I knew about\nwhat\u2019s happening to the Jews, because when I got there \u2014 when we got there, there\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwas a group of girls with yellow covers on their head, what do you call those thing?\nIf you have to wear it, like \u2014",
        "A: No, not a kerchief.",
        "A: Not a bandana, like a doctor\u2019s wear, what do they wear?",
        "A: Cap, something like that, and they had yellow caps. White smocks and yellow\ncaps. And you know, I was inquisitive, so I wanted to s \u2014 they were like giving up\ntheir dishes, getting ready to go, as they went by this thing and some of them \u2014 every\none of them that I watch were putting away the dishes. And I wanted to go to them\ncause I wanted to find out well, what is this place like? And the guard says no, no,\nverboten, those are Jews. And I \u2014 when d \u2014 he said Jews, Jewish girls, I said well,\nthat\u2019s good, then I can\u2019t \u2014 and so I went to them, I mean when he turned around, and\nI started talking Polish. [indecipherable] And they \u2014",
        "A: They didn\u2019t answer, and finally they called somebody, here comes this lady and\nsays in Polish \u2014 she also has this yellow thing on her head. And she says, what do\nyou want from them? And I say, how come they don\u2019t speak any Polish if they\u2019re\nJews? And she says, because they are Jewish girls from Vienna and they don\u2019t know\nFebruary 2, 2001\nany Polish. That was an eye opener. [indecipherable] was right there, there are other\nJews that are not Polish. And sa \u2014 and I am \u2014 I say, oh \u2014 she says \u2014 I say, what\u2019s with\nthe \u2014 what are they so afraid of? Because you came and you\u2019re gonna be replacing\nthem and they\u2019re going to Poland. And I said, well they would love it here, I mean\nPoland. There\u2019s so many Jews in Poland. My hometown every fifth person is a Jew.\nAnd she looks at me, you know, like that, and says child, child, they\u2019re not going \u2014\nthey\u2019re going probably to die there. I just couldn\u2019t believe it, you know, I said why?\nPeople who follow every blessed God\u2019s commandment and there\u2019s a hundreds of\nthem. How? I mean, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. But I met her couple of days after,\nbecause they were the ones who were dishing out the food, you know. So I say, have\nyou heard from your friends? And she said no, they were someplace in Poland, so\nthey probably died. But that was the first time that I knew of the fate of the Polish\nJews \u2014 not Polish Jews, but I mean Jews. And I got a history lesson th-that isn\u2019t such\na n-not all Poles of Mosaic faith don\u2019t speak Polish. And so that was an eye opener,\nreally an eye opener. Cause you have to imagine, I was inquisitive and I say\n[indecipherable]. And \u2014 but they looked at us, because we\u2019re skinny an-and they\nwere going out. And they knew that the minute we come, they\u2019Il be gone. And here I\ntelling about all this, how they love Jews in Poland and how they\u2019re gonna love it,\nthat every fifth person is a Jew. I mean \u2014 I mean, I have ta \u2014 absolutely no idea. I\ndon\u2019t know whether I was dumb or naive, or \u2014 or \u2014 or I just lived in another world or\nFebruary 2, 2001\ns \u2014 what. But it \u2014 it was an eye opener. And the first shocking news about the\ndestruction of Jewry. That was the first time that I really \u2014 and this lady whenever\nshe saw me, cause she was like a leader of those gir \u2014 Viennese girls, you know, she\njust always look at me like that, you know, and what could I tell her?",
        "A: Oh yeah, she was a Jewish woman.",
        "A: Well, th \u2014 she left too, later, but not too long after that. After the last girls left, she\nleft too. She gave me a lesson. She really opened my \u2014 you know, when you\u2019re\nyoung and you\u2019re sheltered by parents, they \u2014 you don\u2019t really realize what\u2019s going\non because you have th \u2014 all those childish things in your mind and boyfriends and\nthis and that and books, and you don\u2019t really take part in what\u2019s going on. And that\nwas the first lesson that I got. And then of course in that factory there are \u2014 the\nsecond time that I really at \u2014 felt guilty. First time I felt guilty that I didn\u2019t do\nsomething for this Eva Kriseberg(ph), because my uncle could have pulled her out.\nAnd I didn\u2019t get in touch with her and I don\u2019t know just why I didn\u2019t get in touch\nwith her, just because she scare me, she says, go away, go away. And th \u2014 and she\nsays, we don\u2019t live in our \u2014 I say where are your parents, where do you live? She\nsays, we don\u2019t live in this pla \u2014 in our place any more. We lived in this compound.\nAnd so I felt so guilty then, in this Hanewacker comes this big mass \u2014 big\nFebruary 2, 2001\nsupervisor and couple Gestapo men, and come to this girl. And he calls her\nsomething like Miss Ringelbaum(ph) or something like that. And she says, oh, I\u2019m\nnot Ringelbaum(ph), I\u2019m Kratkauska(ph), and he says yeah, we know who you\nare. And they took her. Because there were \u2014 you know, it\u2019s easy for a Jewish girl\nthat looks \u2014 doesn\u2019t look \u2014 I just \u2014 I really don\u2019t know what that means to look\nJewish, to tell you the truth. It always baffled me, how you can tell, you know. But\nbecause I lived together, I just didn\u2019t see any difference. And they have taken her\nand I felt so helpless. Just the day that I saw Eva going with this broom through the\nsnow, I mean, this was \u2014 just nothing you can do, cause there\u2019s always some soldiers\nbehind you.",
        "A: Is a Jewish girl passing as a Polish girl, yeah. And somebody must have betray\nher or denounced her. And then somebody said, she\u2019s not the only one. So we knew\nthere were other ones, but then \u2014 see, the idea was to act Catholic, say all the crosses\nand all this kind of stuff and \u2014 and say Jesus, Mary all the time. I mean, there was a\nway of \u2014 there was a way of keeping \u2014 passing, but then sometimes \u2014 but if you\ncame from a Hasidic home, you couldn\u2019t. There was no way. Cause first you got this\nidea to betraying your religion, betraying your parents, your grandparents. But \u2014 so\nthat\u2019s a shi \u2014 there was no way for a Hasidic girl to get safe. But there were those\nwho were hiding and there were \u2014 but that \u2014 that was one of the ways, you could\nFebruary 2, 2001\nalways pray and say prayers and Jesus, Mary and all this, and \u2014 what you felt in\nyour heart was a different story. And then I ask one girl, I say, y-you don\u2019t have \u2014 do\nyou s \u2014 sometimes think that you\u2019re doing the wrong thing? And she says no, we all\npray to the same God. And the same thing was, when I first started teaching this\nJewish lady, pau \u2014 saying the prayers, some \u2014 some \u2014 I went to the priest and I say \u2014\nbecause I thought I was doing bad thing converting this Jewish lady, teaching her\nPolish prayers, Catholic prayers. And so I went to this priest and I said \u2014 I took \u2014 you\ncan go to confession and you know, and all that, and he says, well, confess your sins.\nAnd I said, well, I have this woman big \u2014 and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sin or not, and I\nwas telling him that, you know, I was teaching this Catholic prayers to a woman who\nwas Jewish, and was this a sin. And he says oh no, no, no, you\u2019Il be saving her life,\nno. So he give me a blessing and told me to say three Holy Mary\u2019s and that thing\nwas over. So I thought that meant, because then I really knew that when she says we\nall believe in one God, so who \u2014 who \u2014 what does it matter. But \u2014",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t telling him hiding, I was telling him I was teaching her. But I was\nteaching her Catholic prayers, then he says [indecipherable] were you successful?\nAnd I said, not very, cause the lady\u2019s deaf. And he was the one who said, well get\nsome girlfra \u2014 don\u2019t you have any other friends who could teach her?\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: It\u2019s a chewing tobacco factory.",
        "A: Well, when you chew \u2014 when you make chewing tobacco there\u2019s this \u2014 takes two\npeople, one if \u2014 one that lays, dry strips of tobacco leaves, they kind of small ones.\nAnd then after them goes the fellow who puts \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it is, but they put\n\u2014 they cut up the tobacco, put it in some kind of prune juice to make it sweet, and\nthen you go and you \u2014 a-and you put that stuff on top \u2014 no, behind him and he goes\nand he takes a piece of this horrible chewing stuff and puts it on the leaf, and he rolls\nit into it, and it comes like a little sausage, continuous sausage and he just rolls it in.\nHe gets to the end of it and he puts it on some kind of wheel and the thing starts\nanew. And then they put this tobacco sausage into this \u2014 into this syrup and it gets\ncooked, and then \u2014 then they get it out again and they cut it in very tiny pieces, and\nthen, this was supposed to help the war effort, because thi-this tobacco, that you\ndon\u2019t smoke it, you chew it. This 1s like a spitting \u2014 well, one time I saw somebody\nusing it here, too, urch. But anyhow, one thing we learned, that you cannot eat it,\nalthough was s-sweet, because a \u2014 one of us got sick from it. But, so I was doing\nthat, and then one day \u2014",
        "A: No, just those, that was \u2014",
        "A: That was that one group and there\u2019re no more Jews \u2014 Jewish girls from any place\ncoming. There was \u2014 they were get \u2014 getting us. And then we also said, we-ell, after\nthey \u2014 after them we\u2019ll go away because they were [indecipherable] girls coming,\nso we thought, oh, they\u2019re gonna do with us the same thing they did with the Jewish\ngirls, but they didn\u2019t. So \u2014 but we were all so scared to death then, cause we thought\nwell, we\u2019re the next ones.",
        "A: I don\u2019t really remember, food was never very important to me, but I think \u2014 oh,\nno, no, we didn\u2019t, but there were always the civilian Germans who would sneak food\nfor us. Like, 1f you had this woman, or the man for whom you worked, and\nespecially if you spoke their language, they would always help you. I remember the\nfirst time there was \u2014 I had this man \u2014 boy, who \u2014 hm, I don\u2019t know how we got\ntogether with this boy there. I was working for him, or he \u2014 but anyhow \u2014 or th \u2014 he\nworker for z \u2014 on the other table. But anyhow he says to me one day, look in that \u2014\non that shelf and \u2014 and sometimes we would talk to \u2014 I would talk to this boy and I\nwas telling him how the Germans were horrible in Poland and all this kind of stu \u2014\nand \u2014 and he \u2014 I thought he was gonna \u2014 and I told him how I love books and I can\u2019t\nfind the books. So I thought he gave me a book. And it turned out to be a piece of\ncake from his mother, and he says, that\u2019s from my mother. And then there \u2014 the\nother guys started making fun, that he was in love with me, so the mother, who was a\nFebruary 2, 2001\nspinner took him away and he was helping her and I got some \u2014 and I was helping\nsome other men. But anyhow, sometimes, you know, they would put something for\nyou in the \u2014 or give you something. And later on they ask us to come to their house\nand there was this big \u2014 big sign that says fraternization with the Poles is forbidden,\ndon\u2019t you ever have them at your table and all that. But the way they went around\nthis, that they would say, we need worker in my house, or in my garden. Because\nmost of these people were in a small farm [indecipherable] and all that, so they\nneeded help. And I heard one woman that, I don\u2019t know how I got to talking about\nsmoked fish. And I says oh, I\u2019m dreaming of that smoked fish [indecipherable]\nsmoked fish and scruts(ph) and all that. And he says, you dreaming about that? And\nI say yeah, because I\u2019m hungry. And wa \u2014 he said, you know, when we get the\nsmoked fish on rations, then you \u2014 I \u2014 you come to my house. And I said, didn\u2019t you\nsee this where it says no \u2014 and they said \u2014 and I said, the only way you can get me is\nto say you need a help to work [indecipherable] every house in Germany had this\nsupervisor was a Hitlerjugend \u2014 I mean a Hitler \u2014 a Nazi party woman that watched\nover the houses so nothing happened. So when we heard this woman coming, I\nalways went on the floor, you know, and pretended to be pu \u2014 shi \u2014 shining it or\nscrubbing it, whatever it was, you know. But there were people who almost, you\nknow, I was just pure lucky, we all were pure lucky, and that\u2019s why I wrote this\nbook, because when my father [indecipherable] this conversation, I said no, not all\nFebruary 2, 2001\nGermans were brutal, cruel and all that. It was the system, but there were some good\npeople, ah ba-ba-ba-ba, so that\u2019s why this whole book came about, but \u2014",
        "A: No, in the ha \u2014 Hanewacker was the name of the factory and it was the town of\nNordhausen.",
        "A: Mm-hm, that was in Nordhausen.",
        "A: We lived in a barracks and the first \u2014 when we got there \u2014 when I got up in the\nmorning, the first \u2014 cause you had to get \u2014 there were three stories of beds \u2014 I mean,\nthree tiers of beds, I didn't know how to get up on them. Course, everybody got the f\n\u2014 you know, the ground floor. I g \u2014 I \u2014 there must have been a [indecipherable] they\njust pushed me up and said, now finally. But early in the morning, I wanted to\npractice coming down, how to \u2014 not to trample on the girl under me. And I went to\nthe window and it was somebody closing the window. Th-There were \u2014 not the\nwindows, but the \u2014",
        "A: Shutters. And the guy kind of, you know, beckoned me to look out. And he says\nto me, look \u2014 look at the world before I lock you up. And \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know\nwhether I should say I understand what he is saying or not, because at that time I\nFebruary 2, 2001\ndidn\u2019t know whether it was good to say you know it, or it\u2019s better to be quiet so you\nknow what they gonna do with him. And so I said \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, like that. Turn out that this man was the supervisor of the barracks,\nkind of physical supervisor, you know. And so we all \u2014 he was so good we all called\nhim Opa, which means grandfather in German. And so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s how it was and\nthen you had to get up, I don\u2019t know how \u2014 what time in the morning and\n[indecipherable] for this breakfast. Oh yeah, and there were no toilets, toilets were\nalso in the barrack, a separate barrack. And were not \u2014 not toilets, was just a hole in\na \u2014 you know, kind of a hole in the ground and \u2014 but \u2014 and the toilet paper were\npieces of little newspaper, I read that a little bit, at least it was something.",
        "A: No, we were \u2014 oh yeah, you \u2014 no, we had our own cl \u2014 and thanks God I had my\nwinter coat, which was woolen, and \u2014 but they gave us smocks, so that you \u2014\nwhatever you were \u2014 you always wore a white smock and a little thi \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, own, yeah. Although they did still \u2014 although I think they gave us a pair of\nthose wooden \u2014",
        "A: Clogs, yeah.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: I think I was, yeah.",
        "A: No, no. We just use anything we could. But \u2014 or maybe they \u2014 no, they didn\u2019t. I\ndon\u2019t think they did.",
        "A: We used toilet paper and all kind of stuff.",
        "A: Janu \u2014 February \u2014 hm, I think 1t was May, because that\u2019s where we got kicked out\nbecause in the [indecipherable] factory, we were together with the British POWs.",
        "A: Yeah, also. And they were the wounded at Dunkirk, so they couldn\u2019t do any \u2014\nthey were not supposed to be working anyhow, but they were working doing easy\nwork. And of course we were flirting with them and passing letters and all that.",
        "A: No. And \u2014 no. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, letters, there were letters and then later on when I \u2014 later on when I \u2014 well,\nwhen I worked for this private ana \u2014 f-firm, I used to send the letters through this\nFebruary 2, 2001\nlady. She would send my letters to Poland and I would receive the letters to her\nhouse.",
        "A: Yes, I have the correspondence. But anyhow \u2014",
        "A: POWs, and then we always \u2014 we had to wear this P on our things and we always\n\u2014 once \u2014 if we behave we would be given a Sunday off. I don\u2019t know how many, one\nSunday a month or something like that.",
        "A: Well, it was a yellow background with a purple P on it, and you had to wear it\nlike on your heart, and all that kind of stuff. But of course you can always cover it up\nwith a scarf. So when we went out, we always covered that with a scarf or we ripped\nit off.",
        "A: Yeah, it was supposed to be sewn on.",
        "A: Awful, I mean I \u2014",
        "A: Why? Because I [indecipherable] you feel like you\u2019re subhuman or something,\nwas the time to humiliate you, just like there was the Star of David, that\u2019s just\nFebruary 2, 2001\nexactly the same thing. And \u2014 but with at \u2014 with it you couldn\u2019t go anyplace, and we\njust found out that \u2014 oh yeah, and of course this \u2014 this man whom we call Opa, next\n\u2014 across the street from that camp, those barracks, there was a \u2014 not a restaurant, but\nkind of joint and he said, will you be coming by? Bring me a beer. And so we would\ngo and bring him a beer and we always \u2014 and he would never look at our passes,\nwhether they \u2014 cause you had to have a pass. Sometimes we had a pass that was\nalready a month old, you know. But he never \u2014 but he told us to watch out for other\nguys, if there\u2019s somebody else, to be very careful and all that. Well, anyhow, we\ntrespassed the law of the camp many a many times and finally we got kicked out of\nthis ammu-ammunition factory, Schmidt and Kranz, with \u2014 which was really\nworking for the metal -- metalwerker(ph) which was making those V-Is and V-2s\nlater on.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Well, in the first place we were going out without a \u2014 a \u2014 without this P, without\nthe \u2014 you know, the sign that we are Poles. And then we were flirting with the\nFebruary 2, 2001\nBritish prisoners and sending and receiving letters and then there were some German\nwomen who were corresponding with the [indecipherable] so we \u2014 oh, we did them\nfavors too, and all this and well, anyhow \u2014",
        "A: No, I have absolutely no idea how dangerous. The first time that I was \u2014 this is \u2014\nwe were four people, four girls, and one of them says, what would I do to be in a real\nrestaurant? And so we said, why not? We could, since we have a Sunday off we\ncould get dressed. But we really didn\u2019t have good shoes and all that. But since we\nknew the German women who are flirting with the British, we could \u2014 we thought\nwe ca\u2014 we could possibly ask them to help us, you know? And so I said, can you\nborrow \u2014 can I borrow a pair of shoes of \u2014 from you? And she said, what for? And I\nsaid, well, Janka has this idea \u2014 or Hedwig was her na \u2014 real name, Hedwig has this\nidea that she would love to go to a good German restaurant and we saw, on our way\nto church we saw this restaurant. And she says no, you could never go there because\nthat\u2019s all this Nazi cra \u2014 cream goes to that restaurant, they would immediately\nrecognize a s-stranger. If you really want to go, you can go to some kind of a little\ncaf\u00e9 or a konditori(ph) which 1s this \u2014 he serves coffee and also serves cakes. And\nyou could go to something like that. There, nobody will notice it \u2014 notice you. So \u2014\nbut, I mean, there\u2019s no way for you to be successful going to a fine restaurant, but\nthis girl is just dreaming of going to a fine restaurant after all these crummy meals\nFebruary 2, 2001\nand barracks and all this. And so \u2014 and then one time \u2014 what we didn\u2019t know is that\nNordhausen was this forbidden place where they were making those \u2014 before they\nstarted making V-1s, V-2s, there were underground galleries where they making\nbombers and practicing inventions or, I mean, trying out stuff.",
        "A: No, I was not aware. So those two girls got a bicycle. Now, there was this bice \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how this happened, but those two girls, since the Germans were so\nhelpful, you know, th-this \u2014 oh no, this \u2014 some \u2014 this \u2014 one of the girls says, I would\nso love to get on a bicycle, and she says, oh you can take mine, the German woman\nsaid. And then \u2014 then the other one got a bicycle from somebody else and took off\nthe [indecipherable] and went. Except that they hadn\u2019t been on a bicycle for so long\nthat they were going like this, wa \u2014 left, right, left, right, and then the other girl was\nscared to fall off, so she was just pushing the bicycle. And the policeman saw her\ndoing it, and \u2014 and he wanted to help her. And then, while he was helping her, he\nsays, there\u2019s nothing wrong with this bicycle, but while she was getting up, she\nbrushed on her \u2014 he brushed on her coat and well, they both end up in jail, and they\nsaid \u2014",
        "A: He saw the P, okay. And there\u2019s the one time we got this idea of going out on the\nrailroad by a train, you know, just to see what it looks like outside of the barracks.\nFebruary 2, 2001\nAnd we asked this \u2014 a-again we made this mistake of asking a ticket to this place\nwhere the factory was, because we had no idea where it was. And \u2014 and I remember\nsaying two tickets \u2014 or sa \u2014 no, a round trip ticket. And the guy says \u2014 and there was\nthis [indecipherable] anyhow, they were \u2014 but, this factory didn\u2019t want to lose me\nbecause I was this interpreter, you know, so I \u2014",
        "A: No, they said, of course not. The woman who was selling me the ticket says, I\u2019m\nsorry, I didn\u2019t know they were Poles, they had tickets \u2014 I mean, they had Ps. I mean,\nthey looked so normal, we didn\u2019t think they were Poles, you know. But anyhow, so\nthat was on our \u2014 and so this grandpa s \u2014 was saying, watch out, this is the last time\nthat I can intervene for you. Because with the bicycle what happened, so she didn\u2019t\ncome in, she says, where is she? And I said, well, I don\u2019t know, she hasn\u2019t come in\nyet. So she called the police and she says, you wouldn\u2019t see a\u2014 you haven\u2019t seen a\nPolish girl with a yellow \u2014 a yel \u2014 a red \u2014 Polish redhead on a bicycle? She must me\n\u2014 mus \u2014 could have had an accident or some, was there \u2014 oh no, there was a Polish\nredhead on a accident or something. He says no, she\u2019s not 1n accident, she\u2019s in jail.\nAnd so, but then she came the next morning. But \u2014 and \u2014 but she swore that she just\ntook the bicycle, that she stole the bicycle. No, no, nots what she said, sh-she saw\nthis bicycle in the \u2014 outside the barracks and it was a broken bicycle and she fixed it.\nThat\u2019s what she lie. And the German woman was kissing her all over that she didn\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbetray her that she give her the bicycle, but \u2014 but anyhow, so then th \u2014 we already\nhad all this on our index, and they said that\u2019s it. And so that\u2019s how they push this in\nthe \u2014 send us to work. We really know that we are in a camp, and that was the nation",
        "A: Yeah, and \u2014",
        "A: I mean, it \u2014",
        "A: Few months, and then I went to this \u2014 we were sent to this mashee \u2014 machine\nammunition factory called Schmidt and Kranz \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in it \u2014 Nordhausen, and we \u2014 the factory was in town and the camp was on the\noutskirts and we had to walk every day. But at that \u2014 in the same camp where \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, because that was May. Yeah, yeah, something like that.",
        "A: May, yeah. And \u2014 yeah, first place the barracks were even worse than they were\nin Hanewacker. And there we were with the \u2014 supposed to be with the Russian\ngirls, and let\u2019s see, what else? But anyhow, it was horrible.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Well \u2014 well, we were doing all kind of metalwork and all that kind of stuff, you\nhad to put some kind of glasses to protect your eyes while you were doing all this\nthing. But, since they knew I spoke German, there was this old major who \u2014 who st \u2014\nin a cabin, he was trying out the bullets and all that kind of stuff. And they ute \u2014 they\nused me like a Girl Friday. If somebody was absent and the ammunition could not \u2014\nyou cannot stop this [indecipherable] because everybody was doing his little bit like\nin a \u2014 like in a car factory, you know, that you \u2014 everybody does the same work",
        "A: Yeah, assembly line. And so I would be sent \u2014 I would be sent where somebody\nwas missing, so that it goes on. And one day they send me with a letter to this booth,\nto this mayor \u2014 he was a major? Yeah, he was a major, kind of old guy. And of\ncourse he had this ear phones on him and was keep on shooting and I didn\u2019t know\nhow to get to him, so I just knock and knock and then finally I said, well, 1s the man\nof the house here or not? And well anyhow, somehow he heard me and I gave him\nthe message and he \u2014 while he was reading this he says, go and get me some coffee\nin the canteen, they had a canteen there, and biscuits, or some special cakes he\nwanted. But they didn\u2019t have it so I bought him this biscuit and I said, they didn\u2019t\nhave anything. And since then he always ask for me to bring him this coffee. So\nwhen I was \u2014 I was so dumb when \u2014 you couldn\u2019t believe it. In this \u2014 anyhow, since\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwe were \u2014 it was very important because we would meet the English \u2014 we had to \u2014\non the certain corner we would meet the English POWs and we would exchange the\nletters. It was absolutely necessary that one of \u2014 that one of his runs first and \u2014 and in\nthis factory you had to have those time sheets, you know, you have the time clock\nand you had to do the \u2014",
        "A: Punch in. And I was \u2014I was the fastest was \u2014 I was punching in for all four of\nthem. And I was doing this one day, somebody goes [coughs] and I look up and\nthere\u2019s this man looking down and he says, the big one would be the better one to do\nwhat you\u2019re doing. I said, I\u2019m not doing anything, but I was saying in German. And\nhe says, ah, if they catch you that you are cheating their factory o-of time for the four\nof you, you gonna wind yourself in a worse camp than the Schmidt and Kranz. And\nI said, well, she is carrying something. And at that time I don\u2019t know what she was\ncarrying, her shoes or something, I don\u2019t remember, but anyhow, it saved me. But,\ncouple of months after that \u2014",

        "A: Well, real names was Hedwig, Amalia(ph) and Aniela(ph) and what was the\nfourth one?",
        "A: Oh yeah, was me. Anyhow, so \u2014",
        "A: By Eva? Yeah. And anyhow, she \u2014 she came anyhow, so after a few months after\nthat, they got us this engineer and this engineer with some three civilians or\nsomething like that, through the hall. And they stop at my de \u2014 I was doing\nsomething with those \u2014 cutting some stuff. And took off the mask and this guy starts\ntalking to me, the civilian. But instead of as \u2014 waiting for my answers, he starts some\nother \u2014 you know, cuts another theme, I mean, asking a different question without\nwa \u2014 waiting for the answer. So he, after awhile he says to me in French, thank you\nfor you\u2019re an \u2014 thank you. And I say in French pas de quoi, you know. And so this\nengi-engineer says to him, didn\u2019t I tell you she speaks good engli \u2014 good German\u2019?\nAnd that\u2019s it. Then I\u2019m calling \u2014 called in the office and they said, would you like to\ngo and be a kitchen help in this man\u2019s \u2014 this 1s a private firm, but they getting\nconcentration camp people and Russian and God knows they had some Frenchmen\ntoo. And they need the \u2014 a trans \u2014 interpreter and they need a kitchen help. Well, to\nget out of this camp from under this woman that beat me up and all that \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: O-Oh yeah, because \u2014",
        "A: How did that happen? Well, the French who were working on the outside, the\nFrench civilians were providing f\u2014 if some \u2014 if the English wanted to escape \u2014 if the\nEnglish POWs wanted to escape, they needed I.D. cards, clothing, and all that kind\nof stuff, and tho \u2014 the French civilians who were delivering it. But we got this\nmessage that there\u2019ll be no delivery tonight. And we had to give this to \u2014 somehow\nlet the English prisoners of war know. But we were in contact with the girls who\nwere still staying in Hanewacker so that we could telegraph [indecipherable]",
        "A: With whom, with the girls?",
        "A: Oh, well, we were coming out to \u2014 we \u2014 somehow they had their free day too,\nyou know, so we could \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we would \u2014 we would meet in that park. And we didn\u2019t know how to do it\nbecause this has got to \u2014 the Frenchman says it\u2019s got to be done tonight.",
        "A: No, no, they were French civilians.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Oh, they were not in a camp, they were on the outside. They were slave workers,\nwith th \u2014 except that they were not slave workers, the Vichy government had to\nprovide a certain number of French laborers ex \u2014 and even the French POWs never\nwent \u2014 had it a little easier too, because they didn\u2019t have to march together, they just\n\u2014 they were two or three employed in a bakery, or there was butch \u2014 butcher or\nsomeplace like that, you know, so they \u2014 they were free and they could do things that\nnobody else could. And so how we gonna do this tonight? At that moment I was\ngiving Russian lessons to this guardsman, cause he wanted to go to the eastern front,\nso he was \u2014 he was \u2014 he didn't like the \u2014 he was afraid of the camp supervisor, who\nwas a horrible woman, but he said that if I was cau \u2014 he was caught with me, giving\nme this lesson, it wouldn\u2019t be so bad because we can always say I was just doing\nsomething for him. But anyhow, so when we got this news, I was teaching him, I\ndon\u2019t remember was a difficult [indecipherable] idiot anyhow, wanting to go to the\neastern front. But \u2014",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable]",
        "A: How did I know Russian? From the tailor. He \u2014 he would give me a \u2014 a \u2014 no, I\nwould bring my coat to be pressed, or something like that and in order to keep me\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbusy he would give me a\u2014 a Russian, because he was a White Russian, that\u2019s where\nthe White Russians \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and he \u2014 they were White Russians, and so he would give me this Russian\nnewspaper and [indecipherable] I said, I can\u2019t read it, and he \u2014 every time I came he\nwould give me a different Russian letter to print, and to learn to \u2014 so I knew how it\nwas \u2014 you know, I could read, but I didn't know what I was reading, but that\u2019s besi \u2014\nthe same thing that I did with this German, that I could perfectly typing and writing,\ndidn\u2019t know what I was doing. And he \u2014 anyhow, was wor \u2014 easy words I could tell,\nI mean, and \u2014",
        "A: Teaching this guy, and the girl says finish it, finish it, oh we \u2014 I have news for\nyou, you know. And then she says, we\u2019ve a \u2014 got to do something, and aw \u2014 for my\nbad luck, the guy who \u2014 who watches the camp for this woman, had to go around to\nsee if all barracks were closed. And he leaves the door open. So I was going to climb\nthough the window anyhow to get to the telephone, and get in touch with these\nfriends who was on the PWs line. I mean, he was their helper, you know, like he\nsometimes will let him go. Or if they went to shop, he would, you know be easy f\u2014\non them. And \u2014 but this guy leaves this door open, okay? And I call and I say th \u2014\ncall this numb \u2014 or \u2014 no, how is that I didn\u2019t know the telephone numbers? It took\nFebruary 2, 2001\nme quite a while cause I didn\u2019t know where to look for the number of the camp. But\nthen I see oh, she\u2019s got a whole list there in front of her of the camps, you know. But\nI \u2014 I just called and then I said, may I speak to Fritz? And this says,\n[indecipherable] Fritz, and I know \u2014 oh, you\u2019re not the one I want. And I made this\nmistake saying you\u2019re not the one that I want, that was number one mistake. And she\nslammed the thing down. Then \u2014 but since I was having my finger on the number,\nthey know what I was calling. And so she calls \u2014 she says, who 1s this, what\u2019s this,\nand I made a st \u2014 absolutely idiotic mistake and I said, well, I just wanted to get in\ntouch with a German soldier I used to know. And that\u2019s against all the \u2014 so, she calls\nit, she calls this number, and he says, would you please stop bothering me?\n[indecipherable] you \u2014 and I think he called her a bitch, but I no \u2014 that\u2019s what she\nsaid anyhow. She says, if you had a boyfriend that was a nice fellow, I wouldn\u2019t say\nanything, but bah-ba-ba-ba-ba. And so, how did you get here in \u2014 so, and I said\nwell, it was open. And of course that was number three mistakes because the guy\nwas supposed to lock the office, left it open. So f \u2014 three things against him, so\nanyhow, she hit this a bam \u2014 a bamboo stick and he says \u2014 whacks, whacks, whacks.\nAnd anyhow he beat me too, but anyhow \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know anything would\nhappen because finally fainted, you know, because [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, but I think that I was so glad that I was hurt, because they would have\nbeaten it out of me.",
        "A: Yeah, that I knew the German guard who was helping the British. And \u2014 and the\nguy, when we once ask him why, he says, well, one day I may be a British prisoner\nof war, and \u2014 well, anyhow. So that\u2019s how I got \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how it happened, but anyhow I found myself der \u2014 with girls\nlooking at me and they said \u2014 and they says, you didn\u2019t say anything, because if you\nsaid something you wouldn\u2019t be here any more. But I was also [indecipherable] so\nthen this guard, this Willie came and brought me some hot tea and some sandwiches\nfrom the girls and I couldn\u2019t eat anything because my mouth was so swollen. And\nthe kid says \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t mi \u2014 my body too, of course. But anyhow, he says, oh this is not\n[indecipherable] he said, you write \u2014 see ya \u2014 I think I\u2019m gonna write a letter to the\nRed Cross, they\u2019re not supposed to do things like that. This is not a concentration\ncamp, this is a labor camp. And I say Willie, it\u2019s not for civilians, Red Cross is only\nfor military and you better not get involved in this. And I said to myself, what on\nearth \u2014 how can this fellow want to be [indecipherable] an SS man. But the only\nFebruary 2, 2001\nreason why he was, cause he wanted to go to the eastern front. But anyhow, that\u2019s\nhow, after \u2014 oh yeah, and this old mayor \u2014 major, so used to this coffee business and\nthe biscuits, says where is she, what\u2019s the matter? Nobody brings me coffee. And\nthey said well, she is sick in camp. And \u2014 what happened to her. And she said, but t\n\u2014 if you don\u2019t \u2014 we tell you what happened, but don\u2019t tell anybody else. But he calls\nthe camp, and the doctor comes and looks me over and he says nah, you\u2019re gonna be\nokay. And nothing on the inside was hurt. So that\u2019s how \u2014 that\u2019s why I already was\nin sort of a \u2014 people were kind of looking out for me, fo \u2014 and I was looking for a\nway out of this. So when this opportunity to be this interpreter in kitch \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nknow \u2014 the girl says to me, are you crazy? You don\u2019t know what it means to be a\nkitchen help. You have to s-s \u2014 to peel potatoes and cut [indecipherable] and all that\nkind of stuff. I said, I\u2019d do anything, I would even make up for that man if I could\nget out of here. And so that\u2019s how I was transferred to this private company, but the\nprivate company was working with \u2014 because they were in this \u2014 that was a building\ncompany and they would go to the woods and get these huge stumps of trees, you\nknow, that they would use to support the galleries in the underground factory and all\nthat kind of stuff.

        "A: And the reason why he got me out of this Schmidt and Kranz was because he\nknew all this Gestapo and he work 1n this \u2014 the \u2014 see, the SS already was in this\nbuilding, running concentration camps for profit. So there is somehow \u2014 anyhow, he\nknew enough people to get me out to his firm. Then when the time came to deliver\nme back to the camp, he had my \u2014 he again used his connections not to send me back\nto the camp, and he really saved my life. And I know that because I read his\ncorrespondence while I was cleaning his room, hi-his office and so I know there was\na correspondence about when are you sending this \u2014 this woman back, or this girl\nback and all that. Then I said to the children \u2014 they had two children, I said to them,\nwell, you better watch \u2014 I don\u2019t think I will be telling you any more stories, because\nI have to go away.

I mean, she never asked me to do any heavy work, so all of a sudden \u2014 well,\nanyhow, she had the servant and the servant would say \u2014 she says, well, that\u2019s just a\ncamouflage so you can take a bath. And then her son find that out. And he says,\nMother, I know what you\u2019re doing. If my wife finds out, there\u2019s gonna be a murder\nFebruary 2, 2001\nin this house.

And I said oh yeah, she reminds me of my grandmother, or whatever,\nand besides, she lets me take a bath. And then this woman was jealous that she lets\nme take a bath, so she would say, oh you can take a bath in my thing. But she had\nthe diabetes and I said \u2014 I thought that was some kind of sickness you can catch, you\nknow, and I said oh, no thank you, I \u2014 anyhow, and I \u2014 so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. And, you know, it\u2019s kind of stove when you use the wood. But anyhow, so\nit was \u2014 was really \u2014 it was really ridiculous already.

And I said,\nwell, I\u2019m small, I might fall down. But anyhow, she said \u2014 I was doing it so\nawkwardly that \u2014 that she grabs it away from me, gets on this chair and almost fells\nover, you know, but 1-it was such a funny \u2014 and I took it all like an adventure.",

        "A: Oh yes, I didn\u2019t celebrate, they celebrated for me. Oh yeah, and I also had to\nwork in a garden. This woman had a garden outside the city, the old mu \u2014 the mother\nof the young woman, and I had to \u2014 and this one day \u2014 I forgot all about my\nbirthday, and I \u2014 sh-she always gives me work, extra work and I said please hurry\nup, because I\u2019Il be late for the Russian kitchen, I have to get the food out. And she\nalways finds this stuff to do for me, do this or that. And I used to pull a little wagon\nin the middle of the street and it was loaden with potatoes or fruits or whatever she\ngot, or [indecipherable]. And I get there and she kind of laughs and I look to \u2014 go to\nthe Russian kitchen and it says, all food has been given out, it\u2019s all done. The kitchen\nis closed. And I go upstairs and I open the door to this little room, and I can\u2019t believe\nmy eyes. This had curtains on the windows and it had like a little table there and\nthere were books on a shelf. And somebody says, happy birthday and there were\nthose \u2014 the man and the woman. And that\u2019s how I started celebrating my birthday,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nbecause in \u2014 in Catholic countries you celebrate your name\u2019s days for the name of\nyour patron saint. And Adam and Eve are not exactly saints, but \u2014 but they on the \u2014\ntheir day comes on the 24\" of December, that\u2019s where Adam and Eve celebrate their\nbirthdays. And so that\u2019s how I cele \u2014 I really beautifully celebrated my birth \u2014 and\nthen I said to myself, I used to believe in guardian angels, but I knew that when I\nsaw this old lady, I said, he can rest now, because I got another guardian angel, so \u2014\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nFebruary 2, 2001\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Well, the Ratzfeldts(ph) employed Russians, foreign slave workers. And of\ncourse they got different rations than the Frenchmen. The Frenchmen got better food\nrations than the Russians. And so, since there were so many of them, I think 32 or\nsomething like that, they had to \u2014 the \u2014 they \u2014 the old lady and her maid originally\nwere the bosses of this Russian kitchen, but then they couldn\u2019t manage it, so his wife\nbecame the boss of this kitchen. And of course, her mother was helping her. That\nwas just too big a kitchen for one. But anyhow, I \u2014 what I was doing 1s washing\ndishes and peeling potatoes and starting the fire and bringing \u2014 making the coffee\nand the sandwiches for the Frenchmen, and then the Russians came and I would give\nthem her breakfast and her br \u2014 their bread and then I would sn \u2014 all day long cook\nthe so-soup for the Russians. And there was always a different stuff for the\nFrenchmen, too. And then when the people from the concentration camp came,\nbecause we \u2014 they \u2014 she also employed people in concentration camps and Dora was\nstarted, he also employed the people from the concentration camps, and \u2014 well,\nanyhow, to make a long story short, he wanted to \u2014 I was looking out the window\nseeing prisoners coming and he says, oh you \u2014 you making signs at them, which I\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwas, and I said no, I was just watching why they walk so slowly, you know, because\nthrough that street there was a columns of \u2014 of \u2014 of concentration camps people\npassing by. And I say, an hour or so, oh so, so slow. And he says yeah, I wonder\nabout that too. It takes four of them to lift a \u2014 lift a \u2014",
        "A: Trunk. And of course he says, I \u2014 and I say, my \u2014 must be hungry. So she says,\nask what they getting to eat. And of course I asked a kapo, and I asked the cook,\nbecause they also had there another cook, cause we just couldn't \u2014 I couldn\u2019t make it.\nAnd he says well, I don\u2019t \u2014 we \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t tell us, because she thought it was a\ncatch and the cook wouldn\u2019t eat it. And I said, why don\u2019t you ask them yourself?\nCause they wouldn\u2019t tell me. And so evidently \u2014 he says he don\u2019t have paper, he\nlooks like they\u2019re getting enough to eat. And the kapo says sure, and all on paper it\nlooks enough, but by the time everybody steals, the prisoners don\u2019t get anything, or\nhardly anything. And so this woman used to get couple of those Russian workers and\ngo into the fields and there [indecipherable] around, and she would say w-we can g-\nglean your fields. And so \u2014 but the people who were leaving the potatoes or the\nrutabags(ph) knew that she would come and pick them up so they always left some\nextra, and that\u2019s how she cooked the soup for \u2014 to add it to the prisoners, because the\nguy said \u2014 the kapo said, well, she wants us to work. He says, a slave only works\nwhen somebody\u2019s watching him, but I, of course, didn\u2019t tell him that. But I say, if he\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwants us to work more, then he has to give us food. And so that\u2019s exactly what the \u2014\nhe was thinking too, you know. That\u2019s how they started cooking those soups. And \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, in the \u2014 and the son was on the eastern front. And so when the family of\nthe boss called Langer(ph) came out of Hamburg, they were bumped out, he took\nthem in their house. And so the girl, Gisele(ph) was staying with me, and that\u2019s who\nit was and we became friends.",
        "A: Okay.\nFebruary 2, 2001\nchild will lend his hand to the sufferings of others.\u201d Did you want to elaborate a little\nbit what you meant by that?",
        "A: Well, it was this obvious, that I\u2019ve seen it happen and that\u2019s how you probably\nturn or \u2014 so-called ordinary people into monsters when they have power over\nsomebody else\u2019s, or they want to f-further a career, or they want to get more money,\nor they want to just show that they can do with other people what they want to do,\nthat they are this powerful once.",
        "A: Well, I knew \u2014 well one time Gisel(ph) and I were \u2014 I had a key to the house, and\nGisel(ph) \u2014 I was afraid to cross the yard, so I would open the front door and walk\nher to the side entrance of that \u2014 what do they call that, barracks. And since she was\nfrom Hamburg, one time we were \u2014 we were walking and she was talking and there\nwere two f-flyers, German flyers and they rec \u2014 one of them says, hey, there\u2019s a girl\nfrom Hamburg. And they started talking to her, and of course I was scared to death\nthat they gonna discover me. And \u2014 well, anyhow, is \u2014 this other one says \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow what I said, and he says, oh, I hate those bastards. And I say, what bastards?\nAnd he says oh, those Polish flyers. They don\u2019t care if they die as long as they get\nsome of us down. And that\u2019s how I learned that there were Polish flyers in England,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nyou know, and I was almost \u2014 and Gisela(ph) was just shaking, just hope she doesn\u2019t\nsay anything to betray who she is. Of course I was so glad all of a sudden I was so \u2014\nI was so glad that they are fighting, that they are there, you know, and \u2014 anyhow, I\nmade it up that somebody is calling us, so we went into the house and I never went\non the street again. But Gisela(ph) went out with this one flyer and the other one\nwanted a date, but of course that\u2019s how it gets when you wear civilian clothes and a\nP, small, not like the Jewish star.",
        "A: Oh yeah, but of course when I went out, y-you put it on \u2014 I put it so that it got\nunder the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 lapel, and you \u2014 then, 1f somebody was looking, I \u2014 well anyhow, about the\nmonsters, the Ratzfeldts(ph) used me for many things. I mean, I had this Russian\nkitchen, that was my main job from f-five o\u2019clock in the morning til whenever the\nlast dish was handed out and the kitchen was clean, okay? But they also would, if\nneed be, do something \u2014 send me someplace. And one time they had to get\nsomething from the bank, so they send me to the bank. And in order to get to the\nbank, since I didn\u2019t ride the bicycle and I \u2014 and \u2014 a-and I couldn\u2019t get on the tram \u2014\non the streetcar, cause I had this P, but a-anyhow, I got to the bank and I \u2014 oh yeah,\nand in order to get on the bus, I took off the P, to get on a streetcar. But when I got\nFebruary 2, 2001\nto the bank, I\u2019m waiting and waiting, and I was to come home immediately with this\npaper that they needed. And the \u2014 the bank director comes out and he says to the boy\non the door, has this Pole showed up? And he says no. And I say, here I am. And the\nguy says, oh, but she doesn\u2019t have her P. And he denounced me, and then that even \u2014\nthat afternoon came two Gestapo men, or SS, whatever they are, and wa \u2014 that I de \u2014\ndid tell them, the Ratzfeldts(ph) what happened, you know, but they were to be\npunished for letting me walk and going \u2014 getting me go to the bank and all that, so\nall this was hanging together. And so when they came, they said well, either you\nshow her \u2014 I don\u2019t know what he says \u2014 either you teach her a lesson or we do. And\nthat meant that he had to hit me and beat me, you know, so he did hit me, but with\n[indecipherable]. And so after that when they left, you know, I was [crying]. And\nhe says \u2014 they called me in and I wouldn\u2019t talk to them \u2014 and he says, what ha \u2014\nwhat were we supposed to do?",
        "A: The Ratzfeldt(ph), the owner. And he says that if they would have done, if I\nhadn\u2019t done, they would \u2014 they would have done. And he says, and you know the\nGestapo. And I said no, I don\u2019t [indecipherable] don\u2019t tell me the story because I\nknow all about you and \u2014 and the Gestapo man in Krakow and all that. So I didn\u2019t\nhave \u2014 didn\u2019t want to say anything. But I know that he \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t his case,\nokay. But \u2014 but this guy in the camp too, you know, when he hit me, I mean, it was\nFebruary 2, 2001\njust power, you just \u2014 shows how powerful he 1s, he [indecipherable] hit somebody\nand the somebody has to suffer. So \u2014",
        "A: Well, ins \u2014 under certain sim \u2014 circumstan \u2014 in circum \u2014 certain circumstances,\nthey\u2019ll be very few people who are resistant. If you have to fear for your own life, or\nfor your life of your family, or life of your community, you probably would do what\nthey want you to do, if the system was like that Hitlerian(ph) system was",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, of course when they came to us \u2014 oh, well, I know that there was \u2014 there\nwas supposed to be a p \u2014 I knew there were political prisoners and I already know\nabout Auschwitz and all that. I know \u2014 but I had absolutely no idea what they do in\nthem. And just \u2014 they just went to work, and they were dressed differently so that\nthey couldn\u2019t escape.",
        "A: No, no, because nobody was allowed to talk about it. No civilians \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t\neven \u2014 I only learned that now from the things that I translated for the museum, from\nthe Gestapo in whatever, that they were not allowed to even write anything about\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwhat happened. So that nothing \u2014 1f you \u2014 somebody died in a concentration camp,\nthey were just to give orally the information, they were not to write, so that there\nreally were no written accounts about that, except that the Germans could help but\nbeing as \u2014a\u2014how can I say, they loved to write and have everything in order, so\n[indecipherable] some of them did write this stuff. But they were not allowed to.\nBut I still thin \u2014 I think still that they treated German Jews better than they did any\nother Jews, because someplace I think that they would return the urn with the ashes,\neven if 1t wasn\u2019t the \u2014 the ashes of the ones who died, and they could bury them \u2014 I\nread it someplace in those 1 \u2014 in those \u2014 1n those testimony, that they could bury\nthem in a Jewish cemetery. So \u2014 but they wouldn\u2019t do that for any other Jew, just the\nGerman Jew.",
        "A: Oh yeah, everybody heard about that, you know, and \u2014",
        "A: Gosh, how could he [indecipherable] now, in the first place, I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I\nthought everybody was for him, see, because openly the newspapers, the propaganda\nand nobody would say a word against, except that old lady with this heil Hitler sign\nthat she didn\u2019t want to have over her house. But I \u2014 I ask this lady, why is it that they\nwant to assassinate him if he is getting so much land for him and so all this forced\nlabors and all that, and bring so much money into the thing, why would they want to\nFebruary 2, 2001\na-assassinate him? And he says well, because he\u2019s not doing the right things. And\nMr. Ratzfeldt(ph) said, I\u2019ve \u2014 because \u2014 she was blaming the generals for losing the\nwar in Russia and all that kind of stuff, that\u2019s why the generals got into it. And \u2014 but\nthe ran \u2014 radio was full of Goering \u2014 not Goerings, but Goebbels saying that God\nsaved Hitler and he has \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 has to have a s \u2014 God\u2019s help to let him stay alive\nand all that, otherwise he would \u2014 but then when they started \u2014 except that when they\nstarted hanging up the people who were doing it, that was at the same time that I\nthink the Warsaw up \u2014 ghetto uprising was going on, I think, so that \u2014",
        "A: No, then that was the Polish uprising, yeah.",
        "A: \u201944, and they were all \u2014 the newspaper were full of \u2014 so Hitler got kind of lost\nsomeplace.",
        "A: And they didn\u2019t want to advertise this idea that there 1s somebody against him, so\nthat they wouldn't \u2014 wouldn\u2019t all come together and get rid of him.",
        "A: So they \u2014 they publicize all this uprising and he was kind of on the back burner\nthen.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah, I wa \u2014",
        "A: Impressions \u2014 I hated him already, you know, my impressions weren\u2019t that\nfavorable, he was a good demagogue and sa \u2014 I saw him personally, too. He couldn\u2019t\nhave a per \u2014 victory parade in Warsaw because Warsaw was bombed, so he had a\nwi \u2014 victory parade over Poland in Krakow, and he was marching there. And\npeople were su-supposedly pushed through the streets and they were \u2014 so he would\nsee people lined up and all that kind of stuff.",
        "A: Oh, I know because I was upstairs on the \u2014 in the \u2014 on my uncle\u2019s house, looking\ndown from the window.",
        "A: Are you kidding? Are you kidding? Having seen so many people \u2014 of your own\npeople dead, city ruined and all that? Literally - somehow we knew he is gonna lose,\nthe minute the Americans came in. Gisela(ph) said, it\u2019s gonna be over soon. My\nuncle said, minute the Americans come in, it\u2019s gonna be over. And it was over.\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh yeah.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Well, really nothing. Was a normal sa \u2014 I just loved the old lady, and \u2014",
        "A: Elsa(ph). And she was from Berlin and she hated Nordhausen. She married this\nma \u2014 she hated little towns and she didn\u2019t like the wife of the son because she\nmarried \u2014 she had already planned his marriage and he didn't marry somebody she\nwanted to marry. So I think I was really getting the better of this quarrel between the\ntwo of them, but they of course \u2014 they \u2014 they had \u2014 they had this \u2014 they had this aunt\nwho lost her fianc\u00e9 in the first war \u2014 war, and she was working for the Red Cross.\nAnd she just stopped working there, and I said, wh-why \u2014 why? And she says \u2014 I\nsays, cannot see how young people can go to war so happy and laugh. Cause she saw\nthis \u2014 she was handing coffee to the soldiers, and of course they were waving and\nshouting and singing. And he says, they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going. They don\u2019t\nknow that they\u2019re going to their death. And she \u2014 she says, I Just can\u2019t take it. I just\ncan\u2019t take young people being butchered. So I, to this day I all \u2014 the father was\ndiscovered after the war with \u2014 oh, with an English revolver or something, and of\ncourse that was in East Germany, and so he was in prison and then he was sent to\nSiberia, where he died. And nobody told me \u2014 everybody knew, and I \u2014 he was\naccused of having killed me, by some woman there. And his mother, who knew that\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI was alive, didn\u2019t say one word for me to come to his help. After all, this guy set me\nfree, instead of sending me [indecipherable] shot this pistol and that kind of stuff.\nBut she \u2014 there were Gestapo men in the house, and \u2014 and maybe they didn\u2019t want\nany witnesses and so \u2014 so she got out and \u2014 but she took the stu \u2014 children, and she\ntold me run, run. And \u2014",
        "A: No-",
        "A: \u2014 we\u2019re talking about before that \u2014 well, it was my liberation, because I \u2014",
        "A: Well, the town was bombed and they \u2014 these people had a ha \u2014 house in the\nwoods, and whenever they could escape they would go to this house in the woods.\nAnd of course, where everything was bombed, they \u2014 they moved to the woods. And\nI used to \u2014 and I remember that I helped them carry out the \u2014 he had a \u2014 he had there\na truck and he used to take the things from the house and from his mother-in-law to\nthe \u2014 course, his mother said I\u2019m not moving, I\u2019m staying here. And while I was \u2014 I\nbrought the things into the house and I think I was gonna \u2014 a-and they were those SS\nmen or Gestapo men, I don\u2019t know, they had uniforms, they were sitting there. And\n\u2014 or rather, there were \u2014 there were the Gestapo men who already changed their\nclothes, but I knew them. And evidently, I don\u2019t know, I was nervous so I don\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nknow what happened, but anyhow all of a sudden he \u2014 they were talking, blah, blah,\nblah and then he says to me, ah, leave what you\u2019re doing there and come out. But he\nalso calls the children, the girl and the little boy. And we go outside and I see him\nwith his revolver. And I said, my gosh, is he gonna shoot me or something? And he\nsaid, now, you run and run straight to Nordhausen so you can see my mother,\nbecause I promised I\u2019d bring you back, or you come back. And \u2014 but watch it. And I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, so I didn\u2019t run. And he says run, so my bullet doesn\u2019t get you.\nAnd he b \u2014 of course, he shot in the air you know, and I run. And that\u2019s how \u2014 and\nnobody \u2014 nobody told the police, or the \u2014 or the whatever they had, NK VD, or\nwhatever they had in those days, that I was alive, that [indecipherable] his mother\nmust have hated him, or whatever there was, you know, they were scared for their\nown lives, so that\u2019s why they helped this man. And I would have told them he was\ngood to the prisoners and he helped to feed them and \u2014 and all that, but \u2014 I could\nhave been a good witness for him.",
        "A: Yeah. And \u2014 and so \u2014 and while I was going to his mother, I didn\u2019t get there yet, I\nsaw this big American tanks coming in. And the first soldiers that were coming were\nthe black men \u2014 I mean the \u2014 the f\u2014 they were black, the \u2014 course they used them\nmostly you know, just the big trucks and all that. Well, but anyhow, so here they\nwere and they\u2019re laughing and throwing candies and all that. And I \u2014 and I don\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nknow but \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether I was such a \u2014 I was really awful. I must have put\nthe P on my thing. But anyhow \u2014 and they were shouting Polski, Polska\n[indecipherable]. I pick up the candy and I go, because I was so worried his mother\nand this maid and her servant will be suffering, you know, the American occupied,\nbecause there were few houses still standing and one \u2014 theirs was one of them. And I\nget in there and there sit these four American young soldiers and she speaks English\nwith them. And they giving her, I don\u2019t know what they were eating, or something\nlike that, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about that, because I was worried to death, you\nknow, what on \u2014 on earth\u2019s going to happen to those two old women. There was a\nthird one, she was a nurse, too, and she was the nurse to this old lady, but she also\nwas a nurse in a gynecologist\u2019s office or something. So all these three old ladies, I\nsaid oh my God, what\u2019s going to happen to them? Nothing happened. They were\ntaken care of by the Americans, so \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, when I saw them \u2014 oh, I spoke fren \u2014 oh yeah, now there was a Polish\nsoldier \u2014 I mean, an American who was Polish, you know, and he came looking in\ntoo, looking for girls. And he has this, you know, a wedding band on his hand. I said,\noh [indecipherable] that\u2019s how married men are. Well, anyhow. And th \u2014 but there\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwere people who far \u2014 couple of them spoke French and the rest was in sign\nlanguage.",
        "A: Oh, I did, my goodness gracious, the minute I saw that truck, I felt liberated.",
        "A: You can\u2019t really describe it. You can absolutely not describe it. I\u2019m so happy that\nI lived through and I \u2014 and I got to this \u2014 that this moment has come. See ya \u2014 that\ntime you didn\u2019t count how many people had to die to bring you freedom. You didn\u2019t\nthink about a grave of the American soldiers, of the ones who have fallen or\nwounded, and \u2014 and they was blinded or would spend years and years 1n all those\nhospices. You don\u2019t think about that, all you think is about yourself and how they\nbrought you freedom, but at what cost, you know? Y-You didn't even think about it.\nBut that was a glorious moment. Just the fact that you survived and that you feel this\n\u2014 course we all knew America\u2019s gonna win anyhow, so yeah, especially with\nGisela(ph) you know, who was saying me \u2014 I\u2019m telling you, once the American\ncomes \u2014 come, the war is over. And it was [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, they always meant they\u2019d always bring you freedom. In the first World War\nthey brought freedom, and there was President Wilson, who \u2014 who ha \u2014 with his\npoints, he made independent Poland and all that. And so of course, I mean, America\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwas always like a land of freedom, land of liberty and y-you knew that once\nAmericans get here, Hitler will be finished. Of course you never knew that for sure,\nbecause he had developed that V-1s, V-2 sooner, you never know how it would have\nended.",
        "A: What did I do? Well, I \u2014",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t stay because the \u2014 immediately the Americans issued a \u2014\nAmericans issued a proclamation that all POWs, foreign POWs and slave workers\nhave to report \u2014 guess where? To Dora. They \u2014 out of Dora they made this transit\ncamp for all liberated people, so that\u2019s how I really knew that gas chambers and\nhospital and \u2014 and that\u2019s where I really learned about what was going on in Dora\nbefore. And I stayed there.",
        "A: When I first [indecipherable] thank God it wasn\u2019t me, because that\u2019s what you\nalways think, you know? And then there\u2019s this \u2014 this enormity of this crime was just\nhards to grasp. And \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: When they \u2014 they talk. And \u2014 and there were \u2014 you know, wherever you went\nthere was something, see what we\u2019re together with \u2014 there were still the s \u2014 s \u2014 the\nsurvivors of the concentration camps were the people who were sick and they\ncouldn\u2019t finish them off, they left them in this hospital, or took some of them inside\nthe galleries and that\u2019s why the people from Nordhausen could not escape the\nbombing and be saved, because they didn\u2019t want to say what they were doing in\nthose underground tunnels, and the \u2014 all the dead people there. And so they had dead\non both side. And it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s really hard to believe, you know, and you just say\nhow come me? How \u2014 how come I am alive and the many thousands died, you ask\nyourself, what am I for here, why have I been left? And you have this question, you\nknow, what am I gonna do, how am I gonna repay all this liberty? That\u2019s why I\nalways give to the \u2014 to the American war veterans, the blinded veterans and all this.\nAnd that\u2019s probably one of the reason why I work here, too. Maybe to atone for the\nthings that I could have done and didn\u2019t do to save the Jews, that I could. And I may\nbe \u2014 of course, I was too young to do anything, but I re \u2014 could have done more. But\nthen you \u2014 you wonder, how come I, and I bet you every survivor is asking the same\nquestion. They say, what does God have in store for me to have let me live?",
        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see, that was the year \u2014 1t ga \u2014 was the co \u2014 camp was called Heilbronn.\nThose were the displaced persons who were not from \u2014 oh no, and then in Dora\nFebruary 2, 2001\nthere was a \u2014 here is a convoy transport going to Poland, and those of you who don\u2019t\nwant to go to Poland can go west. And of course that was the time where, from what\nI have heard from the Russians, an the Ukrainians, how horrible Russian and the\nSoviet system is, I said, even worse than the Germans, than the Nazis even at war \u2014 I\nmean, they are just as the Nazis if not worse. And so, not going to go into any Soviet\noccupied Poland, so I decided then I\u2019m going west.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: All my \u2014 oops \u2014 no, I\u2019ve \u2014 I didn\u2019t even think about my family at that time,\nespecially under the Soviets, I wasn\u2019t going to \u2014 to fall into the clutches of any \u2014 of\nany system like that any more, so I just wanted to go west. And I went west, and I\nwent to the \u2014 this DP camp in Heilbronn. I work for them in the office there. I really\nstarted peeling potatoes again in a kitchen, but then there was somebody coming\nthrough the kitchen, and somebody must have told them that I know languages and\nall that kind of stuff, and they were asking for my name, and I pretended I didn\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nhear anything, cause I wasn\u2019t going to be involved in anything else. And then\nsomebody pointed to me and says, that\u2019s she and says what are you doing here\npeeling potatoes when we need help in this Polish office? I mean, the Pole \u2014 they\nhave Germans and Dutch and all that, and Lithuanians and Latvians, but the Polish\nliaison officer has no help. So what are you doing here? And so I got out and started\nworking for them. And then the UNRRA, the \u2014 the ur \u2014 United Nations Refugee\norganization, the director said to me, what would you have been doing if you were \u2014\nif there hadn\u2019t been no war? And I said oh I\u2019Il be \u2014 probably finish my \u2014 going to the\nuniversity. And he says, well you know what? The UNRRA is paying for education\nof candidates who are coo \u2014 acceptable. Would you like to go to school? And I say,\nyeah, I would like to go to school. But I still stayed in Heilbronn and I would go to\n\u2014 I went to the \u2014 to the ga \u2014 Johns \u2014 to John \u2014 Wolfgang Goethe University in\nFrankfurt.

And they were dying even more than did before because the soldiers were\ngiving them candy and stuff like that, and here was somebody who didn\u2019t eat for 10\ndays, and you can imagine what happens. And then they\u2019re \u2014 they were not allowed\nto give them anything.

And they were na \u2014 they were not counting the dead, they were counting\nthe living. And that\u2019s how the Americans came in, na \u2014 alls you see is this row of\ndead people, you know, because that\u2019s how the \u2014 1n this German order they always\nlined them up very nicely, and so that\u2019s when the German \u2014 when the Americans\ncame and saw it.\n102February 2, 2001",

And that\u2019s what \u2014 she says, that\u2019s\nwhat he saw. And of course, somebody\u2019s gonna have to pay for it. So that\u2019s how \u2014",

But\nwhen the war is over, I shall not lie \u2014 I shall lie no more, steal no more or deceive\nanyone.

And he used \u2014 and he had my \u2014 he healed my tooth. And he said to\nme, now if it still hurts, come the next day because I am leaving. And ho \u2014 he left\nand he comes back and I say, I help you. And I hardly could lift what he was\n103February 2, 2001\ncarrying, is all this stuff that he used, false teeth and all. And I get to his house and\nthere\u2019s Americans standing in front of it, and he says raus krauts and all that. And I\nsay, 1s there anybody who speaks Polish, but the \u2014 no, is there anybody who speaks\nFrench? And they say yeah, there\u2019s \u2014 and he says, voulez vous coucher avec moi?\nAnd I say, and I don\u2019t want that kind of French, I want somebody who I can tell him.\nAnd then comes \u2014 they call up this Polish guy \u2014 I mean, Polish American. And said,\nwhat do you do with this kraut? And I said, this is a dentist who is a very good\n[indecipherable] slave to \u2014 we didn\u2019t call our slave laborers then \u2014 to everybody,\nvery fine workers and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and all she wants to do is put his tools\ndownstairs. And he says no, this is a headquarters, cause there were few houses there\nwere still standing. We don\u2019t want that. And I say, but he was such a good man and\nall that. So anyhow, so he call the sergeant or somebody else, and he says, now look\nin his junk. So he look in his thing, and he says okay, you can tell him he can get that\n\u2014 put that downstairs. And then get out of here. So he put down his dentistry stuff.\nAnd he says, and precisely who are you? You a kraut too? And I said no, I am\nPolish. He says, well, show me a\u2014 show me a I.D., and I say, I don\u2019t have any. How\ndo we know? You could be a kraut hiding, pretending you are Polish. And the\ndentist says, oh I know, in my office there is a \u2014 I have an index card and it tells\nthere, you know, a nationality. Well, the guy says to me, well next time, don\u2019t go\nanyplace without an I.D. And I said, where I\u2019m going to get any? And that\u2019s when\n104February 2, 2001\nhe said, well, there\u2019s gonna be a camp in Dora for all slave laborers and I have to go\nthere and get an I.D. That\u2019s how it happened then.",

And so \u2014 but I knew some friends that once in awhile I would meet,\nbut they were just in different locations and ju \u2014 only once in awhile I would see\nthem, they would come and visit, but that was [indecipherable] or I go and visit.\nBut otherwise we had no \u2014 since we all had to have passes to leave the camp, you\ncouldn\u2019t leave the camp without the pass and all that, and you have to prove why\nyou have to go and all this sort of thing. And I always lied and I said, well, I have to\nsee family, I found somebody, and all that kind of stuff. But otherwise you just\nwouldn\u2019t get the pass. So I \u2014 it was difficult really to \u2014 to \u2014 to go by train or anyplace\nlike that. It was easy, it was like another camp except that it was so called free camp,\nbut it was also very limited. Course you weren\u2019t afraid somebody is gonna shoot\nyou, but I mean, 1-1t \u2014 1t was a difficult life. It was a li \u2014 it was a \u2014 it was like in\nEgypt waiting for getting out into the free land.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Well, I never could tell the difference between Jewish people anyhow. I mean,\nyeah, I lived with them and they didn\u2019t look like any difference to me. Of course I\nknew that her father use \u2014 had long beard and [indecipherable] all that and that \u2014\nyou know, like Hasidic Jews. But young people I could never tell the difference,\ncause especially in school we were all in uniforms. And you couldn\u2019t tell, I mean it\u2019s\njust absolutely unpossible for me to tell the difference.",
        "A: No, I \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 that was the first occasion and I wouldn\u2019t have even gotten out\nbecause while I was the \u2014 after the war I worked for a friend, rather a boyfriend of\nmy aunt was working for the Polish consulate in Frankfurt am Main when I was\nworking to school, and somehow I met him on the concert, and we were \u2014 were\ncoming down from some concert and there was this queen of Holland or Belgium, I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t remember which one, and she\u2019s the \u2014 was the woman with this fat legs\nand we were laughing at, saying that\u2019s she got a piano legs. And there was a bunch\n118February 2, 2001\nof Polish officers walking behind us. And they say oh, you Poles. And I say, yeah,\nyou too. And we look at them, and see if they have a s \u2014 a Polish communist signs,\nor the Polish London signs, cause you can tell. And one of them asked, where are\nyou from? And I said, \u2019'm from Krakow. And he said, oh I know Krakow very\nwell, this captain said, I had a girlfriend there. And he turned out to be my aunt. And\nthen we were starting talking, he said, oh you speak languages? And I said oh yeah, I\nstudy languages. And he said oh, could you work for me a couple hours? I don\u2019t \u2014 I\nneed somebody to translate and write German letters. And I said okay, but I was\nfoolish, because you see, I was in the London supported fraternity and I was an anti-\ncommunist so to say, and all of a sudden \u2014 but I did this because he was my friend \u2014\nmy aunt\u2019s boyfriend. And then he was in a car accident, was killed. So after he was\nkilled, this Judge Shanteski(ph) who took over the legal department says oh my\nGod, he left me with so many \u2014 so many letters, correspondence that I \u2014 could you\nwork for me? So I says, but I go to school, and I cannot give you much time, but just\nmaybe a few hours. And so he \u2014 I did work, and of course when the time came \u2014 by\nthe time I got this certificate I have to come to the immigration office, and so when\nthey learned that I working for a consulate and for the Polish Trade and Commerce\nlater on, well somebody told me, don\u2019t work for the consulate because they might\ntake you back to Poland or persecute your family if you don\u2019t go back, and they\nswitched me to this new office, commerce and trade representative\u2019s office. And I\n119February 2, 2001\nwas there and I really stopped going to school because he had so much work, so Is \u2014\ninterrupted my studies. And the meantime I got my papers to come to the\nimmigration office. Well, when they \u2014 but I did have some friends who were\nAmericans, and also military personnel, and I \u2014 I went with them, or rather they went\nwith me to this office. And of course there is this group of people sitting and asking\nme, did you get paid for the \u2014 no, this man, this captain says, but she work for the\nAmericans, she work for the CIC. No, it was called different in those days, 1t wasn\u2019t\nCIC, it was this something intelligence service. And they ask me, oh did you \u2014 oh\nyeah, and this friend of mine said ma \u2014 re-remember that when she has to go to the\nStates that you vouch for her that she work for the Americans. And so he says well \u2014\njust then somebody who was asking me says, well did you get money for it? And I\nsaid, why should I have gotten money for it? I mean, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t like the Soviets and\nI didn\u2019t like the Polish government, and that was it. And that\u2019s \u2014 I didn\u2019t do anything\noutrageous, all I did is translated stuff. And \u2014 but I almost got rejected for the\nemigration, but then all of a sudden I got this call and this lady says there\u2019s\nsomebody wanting to talk to you. And I said, who on earth can it be? Ba \u2014 she didn't\nunderstand the name. It turned out to be the boss of this intelligence service, who\nsays, don\u2019t worry, your papers have been cleared. And he said, you work for us and I\njust \u2014 only by chance did he come across my papers. And he says, I just by chance\ngot to your files and I saw this rejection and I \u2014 and he says, you\u2019re all cleared up\n120February 2, 2001\nnow. So I was all cleared up and the people at Wellesley had to wait for me like six\nmonths, because I was supposed to come and all of a sudden I was stopped and now\nI\u2019m going again, so \u2014 any \u2014 like they say, alls well that ends well.",
        "A: Because they had different \u2014 they had the Polish eagle with the crown on it, the\nLondon ones had.",

One\n121February 2, 2001\nwas a navy man and one was still in college. And the daughter was already married\nin \u2014 I think she was in Rhode Island.",

And it\u2019s funny, tha \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s where lots of people think I\u2019m Jewish because when I talk, not only do I move\nmy hands, and I say oh. I never said oy vey, or [indecipherable] but anyhow \u2014 so,\ngoing back to the family, and they said to begin with that if \u2014 that if I ever wanted to\nleave to go to school that I can do it. And of course later on I had the letter from her\nthat I s-s \u2014 they wished I would have stayed until the father died, because he really\nmissed me. But I got the letter from this friend of mine, and she says, well, come and\nyou stay with us and I\u2019m already going to school and I\u2019m working and all this, in\nSaint Louis. And so I can get you a job in our firm.",
        "A: Were in Massachusetts? Not very long. Must have been May \u2014 I think about six\nmonths, that was about all.",
        "A: No, because maybe they did look at me differently, but I have this facility to get\nadjusted to any country I\u2019m in. My father always says, you have this talents to adapt,\n122February 2, 2001\nor to whatever \u2014 to \u2014 to find a replace \u2014 to me, really ever \u2014 wherever there were\npeople and good people, that was the world to me, I never felt \u2014 course, my English\nwas horrible to begin with, but \u2014 but if I did \u2014",
        "A: Y-Yeah. I mean, if I didn\u2019t open my mouth, nobody knew I was a foreigner, was\na well-dressed, and the lady always send me to a hairdresser in her department store.",
        "A: Yeah, fairly safe. I know nobody\u2019s gonna touch me or anything like that. The\nonly unsafe thing was going to the street with all those cars. But otherwise I \u2014 but I\nwanted to go to school, that was my aim, and it was no \u2014 Wellesley College was so\nexpensive and I, with my house-help salary, there was absolutely no way I could,\nand no time to go to school. Had no idea how important \u2014 how great Wellesley hills\nwas, everybody was talking about Wellesley College, and I [indecipherable]\ncollege. I was very well prepared because European schools, hi-high schools really,\nyou like in a junior hi \u2014 like a yunior college. I mean, I knew more than did junior\ncollege kids, because they have better schools, ca \u2014 for the simple reason that they\ndon\u2019t take anybody, they \u2014 you have to pass tests to be accepted, to show that you\u2019re\ncapable of \u2014 of working the material. So \u2014 but I never felt strange. I maybe looked\nstrange to them, but \u2014\n123February 2, 2001",
        "A: Yeah. And I go to Saint Louis and go to school there, and I \u2014",
        "A: I lived with this family in this \u2014 sleeping on a cot and all that. And \u2014 but the\nschool was way \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 oh yes, and the girls said, you know, they said\nthere\u2019s a Polish invasion in the \u2014 1-in this match \u2014 Universal Match Company. A\nbunch of foreigners getting work and all that. And you know, it\u2019d be better if you\ndidn\u2019t work here, because it\u2019s gonna be bad for me, too. So there I was, and that was\nat noon and we always went to the YMCA to eat. And I was crying all the way and\nthere was a blonde woman sitting there and she says, what is she crying about? And\nshe knew this girl. And she says, ah, because she just lost her work. And she \u2014 this\nwoman says something \u2014 somehow it ca \u2014 wa \u2014 came to tell me, she says oh, she can\ncome and stay with us, and we\u2019re gonna look for a job for her. Because the office \u2014\nnot the office, but the universal \u2014 the office of the Universal Match Company, the\nheadquarters is really n-near where we live. And so I went to live with them, was the\nfamily of a mother and three sisters. One sister, the one that \u2014 Blondie, or Bonnie,\nwho took me in, and two sisters from the other father. And it turned out \u2014 she later\ntold me that she only \u2014 oh yeah, the sister said, oh she only took her in so there\nwould be two against two, because they were always quarreling about who 1s a better\nperson in this family. But anyhow, they took me to this office in Ferguson and the \u2014\nto this Universal Match Company and the director of whoever the personnel office\n124February 2, 2001\nis. Oh sorry, but we don\u2019t have any work for her. And I started crying and I said,\ngosh, after all this. I don\u2019t know, somehow I mentioned the word camps. The minute\nI said the word camps, the guy woke up and he says, what camps? And of course the\ndirectors were all Jewish, to say the tra \u2014 to say the least. And he says, what camp?\nAnd I says, through the tears and I said, well this and that and all that. And he tooks\n\u2014 picks up the telephone and he calls up the office of the Universal Match Company\nin Saint Louis and he says, I need that work for a person that you just let go. She\u2019s a\ntypist. And, do you take shorthand? And I say yeah, a little bit, but not very \u2014 yeah, I\nknew Polish and German shorthand, so I always took notes in German shorthand,\nbut \u2014 anyhow, so \u2014 and I was so lucky that next to \u2014 across the street from the girls\nwhere I lived, lived one of the personnel \u2014 one of \u2014 somebody there lived who also\nworked in Universal Match Company, so he would take me home and bring me\nback. You have to get up five o\u2019clock because it was far away from this \u2014 yeah, ferg\n\u2014 was called Ferguson, | think. And so, I started working and I start first time on an\nelectric typewriter. And I was used to this regular typewriter. So I \u2014 I hit this type \u2014 I\nmean, you know, I hit this thing and somebody says, thanks God this \u2014 it\u2019s look as if\nthis typewriter was gonna float \u2014 fly out through the window. But somebody says\nthanks God sh \u2014 she \u2014 the windows were closed because otherwise I don\u2019t know\nwhat would happen. You know, I was at seventh or eighth floor, or tenth, I don\u2019t\nknow. But anyhow, ni \u2014 so I worked there, and I stayed with the girls, but since I\n125February 2, 2001\nwas starting going to school, it was so difficult for me because I had after cl \u2014 after\nwork I went to school, to night school at Washington U. And I\u2019m just coming home,\nI was asleep and I was holding onto this strap in a bus and the ba \u2014 guy would say,\nsleeping beauty, time to get up, you arrived. And so I said I got to look for another\nplace to live. So I was looking and I was going through this Washington Street, I\nthink, and every place it says for rent, for rent, and it \u2014 then I see this one it says for\nrent, for rent, and it was just cl \u2014 you know, in the middle between work and school.\nBut it says, no women wanted or somethi \u2014 only from \u2014 only for men. I don\u2019t\nremember the wording on this thing. And so, as I pass by, the two old ladies were\nsitting on a porch and I look at the sign and I pass by. And one of them gets up and\nshe says, aren\u2019t you gonna come in? And I say, why I\u2019m a woman, I can\u2019t come in.\nAnd I was dressed up, you know, to kill. And so what are you looking for? And I\nsay, well, I\u2019m looking for a place, because I live in Ferguson, it\u2019s too far for me to\nschool, between work and school. She says, well, why don\u2019t you look at the room?\nSo, take me up. She took me upstairs and I went upstairs and this and that and I said,\nwell how about cooking facilities? And she says, well, we don\u2019t let anybody cook,\nbut if you promise that you never leave any dirty dishes and that you \u2014 and we give\nyou a little place. She evidently liked me, okay? And so I stayed with them. I stayed\nwith them until I got married.\n126February 2, 2001",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yes, yes, we corresponded all the time. My father said, as a matter of\nfact, don\u2019t come to Poland, there\u2019s no future for you there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Especially since I qu-quit the \u2014 since I quit this Polish consulate, you know, cause\nthis was just too much Soviet [indecipherable] and all that kind of stuff. Our consul\ngot arrested. [indecipherable] his wife got arre \u2014 he \u2014 how was it? He had to send\nhis own wife back to Warsaw because before she was married to this consul,\nZambritski(ph) I think was his name, she was married to another guy and the guy\nwas in the Polish underground army. And so he said \u2014 has to send her back. And\neverybody was saying how could you \u2014 could he do that? And I say, well he did,\ncause otherwise he would have to go too. But anyhow, everybody was afraid. And\nthere is this \u2014 my stepfather needed a new radio, he says oh, my old radio doesn\u2019t\nwork. I say oh, I have a beautiful radio, I give you one, so on. And there was a\ncashier from the consulate that was going to Poland and he says, oh, I can take the\nradio and deliver. Oh here, take the radio. And then I hear from my boss\n[indecipherable] she said, you know what happen at the frontier? On the border,\nPolish Czech border or something, the guy was stopped, his ra \u2014 his car was check,\nthe radio was taken apart and there he was let go. Then he comes and visits my\n127February 2, 2001\nmother and stepfather and he brings this radio and he says he\u2019s got to go someplace.\nAnd so my stepfather says oh, Ill take you there, I know where it is, you don\u2019t have\nto \u2014 was in the evening, so you don\u2019t have to wander through Krakow. The minute\nthey stepped out of the house they were arrested. And \u2014 yeah, and then every \u2014 it\nturn out that every place that this guy went, people were arrested because they were\nsaying that a con \u2014 Polish consulate in Frankfurt was an American spy\nheadquarters. See, everybody that had anything to do with that, I don\u2019t know if we\ncould have been a spy there, except maybe for me, I mean I \u2014 which I wasn't even a\nspy, you know. All I did was \u2014 most of my work there for them was to \u2014 to go with\nthem and trans \u2014 translate things for them, you know. But anyhow, so he and my\nmother never forgotten \u2014 has forgiven me for \u2014 because when he came back he had\nemphysema. They say \u2014 I\u2019m not even sure now, but it says he was put in a \u2014 that\u2019s\nhow they would get the truth out of you, they would put you in water and they would\nfreeze it and they let you out and all that. Anyhow that\u2019s what he was telling, and\nthat\u2019s probably a true [indecipherable]. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember for how long, but both \u2014 he was freed every \u2014 cause they\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 after \u2014 but when he got out he was just not a man any more, he was just a\n128February 2, 2001\npiece of [indecipherable] that was old and in \u2014 so and he died from this\nemphysema. And of course if 1t hadn\u2019t been for my radio, he would never been\nwhere he was. And so \u2014 so then \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, so I was told \u2014 somebody says to me, I don\u2019t know how it was said, but\nI really \u2014 I really stopped \u2014 stopped working there for \u2014 for this consulate and I went\nback to school and then the papers come and then the guy says, you\u2019re all clear to go\nto the United States and I went to Bremen and \u2014 and Bremenhaven(ph) and on\nBlatchford and back, I mean in \u2014 to America. On the borg \u2014 on the ship that \u2014 that\nthe marines \u2014 course it\u2019s really, the ship was run by the navy, but it was worked by\nthe people, and that\u2019s how I met my husband there. But anyhow they were saying, oh\nthere comes this bunch of foreigners who are gonna take our jobs. So it wasn\u2019t very\n\u2014 so, I got the bad preparation, I expected worse things America and I didn\u2019t see any\nbad things, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, and I had this other friend with whom I \u2014 whom I known because of my\nwork and \u2014 and we always \u2014 but this \u2014 this navy \u2014 the \u2014 the sailor kept wri-writing to\nme. And comes Christmas time and I say to one of the girls, how do you say a\nChristmas card, and what do you say on a Christmas card? And they all say, dear\n129February 2, 2001\nCharles, and so I wrote dear Charles, but by mistake I have sent this letter to the\nfellow in Chicago. He comes in, you know, what is this? What\u2019s this with Charles?\nAnd I say well \u2014 what\u2019s her name [indecipherable] or something says, well that\u2019s\nhow you write to people, but what do you have to do with him? And I said, the guy\nwas nice, he saved me from being seasick and I work in his cabin, and \u2014 what cabin?\nAnd I said, well, there are 260 people and all that. But anyhow, all he \u2014 and so we\nbroke off. And I send this card to Charles Belfoure and I said, this card cost me my\nboyfriend. And Charles says, that\u2019s good, because then I can be your boyfriend.\nThis is how we got together. And that was a big mis \u2014 bad mistake too, but you make\nmistakes without knowing, you marry somebody without knowing his background,\nanything like that, I mean the \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but he was charming.",
        "A: When? \u00b053 or something like that.",
        "A: I stayed, yeah, and then we \u2014 and when we got married we went to Milwaukee,\nthe Great Lakes where the navy station was.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, he was in \u2014 he was in Great Lakes in the navy, he was just\ncoming, yeah. And he was a good mathematician really, because the vise \u2014 we\nwould meet in New York, and \u2014 because he was coming from the ship. And I said I\n130February 2, 2001\ncan\u2019t come because I have a math exam. He says, oh I can help you and all that. So I\nthought he was a really university person, which he was not. And to me, educated\nperson was \u2014 I mean, I just \u2014 I know from experience from other people that\nmismatched educationally people never get along. And so \u2014 well, I\u2014 I made a\nchoice, and that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Then we went \u2014 then he wanted to \u2014 his mother got sick and her \u2014 his mother live\nin Cumberland, Maryland, that\u2019s where his family live. And so we moved to\nCumberland, Maryland and he got to work for the navy \u2014 naval reserves office\nthere. He was a petty officer, and \u2014 but he was always typing. And so we worked\nthere \u2014 I mean he worked there and I lived there in a very small apartment. And all I\nwas dreaming about is going back to school. And next to Cumberland was\nFrostburg, which is a uni \u2014 was a college town at that time. And I don\u2019t know, I had\nsome neighbors nex \u2014 next door, very wealthy people. And one time I got to know\nthem and the man says, all dressed up and no place to go. I was waiting for my\nhusband to pick me up someplace, and we started talking and then they invited me\nand my husband, and he would never come, because I said, why don\u2019t you want to\ncome? And he said oh, because those are millionaires. And I said, millionaires are\npeople too, big deal. But that\u2019s where he wouldn\u2019t go because they were not his \u2014 he\n\u2014 he has nothing to show up. And anyhow, so these people kept saying, why don\u2019t\n131February 2, 2001\nyou just go back to college? And so I went and I got accepted and I had some credits\nfrom Washington U., except they were not all acc \u2014 accepted in Frostburg because\nthey have their own standards and all that. And since I signed up that I will teach two\nyears after graduation, I didn\u2019t have to pay tuition, all I had to pay is like student\u2019s\ndues and all that. And I think one of my brothers will always give me \u2014 without\nname \u2014 naming he \u2014 without saying his name, he always give me like a gift for me\nfor 45 dollars or something, so \u2014 specially since they saw me on the Dean\u2019s list and\nthey were proud of me and all that. And my husband hated it, but anyhow. And then\n\u2014 and then one day, the marriage ended and there was this little boy. And this little\nboy is now 46 years old and he is an architect, but he still 1s sore at me that he didn\u2019t\nlive with a father and mother and all that kind of stuff. I could \u2014 just couldn\u2019t live\nwith a man who made a kid with somebody else, I just couldn\u2019t \u2014 couldn\u2019t take it off,\ncause even if I was a real Christian I would have forgiven him because I pray every\nday, I say forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. But,\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not an easy thing to do. And I wanted to go to school, I knew that\nif I stayed with him, there was no way for me to finish school. And he also said to\nthe chaplains [indecipherable] we were so happy, but \u2014 until she started wanting to\ngo to school. So that\u2019s it.\n132February 2, 2001",
        "A: So then after I graduated, and since I gradu \u2014 had some more credits or I\ngraduated bef \u2014 oh yeah, before I even graduated I started going to graduate school\nin Middlebury, Vermont. And my son, I put my son in a Catholic camp in summer\non this, some kind of lakes in Lawrence, or something. And he went to camp and I\nwent to school. And so then when I was graduating from Frostburg State I already\nhad credits \u2014 some credits from the graduate school. And then co \u2014 I continue and I\ngot \u2014 oh yeah, before I even \u2014 before I even \u2014 I really never made an application for\na job because one of my chemistry teachers \u2014 professor, one time I got a 65 and so I\nwent to him and I said, how come I only got 65? He says, because you didn\u2019t know\nanything. And he says to me \u2014 then he explains to me how I should study chemistry\nand all this, says if it\u2019s water [indecipherable] cascading water in the sea, you think\nabout it what\u2019s in it chemicals and all that, what it can do, temperatures. And he says\nto me, well, not everybody be \u2014 could be a genius or Copernicus. And I said, do you\nknow that Copernicus was Polish? He didn\u2019t even know that Copernicus was\nPolish. But anyhow, he says not everybody can be Copernicus. When I was\nstudying German, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I was such \u2014 such a bad student, I couldn\u2019t understand\nthe difference when to say this and that. And I said, oh that\u2019s very easy, I can explain\nit to you. If you\u2019re going to it, it\u2019s accusative [indecipherable] are in there, it\u2019s a\nquestion of the in. And if you\u2019re there, then you use the [indecipherable]. Well, that\nwas my certificate for being a good teacher. Because one time I was going through a\n133February 2, 2001\nhall and his office was open and he had three men in it and he says, oh, there goes a\nte \u2014 there goes somebody who can teach anybody. And those people were the\nBaltimore county recruiters for teachers.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: The office and they \u2014 they said, you have a \u2014 you have a job in Baltimore county.\nNow it\u2019s a question of what school. And I have \u2014 I have \u2014 Janet Levin was a very\ngood friend. Her husband used to be a rabbi, but he stopped being a rabbi and\nbecome a lawyer, and they moved to Baltimore. And they said, why don\u2019t you come\nand si\u2014 you know, we\u2019re such a good friends, you know, that to stay, and we can be\nfriends. [indecipherable] big friends but we can \u2014 you can be with us and all that\nand your son can have a home like he used to have. Because they used to pick us up\non a Friday for Shabbas and I was a \u2014 a Shabbas goy for them, and then they would\ntake us back home on a Sunday. And he ha \u2014 and he had \u2014 they had little children, so\nhe play with them, he was older than they were, but he was this big boss and all this.\nSo he had like a family life. And \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: We never \u2014 we have never been divorced.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And he didn\u2019t want to be divorced because so he wouldn\u2019t have to marry all the\nwomen that he seduced, or they seduced him. But anyhow, so he \u2014 he was four years\nold, four years old. We just stayed together until his mother died, because his mother\n\u2014 he didn't want to make his mother unhappy. And so Janet says, come to\nBaltimore, and I said, well I\u2014 so the question was, where \u2014 what high school to get\nin order to \u2014 since I didn\u2019t drive a car I had to be close by. And so Janet was looking\nfor a school \u2014 for a place to live, and the secretary of the school \u2014 because I finally\ndecided Woodlawn, but as \u2014 I couldn\u2019t take it, because they were \u2014 and somebody\njust \u2014 their teacher got married so 1n the middle of the year, in January they were\nwithout a teacher for four \u2014 French four and five. And so I said I will take the job,\nbut I need a place to live close by so that I can walk to school. And so when they\nwere asking in the \u2014 all those places that rented apartments, one of them says, oh, I\u2019d\n\u2014 we just rented an apartment in Woodlawn, and she\u2019s also a teacher. And the\nsecretary says, her name wouldn\u2019t be Belfoure would it? And she says yes, how did\nyou know? And she says, oh [indecipherable] so she \u2014 the \u2014 the director later on\n135\nFebruary 2, 2001\nsaid the principal [indecipherable] she came running into his office and he says, we\nhave a teacher. And so that\u2019s how I \u2014 except that 1t was winter and I was putting my\ntrashcans out and my son opened the door and he says, do I look good in this type?\nCause he was going for the first time to his new school, so he wanted to look good.\nAnd I turned around, but since I didn\u2019t know that \u2014 I didn\u2019t know the \u2014 where I was\nreally standing and I fell down. Thanks God I had this Persian lamb coat on me so I\ndidn\u2019t get all bruised, but my knees were bruised and my face and all that. So my\nfirst day to school I was wearing black gla \u2014 dark glasses and I look really \u2014 I can\nimagine, in winter, to wear dark glasses. But that\u2019s how I started at the school.",
        "A: 25 years in the same school. So \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: French.",
        "A: Yeah, a master\u2019s degree, yeah.",
        "A: And of course they said you don\u2019t really need to spend money on German\nmaster\u2019s, because you know German better than the masters. But I \u2014 I-I si\u2014I-\u2014I-\n136February 2, 2001\ntoo bad I didn\u2019t, because I would have gotten more money. Everybody was saying,\nwhy don\u2019t you teach in college? And I said, because it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ve been to college, so I\nknow how they teach. You cannot influence anybody, and if you teach younger kids\nin high school, you still \u2014 oh, you still can do something and help them or tell them \u2014\nput them on a straight route, how important education is and all that. Once you\u2019re in\ncollege they don\u2019t care, all they do is listen to you \u2014 to your lecture and put down\nstuff and they repeat to you verbatim, so on.",
        "A: I think I feel very American. I \u2014",
        "A: When I was still married.",
        "A: Well, in the first place, 1t were \u2014 in \u2014 1n those days the first thing you did when\nyou got off the boat, you went to the naturalization service to ask for citizenship \u2014 I\nmean, you have to request this thing. And then because I was married to an\nAmerican military, I didn't have to wait seven years, but I think I only had to wait\nfive years or something like that. But then you had to prepare for all those exams and\nmy husband and his fishing friend would stay home and help me with this thing. But\none wa \u2014 my husband was a republican and this other was a democrat and they\nwould quarrel all the time. And so when I went to this, because you have to \u2014 they ca\n137February 2, 2001\n\u2014 asked you to \u2014 the wa \u2014 this \u2014 the lawyer has to present you to the things at this \u2014\nas a person who wants to take the examination. All during the examination they said\nto me, now what do you think of the americ \u2014 of the democrats and the republicans?\nAnd I said, I still wonder how on earth this country be run effectively with all these\nguys quarreling among themself. And the guy, the judge says, no that\u2019s not\nquarreling, that\u2019s disputing. [indecipherable] they disputing or not. And I got it, but\nmy husband never told his mother that I got that citizenship, she had to read it in the\nnewspaper. Cause they took the picture with a \u2014 the senator from Maryland was\nBell, and there was some Italian lady too who \u2014 in a small town, you know,\nsomething like that, to be \u2014 to be a citizen is a big deal, you know, not \u2014 not as in\nother place where you have hundred of them, you know.",
        "A: Well, what shall I say? That I was really proud of the country and I can vote. I\ncouldn\u2019t da \u2014 I couldn\u2019t wait til I could vote, I mean, that was my thing, cause you\nhear \u2014 that was Eisenhower at that time and they said, but you are a democrat, and I\nwasn\u2019t a democrat, I was really a republican at that time. And of course Eisenhower\nwas my liberator, so I voted for him. But then \u2014 then when I was in school in\nFrostburg, I had to make extra money after my husband left, and I work in a\nkitchen. And I lived in a house where there was a restaurant dow-downstairs and\nthen we live upstairs. And so it was the easiest work for me because I didn't have to\n138February 2, 2001\nget dressed or anything like that. And I could leave the boy upstairs and the people\nfrom the hotel were watching him. But I didn\u2019t leave him upstairs, I \u2014 really he came\nwith me and he was painting and drawing and sometimes he would fill the\nsaltshakers and all that. And I only stopped working in this restaurant because they\nsaid, be very polite to the customers, but the customers always weren\u2019t \u2014 he says,\nand don\u2019t put the bill on the \u2014 on the table, give it to them \u2014 give it to his hand. Well,\nyou give this to his hand and he holds your hand. He asks you for a date and all that\nkind of stuff. And I said, but you are married, cause you can see. And he says, well,\nthat doesn\u2019t matter. So that\u2019s how I say, oh my gosh, I can\u2019t work like that and then\nstudy and all this. So there was the \u2014 he says, well the only other job he says, to wash\ndishes. And so I went to wash dishes, but my son was always showing \u2014 there\u2019s a\npeephole and he was showing people that his mother is working washing dishes.\nWell \u2014 and well, I wouldn\u2019t have stopped this work except that one day I put my\nchemistry notes al \u2014 on this washing machine, and when I open it, you know, the \u2014\nthe damp, or \u2014",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: The steam took the \u2014 took all my notes and so here I da \u2014 that was a lost day for\nme. So then I [indecipherable] these people would say, can\u2019t you get \u2014 you can get\n139February 2, 2001\na job in college, can\u2019t you? And so then I accepted a job in a college. First I worked\nsome kind of thing, some paperwork for a psychology department. Then I was teach\n\u2014 then I was \u2014 1-it was a blind girl who was taking French and I was helping her,\ntaking notes and \u2014 and \u2014 for her and all that. And then \u2014 then I no \u2014 by that time I\ngraduated, and I already had this job waiting for me, so anyways [indecipherable]\n[tape break] Well, anyhow, Janet Levin was \u2014 I met Janet Levin in Cumberland\nand before I met Janet Levin I knew a Jewish family, a furrier\u2019s family that I went\nto visit and \u2014 and I saw the Hanukkah candle and so she says, oh how do you \u2014 I\nsaid, when is Hanukkah? And she said, how do you know about Hanukah? And I\nsaid well, I come from a place that has every fra \u2014 fifth person is a Jew, so you have\nto know about Hanukkah. But anyhow, one day this man says, I got bad news \u2014 bad\nnews for you, I\u2019m losing my sight. And I said, oh you [indecipherable] your\nHebrew, I could read it to you. Cause I was a lady of leisure at that time. And so here\ncomes, I don\u2019t know, next month or something, he says hi, I\u2019ve got the \u2014 I \u2014 I made a\nda \u2014 date with the rabbi and you can learn Hebrew because they giving \u2014 there\u2019s a\nnew rabbi in town and he\u2019s giving cu \u2014 his wife 1s giving classes for beginners. And\nso that\u2019s how I met Janet because I was looking for a rabbi and this \u2014 you know, the\nPolish rabbi with the harvartz(ph) and all that kind of stuff and I didn\u2019t see\nanything, I just saw young men at the door of the shul. And this redhead comes to\nme and says, you waiting for somebody? And I say yes, for the rabbi. Oh, there he 1s.\n140February 2, 2001\nAnd I said, where? And she says there, there, the man at the door, shaking hands\nwith the people. I said, that\u2019s not a rabbi. You sure he\u2019s a rabbi? I ought to know,\nhe\u2019s my husband. That\u2019s how I met Janet and we become very good friends. And it\n\u2014 the deal ended because they left for Israel, the whole family left for Israel and \u2014\nand I got \u2014 I said goodbye at the \u2014 New York, at the si\u2014 ship. But she gave me, as\ninheritance, to her friend Linda Ford, who still lives in Baltimore, and she says,\nnow remember when there\u2019s any holidays, make sure you invite her to your house\nfor holidays. So ever since I\u2019ve been going to this Linda Ford. And before she was\nLinda Ford, she was Linda Polack(ph). And so that comes New Year\u2019s, or Easter, I\nmean I \u2014 I\u2019m always there, as an inheritance. So when she introduces me to other\npeople she says, that\u2019s my inheritance. And so that\u2019s how \u2014",
        "A: It was either \u201989, or se \u2014 80 \u2014 I [indecipherable] \u201988, but I heard on the television\nthat there \u2014 there\u2019s a new office, Red Cross office that looks for translators, cause\nthere\u2019s a new office tracing \u2014 the Holocaust an \u2014 war victims tracing office of the\nRed Cross and is looking for a translator. And since I was al-always a champion for\nthe Red Cross, I was even a president of the Polish Red Cross, had a certain\n[indecipherable] junior Red Cross in my school, so I always thought very highly of\nFebruary 2, 2001\nthe Red Cross, so I jumped to the Red Cross, okay. And I went there and we got a\nlittle schooling what the Red Cross is all about and all that and then we \u2014",
        "A: Baltimore, yeah, that\u2019s the central \u2014 this is really a central office for the tracing\nfor Holocaust victims and \u2014 Holocaust war victims. The national searches for\nmilitary and all this, but we do search for Holocaust and war victims. And I started\nworking, but then one day, on the door of the Red Cross, we see an announcement\nby the Holocaust Museum, that the Holocaust Museum is looking for translators.\nAnd so Morris Rosen and I jumped at it and \u2014 course we didn\u2019t know how difficult\nit is to get to Washington from where I lived, and we started working. The museum\nwasn\u2019t open yet, so we worked, I think it\u2019s Eighth Street, or E Street, who \u2014",
        "A: Well, I do \u2014 in the very beginning we would get application that f \u2014 somebody is\nlooking for mother, father, brother, whatever it 1s, so there are certain forms,\nspecially the forms \u2014 the forms were different [indecipherable] in every year the\nforms got \u2014 were changed just to \u2014 to make it easier because the \u2014 you get an\napplication from us, and we send this to the international tracing service in Arolsen.\nAnd then they look in the papers and course they have all their lists, and if anybody\n142February 2, 2001\ncan find anybody, it\u2019s supposed to be there. Because there were \u2014 but however it\u2019s\ndifficult because before the Gestapo and the SS left, they burned most of their\nmaterials. So it\u2019s very difficult to \u2014 to really find somebody. You can never find\nnames, for example, of \u2014 right after the war, when Poland lost the war, all the\nJewish synagogues were burned, and po \u2014 Jewish population\u2019s registers was kept by\n\u2014 by the synagogues, the birth and the marriage records and all that. So once the\nsynagogue was burned, that was it. And ben \u2014 then besides, since the Jews never\nlived together with the Poles, or the very few Pole \u2014 Poles knew the Jews and the\nJews knew the Poles. They only knew each other in commercial situations, but not\nthat I could go \u2014 some \u2014 somebody could swear yeah, I know this \u2014 this Jew came\nfrom this and this place, or this. So we can\u2019t really find anybody like that. Besides,\nwhat they did sometimes, they got this whole Jewish population on the side of some\nriver or something and shot them, or whatever it was. And in the very beginning it\nwas like that. And \u2014 course they didn\u2019t use them for work like they did later, they\njust got smarter [indecipherable] smarter in quotation marks. And so it\u2019s \u2014 so we\nwere looking for these people, but it\u2019s very difficult to find it, especially women. But\nseems like men, who were then put to work, were easier to trace, whereas women\nand children were shot before they were even put to work or anything like that, so \u2014\nso what we did, we would just write out the names and professions and where they\nwere born and all that, and you think possible that could facilitate the finding.\n143February 2, 2001",
        "A: And this ki \u2014 since that was also \u2014 we had to write this in German because we\ndidn\u2019t want to \u2014 otherwise they would have to have somebody in Germany translate\nfrom \u2014 so \u2014 and then their Holocaust tracing went to Germany and they kind of set\nup special forms so that they were easy to read and now they have databa \u2014 base, so\nit\u2019s much easier too, to find, but of course now it\u2019s 50 years. But believe me on that,\nthey still people who 60 or 50 years after, look for their mother or father. I say they\ncouldn\u2019t have done that a little bit early? But maybe they thought they didn\u2019t\nsurvive, so they had giving up. And now they find out that after so many years some\ncousin meets another cousin and so \u2014 and it\u2019s mostly the grandchildren, or\ngrandchildrens, who want to know where the fathers \u2014 grandfathers or grandmother\ndied, or where they come from and all this, so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Well now, there are no more non-Jewish survivors, but \u2014 but the families\nof the Jewish survivors.",
        "A: Yes. A-And then \u2014 now it\u2019s \u2014 since the Polish slave laborers came to this age that\nthey need some kind of documents that there was slave laborers, now we are looking\nfor those, too. And \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Ah, the Thursday and sometime I\u2019Il take home p-papers home if I don\u2019t finish,\nbut most likely I just work on a Thursday.",
        "A: What we\u2019re doing right now is in order to facilitate this with the Polish Red\nCross, we develop forms that we translate the applications into Polish. So then that\ntakes less time in Poland, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m practically doing. And once they put in\na base, or database, I translate it in Polish so then they can be sent to Poland and\ntaken care of by the Polish Red Cross without the people knowing English. So that\u2019s\nmy work there.",
        "A: Oh yes, in the first place, here I doing something, maybe you bring some kind of\nclosure or something, and besides, I like translating and I like Red Cross, so the all\nthree things goes together.\n145February 2, 2001",
        "A: You know, I cannot say it over and over again that I could not understand how a\ncultured nation could come so low to kill innocent people. That \u2014 this was my \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, and then there was my own guilt that I didn\u2019t do more. So \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I had \u2014 I could have maybe help hiding more people. Maybe \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, I just still feel that I have not done enough, and I could have done,\nbecause I had this \u2014 thi-this uncle who was doing it and I could have maybe \u2014 maybe\nhelped. I don\u2019t know, but by the time I got to all my friends \u2014 see, I was in a\ndifferent part of time \u2014 town then. When I went to elementary school I went with a\nbunch of Jewish girls and all that. But when I moved away, and then I came back,\nnone of them was left. So \u2014 but still I\u2014I feel like I should have done more. It\u2019s this\nguilt, plus this why am I here? Why they and not I, you know, this is \u2014 I think\nanyone who survive all this is asking himself that question. So there \u2014 here I am, for\nhow many years, I don\u2019t even remember how long. Anyhow [indecipherable] to\nremember, in the museum.",
        "A: Yeah.\n146February 2, 2001",
        "A: Well, to tell you the truth I don\u2019t remember very much. I went to Arolsen, and we\nwent to [indecipherable] to Volary, because Morris Rosen wanted to see the\ngraves of the \u2014 he was \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 his sister bri \u2014 on the death march to Volary, or from\nVolary or from wherever it was, there were lots of girls who were \u2014 who died, and\nsome of them \u2014 of his sister\u2019s friends were buried there and he wanted to see if their\ngraves are taken care of. So that\u2019s when we went to Volary and then we went to\nMunich with the Americ \u2014 with the German Red Cross, and \u2014 and to the\ninternational tracing service and that\u2019s where I found out that I don\u2019t even exist,\nexcept after the war. And \u2014 well, because evidently the man that I worked for had\nmy file destroyed so he wouldn\u2019t have to send me back to this camp. And so I don\u2019t\nexist, so \u2014 but it [indecipherable]",
        "A: I still don\u2019t exist during the war. And \u2014 so, but we saw Arolsen, how it is\norganized and all that, and \u2014 and I don\u2019t think they \u2014 they have enough help.",
        "A: The center. The International Tracing Center. They don\u2019t have enough personnel,\nthey don\u2019t have enough translators, they don\u2019t have any volunteers like we have. I\nmean, we have paid personnel, but without volunteers, you couldn\u2019t do anything,\nyou know. And \u2014 but they don\u2019t have that stuff. Somebody who can help them with\ntheir knowledge for nothing, so to say. And so that they overworked, underpaid\n147February 2, 2001\nprobably, but \u2014 and \u2014 so it\u2019s very hard to \u2014 for them to \u2014 and people always\ncomplained and they call this \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I think I\u2019ve seen a \u2014 some kind of\nvideo about \u2014 they call 1t Biederman\u2019s Reich. And Biederman is the man who ta \u2014\nwho is in charge of the International Tracing Service in Arols-sen and now they\ndon\u2019t do the things that they supposed to do. If they cannot wri \u2014 read the letter, they\njust put it away and th-they can\u2019t find it all. I don\u2019t know if this 1s a lie. It\u2019s very\npossible that somebody who worked there and thought he or she was mis \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow, put it abused in quotation marks, as taking revenge or what, I mean I don\u2019t \u2014\nall I know that from what I have seen there is they just understaffed a-and the halls\nare full of those documents and they just don\u2019t have enough people to \u2014 to work\nthere. So \u2014",
        "A: Well, so Morris and I said, let\u2019s go. So we came here and we started translating.\nAnd he mostly translated from Yiddish and Hebrew, and I from Polish and German.\nAnd sometimes there were some French things too, to do, but mostly \u2014 in the very\nbeginning it was lots of those diaries, Jewish diaries. And I co \u2014 you read the Jewish\ndiaries and m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 was like he was occupied with the Gestapo files, and \u2014 but\nMorris was reading those diaries and he had to summarize them, and then lots of\ntime I did that for him too, so \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 it was really heartbreaking sometimes. The\nFebruary 2, 2001\nwhole work here, really is heartbreaking. Or rather it was more heartbreaking when\nwe read this, the diaries. But you get so that you \u2014 that th \u2014 oh yeah, and then from\nthe Red Cross, we work in Suitland at this archives. And in the archives we were\nlooking in the death books and we found about 40,000 names for the Red Cross, for\nthe tracing service, and got the little certificate from Mrs. Dole for \u2014 for dedicated\nwork and all this kind of stuff. And for example, and we looked through the State\ndepartment files too, and one of the rarely flu \u2014 yeah, I failed with that one. When\nyou were poor and you didn\u2019t have a sponsor here, you couldn\u2019t get to the ameri \u2014 to\nthe States. And one lady says, are you my son? You only take care of the rabbis, you\ndon\u2019t take care of the regular people. And that was really \u2014 you only save the\nyeshivas and that \u2014 no, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know if she said yeshivas [indecipherable]\nanyhow she says rabbis or something like that. And that was heartbreaking too, I\nmean just showing how \u2014 how unjust this whole world is arranged. And that\u2019s \u2014 but\nthe law has nothing to do with justice anyhow, so \u2014",
        "A: I never work on any records for non-Jews, so I don\u2019t really know. Well, you\nknow, I \u2014 when we work in Suitland, it was always Jewish records they were after.\nWe were after getting the numbers for the tracing service of the Red Cross, so most\nlikely we were looking for \u2014 for \u2014 for Jews. And, you know, any person who suffers\n149February 2, 2001\nis, really to me, is a [indecipherable] except that there\u2019s so much \u2014 if I was \u2014 if I\nwere to be killed, I would be killed because I did something against the Nazis, not \u2014\ncause it\u2019s true, all the Polish intelligentsia went \u2014 was killed too, but I mean, I would\nhave to do something, whereas if I were Jewish, I was to be dead because I was\nJewish, I didn\u2019t have to do anything. And so in a way it is different. But \u2014 so that\u2019s\nwhy I never say I\u2019m a survivor, because I\u2019m \u2014 really don\u2019t feel like one, because my\ns-suffering was not in the slave camps, was not like the suffering of the Polish Jews.\nSo if somebody asked me why don\u2019t you come to the meeting or something like that\nand I say well, because I really don\u2019t belong there.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, but you survive and you suffer, and this is true, I suffered and I\nsurvived, but \u2014 but it\u2019s \u2014 my suffering was not like that of \u2014 of the others.\n[indecipherable] all the same, well, in a way.",
        "A: Yeah, all the \u2014 except that sometimes is \u2014 the Gestapo file 1s sometimes is some \u2014\nnow right now w-we had this new Polish archivist, Mrs. Alexandra Boretska(ph)\nand she works \u2014 I do a lot of stuff for her now, to help her. And right now I think \u2019m\nworking on two things. One was a finished thing about the Jews who got\n[indecipherable], where they are, as you know, like where they were deported, and\n150February 2, 2001\nwho kept the records from [indecipherable] and all that. And the other thing that I\njust finished now that I\u2019m really working on the, which ghetto [indecipherable] and\nI was working on Ringlebaum\u2019s(ph) archives too, there, onek(ph) shabbad(ph).\nAnd I stood in the back, so I have thing about the Gestapo [indecipherable] from\nParis.",
        "A: Yeah [indecipherable] into English, looking at the microfiche or something and\nthen translating it. It would be easier for me if I could have a typewriter there, and I\ndidn\u2019t have to write by hand and somebody had to write it again on the typewriter,\nbut unless there is a silent typewriter, I [indecipherable]. But I like my work, and I\n\u2014 I [indecipherable] now that I got old and sick, if I go to work, like I have to go in\nthis rainy and snowy day, I really should be in bed, but when I come here I don\u2019t feel\nsick at all, because ma \u2014 my mind 1s occupied with what I\u2019m doing and not with my\nsickness.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nFebruary 2, 2001\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: Well, at the beginning it was very emotional, but in the time, it\u2019s \u2014 I forget about\nthat, wh-what this place stands for. Cause otherwise I don\u2019t think I could really work\nand \u2014 and be effective, if I was always thinking about the horrors and the persecution\nand the suffering and all that, I don\u2019t think I could work. I \u2014 I think that if I Just say\nthis 1s just work, that it makes it easier for me. But then if I see the people in the\nhalls, when pick up those passports, it\u2019s \u2014 1n a way it\u2019s very good that I go all the\nway up to the fifth floor, that I don\u2019t have to go through \u2014 I even stopped going for\ncoffee downstairs so I don\u2019t have to see the people walking through, because it\nalways \u2014 I \u2014 you be thinking about, I wonder for whom are they work \u2014 wal \u2014 whom\ndo they want to find out about, and who did they \u2014 whom did they lose? And so I\njust take up to the fifth floor, I don\u2019t have to meet anybody, and I just can go open\nthe door and go to work.\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: Well, of course, the first time I saw it, 1t was on \u2014 I don\u2019t know what floor it is,\nbut [indecipherable] this will happen in from three \u2014 three down, but then the most\n\u2014I don\u2019t know, emotional is when you see this Germans taking down the Polish\nborder, what is it, border flag, o-or Polish border line that\u2019s white and red, you know,\nI mean, to me that was the \u2014 because I know \u2014 I \u2014 I lived through it when they came\nin, so thi-this was the most emotional to me, and I really didn\u2019t look through the\nother ones, because I just couldn\u2019t. And then of course, I still never could understand\nwhy nobody wanted to help them, and us too, to help them. I mean, that was \u2014 you\nsee the newspapers and all this kind of stuff, and nobody really did anything. And of\ncourse, privately people did, probably, but I just can\u2019t imagine how all this could\nhave happened, but of course it happened before, it happened with the Armenians,\nand it\u2019s gonna happen probably with other people, and we haven\u2019t learned anything.\nAnd \u2014 but the people dying out, I don\u2019t know, we just have to do something that\npeople remember how cruel one man can be towards the other.",
        "A: Twice, because I wanted to \u2014 you know, but then I never was looking down, you\nknow, to this \u2014 where you\u2019re not su \u2014 when \u2014 this place that they really show the\ntortures and all that. But then I already saw Dora and I know \u2014 I didn\u2019t see the\npeople suffering thereby, so all the places where they were suffering, so \u2014 and I saw\nthe ra \u2014 right after liberations it was a \u2014 1-it wasn\u2019t clean or anything like that. I\n153February 2, 2001\nmean, it wasn\u2019t like it is now that it\u2019s a museum. It \u2014 it was still the old place that \u2014\nthat you can \u2014 could see the bunker and the [indecipherable] and all these places\nwhere all horrible things happen. And the appelleplatz, and \u2014 and \u2014 and you hear the\npeople telling about it, and you see it, too. So I really, about that, I \u2014 I knew, but then\nin those books and here in the documents, I meet the people.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know if there are any no \u2014 Jewish volun \u2014 non-Jewish, I am\nprobably the only non-Jewish, because everybody thought that I was Jewish, and one\nwoman lost a bet with her husband, cause he worked upstairs and he swore I was\nJewish. And she tol \u2014 she says, I just won a bet with my husband, I told him you\nwere not, and \u2014 and since I always go with Morris Rosen, they all think either I\u2019m\nhis wife or his girlfriend or whoever it is. And they call us your mates, and they call\nus your partner in crime, and whatever.",
        "A: Volunteer, Mr. Rosen, yeah. And he comes from Baltimore, so if we can we\ncome together, cause it\u2019s safer, you know. Neither Baltimore nor Washington are\nsafe places to walk through, and that\u2019s why we never come to any of those\nvolunteers\u2019 evenings, because in the first place, cost us money. Not that we couldn\u2019t\nafford this, but then, just to come here for dinner, it doesn\u2019t pay, because we can\u2019t\n154February 2, 2001\ncatch \u2014 th-the last train goes away at 10:30, and who 1s gonna be paying hotel for\n150 dollars just for \u2014 it\u2019d be nice to meet all the volunteers too, you know, and be in\n\u2014 and listen to a concert or see a movie or something like that, but you know, I\nguess, close your eyes and you s \u2014 re-remember what you read, you can see a movie.\nSo \u2014",
        "A: Well, what I learned 1s this, that every one of our religions teaches about\nbrotherly love and love your neighbor as yourself and we still not doing it. That\u2019s the\ninsight that I got. And I don\u2019t know on the other hand \u2014 no, that\u2019s not maybe in the\nmuseum I didn't learn that, but I was asking myself, how would \u2014 you know, when\nyou hear all this at \u2014 anti-Polish expressions, how we \u2014 how we have killed the Jews,\nand how we didn\u2019t help and all that. Nobody ever \u2014 I don\u2019t know somebody \u2014 I\nwrote to the paper and was published, too. Like, for example, the present te \u2014 two\norganizations that, where the Jewish mothers threw their children through the floor\ntraps, somebody would pick them up, and I \u2014 I was serving on one of those \u2014 how is\nit, stations, so to say. If you saw a train that was coming through and has a certain\nmarkings, which meant there were children on it. Now, didn\u2019t say Jewish children or\nPolish children, but there were some markings on the trains that \u2014 that you knew\nthere were children, and you had to tell somebody else that so and so train passed\n155February 2, 2001\nthrough this station. And there were \u2014 then you knew that someplace between one\nplace and the other, there could have been a child who was dropped through the\nfloor. And then the \u2014 somebody would see to it that the child was picked up. And\nthis was all organized, and I think it was organized by the present pope, I think, of \u2014\nhe wasn\u2019t a pope then, of course. But it was all organized this way to pick up the\nchildren that were dropped, so \u2014 and it \u2014 nobody even knows about it. And it\u2019s true,\nthere were [indecipherable] and were bad people, like in every nation you had bad\npeople. But why should I be paying and be responsible for people who were bad?\nAnd yet, it\u2019s just because I\u2019m saying I\u2019m Polish, the mother says, huh oh. I mean, it\nhappens very often. I mean, in Red Cross there was this new worker there and she\nsays to me, ah, the Poles were so horrible to the Jews, killed them during \u2014 and she is\nnot even Jewish. And she says \u2014 and I said, who told you stuff like that? Absolute\nthere were people like that, but they weren\u2019t any better than the J-Jewish O.D. I\nmean, you know what O.D. is? Ordnungsdienst, so the Jewish police. I mean, it\nwas just as cruel as the Polish police or anybody else. I mean, and you \u2014 nobody \u2014\nthey were more hated in the ghetto some \u2014 for example, than \u2014 than even the Polish\npolice, cause you can always bribe the Polish police. And of course I understand the\n\u2014 the Ordnungsdienst, or the yi \u2014 Jewish police, they wanted to stay alive, so \u2014 I\nmean, this whole idea was that everybody who was in this situation had to \u2014 wanted\nto survive, and the will to survive makes you do things that \u2014 I don\u2019t know what I\n156February 2, 2001\nwould do if it was I who had to decide, who had to fight for my life, and f \u2014 and\nmake a \u2014 prolong it for one or two or three days. Of course, ther \u2014 you were always\npromised you\u2019re gonna stay alive longer. And I mean, the insight probably that I\ngain is that you never know what you would do in a given situation, that no matter\nhow much I b \u2014 was taught about this forgive our trespasses, love your brother like\nyour own, like yourself. I don\u2019t know what I would do, if I were pushed toward the\nwall. If my back was toward the wall, what would I do? And for God to judge\npeople. I don\u2019t know if we have the right to do it. Like the Indians say, don\u2019t judge a\nperson until you walk in his moccasins. And that\u2019s the truest truth there is, really.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, the first one was written by my \u2014 was \u2014 the first one that I wrote in a\nGerman \u2014 in a little German town was because my father \u2014 well, when I came to\nPoland, and you know, the Poles hated the Germans because almost every one of us\nlost somebody from the family. My uncle was killed because the \u2014 all the professors\nwere killed in Lvov when the Nazis came. And there were other members of the\nfamily that were incarcerated, and they say her, she\u2019s crazy, saying that there are\ngood Germans. But I say, but I\u2019ve lived there and I know that there were good ones,\ncause if \u2014 without them we would have never survived. And so \u2014\nFebruary 2, 2001",
        "A: To Poland to v \u2014 after the war to visit. And wherever I went it was the same\nstory, so finally my father says, why don\u2019t you just sit down and write the book\nabout, in quotation marks, the good Germans. And I say I understand why you think\nthere were no good, all you saw was the Nazis, the SS, the Gestapo and the\nEinsatztrup(ph) and you didn\u2019t ever see \u2014 I said, the system was horrible, but there\nwere still good Germans. Oh no, of course not. And so that\u2019s why I sit down to write\nthe book, but you know how \u2014 I was teaching and raising a son, I didn\u2019t have that\nmuch time to write a book. But so he never read it because he died in \u201976, so \u2014 so he\nnever read it. But then once I started it, somebody says no, so what, don\u2019t leave us\nlike \u2014 don\u2019t leave us \u2014 tell us what happened. So I wrote about the displaced persons,\nhow our life was in the camps. And then somebody says again well, what\u2019s the end?\nWhat\u2019s the ending, can \u2014 oh yeah, I remember I gave it to some Jewish couple to\nread and they said, well, can\u2019t you write about some happy times? And I say \u2014 ya \u2014\nlike in America and all that kind of stuff. So I said okay. So the last one is called\n\u201cAmerica: Dreams and Reality,\u201d and tells \u2014 this is the longest book, because of\ncourse it describes from what, \u201951 to \u201990 or 200. No, it was published 1n 200\n[indecipherable] in \u00b089. And the first one didn\u2019t sell well at \u2014 at all in Poland. And\nas a matter of fact, the [indecipherable] went bankrupt. But I don\u2019t think it was\nbankrupt on account of my book, praising \u2014 talking about good Germans, but it was\n158February 2, 2001\nbecause the guy didn\u2019t know how to \u2014 that was this time when all this new capitalists\nwanted to grab money and he just probably didn\u2019t have any idea how to sell books.",
        "A: Yes, \u201cIn the Shadow of Dora,\u201d I cou \u2014 I \u2014",
        "A: Yes [indecipherable]",
        "A: I\u2014 nobody could find. I gave them \u2014 I gave it to the \u2014 I give this in the dep \u2014 from\n[indecipherable] lan \u2014 land of slavery, I gave it here and it\u2019s not here, I can\u2019t find it.\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve given America to the \u2014 no, I don\u2019t think yet, because I only had\none copy, so I don\u2019t think \u2014 and I don\u2019t think that would interest anybody, because \u2014\nthat might interest the displaced persons, because they went through the same stages\nof being \u2014 getting here and getting acquainted and all that.",
        "A: No, they all are in Polish except the one in the little German town that was\npublished in Germany, because the Germans got hold of it and translated it and\npublished without sending me the copy of the translations. So they are \u2014 and I was\nan idiot enough, I have \u2014 I have no contract or anything like with \u2014 with them. So\nfinally the guy said, if they sell 1,000 and the editor, I mean the publisher says 1,000\n159February 2, 2001\ncopies, then I get some \u2014 and the \u2014 his financial assistant said 1,500. And so I\u2019m not\ngonna wait for that, okay\u2019? The fact is that I put down something so that those who\ncome after us knows what this generation of us went through and yet somehow\nsurvived. And I think that the reason why we really survive is the 20 years of po \u2014\nPolish independence, cause then we were \u2014 after the 123 years of being taken by\nRussians, Prussians and Austrians, in this free Poland, the Pilsudski\u2019s free Poland,\nwe \u2014 it was imbued in this crowd of the old Poland, and I always was in this camp\nof this nation of a ma \u2014 kingdom or republic of free nations, you know how that if\nyou le \u2014 stick together instead of quarrel, you can be somebody. And I always\nwanted Poland to be multi-culture and multi-religious. And I had this teacher who\nalways \u2014 in elementary school, who always complain how dumb the Polish\ngovernment is and those national democrats and all and this \u2014 and so finally \u2014 and\nwe finally said well, can you tell us when Poland was really big? And \u2014 and she\nsays, Ill tell you. And she said, when the Russian Greek \u2014 no, when the Ukrainian\nGreek Orthodox pre \u2014 prince said to his son, whom he sent to Italy to study,\nremember son, you are a Pole. He says, that\u2019s where Poland could be proud of\nherself. And that stuck with me so that \u2014 of course that\u2019s impossible in this situation,\nwhen all those new ethnical quarrels and all this. I mean, people somehow didn\u2019t\nknow that you can live in peace, speaking a different language, pursuing a different\nreligion, and \u2014 and I mean, and live in peace in one country. Somehow people just\n160February 2, 2001\ndon\u2019t see it, you can see it now, Africa or Yugoslavia, wherever we are, you see the\nsame old stuff, this hatred. And \u2014 but then everybody says that I am is \u2014 all cynical\nand only see the bad side of the \u2014 of the history and I have a friend who says, now\nmy gosh, she finally said something good. And she sa \u2014 no, because I always see the\ndownside of life. And I said, when you look around, there is no up side. There are\nthe rich and there are the poor. There are the educated and uneducated. And I know\nit\u2019s the fault of an uneducated who drop from school and all that. And I see it\u2019s the \u2014\nevery religious \u2014 whether it be a rabbi or a priest or whoever the others ones, they all\npreach their own catechism and \u2014 but I said, but now, since we \u2014 since I see the\nCatholic church said we \u2014 not every \u2014 I have to \u2014 have to tell this to Mr. Rosen, but\nthis \u2014 this writing in the bulletin and says something about [indecipherable] yeah,\nsomething about the desert through which our ancestors fr \u2014 no, it\u2019s talking aya \u2014 in\nthe life, working through life as in a \u2014 like our spiritual forefather or faithful father \u2014\nyeah, I got my faithful fathers walked through the desert, as they coming back, th-\nthis Judeo-Christian idea. And \u2014 but to see that written in a bulletin, that\u2019s kind of \u2014 I\nmean, that\u2019s a totally different aspect as you have seen, let\u2019s say, even 20 years ago,\nbefore this pope. And I \u2014 I think that \u2014 but then you own the other \u2014 the Christian\nand the Jews can get together now, but how about the Arabs and the Jews? I mean,\nthis idea of killing \u2014 going to heaven when you kill an enemy? I mean it\u2019s just so\nFebruary 2, 2001\ninhuman, the whole thought is inhuman. But maybe if we keep working at it we\u2019re\ngonna get better, who knows?",
        "A: Yes, I have been back to Poland and \u2014 but I never got a reception in Poland like\n\u2014 except for my parents and families and all that, like I got in \u2014 in \u20141n Tel Aviv,\ncause my \u2014 when I went to the wedding, to Janet\u2019s daughter, she already told\neverybody that her friend is coming and that she is from Poland. And I went from\none store to another, on one person to another, cause they said, oh we would like to\nmeet you cause my mother\u2019s from Poland, my grandmother was from Poland, and\nshe would so want to hear. So I just went from one place to another, you know? It\nwas \u2014 you know, nobody was talking about anti-Semitism, or anti \u2014 because all these\npeople, you know, left before the war. So their life was cultural, organized, and \u2014 a-\nand you know, usually people that are smart remember good things. They don\u2019t go\nback to the horrible things, cause that just sours up your life. And it wa \u2014 1t was\nreally great, and when we started talking and we one time all thought about the same\nthing. Here the matzos are so small, you know, and back home the matzos were\nhuge, you know, like for a whole family nah. And we talking about the kudskis(ph),\nyou know, that you make for \u2014 what\u2019s that holiday that you build a shelter on the\noutside?\n162February 2, 2001",
        "A: Sukkahs, yeah. And \u2014 we call this kudski(ph), I think. But anyhow, so we talked\nabout all these things and it was fun, it was really, really fun, those happy\nremembrances.",
        "A: Oh, in the first place, when I got there this guy \u2014 I was proud, you know, finally\nthey have their own land, you know. I don\u2019t know whether I said \u2014 although I\nshowed this guy my passport and he said oh \u2014 no, the American\u2019s passport don\u2019t\nmention religion, do they?",
        "A: Yeah, and anyhow, I ca \u2014 he just keeps looking at it and now there\u2019s flags, you\nknow. And I don\u2019t know, maybe I was \u2014 ah, no. I was supposed to be picked up by\nJanet, but Janet messed up the arrival time. And so here I am waiting and waiting\nand nothing happens. And then maybe I had tears in my eyes, but anyhow, I was\nlooking at these flags and you know that not to think about, cause I\u2019m always this\nperson who thinks something worse \u2014 something bad happened to you if you didn\u2019t\nshow up. And the guy says to me, why you \u2014 he says, I exchange your dollars for the\nShekel and I put you in a taxi and you can \u2014 and you can go where you\u2019re going.\nAnd I kind of keep on looking and I say \u2014 I don\u2019t know how, but anyhow he said \u2014 I\nwas about to cry, I think, or something like \u2014 and I said, well I\u2019m not crying for not\nmeeting my friend, I\u2019m crying cause I\u2019m so happy seeing all this \u2014 these flags and all\n163February 2, 2001\nthat, that you finally have your own land and you don\u2019t have to wander through. And\n\u2014 and that was really \u2014 that was really great, when you think about it. And then, all\nthese Jews from Poland brought their Polish individuality and you have two \u2014 and\nyou have 10 political parties like it used to be in Poland. They have all this idea, I\u2019m\nthe king and I know what\u2019s right and you don\u2019t. And I\u2019m not listening to what you\nare saying [indecipherable] still think about, and that didn\u2019t fall from the sky, that\u2019s\nthe Polish experience, where everybody could be a king. Even had the saying that no\nwomen on his estate and his estate wasn\u2019t bigger this \u2014 this room, is equal to the big\ngovernor, I mean that kind of stuff. And you see that in Israel when they start having\nall those political parties and all these different words. It\u2019s nothing but that they\nheard it. That they brought with them.",
        "A: I wou \u2014",
        "A: Well, I was trying to just make sure that he gets good education. That was my\nmain thing, my \u2014 however, since \u2014 I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t teach him Polish, when he\nwas little he knew it, but then my husband says, I don\u2019t understand anything he\u2019s\n164February 2, 2001\nsaying. And then I went to school and I didn\u2019t have time, and I\u2019m very sorry for that.\nAnd I didn\u2019t imbue him with this proud Polishness that I have. And he says, well you\nnever say \u2014 you always praise Poland. And I said, but I never said anything bad\n[indecipherable] America, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m proud of being Polish, I have a thousand\nyear history behind me. And \u2014 of course he would have rather been born to some\nFrench woman \u2014 I mean French immigrant or English immigrant. He \u2014 for some\nreason he, no matter how I brought him up he still \u2014 he \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have the same\nnature I have. He always complains that all I do is always take care of other people\ninstead of myself. And I say, because in real life, I mean at the end of your life, it\u2019s\nnot what you did for yourself, 1t\u2019s what you did for other people. And what got to\nhim, that\u2019s so alien. Absolutely alien, and yet, since he was brought up with, in a\nJewish home, so to say, he married a Jewish girl.",
        "A: Well, [indecipherable] Shabbas we went to a Jewish home, I mean \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, with my friends. And I mean, he \u2014 he thought that all Jewish people are\nthe same like Janet and Stanley Levin, for education and not for money and all this\nkind of stuff. And then he marries this girl. I don\u2019t know what he expected. And he\nsays, you know, there\u2019s ka \u2014 all ki \u2014 they\u2019re so cluster, they\u2019re so exclusive, they\u2019re\nso \u2014 see with Janet and \u2014 and Stanley he was used to, you know, being included,\n165February 2, 2001\nand he thought that every Jewish family is like that, that they would \u2014 that if they\nlike somebody they would sort of, yeah, greet him as their own. And he says, they\u2019re\nnot like that at all, they\u2019re very exclusive. They don\u2019t consider you one of their own.\nAnd I-I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how \u2014 anyhow, the marriage failed because of the money, I\nthink, she wanted to stay in a little town, and he \u2014 and I said, well, I have those two\nJudo-Christian grandchildren.",
        "A: No, becau \u2014",
        "A: On the contrary, I didn\u2019t. I had less religious for a simple reason that when I saw\nthe suffering of the Jews, or I heard about it, and later I saw it \u2014 here 1s a nation that\nprays, keeps all these hundreds of commandments, prays to this God, and he lets his\nchosen people be chosen to the ovens. I really stopped being religious. I go to church\nby tradition and I know there isn\u2019t \u2014 there\u2019s got to be somebody, cause even there\nwasn\u2019t, we have to invent him to make sense 1n life. What for how, why, but when \u2014\nI mean, and I\u2019m not the only one, there are lots of Jewish people who lost their faith\nbecause of that. I mean, when you really think what 1s \u2014 all this \u2014 so many people \u2014 I\nremember this one fellow who \u2014 who got a chicken and he says \u2014 and his mother\nwouldn\u2019t eat it, she\u2019d rather be hungry and skinny because it was not kosher chicken.\nFebruary 2, 2001\nI mean, here the guy goes through all this trouble to buy this chicken and his mother\nrefuses to eat because it\u2019s not kosher. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 I understand, walking through\nthe desert you had to keep your hygiene so that you stay alive, cause the \u2014 not\nenough water and \u2014 and p-plagues and bad food could just kill a whole family, whole\ntribe. But I mean, in modern times? But that \u2014 that was what makes me \u2014 what made\nme really not believe. I just know that there\u2019s all this preachers and rabbis, they tell\ntheir own story now because they want to stay in clerical garbs. But I-I \u2014 I really \u2014\nand I go to church and I look at it and I say my prayers and then I say, what a\nhypocrite you are. And then \u2014 but when I\u2019m in that church, I pray, and I say this Our\nFather and all this. And of course \u2014 an-and the reason why I really don\u2019t see any af \u2014\nsaw any anti-Semitism is because you always read this first old Bible, you know the\n\u2014 you know the \u2014 they is \u2014 and then be \u2014 the Bible, the story from the Bible \u2014",
        "A: Hebrew Bible and then you read the evangel and the new things, you know, so\nthere is always this connection and they always say the ceremony about this Old\nTestament and \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s what they call 1t, Old Testament and this New\nTestament. And so I always saw this connection, but the \u2014 in practical \u2014 in practice,\nthis thing didn\u2019t work out. It\u2019s only now coming back that they stress all this Judeo-\nChristian relationship. And so, maybe it\u2019s only insurance, you know, since I don\u2019t\nFebruary 2, 2001\nknow what\u2019s up there or down below, going to church is my insurance and I should\n\u2014 gosh, it\u2019s a sin to say stuff like that.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: Well, definitely I would. In the first place I wouldn\u2019t have met so many people\nand learned that among the bad ones, there are good ones. And that people are all the\nsame, no matter where they are. And you \u2014 you have to forgive the bad ones and\nhave \u2014 thank God that you met some good ones. And basically that before I always\nthought that the only good people were Polish pe \u2014 I mean Poles, whether they were\nMosaic or Catholic. But then when you go out in the world, you learn that people are\nall the same, in a way, that they are formed by their cultures. And language brings \u2014\nthat the characteristics, that they just have \u2014 they\u2019re influenced by their language, by\ntheir cultures, but basically when you go down to it, they\u2019re si \u2014 they\u2019re all the same,\ngood and bad. And you-your \u2014 when you have your own children you try to make\nthem citizens of the world so that we see that everybody is \u2014 that we all human and\nyou\u2019re never really successful, because sometimes, I see by my own son that not all\n168February 2, 2001\npeople are the same \u2014 or have the same value in his eyes. So I wasn\u2019t very\nsuccessful, although I tried. But there\u2019s nothing that we can do but hope, and try to\nbe better. And I tried, and sometimes I fall back and say bad things about other\npeople. I try not to, but that\u2019s a very human thing, you blame somebody else for your\nown unhappiness and so \u2014 but I never, never made a difference between a Jew, ora\nCatholic or a German or a French, or an English if she was a good person.",
        "A: Which one are you \u2014 a woman?",
        "A: Well, of course I would never be a communist. And I think that democracy,\nguarded by public schools, and education in public schools is the best way of\ngoverning. But I also know that power and greed can buy certain rights and political\npower, and that you have to watch out for that. Because I\u2019m too old to do anything\nabout it, but if \u2014 one thing I know for sure, that I always will be voting, because if\nyou don\u2019t vote, you \u2014 you have nothing to complain about later on, if things go\nwrong. And sometimes you get your \u2014 you don\u2019t get Gore, you get Bush, but you\nhave to put up with it, cause you know, four years from now he can get \u2014 he gave his\n\u2014 if he was good, he stays, if he wasn\u2019t, can go out. So I \u2014 I \u2014 politically \u2014 but then I\n169February 2, 2001\nalways was sort of a\u2014 maybe not a democrat, but I was more \u2014 I always saw\ninjustice in the world, and I just always thought that \u2014 and I think that the\ngovernment is the only place really in this \u2014 that can help p-people, and \u2014 in\nwhatever situations. And so I don\u2019t \u2014 I think I would never be one of those\ngovernment haters, and no matter \u2014 but you have to watch it, you can\u2019t just let\ngovernment do what they want to do if it\u2019s not right. So that\u2019s politics, that\u2019s what I\nam.",
        "A: First I would say I\u2019m a human, a woman and then I would say a teacher and then\nI would say a mother and then I would say of Polish origin. That\u2019s what I would say.",
        "A: Oh, if \u20141f I am abroad I am always an American. I mean, here if somebody \u2014\ncause here is this business of Polish-American, Spanish-American, that kind of stuff.\nNow they came up with African-American. If they ever been in the Africa they\nknow that there are 50 nations at least. But I am Americanized. I do keep some\nPolish traditions, but \u2014",
        "A: Ah, such was this, before Christmas eve, when you have this \u2014 they call this\nVigilia(ph), that\u2019s the vigil of Christmas and you take this white waffle and you\n170February 2, 2001\nbreak it with whoever is with you and you say forgive me and be brothers again and\nall this kind of stuff. I find this a very nice custom. And let\u2019s see, what else? That\u2019s\nabout all that I really believe in when it goes for \u2014 and of course there\u2019s the language\nthat ties me to Poland.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, I think ever since I have fallen, math, definitely first Polish.\nWhen it goes for counting, I count in Polish. But otherwise, I think in the language\nthat I am speaking. But when \u2014 since I\u2019ve fallen on my head, and I s-sometime \u2014 and\nI speak with a person who knows both languages, I\u2019m not sure whether I can keep\nwith \u2014 in one language. I never have that trouble with French because I know they \u2014\nthis \u2014 oh yeah, there\u2019s a Spanish, but I mean, that doesn\u2019t bother me. But since I\nnever learned Italian very well and I don\u2019t know Spanish very well, I ran \u2014 really\nnever know what you \u2014 whether I\u2019m speaking Spanish or Italian, but \u2014 so I avoid it.\nBut I think that I basically \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Now right now I am talking English to\nyou, so I think in English.",
        "A: Well, I haven\u2019t been in this new Poland, but you ni \u2014 I always knew that nobody\nliked what was going on there, cause you can hear all those jokes, the taxi drivers\nalways told \u2014 tell you the jokes. And you still see this dislike of the Soviets. Well,\nFebruary 2, 2001\nnot so much Soviets, like the Russians. And I speak \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I really \u2014 not that I miss\nPoland, but I have love for it, for my beginnings and \u2014 on \u2014 but now on the other\nside I\u2019m very \u2014 I love America because it gives a chance, those of us who were su \u2014\ncouldn\u2019t go back or didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland, gave us a new beginning. It\u2019s\nlike a \u2014 it\u2019s like a promised land, in a way. And of course, not everybody\u2019s life was a\nparadise on the country. Some people had a very, very hard life. Not I, not that \u2014\nbeing not excluded. But yeah, it\u2019s a country that gave us a chance to be something.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: When \u2014 no, it\u2019s \u2014 one of my students gave me, and send it from California and\nthey says, make sure you wear it, and so \u2014 because I was meeting her aunt or\nsomebody, I wore it, cause she \u2014 I knew \u2014 and then I forgot to take it off.",
        "A: Well, \u201cWe the ones who lived through the terror, and those who would learn of it,\nwhen the temptation of conquest and power presents itself, remember the terror. Will\nthey remember the sacrifice of 50 million people during the conflict began by the\nNazis, no matter what the revisionists say? Will they remember the Holocaust and\n172February 2, 2001\nthe warning of the changing wheel of fortune? We learn so little from history, and\nrepeat the same old horrible mistakes, again and again. I know only that I would not\nwant to forget the good of the few people in Nordhausen, nor would I want to fail\ntelling others about them.\u201d",
        "A: Well, no. I just hope that we never \u2014 that our children and our grandchildren will\nnever have to suffer or see others suffer and not do anything about it. And that this\nwhole horror was brought to me by this death of Jan Karski, who \u2014 who tried so\nbravely to na \u2014 to \u2014 to tell the world about what\u2019s going on and nobody would listen\nto him. And whenever I think about har \u2014 and about how this man felt, that he failed,\nhe \u2014 in his life, because despite all he tried, he couldn\u2019t move anybody to do\nanything. On the other hand, I don\u2019t know what he expected people to do, and what\ncould have been done. But 1-it\u2019s just he, when I first saw him, o-on Lehrman Miles\nwith us, his goodbye dinner or something, you know, and he \u2014 he was talking about\nhow Mr. Lehrman Miles help him after his wife died, and then Mr. Miles said the\nsame thing about him, how wonderful Karski was, and how a courageous man. But\nI know that he felt, yeah, from the talk \u2014 talking \u2014 from talking with him, he knew\nthat he felt that he really didn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t do \u2014 that he failed to do what he wanted to\ndo. But then, it\u2019s easy to judge again, without knowing. And even American Jewry\ndidn\u2019t do anything, but on the other hand I understand they were afraid of a\n173February 2, 2001\nbacklash. And so this worl \u2014 life is so complicated. There\u2019s no such a thing like a\neasy, straight line. And everybody brings into this life his own dislikes and likes, his\nown ideas, and they always in conflict with somebody else\u2019s. And the wisdom is \u2014 or\nwould be, t-to do the right thing, but how many of us think about it? Not everybody\ncan think that clearly and long distance. Then we have our own problems, and\neverybody\u2019s involved in our own life and pr \u2014 solving our problems, and it\u2019s not\neasy to live. So that\u2019s why probably people are believing in God, because this \u2014\nwithout knowing that \u2014 believing that there is something up there, or wherever, in\nspace, life would be worthless. That\u2019s it.",
