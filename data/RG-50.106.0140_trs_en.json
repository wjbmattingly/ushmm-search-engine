And my grandmother owned, with\nher brother, a very large section of apartment buildings, with a big furniture store in\nit downtown. And they were respected business people, the Mandl family, you\nknow, for hundreds of years. And we led a very, very wonderful life, a very nice\nMarch 12, 2001\nlife. My -- my mother and father couldn\u2019t vacation together because he ran the\nstore, but my father would go off, I remember, to -- to Italy and to France and one\ntime to the United States. And then I would go with my mother like to Baden-\nBaden where my grandmother would summer. It was a very easy life. On Sundays\nwe'd go to -- there was a small like a zoo, with the caf\u00e9s an -- and there was a\nsynagogue also in the s -- in the suburb there, which is where we went.

And then I started going\ndowntown to the big synagogue, very, very famous art deco synagogue that -- and\nMarch 12, 2001\nthat\u2019s where I went with the other Jewish children. And I was only -- what was it?\nWell, I was born in 1930, so I -- I was -- Kristallnacht I was eight years old. But --\nbut from the time I started school I -- I couldn\u2019t go. None of the Jewish children\ncould go to regular school.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any German friends?",
        "A: Yeah, I had -- I had German -- the children next door and other children. I had\nGerman little girls, but that had to stop too. They weren't allowed to play with me\nany more.",

I had swimming lessons. And wi -- the way they --\nthey gave swimming lessons those days, they put a harness on the kid and like hel-\nheld -- held -- held you by a rope and dropped you in the water and you learned to\nswim. And we were allowed -- but that had to stop, too. This is when I was five or\nsix years old, but then we weren\u2019t there because there was a municipal swimming\npool. And my father had a motorcycle, I remember riding around on the motorcycle\nwith him, which I didn\u2019t like very much. But I was a very studious child, I read a\nMarch 12, 2001\nlot. And that was fun to me, and th -- I guess -- you know, it was so long ago, I\u2019m\n70 years old, so that\u2019s about it at remembering the fun.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories from before Hitler was in power?",
        "A: Well, these things that I\u2019m talking about now were be-before. Yo- You mean\nwhen I was two, three, four years old? I spent a lot of time with my grandmother,\nwho was -- when I was real little she li -- she lived upstairs. It was a big house and I\nguess my mother wasn\u2019t too happy about having her mother-in-law live with her,\nbut it was a very formal life. I would have to go upstairs every morning and curtsy\nand say good morning to my grandmother and we went for walks and we were -- it\nwas a very structured life in -- in -- in Germany. And children were seen and not\nheard, you know, so that -- that\u2019s what I re -- you know, remember. I know I was\nregistered at a -- at a -- a Swiss finishing school for -- where I was supposed to go\nwhen I was like 14 or 15, and -- because my parents were, you know, of the\nwealthier -- wealthier position because of being business people.",
        "Q: What anti-Semitic experiences do you remember from your early childhood?\nYou mentioned th-the swimming had to stop. Wha-What --",
        "A: Well, that I couldn\u2019t play. That -- that I couldn\u2019t play with the other children, and\nwhen I knocked on the door I was told, Gretchen can\u2019t play with you, you know,\ndon\u2019t come back. And I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re jumping ahead, but after\nMarch 12, 2001\nKristallnacht, when -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t know how I ended up at the downtown\nschool anyway, which was the synagogue, the big synagogue, but the Nazis were\nthere with -- with -- with the dogs and had -- were setting fire to the books that were\ninside, I guess the schoolrooms and the library from -- from the synagogue. You\nknow, and they\u2019re saying get out of here, go back, go home. Because the streetcar\nline ended and was just a straight run. And even at that age, at -- at age eight, I\nguess I went on the streetcar and went to school.",
        "Q: Let me keep you back a little big younger.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Let -- let\u2019s not go quite yet. What did your parents say to you when you went to\nyour friends and they said go away, you can\u2019t play? How did your parents explain\nthe situation to you?",
        "A: They explained it that we have to obey, because it can be very dangerous if we\ndon\u2019t, and that I shouldn\u2019t ask questions and that I have to do what I\u2019m told. But it\nwas the type of upbringing anyway where -- where you were obedient, so 1t wasn\u2019t\nthat hard.",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing any anti-Semitic posters or newspapers or anything\nlike that when you were very little?",
        "A: No, no, I have no memory of any of that.\nMarch 12, 2001",
        "Q: Did you ever hear your parents talk about the political and social situation in\nGermany? Did they ever talk amongst themselves with you just kind of around,\nand could hear --",
        "A: No, I have no memory -- no, I have no memory of that. I think that children were\nnot to be worried and that it was -- I -- I knew -- my -- my memory really, concrete\nmemory is more right aft-after Kristallnacht or -- or right -- right before, and the\nthings that happened.",
        "Q: Before Kristallnacht, how much did you actually understand about what was\nhappening around you?",
        "A: I really didn\u2019t know, really, or didn\u2019t understand much and didn\u2019t know much.",
        "Q: Did you ever hear your parents discuss plans to leave Germany\u201d",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, I knew that we were planning to leave Germany, because my\nmother shopped and shopped, including shoes for me for when I would be twe -- 10\n- 12 years old. They were buying Leica cameras to se -- resell in the United States\nbecause the lift van was going to come and it would get filled with all our\nhousehold goods and that we were going to America, and -- because my mother\u2019s\nbrother was here and we -- that\u2019s where we were going. And that was the talk,\nwaiting -- waiting for the -- for the number to come up and you know, the vi -- the -\n- what was it called where you\u2019re waiting for -- for your -- you had a number in\nMarch 12, 2001\norder to get out, but that I knew, that -- and I also knew that my mother was going\nto -- and this was again, before Kristallnacht, was going to Munich twice a week\nto take cooking lessons at -- at a -- there was a -- like a chapter of the Cordon Bleu\nthere, because, you know, they had no idea about America, that they were -- she\nthought she could become a cook here because she was a very famous cook tn -- in\nAugsburg, you know, in -- in Germany. And my father had come to the 1938\nWorld\u2019s Fair earlier in -- in -- in the year and had taken -- and had arranged for the\nvisas with my mother\u2019s brother, who came in 1933. And so I knew -- I knew -- that\nI knew about, I knew about America. And they were taking English lessons also.\nThey didn\u2019t learn much, but they took English lessons.",
        "Q: Did they have any problems with getting the American paperwork?",
        "A: They -- they had -- they had the visa and they had th-the number, but it was not\ndue for quite awhile. In other words, we couldn\u2019t leave.",
        "Q: Can you explain the lift van? You said there was a lift van coming.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you explain that?",
        "A: Yeah, a lift -- lift van is -- is the same as a container on a -- on a -- on a freighter.\nIt\u2019s a great big, wooden box and all the belongings are put in it and -- and those lift\nvans were -- for most people they were sent at -- for storage to Holland. And then\nMarch 12, 2001\nthe idea was that when you got -- were going to go to wherever you were going to\nemigrate to, they would then be shipped. And people paid storage and people paid\nfreight, and there was many, many storehouses in Holland that had these lift vans\nand they were filled with all your belongings and -- and hopefully things that --\nfurniture and clothing and books and -- and everything that you had, hoping for the\nlife in the -- wherever your next haven would be.",
        "Q: Did you ever see Hitler or hear him speak?",
        "A: Yes, I did. I was at my grandmother\u2019s where, as I said, she lived right downtown\non Bahnhof Skazie, which means -- Bahnhof 1s -- is the railroad station, the main\nstreet like -- be like Fifth Avenue in New York. And sh -- we looked out from\nbehind her lace curtains -- she lived, I think on the third or fourth floor, an\napartment building. And we were crouching down, she said, I want you to see th --\nsee this, this is history. We\u2019re not supposed to be looking, you weren't supposed to\nlook out. But that -- that\u2019s the evil man, that\u2019s Adolf Hitler. And I saw him in his\ncar, 1n his open car, just like in the movies, with the hand upraised. And I wa -- I\nwas frightened. I was very, very frightened, because it was so menacing. Well, it\nwas all the accoutrements, you know, that was with him, all the staff cars and\neverything else. So yes --",
        "Q: Wh-Why was it dangerous to be looking at him?\nMarch 12, 2001",
        "A: I guess there was a rule that Jews weren\u2019t supposed to -- to be looking a --\nlooking at him. You know, weren\u2019t supposed to view him. Maybe they were afraid\nwe'd get shot at or something, I have no idea.",
        "Q: When did things start to get really very bad for your family?",
        "A: Things got really bad -- well, I th -- I -- I\u2019m not quite sure, but I think my father\nhad to close up the store maybe three, four, six months before Kristallnacht. But\npeople still, because they were so well known -- maybe it was even longer than that,\npeople would come and pay their bills like behind closed doors, because Jews at\nthat time already, their bank accounts were con -- confiscated. And I -- but because\nthe good relationship that my family had with the town and with -- with -- with the\ncities, that\u2019s who we got along.",
        "Q: What do you remember of Kristallnacht?",
        "A: I remember the -- the house had shutters on the outside and my parents closed\nthe shutters and I -- they pulled me into bed with them. Or maybe I got so\nfrightened at the noises that I went, crawled into their bed with them. But they were\nthrowing rocks, and the store had big shutters too, so they were trying to break\ndown the door. And then the next morning the -- in -- in Germany -- because it was\nall very old-fashioned, the milk was brought by a milkmaid, she had like a -- a -- a\nlittle wagon with a th -- I think a dog pulling it or something. And these metal\nMarch 12, 2001\ncontainers of milk and the housewife would come out with her pitcher of milk and\nthen you filled -- filled the milk. And was -- I don\u2019t know, seven, eight o\u2019clock in\nthe morning and I was -- must have been about seven, because I was dressed for\nschool. And my mother told me to go to the door and you know, get -- get the milk.\nAnd it was not the milkmaid, it was two SS men. And they said, where\u2019s your\nfather? And I said, he -- he was still upstairs. And they said, where\u2019s your mother\nand they like pushed me aside and then came into the house. And my mother -- and\nthey wanted to go upstairs, my mother said, I'll get him, you know, don\u2019t go upstair\n-- and -- and they ki -- my mother went upstairs and got my father and he came\ndown, and meanwhile, they took all but her wedding band, she had, I guess, I\ndiamond ring. Took the rings off of her, but they didn\u2019t take her -- her -- her -- her\nwedding band at that point. And my father disappeared. And they took him away\nand they said they\u2019re just taking him to the police station in Augsburg, in -- and\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I remember.",
        "Q: Had you ever heard of Dachau before that night?",
        "A: No, I'd never heard of Dachau, but that\u2019s where my father ended up.",
        "Q: How long was he interned there?",
        "A: He was in Dachau til the end of March. And the reason that he got out was\nbecause he had been a volunteer in the first World War, and because of the family\u2019s\nMarch 12, 2001\nlong, long, long established times in Germany, and because we had the emigration\nnumber. So he got out and he -- they le -- they let him out and he\u2019s still in the\nstriped uniform, shaved head and he called my grandmother on the telephone, and I\nremember he came home and he was never the same again. My fa -- my father had\nterrible time holding a job in the United States and he -- he was -- he was not a\nstable person.",
        "Q: A couple of questions. Do you know under what circumstances or what\nconditions he was released?",
        "A: He was released under the condition that we had to leave Germany within three\nweeks. And the neighbors on the other side told him that if we\u2019re not gone that he\nwould never -- never be able to leave and that they were going to put him back, you\nknow, put him in a camp permanently. So at that point we left -- we left with --\nwithin two weeks, because as I said, the lift van was gone and the -- the house was -\n- was relatively empty of -- of -- of furniture. And we went to -- no, I think what\nhappened, the lift van was all new furniture, because we were in the furniture\nbusiness, he was in the furniture business, a lift van that was all new furniture to\ncome to America and the things in the house were left. We were still living in -- in\nthe house, because th -- they were going to wait for -- for their emigration number\nand we went to England to wait out the number.\nMarch 12, 2001",
        "Q: Do you know what arrangements had been made for your family to leave\nGermany?",
        "A: The arrangements were that my father had been sending some money to a Swiss\nbank account, so -- just in case. I don\u2019t know whether it was for England or to help\nwhen we came to America. And that\u2019s the arrangements were, so that we were able\nto -- to live. And first class boat tickets on the -- at -- with a shipping company, you\nknow, a boat company, had been purchased, but not for a specific ship, because they\ndidn\u2019t know when our number was going to come up.",
        "Q: Can you tell me the state of your father\u2019s physical health when he was released?",
        "A: He looked like an old man. He was born in year 1900, so that made him 38 years\nold, only. And he -- he looked like an old man. He told some -- I don\u2019t know if you\nwant me to talk about this, some stories, I remember, from being in Dachau and\nwhat it was like then already. Do you want me to go ahead with that?",
        "Q: When -- did he tell you at that time, or much later?",
        "A: Later. That h-he said he always believed in -- in -- in kismet. In -- In -- in fortune\nthat you didn\u2019t know was ga -- th-they were standing in line, they had -- now, this\nwas November, December. They were standing in line with just those striped\nuniforms. Oh, I have to add, Dachau -- at that point there were no concentration\ncamps, it -- it was really a camp for criminals and political prisoners and not as you\nMarch 12, 2001\nthink of -- they quickly learned how to make it worse. And they got potato peelings\nand -- and herring, salt herring to eat. And stale bread. They learned very quickly\nhow to tr -- to treat the Jews. And they were standing in line and the man next to\nhim said, trade places with me. I feel -- I feel unlucky, or I feel lucky. Because they\nwere -- they were going to shoot every fifth man, or threatened to shoot every fifth\nman. And my father, I guess believed in -- in whatever will be, will be, and he\ntraded places with him. And that man was shot. And life was terrible, it -- it was\nabsolutely horrible. How they knew s -- at that stage already to treat people like 1 --\nlike animals, I don\u2019t know. And I think they used as wardens some of -- some of the\npolitical prisoners, a-and so -- some of the actual thieves and like that, to be the\nbosses ov-over the -- th-the political prisoners, th-the Jews.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the process of packing up and leaving Germany?",
        "A: I remember being -- going on a train and we went via Holland. And when we\ngot to the border, the conductor coming and saying, you\u2019re now free, you\u2019re now\nfree. And, little girl, you\u2019re now free. And th -- I was also told during the journey to\nthe border to Holland that -- how to behave myself, not say anything. And the\nfright, I still remember the fright of my parents, you know, that -- of being put off at\nany time.",
        "Q: What could you take with you? You, personally.\nMarch 12, 2001",
        "A: I personally had my autograph book, which in those days, Germans being\nGerman, everything is very serious, so it isn\u2019t like these funny stuff that\u2019s written in\nthe ki -- kid\u2019s autograph book here. This is your aunt, your uncles, your teachers,\nyour grandparents, write very serious, like hopes for your future and draw pictures\nand your friends put like these black paper cut-outs or -- or pictures of roses and\nwrite -- it\u2019s amazing what -- what eight, nine year old children wrote in this book,\nand -- and my teachers and -- and as I said, my grandmother and -- and -- and my --\nmy uncle, a-and that is really all that I had, which now the museum has and which\nis now in Yad Vashem on display, part of the display, which makes me very proud.",
        "Q: I have to pause now to change tapes. One moment.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: -- uation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection\ninterview with Brigitte Freidin. This is tape number one, side B, and you were just\ntelling me about taking an autograph book and you mentioned that some of your\nfriends had written in it. Were you able to say goodbye to your friends before you\nleft?",
        "A: Yes, I -- I was able to say goodbye. I remember that it was very, very, very sad\nand a lot of crying and a lot of hugging. And I think that the saddest was saying\nMarch 12, 2001\ngoodbye to my grandmother and my uncle. My grandmother would not come\nbecause her -- she was in partnership with a s -- brother -- her brother, who had\nnever married. And it\u2019s the typical story, they were afraid that -- they didn\u2019t believe\nit. They didn\u2019t believe it and they didn't want to just close the stores and they didn't\nwant to lose all that money, they didn\u2019t want to lose all that property. And like it\ncouldn\u2019t be, not -- not with their history in -- in -- in Germany. And she wouldn\u2019t --\nshe refused to leave. I have some letters that she wrote to -- I have one living\nrelative, my father\u2019s brother has a daughter whose name is Ruth, and they live in\nSao Paolo, Brazil and she wrote to -- letters to them, which my cousin has given\nme copies of, about how she was only worried about them and about us getting to\nfreedom and that she -- she didn\u2019t think that she\u2019d see any of us, you know, again.\nAnd she was a very important person in -- in my life, my grandmother, because my\nmother\u2019s -- I had no other grandparents. My father\u2019s father died when he was 19, so\nshe was the great matriarch. And my mother\u2019s father died a year before I was born\nand her mother died a year after I was born, so there were no -- no grandparents\nexcept this one grandmother.",
        "Q: What kinds of things did you say to each other when you said goodbye to your --\nyour family and your friends, what did you say?\nMarch 12, 2001",
        "A: I really don\u2019t -- that\u2019s -- has no relevancy for me. You know, I -- I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "Q: Did anything happen in the time between your father\u2019s release and your\ndeparture from Germany?",
        "A: I was confined to the house, I could not go to school any more, and I was -- and I\n-- a-- [| don\u2019t think I had any more schooling after Kristallnacht. I stayed pretty\nmuch with my mother. My mother also went to Nazi headquarters and was thrown\ndown the stairs, where she asked -- tried to find out what was happening to my\nfather. I also know that she sent packages with long underwear and -- and -- and\nfood to Dachau, they were told they could send it. And I don\u2019t know if it was\nthrough the Red Cross or through -- or just regular German channels, and he never\ngot any of it. That\u2019s the things that I remember, but I -- I was -- I was really kept at\nhome.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the day, the actual day that you left Germany?",
        "A: I-I just remember being bundled up in a coat and -- and -- and that we were\ngoing. You know, I -- I -- I remember more the train journey. You know, I\u2019d never\nbeen on -- well, I'd been to Baden-Baden and I guess to Munich, which is only 40\nmiles away, but that I was going on this long, long journey.",
        "Q: And your first stop, where was that?\nMarch 12, 2001",

My parents went to Portobello Road\nand got a second hand cot and it was filled with bedbugs. And I slept on that at the\nfoot of my parent\u2019s bed, and we lived in that one room. And my mother registered\nme in school, and I went to the regular English -- English schools. And I played\nmostly with my cousins, because you know, I\u2019d -- I didn\u2019t speak English. And my\nmother worked as a maid, because you were not allowed to come to England if you\ntook a job while you were waiting for your emigration number. So the little bit of\nmoney they in the sw -- from Switzerland helped, I guess, pay for our food and --\nMarch 12, 2001\nand -- and -- and this room, and -- but by working as a maid, she got paid, you\nknow, like -- like illegal immigrants do here, under the table, as they say.

And how my mother\nand father found out about this, I will never know, but off I was packed, with my\nbook bag on my back and a li -- and a little -- little suitcase and was sent off to the\ncountryside to a place called Saint Ippolyts, which is now part of Ipswich, to stay\nwith a family called the Palmers and that\u2019s where I really learned English, because\nit\u2019s total immersion. I was supposed to be with my two girl cousins and we got\nseparated and I wasn\u2019t in the same village with them, so I was totally by myself on\nmy own, nine years old.

And so it was -- it was already like a given, you know,\nit was -- 1t was part of your life. And we had ditches that were dug that we -- I\nremember the planes coming over and we had to dive into the ditches. And we had -\n- and go under the desks at -- at school, because I went to the country school there,\nof course, in -- in Saint Ippolyts.

And\nshe would bring me up tea in -- 1n -- in the morning and treated me totally as a\nmember of the family. And what the people got was, they got the ration book from\nthe children that they took in, and they got like a pittance of money from the British\ngovernment. They did this out of their generosity. And even when Rosh Hashanah\ncame, my parents came to visit me. How they found their way out there, again, I\ndon\u2019t know. And I remember mixing up Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, I\nthought you had to fast on -- on -- on -- on Rosh Hashanah, I mixed it up\ncompletely.

And I remember the first time I saw -- well, now we\nsay African American -- black on the street, I like got hysterical and was saying,\nwhy aren\u2019t they wearing -- to my mother -- why aren\u2019t they wearing long grass\nskirts? Who are these people? And I think my expectations were that I wouldn\u2019t be\nseparated from my parents any more and that I would be with them, and that I knew\nthat they would have to work very, very hard and I was told I would have to do my\nshare, which I did insofar as that I always -- I always worked very hard, but without\nresentment, just like they did, to make a life.",

And I think it was the constant -- the constant talk, and --\nand the fear and -- and the fear of that bombs might be coming, but I think that also\nJ -- | -- | -- I -- I think that because the conversation was about my grandmother, my\nuncle and the cousins and all the other relatives in -- in Germany, and what was\nhappening and there was a newspaper called \u201cThe Aufbau.\u201d I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s\nstill in existence. It\u2019s -- means the rebuilding. But people got the news, and that was\nreally where -- where the news came about what was happening in Germany, and\neverybody subscribed to it. It was printed in New York. And -- and there was a-\nalways the worry. That\u2019s what I remember was tenseness and worry. And that it was\nwartime and -- and listening to the news every night. And I think that that\u2019s what\nmost people remember about that time. Because I had no brothers and sisters and\nknew no one who was a -- well, there was terrible worry because my mother\u2019s --\nhad a sister by that time, whose husband -- his name was Jacob -- Jakob who died\nin the prison in Augsburg from a heart attack. He never even got to the camps, he --\nand she came via Spain eventually, to America.

        "A: No, I -- I -- I think \u201cThe Aufbau\u201d information was more what was happening in\n-- in -- in Germany and everywhere else, like with -- with the camps, and with --\nwith the -- with the carnage that was going -- going on, and probably about how the\nUnited States wasn\u2019t doing anything. And from the newspapers I -- I really\nremember more when I was 14 -- well, fort -- a -- when I was 15 the war ended, like\n13 and 14, I remember, you know, reading the news and -- and -- and when things\nlooked bad being sad and -- and getting excited. You know, a child\u2019s attitude is\ndifferent than an adult\u2019s. And again I think 1t made a difference, the stress level\nbecause we didn't have any relatives th-that were fighting.",

And my mother wa -- came -- went there and she\ncame home and she just couldn\u2019t get over that the president\u2019s wife, like the queen,\nshould shake a commoner\u2019s hand. And it was -- it -- only in America, only in\nAmerica. But it was really such a glory and just a thankfulness to be in America.\nThat was a constant refrain. And I would only talk English to my parents. I really\nwas nasty. I -- I -- I wanted -- I wanted so much to be an American, and I didn\u2019t\neven want to, like go out with the sons of -- of -- of -- of the other German Jews\nbecause I -- I was -- I was a f -- foolish kid in that way, where I -- but you know,\nMarch 12, 2001\nthere was -- my parents would talk German to me and I would only answer in\nEnglish.

They only wrote about --\nnow, I realize they must have been censored, these letters, but they wrote in the\ntypical German letters, quoted from [indecipherable] and from Schiller and about\nlife. Life is beautiful and I hope the flowers are blooming in springtime and I hope\nyou have enough to eat, because their monies were taken away and their substances\nand their -- the families, and it was -- and how much I miss you and how much I\nlove you and -- but no remorse and no -- nothing of the past, just worry about their\nfamilies. And that impressed me, that I was -- that I was able to see these letters and\n-- and to translate them. And about the Saint Louis. All the correspondence from\nthe people, the telegrams and -- and -- and the letters that people have saved from\nwhat went on in that Saint Louis, and the -- and desperation of these people that -- I\nMarch 12, 2001\nthink that that\u2019s the -- the most amazing thing that I am privileged enough to help in\nbringing this to the world, you know, into English. And ha -- Pll add this, that I\u2019m\namazed that I\u2019m able to do the translations, because I only had up to a third or\nfourth grade education in German. But it -- it -- now I can\u2019t do -- I don\u2019t do the\ntechnical things, they have other people that do the technical. But I am able to -- to\nreally, really do this and it\u2019s like -- it\u2019s like a gift and -- and because of that I\u2019m able\nto speak German again, even though I -- I speak no German with -- with this\ntranslation, but it seems to have gone from my head to my mouth. So this 1s, you\nknow, an advantage, because it\u2019s a language to know, like any language.",

So I took the kiddush cups to show that this 1s\nwhat life used to be, that we were able to bring things over and talked about having\nto escape. This is -- you know, an-and about being born in Germany, and about\nHitler, keeping it mild, but you know, I talked with the teacher.

I -- I find the older I\nge -- I get, the more important I think it is, the reality of -- that the world cannot\nforget, and that I wish that people would just care more for each other and -- and\nlove each other and all that, you know, sort of thing, and -- and not have prejudice,\nnot have prejudice.

You\nknow, and they\u2019re saying get out of here, go back, go home. Because the streetcar\nline ended and was just a straight run.

        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, I knew that we were planning to leave Germany, because my\nmother shopped and shopped, including shoes for me for when I would be twe -- 10\n- 12 years old. They were buying Leica cameras to se -- resell in the United States\nbecause the lift van was going to come and it would get filled with all our\nhousehold goods and that we were going to America, and -- because my mother\u2019s\nbrother was here and we -- that\u2019s where we were going. And that was the talk,\nwaiting -- waiting for the -- for the number to come up and you know, the vi -- the -\n- what was it called where you\u2019re waiting for -- for your -- you had a number in\nMarch 12, 2001\norder to get out, but that I knew, that -- and I also knew that my mother was going\nto -- and this was again, before Kristallnacht, was going to Munich twice a week\nto take cooking lessons at -- at a -- there was a -- like a chapter of the Cordon Bleu\nthere, because, you know, they had no idea about America, that they were -- she\nthought she could become a cook here because she was a very famous cook tn -- in\nAugsburg, you know, in -- in Germany. And my father had come to the 1938\nWorld\u2019s Fair earlier in -- in -- in the year and had taken -- and had arranged for the\nvisas with my mother\u2019s brother, who came in 1933. And so I knew -- I knew -- that\nI knew about, I knew about America. And they were taking English lessons also.\nThey didn\u2019t learn much, but they took English lessons.",
        "A: They -- they had -- they had the visa and they had th-the number, but it was not\ndue for quite awhile. In other words, we couldn\u2019t leave.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, a lift -- lift van is -- is the same as a container on a -- on a -- on a freighter.\nIt\u2019s a great big, wooden box and all the belongings are put in it and -- and those lift\nvans were -- for most people they were sent at -- for storage to Holland. And then\nMarch 12, 2001\nthe idea was that when you got -- were going to go to wherever you were going to\nemigrate to, they would then be shipped. And people paid storage and people paid\nfreight, and there was many, many storehouses in Holland that had these lift vans\nand they were filled with all your belongings and -- and hopefully things that --\nfurniture and clothing and books and -- and everything that you had, hoping for the\nlife in the -- wherever your next haven would be.",
        "A: Yes, I did. I was at my grandmother\u2019s where, as I said, she lived right downtown\non Bahnhof Skazie, which means -- Bahnhof 1s -- is the railroad station, the main\nstreet like -- be like Fifth Avenue in New York. And sh -- we looked out from\nbehind her lace curtains -- she lived, I think on the third or fourth floor, an\napartment building. And we were crouching down, she said, I want you to see th --\nsee this, this is history. We\u2019re not supposed to be looking, you weren't supposed to\nlook out. But that -- that\u2019s the evil man, that\u2019s Adolf Hitler. And I saw him in his\ncar, 1n his open car, just like in the movies, with the hand upraised. And I wa -- I\nwas frightened. I was very, very frightened, because it was so menacing. Well, it\nwas all the accoutrements, you know, that was with him, all the staff cars and\neverything else. So yes --",
        "A: I guess there was a rule that Jews weren\u2019t supposed to -- to be looking a --\nlooking at him. You know, weren\u2019t supposed to view him. Maybe they were afraid\nwe'd get shot at or something, I have no idea.",
        "A: Things got really bad -- well, I th -- I -- I\u2019m not quite sure, but I think my father\nhad to close up the store maybe three, four, six months before Kristallnacht. But\npeople still, because they were so well known -- maybe it was even longer than that,\npeople would come and pay their bills like behind closed doors, because Jews at\nthat time already, their bank accounts were con -- confiscated. And I -- but because\nthe good relationship that my family had with the town and with -- with -- with the\ncities, that\u2019s who we got along.",
        "A: I remember the -- the house had shutters on the outside and my parents closed\nthe shutters and I -- they pulled me into bed with them. Or maybe I got so\nfrightened at the noises that I went, crawled into their bed with them. But they were\nthrowing rocks, and the store had big shutters too, so they were trying to break\ndown the door. And then the next morning the -- in -- in Germany -- because it was\nall very old-fashioned, the milk was brought by a milkmaid, she had like a -- a -- a\nlittle wagon with a th -- I think a dog pulling it or something. And these metal\nMarch 12, 2001\ncontainers of milk and the housewife would come out with her pitcher of milk and\nthen you filled -- filled the milk. And was -- I don\u2019t know, seven, eight o\u2019clock in\nthe morning and I was -- must have been about seven, because I was dressed for\nschool. And my mother told me to go to the door and you know, get -- get the milk.\nAnd it was not the milkmaid, it was two SS men. And they said, where\u2019s your\nfather? And I said, he -- he was still upstairs. And they said, where\u2019s your mother\nand they like pushed me aside and then came into the house. And my mother -- and\nthey wanted to go upstairs, my mother said, I'll get him, you know, don\u2019t go upstair\n-- and -- and they ki -- my mother went upstairs and got my father and he came\ndown, and meanwhile, they took all but her wedding band, she had, I guess, I\ndiamond ring. Took the rings off of her, but they didn\u2019t take her -- her -- her -- her\nwedding band at that point. And my father disappeared. And they took him away\nand they said they\u2019re just taking him to the police station in Augsburg, in -- and\nthat\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I remember.",
        "A: No, I'd never heard of Dachau, but that\u2019s where my father ended up.",
        "A: He was in Dachau til the end of March. And the reason that he got out was\nbecause he had been a volunteer in the first World War, and because of the family\u2019s\nMarch 12, 2001\nlong, long, long established times in Germany, and because we had the emigration\nnumber. So he got out and he -- they le -- they let him out and he\u2019s still in the\nstriped uniform, shaved head and he called my grandmother on the telephone, and I\nremember he came home and he was never the same again. My fa -- my father had\nterrible time holding a job in the United States and he -- he was -- he was not a\nstable person.",
        "A: He was released under the condition that we had to leave Germany within three\nweeks. And the neighbors on the other side told him that if we\u2019re not gone that he\nwould never -- never be able to leave and that they were going to put him back, you\nknow, put him in a camp permanently. So at that point we left -- we left with --\nwithin two weeks, because as I said, the lift van was gone and the -- the house was -\n- was relatively empty of -- of -- of furniture. And we went to -- no, I think what\nhappened, the lift van was all new furniture, because we were in the furniture\nbusiness, he was in the furniture business, a lift van that was all new furniture to\ncome to America and the things in the house were left. We were still living in -- in\nthe house, because th -- they were going to wait for -- for their emigration number\nand we went to England to wait out the number.\nMarch 12, 2001",
        "A: The arrangements were that my father had been sending some money to a Swiss\nbank account, so -- just in case. I don\u2019t know whether it was for England or to help\nwhen we came to America. And that\u2019s the arrangements were, so that we were able\nto -- to live. And first class boat tickets on the -- at -- with a shipping company, you\nknow, a boat company, had been purchased, but not for a specific ship, because they\ndidn\u2019t know when our number was going to come up.",
        "A: He looked like an old man. He was born in year 1900, so that made him 38 years\nold, only. And he -- he looked like an old man. He told some -- I don\u2019t know if you\nwant me to talk about this, some stories, I remember, from being in Dachau and\nwhat it was like then already. Do you want me to go ahead with that?",
        "A: Later. That h-he said he always believed in -- in -- in kismet. In -- In -- in fortune\nthat you didn\u2019t know was ga -- th-they were standing in line, they had -- now, this\nwas November, December. They were standing in line with just those striped\nuniforms. Oh, I have to add, Dachau -- at that point there were no concentration\ncamps, it -- it was really a camp for criminals and political prisoners and not as you\nMarch 12, 2001\nthink of -- they quickly learned how to make it worse. And they got potato peelings\nand -- and herring, salt herring to eat. And stale bread. They learned very quickly\nhow to tr -- to treat the Jews. And they were standing in line and the man next to\nhim said, trade places with me. I feel -- I feel unlucky, or I feel lucky. Because they\nwere -- they were going to shoot every fifth man, or threatened to shoot every fifth\nman. And my father, I guess believed in -- in whatever will be, will be, and he\ntraded places with him. And that man was shot. And life was terrible, it -- it was\nabsolutely horrible. How they knew s -- at that stage already to treat people like 1 --\nlike animals, I don\u2019t know. And I think they used as wardens some of -- some of the\npolitical prisoners, a-and so -- some of the actual thieves and like that, to be the\nbosses ov-over the -- th-the political prisoners, th-the Jews.",
        "A: I remember being -- going on a train and we went via Holland. And when we\ngot to the border, the conductor coming and saying, you\u2019re now free, you\u2019re now\nfree. And, little girl, you\u2019re now free. And th -- I was also told during the journey to\nthe border to Holland that -- how to behave myself, not say anything. And the\nfright, I still remember the fright of my parents, you know, that -- of being put off at\nany time.\nMarch 12, 2001",
        "A: I personally had my autograph book, which in those days, Germans being\nGerman, everything is very serious, so it isn\u2019t like these funny stuff that\u2019s written in\nthe ki -- kid\u2019s autograph book here. This is your aunt, your uncles, your teachers,\nyour grandparents, write very serious, like hopes for your future and draw pictures\nand your friends put like these black paper cut-outs or -- or pictures of roses and\nwrite -- it\u2019s amazing what -- what eight, nine year old children wrote in this book,\nand -- and my teachers and -- and as I said, my grandmother and -- and -- and my --\nmy uncle, a-and that is really all that I had, which now the museum has and which\nis now in Yad Vashem on display, part of the display, which makes me very proud.",
        "A: Yes, I -- I was able to say goodbye. I remember that it was very, very, very sad\nand a lot of crying and a lot of hugging. And I think that the saddest was saying\nMarch 12, 2001\ngoodbye to my grandmother and my uncle. My grandmother would not come\nbecause her -- she was in partnership with a s -- brother -- her brother, who had\nnever married. And it\u2019s the typical story, they were afraid that -- they didn\u2019t believe\nit. They didn\u2019t believe it and they didn't want to just close the stores and they didn't\nwant to lose all that money, they didn\u2019t want to lose all that property. And like it\ncouldn\u2019t be, not -- not with their history in -- in -- in Germany. And she wouldn\u2019t --\nshe refused to leave. I have some letters that she wrote to -- I have one living\nrelative, my father\u2019s brother has a daughter whose name is Ruth, and they live in\nSao Paolo, Brazil and she wrote to -- letters to them, which my cousin has given\nme copies of, about how she was only worried about them and about us getting to\nfreedom and that she -- she didn\u2019t think that she\u2019d see any of us, you know, again.\nAnd she was a very important person in -- in my life, my grandmother, because my\nmother\u2019s -- I had no other grandparents. My father\u2019s father died when he was 19, so\nshe was the great matriarch. And my mother\u2019s father died a year before I was born\nand her mother died a year after I was born, so there were no -- no grandparents\nexcept this one grandmother.\nMarch 12, 2001",

        "A: I was confined to the house, I could not go to school any more, and I was -- and I\n-- a-- [| don\u2019t think I had any more schooling after Kristallnacht. I stayed pretty\nmuch with my mother. My mother also went to Nazi headquarters and was thrown\ndown the stairs, where she asked -- tried to find out what was happening to my\nfather. I also know that she sent packages with long underwear and -- and -- and\nfood to Dachau, they were told they could send it. And I don\u2019t know if it was\nthrough the Red Cross or through -- or just regular German channels, and he never\ngot any of it. That\u2019s the things that I remember, but I -- I was -- I was really kept at\nhome.",
        "A: I-I just remember being bundled up in a coat and -- and -- and that we were\ngoing. You know, I -- I -- I remember more the train journey. You know, I\u2019d never\nbeen on -- well, I'd been to Baden-Baden and I guess to Munich, which is only 40\nmiles away, but that I was going on this long, long journey.\nMarch 12, 2001",
        "A: Our first stop was, I think in -- must have been li -- LaHavre, must have been in\nFrance. And then to get to England to get to -- because we were going to London -",
        "A: Right, to -- to France, an-and then took the boat from la -- LaHavre to London.",
        "A: To Southampton.",
        "A: We -- we were -- we went directly, just -- just like a day. We didn\u2019t stay. We --\nwe were going. Or, if there was a way -- there was no way. You couldn\u2019t have gone\nfrom Holland. W-We must have stayed on the boat -- I mean, on the train.

        "A: That I remember. I remember we w -- we went by train from Southampton to\nLondon, and my father had a first cousin by the name of Alfred Marx, who was ha\n-- who was there already, and he had -- he had two daughters. And he had a brother\nthe name of Sigmund Marx. They were waiting for us at, I guess, the train station\nin London, and they had gotten us a room in -- near Green Park in -- in London,\nin somebody\u2019s apartment. And I slept on a cot. My parents went to Portobello Road\nand got a second hand cot and it was filled with bedbugs. And I slept on that at the\nfoot of my parent\u2019s bed, and we lived in that one room. And my mother registered\nme in school, and I went to the regular English -- English schools. And I played\nmostly with my cousins, because you know, I\u2019d -- I didn\u2019t speak English. And my\nmother worked as a maid, because you were not allowed to come to England if you\ntook a job while you were waiting for your emigration number. So the little bit of\nmoney they in the sw -- from Switzerland helped, I guess, pay for our food and --\nMarch 12, 2001\nand -- and -- and this room, and -- but by working as a maid, she got paid, you\nknow, like -- like illegal immigrants do here, under the table, as they say. And that\u2019s\nthe amazing thing, what -- what these refugees were willing to do from the type of\nhomes and the type of -- of life that they led, in order to exist.",
        "A: Ah, no, no. I went to school with the -- where -- with -- with the children and I --\nI don\u2019t remember any -- any anti-Semitism.",
        "A: Well, the way that I learned English is that two weeks before the war started,\nwhich was in September, all the British -- London, Manchester, all the major\ncities, the schoolchildren were sent to the country, voluntarily. And how my mother\nand father found out about this, I will never know, but off I was packed, with my\nbook bag on my back and a li -- and a little -- little suitcase and was sent off to the\ncountryside to a place called Saint Ippolyts, which is now part of Ipswich, to stay\nwith a family called the Palmers and that\u2019s where I really learned English, because\nit\u2019s total immersion. I was supposed to be with my two girl cousins and we got\nseparated and I wasn\u2019t in the same village with them, so I was totally by myself on\nmy own, nine years old. At that time already, tho -- that netting with -- with -- with\nMarch 12, 2001\nthe, like balloons was all over London, I do remember that, before the war. They\nthought they could stop the bombs with that.",
        "A: They explained to me that they will come and get me, we are going to America,\nbut in order for them not to worry about me, they wanted me where I would be safe,\nbecause they could that way better take care of themselves, and they wanted me\nsafe. So I went. You -- you know, I was a child, you did what you were told. And I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t even remember particularly crying or -- or -- or -- or anything. I just\nwent. Maybe I thought it was ma -- maybe that\u2019s where my love of travel -- I travel\nconstantly -- came from, that, hey, was a new place to go.",
        "A: Of Poland?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s why, because we knew that war was imminent in England because\nof that Ge-German invasion of Poland and England was preparing to go to war,\nand that\u2019s why I was sent to the country, along with all these other children.\nMarch 12, 2001",

And what the people got was, they got the ration book from\nthe children that they took in, and they got like a pittance of money from the British\ngovernment. They did this out of their generosity. And even when Rosh Hashanah\ncame, my parents came to visit me. How they found their way out there, again, I\ndon\u2019t know. And I remember mixing up Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, I\nthought you had to fast on -- on -- on -- on Rosh Hashanah, I mixed it up\ncompletely.

All the correspondence from\nthe people, the telegrams and -- and -- and the letters that people have saved from\nwhat went on in that Saint Louis, and the -- and desperation of these people that -- I\nMarch 12, 2001\nthink that that\u2019s the -- the most amazing thing that I am privileged enough to help in\nbringing this to the world, you know, into English. And ha -- Pll add this, that I\u2019m\namazed that I\u2019m able to do the translations, because I only had up to a third or\nfourth grade education in German. But it -- it -- now I can\u2019t do -- I don\u2019t do the\ntechnical things, they have other people that do the technical. But I am able to -- to\nreally, really do this and it\u2019s like -- it\u2019s like a gift and -- and because of that I\u2019m able\nto speak German again, even though I -- I speak no German with -- with this\ntranslation, but it seems to have gone from my head to my mouth. So this 1s, you\nknow, an advantage, because it\u2019s a language to know, like any language.",
        "A: The only public speaking I\u2019ve done was I did a first person, 1n November.",
        "A: I\u2019ve appeared in the first grade for both my granddaughters, the ones -- local\nones, with -- like a -- I -- I happen to have -- that\u2019s the only thing I have from\nGermany are two kiddush cups. So I took the kiddush cups to show that this 1s\nwhat life used to be, that we were able to bring things over and talked about having\nto escape. This is -- you know, an-and about being born in Germany, and about\nHitler, keeping it mild, but you know, I talked with the teacher. But they don\u2019t --\nMarch 12, 2001\nthey -- they don\u2019t really ask me that many questions. My grandchildren are -- are\nage three to 10.",
        "A: No, I think we\u2019ve pretty well -- pretty well covered my life. I -- I find the older I\nge -- I get, the more important I think it is, the reality of -- that the world cannot\nforget, and that I wish that people would just care more for each other and -- and\nlove each other and all that, you know, sort of thing, and -- and not have prejudice,\nnot have prejudice.
