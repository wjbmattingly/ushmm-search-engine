        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Isak Mike Danon, conducted by Katie Davis, on February 26th,\ninterview conducted with Isak Mike Danon on November six, 1989. The United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr, for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. Can you please state your -- your\nfull name and the full name of your parents?",
        "Answer: My name is Isak Danon, I\u2019m called Mike. And my parents names are -- or were,\nJoseph Danon and Hannah Danon. My mother\u2019s maiden name was Kabiljo.",
        "Q: Can you spell that please?",
        "A: Yeah. K-a-b-1-l-j-o.",
        "Q: Can you please tell us when and where you were born?",
        "A: I was born June 24th, 1929, in Split, which is currently Croatia, used to be\nYugoslavia.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your parents? Were they -- Where were they born?",
        "A: My parents were born in a suburb of Sarajevo, a little town called Reeserko. Sarajevo\nis in bo -- in Bosni -- Bosnia, as we pronounce it, and they came to Split separately and\nthey met there.",
        "Q: Do you know -- Tell us what you know about your grandparents on both sides, and\ntheir names.",
        "A: My grandfather, on my mother\u2019s side, his name was Haim Kabiljo. He came to Split\nfrom Sarajevo, a little bit before World War One. He didn\u2019t do too well wherever they\nlived, so somebody suggested to him that he could come and work with them in Split. He\nput him in a business doing -- making mattresses by hand. This was what he would do;\nwhen people would order, he would custom make a mattress. My grandmother didn\u2019t\nwork. That was not customary for women to work out of the house. My grandfather was\nalso a shamus, which is a sexton in the -- in the synagogue in Split, and he lived right\nnext door, which was provided by the synagogue for him. My grandparents on my\nfather\u2019s side lived in Vizoco, which is the same -- a suburb of Sarajevo now. My gran --\ngrandfather, his name was Isak, I was named for him and so were four of my cousins. He\n-- He didn\u2019t do anything, really. He used to have a grocery store and then he co-signed\nfor somebody on their loan and the other person defaulted, so they took my grandfather\u2019s\nstore in payment. My grandmother\u2019s name was Blanca, which was -- my older sister was\nnamed for her. And again, she didn\u2019t work out of the house, but she would take in\nsewing, so they survived. There was a wh-whole bunch of brothers that were growing up,\nand she, with her sewing, supported the househo -- the household, excuse me.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about -- I want to go back to -- to Split, the town of Split,\nan-and the set of grandparents that were there. What -- How was your family,\ngrandparents and parents, a part of that town, particularly, of course, of -- of the Jewish\ncommunity?",
        "A: My grandfather, Haim Kabiljo, he, as I mentioned earlier, was a sexton, and his main\nfunction was, as a sexton, to keep the synagogue in an order, make sure that it\u2019s clean,\nthat it was -- all the things that are needed. And also, one of the big problem was that we\nhad a very small Jewish community and one of the big problems was trying to get a\nminyan, or a quorum, for the services every day. So he would go searching for people,\nmen. In those days, only men counted for the quorum. He would go around searching and\nasking them to come to the services. I failed to mention, when he got a little older, and\nhis children were grown up, he s-started sort of s -- a little store, what they sold was yard\ngoods, mostly. It was a very small store, and one of my aunts, I think she was next to the\nyoungest of his children, she worked in that store. My grandfather was well known in the\nJewish community, as one can imagine, and my mother had just terrific memories and\nshe always talked about him after he passed away. But I was about nine years old when\nhe died, so I remember him. When we would go visit our parents in our store, we would\ntake a walk and go say hello to him, or we would meet him sometimes on the street and I\nremember every time we met him, he would reach in his little pocket, which 1s -- he had a\nwatch in the pocket, watch with a chain, and he would pull out a coin. A Yugoslav coin\nwas called a dinar. He always had a dinar for me. That was good for an ice cream or a\ncouple of candies. So ah -- we had tremendous memories of him. Our grandmother, she\nwas a little bit rougher. She didn\u2019t have the finesse to deal with the little children. So our\nmemories are not as good as -- about her. Now, my other grandmother, I remember her.\nShe was a very hard working woman. She was a good cook and a good baker and she\nmade lots of sweets, which we always enjoyed. She would ship them to us. Once a year\nwe would get a package of all kinds of goods, jellies, marmalades, cookies. Even a\nhomemade salami, occasionally, which I didn\u2019t care too much for, because it had an\nonion-y smell to it. But these are memories of a childhood. Since then, I learned to love\nonions.",
        "Q: Can you talk some about the role that your faith played in your family when you were\ngrowing up? What was -- What were the habits of how your family observed their faith?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, our faith was a central thing in our lives. Both my mother and father had\ngrown up in the religious homes. We are what is known na -- here, as Sephardic, which,\nfor those who don\u2019t know, means that we are descendant of the Jews who lived in Spain,\nand after the expulsion, they went to either Turkey, or they went to Genoa and crossed\nover to Italy, or they went to Turkey and moved with the Turkish occupation. They\nmoved further up and of course Sarajevo was Turkish outpost and that\u2019s where they --\nthey must have come that route, I think. Although Split was settled by Jews of Italian\ndescent, which means that the most people who live 1 -- most Jews who lived in Split,\ncame from Spain, through Genoa, through Italy, and crossed over the Adriatic, into Split.\nAs I said, our -- our religion played a central role in our lives. We observed all of the\nholidays, quite religiously. We never went to school on any of the Jewish holidays. We\nmaintained a kosher home, and we -- the education was such in Yugoslavia, that the\nprimary subject in the public school was religion. So, because we were a very small\nminority, when the priest would come to teach religion, we would be excused, we would\nhave a free period. And there is a payback, later we would have to go twice a week to the\n-- some facility, usually was one central school, well all -- where all the Jewish kids\nwould come and we would have Jewish education, which consisted of course, of\nreligious observances, Hebrew, history and well, songs and such. That\u2019s about what I\nremember, as a young child.",
        "Q: Can you remember anything -- and perhaps share it with us, that your parents taught\nyou, not just about religion, but the -- the place of Jews in your town? Where did they fit\ninto town? Do you remember them talking about that, or what was your perception of\nwhere they fit?",
        "A: Well, I think the Jews were in -- in the town of Split, they were pretty well integrated\nwith the general community. Most of the Jews in Split were either small merchant -- and\nI\u2019m emphasizing small, or they were professional people, doctors, lawyers, accountants,\nand such. So, I don\u2019t think that there was too much distinction, as I was growing up. The\n-- We had, in the neighborhood, we were totally integrated and in the business\ncommunity, you sa -- s -- have, let\u2019s say, shoe stores, there would be several of them, one\nmight be owned by a Jewish family. The rest would be owned by the local, whatever\nreligion. Prevailing religion in Split, was of course, Roman Catholicism, and -- but they\nalso had a few, I guess you might call them Serbian Orthodox, or Eastern Orthodox, but\nprevailing Serbs. So, we were -- as kids we were lumped with s-some of the Eastern\nOrthodox in school, because we were the ones -- we and them, were the ones who were\ntold we can be excused during the religious instructions in the class. But the classes were\nconducted still -- there was a big crucifix on the wall and everybody had to say the\nCatholic prayers, which we would just stand up and not say them. But this was true fo --\nboth of us, and the Serbian Orthodox kids. And some -- some classes, there were a few of\nthose and few Jews. Sometimes I would be the only one of my faith or only one who was\nnot a Roman Catholic. So I -- I didn\u2019t feel too much of a -- a burden, and especially when\nit was time to be excused. I accepted that gladly. Yeah?",
        "Q: What was the reaction when you stood and you did not say the Catholic prayers?",
        "A: Well, I think that -- I had a teacher who liked me. I was the best student in class. That\nwas my -- I don\u2019t know whether that was a burden I carried, but I enjoyed studies. So --\nAnd I was a very, very small kid for my age. Everybody towered over me. So everybody\nconsidered me like a -- I don\u2019t know, like a little puppy and the teacher did, too. I\nremember now, that I\u2019m being asked to recall some of these things, I remember I would\nbe cuddled by every teacher over there. We didn\u2019t have any male teachers, just female\nteachers, and they were all single, not -- none of them usually were married. Anyway, so,\nnobody ever said anything. I -- I know, in fact, later on, at one point, I learned from\nsomebody that there was a possibility of having an interfaith prayer. So I suggested that,\nand she accepted it for awhile. I guess she was reprimanded later on. But this came --\nThere was at -- somebody who had left Romania and moved to Yugoslavia and this one\nyoung girl said that they had that ecumenical prayers. So she gave me the translation of\nthe Romanian ecumenical prayer, which I -- which is the one that I brought to my\nteacher, and that\u2019s the one that was tried, for awhile, anyway.",
        "Q: So a-at this point, you\u2019re quite comfortable and assertive about who you are?",
        "A: Today, you mean?",
        "Q: No, at this point, 1-in your life.",
        "A: Oh, you -- you mean like [indecipherable]",
        "Q: You\u2019re -- You\u2019re a young boy, but you\u2019re very clear about saying that you were quite\ncomfortable with the mix of people and also saying that I am Jewish and I would like my\nfaith included here, if possible.",
        "A: Yeah, well, that was true for a long while. However, the situation started changing\nwith the political situation. And I would say the first changes were when Hitler took over\nAustria and there was pressure on every country nearby, to sign up with the axis powers.\nSo, there was again, like I mentioned to you earlier, I was told once not to talk about\npolitics, but this is not politics, this is -- this relates to the Holocaust. There was a party in\nthe -- in that area, the Croatian area, called Ustashi and they were beginning to rise up,\nwith assistance from the Austrian government and later from the Germans. And they\nwere agitating, and of course, they took the same -- Hitler\u2019s, you know, values, and\npreachings and that\u2019s -- at that point, started getting somewhat -- more and more\nuncomfortable for us. In fact, occasionally, we w -- we would be attacked by the local\nkids and I\u2019m not talking about stealing our lunch, or anything like that, although that took\nplace on occasions, but just for the sake of playing the role that they heard from their\nparents, who were sympathizers of the Fascist governments.",
        "Q: C-Can you do -- remember one of those incidents, just so we could get a clearer\npicture of it?",
        "A: Oh yeah, very much so. The -- Split was located on the sea and there were areas, the\nbeach, and Saturday morning I was always at the synagogue and we didn\u2019t have school\nSaturday and others -- friends of mine my age, and I, we -- we were pretty close, so\nSaturday after the services, we would go for a walk, and there was areas in the city that\nwere well known for people walking. But we would go further, we would go to the areas\nthat are beach fronts and in the winter months this was sort of nice, because it wasn\u2019t\ncrowded -- it wasn\u2019t too crowded. There were people there, because Split was in a -- I\nwon\u2019t call it temperate zone, but it was very comfortable, especially if you could be\nshielded from the wind, and our beaches were shielded. So, we would go walk, maybe\neven take our shoes off and walk in the -- on the surf. And sometimes, or one time,\nwasn\u2019t just one time, but often, some of these other kids from the neighborhood would\nstart throwing the rocks at us, and stones. And, you know, I learned to fling rock pretty\nwell, also, but they were usually in the majority, so we always ended up at the short end\nof the stick.",
        "Q: H-How did you know that -- How did you interpret this, or how did you know or feel\nthat it was because you were a -- a Jewish boy?",
        "A: Well, there was no doubt, because they accompanied their attacks with vocal attacks,\ntoo. So there was no doubt why they were doing it. They -- They made it quite clear, so --",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit more about how things started to shift? I guess when you were\nfairly young, things were pretty good and calm and -- and you felt comfortable. But then,\nas you said, Hitler came on the scene and things started to shift. If you could just tell us a\nlittle bit more how that started to alter life in your town? Things that your parents said to\nyou perhaps, or you overheard?",
        "A: Okay, well, first of all, when Hitler started coming on the scene, maybe 1935 or \u201836, I\nwas only six or seven years old. But in those areas, we -- the kids, six, seven, we were\npretty aware of what was going on, because we had to be and we heard our parents listen\nto the radi -- I mean, we heard them talk, listen to the radio intensively. You know,\neverybody had to keep quiet while they were listening to the news and what was going\non. And so we were quite aware. And at first -- well, the first signs, we knew that there\nwas an effort being made to teach the Jewish community, the grown ups, the adults, teach\nthem some form of a trade, because they were saying, 1n case you have to leave in a\nhurry, how are you going to support yourself unless you have a trade, something that you\ncan do with your hands. So there was -- a few courses were set up in a club that we had,\nlike photography, like working with the leather, tailoring. I know my sister took up\nsewing and she learned pretty well how to sew.",
        "Q: Which sister?",
        "A: My older sister. Her name was Blanca, named after my paternal grandmother.\nAnyway, she -- she was very young in those days, too, but she learned how to sew and\nlater on she really made -- made her living sewing and even during the war, when we\nwould get some pictures from her, she would show us the same dress that she had\nchanged and every year it\u2019s look different. That was the only dress she owned. Anyway,\nSO We -- we Sort of saw that things were not going too well in the rest of the world, for the\nJews. And we were conscious, so this learning a trade was one thing --",
        "Q: J-Just to clarify, this 1s the people in the Jewish community saying to each other, we\nmust learn a trade and we will therefore provide these courses?",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t anybody else?",
        "A: No, more than the people in the com -- Jewish community. The Jewish community,\nthe organized Jewish community would engage some tradesmen to teach the trades. Like\nmaybe on Tuesdays and Thursdays, there would be electrical trade and the carpentry and\nleather --",
        "Q: Preparation?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And maybe on Wednesday would be sewing and cooking and stuff like that, for\nwomen. So this was an organized effort. But then came a few other signs. For instance,\nsome of the instructors -- my sister, her first year in the gymnasium -- first year\ngymnasium is equivalent to fifth grade. She was two years ahead, she was two years\nolder than I was, so she was telling us how her instructor was making anti-Semitic\nremarks to the class. And of course, kids caught on and they emulated their professors.\nAnd also, there were a few of my, quote, friends, that they would sort of jokingly make\nan-anti-Semitic remarks, and -- while they\u2019re hugging me and all that, or trying to copy\nfrom my homework, they would still make those remarks. So there was no question this\nwas happening as gradually as one can perceive it. And in the meantime, the war started\nin -- well, there was the Czechoslovakian take over, what we call peace in our times, and\nthen the war started in Poland, that\u2019s 1939. By that time I was 10 years old and I saw\nwhat was going on in the world and so did everybody around us. And we saw the signs,\nwe would see the -- these Ustashi, they would have their meetings. I don\u2019t know how to\nequate this to the current situation. Would be almost like Blacks living integrated with the\nWhite community, but every Tuesday night, the White community would don the white\nsheets and hoods, you know. And so, is that a sign of something? I guess that would\nindicate, you know, that if -- in case of some trouble, you could not rely on your\nneighbors too well. So, that was another sign.",
        "Q: D-Do you remember your father or mother talking to you about this, or you assing --\nasking them about it, or perhaps your grandfather?",
        "A: No, my grandfather, by that time, the one in Split, Haim Kabiljo, my maternal\ngrandfather, he had passed away and my grandmother passed away a few months later,\nwell, 10 months later. And the ones in as -- near Sarajevo, I wasn\u2019t in contact with them,\nexcept, well, once or twice we visited. But it wasn\u2019t so simple to go there. So, anyway,\nmy parents, they had friends in the community, Jewish friends, and they would come visit\nus, and in our house and in the our si -- our area of the Jewish community, language that\nwas spoken among my parents and their friends was what we call Ladino. This 1s, for\nthose who are not aware, it\u2019s a Spanish origin, which is laced with words from every\ncountry where they travel. As -- I could give you examples how, maybe Italians take a\nword, English word, put a vowel ending to it and give it ail or a la article and --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsak Mike Danon. This is tape number one, side B.",
        "A: Anyway, I -- I have some Italian friends and I know they take an English word and\ngive it an ending, a vowel ending, put an article, like you know, whatever kind of article,\nI mean masculine or feminine and it becomes an Italian word, and into the next\ngeneration it may still remain. Well, Ladino is created that way and I can equate it like\nYiddish is a German laced with Polish, Russian, whate -- other language, wherever the\nJews lived in those days. So, Ladino was the prevalent language among my parent\u2019s\nfriends and we learned the language very early, so our parents couldn\u2019t talk secrets in our\npresence, we knew what was going on. Anyway, so they -- they talked very somberly\nabout the world\u2019s situation in those days and, you know, it\u2019s contagious. Whatever your\nparents fears and th-thoughts are, you -- you catch on to it and you emulate.",
        "Q: We haven\u2019t introduced your -- your two sisters, so I\u2019d just -- get you to say their\nnames and the order of their births.",
        "A: Okay. I -- I had three sisters. One was older than I was. She was born in May fif --\nMay 15, 1927, two years older than me. And then I have a sister Sarah. She was born in\nJanuary fifth, 1931 and I have a sister Esther and she was born September -- correct,\nOctober 30th, 1935. And my older sister, Blanca, she passed away in 1993, she had\nbreast cancer. And my two other sisters, Sarah lives in Philadelphia, and Esther lives in\nBaltimore. And well, s -- Sarah, right now is what they call a snowbird. She\u2019s currently in\nFlorida, to avoid the winter.",
        "Q: Can you just think back about your house when you were growing up and what kind\nof values your parents were teaching you, and how.",
        "A: Oh, okay, well, the values that my parents taught us, are the values that I like to teach\nmy children and I hope that I have been able to instill in them, some of the values. One,\nthat I keep telling my children, my father always had something for the poor people.\nThey never were turned away and they used to come quite often to the house and to our\nstore. He taught us never to let -- let them leave without giving them something, at least -\n- no matter how small it was. I know we would walk down the street and somebody\nwould -- some of the what yo -- we call today, street people or homeless people, they\nwould be sitting on the sidewalk, they would stick their hand out and my father, like we\nwould pass there, my father would stop, take out the coin, give it to us and tell us to hand\nit to the beggar. But there was even more to that. He would -- Well, this one thing I\nremember. There was a guy that was really down and out in his luck and h-- he would\nbeg. He was an immigrant to our community, he was a Jewish young man and he didn\u2019t\ncare for begging, so my father one time suggested to him, why doesn\u2019t he buy some nuts\nand salt them and toast them and make little bags and sell them? And he did that and I\nremember our father would always buy two or three bags. He didn\u2019t like the nuts, but he\nbought them, because this was a way of supporting somebody. And only recently, I was\nreading about the life of Mimonides, the philosopher and the Jewish theologian, of the\nwhat, tw -- 12th century? He -- 12th, yeah. Anyway, and he had -- he wrote on every\nsubject conceivable and one of them was charity. And he had -- he sort of set up eight\nlevels of charity. And I know the highest level is helping somebody become independent\nand this is what my father believed in. We also believed that the children should get\nbetter education that their parents had and we -- we were sent to school, we -- wh-when\nthe war started, Jews were not allowed to go to school, and I think I mentioned that the\nprofessors, of course, couldn\u2019t teach, so what we did, we created a Jewish school. The\nprofessors that were fired from their jobs, they were employed to teach the Jewish kids\nwho were not allowed to go to school. Well, my father, he had a little misunderstanding\nwith somebody, so he didn\u2019t send us to school, but he engaged tutors to come to our\nhouse and teach us things. So, oh -- also, he was teaching us the religious subjects and we\nlearned a lot in the house. When we would go to religious school, we were always top\nstudents and like, let\u2019s say if I was in third grade, I would usually be placed with kids of\nthe fifth grade or sixth grade, because of the -- my level of knowledge of the particular\nsubject. My mother was a very, very hard working person, I guess by necessity, because\nmy father didn\u2019t work. We had the store, but he would just go there in the evening. My\nmother would go early in the morning, open up the place and she would be there all day.\nAnd in those days, you opened the store about eight o\u2019clock in the morning, you closed it\nat 12, you went home for lunch. You went at four, you re-opened and it was opened til\neight o\u2019clock. This is, I think throughout Europe, they had this. Some people call it siesta.\nIn summer, I guess, people would go home, eat, and go to sleep for a couple hours. What\nelse did we learn? We learned -- One time I found a wallet that belonged to a\nconstruction supervisor and he was ready to fire half of his staff and -- and my -- I ran\nhome with it and my father told me to go back and find who it belongs to. \u201cDon\u2019t give it\nto anybody until you\u2019re very sure that you find the rightful owner.\u201d And I remember, I\nhad looked inside, there was a lot of money in it, but the guy only gave me one dinar as a\nreward and I was pretty unhappy about it. But my father told me that the return of the\nwallet was a reward in itself. I\u2019m a little choked up now, talking about these things\nbecause it brings memories. So, maybe if you give me five minutes to get back to my\nown self, yeah?",
        "Q: I want to shift now, to what you remember about your parents actually making plans\nso that you and your father could leave at a moment\u2019s notice. You mentioned in your first\ninterview, that you actually had little rucksacks, little backpacks packed. Can you\nremember how that came about and the actual packing of them?",
        "A: Well yeah, that\u2019s really what everybody in the Jewish community had done. Well, let\nme mention something like, when the war came, the food became pretty scarce. So, we\nwere lucky that we were occupied by the Italian forces. Now, what I need to mention 1s\nmaybe we skipped quite a bit here, because the war came to Yugoslavia in April, \u201841 and\nthis -- your question pertains to our leaving Split, which took place after the -- Mussolini\nfell, after the government of Italy and what they call capitulation, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Well, one reason I think it\u2019s -- it\u2019s probably okay to skip some, is because of your\nprior interview. I think that you covered that very carefully.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And in some detail. So, un-unless there\u2019s something specific -- I remember you\nspeaking about the Italian occupation and how lucky you were and then how it changed.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So, if there\u2019s something you would like to say, that would be fine, but I -- I think that\nprobably it would be okay to -- to skip and try to fill in just some of that detail.",
        "A: Oh, okay. No, there\u2019s n-nothing special that I needed to or wanted to add, but I was\njust trying to give it perspective, and -- well, and our departure was preceded by when the\nItalian government fell. Of course, the -- the Italian army was let go, you know. This mis\n-- the general population just rushed the -- the what do you call it, we call them kasir --\nkasirna, which is the military complex that was right in our neighborhood where the m --\nthe s-soldiers lived. Anyway, and it wa -- they had the storage of food there and\nammunition, so everybody rushed there. I was watching people carrying bags of flour\nand wheat and you know, all kinds of canned stuff. An-Anyway, so then the partisans\ncame to the surface and it was -- before that, 1t was underground. Now, there was enough\npartisans, they came from the mountain, they organized the local population and there\nwas partisan units marching through the street. If I can mention, Split was a city -- I call it\na town, but it was a city of 50,000 people. It was the biggest city in Dalmatia, the coastal\n-- coastal area and much of the interior. It was the, I guess the capital of the -- like we\nhave states, they had these -- well, there was -- Yugoslavia was subdivided into -- it\u2019s not\nkingdo -- the kingdom was the whole count -- I will have to remember this word, the\ntranslation of the word later. And -- But Split was the capital of one of these, call them\nstates, if -- until I get a better term for it. And so it was a pretty large city. I mean, I\nremember with pride, looking at the big, tall building, eight floors, nine floors, another\none, you know. So, 1-it was wide avenues, tree line avenues, you know, all that. So, the\ncity was sizable and now we saw all these -- the partisans and their insignia was a red star\nand -- on the cap it was a -- like a military cap, you know, with a red star 1n front of it.\nAnd the population started participating, and they would have these meetings, town\nmeetings and you would get maybe 5,000 people show up for the meeting and there was\nsomebody speaking about, you know, we have to arm ourselves and we have to chase the\noccupation and we\u2019re -- have to do this and that, you know. So there was a lot of\nenthusiasm.",
        "Q: Just a clarification.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: This 1s after the Italian soldiers left, but before any Germans came in?",
        "A: That 1s -- That is correct. This was like a -- maybe what, 20 day, about three weeks in\nthere, where the partisans were able to hold on to this quote, major city for the area. So,\nthat was -- was like pretty wild and also like the partisans would conduct trials of the\npeople who had collaborated and in -- there would be signs and you know, posters saying\nhow many were convicted and shot and all that. It was -- maybe it was kangaroo court\ntype, it was very swift and pretty -- I won\u2019t say brutal, but it was swift and final for many\npeople who had collaborated. It was a very sharp division. You\u2019re either with us or\nyou\u2019re with them kind of thing. So the population had committed themselves. And then\nthere was -- the German troops were trying to come into the city, but they were hel --\nthey were held in check at a place where the Turks were held in check several hundred\nyears earlier, the Ottoman empire was held, because it\u2019s such a terrain, the rough terrain,\nmountains and cliffs, that you can position yourself and you know, it was that kind of\nwarfare that people could establishing -- establish themself and prevent even motorized\nunits and tanks from advancing. So, partisans were able to hold off the German troops for\na very long time. And in those days, we were wondering what will happen if the partisans\ndon\u2019t hold the line and the Germans do come. And we didn\u2019t know -- We didn\u2019t think of\nan if, we were thinking of when, yeah. And that\u2019s -- in those days, we just did what\neverybody was aware that had to be done, namely prepare, so you can make a quick\ngetaway by whatever means. Some people were thinking of getting a little boat and going\nto the islands that were near Split. But that wasn\u2019t so safe, because Germany and\nCroatians that were armed by the Germans, the puppet government, they had better\nmeans than the partisans. Partisans were living off the support that they could get from\ngeneral population. But Germans were pretty rough if they caught somebody helping the\npartisans, they burned the entire town. And later on, I remember seeing towns, just\neverything -- no house had a roof on it, because the roof was burned, you know. The rest\nwas made out of stone, or bricks, so it couldn\u2019t burn, but 1-it was -- or, 1f maybe partisans\nwould kill a German person, the German would just take hundred at random and shoot\nthem. That -- They -- They wouldn\u2019t have to be guilty or they wouldn\u2019t have to be\npartisans or anything, just hundred citizens, or hundred men, ju -- 0-out of the town, they\nwould take them at random, put them against the wall and shoot them. So -- Okay, so we\nare in this situation where everybody\u2019s wondering -- you know, the partisans said you\nhave to be either with us or with them, and during those 20 days, lots of people said,\n\u201cWe're with the partisans.\u201d So when the Germans were coming, then all of these people\nwho had declared themselves to be with the partisans, had to find a way to leave. And the\nJewish population, of course, would be the first victims of the German onslaught. And\nGermans were bad enough, but Croatians were worse. So -- Anyway, sO we were just\ncognizant of these [indecipherable] and we were ready -- what did it take? Not much. I\nmean, it\u2019s just, like my father had a bigger backpack, I remember and he put a, you know,\na sweater, a pair of shoes, some underwear and there was some, I remember, I don\u2019t\nknow if you know what zwieback 1s? It\u2019s a hard, hard -- it\u2019s not bread, it\u2019s like a, yeah,\ncrust of some sort. Anyway, so I know he had brought that. He was in the military, the\nYugoslav military two years earlier, when it was general mobilization, so he brought a\ncouple of those zwiebacks and I remember, we tried to bite into it, impossible. So he put\nthose in his, you know, backpack and of course we put -- we all, each kid had something\nthat they made ready and after we left, my other sisters, my younger sisters, they\nremained. Oh, my older sister, she joined the partisans immediately. She was 16 at the\ntime. Yeah, here.",
        "Q: Was this in the 20 day period?",
        "A: In the 20 day period, yeah, but we had learned -- my parents had learned that she was\nin the underground before that. I remember when they found out about that. That was\nvery traumatic, you know, she -- well, this was like she begged them to understand\nwhat\u2019s going on. Of course they were, you know, petrified from fear. But anyway, so she\nleft in the first day or two of the partisan liberation, but the other two sisters, I remember\n-- not I remember, they keep telling us the story, how they practiced jumping from the\nsecond story window, you know, on the -- on the back of the house, to get away. But we\ndidn\u2019t do that, we -- we had these knaps -- knapsacks or backpack or whatever. We used\nto call them rucksacks, that\u2019s, I guess, the German term. Anyway, w-we left in the middle\nof the night, but we were walking out of the house, through the front door, we don\u2019t have\nto jump out of the window. And as we were leaving, so were many other -- others from\nthe city. You know, the ones who had committed themselves to the partisan cause, to the\nanti-Fascist, anti-Ustashi cause. They were all leaving the city. There was almost a major\nevacuation at the time.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion your sister had with your parents,\nthat you apparently heard. What was she trying to communicate, or what was she saying\nabout why she was doing what she was doing?",
        "A: Well, she explained to them that, you know, there was in-injustice in the world and\nthat she wants to do her part. And they were saying, you know, \u201cWell, you\u2019re young and\nyou\u2019re so little and frail and what can you do wi -- to help with,\u201d and she was saying,\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mor -- everyone needs to do it. If we let them do these things to us and nobody\nresists, how can we ex-- expect to survive? The-They\u2019 ll have always an upper hand.\u201d But\nanyway, my parents were -- were terrified, because they didn\u2019t know what the future\nwould bring to her, and to us, if it\u2019s discovered. There was -- There were a few things\ngoing on, you know, like occasionally leaflets would be distributed by people like her\nand they -- also there was armed -- armed attacks on the occupation troops and I know --\nI could tell what -- something happened because next day or immediately, there would be\ncurfew imposed and even if it happened during a curfew, they just lowered the time.\nLike, in the middle of the summer, I remember curfew was nine o\u2019clock throughout the\nsummer, and then, after an event like that, was reduced to six o\u2019clock and then five and\nfour o\u2019clock in the afternoon, everybody had to be in their homes. So -- And the people,\nyou know, kids, 14 -15, were active participants in these things. I\u2019m not saying in the\narmed attack against the occupation, but leaflets distribution and I don\u2019t know the -- well,\nthey had books that they were reading that were, what\u2019s the word, you know, they were\nagainst the current regime and it -- people would be caught sometimes, doing these things\nand Italians -- I mean, they may have been less brutal than the Germans, but if they\nwould catch somebody, they were not very gentle with them. We knew of many people\nwho had gone -- who had been taken and they would send them to some prisons in\nsouthern Italy, on the island of Lipari. And they would come back with all kinds of wild\nstories, you know. And I know some people who used to tell us -- well, the mother of\nsome young men who were taken by the Italian troops or Fascists, anyway, they said that\nthey w -- they ironed their backs, you know, with the hot iron. But the -- One of the\nprevalent punishment was castor oil. Th-Th-They would force the people to drink a very\nlarge container of castor oil. I guess like maybe, if we use a measuring cup, like two cups,\nyou know, at a time. And I don\u2019t know if you can imagine the effect of castor oil, but you\nforget all your trouble -- all your other troubles when you have that. So anyway, my\nparents tried to dissuade my sister from participating and maybe she said that she\nwouldn\u2019t do it any more, but no, I know she continued in the activities, because at that\npoint, I was reaching the age where I was useful to the cause.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsak Mike Danon. This is tape number two, side A. Can you think back to the night that\nyou and your father left, and -- and just tell us a little bit about that, about how you said\ngoodbye and then actually -- where you actually went.",
        "A: Well, okay. When -- On this crucial night, I guess, we were awakened by the\nneighbors. These were the good neighbors. They came knocking at the door, banging,\nand I remember, \u201cMr. Danon, Mr. Danon,\u201d and, \u201cthe Germans are coming.\u201d So we got\nup, took me three seconds to get dressed, my father got dressed and we grabbed our\nbackpacks, which as I mentioned earlier, were packed with whatever we thought was\nimportant and that we could carry. Excuse me. And also, my father and my mother had\nsubdivided whatever valuables they had. In those days, one didn\u2019t carry too much cash,\nbecause was losing value, so people would buy -- they called them Napoleons. It\u2019s like a\n20 dollar gold piece, it\u2019s about this size. And you -- They would sew them in the coats\nand clothes, so they thought that nobody was going to find them, you know, but\neverybody knew the -- where to find, in case they were caught by the Germans or the\nUstashis. So -- But anyway, they subdivided what they had and I said goodbye to my\nmother. I don\u2019t believe my two younger sister were up at the time. We got out of the\nhouse, it was, of course, dark. They didn\u2019t have street lights. They had them on the main\nhighway -- on the main thoroughfares, but not in our street. And we started walking\ntoward the mountains, which were not too far from Split, because we lived in the\nsuburbs. I don\u2019t know for -- if you lived in Denver, you could see how Denver 1s flat and\nthen the mountains rise up and that\u2019s how Split was. It was near the water, you know, flat\nland and then the mountains, just all at once, straight up. So we started walking in that\ndirection and little by little we heard voices and others joined us. It was a mass exodus,\nbecause others had heard the same rumor or word that the Germans were coming. So we\nkept going. In the daylight hours, we were in the mountains. There were highways, but\nthe idea was that the Germans were going to come on the highways, with their motorized\nunits, so we walked along the road -- to the side of the road, and I remember, that was\nrough. I had a good pair of shoes, because my father had just bought himself, me and my\nsis -- older sister, a pair of shoes -- didn\u2019t buy them, but he engaged a shoemaker to make\nthem for us, yeah. And they were like the ski type, you know, the mountain, the snow.\nShoes that were very well made, the best shoes I ever had. Anyway, so --",
        "Q: Do you think he did that in preparation, in retrospect?",
        "A: Could be, could be. Could also be that he wanted to give a job to this one guy, who\nhad come from someplace else. See, Split was full of immigrants. The ti -- during the\nItalian occupation, Jewish immigrants. We had the community of maybe 200 people, all\nat once swell to four or 5,000. So it was the -- one of my father\u2019s characteristics of\nengaging people to -- like to coach us in -- well, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t attend the public\nschools, but Italian was a required language, so we had an Italian coach. And we also had\nmusic coach coming to the house, teaching me and my sister, my older sister. And this\nguy that did our shoes, he was also an immigrant, and all these people were immigrants.\nAnyway, so we met a lot of people along the way and then finally we got into a village\nand sat down and ate what we had. And [indecipherable] kept walking some more, until\nnight time and we and many others -- there were other men, mostly men and they were\nwalking to join the partisans. And we all did that. And finally we came to a town that was\nheld by the partisans, it was a -- like a command type of town. And we made ourselves\nknown that we want to join them, you know? And they --",
        "Q: How did you do that?",
        "A: Well, because th-they saw us coming, you know. Of course, th-they were hiding. So,\nsome of them approached us and we put little signs, like a little red star, to indicate what\nwe -- what our intentions are. And they interviewed us and they said, well yeah, sure, but,\nyou know, you just go with the group. And little by little, they found odd jobs for us. And\nla -- this was the system. They never -- You never came and signed up, you just\neventually came to be accepted. So --",
        "Q: Did you have to prove yourself at some level?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t so formal, allri -- you know, step by step. Eventually, like I know at\none point, I was separated from my father. It was very common, separated and then we\nmeet again and separate. And I know I was in a place where -- well, near the coastline,\nwhere there was a couple of boats, wooden boats, you know. This is a coastal area,\nfishing towns and there was a lot of these boats. Most of them were sailboats, but small\nsails, you know, you stick the sail. You leave the boat in the water, but you take the sail\nhome and then you bring it and you sail. Some also had motors, but not many. Some\nwere rowboats, almost like the Phoenician galleys, you know. But, I remember being in\nthat town and it was night time and there was a bunch of guys. Later I learned they were\npartisans, but they sort of pretended they were fishermen. And they invited me if I\nwanted some food, they were cooking something. Wasn\u2019t beans, was -- they call it\nOurzo, but it\u2019s -- that\u2019s a f -- 1t\u2019s not a wheat, it\u2019s a form of a -- what do you call it --",
        "Q: Pasta?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s grain, but 1t\u2019s oats, yeah. I think it\u2019s oats and the -- peeled, so.\nBut it\u2019s still taste like -- like the horses might like it, but not human beings. Anyway, so I\nremember that\u2019s what they served and that\u2019s what they ate and that\u2019s what they gave me\nsome of. And they were talking about what are they going to do next day and what --\nwhat unit of the Ustashis they were going to attack, you know. And I remember, as I\ntraveled through the mountains, like in different places that were held by the partisans,\nbig point of conversation, you know, would be -- somebody would read the\naccomplishment of some other units, someplace. This wasn\u2019t organized military, this was\njust somebody in another town had attacked Ustashi unit, or Ustashi sympathizers town\nand had burned so many houses and taken so many sheep. These were pastoral areas,\nmountains, but still, sheeps were the primary source of income. So they would say,\n\u201cOkay comrades, now what are we going to do?\u201d You know, \u201cAre we going to sit back\nand relax while our fellow comrades of other towns are doing all these big things?\u201d So\nthey would say, \u201cLet\u2019s go and attack them.\u201d Well, \u201cHow many rifles do we have? There\nis 12 of us, we have three rifles, well,\u201d you know, \u201chow much ammunition? Maybe we\ncan get some more guns,\u201d you know. So that\u2019s where they would go. Sometimes they\nwere successful, sometimes not. But anyway, so, this how we traveled for -- I don\u2019t\nvisualize right now, how many days or weeks, but we ended up -- I mean, through the\nmountains, but we ended up again, near the coastline. I was with my father. And there\nwas one of these wooden junks, was going -- everybody was getting on it, so we got on\nit. And went to one of the islands and I will give you the spelling of the name. H-v-a-r,\nHvar. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s where I spent a very major part of my time with the partisans. So\nanyway, we went there in the morning -- I mean, this was all -- everything -- movements\nare made during the night. Day is for hiding. This was the way of life. You hide during\nthe day, you move during the night. Tr-Travel, whether it\u2019s on foot or on a donkey, or a\nmule, or by one of these boats, was always by night and very quietly.",
        "Q: When you and your father left to go join the partisans, how -- what kind of decision\nwas that? Was that a political decision, to go fight the good fight, or was it more a\ndecision to -- to s -- to make sure that you and your father would not have to come face to\nface with the Nazis, to be safe, or how would you characterize the decision?",
        "A: Well, the decision to fight never entered my mind nor my father\u2019s mind. Yeah, that\nwas my older sister. We were trying to save our skins, frankly. My father, let\u2019s see, how\nold was he at the time? I would say he was 40, and he had fought in the -- this war that\nwas brought to Yugoslavia, in 1941. They had general mobilization and he -- he didn\u2019t\nhave very pleasant memories from that. I mean, he was in there long enough, but I know\nhe didn\u2019t care for the experience. And I was much too young. I was 13 years old, you\nknow. I wasn\u2019t going to fight anywhere. So we just left the town when we heard the\nGermans are coming, and there was no other place to go but the mountains. And if you\njoined the partisans, you\u2019re -- hopefully, you\u2019re with some -- some organize group.\nOtherwise, you\u2019re on your own, and how do you survive on your own in a strange town,\nyou know? And again, the general population of that area was peasant. You know, they\nlive off the land, either as shepherds or as farmers. Once you got into the mountain, there\nwas not much farming, except maybe around your house, you know. No extensive\nfarming of any kind, anywhere. In the lowlands, where I lived, they had like -- grapes\nwas the big thing. And fruit, fruit, different kind. Figs, peaches, cherries. But figs was a\nbig fruit and grapes -- many, many of the people, they live off the grapes. They -- you\nknow, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes in to this and th -- once they collect the grapes and\nsquish them for a wine. You know, st -- stomp it and whatever they do. We all have seen\nmovies how that\u2019s done. I used to see that done personally, all our neighbors were that,\nyeah. Anyway, so after that, it\u2019s nothing else to do the rest of the year. Well, anyway, so\nmy father was a city dweller, if you will, and he couldn\u2019t survive in the mountains,\namong the -- the suther way of life, you know. So, he was out of place, and I guess the\nentire Jewish community would be out of place in the rural -- well, more than rural, it\u2019s in\nthe peasant type environment, you know. Farming or sheep-herding or animal, you know,\nlife, because they were not accustomed to it. There is -- Just to dissuade anybody that --\nthat\u2019s in the Jewish genes, they proved in Israel that they can be good farmers and\neverything else. But in this type of situation, we didn\u2019t have that background. So,\nanyway, we came to the partisans to be a part of a organized society, where we could\nsurvive and of course, make our contribution, whatever is needed. And we were accepted,\nI guess. There was a place for everybody and once we got into this place on Hvar, they\nfound a place for me, too, and I was still 13 years old. I was placed in a machine shop, I\nguess. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s the best -- the best description of it. But machine shop was making\n-- well, we were repairing ammunition, we were even making some of the things for the\nmi -- for the partisans, for the military or partisans. I remember, oh there were two kids\nyounger than me in this unit. We were three kids assigned to this unit. One was 11 year\nold, and one was 12. All f -- All came from Split, similar route that we came. What we\nwere doing, actually, is generating power. It\u2019s a -- like a bicycle, you would just go, you\nknow, drive this bike, stationary bike, but would generate power for the units that they\nhad. We would fill the batteries, you know, we would do -- and we would also stoke the\novens, you know, for the -- the guy -- blacksmiths, you know. They weren\u2019t shoeing\nhorses, they were making things out of -- well, let\u2019s say the guns -- I mean the weapons\nneeded certain parts, steel part, they -- they wouldn\u2019t have it. They take a piece of steel\nand -- and by hand and hammer, you know. Get it into the [indecipherable] and just beat\nit and grind it and make the part, whatever it takes, whatever time it takes, you know.\nAnd they would fix rifles, they would fix machine guns, occasionally, you know. And I\nremember they even had a big searchlight that came to be fixed. And we, the kids were\ndoing -- even our job was making -- what the -- would you call it, it was for disinfecting\nclothes or whatever for the hospital. You take -- We would take a barrel of the -- for oil\nbarrel, split it in half -- and this was pretty heavy steel, split it in half, and finish up th --\nwith the -- I don\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t know in English how you call these things to -\n- like a file. Yeah, file it down, fix it so it doesn\u2019t scratch. Then we would take a metal\nsheet, roll it and we would make grooves on both ends, so y-you have like roll. And beat\nthe ends together, then we cut a piece for the bottom, make holes in it. So this was a\nbarrel inside the barrel and on one you would put water and the other one would hold it\nclosed, because steam gives you more heat to kill the germs. You couldn\u2019t just boil it\nbecause you only get 212 in boiling water, 212 degrees, but steam, you can really make\nit, I don\u2019t know what, 400 - 500, whatever. So this was one of the jobs that we, the kids,\ndid. But these other kids used to tell stories about how they would, before they came to\nHvar, they were engaged in real battles, Germans and the Ustashi were -- had these\nbunkers and the kids job was to sneak, crawl on the ground to the bunker and then just\nlob hand grenade into the small holes in the bunker. And they could do it very silently, so\nthey would not be detected. So the kids were useful for that, wher -- whereas grownup\nper -- person would be detected much easier, the kid knew how to wiggle his way to the\nbunker and do this kind of job.",
        "Q: Now, in -- in this time that you\u2019re with the partisans, do you have any contact with\nyour sister, who -- who is part of them?",
        "A: No, no. My sister -- First of all, partisans had to fight and run and move and all that.\nWhen we did -- We didn\u2019t know who was alive and who was not. We didn\u2019t know -- we\nleft my mother and two sisters in Split. We had no idea whether they were still alive. My\nfather, one time, was th -- I don\u2019t know whether he was trying to comfort himself, or --\nnot comfort, but whether he was just trying to be able to talk about it to somebody. He\nwas telling me how, in one of the announcements of the partisans, said how Germans had\ncaught a unit of the partisans from Split and how they -- there was some females, and\nhow they were tortured and all that stuff. And he says, \u201cYou think that your sister was\none of those girls that they\u2019re talking about?\u201d And I said I didn\u2019t know. I mean, we -- we\ndidn\u2019t -- there was no contact. Partisans -- Yugoslav partisans were all over the country,\nit\u2019s like one would not say, let\u2019s say, if somebody wa -- is in the Ame-American army,\neven today is -- maybe somebody is down Georgia and the other is in Massachusetts.\nYou know, it\u2019s same army, but no contact. You don\u2019t know who 1s who, this is war, and\nit -- they didn\u2019t have, you know, well organized, it was just scattered people and units\nand no, there was no way one could tell who was where and what and how.",
        "Q: I want to ask you to sort of think -- I want to ask you to think and reflect on your\nwhole family, with this question, which is that, how do you make sense of the fact, that\nwhen the war came, everyone in your family was a very tenacious person and survivor.\nThey met it with tenacity. Your sister Blanca went off to fight with the partisans. You\nand your father went off to join the social organization. And then, as you said in your\nfirst interview, your mother and your sisters -- and your little nine year old sister led your\n-- your mother into hiding. Where do you think that quality came from in your family, of\nmeeting this horrible situation with such determination?",
        "A: Well, I think circumstances mostly to be given credit for. I -- I take no credit for me,\nas being tenacious or organized or courageous, none of those characteristics would fit my\n-- my psyche, I guess. No, what -- what happened, we were just being swept by events\nand locations and developments as they were taking place. I mean, you make do,\nwherever you are, you do what one needs to do to survive. And I really don\u2019t feel that I\nhad any of these characteristics that you\u2019re attributing. But, my sister -- my sister Sarah,\nwho led my mother when she was nine years old, she -- she had this characteristic,\nleadership, strength of her conviction and all that. Even today, she is very forceful person\nand she can -- she can get people to tell her anything that she wants to -- out of them, you\nknow, I mean, from a strictly social or friendly perspective. No, she -- she had that\ncharacteristic, which I did not, and I still don\u2019t. No, I\u2019m, in every respect, all my life, I\nbeen low profile person. This happened to be a period of let\u2019s see, the courage was\nneeded to survive, but I can tell you some stories, within a year from this period that will\nprove to you that I was a -- what shall I say, a Milquetoast, a weenie, a weakling.",
        "Q: Tell me one of those stories.",
        "A: Okay. One story. After we left Yugoslavia, we ended up in Italy and one day, I was\nwith a bunch of kids in the neighborhood. We were playing around and there was an\nopen well. So one of the kids had dropped a stick in the well, and I saw it floating. The\nwell didn\u2019t look too deep, the water level was way up, so -- and it was floating. So I\ndecided that I could recover the stick for this young man -- young man, kid, maybe 10 -\n11 years old. So, the well had a little retaining wall around the hole and there was a little\nhole at the bottom of the retaining wall, I think it was intended as a drainage. After the\nrain, the water would go into the well. I didn\u2019t know the principles of how the water gets\ninto the well, but \u2019m now debating it. Anyway, so from -- I put one of my legs in this\nretaining wall and the other I straddle the retaining wall, and I put another leg -- another\nfoot into the hole and I held myself with one hand on the retaining wall, while with the\nother one I tried to reach. Well, this hole in the retaining wall got slippery. There was\nmoss or s-something, some green groth -- growth on it. Anyway, my foot slipped and I\nended up hanging by one hand, with my body inside the well, hanging. And I held, first I\nheld for the dear life, with my fingers, and there was -- I couldn\u2019t hold with the whole\nhand, I just was hanging on by the four fingers and it got very painful and in my mind,\nvery quickly, I decided this was too painful. If I let go, I might drown, but what the heck,\nit\u2019s less painful than holding on, and -- because my fingers were breaking and the pain\nwas excruciating. So I let go. Luckily, the well wasn\u2019t too deep. It was a wide well,\nwasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t a real type of well, was just a water collection poin --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsak Mike Danon. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: Anyway, the story, it\u2019s a little bit long story. The kids went yelling, \u201cMike fell in the\nwa -- in the well,\u201d and then my father came running much later. By that time, I was\nalready pulled out by somebody else, and he was -- he thought that I had drowned. But,\naside from that, 1t proves that I cannot tolerate pain, and I rather just find the easy way\nout of any situation. But, so tha -- there goes my [indecipherable] was shattered.",
        "Q: Two more questions about this -- this period.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: One, did you ever hear anything about what happened to Jews who stayed in Split\nwhen the Germans came, wh-who didn\u2019t go with the partisans, who didn\u2019t go into\nhiding?",
        "A: Yeah. Their end was pretty swift. They were taken and they were sent to a\nextermination camp in Croatia called Yasinovats. Yasinovats was a killing field, like\nAuschwitz and Dachau and all that. And, as we speak, there is a guy that was in charge of\nthat camp. He had a happy life in Argentina, I believe -- is it Argentina? Anyway, he was\njust recently sent to Croatia for trial, but who is going to try him but the same kind of\npeople that were in charge then, his buddies? So I\u2019m sure he will come out smelling like\na rose, because they already named streets for him as a hero, and all that. So, y-you know",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure of his name, something like Savage or Sabage, I\u2019m not sure right now,\nbut this is very recent. In fact, I\u2019m sure that the Holocaust Memorial Museum, or\nwhatever unit, would have that information, yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me any more that you heard about, what actually happened in your\nvillage, or for instance, to your house?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Not in your village, in your city.",
        "A: [indecipherable] city. Yeah, I can tell you, sure, what happened. We didn\u2019t own the\nhouse, we rented. The house was owned -- we -- the house where we lived, was owned\nby a guy who had immigrated to United States, worked here in the steel mills and send\nmoney to, quote, the old country. And of course, the money had higher value here. I\u2019m\nsure everybody knows the story. People would come from Europe, live, 15 - 20 of them\nin the same -- not room, but in the same apartment, work all kinds of hours, not spend\nany money on food. Everything they could save was going back to where they came\nfrom. And when they would go back there, they were rich people, or at least their\nfamilies were pretty rich. They would buy real estate. This guy bought couple of\nvineyards and he had two houses, which he was renting. Anyway, we had second floor,\nin the -- like ground floor. They call -- We called it basement and ours was called\nmezzanine, but it\u2019s first and second floor, and then there was a third. In the ground floor\nlived an old man. His wife had died while I was young. He had seven sons and three\ndaughters and he came with us to the partisans. He was a very old guy, but he was a wiry\nman, yelling at everybody, \u201cI have seven sons and two grandchildren in the partisans.\u201d\nAnd so, he -- th-th -- a -- the daughter was date -- one of the daughters was dating a\nItalian lieutenant, so I don\u2019t know what happened to them, but I -- people living above us,\nthey were Ustashis, so when we left, I\u2019m sure they had a picnic 1n our place. We had a lot\nof food that we -- my father was able to buy because, in our store -- since money was\nlosing value, lots of things were bought and sold on basis of barter -- barter. You know,\nso people would barter things, like farmers would bring some of their foodstuffs to trade\nfor the -- what they used to call -- before the war, clothes that we -- some of the stuff that\nwe couldn\u2019t sell before the war, was now in demand. It was a reject before, 1t wasn\u2019t\nmodern, wasn\u2019t anything, was leftovers. They would say, you know, \u201cI want some of that\nstuff.\u201d So we had, I guess a lot of stuff that wasn\u2019t selling before, so this became in\ndemand, because it was still the good kind of material, not the war goods, which was\nmade -- they used to say that it was made from wood. You know, it -- you soak it and\nwould fall apart. Anyway, so we had a lot of food in the house and I\u2019m sure the people\nfrom upstairs, they took it all. And the street there, that was across th -- from us, were the\npeople who came and told us that the Germans are coming. And then there was a few\nothers that -- my middle sister, Sarah, she was friendly with a girl there, and she went to\nvisit her, recently. The place was still there, the same, everything -- nothing has changed,\nyou know. Th-This was in the suburbs. The houses were built of stone and cement and\nconcrete, so this was expected to, you know, stay up like that for hundreds of years,\nunless the sa -- somebody bombs it, you know, and that wasn\u2019t the case. So the -- the area\nis still the same, she told me -- my sister told me she recognized rosemarie that it was\ngrowing along the edges there and she went -- you know, knocked on the -- the house,\nand she introduced herself and, \u201cOh, come on in, yeah, you remember so and so,\u201d and oh,\nlots of reminiscing and she stayed for a meal with them. So, you know, the area is still the\nsame and everybody just got married, had kids and their kids had kids. And the life goes\non, in this area and I guess every other area in Split, and the suburbs.",
        "Q: Now, what happened to your paternal grandparents?",
        "A: My paternal grandparents, they were taken by the Germans. Actually wasn\u2019t -- may\nnot have been Germans, but it was the Croatians took over in that area, the Ustashi, and\nthe Moslems. And I have no special likes for Moslems, because they all, en masse, joined\nthe Ustashi in Bosnia. And you know, now that there was war in Bosnia and I was very\nunhappy with the United States support of those people who were the killers during\nWorld War Two. And the same people are still -- they are a little bit older, but they are\nstill there in charge and their philosophy of life is still the same one, so --",
        "Q: I want to talk more about that one later --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: -- really go in -- in depth on that.",
        "A: My father figured out how many of his relatives in -- how many in his immediate\nfamily perished when the Germans came into Yugoslavia and this happened in 1941,\nearly April in 1941. His parents were taken. He had, let\u2019s see, I think he had six brothers.\nSo there were seven men, yeah. I know -- I didn\u2019t know too many, because we didn\u2019t live\nthere and I only visited once and some of his brothers never came to visit us, so I -- I met\nsome. Some were in Sarajevo itself and some were in the suburbs in the little town where\nhe was born. They remained there. But most of them had moved to Sarajevo. And they\nand -- they were all married, their families, their sons and daughters, they were all taken,\nwith Germans. My father counted 28 total that had been taken, including his parents, and",
        "Q: Ta-Taken where?",
        "A: They were taken away and one doesn\u2019t know where. But that was the end. You know,\nthe story, if you watch \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d or if you -- there was a movie I just saw a\ncouple of weeks ago, the \u201cLife is Beautiful,\u201d and it\u2019s playing in the local theaters. It\u2019s an\nItalian movie, with English subtitles. It shows how they\u2019re taken and put in these boxcars.\nAt the museum, you have some of these boxcars. They put them, you know, how many\npeople they can squeeze in, and they close and it goes and the -- there\u2019s no record. But\nmost of the Yugoslav Jews were taken -- most of the ones in Sarajevo and our area, in\nBosnia and Croatia, those areas, were sent to Yasinovats. That\u2019s this camp that I\nmentioned earlier, and never heard from them aft -- after that.",
        "Q: Okay. I\u2019m going to jump a little bit to when you and your father have gotten to Italy,\nand then I want a -- you to remember -- you\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve told much of this story in your\nfirst interview, which you did in 1989, but I want you to remember and tell us some of\nthe details of how you were reunited with your mother and sisters. And -- And a little bit\nabout what that was like.",
        "A: Well, 1 -- I told the story how my father and I, although we went to Italy separately,\nbut we met there. And we were placed by the British, in a town in Italy called Santa\nMaria. This was the beaches with the villas, which were owned by, I guess northern\nItalian, or people from all over the world, maybe, but were occupied only in the season.\nSo this happened to be winter and happened to be war and the occupying powers needed\nthe facilities so they took all these villas and they put us in there. What we had was -- I\ndon\u2019t know if I mentioned that the partisans were sort of -- let me -- let me take a step\nback.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: The allies were trying to mislead the Germans into thinking that the second front\nwould be fought on that area, the Dalmatian coast, that that\u2019s where they were going to\nmake the invasion. In other words, they had -- allies had occupied Sicily and they landed\non the boot of Italy and they had gone up a little bit, but they couldn\u2019t go too far up, so\nthere was a lot of talk about second front. And the Russians, of course, they had a big\nfront, what 3,000 miles of front line and they were demanding that the a-allies, meaning\nBritish and Americans open the -- a new front, to take some of the load from the Russian\nfront. And the allies were doing this propaganda kind of thing, saying that they are\nplanning a landing on the Dalmatian coast. Split was the capital of Dalmatia. And they\nwould drop leaflets sometimes, telling the people to leave. So lots of civilians were\nleaving those areas and they were finding their way to the islands, where they were\npicked up by the allies, by British, actually, and taken to Italy. And Italy was temporary\nlocation, then they would take them to Egypt, where they would stay in the -- under the\ntents -- yeah, that was tent city. I remember the name was EI Shot. Anyway, and when\nour turn came to go to this place in Egypt, my father panicked, he says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to\nthe Sahara,\u201d you know, or whatever. So we were told, \u201cGet ready, everybody.\u201d It was --\nThere\u2019s a Yugoslav word for totality of escapees, like evacuation number one, evacuation\nnumber two. We were in one of these evacuation units, strictly civilian. So, when it came\ntime for our evacuation unit to go to El Shot in Egypt, my father woke me up one\nmorning, he says, \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d So we engaged somebody to take us to the\ntrain station, not in this town, the nearest town with a train. And we got on the train. I\nsaid we engaged somebody, somebody who had horse and wagon. He agreed to take us.\nAnd we went to this town -- Italian city, called Lecce, L-e-c-c-e-r -- L-e-c-c-e. Anyway,\nSO We were -- we were going to go to Barre, because Barre was the center of all these\nYugoslav escapees. But, the wa -- the train that we took to Lecce, we had to transfer there\nto another train going to Barre, but the Barre train had already left, so we had to find a\nway to spend the night there, spend the day and the night. And early in the morning, the\nfollowing day, to get up and go to the train station and board the train to Barre. Well, my\nfather could never get up early enough so we stayed that day and okay, well we\u2019ll go next\nday, we didn\u2019t wake up in time. Well, the next day we didn\u2019t wake up, and anyway, so\nwe ended up staying in Lecce. We rented a room in a house, first with somebody who\nwas renting beds for American GI\u2019s who would party too much and couldn\u2019t make it to a\nhotel or to their own rooms, so they would sleep there. Anyway, I remember, was a dollar\na night. No, not dollar, I\u2019m sorry, hundred lire, which was equivalent to a dollar. But\nanyway, So we stayed there for maybe a month, and then we found them -- place by the\nmonth, and we lived in Lecce. But my two aunts were still 1n the other area, where the\nYugoslav immigr -- immigrants were put by the British. And they were in the -- they\nwere placed in one of these villas, but because the British were trying to accommodate\npeople, if you had friends and you wanted all to be in the same villa, they let you do it. If\nyou didn\u2019t have enough friends to fill the villa, then they would fill the rest of it for you.\nWell here, there was 40 people who found each other. They were all Sephardic Jews from\nBosnia and they -- some knew each other from before, some became good friends in the -\n- all this, you know, living in the tran -- in transit, moving around and all that. They\nbecame good friends. So they we -- were put in this one villa together and life was good\nfor them, that place. My two aunts were among them. Two aunts and an uncle, one\nhusband of one of the aunts. Anyway -- I\u2019m sorry, and their daughter. They had three\ndaughters. Two were in the partisans and one was with them. So, they were there in -- in\nthis -- Santa Maria was where we were, but next door to it was another village -- a bunch\nof villas put together, called Santa Croce, which is where they were. And they enjoyed\nlife there, I know, because my aunts were all good cooks -- down, down, down -- my\naunts were all good cooks and they volunteered to be cooks over there and like they\nwould get -- down -- they would get food from the military, you know, they would get\nflour, and dried potatoes -- diced potatoes in cans. This was how the military would give\nto it\u2019s kitchens. And when we were living in -- with the peasants -- with the local -- I\nmean, local, from Dalmatian, you know, from the -- when I say peasant, this is not a\nderogatory term, it\u2019s a people who live off the land, who tilled the land or are shepherds,\nor are involved in agriculture. So, they -- when we were with them, they would cook the\nmeals, three meals a day, where the flour would be made into paste, and then they would\nput bacon, which they got from the military and some of these dried potatoes and this was\nall made into a mush, and there would be -- there would be our morning meal, our noon\nand our evening meal. Well, this Jewish house, they -- from the flour, they would make\npasta, different kind of pasta and I learned how to make pasta myself. You know, it\u2019s\nreally, as a kid, it was fun. And the bacon, because none of us ate it, was swapped with\nItalians to -- agricultural areas there, Italian, they loved the stuff, so they would give them\noil. There was a lot of olives there and oil was a product of the local area. They would\ngive them oil, they would give them green vegetables, onions, and you know, stuff like\nthat. So I remember when we would come and visit my aunt, like you would get -- I\nmean you eat pasta, you eat fresh vegetables. And they made friends with some\nAmerican flyers, you know, Air Force officers who were also -- many were from\nYugoslavia, because some of the -- from the Yugoslav Royal Air Force, had escaped to\nLondon and they were trained to fly US planes, you know. And there was a lot of them\nnearby, so that they had an opportunity to come and visit civilians and talk in their\nlanguage, yeah. And they would sometimes bring their buddies from the American flyers,\nyou know, who were not of Yugoslav extraction. And it was fun. And they would bring\ncorned beef cans, you know. And sometimes, like when I would go visit, I mean, you\nhave hamburgers, th-they would make, from the corned beef, they would make\nhamburgers and you have pasta and you have cauliflower or spinach. I said, \u201cHey, this 1s\nlike pre-war food.\u201d And they would -- Instead of this mush, you know? So you --\nAnyway, that\u2019s where my aunts lived and my uncle lived in Barre. There was a camp\nthere, I think I mentioned a lot about.",
        "Q: Oh yeah, you just [indecipherable] that.",
        "A: Yeah, okay, and that was the first stop where the Yugoslavs would be going, usually.\nThe ships would go to Barre, the British ships. So one time, my aunt and my cousin from\nthis Santa Croce -- oh, they would come visit us often, and we would go visit them, just\nyou know, maintaining family contact. But one time they came and they said, \u201cWell, we\nwant a tip.\u201d That\u2019s a tip, they use a Turkish word, means, when you have -- when you\u2019re\nbearer of good news, you\u2019re supposed to give something like a prize or a tip. \u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d They\u2019re saying, your mother -- my mother, my father\u2019s wife, they came to Barre with\nthe two girls. And that\u2019s how we found out. So my uncle, he told my wa -- my mother\nand my sisters that we were in Lecce, and he -- they went to -- to the authority, the British\nand told them about it, you know. And they contacted us, they put them on the train, to\nthe other place, where my aunts were, and they all came one day. I mean, within -- within\na week, but by that time, we had already signed up to come to the United -- into United\nStates. Stop it for a minute. Anyway, so my mother and my two sisters came and life\ncontinued with them. Yeah?",
        "Q: Describe that moment. What did your mother say about you? You must of -- had\ngrown.",
        "A: You know, that\u2019s the problem, that -- I like to describe it, but I just don\u2019t have it in my\nmemory unit. It\u2019s not there. I\u2019m trying to retrieve it, it\u2019s not. All I remember is the second\nday, I took my sisters on the town. And I remember -- well, I had some money and I took\nthem to an ice cream place. In Italy, like in Yugoslavia and throughout Europe, outdoor\ncafes were very popular. So there was this one outdoor cafe where we used to go hang\nout, and my father and me and all our friends would meet there. It was called Chinchin, I\nremember that, na -- yeah, anyway, I took them there and I ordered special ice cream. It\u2019s\ncalled, in Italian, it\u2019s called cassati. It\u2019s a frozen round thing and you cut pieces and then\nyou put whipped cream on top. Anyway, during the war, this was a big thing. And I\nremember, I ordered for them and me and I guess their stomach was not used to it, so\nboth of the gi -- my sisters got sick from that.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsak Mike Danon. This is tape number three, side A.",
        "A: They both got sick, I remember that part. And then the next big thing was getting on\nthe -- the manifest to go to United States with us. They came -- This was in June, near the\nend of June. Dates escape me right now, but I know we were preparing to go to United\nStates in July and I remember about sixth of July is when we left. So they didn\u2019t have too\nmuch time, they were with us in Lecce for about six, seven, eight days, no longer than\nthat. And again, this was war conditions and we all heard about bureaucracy, how it\nmoves very slowly. This is one time where bureaucracy moved fast and we were able to\nput them on the manifest to come over to United States with us. Of course, if they\ncouldn\u2019t, we would have just pulled out, but there was the law that was passed, was\nauthorizing 1,000 refugees. And I know must have been tens of thousands, maybe even\nlarger numbers that applied, so this was something special if you were approved. So, the\nfact that they recognized the family, this was to their credit. And I remember on July\n10th, we left -- we boarded military trucks and we left and -- toward Naples, where the\nship was going to take us to United States. And so, I didn\u2019t have too much time with my\nsisters, you know, being by ourselves, but once we got on that transport, we went to a --\noh, 1-1t was an abandoned, what do you call it, insane asylum, where they put us -- this\nwas our not only delousing station, but we received all kinds of shots and you know,\ntests, medical exams and all that, to see whether we are fit to go to United States. We\nspent three days, and I know I spend it with new friends that I had met. I was like -- I -- I\nstill was not 14 at the time. I mean, let\u2019s see, this was -- oh, I guess I was 14 already,\nthen. Yeah, and anyway, I spend it with other boys my age and I saw my sister, she made\na lot of friends -- my older sister. I don\u2019t remember my younger sister, because she was\nwith the children. But we were pretty extroverted at the time, and we made lots of friends\namong our own age group, so I know we didn\u2019t spend it as a family unit.",
        "Q: Can you pinpoint at a time when you -- you saw in your mother and your father, or\neven felt 1t yourself, where -- where you began to feel like, okay, I think we are safe,\nwe're back together, it looks like we\u2019re going someplace safe. Was there a point when\nyou started to relax, or perhaps it was watching your mother and father?",
        "A: No. At my age, I don\u2019t think I spent too much time dwelling on safely or anything\nelse, I just lived my life from day to day, having fun in wherever I could find it. When I\nlived in Lecce, I befriended, or I was befriended by a very large number of boys my age,\nand I met their families and we used to roam the streets and I even took up smoking. I\nwas able to get cigarettes when nobody else was, so that wa -- I was the big man on the\ncampus in that time. I quit smoking when my father caught me -- caught smoking. He\ndidn\u2019t do anything, he says, \u201cOh, you\u2019re smoking now, congratulations.\u201d That was it,\nyeah, that ended my smoking career. But anyway, no, I -- I don\u2019t think that I could tell\nyou when I started thinking of safety or security, you know. Because even under the\nworst conditions in the partisans, we were just doing what came naturally under the\ncircumstances without too much thinking.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about any memories you might have had of -- of how your\nmother and father kind of readjusted to each other, or were able to share their experiences\nwith each other?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t. Pl tell you why. My mother was non-communicative a -- when it comes to\npersonal stuff and I spend time with my father. My father, I have to say something bad\nabout him. He was the -- from the old school, where the father was the lord and master,\nthe husband, you know. He was all powerful and we had no rights whatsoever, except\nwhatever he, by his own grace, bestowed on us. Well, so we didn\u2019t have too many close\nrelations with him, except that we didn\u2019t get allowance, so -- but we -- when we would go\nfor a walk, he was the one who would say, \u201cYou guys want an ice cream?\u201d If he was so\nmoved, you know, or something like that. So we tended to hang with him, you know,\nhang by his -- on his arm, at the expense of our mother, who -- who was working all the\ntime, and couldn\u2019t spend time with us. So, I don\u2019t know if their relationship between each\nother, you know, and there was not too much affection displayed, either between them, or\nbetween us, among us kids, cause we didn\u2019t know how to express it. We learned it later. I\nthink I learned it from my younger sister, the affection, you know? But, no, I just cannot\nsay anything about that, because that was not out in the open.",
        "Q: If you could just talk a little bit about what the experience of spending all that extra\ntime with your father? You were, essentially, sometimes you were separated, but you\nwere really with him, day and day and day and day out. I\u2019m just curious if --",
        "A: Okay, well, let me tell you. When we were in the partisans, we -- 1f we marched, I was\nusually ahead in the marching line. He -- He had more problems, physical problems, than\nI did. Then, when we were assigned to different -- to the units, he was in charge of the\nsupplies. He was like a supply sergeant and I was in the machine shop. We spend an\nawful lot of time in the machine shop, from morning til night. We\u2019d come to meals,\nsometimes I would see my father then, sometimes I wouldn\u2019t. I would see him at night.\nSince there was no lights, we burned the kerosene. Home made lamp, that was the way of\nlight, because during the war, it was the situation where you didn\u2019t have -- even if there\nwas electricity, 1t was either bombed out, or they didn\u2019t have the oil to burn it so they can\ngenerate electricity or whatever. Coal, whatever was used. And it was small place, so\neverybody had these kerosene lamps and they were put out very early in the night. You\nonly burned them when you had to. So, it was sleeping time and get up early in the\nmorning and go to work. And we had our own individual functions. In Italy, after we\ncame to Lecce, my father -- this a funny -- not a funny s -- well, it\u2019s a funny story, but as\na result of this funny story, and I'll tell you about it if you care to hear it, my father got a\njob as acensor. This is the military censorship. They would, the Post Office -- every\nletter was opened, read, regardless of what the language was written in, and they either\ncut it out or blackened the parts that they didn\u2019t want to remain there. So my father had\nthe job and I was roaming the street with my new f -- new found friends and life was\nbeautiful and it did not center around my father. We -- I mean, we didn\u2019t have especially\nclose relations, we didn\u2019t have antagonistic relations, just how was your day, okay, I\nwould -- I even would sometimes attempt cooking, you know, so when he would come\nhome, we would have a meal. We lived with a family, an older lady and her adopted\ndaughter and I would help them -- help the older lady in the kitchen sometimes, because\nwe would sometimes provide the food for them. So, I guess they would let me make the\nhamburgers, because the meat would come out of cans -- corned beef cans that I had\nbought or traded or something. So, like I said, I wasn\u2019t too close th -- in contact with my\nfather. But how my father got this job, was one time we were on the street walking and\nthere was a guy whispering behind us, and -- whispering with somebody and they were\nfollowing a couple of American officers and they were -- one was listening to what\nthey\u2019re saying and he would interpret it to the other guy, and I nudged my father, and I\nsaid, \u201cLook, I think their spies. They\u2019re trying to hear whatever the American fly boys --\nAmerican Air Force officers tell them about where they are going to bomb, or what they\ndestroyed, or whatever, and then he tells the other guy.\u201d So, I -- I told my father. So we --\nmy father and I decided to follow this one guy. So anyway, we followed them -- these\ntwo guys, we followed them and then one guy went in a -- what do you call those? It\u2019s\nlike a coach, horse and buggy thing, but it\u2019s like the kind that they have in New York,\naround Columbus area.",
        "Q: Horse and carriage.",
        "A: A carriage type, real fancy ones. That was the means of transportation. So he went in\none end, we say -- we went to another one, \u201cFollow that carriage,\u201d you know. Like in the",
        "Q: The movies.",
        "A: -- the movies, yeah, gangster movies. And we did that and then when he came out, we\nstopped and he saw that we were following us, so he came over and he wanted to know\nwhat\u2019s going on, and we tried to deny it, and anyway, we saw where he went in, what\nhouse. So we -- I knew who the British officers were, I knew one of them from this\nChinchin restaurant. And I had seen them -- seen him in an office someplace, through the\nwindow I saw the guy. So I said, \u201cI bet you , if we go to them and tell them about it.\u201d So\nwe went and told them, and they said, \u201cUh-huh, uh-huh.\u201d They -- I thought they were like\nIntelligence Service, you know. Anyway, so, about six days later, they came to us and\nthey said, \u201cOkay, would you like to work for us?\u201d To my father. So --",
        "Q: You\u2019ve proved that you\u2019re industrious --",
        "A: -- that we\u2019re --",
        "Q: -- enterprising.",
        "A: -- enterprising yes, but we also proved that we are on the side of the allies, yeah. We\nare, yeah, creditable, you know, citizens, or whatever. Anyway, so that\u2019s how come my\nfather was working at this censorship office. Yeah?",
        "Q: Well, I think I -- I -- \u2019'm going to jump now.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s going to seem like a really big jump, but --",
        "A: Quantum jump, yeah.",
        "Q: Because you\u2019ve told the story of being on the ship --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and getting to the United States, I want to jump all the way to actually living at Fort\nOntario, if that\u2019s okay with you.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Can you describe a typical day there?",
        "A: A typical day, after the first two months that we were there, a typical day, yes. For one\nthing, we came to Oswego, Fort Ontario, August fourth, 1944. This was summertime, so\nsummer is a fun time, but in -- come September and kids have to go to school. So we\nwere signed up in the local school. We were interviewed and assigned to a grade. And\nfrankly, I think unfairly in some cases, because the selection was made on basis of our\nknowledge of English language, I didn\u2019t know any English, so I was put in seventh\ngrade, even though I was 14 years old. But, you know, people who spoke English, some\nof my friends, too, were sent to local high school. So I felt a little bit of a -- not\nresentment, but that I was set back unfairly. But, thinking back, all I had from the\nYugoslavia, was -- like I had completed four years of schooling, and a portion of the fifth\nyear, which in our case was gymnasium. So they put me in seventh grade, lower seventh,\nth -- you start with seven A, then you go to seven B, eight A to eight B, so -- so they put\nme in seventh grade. Anyway, a typical day would be, you get up, you eat breakfast in\nthe communal kitchens. We had -- thousand people were assigned to three kitchens, three\ncommunity kitchens. You eat breakfast, after breakfast, you start walking toward the\nmain gate. You usually -- during breakfast time, you meet some of your fellow walkers to\nthe school that we went to, was couple miles, I would say maybe three, four miles from\nthe camp. You go out the camp, you sign out. There\u2019s a guard -- we used to call them\npolicemen, because they had a police uniform. There\u2019s a guard, he watches you sign in\nand me and my friends would go to school. The school would start, I believe about eight\n15 or so, would be over by 11:30. We would go back to camp for lunch, back to the\ncommunity kitchens, have lunch, back to school for the afternoon session. Yeah, it was, I\nguess, like here, except here schools, you have lunch period and you have lunch rooms.\nWe didn\u2019t have lunch rooms, this was -- this was called junior high school, I guess, and\neven if we did, we just didn\u2019t carry lunches. We -- I don\u2019t think they would let us carry it,\nbecause that was reserved for those who traveled long distances, and we had, within\ncouple of miles, our own facilities. And there was an hour and a half or so for lunch,\nmaybe even longer. So, you know, it -- we were pressed for time. Anyway, we would\ncome home and we were in the military -- formerly military camp, which had all kinds of\nsports facilities. I mean, you know, running track, field, and we had organized our own\nclubs. We had taken old supply rooms and converted them to clubs, you know. Our --\nAnd we had Ping Pong, that was a biggy for us, playing Ping Pong the whole afternoon.\nThe schools didn\u2019t give us homework, which was unusual for us, we were used to\nEuropean style, where you get a lot of homework. Anyway, so, play Ping Pong, then go\nto supper. Usually, during the lunch hour and supper, there would be somebody\nannouncing what\u2019s taking place, in the evening, there\u2019s usually a movie. We would get\nsome real nice movies. I don\u2019t know whether the camp administration would buy them,\nor this was donated or whatever. We\u2019d get movies. They had people, the camp organized\ntheatrical groups. There was always something going on. If it\u2019s not movie, it\u2019s a play, if\nit\u2019s not a play, it\u2019s some kind of discussion, debates, our club, we had youth clubs, we\nhad our own personal clubs, that -- Yugoslav youth. There was newspaper, magazines.\nBut just hanging out, going to the canteen, which is -- there were -- the-they sold ice\ncream and stuff like that. You know, the kids like that. And, when came winter month,\nwell -- I forgot something. They had a unit of Quakers that came -- well, Quakers,\nFriend\u2019s service, whatever. It\u2019s a religious group.",
        "Q: Quakers.",
        "A: Yeah, but it\u2019s -- was sponsored by qu -- Quakers, but they were like social -- social\nservice and they would help us organize games and do things. Like one of them was in\ncharge of Girl Scouts. My sisters keeps talking about how -- all the activities they did as\nGirl Scouts. Another one would get the grown-ups to -- for sing-a-long and play games\nand you know, different things. And this one was sort of helping us -- I guess teenagers,\nyounger teenagers and she one time helped us build a skating rink. We did it -- We got a\nshuf -- shovels from the department of sanitation, I want to say, but you know, garbage\ncollectors. We got shovels, we got wood from the carpentry office so-someplace in the ca\n-- within the camp. And we just dug wherever we could, you know, made it flat and put\nthe boards along and we flooded it, and sure enough, it froze. Not very evenly, but it was\na Skating rink, and you know, anybody who could get skates and a bunch of brooms to\nguide yourself so you won\u2019t fall.",
        "Q: Brooms\u2019?",
        "A: Brooms, it\u2019s like skis, you know, handles, you know? That\u2019s what I was doing. Some\npeople knew how to skate well, but I had to use two brooms, yeah. Anyway, so activities\nwere just plentiful. Food was absolutely fantastic. Good, plenty. That was one of the\nthings that the grown-ups that were there, you know, many of them, especially my\nparents, they thought that life had settled for them. This is manna from the sky, we\u2019re\ngoing to live like this forever. No worries, everything is going to be provided. And when\nwe left camp, they had a, you know, a rude awakening, but during the life in camp, was\ngood for them. And I know my mother kept remembering how life was terrific and just a\nbig change from whatever they did, whatever was taking place before, when we came to\ncamp. Yeah?",
        "Q: What was the feeling among your parents, did -- at this point -- let me ask it like this,\nwhen you got to Fort Ontario, there was an agreement that this was temporary, that you\nwould go back to Europe. What did people say to each other? Were they beginning to say\nthey might like to stay, or di -- you know, especially as they saw what was playing out\nwith the war, what were people saying?",
        "A: Well, there was a lot of different opinions. A lot of people had relatives here in United\nStates, especially, many of them, in New York, and they wanted to rejoin their relatives.\nSome people had relatives left in other parts of the coun -- of Europe, and they didn\u2019t\nknow what was going on, so they wanted to go back. But needless to say, that when the\ngates sort of opened, and we had to leave camp -- well, the camp, Fort Ontario, not too\nmany wanted to go back. There was a first -- first time when they said, \u201cWho wants to go\nback? Now is the time to do it.\u201d Only 13 people went back. Second time was a few more.\nMy aunt -- One of my aunts and her husband and the daughter, they went back, because\nthey had two other children that -- they learned about their survival and just so happened\nthat both of their daughters were -- they had distinguished themselves, you know, in the\nwar, both with the partisans and later, the civil administration. So -- And this aunt and\nuncle of mine, their family, they were so close, you ask me about my parents, how close\nthey were and I couldn\u2019t tell you, but I can tell you about this aunt and uncle. They were\nalways -- I mean, they displayed their affections to each other and both the parents and\nthe children. They were really close, the family. So --",
        "Q: Tell us their names.",
        "A: Their name -- It was my mother\u2019s oldest sister. Her name was Bukeetsa, which means\nfirst born. And she married this man, his name was Joseph and their last name was\nMonteelio. You might -- You might be surprised, all these names, they sound Italian, my\nmother\u2019s name, Kabiljo, Monteelio. They did have Italian names. They came, evidently,\nthrough some of the Italian areas, but what I was going to say, there\u2019s a lot of Sephardic\nnames that sound Italian, that the Jews in these areas were -- Sephards are very few and\nfar between. They wonder, what was it -- What was your name before you changed it?\nWell, it was the same, you know, it just -- different names. Anyway, so there was, if you\nread this book, \u201cThe Haven,\u201d this lady, Ruth Gruber.",
        "Q: This is the book by Ruth Gruber, right, excuse me.",
        "A: Ruth Gruber, she describes about all the political gyrations that took place during the\ntime, which were not within my knowledge, because I didn\u2019t dwell on them.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsak Mike Danon. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "A: Well, we had my older sister, we found out where she was and all that. And we -- we\nwere thinking of bringing her over here instead of us going there. So we didn\u2019t even\nentertain a thought of going back, if we could remain here.",
        "Q: Can you -- At this point, does -- what does your father know of his parents?",
        "A: My father didn\u2019t know anything about his parents. He assumed that they were dead\nimmediately after they were taken and he was saying the memorial prayers for them,\nright away, I mean.",
        "Q: Who told him that they saw them taken?",
        "A: Well, 1-immigrants were coming o -- you know, s -- some who were able to escape\nand they\u2019d come -- everybody was coming to Split, if they could, from other parts. If you\nenvision Yugoslavia the way it was and here is one little, coastal sliver, that swa --\noccupied by Italians, and the word gets around that you can survive there, everybody tries\nto go there, no matter what -- what -- no matter what the cost. So, lots of people came to\nItalian held areas and they talk about \u201cYeah, I saw your parents being taken,\u201d you know,\nand all that. And -- Or people say, \u201cAnybody left?\u201d \u201cNo, nobody left,\u201d of the Jewish\ncommunities, here, there, you know, so that was pretty well known.",
        "Q: Y-You say your father was saying the memorial prayer, did -- did he ever make it a\nformality and ask you to join him and say this as a kind of a service for his parents?",
        "A: No, no, he -- he thought -- I guess this is what he had, a premonition that they died,\ncertain day and that\u2019s how he a-assumed and he -- th-that day, he decided they died, yeah.\nThis was, I guess he needed it, you know, to what we -- what do we call here, closure, or\nsomething, yeah, in today-speak, you know.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about, you mentioned in your first interview, the feeling of the\ncamp, of that it was enclosed. I don\u2019t know if there was a fence or barbed wire, and just\nsome of the feelings that that sparked among people, par-par-particularly you?",
        "A: Well, you know, this was the big thing, when newspeople came to interview us, all\nover -- I mean, New York Times said there was a lady a-and she asked, \u201cWhat do you\nlike about the camp? And is there anything ya -- what did -- don\u2019t you like?\u201d And then\nshe quoted us yelling the word for barbed wire, is zhitsa, and says -- she quotes, \u201cZhitsa,\nthey all yelled in unison,\u201d you know. No, this is a rebellious spirit in a teenager. You\nknow, somebody\u2019s trying to chain me, and that was it, but aside from not being able to go\ninto town, except later, they allowed us so many visits or -- within such a radius of 20\nmiles and special dispensation to go to Syracuse, which was maybe 30 miles, you know.\nNo, there was nothing. Even the quote zhitsa, didn\u2019t bother us that much. Life was pretty\nsmooth. No matter -- If I think, in retrospect, wherever I was, wh-wherever I might have\nbeen, I watch today\u2019s youth, you know, I had everything there, we all did. No, absolutely,\nthere was no complaints, except the psychological first impression to a rebellious\nteenager, you know, that when you see a fence around you. So that was not a problem.",
        "Q: You mentioned again -- In your first interview, you mentioned the Japanese\ninternment and I ha -- a -- maybe suggested a parallel there. I-I-Is that something you\nhave any thoughts on, or did back then, I don\u2019t know if you were sa -- aware, you know,\naware of the fact that the same administrators that administered the Japanese internment\ncamps, were administering your camps. I -- I don\u2019t know if --",
        "A: No, we were not aware of the internment of the Japanese Americans until much later,\nyeah, when we learned, you know, in our history, after we were released from the camp.\nBut the only reason I mention it, is because I wanted to convey to whoever I was talking\nto, that this was the administration that was in charge of us, the very same one that was in\ncharge of the Japanese, and I -- my guess was going to be that they -- the Japanese were -\n- Japanese Americans were treated just as well as we were. I couldn\u2019t see any reason why\nthey wouldn\u2019t ha-have been. But, basically, 1t was the same administration, was called\nWar Relocation Authority. And then for us, they had a separate segment, it was called\nemergency refugee center, Oswego, New York. But it was the same administration. You\nknow, they had the same machinery in motion. So, that\u2019s the only reason I mentioned it,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Can you talk -- You alluded to it a little bit ago, can you talk about the transition from\nleaving Fort Ontario, to having to really strike out and set up life in the United States, and\n-- and tell us some of the things that happened right before you left, and -- and sort of\ntake us through that.",
        "A: Well, what happened to us was, I mean, we had to leave and we all left. We were sent\nto New York. But before that, there was a group that had sponsored us. The United States\ngovernment was not allowing, in those days, of free entry to the people who sought\nimmigration to the United States. They wanted somebody to put a bond, monitor a bond,\nto guarantee that we would not become a public charge. So this organization, the Jewish\norganization called Jewish American Joint Distribution Committee, put the funding -- in\nother words, they guarantee that -- they guarantee that we would not become a public\ncharge. So, what they were trying to do is, people who are leaving the camp, they were\ntrying to disperse them, so they wouldn\u2019t all go to New York, because they had the\nmechanism to take care of people, but not if they all go to the same place, because that\u2019s\na big burden on one location. So, they interviewed everybody and they convinced my\nparents to go to Philadelphia. They told them what a great place it is, and in Philadelphia,\nthere is a Sephardic synagogue, which is on the historic sites today, but it was the second\nsynagogue in the United States. Now, the first one was on the Cape -- I\u2019m sorry, first one\nwas in Newport, Connectic -- Newport, Rhode Island, yeah. It\u2019s called su -- Truro\nsynagogue, same as a town on the Cape, so strike that out, yeah. But anyway, in -- in\nPhiladelphia, there is a synagogue where George Washington had visited there, yeah, so\nthey talked to us about history, you know, and that, \u201cYou will be welcome there,\u201d and all\nthat. Okay, so my father wen -- okay. Some of our friends went to Baltimore, be -- this\none guy told us later, he agreed to go to Baltimore, because Baltimore, that part, more, m-\nO-r-e, means sea in Serbo-Croatian, so he thought he would going to be near the sea.\nWell, close enough, but not exactly. Anyway, so different people went to different places,\nbut I would say not too many went to Omaha, Nebraska, or you know, Caspar, Wyoming\nor something. Still, 1t was either LA, Chicago or New York, Philadelphia area. So, when\nwe left the camp, we had to go someplace, because we were under the quota and\nYugoslav quota was not very large, like maybe six a year or something. But, I think my\nparents, because they were born in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which at the time they were born,\nwas under the Austro-Hungary empire, I think they put them under Austrian quota, which\nwas much larger. So -- Still, they decided to close the camp in January and everybody\nhad to be out. Well --",
        "Q: January of what year?",
        "A: January 1945. I\u2019m sorry, \u201846. Oh, how time flies. 1946. We came in *44, and we were\nthere a year and a half. August \u201844, to -- okay. So, in January, they were closing the camp\nand everybody had to leave, so we were taken or shipped to New York, and we stayed at\nthe place which was run by an organization called HIAS. It\u2019s an acronym for Hebrew\nImmigrant Aid Society. Anyway, so we stayed there for three, four days in January, we\nwere on the February quota. February, we had to leave the country, and we went to\nCanada. We went to Niagra, Niagra Falls, Canada, and then we crossed the bridge to\nUnited States. But it was all pre-arranged with the immigration officials. They had all our\npapers squared away. They let us leave the country and then as we came, yeah, yeah --\nand from there we boarded the trains and came to Philadelphia, where we were met by a\nrepresentative from a Jewish social agency. And they took us to a country club, which\nwas, because it was winter, wasn\u2019t too well frequented. Anyway, so we spend there,\nabout five, six weeks, until this one guy, he was our quote, caseworker. He would take us\nfrom the country club, to -- he stayed with us in the country club. He would take us to the\ncity and try to find us an apartment and jobs, and all that. Well, eventually, he found us\njobs -- I mean, he found us an apartment and we moved to Philadelphia, from this\ncountry club, was called Filmount Country Club. I di -- I remember the country club, it\nwas very luxurious. I don\u2019t know if you know about Gimbel\u2019s, used to be a department\nstore, the owner had organized this club, and it was -- they used to try to impress us, what\nit takes to be a member of that club, you know. Anyway, but we enjoyed the facilities and\nthen we moved to Philadelphia, in a very slummy apartment, because that\u2019s all that was\nfigured out we could afford. And it was in the area what is today known as Society Hill,\nbut in those days wasn\u2019t Society Hill. It\u2019s within a block or two from Independence Hall,\nand all these historic sites. Anyway, life in Philadelphia for me, was very difficult. I\nmean, I didn\u2019t -- again, I didn\u2019t dwell on it, but I found a job, within maybe 10 days, I\nfound a job in the factory -- hat factory. It was very hard work. The pay was minimal\nwage, which it --",
        "Q: Do you -- Do you remember what it was?",
        "A: Yeah, 50 cents an hour. And I remember, after the first month, I had to go -- no, I\ndidn\u2019t have to, but I went, asked for a raise, and it was a nickel, so I was making 55. And\nthen they passed a law that made it, the minimal 55 and I felt cheated. So next month I\ngot another nickel raise and so forth. But that was some really hard work. I worked there\nharder than I ever did anywhere. If you can imagine, hats are made from felt, heavy felt\nand steam. So you shape it with steam and in the summer, lots of steam is just not\nconducive to a well-being of a person, like myself, anyway. Anyway, so I worked there,\nand --",
        "Q: B-Before you go on, why -- why didn\u2019t you go to school?",
        "A: Well, was --",
        "Q: Wha -- Who made that decision.",
        "A: The de-decision was made by my father. We didn\u2019t have any money, that was the\ndecision. He didn\u2019t want to work, so I was the only one over 16, so the idea was that I\nwas going to earn something, whatever it was. And, as the customs of the times were, all\nchildren turned over their paycheck -- that\u2019s mailman -- turned over their paycheck to\ntheir father, and I was doing that. And if I could work extra, or overtime, and all that, that\nwas -- I was proud to bring a bigger check. Little by little my checks became, like 18\ndollars clear. Fi-First it was like 14 something and with the taxes deducted, you know.\nThen it got to be 16 - 18 and then finally I started making like a dollar an hour, God, I\nthought I was really the highest paying employee anywhere, and with overtime, I was\nhappy. And --",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t your father want to work? At this point, he must have been about 45 or 50.",
        "A: Yeah. He didn\u2019t want to work. He was never much for working, even when we were\nkids, when we had the store. He said it was his store and my -- he would say my mother\nwas like an employee. But he never went to work there, very rarely would he go. And if\nhe would go, he would like, make it by 11 o\u2019clock. And people would wait for him. You\nknow, customers would line up, sometimes wait for him. People from the villages, who\nsold their foods and wares and like the milk lady, she would come early, deliver milk,\nand then with the money that she would collect, she has to buy a -- supplies or whatever,\nincluding material for clothes. So they would wait for him, they never knew when he was\ngoing to show up, 10:30 - 11. But anyway, he was not a working person. So, eventually, I\ngot my employer to offer him a job, and he did try, for awhile, but 1t was too hard for\nhim, you know. So he didn\u2019t -- he just never worked. Yeah, he would -- My two sisters\nwere young, you know, they were under 16, so they went to school. And then my mother\nfound a job with some local family that was making aprons, yeah. And she was just\nfolding them and packaging them. Not much of a job, but that helped. But they didn\u2019t\nneed her, they didn\u2019t need a full time employee. So, eventually, my mother found a place\nin a -- a factory -- clothing, men\u2019s clothing factory in Philadelphia. That was big industry\nthere. But I was the one that provided the main sustenance, you know, for the family.\nAnd, after the first, maybe four months -- like we came in February, in Philadelphia, I got\nthis job after we left this country club, in April and next September, I signed up for\nevening school, yeah. And from then on, I went to evening school. First high school,\nthen, you know, college. Seems like 15 years of evening -- evening school. But anyway -\n- yeah?",
        "Q: Why did you do that?",
        "A: Because, I had completed -- in Oswego, where we were signed up, I started seventh\ngrade, and as soon as I learned the language, got on the dean\u2019s list, you know. Let\u2019s face\nit, I was 14, and the kids in that class were 12. Yeah, so it -- I don\u2019t want to attribute to\nmyself any superior intelligence, but I was older, so my brain should function a little\nbetter than a younger kid. So, anyway, so I would be promoted every couple of months,\nto the next grade. So, in the -- what, in a year and a half, I had completed three years of\njunior high school, seventh, eighth and ninth grade. And, incidentally, all the kids in Fort\nOntario were not only on dean\u2019s list, but they were like top honors, always. They used to\ncall it high honors and we had to march to the stage, where the principal would shake our\nhand and hand us the report card, whereas others would get it in their classrooms, you\nknow. Anyway, this was during the assembly. But, so I started going to school, and I\nwould also take tests. What -- These were like Regency tests. It was uniform test, GD, I\nguess they call it, about each individual subject. What -- We had an advantage, I spoke\nmany languages by that time, and other languages have much more complex grammars.\nAnd American kids have problems knowing when to say me, or I, or him, or he, or -- you\nknow, things like that. And I would take these tests, English tests, and I mean, y-you just\nlisten to your ear and think about another language, you know. So, you have maybe two\ncases or three cases nominative, or objective and maybe possessive, which is -- we had\nseven of them, you know, and all of these different tenses in verbs and all that. So it was\nvery easy, I mean, except for spelling and pronunciation, English came pretty easy to us.\nBut anyway, the point 1s, I was able to take all these tests and move up my high school\neducation. I graduated from high school, and then went to college.",
        "Q: How old were you at that point, when you graduated from high school?",
        "A: Well, I gr-graduated --",
        "Q: Can you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah, I graduated in about a year and a half and so I was like 18 or so. 18 -- 18 anda\nhalf. I know, less than 19. And then I started college. But this was, in those days, they\ndidn\u2019t have like all, every evening, for four hours in the afternoon. Don\u2019t forget, I was\nworking full time, overtime occasionally. So, I would just go two hours at night, to\nschool. And it took awhile, until, well, at one point, much -- not much later, but in 1950,\nthere was a war in Korea and I was just the right age for that. So they tried to draft me,\nbut I got a couple of deferments, because I was the sole support of the family. But that\ndidn\u2019t last forever. So, eventually, I got drafted and well, I got drafted in the month that\nthey declare end of the war, in January \u201855. So, after serving my [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I want to go back, yeah. Anyway, I was drafted in January, 1955, and after serving my\nbasic training, I was sent to Europe, yeah, to Germany, yeah. Well, that didn\u2019t go over\ntoo well with me, because of my background. I didn\u2019t think 1t was too safe to keep me in\nGermany. Safe for maybe somebody else, because I might be armed and might decide\nthat the -- you know, to provide justice for myself or whatever. But anyway, the point\nwas, I was, when I was inducted into the army, they give you a battery of tests. And one\nof the things that they decided that I would be pretty good for, filling an interpreters\nposition. And interpreters are mostly needed in front lines. So they trained me to be an\ninfantryman, and they send me to Germany. I spoke some German, but not enough to be\nan interpreter. Then I told them that I wasn\u2019t happy, so within eight days or so, they send\nme to France.",
        "Q: Did you explain to them why? I mean this, your personal history in context?",
        "A: Yeah, but I explained that to the chaplain, not to anybody in the chain of command,\nbecause I don\u2019t think the army would accommodate anything like that. So I guess he\ntalked to whoever was in the personnel office, when they were filling quotas for France.\nIn those days, we maintained what was known as communication zone in s -- in France,\nso I was sent to a place near Bordeaux, a camp which had a hospital. Well, it was like a\nregional hospital, regional POL. That stands for petroleum, oil and lubricants, and the\nother [indecipherable] area. They were all from Bordeaux, all the way to the German\nlines, where we maintained our native strength. So anyway, so I was sent there to\ninterpret French, which I didn\u2019t know a single word of. And the commanding officer\ninsisted that I was filling the slot, and he wanted me to interpret, so six weeks later, when\nhe called me, I interpreted. Anyway, so that\u2019s -- I spend a year and a half in France.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. This 1s an\ninterview with Isak Mike Danon, conducted by Katie Davis, on February 26, 1999, in\nconducted with isen -- Isak Mike Danon, November six, 1989. The United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr, for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape number four, side A. A clarification, at this point, are\n-- are you a citizen of the United States?",
        "A: I obtained my citizenship as soon as I was enti -- eligible for it, within five years of\nresidence, which was something one strived for. I know I did. I know my parents did and\neverybody that I knew that was in similar situation like I was, strived for, with pride.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, that was my other question. At that point, what were your feelings about\nthis country?",
        "A: I\u2019m -- Well, how does one say I would be top patriot, you know. I would offer myself\nand whatever, you know, like they said in the signing the Declaration of Independence,\nour bodies and fortunes and whatever else. I mean, I had great feelings about this\ncountry, and I still do, of course. I may have political differences with some of the\nforeign policy, or maybe even internal policies, but you know, the country which\nprovided a home for me is utmost in my esteem, for -- unquestionably.",
        "Q: So when -- So when you were called to serve, and it was clear that -- that you needed\nto do so and that your family would be taken care of, I guess -- I guess what I want to ask\nis, what was your attitude when you went to serve in the army, representing the United\nStates?",
        "A: Okay, well first, a slight correction would be that my family would not be cared for.\nThey have, you know, allotment, but they\u2019re not sufficient to maintain oneself, especially\nthis point. Well, my sisters were already getting older, you know. I mean, they -- they\ncould go to work. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s both sisters. Let\u2019s see, in 1950, no, my one sister\nwould be -- \u201831, she was 19. No, 18, at that time, so she was working already, the -- the\none next to me, but the youngest one was still in school. So, this is the sister that I\nmentioned to you that, pretty strong willed, and she, as soon as she started working, she\nsays, \u201cWell, my money, the one -- the money that I earn, is mine.\u201d And she had problems\nwith my father. He insisted that 1t was his. So they came up to some compromise, but\nstill, not enough to maintain the family. You know, she was making like 25 dollars or so\na week and she settled for contributing 15 maybe, you know. It -- Not maybe, but that\u2019s\nthe number that I remember.",
        "Q: This is Esther?",
        "A: No, this is Sarah.",
        "Q: Sarah.",
        "A: Yeah. The -- The one that when she was nine was guiding my mother, pulling her by\nthe hand. Anyway, so that was the other source of income, and my mother, she would\nwork, or wouldn\u2019t work, depending on the situation where she was working. They had\nlayoffs, and she wasn\u2019t very quick. She couldn\u2019t -- She couldn\u2019t manage on the\npiecework, so they had to pay her the minimum wage, and they were not happy to pay\nminimum wage to somebody who could not earn it under the piecework system. So my\nmother would be the first one to get laid off and the last to be re-hired. So, anyway, that\u2019s\nwhy I say my family would not be taken care of. But, when my younger sister started\nworking and the allotment, you know, and all that, then I -- I di -- I agreed that, okay, my\nfamily could survive without my full support.",
        "Q: The allotment was what?",
        "A: The allotment in those days was based on my salary, which was 78 dollars, so from\nthat, I needed to contribute something, and the government would contribute something\nalso. And I remember later, when I got a promotion, and -- well, whatever it was,\nincrease in pay, that the government\u2019s contribution would be 105 dollars a month. But we\nended up, my father was afraid to sign anything, and so h-he never signed the application\nfor allotment. He -- After we left camp, he was totally -- not devastated, but destroyed. I\nmean, his psyche was destroyed. He -- He thought that -- that people were looking at him,\nthe secret police was watching him, you know, and all that. It was -- mentally, he had\nproblems. And he wouldn\u2019t leave the house, he would stay in the house, all the time peek\nfrom the windows, you know. So he was not capable of doing anything. And he was afr -\n- like I said, afraid to sign any documents, for fear that might -- it might be some form of\na commitment or something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So, in a sense, you really were in charge of the family, after this -- at this point your\nfather became somewhat disabled by --",
        "A: Yeah, but --",
        "Q: -- it sounds like some sort of mental illness.",
        "A: Yeah, but he still maintained the control. This was -- Yeah, you don\u2019t dethrone a king\njust because he 1s not functioning in the most efficient manner. So this was one of the\nfriction points in our lives, and it took long time to resolve it. In fact, it wasn\u2019t -- it was\nnever resolved, except when I came back from the military, 1t was a financial settlement\nkind of thing, that we decided how much we\u2019re going to provide for him and whatever he\ndoes with it, 1t\u2019s okay with us.",
        "Q: Us being who?",
        "A: Us being me and my two sisters. Actually, one sister was married. She got married in\n1951, so -- yeah, \u201850 -- \u201c51, June \u201851. So -- I mean July \u201851. So that eli-eliminated her,\nbut it was my younger sister and me.",
        "Q: Now that you mention getting married, at this point, you\u2019re working, you\u2019re going to\nschool, then you have a stint in the military. Are you able to find time to date and court\nand you know, start thinking about a family yourself, or how does that come about?",
        "A: Okay, first I -- My life was totally taken up by my work and my school. And my\nsocial life consisted of Sunday afternoon, I would go to -- in Philadelphia, to the Y, work\nout, swim, meet some people there and spend the afternoon or evening. I did not have\nenough money to go on dates or anything at that point, for a long while. Then I started\ndating. I guess I met this girl at school in the evening, at college. And we dated for awhile\nand I was still mentally a child, while she was more mature and she wanted a future and I\nguess I wasn\u2019t ready for that. Then --",
        "Q: Was she an -- an immigrant?",
        "A: No, no. I didn\u2019t -- I maintained contact with one family, who were immigrants. In fact,\nthere were three brothers in this family and they lived in Philadelphia, not too far from\nme. And the oldest boy was a year older than me and the second one in line was year\nyounger. And they were part of my clique in forta -- Fort Ontario. When I say my clique,\nwe were in the same clique and then when we moved here, we continued our friendship. I\nsay here meaning Philadelphia. We maintained our friendship, then the second they --\none of the -- middle brother of the three, he was accepted -- he was a pretty good student,\nhe was accepted in what they call Central High, which is academically advanced --\nadvanced school. In fact, you get a BA when you graduate from that high school.\nAnyway, and that was his future, he found friends, he developed different friendship. But\nthe older brother, this fellow by name of Raymond Barney, he was a friend of mine from\nthen on, I mean, from the camp and in Philadelphia, for a very long time. In fact, when I\nwas in the military service, I was stationed in France, and they\u2019re French, yeah, and he\ncame to visit me and we sort of got our signals mixed up. We were supposed to meet in\nNice and I went there for a week, and he wasn\u2019t there. And then I came back and he was\nwaiting for me near Bordeaux, in my installation, but I had already shot my vacation.\nAnd anyway, so we were good friends. And then, while I was in the service, he met a girl\nand he married her, and she was from New York, so he moved to New York. But, when I\ncame back from the service, I was -- I started dating some other girl, and I dated her for\nlike three, four years, but 1t was just Saturday night kind of thing, you know. We had a\nstanding Saturday night date. But then, let\u2019s see, what happened, we broke up, I know.\nShe went to -- to one of these resorts in the Catskill, she met somebody that was more\nserious than me, so that ended that. And then, in one of my summer evening classes,\nthere was a bunch of girls -- this was Spanish class. I was trying to get some college\ncredits in a hurry, so I would attend -- let\u2019s say I would attend advance college course,\nbut they wouldn\u2019t give me credit unless I had some of the other preliminaries. So I would\ntake an exam in the preliminary, pass that and have the advance course, which I had to sit\nfor. And this was advanced Spanish. So sh-she saw I had a ring. It was a monogram ring\nthat had turned itself around and she thought I was married, so she thought I was safe,\nnobody would say that, you know, that she was hitting on me, to use the current\ncolloquial. And so she would come and sit like next to me and I won\u2019t say copy, but we\nwould work the homework together. And it was a very happy group, like about eight girls\nand two guys and we would go after class, we go out, celebrate, or whatever. And that\ngirl, when I decided to leave town, get a job someplace else, I left her, you know. And\nthen one year I went to the mountains, the Catskills and lo and behold, we met again.\nAnd that was my wife for 30 years, and she passed away a year ago.",
        "Q: And her name?",
        "A: Sandra.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: Where was Sandra from?",
        "A: S-Sandra, she was from Philadelphia. She was born and raised in Philadelphia and her\nfather was also born in the United States. Her mother came to United States from either\nPoland or Russia, when she was like about two years old. And let\u2019s see, she -- Sandra\nwas also a night school college student. She -- She graduated with a degree in physics\nand math and she worked at General Electric. They had the research in the ballistic, you\nknow, the -- what do you call it, the missile re-entry was GE\u2019s job. In the olden days, the\nmissile would be shot up and out of the atmosphere and when it would come back, it\nwould burn, because the re-entry was physically too hot, I guess. It would burn out, so\nGE was working on different projects and she was in math and physics and computers --\nwith first generation computers, yeah. And well, we got to know each other and we got\nmarried in 1970. I\u2019m sorry -- \u201869.",
        "Q: Was she Jewish?",
        "A: The what?",
        "Q: Is she -- Was she Jewish?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: She was Jewish. Anyway, let\u2019s see, I's -- I sort of didn\u2019t tell you anything about my\nlife, but anyway, I -- at one point, I-I started work -- when I came back from the military,\nI started working for the federal government, and in the college, I had taken up\naccounting, that was my major. And I had obtained like a certificate, which means 60\nsemester hours. Mostly concentrated 1n whatever my chosen field 1s, which was\naccounting, auditing, cost accounting and similar. And then economics, finance, things\nlike that. And then, when I went into the military, I got a few credits to languages. They\nhave a military college, it\u2019s a male kind of thing. You take a test -- You sign up and you\ntake a test at the end, yeah. Whenever you\u2019re ready, you mail your lessons to them, they\nmark them, whatever. Yeah, so I got a bunch of semester hours from -- during the\nmilitary stunt -- stint. And then I -- And when I came back, I had enough that I could see\nmy way, you know, light at the end of the tunnel, so I continued, and that\u2019s how I met\nher, you know. She was doing the same thing. She was working and going to college in\nthe evening.",
        "Q: Were you still living at home and taking care of your mother and father?",
        "A: Yeah. At that point, I was. And then my younger sister got married and it was just --",
        "Q: Esther?",
        "A: Yeah, Esther. And at that point I decided that somebody like myself, I guess -- how\nold was I? It\u2019s -- I could have [indecipherable] to what I was, but anyway, it was time to\nleave the nest, sort of, even though I was supporting it, the only sa -- means of support for\nit. But I decided to leave and I got a job with the -- well, I was working at the arsenal in\nPhiladelphia, place called Frankford Arsenal, doing what I\u2019m trained to do, namely\naccounting work. And then I applied for an auditors job, and this was out of Columbus,\nOhio. So in 1961, I guess I was 32 then, I left home and I went to Columbus, Ohio and I\nworked for outfit called Army Audit Agency, and we did auditing of the military\nestablishment.",
        "Q: Was that a difficult transition for your parents, to have you leave? I mean, after all\nthey -- they did depend on you very much, whether they -- your father acknowledged it\nor not.",
        "A: Okay, well you know it\u2019s funny, because when I was -- when I was living there\nbefore, we were really living like church mice. I mean, life was not pleasant, we were not\neating well, we were not having too much, you know, in the way of resources. And, I\ndon\u2019t know if I can describe the life, it was so basic, you know, and the -- occasionally\nmy mother would come and ask us for more money, because there\u2019s no money. What my\nfather was doing 1s really hoarding the money, yeah. So he had accumulated some money\nthat we didn\u2019t know about it. And he, after I left, they used that to live on. And it\u2019s funny,\nbecause my younger sister, she would pay bills for them and she knew how much they\nhad. And it was just -- My father passed away at a young age, 63, I believe, 64,\ndepending on how one computes, because they all had two different day -- birth dates,\nyou know, different years, because like his father didn\u2019t want him to go to the military,\ncompulsory draft, at a very young age, so he didn\u2019t register him when he was born, he\nregistered a year or two later. Anyway, so when my father passed away, there was like 10\ndollars in his account, you know, but they were using that up, whatever his savings were.\nSo I guess they managed, if they didn\u2019t have any money, I\u2019m sure I and some of my\nsisters, maybe, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m sure we could have given them enough. But\nanyway, that was -- it was a sad part of the whole story.",
        "Q: When your father did pass away, what happened to your mother?",
        "A: Well, my mother, she became alive then. She came to live with my younger sister. My\nyounger sister had two little children. I don\u2019t know whether she had two or one at the\ntime. And my older -- my other sister, had a daughter, a young daughter that she would\nbring to the other sister\u2019s house. So my mother would take care of these little kids and\nshe was in seventh heaven. She really enjoyed that. And my sister, to her credit, would\ntake good care of my mother, take her out all the time, you know, when -- when her\nhusband would be home to stay with the children, she would take her out to restaurants.\nThis is something that I guess I feel guilty, because we never took our mother out before,\nbecause our father would not want us to. And -- But anyway, my mother, all that stored\nup social, what shall I say? Expertise, and -- came out. She blossomed, you know. And\nmy other sister, she -- she liked my mother, she took care of her, I mean, calling her\nglamour girl, you know, and all that. Her life improved 1,000 percent after that. So, she\nlived with my younger sister for a very long time, until my youngest sister could -- sh-she\ngot Alzheimer\u2019s or maybe not Alzheimer, some form of dementia and then my sister had\nto put her in a home, yeah. But anyway --",
        "Q: Tell us a little about you and Sandra and your children.",
        "A: Well, Sandra and I, or Sandy, as we called her, we had a wonderful life. I may get\nchoked up on this. We have two little -- two little -- two daughters, we\u2019re proud of both\nof them, and I\u2019m not just saying things. My children were everything to me and my wife.\nMy wife stayed at home all our married life. Well, since the first daughter was born, a\nfew months before that. I wanted her to make a home for our children. I had a job, which\nI enjoyed tremendously, but it involved travel. Different time, different extent travel, but\nalways travel. There was a point where I traveled once a week for a couple of days.\nWhen my wife and I got married, I was just promoted to a manager\u2019s position in our\noffice. And I had the luxury of not having to travel extensively at one time, but I would\nhave different teams go out and do audits and I would just visit them for a day or two at\nthe site. And still, that meant being away from home, so somebody had to take care of the\nchildren. I was used to living not very luxuriously. My salary --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsak Mike Danon. This is tape number four, side B.",
        "A: Okay, yeah, what was I saying?",
        "Q: You were talking about your job and how it made you travel.",
        "A: Yeah. Anyway, so I would go fa -- visit different audit sites and I was maybe even go\nat the beginning and get them started and they would be there for three, four weeks,\nmaybe I would go once more, maybe I would go for final close-out with the installation\nthat we were auditing. But somebody had to take care of the children and help them\ngrow. What I started saying is that because of my modest background, I was able to\ncomfortably live on my salary, or my family was able to, you know. I provided them\nwhatever comforts they needed. In my opinion maybe not so luxurious, but anyway, we\ntook our vacations maybe a little bit out of the seasons. We -- You know, we took\nvacations four or five times a year, but maybe smaller ones, you know, when the\n[indecipherable] week-ends. And maybe before the kids started going to school, we go to\nthe beach in June and September, which was perfect for me, because it wasn\u2019t too\ncrowded. Anyway, we -- we didn\u2019t go to restaurants that cost, you know, hundreds of\ndollars. We found some interesting pla -- restaurants that catered to family trade and as\nfar as I know, my wife was satisfied and the kids were satisfied. And anyway, so the\nchildren were going to school, and the older one especially, she did good work. I don\u2019t\nknow why, but she always feared that she may not meet the standards that she sets for\nherself. Maybe she thought we expected a lot from her, maybe she thought I expected a\nlot from her. But she -- she participated in sports, swimming. They were not very big, I\u2019m\na small guy and their mother wasn\u2019t too big. She was about my height, maybe an inch\nshorter, and the kids are five foot one, five foot, you know. So they\u2019re not very tall and\nnot very big. And anyway, the older one participated in sports, first swimming and then\ndiving and that was a very active part of her life. In school, both of them were in the\ntheater and they were -- they excelled, actually, in these things, both of them. And\nanyway, so the older one turned out to be quite a scholar. I feel a 1 -- a lot guilty -- I was\ngoing to say a little guilty -- a lot guilty that I didn\u2019t keep up fully with their\ndevelopment in scholastics. But, to tell you about the older one, and since I\u2019m oriented\ntoward scholastics, I\u2019m proud of her achievements. She graduated from high school with\na four point average. She went to William and Mary and she graduated Summa Cum\nLaude, which is three out of the class were that. And then, to my surprise, she decided\nthat she wants to become a rabbi. And she went to this school, University of Judaism.\nAnd of course, now the expenses started getting a little bit higher, because the second one\nwas getting ready to go to college, and -- but anyway, we managed to send her and she\u2019s\nnow arabbi. She\u2019s -- She\u2019s teaching, because in -- and she married, what 1s -- we classify\nas Orthodox. We are not Orthodox, we are middle of the road, or Conservative, who --\nConservatives accept women rabbis, but Orthodox do not, yet. Saying yet, that\u2019s a\npolitical statement. Anyway, so she\u2019s now teaching. She\u2019s 29 years old.",
        "Q: What\u2019s her name? Her name?",
        "A: Oh, her name is Elisa Danon Kaplan. She married a young boy, his name 1s Three\nJonathan Kaplan. He\u2019s a Canadian young man from Montreal. About a year and a half\nago, a little less than that, we all flew to Montreal -- no, we didn\u2019t fly, I flew in my car,\nyeah, I picked up my daughter, and my -- older daughter and took her to Montreal, me\nand my wife and her.",
        "Q: Your wife did go?",
        "A: Yeah. That was -- After the wedding, she started getting worse, went downhill from\nthere. But anyway, she was married 21st of September, 1997, my daughter, in Montreal.\nThe entire family, on his side, was in New York, except his mother and father. And we\nwere here, but the mother, she is the kind of person, the take charge person, and they\nasked me if I would have objection if they have a wedding in Montreal, and knowing that\nmy wife, Sandy was not in the best of shape, we agreed, and it was a very nice wedding.\nIt\u2019s -- We have a lot of nice memories from that. And the younger daughter, she -- after\nshe graduated --",
        "Q: Her name?",
        "A: Her name is Shoshanna. First one, if I mentioned, Elisa, yeah. Shoshanna is still\nsingle. She graduated from the same high school, in this vicinity. And then she went to\nOld Dominion University. It took her a little bit longer, because she was sick for one\nyear, she had mononucleosis. That sort of slowed her down and then she -- I don\u2019t know,\nit took her a little longer, anyway. She was not the studious type. She just -- Two weeks\nago she told me she\u2019s moving out. She got an apartment on Connecticut Avenue. She --\nShe graduated last June and she has a job with a private day school. Actually, it\u2019s a\nsynagogue day school in Washington, on Connecticut Avenue. Yeah Adatz Israel\nPrimary School. And she got an apartment there. I hope she finds good use for the\napartment. Right now, she\u2019s still spending about four days at home. I guess she doesn\u2019t\nwant to admit it, but she comes here for a good home cooked meal. So, that\u2019s it, but like I\nsaid, the life, for the past 30 years with my wife, was wonderful. And if I could change it,\nI would not.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s -- had everything that I needed, wanted, could e -- could expect, or\nwish for.",
        "Q: When you reflect back on the experience that you had, of -- of growing up in Split,\nand having to leave and the -- spending time with the partisans and the -- all the\nupheaval, how do you think that shaped you? I mean, you were still at a point in your\nlife, where you were being shaped. You were not 25 and, you know, already a fully made\nperson. H-How do you -- How do you think that shaped you?",
        "A: Well, I wish I had taken psychology in school, I might have been able to answer that\nquestion a little better. But, I guess everybody\u2019s shaped by the events. Many of these\nevents take place, and the shaping is inside, th-that we are not aware of. We don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s causing what and how we\u2019re being affected. You hear about two brothers,\ngenetically they are the same, maybe even twins. They grow up, one becomes a scientist,\nthe other is a gangster, you know. So the -- I don\u2019t know whether we have the\nenvironment that\u2019s prevalent, that it\u2019s determinant, or whether it\u2019s genes or what. But I --\nI have never stopped to analyze what made me what I am or what I was. I know one\nthing, that at one time, as I was growing up, I think I was very industrious and now I\u2019m\nlazy. The only work I do, mostly it\u2019s volunteering for different things and that\u2019s what I\nhave tonight, the volunteer job and tomorrow. But how we are shaped, that\u2019s for the\npsychologists and psychoanalysts and whatever. I know one thing, that I feel, quote,\nother people\u2019s pain. I know that\u2019s a term, I feel your pain is a common term that doesn\u2019t\nmean anything, but I do. And I feel that I\u2019m conscientious. I know what my\nresponsibilities are and I try to live up to them. Once upon a time, I think I had initiative.\nNow it\u2019ll take -- I don't know what it\u2019Il take to get me moving, you know. And it\u2019s not\nlack of physical ability, because I work out all the time, in the gym. So, you know, I go\nthrough that, and --",
        "Q: Do -- Do you mean since you retired that you\u2019ve -- you call yourself lazy, 1s it -- is it\njust because you\u2019 ve retired?",
        "A: Yeah, [indecipherable], yeah, I think so, yeah. I retired because my wife needed a lot\nof help. She -- At one point she was like a quadriplegic. I-It just went downhill. And you\nknow, th-that may be one reason. Another reason, it\u2019s -- the -- the s -- well, the\natmosphere at work changed. I don\u2019t know if this is appropriate to say, but Ill say it\nanyway, you can clip it out. But white males over 45 or 50, were not preferred species in\nthe government service. In fact, they wanted us out. So, because of the circumstances and\nthe offer they made me, I jumped at the opportunity to leave. Anyway, the -- you know,\nthe work situation was not conducive to a happy feeling, depending on who you were and\nhow you fit, you know, but being who I was just -- I didn\u2019t find it any more chal -- not\nchallenging, any more acceptable, anyway, for me.",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about when you got here to the United States, ho-how you\ncontinued with your faith. You mentioned that your father was -- I mean, it was a very\nstrong component of your life, when you were growing up in your house, you were\ntaught about it. In that period, when you were working and trying to, you know, get\nahead, and then also, in the 30 years with you and your wife, how -- how was that part of\nyour life?",
        "Q: Well, my faith actually -- we were brought up in the faith when we were children.\nHowever, when we went to the partisans -- I have to tell you that partisans were\nSocialists, in fact Communists and faith was not one of the accepted -- what shall I say,\norientations. You know, they were not known for a-ad-advocating religious faith. So, at\nthat point, the faith, because I was in the formative years, I had dropped some of my\nreligious convictions and swung over to the other side, if you will. And then, in this camp\nin Oswego, well, we had the opportunity to practice our religion. But at that point, I was\nsort of rebelling and my father would force me -- of course, kids are forced to do their\nreligious obligations, but -- and then after, when I started working in Philadelphia, I\nwould go to services not as often as one should, but maybe once a month and for the high\nholidays. And we didn\u2019t maintain a kosher home or anything. And then later, when I left\nhome and I was traveling. I was traveling -- When I was single, I was traveling hundred -\n- no, 90 percent of the time, yeah. Because we would go to an installation, and these\ninstallations were in the boonies, you know. I mean, no, it\u2019s -- maybe -- first one that I\nwent to was in Arkansas, you know? West Memphis. Then I went to Clarksville,\nTennessee, it\u2019s Fort Campbell, it was big installation. Then I went to -- near Lexington.\nAnd then, after that, well, I was traveling a lot. When I came to -- In Department Interior,\nI was traveling through what they call Job Corps sites, which meant in the woods, you\nknow. In the -- the areas where they would put these young people that they had to teach\nhow to work. They would take young -- the young teenagers in this -- 15 -16- 17 - 18\nyears of age, from downtown Baltimore and New York, and take them into forests and\nthe national parks, and wildlife preserves, and to build things and they would -- and teach\nthem how to -- well, some of them had fi -- completed 11 grades of high schools, but\ncouldn\u2019t sign their name. Yeah, this was -- they called it conservation work. Okay, so I\nwas -- be visiting these and spend a month there. There\u2019s no ci-civilization. There was --\nbe no synagogues to go to. So, I think I was not diligent enough in my religious\norientation, and -- but I knew who I was and everything, along those lines. I met my wife,\nmy -- the la -- the woman that I married -- well, when we met, again, as I mentioned\nbefore, in the Catskills Mountains -- I say mountains, it\u2019s a -- a place called Concorde,\nwhich was a quite plush resort. I remember one night I counted 17 bands and orchestras,\ndifferent location, within that one hotel. But anyway, after we started dating, I was\nworking in Boston, commuting on weekends to visit her. And then, when we got married,\nwhich was 1969, March \u201869, we moved to this area, that\u2019s where my job was. She still\nlived in Philadelphia. We moved here, first thing we did is look for a synagogue. She\nwas, well, ma -- we found a synagogue in Alexandria, where we still belong, or I still\nbelong. It\u2019s 30 years ago, and our first child wasn\u2019t born yet, but she already knew that\nshe was expecting when we joined the synagogue and I remember when my young -- m-\nmy older one was like six, seven years old, we started coming every Saturday to the\nservices and it was like a comeback, yeah. There\u2019s a Hebrew word -- and I\u2019Il give you the\nHebrew, Baltishua, which means somebody who comes back to the faith, yeah. So I\nwould classify us as such. But this took place like 28 years ago. Yeah, and again, my\nfaith is still very important to me. Currently, I started sort of socially seeing a lady. She\u2019s\nItalian, Catholic, very observant in her religion, but we\u2019re socially, what is it? We\u2019re\ngetting along fine. That\u2019s -- I haven\u2019t told that to my daughters yet, but anyway, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: I just have a couple more questions. You mentioned to me, before we began this\ninterview, that when you did your videotaped interview in 1989, it was one of the first\ntime you\u2019d really talked about the fact that you\u2019d -- that -- that you\u2019re a survivor, you --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- you had it -- an experience in the war that many others have had and I\u2019m just\ncurious about that, why you didn\u2019t talk about it, and then, at what point after you did\nbegin to talk about it, did it shift a little bit?",
        "A: Okay, well, no, the reason I didn\u2019t talk about, 1s because I didn\u2019t believe in\nvictimization. I didn\u2019t want to center my life around history, memories and all that. Lots\nof people have adverse conditions in their earlier parts of their lives, and if they dwell on\nit and make their whole life based on their victimhood, if you will, then they\u2019re not going\nto be very functional. I did not want to think about those things. But then later, when I\nwas being pressed by different people, including my sister -- my younger sister, Esther,\nwhy don\u2019t I join the survivor\u2019s groups and why don\u2019t I do things to, you know, to bring\nout situations, to sort of tell people about our history. I -- For awhile I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the\npoint, what\u2019s the point?\u201d But then they might think that I was being obsessive on that\npart. So I said, \u201cOkay, so if that\u2019s what you think I should do, fine.\u201d And that\u2019s when\nMartin Goldman asked me to do this video and this -- the synagogue was getting ready to\nput out that book a year or two later and like -- when was it, recently, there\u2019s a Jewish in -\n- there is a day in the Jewish calendar called Yom HaShoah, which is a Holocaust\nmemorial. Shoah means Holocaust in Hebrew. I was asked to give it -- a speech, a talk. In\nfact, they asked me to read this letter. It\u2019s like a memorial service for -- for the area. This\nwas in this northern Virginia. Different synagogues ha -- different years they hold it. So I\nspoke at my synagogue one year and last year was to another -- when I say I spoke to my\nsynagogue, it was a community -- not celebration, what do you call it? Commemoration\nlike --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And I spoke to another synagogue in Reston last year, which had this\ncommunity service. And so, today I have no problem talking, although you did see how\nat certain points, I get a little choked up, but it\u2019s not an obsession with me, either way.\nAnd it\u2019s not a big event that made me either block it or release it. No, it just sort of\nflowed on itself.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nIsak Mike Danon. This is tape number five, side A, however, this is being done a week\nlater, on March fifth, 1999. We are still in Springfield, Virginia, it is just another day and\nit is still a follow up interview to the first videotaped interview with Isak Mike Danon, of\nNovember six, 1989. I want you to think back to that period when you have your first\njob, you\u2019re working 1n that felt factory. You have described it as very difficult, you also\ndescribe your whole family as living like church mice. Can you remember at all what was\nin your mind that kept you going, or that you were striving towards? What -- What was\ngiving you strength?",
        "A: Well, I di -- I don\u2019t remember ever thinking too deeply about these things. I know\nsomebody in our family had to earn a living and I was the logical candidate at that time. I\nwas also having fun with -- with the kids my age. We would -- I would say we would run\nthat factory, you know, we\u2019d go wild sometimes, get yelled at, you know, things that 16\nyear old do, 16 - 17 - 18. And that\u2019s how the time passed. And of course, one thing, I\nalways tried to work overtime, to earn a few dollars extra, because I knew the need. And\nlater on, maybe I was a little bit resentful that I had to turn over my entire check to my\nfather, but I guess we just lived on, you know, from day to day and like I said, I started\ngoing to school and I had too many other things on my mind that were more important\nthan worrying about injustice and hard work and all that.",
        "Q: Y-You mentioned turning over your check to your father, and in our interview a week\nago, you talked about your younger sister, at a certain point, when she began earning\nmoney, refused to do it. She said, \u201cNope, this is my money.\u201d How do you explain -- I\nmean, she grew up in the same family, how do you explain her rebellion, really, against\nthis sort of family authority? You were the good son, you were doing what you were\nsupposed to do. Your younger sister, Sarah said no. And so she had acquired a different\nmindset.",
        "A: Well, I guess she became Americanized earlier than I did, that\u2019s one possibility.\nAnother possibility is when she started working, which was several years later, after she\ngraduated from high school, at that time, I guess I was earning a little bit more, my\nmother already started making some money -- not much, in the factory. And so, th-things\nweren\u2019t as tight as they used to be. Plus, both my d -- my sister and I would be -- s-started\ngoing out, you know, so you spend some money and the need is there. And so she got\nbackbone earlier than I did.",
        "Q: You said maybe she was Americanized earlier. Wh-What -- What finally\nAmericanized you, or ha -- when you think back on it, when did you first start to see\nsome ideas that you would consider American and not Yugoslavian, old -- old country?",
        "A: Well, maybe it\u2019s not Americanization, maybe it\u2019s gen -- a generation gap, that started\nsinking into my psyche, you know, my mentality. I don\u2019t know what -- at what point I\nstarted and what did it. I guess I started going out with some of the friends that -- where I\nworked, in the factory. And also school, I started dating a young lady in the class. So, you\nknow, you pick up things here and there, and you -- especially now, you -- and I had the\nsupport from my younger sister, so that was the point where I could assert myself in that\nparticular area. But there were other things where I had differences with my father and I\nasserted myself to a -- to certain extent, but as I look back all the way to my life, I was\nalways low profile, always avoiding confrontations. So maybe that\u2019s the reason. May --\nMay not be Americanization at all, just the term that I use to explain it.",
        "Q: When you think of your friends, h-how would you describe them? Were they a -- a\nmixture, or did you tend to become friendly with other immigrants, within the Jewish\ncommunity? How would you describe the people that you were spending time with?",
        "A: Okay, there were three or four families that came from Fort Ontario with us and is\nseveral in Philadelphia, there weren\u2019t too many. And my parents were in constant contact\nwith them. They would meet once a month for like, what do you call it, potluck kind of\naffairs at different houses. But I was very close with a family -- not family, but with two\nboys who were from Ontario. And I might have mentioned it in the earlier interview, two\nbrother, by name of Barney. They were French and -- French and Bulgarian, but they\nlived in France. And the older one, Raymond Barney remained my very best friend, all\nthroughout my younger days, but much of my limited recreational activity was also with\nmy co-workers in the factory and they were 100 percent Italian. They were un -- living\nunder the same restraints and restriction and limitations that I had, because their parents\nhad the same kind of rules. The parents, or grandparents had come from Italy and they\nwere like second generation Americans. So, I hung out with them and we would go on\nvacations to Atlantic City and things like that. So, one more area where I made friends,\nwas every Sunday afternoon, we would go to the Jewish Y in Philadelphia. And that\u2019s\nwhere -- for working out, swimming, and after that, we go maybe to a movie, or\nrestaurant or something like that. Yeah?",
        "Q: With your Italian friends, were you speaking Italian?",
        "A: No, no, they -- they just knew few key words, which they couldn\u2019t be mentioned in\nmixed company in those days. But anyway, no, they would take me to their homes and I\nwould talk to their parents or grandparents, Italian. But their Italian left something to be\ndesired, because they spoke dialect. Many of them did not know the real Italian language.\nAnd Italian has so many dialects, like one city that\u2019s separated from another city by 30 -\n50 miles, they don\u2019t understand each other. That\u2019s -- You know, they were city - states in\nthe olden days.",
        "Q: And then with Jewish friends, were -- what were you speaking?",
        "A: Oh, my Jewish friends, we s -- they didn\u2019t speak Jewish, this is a younger generation.\nAnd I don\u2019t speak Jewish, so -- no, we spoke English. All the young people, even in Fort\nOntario spoke English. We had, I forget how many different nationalities. I think they\nsaid 160 or something, you know, large number of different nationalities. And English\nlanguage was the unifying element.",
        "Q: S-So, by the time you\u2019re in Philadelphia, how is your English?",
        "A: Oh, my English was quite good within a month or two that we were in United States.\nNo, I -- When it comes to learning languages -- and I have a little key thought on that --\nwhen it comes to learning languages, total immersion is the only answer in my mind,\nbecause I saw how long it took us from nothing to total, well, fluency, if you will. When\nwe came to Fort Ontario, when we started going to schools, what happened, they put us\nin a school with the rest of the kids. There was no issue, you know, you speak this\nlanguage or you speak that language, so keep you separated. So, for awhile we just sat\nthere, like bumps on the log, you know, not doing anything or not responding. But, it was\nsinking in and I remember like in the school where I went to, we had maybe about 16 -\n17 kids from Fort Ontario. I was the first one that got on the dean\u2019s list, and that was\nwithin second -- well, the second report card period, and we had six each year, like three\nin the first semester, and three in the second -- every six or seven weeks. So, I got on the\ndean\u2019s list the first time. The very next time, was three of us, but the others were on the\nhigh ca -- high honors and I was still on the dean list. Next semester I got on the high\nhonor list. It was like a competition, yeah. And the language was not a barrier, especially\nwe excelled in English grammar, because there was no grammar to worry about, actually,\nwhereas the kids that were born here, they struggled, they didn\u2019t know objective case\nfrom nominative case, whatever. We were familiar with other languages, which had\nmuch more complex grammatical structures. So, that and of course, many of us were a\nlittle bit older than the other kids. Not all, but I was older than others in my fir -- class,\nwhere I was first assigned. So, they kept promoting us, you know, social promotions, if\nyou will. And the language was the easiest thing to absorb. That was not an issue.",
        "Q: What were your parents speaking at home?",
        "A: My parents spoke at home, Serbo-Croatian, or Ladino, which is --",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: -- yeah, if you -- if you remember, I explained last time what it is.",
        "Q: Did you ever learn to speak Yiddish?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, we were not exposed to that particular a-area of, you know, people who came\nfrom where Yiddish was spoken.",
        "Q: You were Sephardic.",
        "A: We -- Yeah. Ours was what we call Sephardic, so yeah, Ladino was the spoken\ntongue.",
        "Q: I want you to think back about -- we\u2019ve been talking a lot about what was going on\nwith you, but what was going on in the country, in the United States? I want to know if\nyou have any memories, in 1954, up to 1960 - \u201861, of the beginnings of the struggle for\nAmerican Blacks to get equality in education? Do you remember hearing about that,\nthinking about that, even witnessing anything?",
        "A: Well, let me take you back a few years, to 1944, when we were put in, in these classes\nwith regular American kids. And I, and many of my contemporaries, the immigrants, we\nwere very, Ill use the word rebellious. We couldn\u2019t absorb the American way of, I am\nnumber one, always yelling, you know, because some of the proverbs that I knew, and\nthat we were brought up under, tell you, if you\u2019re the one that\u2019s praising yourself, you\nmust be pretty low on the totem pole. So we did not accept when the teachers in the\nSocial Science class -- Social Studies class would tell us how Americans have the great\ndemocracy and you know, justice for all and saying your Pledge of Allegiance, allegiance\nwith liberty and justice for all. And we would say, \u201cYeah, what about the Negroes?\u201d That\nwas the term that was used in those days. \u201cWhat about the Negroes?\u201d And one time the\nteacher says, \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of you guys bringing this up,\u201d you know. And then I\nwould start saying, \u201cWell, how about if I mention South America and all that?\u201d Now, we\nwere politically aware of what was going up, so this is like an introduction, so you can\nsee what was in back of our minds. When the -- When the Negro movement started\ncoming out, you said in \u201854, I was totally involved in my studies and you know, work full\ntime and trying to take as many credit -- credit hours that I could at college, and there\nwere too many things on my mind to get involved politically. I -- I sympathized with the\ncause, but there were other conflicting things, such as I was attending a university in\nPhiladelphia, called Temple University, which was located in a section which was\nreferred to by the newspapers as quote, The Jungle. So I really -- night I would have to\ncome there and try to park my car, and it was located on Broad Street, which was a pretty\nwell lit street, but then it extended several blocks deep, into what I would call projects.\nThey were pretty poor areas, they were hundred percent Black. And that was pretty\ndangerous, at the time. Every so often there were killings and stuff. So, I don\u2019t know -- I -\n- I cannot recall how this conflict played in my mind. Struggle for independence versus\nthe criminal elements that were roaming in their sections. So, I just don\u2019t know how I felt\nabout that. But later on, when Vietnam was came, then I started participating, because,\nyeah I was fully free of all my educational requirements. I had graduated from college by\nthen and I was doing mostly traveling at that time, so my time was free, and I was one of\nthe protesters at one time or another, for different causes.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that? Think back to one of the protests, and --",
        "A: Well, you know, to -- There were protests for equal rights. I participated in those. And\nthere were protests for -- against the -- the Vietnam war. I did some participation in that,\nalthough I was turned -- turned off, because of the -- some of the characteristics of the\npeople who participated in there. There was a lot of anti-Semitism by the Blacks at that\ntime, and I -- there was a lot of Jews, young, you know, Jewish students that were\nparticipants, but what bothered me, that they never stood up and objected to the overt\nanti-Semitism by the quote, leadership of the -- this anti- Vietnam movement. And even if\nyou went -- tried to participate in the Civil Right activities, there was lot of anti-\nSemitism, so I f-found this dichotomy, I said that, you know, it\u2019s making it difficult for\nme to participate in one cause, while they\u2019re acting in this manner. And there was, of\ncourse, lot of drugs going on, which I never, never touched. I was single in those days,\njust to remind you. So anyway, but -- So I sort of pulled back from that, and I put it back\nof my mind. I don\u2019t know that I gave it another thought since then.",
        "Q: I just wonder, I have heard of anti-Semitism in the Black community that might have\neffected, for instance, Jewish Civil Rights workers, but I have not heard too much about\nanti-Semitism in the anti-war movement. I just wonder if you could say a little bit more\nabout that.",
        "A: It was rampant. There -- They were accusing, well like now, they are accusing them of\nspreading AIDS and you know, in through certain times way back in history, they\naccused them of poisoning wells and drinking blood and all that, you know, it\u2019s -- and lot\nof them -- I don\u2019t know who the leaders of the anti- Vietnam war movement were. There\nwere many Jewish names, if you think of the -- what is it, Chicago seven, you know, and\nall that, there\u2019s a lot of Jewish names, but of course they were not participating -- I mean,\nthey were not practicing Jews, number one. Number two, they were blinded by the\npurpose of their cause and everything else didn\u2019t matter. And number three, I guess they\nwere afraid to be it -- if they objected, they were afraid to be accused of not being quote,\ngood rebels or something, you know. So, and maybe they were even anti-Semitic\nthemselves, in -- there\u2019s self hate in every group and I know there\u2019s enough of that\namong the Jewish rebellious youth. So, you know, I really don\u2019t know what I can say\nabout that subject.",
        "Q: A little more on the anti-war movement. What -- How did you reconcile, or was it\nnecessary for you to reconcile your love of this country? You mentioned how quickly\nyou became a citizen and the sometime anti-American sentiment that came out in the\nprotests -- I\u2019m thinking, of course, of the burning of the flag and that sort of thing. Did\nyou have any conflicts about that?",
        "A: Well, you know, like there is a saying, my country right or wrong, but that\u2019s just part\nof it. If wrong, then to correct it and set it in the right direction. So, I had no problem. I\nmean, burning the flag is a extreme act of some -- of desperation, I would guess and even\nSupreme Court says that that\u2019s acceptable way of protesting which, it goes against my\ngrain, you know, it\u2019s disturbing to see that. But I was opposed to the war and I didn\u2019t see\na need for it and there\u2019s been wars there forever, 1t was imperial wars. Just a substitution\nof F-French left, Americans stepped in. You know, it wa -- continuation of the same and I\nknew how French had treated their imperial subjects and the Americans just continued\nthe same way, so I -- I wasn\u2019t happy about that. But that did not diminish my love for this\ncountry. If we can correct it\u2019s ways, you know. Every now and then, the best of us go in\nthe wrong direction. If always, somebody would put us straight, you know. So I had no\nconflict, as far as that goes.",
        "Q: It\u2019s very interesting, because while you describe as a young man, you, as a young man\nessentially obeying his father\u2019s authority and really doing everything he\u2019s asked to do,\nbut from very early on, when you come to this country, you\u2019re quite comfortable s --\npointing out what is wrong with the country. You referred back to saying, \u201cWhat about\nthe Negroes,\u201d when you were probably only 14 or 15 years old, and then questioning the\nVietnam war. That\u2019s an interesting outlook, I think.",
        "Q: Well, there is an explanation for that, too. I -- I was always interested in taking -- well,\napproaching things in an ac -- academic fashion, debating the pros and cons of different\nissues. But when it came to confrontation and swinging punches, I ran. So, in case of my\nfather, he was the authority, the physical strength, if you will, because he had used his\nsuperior power, physical power on me in the past, so that\u2019s one area. When it came to\nobjecting to things the way they were, like I think a first recorded objection, when we\ncame to Fort Ontario, was the barbed wire. I used the word wi -- fence, but it was a\nbarbed wire fence. We objected to that, of course. That didn\u2019t mean that we want to go\nand have -- fight it out, you know, with the government. And when it came to protesting,\nI was just one in the sea of protesters. And, as a matter of fact, when I lived in\nPhiladelphia, these protests -- Vietnam war, I was already in Washington. Well, I was in\nColumbus and then in Washington. But when I lived in Philadelphia, they had these\ncoffeehouses. This was way back in the early 50\u2019s, and the people would go there, these\nyoung protesters would just read poetry and we would drink coffee and well, I guess\nthere was something else going on, maybe drugs or something, but I was not privy to\nthat. I would just go there as a date, you know, a place to take your date and sip coffee\nand watch these people try to perform, sing, recite, play the guitar and all that. So it was,\nyou know, in the vogue, everybody was doing it, in my circle of friends. And then one\ntime, well, when we were there, the place got raided and we were all taken in, you know.\nBut it -- you know, it doesn\u2019t change my character, I did not go there to have a -- a you\nknow, showdown, to beat up people or get beat up. I just went there because it was the\nthing to do and everybody else did it and I didn\u2019t see any harm in it and whatever else\nwas going on there, that prompted the police to come and arrest everybody in there, well,\nthat\u2019s something that I did not prepare for, you know. And later on, I would engage\npeople in an academic discussion of different political viewpoints or economic\nviewpoints or anything like that. Again, it was non-physical, just debate.",
        "Q: Does that mean you have an arrest on your record?",
        "A: No, no. They -- They -- You know, they held us there, they asked questions. It took a\nfew hours to let us go, but, in fact, we were able to -- I was able to return the girl home\nbefore anybody was aware of anything strange happening, you know. Her parents did not\nknow about it.",
        "Q: Were you frightened when that happened?",
        "A: Terrified. Oh, yeah. Like I said, I mean, I was not out there to challenge authority at\nthat time.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a US Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Isak Mike\nDanon. This is tape number five, side B, March fifth, 1999. I wanted to ask you, jumping\naround a bit here now, with your children, have you -- how open have you been about\nyour history, or h-how detailed? Have you been able to speak openly about your life in\nSplit and your time with the partisans in Italy?",
        "A: Well, here comes another conflict within my psyche. First, let me say that the -- the\nanswer to your question is -- it\u2019s no. I have not spoken freely with --",
        "Q: So you were -- you were beginning to say that -- that the answer to the question is that\nyou haven\u2019t spoken a --",
        "A: Yeah, okay, and the problem is that I never wanted to impose my will or my history or\nmy anything, on anybody, unless they really showed, to my extreme satisfaction that they\nwere interested. So, my kids, I didn\u2019t want to teach them the languages that I knew, I\ndidn\u2019t want to tell them about my history, because this fell in this particular category,\nwhen I was saying, when they are ready to hear my story, if they ask me, I\u2019Il tell them.\nOtherwise, Ill just keep quiet.",
        "Q: Have they asked you?",
        "A: Well, they started asking, the older one. At one point she sort of said, da -- \u201cHow\ncome, Daddy, you never told us about your history and all that?\u201d So I told her, briefly.\nAnd then, after the Holocaust Museum made that tape, they saw it and they did not know\nmost of it, so I guess one of the usefulness of the tape, was to transmit my story to my\nchildren, to that extent that it was done.",
        "Q: Has it changed, has it gotten any easier to talk about it? You actually did refer in our\ninterview that, you know, you -- you -- you have sa -- spoken about it now several times\nwithin this Virginia community.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t think that I have any difficulty speaking about it. I c-certainly don\u2019t have\nany problem in willingness to talk about it. Sometimes, as I talk about certain things,\nthere\u2019s subconscious sensitivity on some points or issues, and I couldn\u2019t even tell you\nwhich ones they are, but sometimes I feel that something is happening to my eyes, you\nknow. So -- But no, there\u2019s no problem, no reluctance on my part, to speak about it.",
        "Q: You mentioned, it was right at the end of our interview, this idea that perhaps you had\ncome back -- that you have come back to your faith, and you mentioned a Hebrew word\nfor it. Bal --",
        "A: Bal Tefulah, yeah. I\u2019m sorry, Bal Teshuah.",
        "Q: Bal Teshuah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I -- I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about what is that like to be back with\nyour faith now? You mentioned that you had come back to it, you had explained why you\nhad drifted from it. What does that -- How does that play out in your life now, this sort of\nreaffirming your f -- Jewish faith?",
        "A: Well, I never really abandoned it, or anything like that, no. What was happening, after\nthe destruction of our synagogue in Split, and after we left Split, really, I was at that\nparticular stage in life, age had lot to do with it, another one 1s the surroundings. I was\nwith the partisans, wearing a red star on my cap, he -- you know, the hat, or whatever it\u2019s\ncalled, the military hat. And they, as you know, and everybody knows, Communists are\nthe opposite end of religion, you know, they are -- and not only agnostic, but they\u2019re\nreally opposed to any form of religion. So I was being at my very vulnerable stage, I was\nbeing exposed to the opposite side of religion. And I guess I absorbed some of that. But\nthen later, when I was in the -- back in the Jewish surrounding, in Fort Ontario, so I\naccepted, I realized, you know, and there was no problem. I never denied being Jewish or\nanything like that. And later on, when I left my parents house, and I went on my own, I\nwas working out of Columbus, Ohio, but they were sending me to Tennessee, and\nArkansas, and Oklahoma, you know, th -- for months at a time. Well, maybe not months,\nfour or five weeks at a time. And in some places, the population was 2,000, you know,\nthe nearest big city. I was doing audits of different installations and there wasn\u2019t very\nmuch Jewish presence. Well, sometimes I s-searched it out. It was always a little bit of\nan effort to -- you had to travel 20 - 30 - 40 miles, to the nearest Jewish community. So,\nsometimes I guess I got sloppy, you know. Friday night, it\u2019s customary to go to the\nJewish religious services, well the guys are going out carousing or whatever, you know,\nso there is -- there was this conflict. If you can imagine when you were in your 20\u2019s, you\nknow. So, that might have been a problem, but when I got married, and I married a girl\nwho -- her father and her household was non-religious to put it mildly, but yeah, we\nsearched that synagogue, within the first year we joined the one that was near us -- well,\nnot too near, but anyway, and we were active participants and then as our children -- as\nwe got children, and as our older one started attending school, we started coming more\noften -- well, regularly. And it\u2019s funny, because the rabbi asked for a commitment from\ncongregants. Any kind of commitment and he says, you know, it was like a -- it wasn\u2019t a\nfund-raiser, but says, \u201cWe\u2019re asking you to commit yourself to something, to tell you that\nyou know who you are.\u201d So I said, \u201cOkay, attendance once a week of the religious\nservices.\u201d And since then, we would bring our daughter to her school this -- on Saturday,\nanyway, we\u2019d stay for the service, and when the other girl was born, then we bring her\nwhen she was small, and we attended regularly and I don\u2019t think I missed one, even with\nthe big snows, so we been quite observant. And then, later, when my older daughter\nbecame, oh, I guess conscious of her religion and all that, she got her mother to convert\nthe kitchen into, you know, kosher home and all that. And I don\u2019t know where we fit on\nthe spectrum of religiosity, but I feel very comfortable in it.",
        "Q: And both of your daughters are very ha-ha-have the religion woven into their lives.\nOne is a rabbi. Your youngest daughter is working at a day care center that\u2019s within a\nsynagogue.",
        "A: Well, yeah, that\u2019s true. As a matter of fact, the telephone call was about that. My\nyounger daughter, when we goes -- when she was here, we would go Saturday for the\nservices and the -- just to let you know, we have three services every day and Saturday\nit\u2019s important to have, like in the morning services and noon services, or afternoon, the\nbig -- the central theme of the Jewish religious observance or ritual, 1s reading the Torah,\nand the Torah is read Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon. So, my younger\ndaughter got accustomed to leading the service, the Saturday afternoon. And this was the\ncantor from our synagogue, says he 1s not going to be here March 13th -- 12th and 13th\nand he wants to know if he can count on my daughter to come and lead the service. And\nshe did that when she was at college and she has been doing it when she was home, here.\nWe would go Saturday morning and stay for the Saturday afternoon service. So she\u2019s\nquite knowledgeable and it\u2019s not something I taught either one of them, they picked it up\non their own.",
        "Q: What is the name of your congregation?",
        "A: Agoudas Acheim, which means congregation of brothers. It\u2019s not a sexist term,\nbrothers. Brothers includes sisters, also.",
        "Q: And where is it?",
        "A: It\u2019s in Alexandria. It\u2019s near Quaker Lane and what is it, 395.",
        "Q: Have you ever been back to Split, where -- where -- where you were born, since you\nleft, with the partisans, really?",
        "A: No, I have not been back. At one point I was considering it seriously, but somehow\nother things got in the way. When I was in the military, during the Korean conflict, they\nsend me to -- first to Germany and then France. And at several times, like during vacation\ntime, I would go travel around Europe and I never went back to Yugoslavia, because it\nwas still under the Communist rule and I didn\u2019t know what kind of foolish things they\nmight do, like oh my papers might show that I was born there and they might retain me or\nsomething and that wouldn\u2019t f-fit too well with my military requirement to be on the post,\nyou know. We -- Anyway, no, that was one fear. And one time, I went to a religious\nretreat in Bavaria and we went to Salzburg, Austria, which is not too far from\nYugoslavian border -- Yugoslav border, and I\u2019m -- I was toying with the idea, going\nacross, well, I had a few days free time, so I figure, maybe I rather spend them in Munich\nand was some -- Salzburg and those areas, than take a chance going across. And I didn\u2019t\nknow what kind of roads they had and I read about lots of accidents, traffic accidents and\nwe were, well, limited time, so I didn\u2019t go. But, all my o -- both of my younger sisters\nwent there. The younger one went in 1957, the youngest one. That\u2019s when she was\nearning enough money on her own to have her own kind of vacation. She went, visited\nmy older sister there. And she enjoyed her stay and the country seemed even prettier than\nit was in her mind, in her imagination. And the middle sister, Sarah, she went right before\nthe war, this present conflict, like 1990 - \u201891, I think. She and her husband, and they\ntoured the country and she retained quite a few good memories of her visit. But I never\nwent back, even though my brother-in-law keeps bugging me, keeps asking me to come\nthere, and visit.",
        "Q: What have been your thoughts as the present conflict in -- in a very horrific period o-\nof war in the country have -- have played out over the past few years?",
        "A: Well, I knew what was happening in that country and anybody who was interested,\ncould have read a little bit about what the -- the basis of the country and the influences\nfrom outside, and I can be as specific as you want me to be. But I\u2019m not too proud of the\nstaff in our state department. If -- If you want me -- okay --",
        "Q: Te-Tell us some, yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: I am very -- This is an interesting point, and I would like to know what you think\nabout it.",
        "A: Okay, well, first of all, the country was created from all these different, southern\nSlavs. Many were under Turkish occupations and others, even more, were under Austro-\nHungary empire. And the -- some under Italian occupation, but these people were\nbrought up differently. They had different religions, different scripts and different\nhistory. So they were not the same kind. Ethnically, I guess, many years back, they came\nfrom the same origin, but because of these power -- super-power interplays, and controls\nand agitation, they -- the super-powers played on the differences and they instigated these\npeople. Divide and conquer, it\u2019s a old expression and it\u2019s -- it was true. So Germany and\nthrough Austria, actually, was funding the protests and the uprising of the Croatians and\nthe Serbians, they were monarchy for a longer time and they had fought the Turks and so\nthere was -- the conflict was being raised. They were supported -- Serbia was supported\nby Russia, of course, because that\u2019s the big brother, Russia, and was supported also by\nFrance and England. So there was that inner conflict. Now, what we call Bosnia today,\nactually it\u2019s Bosnia and Herzegovina -- nobody can pronounce the Herzegovina part.\nAnyway, these were just two little provinces. As far as I know, they never had a political\nautonomy. And they were shuffled back and forth between Turkish empire and Austro-\nHungarian empire. At the time when my parents were born, this was under Austro-\nHungarian empire, but there was enough Turkish influence there, from various periods.\nAnyway, so as I was trying to emphasize, there was a lot of the conflict fueled by the\noutside powers. So, when the Germans came in the play, of course they made the\nsupreme break, they armed the Croatian, you know, and they -- they gave the Croatian\nauthority to kill and the Croatian outdid themselves killing Jews, of course, but Serbs,\ntoo. And that was in everybody\u2019s mind after the war. So Tito, when he became the leader\nof the partisans, he tried to unify them back to where they could live with each other. And\nwhatever it took, I guess we heard about pax romana, but we had pax Yugoslavia,\nwhatever. Tito, you know, he was -- yeah, he was the dictator, no question about it. And\nhe was a Communist, but he was very pragmatic. He allowed anything that worked for\nhim, so economically, he abandoned Communism and put in some form of free\nownership, private ow-ownership and free trade and all that. But anyway, I knew when\nhe would pass away, that there was -- something was going to happen, because he didn\u2019t\nbuild a natural succe-succession force. He did provide the mechanism, but no way to\nenforce it, because the control of the country was with the secret police and the army and\nhe didn\u2019t have people who -- who were going to take over those phases after he was\ngone. But anyway, so when -- whenever it was, six, seven years ago, when Croatians\ndeclared themselves independent, first 1t was Slovenia, and the Yugoslav army tried to\nput down the insurrection, if you will. And they were not successful, because they had to\ncross Croatia and Slovenia was in the mountains and it was not the most effective way of\nconducting a war. So Slovenia succeeded in seceding from Yugoslavia. Then when\nCroatia seceded, they had all these people from way back, the ones that were Fascists and\nthey -- they took over the power. And when there was a conflict in bosni -- yeah, well, I\nwant to say the Croatians -- the Fascists took over the power and the Serbian government,\nunder this guy Milosevic, and he must be some kind of a kook, you know. He\u2019s -- I guess\nhe\u2019s a Yugoslav Saddam Hussein. But they tried to punish the Croatian and instead of\ntaking, let\u2019s say territory, they would just go there and destroy. Like, that was their way\nof discouraging, but not a very civilized way. But anyway, the Croatians were not very\ncivilized either, so -- and when I look at it, that\u2019s all evil, it\u2019s all around and which one is\nthe worst, and in my mind, I say Croatians are worse than the others. But unfortunately\nfor my viewpoint, American government encouraged the Croatian, funded it and we were\nthere, we were in a position to pacify that area, we didn\u2019t do anything. In fact, whatever\nwe did was -- this was, much of it was done under Jim Baker\u2019s rule. Jim Baker, he was\nGeorge Bush\u2019s Secretary of State, but I -- I would call him president, because he was\nacting in that position. So, I didn\u2019t like what was going on. Libya and Iran were sending\narms to Bosnians, to the Moslem side and of course, they had no way to get the arms\nthrough, except through American controlled areas. So we just let them and the Croatians\nwould take half for themselves and give the Moslems the other half. And that\nencouraged, you know, s-stri -- fighting. And I think we picked the wrong side in that\nconflict. We could have pacified it, we didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s my viewpoint.",
        "Q: Pll just ask one more question, and this is about your eldest sister Blanca, and her life.\nHow did she fare in Yugoslavia? What kind of life did she lead, un-under this\nCommunist regime?",
        "A: Okay, the kind of life that my sister had under the Communist regime was not\npleasant. Number one, when they were -- she uses the term demobilized, after the end of\nthe struggle, she came home to Split. Of course, everything that we ow -- had owned, was\ntaken, but she was able to find out where some of the furnishings were, like the bedroom\nset and the dining room and the, you know, just the furniture. And she tried to recover\nthat and they were giving her a hard time. The government was not very friendly toward\nthe Jewish returnees, if you will. People who had been either in the armed services, or\nwho had escape and came back. Either -- Well, I don\u2019t know if anybody who listens to\nthis, whether they remember what happened when the Jews tried to come back from the\nconcentration camps. In Poland, they would be attacked and many would die and all that.\nSo, the anti-Semitism was rampant, just as much after the war as it was during the war,\nexcept now it was not under the approval of the state, but just -- the state would sort of\nturn away, or wink, or whatever. So, it was difficult. She used to tell us how she had\ndifferent problems trying to reclaim this. And then finally, she went to court and very\nunsympathetic. No, it was very uns-unsympathetic government and when she did get it, it\nhad the -- the furniture had degenerated to a point that it wasn\u2019t worth anything, so it was\ndumped. And she didn\u2019t have any means of support. She lived with her uncle, who was a\nbarber and she -- there was an aunt that came from Fort Ontario, went back. She lived\nwith them also. And they were very poor. The life was difficult for everybody after the\nwar, but especially for her and she was by herself, there was nobody there. And we\nsuggested several times that she should try to come and we could try -- work on it, but\neither we were not energetic enough or she was not enthusiastic enough, so nothing was\never done. Then she met a young man and she wanted to marry him and we were\nopposed to that, because of religious differences. And I -- They married anyway and then\nlife improved for them as -- well, she was still studying, and life improved as he started\nmaking a more comfortable living.",

        "Q: I want to ask you to sort of think -- I want to ask you to think and reflect on your\nwhole family, with this question, which is that, how do you make sense of the fact, that\nwhen the war came, everyone in your family was a very tenacious person and survivor.\nThey met it with tenacity. Your sister Blanca went off to fight with the partisans. You\nand your father went off to join the social organization. And then, as you said in your\nfirst interview, your mother and your sisters -- and your little nine year old sister led your\n-- your mother into hiding. Where do you think that quality came from in your family, of\nmeeting this horrible situation with such determination?",

        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "Q: Can you tell me any more that you heard about, what actually happened in your\nvillage, or for instance, to your house?",

        "Q: -- really go in -- in depth on that.",

I\u2019m going to jump a little bit to when you and your father have gotten to Italy,\nand then I want a -- you to remember -- you\u2019ve -- you\u2019ve told much of this story in your\nfirst interview, which you did in 1989, but I want you to remember and tell us some of\nthe details of how you were reunited with your mother and sisters.

Was there a point when\nyou started to relax, or perhaps it was watching your mother and father?",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about any memories you might have had of -- of how your\nmother and father kind of readjusted to each other, or were able to share their experiences\nwith each other?",
        "Q: If you could just talk a little bit about what the experience of spending all that extra\ntime with your father? You were, essentially, sometimes you were separated, but you\nwere really with him, day and day and day and day out. I\u2019m just curious if --",

        "Q: You mentioned again -- In your first interview, you mentioned the Japanese\ninternment and I ha -- a -- maybe suggested a parallel there.

I mean, you were still at a point in your\nlife, where you were being shaped. You were not 25 and, you know, already a fully made\nperson. H-How do you -- How do you think that shaped you?",
        "Q: Do -- Do you mean since you retired that you\u2019ve -- you call yourself lazy, 1s it -- is it\njust because you\u2019 ve retired?",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit about when you got here to the United States, ho-how you\ncontinued with your faith. You mentioned that your father was -- I mean, it was a very\nstrong component of your life, when you were growing up in your house, you were\ntaught about it. In that period, when you were working and trying to, you know, get\nahead, and then also, in the 30 years with you and your wife, how -- how was that part of\nyour life?",
        "Q: Well, my faith actually -- we were brought up in the faith when we were children.\nHowever, when we went to the partisans -- I have to tell you that partisans were\nSocialists, in fact Communists and faith was not one of the accepted -- what shall I say,\norientations. You know, they were not known for a-ad-advocating religious faith. So, at\nthat point, the faith, because I was in the formative years, I had dropped some of my\nreligious convictions and swung over to the other side, if you will. And then, in this camp\nin Oswego, well, we had the opportunity to practice our religion. But at that point, I was\nsort of rebelling and my father would force me -- of course, kids are forced to do their\nreligious obligations, but -- and then after, when I started working in Philadelphia, I\nwould go to services not as often as one should, but maybe once a month and for the high\nholidays. And we didn\u2019t maintain a kosher home or anything. And then later, when I left\nhome and I was traveling. I was traveling -- When I was single, I was traveling hundred -\n- no, 90 percent of the time, yeah. Because we would go to an installation, and these\ninstallations were in the boonies, you know. I mean, no, it\u2019s -- maybe -- first one that I\nwent to was in Arkansas, you know? West Memphis. Then I went to Clarksville,\nTennessee, it\u2019s Fort Campbell, it was big installation. Then I went to -- near Lexington.\nAnd then, after that, well, I was traveling a lot. When I came to -- In Department Interior,\nI was traveling through what they call Job Corps sites, which meant in the woods, you\nknow. In the -- the areas where they would put these young people that they had to teach\nhow to work. They would take young -- the young teenagers in this -- 15 -16- 17 - 18\nyears of age, from downtown Baltimore and New York, and take them into forests and",
        "Q: I just have a couple more questions. You mentioned to me, before we began this\ninterview, that when you did your videotaped interview in 1989, it was one of the first\ntime you\u2019d really talked about the fact that you\u2019d -- that -- that you\u2019re a survivor, you --",
        "Q: -- you had it -- an experience in the war that many others have had and I\u2019m just\ncurious about that, why you didn\u2019t talk about it, and then, at what point after you did\nbegin to talk about it, did it shift a little bit?",

This is tape number five, side A, however, this is being done a week\nlater, on March fifth, 1999. We are still in Springfield, Virginia, it is just another day and\nit is still a follow up interview to the first videotaped interview with Isak Mike Danon, of\nNovember six, 1989. I want you to think back to that period when you have your first\njob, you\u2019re working 1n that felt factory. You have described it as very difficult, you also\ndescribe your whole family as living like church mice. Can you remember at all what was\nin your mind that kept you going, or that you were striving towards? What -- What was\ngiving you strength?",
        "Q: Y-You mentioned turning over your check to your father, and in our interview a week\nago, you talked about your younger sister, at a certain point, when she began earning\nmoney, refused to do it. She said, \u201cNope, this is my money.\u201d How do you explain -- I\nmean, she grew up in the same family, how do you explain her rebellion, really, against\nthis sort of family authority? You were the good son, you were doing what you were\nsupposed to do. Your younger sister, Sarah said no. And so she had acquired a different\nmindset.",
        "Q: You said maybe she was Americanized earlier. Wh-What -- What finally\nAmericanized you, or ha -- when you think back on it, when did you first start to see\nsome ideas that you would consider American and not Yugoslavian, old -- old country?",
        "Q: When you think of your friends, h-how would you describe them? Were they a -- a\nmixture, or did you tend to become friendly with other immigrants, within the Jewish\ncommunity? How would you describe the people that you were spending time with?",
        "Q: With your Italian friends, were you speaking Italian?",
        "Q: And then with Jewish friends, were -- what were you speaking?",
        "Q: S-So, by the time you\u2019re in Philadelphia, how is your English?",

        "Q: You were Sephardic.",
        "Q: I want you to think back about -- we\u2019ve been talking a lot about what was going on\nwith you, but what was going on in the country, in the United States? I want to know if\nyou have any memories, in 1954, up to 1960 - \u201861, of the beginnings of the struggle for\nAmerican Blacks to get equality in education? Do you remember hearing about that,\nthinking about that, even witnessing anything?",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that? Think back to one of the protests, and --",
        "Q: I just wonder, I have heard of anti-Semitism in the Black community that might have\neffected, for instance, Jewish Civil Rights workers, but I have not heard too much about",
        "Q: A little more on the anti-war movement. What -- How did you reconcile, or was it\nnecessary for you to reconcile your love of this country? You mentioned how quickly\nyou became a citizen and the sometime anti-American sentiment that came out in the\nprotests -- I\u2019m thinking, of course, of the burning of the flag and that sort of thing. Did\nyou have any conflicts about that?",
        "Q: It\u2019s very interesting, because while you describe as a young man, you, as a young man\nessentially obeying his father\u2019s authority and really doing everything he\u2019s asked to do,\nbut from very early on, when you come to this country, you\u2019re quite comfortable s --\npointing out what is wrong with the country. You referred back to saying, \u201cWhat about\nthe Negroes,\u201d when you were probably only 14 or 15 years old, and then questioning the\nVietnam war. That\u2019s an interesting outlook, I think.",
        "Q: Well, there is an explanation for that, too. I -- I was always interested in taking -- well,\napproaching things in an ac -- academic fashion, debating the pros and cons of different\nissues. But when it came to confrontation and swinging punches, I ran. So, in case of my",

Have you been able to speak openly about your life in\nSplit and your time with the partisans in Italy?",

        "Q: I -- I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about what is that like to be back with\nyour faith now?

        "A: Yeah. K-a-b-1-l-j-o.",
        "A: I was born June 24th, 1929, in Split, which is currently Croatia, used to be\nYugoslavia.",
        "A: My parents were born in a suburb of Sarajevo, a little town called Reeserko. Sarajevo\nis in bo -- in Bosni -- Bosnia, as we pronounce it, and they came to Split separately and\nthey met there.",
        "A: My grandfather, on my mother\u2019s side, his name was Haim Kabiljo. He came to Split\nfrom Sarajevo, a little bit before World War One. He didn\u2019t do too well wherever they\nlived, so somebody suggested to him that he could come and work with them in Split. He\nput him in a business doing -- making mattresses by hand. This was what he would do;\nwhen people would order, he would custom make a mattress. My grandmother didn\u2019t\nwork. That was not customary for women to work out of the house. My grandfather was\nalso a shamus, which is a sexton in the -- in the synagogue in Split, and he lived right\nnext door, which was provided by the synagogue for him. My grandparents on my\nfather\u2019s side lived in Vizoco, which is the same -- a suburb of Sarajevo now. My gran --\ngrandfather, his name was Isak, I was named for him and so were four of my cousins. He\n-- He didn\u2019t do anything, really. He used to have a grocery store and then he co-signed\nfor somebody on their loan and the other person defaulted, so they took my grandfather\u2019s\nstore in payment. My grandmother\u2019s name was Blanca, which was -- my older sister was\nnamed for her. And again, she didn\u2019t work out of the house, but she would take in\nsewing, so they survived. There was a wh-whole bunch of brothers that were growing up,\nand she, with her sewing, supported the househo -- the household, excuse me.\ngrandparents and parents, a part of that town, particularly, of course, of -- of the Jewish\ncommunity?",
        "A: My grandfather, Haim Kabiljo, he, as I mentioned earlier, was a sexton, and his main\nfunction was, as a sexton, to keep the synagogue in an order, make sure that it\u2019s clean,\nthat it was -- all the things that are needed. And also, one of the big problem was that we\nhad a very small Jewish community and one of the big problems was trying to get a\nminyan, or a quorum, for the services every day. So he would go searching for people,\nmen. In those days, only men counted for the quorum. He would go around searching and\nasking them to come to the services. I failed to mention, when he got a little older, and\nhis children were grown up, he s-started sort of s -- a little store, what they sold was yard\ngoods, mostly. It was a very small store, and one of my aunts, I think she was next to the\nyoungest of his children, she worked in that store. My grandfather was well known in the\nJewish community, as one can imagine, and my mother had just terrific memories and\nshe always talked about him after he passed away. But I was about nine years old when\nhe died, so I remember him. When we would go visit our parents in our store, we would\ntake a walk and go say hello to him, or we would meet him sometimes on the street and I\nremember every time we met him, he would reach in his little pocket, which 1s -- he had a\nwatch in the pocket, watch with a chain, and he would pull out a coin. A Yugoslav coin\nwas called a dinar. He always had a dinar for me. That was good for an ice cream or a\ncouple of candies. So ah -- we had tremendous memories of him. Our grandmother, she\nwas a little bit rougher. She didn\u2019t have the finesse to deal with the little children. So our\nmemories are not as good as -- about her. Now, my other grandmother, I remember her.\nShe was a very hard working woman. She was a good cook and a good baker and she\nmade lots of sweets, which we always enjoyed. She would ship them to us. Once a year\nwe would get a package of all kinds of goods, jellies, marmalades, cookies. Even a\nhomemade salami, occasionally, which I didn\u2019t care too much for, because it had an\nonion-y smell to it. But these are memories of a childhood. Since then, I learned to love\nonions.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, our faith was a central thing in our lives. Both my mother and father had\ngrown up in the religious homes. We are what is known na -- here, as Sephardic, which,\nfor those who don\u2019t know, means that we are descendant of the Jews who lived in Spain,\nand after the expulsion, they went to either Turkey, or they went to Genoa and crossed\nover to Italy, or they went to Turkey and moved with the Turkish occupation. They\nmoved further up and of course Sarajevo was Turkish outpost and that\u2019s where they --\nthey must have come that route, I think. Although Split was settled by Jews of Italian\ndescent, which means that the most people who live 1 -- most Jews who lived in Split,\ncame from Spain, through Genoa, through Italy, and crossed over the Adriatic, into Split.\nAs I said, our -- our religion played a central role in our lives. We observed all of the\nholidays, quite religiously. We never went to school on any of the Jewish holidays. We\nmaintained a kosher home, and we -- the education was such in Yugoslavia, that the\nprimary subject in the public school was religion. So, because we were a very small\nminority, when the priest would come to teach religion, we would be excused, we would\nhave a free period. And there is a payback, later we would have to go twice a week to the\n-- some facility, usually was one central school, well all -- where all the Jewish kids\nwould come and we would have Jewish education, which consisted of course, of\nreligious observances, Hebrew, history and well, songs and such. That\u2019s about what I\nremember, as a young child.",
        "A: Well, I think the Jews were in -- in the town of Split, they were pretty well integrated\nwith the general community. Most of the Jews in Split were either small merchant -- and\nI\u2019m emphasizing small, or they were professional people, doctors, lawyers, accountants,\nand such. So, I don\u2019t think that there was too much distinction, as I was growing up. The\n-- We had, in the neighborhood, we were totally integrated and in the business\ncommunity, you sa -- s -- have, let\u2019s say, shoe stores, there would be several of them, one\nmight be owned by a Jewish family. The rest would be owned by the local, whatever\nreligion. Prevailing religion in Split, was of course, Roman Catholicism, and -- but they\nalso had a few, I guess you might call them Serbian Orthodox, or Eastern Orthodox, but\nprevailing Serbs. So, we were -- as kids we were lumped with s-some of the Eastern\nOrthodox in school, because we were the ones -- we and them, were the ones who were\ntold we can be excused during the religious instructions in the class. But the classes were\nconducted still -- there was a big crucifix on the wall and everybody had to say the\nCatholic prayers, which we would just stand up and not say them. But this was true fo --\nboth of us, and the Serbian Orthodox kids. And some -- some classes, there were a few of\nthose and few Jews. Sometimes I would be the only one of my faith or only one who was\nnot a Roman Catholic. So I -- I didn\u2019t feel too much of a -- a burden, and especially when\nit was time to be excused. I accepted that gladly. Yeah?",
        "A: Well, I think that -- I had a teacher who liked me. I was the best student in class. That\nwas my -- I don\u2019t know whether that was a burden I carried, but I enjoyed studies. So --\nAnd I was a very, very small kid for my age. Everybody towered over me. So everybody\nconsidered me like a -- I don\u2019t know, like a little puppy and the teacher did, too. I\nremember now, that I\u2019m being asked to recall some of these things, I remember I would\nbe cuddled by every teacher over there. We didn\u2019t have any male teachers, just female\nteachers, and they were all single, not -- none of them usually were married. Anyway, so,\nnobody ever said anything. I -- I know, in fact, later on, at one point, I learned from\nsomebody that there was a possibility of having an interfaith prayer. So I suggested that,\nand she accepted it for awhile. I guess she was reprimanded later on. But this came --\nThere was at -- somebody who had left Romania and moved to Yugoslavia and this one\nyoung girl said that they had that ecumenical prayers. So she gave me the translation of\nthe Romanian ecumenical prayer, which I -- which is the one that I brought to my\nteacher, and that\u2019s the one that was tried, for awhile, anyway.",
        "A: Today, you mean?",
        "A: Oh, you -- you mean like [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, well, that was true for a long while. However, the situation started changing\nwith the political situation. And I would say the first changes were when Hitler took over\nAustria and there was pressure on every country nearby, to sign up with the axis powers.\nSo, there was again, like I mentioned to you earlier, I was told once not to talk about\npolitics, but this is not politics, this is -- this relates to the Holocaust. There was a party in\nthe -- in that area, the Croatian area, called Ustashi and they were beginning to rise up,\nwith assistance from the Austrian government and later from the Germans. And they\nwere agitating, and of course, they took the same -- Hitler\u2019s, you know, values, and\npreachings and that\u2019s -- at that point, started getting somewhat -- more and more\nuncomfortable for us. In fact, occasionally, we w -- we would be attacked by the local\nkids and I\u2019m not talking about stealing our lunch, or anything like that, although that took\nplace on occasions, but just for the sake of playing the role that they heard from their\nparents, who were sympathizers of the Fascist governments.",
        "A: Oh yeah, very much so. The -- Split was located on the sea and there were areas, the\nbeach, and Saturday morning I was always at the synagogue and we didn\u2019t have school\nSaturday and others -- friends of mine my age, and I, we -- we were pretty close, so\nSaturday after the services, we would go for a walk, and there was areas in the city that\nwere well known for people walking. But we would go further, we would go to the areas\nthat are beach fronts and in the winter months this was sort of nice, because it wasn\u2019t\ncrowded -- it wasn\u2019t too crowded. There were people there, because Split was in a -- I\nwon\u2019t call it temperate zone, but it was very comfortable, especially if you could be\nshielded from the wind, and our beaches were shielded. So, we would go walk, maybe\neven take our shoes off and walk in the -- on the surf. And sometimes, or one time,\nwasn\u2019t just one time, but often, some of these other kids from the neighborhood would\nstart throwing the rocks at us, and stones. And, you know, I learned to fling rock pretty\nwell, also, but they were usually in the majority, so we always ended up at the short end\nof the stick.",
        "A: Well, there was no doubt, because they accompanied their attacks with vocal attacks,\ntoo. So there was no doubt why they were doing it. They -- They made it quite clear, so --",
        "A: Okay, well, first of all, when Hitler started coming on the scene, maybe 1935 or \u201836, I\nwas only six or seven years old. But in those areas, we -- the kids, six, seven, we were\npretty aware of what was going on, because we had to be and we heard our parents listen\nto the radi -- I mean, we heard them talk, listen to the radio intensively. You know,\neverybody had to keep quiet while they were listening to the news and what was going\non. And so we were quite aware. And at first -- well, the first signs, we knew that there\nwas an effort being made to teach the Jewish community, the grown ups, the adults, teach\nthem some form of a trade, because they were saying, 1n case you have to leave in a\nhurry, how are you going to support yourself unless you have a trade, something that you\ncan do with your hands. So there was -- a few courses were set up in a club that we had,\nlike photography, like working with the leather, tailoring. I know my sister took up\nsewing and she learned pretty well how to sew.",
        "A: My older sister. Her name was Blanca, named after my paternal grandmother.\nAnyway, she -- she was very young in those days, too, but she learned how to sew and\nlater on she really made -- made her living sewing and even during the war, when we\nwould get some pictures from her, she would show us the same dress that she had\nchanged and every year it\u2019s look different. That was the only dress she owned. Anyway,\nSO We -- we Sort of saw that things were not going too well in the rest of the world, for the\nJews. And we were conscious, so this learning a trade was one thing --",
        "A: Well --",
        "A: No, more than the people in the com -- Jewish community. The Jewish community,\nthe organized Jewish community would engage some tradesmen to teach the trades. Like\nmaybe on Tuesdays and Thursdays, there would be electrical trade and the carpentry and\nleather --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And maybe on Wednesday would be sewing and cooking and stuff like that, for\nwomen. So this was an organized effort. But then came a few other signs. For instance,\nsome of the instructors -- my sister, her first year in the gymnasium -- first year\ngymnasium is equivalent to fifth grade. She was two years ahead, she was two years\nolder than I was, so she was telling us how her instructor was making anti-Semitic\nremarks to the class. And of course, kids caught on and they emulated their professors.\nAnd also, there were a few of my, quote, friends, that they would sort of jokingly make\nan-anti-Semitic remarks, and -- while they\u2019re hugging me and all that, or trying to copy\nfrom my homework, they would still make those remarks. So there was no question this\nwas happening as gradually as one can perceive it. And in the meantime, the war started\nin -- well, there was the Czechoslovakian take over, what we call peace in our times, and\nthen the war started in Poland, that\u2019s 1939. By that time I was 10 years old and I saw\nwhat was going on in the world and so did everybody around us. And we saw the signs,\nwe would see the -- these Ustashi, they would have their meetings. I don\u2019t know how to\nequate this to the current situation. Would be almost like Blacks living integrated with the\nWhite community, but every Tuesday night, the White community would don the white\nsheets and hoods, you know. And so, is that a sign of something? I guess that would\nindicate, you know, that if -- in case of some trouble, you could not rely on your\nneighbors too well. So, that was another sign.",
        "A: No, my grandfather, by that time, the one in Split, Haim Kabiljo, my maternal\ngrandfather, he had passed away and my grandmother passed away a few months later,\nwell, 10 months later. And the ones in as -- near Sarajevo, I wasn\u2019t in contact with them,\nexcept, well, once or twice we visited. But it wasn\u2019t so simple to go there. So, anyway,\nmy parents, they had friends in the community, Jewish friends, and they would come visit\nus, and in our house and in the our si -- our area of the Jewish community, language that\nwas spoken among my parents and their friends was what we call Ladino. This 1s, for\nthose who are not aware, it\u2019s a Spanish origin, which is laced with words from every\ncountry where they travel. As -- I could give you examples how, maybe Italians take a\nword, English word, put a vowel ending to it and give it ail or a la article and --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Anyway, I -- I have some Italian friends and I know they take an English word and\ngive it an ending, a vowel ending, put an article, like you know, whatever kind of article,\nI mean masculine or feminine and it becomes an Italian word, and into the next\ngeneration it may still remain. Well, Ladino is created that way and I can equate it like\nYiddish is a German laced with Polish, Russian, whate -- other language, wherever the\nJews lived in those days. So, Ladino was the prevalent language among my parent\u2019s\nfriends and we learned the language very early, so our parents couldn\u2019t talk secrets in our\npresence, we knew what was going on. Anyway, so they -- they talked very somberly\nabout the world\u2019s situation in those days and, you know, it\u2019s contagious. Whatever your\nparents fears and th-thoughts are, you -- you catch on to it and you emulate.",
        "A: Okay. I -- I had three sisters. One was older than I was. She was born in May fif --\nMay 15, 1927, two years older than me. And then I have a sister Sarah. She was born in\nJanuary fifth, 1931 and I have a sister Esther and she was born September -- correct,\nOctober 30th, 1935. And my older sister, Blanca, she passed away in 1993, she had\nbreast cancer. And my two other sisters, Sarah lives in Philadelphia, and Esther lives in\nBaltimore. And well, s -- Sarah, right now is what they call a snowbird. She\u2019s currently in\nFlorida, to avoid the winter.",
        "A: Oh, okay, well, the values that my parents taught us, are the values that I like to teach\nmy children and I hope that I have been able to instill in them, some of the values. One,\nthat I keep telling my children, my father always had something for the poor people.\nThey never were turned away and they used to come quite often to the house and to our\nstore. He taught us never to let -- let them leave without giving them something, at least -\n- no matter how small it was. I know we would walk down the street and somebody\nwould -- some of the what yo -- we call today, street people or homeless people, they\nwould be sitting on the sidewalk, they would stick their hand out and my father, like we\nwould pass there, my father would stop, take out the coin, give it to us and tell us to hand\nit to the beggar. But there was even more to that. He would -- Well, this one thing I\nremember. There was a guy that was really down and out in his luck and h-- he would\nbeg. He was an immigrant to our community, he was a Jewish young man and he didn\u2019t\ncare for begging, so my father one time suggested to him, why doesn\u2019t he buy some nuts\nand salt them and toast them and make little bags and sell them? And he did that and I\nremember our father would always buy two or three bags. He didn\u2019t like the nuts, but he\nbought them, because this was a way of supporting somebody. And only recently, I was\nreading about the life of Mimonides, the philosopher and the Jewish theologian, of the\nwhat, tw -- 12th century? He -- 12th, yeah. Anyway, and he had -- he wrote on every\nsubject conceivable and one of them was charity. And he had -- he sort of set up eight\nlevels of charity. And I know the highest level is helping somebody become independent\nand this is what my father believed in. We also believed that the children should get\nbetter education that their parents had and we -- we were sent to school, we -- wh-when\nthe war started, Jews were not allowed to go to school, and I think I mentioned that the\nprofessors, of course, couldn\u2019t teach, so what we did, we created a Jewish school. The\nprofessors that were fired from their jobs, they were employed to teach the Jewish kids\nwho were not allowed to go to school. Well, my father, he had a little misunderstanding\nwith somebody, so he didn\u2019t send us to school, but he engaged tutors to come to our\nhouse and teach us things. So, oh -- also, he was teaching us the religious subjects and we\nlearned a lot in the house. When we would go to religious school, we were always top\nstudents and like, let\u2019s say if I was in third grade, I would usually be placed with kids of\nthe fifth grade or sixth grade, because of the -- my level of knowledge of the particular\nsubject. My mother was a very, very hard working person, I guess by necessity, because\nmy father didn\u2019t work. We had the store, but he would just go there in the evening. My\nmother would go early in the morning, open up the place and she would be there all day.\nAnd in those days, you opened the store about eight o\u2019clock in the morning, you closed it\nat 12, you went home for lunch. You went at four, you re-opened and it was opened til\neight o\u2019clock. This is, I think throughout Europe, they had this. Some people call it siesta.\nIn summer, I guess, people would go home, eat, and go to sleep for a couple hours. What\nelse did we learn? We learned -- One time I found a wallet that belonged to a\nconstruction supervisor and he was ready to fire half of his staff and -- and my -- I ran\nhome with it and my father told me to go back and find who it belongs to. \u201cDon\u2019t give it\nto anybody until you\u2019re very sure that you find the rightful owner.\u201d And I remember, I\nhad looked inside, there was a lot of money in it, but the guy only gave me one dinar as a\nreward and I was pretty unhappy about it. But my father told me that the return of the\nwallet was a reward in itself. I\u2019m a little choked up now, talking about these things\nbecause it brings memories. So, maybe if you give me five minutes to get back to my\nown self, yeah?",
        "A: Well yeah, that\u2019s really what everybody in the Jewish community had done. Well, let\nme mention something like, when the war came, the food became pretty scarce. So, we\nwere lucky that we were occupied by the Italian forces. Now, what I need to mention 1s\nmaybe we skipped quite a bit here, because the war came to Yugoslavia in April, \u201841 and\nthis -- your question pertains to our leaving Split, which took place after the -- Mussolini\nfell, after the government of Italy and what they call capitulation, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, okay. No, there\u2019s n-nothing special that I needed to or wanted to add, but I was\njust trying to give it perspective, and -- well, and our departure was preceded by when the\nItalian government fell. Of course, the -- the Italian army was let go, you know. This mis\n-- the general population just rushed the -- the what do you call it, we call them kasir --\nkasirna, which is the military complex that was right in our neighborhood where the m --\nthe s-soldiers lived. Anyway, and it wa -- they had the storage of food there and\nammunition, so everybody rushed there. I was watching people carrying bags of flour\nand wheat and you know, all kinds of canned stuff. An-Anyway, so then the partisans\ncame to the surface and it was -- before that, 1t was underground. Now, there was enough\npartisans, they came from the mountain, they organized the local population and there\nwas partisan units marching through the street. If I can mention, Split was a city -- I call it\na town, but it was a city of 50,000 people. It was the biggest city in Dalmatia, the coastal\n-- coastal area and much of the interior. It was the, I guess the capital of the -- like we\nhave states, they had these -- well, there was -- Yugoslavia was subdivided into -- it\u2019s not\nkingdo -- the kingdom was the whole count -- I will have to remember this word, the\ntranslation of the word later. And -- But Split was the capital of one of these, call them\nstates, if -- until I get a better term for it. And so it was a pretty large city. I mean, I\nremember with pride, looking at the big, tall building, eight floors, nine floors, another\none, you know. So, 1-it was wide avenues, tree line avenues, you know, all that. So, the\ncity was sizable and now we saw all these -- the partisans and their insignia was a red star\nand -- on the cap it was a -- like a military cap, you know, with a red star 1n front of it.\nAnd the population started participating, and they would have these meetings, town\nmeetings and you would get maybe 5,000 people show up for the meeting and there was\nsomebody speaking about, you know, we have to arm ourselves and we have to chase the\noccupation and we\u2019re -- have to do this and that, you know. So there was a lot of\nenthusiasm.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: That 1s -- That is correct. This was like a -- maybe what, 20 day, about three weeks in\nthere, where the partisans were able to hold on to this quote, major city for the area. So,\nthat was -- was like pretty wild and also like the partisans would conduct trials of the\npeople who had collaborated and in -- there would be signs and you know, posters saying\nhow many were convicted and shot and all that. It was -- maybe it was kangaroo court\ntype, it was very swift and pretty -- I won\u2019t say brutal, but it was swift and final for many\npeople who had collaborated. It was a very sharp division. You\u2019re either with us or\nyou\u2019re with them kind of thing. So the population had committed themselves. And then\nthere was -- the German troops were trying to come into the city, but they were hel --\nthey were held in check at a place where the Turks were held in check several hundred\nyears earlier, the Ottoman empire was held, because it\u2019s such a terrain, the rough terrain,\nmountains and cliffs, that you can position yourself and you know, it was that kind of\nwarfare that people could establishing -- establish themself and prevent even motorized\nunits and tanks from advancing. So, partisans were able to hold off the German troops for\na very long time. And in those days, we were wondering what will happen if the partisans\ndon\u2019t hold the line and the Germans do come. And we didn\u2019t know -- We didn\u2019t think of\nan if, we were thinking of when, yeah. And that\u2019s -- in those days, we just did what\neverybody was aware that had to be done, namely prepare, so you can make a quick\ngetaway by whatever means. Some people were thinking of getting a little boat and going\nto the islands that were near Split. But that wasn\u2019t so safe, because Germany and\nCroatians that were armed by the Germans, the puppet government, they had better\nmeans than the partisans. Partisans were living off the support that they could get from\ngeneral population. But Germans were pretty rough if they caught somebody helping the\npartisans, they burned the entire town. And later on, I remember seeing towns, just\neverything -- no house had a roof on it, because the roof was burned, you know. The rest\nwas made out of stone, or bricks, so it couldn\u2019t burn, but 1-it was -- or, 1f maybe partisans\nwould kill a German person, the German would just take hundred at random and shoot\nthem. That -- They -- They wouldn\u2019t have to be guilty or they wouldn\u2019t have to be\npartisans or anything, just hundred citizens, or hundred men, ju -- 0-out of the town, they\nwould take them at random, put them against the wall and shoot them. So -- Okay, so we\nare in this situation where everybody\u2019s wondering -- you know, the partisans said you\nhave to be either with us or with them, and during those 20 days, lots of people said,\n\u201cWe're with the partisans.\u201d So when the Germans were coming, then all of these people\nwho had declared themselves to be with the partisans, had to find a way to leave. And the\nJewish population, of course, would be the first victims of the German onslaught. And\nGermans were bad enough, but Croatians were worse. So -- Anyway, sO we were just\ncognizant of these [indecipherable] and we were ready -- what did it take? Not much. I\nmean, it\u2019s just, like my father had a bigger backpack, I remember and he put a, you know,\na sweater, a pair of shoes, some underwear and there was some, I remember, I don\u2019t\nknow if you know what zwieback 1s? It\u2019s a hard, hard -- it\u2019s not bread, it\u2019s like a, yeah,\ncrust of some sort. Anyway, so I know he had brought that. He was in the military, the\nYugoslav military two years earlier, when it was general mobilization, so he brought a\ncouple of those zwiebacks and I remember, we tried to bite into it, impossible. So he put\nthose in his, you know, backpack and of course we put -- we all, each kid had something\nthat they made ready and after we left, my other sisters, my younger sisters, they\nremained. Oh, my older sister, she joined the partisans immediately. She was 16 at the\ntime. Yeah, here.",
        "A: In the 20 day period, yeah, but we had learned -- my parents had learned that she was\nin the underground before that. I remember when they found out about that. That was\nvery traumatic, you know, she -- well, this was like she begged them to understand\nwhat\u2019s going on. Of course they were, you know, petrified from fear. But anyway, so she\nleft in the first day or two of the partisan liberation, but the other two sisters, I remember\n-- not I remember, they keep telling us the story, how they practiced jumping from the\nsecond story window, you know, on the -- on the back of the house, to get away. But we\ndidn\u2019t do that, we -- we had these knaps -- knapsacks or backpack or whatever. We used\nto call them rucksacks, that\u2019s, I guess, the German term. Anyway, w-we left in the middle\nof the night, but we were walking out of the house, through the front door, we don\u2019t have\nto jump out of the window. And as we were leaving, so were many other -- others from\nthe city. You know, the ones who had committed themselves to the partisan cause, to the\nanti-Fascist, anti-Ustashi cause. They were all leaving the city. There was almost a major\nevacuation at the time.",
        "A: Well, she explained to them that, you know, there was in-injustice in the world and\nthat she wants to do her part. And they were saying, you know, \u201cWell, you\u2019re young and\nyou\u2019re so little and frail and what can you do wi -- to help with,\u201d and she was saying,\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mor -- everyone needs to do it. If we let them do these things to us and nobody\nresists, how can we ex-- expect to survive? The-They\u2019 ll have always an upper hand.\u201d But\nanyway, my parents were -- were terrified, because they didn\u2019t know what the future\nwould bring to her, and to us, if it\u2019s discovered. There was -- There were a few things\ngoing on, you know, like occasionally leaflets would be distributed by people like her\nand they -- also there was armed -- armed attacks on the occupation troops and I know --\nI could tell what -- something happened because next day or immediately, there would be\ncurfew imposed and even if it happened during a curfew, they just lowered the time.\nLike, in the middle of the summer, I remember curfew was nine o\u2019clock throughout the\nsummer, and then, after an event like that, was reduced to six o\u2019clock and then five and\nfour o\u2019clock in the afternoon, everybody had to be in their homes. So -- And the people,\nyou know, kids, 14 -15, were active participants in these things. I\u2019m not saying in the\narmed attack against the occupation, but leaflets distribution and I don\u2019t know the -- well,\nthey had books that they were reading that were, what\u2019s the word, you know, they were\nagainst the current regime and it -- people would be caught sometimes, doing these things\nand Italians -- I mean, they may have been less brutal than the Germans, but if they\nwould catch somebody, they were not very gentle with them. We knew of many people\nwho had gone -- who had been taken and they would send them to some prisons in\nsouthern Italy, on the island of Lipari. And they would come back with all kinds of wild\nstories, you know. And I know some people who used to tell us -- well, the mother of\nsome young men who were taken by the Italian troops or Fascists, anyway, they said that\nthey w -- they ironed their backs, you know, with the hot iron. But the -- One of the\nprevalent punishment was castor oil. Th-Th-They would force the people to drink a very\nlarge container of castor oil. I guess like maybe, if we use a measuring cup, like two cups,\nyou know, at a time. And I don\u2019t know if you can imagine the effect of castor oil, but you\nforget all your trouble -- all your other troubles when you have that. So anyway, my\nparents tried to dissuade my sister from participating and maybe she said that she\nwouldn\u2019t do it any more, but no, I know she continued in the activities, because at that\npoint, I was reaching the age where I was useful to the cause.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, okay. When -- On this crucial night, I guess, we were awakened by the\nneighbors. These were the good neighbors. They came knocking at the door, banging,\nand I remember, \u201cMr. Danon, Mr. Danon,\u201d and, \u201cthe Germans are coming.\u201d So we got\nup, took me three seconds to get dressed, my father got dressed and we grabbed our\nbackpacks, which as I mentioned earlier, were packed with whatever we thought was\nimportant and that we could carry. Excuse me. And also, my father and my mother had\nsubdivided whatever valuables they had. In those days, one didn\u2019t carry too much cash,\nbecause was losing value, so people would buy -- they called them Napoleons. It\u2019s like a\n20 dollar gold piece, it\u2019s about this size. And you -- They would sew them in the coats\nand clothes, so they thought that nobody was going to find them, you know, but\neverybody knew the -- where to find, in case they were caught by the Germans or the\nUstashis. So -- But anyway, they subdivided what they had and I said goodbye to my\nmother. I don\u2019t believe my two younger sister were up at the time. We got out of the\nhouse, it was, of course, dark. They didn\u2019t have street lights. They had them on the main\nhighway -- on the main thoroughfares, but not in our street. And we started walking\ntoward the mountains, which were not too far from Split, because we lived in the\nsuburbs. I don\u2019t know for -- if you lived in Denver, you could see how Denver 1s flat and\nthen the mountains rise up and that\u2019s how Split was. It was near the water, you know, flat\nland and then the mountains, just all at once, straight up. So we started walking in that\ndirection and little by little we heard voices and others joined us. It was a mass exodus,\nbecause others had heard the same rumor or word that the Germans were coming. So we\nkept going. In the daylight hours, we were in the mountains. There were highways, but\nthe idea was that the Germans were going to come on the highways, with their motorized\nunits, so we walked along the road -- to the side of the road, and I remember, that was\nrough. I had a good pair of shoes, because my father had just bought himself, me and my\nsis -- older sister, a pair of shoes -- didn\u2019t buy them, but he engaged a shoemaker to make\nthem for us, yeah. And they were like the ski type, you know, the mountain, the snow.\nShoes that were very well made, the best shoes I ever had. Anyway, so --",
        "A: Could be, could be. Could also be that he wanted to give a job to this one guy, who\nhad come from someplace else. See, Split was full of immigrants. The ti -- during the\nItalian occupation, Jewish immigrants. We had the community of maybe 200 people, all\nat once swell to four or 5,000. So it was the -- one of my father\u2019s characteristics of\nengaging people to -- like to coach us in -- well, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t attend the public\nschools, but Italian was a required language, so we had an Italian coach. And we also had\nmusic coach coming to the house, teaching me and my sister, my older sister. And this\nguy that did our shoes, he was also an immigrant, and all these people were immigrants.\nAnyway, so we met a lot of people along the way and then finally we got into a village\nand sat down and ate what we had. And [indecipherable] kept walking some more, until\nnight time and we and many others -- there were other men, mostly men and they were\nwalking to join the partisans. And we all did that. And finally we came to a town that was\nheld by the partisans, it was a -- like a command type of town. And we made ourselves\nknown that we want to join them, you know? And they --",
        "A: Well, because th-they saw us coming, you know. Of course, th-they were hiding. So,\nsome of them approached us and we put little signs, like a little red star, to indicate what\nwe -- what our intentions are. And they interviewed us and they said, well yeah, sure, but,\nyou know, you just go with the group. And little by little, they found odd jobs for us. And\nla -- this was the system. They never -- You never came and signed up, you just\neventually came to be accepted. So --",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t so formal, allri -- you know, step by step. Eventually, like I know at\none point, I was separated from my father. It was very common, separated and then we\nmeet again and separate. And I know I was in a place where -- well, near the coastline,\nwhere there was a couple of boats, wooden boats, you know. This is a coastal area,\nfishing towns and there was a lot of these boats. Most of them were sailboats, but small\nsails, you know, you stick the sail. You leave the boat in the water, but you take the sail\nhome and then you bring it and you sail. Some also had motors, but not many. Some\nwere rowboats, almost like the Phoenician galleys, you know. But, I remember being in\nthat town and it was night time and there was a bunch of guys. Later I learned they were\npartisans, but they sort of pretended they were fishermen. And they invited me if I\nwanted some food, they were cooking something. Wasn\u2019t beans, was -- they call it\nOurzo, but it\u2019s -- that\u2019s a f -- 1t\u2019s not a wheat, it\u2019s a form of a -- what do you call it --",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s grain, but 1t\u2019s oats, yeah. I think it\u2019s oats and the -- peeled, so.\nBut it\u2019s still taste like -- like the horses might like it, but not human beings. Anyway, so I\nremember that\u2019s what they served and that\u2019s what they ate and that\u2019s what they gave me\nsome of. And they were talking about what are they going to do next day and what --\nwhat unit of the Ustashis they were going to attack, you know. And I remember, as I\ntraveled through the mountains, like in different places that were held by the partisans,\nbig point of conversation, you know, would be -- somebody would read the\naccomplishment of some other units, someplace. This wasn\u2019t organized military, this was\njust somebody in another town had attacked Ustashi unit, or Ustashi sympathizers town\nand had burned so many houses and taken so many sheep. These were pastoral areas,\nmountains, but still, sheeps were the primary source of income. So they would say,\n\u201cOkay comrades, now what are we going to do?\u201d You know, \u201cAre we going to sit back\nand relax while our fellow comrades of other towns are doing all these big things?\u201d So\nthey would say, \u201cLet\u2019s go and attack them.\u201d Well, \u201cHow many rifles do we have? There\nis 12 of us, we have three rifles, well,\u201d you know, \u201chow much ammunition? Maybe we\ncan get some more guns,\u201d you know. So that\u2019s where they would go. Sometimes they\nwere successful, sometimes not. But anyway, so, this how we traveled for -- I don\u2019t\nvisualize right now, how many days or weeks, but we ended up -- I mean, through the\nmountains, but we ended up again, near the coastline. I was with my father. And there\nwas one of these wooden junks, was going -- everybody was getting on it, so we got on\nit. And went to one of the islands and I will give you the spelling of the name. H-v-a-r,\nHvar. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s where I spent a very major part of my time with the partisans. So\nanyway, we went there in the morning -- I mean, this was all -- everything -- movements\nare made during the night. Day is for hiding. This was the way of life. You hide during\nthe day, you move during the night. Tr-Travel, whether it\u2019s on foot or on a donkey, or a\nmule, or by one of these boats, was always by night and very quietly.",
        "A: Well, the decision to fight never entered my mind nor my father\u2019s mind. Yeah, that\nwas my older sister. We were trying to save our skins, frankly. My father, let\u2019s see, how\nold was he at the time? I would say he was 40, and he had fought in the -- this war that\nwas brought to Yugoslavia, in 1941. They had general mobilization and he -- he didn\u2019t\nhave very pleasant memories from that. I mean, he was in there long enough, but I know\nhe didn\u2019t care for the experience. And I was much too young. I was 13 years old, you\nknow. I wasn\u2019t going to fight anywhere. So we just left the town when we heard the\nGermans are coming, and there was no other place to go but the mountains. And if you\njoined the partisans, you\u2019re -- hopefully, you\u2019re with some -- some organize group.\nOtherwise, you\u2019re on your own, and how do you survive on your own in a strange town,\nyou know? And again, the general population of that area was peasant. You know, they\nlive off the land, either as shepherds or as farmers. Once you got into the mountain, there\nwas not much farming, except maybe around your house, you know. No extensive\nfarming of any kind, anywhere. In the lowlands, where I lived, they had like -- grapes\nwas the big thing. And fruit, fruit, different kind. Figs, peaches, cherries. But figs was a\nbig fruit and grapes -- many, many of the people, they live off the grapes. They -- you\nknow, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes in to this and th -- once they collect the grapes and\nsquish them for a wine. You know, st -- stomp it and whatever they do. We all have seen\nmovies how that\u2019s done. I used to see that done personally, all our neighbors were that,\nyeah. Anyway, so after that, it\u2019s nothing else to do the rest of the year. Well, anyway, so\nmy father was a city dweller, if you will, and he couldn\u2019t survive in the mountains,\namong the -- the suther way of life, you know. So, he was out of place, and I guess the\nentire Jewish community would be out of place in the rural -- well, more than rural, it\u2019s in\nthe peasant type environment, you know. Farming or sheep-herding or animal, you know,\nlife, because they were not accustomed to it. There is -- Just to dissuade anybody that --\nthat\u2019s in the Jewish genes, they proved in Israel that they can be good farmers and\neverything else. But in this type of situation, we didn\u2019t have that background. So,\nanyway, we came to the partisans to be a part of a organized society, where we could\nsurvive and of course, make our contribution, whatever is needed. And we were accepted,\nI guess. There was a place for everybody and once we got into this place on Hvar, they\nfound a place for me, too, and I was still 13 years old. I was placed in a machine shop, I\nguess. That\u2019s -- That\u2019s the best -- the best description of it. But machine shop was making\n-- well, we were repairing ammunition, we were even making some of the things for the\nmi -- for the partisans, for the military or partisans. I remember, oh there were two kids\nyounger than me in this unit. We were three kids assigned to this unit. One was 11 year\nold, and one was 12. All f -- All came from Split, similar route that we came. What we\nwere doing, actually, is generating power. It\u2019s a -- like a bicycle, you would just go, you\nknow, drive this bike, stationary bike, but would generate power for the units that they\nhad. We would fill the batteries, you know, we would do -- and we would also stoke the\novens, you know, for the -- the guy -- blacksmiths, you know. They weren\u2019t shoeing\nhorses, they were making things out of -- well, let\u2019s say the guns -- I mean the weapons\nneeded certain parts, steel part, they -- they wouldn\u2019t have it. They take a piece of steel\nand -- and by hand and hammer, you know. Get it into the [indecipherable] and just beat\nit and grind it and make the part, whatever it takes, whatever time it takes, you know.\nAnd they would fix rifles, they would fix machine guns, occasionally, you know. And I\nremember they even had a big searchlight that came to be fixed. And we, the kids were\ndoing -- even our job was making -- what the -- would you call it, it was for disinfecting\nclothes or whatever for the hospital. You take -- We would take a barrel of the -- for oil\nbarrel, split it in half -- and this was pretty heavy steel, split it in half, and finish up th --\nwith the -- I don\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t -- don\u2019t know in English how you call these things to -\n- like a file. Yeah, file it down, fix it so it doesn\u2019t scratch. Then we would take a metal\nsheet, roll it and we would make grooves on both ends, so y-you have like roll. And beat\nthe ends together, then we cut a piece for the bottom, make holes in it. So this was a\nbarrel inside the barrel and on one you would put water and the other one would hold it\nclosed, because steam gives you more heat to kill the germs. You couldn\u2019t just boil it\nbecause you only get 212 in boiling water, 212 degrees, but steam, you can really make\nit, I don\u2019t know what, 400 - 500, whatever. So this was one of the jobs that we, the kids,\ndid. But these other kids used to tell stories about how they would, before they came to\nHvar, they were engaged in real battles, Germans and the Ustashi were -- had these\nbunkers and the kids job was to sneak, crawl on the ground to the bunker and then just\nlob hand grenade into the small holes in the bunker. And they could do it very silently, so\nthey would not be detected. So the kids were useful for that, wher -- whereas grownup\nper -- person would be detected much easier, the kid knew how to wiggle his way to the\nbunker and do this kind of job.",
        "A: No, no. My sister -- First of all, partisans had to fight and run and move and all that.\nWhen we did -- We didn\u2019t know who was alive and who was not. We didn\u2019t know -- we\nleft my mother and two sisters in Split. We had no idea whether they were still alive. My\nfather, one time, was th -- I don\u2019t know whether he was trying to comfort himself, or --\nnot comfort, but whether he was just trying to be able to talk about it to somebody. He\nwas telling me how, in one of the announcements of the partisans, said how Germans had\ncaught a unit of the partisans from Split and how they -- there was some females, and\nhow they were tortured and all that stuff. And he says, \u201cYou think that your sister was\none of those girls that they\u2019re talking about?\u201d And I said I didn\u2019t know. I mean, we -- we\ndidn\u2019t -- there was no contact. Partisans -- Yugoslav partisans were all over the country,\nit\u2019s like one would not say, let\u2019s say, if somebody wa -- is in the Ame-American army,\neven today is -- maybe somebody is down Georgia and the other is in Massachusetts.\nYou know, it\u2019s same army, but no contact. You don\u2019t know who 1s who, this is war, and\nit -- they didn\u2019t have, you know, well organized, it was just scattered people and units\nand no, there was no way one could tell who was where and what and how.",
        "A: Well, I think circumstances mostly to be given credit for. I -- I take no credit for me,\nas being tenacious or organized or courageous, none of those characteristics would fit my\n-- my psyche, I guess. No, what -- what happened, we were just being swept by events\nand locations and developments as they were taking place. I mean, you make do,\nwherever you are, you do what one needs to do to survive. And I really don\u2019t feel that I\nhad any of these characteristics that you\u2019re attributing. But, my sister -- my sister Sarah,\nwho led my mother when she was nine years old, she -- she had this characteristic,\nleadership, strength of her conviction and all that. Even today, she is very forceful person\nand she can -- she can get people to tell her anything that she wants to -- out of them, you\nknow, I mean, from a strictly social or friendly perspective. No, she -- she had that\ncharacteristic, which I did not, and I still don\u2019t. No, I\u2019m, in every respect, all my life, I\nbeen low profile person. This happened to be a period of let\u2019s see, the courage was\nneeded to survive, but I can tell you some stories, within a year from this period that will\nprove to you that I was a -- what shall I say, a Milquetoast, a weenie, a weakling.",
        "A: Okay. One story. After we left Yugoslavia, we ended up in Italy and one day, I was\nwith a bunch of kids in the neighborhood. We were playing around and there was an\nopen well. So one of the kids had dropped a stick in the well, and I saw it floating. The\nwell didn\u2019t look too deep, the water level was way up, so -- and it was floating. So I\ndecided that I could recover the stick for this young man -- young man, kid, maybe 10 -\n11 years old. So, the well had a little retaining wall around the hole and there was a little\nhole at the bottom of the retaining wall, I think it was intended as a drainage. After the\nrain, the water would go into the well. I didn\u2019t know the principles of how the water gets\ninto the well, but \u2019m now debating it. Anyway, so from -- I put one of my legs in this\nretaining wall and the other I straddle the retaining wall, and I put another leg -- another\nfoot into the hole and I held myself with one hand on the retaining wall, while with the\nother one I tried to reach. Well, this hole in the retaining wall got slippery. There was\nmoss or s-something, some green groth -- growth on it. Anyway, my foot slipped and I\nended up hanging by one hand, with my body inside the well, hanging. And I held, first I\nheld for the dear life, with my fingers, and there was -- I couldn\u2019t hold with the whole\nhand, I just was hanging on by the four fingers and it got very painful and in my mind,\nvery quickly, I decided this was too painful. If I let go, I might drown, but what the heck,\nit\u2019s less painful than holding on, and -- because my fingers were breaking and the pain\nwas excruciating. So I let go. Luckily, the well wasn\u2019t too deep. It was a wide well,\nwasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t a real type of well, was just a water collection poin --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Anyway, the story, it\u2019s a little bit long story. The kids went yelling, \u201cMike fell in the\nwa -- in the well,\u201d and then my father came running much later. By that time, I was\nalready pulled out by somebody else, and he was -- he thought that I had drowned. But,\naside from that, 1t proves that I cannot tolerate pain, and I rather just find the easy way\nout of any situation. But, so tha -- there goes my [indecipherable] was shattered.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Yeah. Their end was pretty swift. They were taken and they were sent to a\nextermination camp in Croatia called Yasinovats. Yasinovats was a killing field, like\nAuschwitz and Dachau and all that. And, as we speak, there is a guy that was in charge of\nthat camp. He had a happy life in Argentina, I believe -- is it Argentina? Anyway, he was\njust recently sent to Croatia for trial, but who is going to try him but the same kind of\npeople that were in charge then, his buddies? So I\u2019m sure he will come out smelling like\na rose, because they already named streets for him as a hero, and all that. So, y-you know",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure of his name, something like Savage or Sabage, I\u2019m not sure right now,\nbut this is very recent. In fact, I\u2019m sure that the Holocaust Memorial Museum, or\nwhatever unit, would have that information, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: [indecipherable] city. Yeah, I can tell you, sure, what happened. We didn\u2019t own the\nhouse, we rented. The house was owned -- we -- the house where we lived, was owned\nby a guy who had immigrated to United States, worked here in the steel mills and send\nmoney to, quote, the old country. And of course, the money had higher value here. I\u2019m\nsure everybody knows the story. People would come from Europe, live, 15 - 20 of them\nin the same -- not room, but in the same apartment, work all kinds of hours, not spend\nany money on food. Everything they could save was going back to where they came\nfrom. And when they would go back there, they were rich people, or at least their\nfamilies were pretty rich. They would buy real estate. This guy bought couple of\nvineyards and he had two houses, which he was renting. Anyway, we had second floor,\nin the -- like ground floor. They call -- We called it basement and ours was called\nmezzanine, but it\u2019s first and second floor, and then there was a third. In the ground floor\nlived an old man. His wife had died while I was young. He had seven sons and three\ndaughters and he came with us to the partisans. He was a very old guy, but he was a wiry\nman, yelling at everybody, \u201cI have seven sons and two grandchildren in the partisans.\u201d\nAnd so, he -- th-th -- a -- the daughter was date -- one of the daughters was dating a\nItalian lieutenant, so I don\u2019t know what happened to them, but I -- people living above us,\nthey were Ustashis, so when we left, I\u2019m sure they had a picnic 1n our place. We had a lot\nof food that we -- my father was able to buy because, in our store -- since money was\nlosing value, lots of things were bought and sold on basis of barter -- barter. You know,\nso people would barter things, like farmers would bring some of their foodstuffs to trade\nfor the -- what they used to call -- before the war, clothes that we -- some of the stuff that\nwe couldn\u2019t sell before the war, was now in demand. It was a reject before, 1t wasn\u2019t\nmodern, wasn\u2019t anything, was leftovers. They would say, you know, \u201cI want some of that\nstuff.\u201d So we had, I guess a lot of stuff that wasn\u2019t selling before, so this became in\ndemand, because it was still the good kind of material, not the war goods, which was\nmade -- they used to say that it was made from wood. You know, it -- you soak it and\nwould fall apart. Anyway, so we had a lot of food in the house and I\u2019m sure the people\nfrom upstairs, they took it all. And the street there, that was across th -- from us, were the\npeople who came and told us that the Germans are coming. And then there was a few\nothers that -- my middle sister, Sarah, she was friendly with a girl there, and she went to\nvisit her, recently. The place was still there, the same, everything -- nothing has changed,\nyou know. Th-This was in the suburbs. The houses were built of stone and cement and\nconcrete, so this was expected to, you know, stay up like that for hundreds of years,\nunless the sa -- somebody bombs it, you know, and that wasn\u2019t the case. So the -- the area\nis still the same, she told me -- my sister told me she recognized rosemarie that it was\ngrowing along the edges there and she went -- you know, knocked on the -- the house,\nand she introduced herself and, \u201cOh, come on in, yeah, you remember so and so,\u201d and oh,\nlots of reminiscing and she stayed for a meal with them. So, you know, the area is still the\nsame and everybody just got married, had kids and their kids had kids. And the life goes\non, in this area and I guess every other area in Split, and the suburbs.",
        "A: My paternal grandparents, they were taken by the Germans. Actually wasn\u2019t -- may\nnot have been Germans, but it was the Croatians took over in that area, the Ustashi, and\nthe Moslems. And I have no special likes for Moslems, because they all, en masse, joined\nthe Ustashi in Bosnia. And you know, now that there was war in Bosnia and I was very\nunhappy with the United States support of those people who were the killers during\nWorld War Two. And the same people are still -- they are a little bit older, but they are\nstill there in charge and their philosophy of life is still the same one, so --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: My father figured out how many of his relatives in -- how many in his immediate\nfamily perished when the Germans came into Yugoslavia and this happened in 1941,\nearly April in 1941. His parents were taken. He had, let\u2019s see, I think he had six brothers.\nSo there were seven men, yeah. I know -- I didn\u2019t know too many, because we didn\u2019t live\nthere and I only visited once and some of his brothers never came to visit us, so I -- I met\nsome. Some were in Sarajevo itself and some were in the suburbs in the little town where\nhe was born. They remained there. But most of them had moved to Sarajevo. And they\nand -- they were all married, their families, their sons and daughters, they were all taken,\nwith Germans. My father counted 28 total that had been taken, including his parents, and",
        "A: They were taken away and one doesn\u2019t know where. But that was the end. You know,\nthe story, if you watch \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d or if you -- there was a movie I just saw a\ncouple of weeks ago, the \u201cLife is Beautiful,\u201d and it\u2019s playing in the local theaters. It\u2019s an\nItalian movie, with English subtitles. It shows how they\u2019re taken and put in these boxcars.\nAt the museum, you have some of these boxcars. They put them, you know, how many\npeople they can squeeze in, and they close and it goes and the -- there\u2019s no record. But\nmost of the Yugoslav Jews were taken -- most of the ones in Sarajevo and our area, in\nBosnia and Croatia, those areas, were sent to Yasinovats. That\u2019s this camp that I\nmentioned earlier, and never heard from them aft -- after that.",
        "A: Well, 1 -- I told the story how my father and I, although we went to Italy separately,\nbut we met there. And we were placed by the British, in a town in Italy called Santa\nMaria. This was the beaches with the villas, which were owned by, I guess northern\nItalian, or people from all over the world, maybe, but were occupied only in the season.\nSo this happened to be winter and happened to be war and the occupying powers needed\nthe facilities so they took all these villas and they put us in there. What we had was -- I\ndon\u2019t know if I mentioned that the partisans were sort of -- let me -- let me take a step\nback.",
        "A: The allies were trying to mislead the Germans into thinking that the second front\nwould be fought on that area, the Dalmatian coast, that that\u2019s where they were going to\nmake the invasion. In other words, they had -- allies had occupied Sicily and they landed\non the boot of Italy and they had gone up a little bit, but they couldn\u2019t go too far up, so\nthere was a lot of talk about second front. And the Russians, of course, they had a big\nfront, what 3,000 miles of front line and they were demanding that the a-allies, meaning\nBritish and Americans open the -- a new front, to take some of the load from the Russian\nfront. And the allies were doing this propaganda kind of thing, saying that they are\nplanning a landing on the Dalmatian coast. Split was the capital of Dalmatia. And they\nwould drop leaflets sometimes, telling the people to leave. So lots of civilians were\nleaving those areas and they were finding their way to the islands, where they were\npicked up by the allies, by British, actually, and taken to Italy. And Italy was temporary\nlocation, then they would take them to Egypt, where they would stay in the -- under the\ntents -- yeah, that was tent city. I remember the name was EI Shot. Anyway, and when\nour turn came to go to this place in Egypt, my father panicked, he says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to\nthe Sahara,\u201d you know, or whatever. So we were told, \u201cGet ready, everybody.\u201d It was --\nThere\u2019s a Yugoslav word for totality of escapees, like evacuation number one, evacuation\nnumber two. We were in one of these evacuation units, strictly civilian. So, when it came\ntime for our evacuation unit to go to El Shot in Egypt, my father woke me up one\nmorning, he says, \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of here.\u201d So we engaged somebody to take us to the\ntrain station, not in this town, the nearest town with a train. And we got on the train. I\nsaid we engaged somebody, somebody who had horse and wagon. He agreed to take us.\nAnd we went to this town -- Italian city, called Lecce, L-e-c-c-e-r -- L-e-c-c-e. Anyway,\nSO We were -- we were going to go to Barre, because Barre was the center of all these\nYugoslav escapees. But, the wa -- the train that we took to Lecce, we had to transfer there\nto another train going to Barre, but the Barre train had already left, so we had to find a\nway to spend the night there, spend the day and the night. And early in the morning, the\nfollowing day, to get up and go to the train station and board the train to Barre. Well, my\nfather could never get up early enough so we stayed that day and okay, well we\u2019ll go next\nday, we didn\u2019t wake up in time. Well, the next day we didn\u2019t wake up, and anyway, so\nwe ended up staying in Lecce. We rented a room in a house, first with somebody who\nwas renting beds for American GI\u2019s who would party too much and couldn\u2019t make it to a\nhotel or to their own rooms, so they would sleep there. Anyway, I remember, was a dollar\na night. No, not dollar, I\u2019m sorry, hundred lire, which was equivalent to a dollar. But\nanyway, So we stayed there for maybe a month, and then we found them -- place by the\nmonth, and we lived in Lecce. But my two aunts were still 1n the other area, where the\nYugoslav immigr -- immigrants were put by the British. And they were in the -- they\nwere placed in one of these villas, but because the British were trying to accommodate\npeople, if you had friends and you wanted all to be in the same villa, they let you do it. If\nyou didn\u2019t have enough friends to fill the villa, then they would fill the rest of it for you.\nWell here, there was 40 people who found each other. They were all Sephardic Jews from\nBosnia and they -- some knew each other from before, some became good friends in the -\n- all this, you know, living in the tran -- in transit, moving around and all that. They\nbecame good friends. So they we -- were put in this one villa together and life was good\nfor them, that place. My two aunts were among them. Two aunts and an uncle, one\nhusband of one of the aunts. Anyway -- I\u2019m sorry, and their daughter. They had three\ndaughters. Two were in the partisans and one was with them. So, they were there in -- in\nthis -- Santa Maria was where we were, but next door to it was another village -- a bunch\nof villas put together, called Santa Croce, which is where they were. And they enjoyed\nlife there, I know, because my aunts were all good cooks -- down, down, down -- my\naunts were all good cooks and they volunteered to be cooks over there and like they\nwould get -- down -- they would get food from the military, you know, they would get\nflour, and dried potatoes -- diced potatoes in cans. This was how the military would give\nto it\u2019s kitchens. And when we were living in -- with the peasants -- with the local -- I\nmean, local, from Dalmatian, you know, from the -- when I say peasant, this is not a\nderogatory term, it\u2019s a people who live off the land, who tilled the land or are shepherds,\nor are involved in agriculture. So, they -- when we were with them, they would cook the\nmeals, three meals a day, where the flour would be made into paste, and then they would\nput bacon, which they got from the military and some of these dried potatoes and this was\nall made into a mush, and there would be -- there would be our morning meal, our noon\nand our evening meal. Well, this Jewish house, they -- from the flour, they would make\npasta, different kind of pasta and I learned how to make pasta myself. You know, it\u2019s\nreally, as a kid, it was fun. And the bacon, because none of us ate it, was swapped with\nItalians to -- agricultural areas there, Italian, they loved the stuff, so they would give them\noil. There was a lot of olives there and oil was a product of the local area. They would\ngive them oil, they would give them green vegetables, onions, and you know, stuff like\nthat. So I remember when we would come and visit my aunt, like you would get -- I\nmean you eat pasta, you eat fresh vegetables. And they made friends with some\nAmerican flyers, you know, Air Force officers who were also -- many were from\nYugoslavia, because some of the -- from the Yugoslav Royal Air Force, had escaped to\nLondon and they were trained to fly US planes, you know. And there was a lot of them\nnearby, so that they had an opportunity to come and visit civilians and talk in their\nlanguage, yeah. And they would sometimes bring their buddies from the American flyers,\nyou know, who were not of Yugoslav extraction. And it was fun. And they would bring\ncorned beef cans, you know. And sometimes, like when I would go visit, I mean, you\nhave hamburgers, th-they would make, from the corned beef, they would make\nhamburgers and you have pasta and you have cauliflower or spinach. I said, \u201cHey, this 1s\nlike pre-war food.\u201d And they would -- Instead of this mush, you know? So you --\nAnyway, that\u2019s where my aunts lived and my uncle lived in Barre. There was a camp\nthere, I think I mentioned a lot about.",
        "A: Yeah, okay, and that was the first stop where the Yugoslavs would be going, usually.\nThe ships would go to Barre, the British ships. So one time, my aunt and my cousin from\nthis Santa Croce -- oh, they would come visit us often, and we would go visit them, just\nyou know, maintaining family contact. But one time they came and they said, \u201cWell, we\nwant a tip.\u201d That\u2019s a tip, they use a Turkish word, means, when you have -- when you\u2019re\nbearer of good news, you\u2019re supposed to give something like a prize or a tip. \u201cWhat is\nit?\u201d They\u2019re saying, your mother -- my mother, my father\u2019s wife, they came to Barre with\nthe two girls. And that\u2019s how we found out. So my uncle, he told my wa -- my mother\nand my sisters that we were in Lecce, and he -- they went to -- to the authority, the British\nand told them about it, you know. And they contacted us, they put them on the train, to\nthe other place, where my aunts were, and they all came one day. I mean, within -- within\na week, but by that time, we had already signed up to come to the United -- into United\nStates. Stop it for a minute. Anyway, so my mother and my two sisters came and life\ncontinued with them. Yeah?",
        "A: You know, that\u2019s the problem, that -- I like to describe it, but I just don\u2019t have it in my\nmemory unit. It\u2019s not there. I\u2019m trying to retrieve it, it\u2019s not. All I remember is the second\nday, I took my sisters on the town. And I remember -- well, I had some money and I took\nthem to an ice cream place. In Italy, like in Yugoslavia and throughout Europe, outdoor\ncafes were very popular. So there was this one outdoor cafe where we used to go hang\nout, and my father and me and all our friends would meet there. It was called Chinchin, I\nremember that, na -- yeah, anyway, I took them there and I ordered special ice cream. It\u2019s\ncalled, in Italian, it\u2019s called cassati. It\u2019s a frozen round thing and you cut pieces and then\nyou put whipped cream on top. Anyway, during the war, this was a big thing. And I\nremember, I ordered for them and me and I guess their stomach was not used to it, so\nboth of the gi -- my sisters got sick from that.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: They both got sick, I remember that part. And then the next big thing was getting on\nthe -- the manifest to go to United States with us. They came -- This was in June, near the\nend of June. Dates escape me right now, but I know we were preparing to go to United\nStates in July and I remember about sixth of July is when we left. So they didn\u2019t have too\nmuch time, they were with us in Lecce for about six, seven, eight days, no longer than\nthat. And again, this was war conditions and we all heard about bureaucracy, how it\nmoves very slowly. This is one time where bureaucracy moved fast and we were able to\nput them on the manifest to come over to United States with us. Of course, if they\ncouldn\u2019t, we would have just pulled out, but there was the law that was passed, was\nauthorizing 1,000 refugees. And I know must have been tens of thousands, maybe even\nlarger numbers that applied, so this was something special if you were approved. So, the\nfact that they recognized the family, this was to their credit. And I remember on July\n10th, we left -- we boarded military trucks and we left and -- toward Naples, where the\nship was going to take us to United States. And so, I didn\u2019t have too much time with my\nsisters, you know, being by ourselves, but once we got on that transport, we went to a --\noh, 1-1t was an abandoned, what do you call it, insane asylum, where they put us -- this\nwas our not only delousing station, but we received all kinds of shots and you know,\ntests, medical exams and all that, to see whether we are fit to go to United States. We\nspent three days, and I know I spend it with new friends that I had met. I was like -- I -- I\nstill was not 14 at the time. I mean, let\u2019s see, this was -- oh, I guess I was 14 already,\nthen. Yeah, and anyway, I spend it with other boys my age and I saw my sister, she made\na lot of friends -- my older sister. I don\u2019t remember my younger sister, because she was\nwith the children. But we were pretty extroverted at the time, and we made lots of friends\namong our own age group, so I know we didn\u2019t spend it as a family unit.",
        "A: No. At my age, I don\u2019t think I spent too much time dwelling on safely or anything\nelse, I just lived my life from day to day, having fun in wherever I could find it. When I\nlived in Lecce, I befriended, or I was befriended by a very large number of boys my age,\nand I met their families and we used to roam the streets and I even took up smoking. I\nwas able to get cigarettes when nobody else was, so that wa -- I was the big man on the\ncampus in that time. I quit smoking when my father caught me -- caught smoking. He\ndidn\u2019t do anything, he says, \u201cOh, you\u2019re smoking now, congratulations.\u201d That was it,\nyeah, that ended my smoking career. But anyway, no, I -- I don\u2019t think that I could tell\nyou when I started thinking of safety or security, you know. Because even under the\nworst conditions in the partisans, we were just doing what came naturally under the\ncircumstances without too much thinking.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t. Pl tell you why. My mother was non-communicative a -- when it comes to\npersonal stuff and I spend time with my father. My father, I have to say something bad\nabout him. He was the -- from the old school, where the father was the lord and master,\nthe husband, you know. He was all powerful and we had no rights whatsoever, except\nwhatever he, by his own grace, bestowed on us. Well, so we didn\u2019t have too many close\nrelations with him, except that we didn\u2019t get allowance, so -- but we -- when we would go\nfor a walk, he was the one who would say, \u201cYou guys want an ice cream?\u201d If he was so\nmoved, you know, or something like that. So we tended to hang with him, you know,\nhang by his -- on his arm, at the expense of our mother, who -- who was working all the\ntime, and couldn\u2019t spend time with us. So, I don\u2019t know if their relationship between each\nother, you know, and there was not too much affection displayed, either between them, or\nbetween us, among us kids, cause we didn\u2019t know how to express it. We learned it later. I\nthink I learned it from my younger sister, the affection, you know? But, no, I just cannot\nsay anything about that, because that was not out in the open.",
        "A: Okay, well, let me tell you. When we were in the partisans, we -- 1f we marched, I was\nusually ahead in the marching line. He -- He had more problems, physical problems, than\nI did. Then, when we were assigned to different -- to the units, he was in charge of the\nsupplies. He was like a supply sergeant and I was in the machine shop. We spend an\nawful lot of time in the machine shop, from morning til night. We\u2019d come to meals,\nsometimes I would see my father then, sometimes I wouldn\u2019t. I would see him at night.\nSince there was no lights, we burned the kerosene. Home made lamp, that was the way of\nlight, because during the war, it was the situation where you didn\u2019t have -- even if there\nwas electricity, 1t was either bombed out, or they didn\u2019t have the oil to burn it so they can\ngenerate electricity or whatever. Coal, whatever was used. And it was small place, so\neverybody had these kerosene lamps and they were put out very early in the night. You\nonly burned them when you had to. So, it was sleeping time and get up early in the\nmorning and go to work. And we had our own individual functions. In Italy, after we\ncame to Lecce, my father -- this a funny -- not a funny s -- well, it\u2019s a funny story, but as\na result of this funny story, and I'll tell you about it if you care to hear it, my father got a\njob as acensor. This is the military censorship. They would, the Post Office -- every\nletter was opened, read, regardless of what the language was written in, and they either\ncut it out or blackened the parts that they didn\u2019t want to remain there. So my father had\nthe job and I was roaming the street with my new f -- new found friends and life was\nbeautiful and it did not center around my father. We -- I mean, we didn\u2019t have especially\nclose relations, we didn\u2019t have antagonistic relations, just how was your day, okay, I\nwould -- I even would sometimes attempt cooking, you know, so when he would come\nhome, we would have a meal. We lived with a family, an older lady and her adopted\ndaughter and I would help them -- help the older lady in the kitchen sometimes, because\nwe would sometimes provide the food for them. So, I guess they would let me make the\nhamburgers, because the meat would come out of cans -- corned beef cans that I had\nbought or traded or something. So, like I said, I wasn\u2019t too close th -- in contact with my\nfather. But how my father got this job, was one time we were on the street walking and\nthere was a guy whispering behind us, and -- whispering with somebody and they were\nfollowing a couple of American officers and they were -- one was listening to what\nthey\u2019re saying and he would interpret it to the other guy, and I nudged my father, and I\nsaid, \u201cLook, I think their spies. They\u2019re trying to hear whatever the American fly boys --\nAmerican Air Force officers tell them about where they are going to bomb, or what they\ndestroyed, or whatever, and then he tells the other guy.\u201d So, I -- I told my father. So we --\nmy father and I decided to follow this one guy. So anyway, we followed them -- these\ntwo guys, we followed them and then one guy went in a -- what do you call those? It\u2019s\nlike a coach, horse and buggy thing, but it\u2019s like the kind that they have in New York,\naround Columbus area.",
        "A: A carriage type, real fancy ones. That was the means of transportation. So he went in\none end, we say -- we went to another one, \u201cFollow that carriage,\u201d you know. Like in the",
        "A: -- the movies, yeah, gangster movies. And we did that and then when he came out, we\nstopped and he saw that we were following us, so he came over and he wanted to know\nwhat\u2019s going on, and we tried to deny it, and anyway, we saw where he went in, what\nhouse. So we -- I knew who the British officers were, I knew one of them from this\nChinchin restaurant. And I had seen them -- seen him in an office someplace, through the\nwindow I saw the guy. So I said, \u201cI bet you , if we go to them and tell them about it.\u201d So\nwe went and told them, and they said, \u201cUh-huh, uh-huh.\u201d They -- I thought they were like\nIntelligence Service, you know. Anyway, so, about six days later, they came to us and\nthey said, \u201cOkay, would you like to work for us?\u201d To my father. So --",
        "A: -- that we\u2019re --",
        "A: -- enterprising yes, but we also proved that we are on the side of the allies, yeah. We\nare, yeah, creditable, you know, citizens, or whatever. Anyway, so that\u2019s how come my\nfather was working at this censorship office. Yeah?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Quantum jump, yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: A typical day, after the first two months that we were there, a typical day, yes. For one\nthing, we came to Oswego, Fort Ontario, August fourth, 1944. This was summertime, so\nsummer is a fun time, but in -- come September and kids have to go to school. So we\nwere signed up in the local school. We were interviewed and assigned to a grade. And\nfrankly, I think unfairly in some cases, because the selection was made on basis of our\nknowledge of English language, I didn\u2019t know any English, so I was put in seventh\ngrade, even though I was 14 years old. But, you know, people who spoke English, some\nof my friends, too, were sent to local high school. So I felt a little bit of a -- not\nresentment, but that I was set back unfairly. But, thinking back, all I had from the\nYugoslavia, was -- like I had completed four years of schooling, and a portion of the fifth\nyear, which in our case was gymnasium. So they put me in seventh grade, lower seventh,\nth -- you start with seven A, then you go to seven B, eight A to eight B, so -- so they put\nme in seventh grade. Anyway, a typical day would be, you get up, you eat breakfast in\nthe communal kitchens. We had -- thousand people were assigned to three kitchens, three\ncommunity kitchens. You eat breakfast, after breakfast, you start walking toward the\nmain gate. You usually -- during breakfast time, you meet some of your fellow walkers to\nthe school that we went to, was couple miles, I would say maybe three, four miles from\nthe camp. You go out the camp, you sign out. There\u2019s a guard -- we used to call them\npolicemen, because they had a police uniform. There\u2019s a guard, he watches you sign in\nand me and my friends would go to school. The school would start, I believe about eight\n15 or so, would be over by 11:30. We would go back to camp for lunch, back to the\ncommunity kitchens, have lunch, back to school for the afternoon session. Yeah, it was, I\nguess, like here, except here schools, you have lunch period and you have lunch rooms.\nWe didn\u2019t have lunch rooms, this was -- this was called junior high school, I guess, and\neven if we did, we just didn\u2019t carry lunches. We -- I don\u2019t think they would let us carry it,\nbecause that was reserved for those who traveled long distances, and we had, within\ncouple of miles, our own facilities. And there was an hour and a half or so for lunch,\nmaybe even longer. So, you know, it -- we were pressed for time. Anyway, we would\ncome home and we were in the military -- formerly military camp, which had all kinds of\nsports facilities. I mean, you know, running track, field, and we had organized our own\nclubs. We had taken old supply rooms and converted them to clubs, you know. Our --\nAnd we had Ping Pong, that was a biggy for us, playing Ping Pong the whole afternoon.\nThe schools didn\u2019t give us homework, which was unusual for us, we were used to\nEuropean style, where you get a lot of homework. Anyway, so, play Ping Pong, then go\nto supper. Usually, during the lunch hour and supper, there would be somebody\nannouncing what\u2019s taking place, in the evening, there\u2019s usually a movie. We would get\nsome real nice movies. I don\u2019t know whether the camp administration would buy them,\nor this was donated or whatever. We\u2019d get movies. They had people, the camp organized\ntheatrical groups. There was always something going on. If it\u2019s not movie, it\u2019s a play, if\nit\u2019s not a play, it\u2019s some kind of discussion, debates, our club, we had youth clubs, we\nhad our own personal clubs, that -- Yugoslav youth. There was newspaper, magazines.\nBut just hanging out, going to the canteen, which is -- there were -- the-they sold ice\ncream and stuff like that. You know, the kids like that. And, when came winter month,\nwell -- I forgot something. They had a unit of Quakers that came -- well, Quakers,\nFriend\u2019s service, whatever. It\u2019s a religious group.",
        "A: Yeah, but it\u2019s -- was sponsored by qu -- Quakers, but they were like social -- social\nservice and they would help us organize games and do things. Like one of them was in\ncharge of Girl Scouts. My sisters keeps talking about how -- all the activities they did as\nGirl Scouts. Another one would get the grown-ups to -- for sing-a-long and play games\nand you know, different things. And this one was sort of helping us -- I guess teenagers,\nyounger teenagers and she one time helped us build a skating rink. We did it -- We got a\nshuf -- shovels from the department of sanitation, I want to say, but you know, garbage\ncollectors. We got shovels, we got wood from the carpentry office so-someplace in the ca\n-- within the camp. And we just dug wherever we could, you know, made it flat and put\nthe boards along and we flooded it, and sure enough, it froze. Not very evenly, but it was\na Skating rink, and you know, anybody who could get skates and a bunch of brooms to\nguide yourself so you won\u2019t fall.",
        "A: Brooms, it\u2019s like skis, you know, handles, you know? That\u2019s what I was doing. Some\npeople knew how to skate well, but I had to use two brooms, yeah. Anyway, so activities\nwere just plentiful. Food was absolutely fantastic. Good, plenty. That was one of the\nthings that the grown-ups that were there, you know, many of them, especially my\nparents, they thought that life had settled for them. This is manna from the sky, we\u2019re\ngoing to live like this forever. No worries, everything is going to be provided. And when\nwe left camp, they had a, you know, a rude awakening, but during the life in camp, was\ngood for them. And I know my mother kept remembering how life was terrific and just a\nbig change from whatever they did, whatever was taking place before, when we came to\ncamp. Yeah?",
        "A: Well, there was a lot of different opinions. A lot of people had relatives here in United\nStates, especially, many of them, in New York, and they wanted to rejoin their relatives.\nSome people had relatives left in other parts of the coun -- of Europe, and they didn\u2019t\nknow what was going on, so they wanted to go back. But needless to say, that when the\ngates sort of opened, and we had to leave camp -- well, the camp, Fort Ontario, not too\nmany wanted to go back. There was a first -- first time when they said, \u201cWho wants to go\nback? Now is the time to do it.\u201d Only 13 people went back. Second time was a few more.\nMy aunt -- One of my aunts and her husband and the daughter, they went back, because\nthey had two other children that -- they learned about their survival and just so happened\nthat both of their daughters were -- they had distinguished themselves, you know, in the\nwar, both with the partisans and later, the civil administration. So -- And this aunt and\nuncle of mine, their family, they were so close, you ask me about my parents, how close\nthey were and I couldn\u2019t tell you, but I can tell you about this aunt and uncle. They were\nalways -- I mean, they displayed their affections to each other and both the parents and\nthe children. They were really close, the family. So --",
        "A: Their name -- It was my mother\u2019s oldest sister. Her name was Bukeetsa, which means\nfirst born. And she married this man, his name was Joseph and their last name was\nMonteelio. You might -- You might be surprised, all these names, they sound Italian, my\nmother\u2019s name, Kabiljo, Monteelio. They did have Italian names. They came, evidently,\nthrough some of the Italian areas, but what I was going to say, there\u2019s a lot of Sephardic\nnames that sound Italian, that the Jews in these areas were -- Sephards are very few and\nfar between. They wonder, what was it -- What was your name before you changed it?\nWell, it was the same, you know, it just -- different names. Anyway, so there was, if you\nread this book, \u201cThe Haven,\u201d this lady, Ruth Gruber.",
        "A: Ruth Gruber, she describes about all the political gyrations that took place during the\ntime, which were not within my knowledge, because I didn\u2019t dwell on them.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Well, we had my older sister, we found out where she was and all that. And we -- we\nwere thinking of bringing her over here instead of us going there. So we didn\u2019t even\nentertain a thought of going back, if we could remain here.",
        "A: My father didn\u2019t know anything about his parents. He assumed that they were dead\nimmediately after they were taken and he was saying the memorial prayers for them,\nright away, I mean.",
        "A: Well, 1-immigrants were coming o -- you know, s -- some who were able to escape\nand they\u2019d come -- everybody was coming to Split, if they could, from other parts. If you\nenvision Yugoslavia the way it was and here is one little, coastal sliver, that swa --\noccupied by Italians, and the word gets around that you can survive there, everybody tries\nto go there, no matter what -- what -- no matter what the cost. So, lots of people came to\nItalian held areas and they talk about \u201cYeah, I saw your parents being taken,\u201d you know,\nand all that. And -- Or people say, \u201cAnybody left?\u201d \u201cNo, nobody left,\u201d of the Jewish\ncommunities, here, there, you know, so that was pretty well known.",
        "A: No, no, he -- he thought -- I guess this is what he had, a premonition that they died,\ncertain day and that\u2019s how he a-assumed and he -- th-that day, he decided they died, yeah.\nThis was, I guess he needed it, you know, to what we -- what do we call here, closure, or\nsomething, yeah, in today-speak, you know.",
        "A: Well, you know, this was the big thing, when newspeople came to interview us, all\nover -- I mean, New York Times said there was a lady a-and she asked, \u201cWhat do you\nlike about the camp? And is there anything ya -- what did -- don\u2019t you like?\u201d And then\nshe quoted us yelling the word for barbed wire, is zhitsa, and says -- she quotes, \u201cZhitsa,\nthey all yelled in unison,\u201d you know. No, this is a rebellious spirit in a teenager. You\nknow, somebody\u2019s trying to chain me, and that was it, but aside from not being able to go\ninto town, except later, they allowed us so many visits or -- within such a radius of 20\nmiles and special dispensation to go to Syracuse, which was maybe 30 miles, you know.\nNo, there was nothing. Even the quote zhitsa, didn\u2019t bother us that much. Life was pretty\nsmooth. No matter -- If I think, in retrospect, wherever I was, wh-wherever I might have\nbeen, I watch today\u2019s youth, you know, I had everything there, we all did. No, absolutely,\nthere was no complaints, except the psychological first impression to a rebellious\nteenager, you know, that when you see a fence around you. So that was not a problem.",
        "A: No, we were not aware of the internment of the Japanese Americans until much later,\nyeah, when we learned, you know, in our history, after we were released from the camp.\nBut the only reason I mention it, is because I wanted to convey to whoever I was talking\nto, that this was the administration that was in charge of us, the very same one that was in\ncharge of the Japanese, and I -- my guess was going to be that they -- the Japanese were -\n- Japanese Americans were treated just as well as we were. I couldn\u2019t see any reason why\nthey wouldn\u2019t ha-have been. But, basically, 1t was the same administration, was called\nWar Relocation Authority. And then for us, they had a separate segment, it was called\nemergency refugee center, Oswego, New York. But it was the same administration. You\nknow, they had the same machinery in motion. So, that\u2019s the only reason I mentioned it,\nyeah.\n-- and tell us some of the things that happened right before you left, and -- and sort of\ntake us through that.",
        "A: Well, what happened to us was, I mean, we had to leave and we all left. We were sent\nto New York. But before that, there was a group that had sponsored us. The United States\ngovernment was not allowing, in those days, of free entry to the people who sought\nimmigration to the United States. They wanted somebody to put a bond, monitor a bond,\nto guarantee that we would not become a public charge. So this organization, the Jewish\norganization called Jewish American Joint Distribution Committee, put the funding -- in\nother words, they guarantee that -- they guarantee that we would not become a public\ncharge. So, what they were trying to do is, people who are leaving the camp, they were\ntrying to disperse them, so they wouldn\u2019t all go to New York, because they had the\nmechanism to take care of people, but not if they all go to the same place, because that\u2019s\na big burden on one location. So, they interviewed everybody and they convinced my\nparents to go to Philadelphia. They told them what a great place it is, and in Philadelphia,\nthere is a Sephardic synagogue, which is on the historic sites today, but it was the second\nsynagogue in the United States. Now, the first one was on the Cape -- I\u2019m sorry, first one\nwas in Newport, Connectic -- Newport, Rhode Island, yeah. It\u2019s called su -- Truro\nsynagogue, same as a town on the Cape, so strike that out, yeah. But anyway, in -- in\nPhiladelphia, there is a synagogue where George Washington had visited there, yeah, so\nthey talked to us about history, you know, and that, \u201cYou will be welcome there,\u201d and all\nthat. Okay, so my father wen -- okay. Some of our friends went to Baltimore, be -- this\none guy told us later, he agreed to go to Baltimore, because Baltimore, that part, more, m-\nO-r-e, means sea in Serbo-Croatian, so he thought he would going to be near the sea.\nWell, close enough, but not exactly. Anyway, so different people went to different places,\nbut I would say not too many went to Omaha, Nebraska, or you know, Caspar, Wyoming\nor something. Still, 1t was either LA, Chicago or New York, Philadelphia area. So, when\nwe left the camp, we had to go someplace, because we were under the quota and\nYugoslav quota was not very large, like maybe six a year or something. But, I think my\nparents, because they were born in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which at the time they were born,\nwas under the Austro-Hungary empire, I think they put them under Austrian quota, which\nwas much larger. So -- Still, they decided to close the camp in January and everybody\nhad to be out. Well --",
        "A: January 1945. I\u2019m sorry, \u201846. Oh, how time flies. 1946. We came in *44, and we were\nthere a year and a half. August \u201844, to -- okay. So, in January, they were closing the camp\nand everybody had to leave, so we were taken or shipped to New York, and we stayed at\nthe place which was run by an organization called HIAS. It\u2019s an acronym for Hebrew\nImmigrant Aid Society. Anyway, so we stayed there for three, four days in January, we\nwere on the February quota. February, we had to leave the country, and we went to\nCanada. We went to Niagra, Niagra Falls, Canada, and then we crossed the bridge to\nUnited States. But it was all pre-arranged with the immigration officials. They had all our\npapers squared away. They let us leave the country and then as we came, yeah, yeah --\nand from there we boarded the trains and came to Philadelphia, where we were met by a\nrepresentative from a Jewish social agency. And they took us to a country club, which\nwas, because it was winter, wasn\u2019t too well frequented. Anyway, so we spend there,\nabout five, six weeks, until this one guy, he was our quote, caseworker. He would take us\nfrom the country club, to -- he stayed with us in the country club. He would take us to the\ncity and try to find us an apartment and jobs, and all that. Well, eventually, he found us\njobs -- I mean, he found us an apartment and we moved to Philadelphia, from this\ncountry club, was called Filmount Country Club. I di -- I remember the country club, it\nwas very luxurious. I don\u2019t know if you know about Gimbel\u2019s, used to be a department\nstore, the owner had organized this club, and it was -- they used to try to impress us, what\nit takes to be a member of that club, you know. Anyway, but we enjoyed the facilities and\nthen we moved to Philadelphia, in a very slummy apartment, because that\u2019s all that was\nfigured out we could afford. And it was in the area what is today known as Society Hill,\nbut in those days wasn\u2019t Society Hill. It\u2019s within a block or two from Independence Hall,\nand all these historic sites. Anyway, life in Philadelphia for me, was very difficult. I\nmean, I didn\u2019t -- again, I didn\u2019t dwell on it, but I found a job, within maybe 10 days, I\nfound a job in the factory -- hat factory. It was very hard work. The pay was minimal\nwage, which it --",
        "A: Yeah, 50 cents an hour. And I remember, after the first month, I had to go -- no, I\ndidn\u2019t have to, but I went, asked for a raise, and it was a nickel, so I was making 55. And\nthen they passed a law that made it, the minimal 55 and I felt cheated. So next month I\ngot another nickel raise and so forth. But that was some really hard work. I worked there\nharder than I ever did anywhere. If you can imagine, hats are made from felt, heavy felt\nand steam. So you shape it with steam and in the summer, lots of steam is just not\nconducive to a well-being of a person, like myself, anyway. Anyway, so I worked there,\nand --",
        "A: Well, was --",
        "A: The de-decision was made by my father. We didn\u2019t have any money, that was the\ndecision. He didn\u2019t want to work, so I was the only one over 16, so the idea was that I\nwas going to earn something, whatever it was. And, as the customs of the times were, all\nchildren turned over their paycheck -- that\u2019s mailman -- turned over their paycheck to\ntheir father, and I was doing that. And if I could work extra, or overtime, and all that, that\nwas -- I was proud to bring a bigger check. Little by little my checks became, like 18\ndollars clear. Fi-First it was like 14 something and with the taxes deducted, you know.\nThen it got to be 16 - 18 and then finally I started making like a dollar an hour, God, I\nthought I was really the highest paying employee anywhere, and with overtime, I was\nhappy. And --",
        "A: Yeah. He didn\u2019t want to work. He was never much for working, even when we were\nkids, when we had the store. He said it was his store and my -- he would say my mother\nwas like an employee. But he never went to work there, very rarely would he go. And if\nhe would go, he would like, make it by 11 o\u2019clock. And people would wait for him. You\nknow, customers would line up, sometimes wait for him. People from the villages, who\nsold their foods and wares and like the milk lady, she would come early, deliver milk,\nand then with the money that she would collect, she has to buy a -- supplies or whatever,\nincluding material for clothes. So they would wait for him, they never knew when he was\ngoing to show up, 10:30 - 11. But anyway, he was not a working person. So, eventually, I\ngot my employer to offer him a job, and he did try, for awhile, but 1t was too hard for\nhim, you know. So he didn\u2019t -- he just never worked. Yeah, he would -- My two sisters\nwere young, you know, they were under 16, so they went to school. And then my mother\nfound a job with some local family that was making aprons, yeah. And she was just\nfolding them and packaging them. Not much of a job, but that helped. But they didn\u2019t\nneed her, they didn\u2019t need a full time employee. So, eventually, my mother found a place\nin a -- a factory -- clothing, men\u2019s clothing factory in Philadelphia. That was big industry\nthere. But I was the one that provided the main sustenance, you know, for the family.\nAnd, after the first, maybe four months -- like we came in February, in Philadelphia, I got\nthis job after we left this country club, in April and next September, I signed up for\nevening school, yeah. And from then on, I went to evening school. First high school,\nthen, you know, college. Seems like 15 years of evening -- evening school. But anyway -\n- yeah?",
        "A: Because, I had completed -- in Oswego, where we were signed up, I started seventh\ngrade, and as soon as I learned the language, got on the dean\u2019s list, you know. Let\u2019s face\nit, I was 14, and the kids in that class were 12. Yeah, so it -- I don\u2019t want to attribute to\nmyself any superior intelligence, but I was older, so my brain should function a little\nbetter than a younger kid. So, anyway, so I would be promoted every couple of months,\nto the next grade. So, in the -- what, in a year and a half, I had completed three years of\njunior high school, seventh, eighth and ninth grade. And, incidentally, all the kids in Fort\nOntario were not only on dean\u2019s list, but they were like top honors, always. They used to\ncall it high honors and we had to march to the stage, where the principal would shake our\nhand and hand us the report card, whereas others would get it in their classrooms, you\nknow. Anyway, this was during the assembly. But, so I started going to school, and I\nwould also take tests. What -- These were like Regency tests. It was uniform test, GD, I\nguess they call it, about each individual subject. What -- We had an advantage, I spoke\nmany languages by that time, and other languages have much more complex grammars.\nAnd American kids have problems knowing when to say me, or I, or him, or he, or -- you\nknow, things like that. And I would take these tests, English tests, and I mean, y-you just\nlisten to your ear and think about another language, you know. So, you have maybe two\ncases or three cases nominative, or objective and maybe possessive, which is -- we had\nseven of them, you know, and all of these different tenses in verbs and all that. So it was\nvery easy, I mean, except for spelling and pronunciation, English came pretty easy to us.\nBut anyway, the point 1s, I was able to take all these tests and move up my high school\neducation. I graduated from high school, and then went to college.",
        "A: Well, I gr-graduated --",
        "A: Yeah, I graduated in about a year and a half and so I was like 18 or so. 18 -- 18 anda\nhalf. I know, less than 19. And then I started college. But this was, in those days, they\ndidn\u2019t have like all, every evening, for four hours in the afternoon. Don\u2019t forget, I was\nworking full time, overtime occasionally. So, I would just go two hours at night, to\nschool. And it took awhile, until, well, at one point, much -- not much later, but in 1950,\nthere was a war in Korea and I was just the right age for that. So they tried to draft me,\nbut I got a couple of deferments, because I was the sole support of the family. But that\ndidn\u2019t last forever. So, eventually, I got drafted and well, I got drafted in the month that\nthey declare end of the war, in January \u201855. So, after serving my [indecipherable]",
        "A: I want to go back, yeah. Anyway, I was drafted in January, 1955, and after serving my\nbasic training, I was sent to Europe, yeah, to Germany, yeah. Well, that didn\u2019t go over\ntoo well with me, because of my background. I didn\u2019t think 1t was too safe to keep me in\nGermany. Safe for maybe somebody else, because I might be armed and might decide\nthat the -- you know, to provide justice for myself or whatever. But anyway, the point\nwas, I was, when I was inducted into the army, they give you a battery of tests. And one\nof the things that they decided that I would be pretty good for, filling an interpreters\nposition. And interpreters are mostly needed in front lines. So they trained me to be an\ninfantryman, and they send me to Germany. I spoke some German, but not enough to be\nan interpreter. Then I told them that I wasn\u2019t happy, so within eight days or so, they send\nme to France.",
        "A: Yeah, but I explained that to the chaplain, not to anybody in the chain of command,\nbecause I don\u2019t think the army would accommodate anything like that. So I guess he\ntalked to whoever was in the personnel office, when they were filling quotas for France.\nIn those days, we maintained what was known as communication zone in s -- in France,\nso I was sent to a place near Bordeaux, a camp which had a hospital. Well, it was like a\nregional hospital, regional POL. That stands for petroleum, oil and lubricants, and the\nother [indecipherable] area. They were all from Bordeaux, all the way to the German\nlines, where we maintained our native strength. So anyway, so I was sent there to\ninterpret French, which I didn\u2019t know a single word of. And the commanding officer\ninsisted that I was filling the slot, and he wanted me to interpret, so six weeks later, when\nhe called me, I interpreted. Anyway, so that\u2019s -- I spend a year and a half in France.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: I obtained my citizenship as soon as I was enti -- eligible for it, within five years of\nresidence, which was something one strived for. I know I did. I know my parents did and\neverybody that I knew that was in similar situation like I was, strived for, with pride.",
        "A: I\u2019m -- Well, how does one say I would be top patriot, you know. I would offer myself\nand whatever, you know, like they said in the signing the Declaration of Independence,\nour bodies and fortunes and whatever else. I mean, I had great feelings about this\ncountry, and I still do, of course. I may have political differences with some of the\nforeign policy, or maybe even internal policies, but you know, the country which\nprovided a home for me is utmost in my esteem, for -- unquestionably.\nis, what was your attitude when you went to serve in the army, representing the United\nStates?",
        "A: Okay, well first, a slight correction would be that my family would not be cared for.\nThey have, you know, allotment, but they\u2019re not sufficient to maintain oneself, especially\nthis point. Well, my sisters were already getting older, you know. I mean, they -- they\ncould go to work. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s both sisters. Let\u2019s see, in 1950, no, my one sister\nwould be -- \u201831, she was 19. No, 18, at that time, so she was working already, the -- the\none next to me, but the youngest one was still in school. So, this is the sister that I\nmentioned to you that, pretty strong willed, and she, as soon as she started working, she\nsays, \u201cWell, my money, the one -- the money that I earn, is mine.\u201d And she had problems\nwith my father. He insisted that 1t was his. So they came up to some compromise, but\nstill, not enough to maintain the family. You know, she was making like 25 dollars or so\na week and she settled for contributing 15 maybe, you know. It -- Not maybe, but that\u2019s\nthe number that I remember.",
        "A: No, this is Sarah.",
        "A: Yeah. The -- The one that when she was nine was guiding my mother, pulling her by\nthe hand. Anyway, so that was the other source of income, and my mother, she would\nwork, or wouldn\u2019t work, depending on the situation where she was working. They had\nlayoffs, and she wasn\u2019t very quick. She couldn\u2019t -- She couldn\u2019t manage on the\npiecework, so they had to pay her the minimum wage, and they were not happy to pay\nminimum wage to somebody who could not earn it under the piecework system. So my\nmother would be the first one to get laid off and the last to be re-hired. So, anyway, that\u2019s\nwhy I say my family would not be taken care of. But, when my younger sister started\nworking and the allotment, you know, and all that, then I -- I di -- I agreed that, okay, my\nfamily could survive without my full support.",
        "A: The allotment in those days was based on my salary, which was 78 dollars, so from\nthat, I needed to contribute something, and the government would contribute something\nalso. And I remember later, when I got a promotion, and -- well, whatever it was,\nincrease in pay, that the government\u2019s contribution would be 105 dollars a month. But we\nended up, my father was afraid to sign anything, and so h-he never signed the application\nfor allotment. He -- After we left camp, he was totally -- not devastated, but destroyed. I\nmean, his psyche was destroyed. He -- He thought that -- that people were looking at him,\nthe secret police was watching him, you know, and all that. It was -- mentally, he had\nproblems. And he wouldn\u2019t leave the house, he would stay in the house, all the time peek\nfrom the windows, you know. So he was not capable of doing anything. And he was afr -\n- like I said, afraid to sign any documents, for fear that might -- it might be some form of\na commitment or something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yeah, but --",
        "A: Yeah, but he still maintained the control. This was -- Yeah, you don\u2019t dethrone a king\njust because he 1s not functioning in the most efficient manner. So this was one of the\nfriction points in our lives, and it took long time to resolve it. In fact, it wasn\u2019t -- it was\nnever resolved, except when I came back from the military, 1t was a financial settlement\nkind of thing, that we decided how much we\u2019re going to provide for him and whatever he\ndoes with it, 1t\u2019s okay with us.",
        "A: Us being me and my two sisters. Actually, one sister was married. She got married in\n1951, so -- yeah, \u201850 -- \u201c51, June \u201851. So -- I mean July \u201851. So that eli-eliminated her,\nbut it was my younger sister and me.",
        "A: Okay, first I -- My life was totally taken up by my work and my school. And my\nsocial life consisted of Sunday afternoon, I would go to -- in Philadelphia, to the Y, work\nout, swim, meet some people there and spend the afternoon or evening. I did not have\nenough money to go on dates or anything at that point, for a long while. Then I started\ndating. I guess I met this girl at school in the evening, at college. And we dated for awhile\nand I was still mentally a child, while she was more mature and she wanted a future and I\nguess I wasn\u2019t ready for that. Then --",
        "A: No, no. I didn\u2019t -- I maintained contact with one family, who were immigrants. In fact,\nthere were three brothers in this family and they lived in Philadelphia, not too far from\nme. And the oldest boy was a year older than me and the second one in line was year\nyounger. And they were part of my clique in forta -- Fort Ontario. When I say my clique,\nwe were in the same clique and then when we moved here, we continued our friendship. I\nsay here meaning Philadelphia. We maintained our friendship, then the second they --\none of the -- middle brother of the three, he was accepted -- he was a pretty good student,\nhe was accepted in what they call Central High, which is academically advanced --\nadvanced school. In fact, you get a BA when you graduate from that high school.\nAnyway, and that was his future, he found friends, he developed different friendship. But\nthe older brother, this fellow by name of Raymond Barney, he was a friend of mine from\nthen on, I mean, from the camp and in Philadelphia, for a very long time. In fact, when I\nwas in the military service, I was stationed in France, and they\u2019re French, yeah, and he\ncame to visit me and we sort of got our signals mixed up. We were supposed to meet in\nNice and I went there for a week, and he wasn\u2019t there. And then I came back and he was\nwaiting for me near Bordeaux, in my installation, but I had already shot my vacation.\nAnd anyway, so we were good friends. And then, while I was in the service, he met a girl\nand he married her, and she was from New York, so he moved to New York. But, when I\ncame back from the service, I was -- I started dating some other girl, and I dated her for\nlike three, four years, but 1t was just Saturday night kind of thing, you know. We had a\nstanding Saturday night date. But then, let\u2019s see, what happened, we broke up, I know.\nShe went to -- to one of these resorts in the Catskill, she met somebody that was more\nserious than me, so that ended that. And then, in one of my summer evening classes,\nthere was a bunch of girls -- this was Spanish class. I was trying to get some college\ncredits in a hurry, so I would attend -- let\u2019s say I would attend advance college course,\nbut they wouldn\u2019t give me credit unless I had some of the other preliminaries. So I would\ntake an exam in the preliminary, pass that and have the advance course, which I had to sit\nfor. And this was advanced Spanish. So sh-she saw I had a ring. It was a monogram ring\nthat had turned itself around and she thought I was married, so she thought I was safe,\nnobody would say that, you know, that she was hitting on me, to use the current\ncolloquial. And so she would come and sit like next to me and I won\u2019t say copy, but we\nwould work the homework together. And it was a very happy group, like about eight girls\nand two guys and we would go after class, we go out, celebrate, or whatever. And that\ngirl, when I decided to leave town, get a job someplace else, I left her, you know. And\nthen one year I went to the mountains, the Catskills and lo and behold, we met again.\nAnd that was my wife for 30 years, and she passed away a year ago.",
        "A: Sandra.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: S-Sandra, she was from Philadelphia. She was born and raised in Philadelphia and her\nfather was also born in the United States. Her mother came to United States from either\nPoland or Russia, when she was like about two years old. And let\u2019s see, she -- Sandra\nwas also a night school college student. She -- She graduated with a degree in physics\nand math and she worked at General Electric. They had the research in the ballistic, you\nknow, the -- what do you call it, the missile re-entry was GE\u2019s job. In the olden days, the\nmissile would be shot up and out of the atmosphere and when it would come back, it\nwould burn, because the re-entry was physically too hot, I guess. It would burn out, so\nGE was working on different projects and she was in math and physics and computers --\nwith first generation computers, yeah. And well, we got to know each other and we got\nmarried in 1970. I\u2019m sorry -- \u201869.",
        "A: The what?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: She was Jewish. Anyway, let\u2019s see, I's -- I sort of didn\u2019t tell you anything about my\nlife, but anyway, I -- at one point, I-I started work -- when I came back from the military,\nI started working for the federal government, and in the college, I had taken up\naccounting, that was my major. And I had obtained like a certificate, which means 60\nsemester hours. Mostly concentrated 1n whatever my chosen field 1s, which was\naccounting, auditing, cost accounting and similar. And then economics, finance, things\nlike that. And then, when I went into the military, I got a few credits to languages. They\nhave a military college, it\u2019s a male kind of thing. You take a test -- You sign up and you\ntake a test at the end, yeah. Whenever you\u2019re ready, you mail your lessons to them, they\nmark them, whatever. Yeah, so I got a bunch of semester hours from -- during the\nmilitary stunt -- stint. And then I -- And when I came back, I had enough that I could see\nmy way, you know, light at the end of the tunnel, so I continued, and that\u2019s how I met\nher, you know. She was doing the same thing. She was working and going to college in\nthe evening.",
        "A: Yeah. At that point, I was. And then my younger sister got married and it was just --",
        "A: Yeah, Esther. And at that point I decided that somebody like myself, I guess -- how\nold was I? It\u2019s -- I could have [indecipherable] to what I was, but anyway, it was time to\nleave the nest, sort of, even though I was supporting it, the only sa -- means of support for\nit. But I decided to leave and I got a job with the -- well, I was working at the arsenal in\nPhiladelphia, place called Frankford Arsenal, doing what I\u2019m trained to do, namely\naccounting work. And then I applied for an auditors job, and this was out of Columbus,\nOhio. So in 1961, I guess I was 32 then, I left home and I went to Columbus, Ohio and I\nworked for outfit called Army Audit Agency, and we did auditing of the military\nestablishment.",
        "A: Okay, well you know it\u2019s funny, because when I was -- when I was living there\nbefore, we were really living like church mice. I mean, life was not pleasant, we were not\neating well, we were not having too much, you know, in the way of resources. And, I\ndon\u2019t know if I can describe the life, it was so basic, you know, and the -- occasionally\nmy mother would come and ask us for more money, because there\u2019s no money. What my\nfather was doing 1s really hoarding the money, yeah. So he had accumulated some money\nthat we didn\u2019t know about it. And he, after I left, they used that to live on. And it\u2019s funny,\nbecause my younger sister, she would pay bills for them and she knew how much they\nhad. And it was just -- My father passed away at a young age, 63, I believe, 64,\ndepending on how one computes, because they all had two different day -- birth dates,\nyou know, different years, because like his father didn\u2019t want him to go to the military,\ncompulsory draft, at a very young age, so he didn\u2019t register him when he was born, he\nregistered a year or two later. Anyway, so when my father passed away, there was like 10\ndollars in his account, you know, but they were using that up, whatever his savings were.\nSo I guess they managed, if they didn\u2019t have any money, I\u2019m sure I and some of my\nsisters, maybe, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m sure we could have given them enough.

And my older -- my other sister, had a daughter, a young daughter that she would\nbring to the other sister\u2019s house. So my mother would take care of these little kids and\nshe was in seventh heaven. She really enjoyed that. And my sister, to her credit, would\ntake good care of my mother, take her out all the time, you know, when -- when her\nhusband would be home to stay with the children, she would take her out to restaurants.\nThis is something that I guess I feel guilty, because we never took our mother out before,\nbecause our father would not want us to. And -- But anyway, my mother, all that stored\nup social, what shall I say? Expertise, and -- came out. She blossomed, you know. And\nmy other sister, she -- she liked my mother, she took care of her, I mean, calling her\nglamour girl, you know, and all that. Her life improved 1,000 percent after that. So, she\nlived with my younger sister for a very long time, until my youngest sister could -- sh-she\ngot Alzheimer\u2019s or maybe not Alzheimer, some form of dementia and then my sister had\nto put her in a home, yeah.

And I had the luxury of not having to travel extensively at one time, but I would\nhave different teams go out and do audits and I would just visit them for a day or two at\nthe site.

Anyway, so I would go fa -- visit different audit sites and I was maybe even go\nat the beginning and get them started and they would be there for three, four weeks,\nmaybe I would go once more, maybe I would go for final close-out with the installation\nthat we were auditing. But somebody had to take care of the children and help them\ngrow. What I started saying is that because of my modest background, I was able to\ncomfortably live on my salary, or my family was able to, you know. I provided them\nwhatever comforts they needed. In my opinion maybe not so luxurious, but anyway, we\ntook our vacations maybe a little bit out of the seasons. We -- You know, we took\nvacations four or five times a year, but maybe smaller ones, you know, when the\n[indecipherable] week-ends. And maybe before the kids started going to school, we go to\nthe beach in June and September, which was perfect for me, because it wasn\u2019t too\ncrowded. Anyway, we -- we didn\u2019t go to restaurants that cost, you know, hundreds of\ndollars. We found some interesting pla -- restaurants that catered to family trade and as\nfar as I know, my wife was satisfied and the kids were satisfied. And anyway, so the\nchildren were going to school, and the older one especially, she did good work. I don\u2019t\nknow why, but she always feared that she may not meet the standards that she sets for\nherself. Maybe she thought we expected a lot from her, maybe she thought I expected a\nlot from her. But she -- she participated in sports, swimming. They were not very big, I\u2019m\na small guy and their mother wasn\u2019t too big. She was about my height, maybe an inch\nshorter, and the kids are five foot one, five foot, you know. So they\u2019re not very tall and\nnot very big. And anyway, the older one participated in sports, first swimming and then\ndiving and that was a very active part of her life. In school, both of them were in the\ntheater and they were -- they excelled, actually, in these things, both of them. And\nanyway, so the older one turned out to be quite a scholar. I feel a 1 -- a lot guilty -- I was\ngoing to say a little guilty -- a lot guilty that I didn\u2019t keep up fully with their\ndevelopment in scholastics. But, to tell you about the older one, and since I\u2019m oriented\ntoward scholastics, I\u2019m proud of her achievements. She graduated from high school with\na four point average. She went to William and Mary and she graduated Summa Cum\nLaude, which is three out of the class were that. And then, to my surprise, she decided\nthat she wants to become a rabbi. And she went to this school, University of Judaism.\nAnd of course, now the expenses started getting a little bit higher, because the second one\nwas getting ready to go to college, and -- but anyway, we managed to send her and she\u2019s\nnow arabbi. She\u2019s -- She\u2019s teaching, because in -- and she married, what 1s -- we classify\nas Orthodox. We are not Orthodox, we are middle of the road, or Conservative, who --\nConservatives accept women rabbis, but Orthodox do not, yet. Saying yet, that\u2019s a\npolitical statement. Anyway, so she\u2019s now teaching. She\u2019s 29 years old.",
        "A: Oh, her name is Elisa Danon Kaplan. She married a young boy, his name 1s Three\nJonathan Kaplan. He\u2019s a Canadian young man from Montreal. About a year and a half\nago, a little less than that, we all flew to Montreal -- no, we didn\u2019t fly, I flew in my car,\nyeah, I picked up my daughter, and my -- older daughter and took her to Montreal, me\nand my wife and her.",
        "A: Yeah. That was -- After the wedding, she started getting worse, went downhill from\nthere. But anyway, she was married 21st of September, 1997, my daughter, in Montreal.\nThe entire family, on his side, was in New York, except his mother and father. And we\nwere here, but the mother, she is the kind of person, the take charge person, and they\nasked me if I would have objection if they have a wedding in Montreal, and knowing that\nmy wife, Sandy was not in the best of shape, we agreed, and it was a very nice wedding.\nIt\u2019s -- We have a lot of nice memories from that. And the younger daughter, she -- after\nshe graduated --",
        "A: Her name is Shoshanna. First one, if I mentioned, Elisa, yeah. Shoshanna is still\nsingle. She graduated from the same high school, in this vicinity. And then she went to\nOld Dominion University. It took her a little bit longer, because she was sick for one\nyear, she had mononucleosis. That sort of slowed her down and then she -- I don\u2019t know,\nit took her a little longer, anyway. She was not the studious type. She just -- Two weeks\nago she told me she\u2019s moving out. She got an apartment on Connecticut Avenue. She --\nShe graduated last June and she has a job with a private day school. Actually, it\u2019s a\nsynagogue day school in Washington, on Connecticut Avenue. Yeah Adatz Israel\nPrimary School. And she got an apartment there. I hope she finds good use for the\napartment. Right now, she\u2019s still spending about four days at home. I guess she doesn\u2019t\nwant to admit it, but she comes here for a good home cooked meal. So, that\u2019s it, but like I\nsaid, the life, for the past 30 years with my wife, was wonderful. And if I could change it,\nI would not.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s -- had everything that I needed, wanted, could e -- could expect, or\nwish for.",
        "A: Well, I wish I had taken psychology in school, I might have been able to answer that\nquestion a little better. But, I guess everybody\u2019s shaped by the events. Many of these\nevents take place, and the shaping is inside, th-that we are not aware of. We don\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s causing what and how we\u2019re being affected. You hear about two brothers,\ngenetically they are the same, maybe even twins. They grow up, one becomes a scientist,\nthe other is a gangster, you know. So the -- I don\u2019t know whether we have the\nenvironment that\u2019s prevalent, that it\u2019s determinant, or whether it\u2019s genes or what. But I --\nI have never stopped to analyze what made me what I am or what I was. I know one\nthing, that at one time, as I was growing up, I think I was very industrious and now I\u2019m\nlazy. The only work I do, mostly it\u2019s volunteering for different things and that\u2019s what I\nhave tonight, the volunteer job and tomorrow. But how we are shaped, that\u2019s for the\npsychologists and psychoanalysts and whatever. I know one thing, that I feel, quote,\nother people\u2019s pain. I know that\u2019s a term, I feel your pain is a common term that doesn\u2019t\nmean anything, but I do. And I feel that I\u2019m conscientious. I know what my\nresponsibilities are and I try to live up to them. Once upon a time, I think I had initiative.\nNow it\u2019ll take -- I don't know what it\u2019Il take to get me moving, you know. And it\u2019s not\nlack of physical ability, because I work out all the time, in the gym. So, you know, I go\nthrough that, and --",
        "A: Yeah, [indecipherable], yeah, I think so, yeah. I retired because my wife needed a lot\nof help. She -- At one point she was like a quadriplegic. I-It just went downhill. And you\nknow, th-that may be one reason. Another reason, it\u2019s -- the -- the s -- well, the\natmosphere at work changed. I don\u2019t know if this is appropriate to say, but Ill say it\nanyway, you can clip it out. But white males over 45 or 50, were not preferred species in\nthe government service. In fact, they wanted us out. So, because of the circumstances and\nthe offer they made me, I jumped at the opportunity to leave. Anyway, the -- you know,\nthe work situation was not conducive to a happy feeling, depending on who you were and\nhow you fit, you know, but being who I was just -- I didn\u2019t find it any more chal -- not\nchallenging, any more acceptable, anyway, for me.\nthe national parks, and wildlife preserves, and to build things and they would -- and teach\nthem how to -- well, some of them had fi -- completed 11 grades of high schools, but\ncouldn\u2019t sign their name. Yeah, this was -- they called it conservation work. Okay, so I\nwas -- be visiting these and spend a month there. There\u2019s no ci-civilization. There was --\nbe no synagogues to go to. So, I think I was not diligent enough in my religious\norientation, and -- but I knew who I was and everything, along those lines. I met my wife,\nmy -- the la -- the woman that I married -- well, when we met, again, as I mentioned\nbefore, in the Catskills Mountains -- I say mountains, it\u2019s a -- a place called Concorde,\nwhich was a quite plush resort. I remember one night I counted 17 bands and orchestras,\ndifferent location, within that one hotel. But anyway, after we started dating, I was\nworking in Boston, commuting on weekends to visit her. And then, when we got married,\nwhich was 1969, March \u201869, we moved to this area, that\u2019s where my job was. She still\nlived in Philadelphia. We moved here, first thing we did is look for a synagogue. She\nwas, well, ma -- we found a synagogue in Alexandria, where we still belong, or I still\nbelong. It\u2019s 30 years ago, and our first child wasn\u2019t born yet, but she already knew that\nshe was expecting when we joined the synagogue and I remember when my young -- m-\nmy older one was like six, seven years old, we started coming every Saturday to the\nservices and it was like a comeback, yeah. There\u2019s a Hebrew word -- and I\u2019Il give you the\nHebrew, Baltishua, which means somebody who comes back to the faith, yeah. So I\nwould classify us as such. But this took place like 28 years ago. Yeah, and again, my\nfaith is still very important to me. Currently, I started sort of socially seeing a lady. She\u2019s\nItalian, Catholic, very observant in her religion, but we\u2019re socially, what is it? We\u2019re\ngetting along fine. That\u2019s -- I haven\u2019t told that to my daughters yet, but anyway, that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay, well, no, the reason I didn\u2019t talk about, 1s because I didn\u2019t believe in\nvictimization. I didn\u2019t want to center my life around history, memories and all that. Lots\nof people have adverse conditions in their earlier parts of their lives, and if they dwell on\nit and make their whole life based on their victimhood, if you will, then they\u2019re not going\nto be very functional. I did not want to think about those things. But then later, when I\nwas being pressed by different people, including my sister -- my younger sister, Esther,\nwhy don\u2019t I join the survivor\u2019s groups and why don\u2019t I do things to, you know, to bring\nout situations, to sort of tell people about our history. I -- For awhile I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the\npoint, what\u2019s the point?\u201d But then they might think that I was being obsessive on that\npart. So I said, \u201cOkay, so if that\u2019s what you think I should do, fine.\u201d And that\u2019s when\nMartin Goldman asked me to do this video and this -- the synagogue was getting ready to\nput out that book a year or two later and like -- when was it, recently, there\u2019s a Jewish in -\n- there is a day in the Jewish calendar called Yom HaShoah, which is a Holocaust\nmemorial. Shoah means Holocaust in Hebrew. I was asked to give it -- a speech, a talk. In\nfact, they asked me to read this letter. It\u2019s like a memorial service for -- for the area. This\nwas in this northern Virginia. Different synagogues ha -- different years they hold it. So I\nspoke at my synagogue one year and last year was to another -- when I say I spoke to my\nsynagogue, it was a community -- not celebration, what do you call it? Commemoration\nlike --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. And I spoke to another synagogue in Reston last year, which had this\ncommunity service. And so, today I have no problem talking, although you did see how\nat certain points, I get a little choked up, but it\u2019s not an obsession with me, either way.\nAnd it\u2019s not a big event that made me either block it or release it. No, it just sort of\nflowed on itself.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: Well, I di -- I don\u2019t remember ever thinking too deeply about these things. I know\nsomebody in our family had to earn a living and I was the logical candidate at that time. I\nwas also having fun with -- with the kids my age. We would -- I would say we would run\nthat factory, you know, we\u2019d go wild sometimes, get yelled at, you know, things that 16\nyear old do, 16 - 17 - 18. And that\u2019s how the time passed. And of course, one thing, I\nalways tried to work overtime, to earn a few dollars extra, because I knew the need. And\nlater on, maybe I was a little bit resentful that I had to turn over my entire check to my\nfather, but I guess we just lived on, you know, from day to day and like I said, I started\ngoing to school and I had too many other things on my mind that were more important\nthan worrying about injustice and hard work and all that.",
        "A: Well, I guess she became Americanized earlier than I did, that\u2019s one possibility.\nAnother possibility is when she started working, which was several years later, after she\ngraduated from high school, at that time, I guess I was earning a little bit more, my\nmother already started making some money -- not much, in the factory. And so, th-things\nweren\u2019t as tight as they used to be. Plus, both my d -- my sister and I would be -- s-started\ngoing out, you know, so you spend some money and the need is there. And so she got\nbackbone earlier than I did.",
        "A: Well, maybe it\u2019s not Americanization, maybe it\u2019s gen -- a generation gap, that started\nsinking into my psyche, you know, my mentality. I don\u2019t know what -- at what point I\nstarted and what did it. I guess I started going out with some of the friends that -- where I\nworked, in the factory. And also school, I started dating a young lady in the class. So, you\nknow, you pick up things here and there, and you -- especially now, you -- and I had the\nsupport from my younger sister, so that was the point where I could assert myself in that\nparticular area. But there were other things where I had differences with my father and I\nasserted myself to a -- to certain extent, but as I look back all the way to my life, I was\nalways low profile, always avoiding confrontations. So maybe that\u2019s the reason. May --\nMay not be Americanization at all, just the term that I use to explain it.",
        "A: Okay, there were three or four families that came from Fort Ontario with us and is\nseveral in Philadelphia, there weren\u2019t too many. And my parents were in constant contact\nwith them. They would meet once a month for like, what do you call it, potluck kind of\naffairs at different houses. But I was very close with a family -- not family, but with two\nboys who were from Ontario. And I might have mentioned it in the earlier interview, two\nbrother, by name of Barney. They were French and -- French and Bulgarian, but they\nlived in France. And the older one, Raymond Barney remained my very best friend, all\nthroughout my younger days, but much of my limited recreational activity was also with\nmy co-workers in the factory and they were 100 percent Italian. They were un -- living\nunder the same restraints and restriction and limitations that I had, because their parents\nhad the same kind of rules. The parents, or grandparents had come from Italy and they\nwere like second generation Americans. So, I hung out with them and we would go on\nvacations to Atlantic City and things like that. So, one more area where I made friends,\nwas every Sunday afternoon, we would go to the Jewish Y in Philadelphia. And that\u2019s\nwhere -- for working out, swimming, and after that, we go maybe to a movie, or\nrestaurant or something like that. Yeah?",
        "A: No, no, they -- they just knew few key words, which they couldn\u2019t be mentioned in\nmixed company in those days. But anyway, no, they would take me to their homes and I\nwould talk to their parents or grandparents, Italian. But their Italian left something to be\ndesired, because they spoke dialect. Many of them did not know the real Italian language.\nAnd Italian has so many dialects, like one city that\u2019s separated from another city by 30 -\n50 miles, they don\u2019t understand each other. That\u2019s -- You know, they were city - states in\nthe olden days.",
        "A: Oh, my Jewish friends, we s -- they didn\u2019t speak Jewish, this is a younger generation.\nAnd I don\u2019t speak Jewish, so -- no, we spoke English. All the young people, even in Fort\nOntario spoke English. We had, I forget how many different nationalities. I think they\nsaid 160 or something, you know, large number of different nationalities. And English\nlanguage was the unifying element.",
        "A: Oh, my English was quite good within a month or two that we were in United States.\nNo, I -- When it comes to learning languages -- and I have a little key thought on that --\nwhen it comes to learning languages, total immersion is the only answer in my mind,\nbecause I saw how long it took us from nothing to total, well, fluency, if you will. When\nwe came to Fort Ontario, when we started going to schools, what happened, they put us\nin a school with the rest of the kids. There was no issue, you know, you speak this\nlanguage or you speak that language, so keep you separated. So, for awhile we just sat\nthere, like bumps on the log, you know, not doing anything or not responding. But, it was\nsinking in and I remember like in the school where I went to, we had maybe about 16 -\n17 kids from Fort Ontario. I was the first one that got on the dean\u2019s list, and that was\nwithin second -- well, the second report card period, and we had six each year, like three\nin the first semester, and three in the second -- every six or seven weeks. So, I got on the\ndean\u2019s list the first time. The very next time, was three of us, but the others were on the\nhigh ca -- high honors and I was still on the dean list. Next semester I got on the high\nhonor list. It was like a competition, yeah. And the language was not a barrier, especially\nwe excelled in English grammar, because there was no grammar to worry about, actually,\nwhereas the kids that were born here, they struggled, they didn\u2019t know objective case\nfrom nominative case, whatever. We were familiar with other languages, which had\nmuch more complex grammatical structures. So, that and of course, many of us were a\nlittle bit older than the other kids. Not all, but I was older than others in my fir -- class,\nwhere I was first assigned. So, they kept promoting us, you know, social promotions, if\nyou will. And the language was the easiest thing to absorb. That was not an issue.",
        "A: My parents spoke at home, Serbo-Croatian, or Ladino, which is --",
        "A: -- yeah, if you -- if you remember, I explained last time what it is.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, we were not exposed to that particular a-area of, you know, people who came\nfrom where Yiddish was spoken.",
        "A: We -- Yeah. Ours was what we call Sephardic, so yeah, Ladino was the spoken\ntongue.",
        "A: Well, let me take you back a few years, to 1944, when we were put in, in these classes\nwith regular American kids. And I, and many of my contemporaries, the immigrants, we\nwere very, Ill use the word rebellious. We couldn\u2019t absorb the American way of, I am\nnumber one, always yelling, you know, because some of the proverbs that I knew, and\nthat we were brought up under, tell you, if you\u2019re the one that\u2019s praising yourself, you\nmust be pretty low on the totem pole. So we did not accept when the teachers in the\nSocial Science class -- Social Studies class would tell us how Americans have the great\ndemocracy and you know, justice for all and saying your Pledge of Allegiance, allegiance\nwith liberty and justice for all. And we would say, \u201cYeah, what about the Negroes?\u201d That\nwas the term that was used in those days. \u201cWhat about the Negroes?\u201d And one time the\nteacher says, \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of you guys bringing this up,\u201d you know. And then I\nwould start saying, \u201cWell, how about if I mention South America and all that?\u201d Now, we\nwere politically aware of what was going up, so this is like an introduction, so you can\nsee what was in back of our minds. When the -- When the Negro movement started\ncoming out, you said in \u201854, I was totally involved in my studies and you know, work full\ntime and trying to take as many credit -- credit hours that I could at college, and there\nwere too many things on my mind to get involved politically. I -- I sympathized with the\ncause, but there were other conflicting things, such as I was attending a university in\nPhiladelphia, called Temple University, which was located in a section which was\nreferred to by the newspapers as quote, The Jungle. So I really -- night I would have to\ncome there and try to park my car, and it was located on Broad Street, which was a pretty\nwell lit street, but then it extended several blocks deep, into what I would call projects.\nThey were pretty poor areas, they were hundred percent Black. And that was pretty\ndangerous, at the time. Every so often there were killings and stuff. So, I don\u2019t know -- I -\n- I cannot recall how this conflict played in my mind. Struggle for independence versus\nthe criminal elements that were roaming in their sections. So, I just don\u2019t know how I felt\nabout that. But later on, when Vietnam was came, then I started participating, because,\nyeah I was fully free of all my educational requirements. I had graduated from college by\nthen and I was doing mostly traveling at that time, so my time was free, and I was one of\nthe protesters at one time or another, for different causes.",
        "A: Well, you know, to -- There were protests for equal rights. I participated in those. And\nthere were protests for -- against the -- the Vietnam war. I did some participation in that,\nalthough I was turned -- turned off, because of the -- some of the characteristics of the\npeople who participated in there. There was a lot of anti-Semitism by the Blacks at that\ntime, and I -- there was a lot of Jews, young, you know, Jewish students that were\nparticipants, but what bothered me, that they never stood up and objected to the overt\nanti-Semitism by the quote, leadership of the -- this anti- Vietnam movement. And even if\nyou went -- tried to participate in the Civil Right activities, there was lot of anti-\nSemitism, so I f-found this dichotomy, I said that, you know, it\u2019s making it difficult for\nme to participate in one cause, while they\u2019re acting in this manner. And there was, of\ncourse, lot of drugs going on, which I never, never touched. I was single in those days,\njust to remind you. So anyway, but -- So I sort of pulled back from that, and I put it back\nof my mind. I don\u2019t know that I gave it another thought since then.\nanti-Semitism in the anti-war movement. I just wonder if you could say a little bit more\nabout that.",
        "A: It was rampant. There -- They were accusing, well like now, they are accusing them of\nspreading AIDS and you know, in through certain times way back in history, they\naccused them of poisoning wells and drinking blood and all that, you know, it\u2019s -- and lot\nof them -- I don\u2019t know who the leaders of the anti- Vietnam war movement were. There\nwere many Jewish names, if you think of the -- what is it, Chicago seven, you know, and\nall that, there\u2019s a lot of Jewish names, but of course they were not participating -- I mean,\nthey were not practicing Jews, number one. Number two, they were blinded by the\npurpose of their cause and everything else didn\u2019t matter. And number three, I guess they\nwere afraid to be it -- if they objected, they were afraid to be accused of not being quote,\ngood rebels or something, you know. So, and maybe they were even anti-Semitic\nthemselves, in -- there\u2019s self hate in every group and I know there\u2019s enough of that\namong the Jewish rebellious youth. So, you know, I really don\u2019t know what I can say\nabout that subject.",
        "A: Well, you know, like there is a saying, my country right or wrong, but that\u2019s just part\nof it. If wrong, then to correct it and set it in the right direction. So, I had no problem. I\nmean, burning the flag is a extreme act of some -- of desperation, I would guess and even\nSupreme Court says that that\u2019s acceptable way of protesting which, it goes against my\ngrain, you know, it\u2019s disturbing to see that. But I was opposed to the war and I didn\u2019t see\na need for it and there\u2019s been wars there forever, 1t was imperial wars. Just a substitution\nof F-French left, Americans stepped in. You know, it wa -- continuation of the same and I\nknew how French had treated their imperial subjects and the Americans just continued\nthe same way, so I -- I wasn\u2019t happy about that. But that did not diminish my love for this\ncountry. If we can correct it\u2019s ways, you know. Every now and then, the best of us go in\nthe wrong direction. If always, somebody would put us straight, you know. So I had no\nconflict, as far as that goes.\nfather, he was the authority, the physical strength, if you will, because he had used his\nsuperior power, physical power on me in the past, so that\u2019s one area. When it came to\nobjecting to things the way they were, like I think a first recorded objection, when we\ncame to Fort Ontario, was the barbed wire. I used the word wi -- fence, but it was a\nbarbed wire fence. We objected to that, of course. That didn\u2019t mean that we want to go\nand have -- fight it out, you know, with the government. And when it came to protesting,\nI was just one in the sea of protesters. And, as a matter of fact, when I lived in\nPhiladelphia, these protests -- Vietnam war, I was already in Washington. Well, I was in\nColumbus and then in Washington. But when I lived in Philadelphia, they had these\ncoffeehouses. This was way back in the early 50\u2019s, and the people would go there, these\nyoung protesters would just read poetry and we would drink coffee and well, I guess\nthere was something else going on, maybe drugs or something, but I was not privy to\nthat. I would just go there as a date, you know, a place to take your date and sip coffee\nand watch these people try to perform, sing, recite, play the guitar and all that. So it was,\nyou know, in the vogue, everybody was doing it, in my circle of friends. And then one\ntime, well, when we were there, the place got raided and we were all taken in, you know.\nBut it -- you know, it doesn\u2019t change my character, I did not go there to have a -- a you\nknow, showdown, to beat up people or get beat up. I just went there because it was the\nthing to do and everybody else did it and I didn\u2019t see any harm in it and whatever else\nwas going on there, that prompted the police to come and arrest everybody in there, well,\nthat\u2019s something that I did not prepare for, you know. And later on, I would engage\npeople in an academic discussion of different political viewpoints or economic\nviewpoints or anything like that. Again, it was non-physical, just debate.",
        "A: No, no. They -- They -- You know, they held us there, they asked questions. It took a\nfew hours to let us go, but, in fact, we were able to -- I was able to return the girl home\nbefore anybody was aware of anything strange happening, you know. Her parents did not\nknow about it.",
        "A: Terrified. Oh, yeah. Like I said, I mean, I was not out there to challenge authority at\nthat time.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: Well, here comes another conflict within my psyche. First, let me say that the -- the\nanswer to your question is -- it\u2019s no. I have not spoken freely with --",
        "A: Yeah, okay, and the problem is that I never wanted to impose my will or my history or\nmy anything, on anybody, unless they really showed, to my extreme satisfaction that they\nwere interested. So, my kids, I didn\u2019t want to teach them the languages that I knew, I\ndidn\u2019t want to tell them about my history, because this fell in this particular category,\nwhen I was saying, when they are ready to hear my story, if they ask me, I\u2019Il tell them.\nOtherwise, Ill just keep quiet.",
        "A: Well, they started asking, the older one. At one point she sort of said, da -- \u201cHow\ncome, Daddy, you never told us about your history and all that?\u201d So I told her, briefly.\nAnd then, after the Holocaust Museum made that tape, they saw it and they did not know\nmost of it, so I guess one of the usefulness of the tape, was to transmit my story to my\nchildren, to that extent that it was done.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t think that I have any difficulty speaking about it. I c-certainly don\u2019t have\nany problem in willingness to talk about it. Sometimes, as I talk about certain things,\nthere\u2019s subconscious sensitivity on some points or issues, and I couldn\u2019t even tell you\nwhich ones they are, but sometimes I feel that something is happening to my eyes, you\nknow. So -- But no, there\u2019s no problem, no reluctance on my part, to speak about it.",
        "A: Bal Tefulah, yeah. I\u2019m sorry, Bal Teshuah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I never really abandoned it, or anything like that, no. What was happening, after\nthe destruction of our synagogue in Split, and after we left Split, really, I was at that\nparticular stage in life, age had lot to do with it, another one 1s the surroundings. I was\nwith the partisans, wearing a red star on my cap, he -- you know, the hat, or whatever it\u2019s\ncalled, the military hat. And they, as you know, and everybody knows, Communists are\nthe opposite end of religion, you know, they are -- and not only agnostic, but they\u2019re\nreally opposed to any form of religion. So I was being at my very vulnerable stage, I was\nbeing exposed to the opposite side of religion. And I guess I absorbed some of that. But\nthen later, when I was in the -- back in the Jewish surrounding, in Fort Ontario, so I\naccepted, I realized, you know, and there was no problem. I never denied being Jewish or\nanything like that. And later on, when I left my parents house, and I went on my own, I\nwas working out of Columbus, Ohio, but they were sending me to Tennessee, and\nArkansas, and Oklahoma, you know, th -- for months at a time. Well, maybe not months,\nfour or five weeks at a time. And in some places, the population was 2,000, you know,\nthe nearest big city. I was doing audits of different installations and there wasn\u2019t very\nmuch Jewish presence. Well, sometimes I s-searched it out. It was always a little bit of\nan effort to -- you had to travel 20 - 30 - 40 miles, to the nearest Jewish community. So,\nsometimes I guess I got sloppy, you know. Friday night, it\u2019s customary to go to the\nJewish religious services, well the guys are going out carousing or whatever, you know,\nso there is -- there was this conflict. If you can imagine when you were in your 20\u2019s, you\nknow. So, that might have been a problem, but when I got married, and I married a girl\nwho -- her father and her household was non-religious to put it mildly, but yeah, we\nsearched that synagogue, within the first year we joined the one that was near us -- well,\nnot too near, but anyway, and we were active participants and then as our children -- as\nwe got children, and as our older one started attending school, we started coming more\noften -- well, regularly. And it\u2019s funny, because the rabbi asked for a commitment from\ncongregants. Any kind of commitment and he says, you know, it was like a -- it wasn\u2019t a\nfund-raiser, but says, \u201cWe\u2019re asking you to commit yourself to something, to tell you that\nyou know who you are.\u201d So I said, \u201cOkay, attendance once a week of the religious\nservices.\u201d And since then, we would bring our daughter to her school this -- on Saturday,\nanyway, we\u2019d stay for the service, and when the other girl was born, then we bring her\nwhen she was small, and we attended regularly and I don\u2019t think I missed one, even with\nthe big snows, so we been quite observant. And then, later, when my older daughter\nbecame, oh, I guess conscious of her religion and all that, she got her mother to convert\nthe kitchen into, you know, kosher home and all that. And I don\u2019t know where we fit on\nthe spectrum of religiosity, but I feel very comfortable in it.",
        "A: Well, yeah, that\u2019s true. As a matter of fact, the telephone call was about that. My\nyounger daughter, when we goes -- when she was here, we would go Saturday for the\nservices and the -- just to let you know, we have three services every day and Saturday\nit\u2019s important to have, like in the morning services and noon services, or afternoon, the\nbig -- the central theme of the Jewish religious observance or ritual, 1s reading the Torah,\nand the Torah is read Saturday morning and Saturday afternoon. So, my younger\ndaughter got accustomed to leading the service, the Saturday afternoon. And this was the\ncantor from our synagogue, says he 1s not going to be here March 13th -- 12th and 13th\nand he wants to know if he can count on my daughter to come and lead the service. And\nshe did that when she was at college and she has been doing it when she was home, here.\nWe would go Saturday morning and stay for the Saturday afternoon service. So she\u2019s\nquite knowledgeable and it\u2019s not something I taught either one of them, they picked it up\non their own.",
        "A: Agoudas Acheim, which means congregation of brothers. It\u2019s not a sexist term,\nbrothers. Brothers includes sisters, also.",
        "A: It\u2019s in Alexandria. It\u2019s near Quaker Lane and what is it, 395.",
        "A: No, I have not been back. At one point I was considering it seriously, but somehow\nother things got in the way. When I was in the military, during the Korean conflict, they\nsend me to -- first to Germany and then France. And at several times, like during vacation\ntime, I would go travel around Europe and I never went back to Yugoslavia, because it\nwas still under the Communist rule and I didn\u2019t know what kind of foolish things they\nmight do, like oh my papers might show that I was born there and they might retain me or\nsomething and that wouldn\u2019t f-fit too well with my military requirement to be on the post,\nyou know. We -- Anyway, no, that was one fear. And one time, I went to a religious\nretreat in Bavaria and we went to Salzburg, Austria, which is not too far from\nYugoslavian border -- Yugoslav border, and I\u2019m -- I was toying with the idea, going\nacross, well, I had a few days free time, so I figure, maybe I rather spend them in Munich\nand was some -- Salzburg and those areas, than take a chance going across. And I didn\u2019t\nknow what kind of roads they had and I read about lots of accidents, traffic accidents and\nwe were, well, limited time, so I didn\u2019t go. But, all my o -- both of my younger sisters\nwent there. The younger one went in 1957, the youngest one. That\u2019s when she was\nearning enough money on her own to have her own kind of vacation. She went, visited\nmy older sister there. And she enjoyed her stay and the country seemed even prettier than\nit was in her mind, in her imagination. And the middle sister, Sarah, she went right before\nthe war, this present conflict, like 1990 - \u201891, I think. She and her husband, and they\ntoured the country and she retained quite a few good memories of her visit. But I never\nwent back, even though my brother-in-law keeps bugging me, keeps asking me to come\nthere, and visit.",
        "A: Well, I knew what was happening in that country and anybody who was interested,\ncould have read a little bit about what the -- the basis of the country and the influences\nfrom outside, and I can be as specific as you want me to be. But I\u2019m not too proud of the\nstaff in our state department. If -- If you want me -- okay --",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, well, first of all, the country was created from all these different, southern\nSlavs. Many were under Turkish occupations and others, even more, were under Austro-\nHungary empire. And the -- some under Italian occupation, but these people were\nbrought up differently. They had different religions, different scripts and different\nhistory. So they were not the same kind. Ethnically, I guess, many years back, they came\nfrom the same origin, but because of these power -- super-power interplays, and controls\nand agitation, they -- the super-powers played on the differences and they instigated these\npeople. Divide and conquer, it\u2019s a old expression and it\u2019s -- it was true. So Germany and\nthrough Austria, actually, was funding the protests and the uprising of the Croatians and\nthe Serbians, they were monarchy for a longer time and they had fought the Turks and so\nthere was -- the conflict was being raised. They were supported -- Serbia was supported\nby Russia, of course, because that\u2019s the big brother, Russia, and was supported also by\nFrance and England. So there was that inner conflict. Now, what we call Bosnia today,\nactually it\u2019s Bosnia and Herzegovina -- nobody can pronounce the Herzegovina part.\nAnyway, these were just two little provinces. As far as I know, they never had a political\nautonomy. And they were shuffled back and forth between Turkish empire and Austro-\nHungarian empire. At the time when my parents were born, this was under Austro-\nHungarian empire, but there was enough Turkish influence there, from various periods.\nAnyway, so as I was trying to emphasize, there was a lot of the conflict fueled by the\noutside powers. So, when the Germans came in the play, of course they made the\nsupreme break, they armed the Croatian, you know, and they -- they gave the Croatian\nauthority to kill and the Croatian outdid themselves killing Jews, of course, but Serbs,\ntoo. And that was in everybody\u2019s mind after the war. So Tito, when he became the leader\nof the partisans, he tried to unify them back to where they could live with each other. And\nwhatever it took, I guess we heard about pax romana, but we had pax Yugoslavia,\nwhatever. Tito, you know, he was -- yeah, he was the dictator, no question about it. And\nhe was a Communist, but he was very pragmatic. He allowed anything that worked for\nhim, so economically, he abandoned Communism and put in some form of free\nownership, private ow-ownership and free trade and all that. But anyway, I knew when\nhe would pass away, that there was -- something was going to happen, because he didn\u2019t\nbuild a natural succe-succession force. He did provide the mechanism, but no way to\nenforce it, because the control of the country was with the secret police and the army and\nhe didn\u2019t have people who -- who were going to take over those phases after he was\ngone. But anyway, so when -- whenever it was, six, seven years ago, when Croatians\ndeclared themselves independent, first 1t was Slovenia, and the Yugoslav army tried to\nput down the insurrection, if you will. And they were not successful, because they had to\ncross Croatia and Slovenia was in the mountains and it was not the most effective way of\nconducting a war. So Slovenia succeeded in seceding from Yugoslavia. Then when\nCroatia seceded, they had all these people from way back, the ones that were Fascists and\nthey -- they took over the power. And when there was a conflict in bosni -- yeah, well, I\nwant to say the Croatians -- the Fascists took over the power and the Serbian government,\nunder this guy Milosevic, and he must be some kind of a kook, you know. He\u2019s -- I guess\nhe\u2019s a Yugoslav Saddam Hussein. But they tried to punish the Croatian and instead of\ntaking, let\u2019s say territory, they would just go there and destroy. Like, that was their way\nof discouraging, but not a very civilized way. But anyway, the Croatians were not very\ncivilized either, so -- and when I look at it, that\u2019s all evil, it\u2019s all around and which one is\nthe worst, and in my mind, I say Croatians are worse than the others. But unfortunately\nfor my viewpoint, American government encouraged the Croatian, funded it and we were\nthere, we were in a position to pacify that area, we didn\u2019t do anything. In fact, whatever\nwe did was -- this was, much of it was done under Jim Baker\u2019s rule. Jim Baker, he was\nGeorge Bush\u2019s Secretary of State, but I -- I would call him president, because he was\nacting in that position. So, I didn\u2019t like what was going on. Libya and Iran were sending\narms to Bosnians, to the Moslem side and of course, they had no way to get the arms\nthrough, except through American controlled areas. So we just let them and the Croatians\nwould take half for themselves and give the Moslems the other half. And that\nencouraged, you know, s-stri -- fighting. And I think we picked the wrong side in that\nconflict. We could have pacified it, we didn\u2019t. And that\u2019s my viewpoint.",
        "A: Okay, the kind of life that my sister had under the Communist regime was not\npleasant. Number one, when they were -- she uses the term demobilized, after the end of\nthe struggle, she came home to Split. Of course, everything that we ow -- had owned, was\ntaken, but she was able to find out where some of the furnishings were, like the bedroom\nset and the dining room and the, you know, just the furniture. And she tried to recover\nthat and they were giving her a hard time. The government was not very friendly toward\nthe Jewish returnees, if you will. People who had been either in the armed services, or\nwho had escape and came back. Either -- Well, I don\u2019t know if anybody who listens to\nthis, whether they remember what happened when the Jews tried to come back from the\nconcentration camps. In Poland, they would be attacked and many would die and all that.\nSo, the anti-Semitism was rampant, just as much after the war as it was during the war,\nexcept now it was not under the approval of the state, but just -- the state would sort of\nturn away, or wink, or whatever. So, it was difficult. She used to tell us how she had\ndifferent problems trying to reclaim this. And then finally, she went to court and very\nunsympathetic. No, it was very uns-unsympathetic government and when she did get it, it\nhad the -- the furniture had degenerated to a point that it wasn\u2019t worth anything, so it was\ndumped. And she didn\u2019t have any means of support. She lived with her uncle, who was a\nbarber and she -- there was an aunt that came from Fort Ontario, went back. She lived\nwith them also. And they were very poor. The life was difficult for everybody after the\nwar, but especially for her and she was by herself, there was nobody there. And we\nsuggested several times that she should try to come and we could try -- work on it, but\neither we were not energetic enough or she was not enthusiastic enough, so nothing was\never done. Then she met a young man and she wanted to marry him and we were\nopposed to that, because of religious differences. And I -- They married anyway and then\nlife improved for them as -- well, she was still studying, and life improved as he started\nmaking a more comfortable living.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"
