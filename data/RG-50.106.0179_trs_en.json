So the first people \u2014 because I just saw that, I was not there, but I\nsaw that. They sta \u2014 stand on th \u2014 on the ditch. On that side was the shooters. There\nwas Latvians and Germans. And the Jewish people \u2014 you know, there is a mother\nwith the child, and two little \u2014 every \u2014 the Jewish people have children, a lot of\nchildren. They stay, and the machine gun was tata-tata-tata \u2014 I remember this \u2014 the\nsound. The sound was tata-tata-tata-tata-tata-tata-tata, and they was falling in that\ngrave, half dead, half alive. The little children screaming, people was be-benching\nto God. Wa \u2014 be \u2014 woman was scr-screaming and yelling and crying. It is a mess,\nyou know, that is just like \u2014 what \u2014 what can I feel? I feel nothing. I am like I\u2014I-\u2014\nit\u2019s like a joke, or something, I don\u2019t know. But I did say \u2014 see that. But I was not\non the grave. I was li \u2014 in the line, what was the line, I was very far. Til I came back\n\u2014 you know what happened? I was already \u2014 I remember one \u2014 one moment. I did\nhave to take off my coat. Before, I remember my father, in the good times, he was\nba \u2014 he bought me a wonderful pur \u2014 purple is my color, you know, I\u2019m a Pisces,\nand purple is my color, and my coat was purple, and was new and wonderful. The\nGermans \u2014 and then \u2014 though it wa \u2014 was our \u2014 one place, all the coats must be in\none place. The jewelry, what you have jewelry like this, everything in the box. So\nJanuary 24, 2010\nba \u2014 when you have a hat, is in a different place, the shoes. There was so many. Aga\n\u2014 how you call that in English? A mountain of shoes, a mountain of s \u2014 coat. And I\nwanted \u2014 oh yeah, already wanted to take, because the German said take off your\ncoat and stay in line. And \u2014 and it was cold, and I kind of tried to take out the coat,\nand I couldn\u2019t take it off, so I put 1t on back, and I stand wi \u2014 til our line was come,\nwe are going to be dead in a minute. So the line was going slowly, slowly, slowly,\nand so we stay, my father, mother, we stay all together, and my uncle, and the two\nlittle babies. And suddenly, you know, this is the worst moment in my life. I know\nwhy I was always \u2014 use that. That particular moment, I will never forget that. I\ndon\u2019t know from where, I don\u2019t know why, suddenly arri \u2014 arrived four Germans on\nhorses. White, beautiful horses. And on every horse was a general, a German\ngeneral. Not a Hakenkreuz, because some of them was Hakenkreuz, they were the\nworst. No Hakenkreuz, just German uniform. Til today I don\u2019t know who they\nwere. That was a miracle. And he said out \u2014 not chasen, out, out, out, not\nchasen(ph), not chasen(ph). And \u2014 and the [indecipherable] stopped. And that\ngeneral of the four horses say, women, if you are schneiderinin(ph) come to me,\ncome to me, come to me. I need \u2014 I have a factory, and you can work as\nschneiderin in my factory. My mom grabbed me and my sister and screamed, I am\na schneiderin, mine children\u2019s in schneiderin [indecipherable] my life. We wereJanuary 24, 2010\nschneiderin, and \u2014 and there\u2019s was my father, my sister and my brother stayed on\nthe grave, they was killed, in that particular time, in Rumbula, that was happened\nin Rumbula. That is the \u2014 the name, Rumbula, where the killing was. And that, I\nam the only witness alive, of today. The only. I will show you in the corridor, I have\na little memorial there. So, how chasen \u2014 my mom \u2014 so we stay \u2014 we\u2019ll stay with\nthe officer. You know, every little thing maybe will be different. At least my mom\nhas both \u2014 both girls, you know. She was very happy. We are schneiderin and we\nshall stay. So, there was a running other woman, other woman, and it was a group\nwith about 200, or 150, I really don\u2019t remember. The people know each other from\na [indecipherable] shtetl, you know, you know each other. And so \u2014 so was, we\nstayed there behind the four fe \u2014 horses, beautiful horses, I will never forget these\nhorses. And they \u2014 there \u2014 the uniform what the \u2014 the Germans has, was like\nWehrmacht. This is a different German, the kind of. No Hakenkreuz. I really\nlooked at that, it was no Hakenkreuz. They was Wehrmacht officers, but they was\nofficers, definitely big \u2014 big shots. So, when the group was about 150 already, we\nmoved. The other, they moved. He \u2014 we \u2014 he took it out of that. They basically save\nus, kind of, in a way. So, he say, you follow me. This group goes on \u2014 this is the\nother group. You come after me, we will go ahead. So the four horses went the\nfront, and we went under. We was tired, and hungry, but we went, because weJanuary 24, 2010\nthought maybe this a good thing, maybe we\u2019 ll work as schneiderin, and that\u2019s very\ngood. So we walk and walk through the woods. It was all the same. They \u2014 they\nwent this way, we went this way. So we walk and walk and walk, and where we\nwalk, I am from Riga, I know every corner. It is the prison. It is Termin(ph) prison,\nthe name was Termin(ph), Termin(ph) prison, the name of the prison. The \u2014 the \u2014\nthat the \u2014 how you call that? The prison [indecipherable] get up \u2014 you know, it is\nfrom wood, such \u2014 with eyes that went up, and th-the \u2014 the horses and the people\nwere standing here, with all these 150 or 20, I don\u2019t remember how many, went in\nand \u2014 and this a [indecipherable] prison. I was never in prison, I didn\u2019t know, but\nyou know, you know how a prison looks, yes. But the four \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 this \u2014 the\nGermans on the four horses stayed outside. We never saw him. We never worked as\nschneiderinin(ph). Til today, I kn-know that they saved our lives, because they\ntook us away from the [indecipherable]. Otherwise we \u2014 we stayed in the line,\nbecause it were only lucky we \u2014 we stayed in the back. Otherwise, we would be\nkilled, like other people. So, now we\u2019re in the pri-prison. What are we going to do,\n150 people about, or 20, I don\u2019t know. So, usually in a prison when you are, you get\nyour own kamera with a little whatever. No, the Jews didn\u2019t get that. They took us\non \u2014 on top on the prison, with a open sky, and it was November, I remember that\nwas November. It was cold. It was very cold, and it \u2014 the waywer \u2014 the weather was\nJanuary 24, 2010\nwonderful, not snowing, and not raining. At that time in Latvia is always terrible\nsnow, and terrible rain. Nothing. So, we sit all together [indecipherable] to each\nother because it was cold. So we just \u2014 the little group what was there, we were \u2014\nhow you call that?",
        "Q: On the roof?",
        "A: On a roof, on the prison roof, on top. There was no cover, and we were so \u2014 the\nmoon, the \u2014 the \u2014 the stars we saw. But here it was a open place, how you call that,\nit wer \u2014 I don\u2019t know how you call. So we sit all together. And there is a other story.\nThe story is louse. The first time I saw a louse on me. And this \u2014 you know, I have\nepisodes to tell you. When you would hear my episode, you don\u2019t need me to do a\ninterview, because my episodes tells everything about me. So, the first \u2014 I\nremember I made \u2014 you know, I [indecipherable] how you call that in English?",
        "Q: Knit? Knit?",
        "A: How you Say that?",
        "Q: Knit? Crochet?",
        "A: Crocheted. I crocheted. I had a back crocheted dress, along like that. And I was\ntired, so we lied down, it was just a floor, you know? Look at \u2014 it\u2019s open see \u2014 I see\nthat, the sky, and I say, why I am here, and you know, start \u2014 so I lie down, and I\nsee something white is coming just over me. And I \u2014 and I see that she comes to me.January 24, 2010\nAnd when she \u2014 she got big. I have never seen \u2014 that was a big louse, you know, I\ndidn\u2019t know this is a louse. I\u2014 when \u2014 when the louse was already about here, I start\nscreaming, a louse, a louse, help me, help me. So the girls get up and everybody\ncome to kill the louse. They found the louse, they kill the louse. But I had \u2014I saw a\nlouse. So I can imagine that we all had a lot of louses.

So the \u2014 the \u2014 the line star \u2014 people running. The moment you\nrun, th-they shoot you, you \u2014 shoot you right away. Stay back in line, stay back in\nline. So, I came and stay back in line with Papa, Mama, and my sister, because we\ndidn\u2019t want to lose each other. We hold all the time together. Also, there was my\nuncle, my father\u2019s brother, who was also with us, his wife and two little children,\nfour year and six year. And they was all with us, and they was killed. So I don\u2019t\nknow, but I wind up in a wild place. I saw \u2014 I saw a \u2014a gra \u2014 grave. Is this a grave?",
        "A: A ditch, a ditch. And there was people with \u2014 with ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta \u2014 the\nshooters with the \u2014 and the Germans say stay in line, or \u2014 we was back there, we\nwas very back. So the first people \u2014 because I just saw that, I was not there, but I\nsaw that. They sta \u2014 stand on th \u2014 on the ditch. On that side was the shooters. There\nwas Latvians and Germans. And the Jewish people \u2014 you know, there is a mother\nwith the child, and two little \u2014 every \u2014 the Jewish people have children, a lot of\nchildren. They stay, and the machine gun was tata-tata-tata \u2014 I remember this \u2014 the\nsound. The sound was tata-tata-tata-tata-tata-tata-tata, and they was falling in that\ngrave, half dead, half alive. The little children screaming, people was be-benching\nto God. Wa \u2014 be \u2014 woman was scr-screaming and yelling and crying. It is a mess,\nyou know, that is just like \u2014 what \u2014 what can I feel? I feel nothing. I am like I\u2014I-\u2014\nit\u2019s like a joke, or something, I don\u2019t know. But I did say \u2014 see that. But I was not\non the grave. I was li \u2014 in the line, what was the line, I was very far. Til I came back\n\u2014 you know what happened? I was already \u2014 I remember one \u2014 one moment. I did\nhave to take off my coat. Before, I remember my father, in the good times, he was\nba \u2014 he bought me a wonderful pur \u2014 purple is my color, you know, I\u2019m a Pisces,\nand purple is my color, and my coat was purple, and was new and wonderful. The\nGermans \u2014 and then \u2014 though it wa \u2014 was our \u2014 one place, all the coats must be in\none place. The jewelry, what you have jewelry like this, everything in the box. So\nJanuary 24, 2010\nba \u2014 when you have a hat, is in a different place, the shoes. There was so many. Aga\n\u2014 how you call that in English? A mountain of shoes, a mountain of s \u2014 coat. And I\nwanted \u2014 oh yeah, already wanted to take, because the German said take off your\ncoat and stay in line. And \u2014 and it was cold, and I kind of tried to take out the coat,\nand I couldn\u2019t take it off, so I put 1t on back, and I stand wi \u2014 til our line was come,\nwe are going to be dead in a minute. So the line was going slowly, slowly, slowly,\nand so we stay, my father, mother, we stay all together, and my uncle, and the two\nlittle babies. And suddenly, you know, this is the worst moment in my life. I know\nwhy I was always \u2014 use that. That particular moment, I will never forget that. I\ndon\u2019t know from where, I don\u2019t know why, suddenly arri \u2014 arrived four Germans on\nhorses. White, beautiful horses. And on every horse was a general, a German\ngeneral. Not a Hakenkreuz, because some of them was Hakenkreuz, they were the\nworst. No Hakenkreuz, just German uniform. Til today I don\u2019t know who they\nwere. That was a miracle. And he said out \u2014 not chasen, out, out, out, not\nchasen(ph), not chasen(ph). And \u2014 and the [indecipherable] stopped. And that\ngeneral of the four horses say, women, if you are schneiderinin(ph) come to me,\ncome to me, come to me. I need \u2014 I have a factory, and you can work as\nschneiderin in my factory. My mom grabbed me and my sister and screamed, I am\na schneiderin, mine children\u2019s in schneiderin [indecipherable] my life. We wereJanuary 24, 2010\nschneiderin, and \u2014 and there\u2019s was my father, my sister and my brother stayed on\nthe grave, they was killed, in that particular time, in Rumbula, that was happened\nin Rumbula. That is the \u2014 the name, Rumbula, where the killing was. And that, I\nam the only witness alive, of today. The only. I will show you in the corridor, I have\na little memorial there. So, how chasen \u2014 my mom \u2014 so we stay \u2014 we\u2019ll stay with\nthe officer. You know, every little thing maybe will be different. At least my mom\nhas both \u2014 both girls, you know. She was very happy. We are schneiderin and we\nshall stay. So, there was a running other woman, other woman, and it was a group\nwith about 200, or 150, I really don\u2019t remember. The people know each other from\na [indecipherable] shtetl, you know, you know each other. And so \u2014 so was, we\nstayed there behind the four fe \u2014 horses, beautiful horses, I will never forget these\nhorses. And they \u2014 there \u2014 the uniform what the \u2014 the Germans has, was like\nWehrmacht. This is a different German, the kind of. No Hakenkreuz. I really\nlooked at that, it was no Hakenkreuz. They was Wehrmacht officers, but they was\nofficers, definitely big \u2014 big shots. So, when the group was about 150 already, we\nmoved. The other, they moved. He \u2014 we \u2014 he took it out of that. They basically save\nus, kind of, in a way. So, he say, you follow me. This group goes on \u2014 this is the\nother group. You come after me, we will go ahead. So the four horses went the\nfront, and we went under. We was tired, and hungry, but we went, because weJanuary 24, 2010\nthought maybe this a good thing, maybe we\u2019 ll work as schneiderin, and that\u2019s very\ngood. So we walk and walk through the woods. It was all the same. They \u2014 they\nwent this way, we went this way. So we walk and walk and walk, and where we\nwalk, I am from Riga, I know every corner. It is the prison. It is Termin(ph) prison,\nthe name was Termin(ph), Termin(ph) prison, the name of the prison. The \u2014 the \u2014\nthat the \u2014 how you call that? The prison [indecipherable] get up \u2014 you know, it is\nfrom wood, such \u2014 with eyes that went up, and th-the \u2014 the horses and the people\nwere standing here, with all these 150 or 20, I don\u2019t remember how many, went in\nand \u2014 and this a [indecipherable] prison. I was never in prison, I didn\u2019t know, but\nyou know, you know how a prison looks, yes. But the four \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 this \u2014 the\nGermans on the four horses stayed outside. We never saw him. We never worked as\nschneiderinin(ph). Til today, I kn-know that they saved our lives, because they\ntook us away from the [indecipherable]. Otherwise we \u2014 we stayed in the line,\nbecause it were only lucky we \u2014 we stayed in the back. Otherwise, we would be\nkilled, like other people. So, now we\u2019re in the pri-prison. What are we going to do,\n150 people about, or 20, I don\u2019t know. So, usually in a prison when you are, you get\nyour own kamera with a little whatever. No, the Jews didn\u2019t get that. They took us\non \u2014 on top on the prison, with a open sky, and it was November, I remember that\nwas November. It was cold. It was very cold, and it \u2014 the waywer \u2014 the weather was\nJanuary 24, 2010\nwonderful, not snowing, and not raining. At that time in Latvia is always terrible\nsnow, and terrible rain. Nothing. So, we sit all together [indecipherable] to each\nother because it was cold. So we just \u2014 the little group what was there, we were \u2014\nhow you call that?",
        "A: On a roof, on the prison roof, on top. There was no cover, and we were so \u2014 the\nmoon, the \u2014 the \u2014 the stars we saw. But here it was a open place, how you call that,\nit wer \u2014 I don\u2019t know how you call. So we sit all together. And there is a other story.\nThe story is louse. The first time I saw a louse on me. And this \u2014 you know, I have\nepisodes to tell you. When you would hear my episode, you don\u2019t need me to do a\ninterview, because my episodes tells everything about me. So, the first \u2014 I\nremember I made \u2014 you know, I [indecipherable] how you call that in English?",
        "A: How you Say that?",
        "A: Crocheted. I crocheted. I had a back crocheted dress, along like that. And I was\ntired, so we lied down, it was just a floor, you know? Look at \u2014 it\u2019s open see \u2014 I see\nthat, the sky, and I say, why I am here, and you know, start \u2014 so I lie down, and I\nsee something white is coming just over me. And I \u2014 and I see that she comes to me.January 24, 2010\nAnd when she \u2014 she got big. I have never seen \u2014 that was a big louse, you know, I\ndidn\u2019t know this is a louse. I\u2014 when \u2014 when the louse was already about here, I start\nscreaming, a louse, a louse, help me, help me. So the girls get up and everybody\ncome to kill the louse. They found the louse, they kill the louse. But I had \u2014I saw a\nlouse. So I can imagine that we all had a lot of louses. And that was not everything.\nIn the middle of the night \u2014 so with \u2014 wi \u2014 we are no food, no nothing, we just \u2014\nsome \u2014 a fat Latvian was sitting outside the door to watch that \u2014 that we don\u2019t do\nsomething. So, it was \u2014 because, now God loved us. Because I believe in God. I \u2014 I\nreally start very religious after that. And that \u2014 the gi \u2014 that Latvian was standing\nou-out watching that we are. So, we \u2014 we lied down on the floor to sleep, and my\nmom was very happy because two girls, she has two girl \u2014 nobody had. There was a\nwoman crying, my kinder, meine kinder, meine kinder, meine kinder. And\nMama was very quiet and very happy because she has two children with her. So we\nhold together, and we \u2014 we lay li\u2014 on the floor, in a na \u2014 naked floor, we made \u2014\nmade \u2014 we sleep, we have to sleep. And 12 o\u2019clock at night is a scream, a cream,\nhelp me, help me. A baby is born in prison, between us. And \u2014 and you know, there\nis \u2014 th-the mother, you know, th-the-the girl was bor \u2014 it was a girl. And so we have\nto give it a name. But she had milk, the mother had milk, so she give. And the kid\nwas quiet, didn\u2019t \u2014 because we were s-so afraid that she \u2014 so we didn\u2019t have aJanuary 24, 2010\nloche(ph), so the mother gave her a finger, and she was like \u2014 and she was doing the\nfinger. So a\u2014 everybody was around, a baby, a baby born. And there was blood,\nand everything, so everybody gave \u2014 gave their shirts, you know, because we \u2014 we\nput the \u2014 the baby in the shirt, and wash it some kind water. We had water. It\u2019s \u2014\nthat moment I will never forget. This was such a horrible time, and we \u2014 everybody\nknow how the Germans will never let her live, never will they \u2014 how to how then?\nWhat to do? And we sit in \u2014 in a prison on the top of the prison, and here is the\nbaby. A baby was born by a woman. We didn\u2019t know that she is pregnant or\nanything. And that happened, and I see the baby. Wait, I gave her a name.\nTermina(ph), I gave her Termia(ph), because the name of the prison was\nTermia(ph). So I say, let\u2019s ta \u2014 give that name. Okay, the mom \u2014 and you know\nthat\u2019s either [indecipherable] it\u2019s usually this kind of a little ceremony. In the\nprison, we just \u2014 we just tried to help her. And \u2014 but she was a good woman, and\nshe was holding on nice. She had milk, so the baby had \u2014 was to eat, and we was\nlooking then that. So, I was [indecipherable], you know. I \u2014 I went to the door, to\nthe Latvian. I say, you know what, we need some food. Can you \u2014 he say \u2014 he was a\ngood Latvian, and I speak fluent Latvian. I ask him, you know, we need food. I\ndidn\u2019t tell about the ba \u2014 the child. He went home, and you know what he bring us?\nNot rice, be-beese(ph), beese(ph). It was dried out be-beese.January 24, 2010",
        "A: Beese(ph).",
        "A: You call it beese(ph) in English?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Yeah. So I took it. He gave me a \u2014 a whole sack. So he gave that \u2014 that \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 to all \u2014 the baby cannot eat that.",
        "A: But we \u2014 I gave it to everybody.",
        "A: Not what \u2014 what kind of food is that? It\u2019s no food. But then that man bring us\nbread later. That Latvian man, he say, I know that \u2014 what you are going through.\nAnd we just sit in the prison. We was two weeks in this prison.",
        "A: Now what \u2014 on the roof, sit \u2014",
        "A: Yeah that \u2014 the whole time. They didn\u2019t \u2014 they \u2014 we \u2014 we didn\u2019t know what jer \u2014\nwhat they have in their mind to do. Now, in that time, what was going on in the\nghetto. In the ghetto was two killings. I was in the first killing, and these soldiers\nsaved my life, and I sit in the prison. Now, in the ghetto, they bring us back in the\nghetto yeah, but what happened? Listen. The \u2014 the ghetto was already empty,\nbecause these people, 35,000 what I think it was, I don\u2019t know, was killed, but there\nwas a lot of clotheses, a lot of things what \u2014 so, th-the-the \u2014 they \u2014 the German\nofficer take us, th-these 150 back in the ghetto. That will be the second action. The\nsecond action. The first action, I was in the first action, but I didn\u2019t make it to\nkilling. But I saw all that. Now, they told everybody so \u2014 how many \u2014 yeah, they\nwas bringing German Jews from Germany also, and from Denmark. And they\ncame 1n also that their ghetto was empty. And we lived all together, I remember\nMom, my mom was happiest, she didn\u2019t say a word, she has two children with her,\nshe was happy. And then two other Jewish women lived in a room, we lived in a\nroom. And we was back in the ghetto, and we know there will be a other killing just\nthe same, a other killing. And I didn\u2019t tell my mother a word, and I think I am going\nto run away. I am going to run away. I am not go out \u2014 I have saw what is going to\nhappen to me. I don\u2019t want that. I am going to run away. And where am I going to\nrun, what am I going to do? But I am going to run away. I was a girl, not very big, IJanuary 24, 2010\n\u2014I later grow up, but I have to be dressed like a boy, like a man. Why? Because\nonly a group of men can go out to work. Only man they took, women did not work.\nAnd I remember clotheses, there was millions of clotheses. I put a terrible c-coat,\nand a man\u2019s Russian hat, you know, with \u2014 with fur, and I look like a boy, suppose\n\u2014 with \u2014 with the pants, supposed to look. And I was going out where people go\n[indecipherable] to wait til a group, to get in that group. To get in that group. And I\nsee and one group 1s gone, the other group is gone, and olg \u2014 and then the last\ngroup, I don\u2019t know, they help-helped me, and I went because they was all tall. I\nwas \u2014 they didn\u2019t \u2014 see, they so \u2014 they know what I am doing. They want say, take\noff the Mogen Dovid, take off the Mogen Dovid.
