        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Yes. My name is Isaac Bitton.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, March 31st, 1926. I was born in the hospital at Hiletia in\nLisbon.",
        "Q: Tell me about your family and about what it was like growing up in your family.",
        "A: My...my mother was born and raised in Farouh in the south of Portugal. And...uh...most\nof the Jewish people that came to Portugal towards the end of the 1700s and beginning of\nthe 1800s...uh...settled down in Farouh. And there was a very large community lodged\nand relatives over 126 families within approximately 100 years. By the 1900s they all\ndisappeared so that Portugal...uh...Farouh today is...there is no Jewish life. But my\nmother was born there. She moved to Lisbon with my grandparents which originally\ncame from...uh...uh... Morocco, Spanish Morocco and French Morocco. Therefore, my\nname Bitton which is a French, actually a French broken name. Uh...And of course my\nmother was married in Lisbon and...uh...we were five brothers and five sisters, 5 boys\nand 5 girls and...uh...I attended...the uh...the...uh...the schools in...1n\nLisbon...and...uh...the Jewish school...was a private Jewish school...uh...where we were\ntaught Hebrew so we could...uh...we could read...uh...the prayer books. Because my\nfamily came from a reasonable religious...uh...family. Not orthodox, but...uh...religious.\nAnd we all had to learn Hebrew and...uh...we did so. At home my...my grandparents,\nprimarily my grandmother spoke some Spanish and...uh...Lidino actually, and some of\nthe Portuguese. And...uh...basically, I...1 grew up amongst the Jewish community which\nwas very, very small at that time. There was not much activity amongst the Jew youth.\nThere was actually not too many youth in...1n Lisbon, Portugal. And...uh...my oldest\nbrother had actually begun to have some girl friends, not Jewish. My father was very\nupset about it and...uh...as I used to go to school to learn Hebrew by...uh...a lady that also\nwas a Moroccan...uh...Jewish teacher, she had in her...uh...l1ving room several pictures\nof...uh...of...uh...of Israel, of _ Israel at the time from the wailing wall and others.\nAnd...uh...I was always impressed by those pictures. Always! And that created in me a\ngreat desire at the time to...to go to Israel. Already from a little, early childhood. And\nsuddenly when the opportunity knocked in 1943, then I went to Israel. But in the\nmeantime, my Aunt Esther ____ Bitton, my father's sister, used to work at...uh...there was\na Portuguese soup kitchen primarily at the time used for the poor...the poor Jews of\nLisbon. And during the second world war, obviously this kitchen became very very\ninfluential in assisting the refugees to have one hot meal a day. And it was there that I\nreally began to...uh...hang around a lot of time simply because I was...uh...I was very\nimpressed by the various languages spoken. Uh...At the time I spoke Portuguese and a\nlittle bit of Spanish, but when you begin to hear Yiddish...lot of...lots of\nYiddish...uh...lots of German...uh... Hungarian, Czech. I remember families from\nCzechoslovakia. Uh... was always very impressed by...by these languages and...and\nuh...and I used to help...used to help buy...uh...the sitting....the sitting arrangement. There\nwere probably within the dozen tables...uh...each table would care approximately\nhundred...10... 10...uh...people so the dining room for the refugees was within...uh...150\npersons sitting capacity. And there was another small dining room which was for the\nPortuguese...uh...the Portuguese community. And next to the kitchen, soup kitchen was a\nJewish hospital. I was born in a Jewish hospital. So was my entire family. It was a very\nsmall hospital, but nevertheless they took care of...uh...of the Jewish community.\nSo...uh...and...uh...1t was during this period in history that...uh...one day while I was at\nthe soup kitchen I hear...one family walks i1n...several children, father and mother...very\nwell dressed, not dressed like a refugee as such...uh...with crumbly clothing, but really\nvery nice and neat...uh...and I...I asked the gentleman. I said...I fact I told him, \"Excuse\nme. This...this is for the refugees...this dining room.\u201d And he said...uh...uh... ... in\nPortuguese...he said, \"But we too are refugees.\u201d And...uh...I couldn't quite understand it. I\nwas a teenager at the time, but still...uh...I asked him, \"Why is that you are refugee.\nYou...you are Portuguese. How can you be a refugee.\u201d And...uh...he asked me to sit\ndown. And it was then that I...I met the very famous...uh...humanitarian, Dr. -\n_ who told me that he was the ex-consul of Portugal in Bordeaux, France. And he went\non to tell me that he had been expelled by the Portuguese government simply because he\nhad refused...he...he was asked to refuse to give...uh...uh...visas to the...to the Jewish\nrefugees. And...uh...as a result, of course, he was removed from his position. He was\ndisbarred because he was a lawyer by trade also, and removed from the diplomatic corps.\nAnd...uh..I met him in Lisbon at the soup kitchen within...I do not remember exactly if he\nwas 4 or a half a dozen. We spoke briefly. He was there in line standing with...uh...family\nto get his hot meal and...and to date I couldn't...I...1 never got out of my mind simply that\nthe..the men of his stature...of his caliber...uh...that had ...had really helped saved lives,\nwas punished in such manner by being removed from...from his...doing his job.\nAnd...uh...I was very impressed and these image always stayed with me. Uh...I...1...I don't\nbelieve I can really tell you a great deal more about Dr. because I met him such a short\nfew times. But I remember portions of the family. And...uh...uh...I remember the...the\nrefugees primarily more so that were there in most cases because they were the fortunate\nones that had received visas by Dr. in Bordeaux, France. Uh...I remember a family by the\nname of Deutsch, father, mother and two children who...they set up a shop in the most\nbusy street in Lisbon which is called the Sheadu. In fact, it was burned out recently. Was\non the portions of the city that was burned...ancient part of the Lisbon. And...uh... Mr.\nDeutsch used to put...uh...a table about maybe 3 by 3 and used to sell razor blades and\nother little things. And I help him bring them to the areas. I used to help also to bring the\nrefugees to some...some new residences since they were not quite familiar with Lisbon\nand I was quite familiar with Lisbon. Uh...There was another family...uh...by the name of\nGoostave Zumich...Zumich. He was from Czechoslovakia. Uh...Uh...He was a\nshoemaker, and he set up shop...uh...at the soup kitchen, one of the corners. And there he\nwould repair the shoes from the refugees. And...uh...I remember Mr. Brown who was\nalso a German Jew who...uh...was the liaison between the refugees and the\nJewish...uh...Portuguese community. He was in charge of... uh...uh...helping them\nto...uh...go and...uh...he was the one that would ask me at times, why...why don't you\nshow this person where such and such a street is and so forth and so on. And...uh...I\nremember a family by the name of, I believe Grallman, who...uh...uh...whose lady\nhad...uh...uh... a very small little girl, a child, but she became quite ill. She was\nhospitalized in Lisbon....uh... for I believe was mental stress. And my Aunt Esther, God\nbless her soul, took care of her daughter for a given period of time and for as long as she\nwas hospitalized prior to moving to Israel. Later on, since we traveled on the same ship to\nIsrael...uh...the family asked me to join their own family in Nahartyya in a little farm,\nwhich I did. That's how come I arrived in Nahariyya. It was through the Grallman family.\nAnd...uh...basically...uh...sometimes when I remember of the...uh...the...uh...the\nincidences...you know, you are a young man and...uh...up to that point in time in history,\nlife in Portugal as such and Lisbon was quite uneventful for a young man.\nAnd...uh...suddenly when all these refugees start to come in...uh...1t was very exciting. I\ncould not understand what they were saying in most cases, but they would...uh...they\nwould come to this soup kitchen a little before noon. If it was an hour before, and they\nwould...in groups...you could sit them right in the...uh... the ____ and ____ 1n Lisbon is\nstill today a street that has no end, you know. It...is two little corners like. You must turn\naround to come out. And...uh...they would walk around there, talking about problems,\nfamilies, the anxiety, what happened to other members of the family because they did not\nknow. They hadn't heard from them. Uh...And...uh...this to me was all very exciting\nand...uh...as a matter of fact, 1t reinforced in me even more so my wants to...to go to\nIsrael. And...uh...1t was at some point in time that we met...uh... members\nof...uh...the...uh...Sofnut that came from Lisbon to ...uh...uh...help the refugees to\nimmigrate to Israel.",
        "Q: Could we hold it for a second?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Can you give me a picture. We've moved fairly quickly. Give me a picture of what\nhappened. What was Portugal like when the war broke out? How was it different from\nwhat had happened before?",
        "A: During the second world war?",
        "Q: Yes. When...for you. For you!",
        "A: For me?",
        "Q: What did you see. Besides the refugees, when the war broke out, what changes did you\nsee. What was your...was your life any different?",
        "A: Well, since you asked...since you asked...uh...uh... (clearing throat), there was a time\nduring the war that in the north of Portugal, they had found wolfrum. And that's some\ntype of a metal. I do not know that much about it. But it's sometime of a metal that you\nmust mix...uh... with other metals...uh...specifically for armory. And, of course...uh...that\nbecame very, very exciting all over Portugal. And many people just left the town and\nwent to the north to try to work on the wolfrum mines. And, of course, being an\nadventurer myself...uh...me and a few friends, we decided that it was the time for us to go\nand dig wolfrum too. So...uh...we...we went there, but we were very...most unsuccessful.\nNo sooner than we were there, we turned around and came back to Lisbon because, of\ncourse, we had no...no...no means...no...no money. And...uh...however little money we\nhad...uh...didn't last that long, and I came back, of course...uh...very, very broken-hearted\nthat I did not make a million escudos on the wolfrum mines. But...uh...that was an\nexciting thing. And as much as life generally speaking in Lisbon at the time for as far as I\ncan remember...uh...other than going to school at the time, I...uh...being a member of a\nlarge family and my father, at the time...uh....God bless his soul, was working for the\nPortuguese printing department of the Portuguese government. And he certainly did not\nearn that much money either. So...uh...it was up to us...the growing up children to help\nthe family. So, other than school, we would pick up whatever job we could, me and my\nbrothers. And...uh... I was involved in the dismantling, believe it or not, of World War I\nmines and...uh...we had a little wrench. There must have been a million bolts and nuts in\nthese mines, and we spent all day unknotting these...these things. Uh...Another job that I\ntook was...uh...working on ships by derusting the ballast of the ships. You know, if you're\nfamiliar with the ship ballasts, they're little oval holes at the bottom of the ship, and you\ngo in with a little swimming suit and you go with your feet and your head and your...your\narms and you stay there all day with a little hammer, and all you do is knock down the\nrust that accumulates in these little cubicles, You know, they're very small cubicles.\nUh...That was another part of a job. And I did other minuscule jobs and working\non...uh...helping to manufacture of...uh...bicycle, painting, etc. And...uh...by and large,\nthe...uh...there was an exciting period in Lisbon. I remember the...uh...uh...there would be\na...practically every day in the newspapers some story about someone being killed. A spy\nor...or some activity...foreign activities...uh...1n Lisbon. And there is another thing that I\nused to do with my friends. We used to go to the German Consulate. And they had\nalways literature. Tons of literature! They would give away propaganda about Germany.\nSo we, of course, very diligently used to take as much as we could, and the moment we\nwere out we used to toss it out in the garbage. So...uh...this was one of the things that we\ndid...uh...for some obvious reasons...uh...actually. Another one function that I\nhad...uh...was a neighbor of ours had a little shoe...uh...horse shoe shop. He was a big, big\nman and...uh...he couldn't read or write. And...uh...he always...whenever I came back\nfrom school, it was my function to come to him and read to him the newspaper and what\nwas happening in the world. Because I used to like to read a lot. And...uh...and somehow\nor another we...we became very good friends, you know. And here was this big fellow.\nHe couldn't read. I could never understand why he couldn't read either. But he was an\nolder gentleman. And he was still doing the horse shoes...uh... in his shop. Blacksmith? I\ndon't know how you call exactly, but...uh... So, by and large...uh...other than our going\nevery...we had to go every night to the temple because my father...uh...my father insisted\nthat we go to the temple every day...every night. You cannot come home unless you've\nbeen to the temple to the services. And...uh...every Friday night obviously...Saturdays,\nwe used to go to temple. So we conducted a reasonably...uh... I would say a moderate\nJewish life. And...uh...our house was...was, of course...uh...kosher. My father was quite\nkosher. And ...uh...we had a very large family, as I said...uh...uh... five boys and five\ngirls. Although two of them were born...I...one girl...my youngest sister, Rachel, was\nborn after I left Portugal. And I did not meet her until 17... when she was 17. And my\nbrother, Jacob, was...uh... few months old when I left for...for __, Israel. So...",
        "Q: Did you feel...how did you feel being a Jew in Portugal once the war...once the war had\nbroken out?",
        "A: My only memories in this case is...uh...I didn't feel any...uh...truthfully...from the part of\nthe Portuguese, I had no...no feelings that there were anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish or\nanything like that. Never had that feeling while I was in Lisbon. That's the truth.\nUh...But...uh...by being in...uh...on a...almost on a daily basis, mixed with the Jewish\nrefugees for a given period of time, that in itself inspired in me more so the desire really\nto go to Israel. Number one, to go to Palestine and to join the British Army, and go and\nfight the Nazis, which I did as a matter of fact.",
        "Q: Tell us about that. You started to say...you had started to tell us about the Sofnut. Tell us\nabout the refugees and _Sofnut. What happened?",
        "A: Certainly. Well, once we...uh..we...uh...we left Portugal, our first stop was...",
        "Q: Excuse me. We have to back up. If you would please, tell us why...you were now in\nLisbon.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And the Sofnut came to Lisbon.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Tell us what they did and tell us what you did.",
        "A: Well, basically, the...uh...uh...as far as I can remember, they came in to...uh...help number\none, to bring all the children...refugees children primarily were the number one to go\non..uh...on the registration to go to Israel. And then came grown-ups. So families with\nchildren, of course, were the first ones. And they asked the Jewish community also if\nthere were any members of the Jewish community in Lisbon that wished to immigrate\nto...uh...to ..to __, Israel. And I... and my brother were the first ones to...uh...join. Uh...In\nfact...uh...[ must say that my father at the time did not like the idea that we were going to\nleave Portugal. But I told him that I wanted to go to Israel. There was no Jewish life in\nPortugal, no Jewish youth. There was no girlfriends. At 16 a young man wants to have a\ngirlfriend. And...uh...there was no such thing. And...uh...there were...there were, of\ncourse, many girls, but not...not Jewish. And...uh...I.....] had very, very strong...uh...will\nthat I wanted to marry within the Jewish faith and have Jewish children as well, and\ncontinue my Jewish life. That was really something that I always had since childhood.\nAnd I think as I mentioned before, I was very much impressed by the...uh...photographs\nfrom the...from __, Israel, the wailing wall, etc. And Musrabano and other pictures that\nthe teacher had on the wall. So we then registered with the government of Portugal. We\nhad to pay some fees to...uh...so that we wouldn't have to go to the military, etc.,\nand...uh...we left for Palestine. I do not remember the exact date, sometimes end of 43\naboard the ship Niasa...was a steamship, a Portuguese steamship. And...uh...there was\nseveral hundred children and adults, refugees. And...uh...our first stop was about a\nday...within a day, we stopped in Cadiz, Spain. In Cadiz, Spain, the ship picked up\nseveral hundred Jewish children again. And it was there that I met...uh...a fellow from the\nJewish community in Lisbon. His name was ___\u2014\u2014__\u2014~ who _~with his brother, Samuel,\nwere in charge of the...uh...uh...uh... removal of Jewish children from the border of\nFrance into Spain into Portugal and into Israel. Uh...Again...uh... knew very well...uh..Dr.\nbecause apparently there were visas some received from this gentleman through ___.\nOkay? So that was the last time that I saw ____ alive. He and his brother worked for\nthe Jewish community of Lisbon in conjunction with the American Joint Committee to\nsave the Jewish children. So...uh...we (clearing throat) we went to...uh...we...uh...went to\nIsrael or to Palestine.",
        "Q: Excuse me. Tell me about the ship. I would like to know what it was like for you on the\nship with the refugee children and what you did. What effect it had and there was an\nincident that you had told me about.",
        "A: Right. It was...I cannot remember the names of this young man, but...uh...uh...as a matter\nof fact in my life, I was directly and indirectly involved in saving five lives. But he was\naboard the Niasa, that...uh...the first thing that happened was...the Niasa had to take a\nlarge deviation because of the second world war as it was in...at that point in time quite\nactive, there was...the...the specifically, the German...uh...uh...U-Submarines were in the\nMediterranean and as a result, we had to... only remember that we were advised that the\nship would have to make a deviation because of Germany submarine activity.\nUh...Although we...we...ourselves did not see any submarines. But we did pick up a time\nwhen there was very, very rough seas. And people, of course, were feeling not quite well,\nand everybody was running up to...to the top even though they were not...you were\nadvised not to because it was reasonably dangerous. So I was going up to the deck\nand...uh...a young child I would say within 10 to 12 years old also was in a hurry\napparently to relieve himself and...uh...he was caught by a wave. And...uh...don't ask me\nhow. I only know that I dove to this child and I was able to grab him while I was\ngrabbing myself also to the rails. And meantime his mother was very...uh...excited and\nshe called the father which was a little further below the steps. And...uh...he came in a\nhurry too and to help me, and we brought, you know. This...This takes a few seconds\nbecause here comes the wave and...and...and just came through the deck and there he\nwas. And I grabbed him and so we came down there and there was no water any more or\nanything. And the father....I will never forget it. Uh...He jumped at my feet, and he\nwanted to kiss my feet because I saved...I saved his child. Now, you know, it's one of\nthese things. You know, he could...maybe he would never gone overboard, but he could\nhave gone overboard as well. So...uh...I do not remember their names. I do not\nknow...once we landed in Israel, I don't know whatever happened to them because they\nwent in different directions and...uh...uh... But nevertheless, life on board ship for the\napproximately 1 week that we spent that normally would take within 3 to 4 days, but it\ntook a little longer because of that...those deviations that...uh...the ship had to make in the\nMediterranean...Mediterranean. But we...uh...landed in Haifa. Life was not that exciting\non board. You know, it...uh...people would sit again in corners talking about what\nhappened, wishing, willing, what happened to the families, etc. in...uh...1n...uh...in...uh...\nAlso, sort of type of permanent...permanent...uh...anxiety. That's the only way I can\ndescribe it, you know. There was I would say...uh...many sighs of relief when...when the\nword Israel, the land of Israel. I remember that when all of a sudden they say land, land,\nland. And there was Haifa __ Israel. That was a word that was very, very striking to\neverybody. Because everybody...all you hear at that time was Israel, Israel, and I could\nnot understand what they were talking about. It was Polish or Yiddish or German. But\nyou could hear all the time Israel, the word Israel. That I remember. We were unloaded\ninto a...uh...buses and immediately brought to...uh...it was some sort, if you wish, of a\nconcentration camp in Atleit. I don't know within 10 to 15 miles from Haifa, south of\nHaifa. And...uh...I asked, \"What are we doing in here?\" It's like a concentration camp.\nBarbed wire with security police everywhere...uh...Arabs, Jews, British. And...uh...the\ncamp was divided into two sections for...one for men and one for women. And later on\nwe found out that...uh...because or due to strong activity from the Fifth Column...the\nGerman Fifth Column they had to do a series of interviews and they asked everyone and\nthey checked the papers, etc. So we stayed in that Atleit within...uh...a couple of weeks.\nThe conditions were not the best, but they were fair. The Sofnut was there to help us.\nAnd...uh...from there on, most of us were moved to a little...uh...a little quarters outside\nHaifa by the name of ____. And there was worse because the conditions there\nwere...everybody was mixed, men, women, children. There was no beds. We...uh...they\ndidn't expect apparently that large number of people at the time and they were not\nprepared. And...uh...as a result we slept for a few days on...on the floor with blankets, etc.\nThen...uh...the...the youth were moved to a camp in Carmel in Haifa, the\n. And it was there that...uh...I had the great privilege and the honor of meeting the great\nlady of the Youth Aliyjah Movement, Henrietta Solt. And she was a lovely lady, God bless\nher soul, who...uh... I talked to her personally too. She talked to each one of us,\nwelcoming us to ____ Israel. And...uh...some of us we were already above desirable age\nto stay in the Youth...with the Youth Movement. And I was one of them. So I then was\nmoved from the ______\u2014\u2014to Kibbutz BitAlfa. And here I must say that...uh...I could\nnot get used to life in a kibbutz. I just couldn't. Uh...I was too...uh...you know, full of\naction, you know. And...uh...I wanted to join the British Army. I wanted to join the war,\nnot...I didn't come over here to be in a kibbutz, you know. So my brother, Abraham,\nstayed in the kibbutz and my cousin, ____, God bless him. He also passed away in\nIsrael. Uh...They...they stayed in there. And...uh...I went to...uh...to join the British Army\nin Haifa, the British Joint Office. Uh...Once I filled all the papers, I was advised that\nbecause when they asked me for my papers, I gave them my Portuguese passport that I\narrived legally. So I was advised by the...by the lieutenant in charge...he said, \"I'm sorry,\nSir. You can't join the British army. Portugal is a neutral country.\u201d So I said, \"Okay.\u201d I\nleft and I joined the...at the time was in Haifa talking to some other friends in there, I\njoined the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad Division. And this time my cousin also\njoined. He came back from the kibbutz also. He couldn't manage there. And...uh...so we\nboth joined the PPRD. But I did not like the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad\nDIvision. What we did was simply night guards. We had to be with the rifle or the\ncarbine by the railroad or be escort to the British...uh...payroll, etc. And it was not what I\nwanted. I wanted to go to war. That was my main thing. So I decided to...uh...go to\nSarafan, which was the largest British joint group...army...uh...camp. (clearing throat)\nAnd again I fill out the papers and...uh...when I was asked for my...uh...uh...papers...how\ndid I came to Palestine, I said, \"I haven't got any papers.\u201d How did you come in? \"I'm an\nillegal.\u201d And I wrote in this time in my...1n my...my papers that I was born in Sofia,\nBulgaria. As a native of Bulgaria, of course...uh...Bulgaria was at war too, so was no\nlonger neutral (clearing throat) and...uh...speaking to some other friends...uh...we\nrealized, of course, that the British they speak English. And not once was I asked about if\nI speak Bulgarian. Which I don't! But...uh...so...1t was in this manner that I was able to\njoin the...the British army. So we spent some time in Sarafan...the camp, and then we\nwere moved to the Jewish Brigade group...uh...training camp in...uh...[smailia in Egypt.\nWe were part of the ITD...the Infantry Training Depot. And, of course, we were trained\nby British...uh... officers and also by...uh...Jewish officers. So we spent several months in\ntraining in infantry accelerated training because at the time the British army...the Jewish\nBrigade group because they wanted us to have a very fast training. The Jewish Brigade\ngroup had seen some action in the front in Italy at the time. And...uh...of course, I never\nsaw any action in the front. The end of the war came while I...we were still in Egypt.\nSo...uh...we were then moved to Europe. We left Alexandria aboard a British troop\ncarrier, Escanya, if I remember right, and from there, of course, we were designated to\nthe different...uh...Jewish Brigade...uh...unit. I was assigned to the second battalion of the\nJewish Brigade group. And shortly thereafter, I was transferred to the corps of military\npolice of the Jewish Brigade. (clearing throat) And we saw duties in Antwerp. We had\nour main station in Antwerp in Belgium. And it was there that...uh...I really had some\nfirst impact with dispersed persons that...people that came from the camps. Not the\nrefugees that were able...that were fortunate to run away and arrive in Lisbon somehow in\na reason...reasonably healthy manner. I'm talking about a dispersed person that survived\nthe camps. They came out. They were skin and bones. Okay? And...uh...as a member of\nthe Jewish Brigade, our uniforms were part of the British...uh...uniforms. The only\ndifference was that we had our patches and we had the Star of David in gold\nwith...uh...two whites and...uh...uh...blue...uh...stripes and...uh...1t was in Antwerp and we\nused to do a lot of duty at...uh...train station that the group of dispersed persons came in.\nThey came out of the train, and I don't know if they came from Germany or from where\nthey came from, but...uh...1t was several of us...MPs, military police....and when they saw\nthe Star of David, there was one of the most __ things I ever experienced in my life. They\ncame to you, and they kissed the Star of David. And they was saying in Yiddish,\n_.. They didn't believe that. And it was very, very touching. So I spent some time\nin...uh...in Antwerp, and...uh...then we went to Eindhoven in Holland to a...uh...R and R\ncamp. We spent some time there. And...uh...of course, this is after the war.\nUh...And...uh...the Jewish Brigade at the time was not doing much of anything officially.\nUnofficially, the Jewish Brigade group or part of it or portion of it were very,\nvery...uh...diligently working in moving...uh...dispersed persons from one place to\nanother place. It reminds, perhaps, of the story of...uh...the Jewish Brigade group was like\na duck that...uh...you only see the smooth sailing on...on above the water, but below\nwater they peddle like Hell so to speak. And that's what was happening. The...uh...the\nJewish Brigade group...uh...I'm assuming in conjunction with the Haganah and...uh...the\nAliyah Bet and I'm sure you know the meaning of Aliyjah Bet. Uh...There was the\nconvention immigration and the unconvention immigration. And the unconvention\nimmigration was what we call today or we called then Alijah Bet. Uh...so that it would be\ndistinguished from the convention immigration. Because the British mandate, at the time,\nin Palestine did not wish...did not want to allow any more Jews to come to Palestine on a\nvariety of grounds that they believed in. But...uh...but, of course, the Jewish agency\nbelieved in...in otherwise. And the Jewish agency, of course, had other ideas. And as a\nresult, the Alyjah Bet was created. So...uh...there were many a times that...uh...1n our\ncamp, for instance, there was a time that over night there was\nseveral...uh...several...uh...tents that overnight had been erected in our...in...inside the\ncamp. So for anyone on the outside looking at...at the army camp, another half a dozen\ntents wouldn't mean much of anything. Uh...Certainly, we were advised at the time that,\nyou know, leave them along so to speak. They are dispersed persons in these tents. The\nreason is, of course, that the British mandate at the time...the British\ngovernment...uh...with the assistance of the...uh...their various intelligence units...with\nthe assistance of the British Royal Air Force, the British Navy, they had a blockade of\nPalestine not to allow any Jews to enter. And...uh...the Jewish Agency had no choice, but\nto try to evade their...their investigations. Where are the Jews coming from? Where are\nthey being loaded? On what ships, etc., etc.?? What ports, etc., etc.? So...uh...that's when\nthe Jewish Brigade was of much help by using the military vehicles in transporting the\nrefugees from one town to another town or if it's from another country, from...if it's\nfrom...from Holland to Belgium or to Italy or...or France, etc. So this involvement\nactually was...uh...ultimately was found out somehow, and the British government, of\ncourse, dismissed the entire Jewish Brigade.",
        "Q: Were you involved in any of this?",
        "A: No. I...I was not directly involved. No. Not at all. No. I was only by...by virtue of\nbeing...of serving with the Corps of Military Police of the Jewish Brigade. I do know\nthat...uh...there was...uh...every...every vehicle...army vehicle had a log. And in this log,\nof course, you have to write the moment you leave your camp, where you going, who 1s\nfor, dut dut dut da. So...uh...they used to..to write in their logs when they were moving\nrefugees three letters in English. T-T-G. And actually the meaning...uh...is...uh... Hebrew,\nArabic, and Yiddish, which means _____\u2014_\u2014.\u00ab~ Which means 1f...1f you pardon me, up your\nrear end business. That's what it meant. The reason that they wrote TTG on their...on\ntheir...on these log sheets was when and if they would be stopped by some of the\nAllied...uh... policemen on the frontiers, etc....uh...when the read, if it's British police and\nthey read TTG on it, that sounds...even though it's a Jewish Brigade convoy...20 convoys\nor 30 vehicles, etc...uh...they're not going 1n to see what's inside. Fortunately, for us, they\nwouldn't because if they would have lift the...the gate, so to speak, you'll see that there\nwas women, children, refugees being moved around. From one port to another port, etc.\nSo this part was very exciting. I knew it about it. I was not involved directly with this.\nUh...I was indirectly involved because, for instance, after spending some time in Europe\nin the British Army in the Jewish Brigade group, you are entitled to a vacation home. So\nan Isaac Bitton, in fact, went home on vacation. But the real Isaac Bitton never left,\nsimply because the...uh...again...the...the Jewish agency had trained younger men,\nrefugees to be able...how to hold...uh...the ____ the way the British army does or way\nthe Jewish Brigade does. How to eat, etc. etc. Uh...some Hebrews words in the event\nthey would be questioned, but otherwise they went home on vacation. They never came\nback. They stayed there. But Isaac never left, say Antwerp, either. And then suddenly Ike\nis back from vacation. You understand? And...and the other Isaac stayed in Israel. So in\nthis manner, many refugees also arrived in Israel with...uh...with\nfalse...uh...army...uh...army papers, army documents. So that's the only time that I was, if\nyou wish, indirectly involved with the Aliyah Bet. Uh...of course, the end of the Jewish\nBrigade came about 1946. We were dismissed. And we went back. And it was prior to\nliving in Antwerp and that one evening I...uh...I took a...uh...an electrical train in the city\nand to my great surprise, there was Brigadeer Benjamin. Brigadeer Benjamin was a....was\na British Jew who was commanding the Jewish Brigade group. And it appears that he had\nnever been informed officially of the underground activities that the Jewish Brigade was\ndoing at the time in Europe. And as a result he...uh...he was just totally demoralized if\nyou wish, prior to the...to the... when we all left...the Jewish Brigade left Europe. And\nBenjamin would be just...1 saw him more than one occasion walking around in town. But\nI met him personally in the electrical train. I had to salute, of course. He was a Brigadeer\nGeneral and...uh...but we didn't speak. He was a very, very reserved man at that time. So\nI do not know from there on...uh...I never heard that he went to visit Israel or even if he\never went to Israel, but he was very upset about the whole thing. Uh...But the\nmeantime...the main...the main...the main point was to save and bring as many Jews to\nIsrael as possible. And that was something that the Haganah did...uh...the Alyat Bet did\nvery well. And...uh...so we were disbanded, discharged pretty much. We went to Egypt\nagain, and from Egypt we were...we stayed in some camps for a short period of time and\nwe went to...we were discharged in Sarafan also officially and...uh...received our\ncivil...civilian garments and little bit pay, etc., and we were free men again, so to speak.\nOut of the...out of the Army. Out in the streets. And...uh...1mmediately, when I went back\nin Nahartyya, of course, we joined the...all of us joined the Haganah underground\nbecause the word at the time was that...uh...things did not go that good for...in Palestine.\nThe...uh... (clearing throat)...when it came to...was the beginning of the...uh...the\nproblems...the...uh...the...the war, of course, if you did not travel in a convoy, then the\nchances of going from a place A to place B alive was...was very difficult. And...and it\nwas here that I came quite involved in the...in the underground...1n the Haganah\nbetween...uh... primarily between Haifa and Nahariyya and the Western Galilee. We used\nto meet convoys going south in Shavatsion, a few kilometers south of Nahariyya\nand....uh...and take as many cars as possible and...uh...1n each one of the vehicles was at\nleast one person, one member of the Haganah which was armed. Now if it was a girl...it\nwas many of the girls that...that were also armed or if it was a boy...either if he were\nsitting on top of the truck or in the bus or in the car or in a motorcycle, etc....uh...that was\na safe way for us to travel at the time. And coming back in the late afternoon...early\nevening during the daylight, we would...uh...we would all congregate in the ____. , you\nknow, next to Haifa, and because between _____ and Haifa was reasonably safe with\nthe exception of the refineries in which...uh...there was a very, very...uh... very serious\nincident. Uh...One time...uh...the...at lunch time, a car went by and while all the Arabs\nand even some Jews that used to work in the refineries were sitting outside having lunch,\nsomebody threw some bombs. Uh...As far as I can understand...uh...of course, the Arabs\nblamed the Jews. The Jews blamed the British. And...uh... the facts remains is that the\nArabs were so angry...uh...at this attack that the massacred every Jew that worked with\nthem. For years, they used to work together. For years and years! No matter how...all of a\nsudden, bingo. I don't think there was...if there was a half dozen Jews that came out of\nalive of the...Haifa refineries. They were all massacred. And on the same evening, the\nPALMA by orders of the high command of the Haganah took action, only with cold\narms, no hot arms...they went into the Arabic village right outside Haifa...uh...where most\nof these Arabs came from, and they...they really fortunately enough...there was no men\non that evening in the village. They all had escaped because they knew\nthat...that...uh...the Haganah was after them. I do not know exactly what...what happened\nafter that, but the...the fact remains that it was a very...at the beginning of the war...the\nwar...this...of the problems. SO we...we used to congregate in Keathim, and from there on\nagain we used to travel all together to...uh...to...uh...Nahartyya.",
        "Q: Excuse me. Did you see the results of any of this PALMA or the fighting? You were not\nthere?",
        "A: No. No. You mean at the...uh...at the...uh...the refineries.",
        "Q:",
        "A: No. No. No. But I tell you one time...on two different occasions, I arrived late to the\nconvoy, and I lost the convoy. Once was going south. And I was alone. No...I beg your\npardon. I was...I was alone, and then I picked up a fellow who was a mechanic, Heim\nYenkel, was his name...was a mechanic in Nahariyya. And he sat next to me, and we\nworked to the city of Akko, but he was uneventful. There was no problem. However, on\nanother occasion coming back when...when just shortly before the war really started and\nthings were getting a little tougher...uh...several people had been killed in\nAkko...that...one by a...in a motorcycle. They tried to cross Akko alone, so to speak, by\ncar, by bicycle, and they never made it. So one time I arrived...uh...a little late, and my\nwife, at the time, was pregnant and I...I...] had to go, get home. And...uh...certainly, I\nalways had a gun with me, a 45 pistol liberata, Italian hand gun. But...uh...since I was\ndriving at the time a Volvo...it was an old truck, and I had on...on my truck I\nhad...uh...flour for the bakery, and a variety of other products. So I took my Arabic...uh...\nhead dress which I used to carry with me because since I'm quite dark featured, I could\npass very easily as an Arab. I put my head Cafia on and...uh...when I arrived at the gates,\nthey had this...we called this Spanish donkeys...is barbed wire on...uh...cross...uh...horses\nyou know. And we used to call it Spanish donkeys. And...uh...when I came to the city of\nAkko, the entrance to this...to this gate, I just put my head of the...my cab, and I shouted\nin Arabic, \"____\u2014.\u201d \"Open the gate. Open the gate.\u201d And the...the guy looked at me and\nopened the gate and I just kept on going, and I was never stopped. But...uh...you can do\nthese things when you are 20-some. (Laughing) Today, probably I wouldn't do that.\nUh...I was very fortunate too, but...uh...then, of course, the...uh...the war began pretty\nmuch very quickly, and...uh...I was...uh...with the....1 was with the Fish in the Haganah,\nand then I became...uh...Sergeant Major in the Israeli army, and I was pretty much\nstationed in the western Gaililee, in Nahariyya and in north. But at the beginning of the\nwar, something that sometimes people wonder, \"How did you do it. How...How did Israel\ndeceive them.\u201d Now, you are attached by so many armies surrounding you, and how did\nyou do it? One of the things that we did, we excavated roads between Nahariyya\nand...and...uh...frontier of Lebanon, which was about 7...5, 7 kilometers north of\nNahariyya, and...uh...we excavated in a zigzag for miles up to the road where was the\nKibbutz Hineta, so that one evening, by command of the Haganah, we took every car,\nevery bus, every motorcycle we had. Now there was no arms at the time other...other than\nthe Haganah itself. There was no army at the time. That was before the...the great\nshipment of Czechoslovakian arms came to Israel. This is all before that...that period. We\ntook out all these buses...the things with full lights and we drove toward the frontier.\nOkay\u2019? And so if you are sitting on the top of the mountain and you're looking down like\nthe Arabs were at the time at the frontier of Lebanon in Israel, whoever...there was some\narmy there. Of course, not...nothing of any great numbers but there were some. And\nthey're looking down and you see all these lights coming in. They would say,\n_. \"The Israelis are bring the entire army over here.\u201d Well, we did. We drove with lights\non. We turned around underneath the mountain where they could not see. There was\nlarge growths of...of olives, and we turned around and came back without lights. And we\nturned around again and came back with lights. You know, in with lights on, back\nwithout lights. And we did this for a given period of time. But for your information, there\nwas only one time that we found out that it was a few Arab tanks that came down from\nHorshineka, Russ,and Nicura, down into the section of the road to Hineta, and they\nturned around and back they went again. They never dare to go beyond that point. And,\nlet me tell, if they had there was nothing to hold them like I said. So in this case, the\nHaganah...uh... used a lot of...of strategy of faked...uh...movements which was very\nsuccessful in illuding the enemy at the time...uh...from advancing, because they did not\nknow what was expected from...from them. And...uh...but...uh...at this point in\ntime...uh...I'd like also to talk to you about an experience just very, very shortly before\nthis...the war started, there was a convoy going to Yesshiam, Kibbutz Yesshiam.\nYesshiam was the name of a young man by the name of Yesshiam Vis, who was a meter\nof the PALMA, special forces of the Israeli...uh... Haganah. And...uh...Yesshiam Vis was\namongst the detachment of...uh... PALMA that involved in operation bridges. In 1947, the\nHaganah decided to build, to blow up every bridge...every bridge that was connecting at\nthe time the land of Israel so to speak and all the other Arab countries.\nAnd...uh...so...uh...1t was very effective. The main purpose, I understand,\nwas...uh...uh...just to show that...uh... we can take care of ourselves, and also some sort of\na warning also toward the Arabs, you know, that...\"Don't attack.\u201d It didn't maybe work,\nbut said don't attack us. Leave us alone. Let us be. Unfortunately, there is a legend about\nthe...the...Yeeheim Vis. The bridge they were supposed to blow up was in...uh...was\ncalled Asiv, which goes back to the Finnishian times. It's a little bridge.\nAnd...uh...uh...the legend is that...uh... the...uh...from some Arabs later on we found out\nthat there was a group of British army...uh...soldiers. There was a British army camp not\ntoo far away from Asiv, that...uh... was...apparently, they were doing some sort of\nmanuevers in the middle of the night unbeknown to the group. And as a result, they were\nambushed. Since every...and each of one these young men carried the...the dynamite,\nexplosives with them. Uh...There was...not a thing was found from them. Absolutely\nnothing! They just disappeared. Was about 8 if I remember correctly. And today there is\na memorial to...uh...Yeeheim Vis in Asiv by the bridge. And...uh..before the war, there\nwas an American...as a matter of fact, an American group of young men and women that\nbuilt a kibbutz in Asiv, by the name of Asiv...American...I was there on the\ncommemoration with General Adror at the time. But in the meantime the...",
        "Q: We need to stop at this point and change tapes.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In...in the meantime, actually, the Jewish Agency decided...uh...to honor the name of\nYeeheim Vis. His father was at the time, I believe, a high official in the Jewish Agency.\nSo...uh...in the Western Galilee, there was too much openness actually, especially coming\nin from the mountains...uh.. So they decided...the Jewish Agency decided to build two\nkibbultzes. It was just shortly before the war started. And one of them is named, today, of\ncourse, Yeehim. I'm quite familiar with the area because _Yeehim if you go back\nto...uh...to several years ago, used to be called ____\u2014\u2014\u2014sin Arabic. And there was an\nArab...a very, sort of a stronghold. But it was abandoned. There was no one there\nactually. And...uh...so the Sofnut decided to build a kibbutz at____\u2014_\u2014sd by honoring the\nname of Yeehim. And...uh...this was done. Next door was built another kibbutz\nand...uh...uh...uh...I believe was Gotton. I cannot quite remember the name, but I\nremember that I was there at the time. And this kibbutz was built already under\nfire...under Arabic fire because...uh...you could...1t was a very...1t was a very excitable\nday because here were the Haganah putting up little sheds and so forth, girls making\nfood, and here these guys were shooting down from...from the...from a spot called the\nMountain of the...the Tree Mountain. Because was in above the higher level. And...uh...I\ncan't remember exactly all the names in Hebrew any more, but it's...was like a tree\nbecause there was a large tree there. And...uh...that's basically how come that this kibbutz\nYeeheim came about, to honor Yeeheim Vis, basically. And we used to go...uh...prior to\nthe war...uh...the Haganah used to train and we used to bring arms, ammunitions, and\nfood to kibbutz _Yeeheim.. We used to walk for 4 and a half hours from Nahariyya to\nYeeheim because you go up to the mountains and you have to walk to____, and you\nhad to bypass small Arab villages and you had to do it...uh...all night long pretty much\nand you had to do it to such an extent so that you would not create too much noise. If you\nhad...uh...a squad, which is equivalent to a British army squad of 11 men and the officer,\nuh...we...uh...we used to have different squads going to different areas. And...uh.... also to\nmake a mock attacking, attacking YYeeheim_ because we expected there wwould be\nproblems as...as... as the kibbutz would be...be put in there. And there were many\nproblems. They were...they were attacked many times. But...uh...obviously, the attacks\ncould not come from the _ because there was no shape, or form that as you were\nclimbing this...this...this high mountain, big so to speak...uh...you always made noise, no\nmatter how careful you are. You could hear it. You could hear it way a way before you\nwere...uh...inside. They could hear the noise already. So basically that's what happened\nin...the __. And from there, of course...uh...we...uh...(clearing throat) ...uh...there was a\nconvoy where I lost my...my very best friends. I used to live at the time...shortly before\nthat I used to live with a family by the name of Shinerman. And...uh...there was two boys\nand a girl. Moses, Alisa, and Salome Shinerman. And...uh... There was a convoy at one\ntime. an armed convoy...that's when the conflicts already had started in\n19...uh...beginning of 48...uh...that...uh... they took...1t was a bus and several trucks, and a\npickup truck. The pickup truck had a...had a device like in V shape that had a wheel and\nthis device would be lowered to the road and it would push any any stones that the Arabs\nused to block because they used to block the...the roads all the time. It was very easy to\ndo. You throw in a few large rocks and no car can by. Uh...Interesting enough, the road\nbetween Nahariyya and Nefriam...uh...about...for about 5 miles was a zig zag, very\nzigzaggy. And...uh...the Arabs used to call it the road of backshis. The...uh...backshis is\nan Arabic word for tipping. And the reason being that...uh...way back before I even came\nto Palestine, the...uh...when the British mandate were building the road...that particular\nroad... uh...which was quite parallel to the...the Lebanese border so to speak...uh...every\nArab sheik that had orange or citrus groves or lemon groves...by paying the British\nbackshis...the would make the road came to their gates, so they could come with the\ntrucks and as a result the road went like this. That...that's a fact. And...uh...so as the\n_ came about, and I can tell you the precise date and the precise hour was March 23rd,\n1948 at 20 til 3 in the afternoon. Uh...There were brutally attacked by...by the arm of\n____, the known...uh...Arab liberator of Palestine so to speak. And he was very...very\nsmart man, and he was able to illude the Israeli army...uh...at the time...uh...by running\naway through a...his own __ road that he made to the Western Galilee. But nevertheless\n...uh...the attack on the convoy to _____ was quite successful simply because there was a\nserious of tragedies. Uh...Number one, the officer commanding the...uh...the convoy\nwas...by name of...uh...uh...Ben Aame _ if you heard about him. And...uh...my best friend,\nMoses Shinerman was a lieutenant at the time in the unit. This was my unit. I was spared\nsimply because my wife was giving birth to my daughter at that...a few hours before that.\nAnd because she was quite ill with a...with a bone...some type of...uh... deficiency, that\nthe doctor at the time...we did not have a hospital at that time there..he said, \"Isaac, you\nmust stay here.\u201d And in fact he even talked to our commanding officer, that I must stay\nthere because they expected the worst from birth. Fortunately enough, nothing happened.\nBut...uh...Alisa Shiner, which was like my sister, came to see the baby at...before she left\neven to the convoy. And...uh...I said, \"Gee, I wish I could go, but the doctor did not allow\nme to go.\u201d I had to stay there. So the convoy left...uh...uh...a few...1t was a few minutes\nafter the left Nahariyya, they were all ambushed. Because they...they ...they waited until\nthe...the...uh...last truck had passed this zig zag and then they started to put some rocks\nand they put some rocks at the other end of the zig zag so that they first car unbeknown\nto them was able...was able to break the barricade. The second car in line was the bus.\nThe bus had armor. The Israeli, at the time, they put armor and they welded these heavy\nmetal plates in the cabin so that the driver would not be hurt. Unfortunately, as the driver\nof the bus was trying to turn around, they threw apparently some of a molotov cocktail.\nAnd both of the tires were shot so the truck then became paralyzed in...in closing the\nroad. So all the other 6 or 7 other trucks...they were behind them...okay...we...we felt the\nsame...the same thing. They couldn't move. And as a result the...uh...the people were\ngiven the word apparently to...uh...save yourself. And... uh...very, very few were to...to\nsurvive this incident. Uh...they were able to escape by hiding on the water that flows\nfrom the Western Galilee to Nahariyya to the ocean...to the Atlantic Ocean to the\nMediterranean. There was a little bit creek, and they were able to survive by hiding there\nbecause in the meantime it was beginning to be dark, you see. Had the convoy had left\nearlier although it was 20 in the afternoon, 20 to 3...uh...March...uh...uh...1t wasn't quite\nfull summer yet. And...uh...they survived by staying there in the dark, and maneuvering.\nSome of them arrived in Nahariyya and they...what...the next thing what happened was\nthe British mandate was...the army was and the police were still at the time in Palestine,\nthey did not allow the Haganah to...whoever the forces that we wanted to go out and try\nto help, but they would not allow it. Could not live Nahariyya. And it was one of the\ngreatest disasters that we suffered...uh...in...uh...1n the Haifaam...the convoy to Haifaam.\nUh...We lost 40...49...I believe 49 members. But then there was an action\nthat...uh..some...some said in Israel later on there was a...uh...an action from the Haganah\nto make up for the convoy to Haifaam. And what happened was one of the Israeli\ntelephone operators caught up or intercepted a message coming from the Lebanese border\nthat there was a convoy coming in with...at the time if you remember the British...the\nBritish had the Arab Legion in Palestine as well. And the Arab Legion had some stations\nin the Mount Cumberland Haifa, if you remember. They had some...so the...the Israeli\nintelligence was able to find out...the Haganah...that there was a convoy coming in from\nLebanon full of arms and ammunitions for the Arabs. Let me tell you, that I saw\npersonally. And I have never seen a thing like this in my life. For several days, the entire\n_ Cal the houses along the main road Haifa Beirut were emptied.\nNow, the Arabs, of course, didn't know that. And there were several members of the\nHaganah and the PALMA waiting in hiding because they...they knew that the convoy\nwas coming but they did know when exactly...the precise time. And...uh...by sheer\ncoincidence, I was not involved in...1n any of those actions at the time, I just happened to\ncome to _____ with a truck which I is I...I used to bring food and all kinds of things from\nHaifa to Nahariyya during this period. And I just had arrived barely in Kayathim... was a\nbig, big circle. And all of a sudden, all Hell broke loose. This convoy had come in with\nthe arms at the other end on the north side of Kayat...uh... Kayathim...Kayat valley.\nAnd...uh...of course, it appears that not just there was several...uh...private cars,\nautomobiles, sedans, and there was some Araban Legion trucks. And apparently each one\nof them had some sort of dynamite in it. Not only did they have some dynamite in it, they\nalso had some officers of the...uh...the Arab Legion in it. So the result was, it was\njust...uh...very tragic for the...for the convoy, because...uh...no one came out of it alive.\nNot a single person! But what I saw and that I'll never forget in my life, for as long as I\nlive. The British police and the British army...of course, they immediately\nsurrounded...closed the roads. Okay? And...uh...you could smell the fire. You could smell\nbodies burning. You could see the fires because we were right there. Okay? But I'll never\nforget in my life is when the British...when all this action disappeared...several Israelis\nwere also actually hurt because one young man from the Haganah, he just went the head\nof that truck and he then became...he received the highest medal from the Israeli army\nbecause he was the one who really went to the middle of the road and just stopped that\ntruck. He just shot everybody...whatever the truck as the truck was coming to him, and he\nhimself in turn was blown up, and his face...uh...I can't remember his name...they had all\nthe plastic operations and a year, etc., etc., and he was for a longest time hospitalized. But\nthe point is... wanted to make, when I saw the British officers, British police\nwith....uh...portable...uh...what do you call this...uh...when you put somebody...it's made\nof canvas, you know.",
        "Q: Body bag?",
        "A: No. Not a body bag. No. No. No. Uh...if someone is injured, for instance..",
        "Q: Stretchers.",
        "A: Stretchers. I beg your pardon. They used to have stretchers. Okay? And...uh...they would\nput a stretcher next to a body. Now that body...uh...those that I have seen... saw at the\ntime without a head, without arms, etc. They didn't touch the bodies as such. They used\nsticks, and with sticks they used to push the bodies into the stretcher. Okay? And then\nthey went like this...one...two...three, and dumped the body into the pickup trucks that\nthey had. I'll never forget it in my life. Never! I thought it was so inhuman...no matter if it\nwas Arab, if it was a Jew, he was dead...the person, whoever was left. And I thought he\nwould be treated a little more...with some dignity, and not as if you tossing a pail of\ngarbage into the truck. But they did it. It was very, very cold...cold. And...uh...so we\nafterwards, we had to wait several hours. We were allowed in when they cleaned up on\nthe roads, etc., and the mess...we were allowed to go to Nahariyya in our convoy when\nwe met.",

        "A: Well I (clearing throat) after the war I... became a tourist driver guide, licensed by the\ngovernment and...uh...I had one of the blue license. There was a red and a blue. I was not\na biblical scholar, but I did have and I do have a basic knowledge of the western Galilee,\nand I was familiar so I drove many, many....uh...tourists... dignitaries. Uh...I\ndrove...uh...Polish...uh...commission. They were making a film in the western Galilee. I\ndrove...uh...I drove the Turkish Consul-General to Jerusalem...uh...the new one that came\nto...to Israel at the time. I drove...uh...a....uh...Jewish Parliamentary Commissions that\ncame to visit also the western Galilee. Uh...I was assigned at one time, and I\ndrove...uh...[saac Bensfee, the President of Israel at the time, and his wife. They sat in the\nback of my car, and in the front...uh...we picked up in Auspina on the way to...uh...the\nexcavations of Hotsora at the time...uh...we picked up the very famous archaeologist,\n____uh...God bless their...their souls. Uh...He was the leading...uh...archaeologist in the\ncountry, and at the time he was also the Chief of Staff of the Israel Army. So we drove to\nthe excavations of Hotsor in western Galilee. It was the most fascinating experience in\nlife to listen to these biblical scholars speaking about how Joshua had taken over the\nmountains from the Canaanites. And it was a fascinating experience.",
        "Q: What made you decide...when do you come...what made you decide to come to the\nUnited States?",
        "A: I had the...the great honor of meeting a very charming...uh ...older lady in Israel which\nis...uh...was my wife's great mother. And she used to live in New Rochelle, New York.\nShe came to visit Israel on a few occasions. I only met her once. She was quite a elderly\nlady, and somehow or another we then had a little reunion, and it was discussed that...uh\n...perhaps we should come and stay with her family in the United States because myself I\nonly had a brother in Israel at that time. And my wife had these cousins and...and so\nforth. And then a little bit later on, again by...by...by sheer coincidence, there was another\nmember from the United States, a father-in-law of my wife's cousin. He had, at the time,\narrived to visit Israel and I had a meeting with him with my mother-in-law and he was a\nvery exciting man. He was a Polish Jewish fellow...uh...namely Abe Rockland was his\nname, God bless his soul. And he told me in his broken English, he said, \"You should\ncome to America yesterday.\u201d And..uh...kind of I...I start to think a little bit more in that.\nNow I always liked United States. As a child in Portugal, I used to love to read.\nBooks...the little booklets about Buffalo Bill. That was my number one hero was Buffalo\nBill. And the buffalo and the...and the things...fights with the Indians and all that sort of\nthings. I used to read a lot. And that's how I...I read a lot of it in...in...I couldn't quite\nunderstand English at that time, but I forced myself and taught myself some English. And\nso I always had the good vision that the United States, of course, 1s...1s the greatest in the\nworld. And it is. And...uh...and we decided then to immigrate, to come to the United\nStates, and we left Israel...uh...1n 1959, and we came to the United States in 1959. My\nwife, Miriam, and my daughter, Tamara, my son, Daniel, and my son, Michael. Uh...My\ndaughter, Tamara, went to Switzerland to live with the rest of the family after she\ngraduated from high school. My son, Daniel, of course...uh... stayed in...with us,\nand...uh...he joined the army without my knowledge...uh...joined the Vietnam war. He\nvolunteered to...uh...to...to go to Vietnam. And...uh...although (clearing throat) I am very,\nvery proud of him because...uh...he served with great honors...the...uh...with the Green\nBerets, and also with the Ninth Armed Calvary. And he was shot down four\ntimes...uh...from the helicopters. He used to be with the...uh...the...uh...the\nsmall...uh...OV helicopters, the observations helicopters. And fortunately enough, he was\nalways fell in some rice paddies or within the area that he was not...never injured.\nUh....he jumped out of the choppers actually, when the choppers were...were attacked.\nAnd...uh...he's very heavily (clearing throat) honored ...uh...Presidential citations and\nbronze stars. He has three bronze stars and many other medals, and I'm very, very proud\nof him. And Michael, my younger son, works with me in the business.",
        "Q: Thank you. I'd like...I'd like to go back a little now.",
        "A: Sure. Sure.",
        "Q: If we could, I'd like to go back to Portugal...uh...during the war.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: You're a young man of 16?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. Can you tell us a little more about your impressions of the refugee community that\nfilled the Jewish soup kitchen? More about the people, and about the numbers of people\nthat came there.",
        "A: Alright. It's...uh...",
        "Q: Could you repeat the question? Just repeat it a little. The microphone will pick it up.",
        "A: Okay. I...uh...uh...1 understand that you would like to know a little bit more about the\nsituation in the soup kitchen...uh...perhaps some numbers of refugees that came by and\nwhat was the...the situation, the atmosphere. Uh...It's...uh...sometimes difficult...uh...to go\nback so many years and...and be able to precisely memorize on what happen then.\nUh...But something of very interest that I should have and I did not mention earlier,\nwas...uh...by a sheer coincidence, as I told you before, I happened to be a cousin to\nSenator from Minnesota, Rudy Boshwitz, through my wife because of the marriage. And\nhis wife, Ellen Boshwitz, was one of the refugees that passed through Lisbon at that point\nin time in history. But I don't remember meeting her then, because she was much\nyounger. She was a younger person than me. And I do not remember...I don't she was\nnecessarily at the soup kitchen because not all the refugees that came to Portugal were at\nthe soup kitchen. Some of the refugees...they...they were persons of means that were able\nto somehow manage to bring some money with them, some...and they were able to stay\nin...in hotels and...uh...for a given period of time. And...uh...and I understand that Ellen\nand her family...they left Lisbon by boat to Brazil, and then from Brazil, they came to the\nUnited States. But...uh...most of the other refugees that really had no means and were\nwaiting for visas to...uh...to... uh...1mmigrate to the Unites States, to Israel, to South\nAmerica, etc., etc...uh...there was a time 1n...uh...Portugal when...uh...many of these\nrefugees' visas had expired, and they are allowed to stay a given period of time, if 1t was\n3 months, 6 months, etc. And as a result the...uh...the Portuguese, if I may say so, are\nvery...the Portuguese language is a very complete language. They say ______.\nEverything is to be just so. Uh...And they're very particular. And the reason they're law-\nabiding. So...so when the refugees visas expired, the next step was you are jailed. Simple\nas that! Now, you have here...uh...uh...a large group of people, reasonable large, several\nhundred people that suddenly, while they were able to escape the Nazi persecution and\nthe Nazi armies, are being put in jail in Lisbon with common criminals. And the sad part\nis, of course, that most of these people in large numbers were academicians. They were\ndoctors. They were engineers. They were scientists, etc., businessmen, etc. So the\nPortuguese-Jewish community and I believe again here, in conjunction with the\nAmerican Joint Committee, asked the government of Portugal to allow these\nrefugees...to...to assign to these refugees some small villages surrounding Lisbon so\nthey...they could with some ...some dignity live in there, until they were able to receive\nvisas to leave Portugal. And this was granted. There was several little villages. I can't\nremember...I think one of them that I remember is ____ that was allowed for refugees\nto stay there. They were not allowed to move out of these villages without the permission\nof the Portuguese...uh...Naturalization Immigration Department, because they were very\nstrict. Uh... The president of the time of the Jewish community in Lisbon was Professor\nOnsolack. Uh...He was the professor of...uh...science in the University of Lisbon. And\nironically...uh...it is often said that he was good friend with the Prime Minister Salosar.\neven though that Solsar give orders to _____ not to issue visas to Jews...uh...on the\nside, the Portuguese government was very strict. And I cannot, as I said earlier,\npersonally say, that I was persecuted by the Portuguese government. I was not as such.\nUh...That Jews were persecuted by the Portuguese government, I can't say that either.\nEither than the fact that ____ was removed from his position, that it is true of the\nPortuguese people, not the government, that they were very helpful to the Jewish\nrefugees. In many instances! And many stores even, I understand, even giving them\nclothing. Although I have tendency to disagree with some of the statistics that are coming\nout from the Portuguese government side stating that over 40,000 Jewish refugees came\nto Lisbon. I...I know...I'm quite certain that...that as many refugees as I saw in the soup\nkitchen, I did not see 40,000 refugees come to the soup kitchen. If indeed there were\nrefugees that came to Portugal and somehow they...those that you never knew\nabout...they...they came in; they stayed a few days in a hotel; they got a visa; they kept on\ngoing to South America or...or...or North America or...or...or Palestine or Israel or other\ncountries for that matter, I do not know. I do not know. And...uh...in as much as the\natmosphere itself in the soup kitchen, it was..uh...I tried to bring back my...my mental\nmemory...uh...and look at these families sitting on the table and...uh...and...uh...they were\nnot happy faces to say the least. You could always see sad faces. Okay? Faces of\nwhen...when a person is concerned, when you are worried about...uh...whatever happened\nto...to your mother, your father, your uncle, your aunt, your niece, your brother, your\nsister? You don't know. You didn't know. You were the lucky one. You were able to\nmake it. You run away fast. You..you were lucky to do it. You saved your life. What\nhappened to the other ones? And it was very difficult. And it was a concern because as\nyou well know, Jewish are so very emotional, and...uh...there were many a tears in the\nkitchen soup, many a tears and you could see...you could observe that. Uh...And yet there\nwas...uh...as I told you before about this fellow, Gustof Zumick, repairing the shoes of\nother refugees. That was the least he could have done to help his fellow...fellow...fellow\nin...in...1n this instance you know. So there was a...a...a still a little bit of a sense\n..Of...uh...of, \"I am your...my brother's keeper,\" you know. That's a atmosphere that I can\nbest describe. Helping someone with the nothing that you have, you know. And I think it\nwas very typical of the...of the Jews at the time, helping each other with the least that\nthey had, with the nothing that they had. So I don't know if I answered your question.",
        "Q: You did indeed. Is there anything you want to add.",
        "A: (Sigh) Yes. I...I'm having a hard time keeping my tears inside me. Because every time\nwhen I think about these things, you know...uh...I happen to be Jewish too and very\nemotional too. It's hard to keep them down. Really. It's...uh...my friends that were killed\nduring the war and....uh...even some of the what I saw in Europe with the dispersed\npersons and...uh... Later on in Israel, if I may add that too, as I became a tourist driver\nguide, there was a kibbutz by the name of ____.. In English, it's called the ghetto of\nfighters. I was very, very fortunate again because I was called on more than one\noccasions...many, many times, to drive one of the leaders of the ghetto fighters. His name\nwas Isaac Zuckerman. Yes. And I drove that man so many times, taking him from the\nkibbutz, bringing him to Nahariyya, bring him to Haifa, bring him here, bring him there.\nAnd there was a girl by the name of Miriam. I cannot remember her other number. But\nshe was also one of the few...[saac Zuckerman and Miriam were one of the few Jewish\npeople that were able to...to get out of the Warsaw....Warsaw ghetto alive. I guess most of\nthe leaders were all killed by the...by the ...by the Germans, by the Nazis armies. But they\nsurvived. And...uh...as the kibbutz was being from...from the very beginning...uh...which\nwas built near a Roman aqueduct in...about 5 kilometers south of Nahartyya, ___, as 1t\nwas built up, of course, I used to bring tourists over there also to visit the kibbutz\n_. But this was... uh...one of the last things really I...that it was very, very touching.\nAnytime you went to the...into the ghetto's fighters, as they were building the kibbutz and\ntalking to these people and...and witnessing the things that they did to humanbeings,\nmaking soap out of hair and skins and children, that was...uh...uh... As far as I'm\nconcerned...I'm...I'm one of those that believe in the philosophy that never again...I'm\ngonna die with some dignity, as opposed to just submit.",

        "A: Yes. My name is Isaac Bitton.",
        "A: I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, March 31st, 1926. I was born in the hospital at Hiletia in\nLisbon.",
        "A: My...my mother was born and raised in Farouh in the south of Portugal. And...uh...most\nof the Jewish people that came to Portugal towards the end of the 1700s and beginning of\nthe 1800s...uh...settled down in Farouh. And there was a very large community lodged\nand relatives over 126 families within approximately 100 years. By the 1900s they all\ndisappeared so that Portugal...uh...Farouh today is...there is no Jewish life. But my\nmother was born there. She moved to Lisbon with my grandparents which originally\ncame from...uh...uh... Morocco, Spanish Morocco and French Morocco. Therefore, my\nname Bitton which is a French, actually a French broken name. Uh...And of course my\nmother was married in Lisbon and...uh...we were five brothers and five sisters, 5 boys\nand 5 girls and...uh...I attended...the uh...the...uh...the schools in...1n\nLisbon...and...uh...the Jewish school...was a private Jewish school...uh...where we were\ntaught Hebrew so we could...uh...we could read...uh...the prayer books. Because my\nfamily came from a reasonable religious...uh...family. Not orthodox, but...uh...religious.\nAnd we all had to learn Hebrew and...uh...we did so. At home my...my grandparents,\nprimarily my grandmother spoke some Spanish and...uh...Lidino actually, and some of\nthe Portuguese. And...uh...basically, I...1 grew up amongst the Jewish community which\nwas very, very small at that time. There was not much activity amongst the Jew youth.\nThere was actually not too many youth in...1n Lisbon, Portugal. And...uh...my oldest\nbrother had actually begun to have some girl friends, not Jewish. My father was very\nupset about it and...uh...as I used to go to school to learn Hebrew by...uh...a lady that also\nwas a Moroccan...uh...Jewish teacher, she had in her...uh...l1ving room several pictures\nof...uh...of...uh...of Israel, of _ Israel at the time from the wailing wall and others.\nAnd...uh...I was always impressed by those pictures. Always! And that created in me a\ngreat desire at the time to...to go to Israel. Already from a little, early childhood. And\nsuddenly when the opportunity knocked in 1943, then I went to Israel. But in the\nmeantime, my Aunt Esther ____ Bitton, my father's sister, used to work at...uh...there was\na Portuguese soup kitchen primarily at the time used for the poor...the poor Jews of\nLisbon. And during the second world war, obviously this kitchen became very very\ninfluential in assisting the refugees to have one hot meal a day. And it was there that I\nreally began to...uh...hang around a lot of time simply because I was...uh...I was very\nimpressed by the various languages spoken. Uh...At the time I spoke Portuguese and a\nlittle bit of Spanish, but when you begin to hear Yiddish...lot of...lots of\nYiddish...uh...lots of German...uh... Hungarian, Czech. I remember families from\nCzechoslovakia. Uh... was always very impressed by...by these languages and...and\nuh...and I used to help...used to help buy...uh...the sitting....the sitting arrangement. There\nwere probably within the dozen tables...uh...each table would care approximately\nhundred...10... 10...uh...people so the dining room for the refugees was within...uh...150\npersons sitting capacity. And there was another small dining room which was for the\nPortuguese...uh...the Portuguese community. And next to the kitchen, soup kitchen was a\nJewish hospital. I was born in a Jewish hospital. So was my entire family. It was a very\nsmall hospital, but nevertheless they took care of...uh...of the Jewish community.\nSo...uh...and...uh...1t was during this period in history that...uh...one day while I was at\nthe soup kitchen I hear...one family walks i1n...several children, father and mother...very\nwell dressed, not dressed like a refugee as such...uh...with crumbly clothing, but really\nvery nice and neat...uh...and I...I asked the gentleman. I said...I fact I told him, \"Excuse\nme. This...this is for the refugees...this dining room.\u201d And he said...uh...uh... ... in\nPortuguese...he said, \"But we too are refugees.\u201d And...uh...I couldn't quite understand it. I\nwas a teenager at the time, but still...uh...I asked him, \"Why is that you are refugee.\nYou...you are Portuguese. How can you be a refugee.\u201d And...uh...he asked me to sit\ndown. And it was then that I...I met the very famous...uh...humanitarian, Dr. -\n_ who told me that he was the ex-consul of Portugal in Bordeaux, France. And he went\non to tell me that he had been expelled by the Portuguese government simply because he\nhad refused...he...he was asked to refuse to give...uh...uh...visas to the...to the Jewish\nrefugees. And...uh...as a result, of course, he was removed from his position. He was\ndisbarred because he was a lawyer by trade also, and removed from the diplomatic corps.\nAnd...uh..I met him in Lisbon at the soup kitchen within...I do not remember exactly if he\nwas 4 or a half a dozen. We spoke briefly. He was there in line standing with...uh...family\nto get his hot meal and...and to date I couldn't...I...1 never got out of my mind simply that\nthe..the men of his stature...of his caliber...uh...that had ...had really helped saved lives,\nwas punished in such manner by being removed from...from his...doing his job.\nAnd...uh...I was very impressed and these image always stayed with me. Uh...I...1...I don't\nbelieve I can really tell you a great deal more about Dr. because I met him such a short\nfew times. But I remember portions of the family. And...uh...uh...I remember the...the\nrefugees primarily more so that were there in most cases because they were the fortunate\nones that had received visas by Dr. in Bordeaux, France. Uh...I remember a family by the\nname of Deutsch, father, mother and two children who...they set up a shop in the most\nbusy street in Lisbon which is called the Sheadu. In fact, it was burned out recently. Was\non the portions of the city that was burned...ancient part of the Lisbon. And...uh... Mr.\nDeutsch used to put...uh...a table about maybe 3 by 3 and used to sell razor blades and\nother little things. And I help him bring them to the areas. I used to help also to bring the\nrefugees to some...some new residences since they were not quite familiar with Lisbon\nand I was quite familiar with Lisbon. Uh...There was another family...uh...by the name of\nGoostave Zumich...Zumich. He was from Czechoslovakia. Uh...Uh...He was a\nshoemaker, and he set up shop...uh...at the soup kitchen, one of the corners. And there he\nwould repair the shoes from the refugees. And...uh...I remember Mr. Brown who was\nalso a German Jew who...uh...was the liaison between the refugees and the\nJewish...uh...Portuguese community. He was in charge of... uh...uh...helping them\nto...uh...go and...uh...he was the one that would ask me at times, why...why don't you\nshow this person where such and such a street is and so forth and so on. And...uh...I\nremember a family by the name of, I believe Grallman, who...uh...uh...whose lady\nhad...uh...uh... a very small little girl, a child, but she became quite ill. She was\nhospitalized in Lisbon....uh... for I believe was mental stress. And my Aunt Esther, God\nbless her soul, took care of her daughter for a given period of time and for as long as she\nwas hospitalized prior to moving to Israel. Later on, since we traveled on the same ship to\nIsrael...uh...the family asked me to join their own family in Nahartyya in a little farm,\nwhich I did. That's how come I arrived in Nahariyya. It was through the Grallman family.\nAnd...uh...basically...uh...sometimes when I remember of the...uh...the...uh...the\nincidences...you know, you are a young man and...uh...up to that point in time in history,\nlife in Portugal as such and Lisbon was quite uneventful for a young man.\nAnd...uh...suddenly when all these refugees start to come in...uh...1t was very exciting. I\ncould not understand what they were saying in most cases, but they would...uh...they\nwould come to this soup kitchen a little before noon. If it was an hour before, and they\nwould...in groups...you could sit them right in the...uh... the ____ and ____ 1n Lisbon is\nstill today a street that has no end, you know. It...is two little corners like. You must turn\naround to come out. And...uh...they would walk around there, talking about problems,\nfamilies, the anxiety, what happened to other members of the family because they did not\nknow. They hadn't heard from them. Uh...And...uh...this to me was all very exciting\nand...uh...as a matter of fact, 1t reinforced in me even more so my wants to...to go to\nIsrael. And...uh...1t was at some point in time that we met...uh... members\nof...uh...the...uh...Sofnut that came from Lisbon to ...uh...uh...help the refugees to\nimmigrate to Israel.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: During the second world war?",
        "A: For me?",
        "A: Well, since you asked...since you asked...uh...uh... (clearing throat), there was a time\nduring the war that in the north of Portugal, they had found wolfrum. And that's some\ntype of a metal. I do not know that much about it. But it's sometime of a metal that you\nmust mix...uh... with other metals...uh...specifically for armory. And, of course...uh...that\nbecame very, very exciting all over Portugal. And many people just left the town and\nwent to the north to try to work on the wolfrum mines. And, of course, being an\nadventurer myself...uh...me and a few friends, we decided that it was the time for us to go\nand dig wolfrum too. So...uh...we...we went there, but we were very...most unsuccessful.\nNo sooner than we were there, we turned around and came back to Lisbon because, of\ncourse, we had no...no...no means...no...no money. And...uh...however little money we\nhad...uh...didn't last that long, and I came back, of course...uh...very, very broken-hearted\nthat I did not make a million escudos on the wolfrum mines. But...uh...that was an\nexciting thing. And as much as life generally speaking in Lisbon at the time for as far as I\ncan remember...uh...other than going to school at the time, I...uh...being a member of a\nlarge family and my father, at the time...uh....God bless his soul, was working for the\nPortuguese printing department of the Portuguese government. And he certainly did not\nearn that much money either. So...uh...it was up to us...the growing up children to help\nthe family. So, other than school, we would pick up whatever job we could, me and my\nbrothers. And...uh... I was involved in the dismantling, believe it or not, of World War I\nmines and...uh...we had a little wrench. There must have been a million bolts and nuts in\nthese mines, and we spent all day unknotting these...these things. Uh...Another job that I\ntook was...uh...working on ships by derusting the ballast of the ships. You know, if you're\nfamiliar with the ship ballasts, they're little oval holes at the bottom of the ship, and you\ngo in with a little swimming suit and you go with your feet and your head and your...your\narms and you stay there all day with a little hammer, and all you do is knock down the\nrust that accumulates in these little cubicles, You know, they're very small cubicles.\nUh...That was another part of a job. And I did other minuscule jobs and working\non...uh...helping to manufacture of...uh...bicycle, painting, etc. And...uh...by and large,\nthe...uh...there was an exciting period in Lisbon. I remember the...uh...uh...there would be\na...practically every day in the newspapers some story about someone being killed. A spy\nor...or some activity...foreign activities...uh...1n Lisbon. And there is another thing that I\nused to do with my friends. We used to go to the German Consulate. And they had\nalways literature. Tons of literature! They would give away propaganda about Germany.\nSo we, of course, very diligently used to take as much as we could, and the moment we\nwere out we used to toss it out in the garbage. So...uh...this was one of the things that we\ndid...uh...for some obvious reasons...uh...actually. Another one function that I\nhad...uh...was a neighbor of ours had a little shoe...uh...horse shoe shop. He was a big, big\nman and...uh...he couldn't read or write. And...uh...he always...whenever I came back\nfrom school, it was my function to come to him and read to him the newspaper and what\nwas happening in the world. Because I used to like to read a lot. And...uh...and somehow\nor another we...we became very good friends, you know. And here was this big fellow.\nHe couldn't read. I could never understand why he couldn't read either. But he was an\nolder gentleman. And he was still doing the horse shoes...uh... in his shop. Blacksmith? I\ndon't know how you call exactly, but...uh... So, by and large...uh...other than our going\nevery...we had to go every night to the temple because my father...uh...my father insisted\nthat we go to the temple every day...every night. You cannot come home unless you've\nbeen to the temple to the services. And...uh...every Friday night obviously...Saturdays,\nwe used to go to temple. So we conducted a reasonably...uh... I would say a moderate\nJewish life. And...uh...our house was...was, of course...uh...kosher. My father was quite\nkosher. And ...uh...we had a very large family, as I said...uh...uh... five boys and five\ngirls. Although two of them were born...I...one girl...my youngest sister, Rachel, was\nborn after I left Portugal. And I did not meet her until 17... when she was 17. And my\nbrother, Jacob, was...uh... few months old when I left for...for __, Israel. So...",
        "A: My only memories in this case is...uh...I didn't feel any...uh...truthfully...from the part of\nthe Portuguese, I had no...no feelings that there were anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish or\nanything like that. Never had that feeling while I was in Lisbon. That's the truth.\nUh...But...uh...by being in...uh...on a...almost on a daily basis, mixed with the Jewish\nrefugees for a given period of time, that in itself inspired in me more so the desire really\nto go to Israel. Number one, to go to Palestine and to join the British Army, and go and\nfight the Nazis, which I did as a matter of fact.",
        "A: Certainly. Well, once we...uh..we...uh...we left Portugal, our first stop was...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, basically, the...uh...uh...as far as I can remember, they came in to...uh...help number\none, to bring all the children...refugees children primarily were the number one to go\non..uh...on the registration to go to Israel. And then came grown-ups. So families with\nchildren, of course, were the first ones. And they asked the Jewish community also if\nthere were any members of the Jewish community in Lisbon that wished to immigrate\nto...uh...to ..to __, Israel. And I... and my brother were the first ones to...uh...join. Uh...In\nfact...uh...[ must say that my father at the time did not like the idea that we were going to\nleave Portugal. But I told him that I wanted to go to Israel. There was no Jewish life in\nPortugal, no Jewish youth. There was no girlfriends. At 16 a young man wants to have a\ngirlfriend. And...uh...there was no such thing. And...uh...there were...there were, of\ncourse, many girls, but not...not Jewish. And...uh...I.....] had very, very strong...uh...will\nthat I wanted to marry within the Jewish faith and have Jewish children as well, and\ncontinue my Jewish life. That was really something that I always had since childhood.\nAnd I think as I mentioned before, I was very much impressed by the...uh...photographs\nfrom the...from __, Israel, the wailing wall, etc. And Musrabano and other pictures that\nthe teacher had on the wall. So we then registered with the government of Portugal. We\nhad to pay some fees to...uh...so that we wouldn't have to go to the military, etc.,\nand...uh...we left for Palestine. I do not remember the exact date, sometimes end of 43\naboard the ship Niasa...was a steamship, a Portuguese steamship. And...uh...there was\nseveral hundred children and adults, refugees. And...uh...our first stop was about a\nday...within a day, we stopped in Cadiz, Spain. In Cadiz, Spain, the ship picked up\nseveral hundred Jewish children again. And it was there that I met...uh...a fellow from the\nJewish community in Lisbon. His name was ___\u2014\u2014__\u2014~ who _~with his brother, Samuel,\nwere in charge of the...uh...uh...uh... removal of Jewish children from the border of\nFrance into Spain into Portugal and into Israel. Uh...Again...uh... knew very well...uh..Dr.\nbecause apparently there were visas some received from this gentleman through ___.\nOkay? So that was the last time that I saw ____ alive. He and his brother worked for\nthe Jewish community of Lisbon in conjunction with the American Joint Committee to\nsave the Jewish children. So...uh...we (clearing throat) we went to...uh...we...uh...went to\nIsrael or to Palestine.",
        "A: Right. It was...I cannot remember the names of this young man, but...uh...uh...as a matter\nof fact in my life, I was directly and indirectly involved in saving five lives. But he was\naboard the Niasa, that...uh...the first thing that happened was...the Niasa had to take a\nlarge deviation because of the second world war as it was in...at that point in time quite\nactive, there was...the...the specifically, the German...uh...uh...U-Submarines were in the\nMediterranean and as a result, we had to... only remember that we were advised that the\nship would have to make a deviation because of Germany submarine activity.\nUh...Although we...we...ourselves did not see any submarines. But we did pick up a time\nwhen there was very, very rough seas. And people, of course, were feeling not quite well,\nand everybody was running up to...to the top even though they were not...you were\nadvised not to because it was reasonably dangerous. So I was going up to the deck\nand...uh...a young child I would say within 10 to 12 years old also was in a hurry\napparently to relieve himself and...uh...he was caught by a wave. And...uh...don't ask me\nhow. I only know that I dove to this child and I was able to grab him while I was\ngrabbing myself also to the rails. And meantime his mother was very...uh...excited and\nshe called the father which was a little further below the steps. And...uh...he came in a\nhurry too and to help me, and we brought, you know. This...This takes a few seconds\nbecause here comes the wave and...and...and just came through the deck and there he\nwas. And I grabbed him and so we came down there and there was no water any more or\nanything. And the father....I will never forget it. Uh...He jumped at my feet, and he\nwanted to kiss my feet because I saved...I saved his child. Now, you know, it's one of\nthese things. You know, he could...maybe he would never gone overboard, but he could\nhave gone overboard as well. So...uh...I do not remember their names. I do not\nknow...once we landed in Israel, I don't know whatever happened to them because they\nwent in different directions and...uh...uh... But nevertheless, life on board ship for the\napproximately 1 week that we spent that normally would take within 3 to 4 days, but it\ntook a little longer because of that...those deviations that...uh...the ship had to make in the\nMediterranean...Mediterranean. But we...uh...landed in Haifa. Life was not that exciting\non board. You know, it...uh...people would sit again in corners talking about what\nhappened, wishing, willing, what happened to the families, etc. in...uh...1n...uh...in...uh...\nAlso, sort of type of permanent...permanent...uh...anxiety. That's the only way I can\ndescribe it, you know. There was I would say...uh...many sighs of relief when...when the\nword Israel, the land of Israel. I remember that when all of a sudden they say land, land,\nland. And there was Haifa __ Israel. That was a word that was very, very striking to\neverybody. Because everybody...all you hear at that time was Israel, Israel, and I could\nnot understand what they were talking about. It was Polish or Yiddish or German. But\nyou could hear all the time Israel, the word Israel. That I remember. We were unloaded\ninto a...uh...buses and immediately brought to...uh...it was some sort, if you wish, of a\nconcentration camp in Atleit. I don't know within 10 to 15 miles from Haifa, south of\nHaifa. And...uh...I asked, \"What are we doing in here?\" It's like a concentration camp.\nBarbed wire with security police everywhere...uh...Arabs, Jews, British. And...uh...the\ncamp was divided into two sections for...one for men and one for women. And later on\nwe found out that...uh...because or due to strong activity from the Fifth Column...the\nGerman Fifth Column they had to do a series of interviews and they asked everyone and\nthey checked the papers, etc. So we stayed in that Atleit within...uh...a couple of weeks.\nThe conditions were not the best, but they were fair. The Sofnut was there to help us.\nAnd...uh...from there on, most of us were moved to a little...uh...a little quarters outside\nHaifa by the name of ____. And there was worse because the conditions there\nwere...everybody was mixed, men, women, children. There was no beds. We...uh...they\ndidn't expect apparently that large number of people at the time and they were not\nprepared. And...uh...as a result we slept for a few days on...on the floor with blankets, etc.\nThen...uh...the...the youth were moved to a camp in Carmel in Haifa, the\n. And it was there that...uh...I had the great privilege and the honor of meeting the great\nlady of the Youth Aliyjah Movement, Henrietta Solt. And she was a lovely lady, God bless\nher soul, who...uh... I talked to her personally too. She talked to each one of us,\nwelcoming us to ____ Israel. And...uh...some of us we were already above desirable age\nto stay in the Youth...with the Youth Movement. And I was one of them. So I then was\nmoved from the ______\u2014\u2014to Kibbutz BitAlfa. And here I must say that...uh...I could\nnot get used to life in a kibbutz. I just couldn't. Uh...I was too...uh...you know, full of\naction, you know. And...uh...I wanted to join the British Army. I wanted to join the war,\nnot...I didn't come over here to be in a kibbutz, you know. So my brother, Abraham,\nstayed in the kibbutz and my cousin, ____, God bless him. He also passed away in\nIsrael. Uh...They...they stayed in there. And...uh...I went to...uh...to join the British Army\nin Haifa, the British Joint Office. Uh...Once I filled all the papers, I was advised that\nbecause when they asked me for my papers, I gave them my Portuguese passport that I\narrived legally. So I was advised by the...by the lieutenant in charge...he said, \"I'm sorry,\nSir. You can't join the British army. Portugal is a neutral country.\u201d So I said, \"Okay.\u201d I\nleft and I joined the...at the time was in Haifa talking to some other friends in there, I\njoined the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad Division. And this time my cousin also\njoined. He came back from the kibbutz also. He couldn't manage there. And...uh...so we\nboth joined the PPRD. But I did not like the PPRD, the Palestine Police Railroad\nDIvision. What we did was simply night guards. We had to be with the rifle or the\ncarbine by the railroad or be escort to the British...uh...payroll, etc. And it was not what I\nwanted. I wanted to go to war. That was my main thing. So I decided to...uh...go to\nSarafan, which was the largest British joint group...army...uh...camp. (clearing throat)\nAnd again I fill out the papers and...uh...when I was asked for my...uh...uh...papers...how\ndid I came to Palestine, I said, \"I haven't got any papers.\u201d How did you come in? \"I'm an\nillegal.\u201d And I wrote in this time in my...1n my...my papers that I was born in Sofia,\nBulgaria. As a native of Bulgaria, of course...uh...Bulgaria was at war too, so was no\nlonger neutral (clearing throat) and...uh...speaking to some other friends...uh...we\nrealized, of course, that the British they speak English. And not once was I asked about if\nI speak Bulgarian. Which I don't! But...uh...so...1t was in this manner that I was able to\njoin the...the British army. So we spent some time in Sarafan...the camp, and then we\nwere moved to the Jewish Brigade group...uh...training camp in...uh...[smailia in Egypt.\nWe were part of the ITD...the Infantry Training Depot. And, of course, we were trained\nby British...uh... officers and also by...uh...Jewish officers. So we spent several months in\ntraining in infantry accelerated training because at the time the British army...the Jewish\nBrigade group because they wanted us to have a very fast training. The Jewish Brigade\ngroup had seen some action in the front in Italy at the time. And...uh...of course, I never\nsaw any action in the front. The end of the war came while I...we were still in Egypt.\nSo...uh...we were then moved to Europe. We left Alexandria aboard a British troop\ncarrier, Escanya, if I remember right, and from there, of course, we were designated to\nthe different...uh...Jewish Brigade...uh...unit. I was assigned to the second battalion of the\nJewish Brigade group. And shortly thereafter, I was transferred to the corps of military\npolice of the Jewish Brigade. (clearing throat) And we saw duties in Antwerp. We had\nour main station in Antwerp in Belgium. And it was there that...uh...I really had some\nfirst impact with dispersed persons that...people that came from the camps. Not the\nrefugees that were able...that were fortunate to run away and arrive in Lisbon somehow in\na reason...reasonably healthy manner. I'm talking about a dispersed person that survived\nthe camps. They came out. They were skin and bones. Okay? And...uh...as a member of\nthe Jewish Brigade, our uniforms were part of the British...uh...uniforms. The only\ndifference was that we had our patches and we had the Star of David in gold\nwith...uh...two whites and...uh...uh...blue...uh...stripes and...uh...1t was in Antwerp and we\nused to do a lot of duty at...uh...train station that the group of dispersed persons came in.\nThey came out of the train, and I don't know if they came from Germany or from where\nthey came from, but...uh...1t was several of us...MPs, military police....and when they saw\nthe Star of David, there was one of the most __ things I ever experienced in my life. They\ncame to you, and they kissed the Star of David. And they was saying in Yiddish,\n_.. They didn't believe that. And it was very, very touching. So I spent some time\nin...uh...in Antwerp, and...uh...then we went to Eindhoven in Holland to a...uh...R and R\ncamp. We spent some time there. And...uh...of course, this is after the war.\nUh...And...uh...the Jewish Brigade at the time was not doing much of anything officially.\nUnofficially, the Jewish Brigade group or part of it or portion of it were very,\nvery...uh...diligently working in moving...uh...dispersed persons from one place to\nanother place. It reminds, perhaps, of the story of...uh...the Jewish Brigade group was like\na duck that...uh...you only see the smooth sailing on...on above the water, but below\nwater they peddle like Hell so to speak. And that's what was happening. The...uh...the\nJewish Brigade group...uh...I'm assuming in conjunction with the Haganah and...uh...the\nAliyah Bet and I'm sure you know the meaning of Aliyjah Bet. Uh...There was the\nconvention immigration and the unconvention immigration. And the unconvention\nimmigration was what we call today or we called then Alijah Bet. Uh...so that it would be\ndistinguished from the convention immigration. Because the British mandate, at the time,\nin Palestine did not wish...did not want to allow any more Jews to come to Palestine on a\nvariety of grounds that they believed in. But...uh...but, of course, the Jewish agency\nbelieved in...in otherwise. And the Jewish agency, of course, had other ideas. And as a\nresult, the Alyjah Bet was created. So...uh...there were many a times that...uh...1n our\ncamp, for instance, there was a time that over night there was\nseveral...uh...several...uh...tents that overnight had been erected in our...in...inside the\ncamp. So for anyone on the outside looking at...at the army camp, another half a dozen\ntents wouldn't mean much of anything. Uh...Certainly, we were advised at the time that,\nyou know, leave them along so to speak. They are dispersed persons in these tents. The\nreason is, of course, that the British mandate at the time...the British\ngovernment...uh...with the assistance of the...uh...their various intelligence units...with\nthe assistance of the British Royal Air Force, the British Navy, they had a blockade of\nPalestine not to allow any Jews to enter. And...uh...the Jewish Agency had no choice, but\nto try to evade their...their investigations. Where are the Jews coming from? Where are\nthey being loaded? On what ships, etc., etc.?? What ports, etc., etc.? So...uh...that's when\nthe Jewish Brigade was of much help by using the military vehicles in transporting the\nrefugees from one town to another town or if it's from another country, from...if it's\nfrom...from Holland to Belgium or to Italy or...or France, etc. So this involvement\nactually was...uh...ultimately was found out somehow, and the British government, of\ncourse, dismissed the entire Jewish Brigade.",
        "A: No. I...I was not directly involved. No. Not at all. No. I was only by...by virtue of\nbeing...of serving with the Corps of Military Police of the Jewish Brigade. I do know\nthat...uh...there was...uh...every...every vehicle...army vehicle had a log. And in this log,\nof course, you have to write the moment you leave your camp, where you going, who 1s\nfor, dut dut dut da. So...uh...they used to..to write in their logs when they were moving\nrefugees three letters in English. T-T-G. And actually the meaning...uh...is...uh... Hebrew,\nArabic, and Yiddish, which means _____\u2014_\u2014.\u00ab~ Which means 1f...1f you pardon me, up your\nrear end business. That's what it meant. The reason that they wrote TTG on their...on\ntheir...on these log sheets was when and if they would be stopped by some of the\nAllied...uh... policemen on the frontiers, etc....uh...when the read, if it's British police and\nthey read TTG on it, that sounds...even though it's a Jewish Brigade convoy...20 convoys\nor 30 vehicles, etc...uh...they're not going 1n to see what's inside. Fortunately, for us, they\nwouldn't because if they would have lift the...the gate, so to speak, you'll see that there\nwas women, children, refugees being moved around. From one port to another port, etc.\nSo this part was very exciting. I knew it about it. I was not involved directly with this.\nUh...I was indirectly involved because, for instance, after spending some time in Europe\nin the British Army in the Jewish Brigade group, you are entitled to a vacation home. So\nan Isaac Bitton, in fact, went home on vacation. But the real Isaac Bitton never left,\nsimply because the...uh...again...the...the Jewish agency had trained younger men,\nrefugees to be able...how to hold...uh...the ____ the way the British army does or way\nthe Jewish Brigade does. How to eat, etc. etc. Uh...some Hebrews words in the event\nthey would be questioned, but otherwise they went home on vacation. They never came\nback. They stayed there. But Isaac never left, say Antwerp, either. And then suddenly Ike\nis back from vacation. You understand? And...and the other Isaac stayed in Israel. So in\nthis manner, many refugees also arrived in Israel with...uh...with\nfalse...uh...army...uh...army papers, army documents. So that's the only time that I was, if\nyou wish, indirectly involved with the Aliyah Bet. Uh...of course, the end of the Jewish\nBrigade came about 1946. We were dismissed. And we went back. And it was prior to\nliving in Antwerp and that one evening I...uh...I took a...uh...an electrical train in the city\nand to my great surprise, there was Brigadeer Benjamin. Brigadeer Benjamin was a....was\na British Jew who was commanding the Jewish Brigade group. And it appears that he had\nnever been informed officially of the underground activities that the Jewish Brigade was\ndoing at the time in Europe. And as a result he...uh...he was just totally demoralized if\nyou wish, prior to the...to the... when we all left...the Jewish Brigade left Europe. And\nBenjamin would be just...1 saw him more than one occasion walking around in town. But\nI met him personally in the electrical train. I had to salute, of course. He was a Brigadeer\nGeneral and...uh...but we didn't speak. He was a very, very reserved man at that time. So\nI do not know from there on...uh...I never heard that he went to visit Israel or even if he\never went to Israel, but he was very upset about the whole thing. Uh...But the\nmeantime...the main...the main...the main point was to save and bring as many Jews to\nIsrael as possible. And that was something that the Haganah did...uh...the Alyat Bet did\nvery well. And...uh...so we were disbanded, discharged pretty much. We went to Egypt\nagain, and from Egypt we were...we stayed in some camps for a short period of time and\nwe went to...we were discharged in Sarafan also officially and...uh...received our\ncivil...civilian garments and little bit pay, etc., and we were free men again, so to speak.\nOut of the...out of the Army. Out in the streets. And...uh...1mmediately, when I went back\nin Nahartyya, of course, we joined the...all of us joined the Haganah underground\nbecause the word at the time was that...uh...things did not go that good for...in Palestine.\nThe...uh... (clearing throat)...when it came to...was the beginning of the...uh...the\nproblems...the...uh...the...the war, of course, if you did not travel in a convoy, then the\nchances of going from a place A to place B alive was...was very difficult. And...and it\nwas here that I came quite involved in the...in the underground...1n the Haganah\nbetween...uh... primarily between Haifa and Nahariyya and the Western Galilee. We used\nto meet convoys going south in Shavatsion, a few kilometers south of Nahariyya\nand....uh...and take as many cars as possible and...uh...1n each one of the vehicles was at\nleast one person, one member of the Haganah which was armed. Now if it was a girl...it\nwas many of the girls that...that were also armed or if it was a boy...either if he were\nsitting on top of the truck or in the bus or in the car or in a motorcycle, etc....uh...that was\na safe way for us to travel at the time. And coming back in the late afternoon...early\nevening during the daylight, we would...uh...we would all congregate in the ____. , you\nknow, next to Haifa, and because between _____ and Haifa was reasonably safe with\nthe exception of the refineries in which...uh...there was a very, very...uh... very serious\nincident. Uh...One time...uh...the...at lunch time, a car went by and while all the Arabs\nand even some Jews that used to work in the refineries were sitting outside having lunch,\nsomebody threw some bombs. Uh...As far as I can understand...uh...of course, the Arabs\nblamed the Jews. The Jews blamed the British. And...uh... the facts remains is that the\nArabs were so angry...uh...at this attack that the massacred every Jew that worked with\nthem. For years, they used to work together. For years and years! No matter how...all of a\nsudden, bingo. I don't think there was...if there was a half dozen Jews that came out of\nalive of the...Haifa refineries. They were all massacred. And on the same evening, the\nPALMA by orders of the high command of the Haganah took action, only with cold\narms, no hot arms...they went into the Arabic village right outside Haifa...uh...where most\nof these Arabs came from, and they...they really fortunately enough...there was no men\non that evening in the village. They all had escaped because they knew\nthat...that...uh...the Haganah was after them. I do not know exactly what...what happened\nafter that, but the...the fact remains that it was a very...at the beginning of the war...the\nwar...this...of the problems. SO we...we used to congregate in Keathim, and from there on\nagain we used to travel all together to...uh...to...uh...Nahartyya.",
        "A: No. No. You mean at the...uh...at the...uh...the refineries.",
        "A: No. No. No. But I tell you one time...on two different occasions, I arrived late to the\nconvoy, and I lost the convoy. Once was going south. And I was alone. No...I beg your\npardon. I was...I was alone, and then I picked up a fellow who was a mechanic, Heim\nYenkel, was his name...was a mechanic in Nahariyya. And he sat next to me, and we\nworked to the city of Akko, but he was uneventful. There was no problem. However, on\nanother occasion coming back when...when just shortly before the war really started and\nthings were getting a little tougher...uh...several people had been killed in\nAkko...that...one by a...in a motorcycle. They tried to cross Akko alone, so to speak, by\ncar, by bicycle, and they never made it. So one time I arrived...uh...a little late, and my\nwife, at the time, was pregnant and I...I...] had to go, get home. And...uh...certainly, I\nalways had a gun with me, a 45 pistol liberata, Italian hand gun. But...uh...since I was\ndriving at the time a Volvo...it was an old truck, and I had on...on my truck I\nhad...uh...flour for the bakery, and a variety of other products. So I took my Arabic...uh...\nhead dress which I used to carry with me because since I'm quite dark featured, I could\npass very easily as an Arab. I put my head Cafia on and...uh...when I arrived at the gates,\nthey had this...we called this Spanish donkeys...is barbed wire on...uh...cross...uh...horses\nyou know. And we used to call it Spanish donkeys. And...uh...when I came to the city of\nAkko, the entrance to this...to this gate, I just put my head of the...my cab, and I shouted\nin Arabic, \"____\u2014.\u201d \"Open the gate. Open the gate.\u201d And the...the guy looked at me and\nopened the gate and I just kept on going, and I was never stopped. But...uh...you can do\nthese things when you are 20-some. (Laughing) Today, probably I wouldn't do that.\nUh...I was very fortunate too, but...uh...then, of course, the...uh...the war began pretty\nmuch very quickly, and...uh...I was...uh...with the....1 was with the Fish in the Haganah,\nand then I became...uh...Sergeant Major in the Israeli army, and I was pretty much\nstationed in the western Gaililee, in Nahariyya and in north. But at the beginning of the\nwar, something that sometimes people wonder, \"How did you do it. How...How did Israel\ndeceive them.\u201d Now, you are attached by so many armies surrounding you, and how did\nyou do it? One of the things that we did, we excavated roads between Nahariyya\nand...and...uh...frontier of Lebanon, which was about 7...5, 7 kilometers north of\nNahariyya, and...uh...we excavated in a zigzag for miles up to the road where was the\nKibbutz Hineta, so that one evening, by command of the Haganah, we took every car,\nevery bus, every motorcycle we had. Now there was no arms at the time other...other than\nthe Haganah itself. There was no army at the time. That was before the...the great\nshipment of Czechoslovakian arms came to Israel. This is all before that...that period. We\ntook out all these buses...the things with full lights and we drove toward the frontier.\nOkay\u2019? And so if you are sitting on the top of the mountain and you're looking down like\nthe Arabs were at the time at the frontier of Lebanon in Israel, whoever...there was some\narmy there. Of course, not...nothing of any great numbers but there were some. And\nthey're looking down and you see all these lights coming in. They would say,\n_. \"The Israelis are bring the entire army over here.\u201d Well, we did. We drove with lights\non. We turned around underneath the mountain where they could not see. There was\nlarge growths of...of olives, and we turned around and came back without lights. And we\nturned around again and came back with lights. You know, in with lights on, back\nwithout lights. And we did this for a given period of time. But for your information, there\nwas only one time that we found out that it was a few Arab tanks that came down from\nHorshineka, Russ,and Nicura, down into the section of the road to Hineta, and they\nturned around and back they went again. They never dare to go beyond that point. And,\nlet me tell, if they had there was nothing to hold them like I said. So in this case, the\nHaganah...uh... used a lot of...of strategy of faked...uh...movements which was very\nsuccessful in illuding the enemy at the time...uh...from advancing, because they did not\nknow what was expected from...from them. And...uh...but...uh...at this point in\ntime...uh...I'd like also to talk to you about an experience just very, very shortly before\nthis...the war started, there was a convoy going to Yesshiam, Kibbutz Yesshiam.\nYesshiam was the name of a young man by the name of Yesshiam Vis, who was a meter\nof the PALMA, special forces of the Israeli...uh... Haganah. And...uh...Yesshiam Vis was\namongst the detachment of...uh... PALMA that involved in operation bridges. In 1947, the\nHaganah decided to build, to blow up every bridge...every bridge that was connecting at\nthe time the land of Israel so to speak and all the other Arab countries.\nAnd...uh...so...uh...1t was very effective. The main purpose, I understand,\nwas...uh...uh...just to show that...uh... we can take care of ourselves, and also some sort of\na warning also toward the Arabs, you know, that...\"Don't attack.\u201d It didn't maybe work,\nbut said don't attack us. Leave us alone. Let us be. Unfortunately, there is a legend about\nthe...the...Yeeheim Vis. The bridge they were supposed to blow up was in...uh...was\ncalled Asiv, which goes back to the Finnishian times. It's a little bridge.\nAnd...uh...uh...the legend is that...uh... the...uh...from some Arabs later on we found out\nthat there was a group of British army...uh...soldiers. There was a British army camp not\ntoo far away from Asiv, that...uh... was...apparently, they were doing some sort of\nmanuevers in the middle of the night unbeknown to the group. And as a result, they were\nambushed. Since every...and each of one these young men carried the...the dynamite,\nexplosives with them. Uh...There was...not a thing was found from them. Absolutely\nnothing! They just disappeared. Was about 8 if I remember correctly. And today there is\na memorial to...uh...Yeeheim Vis in Asiv by the bridge. And...uh..before the war, there\nwas an American...as a matter of fact, an American group of young men and women that\nbuilt a kibbutz in Asiv, by the name of Asiv...American...I was there on the\ncommemoration with General Adror at the time. But in the meantime the...",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: In...in the meantime, actually, the Jewish Agency decided...uh...to honor the name of\nYeeheim Vis. His father was at the time, I believe, a high official in the Jewish Agency.\nSo...uh...in the Western Galilee, there was too much openness actually, especially coming\nin from the mountains...uh.. So they decided...the Jewish Agency decided to build two\nkibbultzes. It was just shortly before the war started. And one of them is named, today, of\ncourse, Yeehim. I'm quite familiar with the area because _Yeehim if you go back\nto...uh...to several years ago, used to be called ____\u2014\u2014\u2014sin Arabic. And there was an\nArab...a very, sort of a stronghold. But it was abandoned. There was no one there\nactually. And...uh...so the Sofnut decided to build a kibbutz at____\u2014_\u2014sd by honoring the\nname of Yeehim. And...uh...this was done. Next door was built another kibbutz\nand...uh...uh...uh...I believe was Gotton. I cannot quite remember the name, but I\nremember that I was there at the time. And this kibbutz was built already under\nfire...under Arabic fire because...uh...you could...1t was a very...1t was a very excitable\nday because here were the Haganah putting up little sheds and so forth, girls making\nfood, and here these guys were shooting down from...from the...from a spot called the\nMountain of the...the Tree Mountain. Because was in above the higher level. And...uh...I\ncan't remember exactly all the names in Hebrew any more, but it's...was like a tree\nbecause there was a large tree there. And...uh...that's basically how come that this kibbutz\nYeeheim came about, to honor Yeeheim Vis, basically. And we used to go...uh...prior to\nthe war...uh...the Haganah used to train and we used to bring arms, ammunitions, and\nfood to kibbutz _Yeeheim.. We used to walk for 4 and a half hours from Nahariyya to\nYeeheim because you go up to the mountains and you have to walk to____, and you\nhad to bypass small Arab villages and you had to do it...uh...all night long pretty much\nand you had to do it to such an extent so that you would not create too much noise. If you\nhad...uh...a squad, which is equivalent to a British army squad of 11 men and the officer,\nuh...we...uh...we used to have different squads going to different areas. And...uh.... also to\nmake a mock attacking, attacking YYeeheim_ because we expected there wwould be\nproblems as...as... as the kibbutz would be...be put in there. And there were many\nproblems. They were...they were attacked many times. But...uh...obviously, the attacks\ncould not come from the _ because there was no shape, or form that as you were\nclimbing this...this...this high mountain, big so to speak...uh...you always made noise, no\nmatter how careful you are. You could hear it. You could hear it way a way before you\nwere...uh...inside. They could hear the noise already. So basically that's what happened\nin...the __. And from there, of course...uh...we...uh...(clearing throat) ...uh...there was a\nconvoy where I lost my...my very best friends. I used to live at the time...shortly before\nthat I used to live with a family by the name of Shinerman. And...uh...there was two boys\nand a girl. Moses, Alisa, and Salome Shinerman. And...uh... There was a convoy at one\ntime. an armed convoy...that's when the conflicts already had started in\n19...uh...beginning of 48...uh...that...uh... they took...1t was a bus and several trucks, and a\npickup truck. The pickup truck had a...had a device like in V shape that had a wheel and\nthis device would be lowered to the road and it would push any any stones that the Arabs\nused to block because they used to block the...the roads all the time. It was very easy to\ndo. You throw in a few large rocks and no car can by. Uh...Interesting enough, the road\nbetween Nahariyya and Nefriam...uh...about...for about 5 miles was a zig zag, very\nzigzaggy. And...uh...the Arabs used to call it the road of backshis. The...uh...backshis is\nan Arabic word for tipping. And the reason being that...uh...way back before I even came\nto Palestine, the...uh...when the British mandate were building the road...that particular\nroad... uh...which was quite parallel to the...the Lebanese border so to speak...uh...every\nArab sheik that had orange or citrus groves or lemon groves...by paying the British\nbackshis...the would make the road came to their gates, so they could come with the\ntrucks and as a result the road went like this. That...that's a fact. And...uh...so as the\n_ came about, and I can tell you the precise date and the precise hour was March 23rd,\n1948 at 20 til 3 in the afternoon. Uh...There were brutally attacked by...by the arm of\n____, the known...uh...Arab liberator of Palestine so to speak. And he was very...very\nsmart man, and he was able to illude the Israeli army...uh...at the time...uh...by running\naway through a...his own __ road that he made to the Western Galilee. But nevertheless\n...uh...the attack on the convoy to _____ was quite successful simply because there was a\nserious of tragedies. Uh...Number one, the officer commanding the...uh...the convoy\nwas...by name of...uh...uh...Ben Aame _ if you heard about him. And...uh...my best friend,\nMoses Shinerman was a lieutenant at the time in the unit. This was my unit. I was spared\nsimply because my wife was giving birth to my daughter at that...a few hours before that.\nAnd because she was quite ill with a...with a bone...some type of...uh... deficiency, that\nthe doctor at the time...we did not have a hospital at that time there..he said, \"Isaac, you\nmust stay here.\u201d And in fact he even talked to our commanding officer, that I must stay\nthere because they expected the worst from birth. Fortunately enough, nothing happened.\nBut...uh...Alisa Shiner, which was like my sister, came to see the baby at...before she left\neven to the convoy. And...uh...I said, \"Gee, I wish I could go, but the doctor did not allow\nme to go.\u201d I had to stay there. So the convoy left...uh...uh...a few...1t was a few minutes\nafter the left Nahariyya, they were all ambushed. Because they...they ...they waited until\nthe...the...uh...last truck had passed this zig zag and then they started to put some rocks\nand they put some rocks at the other end of the zig zag so that they first car unbeknown\nto them was able...was able to break the barricade. The second car in line was the bus.\nThe bus had armor. The Israeli, at the time, they put armor and they welded these heavy\nmetal plates in the cabin so that the driver would not be hurt. Unfortunately, as the driver\nof the bus was trying to turn around, they threw apparently some of a molotov cocktail.\nAnd both of the tires were shot so the truck then became paralyzed in...in closing the\nroad. So all the other 6 or 7 other trucks...they were behind them...okay...we...we felt the\nsame...the same thing. They couldn't move. And as a result the...uh...the people were\ngiven the word apparently to...uh...save yourself. And... uh...very, very few were to...to\nsurvive this incident. Uh...they were able to escape by hiding on the water that flows\nfrom the Western Galilee to Nahariyya to the ocean...to the Atlantic Ocean to the\nMediterranean. There was a little bit creek, and they were able to survive by hiding there\nbecause in the meantime it was beginning to be dark, you see. Had the convoy had left\nearlier although it was 20 in the afternoon, 20 to 3...uh...March...uh...uh...1t wasn't quite\nfull summer yet. And...uh...they survived by staying there in the dark, and maneuvering.\nSome of them arrived in Nahariyya and they...what...the next thing what happened was\nthe British mandate was...the army was and the police were still at the time in Palestine,\nthey did not allow the Haganah to...whoever the forces that we wanted to go out and try\nto help, but they would not allow it. Could not live Nahariyya. And it was one of the\ngreatest disasters that we suffered...uh...in...uh...1n the Haifaam...the convoy to Haifaam.\nUh...We lost 40...49...I believe 49 members. But then there was an action\nthat...uh..some...some said in Israel later on there was a...uh...an action from the Haganah\nto make up for the convoy to Haifaam. And what happened was one of the Israeli\ntelephone operators caught up or intercepted a message coming from the Lebanese border\nthat there was a convoy coming in with...at the time if you remember the British...the\nBritish had the Arab Legion in Palestine as well. And the Arab Legion had some stations\nin the Mount Cumberland Haifa, if you remember. They had some...so the...the Israeli\nintelligence was able to find out...the Haganah...that there was a convoy coming in from\nLebanon full of arms and ammunitions for the Arabs. Let me tell you, that I saw\npersonally. And I have never seen a thing like this in my life. For several days, the entire\n_ Cal the houses along the main road Haifa Beirut were emptied.\nNow, the Arabs, of course, didn't know that. And there were several members of the\nHaganah and the PALMA waiting in hiding because they...they knew that the convoy\nwas coming but they did know when exactly...the precise time. And...uh...by sheer\ncoincidence, I was not involved in...1n any of those actions at the time, I just happened to\ncome to _____ with a truck which I is I...I used to bring food and all kinds of things from\nHaifa to Nahariyya during this period. And I just had arrived barely in Kayathim... was a\nbig, big circle. And all of a sudden, all Hell broke loose. This convoy had come in with\nthe arms at the other end on the north side of Kayat...uh... Kayathim...Kayat valley.\nAnd...uh...of course, it appears that not just there was several...uh...private cars,\nautomobiles, sedans, and there was some Araban Legion trucks. And apparently each one\nof them had some sort of dynamite in it. Not only did they have some dynamite in it, they\nalso had some officers of the...uh...the Arab Legion in it. So the result was, it was\njust...uh...very tragic for the...for the convoy, because...uh...no one came out of it alive.\nNot a single person! But what I saw and that I'll never forget in my life, for as long as I\nlive. The British police and the British army...of course, they immediately\nsurrounded...closed the roads. Okay? And...uh...you could smell the fire. You could smell\nbodies burning. You could see the fires because we were right there. Okay? But I'll never\nforget in my life is when the British...when all this action disappeared...several Israelis\nwere also actually hurt because one young man from the Haganah, he just went the head\nof that truck and he then became...he received the highest medal from the Israeli army\nbecause he was the one who really went to the middle of the road and just stopped that\ntruck. He just shot everybody...whatever the truck as the truck was coming to him, and he\nhimself in turn was blown up, and his face...uh...I can't remember his name...they had all\nthe plastic operations and a year, etc., etc., and he was for a longest time hospitalized. But\nthe point is... wanted to make, when I saw the British officers, British police\nwith....uh...portable...uh...what do you call this...uh...when you put somebody...it's made\nof canvas, you know.",
        "A: No. Not a body bag. No. No. No. Uh...if someone is injured, for instance..",
        "A: Stretchers. I beg your pardon. They used to have stretchers. Okay? And...uh...they would\nput a stretcher next to a body. Now that body...uh...those that I have seen... saw at the\ntime without a head, without arms, etc. They didn't touch the bodies as such. They used\nsticks, and with sticks they used to push the bodies into the stretcher. Okay? And then\nthey went like this...one...two...three, and dumped the body into the pickup trucks that\nthey had. I'll never forget it in my life. Never! I thought it was so inhuman...no matter if it\nwas Arab, if it was a Jew, he was dead...the person, whoever was left. And I thought he\nwould be treated a little more...with some dignity, and not as if you tossing a pail of\ngarbage into the truck. But they did it. It was very, very cold...cold. And...uh...so we\nafterwards, we had to wait several hours. We were allowed in when they cleaned up on\nthe roads, etc., and the mess...we were allowed to go to Nahariyya in our convoy when\nwe met.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I stayed in Israel until 1959. That's when I left basically.",
        "A: Well I (clearing throat) after the war I... became a tourist driver guide, licensed by the\ngovernment and...uh...I had one of the blue license. There was a red and a blue. I was not\na biblical scholar, but I did have and I do have a basic knowledge of the western Galilee,\nand I was familiar so I drove many, many....uh...tourists... dignitaries. Uh...I\ndrove...uh...Polish...uh...commission. They were making a film in the western Galilee. I\ndrove...uh...I drove the Turkish Consul-General to Jerusalem...uh...the new one that came\nto...to Israel at the time. I drove...uh...a....uh...Jewish Parliamentary Commissions that\ncame to visit also the western Galilee. Uh...I was assigned at one time, and I\ndrove...uh...[saac Bensfee, the President of Israel at the time, and his wife. They sat in the\nback of my car, and in the front...uh...we picked up in Auspina on the way to...uh...the\nexcavations of Hotsora at the time...uh...we picked up the very famous archaeologist,\n____uh...God bless their...their souls. Uh...He was the leading...uh...archaeologist in the\ncountry, and at the time he was also the Chief of Staff of the Israel Army. So we drove to\nthe excavations of Hotsor in western Galilee. It was the most fascinating experience in\nlife to listen to these biblical scholars speaking about how Joshua had taken over the\nmountains from the Canaanites. And it was a fascinating experience.",
        "A: I had the...the great honor of meeting a very charming...uh ...older lady in Israel which\nis...uh...was my wife's great mother. And she used to live in New Rochelle, New York.\nShe came to visit Israel on a few occasions. I only met her once. She was quite a elderly\nlady, and somehow or another we then had a little reunion, and it was discussed that...uh\n...perhaps we should come and stay with her family in the United States because myself I\nonly had a brother in Israel at that time. And my wife had these cousins and...and so\nforth. And then a little bit later on, again by...by...by sheer coincidence, there was another\nmember from the United States, a father-in-law of my wife's cousin. He had, at the time,\narrived to visit Israel and I had a meeting with him with my mother-in-law and he was a\nvery exciting man. He was a Polish Jewish fellow...uh...namely Abe Rockland was his\nname, God bless his soul. And he told me in his broken English, he said, \"You should\ncome to America yesterday.\u201d And..uh...kind of I...I start to think a little bit more in that.\nNow I always liked United States. As a child in Portugal, I used to love to read.\nBooks...the little booklets about Buffalo Bill. That was my number one hero was Buffalo\nBill. And the buffalo and the...and the things...fights with the Indians and all that sort of\nthings. I used to read a lot. And that's how I...I read a lot of it in...in...I couldn't quite\nunderstand English at that time, but I forced myself and taught myself some English. And\nso I always had the good vision that the United States, of course, 1s...1s the greatest in the\nworld. And it is. And...uh...and we decided then to immigrate, to come to the United\nStates, and we left Israel...uh...1n 1959, and we came to the United States in 1959. My\nwife, Miriam, and my daughter, Tamara, my son, Daniel, and my son, Michael. Uh...My\ndaughter, Tamara, went to Switzerland to live with the rest of the family after she\ngraduated from high school. My son, Daniel, of course...uh... stayed in...with us,\nand...uh...he joined the army without my knowledge...uh...joined the Vietnam war. He\nvolunteered to...uh...to...to go to Vietnam. And...uh...although (clearing throat) I am very,\nvery proud of him because...uh...he served with great honors...the...uh...with the Green\nBerets, and also with the Ninth Armed Calvary. And he was shot down four\ntimes...uh...from the helicopters. He used to be with the...uh...the...uh...the\nsmall...uh...OV helicopters, the observations helicopters. And fortunately enough, he was\nalways fell in some rice paddies or within the area that he was not...never injured.\nUh....he jumped out of the choppers actually, when the choppers were...were attacked.\nAnd...uh...he's very heavily (clearing throat) honored ...uh...Presidential citations and\nbronze stars. He has three bronze stars and many other medals, and I'm very, very proud\nof him. And Michael, my younger son, works with me in the business.",
        "A: Sure. Sure.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Alright. It's...uh...",
        "A: Okay. I...uh...uh...1 understand that you would like to know a little bit more about the\nsituation in the soup kitchen...uh...perhaps some numbers of refugees that came by and\nwhat was the...the situation, the atmosphere. Uh...It's...uh...sometimes difficult...uh...to go\nback so many years and...and be able to precisely memorize on what happen then.\nUh...But something of very interest that I should have and I did not mention earlier,\nwas...uh...by a sheer coincidence, as I told you before, I happened to be a cousin to\nSenator from Minnesota, Rudy Boshwitz, through my wife because of the marriage. And\nhis wife, Ellen Boshwitz, was one of the refugees that passed through Lisbon at that point\nin time in history. But I don't remember meeting her then, because she was much\nyounger. She was a younger person than me. And I do not remember...I don't she was\nnecessarily at the soup kitchen because not all the refugees that came to Portugal were at\nthe soup kitchen. Some of the refugees...they...they were persons of means that were able\nto somehow manage to bring some money with them, some...and they were able to stay\nin...in hotels and...uh...for a given period of time. And...uh...and I understand that Ellen\nand her family...they left Lisbon by boat to Brazil, and then from Brazil, they came to the\nUnited States. But...uh...most of the other refugees that really had no means and were\nwaiting for visas to...uh...to... uh...1mmigrate to the Unites States, to Israel, to South\nAmerica, etc., etc...uh...there was a time 1n...uh...Portugal when...uh...many of these\nrefugees' visas had expired, and they are allowed to stay a given period of time, if 1t was\n3 months, 6 months, etc. And as a result the...uh...the Portuguese, if I may say so, are\nvery...the Portuguese language is a very complete language. They say ______.\nEverything is to be just so. Uh...And they're very particular. And the reason they're law-\nabiding. So...so when the refugees visas expired, the next step was you are jailed. Simple\nas that! Now, you have here...uh...uh...a large group of people, reasonable large, several\nhundred people that suddenly, while they were able to escape the Nazi persecution and\nthe Nazi armies, are being put in jail in Lisbon with common criminals. And the sad part\nis, of course, that most of these people in large numbers were academicians. They were\ndoctors. They were engineers. They were scientists, etc., businessmen, etc. So the\nPortuguese-Jewish community and I believe again here, in conjunction with the\nAmerican Joint Committee, asked the government of Portugal to allow these\nrefugees...to...to assign to these refugees some small villages surrounding Lisbon so\nthey...they could with some ...some dignity live in there, until they were able to receive\nvisas to leave Portugal. And this was granted. There was several little villages. I can't\nremember...I think one of them that I remember is ____ that was allowed for refugees\nto stay there. They were not allowed to move out of these villages without the permission\nof the Portuguese...uh...Naturalization Immigration Department, because they were very\nstrict. Uh... The president of the time of the Jewish community in Lisbon was Professor\nOnsolack. Uh...He was the professor of...uh...science in the University of Lisbon. And\nironically...uh...it is often said that he was good friend with the Prime Minister Salosar.\neven though that Solsar give orders to _____ not to issue visas to Jews...uh...on the\nside, the Portuguese government was very strict. And I cannot, as I said earlier,\npersonally say, that I was persecuted by the Portuguese government. I was not as such.\nUh...That Jews were persecuted by the Portuguese government, I can't say that either.\nEither than the fact that ____ was removed from his position, that it is true of the\nPortuguese people, not the government, that they were very helpful to the Jewish\nrefugees. In many instances! And many stores even, I understand, even giving them\nclothing. Although I have tendency to disagree with some of the statistics that are coming\nout from the Portuguese government side stating that over 40,000 Jewish refugees came\nto Lisbon. I...I know...I'm quite certain that...that as many refugees as I saw in the soup\nkitchen, I did not see 40,000 refugees come to the soup kitchen. If indeed there were\nrefugees that came to Portugal and somehow they...those that you never knew\nabout...they...they came in; they stayed a few days in a hotel; they got a visa; they kept on\ngoing to South America or...or...or North America or...or...or Palestine or Israel or other\ncountries for that matter, I do not know. I do not know. And...uh...in as much as the\natmosphere itself in the soup kitchen, it was..uh...I tried to bring back my...my mental\nmemory...uh...and look at these families sitting on the table and...uh...and...uh...they were\nnot happy faces to say the least. You could always see sad faces. Okay? Faces of\nwhen...when a person is concerned, when you are worried about...uh...whatever happened\nto...to your mother, your father, your uncle, your aunt, your niece, your brother, your\nsister? You don't know. You didn't know. You were the lucky one. You were able to\nmake it. You run away fast. You..you were lucky to do it. You saved your life. What\nhappened to the other ones? And it was very difficult. And it was a concern because as\nyou well know, Jewish are so very emotional, and...uh...there were many a tears in the\nkitchen soup, many a tears and you could see...you could observe that. Uh...And yet there\nwas...uh...as I told you before about this fellow, Gustof Zumick, repairing the shoes of\nother refugees. That was the least he could have done to help his fellow...fellow...fellow\nin...in...1n this instance you know. So there was a...a...a still a little bit of a sense\n..Of...uh...of, \"I am your...my brother's keeper,\" you know. That's a atmosphere that I can\nbest describe. Helping someone with the nothing that you have, you know. And I think it\nwas very typical of the...of the Jews at the time, helping each other with the least that\nthey had, with the nothing that they had. So I don't know if I answered your question.",
        "A: (Sigh) Yes. I...I'm having a hard time keeping my tears inside me. Because every time\nwhen I think about these things, you know...uh...I happen to be Jewish too and very\nemotional too. It's hard to keep them down. Really. It's...uh...my friends that were killed\nduring the war and....uh...even some of the what I saw in Europe with the dispersed\npersons and...uh... Later on in Israel, if I may add that too, as I became a tourist driver\nguide, there was a kibbutz by the name of ____.. In English, it's called the ghetto of\nfighters. I was very, very fortunate again because I was called on more than one\noccasions...many, many times, to drive one of the leaders of the ghetto fighters. His name\nwas Isaac Zuckerman. Yes. And I drove that man so many times, taking him from the\nkibbutz, bringing him to Nahariyya, bring him to Haifa, bring him here, bring him there.\nAnd there was a girl by the name of Miriam. I cannot remember her other number. But\nshe was also one of the few...[saac Zuckerman and Miriam were one of the few Jewish\npeople that were able to...to get out of the Warsaw....Warsaw ghetto alive. I guess most of\nthe leaders were all killed by the...by the ...by the Germans, by the Nazis armies. But they\nsurvived. And...uh...as the kibbutz was being from...from the very beginning...uh...which\nwas built near a Roman aqueduct in...about 5 kilometers south of Nahartyya, ___, as 1t\nwas built up, of course, I used to bring tourists over there also to visit the kibbutz\n_. But this was... uh...one of the last things really I...that it was very, very touching.\nAnytime you went to the...into the ghetto's fighters, as they were building the kibbutz and\ntalking to these people and...and witnessing the things that they did to humanbeings,\nmaking soap out of hair and skins and children, that was...uh...uh... As far as I'm\nconcerned...I'm...I'm one of those that believe in the philosophy that never again...I'm\ngonna die with some dignity, as opposed to just submit.",
