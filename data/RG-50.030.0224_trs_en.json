I was\nmarried to a wonderful husband...was a beautiful man, and I was the happiest in the...in\nthe world. Nobody was...I don't think nobody was so happy like I was. And everybody\nwas envying me what...he was something. It wasn't another person like him. We were\nmarried 3 months. He used to live in the Bookavena, and I went with him. He had a very\nbig store. (Sign) And he made a beautiful living. He was a very big businessman. And 3\nmonths after I was married, then it starts a terrible tragedy. It was in...hen...then it\nstarted...the...the...you know, some people let out the...all the communists from the...from\nthe jails and they started to hit Jewish people. Jewish people couldn't go in the streets.\nJewish people couldn't go in the trains. Whoever went in a train, they used to take him off\nthe hands. They take him off the...the tongue. They cut him off the ears. They take him\nout the eyes. A lot of people they killed. And they put them in the windows. You want\nto...to buy kosher. You want to...to buy kosher meat. Here you could buy kosher meat. It\nwas Jewish meat. You know, the Jewish people. This went on a few weeks and then\nwhere we used to live...I used to live in Kominash. This was Lisatravel...not far from\nthere. And on a nice day, some people came and they took out everything from the stores.\nHe came home. He told me what happened. So was nothing to do. I had there his\nuncles....very...you know, scholared people. Rabbis. They was very rich. They had very\nbig stores. They was...uh...you know, with the...uh...they were very big businessman.

He had two children. They took him out and they asked him, \"Which children do\nyou like best?\" So he had...one was one was another... he said, This son I like,\" so they\nkilled first that son. Then they killed the father, and then they killed the first son. And\nthen the...it was in May. It was very hot. He was laying there maybe for 7 days in the\nheat. And then my husband went in the night and he made them graves and he put them\nin in the earth. And we thought everything 1s fine. I mean after this...and it was a few\nmonths soldiers came. It was on a Friday. And everybody from us had to leave. We was\nafraid they shouldn't kill us. About two weeks we was in the...in the woods. We didn't\nhave any water. We didn't have any food. We had one little baby from | year old. He\ndidn't eat for 2 weeks. It was my nephew. Just that he start to cry, his mother put in the\nfinger in the mouth and she said, Menge, Shhh. Be quiet. We was afraid somebody\nshouldn't hear we are there. So the...the child was even 6, 5 years...5, 6 years, he always\nsaid...he was...he had this in his head. He was | year old then, and he said, \"Shh. You're\nnot allowed to talk.\" So we were 2 weeks there and I wasn't with my husband. I was\nseparated. We ran away. He was...it was in the day time. He was by work. I was at\nhome.\u201d* So we ran in the woods and we didn't know from each other. And...and one\nFriday we came home. We thought everything is alright.

And then\ncame 2 soldiers...came in in the house, and he went to my aunt and he told her, \"Give me\nthe money what you have.\" So she said, \"I don't have any money.\" So they...they killed\nher on the spot. She was almost dead. They killed her in the throat. She had that child was\nthis size. She went over to him and kissed him. (Crying) And the blood was by the child\nof the...of the clothing. We couldn't wash it. He went with this maybe 2, 3 weeks,\nwithout change, without anything. The mother passed away. He survived. And then my\nhusband heard...1t was her name was the same like mine, Toby. So they said they killed\nToby. So he was...1t was 3 months after we were married. So he was...you can imagine.\nHe was very upset. And he...what can you do, you know. He...he couldn't come to the\nhouse. Then after he came home... No., we went...we heard some people out in the woods\nstill, so we went to look for them, and I saw my husband.",
        "Q: Mrs. Stern, they asked if you would remove your necklace cause it's rubbing on your\nmicrophone.",
        "A: Okay. So when he saw me, he almost fainted. He thought I'm dead. He said, \"Toby, I\nheard the people killed you.\" So I said, it was \"Auntie Toby.\" So he...he was happy he\nhave me. So he took me by my hands. He left everybody, his mother, his sister, brothers\nHe had eight sisters and brothers, and he took me to a...to a Gentile house, we should hide\nwhere we was still...was afraid. It was 5 in the morning, and we went, just me and him.\nWe didn't talk. We was afraid somebody shouldn't hear it. We walked like on the air\nsomebody shouldn't hear the walking. So we came to the house where he made business\nwith that guy, my husband and he asked him, \"Please, let he hide in your house.\" He said,\nGadalia, I couldn't do it. I'm afraid.\" Everybody knew when you hide a Jew, so you have\nto give your life. He said, \"I'm a father. I have children. I couldn't do that.\" So he begged\nhim. He said, \"Look, you know with whom you talk.\" So he said, \"Okay.\" They put us in\nthe cellars, and they covered us up, you know, with boxes and things people shouldn't...in\ncase somebody comes, they shouldn't see we are there. But I don't know somehow one\nperson saw us and they told us he hided two Jews. So two soldiers came. First, the man\ncame. and he said, \"Gadalia, I am sorry. They want to kill me. I have to give you out.\"\nAnd he said, \"Try. Tell him you...you know we are not here.\" He said, \"I couldn't.\nPlease.\" So we came out, and the soldiers saw us. They took us out, and they just said,\n\"You're Jews. You're not going to live anymore.\" So they told us we should pick up our\nhands and they had the bayonets just to kill us. So my husband had a few remain, you\nknow, money, and he had a lot of bills. He didn't have too much money then. They took\nus away from us. So he put the money on the...you know, on the end, and the bills in the\nmiddle and he give them a bunch. They thought they have a lot of money. So they said,\n\"Run away, and go hide of another place. I let you go.\" So we quickly ran away, and then\nwe came again to the house. Food we didn't have. There was a carton eggs. So my\nmother-in-law put the eggs in a oven...not even we didn't have a...a....nothing to cook\nin it, and she baked the eggs and we ate...everybody had something. You know, for 2\nweeks, we didn't have anything. So we were there a few days, and we didn't have what to\ndo. Money we didn't have. The store they took away from us. The houses they took away\nfrom us. We went to . It was a little....uh...a town. So my husband went in the morning\nto...shul in and the \u201d ...uh...",
        "Q: Major",
        "A: The mayor saw him. He was his best friend. He told him, \"Mr. \u201d You...now you have a\nchance. Go to the primary and tell them whatever they took from you and you gonna get\nem back.\" So who knew...you know he went and he captured them. The...so they took\nabout 50 people like this and they kept them a few days. I went to them once or twice.\nThey let me I should see him. And then they said they're gonna kill him. They not going\nto leave him free. They took him away in a truck and they put him in a concentration\ncamp. Thank God, they didn't kill him then He wrote he some...uh...letters, you know,\nand I wrote him back. But he could never have my letters. They just tease but I wrote\nhim. He didn't...he was afraid. Maybe something is in the letters. You know, they\nhad....they never give him the letters to him. So he was 6 months in capture. So I went\nwith my mother-in-law. She...you know, she liked me very much. I loved her just like a\nmother. She was very good to me. And my brother-in-laws, my sister*in-laws. Today,\neven I married 40...43 years it's gonna be I'm married now, and they still...I'm her sister-\nin-law. And I...I came home. I was pregnant. I didn't know. So my brother...there's a in\nthe army. He was in the army, my youngster brother, and he took me to my mother's\nhome in Romania. This was in the Bookerwene, and I was living at my mother's. Well,\nmy husband wasn't there. My mother-in-law she used to go...we didn't have any\nmoney...she used to go everyday in the market. She used to bring me...she had her own\nchildren. She never give anything for the children. I...I didn't feel good. I didn't know I\nwas pregnant then. She didn't know. But I was laying, and she said, \"Toby has to\nhave...she's such a young kin. Gadalia is not here. So she has to take care of me.\" So it\nwas too hard for her. So my brother came in and took me from there and he bring me to\nmy mother's. So I came here. Everybody was...you know, they thought he's killed. The\npeople knew, you know, everybody who took away, they killed them. So my friends\ncame, \"Poor Toby, she's such a young child. She's pregnant. She doesn't have a husband\nnow.\" But 6 months after...and one day he came home. And I don't have to tell you....you\nknow, was...when we see each other. So when he came home it was Hungarian. It was\n1940. The Hungarian came in. We were Romanian. In\n1940, Hungarian took over Romania. And it wasn't such a pleasant thing. It was very\nrough. They start demonstrate, start the...you know...And he came home and he wasn't\nregistered. It was about 3 or 4 months after the Hungarian was already there. And they\nsaid then the people wasn't right away when the Hungarian came, they are...you know,\ndoesn't belong to the...to the Hungarian, they have to go back from where they come. But\nI wanted...I didn't know where to go. My home was tooken. My store was taken away, so\nwe stayed by...by my mother. So but he wasn't registered. So we didn't know what to do.\nWe tried. My brother went to whatever place and we paid money and they registered him\nand he was when the Hungarian came in. So was...we were very happy. And he was...he\nwas...he never went out. He was afraid. He didn't know, you know.. he's allowed to go\nout. So he was like a capture by me in the house. He was very religious. He went\neveryday to the synagogue. It was in the winter. He took a...he used to hock, you know.\nIt was frozen...the water. The windows were broken already, so he took and he opened\nthe ice, and he went into the waters. And he was there until 1942. I had my baby. Was\nvery happy. I was...My baby was born 1940, March 28. It was. It was a very happy day.\nHe was in the house. I had the baby in the house. Then, you know, there they...we didn't\nhave hospitals like it's here. So I had my baby, and we were very happy. Later, the baby\nwas very sick. We didn't have money from...you know, we went to doctors, but they\ndidn't know what it was. So I had to go to city...to a big city, and I was there a few days. I\nwent to one doctor, to a second doctor, and they said, \"What did you do with your baby?\nYou didn't give him to eat.\" He was eating right away. He went..I...you know, he didn't\ncatch anything. So I was by my family. And the mother....this is my sister-in-law today,\nmy youngest brother's wife. Her mother...she was a very nice lady. So she said, \"Toby,\nyou couldn't lose nothing. Just try and take...1t was a very old doctor. And she said, \"Call\nthis doctor. If this doctor's not going to help you, nobody would.\" So the children all was\nlaughing, \"Ma, he's such an old man. Why do you want...\" So she said, \"Just call him.\"\nHe came to us. We saw the baby. He couldn't believe it. He was skin and bones. So he\ngave him a medicine. The first thing I gave him the medicine he...the baby was fine. We\ncame home. You know, he survived. He was a beautiful baby. And we were struggling.\nYou know, my husband couldn't go out. He couldn't make money. He was afraid. And\nthen was...in 1940 was he born. And then again pregnant again. 1942...my...they called\nhim to ...uh...labor...to work. And then we knew it already, it was start...1t was a very bad\nthing we registered him. When we don't register him, they don't know from him, and he\nwould be alive even today. But we didn't know, and we made this. You know, they called\nhim in. And I was pregnant and he went away. So I packed him some stuff. And he forgot\nsome gloves. And it was a very cold...1t was in December and I ran after him I should\ngive him the gloves. I catched a cold, and I was very sick then and I lost the baby in the\n8th month. I was very upset. I used to cry. My husband went away. He knew, you know,\nwe have a baby. When he comes back I am gonna have another. And then he gonna come\nin in the house and he say, \"Toby, where is the other baby?\" What I'm gonna tell him? I\nwas...I was crying, but I didn't know he will never come back again. (Crying) Then in...in\nFebruary I heard after...after the liberation he was killed with 35,000 people. But I didn't\nknow. A lot of people get letters. You know, they was missing. a lot of people get letters,\nyou know, he's there. But I didn't get anything, but I never believed he's not alive. So I\nwaited every day I should get something. But 1t never came. And then it...we came\nalready to 1944. It was holidays. It was...and then in April...it was on a Friday, we cooked\na Saturday you know, the meal...everybody. And my child was very sick. He had fevers.\nHe had very high fever. And soldiers came in the house and they said, \"10 minutes I give\nyou. Pack everything. You have to go to the synagogue.\" So I begged the soldiers that\nlook, my child is so sick. Please leave me here. We knew already they're going to take us\nto the ghetto. So he took...he hit me, and he called me some names. He said you couldn't\nstay here. You have to go. He doesn't care the baby is sick. So I didn't have nothing what\nto do, so I took some stuff and we packed everything in the synagogue. The meal was on\nthe stove. We went away. Over Saturday, we was there in the shul and Sunday they....or\nSaturday, they took us with a...we didn't have cars...horse and carriages. And every\nfamily, they packed, and they took us to the ghetto. So we came in in the ghetto. It was in\na room maybe 30, 50, 20 people, but Thank God, we had the family. We had my\ngrandmother, my aunt, my children. We weren't with strangers. But we didn't...we sat in\nthe floor. Food we didn't have. We couldn't take any food. And I had, you know, then my\nchild and my aunt had nine children. My grandmother was old already, and we had to sit\non the floor, to sleep on the floor. It was about 4 weeks like that. I went out everyday to\nold people. I washed them. I cut them the nails. I cut them the hair. I cleaned them up.\nAnd, you know, they begged me...please, we couldn't go out. We didn't have what to do,\nso I went every single day. And I did it. When I was a young girl...I forget to tell you...in\nhome every week, it wasn't too many rich people by us, so I went every week to\ntake...like to beg for other people, not for me...where we had for ourselves enough. But\nwe was on the first categories, like we weren't so poor. So everybody came and said,\n\"Toby, you could go to take...they're not going to take it, take it for yourself, but other\npeople, they need it and the children are...you know, they are embarrassed to go to beg.\nSo I went every single week, you know, in the house. They didn't have no money. They\ngive a little potatoes, a little beans, a little flour, you know, until some...one house to\nhouses, we made something and we...they gave this to the poor, you know, that they\nshould have for the...and there was a lot of sick people. Every night there was a young\nchildren, I used to go to be I used to be compression.",
        "Q: Compress.",
        "A: Compress, you know, for sick, typhus people. I didn't care I'm gonna get sick or not. I\nnever slept in my house. There was a lot of old people. Everybody came. My mother was\na wonderful woman. They said, \"Give me Toby for the night.\" They were afraid to sleep\nby theirself. Every single night...I don't know, my mother, she let me go from one house\nto...whoever wanted, she...she wanted to please the people and I went. It wasn't such a\nclean houses, but I...I still went and I didn't complain. I did a lot for people. I wanted to\nhelp, and I did it and I very happy I could do it. And I'm gonna go back from the\nAuschwitz, you know, from the...from the ghetto. So my child was then 3 and a half years\nold. He used to play with my brother the the chess. A...a chess...you know, he was so\nsmart, he was...you couldn't believe it. And my brother was there. Then we had friends.\nThey came. One friend I had, he asked me, \"Toby, what did you do with your jewelry?\" I\nhad a lot of jewelry. So I said, \"Before we came to the ghetto, I hide this. I make a\npackage. I had my mother's jewelry and my jewelry and I...I put away...not I knew where\nit is, that nobody can find it. So he said, \"Toby, you have a child. Go back. I go with you.\nTake your jewelry. For a ring, for a earring, you could buy a bread. You could buy milk.\nYou...you'll be able to survive.\" So we went out from the ghetto. When they catch us,\nthey would...uh...shoot us. But we went away four people. I took my jewelry, and I was\nvery happy I brought it to the ghetto. Then we hear the people, before they go to the\ntrains, they take away everything. So I said, \"What I'm gonna give them the gold, my\njewelry?\" So there was a girl. She was a friend with my brother. She was very rich. Her\nfather has a big store. And this house near them was in the ghetto. So the girl told my\nbrother, \"You have...I know you have the jewelry.\" He told her, you know, I have my\njewelry here. She said, \"GlIve it to me.\" They have a hiding place in the basement and she\nhides her things and she's gonna hide our things and when we come back, we gonna have\nit. So she begged my brother. He said, \"Booda, please come see where I put it. Nobody\nknows whose gonna come back. So my brother thought, you know, maybe nobody's\ngonna take it, they're gonna think he took it. So he didn't want to go. So I met her in\nAuschwitz, that girl, and I begged her. I said, \"Please, tell me where did you put the\njewelry.\" She said, \"I'm not gonna tell you.\" And she never survived. We came back, me\nand my brother. We went through the whole cellar. We couldn't find it. And we didn't\nhave it. So when I came home...so then in one day...and 4 weeks after they took us to the\ntrains. So they packed us, about 120 people, old people, young people, no water. They\ngave us a little water. We went about 4. 3 days...3, 4 days...5 days, I don't remember. I\nhad my child. Old, old people. We didn't have a toilet. It was in the cattle cars. People\nwere dying. People were screaming. It was smelling. You could die. You know, it was\nterrible. We begged a little waters from the SS. Nobody was hearing us. Nothing. So we\ncame to Auschwitz. We came down from this...we were so happy they opened the...the\ncars. We came down. They start to hit us. Go there, Go there, Go there, Go there.\nEverybody wanted to be with their families we should lose each each. We should be\ntogether. So I.... had my child. I was young. I was really beautiful. And a man then went\nthis side to me. He said, \"Give away the child for a older lady.\" So I asked him why. I\ntold my brother, \"Booda, Go and ask why should I give away the baby.\" He...he start to\nlook. He disappeared. You thought he went into the earth. You didn't see him. Then a\nsecond...uh...guy came. And he said, \"Give away the baby.\" And it was almost by\nMengele. It wasn't too far there. My...I used to live with my mother, so I give the baby to\nmy...to my mother. And I hear right now (crying) how he cried, \"Mommy, I want to go\nwith you. I want to stay with Mommy.\" So I was by Mengele, and he told he I should go\nthis side. My mother with my child the other side. When I heard him, and I hear him\ntoday. I hear him every single day, \"Mommy, I want to go with you. I don't want to stay\nwith Bobby.\" (Crying) I wanted to ran after them. They disappeared. I never saw them.\n(Crying) Then they came with the people, with the young people. I had there cousins. I\nwas crying. I wanted to go with my child. So they said, \"Why're you crying. Some day,\nyou're gonna be with him.\" They told us we gonna to work, and all the people with\nchildren and they go...you know, they're going to mind the children, and we're gonna\ncome every Sunday to see them. (Crying) But that Sunday never came. And, you know,\nthat...then we went to...to the C lagers. I was there 3 months. And we waited to see the\nchildren. We waited to see the children. They gave us the food. They gave us a little piece\nof bread. I didn't want to eat it. I said, \"With this little bread, I am not going to be\nsatisfied.\" So every single day I put my bread and I kept it. In the night the people took it\naway from me. I had there a cousin, and I tell she wouldn't survive. And she saw I am not\ngoing to eat. I used to cry, and she said, \"You know, Toby, I would like we should be\ntogether. You get the bread. You eat it. I get mine. We gonna...we're gonna share. She\nsaw that I am gonna die. So every...so...first of all I didn't want to. Then I said, \"Okay.\"\nThen every day, the SS came and they asked, \"Who is sick? Who is pregnant? They\nshould...uh...present to them. They gonna take us revere. They're gonna give us better\nfood. You know, so I wanted to go. I said, \"I'm gonna say I'm pregnant.\" I wasn't, but I\nwanted to go to see my baby. I didn't know how I could go out from the C lager. So my\nbrother, \"Toby, you're not gonna go. You're not gonna leave me. I don't know who lives.\nI want you with me.\" So I wanted another day. But Iam gonna go to see my child. And I\nwas 3 months in C lager. The next lager was B. There was a family camp with the\nCzech...Czechoslovakia people...families, husbands, wife and children. So they said,\n\"You see, our children live. You have here next lagers, you know, families, so all the\npeople with the children are in a different lager, so we're gonna see them. Three months\nafter we were there and one night we hear screams and was crying and they never let us\nout from the...from the...when it was a transport came in. We were outside. They told us\nto go in...1in the barracks. When the people came...when they selected the people to go to\nthe crematorium, they didn't want we should see. We saw the fires. You know, we saw\nthe flames until the sky. We smelled the...the...the meat...what they burned in the\ncrematoriums. We weren't too far from there. So we didn't know what it was. So they\nsaid, the people die...old people die. You know, we don't...we don't want to make graves.\nWe burned the people but...uh...people, you know, alive..children, they're not gonna do\nthat. So one day I...I met a friend. I was too...I was very...I was crying. I wanted my baby.\nI was missing him very much. I wanted my mother. So she said, \"Toby, I heard...\" You\nknow, she had seven children. \"Don't cry. They give them white bread. They gave them\nmilk. They gave them chicken soup. They give them chicken. They are wonderful the\nchildren.\" So she had seven children there. She's...so I said, \"Maybe, you know.\" We\nwanted they should live. We didn't think they don't live anymore. For 6 months we didn't\nknow what to think. We saw. We heard. We knew everything, but we didn't believe it.\nWe didn't want to take it in our heads. You know, people for what? What did they do the\nchildren? What do the older people? Why they should kill people they didn't do any...any\nharm? So after the 3 months when I was in the...the C lager. So the next day when they\ntook out the Czech...the Czech people, the families. They took them to the crematorium.\nNobody...one was alive. So they took us to the baths in the crematorium. They selected us\nyou know, and we went there to work. And 2 or 3 months we didn't do a thing. We\nwent...when we went to the crematorium, so we said...we looked in the back and said,\n\"What...what you think we're gonna come back that way? Or we gonna stay there?\"\nWhen we came in in the back, the first time when we came, the first time when we came\nto the crematorium...so when we went in there to the...to the baths what they said we have\nto be clean. We shouldn't make very...the lagers and then we saw the band there. It was\nplaying Albeit Macht Frei. It was beautiful. It was clean you know. So we went in there.\nIt was soldiers. So they told...they told us we should take off our clothes. So how could\nyou take off clothes when men are there? So we went...you know, we...we didn't want to\ndo it. So they start to hit us. And we didn't have any choice, and we did it. So the first\ntime when I went in the crematorium I didn't see and I didn't know what's going on, but\nwhen we came back I saw already they had them...the knobs. One was for gas. One was\nfor water. It was the same room. (Crying) Excuse me It was the same room, you know,\nwhere they kill the people, and we were in there 2 days. So for us they gave the water.\nAnd we came back. We came to the same lager and then they selected us to go to work.\nA lot of people went to, you know to the dresses...not to dresses...to all things we were\nfixing there. People went commando. People went trade...to make grey...you know,\nlike...uh...to hide people, you know, bunkers...built, you know, and it was cold in the\nwinter. We didn't...we didn't have any clothes and we didn't have shoes. They gave us\nshoes like from...uh...wood. You couldn't bend the feet. It was just a hole and you\njust...and you know when you put in the feet, the skin went up in them. The blood was\nrunning, but who cared. A lot of people they didn't...we didn't think we gonna survive. I\nwanted to survive. I wanted to see my baby. I wanted to see my husband. And I tried.\nOne day it was. We had friends, you know. We was religious. Not all of us, but a few\ngirls was fasting. We didn't eat on that day. But one girl found a...a handkerchief, and she\nwashed this. And she...she went, you know, there was the electric...uh...",
        "Q: Fence.",
        "A: The fence there. After this was like this, another fence, you know, just a wire. You're not\nallowed to go the other side. So this wire she put on the top, you know, the handkerchief,\nit should dry. And I don't know what happened. A wind came and the handkerchief flew\noff. She went to pick up the handkerchief and she was black like she was electrics...",
        "Q: Electrocuted.",
        "A: Electrocuted. In...in the spot there. A lot...a lot of times I wanted to do that. I said what I\nhave to, you know, but I thought maybe...I...I didn't want nobody should have my\nhusband. I said I am not going to give nobody, you know, he should take away my\nhusband. I want to survive and I didn't do it. So we went every 4 weeks when we were in\nthe, you know, by work to take baths. And...and you know they put us in. We didn't have\nclothes enough. And Hungarians, the last day they didn't have material enough. So they\nmade papers and I don't know with paper...with some things, they made materials. And\nthey put the materials in the machines to the dis...disinfect them. You know, they\nshouldn't be lice or something, and the clothes didn't come out. So a lot of people had\nclothes. And they came to me. I didn't have...I came home naked like my mother had me\nwhen I was born. I was 2 weeks without. I went out in a blanket. I took a blanket, you\nknow. From where I got a dress after, I don't remember, but I got one. Maybe it was in\nthe. I don't know who gave me and I had. Then people didn't have what to wear. They\ncame also who doesn't have dresses, we're gonna give you new dresses. They took them\nout, and they never came back. They took them to the crematorium, but they didn't have\nroom for them. Every 4 weeks they make selections. Mengele came in, and we had to\nstrip all our clothes. We were naked. We had to pick up one hand and...uh...to...went\nthrough..uh...Mengele to see. When you had anything on your body, a little pimple, you\nwent in the left side and a lot of people went to the ride side. But they separated sisters.\nThey separated cousins, a mother from a child. It was terrible when they separated the\npeople. One would...you know, one was running to the mother. One was running to the\nsister. There was a lots of confusion there, but they didn't want, you know. Even they\nknew they go...they didn't know they go to the crematorium. They thought gonna take us\nto another place. And when they took away the people, they never came back. One day\nwas there in Auschwitz. It was in a winter day. So one person was missing. So every half\nhour we went to c'est l'appell. Usually we made twice a day c'est l'appell, the morning\nand in the evening. And one day we saw SS. They came like they were crazy. A person\nwas missing. We were 32,000 peoples in one...uh...and see was 32 barracks, a thousand\npeople to barrack. You know, to a... And every half hour they took us for c'est I'appell.\nAnd they went like they were crazy. They came and who wasn't, you know...somebody\nwas moving or something and one day, they kneeled us. We had to go on the floors and\nthey put stones under our feet and we had to keep two big heavy stones and we didn't\nhave a move with a eye. When you moved, they killed you on the spot. They were...they\nwere crazy. It was about 3 days. And...and what happened a girl was sick or what. She\nfall asleep for 3 days and 3 nights. There was some benches outside. She was outside\nsleeping nobody would know. And this girl was missing. And that's why they made\nthis...this there. And one time the, you know, they count us again and everybody was\nthere. It was, you know...then they said, \"Who was missing? Who was missing?\" And\nthey found the girl. So they gave her a, you know a whole bread and a salami. We were\nso jealous you know. Why she get a bread and we get a little bit of bread. A whole salami\nthere. They told her, \"Eat how much you want.\" After she was finished to eat, they hang\nher. The called us all out to see how somebody runs away what happens to them. (Sigh)\nAnd it was 6 months after I...we were there in Auschwitz so the mother from the seven\nchildren...So we were there in the crematorium...there in the bath. So there was a man. He\nwas cleaning there. So he told me, \"Toby, I go ask the man. You know, mothers,\ngrandmothers to children came to take baths too.\" So I said, \"You're naked. How could\nyou go talk to a man.\" I was embarrassed to go. She said, \"I have to find out. I want to\nknow what's done with my children.\" So she went. I went to. I had a child. (Crying) So\nwe asked him, \"Tell me, when is older people come here with children to take baths.\" So\nthey start to laugh, the men. They said, \"You Hungarians! Dopes! You think Hitler is\ngonna give food for the children and after the war, you're gonna have big children.\n(Crying) The children not there the first day they came with your parent. So we was very\nupset. I said, \"No. It couldn't be. Not with 1944. It's not 1940. 1940 maybe they did it, but\nwe don't do it anymore. I said. \"Don't you see the fire. Don't you smell the...the smell.\nWhat you think is there. This is your children. This is your parents. (Crying) So then we\nknew already what happened to them. (Crying and drinking water). Then we were there\nuntil January 18. In Auschwitz. I was 9 months there. January 18th, we get up. We were,\nyou know..terrible how we slept....14 people in one bed. It was like...uh...the...three\nlayers...",
        "Q: Bunks.",
        "A: Three layers. But when I came I always was on top. I was afraid to be in the middle. I\nwas afraid to be well...the people...it wasn't too strong. It was from wood made. And one\nnight they...they used to break, and the people they was killed. They were...the hands\nbroken, feets broken, you know. So I always...when I came, the first I was up. I didn't\nwant to be in the bottom, they should kill me or hit me or what. (Sigh) So January 18,\nthey asked us we should go. We should take a blanket. They give us a whole bread, and a\ncan with meat. This came from America. And they said we gonna evacuate. So we start\nto walk. It was a lot of people. I mean the whole Auschwitz ran out there. The Russians\nthey came near. They didn't want they should capture us. So they took us further in away\nfrom them. So I always...I wasn't...uh...I couldn't say I was sick you know. I always was\nfrom the first to the fifth row. Cause when you walk you are in the back, you could never\nhold with the people. But in the front how much you walk the other people has to walk.\nSo I...l was between first and the fifth always, you know. We were walking in a few...we\nwere walking a few days but every...I don't know how many hours you walked, they gave\nus a little rest. We should sit. We should rest. So we rest a little, and then... And when\nthey say, you had to be up. If you are not, you were shot. They shot people like you\ncouldn't believe it. You know not everybody could get up. So we went a few days. We\ncame in the night...they gave...you know, we came to a place. It was a very, very big\nplace. It was in the winter, January. The snow was very high there. They don't clean snow\nlike in America. Snow was snow after a snow after a snow. So they said we're gonna rest.\nWe're gonna sleep. So they put us outside in the snow. We sat in the snow and we just\nsank. We sank. You know, the snow was soft and we didn't have the blankets. We threw\naway already. We couldn't carry it. But the bread we kept. The piece of meat we kept.\nYou know, we should have. But the blanket we didn't have. And we was outside sleeping.\nI mean we made a circle and we went so tight each other we should feel the warmth, you\nknow, we shouldn't... So we fall asleep. You're gonna be surprised. The SS went away\nand they left us the shepherds. Big shepherds. They was our, you know, our guards. And\nwhen you were moving, they killed you in the top...in the neck. You know, when\nsomebody was...wanted to go someplace...I mean, don't not to run away...you couldn't do\nit. The shepherds would kill you. So the more...I don't know how we slept, but we slept.\nAnd in the morning, you know, who waked up...here was a piece of ice, here was a piece\nof ice. More of half people, they didn't survive. The heart was... They couldn't...they\ncouldn't survive from the cold. So we walked about 5, 7 days and a lot of people was\nmissing. We didn't take off our shoes the whole time. When we take off the shoes, they\ntook it away from you. (Sigh) And then we thought we not gonna... We went to\nAusch...Ravensbruck. So they gave us a train. But a open train. It wasn't\nclosed...half...like a...you know the...for the...uh... It was open train. But the snow was\nfull. You know until the...so they go with a 120 girls in a...in a...uh...",
        "Q: Car or taxi.",
        "A: In a carriage. So we went in there and we threw out the snow we should have room. We\ncouldn't sit. We were standing like, you know, we couldn't move. 120 people. We went\nfor a few days. Eat....we didn't get too much. And they had soldiers. For every car, was 4\nsoldiers with the bayonets and nobody should run away. So we came to Auschwitz. But\nthere they didn't have room for us. There was...uh...uh...camp what people worked.",
        "Q: Which camp?",
        "A: Ravensbruck.",
        "Q: Ravensbruck.",
        "A: So there was a lot of people. So we came and, you know, it was January and it was\nbeautiful, fresh snow. And you know...and we came in there in the camp and they said we\nshould sit out that until they gonna have room where we...they should put us. So we were\nso thirsty. It wasn't 10 minutes you didn't think it was winter. We...the snow and the earth\ntogether...we took it like sugar...the back piece of cake and it was cleaned up. No more\nsnow. Was summer. We were there about 5, 6 days outside. No food. Cause you didn't\nhave food. Cause we weren't counted, you know. We weren't in the count for the food\nthere. We didn't work there. We didn't have where to...to stay. After the 5th or 6th day,\nthey said now they're gonna take us to a barrack. So they...they made a tent. You know\nwhat's a tent. They made a...just put in a tent in the floor there...with the snow...with the\nwater, with the...whatever. So was no beds, nothing there. The people was sitting on the\nfloor. There were there about 500 people maybe. And when it came to me, with my\ncousin and I always want to...was with my cousin, so it's no more room to go in. So we\nwere so happy. So we said, \"Oh, the people have already...\" We didn't know how it's\ninside. We were better off outside than they inside. So they said you have to wait until\nyou gonna have room. So we went back and we were another few days outside. And then\nwe came. They have already room. So it was another tent, but there was a Ukrainian. He\nfixes, you know, he was working there. And they had little carts. They were so...the carts\nwas like this. There was two people there. You know, one was on this side, and one was\non this side. So when I came there with the...with the people...so he said, \"Whatever you\nwanna take, you take.\" So I went the first...I was up...I went in to \u2019Ukraine*. They wanted\nto kill me, but I didn't care. I was up. My cousin was there. We had a\u201d *. We had a piece\nof bread, so we give it to the thing and we said, \"You go with your friend, and we took\nher and another two Jewish people.\" We shouldn't be in with them. They was so rough to\nus.",
        "Q: We need to break now. They're going to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: We're rolling. We're in Ravensbruck.",
        "A: Oh, ya. We're in Ravensbruck now. So I was there in, you know, with the people. We\ngave him the bread and we changed over. You know, we should be for Jewish people and\nthe Ukraines they should be together. But food they didn't give us. They didn't have.\nToilets we didn't have. And we were five like sisters. Five girls, my cousin and another\nthree girls. So one girl went out every time when the...the people came with the food. She\ntook a...we had a...a pot and she went and she took out food and she ran away. But one\ntime they hit her. She was dead. She's dead. I mean not...deaf. They hit her so much. We\nhad this pot. I am gonna tell you. You excuse me. We made in there when we didn't have\na toilet, and then we ate from that. We didn't have where to wash it. We didn't have where\nto wash even our face. And that I...I wanted to tell you in Auschwitz every day we\ntake...we took a shower...not a shower. It was winter. It was very cold. So my cousin she\nsaid, \"Toby, we have to go wash. When we not gonna wash, you gonna die.\" So I said,\n\"It's so cold. I'm not gonna go.\" \"Please,\" she slapped me like something, \"You have to\ncome.\" We went out. It was 450 toilets. One time...one in the morning, they let us go. It\nwas here a man, here a woman, here a man, you know. Workers. The wasn't man at all.\nBut the workman came in. So we sat 450 people at one time. And there was water the\nsame thing, in a different...uh...uh...side was the water. Also about 450. So we went to\nwash. I opened the water. I took the water in my hands and til I brought it to my face I\nhad ice cycles already it was so cold. But after, you know, we washed, it was...I'm high. It\nwas so refreshing. I said, \"Why do I have to do this everyday.\" I didn't want to do it. You\nknow, it...it was so cold. But here our arms break. We had a different...she had a different\nidea. We had also in a tent. The tent was...and we was on top. And the top was snow in\nthe tent, but there was so many people inside...more than thousand people just in the\nair...1t was sweating the tent, and we took that water and we washed ourselves. We\nwashed our faces. We washed our legs. Aw, we took a bath. I'm higher, you know. We\nwere there 4 weeks. But the first 4 weeks I think was Ravensbruck. And after that came\ntrucks and they said they gonna...they took us to work. They took us it called and it could\ncall. There we came 500 people from our survivors. I mean the concentration camp.\nAnd...uh...there was an air base. I don't know there was a place we came in there in the\nrooms. The pilots left. It...1t was beautiful clean, white beds, with...we didn't see this in a\nlong time, and it was tables and it was frena. I remember today the frena, you know,\nin...in plates. They were in such a rush they should go away they didn't have...give this\nfor the...for the pilots, but they didn't have time to eat it, so they left it. And we came in.\nThis I will never forget in my life. Then time from that food it..it...1t...you couldn't\ndescribe it. So we had there a few days, and then it came out a lady was...she was in\nAuschwitz. And she recognized my cousin, and she told me you take seven girls, six girls\nwith you and we're gonna open here a you know. So she took me...I mean another five\ngirls, we were like sisters. But the other girls...they took us we should be...we worked for\nthe soldiers. We fixed already not for the haftling, but for the soldiers we worked there.\nThey didn't want we should have lice or something. There was lice. There was people.\nYou just...1t was so much just took it like this. You know I couldn't believe it. I never saw\nit in my life such a thing. They were very sick people there.

You know, from my town, from Mittelwischo. So they saw me, they said, \"A\nhusband comes home. The wife is not here. Now the wife comes, the husband 1s not\nhere.\" They knew already. I didn't know my husband doesn't live. But they knew. So\nanother husband came home. His wife...I tell you I...I'm the only survivor. A married lady\nand I am alive in that town. All of them were killed. And...uh...I didn't understand then.\n[...L...It didn't go to my head. I heard that but I didn't want to believe. I didn't want to\nthink of it. So I went home first to my...to my home where I used to live in Mittelwischo.\nI found there a few cousins and this pictures what I have now here I hide that pictures\nbefore I went to Auschwitz. And I forgot to tell you where I give my story. I give a lot of\nstory there. They wanted to take my child. They begged me, \"Please leave the baby with\nus.\" So I thought to myself, \"He's going to eat trace. How can I leave my baby to eat\ntrace. When I leave him there, I would have him. But I didn't want. (Crying) So the\npictures I have...I have other few things, and then I went to look for my husband. And I'm\nin the...I was in the...in a carriage...a horse and carriage.

Oh, I made something like a...1t wasn't real gold. It was\nsomething just...you know, like a band. So my friend said, \"Why you need it. Why you\nwear that band?\" I said, \"What do you mean why do I wear the band?\" And more I didn't\nwant to ask, and she didn't say nothing. So I went to look for my husband. I went to my\nmother-in-law. I found her. I found all his sister and brothers. They were in...in Transista.\nThey suffered a lot, but they didn't kill the people there. They just...they perished there,\nbut they didn't have food because of the cold weather. There was a brother of mine also,\nyou know, and he survived in a Transista. I was there about 3 weeks by my mother-in-\nlaw and every day when I heard a knock on the door, I said, \"Oh, Gadalia is coming.\" I\ndon't know my mother knew it or not. I never asked her, you know, what happened, you\nknow. Then I went to my brothers. I was there a few weeks, and this brothers...the\nyounger brother...the older brother, they thought I was dead. When my friend came home\nand they asked, \"Maybe did you see Toby?\" They said, \"Sure, that's where I. And they...I\nwasn't even with her. And she told both my brothers I am alive. She saw when they killed\nme. So they thought I'm dead. But when I came home from New Bromberg, I went in\nsecret, you know, where the... 1s there. There I knew my sister-in-law. I went to their\nhouse, and my brother was there. When he saw me he almost fainted. He thought I am a\nghost. He knew I am dead for...for 6 months. I mean 6 months already he's home. He\ndidn't hear anything. People came home and I didn't came home so he said I was married.\nI had...uh...uh....you know, I'm not here. He was white like a sheet. He said, \"Toby,\nI...and he he couldn't talk.\" So we went in there and we talked and then I went to my\nbrother there. And when he saw me, he also almost fainted. He took me in his hands and\nhis \u201d \u00a2. I wasn't that big. Like a baby he hold me and kissed me. (Crying) I was there until\nI came...my brother came. He went to look for my cousin. He was a chaplain in the army.\nI have also here a picture from him. So he remembered me from when I was a little girl.\nHe liked me. You know, they're first cousins. And he said to my brother, Please go and\nbring me Toby. I wanna see Toby.\" So he came to the Bokivina. He took me home and\nwe wanted to go. He was in Czechoslovakia in Prockatisa. New Procka was a little\nvillage Prockatisa. And he said, \"I want to see her. Please bring her.\" So he went home.\nHe was at the Shushan with my cousin and then he came home to bring me. So I came. I\ndidn't have any shoes. There was a little coat. You know the Shushan time it was cold. I\ndidn't have a coat. I didn't have dresses. I didn't have nothing. There was a boy. When I\nwent on the train, he took off his shoes. Big shoes. I remember it was with laces like, you\nknow, with...and he said, \"Toby, you take the shoes.\" I said, \"I'm not gonna take your\nshoes. You don't have...\"\" He went home without shoes. He said, \"You take the shoes.\"\nAnd that...you know, he didn't want to hear for nothing. So we went to the train we\nshould go to Prockitisa. It wasn't room. There we went without money. It doesn't cost\nanything. You know, it was free. So we didn't have room on the train. So we were in\ntop...on the top for 3 weeks. You could go in | day. The train I couldn't believe it. And it\nwas cold. I was crying. I thought I'm gonna die. I said, \"Booda, I couldn't make it any\nmore.\" He said, Please...then I knew it already my husband doesn't live. Somebody\ntold...told my brother and my brothers wanted they should tell me. I should know. So I\ndidn't have to wait already for him, so I went with my brother. So after the 3 weeks...we\ndidn't eat, and I was cold. You wouldn't believe it. So we came to that lady where my\ncousin he was there. He knew where my cousin stayed. He came in the house and she\nknew my brother. Me she didn't know. So he said I am his sister. We came to see Jack.\nSo she said, \"Jack just...they...they...he went to Germany.\" You know they located him\nfrom Czechoslovakia to Germany. I...I started to cry. I didn't know what to do.

Then it come other...a fifth place came other\nsoldiers. And my brother was sleeping there and I was sleeping in the same room with the\nsoldiers, but she made me with a sheet like, you know, separate....I should have my\nprivacy. And there was...uh...American soldiers. We didn't know a word of English. They\nwanted to talk to us. They gave us chocolate. They gave us cigarettes. We\ndon't...uh...smoke. I took a dictionary. I want to...you know, we should be able to...to\ncommunicate, but we couldn't. So 3-4 days we..., you know, we walk in there. And we\ncame back. We went to. We didn't have anything. We didn't have money, didn't know\nwhat we're gonna do. We came back. She said, \"Jack came.\" He came to pick up some\nmail. You know, well...and when he saw me, he...he was very happy to see me. He was\ncrying and he asked me out from the family and he lost a lot. And we sit a few hours. We\ntalk and he picks up himself and he said, \"Now I'm gonna go.\" I said, \"Jack, forget it.\nYou're not gonna go. You're not gonna leave me here.\" (Crying) I don't have money. I\ndon't have anything. You brought me here. You take me where you go. I said I have to go\nthree borders. I couldn't take it. You're a civil. He's in the army. So there was another\nofficer with him, a very good friend. He was a Gentile. And he told him, \"I don't know\nwhat to do with my cousin.\" He said, \"It's no problem. Put her on a hat. Give her a coat.\nHe's a man. Give him a suit like in the army, and when we passes the borders and they\ngonna sleep by the borders and we have the passes whatever think you know us as not\nsoldiers. So we went to work. It was very good. And we had to go fix the car. So we\nwent in there. It was one thing we didn't have to go off from the car. We didn't have to\nbe...some soldiers came out to fix it, and then same soldiers came to us and we said,\n\"Lou, We have girls here. We drink here. We dance here. Come on. What're you gonna\nsleep here. I am sleeping. My brother is sleeping. You know, we're tired. We didn't\nwanna go, you know, with... So Thank God, we fixed the car. We passed the border, and\nwe are in Germany. He said, my cousin, \"Now you can go and dance, Toby. You can do\nwhatever you want. You're free.\" So we came to Germany. It was about 2 o'clock in the\nnight. He had there about 5 girls he knew. Jewish girls. He knocked on the window and I\nhave for you. Open the door. We came in. We were there a few days with them in the\nhouse and then we was there a few...I was there a long...about 2 years maybe. Yes, until I\nwas married. 1945 until 1947 I was in Tishinroit. So we got a hotel. They gave us 2\nrooms. My brother was a Rabbi there. I had my room and the...the owner gave us food\nbut it wasn't kosher you know. A few days we ate there and then, you know, we couldn't\neat it. So I made my kitchen in my house by ourselves, you know, kosher food. And\nwhoever passes...I had people from all over who didn't want to eat tras they came to. I\nmean I was cooking. Was no problem. So then I found another brother. He was in...he\nalso survived, but he lost a woman...a lady, a sister-in-law with five children. He was in\nBergen-Belsen, and then we went to Bergen-Belsen. And then he came. He lived also in\nTishinroit. Then he was a Rabbi. He went to Shrundas. It was not far maybe here from\nRavensbruck, Munich, and it wasn't far from there. So I said, \"I will never get married.\"\nWell, I...I was...I don't know I was jealous...I hated men and children. I really couldn't\nlook at them. I was...I was...Now I want to say...then I didn't. I was...I was very hurting\nand I was jealous you know. And...uh...I said I will never get married. Well, a husband\nlike I had I couldn't have and a child I don't have, but my sister-in-law, you know, the he\ndrives the she got a first child. And she broke her bone, by the pelvis and she had to stay\n8 months in bed. She shouldn't move even. The doctor explained when you break a foot,\na hand, you put it in a cast, but you couldn't put...uh...so she had to lay for 8 months. So I\nhad the baby...she had a so when this child start in the morning to talk, she was a\nbeautiful girl. I...I thought I'm gonna die. I wanted a child. You know, until then I didn't.\nBy then I wanted so much I thought I am gonna die. I want a child. I couldn't have a\nchild. I'm not married. So the brothers said for 2 years I should get married. I had a lot of\nboys...proposed...want me, but I said no. But then I...not this child I don't think it would\ngo so. So then my...my brother went to a...to a convention and he saw my husband. This\nwas. And, of course, I all ready and they said, you know so. Then I decided I want a child\nand I got married. And thank God we married for 43 years. I have a wonderful husband. I\nhad five children. Etty 1s the oldest. Then I had another girl. This I had in Germany. Then\nI came to America in 1950. We had plenty before we came to America. We couldn't came\nhere so fast. So they tell me, you know, I had brothers here. I'm gonna be the first in\nAmerica. But it take 5 years from 1945 until 1950. So in Germany we saw we\ncouldn't...we couldn't come. So we went to Paris. We were there 18 months and then my\nhusband didn't make a living. And my brothers here didn't have...I don't know. I wrote\nthem a letter we don't have anything. I was pregnant and we couldn't survive. He didn't\nwork. You know, strangers couldn't work in Paris.

I couldn't afford to be in some so they said, You have to move. People work and\nthey...the baby's gonna cry and you couldn't be here.\" So the baby...nobody...she was\nsuch a baby...she never cry. In the morning I used to come out in the corridor, you know,\nin the...so they saw a baby...said, \"What you do with the baby? She never cries.\"\nUh... You know, I used to nurse her. Whenever she was crying I and she was alright. And\nwe were there a few months and my husband we didn't have from what to live.

It's still tears. (Crying) And since then I\nwas different. I'm not the same person. I lost a lot of my life (Crying). And then I have\nanother son. He should be well. I went to the country. He was fine. He was everything. I\nwent away. Eight days later, they called me up. \"Yonki doesn't feel good.\" So I said,\n\"What happened.\" He never was sick. He was always a healthy child. He 1s married.\nAbout 19 years got married. Has four children and has a beautiful wife...a wonderful.\nShe's lovely. She's 30. They try. You know she's very good to him and she called me up.

He's\ncoughing. \"What's the matter. Go to a doctor.\" He never went to a doctor. She's a\nnurse...my daughter-in-law. Whenever he had a cough or something, she gave him\nsomething. That's it. But now he went to a doctor and they find out he has leukemia in\nthe..in the bones. I was in...1n bed and my daughter calls me up, \"Something is wrong\nwith the blood.\" I said, \"What's the matter?\" \"Yonk1's sick.\" So I...we went...came back\nfrom the country.

They took blood test and one son, Thank God, he wasn't\nmarried. He was exactly the same match. And Thank God he went to Seattle. He went\nthrough a lot. He was 8 months there.

        "A: Okay. So when he saw me, he almost fainted. He thought I'm dead. He said, \"Toby, I\nheard the people killed you.\" So I said, it was \"Auntie Toby.\" So he...he was happy he\nhave me. So he took me by my hands. He left everybody, his mother, his sister, brothers\nHe had eight sisters and brothers, and he took me to a...to a Gentile house, we should hide\nwhere we was still...was afraid. It was 5 in the morning, and we went, just me and him.\nWe didn't talk. We was afraid somebody shouldn't hear it. We walked like on the air\nsomebody shouldn't hear the walking. So we came to the house where he made business\nwith that guy, my husband and he asked him, \"Please, let he hide in your house.\" He said,\nGadalia, I couldn't do it. I'm afraid.\" Everybody knew when you hide a Jew, so you have\nto give your life. He said, \"I'm a father. I have children. I couldn't do that.\" So he begged\nhim. He said, \"Look, you know with whom you talk.\" So he said, \"Okay.\" They put us in\nthe cellars, and they covered us up, you know, with boxes and things people shouldn't...in\ncase somebody comes, they shouldn't see we are there. But I don't know somehow one\nperson saw us and they told us he hided two Jews. So two soldiers came. First, the man\ncame. and he said, \"Gadalia, I am sorry. They want to kill me. I have to give you out.\"\nAnd he said, \"Try. Tell him you...you know we are not here.\" He said, \"I couldn't.\nPlease.\" So we came out, and the soldiers saw us. They took us out, and they just said,\n\"You're Jews. You're not going to live anymore.\" So they told us we should pick up our\nhands and they had the bayonets just to kill us. So my husband had a few remain, you\nknow, money, and he had a lot of bills. He didn't have too much money then. They took\nus away from us. So he put the money on the...you know, on the end, and the bills in the\nmiddle and he give them a bunch. They thought they have a lot of money. So they said,\n\"Run away, and go hide of another place. I let you go.\" So we quickly ran away, and then\nwe came again to the house. Food we didn't have. There was a carton eggs. So my\nmother-in-law put the eggs in a oven...not even we didn't have a...a....nothing to cook\nin it, and she baked the eggs and we ate...everybody had something. You know, for 2\nweeks, we didn't have anything. So we were there a few days, and we didn't have what to\ndo. Money we didn't have. The store they took away from us. The houses they took away\nfrom us. We went to . It was a little....uh...a town. So my husband went in the morning\nto...shul in and the \u201d ...uh...",
        "A: The mayor saw him. He was his best friend. He told him, \"Mr. \u201d You...now you have a\nchance. Go to the primary and tell them whatever they took from you and you gonna get\nem back.\" So who knew...you know he went and he captured them. The...so they took\nabout 50 people like this and they kept them a few days. I went to them once or twice.\nThey let me I should see him. And then they said they're gonna kill him. They not going\nto leave him free. They took him away in a truck and they put him in a concentration\ncamp. Thank God, they didn't kill him then He wrote he some...uh...letters, you know,\nand I wrote him back. But he could never have my letters. They just tease but I wrote\nhim. He didn't...he was afraid. Maybe something is in the letters. You know, they\nhad....they never give him the letters to him. So he was 6 months in capture. So I went\nwith my mother-in-law. She...you know, she liked me very much. I loved her just like a\nmother. She was very good to me. And my brother-in-laws, my sister*in-laws. Today,\neven I married 40...43 years it's gonna be I'm married now, and they still...I'm her sister-\nin-law. And I...I came home. I was pregnant. I didn't know. So my brother...there's a in\nthe army. He was in the army, my youngster brother, and he took me to my mother's\nhome in Romania. This was in the Bookerwene, and I was living at my mother's. Well,\nmy husband wasn't there. My mother-in-law she used to go...we didn't have any\nmoney...she used to go everyday in the market. She used to bring me...she had her own\nchildren. She never give anything for the children. I...I didn't feel good. I didn't know I\nwas pregnant then. She didn't know. But I was laying, and she said, \"Toby has to\nhave...she's such a young kin. Gadalia is not here. So she has to take care of me.\" So it\nwas too hard for her. So my brother came in and took me from there and he bring me to\nmy mother's. So I came here. Everybody was...you know, they thought he's killed. The\npeople knew, you know, everybody who took away, they killed them. So my friends\ncame, \"Poor Toby, she's such a young child. She's pregnant. She doesn't have a husband\nnow.\" But 6 months after...and one day he came home. And I don't have to tell you....you\nknow, was...when we see each other. So when he came home it was Hungarian. It was\n1940. The Hungarian came in. We were Romanian. In\n1940, Hungarian took over Romania. And it wasn't such a pleasant thing. It was very\nrough. They start demonstrate, start the...you know...And he came home and he wasn't\nregistered. It was about 3 or 4 months after the Hungarian was already there. And they\nsaid then the people wasn't right away when the Hungarian came, they are...you know,\ndoesn't belong to the...to the Hungarian, they have to go back from where they come. But\nI wanted...I didn't know where to go. My home was tooken. My store was taken away, so\nwe stayed by...by my mother. So but he wasn't registered. So we didn't know what to do.\nWe tried. My brother went to whatever place and we paid money and they registered him\nand he was when the Hungarian came in. So was...we were very happy. And he was...he\nwas...he never went out. He was afraid. He didn't know, you know.. he's allowed to go\nout. So he was like a capture by me in the house. He was very religious. He went\neveryday to the synagogue. It was in the winter. He took a...he used to hock, you know.\nIt was frozen...the water. The windows were broken already, so he took and he opened\nthe ice, and he went into the waters. And he was there until 1942. I had my baby. Was\nvery happy. I was...My baby was born 1940, March 28. It was. It was a very happy day.\nHe was in the house. I had the baby in the house. Then, you know, there they...we didn't\nhave hospitals like it's here. So I had my baby, and we were very happy. Later, the baby\nwas very sick. We didn't have money from...you know, we went to doctors, but they\ndidn't know what it was. So I had to go to city...to a big city, and I was there a few days. I\nwent to one doctor, to a second doctor, and they said, \"What did you do with your baby?\nYou didn't give him to eat.\" He was eating right away. He went..I...you know, he didn't\ncatch anything. So I was by my family. And the mother....this is my sister-in-law today,\nmy youngest brother's wife. Her mother...she was a very nice lady. So she said, \"Toby,\nyou couldn't lose nothing. Just try and take...1t was a very old doctor. And she said, \"Call\nthis doctor. If this doctor's not going to help you, nobody would.\" So the children all was\nlaughing, \"Ma, he's such an old man. Why do you want...\" So she said, \"Just call him.\"\nHe came to us. We saw the baby. He couldn't believe it. He was skin and bones. So he\ngave him a medicine. The first thing I gave him the medicine he...the baby was fine. We\ncame home. You know, he survived. He was a beautiful baby. And we were struggling.\nYou know, my husband couldn't go out. He couldn't make money. He was afraid. And\nthen was...in 1940 was he born. And then again pregnant again. 1942...my...they called\nhim to ...uh...labor...to work. And then we knew it already, it was start...1t was a very bad\nthing we registered him. When we don't register him, they don't know from him, and he\nwould be alive even today. But we didn't know, and we made this. You know, they called\nhim in. And I was pregnant and he went away. So I packed him some stuff. And he forgot\nsome gloves. And it was a very cold...1t was in December and I ran after him I should\ngive him the gloves. I catched a cold, and I was very sick then and I lost the baby in the\n8th month. I was very upset. I used to cry. My husband went away. He knew, you know,\nwe have a baby. When he comes back I am gonna have another. And then he gonna come\nin in the house and he say, \"Toby, where is the other baby?\" What I'm gonna tell him? I\nwas...I was crying, but I didn't know he will never come back again. (Crying) Then in...in\nFebruary I heard after...after the liberation he was killed with 35,000 people. But I didn't\nknow. A lot of people get letters. You know, they was missing. a lot of people get letters,\nyou know, he's there. But I didn't get anything, but I never believed he's not alive. So I\nwaited every day I should get something. But 1t never came. And then it...we came\nalready to 1944. It was holidays. It was...and then in April...it was on a Friday, we cooked\na Saturday you know, the meal...everybody. And my child was very sick. He had fevers.\nHe had very high fever. And soldiers came in the house and they said, \"10 minutes I give\nyou. Pack everything. You have to go to the synagogue.\" So I begged the soldiers that\nlook, my child is so sick. Please leave me here. We knew already they're going to take us\nto the ghetto. So he took...he hit me, and he called me some names. He said you couldn't\nstay here. You have to go. He doesn't care the baby is sick. So I didn't have nothing what\nto do, so I took some stuff and we packed everything in the synagogue. The meal was on\nthe stove. We went away. Over Saturday, we was there in the shul and Sunday they....or\nSaturday, they took us with a...we didn't have cars...horse and carriages. And every\nfamily, they packed, and they took us to the ghetto. So we came in in the ghetto. It was in\na room maybe 30, 50, 20 people, but Thank God, we had the family. We had my\ngrandmother, my aunt, my children. We weren't with strangers. But we didn't...we sat in\nthe floor. Food we didn't have. We couldn't take any food. And I had, you know, then my\nchild and my aunt had nine children. My grandmother was old already, and we had to sit\non the floor, to sleep on the floor. It was about 4 weeks like that. I went out everyday to\nold people. I washed them. I cut them the nails. I cut them the hair. I cleaned them up.\nAnd, you know, they begged me...please, we couldn't go out. We didn't have what to do,\nso I went every single day. And I did it. When I was a young girl...I forget to tell you...in\nhome every week, it wasn't too many rich people by us, so I went every week to\ntake...like to beg for other people, not for me...where we had for ourselves enough. But\nwe was on the first categories, like we weren't so poor. So everybody came and said,\n\"Toby, you could go to take...they're not going to take it, take it for yourself, but other\npeople, they need it and the children are...you know, they are embarrassed to go to beg.\nSo I went every single week, you know, in the house. They didn't have no money. They\ngive a little potatoes, a little beans, a little flour, you know, until some...one house to\nhouses, we made something and we...they gave this to the poor, you know, that they\nshould have for the...and there was a lot of sick people. Every night there was a young\nchildren, I used to go to be I used to be compression.",
        "A: Compress, you know, for sick, typhus people. I didn't care I'm gonna get sick or not. I\nnever slept in my house. There was a lot of old people. Everybody came. My mother was\na wonderful woman. They said, \"Give me Toby for the night.\" They were afraid to sleep\nby theirself. Every single night...I don't know, my mother, she let me go from one house\nto...whoever wanted, she...she wanted to please the people and I went. It wasn't such a\nclean houses, but I...I still went and I didn't complain. I did a lot for people. I wanted to\nhelp, and I did it and I very happy I could do it. And I'm gonna go back from the\nAuschwitz, you know, from the...from the ghetto. So my child was then 3 and a half years\nold. He used to play with my brother the the chess. A...a chess...you know, he was so\nsmart, he was...you couldn't believe it. And my brother was there. Then we had friends.\nThey came. One friend I had, he asked me, \"Toby, what did you do with your jewelry?\" I\nhad a lot of jewelry. So I said, \"Before we came to the ghetto, I hide this. I make a\npackage. I had my mother's jewelry and my jewelry and I...I put away...not I knew where\nit is, that nobody can find it. So he said, \"Toby, you have a child. Go back. I go with you.\nTake your jewelry. For a ring, for a earring, you could buy a bread. You could buy milk.\nYou...you'll be able to survive.\" So we went out from the ghetto. When they catch us,\nthey would...uh...shoot us. But we went away four people. I took my jewelry, and I was\nvery happy I brought it to the ghetto. Then we hear the people, before they go to the\ntrains, they take away everything. So I said, \"What I'm gonna give them the gold, my\njewelry?\" So there was a girl. She was a friend with my brother. She was very rich. Her\nfather has a big store. And this house near them was in the ghetto. So the girl told my\nbrother, \"You have...I know you have the jewelry.\" He told her, you know, I have my\njewelry here. She said, \"GlIve it to me.\" They have a hiding place in the basement and she\nhides her things and she's gonna hide our things and when we come back, we gonna have\nit. So she begged my brother. He said, \"Booda, please come see where I put it. Nobody\nknows whose gonna come back. So my brother thought, you know, maybe nobody's\ngonna take it, they're gonna think he took it. So he didn't want to go. So I met her in\nAuschwitz, that girl, and I begged her. I said, \"Please, tell me where did you put the\njewelry.\" She said, \"I'm not gonna tell you.\" And she never survived. We came back, me\nand my brother. We went through the whole cellar. We couldn't find it. And we didn't\nhave it. So when I came home...so then in one day...and 4 weeks after they took us to the\ntrains. So they packed us, about 120 people, old people, young people, no water. They\ngave us a little water. We went about 4. 3 days...3, 4 days...5 days, I don't remember. I\nhad my child. Old, old people. We didn't have a toilet. It was in the cattle cars. People\nwere dying. People were screaming. It was smelling. You could die. You know, it was\nterrible. We begged a little waters from the SS. Nobody was hearing us. Nothing. So we\ncame to Auschwitz. We came down from this...we were so happy they opened the...the\ncars. We came down. They start to hit us. Go there, Go there, Go there, Go there.\nEverybody wanted to be with their families we should lose each each. We should be\ntogether. So I.... had my child. I was young. I was really beautiful. And a man then went\nthis side to me. He said, \"Give away the child for a older lady.\" So I asked him why. I\ntold my brother, \"Booda, Go and ask why should I give away the baby.\" He...he start to\nlook. He disappeared. You thought he went into the earth. You didn't see him. Then a\nsecond...uh...guy came. And he said, \"Give away the baby.\" And it was almost by\nMengele. It wasn't too far there. My...I used to live with my mother, so I give the baby to\nmy...to my mother. And I hear right now (crying) how he cried, \"Mommy, I want to go\nwith you. I want to stay with Mommy.\" So I was by Mengele, and he told he I should go\nthis side. My mother with my child the other side. When I heard him, and I hear him\ntoday. I hear him every single day, \"Mommy, I want to go with you. I don't want to stay\nwith Bobby.\" (Crying) I wanted to ran after them. They disappeared. I never saw them.\n(Crying) Then they came with the people, with the young people. I had there cousins. I\nwas crying. I wanted to go with my child. So they said, \"Why're you crying. Some day,\nyou're gonna be with him.\" They told us we gonna to work, and all the people with\nchildren and they go...you know, they're going to mind the children, and we're gonna\ncome every Sunday to see them. (Crying) But that Sunday never came. And, you know,\nthat...then we went to...to the C lagers. I was there 3 months. And we waited to see the\nchildren. We waited to see the children. They gave us the food. They gave us a little piece\nof bread. I didn't want to eat it. I said, \"With this little bread, I am not going to be\nsatisfied.\" So every single day I put my bread and I kept it. In the night the people took it\naway from me. I had there a cousin, and I tell she wouldn't survive. And she saw I am not\ngoing to eat. I used to cry, and she said, \"You know, Toby, I would like we should be\ntogether. You get the bread. You eat it. I get mine. We gonna...we're gonna share. She\nsaw that I am gonna die. So every...so...first of all I didn't want to. Then I said, \"Okay.\"\nThen every day, the SS came and they asked, \"Who is sick? Who is pregnant? They\nshould...uh...present to them. They gonna take us revere. They're gonna give us better\nfood. You know, so I wanted to go. I said, \"I'm gonna say I'm pregnant.\" I wasn't, but I\nwanted to go to see my baby. I didn't know how I could go out from the C lager. So my\nbrother, \"Toby, you're not gonna go. You're not gonna leave me. I don't know who lives.\nI want you with me.\" So I wanted another day. But Iam gonna go to see my child. And I\nwas 3 months in C lager. The next lager was B. There was a family camp with the\nCzech...Czechoslovakia people...families, husbands, wife and children. So they said,\n\"You see, our children live. You have here next lagers, you know, families, so all the\npeople with the children are in a different lager, so we're gonna see them. Three months\nafter we were there and one night we hear screams and was crying and they never let us\nout from the...from the...when it was a transport came in. We were outside. They told us\nto go in...1in the barracks. When the people came...when they selected the people to go to\nthe crematorium, they didn't want we should see. We saw the fires. You know, we saw\nthe flames until the sky. We smelled the...the...the meat...what they burned in the\ncrematoriums. We weren't too far from there. So we didn't know what it was. So they\nsaid, the people die...old people die. You know, we don't...we don't want to make graves.\nWe burned the people but...uh...people, you know, alive..children, they're not gonna do\nthat. So one day I...I met a friend. I was too...I was very...I was crying. I wanted my baby.\nI was missing him very much. I wanted my mother. So she said, \"Toby, I heard...\" You\nknow, she had seven children. \"Don't cry. They give them white bread. They gave them\nmilk. They gave them chicken soup. They give them chicken. They are wonderful the\nchildren.\" So she had seven children there. She's...so I said, \"Maybe, you know.\" We\nwanted they should live. We didn't think they don't live anymore. For 6 months we didn't\nknow what to think. We saw. We heard. We knew everything, but we didn't believe it.\nWe didn't want to take it in our heads. You know, people for what? What did they do the\nchildren? What do the older people? Why they should kill people they didn't do any...any\nharm? So after the 3 months when I was in the...the C lager. So the next day when they\ntook out the Czech...the Czech people, the families. They took them to the crematorium.\nNobody...one was alive. So they took us to the baths in the crematorium. They selected us\nyou know, and we went there to work. And 2 or 3 months we didn't do a thing. We\nwent...when we went to the crematorium, so we said...we looked in the back and said,\n\"What...what you think we're gonna come back that way? Or we gonna stay there?\"\nWhen we came in in the back, the first time when we came, the first time when we came\nto the crematorium...so when we went in there to the...to the baths what they said we have\nto be clean. We shouldn't make very...the lagers and then we saw the band there. It was\nplaying Albeit Macht Frei. It was beautiful. It was clean you know. So we went in there.\nIt was soldiers. So they told...they told us we should take off our clothes. So how could\nyou take off clothes when men are there? So we went...you know, we...we didn't want to\ndo it. So they start to hit us. And we didn't have any choice, and we did it. So the first\ntime when I went in the crematorium I didn't see and I didn't know what's going on, but\nwhen we came back I saw already they had them...the knobs. One was for gas. One was\nfor water. It was the same room. (Crying) Excuse me It was the same room, you know,\nwhere they kill the people, and we were in there 2 days. So for us they gave the water.\nAnd we came back. We came to the same lager and then they selected us to go to work.\nA lot of people went to, you know to the dresses...not to dresses...to all things we were\nfixing there. People went commando. People went trade...to make grey...you know,\nlike...uh...to hide people, you know, bunkers...built, you know, and it was cold in the\nwinter. We didn't...we didn't have any clothes and we didn't have shoes. They gave us\nshoes like from...uh...wood. You couldn't bend the feet. It was just a hole and you\njust...and you know when you put in the feet, the skin went up in them. The blood was\nrunning, but who cared. A lot of people they didn't...we didn't think we gonna survive. I\nwanted to survive. I wanted to see my baby. I wanted to see my husband. And I tried.\nOne day it was. We had friends, you know. We was religious. Not all of us, but a few\ngirls was fasting. We didn't eat on that day. But one girl found a...a handkerchief, and she\nwashed this. And she...she went, you know, there was the electric...uh...",
        "A: The fence there. After this was like this, another fence, you know, just a wire. You're not\nallowed to go the other side. So this wire she put on the top, you know, the handkerchief,\nit should dry. And I don't know what happened. A wind came and the handkerchief flew\noff. She went to pick up the handkerchief and she was black like she was electrics...",
        "A: Electrocuted. In...in the spot there. A lot...a lot of times I wanted to do that. I said what I\nhave to, you know, but I thought maybe...I...I didn't want nobody should have my\nhusband. I said I am not going to give nobody, you know, he should take away my\nhusband. I want to survive and I didn't do it. So we went every 4 weeks when we were in\nthe, you know, by work to take baths. And...and you know they put us in. We didn't have\nclothes enough. And Hungarians, the last day they didn't have material enough. So they\nmade papers and I don't know with paper...with some things, they made materials. And\nthey put the materials in the machines to the dis...disinfect them. You know, they\nshouldn't be lice or something, and the clothes didn't come out. So a lot of people had\nclothes. And they came to me. I didn't have...I came home naked like my mother had me\nwhen I was born. I was 2 weeks without. I went out in a blanket. I took a blanket, you\nknow. From where I got a dress after, I don't remember, but I got one. Maybe it was in\nthe. I don't know who gave me and I had. Then people didn't have what to wear. They\ncame also who doesn't have dresses, we're gonna give you new dresses. They took them\nout, and they never came back. They took them to the crematorium, but they didn't have\nroom for them. Every 4 weeks they make selections. Mengele came in, and we had to\nstrip all our clothes. We were naked. We had to pick up one hand and...uh...to...went\nthrough..uh...Mengele to see. When you had anything on your body, a little pimple, you\nwent in the left side and a lot of people went to the ride side. But they separated sisters.\nThey separated cousins, a mother from a child. It was terrible when they separated the\npeople. One would...you know, one was running to the mother. One was running to the\nsister. There was a lots of confusion there, but they didn't want, you know. Even they\nknew they go...they didn't know they go to the crematorium. They thought gonna take us\nto another place. And when they took away the people, they never came back. One day\nwas there in Auschwitz. It was in a winter day. So one person was missing. So every half\nhour we went to c'est l'appell. Usually we made twice a day c'est l'appell, the morning\nand in the evening. And one day we saw SS. They came like they were crazy. A person\nwas missing. We were 32,000 peoples in one...uh...and see was 32 barracks, a thousand\npeople to barrack. You know, to a... And every half hour they took us for c'est I'appell.\nAnd they went like they were crazy. They came and who wasn't, you know...somebody\nwas moving or something and one day, they kneeled us. We had to go on the floors and\nthey put stones under our feet and we had to keep two big heavy stones and we didn't\nhave a move with a eye. When you moved, they killed you on the spot. They were...they\nwere crazy. It was about 3 days. And...and what happened a girl was sick or what. She\nfall asleep for 3 days and 3 nights. There was some benches outside. She was outside\nsleeping nobody would know. And this girl was missing. And that's why they made\nthis...this there. And one time the, you know, they count us again and everybody was\nthere. It was, you know...then they said, \"Who was missing? Who was missing?\" And\nthey found the girl. So they gave her a, you know a whole bread and a salami. We were\nso jealous you know. Why she get a bread and we get a little bit of bread. A whole salami\nthere. They told her, \"Eat how much you want.\" After she was finished to eat, they hang\nher. The called us all out to see how somebody runs away what happens to them. (Sigh)\nAnd it was 6 months after I...we were there in Auschwitz so the mother from the seven\nchildren...So we were there in the crematorium...there in the bath. So there was a man. He\nwas cleaning there. So he told me, \"Toby, I go ask the man. You know, mothers,\ngrandmothers to children came to take baths too.\" So I said, \"You're naked. How could\nyou go talk to a man.\" I was embarrassed to go. She said, \"I have to find out. I want to\nknow what's done with my children.\" So she went. I went to. I had a child. (Crying) So\nwe asked him, \"Tell me, when is older people come here with children to take baths.\" So\nthey start to laugh, the men. They said, \"You Hungarians! Dopes! You think Hitler is\ngonna give food for the children and after the war, you're gonna have big children.\n(Crying) The children not there the first day they came with your parent. So we was very\nupset. I said, \"No. It couldn't be. Not with 1944. It's not 1940. 1940 maybe they did it, but\nwe don't do it anymore. I said. \"Don't you see the fire. Don't you smell the...the smell.\nWhat you think is there. This is your children. This is your parents. (Crying) So then we\nknew already what happened to them. (Crying and drinking water). Then we were there\nuntil January 18. In Auschwitz. I was 9 months there. January 18th, we get up. We were,\nyou know..terrible how we slept....14 people in one bed. It was like...uh...the...three\nlayers...",
        "A: Three layers. But when I came I always was on top. I was afraid to be in the middle. I\nwas afraid to be well...the people...it wasn't too strong. It was from wood made. And one\nnight they...they used to break, and the people they was killed. They were...the hands\nbroken, feets broken, you know. So I always...when I came, the first I was up. I didn't\nwant to be in the bottom, they should kill me or hit me or what. (Sigh) So January 18,\nthey asked us we should go. We should take a blanket. They give us a whole bread, and a\ncan with meat. This came from America. And they said we gonna evacuate. So we start\nto walk. It was a lot of people. I mean the whole Auschwitz ran out there. The Russians\nthey came near. They didn't want they should capture us. So they took us further in away\nfrom them. So I always...I wasn't...uh...I couldn't say I was sick you know. I always was\nfrom the first to the fifth row. Cause when you walk you are in the back, you could never\nhold with the people. But in the front how much you walk the other people has to walk.\nSo I...l was between first and the fifth always, you know. We were walking in a few...we\nwere walking a few days but every...I don't know how many hours you walked, they gave\nus a little rest. We should sit. We should rest. So we rest a little, and then... And when\nthey say, you had to be up. If you are not, you were shot. They shot people like you\ncouldn't believe it. You know not everybody could get up. So we went a few days. We\ncame in the night...they gave...you know, we came to a place. It was a very, very big\nplace. It was in the winter, January. The snow was very high there. They don't clean snow\nlike in America. Snow was snow after a snow after a snow. So they said we're gonna rest.\nWe're gonna sleep. So they put us outside in the snow. We sat in the snow and we just\nsank. We sank. You know, the snow was soft and we didn't have the blankets. We threw\naway already. We couldn't carry it. But the bread we kept. The piece of meat we kept.\nYou know, we should have. But the blanket we didn't have. And we was outside sleeping.\nI mean we made a circle and we went so tight each other we should feel the warmth, you\nknow, we shouldn't... So we fall asleep. You're gonna be surprised. The SS went away\nand they left us the shepherds. Big shepherds. They was our, you know, our guards. And\nwhen you were moving, they killed you in the top...in the neck. You know, when\nsomebody was...wanted to go someplace...I mean, don't not to run away...you couldn't do\nit. The shepherds would kill you. So the more...I don't know how we slept, but we slept.\nAnd in the morning, you know, who waked up...here was a piece of ice, here was a piece\nof ice. More of half people, they didn't survive. The heart was... They couldn't...they\ncouldn't survive from the cold. So we walked about 5, 7 days and a lot of people was\nmissing. We didn't take off our shoes the whole time. When we take off the shoes, they\ntook it away from you. (Sigh) And then we thought we not gonna... We went to\nAusch...Ravensbruck. So they gave us a train. But a open train. It wasn't\nclosed...half...like a...you know the...for the...uh... It was open train. But the snow was\nfull. You know until the...so they go with a 120 girls in a...in a...uh...",
        "A: In a carriage. So we went in there and we threw out the snow we should have room. We\ncouldn't sit. We were standing like, you know, we couldn't move. 120 people. We went\nfor a few days. Eat....we didn't get too much. And they had soldiers. For every car, was 4\nsoldiers with the bayonets and nobody should run away. So we came to Auschwitz. But\nthere they didn't have room for us. There was...uh...uh...camp what people worked.",
        "A: Ravensbruck.",
        "A: So there was a lot of people. So we came and, you know, it was January and it was\nbeautiful, fresh snow. And you know...and we came in there in the camp and they said we\nshould sit out that until they gonna have room where we...they should put us. So we were\nso thirsty. It wasn't 10 minutes you didn't think it was winter. We...the snow and the earth\ntogether...we took it like sugar...the back piece of cake and it was cleaned up. No more\nsnow. Was summer. We were there about 5, 6 days outside. No food. Cause you didn't\nhave food. Cause we weren't counted, you know. We weren't in the count for the food\nthere. We didn't work there. We didn't have where to...to stay. After the 5th or 6th day,\nthey said now they're gonna take us to a barrack. So they...they made a tent. You know\nwhat's a tent. They made a...just put in a tent in the floor there...with the snow...with the\nwater, with the...whatever. So was no beds, nothing there. The people was sitting on the\nfloor. There were there about 500 people maybe. And when it came to me, with my\ncousin and I always want to...was with my cousin, so it's no more room to go in. So we\nwere so happy. So we said, \"Oh, the people have already...\" We didn't know how it's\ninside. We were better off outside than they inside. So they said you have to wait until\nyou gonna have room. So we went back and we were another few days outside. And then\nwe came. They have already room. So it was another tent, but there was a Ukrainian. He\nfixes, you know, he was working there. And they had little carts. They were so...the carts\nwas like this. There was two people there. You know, one was on this side, and one was\non this side. So when I came there with the...with the people...so he said, \"Whatever you\nwanna take, you take.\" So I went the first...I was up...I went in to \u2019Ukraine*. They wanted\nto kill me, but I didn't care. I was up. My cousin was there. We had a\u201d *. We had a piece\nof bread, so we give it to the thing and we said, \"You go with your friend, and we took\nher and another two Jewish people.\" We shouldn't be in with them. They was so rough to\nus.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Oh, ya. We're in Ravensbruck now. So I was there in, you know, with the people. We\ngave him the bread and we changed over. You know, we should be for Jewish people and\nthe Ukraines they should be together. But food they didn't give us. They didn't have.\nToilets we didn't have. And we were five like sisters. Five girls, my cousin and another\nthree girls. So one girl went out every time when the...the people came with the food. She\ntook a...we had a...a pot and she went and she took out food and she ran away. But one\ntime they hit her. She was dead. She's dead. I mean not...deaf. They hit her so much. We\nhad this pot. I am gonna tell you. You excuse me. We made in there when we didn't have\na toilet, and then we ate from that. We didn't have where to wash it. We didn't have where\nto wash even our face. And that I...I wanted to tell you in Auschwitz every day we\ntake...we took a shower...not a shower. It was winter. It was very cold. So my cousin she\nsaid, \"Toby, we have to go wash. When we not gonna wash, you gonna die.\" So I said,\n\"It's so cold. I'm not gonna go.\" \"Please,\" she slapped me like something, \"You have to\ncome.\" We went out. It was 450 toilets. One time...one in the morning, they let us go. It\nwas here a man, here a woman, here a man, you know. Workers. The wasn't man at all.\nBut the workman came in. So we sat 450 people at one time. And there was water the\nsame thing, in a different...uh...uh...side was the water. Also about 450. So we went to\nwash. I opened the water. I took the water in my hands and til I brought it to my face I\nhad ice cycles already it was so cold. But after, you know, we washed, it was...I'm high. It\nwas so refreshing. I said, \"Why do I have to do this everyday.\" I didn't want to do it. You\nknow, it...it was so cold. But here our arms break. We had a different...she had a different\nidea. We had also in a tent. The tent was...and we was on top. And the top was snow in\nthe tent, but there was so many people inside...more than thousand people just in the\nair...1t was sweating the tent, and we took that water and we washed ourselves. We\nwashed our faces. We washed our legs. Aw, we took a bath. I'm higher, you know. We\nwere there 4 weeks. But the first 4 weeks I think was Ravensbruck. And after that came\ntrucks and they said they gonna...they took us to work. They took us it called and it could\ncall. There we came 500 people from our survivors. I mean the concentration camp.\nAnd...uh...there was an air base. I don't know there was a place we came in there in the\nrooms. The pilots left. It...1t was beautiful clean, white beds, with...we didn't see this in a\nlong time, and it was tables and it was frena. I remember today the frena, you know,\nin...in plates. They were in such a rush they should go away they didn't have...give this\nfor the...for the pilots, but they didn't have time to eat it, so they left it. And we came in.\nThis I will never forget in my life. Then time from that food it..it...1t...you couldn't\ndescribe it. So we had there a few days, and then it came out a lady was...she was in\nAuschwitz. And she recognized my cousin, and she told me you take seven girls, six girls\nwith you and we're gonna open here a you know. So she took me...I mean another five\ngirls, we were like sisters. But the other girls...they took us we should be...we worked for\nthe soldiers. We fixed already not for the haftling, but for the soldiers we worked there.\nThey didn't want we should have lice or something. There was lice. There was people.\nYou just...1t was so much just took it like this. You know I couldn't believe it. I never saw\nit in my life such a thing. They were very sick people there. They took us in the kitchen.\nWe slept there in a basement, but it was you know not bad. Just they gave us like\nnot...uh...it was from straw made.",
        "A: Mattress. It was but it was like in a sack to push in...uh...the straw or hay. On this we\nslept there, but my cousin...there we had good food already. My cousin she knew how to\nsew. And there was the chef had 10 children. And in the night when other people slept\nshe made for the children dresses in the night by hands. She made panties for the...for\nthe...had a lot of children, so he gave us food. You know over there...we had toothbrushes\nhe gave us, you know, to wash the teeth.

        "A: Examined. But I...they examined like this here. But I put the food here and on the back.\nAnd my cousin she used to cry. She told me, \"Toby, you're gonna kill me cause they're\ngonna kill you. Don't do it. Please?\" I said, \"Until I could, I will help people. I don't care\nthey gonna kill me. I wanna help people.\" So they...he gave us...the chef. We had a big\ncan. He gave us every day a coffee or the...uh...the....grease (Pause)",
        "A: No. No. No.",
        "A: Ferena. Sweet. I think it was so delicious and this I put in potatoes and beets. They\nthought it's coffee. You know they said this is. When we worked, they allowed us to take\nit out. But I put in their stuff. And I ran in the hospital. I left it there. And then we get the\nfood. We had food from them. So we didn't eat the food them already from the....what\nthey gave us. It wasn't salt...1t was just water and maybe shells or something. It was just\nlike nothing. No salt. They didn't have nothing. So we took every day. I slept. Other\npeople about 80, 90 or more maybe. We took it out and every day after...in the night\nwhen we came back, I bring it back and I left it there and everybody they were so happy\nto have it, you know. And like this we were there a few months. And then we went again\nto Mauthausen. We went in houses then. We took food from Germans. It was already to\nthe end you know. And we went and...uh...1n Mauthausen we were there a few days. And\nwe Slept in a garage...a big garage, you know. And in the night we heard explosions, but\nit was such.

So the...the...the Americans or the Russians came. They want we should go\nfurther in. The... You know, they didn't want we should be free. So they set us five in a\nline and they give us packages, the owner. They gave for...for the haftling there packages.\nAnd we waited there, you know, to...to go out the gate. And at one time the SS\ndisappeared. You didn't see him. So we came. We took out five, four or five\npackages....by the people. And then the Russians liberate us. When we saw that people,\nwe thought it's...it's God. You know? But the people said we should go away. They\nshouldn't put dynamite. They said he's not gonna leave us alive. So we went out in a...in\na...the wood. A whole day we were there. And in the night we...nothing happened. We\ncame back. We were there a few weeks. And there, you know, we went in...in all the\nhouses. Whatever we wanted we took. They give clothing...to the Germans...food. They\nwere so afraid for us. And then they took us...we were there a few days. But we was very\nafraid for the Germans...for the Germans weren't so nice to the girls. I mean they didn't\nhit the girls, but we were afraid for different things.",

        "A: The border. I said, \"Now, we not going eat, and we not gonna Sabbath to go on the\ntrains.\" So I came to Radiamaria. This is in Romania. So I met there some friends of\nmine. You know, from my town, from Mittelwischo. So they saw me, they said, \"A\nhusband comes home. The wife is not here. Now the wife comes, the husband 1s not\nhere.\" They knew already. I didn't know my husband doesn't live. But they knew. So\nanother husband came home. His wife...I tell you I...I'm the only survivor. A married lady\nand I am alive in that town. All of them were killed. And...uh...I didn't understand then.\n[...L...It didn't go to my head. I heard that but I didn't want to believe. I didn't want to\nthink of it. So I went home first to my...to my home where I used to live in Mittelwischo.\nI found there a few cousins and this pictures what I have now here I hide that pictures\nbefore I went to Auschwitz. And I forgot to tell you where I give my story. I give a lot of\nstory there. They wanted to take my child. They begged me, \"Please leave the baby with\nus.\" So I thought to myself, \"He's going to eat trace. How can I leave my baby to eat\ntrace. When I leave him there, I would have him. But I didn't want. (Crying) So the\npictures I have...I have other few things, and then I went to look for my husband. And I'm\nin the...I was in the...in a carriage...a horse and carriage. I went to the. There we had to\ntake a autobus, you know, a car to go to...to the Bookerwene. It was very far. So I don't\nknow from where I had a ring. Oh, I made something like a...1t wasn't real gold. It was\nsomething just...you know, like a band. So my friend said, \"Why you need it. Why you\nwear that band?\" I said, \"What do you mean why do I wear the band?\" And more I didn't\nwant to ask, and she didn't say nothing. So I went to look for my husband. I went to my\nmother-in-law. I found her. I found all his sister and brothers. They were in...in Transista.\nThey suffered a lot, but they didn't kill the people there. They just...they perished there,\nbut they didn't have food because of the cold weather. There was a brother of mine also,\nyou know, and he survived in a Transista. I was there about 3 weeks by my mother-in-\nlaw and every day when I heard a knock on the door, I said, \"Oh, Gadalia is coming.\" I\ndon't know my mother knew it or not. I never asked her, you know, what happened, you\nknow. Then I went to my brothers. I was there a few weeks, and this brothers...the\nyounger brother...the older brother, they thought I was dead. When my friend came home\nand they asked, \"Maybe did you see Toby?\" They said, \"Sure, that's where I. And they...I\nwasn't even with her. And she told both my brothers I am alive. She saw when they killed\nme. So they thought I'm dead. But when I came home from New Bromberg, I went in\nsecret, you know, where the... 1s there. There I knew my sister-in-law. I went to their\nhouse, and my brother was there. When he saw me he almost fainted. He thought I am a\nghost. He knew I am dead for...for 6 months. I mean 6 months already he's home. He\ndidn't hear anything. People came home and I didn't came home so he said I was married.\nI had...uh...uh....you know, I'm not here. He was white like a sheet. He said, \"Toby,\nI...and he he couldn't talk.\" So we went in there and we talked and then I went to my\nbrother there. And when he saw me, he also almost fainted. He took me in his hands and\nhis \u201d \u00a2. I wasn't that big. Like a baby he hold me and kissed me. (Crying) I was there until\nI came...my brother came. He went to look for my cousin. He was a chaplain in the army.\nI have also here a picture from him. So he remembered me from when I was a little girl.\nHe liked me. You know, they're first cousins. And he said to my brother, Please go and\nbring me Toby. I wanna see Toby.\" So he came to the Bokivina. He took me home and\nwe wanted to go. He was in Czechoslovakia in Prockatisa. New Procka was a little\nvillage Prockatisa. And he said, \"I want to see her. Please bring her.\" So he went home.\nHe was at the Shushan with my cousin and then he came home to bring me. So I came. I\ndidn't have any shoes. There was a little coat. You know the Shushan time it was cold. I\ndidn't have a coat. I didn't have dresses. I didn't have nothing. There was a boy. When I\nwent on the train, he took off his shoes. Big shoes. I remember it was with laces like, you\nknow, with...and he said, \"Toby, you take the shoes.\" I said, \"I'm not gonna take your\nshoes. You don't have...\"\" He went home without shoes. He said, \"You take the shoes.\"\nAnd that...you know, he didn't want to hear for nothing. So we went to the train we\nshould go to Prockitisa. It wasn't room. There we went without money. It doesn't cost\nanything. You know, it was free. So we didn't have room on the train. So we were in\ntop...on the top for 3 weeks. You could go in | day. The train I couldn't believe it. And it\nwas cold. I was crying. I thought I'm gonna die. I said, \"Booda, I couldn't make it any\nmore.\" He said, Please...then I knew it already my husband doesn't live. Somebody\ntold...told my brother and my brothers wanted they should tell me. I should know. So I\ndidn't have to wait already for him, so I went with my brother. So after the 3 weeks...we\ndidn't eat, and I was cold. You wouldn't believe it. So we came to that lady where my\ncousin he was there. He knew where my cousin stayed. He came in the house and she\nknew my brother. Me she didn't know. So he said I am his sister. We came to see Jack.\nSo she said, \"Jack just...they...they...he went to Germany.\" You know they located him\nfrom Czechoslovakia to Germany. I...I started to cry. I didn't know what to do. We were\nhungry. I didn't see with my eyes. She put in a bread. I tell you I couldn't... Give them this\non the table. With two big pots of milk and she said eat. I tell you within 5 minutes we\nfinished everything. We was so hungry. And then we ate my brother said, \"I'm gonna pay\nyou. I'm gonna pay. I don't have money now, but you're gonna get paid.\" And she saw we\nalmost fainted you know. She said, \"Don't worry. She knew Jack.\" You know. And she\nsaid, \"Don't go away. You stay here. Then it come other...a fifth place came other\nsoldiers. And my brother was sleeping there and I was sleeping in the same room with the\nsoldiers, but she made me with a sheet like, you know, separate....I should have my\nprivacy. And there was...uh...American soldiers. We didn't know a word of English. They\nwanted to talk to us. They gave us chocolate. They gave us cigarettes. We\ndon't...uh...smoke. I took a dictionary. I want to...you know, we should be able to...to\ncommunicate, but we couldn't. So 3-4 days we..., you know, we walk in there. And we\ncame back. We went to. We didn't have anything. We didn't have money, didn't know\nwhat we're gonna do. We came back. She said, \"Jack came.\" He came to pick up some\nmail. You know, well...and when he saw me, he...he was very happy to see me. He was\ncrying and he asked me out from the family and he lost a lot. And we sit a few hours. We\ntalk and he picks up himself and he said, \"Now I'm gonna go.\" I said, \"Jack, forget it.\nYou're not gonna go. You're not gonna leave me here.\" (Crying) I don't have money. I\ndon't have anything. You brought me here. You take me where you go. I said I have to go\nthree borders. I couldn't take it. You're a civil. He's in the army. So there was another\nofficer with him, a very good friend. He was a Gentile. And he told him, \"I don't know\nwhat to do with my cousin.\" He said, \"It's no problem. Put her on a hat. Give her a coat.\nHe's a man. Give him a suit like in the army, and when we passes the borders and they\ngonna sleep by the borders and we have the passes whatever think you know us as not\nsoldiers. So we went to work. It was very good. And we had to go fix the car. So we\nwent in there. It was one thing we didn't have to go off from the car. We didn't have to\nbe...some soldiers came out to fix it, and then same soldiers came to us and we said,\n\"Lou, We have girls here. We drink here. We dance here. Come on. What're you gonna\nsleep here. I am sleeping. My brother is sleeping. You know, we're tired. We didn't\nwanna go, you know, with... So Thank God, we fixed the car. We passed the border, and\nwe are in Germany. He said, my cousin, \"Now you can go and dance, Toby. You can do\nwhatever you want. You're free.\" So we came to Germany. It was about 2 o'clock in the\nnight. He had there about 5 girls he knew. Jewish girls. He knocked on the window and I\nhave for you. Open the door. We came in. We were there a few days with them in the\nhouse and then we was there a few...I was there a long...about 2 years maybe. Yes, until I\nwas married. 1945 until 1947 I was in Tishinroit. So we got a hotel. They gave us 2\nrooms. My brother was a Rabbi there. I had my room and the...the owner gave us food\nbut it wasn't kosher you know. A few days we ate there and then, you know, we couldn't\neat it. So I made my kitchen in my house by ourselves, you know, kosher food. And\nwhoever passes...I had people from all over who didn't want to eat tras they came to. I\nmean I was cooking. Was no problem. So then I found another brother. He was in...he\nalso survived, but he lost a woman...a lady, a sister-in-law with five children. He was in\nBergen-Belsen, and then we went to Bergen-Belsen. And then he came. He lived also in\nTishinroit. Then he was a Rabbi. He went to Shrundas. It was not far maybe here from\nRavensbruck, Munich, and it wasn't far from there. So I said, \"I will never get married.\"\nWell, I...I was...I don't know I was jealous...I hated men and children. I really couldn't\nlook at them. I was...I was...Now I want to say...then I didn't. I was...I was very hurting\nand I was jealous you know. And...uh...I said I will never get married. Well, a husband\nlike I had I couldn't have and a child I don't have, but my sister-in-law, you know, the he\ndrives the she got a first child. And she broke her bone, by the pelvis and she had to stay\n8 months in bed. She shouldn't move even. The doctor explained when you break a foot,\na hand, you put it in a cast, but you couldn't put...uh...so she had to lay for 8 months.

They thought I shouldn't throw away some things\nor something you know. And we were there a few days and...uh...it was a...you know, \u201d\nyou know.",
        "A: No. No. I mean I talk I don't see.",
        "A: Yal. So..uh..they hold us for a few days there. But there was a Jewish man there. When\nhe came in, he hit him, and then he told them I had to do it for you what he begged him,\nyou know, we have a child. I was pregnant. And, you know, so he said, \"Look.

And\nthe...there in the hotel, they didn't have two rooms. They said maybe your daughter could\nsleep with you until her husband comes, then they're gonna give her a different room. So\nthey put in a cot, and they had a...air condition high in the ceiling. They took off all the\nknobs. They made the air conditioning so cold you couldn't adjust it, and the air\nconditioning went on my daughter a whole night. She catched a cold. And she\ngot...uh...asthma...or bronchitis. She was coughing. She was coughing. Then the people\nsaid, \"Call a doctor. See what it is.\" So a doctor came, gave her a needle and he killed\nher. And we brought her home in a box so flat. It's still tears. (Crying) And since then I\nwas different. I'm not the same person. I lost a lot of my life (Crying). And then I have\nanother son. He should be well. I went to the country. He was fine. He was everything. I\nwent away. Eight days later, they called me up. \"Yonki doesn't feel good.\" So I said,\n\"What happened.\" He never was sick. He was always a healthy child. He 1s married.\nAbout 19 years got married. Has four children and has a beautiful wife...a wonderful.\nShe's lovely. She's 30. They try. You know she's very good to him and she called me up.

He's\ncoughing. \"What's the matter. Go to a doctor.\" He never went to a doctor. She's a\nnurse...my daughter-in-law. Whenever he had a cough or something, she gave him\nsomething. That's it. But now he went to a doctor and they find out he has leukemia in\nthe..in the bones. I was in...1n bed and my daughter calls me up, \"Something is wrong\nwith the blood.\" I said, \"What's the matter?\" \"Yonk1's sick.\" So I...we went...came back\nfrom the country. She called all my children. She's a nurse and thank God she...she\nmade...she called up Seattle. She went to Seattle, Washington, in that...in a hospital. She\ncalled up all my children. They took blood test and one son, Thank God, he wasn't\nmarried. He was exactly the same match. And Thank God he went to Seattle. He went\nthrough a lot. He was 8 months there. And they changed him...they make him a\ntransplant. Thank God. Thank God. And that's...that's my story. I have more stories, but I\nthink.",
