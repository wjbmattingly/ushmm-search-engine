        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- first thing just to cover was, I understand from your history that you were actually in\nseveral camps during the war.",
        "A: During the war, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Which --",
        "A: From Auschwitz we went to Gross-Rosen, to Ravenbreek, and to the end in Neustadt -\n- Neustadt-Mechlenborg, we lived a couple months til the war finished, yeah.",
        "Q: And when the war was ending, right at that period --",
        "A: When the war was ending, when we were liberated, we tried to head back to Poland.\nThere was a lot, how you call it? Mins, explosive, underground. One of my friend died\nfrom that. She pulled a pia to make a piece of bread, and she right away with a shrapnel.\nSo, we decided to leave Germany, we went back to Poland. That was a mistake, because\nin Poland were very bad.",
        "Q: Let me ask you first --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- at the end of the war, which camp were you in?",
        "A: Which camp I was? Beside the ghetto, in the camp, I was in Birkenau, in Auschwitz\nsince 1942, til 1945. But in the Dead March, when the Russian was behind, we have to\nrun together with the Germans.",
        "Q: And when the Russians were coming, which camp were you 1n at that point?",
        "A: No, that was the Russians and the American came in the same day. That\u2019s in Neustadt-\nMechlenborg, the same day. They both came in the same day, yes. And then we tried to\nhead back to Poland.",
        "Q: What -- What had the conditions been like in that camp? What was going on in the\nweeks that was leading up to liberation?",
        "A: You mean in Birkenau?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm. When we came, we have to start to build the camp, because was just the electric\nwiring all around half. We haven\u2019t got no water, no nothing. It was like a lot of malaria, a\nlot of camp -- a lot of sickness, because was -- they make the camp from a farm, so we\nhardly could work, it was still [indecipherable], the ground. And I was there til 1945, in\nthe same camp, very close to the crematorium, just a couple steps away.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you have much of a sense of how the war was going, that things had\nturned against the Germans?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know nothing about it. If they find a pencil, or a piece of paper on\nsomebody, right away they hang the person. So, we didn\u2019t know nothing wi -- but we saw\nthe planes running above, but we didn\u2019t know nothing of what\u2019s going on. That -- that\u2019s\nthe way it was, until we came to Germany, we realized that the war was coming to an\nend. It\u2019s going to take -- but every day, people were dying anyway, from hunger. Every\nminute, actually.",
        "Q: What was it that -- that made you realize the war was ending soon? What did you see?",
        "A: What did we see? Because the German starts to go away from Poland, from the\ncamps, and come closer to Germany, over there, in the other camp. There was no place\nanyway, to run anyway, because all the camp was fu -- filled. So we was tha -- we didn\u2019t\neven know when the war finished, because I tell you how we find out. Near us was\n[indecipherable] from pilots, where the Germans shot down. French pilot, English pilot.\nWe didn\u2019t speak English, but they cut the wires, and they told us we are free, because the\nGerman ran away from the camp, they locked up, and we didn\u2019t know the war was over,\neither, but we understood what\u2019s happened. They went out, and we went out, and we\nstarted to run to the houses to get some food. But all the houses was empty, not with\nfood, with people, because they were sure when we came out 1n the camp, they going to\nkill them. So they just -- they left all the -- in the whole city was empty houses, th-the\nGermans run away.",
        "Q: What -- when -- when they cut the wires --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and they said, you know, you\u2019re free --",
        "A: Yeah. Over there was not electric wires.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not in this -- in Auschwitz was electric wires, not over there. They told us that we\nstart to run for food, that\u2019s the first thing, whatever we saw, sugar on a wagon, any --\nanything what we could eat, we started to eat, because for six years we were starving to\ndeath, really.",
        "Q: But at the -- at the moment that that happened, and you realized --",
        "A: Yeah. We --",
        "Q: -- the war\u2019s over, we\u2019re free, do you remember -- did -- anything people said to each\nother, or how did -- do you remember your own emotions at that time?",
        "A: Yes, we -- we was -- we was happy the war -- the war was an end, but we wasn\u2019t\nhappy, we lost everybody. But we didn\u2019t know what to do, actually. It -- 1t wasn\u2019t\norganized, nothing was organized, we just was running from one city to the other, and we\nwouldn\u2019t know what we going to do, where we going to end up. It wasn\u2019t yet order -- we\nmade a mistake, we went back to Poland, that was all. We couldn\u2019t go back to Germany\nlater. So a lot of people who stayed in Germany, they organized them, and they got help.\nWe didn\u2019t have any help in Poland. I came back to my city, and I went up to the\ngovernment to ask for help, we were 10 girls. So he gave us the key from the school,\nwhere we was finishing school, that building belonged to a Jewish family, but they --\nthey got killed. So I told them, \u201cHow about food?\u201d He said, \u201cNothing else. Just stay.\u201d So\nwe were sleeping on the floor, and we were starving, actually. We didn\u2019t have what to\neat. It was horrible. So, after a couple weeks, some people from my town came back to\nthe city, and he told us that we shouldn\u2019t stay there, because they already killed four girls\nthat went in -- in a hiding place there. The Armia kryova went in, they killed them, and\none was hiding under the bedsheet in Israel, they tried to kill them. So the -- the life was\nvery danger in Poland. So he says, \u201cDon\u2019t stay in that city, you\u2019re going to be caught --\nkilled. You better come to Lodz, to a big city there are kibbutzim there, they\u2019ll take you\nin.\u201d So we were happy to have [indecipherable] had, and a piece of bread. You could\nonly stay six months. We have to smuggle ourselves to Israel. So I -- I knew I had a\nbrother in Russia, I was already in contact with him, so I didn\u2019t want to go, I want to\nwait. So they send me to another kibbutz, in Bialystok, to stay another six month. We\nstood there a couple months, in this -- and these, the Polish people was very angry, they\ndidn\u2019t want the Jews back. So one night they came in, the police, and they give us\nammunition, they going to attack us, going to be a pogrom, you have to defend yourself,\nwe can do nothing about it. So five people went to [indecipherable] on the train. We tried\nto pull out from Bialystok. Four of them got killed, they took them down from the train,\n18 - 19 year old. What -- Hitler let them live, but the Polish wouldn\u2019t let them live. One\nwas hiding under a pleated skirt by a lady in the train, so he survived. So he crawled\nback, and he told us to pick up the bodies. So, when I saw that, in time my brother came\nin, so I pick up my brother, and I says, \u201cI\u2019m not staying here. I\u2019m going to\n[indecipherable] right here the Bricha taking out the people,\u201d because they says it\u2019s a\ngraveyard in Poland.. When we went out on the street, and we saw dead people, dead\nJews, they wasn\u2019t missed by nobody, their families was killed a couple years ago in the\ncamps, and they came back from Russia. So they got killed in Poland. So I took my\nbrother, and I went on the train. We sitting on the train, and a Polish woman says to me,\n\u201cYou know, they took down yesterday, Jews, and they killed them.\u201d Like she gave me\nthe idea that I\u2019m going to be killed too, in a couple hours. So I almost fainted. Finally, we\nreach Vulsa -- we came into Vulsa, I fainted. I couldn\u2019t take it any longer. So I find out\nthat the Bricha organized people -- actually, they organized people who came back from\nRussia. Russia let in a half a million Jews. So the older people -- so I got together with\nthem, and we start to go -- the Jewish agency made up with American government that\nCzechoslovaki should let us in, out from Poland. It was like a couple thousand people. I\nwas the only one with a number, actually. So, we went to Czechoslovakia. In\nCzechoslovakia we stood overnight, and we have to go to Austria, and they prepare\ncamps for us. We came to Austria, a few thousand people. The people who should\nprovide us with bread, sold the flour, and we didn\u2019t have nothing to eat, we have to run in\nthe field to dig out a potato -- a pickle, to eat. That was after the war, in 1946. In time, I\nmet my husband, because he had a couple brothers in Russia, in the army. So he told the\nRussian people coming back from Russia, maybe one of his brothers will survive. None\nof them survived, they all got killed. So I met my husband, so he says to me, \u201cHow\ncomes a number\u2019? It\u2019s mostly people with the Russian.\u201d So I told him I was waiting for\nmy brother, he\u2019Il -- til he came back from Russia, and together I decided to leave Poland.\nWe have our chance, the Bricha -- thanks to the Bricha. So my husband told me that he\ngot papers to go to the United States in a month, a cousin sent him papers. But if I marry,\ntwo people can go on the same certificate. I didn\u2019t even know my husband, to be honest\nwith you. I decided, what do I got to leave? Israel is closed the doors, you couldn\u2019t go to\nIsrael anyway, we have to smuggle ourselves. The people who went there, went to\nCyprus, you know. I didn\u2019t have where to go, I was hungry. My husband, when he was\nliberated, he didn\u2019t live this town. So the UNRRA gave him -- put him in a hotel, and\nthey gave him three meals a day. So when I came in, I see this [indecipherable] table,\nwith white tablecloth, and eating. I couldn\u2019t believe it, that\u2019s a dream. So I decided I got\nmarried, only the condition my brother should stay with us. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\nFrom that month, turn into two years. They didn\u2019t let into the United State, they\u2019re going\nto elect a president, it took two year. So, a very hard time in Austria. We couldn\u2019t work,\nwe have to live on a ration, [indecipherable] gave us. A herring, a piece of bread, and\nthat\u2019s how we lived for two year. Finally, we find out, in order to go to America, we have\nto go to Vienna. Vienna was occupied by the Russian. So we got ourselves on that train,\nand we start to go. The Russian soldier came out, and he says, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t go there.\u201d\nSo he took us down from the train. So we was waiting for another train, and we came to\nVienna, on the boat, on Vienna. Now, we have to go out from Vienna to Germany, with\nour paper. Rush -- Vienna was occupied by the Russian, so we couldn\u2019t go. So we were\nstanding, they tore us down from the other train, and they told us, \u201cYou got to live here,\nyou got to vote here, and die here. You can never go out from here.\u201d We were like 10\npeople. So, we standing at night, and thinking what we going to do, til a -- a German guy,\na young guy came over to us, and he says to us, like that, \u201cYou know, my father takes\npeople over the border. If you want to go, you give me a few dollars, til -- Pll take you,\nshow how to go over the mountain.\u201d If I see the mountain during the day, I wouldn\u2019t\nclimb up. So we took -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be if he catch you?\u201d The Russian is out -\n- downstairs, you could see they working with the car. He says, \u201cWell, I tell him my cow\ngot lost, and I went to look for the cow.\u201d He got us over the mountain, we stay overnight,\nbut how we got down from the mountain, the very high mountain, I figured maybe I lay\ndown [indecipherable] they had a hard time to get down. We came down, finally, from\nthe mountain, we didn\u2019t carry anything. We came down from the mountain, we already\non the other side, in Germany. In Germany, you can\u2019t go in a hotel at night, everything is\nclosed. And it\u2019s raining, we don\u2019t have a place where to go. While we was walking, I\nwalk over -- a man was walking with a lady, and I says to him, \u201cWhat -- we just came\nfrom the other side, and it\u2019s raining. Where can we go?\u201d So he says to us, \u201cCome on, I'll\ntake you to a hotel, maybe they\u2019ll let you in.\u201d So we thank him, we came in the hotel, and\nthe guy said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, no room.\u201d I says to him, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t care what you see, I\u2019m\ngoing to sit here in the lobby, I\u2019m not going out in the rain. No way I\u2019m going out. We\ndon\u2019t -- we just came in, and we have no place else to go.\u201d So he gave us a room, and we\nstood there. Once we got there, we went to Bremen, in Germany, and we have to wait\nlike five weeks til we can go to America. The problem is, people who came to the Joint,\ngot it good. They greet them by the plane. They gave them -- they pay six months rent,\nthey gave them a job. We didn\u2019t came through the Joint. My husband\u2019s cousin was a\nreligious man, he wants to show in the shul he do something, so he borrowed the paper\nfor somebody else, so they was not responsible for us. So, we came he -- we came to\nBoston. From Boston we have to take a train to Chicago. Nobody waits for us, we didn\u2019t\nknow any langu -- English, nothing. So we sitting in the Union Station, and in the\nmorning -- a whole night -- in the morning, I hear Polish women, speaks Polish to each\nother. They come to clean -- and I finished school in Poland. So I walked up and tell them\nthe story there. Nobody waits for us, where should we go, what should we do? So they\npick up a telephone book, I gave them the address and the telephone, and they called the\npeople, and they picked us up. They picked us up, then we came to Chicago. I came to\nthe HIAS, and told them the story, they said, \u201cWe\u2019re not responsible for you, you can\u2019t --\nwe don\u2019t want to do nothing, not even a job.\u201d Luckily, I find here a friend, he took me\ninto the factory to work. I was two days in this country, I went to work. And I didn\u2019t even\nhave money for the car fare, a dime, so he paid the car fare. And I went there, I got a job.\nMy husband didn\u2019t get a job right away. We went through a very hard time in Chicago,\nwe couldn\u2019t get a -- a place there to live. We stayed with them three, four weeks, so\nfinally they rented a room for us. The lady put in, in a closet, she put in a bed, in a walk-\nin closet. There was no heat, where to put a chair. That\u2019s wasn\u2019t a -- that wasn\u2019t the worst\nthing. She got three teenage girls, we couldn\u2019t use a washroom in the morning, and I have\nto run downtown to punch a card. So I washed my face in the kitchen, and I ran for work.\nI worked a couple of years downtown, til -- til finally we got another apartment, you\nknow, just rented. If you was lucky, just rented an apartment, by somebody, not on our\nown. So finally, my husband couldn\u2019t get a job, so somebody recommended the\n[indecipherable] work he does, a lot of Jewish and Polish people open up a cleaning\nstore. For that you don\u2019t need money. You take an empty store, you buy an old sewing\nmachine. I still didn\u2019t give up my job. So I worked there, we open up the cleaning store,\nmy husband was in the cleaning store, and that\u2019s the work, I came to work in the store,\nand I worked til 12 at night to keep up the thing. Next couple years, and I already have a\nlittle money in the bank saved up, and I have the children. You know, it was very hard,\nthe beginning, we don\u2019t have help from nobody. Mostly refugees come, they have a lot of\nhelp. The Joint pay the rent, they -- they get them a job, they watch over them. I didn\u2019t\nhave that luck, so the same thing after the war, people stay in Germany, the -- right away\nthere was organized camp, they got what to eat. We was on the bad side, we was in\nPoland, we couldn\u2019t go back, the Russian didn\u2019t let us go to the border. So, we live hard\ntimes.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a couple things. I just need to --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Move this slightly.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Let me ask you this -- let\u2019s -- let\u2019s leave your story right there --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- where you\u2019re -- you\u2019re now in this country, but I\u2019d like to go back actually --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- to where you started, and pick up on a -- a couple things --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that you said. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m still a little curious about that first day, when you realized\nyou were free. I mean, how long do you -- was it after you heard you were free that\neverybody started to run into the town and look for food? Was it just a couple minutes,\nwas it a couple hours?",
        "A: The first minute, we thum to run for food, nothing else existed, just food. I ran up and\nI -- I went up on a wagon, started to eat a lot of sugar. Anything what we saw, we started\nto eat, we were so hungry. Most people got sick from it, because the stomach was so\nshrink, we couldn\u2019t even eat, but -- but people were so hungry, they though they\u2019 ll eat the\nwhole world, would be enough food. That\u2019s how they started to eat. And the German got\nplenty of food in the house, mind you. For 10 years, they storing food for 10 years. So\neach time we went in a different house, and -- and we ate there, you know.",
        "Q: And you said that the houses were empty?",
        "A: Yeah. They all left, they run away. Near our camp, you couldn\u2019t find a house that\nGermans should be occupied there. They were sure that we going to kill them when we\ngo out.",
        "Q: What if when you had gone to --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- any of these houses, what if you had found some of the Germans in there? Did you\nwant to kill them?",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t, they wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: But I\u2019m saying, what if they were? Did you -- did you want to kill them?",
        "A: Well, I would like to, but I -- I couldn\u2019t do it, no. I tell you what\u2019s happened. There\nwas, near [indecipherable] time, was a lot of soldiers, and there was -- and when -- and a\nlot of raping going on, too. So when we went into the house, came in a Russian officer,\nIll never forget, a very intelligent man. And he says, \u201cThey let out from the jails, the\nworst thing, and they rape the woman. I\u2019m going to sit the whole night and watch you.\n[indecipherable] I can do nothing about it,\u201d he told us. So that\u2019s what -- he was sitting a\nwhole night, and they start to knock in the door, and then, when they saw him, they run\naway. Then we went a little further, and the same thing happened. So we made up -- the\ngirls, we were 10 girls, we made up, if they knock on the door, we run out in the back\ndoor, and there was a lot of broken trains, so every girl was laying under a train the whole\nnight, cause train didn\u2019t move, they was broken. And we was laying a whole night, and\nthere was [indecipherable] got in the house. A whole night that we were laying there til\nit\u2019s got light, then we -- we came out from the -- under the trains, and we start to look to\ngo any further. There was a big struggle after the war, a big struggle. Was no\ngovernment, was no nothing.",
        "Q: Did you -- right after the liberation, where were you for the next few days or weeks\nafter that?",
        "A: All by ourself.",
        "Q: Did you go back into the camp, or once you left the camp did you never go back in\nthere?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t go back, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t go back. You know, in a room like that,\nhalf the size, was maybe a hundred girls. We was laying down, there was no room to turn\nover, that\u2019s how it was. We didn\u2019t go back. We went in the houses, we took some clothes.\nSo then, we went on a train, the train was standing [indecipherable] going. We took some\nclothes for ourself, we went on the train. The train was standing all night. So a Russian\nfella came in, and he says, \u201cOh, girls are here, okay, we going to bring my friend.\u201d So we\nran out from the train, and we wait there, the train left with all our stuff, we have to go\nlook for other stuff. We didn\u2019t want to go back to that train. Was a big struggle after the\nwar, with no government, no [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So from the -- from the moment of liberation --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you were -- you were totally on your own?",
        "A: On our own. Nobody could help us. As a matter of fact, we saw our -- our German\nguard with a wagon, with horses. So we walked over, he should give us the wagon. He\nsays no. So we went to a Russian fellow, and officer, we told him we want the wagon to\ngo away from the camp. So he took the German by the head, and threw him in the -- in\nthe ground, he says, \u201cYou take whatever you want, you\u2019re entitled, and go ahead.\u201d One of\nmy girls knew how to operate a wagon with [indecipherable]. See, we tried to go any\nforwarder and forwarder, til we got to Poland, and then we have to leave everything\nbehind, because they -- they -- they checked us up. We didn\u2019t have any money anyway,\nbut was free -- traveling was free, people didn\u2019t have anything. I mean, Poland was our\ngraveyard, it was impossible to be there, they killed 50 people in Kelts. That\u2019s the people\nwho lived through the war, they came from Russia with children, they killed them all.\nWhatever they find a Jew, they killed him.",
        "Q: Did you know that this was happening in Poland before you went back there, or not?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know -- we didn\u2019t -- that we should go. We just didn\u2019t want to be in\nGermany, so we tried to go back in Poland. It was a mistake. We didn\u2019t know they going\nto organize. We didn\u2019t know what to do actually, where to go. Finally I went to -- back to\nPoland, and some people took back property, you know -- that we went back. There was\nno way to go back without an organization to take care of you.",
        "Q: You mentioned -- you mentioned earlier, and I think you mentioned in one of your\nvideo interviews, that Jews were being killed by the -- how do you say it, the armia --",
        "A: Armia kryova, yes.",
        "Q: And what -- what kind of group was that? Who were they?",
        "A: That was -- that were like a underground Polish army. They was for one thing, just to\nkill the Jews, that was their idea. They killed four girls right near our town, in a little\ntown.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Had they been fighting the Germans, as -- were they like the underground, or\nwhat -- what were they?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know if they was fighting, but that was the -- after the war, that was after\nthe war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Maybe they was, but I don\u2019t think so -- that they did. Only the Poles would fight after\nthe -- the German -- [indecipherable] the Russian, they organized themself, but not the\nother, not the others. But Jewish people was fighting in the ghettos all over, a lot of\npeople don\u2019t even know about that. In Bialystok, 70 people -- I went -- went there --\ncame there to find a grave, 70 people were fighting, girls and boys was fighting against\nthe German.",
        "Q: And I think while you were in one of the camps, there was an uprising in one of the\ncamps, wasn\u2019t there?",
        "A: That was in Birkenau, yes. One of my girlfriends, she -- they hanged the four girl. See,\nthe woman [indecipherable] ammunition, and when the men came into work in the camp,\nthey gave him the ammunition, you know, little. Well, when the uprising was there, I\nthought when they -- they killed a couple Germans, they put them in the oven, they did\nwhatever they could. But, in a few minutes later, you couldn\u2019t see the sky, that\u2019s how\nmany airplanes [indecipherable] German. And the German wants to find out how did the\npeople organize themselve, and to kill so many Germans, and all this thing. Well, they\nran across one girl, but she broke down -- not mine girlfriend, from my town, she broke\ndown and told them on three others. They arrested the girls, they kept them in a bunker.\nOne of my friend, she was typing whatever they say. They took her -- I don\u2019t know how\nyou call it, the strip? What inside with steel, you know, strip, like it\u2019s -- how you call it?\nA strip. When you going to beat up something, you have a --",
        "Q: When you\u2019re going to --",
        "A: The thing, yeah.",
        "Q: Oh, you mean, like a whip?",
        "A: A whip, yes, and they put in steel, and they beat them on the body, on the naked body,\nand a doctor was there to revive them, so they can get out of them. Mine girlfriend never\ntold anyone, and the four girls was hanged, right in the -- we have to stay and watch. This\nwas only four weeks before they evacuated from Auschwitz. Like in January, that\u2019s\n[indecipherable] they killed four girls, you know.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea, during that uprising, how many Germans were killed?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know. They couldn\u2019t kill that many, because some of them started to run,\nyou know, away, and they shot them down anyway. They kill mostly the Germans, but\nthe -- but the Sondercommando were working, you know. They -- they -- they killed\nthem, they put them in the oven, they did a lot of things, you know. But they didn\u2019t\nsurvive, these people, either.",
        "Q: Did you see any of that happen?",
        "A: No, I couldn\u2019t see, there was -- no, that you couldn\u2019t see. But I saw the sky was right\naway with airplanes, and -- and they start to shoot down whoever starts to run. So I don\u2019t\nthink everybody make it, you know, out.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to after the war, when the -- this Polish group --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- was killing Jews.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The -- the English translation is -- I think it\u2019s called the Polish Home Army, in\nEnglish.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you sure that it was members of that group that were doing these killings?",
        "A: Yes. That was their name, that was their main thing, to kill all the Jews. Jews lived\nthere 400 years, they have some property, and for them, the war was a plus, because they\ngot in in a minute -- lot of people was poor Polish, too. And they got in, they got\neverything. They didn\u2019t want a Jew -- if a Jew got in in a house, he didn\u2019t get out alive\nany more. So we don\u2019t even know how many was killed. They didn\u2019t want the Jews there\nany more, so they could have everything.",
        "Q: When you were, you know, leaving Germany, and you decided at first to go to Poland",
        "A: Yeah, we did --",
        "Q: -- and you said well that --",
        "A: -- we didn\u2019t realize the reaction, we didn\u2019t realize the --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- We Ca --",
        "Q: Well that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what I wan -- I wanted to ask you about.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because, you had lived in Poland, I mean --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did -- wi --",
        "A: [inaudible]",
        "Q: -- did you -- from your past life, you hadn\u2019t --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t feel that the Poles were hostile to Jews?",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: Or that they were?",
        "A: -- they were very hostile, but we thought after the war, maybe it\u2019s changing. We\ncouldn\u2019t believe they\u2019re going to -- ready to kill the Jews. We didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t think of\nit. In po -- was very bad in Poland lately, after the war, you know what\u2019s happened in\nPoland. First of all, when we went [indecipherable] they told us the Polish, in the same\nage where we were, \u201cGo to Palestine, you don\u2019t belong in here. That\u2019s not your place.\u201d\nThat was one thing. We got up in the morning, we saw all kind of signs on th -- on the --\non the building, the J -- the Jews are Communists, the Jews are that and that. Then, after\nthat, they put down the -- they organized them in the churches. Every Pole who came in\nfor the village, have to wear a green band, and stay by the Jewish store, so when the other\npeople come in, they wouldn\u2019t let them in. You know, that\u2019s a Jewish store, you\u2019re not\nsupposed to go to the Jewish store. That was a open boycott in Poland. Even in the\n[indecipherable] asking what you going to do with the Jews, with three and a half million\nJews, which to build up Poland, 400 years, they say, beating up make no sense, but\nboycott them with the business, that\u2019s yes. That was written all over, in the papers. So the\ngovernment was hostile, and the people was 10 times more hostile.",
        "Q: So when you went back to Poland and found all this going on --",
        "A: We knew about it.",
        "Q: Did it make you angry? How did you feel?",
        "A: We was angry, see, we had -- we have a house, I want to take back the house from the\ngovernment. Mine girlfriends the same thing, they have houses. Then they figure, maybe\nwe'll find somebody from family. Maybe they was in different camp, and they survive.\nThat was the reason we went back. I wouldn\u2019t want to stay in Poland, but bec -- be --\nthere was no way out. If not the Bricha, everybody will be killed there, they wouldn\u2019t\nleave anybody else. They took care on them. They knew -- they knew, because the\nBricha, some of them was born in Poland, and they knew. That\u2019s the only way to get out\nthe Jewish people from there.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nLonia Mosak. This is tape number one, side B. You went back to Poland, and found all\nthis going on --",
        "A: We knew, but --",

They knew -- they knew, because the\nBricha, some of them was born in Poland, and they knew. That\u2019s the only way to get out\nthe Jewish people from there. So they took [indecipherable] a half a million, when they\ncame back from Russia.",
        "Q: The -- you mentioned I think that nine or -- nine or 10 girls that y-you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you were together.",
        "A: We were together all the time.",
        "Q: Who were they? How did you -- how did you get together, and how did you --",
        "A: Well --",
        "Q: -- form your group, and --",
        "A: -- I tell you something. In Auschwitz, we\u2019re like that, when you stay in a group, some\nspeak French, some speak Yugoslavian, some speak Greece, so everybody stick to their\nown town, to their own friends, what we went to school together. So, I was with mine\ngroup. Everybody got their own clique, like they say, because we couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate. The others speak Greek, they speak French, they speak Italian. We\ncouldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t understand. So they did the same thing, they grouped themself\nwith their own people, with the same language. That\u2019s the way it was.",
        "Q: So was your group -- were they from your town, or --",
        "A: From mine town, mine -- we went to school together, town. The thing is, but I didn\u2019t\nmention it, they always made selections in Auschwitz. The selections were like that.\nBecause they couldn\u2019t bring a townsbut on the outside, like they got a note, 3,000 people\ngot to be killed. So, they took from the place that we were standing -- people only survive\nin the wa -- the last in the line. I came back to the barrack one Hanukah, 1943, yeah, I\ncame back, we were thousand 1n the -- in the barrack, only three came back. They count\nup, if they have enough, they they\u2019ll let the last go. Only three came back from thousand.\nAnd that -- each time there are selection, somebody ask you how you survive, I always\nsaid the same thing, I was the last in the line. That\u2019s the only way, not because we were\nsmart, or we was healthy, didn\u2019t matter. They have to burn so many people. And that was\neven worse, because the people when they came from a transport, they didn\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s going on, it was the night. But when they took the people from the camp, and we\nknow where they\u2019re going, that wasn\u2019t -- that was very sad. There -- there was crying,\nthere was hollering, they were singing the Haptikvah. But they knew where they going,\nthey saw every -- and you know how when they put the people on the truck, they didn\u2019t\ntook him down gentle, they open up, and just like potatoes, they roll down on the -- on\nthe ground. That\u2019s the way they treated people.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve talked to, in some of the other interviews --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- ve done with people who were in the camps --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: They --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- they -- they had almost given up, or were almost ready to die, that they didn\u2019t care\nany more.",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s happens to me, too.",
        "Q: \u2019'm wondering how you felt? That happened to you?",
        "A: I really wanted to commit suicide, to be honest with you. We were starving in Poland,\nthere was nobody to -- I started to sew a little bit to make a few cents. We -- we bought a\nfew potatoes, that\u2019s where -- we didn\u2019t have an-any nothing, the Polish government\nwouldn\u2019t help you. So, I really wanted to commit suicide, there was no way out. So, in\ntime, came a guy from mine town, what he was going to the Yeshiva, by a -- by a\n[indecipherable] next to the Yeshiva. So he knews me. So he said, \u201cListen, don\u2019t stay\nhere, the life\u2019s danger. Ill take you to Lodz.\u201d There was kibbutzim there. We didn\u2019t\nknow where to go. How can you go when you don\u2019t know where to go, to whom to go?\nWas very sad. So, he took a few of us, we went in there, he took us in a kibbutz. So, to\nme it was a haven, you got a roof over the head, and you got a piece of bread. And then I\nhave to go to Bialystok, and was very sad of a day.",
        "Q: So, did I understand this right? You were saying that you wanted -- you felt like\ncommitting suicide, even wa --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- when the war was over?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s was in 1945. There was no way out, we couldn\u2019t go back to Germany, we\ndidn\u2019t have anybody. Even you\u2019 re starving, you -- you kind of don\u2019t feel like to live any\nmore. Luckily, that guy came in, to one -- he was born in our town, too. And he looked\naround, and he said, \u201cListen, let\u2019s go from [indecipherable] they already killed four girls\nin that little village. Let\u2019s go out, stay in a big city, in a kibbutz, ther -- at least they\u2019re\norganized.\u201d So we were happy. He was like an angel coming from the sky. You know, we\nwere happy that somebody show us the way where to go. The big ci -- the big -- in our\ncity, they wasn\u2019t organized, you couldn\u2019t talk to nobody. Like I told you, the government\ngave me the key from this school, where I finished school, laid down on the floor, no\nclothes, no beds, no food, no nothing. It was -- it was horrible. It was very bad.",
        "Q: The -- just go back for a second, the gr -- the group of --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- girls from your town.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of their names? Do you know if any of them are still alive?",
        "A: Oh yeah, tell you all the names, yeah. One just died last year, she was in -- in New\nYork. One just died. Some of them are in Israel. I hear a few already died too, over there.\nSome of them end up 1n a institution, they lost their mind, you know? A lot of them went\nup in an institution there. And one of my ne -- closest friend, [indecipherable] in the\nunderground, she lived in Canada, and she got killed. A car went up -- she went out from\na wedding, and going to go home, and a car went on the sidewalk, and he killed her. That\nwas my closest friend, from mine town, we went to school together. So here, we have to\nmake new friends. The others, I don\u2019t have any. I only have one friend in Detroit which --\nshe came here in 1939 -- 1937, with a grap -- a group of youngsters. That\u2019s the only\nfriend from mine childhood I have. All the other -- yes, I meet them in Florida. They\nwent in Russia, where they survive, in Russia. Some -- a few was in the camps, so we get\ntogether all the time, and we go out for dinner, and we keep together, the group. Some\nlives in Detroit, some lives in Philadelphia, some lives in New Jersey. A few of them,\nyeah.",
        "Q: So that -- that -- that group of you all --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- can you say for the record what some of their names were?",
        "A: Yes, I'll tell you the name. Which I meet in Florida, yeah?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: These people? Becau --",
        "Q: Yeah, but also the -- the original group that you --",
        "A: -- the others went -- the original went to Israel, and some of them died over there\n[indecipherable] institution. One died in New York. I really don\u2019t have any -- the\noriginal, they\u2019re not here any more. The one there, what I meet in Florida, they went to\nRussia, that\u2019s how they got saved, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So we meet then.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But again, I was just wondering, just for the record --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- if you could just say their names?",
        "A: Yeah, I can tell you. One -- only one is there, Dinka Blanke -- well now, she got\nmarried, she got a different name. One is named Dinka, and one is named Kirsch. Those\ntwo was in Auschwitz, but they got married, you know, so they change their name. All\nthe others didn\u2019t survive, no. I hear they wa -- they die in Israel, one was [indecipherable]\ninstitution, yes. No, I had -- my friends now, it\u2019s not the original friend. None of them.\n[ll show you the picture here when I finish school, and I graduate. Only one was what --\nshe was in the underground, in -- in -- in Auschwitz, she\u2019s on that picture, too.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Let\u2019s -- let\u2019s pick up the story where you went to the kibbutz.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then how long were you there? What happened after that?",
        "A: I wa -- we could only stay the six months in one kibbutz, we have to smuggle ourself\nto Israel. Because I was waiting for my brother, so they sent me to Bialystok.",
        "Q: How did you know that your brother was still alive?",
        "A: Oh, some people smuggled themself out from Russia, on the boat there. My brother\nwas waiting til they give him a legal -- legal to go out. So, when I talk to them, so I told\nthem, oh, I was with him in Siberia together, so I already got a name. And I start to write\nletters there, and it took a couple months til he came back, 1n a legal way. So that\u2019s when\nwe was together nows, we have live together. He couldn\u2019t come to the United State, I was\non the papers for my husband. He was -- not 1945. They got two categories, 1945 - 1946.\n1946 couldn\u2019t go to America. They came from Russia, no, not these people, only the\n1945. So he was there in -- living in Vienna, and I got some papers for him in here -- to\nbring him over here, but he got -- unfortunately he got killed a couple of years later in a\ncar accident. He got run over, yeah. That\u2019s was -- I -- I\u2019m the only one from my family,\nfrom my father\u2019s side. From my mother\u2019s side, nobody ever survived, none of them.",
        "Q: Did you -- and, right after the war --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- did you know that, that no one was left but your brother?",
        "A: I-I-I knew, I knew, but anybody who survived, there was offices where you put on\nyour name, if somebody else come. Now, I knew that nobody survive, and I didn\u2019t see\nany name. Sometime when my brother was still in Russia, and I announced on the radio,\nand I wrote postcard -- Kirshenbaum is my maiden name, so a lot of people came from\nother town, but 1t wasn\u2019t my brother, they just got the same name, but wasn\u2019t that.",
        "Q: And then, after the kibbutz, where did you go?",
        "A: No, like I told you, the Bricha took us out from Poland, we went to Austria -- to\nCzechoslovakia first, then to Austria. In Austria, I remained there, because I got married.\nSo, I took my brother and t-took us two years to come to the United State.",
        "Q: How did you meet your husband?",
        "A: He came to look for his brothers. He got four brothers in the Russian army, so he\nthought maybe somebody, because those really -- a transport with the people came, but\nnone of them survived. And he was surprised to see [indecipherable] because I was the\nonly one, but mostly people from Russia, when they came back. So that\u2019s how I met him.\nSo, took me out, and show me the hotel, and got papers, and that was like a miracle. So I\ndecided to get married.",
        "Q: Did you -- this is a little bit of a funny question --",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: -- but, I mean, did you get married because he had papers, and he could get you to\nAmerica, or did you get married because you were in love?",
        "A: N-No, n-no, no, no, no, no. I tell you something. He was very nice, was a nice person,\nhe was the -- he was not far from out of town, you know, junhanfrum. He\u2019s from Ben-\nGurions -- he treat me nice, he was a very nice man. So I figure, what do I got to lose? I\nhave -- everybody got married like that after the war. You met somebody, you get\nmarried, that\u2019s the only way to do, not to be alone. That\u2019s was the only way. No, if I\nwouldn\u2019t like him a little bit, no I wouldn\u2019t marry, no. That\u2019s for sure not.",
        "Q: Were you madly in love with him, or kind of in love with him, or --",
        "A: We tried to be in love, you know, but we really didn\u2019t know each other, to be honest\ntrue. We have to do it in a couple days, because that transport was in Austria, have to go\nforaday. I kind of sneak out from the barracks, and came to the little city. And you\ncouldn\u2019t stay in the little city until you got papers. We have to pay up in the government\nto paper, that I should stay here. I couldn\u2019t go back there, those people go forward\nalready. So I kind of sneak out from that camp, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: So you said you -- you tried to be in love. Do you think that he felt the same way?\nThat --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yes. We -- we got along nice. He got a brother, too, we all lived together,\nmine brother, his brother, we all lived together, and I kind of took care on everybody.",
        "Q: Sounds like you were almost like creating -- like kind of creating instant families?",
        "A: Yeah, we did, we did, yeah. We did. He got a brother came over from Germany to\nAustria. I got the brother from Russia. And I said, whatever I do, I don\u2019t go away from\nmy brother, and got to be with us together. So we all lived together, yeah, that\u2019s true. His\nbrother couldn\u2019t come because to America, he come later. My brother come later, maybe\ntwo years later. But when he came already, I had an apartment, because I make money, I\nprepare everything [indecipherable]. Now, when my brother came, I already had a child,\nyeah. Was two years later, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So then -- then you went over the mountains, right? That was -- that\u2019s when\nwe came out to Austria, to go out to the German border, in -- and Russia occupied\nVienna, you couldn\u2019t go out from Vienna, you have to sneak out, was very hard. Was a\nvery hard thing go -- it\u2019s really hard to believe it, how people manage like that.",
        "Q: Yes, yeah, I\u2019m --",
        "A: To climb on mountain, then to go down it [indecipherable] yeah. But we did it on the\nnight, that -- that\u2019s what we have to do, a lot of things which sometime we think it\u2019s\nimpossible, but we have to do it.",
        "Q: When you think about these things now --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- I mean, so many years have gone by, and you re -- you remember some of these\nthings --",
        "A: Yeah, sure.",
        "Q: -- does it seem kind of unbelievable to you?",
        "A: Yeah, it\u2019s unbelievable to other people, not for me. Luckily, I had a profession, I went\non the second day to a nice job to make money. I was fast, I was working piecework.\nAnd we were on our own, with no help of anybody. I was lucky I found this man, you\nknow, from my town, and he took me in on the job, in the factory, was a big factory. I\nworked there a couple of years, yeah.",
        "Q: When you did come over to the United States --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- did you come on a boat?",
        "A: We come out on a boat, you know. Not on a regular boat, a boat where they bring\nanimals, everybody was sick, like little sack, you was laying a little sack. And voo -- a lot\nof people said, \u201cThrow me in the ocean, I don\u2019t want to live any more.\u201d They were\nthrowing up, was horrible. And it was a big storm, 1t was even in the papers, written\ndown, they didn\u2019t thought that that boat will make it. It was on a little boat\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Where did you leave from? Do you remember the name of the boat, or any of that?",
        "A: No. The boat I don\u2019t remember, but the -- that -- but I remember we came with an\nairplane, we came -- no, I don\u2019t remember the name of the boat, no. It was a -- a\nmiserable boat.",
        "Q: What -- where did it leave from?",
        "A: Oh, they -- they brought us to Boston. In Boston we stay overnight, and we took a\ntrain to come back to Chicago. And the HIAS paid, but I paid them back, because they\ntold me that I -- you come to a sponsor. So the first check I got, I paid them back 70\ndollars, in that time was a lot of money, but I paid them right away back, you know.",
        "Q: So the first place you landed in the United States was Boston --",
        "A: Boston, yeah, overnight --",
        "Q: -- but you were just there for the night, right?",
        "A: -- overnight, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: Do you remember when you pulled into the harbor what it looked like, what it was\nlike to finally be in the United States, do you remember any of that?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know nothing. I think a Jewish organization was waiting for the people\nto come down from the boat. There was Gentile people there on the boat, too. They were\n-- took us out, I don\u2019t know what, a certain place, and we stay overnight. They gave us a\n[indecipherable] he said we got to go on a train next day. So, we didn\u2019t even see Boston,\nwe didn\u2019t see those things.",
        "Q: And then you had a train ride, that -- was that a couple days?",
        "A: No, next morning we have to go, we have to go next morning, they was back in\nChicago, and I come to Chicago, nobody waits for us. We didn\u2019t know the English\nlanguage. So, luckily, when Polish women came to work in the -- whole night we were\nsitting on a bench, and I see they\u2019re speaking Polish, I said, \u201cYou help me out? Because I\ndon\u2019t know who to call, and what -- what to do.\u201d So they said, \u201cJust give us the telephone\nnumber, we\u2019ll take the telephone book,\u201d and to call him [indecipherable] come pick us\nup. They was very Orthodox people, very religious people. So we stood there for a week,\ntil we got a bedroom someplace, then we moved out.",
        "Q: Do you know which group the -- the people who came and met you at the train station,\ndo you know what group they were connected with?",
        "A: No, with nobody, that was a second cousin of my husband\u2019s, they carried the same\nname Mosak, the same name. So they came, and they want to show in the shul they do\nsomething, but that wasn\u2019t good for us. It didn\u2019t work out good for us, because we was on\nour own, we have to look for work and all this thing, we don\u2019t know the language. You\ncome to a country, if you have a profession, it\u2019s half the battle, you know what I mean?\nYou work, you learn the language. I went to night school here. But at least I make a few\ndollars, you know? Because in the beginning, I was really was starving here, too. I asked\nthe woman where we were, and to borrow me a dime for a roll, til I get a check. We\ndidn\u2019t have anything.",
        "Q: When you were taking that train ride, and when you got here, and all, I\u2019m wondering,\nhow did things look to you? Here you were in this totally different country, very different\nfrom where you\u2019d been.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Did it seem like a very strange place?",
        "A: It was very strange. When I looked out, when I was on the station, and I saw the cars\nare running all night, I says, \u201cHow I\u2019m going to mingle into this place?\u201d Looks to me like\nimpossible. How we going to live here? How we -- especially you don't know the\nlanguage. I only knew a few word. It was hard, it was very hard, very hard. But if you\nhave a profession, whatever you go, you can make a dollar for -- 1t was half the battle\nright away. I started to make nice money that time, yeah.",
        "Q: Were you happy to be in the United States?",
        "A: I was very happy. I was very happy. I took every advantage. We were 40 on the table,\nI was the only work overtime, I didn\u2019t go home. Saturday you got a double check, double.\nIn the summer, I didn\u2019t took the vacation, I got another check. I was the only one for 40\nwoman, to come into work. I figure I'll do anything not to be poor any more. I\u2019Il make as\nmuch money as I can. And that\u2019s what I did. Soon, I got the money, I start to run out, buy\na television, buy a radio, everything. And the people said, \u201cIt\u2019s not Europe, you get it\nnext day.\u201d I thought if I don\u2019t grab it right away, I wouldn\u2019t have it. Every chance I got, I\nbuy -- I bought for the house, yeah. There we got an apartment, yeah.",
        "Q: And you -- you started to have children, when was that?",
        "A: A couple of years later. We came end of \u201948, my daughter was born 1950, in\nThanksgiving. Until I had money, the bank, until I have an apartment, then I had the\nchildren, yeah. Because we didn\u2019t have help from nobody, nothing.",
        "Q: And how many children all together?",
        "A: Two, two daughters I have, yeah.",

        "A: Well, I want to tell you something. My husband was a sick man. Later on I find out he\nwas sick. Wasn\u2019t sick when I was married, six months later I find out that he had\nbleeding ulcer. I would never do it to nobody. Even I could make myself better, and I had\na chance, and I didn\u2019t took the chance. But for me, I [indecipherable] the world, I would\nnot do it to nobody. I'd rather suffer than to make myself better. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Pm -- I\u2019m not following exactly what you\u2019re saying.",
        "A: Yeah, I could have have a better life if I want to change, in that time when I come\nhere. It was a lot of men, and only a few girls came to the United State, but I didn\u2019t -- I\nwouldn\u2019t do that to nobody, not to my husband, not to nobody. But me, I work as a\n[indecipherable] and what I make up is for good and for bad, you know. I wouldn\u2019t do it.\nSome people do it, a lot of them break up right away.",
        "Q: You saw that?",
        "A: Yeah. They live in New York. They want to come to this country, and they want to\nhave the paper, and they broke up right away, they came a couple weeks later, and they\nmarry somebody else. A lot of them, yeah.

Yes, but here lives a lot of refugees, around other\nbuildings here. So we get together, we play cards a little bit, we go out together. We got\nlike a social life here. Where I live, everybody moved away to Florida, to Las Vegas,\nArizona, so I lost the friends over there, too.",

As\na matter of fact, I came to visit me, a lady from Milwaukee, and she was in camp -- no,\nshe was hidden, I think. In how -- those days, a young person, maybe 42 - 43, she said,\n\u201cOh, I never saw the number.\u201d I said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you read in the books, in the paper, in the\nmovie?\u201d She says, \u201cNo, I see the first time.\u201d So some people doesn\u2019t know, even Jewish\npeople, a lot of them doesn\u2019t know about it.",

        "A: Yes, but at least they have a knowledge now, they teach them in the schools, it\u2019s a\nlittle bit knowledge, more knowledge. I went a couple years ago downtown, it was a lady\nfrom Austria, and she\u2019s supposed to tell the people what\u2019s happened. So, a Gentile guy\ncame in, a young man maybe 38, and she told him she was a child, she\u2019s supposed to be\nin the movies, and then she was sitting on the street, and the German -- the Austri was\nspitting on her, you are a Jew, and that then. And they show the pictures, she is now\nmarried, she have kid. So the guy says, \u201cI\u2019m so happy that I came to the museum to find\nout, because I would never believe it. Now I see it in person. Now I can see it.\u201d The guy,\na young guy, he said. Some are interested, and some are not interested. I went into a\nrestaurant last year, and a couple boys come in -- | think they\u2019re from Mexico, and they\ntold me they have Arab friend, and the Arabs say bad things about Israel, and all this\nthing, the Jews do this. So I said, \u201cListen, you don\u2019t have to listen to that. If you want to\nknow, I'll tell you the story. First of all, Jewish people doesn\u2019t go and attack cars, buses\nthe children ardi to school. Jewish people doesn\u2019t do this thing, the Arabs do this thing.\u201d\nIf one guy got crazy, he went in one time, got [indecipherable] killed people, that doesn\u2019t\nmean the Jewish people do.

So then I show it to my daughter. Then, after the war, when I came to the\nUnited State, they told us [indecipherable] open up a book with picture. So I says, \u201cI have\nsome pictures.\u201d How do I have pictures? I have an aunt in Pennsylvania, which I didn\u2019t\nknow I had, and her children was born here, so I decided soon I came to this country, I\nget in touch with my aunt.

So they took him to\nNovidburg, where I was born, but I didn\u2019t live there, only one year. After the war, I went\nthere, to Novidburg, and I digged out those graves. I find out [indecipherable] the Polish\npeople, they told me exactly how many people, they\u2019re saying seven people. Two of mine\nuncles, and then [indecipherable] the daughter-in-law\u2019s father, and then -- then a boy,\nmaybe 19 years old, they told him he threw away the [indecipherable], and a couple from\nPlodz. In order to dig that out, I find a few people in the city, I went to the city and they\nhelped me. We have to have a permanen -- a permit. So, the governor told us, only they\ngive us a permit if the -- all of them going to put in one casket, because they was laying\nin a shallow grave, you know, like that. So I decided, yes, whatever they do, it\u2019s all right.\nSo we put them in one casket. I didn\u2019t see the faces, because you couldn\u2019t rec-recognize\nthe faces from 1942 til 1945. And they put them on the Jewish cemetery there, and I put a\n-- a [indecipherable]. But my daughter went in there, and she said it\u2019s no more there. You\nknow what the Polish people did to the cemeteries. They make fields to -- to grow food\nup at the -- the -- liquidate the cemetery over there. That\u2019s what I did after the war for\nmine uncles, you know. And they have families -- I have the pictures from them, which I\npresent at the -- Washington They have two daughters and two son. One daughter I saw\nin Auschwitz only one day, then I didn\u2019t see her any more. And so they all got killed. My\nother uncle, [indecipherable] was killed, got three daughters. They all was killed, too.",
        "Q: What were the names of the -- your uncles that were killed? Their names?",
        "A: Binjamin Kirschenbaum, and Aaron Kirschenbaum. Then was Linden Birkdeboy, but\nhe was killed, and then was mine cousin, she was like 19 years old, she didn\u2019t want to go\nto the shadar. So she took a pin, and marked on the bricks, that here lay in the\nKirschenbaum. When I came after the war, I couldn\u2019t go to that brick, they build a\ngarage. I tried to get in to get out that brick, but I couldn\u2019t, it was already build a garage,\nand I couldn\u2019t get to that. But that what I tried to do after the war.",
        "Q: Have you gone back to Europe since --",
        "A: No. My daughter went, but no, I can\u2019t look at the faces any more, no. I wouldn\u2019t go\nback there for no money in the world. I wouldn\u2019t -- I know the Polish people, they very\nunconsi -- they were worse than the German. If th -- 1f a Jewish -- if a Jewish man, he had\na business, you know, he put [indecipherable] to hide the cloth, they report it to the\nGermans right away. Everything [indecipherable] they told them who was rich, and who\nwas that, who was educated. You know, they got the -- it was surrounded with enemies\nall around, even after the war, but no liberation for the Jewish people. Nobody will ever\nknow how many Jews was killed in Poland.",
        "Q: You were -- you know, all this time, you\u2019re living in the Chicago area, lot of Polish\npeople here.",
        "A: I hate them.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: I hate them. I tell you why. There is a shul, a Reform shul near Tuye, so the Polish\npeople maybe d -- the third generation, what they were born here, they put in a letter, the\nJews are kikes, the Jews are miserable. My mother told me when I was a little girl I\nshouldn\u2019t go near. They was born here. We took the letter, and we went to Puchinsky,\nhe\u2019s a Polish man, he was a older man. They didn\u2019t sign a name who did that. No matter\nthe fifth generation they born here, the Polish people are miserable, and terrible, and anti-\nSemitic. That\u2019s how they\u2019re born. That\u2019s what the Bricha said. In the milk, they got in the\nmilk when they was born, from the mother, to be anti-Semitic. That\u2019s the way they are.\nThat\u2019s the way they are. I wouldn\u2019t go near him. And mine daughter went there when\nthey interview some college professor, they said they\u2019re going to teach in the school, go\nand make a remark how they treat them after the war, they got red in the face, and they\nstart, \u201cOh, Poles was killed, too, the Russian killed, too.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t say -- apologize\neven, no. That\u2019s the way they are. They talk nice, gentle, but you don\u2019t know what they\nreally are.",
        "Q: So just in town, do you avoid Polish neighborhoods, or --",
        "A: Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. I avoid them, yes, I avoid them. I don\u2019t want to have nothing to\ndo with them. I try not to. Now, you know, they come to -- they come here, they clean\nhouses. One lady went there to exchange some money with them, and they didn\u2019t know\nshe\u2019s -- she\u2019s a Jew. So she says to -- to them, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s -- the -- the -- the Jewish people\nthey should only drop dead, and they have such a nice home.\u201d They come here to clean.\nThey get money for it, pa -- clo -- that\u2019s the way they are. I wouldn\u2019t let them into my\nhouse.",
        "Q: Did you ever think about going to Israel, moving to Israel\u2019? Cause you said you were\nin a Zionist organization when you were young.",
        "A: Yes, I went there three times already. The first time I went because somebody told me\nfor asthma it\u2019s good in Israel, so I went for a month to dry out, and somebody told me no,\nsomebody seek whatever you go. I went there three times already, yes, in Israel. But\nwhen I got married, in the paper it was for the United State, and we came here, and we\nstart to make a living, and then you have a family, then you can\u2019t pick yourself up and go.\nBut I was there three times for mine granddaughter\u2019s Bas Mitzvah, mine grandson\u2019s Bar\nMitzvah, we went there back, the last couple of years, yeah.",
        "Q: When you were younger, and you were in the Zionist organization --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- did you have any sort of dream of one day going to Israel, and living Israel?",
        "A: Yeah, that -- that was our goal, but how many could go? One -- maybe one -- one\nfrom each town. That was our goal to go to Israel, that was we were dreaming about it.\nWe was real organized in that time. But I wasn\u2019t the youngest grou, and were older\npeople wi -- that did emigrate to Israel. So they make like two people can go on one\ncertificate if they got married, and they come to Israel, and they dissolve it. So, older\npeople did go, yeah, from mine town. But we didn\u2019t have a chance yet, you know. People\nwanted to go to Israel, but they wouldn\u2019t let us in. Remember Vivian from England? He\ndidn\u2019t want to upset the Arabs, to let in Jewish people to Israel.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you ever -- did you ever feel any regret that you didn\u2019t wind up in Israel\ninstead of here, or --",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t feel a regret, I tell you. I don\u2019t think I could take the climate there, it\u2019s very\nhot. When I was there about 25 years ago, I got very sick. I didn\u2019t know the climate, I\nwent in the summer. And I didn\u2019t thought I\u2019Il make it home alive, that\u2019s how sick. I could\nnot breathe. I -- I could not take the -- if -- in Jerusalem a little better, but in Tel Aviv,\nimpossible. An-An-And I tell my friends that -- they were saying I lay on the floor, I\ncouldn\u2019t breathe, I -- they says to me, \u201c We here a couple years already.\u201d I says, \u201cYou got\nadjusted, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d I was very sick, but I went back for the kid\u2019s Bar Mitzvah, and the\nBas Mitzvah, we went back.",
        "Q: When you were -- one question the museum had was, when you were in the ghetto,\nbefore you were sent to Auschwitz --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah?",
        "Q: How long were you in the ghetto, do you remember?",
        "A: A year. I live with horses in a stable, because they put in from each town there, and\nthere was no way to go in. Like in one room lived [indecipherable] 10 families. So we\nwere the last ones. When the German brought us over there -- should I tell you how we\ngot on the -- on the boat? We have a -- a castle 1n our town, with kings used to live there,\nnow it\u2019s for -- then it was for recreation. So they took all the Jews into that castle, and\nlocked the door. Then they start to [indecipherable] the people, if everybody\u2019s dead. Ifa\nbaby fell down, and somebody picked up, they both got show. Got to be quiet. Then, by\ngoing out from the door [indecipherable] door, was standing in the black uniform, with\nthe rifles, beating up everybody. Blood was running like water. Then they put us on top.\nBetween us was a doctor, he came from Germany, I think he got one artificial leg. They\nthrow him on the ground, and they step on his face with the boots. That doctor came to\nAuschwitz. We do -- we would do the same thing, he got the pills. He, his wife, his child,\ncommit suicide right away, when he came into Auschwitz. We didn\u2019t have that, he have\nit.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have what?",
        "A: Pills to commit suicide. They took us in the ghetto -- so they watched for 20 minutes,\nthey going to beat up people, they have to find a place. But there was no place where to\ngo, SO we run in a Stable, and we live in a stable almost a year. Nothing to eat, people\nwere dying from typhus. The only thing 1s they open up a kitchen, the Jewish people open\nup a kitchen, give a little bit soup, everybody. We was begging the German, why don\u2019t\nyou kill us? He says, \u201cNo, we need the bullets on the front. You going to die ever --\nanyway.\u201d That was in the ghetto. And then, from the ghetto, took us to [indecipherable]\novernight, and right on the -- on the trains, on those closed trains, there were people you -\n- women used to give urine to drink, the babies was crying for water. No water, keep us\nlike that, locked up for three days. Dark, no bathroom, no nothing. Half of them die\nanyway. And then the -- everything they did at night. They put on the train at night, we\ncome to os -- we didn\u2019t know where we were, we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. And right\naway was selection. Let\u2019s say we come up 3,000 people in a train. They only pick up a\nhundred women, a hundred men. The rest have to go to the gas chamber. So we didn\u2019t\nknow -- I wa -- right away, didn\u2019t see my parents, nothing, was dark. We have to put\ndown our suitcases, whatever somebody got, and they only picked up 200, and the rest\nhave to go. You could be young, you could be strong, it didn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s how it was.\nAnd then we find out when we came there, that\u2019s the -- the gas chamber is working day\nand night, for 24 hours. Day and night. You know, people were standing 1n the line, they\nbegged to go in already. No washrooms, winter, it\u2019s cold, children are crying, they beat\nyou up. They want to get over with it, already. They sing the Haptikvah, they know\nwhere they going, they see the flames, and a few minutes later, 1t will happen to them. So\npeople don\u2019t understand all these things. People who wasn\u2019t there could never visualize.\nNow, everything 1s p -- fixed up, [indecipherable] taken. Can\u2019t -- they can\u2019t visualize\nthose things. Day and night, were six crematoriums working. But when the war comes to\nan end, they took apart five, so nobody should know there was six. They only left one.\nThey didn\u2019t manage to liquidate the one.",

A lot of my friends -- I had\na friend from Alsia. She said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, what you went through, that you -- you\ngot that guts to go to work, and make money, raise a family.\u201d But when you depend on\nyourself, then you do it.

I -- I\u2019m in such a bad situation, I start to run, here\u2019s a\nselection, here\u2019s this, and it always comes back, it\u2019s so real, it\u2019s so real when it comes\nback.

That\nwas -- one time they told -- I work in ausch -- in Birkenau, I work by bricks, with the\ntuchkas you know, schlep brick? I work by that. One time they announced they need 50\ngirls. So I said maybe I\u2019ll have luck to go to work [indecipherable]. I stand there, and I\nfind out, one of my friends from Czechoslovakia come over, she said, \u201cRun away. They\nneed 50 girls to sterilize them.\u201d So when it\u2019s 20,000 people on the one ground, you can\nget lost. So I kind of turned out away, and I run away from there.

At least they didn\u2019t stay by selection. They didn\u2019t watch me -- people get\nburned all the time. They suffered too, they have to live on rationing. They went to work.\nThey wasn\u2019t beaten up like we were beaten up. One time, Ij -- I don\u2019t know. We get a\npiece of bread, we didn\u2019t know should we eat it up, or take each time a crumb. Maybe I\ntook a crumb t -- he noticed that, I don\u2019t know. I was sitting, he gave me with the rifle,\nmaybe 10 times over the head. I lost mine conscious, he was sure that I am dead already.\nThen he walked away. And I see black rings on mine face. Then mine girls came over,\nand says, \u201cOh, you still alive, come over.\u201d The whole face was bloody, the whole head\nwas bloody. I didn\u2019t even know, we didn\u2019t have a mirror, we didn\u2019t know. So when I\ncame back to the camps, \u201cOh, you probably were beaten up today. Look at what,\u201d -- I\nsays, \u201cYes, I was beaten up. I don\u2019t know why, but I was.\u201d They always had to catch\nsomebody. It\u2019s a miracle.

        "A: -- yeah, so -- yeah, yeah, no, they couldn\u2019t come in here. Yeah, they couldn\u2019t come in\nhere, because here lives refugee, and they says here we live in a free country, we not --\nwe not going to let them do it. And they did it.",
        "Q: So, did you throw stones?",
        "A: Yeah. I came with all my friends. Whole packets of them. They ran away, the police\nran away. They was afraid they\u2019re going to be killed here, yeah. In Europe you couldn\u2019t\ndo that, but here we could do it. That\u2019s the difference.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you yell at them?",
        "A: No, it -- we threw stone -- they was far away, you know, they put up a pla -- they got\nso many stones, they ran away with the light. They would be killed if they stand up to\nthrow, that was sure. He was arrested, that guy, later on, because he was a gay man, or\nsomething. So he was arrested, I -- I think he\u2019s still in jail.",
        "Q: How many stones did you throw?",
        "A: A lot. A lot. We took -- filled pocket. All my neighbors came. I don\u2019t think one\nrefugee remain in the house in that time. I didn\u2019t live here in that time, I live in\n[indecipherable] Park. But we all came here, and we was waiting for them. And wis -- we\norganized ourself in -- you know, in the shuls, and here and there, they\u2019re not going to\ntake -- let them take care of us here. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: After s -- and then they ran away\u201d",
        "A: Oh, they ran away. They didn\u2019t come back any more. They knew they going to be\nkilled if they come here, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So when you were heaving rocks at them or whatever --",
        "A: Yeah, a lot of rocks.",
        "Q: Did it feel good?",
        "A: Yes, it makes me feel good. Here you could speak up, and we do something. In Poland\nwe couldn\u2019t do nothing. With the Germans, we couldn\u2019t do nothing. They have the\nammunition, we have nothing. But a lot of Jewish people fought in there, in the woods,\nand all over, they fought.",
        "Q: Do you follow things in the news? Like, for instance, now, in the last few months,\nthere\u2019s been the war in Serbia, and Kosovo, and all that, and --",
        "A: Yes. Yeah. I follow all the time the news. I want to tell you something. I am really\nsurprised that even one Jew remains in Europe. They had a chance to go to Israel, to\nSouth America, here. Not one Jew -- because always wars over there, especially against\nthe Jews. If the economy du -- is not good, it\u2019s the Jew\u2019s fault. Like in Russia now. If the\neconomy, the Jews -- the Jews, all the Jews, it\u2019s all their fault. They shouldn\u2019t remain\nthere. They have no business. I know they di -- the JUF tried to help him -- take him,\nwhatever they do, but they had [indecipherable] they had no business to be in Europe.\nAfter the second war, nobody should remain in Europe, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So, the United States, and the NATO countries, they intervened in Kosovo.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And one of the reasons that people like President Clinton have said --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- that they have done it is that they --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- you know, cannot permit this kind of atrocity to happen.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When you -- when you see this happen today --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- does it make you think about --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- all those years ago, and why nothing happened then?",
        "A: Yeah, no -- nobody, no. Nobody, no, nobody. Roosevelt was a big anti-Semite, he\ndidn\u2019t let the Jews come to talk to him. They knew what\u2019s going on very well, but they\ndidn\u2019t -- because they only killed Jews, it\u2019s all right. The government didn\u2019t do -- they\nturned back a boat, and the people commit suicide. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s how they help. Now,\nit\u2019s like that. After the second World War, they fought against the Germans, the other\nside. He\u2019s a bad guy, but he fought against the German. The others cooperate with hi --\nwith Hitler. But I don\u2019t like to see people be killed by -- like one lady says her father was\na teacher, they took him out -- I don\u2019t like to see people to go in and go out from the\nhouse, otherwise you get killed, the young people get killed. I don\u2019t care about the war,\nbut I don\u2019t like to see it. And I\u2019m glad that the world wake up. Came an Englishman on\ntelevision, he -- he\u2019s not even 30 years old, he said, the politicians have plenty on their --\non their conscience what they didn\u2019t do on the second World War, now they woke up,\nfinally, and a lot of people slaughter. At least they gave them a help. Us, we just went to\nthe gas chambers, nobody raise a finger, nothing. The trains was going day and night,\nnobody helped us. If they ran to the woods, they was killed by the Polish people, too. So\nI\u2019m glad when I see that, I\u2019m glad what I see that, yes. They rise up and -- and -- and they\ndo something about it.",
        "Q: Do you think that -- especially I think 1n the last 10 or 15 years, there\u2019s been a lot\nmore talk, a lot more -- more films, documentaries, books, whatever, about the\nHolocaust?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: More people talking about it, do you think that that has had any affect on things like,\nyou know, them intervening Kosovo now, that it\u2019s a result of -- of that?",
        "A: Yeah, I thi -- yeah, people speak up now, which they didn\u2019t speak for many years, and\nI\u2019m gl -- I am glad, because lot -- how long we going to be on this earth? People are 75 -\n76. People are dying every -- here, just in Skokie, three of the people -- three of the\nrefugees die already. I went to a meeting. People are dying, wouldn\u2019t be nobody to tell\nthe stories. I\u2019m glad that they -- I went to Washington with -- was thinking about building\na museum, in that time the beginning, and I was very happy that the -- the result 1s good.\nI\u2019m very happy to see that. But a future generation, they should stand up, and not let a --\nsomething like that happen, because never, never in the history happen what\u2019s happened\nin the Jews, in the second World War. Something like that never happened before.",
        "Q: Have you ever gotten -- some of the people I interview, they get calls from schools or\nwhatever --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- to come -- come and talk to our class --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- about what happened, whatev -- do you ever get any of those calls, or --",
        "A: No, I\u2019m not really a speaker, you know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ma -- I think I -- I -- In -- I\ncan\u2019t do that, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Well, you\u2019re doing okay here.",
        "A: Yeah. Maybe are people more qualified, you know, to do those things.",
        "Q: But you haven\u2019t been -- no one\u2019s ever asked you?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: If some teacher did call you, and say, why d -- I heard about you somehow, would you\ncome and talk to my class, would you go?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, if they ask me, I probably will. Yes, if they ask me, I probably. I tell you,\nI went to a lecture after the war, I don\u2019t remember the name of the guy, and he says like\nthat, there isn't enough paper yink -- paper and ink, to put down what\u2019s happened in the\nsecond World War. No matter how many book, that\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s just impossible.",
        "Q: We --",
        "A: The people have to dig their own graves, you know, near Russia, where the -- the\npeople have to dig their own graves, and jump in, and they -- and they shot them. They\nenjoy it, they\u2019re very sadistic people. They used to take babies, and throw in the air, and\nshot them like birds. They very sadistic people, the German. And I still think they still\nare. I don\u2019t believe them.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think they\u2019ve changed?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t -- I was mad when they took away the wall from --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nLonia Mosak. This 1s tape number two, side B. We --",

I don\u2019t believe them.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t think they\u2019 ve changed?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t -- I was mad when they took away the wall from Germany, you know, they\nhave a dividing wall with the Russian, put up a wall, East Germany. They should never\ntake away the wall. I saw a woman came on television from England, and she said that\nwas -- that wall should never be taken away, it was a protection for certain -- for other\nwalls. A security, like they say, a security blanket. They should never take away the wall,\nmade the Germans strong again. Because the -- Germany 1s the richest country in the\nworld. They took away everybody from the people. If you have a gold teeth in your\nmouth, they took out. If you have a watch, if you have a ring, di -- everything took away.\nThey\u2019re going to have for generation, generation, what they have. They robbed the whole\nyeero, the bank, everything, they took over everything.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you don\u2019t like the notion of Germany getting stronger?",
        "A: No, no. They should never ta -- I was always against -- they took away -- and a lot of\npeople come on television, English people, fame -- that said no, that was a big mistake.\nThey should be never strong, because they start two World Wars already. And you never\nknow the future. You know how anti-Semitic they are now? When they ga -- they\norganized themselve? They admire Hitler, and everything. They didn\u2019t have a lesson.\nThis -- and a lot of them got big government jobs, but they were in -- in the Gestapo, and\nthey change their name, they got bi-big jobs there. How can you trust these people? I\nwould never trust them. They -- they came in, a German, to my house, we weren\u2019t rich.\nHe told me to open up the drawers, he want to take away everything. I says, here is, take\nthis, take this, take -- he says, \u201cNo. Where did you -- where did you stack your better\nstuff?\u201d I said we were not rich, we didn\u2019t have any better stuff. So he says, \u201cYou know, I\nwas here in the first World War. They chased us out in this country, but this time we\nstaying here forever.\u201d That\u2019s how -- they was sure of themself. They occupied whole\nEurope. That\u2019s how [indecipherable] that was a man maybe 60 years old. He was in the\nfirst World War, they were sure, they were so hypnotized they were going to -- they\ngoing to counter the whole world.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s just -- before we -- I\u2019m --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- \u2019'm running out of questions, but before we --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- leave off, I just want to make sure -- we talked about how you got over here --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and how you were working --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and that you had children and all --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and then we started talking about other things. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of years went\nby.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that\u2019s for sure.",
        "Q: Any interesting things in there that you want to -- that you want to talk about, or\nmention?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m in this country, and I could build a life, and live a better life. I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m happy for that, that I could do it, you know? Most of the people did it.\n[indecipherable] they know they can\u2019t depend on nobody, and they have to pick themself\nup, on straps like they say, and do it on their own, and this country give you an\nopportunity for that. So I\u2019m very grateful for that, yeah.",
        "Q: When you came over here, did you become a citizen right away?",
        "A: No, it takes five years. I didn\u2019t know the language then. We have to -- we went to\nnight school, we went to school, we learned the language. Five years later we became\ncitizens, yeah.",
        "Q: What -- did you have different activities, or hobbies, or what would you do for fun,\nyou know?",
        "A: Oh. Oh yes, we -- we organized ourself. We got organizations in the newcomers.\nYeah, I was -- last week -- I\u2019m going next week to the -- how you call it, the new citizen -\n- we call it the new citizen, B\u2019nai Brith, the -- all this, have meeting once a month, if you\n-- | always attend those meetings, we always go there. We organized themselves, yeah,\nall the time. We stay together, like the refugees stay together all the time, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were you -- before the war, were you very religious?",
        "A: Well, my parents was very religious, I was more progressive. I belonged to a Zionist\norganization, they called the Shemiratsier. They was not that religious. Traditional, but\nnot religious, not like that. Like, you couldn\u2019t take a pencil, write on Saturday, or do\nthings like that, ride a bike. We did it, we did those things, yeah. But in they -- in the\nsame time, the older peoples in the organization was well educated, so they teach us, we\ngot courses, all kind of courses, book reviews. Was very interesting, yeah.",
        "Q: Did that cause any problems with your parents, that you were in this sort of\nprogressive group --",
        "A: No, I di -- I --",
        "Q: -- and they were more religious?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t like it, they didn\u2019t like it, but we did our own way, yeah. They didn\u2019t like\nit, but in the house we were religious, I didn\u2019t do nothing t -- against them. But when we\nwent out with the group, or we ride a bike, they didn\u2019t know about it.",
        "Q: With all you, you know, lived through during the war --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- and everything you saw, did that change the way you thought about God, or --",
        "A: Yeah, it did change, but I want to tell you something. We didn\u2019t believe in God when\nwe was in Auschwitz, when we saw what\u2019s going on, but when I come to this country,\nand I have children, you sti -- you have to hang up the little tradition. It gives you a little,\nyou know, there a lot of things what\u2019s going bad in life. There are sickness, all -- you\nhave to hang up with something. So I decided we should hang up to something, and\nbelieve in God. It\u2019s a little bit easier, the life 1s easier. But you get very sick, oy God\nshould I get bet -- should I get better, maybe I'll get out of it. So you always mention that.\nBut deep in hearts, people didn\u2019t believe it, no.",
        "Q: In Auschwitz, you say, people didn\u2019t believe --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: -- did you believe before you went to the camp?",
        "A: Yeah, before yeah, but not after that, when I saw, no. No, nobody believed in there.",
        "Q: Why did you feel that way?",
        "A: Because we couldn\u2019t see the young [indecipherable] the young kids, and crying, and\npeople go to the gas chamber. That\u2019s wasn\u2019t -- there 1s something could control that, you\nknow what I mean? The Germans used to tease us, \u201c\u201cYou see what we have on our\nbuckle? God is with us, not with you.\u201d That\u2019s what they told us. And when the airplanes\nstart to circle in Auschwitz, and we was looking, they said, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\n12 -- 12 -- 12 o\u2019clock, the world will be -- all be -- you\u2019ll be killed 15 minute before 12.\nThat was their intention to do. If the world wouldn\u2019t come to an end, another year or two,\nnobody would survive, no way. How long can you starve like that?",
        "Q: So in the camp you decided there\u2019s no God.",
        "A: No, that\u2019s something --",
        "Q: Then when you have kids, you feel like well --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- you know, you should hang onto some tradition.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s was mine idea.",
        "Q: -- but does that mean -- does that mean you started to believe in God again?",
        "A: Well, yes. Maybe, maybe yes. I wanted the kids to have a traditions. I f -- I felt the\nholidays and everything, just like my parents did, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, but is it just, you know, you want the tradition, or you -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m just\ntrying to get, did --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- do you believe there is a God now?",
        "A: Now I believe it, yes, now I believe it, even though in that time I didn\u2019t. When you see\nbad things happen, you don\u2019t believe. Then you change your mind, maybe there 1s\nsomething, yeah.",
        "Q: But then, where was he?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what we ask, our questions, all the time. Even the religious people in the\ncamp, women, they were very religious. But now, when I come to Florida, and I sit on the\nbench near the ocean, and I see a lot of men with long beards, with numbers, they very\nreligious, and they suffered during the war, but they very religious now. They said,\n\u201cThanks God I wasn\u2019t a German, I didn\u2019t have too good a job.\u201d That\u2019s what they tell me.\nBecause I talk to -- when I see a number, I go over, talk to them. [indecipherable] this\nthing. Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you -- you have to actually --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- press that button.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you think that there is any answer that can explain the Holocaust?",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t think so. Did -- people didn\u2019t foresee that. There was a lot of young\nmen, if they knew what\u2019s coming, they would do something, they would go in the woods,\nand run. Nobody forseed it, because the Germans was lying to us. They told us we just\ngoing to take -- take another place for war. They was lying. Then they open up atellager\nin Auschwitz, or they took in kids like in a kindergarten, and all the thing -- they promise\nthem all in the world, you see, if the Red Cross come, we have kids here, we have good --\neverything was covered up, like in Theresienstadt, too. And then they took the people to -\n- to -- the -- the people was fighting [indecipherable] bare naked. They says, \u201cYou\npromised us, we [indecipherable] why you do it to us?\u201d So they was beaten up over the\nhead. They didn\u2019t have it what to fight. That was before the Russians came in, took away\nthose people.",
        "Q: So, do you think it was just this tremendous evil, and there was --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- there\u2019s no other explanation, or --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. A lot of people I know, from mine town, intelligent people, they belong to\na Socialist organization before the war, they came to Auschwitz, and they went to the\nelectric wire. They said, \u201cIn a world like that, we don\u2019t have to live. It\u2019s no use. Doesn\u2019t\npay to live in a world like that, we all going to be killed anyway.\u201d And they were big\norganizers, bele -- believe in Socialism and all these things. Very intelligent people, and\nthat\u2019s what they did.",
        "Q: Could you tell us again about when you were in Bialystok?",
        "A: Yeah, that -- I was in Bialystok, yeah. That\u2019s where the police brought us, and\nammunition, I have to learn how to use a gun to defend ourself, because he told us it\u2019s\ngoing to be a pogrom there. And you know why, they told us. A lot of women put their\nbabies to Polish families. Let\u2019s say a brother, a nephew, survived the war in Russia, they\ncame back for the child, the child was already five, six years old, the child didn\u2019t want to\ngo. So they steal the kids out. They came in the uniform, and they took them by force, to\nthe German border, into Israel. So they decided the people killed their kids, to have blood\nfor matzos at Passover. They right away have an excuse, you know. And that\u2019s when they\nbrought in ammunition, we should defend -- we can do nothing, it\u2019s going to be a pogrom\nhere. That\u2019s when I took my brother, went to Warsaw, and I know that the Bricha is\nwaiting for the people, to take them across the border.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you -- you left Bialystok at that point?",
        "A: Yeah, then they come after us, too. Little by little, they all left. There was no place to\nstay there now, any more.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The life was in danger.",
        "Q: While you\u2019ve been living in this country, d -- have you -- do you travel much, just\neven on vacations go overseas, or what?",
        "A: Well, I used to go with my daughter together, and I go to Florida with my friends.\nThat\u2019s how far it\u2019s going.",
        "Q: Right. Did you ever make any trips to any part of Europe?",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t go back there, no.",
        "Q: Not any part?",
        "A: No. I hate those people, I don\u2019t want to see those faces.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. I think that\u2019s about it for any of my questions.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is there anything that we didn\u2019t talk about, or that you want to add?",
        "A: What can I add? I told you the whole story. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m here. I got a\nchance to make money, and build up a -- to have a nice place to live. I\u2019m still work, I like\nto work. I\u2019m very lucky to have two daughters, two children, you know? And\ngrandchildren, that\u2019s -- I\u2019m very lucky, which I never dream of that. We never dreamed\nthat we going to ever live freely. Every day I get up, and I says to myself, \u201cI can\u2019t believe\nit, I\u2019m free, that I can do whatever I want, I got what to eat.\u201d We always think about that,\nnever goes away.",
        "Q: You know one thing I was wondering about is --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- your story, and in fact, every other person I\u2019ve talked to --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- they talk so much about the food, and how there wasn\u2019t food, and if you got a\npotato, or an extra piece of bread, or something like that --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that was the life.",
        "Q: -- does that -- do you still have sort of a special --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I --",
        "Q: -- feeling about food?",
        "A: Yeah, I can\u2019t see people throw away food. That wi -- that hurts me terrible. Because\nthere\u2019s still people in the world what is starving now, still. No, I can never throw away\nfood. No, I -- I think I commit a crime if I throw out food, because I remember how\nhungry we was. We was only -- when we was in Auschwitz, we only have one pray in\nour life, to have a whole bread, and cut as much as we want. We didn\u2019t think about a -- a\nbed clean, our clothes, nothing exists in your head, only if to have a bread, and to cut as\nmuch as you wanted. Before the war finished, the German used to di-divided our bread\nfor four. Later, they didn\u2019t do that, they gave us small pumpernickel for 10, you got to\ndivide it for yourself. So a lot of groups fight over that, there was -- not mine group, mine\ngroup was very generous, and we made it every day somebody else will take the end of\nthe bread. But we got along, everybody took a little slice over 24 hour. But other people\nwas fighting, and killing each other. They making little scale, and try to weigh the bread,\nand this and that. We didn\u2019t do that. I was with my own people, with my own friends, so\nwe didn\u2019t do this.",
        "Q: So now you can eat as much as you want --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- anything you want.",
        "A: Now we\u2019re afraid to eat. You got cholesterol, you got this. Yeah, but I -- I can\u2019t see\nthrowing away food, no.",
        "Q: Mm. When you\u2019re --",
        "A: I always think about it, some people are still hungry in this world.",
        "Q: When you go to the grocery store, do you think about this?",
        "A: Yes, I buy -- I don\u2019t buy too much, because I don\u2019t want to throw away. I only buy a\nlittle, because it hurts me if I have to throw away food. I -- I couldn\u2019t do it. For six years,\nyou know, starving. Six years. Even one hour when a person is hungry is bad. When we\nwere standing by our selection, if you were skinny, you have no chance to live, the\nGerman hate skinny people. But the women got an idea to drink a lot of water, as a --\nhave a big stomach. So we fooled the Germans, oh you got a big stomach, you -- you still\nbe able to work. So we fooled them, we make our cheeks red, to look better, you know.\nWe tried to fool them this way.",
        "Q: Now, all the -- all the young people today, everybody wants to be skinny, everyone\nwants to be thin.",
        "A: Yeah, oh, yeah. Over there if you\u2019re skinny, even a man, in the man\u2019s camp, a skinny\nperson have no chance to survive, they hate skinny people. They gave them a name,\nmusselman, that\u2019s a -- musselman, the -- you\u2019re skinny, you have no right to live. And I\nwas chubby, that saved my life, too. I was always chubby. You know, Europe, you give\nthe kids to eat. If you\u2019re skinny they thought you are handicapped. So every mother\npushed the food to her kids.",
        "Q: I believe you said earlier -- you mentioned having grandchildren?",
        "A: Yeah, I have four grandchildren. Each girl --",
        "Q: How -- how old are they, what are their names?",
        "A: Oh, oh. My oldest is Jennifer, she one more year at college to finish. The boy going to\nbe 16 the 27\" of June, he\u2019s a high school. My other daughter have a girl, she\u2019s going 16,\nand 13, going to have a Bar Mitzvah in October. I\u2019ve got four grandchildren, yeah.",
        "Q: And their names?",
        "A: Their name? Jennifer from this daughter, and Bradley the other name, and Alila, and\nCammy. Yeah, they\u2019re the four grandchildren, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Well, I think that\u2019s about it for my questions, if [indecipherable] any --",
        "A: Yeah, I went to Israel for the Bar Mitzvah -- for the Bas Mitzvah, twice.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: We went with my daughter to Israel for that, yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m very devoted to Israel. I\nwould do anything for Israel.",
        "Q: Okay, well if there\u2019s nothing else you want to add --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- then I guess that\u2019s it.",
        "A: One of my cousins, she die here -- on the way to Japan, you know. But she die here in\nthe war. So he left me 2,000 dollars. So I gave thousand dollars for Israel for scholarship,\nand thousand dollars for the museum. They need it more than I do.",

        "Q: My pleasure.",
        "A: I -- I not too many time talk about these things.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: No, never, I never really talk about it. Sometime w-we get together with my friends,\nwe talk a little bit about it, and sometimes some of them don\u2019t want to even hear about it,\n\u201cOy, you make me sick, please don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d",
        "Q: So, well we\u2019ve been talking about it for almost two hours.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So how\u2019s that make you feel now, do you feel better somehow, or --",
        "A: No, I feel better that it\u2019s going to be on paper, and it\u2019s going to be a document for the\nfuture generation. So that\u2019s how it makes me feel good. I don\u2019t mind how many times I\nget interviewed, really. That doesn\u2019t bother me. You know, a lot of people -- of my friend\ncan\u2019t talk, they get very sick, they don\u2019t want to hear about it. They have heart trouble\nhere, they have high blood pressure, they didn\u2019t want to be interview at all. I couldn\u2019t\nconvince them, but most of them I did convince, yeah. It\u2019s very hard for some people to\ntalk, you know, it\u2019s very hard. Maybe I am strong in my nature, you know? But --",
        "Q: Well, you\u2019re not talking into the microphone.",

So if I see a film, they show\nsomething, I\u2019m very happy. I went to see a film last year, \u201cIn Our Hands,\u201d how the -- the\nIsraeli society and the English army, you know, but not on the Israeli [indecipherable]\nthat they shouldn\u2019t tell, but to the end, they raise up, and they says, \u201cWe going to fight\nour own flag.\u201d And then they mentioned how they took out the people from Poland, that\ngroup, but I was glad to see that, you know, a lot of people don\u2019t know about it. Some of\nthem don\u2019t know about it.",
        "Q: Which group are you talking about now\u201d?",
        "A: The Bricha, from Israel.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: A couple of my friends were the survivor Auschwitz, they brought them uniforms, and\nthey smuggled them into Israel after the war. They still there in Israel, yeah. They did a\nlot, whatever they could, you know? Actually, we very proud to have our own country in\nIsrael, and we should always support them. We see what\u2019s happened when we don\u2019t have\na country. Now Israel go to every corner of the world where Jewish are in trouble, they\ntake them out, they help them. We didn\u2019t have it bef -- before, in the second World War.\nNobody could help us.",

        "Q: -- did you know that, that no one was left but your brother?",
        "Q: And then, after the kibbutz, where did you go?",
        "Q: How did you meet your husband?",
        "Q: Did you -- this is a little bit of a funny question --",
        "Q: -- but, I mean, did you get married because he had papers, and he could get you to\nAmerica, or did you get married because you were in love?",
        "Q: Were you madly in love with him, or kind of in love with him, or --",
        "Q: So you said you -- you tried to be in love. Do you think that he felt the same way?\nThat --",
        "Q: Sounds like you were almost like creating -- like kind of creating instant families?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So then -- then you went over the mountains, right? That was -- that\u2019s when\nwe came out to Austria, to go out to the German border, in -- and Russia occupied\nVienna, you couldn\u2019t go out from Vienna, you have to sneak out, was very hard. Was a\nvery hard thing go -- it\u2019s really hard to believe it, how people manage like that.",
        "Q: Yes, yeah, I\u2019m --",
        "Q: When you think about these things now --",
        "Q: -- I mean, so many years have gone by, and you re -- you remember some of these\nthings --",
        "Q: -- does it seem kind of unbelievable to you?",
        "Q: When you did come over to the United States --",
        "Q: -- did you come on a boat?",
        "Q: Where did you leave from? Do you remember the name of the boat, or any of that?",
        "Q: What -- where did it leave from?",

        "Q: Do you know which group the -- the people who came and met you at the train station,\ndo you know what group they were connected with?",
        "Q: When you were taking that train ride, and when you got here, and all, I\u2019m wondering,\nhow did things look to you? Here you were in this totally different country, very different\nfrom where you\u2019d been.",
        "Q: Did it seem like a very strange place?",
        "Q: Were you happy to be in the United States?",
        "Q: And you -- you started to have children, when was that?",

        "Q: -- do you try to cover it up?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Do you -- and -- so, you were going around, it was visible, people were reacting to it?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t cover it up?",
        "Q: What -- as your children were growing up, wa -- did you talk with them much about\nwhat happened?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But at some point, did your children ever start to ask you questions?",
        "Q: What about when they got to be older, like when they were teenagers, or even --",
        "Q: So you wanted them to find out about it the way any young person in this country\nwould find out, in history class --",
        "Q: -- or by reading, or by seeing a movie?",
        "Q: But you know, that\u2019s kind of distant. I mean, you pick up a book and read, it\u2019s a little\nbit abstract.",

She pulled a pia to make a piece of bread, and she right away with a shrapnel.\nSo, we decided to leave Germany, we went back to Poland. That was a mistake, because\nin Poland were very bad.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Which camp I was? Beside the ghetto, in the camp, I was in Birkenau, in Auschwitz\nsince 1942, til 1945. But in the Dead March, when the Russian was behind, we have to\nrun together with the Germans.",

        "A: You mean in Birkenau?",
        "A: Mm. When we came, we have to start to build the camp, because was just the electric\nwiring all around half. We haven\u2019t got no water, no nothing. It was like a lot of malaria, a\nlot of camp -- a lot of sickness, because was -- they make the camp from a farm, so we\nhardly could work, it was still [indecipherable], the ground. And I was there til 1945, in\nthe same camp, very close to the crematorium, just a couple steps away.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t know nothing about it. If they find a pencil, or a piece of paper on\nsomebody, right away they hang the person. So, we didn\u2019t know nothing wi -- but we saw\nthe planes running above, but we didn\u2019t know nothing of what\u2019s going on. That -- that\u2019s\nthe way it was, until we came to Germany, we realized that the war was coming to an\nend. It\u2019s going to take -- but every day, people were dying anyway, from hunger. Every\nminute, actually.",
        "A: What did we see? Because the German starts to go away from Poland, from the\ncamps, and come closer to Germany, over there, in the other camp. There was no place\nanyway, to run anyway, because all the camp was fu -- filled. So we was tha -- we didn\u2019t\neven know when the war finished, because I tell you how we find out. Near us was\n[indecipherable] from pilots, where the Germans shot down. French pilot, English pilot.\nWe didn\u2019t speak English, but they cut the wires, and they told us we are free, because the\nGerman ran away from the camp, they locked up, and we didn\u2019t know the war was over,\neither, but we understood what\u2019s happened. They went out, and we went out, and we\nstarted to run to the houses to get some food. But all the houses was empty, not with\nfood, with people, because they were sure when we came out 1n the camp, they going to\nkill them. So they just -- they left all the -- in the whole city was empty houses, th-the\nGermans run away.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Over there was not electric wires.",
        "A: Not in this -- in Auschwitz was electric wires, not over there. They told us that we\nstart to run for food, that\u2019s the first thing, whatever we saw, sugar on a wagon, any --\nanything what we could eat, we started to eat, because for six years we were starving to\ndeath, really.",
        "A: Yeah. We --",
        "A: Yes, we -- we was -- we was happy the war -- the war was an end, but we wasn\u2019t\nhappy, we lost everybody. But we didn\u2019t know what to do, actually. It -- 1t wasn\u2019t\norganized, nothing was organized, we just was running from one city to the other, and we\nwouldn\u2019t know what we going to do, where we going to end up. It wasn\u2019t yet order -- we\nmade a mistake, we went back to Poland, that was all. We couldn\u2019t go back to Germany\nlater. So a lot of people who stayed in Germany, they organized them, and they got help.\nWe didn\u2019t have any help in Poland. I came back to my city, and I went up to the\ngovernment to ask for help, we were 10 girls. So he gave us the key from the school,\nwhere we was finishing school, that building belonged to a Jewish family, but they --\nthey got killed. So I told them, \u201cHow about food?\u201d He said, \u201cNothing else. Just stay.\u201d So\nwe were sleeping on the floor, and we were starving, actually. We didn\u2019t have what to\neat. It was horrible. So, after a couple weeks, some people from my town came back to\nthe city, and he told us that we shouldn\u2019t stay there, because they already killed four girls\nthat went in -- in a hiding place there. The Armia kryova went in, they killed them, and\none was hiding under the bedsheet in Israel, they tried to kill them. So the -- the life was\nvery danger in Poland. So he says, \u201cDon\u2019t stay in that city, you\u2019re going to be caught --\nkilled. You better come to Lodz, to a big city there are kibbutzim there, they\u2019ll take you\nin.\u201d So we were happy to have [indecipherable] had, and a piece of bread. You could\nonly stay six months. We have to smuggle ourselves to Israel. So I -- I knew I had a\nbrother in Russia, I was already in contact with him, so I didn\u2019t want to go, I want to\nwait. So they send me to another kibbutz, in Bialystok, to stay another six month. We\nstood there a couple months, in this -- and these, the Polish people was very angry, they\ndidn\u2019t want the Jews back. So one night they came in, the police, and they give us\nammunition, they going to attack us, going to be a pogrom, you have to defend yourself,\nwe can do nothing about it. So five people went to [indecipherable] on the train. We tried\nto pull out from Bialystok. Four of them got killed, they took them down from the train,\n18 - 19 year old. What -- Hitler let them live, but the Polish wouldn\u2019t let them live. One\nwas hiding under a pleated skirt by a lady in the train, so he survived. So he crawled\nback, and he told us to pick up the bodies. So, when I saw that, in time my brother came\nin, so I pick up my brother, and I says, \u201cI\u2019m not staying here. I\u2019m going to\n[indecipherable] right here the Bricha taking out the people,\u201d because they says it\u2019s a\ngraveyard in Poland.. When we went out on the street, and we saw dead people, dead\nJews, they wasn\u2019t missed by nobody, their families was killed a couple years ago in the\ncamps, and they came back from Russia. So they got killed in Poland. So I took my\nbrother, and I went on the train. We sitting on the train, and a Polish woman says to me,\n\u201cYou know, they took down yesterday, Jews, and they killed them.\u201d Like she gave me\nthe idea that I\u2019m going to be killed too, in a couple hours. So I almost fainted. Finally, we\nreach Vulsa -- we came into Vulsa, I fainted. I couldn\u2019t take it any longer. So I find out\nthat the Bricha organized people -- actually, they organized people who came back from\nRussia. Russia let in a half a million Jews. So the older people -- so I got together with\nthem, and we start to go -- the Jewish agency made up with American government that\nCzechoslovaki should let us in, out from Poland. It was like a couple thousand people. I\nwas the only one with a number, actually. So, we went to Czechoslovakia. In\nCzechoslovakia we stood overnight, and we have to go to Austria, and they prepare\ncamps for us. We came to Austria, a few thousand people. The people who should\nprovide us with bread, sold the flour, and we didn\u2019t have nothing to eat, we have to run in\nthe field to dig out a potato -- a pickle, to eat. That was after the war, in 1946. In time, I\nmet my husband, because he had a couple brothers in Russia, in the army. So he told the\nRussian people coming back from Russia, maybe one of his brothers will survive. None\nof them survived, they all got killed. So I met my husband, so he says to me, \u201cHow\ncomes a number\u2019? It\u2019s mostly people with the Russian.\u201d So I told him I was waiting for\nmy brother, he\u2019Il -- til he came back from Russia, and together I decided to leave Poland.\nWe have our chance, the Bricha -- thanks to the Bricha. So my husband told me that he\ngot papers to go to the United States in a month, a cousin sent him papers. But if I marry,\ntwo people can go on the same certificate. I didn\u2019t even know my husband, to be honest\nwith you. I decided, what do I got to leave? Israel is closed the doors, you couldn\u2019t go to\nIsrael anyway, we have to smuggle ourselves. The people who went there, went to\nCyprus, you know. I didn\u2019t have where to go, I was hungry. My husband, when he was\nliberated, he didn\u2019t live this town. So the UNRRA gave him -- put him in a hotel, and\nthey gave him three meals a day. So when I came in, I see this [indecipherable] table,\nwith white tablecloth, and eating. I couldn\u2019t believe it, that\u2019s a dream. So I decided I got\nmarried, only the condition my brother should stay with us. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\nFrom that month, turn into two years. They didn\u2019t let into the United State, they\u2019re going\nto elect a president, it took two year. So, a very hard time in Austria. We couldn\u2019t work,\nwe have to live on a ration, [indecipherable] gave us. A herring, a piece of bread, and\nthat\u2019s how we lived for two year. Finally, we find out, in order to go to America, we have\nto go to Vienna. Vienna was occupied by the Russian. So we got ourselves on that train,\nand we start to go. The Russian soldier came out, and he says, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t go there.\u201d\nSo he took us down from the train. So we was waiting for another train, and we came to\nVienna, on the boat, on Vienna. Now, we have to go out from Vienna to Germany, with\nour paper. Rush -- Vienna was occupied by the Russian, so we couldn\u2019t go. So we were\nstanding, they tore us down from the other train, and they told us, \u201cYou got to live here,\nyou got to vote here, and die here. You can never go out from here.\u201d We were like 10\npeople. So, we standing at night, and thinking what we going to do, til a -- a German guy,\na young guy came over to us, and he says to us, like that, \u201cYou know, my father takes\npeople over the border. If you want to go, you give me a few dollars, til -- Pll take you,\nshow how to go over the mountain.\u201d If I see the mountain during the day, I wouldn\u2019t\nclimb up. So we took -- I said, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be if he catch you?\u201d The Russian is out -\n- downstairs, you could see they working with the car. He says, \u201cWell, I tell him my cow\ngot lost, and I went to look for the cow.\u201d He got us over the mountain, we stay overnight,\nbut how we got down from the mountain, the very high mountain, I figured maybe I lay\ndown [indecipherable] they had a hard time to get down. We came down, finally, from\nthe mountain, we didn\u2019t carry anything. We came down from the mountain, we already\non the other side, in Germany. In Germany, you can\u2019t go in a hotel at night, everything is\nclosed. And it\u2019s raining, we don\u2019t have a place where to go. While we was walking, I\nwalk over -- a man was walking with a lady, and I says to him, \u201cWhat -- we just came\nfrom the other side, and it\u2019s raining. Where can we go?\u201d So he says to us, \u201cCome on, I'll\ntake you to a hotel, maybe they\u2019ll let you in.\u201d So we thank him, we came in the hotel, and\nthe guy said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, no room.\u201d I says to him, \u201cListen, I don\u2019t care what you see, I\u2019m\ngoing to sit here in the lobby, I\u2019m not going out in the rain. No way I\u2019m going out. We\ndon\u2019t -- we just came in, and we have no place else to go.\u201d So he gave us a room, and we\nstood there. Once we got there, we went to Bremen, in Germany, and we have to wait\nlike five weeks til we can go to America. The problem is, people who came to the Joint,\ngot it good. They greet them by the plane. They gave them -- they pay six months rent,\nthey gave them a job. We didn\u2019t came through the Joint. My husband\u2019s cousin was a\nreligious man, he wants to show in the shul he do something, so he borrowed the paper\nfor somebody else, so they was not responsible for us. So, we came he -- we came to\nBoston. From Boston we have to take a train to Chicago. Nobody waits for us, we didn\u2019t\nknow any langu -- English, nothing. So we sitting in the Union Station, and in the\nmorning -- a whole night -- in the morning, I hear Polish women, speaks Polish to each\nother. They come to clean -- and I finished school in Poland. So I walked up and tell them\nthe story there. Nobody waits for us, where should we go, what should we do? So they\npick up a telephone book, I gave them the address and the telephone, and they called the\npeople, and they picked us up. They picked us up, then we came to Chicago. I came to\nthe HIAS, and told them the story, they said, \u201cWe\u2019re not responsible for you, you can\u2019t --\nwe don\u2019t want to do nothing, not even a job.\u201d Luckily, I find here a friend, he took me\ninto the factory to work. I was two days in this country, I went to work. And I didn\u2019t even\nhave money for the car fare, a dime, so he paid the car fare. And I went there, I got a job.\nMy husband didn\u2019t get a job right away. We went through a very hard time in Chicago,\nwe couldn\u2019t get a -- a place there to live. We stayed with them three, four weeks, so\nfinally they rented a room for us. The lady put in, in a closet, she put in a bed, in a walk-\nin closet. There was no heat, where to put a chair. That\u2019s wasn\u2019t a -- that wasn\u2019t the worst\nthing. She got three teenage girls, we couldn\u2019t use a washroom in the morning, and I have\nto run downtown to punch a card. So I washed my face in the kitchen, and I ran for work.\nI worked a couple of years downtown, til -- til finally we got another apartment, you\nknow, just rented. If you was lucky, just rented an apartment, by somebody, not on our\nown. So finally, my husband couldn\u2019t get a job, so somebody recommended the\n[indecipherable] work he does, a lot of Jewish and Polish people open up a cleaning\nstore. For that you don\u2019t need money. You take an empty store, you buy an old sewing\nmachine. I still didn\u2019t give up my job. So I worked there, we open up the cleaning store,\nmy husband was in the cleaning store, and that\u2019s the work, I came to work in the store,\nand I worked til 12 at night to keep up the thing. Next couple years, and I already have a\nlittle money in the bank saved up, and I have the children. You know, it was very hard,\nthe beginning, we don\u2019t have help from nobody. Mostly refugees come, they have a lot of\nhelp. The Joint pay the rent, they -- they get them a job, they watch over them. I didn\u2019t\nhave that luck, so the same thing after the war, people stay in Germany, the -- right away\nthere was organized camp, they got what to eat. We was on the bad side, we was in\nPoland, we couldn\u2019t go back, the Russian didn\u2019t let us go to the border. So, we live hard\ntimes.",

        "A: The first minute, we thum to run for food, nothing else existed, just food. I ran up and\nI -- I went up on a wagon, started to eat a lot of sugar. Anything what we saw, we started\nto eat, we were so hungry. Most people got sick from it, because the stomach was so\nshrink, we couldn\u2019t even eat, but -- but people were so hungry, they though they\u2019 ll eat the\nwhole world, would be enough food. That\u2019s how they started to eat. And the German got\nplenty of food in the house, mind you. For 10 years, they storing food for 10 years. So\neach time we went in a different house, and -- and we ate there, you know.",
        "A: Yeah. They all left, they run away. Near our camp, you couldn\u2019t find a house that\nGermans should be occupied there. They were sure that we going to kill them when we\ngo out.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t, they wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: Well, I would like to, but I -- I couldn\u2019t do it, no. I tell you what\u2019s happened. There\nwas, near [indecipherable] time, was a lot of soldiers, and there was -- and when -- and a\nlot of raping going on, too. So when we went into the house, came in a Russian officer,\nIll never forget, a very intelligent man. And he says, \u201cThey let out from the jails, the\nworst thing, and they rape the woman. I\u2019m going to sit the whole night and watch you.\n[indecipherable] I can do nothing about it,\u201d he told us. So that\u2019s what -- he was sitting a\nwhole night, and they start to knock in the door, and then, when they saw him, they run\naway. Then we went a little further, and the same thing happened. So we made up -- the\ngirls, we were 10 girls, we made up, if they knock on the door, we run out in the back\ndoor, and there was a lot of broken trains, so every girl was laying under a train the whole\nnight, cause train didn\u2019t move, they was broken. And we was laying a whole night, and\nthere was [indecipherable] got in the house. A whole night that we were laying there til\nit\u2019s got light, then we -- we came out from the -- under the trains, and we start to look to\ngo any further. There was a big struggle after the war, a big struggle. Was no\ngovernment, was no nothing.",
        "A: All by ourself.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t go back, we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t go back. You know, in a room like that,\nhalf the size, was maybe a hundred girls. We was laying down, there was no room to turn\nover, that\u2019s how it was. We didn\u2019t go back. We went in the houses, we took some clothes.\nSo then, we went on a train, the train was standing [indecipherable] going. We took some\nclothes for ourself, we went on the train. The train was standing all night. So a Russian\nfella came in, and he says, \u201cOh, girls are here, okay, we going to bring my friend.\u201d So we\nran out from the train, and we wait there, the train left with all our stuff, we have to go\nlook for other stuff. We didn\u2019t want to go back to that train. Was a big struggle after the\nwar, with no government, no [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: On our own. Nobody could help us. As a matter of fact, we saw our -- our German\nguard with a wagon, with horses. So we walked over, he should give us the wagon. He\nsays no. So we went to a Russian fellow, and officer, we told him we want the wagon to\ngo away from the camp. So he took the German by the head, and threw him in the -- in\nthe ground, he says, \u201cYou take whatever you want, you\u2019re entitled, and go ahead.\u201d One of\nmy girls knew how to operate a wagon with [indecipherable]. See, we tried to go any\nforwarder and forwarder, til we got to Poland, and then we have to leave everything\nbehind, because they -- they -- they checked us up. We didn\u2019t have any money anyway,\nbut was free -- traveling was free, people didn\u2019t have anything. I mean, Poland was our\ngraveyard, it was impossible to be there, they killed 50 people in Kelts. That\u2019s the people\nwho lived through the war, they came from Russia with children, they killed them all.\nWhatever they find a Jew, they killed him.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know -- we didn\u2019t -- that we should go. We just didn\u2019t want to be in\nGermany, so we tried to go back in Poland. It was a mistake. We didn\u2019t know they going\nto organize. We didn\u2019t know what to do actually, where to go. Finally I went to -- back to\nPoland, and some people took back property, you know -- that we went back. There was\nno way to go back without an organization to take care of you.",
        "A: Armia kryova, yes.",
        "A: That was -- that were like a underground Polish army. They was for one thing, just to\nkill the Jews, that was their idea. They killed four girls right near our town, in a little\ntown.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know if they was fighting, but that was the -- after the war, that was after\nthe war.",
        "A: Maybe they was, but I don\u2019t think so -- that they did. Only the Poles would fight after\nthe -- the German -- [indecipherable] the Russian, they organized themself, but not the\nother, not the others. But Jewish people was fighting in the ghettos all over, a lot of\npeople don\u2019t even know about that. In Bialystok, 70 people -- I went -- went there --\ncame there to find a grave, 70 people were fighting, girls and boys was fighting against\nthe German.",
        "A: That was in Birkenau, yes. One of my girlfriends, she -- they hanged the four girl. See,\nthe woman [indecipherable] ammunition, and when the men came into work in the camp,\nthey gave him the ammunition, you know, little. Well, when the uprising was there, I\nthought when they -- they killed a couple Germans, they put them in the oven, they did\nwhatever they could. But, in a few minutes later, you couldn\u2019t see the sky, that\u2019s how\nmany airplanes [indecipherable] German. And the German wants to find out how did the\npeople organize themselve, and to kill so many Germans, and all this thing. Well, they\nran across one girl, but she broke down -- not mine girlfriend, from my town, she broke\ndown and told them on three others. They arrested the girls, they kept them in a bunker.\nOne of my friend, she was typing whatever they say. They took her -- I don\u2019t know how\nyou call it, the strip?

        "A: The thing, yeah.",
        "A: A whip, yes, and they put in steel, and they beat them on the body, on the naked body,\nand a doctor was there to revive them, so they can get out of them. Mine girlfriend never\ntold anyone, and the four girls was hanged, right in the -- we have to stay and watch. This\nwas only four weeks before they evacuated from Auschwitz. Like in January, that\u2019s\n[indecipherable] they killed four girls, you know.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know. They couldn\u2019t kill that many, because some of them started to run,\nyou know, away, and they shot them down anyway. They kill mostly the Germans, but\nthe -- but the Sondercommando were working, you know. They -- they -- they killed\nthem, they put them in the oven, they did a lot of things, you know.

        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yes. That was their name, that was their main thing, to kill all the Jews. Jews lived\nthere 400 years, they have some property, and for them, the war was a plus, because they\ngot in in a minute -- lot of people was poor Polish, too. And they got in, they got\neverything. They didn\u2019t want a Jew -- if a Jew got in in a house, he didn\u2019t get out alive\nany more. So we don\u2019t even know how many was killed.

We didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t think of\nit. In po -- was very bad in Poland lately, after the war, you know what\u2019s happened in\nPoland. First of all, when we went [indecipherable] they told us the Polish, in the same\nage where we were, \u201cGo to Palestine, you don\u2019t belong in here. That\u2019s not your place.\u201d\nThat was one thing. We got up in the morning, we saw all kind of signs on th -- on the --\non the building, the J -- the Jews are Communists, the Jews are that and that. Then, after\nthat, they put down the -- they organized them in the churches. Every Pole who came in\nfor the village, have to wear a green band, and stay by the Jewish store, so when the other\npeople come in, they wouldn\u2019t let them in. You know, that\u2019s a Jewish store, you\u2019re not\nsupposed to go to the Jewish store. That was a open boycott in Poland. Even in the\n[indecipherable] asking what you going to do with the Jews, with three and a half million\nJews, which to build up Poland, 400 years, they say, beating up make no sense, but\nboycott them with the business, that\u2019s yes.

So, I was with mine\ngroup. Everybody got their own clique, like they say, because we couldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate. The others speak Greek, they speak French, they speak Italian. We\ncouldn\u2019t -- we couldn\u2019t understand. So they did the same thing, they grouped themself\nwith their own people, with the same language. That\u2019s the way it was.",

The selections were like that.\nBecause they couldn\u2019t bring a townsbut on the outside, like they got a note, 3,000 people\ngot to be killed. So, they took from the place that we were standing -- people only survive\nin the wa -- the last in the line. I came back to the barrack one Hanukah, 1943, yeah, I\ncame back, we were thousand 1n the -- in the barrack, only three came back. They count\nup, if they have enough, they they\u2019ll let the last go. Only three came back from thousand.\nAnd that -- each time there are selection, somebody ask you how you survive, I always\nsaid the same thing, I was the last in the line. That\u2019s the only way, not because we were\nsmart, or we was healthy, didn\u2019t matter. They have to burn so many people. And that was\neven worse, because the people when they came from a transport, they didn\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s going on, it was the night. But when they took the people from the camp, and we\nknow where they\u2019re going, that wasn\u2019t -- that was very sad.

So she says to -- to them, \u201c\u201cThere\u2019s -- the -- the -- the Jewish people\nthey should only drop dead, and they have such a nice home.\u201d They come here to clean.\nThey get money for it, pa -- clo -- that\u2019s the way they are.

The first time I went because somebody told me\nfor asthma it\u2019s good in Israel, so I went for a month to dry out, and somebody told me no,\nsomebody seek whatever you go. I went there three times already, yes, in Israel. But\nwhen I got married, in the paper it was for the United State, and we came here, and we\nstart to make a living, and then you have a family, then you can\u2019t pick yourself up and go.\nBut I was there three times for mine granddaughter\u2019s Bas Mitzvah, mine grandson\u2019s Bar\nMitzvah, we went there back, the last couple of years, yeah.",

        "A: Yeah, that -- that was our goal, but how many could go? One -- maybe one -- one\nfrom each town. That was our goal to go to Israel, that was we were dreaming about it.\nWe was real organized in that time. But I wasn\u2019t the youngest grou, and were older\npeople wi -- that did emigrate to Israel. So they make like two people can go on one\ncertificate if they got married, and they come to Israel, and they dissolve it. So, older\npeople did go, yeah, from mine town. But we didn\u2019t have a chance yet, you know. People\nwanted to go to Israel, but they wouldn\u2019t let us in. Remember Vivian from England?

        "A: No, I don\u2019t feel a regret, I tell you. I don\u2019t think I could take the climate there, it\u2019s very\nhot. When I was there about 25 years ago, I got very sick. I didn\u2019t know the climate, I\nwent in the summer. And I didn\u2019t thought I\u2019Il make it home alive, that\u2019s how sick. I could\nnot breathe.

Then they put us on top.\nBetween us was a doctor, he came from Germany, I think he got one artificial leg. They\nthrow him on the ground, and they step on his face with the boots.

The only thing 1s they open up a kitchen, the Jewish people open\nup a kitchen, give a little bit soup, everybody. We was begging the German, why don\u2019t\nyou kill us? He says, \u201cNo, we need the bullets on the front. You going to die ever --\nanyway.\u201d That was in the ghetto.

That\u2019s how it was.\nAnd then we find out when we came there, that\u2019s the -- the gas chamber is working day\nand night, for 24 hours. Day and night. You know, people were standing 1n the line, they\nbegged to go in already. No washrooms, winter, it\u2019s cold, children are crying, they beat\nyou up. They want to get over with it, already. They sing the Haptikvah, they know\nwhere they going, they see the flames, and a few minutes later, 1t will happen to them. So\npeople don\u2019t understand all these things.

They didn\u2019t have a lesson.\nThis -- and a lot of them got big government jobs, but they were in -- in the Gestapo, and\nthey change their name, they got bi-big jobs there. How can you trust these people? I\nwould never trust them. They -- they came in, a German, to my house, we weren\u2019t rich.\nHe told me to open up the drawers, he want to take away everything. I says, here is, take\nthis, take this, take -- he says, \u201cNo. Where did you -- where did you stack your better\nstuff?\u201d I said we were not rich, we didn\u2019t have any better stuff. So he says, \u201cYou know, I\nwas here in the first World War. They chased us out in this country, but this time we\nstaying here forever.\u201d That\u2019s how -- they was sure of themself. They occupied whole\nEurope. That\u2019s how [indecipherable] that was a man maybe 60 years old. He was in the\nfirst World War, they were sure, they were so hypnotized they were going to -- they\ngoing to counter the whole world.",

        "A: Well, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m in this country, and I could build a life, and live a better life. I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m happy for that, that I could do it, you know? Most of the people did it.\n[indecipherable] they know they can\u2019t depend on nobody, and they have to pick themself\nup, on straps like they say, and do it on their own, and this country give you an\nopportunity for that. So I\u2019m very grateful for that, yeah.",
        "A: No, it takes five years. I didn\u2019t know the language then. We have to -- we went to\nnight school, we went to school, we learned the language. Five years later we became\ncitizens, yeah.",
        "A: Oh. Oh yes, we -- we organized ourself. We got organizations in the newcomers.\nYeah, I was -- last week -- I\u2019m going next week to the -- how you call it, the new citizen -\n- we call it the new citizen, B\u2019nai Brith, the -- all this, have meeting once a month, if you\n-- | always attend those meetings, we always go there. We organized themselves, yeah,\nall the time. We stay together, like the refugees stay together all the time, yeah.",
        "A: Well, my parents was very religious, I was more progressive. I belonged to a Zionist\norganization, they called the Shemiratsier. They was not that religious. Traditional, but\nnot religious, not like that. Like, you couldn\u2019t take a pencil, write on Saturday, or do\nthings like that, ride a bike. We did it, we did those things, yeah. But in they -- in the\nsame time, the older peoples in the organization was well educated, so they teach us, we\ngot courses, all kind of courses, book reviews. Was very interesting, yeah.",
        "A: No, I di -- I --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t like it, they didn\u2019t like it, but we did our own way, yeah. They didn\u2019t like\nit, but in the house we were religious, I didn\u2019t do nothing t -- against them. But when we\nwent out with the group, or we ride a bike, they didn\u2019t know about it.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, it did change, but I want to tell you something. We didn\u2019t believe in God when\nwe was in Auschwitz, when we saw what\u2019s going on, but when I come to this country,\nand I have children, you sti -- you have to hang up the little tradition. It gives you a little,\nyou know, there a lot of things what\u2019s going bad in life. There are sickness, all -- you\nhave to hang up with something. So I decided we should hang up to something, and\nbelieve in God. It\u2019s a little bit easier, the life 1s easier. But you get very sick, oy God\nshould I get bet -- should I get better, maybe I'll get out of it. So you always mention that.\nBut deep in hearts, people didn\u2019t believe it, no.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Yeah, before yeah, but not after that, when I saw, no. No, nobody believed in there.",
        "A: Because we couldn\u2019t see the young [indecipherable] the young kids, and crying, and\npeople go to the gas chamber. That\u2019s wasn\u2019t -- there 1s something could control that, you\nknow what I mean? The Germans used to tease us, \u201c\u201cYou see what we have on our\nbuckle? God is with us, not with you.\u201d That\u2019s what they told us. And when the airplanes\nstart to circle in Auschwitz, and we was looking, they said, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\n12 -- 12 -- 12 o\u2019clock, the world will be -- all be -- you\u2019ll be killed 15 minute before 12.\nThat was their intention to do. If the world wouldn\u2019t come to an end, another year or two,\nnobody would survive, no way. How long can you starve like that?",
        "A: No, that\u2019s something --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s was mine idea.",
        "A: Well, yes. Maybe, maybe yes. I wanted the kids to have a traditions. I f -- I felt the\nholidays and everything, just like my parents did, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Now I believe it, yes, now I believe it, even though in that time I didn\u2019t. When you see\nbad things happen, you don\u2019t believe. Then you change your mind, maybe there 1s\nsomething, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what we ask, our questions, all the time. Even the religious people in the\ncamp, women, they were very religious. But now, when I come to Florida, and I sit on the\nbench near the ocean, and I see a lot of men with long beards, with numbers, they very\nreligious, and they suffered during the war, but they very religious now. They said,\n\u201cThanks God I wasn\u2019t a German, I didn\u2019t have too good a job.\u201d That\u2019s what they tell me.\nBecause I talk to -- when I see a number, I go over, talk to them. [indecipherable] this\nthing. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t think so. Did -- people didn\u2019t foresee that. There was a lot of young\nmen, if they knew what\u2019s coming, they would do something, they would go in the woods,\nand run. Nobody forseed it, because the Germans was lying to us. They told us we just\ngoing to take -- take another place for war. They was lying. Then they open up atellager\nin Auschwitz, or they took in kids like in a kindergarten, and all the thing -- they promise\nthem all in the world, you see, if the Red Cross come, we have kids here, we have good --\neverything was covered up, like in Theresienstadt, too. And then they took the people to -\n- to -- the -- the people was fighting [indecipherable] bare naked. They says, \u201cYou\npromised us, we [indecipherable] why you do it to us?\u201d So they was beaten up over the\nhead. They didn\u2019t have it what to fight. That was before the Russians came in, took away\nthose people.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. A lot of people I know, from mine town, intelligent people, they belong to\na Socialist organization before the war, they came to Auschwitz, and they went to the\nelectric wire. They said, \u201cIn a world like that, we don\u2019t have to live. It\u2019s no use. Doesn\u2019t\npay to live in a world like that, we all going to be killed anyway.\u201d And they were big\norganizers, bele -- believe in Socialism and all these things. Very intelligent people, and\nthat\u2019s what they did.",
        "A: Yeah, that -- I was in Bialystok, yeah. That\u2019s where the police brought us, and\nammunition, I have to learn how to use a gun to defend ourself, because he told us it\u2019s\ngoing to be a pogrom there. And you know why, they told us. A lot of women put their\nbabies to Polish families. Let\u2019s say a brother, a nephew, survived the war in Russia, they\ncame back for the child, the child was already five, six years old, the child didn\u2019t want to\ngo. So they steal the kids out. They came in the uniform, and they took them by force, to\nthe German border, into Israel. So they decided the people killed their kids, to have blood\nfor matzos at Passover. They right away have an excuse, you know. And that\u2019s when they\nbrought in ammunition, we should defend -- we can do nothing, it\u2019s going to be a pogrom\nhere. That\u2019s when I took my brother, went to Warsaw, and I know that the Bricha is\nwaiting for the people, to take them across the border.",
        "A: Yeah, then they come after us, too. Little by little, they all left. There was no place to\nstay there now, any more.",
        "A: The life was in danger.",
        "A: Well, I used to go with my daughter together, and I go to Florida with my friends.\nThat\u2019s how far it\u2019s going.",
        "A: No, I wouldn\u2019t go back there, no.",
        "A: No. I hate those people, I don\u2019t want to see those faces.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What can I add? I told you the whole story. I\u2019m -- I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m here. I got a\nchance to make money, and build up a -- to have a nice place to live. I\u2019m still work, I like\nto work. I\u2019m very lucky to have two daughters, two children, you know? And\ngrandchildren, that\u2019s -- I\u2019m very lucky, which I never dream of that. We never dreamed\nthat we going to ever live freely. Every day I get up, and I says to myself, \u201cI can\u2019t believe\nit, I\u2019m free, that I can do whatever I want, I got what to eat.\u201d We always think about that,\nnever goes away.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, that was the life.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I --",
        "A: Yeah, I can\u2019t see people throw away food. That wi -- that hurts me terrible. Because\nthere\u2019s still people in the world what is starving now, still. No, I can never throw away\nfood. No, I -- I think I commit a crime if I throw out food, because I remember how\nhungry we was. We was only -- when we was in Auschwitz, we only have one pray in\nour life, to have a whole bread, and cut as much as we want. We didn\u2019t think about a -- a\nbed clean, our clothes, nothing exists in your head, only if to have a bread, and to cut as\nmuch as you wanted. Before the war finished, the German used to di-divided our bread\nfor four. Later, they didn\u2019t do that, they gave us small pumpernickel for 10, you got to\ndivide it for yourself. So a lot of groups fight over that, there was -- not mine group, mine\ngroup was very generous, and we made it every day somebody else will take the end of\nthe bread. But we got along, everybody took a little slice over 24 hour. But other people\nwas fighting, and killing each other. They making little scale, and try to weigh the bread,\nand this and that. We didn\u2019t do that. I was with my own people, with my own friends, so\nwe didn\u2019t do this.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Now we\u2019re afraid to eat. You got cholesterol, you got this. Yeah, but I -- I can\u2019t see\nthrowing away food, no.",
        "A: I always think about it, some people are still hungry in this world.",
        "A: Yes, I buy -- I don\u2019t buy too much, because I don\u2019t want to throw away. I only buy a\nlittle, because it hurts me if I have to throw away food. I -- I couldn\u2019t do it. For six years,\nyou know, starving. Six years. Even one hour when a person is hungry is bad. When we\nwere standing by our selection, if you were skinny, you have no chance to live, the\nGerman hate skinny people. But the women got an idea to drink a lot of water, as a --\nhave a big stomach. So we fooled the Germans, oh you got a big stomach, you -- you still\nbe able to work. So we fooled them, we make our cheeks red, to look better, you know.\nWe tried to fool them this way.",
        "A: Yeah, oh, yeah. Over there if you\u2019re skinny, even a man, in the man\u2019s camp, a skinny\nperson have no chance to survive, they hate skinny people. They gave them a name,\nmusselman, that\u2019s a -- musselman, the -- you\u2019re skinny, you have no right to live. And I\nwas chubby, that saved my life, too. I was always chubby. You know, Europe, you give\nthe kids to eat. If you\u2019re skinny they thought you are handicapped. So every mother\npushed the food to her kids.",
        "A: Yeah, I have four grandchildren. Each girl --",
        "A: Oh, oh. My oldest is Jennifer, she one more year at college to finish. The boy going to\nbe 16 the 27\" of June, he\u2019s a high school. My other daughter have a girl, she\u2019s going 16,\nand 13, going to have a Bar Mitzvah in October. I\u2019ve got four grandchildren, yeah.",
        "A: Their name? Jennifer from this daughter, and Bradley the other name, and Alila, and\nCammy. Yeah, they\u2019re the four grandchildren, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, I went to Israel for the Bar Mitzvah -- for the Bas Mitzvah, twice.",
        "A: We went with my daughter to Israel for that, yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m very devoted to Israel. I\nwould do anything for Israel.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: One of my cousins, she die here -- on the way to Japan, you know. But she die here in\nthe war. So he left me 2,000 dollars. So I gave thousand dollars for Israel for scholarship,\nand thousand dollars for the museum. They need it more than I do.",
        "A: Yes, thank you for interviewing me, yeah.",
        "A: I -- I not too many time talk about these things.",
        "A: No, never, I never really talk about it. Sometime w-we get together with my friends,\nwe talk a little bit about it, and sometimes some of them don\u2019t want to even hear about it,\n\u201cOy, you make me sick, please don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I feel better that it\u2019s going to be on paper, and it\u2019s going to be a document for the\nfuture generation. So that\u2019s how it makes me feel good. I don\u2019t mind how many times I\nget interviewed, really. That doesn\u2019t bother me. You know, a lot of people -- of my friend\ncan\u2019t talk, they get very sick, they don\u2019t want to hear about it. They have heart trouble\nhere, they have high blood pressure, they didn\u2019t want to be interview at all. I couldn\u2019t\nconvince them, but most of them I did convince, yeah. It\u2019s very hard for some people to\ntalk, you know, it\u2019s very hard. Maybe I am strong in my nature, you know? But --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. So I\u2019m mar -- I talk about it, you know, if I have a chance, but my friends,\na lot of them get sick, they don\u2019t want to hear about it. So if I see a film, they show\nsomething, I\u2019m very happy. I went to see a film last year, \u201cIn Our Hands,\u201d how the -- the\nIsraeli society and the English army, you know, but not on the Israeli [indecipherable]\nthat they shouldn\u2019t tell, but to the end, they raise up, and they says, \u201cWe going to fight\nour own flag.\u201d And then they mentioned how they took out the people from Poland, that\ngroup, but I was glad to see that, you know, a lot of people don\u2019t know about it. Some of\nthem don\u2019t know about it.",
        "A: The Bricha, from Israel.",
        "A: A couple of my friends were the survivor Auschwitz, they brought them uniforms, and\nthey smuggled them into Israel after the war. They still there in Israel, yeah. They did a\nlot, whatever they could, you know? Actually, we very proud to have our own country in\nIsrael, and we should always support them. We see what\u2019s happened when we don\u2019t have\na country. Now Israel go to every corner of the world where Jewish are in trouble, they\ntake them out, they help them. We didn\u2019t have it bef -- before, in the second World War.\nNobody could help us.",
