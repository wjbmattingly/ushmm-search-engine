        "Q: Today is June 12, 1992. I am here with Mrs. Miki Pear of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and she\nis here at the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum today to tell her story of the\nHolocaust. Good afternoon.",
        "A: I was born in Warsaw, Poland on May 14, 1935. My father was a violinist and a professor of\nmusic. My mother came from a very large family -- my father was an only child as far as I\nknow. He had a tiny family. My mother came from an enormous and very well known family\nin Warsaw, a very prominent family. My grandfather had a soda, carbonated beverage\nmanufacturing family.",
        "Q: On your mother\u2019s side?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s side. I don\u2019t know very much about my father\u2019s side. I know only that he came\nfrom a family of intellectuals, professors, linguists and I don\u2019t know what all. I do remember\nhis parents. I remember meeting them once. I remember going to their home, I remember the\nroom that I was in. I remember that there was a red oriental rug, very highly patterned,\nintricately patterned and the walls were lined with books.. That was very impressive because\nfirst of all, I had never seen anything quite like it and second of all because my father\u2019s parents,\nlike my father, were very short. They were even much shorter than my father was. I remember\nthat --the room so clearly because I remember thinking how do they reach those books which\nwent so high up. The ceilings in Europe were very high and I don\u2019t remember and I was very\nsmall.",
        "Q: Were you crawling on the rug?",
        "A: No, I was walking on the rug. I had to be four years at that point. I remember thinking how\ncould my grandfather who was so pale and delicate looking climb? There were ladders on each\nside of the room, which I guess must have been on wheels or however those things worked. But\nI remember imagining how could my grandfather who looked so frail and tiny reach those\nbooks. That\u2019s the impression that I have of my grandparents and I remember absolutely nothing\nelse about them nor do I know anything about them. Only that my father was an only child.\nHowever, my mother\u2019s side of the family, I remember very clearly. And they were exactly the\nopposite in every conceivable way. They were very loud and noisy and gregarious. My mother\nwas the youngest of eight siblings. There were nine originally, one died at a young age, maybe\nin childhood, I really don\u2019t know. But she was one of five daughters, she was the youngest, and\nthree sons. The oldest child was a daughter, the oldest child, my mother\u2019s sister, married a\nphysician who was her childhood sweetheart and they moved to Russia. This would have to\nhave been in the twenties. They had two daughters who I know became -- one became a\nmerchant ship captain, captain of a merchant ship and the other daughter, this would have been\nmy cousin, became, I believe, a physician. But that entire part of the family was lost to the\nother, to the rest of the family because they were in Russia. So I know nothing ...",
        "Q: Soviet citizens?",
        "A: --Soviet exactly. So I don\u2019t know any more about them but I imagine that these two cousins,\nanyway, who would probably be twenty or thirty years older than I am, might still be living. I\nimagine my cousin is a sea captain, provocative thought. Hopefully their descendents are living\nsomewhere in Russia and hopefully they\u2019re enjoying a peaceful life. The rest of the brothers and\nsisters -- all the sisters married and all of my mother\u2019s sisters, all four of my mother\u2019s sisters\nhad families of three or more children. And all of those families perished. Of the three\nbrothers, the oldest was banished to Siberia with his wife and child. He survived the war and it\nwas he who later found me where I was hidden in the Ukraine, where I survived. The other\ntwo brothers -- the middle brother escaped sometime during the first World War and the story\ngoes that he was, what\u2019s the word? ... He punched a senior in the jaw for some reason.",
        "Q: This is in the Russian army?",
        "A: In the Polish army. He was in the Polish cavalry. The Polish cavalry during the first World War\nwas kind of interesting because if you could afford your own boots, or at least this is what I am\ntold, if you could afford a fancy uniform with boots and so forth, you sort of automatically\nbecame an officer. If you could afford to bring your own horse, you became an officer in the\ncavalry. So he was a horseman and he had the means to afford all this grand stuff. So he was\nan officer in the Polish cavalry. He was quite rebellious and kind of a smart ass and apparently\nhe got into some, I don\u2019t know, fracas, and punched out a senior officer and they were going to\nshoot him for insubordination. He jumped over the wall, I don\u2019t know, I may be romanticizing\nthis. These are facts that I was told and eventually escaped and made his way to America where\nthere was some distant relative who took him under his wing. Morris Berliner, this middle\nuncle became in later years, the rich uncle in America. He\u2019s the one that we came to, he was\nour sponsor in the United States. The youngest of my three uncles who was just the next sibling\nto my mother, my mother was the younger and he was next; he was Martin Berliner. He and his\nbride -- he was a student in Paris -- he went to college there and became an engineer. He and\nhis new bride were fortunate enough to have come to the United States in 1939 on the last ship\nwhich was admitted into New York harbor. So he was a surprise to us when we arrived here\nbecause we had no idea of his whereabouts at all.",
        "Q: You had known him before you left?",
        "A: Possibly. I don\u2019t remember him at all.",
        "Q: Hard to keep track of all your uncles?",
        "A: Well. yeah. Also he was in Paris. He was a student in Paris. Although he was very close with\nmy mother because they were closest in age, I didn\u2019t know him. Or if I knew him, it would\nhave been only very casually, very briefly. But my uncle Jacob, the oldest was closest in the\nfamily to my mother. The two were each other\u2019s confidant, they were friends. They were\nfriends, socially. They just had a very close friendship even though they were a number of --\nquite a number of years apart, perhaps fifteen years apart. And he was her protector and he\nloved her a lot.",
        "Q: He had remained in Warsaw?",
        "A: Yes, he remained in Warsaw and he remained in my grandfather\u2019s business. He ran the finances\nof the business and apparently one of the reasons that he was so -- that he did that is because he\nwas so honest and so trustworthy and so forth. He was the kind of the controller and the\nbusiness head of the business. My grandfather was part inventor, entrepreneur and dreamer and\nmy grandfather ... For example, my grandfather was the first to introduce fresh fruit juice or\nsyrup to carbonated water. That juice was raspberry and he was at the beginning of creating\nfruit flavored soft drinks, sparkling soft drinks. The fledgling company which he called Fraise,\nthe French word for raspberries because that was the first fruit flavoring that he experimented\nwith, with his carbonated water.",
        "Q: Did you get to drink any?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember at all. I don\u2019t remember that at all. But I remember that life at my\ngrandparent\u2019s kind of revolved around the siphons. I remember their home -- I have wonderful\nmemories of my grandparents\u2019 home and here comes the lump in my throat. My grandparents\u2019\nhome was sort of on the outskirts of Warsaw. My uncle Martin, the youngest of the brothers,\nwas interviewed for a book, \u2018Voices of the Holocaust\u2019 and I believe, in that interview is the -- if\nnot the address, the location of, you know. I\u2019m not very good with the names and the places\nbecause I was so young. But that information is known. And apparently my grandfather, who\nwas extremely tall, unusually tall, he was the tallest member of the entire family. My\ngrandmother was quite small and she had beautiful blue eyes, she was the only one with blue\neyes. She had a beautiful singing voice which could have been operatic but she preferred just to\nshare her singing talents with her family. She was the family songbird. She sang all the time as\nshe cooked and so forth. My grandfather was extremely, highly respected in the community.\nHe was sort of the unofficial Jewish mayor of the area and was the ... He was the one who kind\nof communicated with the official government and the gentile community. He was the -- I can\u2019t\nthink of the word. Well, anyway \u2014",
        "Q: Community leader.",
        "A: Yes, exactly. Well, more than that, he was also kind of the wise man. People came to him for\nadvice and he settles disputes. He loaned people money. He was very loved and respected.",
        "Q: An elder statesman.",
        "A: He was truly that and looked the part too. He was a great big tall man with a white beard. Oh,\nand I have a wonderful photograph of them too, if your archives might be interested, of my\ngrandfather and grandmother. Oh,G__, They\u2019re gorgeous!",
        "Q: Was your family orthodox?",
        "A: I believe my grandparents were ...",
        "Q: On your mother\u2019s side?",
        "A: Yes, I know really nothing about my father\u2019s side. Everything I\u2019ve told you is everything I\nknow and there is no more. But my -- I think my grandparents were probably orthodox . I\ndon\u2019t know that but I think so. My grandmother also has a wonderful reputation. She took the\nteachings of the Torah rather literally in some respects. Every Friday and on every holiday, she\nwould go and collect beggars from the street and she would feed them in her kitchen. On the\nhigh holy days, she invited them to share our holiday meal in our dining room. I remember my\ngrandmother\u2019s dining which because she had eight children, all of whom were married and had\nchildren of their own; the table could seat I don\u2019t know how many people, maybe twenty. I\nremember the beautiful crystal chandelier which hung over it. I remember a little story of a\npeasant from the Ukraine who came to work as a sort of maid, or I don\u2019t know, helper, and my\ngrandmother told this servant to go and turn out the light in the dining room. When the servant\ndidn\u2019t reappear for a long time, my grandmother went to search and found this peasant standing\non top of the table trying to blow out the electric lights in the chandelier. So I remember little\nantidotal facts like that. Stop me from telling you these stories because it will take me forever.",
        "Q: What kind of home did you live in?",
        "A: Well my father was a teacher. He taught at one of the universities. I really am not sure which,\neither the University of Warsaw -- there were two universities, I believe. I think he might have\ntaught in the smaller of the two because there was great anti-Semitism at that time and difficulty\nwithin the university system. So he might not have taught in the Warsaw University but I\u2019m not\nreally sure. In any case, he also gave private lessons at home. My father was not successful in\nthe field of making money. He was kind of a disappointment and disgrace within the family\nbecause my mother\u2019s family was all very aggressive and very well to do. Everybody did\nexceedingly well and apparently they thought that that was very important and everyone was\ntalented in a different way but everyone was sort of well off. My mother was not. It was very\ndisappointing to the family that my mother married my father because she married him on the\nrebound. She had been in love with a local boy who apparently was a great Zionist and gave\nher the choice of -- or asked her to go with him to build Palestine. When she refused to leave\nthe family nest and go to such a faraway place, he left without her. I\u2019ve often wondered which\nhero in the State of Israel might have been my mother\u2019s childhood sweetheart and so I\nromanticize about that. Anyway on the rebound my mother married one f her teachers. My\nfather was quite a bit older than my mother and it was against my mother\u2019s family\u2019s wishes that\nshe rebelliously married him. I was their only child.",
        "Q: How long had they been married before you were born?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. My mother was very young so I imagine they were just married a a short\ntime and I was their first child. In 1939 when I was four, I remember with great clarity, the\nblitzkrieg. I mentioned that my grandparents lived on the outskirts of Warsaw in a section, the\nname of which I don\u2019t remember. And we lived, my mother and father and I, in an apartment\nthat I can describe to you in detail, the apartment building and, in fact, a little bit of our\napartment too, but I won\u2019t. In any case -- well, I'll describe only this much. That it was a red\nbrick building and was built with a courtyard inside but I think a lot of buildings in Europe\nwere. That there were iron gates through which you entered the courtyard. The gate, the handle\nof the gate was a monkey\u2019s paw. I don\u2019t even know though if that\u2019s all that unusual. But I\nremember that clearly and I remember that gypsies came and entertained and there was a gypsy\nwagon. The people leaned out of the windows and looked down into the courtyard and threw\ncoins down. I remember that very well. The circus troupe came and I remember that. I\nremember looking out of the window and I remember that a line was strung from window to\nwindow. I looked out of the window one morning and a ballerina was walking on a rope, right\nin front of my window.",
        "Q: Across the courtyard?",
        "A: Across the courtyard. I remember that she held an umbrella and she smiled at me. I looked\ndown and there was a bear standing on its hind legs and clowns. It\u2019s such a clear memory, you\nknow.",
        "Q: A visiting circus?",
        "A: A visiting circus in the courtyard. And the people threw down coins and that\u2019s how they were\npaid, these itinerant entertainers.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether this was a Jewish neighborhood or was it mixed?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t know. In any case. I do remember that there was a\ntrolley. We took a trolley to my grandparent\u2019s house. The trolley, there was a kind of circle.\nThe trolley was turned on a -- like a lazy susan. And that -- that was the end of the line.",
        "Q: Then the terminal was near you?",
        "A: That was where we lived, at the end of this trolley line. We went all the way to the other end of\nthe trolley line where there was another turn-a-round. Within a walk from there was where my\ngrandparents lived. So I could probably look on an old map of Warsaw and identify where both\ndwellings were.",
        "Q: I have one such map downstairs.",
        "A: You do?",
        "Q: We\u2019 ll look this up after ---.",
        "A: Really?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: I'd like that.",
        "Q: During the break.",
        "A: Thank you. Oh dear, -----",
        "Q: We\u2019re talking about your apartment ...",
        "A: Well, I won\u2019t go into detail bout the apartment. It\u2019s not really all that critical. What I remember\nwas that very hurriedly getting out of it with a lot of bundles and having a ..... My father, I\nmust tell you, my early memories of my father are incredibly warm. My father never raised his\nvoice. My father would play with me on the floor with toys and make -- he was very artistic,\napparently and very creative. We played with different colored clay which we made animals\nand whatever, you know. My father would spend hours in play with me whereas my mother\nwas always busy. She was always baking and cooking and sewing and knitting and doing all\nsorts of -- she was always busy. She was always going in and out and coming and shopping and\ngoing. My father spent a lot of time at home, probably waiting for students or doing -- marking\npapers or whatever he did. In any case, I remember that he and I spent a lot of time in my\nchildhood. I remember my fourth birthday. I remember about it that my father had decorated\nthe entire house with streamers that he had made into... He had cut different colored shiny\npaper, very shiny paper of different colors and he made chain by gluing loops of varied colors.\nHe decorated the room, I guess it was, with these paper chains which hung from the ceiling in\nloops and around the walls and so forth. I remember that, I don\u2019t know, 20 children or whatever\nof my age came and they all brought presents. I had a hysterical fit because I had received two\nsets of dominos and I lay on the floor and kicked and had a tantrum. How wonderful and\nunderstanding my father was and how impatient and annoyed with the whole nonsense, my\nmother was. So my mother was a kind of down to business personality, probably like I am.\nAnd my father was soft and sort of a dreamer. It fits -- the memory that I have of him -- fits\nwith the family version of what he was, which they sort of feel was sort of a failure.",
        "Q: An idealist?",
        "A: An idealist or whatever and an intellectual, he spoke many languages, among them German,\nwith great fluency. He was a poet, he read and wrote poetry and so on and so forth. He was an\nintellectual. My mother was more of an earth mother.",
        "Q: What languages were spoken in your home?",
        "A: We spoke Polish, a very intellectual Polish. Everyone was very well educated. My mother\u2019s\nbrothers and sisters were all very involved in the arts. Each one had a different interest. One in\ntheater, another one in opera and another one in, oh, I don\u2019t know this and that, whatever. All of\nthe guests and friends and so forth and their individual circles of friends were all, you know,\nfamous. They were all celebrity sort of people in the arts. At parties, they were all well known\n-- they were sort of the jet set of -- you know, of the time.",
        "Q: Were you old enough to get any lessons from your father or...?",
        "A: No, no. I was not. I was four years old. I was not. I just remember sitting on the floor and\ndrawing or making, playing with clay. I remember cooking with my mother, baking. My\nmother -- I remember the cookies she baked. I think they\u2019re called Linser tarts or tortes or\nsomething like that. They\u2019re little round -- they were made little round cookies with some jelly\nand then a second cookie with a hole in it on top. That was one she made a lot. Then she made\na cookie which a friend of my father\u2019s who visited quite frequently, I believe he was a\nprofessor, Professor Zuckerman, which means sugar man. These were cookies with coarse\nsugar sprinkled on top and my mother used to call them -- because this gentleman particularly\nenjoyed those cookies -- so she called those Zuckerman cookies. I remember making those\nwith her. I remember sitting -- preparations in my grandmother\u2019s kitchen for the holidays. I\nremember my mother and her sisters and my grandmother all baking and cooking and I\nremember the challahs that they made. These great long challahs braided with a little braid on\ntop. They always made a little one for me or they gave me dough to play with. I remember that\nthey sat me in a high chair kind of across the -- from, you know, the opposite side of the room\nfrom where the ovens were, the heat was. To entertain me, they would say, Mirka, open your\nmouth. They would fling a raisin across the room and I loved raisins and I would open my\nmouth and try to catch the raisin. There were great peals of laughter when it hit my nose or\nnever reached near or whatever it was. I just remember that with such clarity, it\u2019s incredible and\nI was four years old. Then I recall that we left our apartment in great haste, schlepping all sorts\nof bundles. I remember a big hysterical fight with my mother because I insisted on bringing my\nfavorite possession which was an enormous teddy bear, almost my own size. It was a Stief\nteddy bear and my grandmother had bought this teddy bear on the day I was born and gave it to\nmy mother. I grew up with this teddy bear and he was my companion and I remember that I\ncalled that teddy bear by my grandfather\u2019s name which was David. And that teddy bear had to\ngo with me. We left the apartment and I don\u2019t remember by what means we got there. I doubt\nthat it was the trolley. I don\u2019t remember that part but we arrived in my grandparents\u2019 home\nwhere there was enormous excitement in the courtyard, the factory, the house and the people\nwho worked in the factory all lived in surrounding little bungalows on their land. There was\nenormous excitement, people being loaded into trucks and also into the horse drawn carts which\nhad been used to deliver the soda all over Poland and probably all over, I don\u2019t know, Eastern\nEurope. Everybody was getting into trucks and there were sirens and the light was fading.\nThen I remember being pushed up into the back of an open truck. I remember my uncle being\ntold to drive and orders being yelled at my father -- I just remember the entire scene and I...",
        "Q: Did you have David with you?",
        "A: I had David and I sat on my mother\u2019s lap. I remember my mother put her hands -- I sat in her\nlap with my back against her breast. My mother put her hands in front of my face trying to\nshield my eyes and I tore at her fingers trying to get a view of this incredible thing that was\ngoing on. Huge explosions of light streaking across the sky and fireballs and explosions and\nnoise and whistling and screaming! And the horses screaming and automobiles horns and\npeople screaming and bundles flying! All this made excitement and then we moved out in a\ncaravan and joined a -- did you ever see ants following in a trail making a road? Well, that\u2019s\nhow we were -- like a river of humanity in carts and horses, on foot and screaming and it got\ndarker and darker. And then behind the skyline of the city, fires and explosions and that\u2019s how\nwe left Warsaw and life as I knew it, ended.",
        "Q: You had no idea why or who or what was going on?",
        "A: Probably not. Could we take a break? I need a glass of water.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: ... people who take care of the horses and there were people who worked in the factory. Then\nthere were these cabins on the land where the workers lived and whole families lived there. My\ngrandfather sort of took care of all these people and these people were all peasants. Most of\nthem came from the Ukraine. They came and they lived there and they worked and then they\nwould go home and some relatives would be sent back and so forth. Whole families lived from\nmy grandfather and his... But my grandfather was very involved with his horses and his big\ndream was to have a team of horses -- you know the Clydesdale horses that, you know, deliver\nthe beer, I\u2019ve forgotten.",
        "Q: Budweiser?\nA? Budweiser beer. Well these were teams of horses like that. I mean they weren\u2019t Clydesdales\nwith the feathered feet but they were just teams of big brown...",
        "Q: Belgian type horses.",
        "A: Right and they were all dark, big dark horses. But my grandfather\u2019s dream was to have at least\none team of all white horses. I remember that -- and my grandfather fought this new fangled\nbusiness of using trucks. He was enamored of his horses and the idea of the horses and having\nthe white team of horses. He bought -- he kept buying white horses and each time he had a\nfailure. The horse would get sick and die or break a leg or whatever happened and he could\nnever quite collect a team of horses. I remember an incident before the blitzkrieg. He had just\nbought a new white horse, a stallion, I don\u2019t know, whatever. He was very proud of this huge\nwhite horse. I remember being shown this horse along with my mother and father. My uncle\nJacob who was the, I, told you before, the oldest and he was the controller, was very proud of\nthis horse. My grandfather led the horse out of the stable and into the central courtyard of his\ndomain and walked the horse around. He said to Jacob, here you take the horse or whatever it\nwas. Anyway the horse -- and I remember this and it\u2019s a very important story a little later in my\nlife -- the horse reared up and kicked my uncle Jacob in the chest. He bucked, you know, with\nhis hind foot, he hit uncle Jacob in the chest and knocked uncle Jacob unconscious. They\ncarried uncle Jacob into the house. I remember that back room through which we would go -- it\nwas in the back of the house and faced the courtyard. The front of the house where we lived\nwas a little more formal. But you see, the soda manufacturing plant was in the back and the\ncourtyard was all earth, no concrete. So when it rained, it was sort of muddy. Also inside the\nsoda manufactory, it was all water. So the plant was -- had boards nailed together, you know,\nwooden....",
        "Q: Planks.",
        "A: Planks so that the water could go through and underneath. All the workers wore wooden shoes,\nyou know, like the Dutch shoes. So they would leave their shoes at home and everybody had\nsort of a little mud room and they would put on wooden shoes and then go into the manufactory,\nyou know, through the courtyard and into the manufactory and work. Then, when they came\nhome, they would leave those wooden shoes in the mud rooms and put on their shoes or boots\nor whatever they had. Well, our mud room was -- my grandmother\u2019s mud room -- was this big\nroom and it had hooks on the wall on which coats hung and then sort of shelves underneath that\nwhere the wooden shoes sat when they weren\u2019t in use or the boots, you know. There was a\nleather sort of a bed. It wasn\u2019t a sofa, it was like a flat low thing. I guess they must have sat\nthere to put on their boots. So when my uncle Jacob was kicked by the horse, they carried him\ninto this mud room and they put him on this leather sofa bed or whatever it was...",
        "Q: A cot.",
        "A: A cot, yeah, I guess, cot. Well, it was more elegant than a cot. It was a big upholstered thing.",
        "Q: It was leather.",
        "A: But it was leather, yeah. It was dark leather, brown leather. I mean I remember that thing. You\nknow I remember the squeak of the hinge of that back door. I can hear it in my memory. The\nroom where I slept when I stayed at my grandmother\u2019s must have been above or somewhere\nnear that door. Because I remember it opening and closing in the morning when my grandfather\nwent into the factory and my grandmother went out to get the chickens or whatever it was.",
        "Q: You spent a lot of time with your grandparents?",
        "A: Yes, and I loved being there. And I guess because my parents worked, you know. My mother\nmust have worked and my father, I don\u2019t know -- I must have spent a lot of time there and I\nliked it.",
        "Q: Did you love horses?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember any interaction with horses.",
        "Q: So everyone else is more excited about horses than you?",
        "A: Well, I remember being awed, but you know.... I remember spending my time with the cooking\nand that sort of thing, in the kitchen sort of and around my aunts. I remember being in the\nfactory. My grandfather must have taken me there. I remember sitting behind their house on\nbig barrels. He had big barrels which must have contained something to do with the soda plant.\nI don\u2019t know, whatever fruit or, I don\u2019t know, whatever it was. We would sit there on the barrels\nin the sun. That part of the house faced south. In the afternoon, the sun was there. My\ngrandfather and I would sit there and he would tell me stories. I remember one day, he gave me\nHanukkah gelt. I remember he was explaining to me about Hanukkah gelt and I just remember\nhim giving me coins and sitting in the sun and talking about Hanukkah gelt while inside\nwonderful things were being cooked and delicious smells were coming out of the windows and\nacross the courtyard. Anyway, getting back to the story of my uncle Jacob being kicked by the\nhorse, I remember -- oh now -- uncle Jacob, because he was the controller, he wasn\u2019t really\ninvolved in the factory nor the stables. He was in the office so he didn\u2019t wear wooden shoes or\nboots. He wore shoes with laces, you know, like a businessman. So when he went out into the\ncourtyard, it must have been a muddy situation because he was wearing his shoes. When they\nbrought him in and laid him on the couch, I remember, while they were all running around\nexcitedly calling for doctors and what should we do? You undo his belt and you get cold water\nto put on his forehead and blah, blah. My aunts and everybody was quite hysterical. I\nremember untying his shoelaces. I don\u2019t know why I remember doing that but that\u2019s what I did\nwhile they were all -- they were undoing him and I undid his shoelaces. Years later, when uncle\nJacob found me, he -- well shall I tell you about it later or shall I tell 1t now? He said to me, do\nyou know me? I said of course I know you. He said but you were so little when you saw me\nlast, how do you know me? I said well I remember you perfectly and then I told him this story.\nHe was amazed because he figured out that I couldn\u2019t have been three. I must have been like\ntwo and a half when this happened because he knew when it was before the blitzkrieg because\nthat was probably the last time he saw me.. So I had to have been less than three years old. He\nfound it so amazing that my memory was so clear and that he remembered that and how much\nhe had loved me because I was the only -- I was the youngest of his nieces and was the only\nchild of his favorite baby sister. So I was very special and that act of taking off his shoes was\nvery special for him and the fact that I remember that with such clarity meant a great deal to\nhim. But Pll get back to that period later. The next couple of years of my life are very fuzzy.\nThe family all stayed together for a very brief period of time and then my grandparents insisted\non returning to Warsaw.",
        "Q: So you actually left Warsaw?",
        "A: Yes, the entire family and all the workers and everyone who lived there. Everybody -- we went\nin the truck because we -- the family went in the truck. But everyone else was given the cars\nand carts and horses. Take what --run for your lives -- take --save yourselves. Everybody got n\nthe road, we all got on the road and, I guess, dispersed on the road, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Your family remained together? You were in two open trucks?",
        "A: Yes, the family was together in two open trucks. We stayed together. I don\u2019t know where we\nwent. I don\u2019t know. We left the city.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea whether it was a short distance or a..?",
        "A: I really honestly -- I don\u2019t know. I mean I\u2019m sure I went to sleep and I don\u2019t know and hours or\nyears could have elapsed... I really can\u2019t tell you, \u2019'm very fuzzy there. I only know -- I only\nremember isolated instances. I don\u2019t remember history, I remember antidotal sort of things.",
        "Q: Were you in a city or --?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. We were in cities. I know we were in cities. I remember, as I said,\nantidotal incidents. I'll tell you just a few and that might help. I remember that -- I know that\nmy mother\u2019s family were very close, as I have already indicated. Apparently my grandparents\ndecided that they wanted to die in Warsaw in their home and they insisted on going back. I\nknow that some of the sisters went back with them. I don\u2019t know where Jacob and his family\nwent or wound up and I learned later that he refused to sign the communist whatever -- he had\nto pledge -- and therefore he was banished to Siberia. The youngest brother, as I told you, was\nin Paris so he\u2019s out of the picture. Where the aunts all went, the four -- well one was in Russia\nwith her family so the other three, I don\u2019t know. They might have all returned to Warsaw with\nmy grandparents. I know there was another branch of the family in Pinsk. I know we went to\nPinsk, oh that helps, right? We went to Pinsk.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the Russian occupied part of Poland.",
        "A: That\u2019s the direction we -- oh thank you. You\u2019re helping me too. So that is where we went -- to\nPinsk. That\u2019s where we must have gone. I don\u2019t know if we went there immediately or what.\nThen I remember that my parents had furious arguments because my mother wanted to go back.",
        "Q: To Warsaw\u2019?",
        "A: To her parents, to her family, you know. They had horrible fights and didn\u2019t get along very\nwell. I remember screaming and whatever. Then we probably left Poland because I remember\nan incident where one night I heard my mother crying and my parents were arguing and I came\nout of bed. There was a fireplace, you know, most was the central heating most\nplaces in Europe. My parents were burning Polish money; they were burning the bills. My\nmother was crying because she was lamenting all the sacrifices that she had made to save this\nmoney. My father was telling her instead, forever the romantic, look at the beautiful colors of\nthe flames. Don\u2019t think about what it is. There is no paper in the world that burns as\nbeautifully as that. Look at it, look how it sparkles. Look, come here Mirka. Sit by the fire and\nwatch. Isn\u2019t that beautiful? You\u2019ll never see anything like this again as long as you live and of\ncourse I never have seen anyone burn money, particularly Polish money. I remember, oh my\nG___, 1 remember being with my parents once in some other city. We were in a community of\npeople and my mother -- we were on the edge of a forest. It was a city on the edge of a forest.\nMy mother knew about mushrooms. You know in Europe there are wild mushrooms, wild\nmushrooms are picked, there was much more interest in mushrooms that we have in the United\nStates and there was a great deal to know about them because some of them are poisonous and\nwhatever. Well, my mother apparently was a mushroom maven. A group was organized to go\nto the forest on a picnic and mushroom picking expedition. Several families went in a horse\ndrawn carriage and we drove to the edge of the woods -- or maybe two carriages, I don\u2019t\nremember. But anyway, we got to the edge of the woods and there was a little boy about my\nage and we had a picnic on blankets at the edge of the woods, a clearing in the woods, very\nsunny and pretty, clearing and grass. We had this lovely picnic. Then my mother told this little\nboy, you keep an eye on her. He was a little older. You take care of her and we\u2019re going into\nthe woods. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be back, you stay here and play right here. Don\u2019t go further than\nthis spot or whatever she told him. And he and I began to play and run around. We got to\nbushes suddenly, big bushy things and I said to him, look those are berries, they\u2019re raspberries,\nI\u2019m sorry, blueberries, you know, blueberries. He said, yes. There were several kinds of berries\ngrowing and we began to pick these berries and eat them and stuff our mouths with them. I had\non a dress with a pinafore or apron or something and I took the skirt and made a sort of pouch\nand held it in one hand and put the berries into my apron. He began to pull the berries off the\nbush and he climbed up and we had my apron filled when we heard some noise. Suddenly all\nthe adults came flying out of the forest and I was so excited to show my mother what I had\nfound. My mother started to scream, come it\u2019s raining and she took the berries and put them in\nsomething and she just -- there wasn\u2019t time to be excited. My mother was impatient. I already\ntold you that.",
        "Q: Practical woman.",
        "A: Practical, yes. She said come, it\u2019s raining, it\u2019s beginning to rain. We started to go toward the --\nwhere our carriage, cart, horse cart was, and we began to walk in a line. The adults held up the\nblankets over our heads -- made like a ceiling of blankets. The little boy and I and there were\nseveral other children who were older and who had gone into the woods with the mushroom\npickers. We were among their feet, you know, underneath the blankets. The taller adults held\nthe blankets aloft over us on the four corners. Huge drops of rain and possibly hail began to\nfall. With that, two airplanes came flying out of the sky and strafed us and began to shoot. We\nscattered. They made a pass and my mother said, I remember my mother screaming something\nlike the blankets wouldn\u2019t protect us from bullets, scatter. We began to scatter and I wound up\nin a ditch. When the excitement of the planes and the noise and the bombs or whatever ended,\nthe little boy who had been picking berries with me was lying dead next to me. So that\u2019s an\nanecdote.",
        "Q: And you still didn\u2019t know why or what or who?",
        "A: No, I knew. I did understand. You know, it\u2019s like nobody ever explained the facts of life to me,\nnobody ever had a sex talk with me but I knew. Nobody ever explained the war to me, but I\nknew. I was old before my time and understood without explanation. I don\u2019t think I ever asked\na question. I remember men disappearing. I remember the gathering of jewelry to pay some\nkind of ransom. Somebody was imprisoned -- Zuckerman! Dr., Professor Zuckerman, we had\nto... My mother gave some jewelry and we collected jewelry because he was detained. We\nnever did get him back. I remember that. Shortly after that, my father went foraging for food\nsomewhere and he was in a farmer\u2019s field. They went to steal food from a farm at night. I\nremember my father coming back and saying that the soldiers were running -- were chasing\nthem and that he hid in a furrow, you know....",
        "Q: Irrigation ditch?",
        "A: Or something, I don\u2019t know, in a furrow on the farm between the rows of whatever was\ngrowing. And that a soldier stepped on the brim of his cap and very soon after that, my father\ndisappeared and my mother said that he had left and that he would send for us. My mother and\nI were left alone. I remember asking my mother, many, many times, when will father come for\nus or send for us. She always answered in exactly the same way. It\u2019s really one of the half\ndozen Polish words that I remember. She always said, Crusscoov and that means soon. But of\ncourse, he never came. Then my mother and I moved to another city and I wishtoG___I could\ntell you where. But that city was in the Ukraine.",
        "Q: So you never returned to Warsaw\u2019?",
        "A: No, no, we never returned to Warsaw. Oh, I remember, another incident. My parents and I\nwere on a train and the train was bombed. Several of the cars fell down into a ditch and there\nwere many dead and screaming andG____ knows what. We were in the last car of the train and\nI think that was the only one that was left standing on the track and was not hit. So I remember\nthat. Anyway my mother and I were alone and we wound up in this city, probably in the\nUkraine, and very near the village where I was ultimately to be hidden. My mother supported\nus, it\u2019s a terrible word. I mean she provided the little we had by knitting. I know that sounds\nridiculous but my mother would take your old sweater with the holes in the elbows and she\nwould rip out the yarn and out of that torn, holey sweater, she would make you a vest or a short\nsleeve sweater or whatever it was. She knitted day and night. I remember listening to my\nmother\u2019s knitting needles, even in the night. My mother smoked. I remember seeing her\ncigarette in the dark. My mother was an exceptional knitter and she could knit in the dark\nwithout having to look. I remember going into bomb shelters during air raids and my mother\nwould say to me, I\u2019m here, just listen to my needles and you know I\u2019m here. You needn\u2019t be\nafraid as long as you hear my needles. If she wasn\u2019t knitting, she was smoking. She\u2019d say,\nwatch, that\u2019s my cigarette. I would watch her face suddenly light up as se took a puff of her\ncigarette. But most of the time she was knitting. She knitted all the time. She would ask me to\nhold out my hands. When she ripped a sweater, she would wind the yarn around my hands. My\ntwo outstretched hands. Then she would wind it into a ball from my hands. I remember\nholding out my hands and getting very tired and complaining a great deal but that was how she\nsupported us. I know that at night, she would sneak out after the curfew and she would go to\nthe parts of the city where she wasn\u2019t allowed to go be, to deliver her goods. One time she took\nme with her. That was rare, usually she left me back in our room with my teddy bear, my\nDavid, my treasured possession. She took me with her into the city and she said she was taking\nme to a lady who, I must be very careful and I must not speak only to say please and thank you\nand to be very polite, other than that to not speak. If I\u2019m asked a question only to say yes and\nno and not to say anything. Because where we were going was very dangerous but this was a\nvery generous lady and she would probably serve tea and cake or cookies. That was why my\nmother was going to take a chance and take me because we might get something very delicious\nto eat, or jam, jam. So we went and we crossed into a section that I don\u2019t remember by what\nmeans or what but I know we weren\u2019t allowed o be there. We went into a house and I just seem\nto remember that it was a white house and it had a door. We went inside and inside was a very\ncozy home, a cozy room with lovely upholstered furniture and a lot of pillows. There was a\npiano and it had a shawl over it and a beautiful vase filled with flowers. There were\nphotographs and there were a lot of pictures and paintings and things on the walls. We sat on an\nupholstered, lovely carved settee with a table in front. Just as my mother had predicted, this\nlady brought out a tray with a tea service on it with cookies and jam and toast and wonderful\nthings. I ate and oh it was so wonderful.",
        "Q: You hadn\u2019t had anything like that in a while?",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t had anything like that, my G__! Oh, it was so wonderful. With that the lady said to\nmy mother, come into my bedroom and I\u2019Il show you what I made. It turned out that this lady\nwas a -- well she did beautiful needlework. She did these pictures which were framed which\nwere both embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d. For example, there was one -- well I\u2019Il tell you about\nthat one because it almost caused our death. Also the reason she called my mother into another\nroom 1s because this lady also made dolls which were fully clothed adult dolls but they were\napparently anatomically correct. So she showed this lovely doll but then invited my mother into\nthis next room so that she could undress this male doll and show my mother that it had all its\nanatomical parts. Well, while my mother and this lady were out of the room I turned and\nlooked at the wall behind me on which hung a picture that this woman had also made. The\npicture was of a sort of cottage and a yard filled with chickens and there were flowers against\nthe cottage and there were little windows with shutters and a door and so forth. There was a girl\nthrowing feed from an apron, just like I had described before, throwing seed out to chickens.\nThere were chickens all over, feeding and flying around and whatever. All of this was\nappliqu\u00e9d and embroidered and so on and very intricate. Suddenly I realized to my horror or\nfascination that the girl feeding the chickens had a yellow star on her chest. When my mother\ncame out of the other room with this lady, I absolutely couldn\u2019t help but point it out. Look she\nhas a yellow star. With that this woman flew into a rage, pointed a finger at my mother and\nsaid, you did that, it wasn\u2019t there before, you\u2019re responsible, you did that! She screamed out of\nthe door for the police. My mother and I ran out. There were two police and I can\u2019t tell you\nwhat they were but I think they had brown....",
        "Q: Brown uniforms?",
        "A: Brown uniforms. That\u2019s -- I think -- my memory serves me -- they were brown. One blew a\nwhistle and ran around the corner for the truck or whatever it was. The other one had a rifle or\na gun or something, I don\u2019t remember, and he was holding on to my mother. I realized the\nimport of what was happening and I began to scream and I bit the hand of this policeman. He\nbegan -- pulled away his hand in pain and screamed out. My mother grabbed me and we ran\nand hid and we got away. At that time, my mother and I shared a room with another lady in a\nsort of a boarding house which must have been all Jews. I don\u2019t know whether the woman who\nowned this home was Jewish or not, I only remember that she -- I remember a lot about her\nactually. One of the things that I remember is that she kept talking about her son who was in\nthe army and who was going to come home. She had cookies or mondelbrut that she had baked\nand she had it in packages under a cabinet. She showed us that she had baked this and she was\nsaving it for her son, it was his favorite thing. As soon as she knew where he was, she would\nsend it to the front, send some to the front. But if that wasn\u2019t possible that was okay, because he\nwould be home soon and then she would have this for him. My mother and the lady who shared\nthe room with us gave each other a knowing sort of look and then my mother, every night,\nproceeded to steal some of the cookies.",
        "Q: Was this an Ukrainian woman?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. One day, my mother went out and she came home very, very excited, very\nhappy. At that time we were literally starving. There was nothing to eat. It was summer and\nwe were eating, it\u2019s a weed that grows. It\u2019s kind of a jagged leaf and it has a kind of gray, silky,\nshiny surface. It grows here in the United States and every year is a ritual, I eat some. It kind\nof tastes like spinach. That\u2019s what we ate that summer, that and the stolen cookies. Every now\nand then something else my mother was able to forage. But my mother came home one day\nextremely excited and happy. She had made a great coup, a conquest. She brought home this\ntreasure. She carefully unwrapped this thing. I couldn\u2019t wait to see what it could possibly be.\nShe kept on unwrapping this handkerchief. It was in this piece of cloth. Finally there was this\ntwo- inch square of -- or maybe it was one inch, I don\u2019t know -- it looked like a big domino of\nsomething white. I\u2019d never seen it. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I said to my mother, what 1s it?\nIt was such a treasure! She said, it\u2019s fat, which didn\u2019t mean anything to me but it did finally\nmean that she was able to fry those greens and they had a little taste rather than eating them raw\nor boiling them.",
        "Q: Earlier you mentioned that you saw this embroidered picture with the star, a person wearing a\nstar. Did you see any people, real people wearing those stars?",
        "A: Yes, I was one of them and so was my mother. My mother was very talented at all needle work.\nShe was a wonderful seamstress. My mother had made me a beautiful -- she must have made it\n-- well I guess it could have been after the blitzkrieg. Maybe it was a birthday present, in fact,\nmaybe I think it was a birthday present.",
        "Q: A birthday after the blitzkrieg?",
        "A: Possibly or the one after that, I don\u2019t really know. That period is very -- it\u2019s all very fuzzy. I\nmean my memories are more anecdotal than they are historic. There\u2019s no real sequence. I\nguess they\u2019re in some sort of sequence but it doesn\u2019t really tell you much, well maybe it does.\nSo my mother made me this coat and I remember this lovely spring coat. It was a very pale\ngray tweed and it had little nubs of color, little colors. The colors were all pastel, little bumps all\nover this fabric. They were beautiful, pale lavender and pink and light green and blue and just\nsort of a capelet, a little cape on top of the shoulders. I remember that I couldn\u2019t wait for it to\nget warm enough to wear this wonderful treasure that my mother had made. When I finally -- it\nwas time to wear to it my mother sewed this very ugly yellow star on my left shoulder and my\nleft shoulder blade. And I protested vehemently and she simply told me not to discuss it. It was\na fact and to ignore it.",
        "Q: This was your first yellow star?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Then this was before you had seen that -- the embroidered picture?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, the yellow stars became common. I also remember my mother coming home\none day. She had a navy coat and it had a black fur collar, a shiny -- a seal. It must have been a\nseal collar or a black Persian , or I don\u2019t know, something, a black fur collar. When she came\nhome -- and the coat had yellow stars on it -- when she returned home from wherever she had\nbeen, the fur had been removed from her coat. She explained to our roommate that all fur had\nto be donated to the German army because they needed it. Of course, the coat was ruined. So I\nremember that. One day my mother came home and she had this young girl with her. She was\na teenage girl and I was supposed to remember her, but I only vaguely remembered her.\nApparently this girl had been a student of my father\u2019s in Warsaw. My mother, by chance,\nbumped into her somewhere in town and brought this girl whose name was Rya. She sat me on\nher lap and in her no nonsense sort of way, she said to me, you must go with Rya and when I\ncan, I will come for you. When will you come for me? Crusscoov.",
        "Q: You heard that one before?",
        "A: Of course, my mother never came for me.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea when this was? How many winters, for example, had passed since you\nhad been wandering?",
        "A: I know that this incident was at the very end of summer. It was probably the same summer\nwhich the preceding spring had brought the pretty coat and the yellow star experience and all\nthat sort of thing.",
        "Q: The same year that you had the incident with the picture, the embroidered picture?",
        "A: Yes, probably although --. I would imagine that that was very close, those events were very\nclose to each other. The events that I told you before, traveling with my father, the train, the\nbombing with the blankets over the head and all that; I think that was probably a year before.\nSo that might have been, say 1941.",
        "Q: Pretty good guess.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you see German soldiers?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, of course, yes.",
        "Q: More so than before?",
        "A: Yes, I didn\u2019t really see a great deal of German soldiers when I was still with my mother,\nalthough yes, some.",
        "Q: Any explosions, aircraft, bombings?",
        "A: A lot, a lot. I told you about listening to my mother\u2019s knitting needles in bomb shelters and\ncellars and that sort of thing. That was nothing, that was daily, sometimes twice daily. Many\ntimes, that was --that was just ordinary. In fact, at one point, I was pushed down some stairs, or\na ladder or something and my nose was broken. It wasn\u2019t even known until the next day that\nmy nose was broken because we were in the dark. It wasn\u2019t until the light that my mother saw\nthat I was completely bruised -- my nose had been shattered.",
        "Q: You were someplace in the western Ukraine, late summer, end of summer \u201941 and your mother\nis Now giving you to this young woman who was also from Warsaw originally?\nA No. Now I have to give you a little bit of background. First of all, Rya was no more than a\nteenager at that point. I would say, that at the most, she was 16 or 17. I would have been say\nfive and a half, six. So Rya was, I don\u2019t know, ten years older. A little background... In the\nUkraine, what I know of the Ukraine, there are little villages. Obviously, there are big towns\nbut the countryside of the Ukraine was... This is another life, now I\u2019m giving you history that I\n-- this is where I lived. There were little villages which were connected to each other by dirt\nroads. During the summer these roads were traversed by horse drawn carriage, not carriages\nbut carts. The villages -- surrounding these villages were the farms. The land had been divided\nafter the fall of the Czars, Czar, First World War, had been divided among the peasants.\nPrevious to that, it was owned by the Church. So that now although the people were very\nreligious and were very loyal to the village priest and they were very generous to him; he was\nno longer as wealthy and flamboyant as they had been during the time of the Czars, during\nWhite Russia. But because the peasants were religious, the priests lived a far better life than did\nthe peasants. Now it\u2019s the Greek Orthodox Church, the Bible is in Greek. The priests marry\nand have families. The families were the intelligentsias, if you will, of the village. The children\nof the priests became the postmaster, the school teachers, the mayor, if there was such a thing.\nThey sort of ran the community.",
        "Q: They could read and write?",
        "A: They could read and write. Some f them were very highly educated. The more wealthy was the\npriest, the better educated were his children. In order to be educated they were sent \u201cabroad\u201d\u2019.\nAbroad meant great cities in Europe like Warsaw where this particular Rya, child of a priest in\nan Ukrainian village would up studying in Warsaw with my father. Apparently she took private\nlessons at home or somehow or other got home to meet my mother and became enamored of my\nmother and became a frequent visitor. I told you earlier about the generosity of my\ngrandmother and her warmth and so forth, and I am sure that my mother befriend this young\ngirl from the Ukraine in a similar sort of way, although this girl was not of peasant stock. But\nmy mother liked her and they had a relationship. Therefore, when my mother bumped into her\nin town and explained our plight, Rya must have asked -- I had to have been a baby, less than\nfour -- and Rya must have played with me or possibly babysat or whatever. So when my mother\nexplained our plight and the possibilities of our disaster, Rya being an altruistic, kind and\nreligious teenager said, well I\u2019Il take her home and hide her with me, without any thought to the\nconsequences or to the reaction of her family or the possible danger to herself, her family, the\nentire village, the future, I mean, you know, nothing. She simply offered and my mother\njumped at the opportunity. So my mother sent me off with a little package of clothing wrapped\naround a handkerchief, my teddy bear who was now significantly smaller than I was. I\nremember walking down the front steps. I remember my mother standing on the stairs saying\ndon\u2019t turn around. Just go, walk through the gate and don\u2019t turn around, keep walking.\nRemember what I told you, remember what I told you. We walked through the -- down the\nstairs and through the garden. I remember that the garden was overgrown and unkempt and\nwilted and a great mass of jungle. It had been cultivated at one time. That\u2019s why I -- it was late\nsummer. I remember walking with Rya holding my hand and I holding on to my teddy bear and\nRya with the bundle. We walked out and I turned once to look at my mother and she was\nholding a handkerchief up to her face. She yelled again don\u2019t turn around, keep walking.\nThat\u2019s my last memory of my mother. I don\u2019t even remember getting to the village or anything\nabout it. I don\u2019t remember arriving, I don\u2019t remember any of that.",
        "Q: Had you remembered Rya from before? Or were you -- as far as you were concerned this was a\nstranger?",
        "A: No, I might have -- I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember whether I remembered\nthen or...I was just an obedient child and I went... If my mother said she would come for me,\nshe would come for me. If she said that I would be safe and I should go, that was it. I trusted\nmy mother and I knew not to argue with my mother.",
        "Q: Were you wearing your yellow star?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t imagine so, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure that that yellow star was on\nsummer clothing. I think it might have only been on outerwear. I really don\u2019t recall that.",
        "Q: But Rya knew you were Jewish?",
        "A: Rya.",
        "Q: Rya.",
        "A: Yes, yes. So now we arrive in the village of the Ukraine. I\u2019ll describe the village to you. There\nwas a dirt road through which you got to the village. When you got to the village, there were\nhouses, there\u2019s one in these pictures somewhere. There\u2019s a man standing in front of it -- I was\nlooking at it before and now I can\u2019t find it. It\u2019s kind of log cabins with thatched roofs. Why\ndon\u2019t you turn that off for a moment and I\u2019Il look for the pictures?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: There were houses like I pointed out to you with thatched roofs, log cabin kind of houses, but\nwhitewashed; whitewashed log cabins. Then the road split like a wishbone. In the crook of the\nwishbone sat a small, white church with steps going up. It had a large door and two windows.\nWhen I looked at it, 1t looked like a clown face because it had a big window on each side of the\ndoor and the steps -- it looked like a clown with his tongue hanging out. It had a sharp point at\nthe top of the cross with the slash underneath. The road went around it. Behind the church was\na small cemetery with crosses, stone crosses. There was a legend that the cross of the priest\nwhose family I was about to live with, that stone cross grew every year. The people wee so\nsuperstitious and they had revered this particular priest to such a degree that these legends about\nhim grew. Anyway, the houses continued as the road -- the two roads...",
        "Q: Diverged.",
        "A: Diverged, exactly behind the church. I would say that at the very most there were 30 to 50\nhouses. That was the entire town. On the left side behind our house, which was the most\nelegant house, it was a clapboard house, very different from the other cabins...Further back\nbehind our house was a stream and then a forest. On the opposite side of town, to my right, as I\nwas facing the church was a road that led out to the fields where all of the various wheat and\ngrain and hemp and barley and whatever all was grown was. That was the entire town. There\nwas no electricity, there were no automobiles, there were no telephones. The donation that I\nmade to you, I wrote a little piece to go with it. The little dress we grew our own hemp. We\nspun on a spinning wheel, we spun the yarn. It was loomed at home, on a loom. I sewed it by\nhand. Life was primitive. I am sure that it was no different than it had been two centuries\nbefore. That was the life of the village.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So I\u2019ve described the village to you. Okay, the household. I mean I could describe our house.\nVery briefly, Pll tell you that life was centered for the most part around the kitchen, primarily\nbecause it was the warmest place. There was no central heating of any kind, in fact. There is\nusually a fireplace in one room and the wall against which the fireplace 1s in one room 1s the\nbed wall in the adjacent room simply because of the heat, you know, the warmth. There was one\nroom which must have been the back of the kitchen, the wall behind where the oven where we\nbaked our bread was. We used to sit in that room a great deal. Or if not sit, we would stand\nwith our hands behind our back leaning on that warm wall. We would take turns because only\none spot on the wall was really warm and so we would take turns. That was how our evenings\nwere spent. We would tell stories. In fact, Rya devised a game. She would start a story. She\nwould say Mirka and Vali were two beautiful children and they went on a picnic. When they\ngot out to the woods a wolf suddenly jumped out from behind a tree and Mirka said ---, and she\nwould point to me and I would have to pick up the story. Then I would take the story to some\nprecipice and the next person would go on with it. This is how we entertained ourselves at\nnight and then we would all go to sleep.",
        "Q: Just you and Rya?",
        "A: No and other members of the family.",
        "Q: Were there other brothers...?\nA Yes, I'll tell you about that. That\u2019s how our evenings were spent. There wasn\u2019t much to the\nevening because we woke up to the roosters. They took off with the first light, they would\ncrow. Life would start at five in the morning or whatever it was and I am sure we were all in\nbed and asleep by dark.",
        "Q: Candlelight?",
        "A: Kerosene, we had kerosene lamps. Okay, the members of the family. The priest had died some\nyears before, two, three, five, I don\u2019t know. The wife of the priest was very highly revered in\nthe town and she was, in fact, feared. She was spoken of in the third person, you know.\nEnormous respect was accorded her. She was spoken of in the way you speak of a -- almost a\ngod or a monarch, or whatever. Very highly respected and revered. People paid court. There\nwere obligatory visits that they had to make. They brought baskets of fruit, or whatever, to visit\nher. They would nod in our direction whether we were sitting by the window or not, nod\ntoward our house as they walked by to pay respect, that sort of thing. Now she was a very\nbright woman. It was decided that my new identity was going to be that she was -- she spoke\nfluent Polish -- she was very well educated. She was fluent in Polish so my identity was going\nto be that she was Polish and had married the Ukrainian priest but she had a sister back in\nPoland and I was that sister\u2019s child. That was -- since I came from, I don\u2019t know where,\nwherever they had me come from in Poland, my Ukrainian was not perfect, my Russian was not\nabsolutely perfect, but that was the excuse. I was brought from the city of -- I was her niece, or\nher relative, or whatever and that was why my name was different. I didn\u2019t look exactly like\nthem and that was my beard.",
        "Q: You were given a new last name?",
        "A: Yes, yes. So I had a new last name which was a Polish last name. Theirs was a Russian name,\nobviously. I remember only that my name was purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs\nended in kvov which son of whatever as does ski, I think. In any case, so I was --well, it\u2019s\nirrelevant, okay, I won\u2019t give you all that. In any case, this woman had five children. The\noldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really didn\u2019t take too terribly well to education. I\ndon\u2019t think he was ever sent abroad. He was sort of more interested in farming. He was very\npractical, he was the farmer. He was huge, he had a moustache, he never smiled, he rolled his\nown cigarettes, he spat into a spittoon. You know, he was more like a peasant. He was very\nwell liked and respected and he was like one of the boys and probably the head boy, you know.\nThen there was a middle son and he was very rebellious. He ultimately ran off to the forest and\nwas with the partisans. In fact, I used to hide out by the woods when the Germans came. At\none point, I was hidden in the hayloft, haystack rather. He once or twice came and gave me\nmessages which I carried back. But I hardly remember him because he left. I don\u2019t even\nremember his name. I remember that his mother -- I remember his mother describing him to\nsomeone, and she said, and it\u2019s funny because it\u2019s an expression that I\u2019ve used many times\nbecause it described him so well, it described his nature. She said that this middle son when he\nhas a cause or feels strongly about something would fight until he was up to his knees in blood.\nI don\u2019t know whether that was a Russian saying but I\u2019ve heard myself saying that in describing\nsuch a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn person. The youngest son was two years older than\nI was. His name was Vali and I was -- he and I slept in the same bed. I was, I don\u2019t know, five\nand a half, six; he was two years older. I can describe him perfectly. He was very tow headed.\nHe had a cowlick in sort of in the wrong place. It was just above the widow\u2019s peak where his\nhairline began. He had a sort of a double cowlick with cowlicks going in opposite directions at\nthat point. Because of that, his hair was almost shaved off. Because had it not been, it probably\nwouldn\u2019t have been able to sort of stay all in the same direction. So he has this Russian version\nof a crew cut. So those were the three sons. The two daughters were Rya, who I\u2019ve already\ntold you about and the older one whose name I really don\u2019t remember and whom I didn\u2019t get to\nknow very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in town. So she had some sort\nof office type job. Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever,\nthe provider and the man about the house. Vali was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the\nmiddle boy was the rebellious, I don\u2019t know, 14 year old he was, who ran off and joined the\npartisans and became what we called a Cossack. So that was the household. Now I was not\nreceived with any degree of love or kindness. I wasn\u2019t sheltered or shielded or loved at all. I\nwas tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of taken care of but never with kindness, never\nwith love. I was never complimented. If I did something very well, it was -- more than\nanything I had the feeling of resentment. Furthermore, I was from the city. I was urbane and\nVali was a peasant. He had never been to the city. I described the building in which I lived\nwhich had four floors. He couldn\u2019t understand that there was a room above a room. I explained\nto him that it was like the attic where they dried their apple slices on a -- strung from one end to\nanother -- and stored things. Also like the cellar where the cabbage slaw was kept and that, in\nfact, his house had three floors. But these were four floors of one above the other, bedrooms\nand, you know, apartments. I described one apartment building. He couldn\u2019t conceive of such\na thing. He couldn\u2019t conceive of such a thing as chocolate either. So that when we were finally\ninvaded by the German army, the first time I was hidden in the haystack which I already\nmentioned. But then they went back and forth and in and out. They were, you know, driven out\nby the Russians and there was fighting back and forth. So they were there several times, 1n and\nout. At some point, I became very brazen and I wound up sitting on the laps of officers. They\nwould pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with me and so forth and give me chocolate. I\nwould then take the chocolate and give it to Vali. Until the mother found out about this and put\na stop to it because it was, you know, absolutely life threatening. Well, anyway I never really\nhad any love. I was incredibly lonely. I kept thinking about my mother. One day, it just\noccurred to me that she\u2019s not living and she\u2019Il never come back. Meanwhile the mother, Vali\u2019s\nmother, Rya\u2019s mother, was teaching me to read, to sew, to be a Ukrainian child, girl. Taught me\nall the things, how to spin, how to weave, how to sew, how to mend, how to cook a little bit\nalthough it was very difficult because of the primitive style of cooking in deep ovens with iron\npots. You know, children couldn\u2019t physically manage that but everyone had jobs and mine was\npeeling the potatoes. In the time that I was there, in the two and a half years, I must have peeled\nten truckloads of potatoes, that\u2019s all I did. I peeled potatoes. I read with the mother and at first\nshe would read to me. She read me Bible stories. She would read to me and she would point to\nthe words with her finger. I would watch her moving finger across the page and then she would\nturn the page and there would be a picture that related to the story. She would continue the story\nand I kind of fell in love with one story. I kept asking her to read it over and over. It was the\nstory of the prodigal son. I don\u2019t know why I liked that one especially but somehow... So she\nread it over and over and then one day in the middle of the story, she sort of looked up and she\nsaid, you read, and I did. And not only did I read but -- maybe because I had heard that one so\nmany times -- I understood it and I read it and we turn the page and went on to the next story.\nAt one point we turned the page and there was a picture of little girls crossing a little bridge\nover a -- you know -- like a little stream. Hovering -- and there was a very sort of rickety little\nbridge, maybe a log, whatever it was, and it looked dangerous with the rushing water\nunderneath. Hovering in flight with arms outstretched behind the little child was an angel with\nbeautiful wings like a bird and a flowing gown. I said what is that and she explained to me\nabout angels. I said everybody has an angel? She said every child has an angel to protect it. I\nsaid even Jewish children? She said yes, even Jewish children and even you. You have a very\nspecial angel. So that night I went to sleep and I woke up and I knew who my angel was. I was\nabsolutely certain that my own angel was the infant Jesus and that I would be protected because\nI had a Jewish angel. No harm would come to me. I knew that I would be all right. I can tell\nyou a lot of stories about life in that village. I was there two Christmases and three Easters or\nmaybe the other way around. It\u2019s the other way around. One day, you\u2019re not going to believe\nthis, you\u2019re not going to believe this... One day in the middle of the severest winter, a horse\ndrawn sled came into town on the road, which was an event. I mean nothing came in the winter.\nSometimes, you know, if the German army was there, the trucks came but we never saw\nanything like cars or.... In fact, once a car came and all the children of the village gathered\naround the car and stared at it as if it was a flying saucer.",
        "Q: You had seen one before, hadn\u2019t you?",
        "A: Well, I mean to me, it was cars, I mean it was nothing, I had been in cars. My grandfather had a\nyard full of big shiny black cars and I remember sitting on his lap and blowing the horn, it was\noutside the car, you know, one of those things you squeezed. I mean cars -- was nothing to me.\nI was a city child. I remember being fascinated watching all these children staring at the car like\nit was something really. But in any case, it was a great event in the middle of winter, a sled\ncame from -- into town. Also a wagon, you know, a sled came from -- into town. Also a\nwagon, you know, a sled pulled by a single horse with a bell and a guy huddled up and dressed\nin -- bundled with a whip. He came right to our house and Rya came to me and she said Mirka\ndo you remember your uncle Jacob. This is a note from your uncle Jacob. He\u2019s waiting for\nyou. I was put on the sled the next morning. That morning, Vali, the little boy who was two\nyears older than I, disappeared and hid with my teddy bear. Finally the sled driver was anxious\nto leave and we could wait no longer and I had to leave without my teddy bear.",
        "Q: For the first time in your life?",
        "A: Yes. That teddy bear is alive and well and living in the Ukraine and I know that. Because that -\n-that artifact would never be destroyed or discarded, never.",
        "Q: They loved _ teddy bears?",
        "A: I know that teddy bear is living and well somewhere in the Ukraine. So several hours later, by\nsled, we got into town and a tall extremely handsome man with a moustache and dark hair; he\nlooked kind of like Clark Gable or possibly..... No, no even more distinguished than that, not as\nromantic a figure but the one who -- what was that great war movie, Mrs. Miniver, who was the\nhusband of Mrs. Miniver? Not Gregory Peck, Walter Pidgeon. So my uncle Jacob, looking like\nWalter Pidgeon, in black shiny boots, very natty, very straight like a soldier, lifted me out of the\nwagon and set me down. I looked up at him, up, up, up; he was so tall. He said, do you\nremember me? I said, of course, you\u2019re uncle Jacob. How do you remember me? And he\ncarried me into the house and I told him the story of when the horse kicked him in the chest.",
        "Q: Those were the days.",
        "A: Well, uncle Jacob and I traveled around Europe. We went to a number of capitols. I remember\nthat we went to -- I think we were in four or five countries. We traveled by those same railroad\ncars, looking for survivors. We lived in rooms that were incredibly cold. I'd like to tell you\nabout one experience but first I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to know how it was that uncle Jacob found\nthis needle in the haystack hidden in a village in the Ukraine when he had been in Siberia. So\nnow I'll tell you a story that you will not believe. Uncle Jacob left Siberia where he had been\nput in charge because he was, I had told you before he was so trustworthy and efficient and\ngood at everything, so he had been put in charge of the food supply, mainly the meat. He was\nthe head butcher in charge of -- he never touched the meat but he was in charge of all the food.\nWith the little bit of black marketing and finagling that he did, he was able to fill several\nsuitcases or bundles with goods, ladies\u2019 silk underwear... I don\u2019t know where he got all this\nstuff. I\u2019m sure they were payoffs for favors or whatever but as we traveled around Europe later,\nafter he found me, those suitcases got lighter and lighter because their contents is what kept us\nfed.",
        "Q: That was your money?",
        "A: That was our money. He also kept a journal. Unfortunately, at one point, we had to cross a\nborder where I was told that I was to play the part of a deaf mute since we were going -- I didn\u2019t\nspeak the language of wherever we were going. He was so fearful that he burned the journal\nand it was the history of the entire war, day by day, from the time he left Warsaw. So\nunfortunately a great treasure was -- and I watched that burn, I watched that burn. That was a\ndaily log. Anyway Jacob left Siberia and traveled until he -- traveled to many places. At one\npoint he wound up in this town.",
        "Q: The town that\u2019s near the village where you had been staying?",
        "A: Yes. The way the Jews \u2014 there were no train schedules, you know. People would -- if they\nwanted to go east, they went to the platform where the train was heading east was going and\nthey sat on the platform for a day, for an hour, for a week, whatever, until the train came. When\nthe train came, they boarded the train and they went east. When the train stopped, they got off\nor they kept going or whatever and that\u2019s how people got around. So there were always people\nsitting on the platform. They were going either east or west or wherever they were going, north,\nsouth, waiting, sitting on platforms. Well, apparently, Jacob got off the platform and I have\nalready described to you that he was extremely handsome, very nattily dressed, which was very\nunusual, highly unusual. So this handsome guy gets off the train with two bulging suitcases and\nthe women were extremely attracted to him. He began to talk to a woman who was waiting for\na train which was going east -- in the opposite direction -- into, towards Siberia. Is that east?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: The direction from whence he had come.",
        "A: From whence he had come. So he gets off the train, he\u2019s on the platform, he begins to chat with\nthis woman. What is your name? That woman was the only human being who knew my\nwhereabouts. She was the woman who had shared the room with me and my mother.",
        "Q: Before your mother gave you to Rya?",
        "A: Yes. Had her train come first---. It was absolute sheer chance! He said Berliner, my mother\nhad changed her name, she was no longer using her married name because she was so\ndisillusioned with her husband, my father. So she had gone back to her name, Berliner. This\nwoman said oh your name is Jacob Berliner. My dear friend was Berliner. My uncle -- I\u2019m\nhearing this -- apparently fainted. Her train came. She got on the train and disappeared. He\nwasn\u2019t sure what niece. He didn\u2019t get all the facts. He knew the village, he knew a child. He\nthought it might be me but 1t could have been any number of his nieces. He didn\u2019t know. He\nfainted. I don\u2019t know how long he was on the platform. Anyway, he was found passed out by\nsomeone who I think was also a priest. He was taken home to that person\u2019s house, maybe\nbecause he looked wealthy, I don\u2019t know whatever. In any case, apparently he was sick,\ndelirious, ill, I don\u2019t know, whatever for a number of days. In that time, he told us later that he\nhad a dream. In the dream, he dreamed he was back in Warsaw, it was before the war. He was\nwearing his tails and top hat because he had come from a ball or gone to the opera, or whatever\nit was. He was walking along the street with his walking stick and as he got near the street\nlamp, gas lit street lamp, he heard the clippety clop of an oncoming carriage. It was a very\nfoggy night and out of the fog approached this horse drawn black carriage. He tried to peer\ninside but he couldn\u2019t see because of the fog but it stopped right under the street lamp. A\nwoman leaned forward and she was all dressed in white. Here comes the lump in the throat. It\nwas my mother, his young sister. She said, Yacov, take care of my child. He knew who it was\nand it was the next day that he sent this sled to get me.",
        "Q: She was your guardian angel?",
        "A: Perhaps, you\u2019re right, perhaps you\u2019re right.",
        "Q: So that it was on a hunch, limited information, and a dream?",
        "A: And a dream. An absolute meeting by chance. Two trains coming from different directions \u2014\npeople chatting on a platform. It wouldn\u2019t have happened if he was raggedy like all the rest but\nhe was so natty and so attractive and this woman began to -- she was attracted to him and began\nto chat with him. I just want to tell you that when I was born, apparently I was a very sickly\ninfant. The story goes that I couldn\u2019t be cured. I apparently had all of the childhood diseases,\nall at the same time. Anyway I was given up for dead. I had everything including whooping\ncough, all at the same time. They gave me up, this child will never live. Finally my mother in\ndesperation said well, then she\u2019Il die at home. She took me out of the hospital away from the\nspecialists and so forth and took me home to a room that she had painted white, everything\nincluding the floor. She had prepared this room for me. She took me into this room and no one\nwas allowed in the room. She cared for me herself. No one could come into the room until her\nbrother Jacob came. She said to him, Jacob, I know this sounds ridiculous. Everything has been\ndone for my child and my child is given up for dead. There are no more medical cures. I know\nyou'll think it\u2019s silly but there\u2019s one last thing that we haven\u2019t done. We haven\u2019t tried to fool the\ndybbuk, the dybbuk wants my child. He says tell me, I'll do anything. My mother said, we\nmust fool the dybbuk into thinking this is a different child. He said well what, what should we\ndo? So she said to him, well I will sell you this child and you will give her a new name and\nshe\u2019ll be yours and then the dybbuk won\u2019t want her anymore because it\u2019s not the child that the\ndybbuk wants. He said all right. How much do you want for her? She said well what is a\nchild\u2019s life worth? Give me your hat. He took off his hat. She said okay take this hat, fill it\nwith pennies, bring it back and I will give you my child. So he went and he filled the hat with\npennies and he came back and he bought me. She said, Jacob, what is your child\u2019s name? He\nsaid her name is Chai Berliner. Chai because it means life. And I survived and I got well. So I\nwas very precious to Jacob. All that bubba meinsa fits, you see. It just was meant that Jacob\nwould find me. All right, so Jacob and I traveled. We stayed in all kinds of places. There was\none time I remember, he woke me very early in the morning. We were in a room somewhere.\nWe had slept -- it was so cold. I used to sleep on top of him, huddled on top of his chest,\nsnuggled up. I was tiny, teeny. He woke me, he said quickly get up, we must get dressed. But\nWuyjaszek I called him Wujaszek, wujak in Polish 1s uncle, wujaszek 1s diminutive, a loving --.\nBut Wujaszek, but it\u2019s still dark, it\u2019s so cold, I can\u2019t get dressed. He said here you dress inside\nthe bed, under the covers. While you dress, I'll get you the milk. Ihave milk. He reached for\nthe milk which was sitting in a bottle on the corner but the bottle was full and it had -- the milk\nhad frozen and the bottle had cracked.",
        "Q: But it was still frozen?",
        "A: Yes, but it was still frozen. That\u2019s how cold our room was. Anyway we dressed and he said\ncome we must go to the market. To the market, why are we going to the market? It\u2019s the\nmiddle of the night. He said, come, we must rush, we must run. He explained nothing. I\ndressed and we walked and walked and walked. It was still dark and we got to the market in the\nfirst light of morning. Instead of the usual stalls, the farmers selling their produce, there were\njust hundreds and hundreds of people in this cobblestone marketplace. As the morning dawned,\nJacob said I\u2019m going to put you on my shoulders. I want you to watch and no matter how\nhorrible the sight, I want you to keep your eyes open and watch. I said, Wujaszek, what am I\ngoing to see? Why are we here? He said they\u2019ve caught some German officers and they are\ngoing to hang them and I want you to watch. Why? He said because I don\u2019t want you to have\nany hate. The man you\u2019re going to see hanged is the man who murdered your mother. He sat\nme on his shoulders and I watched three men being hung. He just didn\u2019t want me to hate. He\nwanted it all to -- he wanted me to be healthy -- to let it all out in this one traumatic, ugly,\nhorrible experience.",
        "Q: How did he know that this officer killed your mother? Did he know where your mother had\nbeen?",
        "A: Obviously he didn\u2019t. It was just, just \u2014",
        "Q: Therapy?",
        "A: It was just therapy. It was his way. There was no connection whatsoever. He just didn\u2019t want\nme to hate anyone. I have to admit 50 years later that it didn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t hear German\nspoken without -- it didn\u2019t work. He used to leave me alone in the room. He would say, here\u2019s\nfood, here\u2019s my watch. I\u2019m going to be gone for eight hours. I\u2019ll be back at seven o\u2019clock. I\nwant you to sit here and listen to the radio. Here\u2019s paper and pencil. Just listen. If you hear --\ndon\u2019t change the station -- it\u2019s on just the station. Listen carefully, if anything sounds familiar,\nwrite it down. I would listen all day to coded messages, messages like Wujaszek is searching\nfor the little girl who untied his shoelaces -- only usually shorter. Or there would be lists of\nnames. The following are documented to have died in Treblinka and then an hour of names.\nHe would come home, what do you have? While I was doing that, he was going to various\nagencies, searching and looking and authenticating and documenting deaths and looking for\nsurvivors. There were none. Finally one day he said that\u2019s it. We got into one of those boxcars\nof which there is a photograph that I gave you. It\u2019s only many years later in the United States\nthat I realized what was written on the exterior of that boxcar. It\u2019s in English and in Hebrew. It\nsays \u201cTo Liberty.\u201d And \u201cFrom Auschwitz to New York.\u201d You know when I arrived in the United\nStates I didn\u2019t speak any English whatsoever. I knew two words; they were okay and I reasoned\nthat if okay meant yes then obviously nokay meant no.",
        "Q: The little schooling you had would have been...?",
        "A: The little schooling I had was at the knee of the Ukrainian mother. A little bit of schooling in\nthe village but only until 1t got too cold for me to walk barefoot to the school because I had no\nshoes Then in the D.P. camp to which we went in that boxcar and the D.P. camp was in Munich.\nWe were in the D.P. camp for, I can\u2019t tell you how long, maybe a year or more. In the D.P.\ncamp, Jacob had the job of being in charge of the social hall which meant he was the electrician,\nthe plumber; he set up the chairs, he took them down, he was the stage manager and he was the\nemcee of all the various goings on. Being handsome and charming and witty, he was the\nperfect emcee. I went to school in the morning but school was mostly the learning of Hebrew.\nBecause most of the people in the D.P. camp, all of them, were going to Palestine. It was kind\nof embarrassing or shameful to admit that we were going to America. So I went to school and\nstudied Hebrew. When I came to the United States, I spoke Polish, Russian, Ukrainian. I could\nunderstand Greek, a little bit of Hebrew, a little bit of German and somewhat more, I was able\nto understand but not speak fluently, Yiddish. If I\u2019m not mistaken, that\u2019s seven languages.",
        "Q: Had you known any Yiddish before?",
        "A: Well, my grandparents in their home spoke Yiddish and Polish so I heard it. There was no\nYiddish spoken between my parents. Of course, I heard it after my experience in the Ukraine as\nwe were displaced persons traveling from place to place. I left out one part of the story and I\nwill tell it to you as briefly as I can. The one part of my story which I never really told and the\nreason I\u2019m telling you now is that earlier today, I told it in front of my children. It\u2019s the first\ntime my children ever heard it. So now I feel at liberty to tell it to the world. It\u2019s not something\nof which I\u2019m proud of but it\u2019s a significant part of my life. My father left us. I can\u2019t with all\nhonesty say that he deserted us. But it sure felt that way. My father was a blue- eyed blond.\nMy father was a linguist, he was fluent in German and he could pass. Whereas, he promised to\nsend for us, he didn\u2019t. It could easily have been impossible. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ll ever know.\nBut I resented my father and when my mother became Berliner again, changing her name back\nto her maiden name, I simply went along with that. I went along with my mother\u2019s attitude\nabout my father which wasn\u2019t generous. It wasn\u2019t severe or bad either but their last months\ntogether were not affectionate. So I felt that my father had betrayed and deserted me\nthroughout the war and I never thought about him. In the D.P. camp, while Jacob was working\nat the duties in the social hall which was an all day and evening job, I went to school in the\nmorning where I studied Hebrew. Then when school ended in the morning, I would have lunch\nwith Jacob and then I was free in the afternoon. Now Jacob told me that we were going to go to\nAmerica on a ship across a big ocean. The ship would sway back and forth and there was a\ngood possibility that I would be seasick. I had never been seasick but he described it. To avoid\nthat, it would be a wonderful idea if I acclimated myself to the swaying motion by going to the\nplayground and spending my time on the swings. So I spent every afternoon on the swings.\nNow the swings faced a cyclone fence. On the opposite side of the fence, this was Munich,\nthere was a bench, a bus stop and in the afternoon a bus would come. Now I sat on the swings,\nswinging back and forth every day. Every day about an hour before the bus came, or half an\nhour, an old woman would come and she would sit on the bench and she would take out of her\nbag, a little package of crumbs. She would throw the crumbs to the little birds, pigeons, or\nwhatever it was. She would turn around and she would nod to me. This happened afternoon\nafter afternoon so finally we began to chat. Then one day she said to me, why are you spending\nso much time on the swings? So I explained I\u2019m going on a long voyage on a ship. I\u2019m going to\nAmerica and I know that I\u2019m going to get seasick and I explained the whole thing. She said,\nyou know, I have a brother in America. Some day, I\u2019m going to go to my brother when my\nquota number comes up. I said well if you\u2019re going to go on a ship, then you will be wise to get\nacclimated to the swaying also. From then on, instead of feeding the birds and sitting on the\nbench, she would come inside and she would sit on the swings. We would swing back and forth\ncriss-crossing each other and chatting away. One day as displaced persons do, we began to talk\nabout our backgrounds.. She began to ask me questions. What is your name, who are you,\nwhere are you from? I told her about my life before the blitzkrieg in Warsaw, my father had\nbeen a violinist and a violin teacher. She said tell me his name. I told her his name. The next\nday she returned and we sat on the swings and she said to me, tell me, do you have any marks\non your body? Anything that could identify you? Anything that\u2019s different from anything that\nanybody in the world has? I said yes. I have a beauty mark on my right forearm, shoulder.\nWhen I was a little girl, my grandfather used to tease me by making believe he took the beauty\nmark off my right forearm until I began to cry. Then he\u2019d say, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, I'll give it\nback. Then he would give it back to me on my left forearm or shoulder and I would look and\nthere it would be. So she left and came back the next day and she said, that was a very\ninteresting story about your grandfather but isn\u2019t there anything else on your body, any scars,\nanything that\u2019s different and unique? I said well, I don\u2019t like to talk about it but we have a\nfamily trait and I was born with it also. We have six toes. My uncle Jacob has six toes on one\nfoot. When I was born, I had six toes on each foot. They were surgically removed and I have a\nscar on each foot. The next day the woman came and brought my father. I don\u2019t know where\nhe survived but I think in Germany. Well my father insisted that I stay with him but we were\ngoing to sail two weeks hence. Having waited for our quota number, having found the uncle in\nAmerica. I mean all of these -- years of waiting and uncle Jacob said absolutely not. They\nargued and uncle Jacob had the same resentment or appeared to have the same resentment\ntowards my father that my mother had had. I didn\u2019t show him great warmth.",
        "Q: Did you recognize him?",
        "A: Oh, of course, of course. So they argued and finally uncle Jacob said to me, okay, it\u2019s her\nchoice. Of course I insisted on going to America. Well about a year later, my father followed\nme and he knew where we were. By the time he came a year later I had begun to -- I had not\nbegun -- I had succeeded to a great extent in assimilating into American life, just like the\nchameleon I learned to be in the Ukraine. I did, once again, of necessity, in the United States.. I\nhad arrived here on June 24. By September, I was in school. On my first day of school, I called\nthe teacher outside and said to her something like I am greenhorn, do not call on me, I will not\nanswer. When I am ready, I will raise my hand. Then you call me. Shake? We shook hands\nand she never called on m until I raised my hand only a very short time later. I remember the\namazement of the class and the round of applause. I even remember the question and the\nanswer.",
        "Q: Garbo talks.",
        "A: Something like that. Anyway, suddenly my father shows up and he wants to take me back -- he\nwants to make an immigrant of me again. He doesn\u2019t speak a word of English, I\u2019m going to be\nliving again with displaced persons who\u2019 ve just arrived somewhere in Brooklyn, where I have a\nlife. My name is Berliner. I\u2019m starting to have friends. I speak English, \u2019 ve grown, having\ngone from the smallest child in the class to the tallest, all in one semester. I\u2019m appearing in\ntheir amateur hour and winning a prize doing my krazotsky and singing Russian songs.\nSuddenly he wants to take me -- he wants to turn the clock around, back to when I\u2019m going to\nbe da greena, look, the greena! Which was pejorative. Of course, 50 years of time have turned\nthe greena a pejorative into the survivor. This exalted, you know as if I did something\nphenomenal, I simply lived. Just like that little dress, that schmata that I\u2019ve had for 50 years\ntoday became an artifact.",
        "Q: Just a dress.",
        "A: No, it was a schmata, trust me, a schmata. Now they have it hermetically sealed or G__ knows\nwhat and it\u2019ll be there for a thousand years or whatever, ina museum. Oh my G_, it\u2019s\nincredible what 50 years will do. But there was my father and he wanted to undo the year of\nvery hard adjustment. So I said no. He argued with my aunt and uncle. I now was living with\nthe rich uncle in America and his American wife and going to school in Forest Hills, Long\nIsland, P.S.3. My teacher was Mrs Riskin and the principal was Mrs. Morris. My G__, how do\nyou remember all that Miki? Anyway I didn\u2019t want to go back with my father. My father\npersisted and now my birthday came and my father sent me a gift. Actually a very beautiful\ngift. A box of oil paints and brushes. However he addressed it Mirka -- I still can\u2019t say it, his\nlast name -- in care of Berlinrer. I was mortified because the mailman knew and the doorman\nmight know. The girl who lived on the floor below might find out. Everyone might find out and\noh my G __, it\u2019s all going -- he\u2019s going to turn it all around for me. They\u2019ll start to point at me\nagain and I\u2019ll be da greena again. And there was huge arguments between my aunt and uncle\nand my father who persisted. Then my uncle offered my father the -- he said he wanted to\nlegally adopt me. It didn\u2019t mean that my father couldn\u2019t have a relationship with me, we could\nhave any relationship that we mutually wanted. I could visit him, I could go on a travel with\nhim or whatever. But he wanted to legally adopt me to give me the benefits of his moderate\nwealth and American citizenship and so forth. Of course my father refused. The arguments\nwent back and forth. Then one day my father sent a letter which named a sum of money for\nwhich he would sign the adoption papers. That caused my aunt and uncle to tell him to get lost.\nConsequently, I was not adopted until I was 21. Now I already told you the story of the\nchocolate bar and how the UNRRA gave the monthly packages and the family who had a child\nunder ten received the added chocolate bar. So my uncle Jacob registered me as being a year\nyounger. Consequently, I was really, in fact, 22 when I became free to sign the papers myself\nand I became a citizen in that year. I was also engaged to my husband who gave me an\nengagement ring on the very anniversary of my arrival in the United States which was June 24.",
        "Q: That was the anniversary ?",
        "A: Exactly, well yes, this is June 12. It\u2019s really strange that so many events and things have\nhappened to me in June. Today was a wonderful day and a very beautiful weekend at which I\nhave my family with me. My husband, my daughter Mural, my daughter-in-law,Gina and my\nson Andy. We are staying in a beautiful suite, in a lovely hotel in Washington and the sun is\nshining. And I\u2019ve survived the ordeal of this tape and life is wonderful.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s hope it remains so.",
        "A: Thank you very much.",
        "Q: Thank you. This is still June 12, 1992 and we\u2019re about to add a postscript to our interview.",
        "A: Yes, a tiny anecdote which might help to clarify the date. My uncle and I and his two suitcases\nwere somewhere. It was in the middle of winter and we were in a tiny railroad station. It\nwasn\u2019t a big city railroad station. There weren\u2019t platforms, you know train platforms. It was a\ntrack and there was a little tiny building and inside the building it was just one room smaller, or\nperhaps the size of this room which is 12 by 20 or 15 or something like that. In the corner, there\nwas a potbelly stove and there was a desk and on the desk was one of those tick-tick machines,\nwhat is that? A telegraph, right. Okay, thank you. There was a guy who sat huddled up next to\nthe pot-bellied stove with this telegraph machine. In the back of the room, sitting on the floor,\nwhen we came in from a blizzard, walked into this building... I don\u2019t know where we came\nfrom, I don\u2019t remember how we got there. I know it was a blizzard...",
        "Q: This was shortly after you had been taken...?",
        "A: After he found me, okay, and we were going somewhere. We were going to wait for a train.\nThe train is going somewhere and we\u2019re going to wait for a train. It\u2019s night, it\u2019s a blizzard. It\u2019s\nnight, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s freezing. We walk from whatever conveyance brought us to this station. I\nremember seeing the little building with the light inside and so forth. Anyway we walk in, a\nblizzard of snow flies in with us. There\u2019s this guy sitting at the desk and there are maybe half a\ndozen people who look like ruffians, men, very rough looking characters sitting on the floor.\nSome are smoking, and they are sort of lounging on the floor on bundles, obviously waiting for\nthe train. We walk in and Jacob is very well dressed and he has these two important looking\nsuitcases and this little child all bundled up. We walk in and there was one other item which I\nforgot, extremely important. The guy at the desk has this telegraph machine and a small radio\nwith a great deal of static and he\u2019s listening to this radio. We come in and we sit separate from\nthese rough looking men. Jacob goes and talks to the man and explains to him that we want to\nget on the train. The man argues with Jacob and says no, no, you can\u2019t get on the train. They\nargue back and forth. Jacob offers him goods, whatever, he\u2019ll pay. The man says no, no. Jacob\nsays what about these men? No, they\u2019re going to sit on top of the cars on the roof of the cars\nand you have a child and those boxes and you can\u2019t... Jacob pleads with him and suddenly the\nradio starts crackling and the man says, quiet, quiet, listen. They all listen and suddenly the\nmen jump up and run to the radio and they crowd around and I have no idea what 1s going on.\nThe static and the men are all excited and suddenly they all begin to cheer, Warsaw 1s liberated!",
        "Q: That would have been January 1945.",
        "A: G___ bless you, thank you so much. Isn\u2019t it wonderful, it\u2019s so great. You see, I really belong in\nhistory! Anyway, Jacob opened one of his suitcases and he took out the most treasured of all\nthe possessions, a bottle of vodka! We passed it around, everybody drank from it, these\nruffians...",
        "Q: Did you?",
        "A: No. The ruffians became our best friends. Suddenly in the middle of this revelry, we heard the\ntrain, toot, toot. The train came and we all rushed outside and the man behind the desk said to\nJacob, listen these men are going on the roof. But if you will do it, you can stand in front of the\nlocomotive. There\u2019s a little guardrail. You\u2019ll stand, hold on to the guardrail. Your little girl will\nstand in front of you. Put your coat around her. Remember, we\u2019ll tie the suitcases on front of\nthe locomotive and remember you\u2019re going to be heading directly into the storm. I don\u2019t\nguarantee that you won\u2019t freeze to death but if you want this train, that\u2019s it. We got on the front\nof the locomotive. Jacob -- I stood in front of him against the guardrail. Jacob\u2019s coat was\nwrapped around me. I leaned against him. The train took off into this blinding snowstorm and\nI don\u2019t know where we went but we were happy.",
        "Q: You know this scene reminds me of you and your mother and David on the truck, not knowing\nwhere you were going.",
        "A: It\u2019s the same, it\u2019s the same. But you see, I fit into this context of time, that\u2019s so exciting! Iam\nso excited. I can\u2019t tell you, it\u2019s so important. January 1945. Fantastic!",
        "Q: How long had you been in this village? You were liberated shortly before this date?",
        "A: Yes, because it was winter, it\u2019s all winter, right?",
        "Q: Yes. You were there two and a half years?",
        "A: Yeah,",
        "Q: So that would have been, let\u2019s see, sometime in \u201942, summer.",
        "A: Summer of \u201942. My G___it sounds like a movie with Elvis Presley or somebody, I don\u2019t know,\nwhatever. That\u2019s it.",

I know only that he came\nfrom a family of intellectuals, professors, linguists and I don\u2019t know what all. I do remember\nhis parents. I remember meeting them once. I remember going to their home, I remember the\nroom that I was in. I remember that there was a red oriental rug, very highly patterned,\nintricately patterned and the walls were lined with books.. That was very impressive because\nfirst of all, I had never seen anything quite like it and second of all because my father\u2019s parents,\nlike my father, were very short. They were even much shorter than my father was. I remember\nthat --the room so clearly because I remember thinking how do they reach those books which\nwent so high up. The ceilings in Europe were very high and I don\u2019t remember and I was very\nsmall.",
        "A: No, I was walking on the rug. I had to be four years at that point. I remember thinking how\ncould my grandfather who was so pale and delicate looking climb? There were ladders on each\nside of the room, which I guess must have been on wheels or however those things worked. But\nI remember imagining how could my grandfather who looked so frail and tiny reach those\nbooks. That\u2019s the impression that I have of my grandparents and I remember absolutely nothing\nelse about them nor do I know anything about them. Only that my father was an only child.\nHowever, my mother\u2019s side of the family, I remember very clearly. And they were exactly the\nopposite in every conceivable way. They were very loud and noisy and gregarious. My mother\nwas the youngest of eight siblings. There were nine originally, one died at a young age, maybe\nin childhood, I really don\u2019t know. But she was one of five daughters, she was the youngest, and\nthree sons. The oldest child was a daughter, the oldest child, my mother\u2019s sister, married a\nphysician who was her childhood sweetheart and they moved to Russia. This would have to\nhave been in the twenties. They had two daughters who I know became -- one became a\nmerchant ship captain, captain of a merchant ship and the other daughter, this would have been\nmy cousin, became, I believe, a physician. But that entire part of the family was lost to the\nother, to the rest of the family because they were in Russia. So I know nothing ...",
        "A: --Soviet exactly. So I don\u2019t know any more about them but I imagine that these two cousins,\nanyway, who would probably be twenty or thirty years older than I am, might still be living. I\nimagine my cousin is a sea captain, provocative thought. Hopefully their descendents are living\nsomewhere in Russia and hopefully they\u2019re enjoying a peaceful life. The rest of the brothers and\nsisters -- all the sisters married and all of my mother\u2019s sisters, all four of my mother\u2019s sisters\nhad families of three or more children. And all of those families perished. Of the three\nbrothers, the oldest was banished to Siberia with his wife and child. He survived the war and it\nwas he who later found me where I was hidden in the Ukraine, where I survived. The other\ntwo brothers -- the middle brother escaped sometime during the first World War and the story\ngoes that he was, what\u2019s the word? ... He punched a senior in the jaw for some reason.",
        "A: In the Polish army. He was in the Polish cavalry. The Polish cavalry during the first World War\nwas kind of interesting because if you could afford your own boots, or at least this is what I am\ntold, if you could afford a fancy uniform with boots and so forth, you sort of automatically\nbecame an officer. If you could afford to bring your own horse, you became an officer in the\ncavalry. So he was a horseman and he had the means to afford all this grand stuff. So he was\nan officer in the Polish cavalry. He was quite rebellious and kind of a smart ass and apparently\nhe got into some, I don\u2019t know, fracas, and punched out a senior officer and they were going to\nshoot him for insubordination. He jumped over the wall, I don\u2019t know, I may be romanticizing\nthis. These are facts that I was told and eventually escaped and made his way to America where\nthere was some distant relative who took him under his wing. Morris Berliner, this middle\nuncle became in later years, the rich uncle in America. He\u2019s the one that we came to, he was\nour sponsor in the United States. The youngest of my three uncles who was just the next sibling\nto my mother, my mother was the younger and he was next; he was Martin Berliner. He and his\nbride -- he was a student in Paris -- he went to college there and became an engineer. He and\nhis new bride were fortunate enough to have come to the United States in 1939 on the last ship\nwhich was admitted into New York harbor. So he was a surprise to us when we arrived here\nbecause we had no idea of his whereabouts at all.",
        "A: Possibly. I don\u2019t remember him at all.",
        "A: Well. yeah. Also he was in Paris. He was a student in Paris. Although he was very close with\nmy mother because they were closest in age, I didn\u2019t know him. Or if I knew him, it would\nhave been only very casually, very briefly. But my uncle Jacob, the oldest was closest in the\nfamily to my mother. The two were each other\u2019s confidant, they were friends. They were\nfriends, socially. They just had a very close friendship even though they were a number of --\nquite a number of years apart, perhaps fifteen years apart. And he was her protector and he\nloved her a lot.",
        "A: Yes, he remained in Warsaw and he remained in my grandfather\u2019s business. He ran the finances\nof the business and apparently one of the reasons that he was so -- that he did that is because he\nwas so honest and so trustworthy and so forth. He was the kind of the controller and the\nbusiness head of the business. My grandfather was part inventor, entrepreneur and dreamer and\nmy grandfather ... For example, my grandfather was the first to introduce fresh fruit juice or\nsyrup to carbonated water. That juice was raspberry and he was at the beginning of creating\nfruit flavored soft drinks, sparkling soft drinks. The fledgling company which he called Fraise,\nthe French word for raspberries because that was the first fruit flavoring that he experimented\nwith, with his carbonated water.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember at all. I don\u2019t remember that at all. But I remember that life at my\ngrandparent\u2019s kind of revolved around the siphons. I remember their home -- I have wonderful\nmemories of my grandparents\u2019 home and here comes the lump in my throat. My grandparents\u2019\nhome was sort of on the outskirts of Warsaw. My uncle Martin, the youngest of the brothers,\nwas interviewed for a book, \u2018Voices of the Holocaust\u2019 and I believe, in that interview is the -- if\nnot the address, the location of, you know. I\u2019m not very good with the names and the places\nbecause I was so young. But that information is known. And apparently my grandfather, who\nwas extremely tall, unusually tall, he was the tallest member of the entire family. My\ngrandmother was quite small and she had beautiful blue eyes, she was the only one with blue\neyes. She had a beautiful singing voice which could have been operatic but she preferred just to\nshare her singing talents with her family. She was the family songbird. She sang all the time as\nshe cooked and so forth. My grandfather was extremely, highly respected in the community.\nHe was sort of the unofficial Jewish mayor of the area and was the ... He was the one who kind\nof communicated with the official government and the gentile community. He was the -- I can\u2019t\nthink of the word. Well, anyway \u2014",
        "A: Yes, exactly. Well, more than that, he was also kind of the wise man. People came to him for\nadvice and he settles disputes. He loaned people money. He was very loved and respected.",
        "A: He was truly that and looked the part too. He was a great big tall man with a white beard. Oh,\nand I have a wonderful photograph of them too, if your archives might be interested, of my\ngrandfather and grandmother. Oh,G__, They\u2019re gorgeous!",
        "A: I believe my grandparents were ...",
        "A: Yes, I know really nothing about my father\u2019s side. Everything I\u2019ve told you is everything I\nknow and there is no more. But my -- I think my grandparents were probably orthodox . I\ndon\u2019t know that but I think so. My grandmother also has a wonderful reputation. She took the\nteachings of the Torah rather literally in some respects. Every Friday and on every holiday, she\nwould go and collect beggars from the street and she would feed them in her kitchen. On the\nhigh holy days, she invited them to share our holiday meal in our dining room. I remember my\ngrandmother\u2019s dining which because she had eight children, all of whom were married and had\nchildren of their own; the table could seat I don\u2019t know how many people, maybe twenty. I\nremember the beautiful crystal chandelier which hung over it. I remember a little story of a\npeasant from the Ukraine who came to work as a sort of maid, or I don\u2019t know, helper, and my\ngrandmother told this servant to go and turn out the light in the dining room. When the servant\ndidn\u2019t reappear for a long time, my grandmother went to search and found this peasant standing\non top of the table trying to blow out the electric lights in the chandelier. So I remember little\nantidotal facts like that. Stop me from telling you these stories because it will take me forever.",
        "A: Well my father was a teacher. He taught at one of the universities. I really am not sure which,\neither the University of Warsaw -- there were two universities, I believe. I think he might have\ntaught in the smaller of the two because there was great anti-Semitism at that time and difficulty\nwithin the university system. So he might not have taught in the Warsaw University but I\u2019m not\nreally sure. In any case, he also gave private lessons at home. My father was not successful in\nthe field of making money. He was kind of a disappointment and disgrace within the family\nbecause my mother\u2019s family was all very aggressive and very well to do. Everybody did\nexceedingly well and apparently they thought that that was very important and everyone was\ntalented in a different way but everyone was sort of well off. My mother was not. It was very\ndisappointing to the family that my mother married my father because she married him on the\nrebound. She had been in love with a local boy who apparently was a great Zionist and gave\nher the choice of -- or asked her to go with him to build Palestine. When she refused to leave\nthe family nest and go to such a faraway place, he left without her. I\u2019ve often wondered which\nhero in the State of Israel might have been my mother\u2019s childhood sweetheart and so I\nromanticize about that. Anyway on the rebound my mother married one f her teachers. My\nfather was quite a bit older than my mother and it was against my mother\u2019s family\u2019s wishes that\nshe rebelliously married him. I was their only child.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know. My mother was very young so I imagine they were just married a a short\ntime and I was their first child. In 1939 when I was four, I remember with great clarity, the\nblitzkrieg. I mentioned that my grandparents lived on the outskirts of Warsaw in a section, the\nname of which I don\u2019t remember. And we lived, my mother and father and I, in an apartment\nthat I can describe to you in detail, the apartment building and, in fact, a little bit of our\napartment too, but I won\u2019t. In any case -- well, I'll describe only this much. That it was a red\nbrick building and was built with a courtyard inside but I think a lot of buildings in Europe\nwere. That there were iron gates through which you entered the courtyard. The gate, the handle\nof the gate was a monkey\u2019s paw. I don\u2019t even know though if that\u2019s all that unusual. But I\nremember that clearly and I remember that gypsies came and entertained and there was a gypsy\nwagon. The people leaned out of the windows and looked down into the courtyard and threw\ncoins down. I remember that very well. The circus troupe came and I remember that. I\nremember looking out of the window and I remember that a line was strung from window to\nwindow. I looked out of the window one morning and a ballerina was walking on a rope, right\nin front of my window.",
        "A: Across the courtyard. I remember that she held an umbrella and she smiled at me. I looked\ndown and there was a bear standing on its hind legs and clowns. It\u2019s such a clear memory, you\nknow.",
        "A: A visiting circus in the courtyard. And the people threw down coins and that\u2019s how they were\npaid, these itinerant entertainers.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t know. In any case. I do remember that there was a\ntrolley. We took a trolley to my grandparent\u2019s house. The trolley, there was a kind of circle.\nThe trolley was turned on a -- like a lazy susan. And that -- that was the end of the line.",
        "A: That was where we lived, at the end of this trolley line. We went all the way to the other end of\nthe trolley line where there was another turn-a-round. Within a walk from there was where my\ngrandparents lived. So I could probably look on an old map of Warsaw and identify where both\ndwellings were.",
        "A: You do?",
        "A: Really?",
        "A: I'd like that.",
        "A: Thank you. Oh dear, -----",
        "A: Well, I won\u2019t go into detail bout the apartment. It\u2019s not really all that critical. What I remember\nwas that very hurriedly getting out of it with a lot of bundles and having a ..... My father, I\nmust tell you, my early memories of my father are incredibly warm. My father never raised his\nvoice. My father would play with me on the floor with toys and make -- he was very artistic,\napparently and very creative. We played with different colored clay which we made animals\nand whatever, you know. My father would spend hours in play with me whereas my mother\nwas always busy. She was always baking and cooking and sewing and knitting and doing all\nsorts of -- she was always busy. She was always going in and out and coming and shopping and\ngoing. My father spent a lot of time at home, probably waiting for students or doing -- marking\npapers or whatever he did. In any case, I remember that he and I spent a lot of time in my\nchildhood. I remember my fourth birthday. I remember about it that my father had decorated\nthe entire house with streamers that he had made into... He had cut different colored shiny\npaper, very shiny paper of different colors and he made chain by gluing loops of varied colors.\nHe decorated the room, I guess it was, with these paper chains which hung from the ceiling in\nloops and around the walls and so forth. I remember that, I don\u2019t know, 20 children or whatever\nof my age came and they all brought presents. I had a hysterical fit because I had received two\nsets of dominos and I lay on the floor and kicked and had a tantrum. How wonderful and\nunderstanding my father was and how impatient and annoyed with the whole nonsense, my\nmother was. So my mother was a kind of down to business personality, probably like I am.\nAnd my father was soft and sort of a dreamer. It fits -- the memory that I have of him -- fits\nwith the family version of what he was, which they sort of feel was sort of a failure.",
        "A: An idealist or whatever and an intellectual, he spoke many languages, among them German,\nwith great fluency. He was a poet, he read and wrote poetry and so on and so forth. He was an\nintellectual. My mother was more of an earth mother.",
        "A: We spoke Polish, a very intellectual Polish. Everyone was very well educated. My mother\u2019s\nbrothers and sisters were all very involved in the arts. Each one had a different interest. One in\ntheater, another one in opera and another one in, oh, I don\u2019t know this and that, whatever. All of\nthe guests and friends and so forth and their individual circles of friends were all, you know,\nfamous. They were all celebrity sort of people in the arts. At parties, they were all well known\n-- they were sort of the jet set of -- you know, of the time.",
        "A: No, no. I was not. I was four years old. I was not. I just remember sitting on the floor and\ndrawing or making, playing with clay. I remember cooking with my mother, baking. My\nmother -- I remember the cookies she baked. I think they\u2019re called Linser tarts or tortes or\nsomething like that. They\u2019re little round -- they were made little round cookies with some jelly\nand then a second cookie with a hole in it on top. That was one she made a lot. Then she made\na cookie which a friend of my father\u2019s who visited quite frequently, I believe he was a\nprofessor, Professor Zuckerman, which means sugar man. These were cookies with coarse\nsugar sprinkled on top and my mother used to call them -- because this gentleman particularly\nenjoyed those cookies -- so she called those Zuckerman cookies. I remember making those\nwith her. I remember sitting -- preparations in my grandmother\u2019s kitchen for the holidays. I\nremember my mother and her sisters and my grandmother all baking and cooking and I\nremember the challahs that they made. These great long challahs braided with a little braid on\ntop. They always made a little one for me or they gave me dough to play with. I remember that\nthey sat me in a high chair kind of across the -- from, you know, the opposite side of the room\nfrom where the ovens were, the heat was. To entertain me, they would say, Mirka, open your\nmouth. They would fling a raisin across the room and I loved raisins and I would open my\nmouth and try to catch the raisin. There were great peals of laughter when it hit my nose or\nnever reached near or whatever it was. I just remember that with such clarity, it\u2019s incredible and\nI was four years old. Then I recall that we left our apartment in great haste, schlepping all sorts\nof bundles. I remember a big hysterical fight with my mother because I insisted on bringing my\nfavorite possession which was an enormous teddy bear, almost my own size. It was a Stief\nteddy bear and my grandmother had bought this teddy bear on the day I was born and gave it to\nmy mother. I grew up with this teddy bear and he was my companion and I remember that I\ncalled that teddy bear by my grandfather\u2019s name which was David. And that teddy bear had to\ngo with me. We left the apartment and I don\u2019t remember by what means we got there. I doubt\nthat it was the trolley. I don\u2019t remember that part but we arrived in my grandparents\u2019 home\nwhere there was enormous excitement in the courtyard, the factory, the house and the people\nwho worked in the factory all lived in surrounding little bungalows on their land. There was\nenormous excitement, people being loaded into trucks and also into the horse drawn carts which\nhad been used to deliver the soda all over Poland and probably all over, I don\u2019t know, Eastern\nEurope. Everybody was getting into trucks and there were sirens and the light was fading.\nThen I remember being pushed up into the back of an open truck. I remember my uncle being\ntold to drive and orders being yelled at my father -- I just remember the entire scene and I...",
        "A: I had David and I sat on my mother\u2019s lap. I remember my mother put her hands -- I sat in her\nlap with my back against her breast. My mother put her hands in front of my face trying to\nshield my eyes and I tore at her fingers trying to get a view of this incredible thing that was\ngoing on. Huge explosions of light streaking across the sky and fireballs and explosions and\nnoise and whistling and screaming! And the horses screaming and automobiles horns and\npeople screaming and bundles flying! All this made excitement and then we moved out in a\ncaravan and joined a -- did you ever see ants following in a trail making a road? Well, that\u2019s\nhow we were -- like a river of humanity in carts and horses, on foot and screaming and it got\ndarker and darker. And then behind the skyline of the city, fires and explosions and that\u2019s how\nwe left Warsaw and life as I knew it, ended.",
        "A: Probably not. Could we take a break? I need a glass of water.",
        "A: ... people who take care of the horses and there were people who worked in the factory. Then\nthere were these cabins on the land where the workers lived and whole families lived there. My\ngrandfather sort of took care of all these people and these people were all peasants. Most of\nthem came from the Ukraine. They came and they lived there and they worked and then they\nwould go home and some relatives would be sent back and so forth. Whole families lived from\nmy grandfather and his... But my grandfather was very involved with his horses and his big\ndream was to have a team of horses -- you know the Clydesdale horses that, you know, deliver\nthe beer, I\u2019ve forgotten.\nA? Budweiser beer. Well these were teams of horses like that. I mean they weren\u2019t Clydesdales\nwith the feathered feet but they were just teams of big brown...",
        "A: Right and they were all dark, big dark horses. But my grandfather\u2019s dream was to have at least\none team of all white horses. I remember that -- and my grandfather fought this new fangled\nbusiness of using trucks. He was enamored of his horses and the idea of the horses and having\nthe white team of horses. He bought -- he kept buying white horses and each time he had a\nfailure. The horse would get sick and die or break a leg or whatever happened and he could\nnever quite collect a team of horses. I remember an incident before the blitzkrieg. He had just\nbought a new white horse, a stallion, I don\u2019t know, whatever. He was very proud of this huge\nwhite horse. I remember being shown this horse along with my mother and father. My uncle\nJacob who was the, I, told you before, the oldest and he was the controller, was very proud of\nthis horse. My grandfather led the horse out of the stable and into the central courtyard of his\ndomain and walked the horse around. He said to Jacob, here you take the horse or whatever it\nwas. Anyway the horse -- and I remember this and it\u2019s a very important story a little later in my\nlife -- the horse reared up and kicked my uncle Jacob in the chest. He bucked, you know, with\nhis hind foot, he hit uncle Jacob in the chest and knocked uncle Jacob unconscious. They\ncarried uncle Jacob into the house. I remember that back room through which we would go -- it\nwas in the back of the house and faced the courtyard. The front of the house where we lived\nwas a little more formal. But you see, the soda manufacturing plant was in the back and the\ncourtyard was all earth, no concrete. So when it rained, it was sort of muddy. Also inside the\nsoda manufactory, it was all water. So the plant was -- had boards nailed together, you know,\nwooden....",
        "A: Planks so that the water could go through and underneath. All the workers wore wooden shoes,\nyou know, like the Dutch shoes. So they would leave their shoes at home and everybody had\nsort of a little mud room and they would put on wooden shoes and then go into the manufactory,\nyou know, through the courtyard and into the manufactory and work. Then, when they came\nhome, they would leave those wooden shoes in the mud rooms and put on their shoes or boots\nor whatever they had. Well, our mud room was -- my grandmother\u2019s mud room -- was this big\nroom and it had hooks on the wall on which coats hung and then sort of shelves underneath that\nwhere the wooden shoes sat when they weren\u2019t in use or the boots, you know. There was a\nleather sort of a bed. It wasn\u2019t a sofa, it was like a flat low thing. I guess they must have sat\nthere to put on their boots. So when my uncle Jacob was kicked by the horse, they carried him\ninto this mud room and they put him on this leather sofa bed or whatever it was...",
        "A: A cot, yeah, I guess, cot. Well, it was more elegant than a cot. It was a big upholstered thing.",
        "A: But it was leather, yeah. It was dark leather, brown leather. I mean I remember that thing. You\nknow I remember the squeak of the hinge of that back door. I can hear it in my memory. The\nroom where I slept when I stayed at my grandmother\u2019s must have been above or somewhere\nnear that door. Because I remember it opening and closing in the morning when my grandfather\nwent into the factory and my grandmother went out to get the chickens or whatever it was.",
        "A: Yes, and I loved being there. And I guess because my parents worked, you know. My mother\nmust have worked and my father, I don\u2019t know -- I must have spent a lot of time there and I\nliked it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I really don\u2019t remember any interaction with horses.",
        "A: Well, I remember being awed, but you know.... I remember spending my time with the cooking\nand that sort of thing, in the kitchen sort of and around my aunts. I remember being in the\nfactory. My grandfather must have taken me there. I remember sitting behind their house on\nbig barrels. He had big barrels which must have contained something to do with the soda plant.\nI don\u2019t know, whatever fruit or, I don\u2019t know, whatever it was. We would sit there on the barrels\nin the sun. That part of the house faced south. In the afternoon, the sun was there. My\ngrandfather and I would sit there and he would tell me stories. I remember one day, he gave me\nHanukkah gelt. I remember he was explaining to me about Hanukkah gelt and I just remember\nhim giving me coins and sitting in the sun and talking about Hanukkah gelt while inside\nwonderful things were being cooked and delicious smells were coming out of the windows and\nacross the courtyard. Anyway, getting back to the story of my uncle Jacob being kicked by the\nhorse, I remember -- oh now -- uncle Jacob, because he was the controller, he wasn\u2019t really\ninvolved in the factory nor the stables. He was in the office so he didn\u2019t wear wooden shoes or\nboots. He wore shoes with laces, you know, like a businessman. So when he went out into the\ncourtyard, it must have been a muddy situation because he was wearing his shoes. When they\nbrought him in and laid him on the couch, I remember, while they were all running around\nexcitedly calling for doctors and what should we do? You undo his belt and you get cold water\nto put on his forehead and blah, blah. My aunts and everybody was quite hysterical. I\nremember untying his shoelaces. I don\u2019t know why I remember doing that but that\u2019s what I did\nwhile they were all -- they were undoing him and I undid his shoelaces. Years later, when uncle\nJacob found me, he -- well shall I tell you about it later or shall I tell 1t now? He said to me, do\nyou know me? I said of course I know you. He said but you were so little when you saw me\nlast, how do you know me? I said well I remember you perfectly and then I told him this story.\nHe was amazed because he figured out that I couldn\u2019t have been three. I must have been like\ntwo and a half when this happened because he knew when it was before the blitzkrieg because\nthat was probably the last time he saw me.. So I had to have been less than three years old. He\nfound it so amazing that my memory was so clear and that he remembered that and how much\nhe had loved me because I was the only -- I was the youngest of his nieces and was the only\nchild of his favorite baby sister. So I was very special and that act of taking off his shoes was\nvery special for him and the fact that I remember that with such clarity meant a great deal to\nhim. But Pll get back to that period later. The next couple of years of my life are very fuzzy.\nThe family all stayed together for a very brief period of time and then my grandparents insisted\non returning to Warsaw.",
        "A: Yes, the entire family and all the workers and everyone who lived there. Everybody -- we went\nin the truck because we -- the family went in the truck. But everyone else was given the cars\nand carts and horses. Take what --run for your lives -- take --save yourselves. Everybody got n\nthe road, we all got on the road and, I guess, dispersed on the road, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, the family was together in two open trucks. We stayed together. I don\u2019t know where we\nwent. I don\u2019t know. We left the city.",
        "A: I really honestly -- I don\u2019t know. I mean I\u2019m sure I went to sleep and I don\u2019t know and hours or\nyears could have elapsed... I really can\u2019t tell you, \u2019'm very fuzzy there. I only know -- I only\nremember isolated instances. I don\u2019t remember history, I remember antidotal sort of things.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. We were in cities. I know we were in cities. I remember, as I said,\nantidotal incidents. I'll tell you just a few and that might help. I remember that -- I know that\nmy mother\u2019s family were very close, as I have already indicated. Apparently my grandparents\ndecided that they wanted to die in Warsaw in their home and they insisted on going back. I\nknow that some of the sisters went back with them. I don\u2019t know where Jacob and his family\nwent or wound up and I learned later that he refused to sign the communist whatever -- he had\nto pledge -- and therefore he was banished to Siberia. The youngest brother, as I told you, was\nin Paris so he\u2019s out of the picture. Where the aunts all went, the four -- well one was in Russia\nwith her family so the other three, I don\u2019t know. They might have all returned to Warsaw with\nmy grandparents. I know there was another branch of the family in Pinsk. I know we went to\nPinsk, oh that helps, right? We went to Pinsk.",
        "A: That\u2019s the direction we -- oh thank you. You\u2019re helping me too. So that is where we went -- to\nPinsk. That\u2019s where we must have gone. I don\u2019t know if we went there immediately or what.\nThen I remember that my parents had furious arguments because my mother wanted to go back.",
        "A: To her parents, to her family, you know. They had horrible fights and didn\u2019t get along very\nwell. I remember screaming and whatever. Then we probably left Poland because I remember\nan incident where one night I heard my mother crying and my parents were arguing and I came\nout of bed. There was a fireplace, you know, most was the central heating most\nplaces in Europe. My parents were burning Polish money; they were burning the bills. My\nmother was crying because she was lamenting all the sacrifices that she had made to save this\nmoney. My father was telling her instead, forever the romantic, look at the beautiful colors of\nthe flames. Don\u2019t think about what it is. There is no paper in the world that burns as\nbeautifully as that. Look at it, look how it sparkles. Look, come here Mirka. Sit by the fire and\nwatch. Isn\u2019t that beautiful? You\u2019ll never see anything like this again as long as you live and of\ncourse I never have seen anyone burn money, particularly Polish money. I remember, oh my\nG___, 1 remember being with my parents once in some other city. We were in a community of\npeople and my mother -- we were on the edge of a forest. It was a city on the edge of a forest.\nMy mother knew about mushrooms. You know in Europe there are wild mushrooms, wild\nmushrooms are picked, there was much more interest in mushrooms that we have in the United\nStates and there was a great deal to know about them because some of them are poisonous and\nwhatever. Well, my mother apparently was a mushroom maven. A group was organized to go\nto the forest on a picnic and mushroom picking expedition. Several families went in a horse\ndrawn carriage and we drove to the edge of the woods -- or maybe two carriages, I don\u2019t\nremember. But anyway, we got to the edge of the woods and there was a little boy about my\nage and we had a picnic on blankets at the edge of the woods, a clearing in the woods, very\nsunny and pretty, clearing and grass. We had this lovely picnic. Then my mother told this little\nboy, you keep an eye on her. He was a little older. You take care of her and we\u2019re going into\nthe woods. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be back, you stay here and play right here. Don\u2019t go further than\nthis spot or whatever she told him. And he and I began to play and run around. We got to\nbushes suddenly, big bushy things and I said to him, look those are berries, they\u2019re raspberries,\nI\u2019m sorry, blueberries, you know, blueberries. He said, yes. There were several kinds of berries\ngrowing and we began to pick these berries and eat them and stuff our mouths with them. I had\non a dress with a pinafore or apron or something and I took the skirt and made a sort of pouch\nand held it in one hand and put the berries into my apron. He began to pull the berries off the\nbush and he climbed up and we had my apron filled when we heard some noise. Suddenly all\nthe adults came flying out of the forest and I was so excited to show my mother what I had\nfound. My mother started to scream, come it\u2019s raining and she took the berries and put them in\nsomething and she just -- there wasn\u2019t time to be excited. My mother was impatient. I already\ntold you that.",
        "A: Practical, yes. She said come, it\u2019s raining, it\u2019s beginning to rain. We started to go toward the --\nwhere our carriage, cart, horse cart was, and we began to walk in a line. The adults held up the\nblankets over our heads -- made like a ceiling of blankets. The little boy and I and there were\nseveral other children who were older and who had gone into the woods with the mushroom\npickers. We were among their feet, you know, underneath the blankets. The taller adults held\nthe blankets aloft over us on the four corners. Huge drops of rain and possibly hail began to\nfall. With that, two airplanes came flying out of the sky and strafed us and began to shoot. We\nscattered. They made a pass and my mother said, I remember my mother screaming something\nlike the blankets wouldn\u2019t protect us from bullets, scatter. We began to scatter and I wound up\nin a ditch. When the excitement of the planes and the noise and the bombs or whatever ended,\nthe little boy who had been picking berries with me was lying dead next to me. So that\u2019s an\nanecdote.",
        "A: No, I knew. I did understand. You know, it\u2019s like nobody ever explained the facts of life to me,\nnobody ever had a sex talk with me but I knew. Nobody ever explained the war to me, but I\nknew. I was old before my time and understood without explanation. I don\u2019t think I ever asked\na question. I remember men disappearing. I remember the gathering of jewelry to pay some\nkind of ransom. Somebody was imprisoned -- Zuckerman! Dr., Professor Zuckerman, we had\nto... My mother gave some jewelry and we collected jewelry because he was detained. We\nnever did get him back. I remember that. Shortly after that, my father went foraging for food\nsomewhere and he was in a farmer\u2019s field. They went to steal food from a farm at night. I\nremember my father coming back and saying that the soldiers were running -- were chasing\nthem and that he hid in a furrow, you know....",
        "A: Or something, I don\u2019t know, in a furrow on the farm between the rows of whatever was\ngrowing. And that a soldier stepped on the brim of his cap and very soon after that, my father\ndisappeared and my mother said that he had left and that he would send for us. My mother and\nI were left alone. I remember asking my mother, many, many times, when will father come for\nus or send for us. She always answered in exactly the same way. It\u2019s really one of the half\ndozen Polish words that I remember. She always said, Crusscoov and that means soon. But of\ncourse, he never came. Then my mother and I moved to another city and I wishtoG___I could\ntell you where. But that city was in the Ukraine.",
        "A: No, no, we never returned to Warsaw. Oh, I remember, another incident. My parents and I\nwere on a train and the train was bombed. Several of the cars fell down into a ditch and there\nwere many dead and screaming andG____ knows what. We were in the last car of the train and\nI think that was the only one that was left standing on the track and was not hit. So I remember\nthat. Anyway my mother and I were alone and we wound up in this city, probably in the\nUkraine, and very near the village where I was ultimately to be hidden. My mother supported\nus, it\u2019s a terrible word. I mean she provided the little we had by knitting. I know that sounds\nridiculous but my mother would take your old sweater with the holes in the elbows and she\nwould rip out the yarn and out of that torn, holey sweater, she would make you a vest or a short\nsleeve sweater or whatever it was. She knitted day and night. I remember listening to my\nmother\u2019s knitting needles, even in the night. My mother smoked. I remember seeing her\ncigarette in the dark. My mother was an exceptional knitter and she could knit in the dark\nwithout having to look. I remember going into bomb shelters during air raids and my mother\nwould say to me, I\u2019m here, just listen to my needles and you know I\u2019m here. You needn\u2019t be\nafraid as long as you hear my needles. If she wasn\u2019t knitting, she was smoking. She\u2019d say,\nwatch, that\u2019s my cigarette. I would watch her face suddenly light up as se took a puff of her\ncigarette. But most of the time she was knitting. She knitted all the time. She would ask me to\nhold out my hands. When she ripped a sweater, she would wind the yarn around my hands. My\ntwo outstretched hands. Then she would wind it into a ball from my hands. I remember\nholding out my hands and getting very tired and complaining a great deal but that was how she\nsupported us. I know that at night, she would sneak out after the curfew and she would go to\nthe parts of the city where she wasn\u2019t allowed to go be, to deliver her goods. One time she took\nme with her. That was rare, usually she left me back in our room with my teddy bear, my\nDavid, my treasured possession. She took me with her into the city and she said she was taking\nme to a lady who, I must be very careful and I must not speak only to say please and thank you\nand to be very polite, other than that to not speak. If I\u2019m asked a question only to say yes and\nno and not to say anything. Because where we were going was very dangerous but this was a\nvery generous lady and she would probably serve tea and cake or cookies. That was why my\nmother was going to take a chance and take me because we might get something very delicious\nto eat, or jam, jam. So we went and we crossed into a section that I don\u2019t remember by what\nmeans or what but I know we weren\u2019t allowed o be there. We went into a house and I just seem\nto remember that it was a white house and it had a door. We went inside and inside was a very\ncozy home, a cozy room with lovely upholstered furniture and a lot of pillows. There was a\npiano and it had a shawl over it and a beautiful vase filled with flowers. There were\nphotographs and there were a lot of pictures and paintings and things on the walls. We sat on an\nupholstered, lovely carved settee with a table in front. Just as my mother had predicted, this\nlady brought out a tray with a tea service on it with cookies and jam and toast and wonderful\nthings. I ate and oh it was so wonderful.",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t had anything like that, my G__! Oh, it was so wonderful. With that the lady said to\nmy mother, come into my bedroom and I\u2019Il show you what I made. It turned out that this lady\nwas a -- well she did beautiful needlework. She did these pictures which were framed which\nwere both embroidered and appliqu\u00e9d. For example, there was one -- well I\u2019Il tell you about\nthat one because it almost caused our death. Also the reason she called my mother into another\nroom 1s because this lady also made dolls which were fully clothed adult dolls but they were\napparently anatomically correct. So she showed this lovely doll but then invited my mother into\nthis next room so that she could undress this male doll and show my mother that it had all its\nanatomical parts. Well, while my mother and this lady were out of the room I turned and\nlooked at the wall behind me on which hung a picture that this woman had also made. The\npicture was of a sort of cottage and a yard filled with chickens and there were flowers against\nthe cottage and there were little windows with shutters and a door and so forth. There was a girl\nthrowing feed from an apron, just like I had described before, throwing seed out to chickens.\nThere were chickens all over, feeding and flying around and whatever. All of this was\nappliqu\u00e9d and embroidered and so on and very intricate. Suddenly I realized to my horror or\nfascination that the girl feeding the chickens had a yellow star on her chest. When my mother\ncame out of the other room with this lady, I absolutely couldn\u2019t help but point it out. Look she\nhas a yellow star. With that this woman flew into a rage, pointed a finger at my mother and\nsaid, you did that, it wasn\u2019t there before, you\u2019re responsible, you did that! She screamed out of\nthe door for the police. My mother and I ran out. There were two police and I can\u2019t tell you\nwhat they were but I think they had brown....",
        "A: Brown uniforms. That\u2019s -- I think -- my memory serves me -- they were brown. One blew a\nwhistle and ran around the corner for the truck or whatever it was. The other one had a rifle or\na gun or something, I don\u2019t remember, and he was holding on to my mother. I realized the\nimport of what was happening and I began to scream and I bit the hand of this policeman. He\nbegan -- pulled away his hand in pain and screamed out. My mother grabbed me and we ran\nand hid and we got away. At that time, my mother and I shared a room with another lady in a\nsort of a boarding house which must have been all Jews. I don\u2019t know whether the woman who\nowned this home was Jewish or not, I only remember that she -- I remember a lot about her\nactually. One of the things that I remember is that she kept talking about her son who was in\nthe army and who was going to come home. She had cookies or mondelbrut that she had baked\nand she had it in packages under a cabinet. She showed us that she had baked this and she was\nsaving it for her son, it was his favorite thing. As soon as she knew where he was, she would\nsend it to the front, send some to the front. But if that wasn\u2019t possible that was okay, because he\nwould be home soon and then she would have this for him. My mother and the lady who shared\nthe room with us gave each other a knowing sort of look and then my mother, every night,\nproceeded to steal some of the cookies.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. One day, my mother went out and she came home very, very excited, very\nhappy. At that time we were literally starving. There was nothing to eat. It was summer and\nwe were eating, it\u2019s a weed that grows. It\u2019s kind of a jagged leaf and it has a kind of gray, silky,\nshiny surface. It grows here in the United States and every year is a ritual, I eat some. It kind\nof tastes like spinach. That\u2019s what we ate that summer, that and the stolen cookies. Every now\nand then something else my mother was able to forage. But my mother came home one day\nextremely excited and happy. She had made a great coup, a conquest. She brought home this\ntreasure. She carefully unwrapped this thing. I couldn\u2019t wait to see what it could possibly be.\nShe kept on unwrapping this handkerchief. It was in this piece of cloth. Finally there was this\ntwo- inch square of -- or maybe it was one inch, I don\u2019t know -- it looked like a big domino of\nsomething white. I\u2019d never seen it. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I said to my mother, what 1s it?\nIt was such a treasure! She said, it\u2019s fat, which didn\u2019t mean anything to me but it did finally\nmean that she was able to fry those greens and they had a little taste rather than eating them raw\nor boiling them.",
        "A: Yes, I was one of them and so was my mother. My mother was very talented at all needle work.\nShe was a wonderful seamstress. My mother had made me a beautiful -- she must have made it\n-- well I guess it could have been after the blitzkrieg. Maybe it was a birthday present, in fact,\nmaybe I think it was a birthday present.",
        "A: Possibly or the one after that, I don\u2019t really know. That period is very -- it\u2019s all very fuzzy. I\nmean my memories are more anecdotal than they are historic. There\u2019s no real sequence. I\nguess they\u2019re in some sort of sequence but it doesn\u2019t really tell you much, well maybe it does.\nSo my mother made me this coat and I remember this lovely spring coat. It was a very pale\ngray tweed and it had little nubs of color, little colors. The colors were all pastel, little bumps all\nover this fabric. They were beautiful, pale lavender and pink and light green and blue and just\nsort of a capelet, a little cape on top of the shoulders. I remember that I couldn\u2019t wait for it to\nget warm enough to wear this wonderful treasure that my mother had made. When I finally -- it\nwas time to wear to it my mother sewed this very ugly yellow star on my left shoulder and my\nleft shoulder blade. And I protested vehemently and she simply told me not to discuss it. It was\na fact and to ignore it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, the yellow stars became common. I also remember my mother coming home\none day. She had a navy coat and it had a black fur collar, a shiny -- a seal. It must have been a\nseal collar or a black Persian , or I don\u2019t know, something, a black fur collar. When she came\nhome -- and the coat had yellow stars on it -- when she returned home from wherever she had\nbeen, the fur had been removed from her coat. She explained to our roommate that all fur had\nto be donated to the German army because they needed it. Of course, the coat was ruined. So I\nremember that. One day my mother came home and she had this young girl with her. She was\na teenage girl and I was supposed to remember her, but I only vaguely remembered her.\nApparently this girl had been a student of my father\u2019s in Warsaw. My mother, by chance,\nbumped into her somewhere in town and brought this girl whose name was Rya. She sat me on\nher lap and in her no nonsense sort of way, she said to me, you must go with Rya and when I\ncan, I will come for you. When will you come for me? Crusscoov.",
        "A: Of course, my mother never came for me.",
        "A: I know that this incident was at the very end of summer. It was probably the same summer\nwhich the preceding spring had brought the pretty coat and the yellow star experience and all\nthat sort of thing.",
        "A: Yes, probably although --. I would imagine that that was very close, those events were very\nclose to each other. The events that I told you before, traveling with my father, the train, the\nbombing with the blankets over the head and all that; I think that was probably a year before.\nSo that might have been, say 1941.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Well, of course, yes.",
        "A: Yes, I didn\u2019t really see a great deal of German soldiers when I was still with my mother,\nalthough yes, some.",
        "A: A lot, a lot. I told you about listening to my mother\u2019s knitting needles in bomb shelters and\ncellars and that sort of thing. That was nothing, that was daily, sometimes twice daily. Many\ntimes, that was --that was just ordinary. In fact, at one point, I was pushed down some stairs, or\na ladder or something and my nose was broken. It wasn\u2019t even known until the next day that\nmy nose was broken because we were in the dark. It wasn\u2019t until the light that my mother saw\nthat I was completely bruised -- my nose had been shattered.\nA No. Now I have to give you a little bit of background. First of all, Rya was no more than a\nteenager at that point. I would say, that at the most, she was 16 or 17. I would have been say\nfive and a half, six. So Rya was, I don\u2019t know, ten years older. A little background... In the\nUkraine, what I know of the Ukraine, there are little villages. Obviously, there are big towns\nbut the countryside of the Ukraine was... This is another life, now I\u2019m giving you history that I\n-- this is where I lived. There were little villages which were connected to each other by dirt\nroads. During the summer these roads were traversed by horse drawn carriage, not carriages\nbut carts. The villages -- surrounding these villages were the farms. The land had been divided\nafter the fall of the Czars, Czar, First World War, had been divided among the peasants.\nPrevious to that, it was owned by the Church. So that now although the people were very\nreligious and were very loyal to the village priest and they were very generous to him; he was\nno longer as wealthy and flamboyant as they had been during the time of the Czars, during\nWhite Russia. But because the peasants were religious, the priests lived a far better life than did\nthe peasants. Now it\u2019s the Greek Orthodox Church, the Bible is in Greek. The priests marry\nand have families. The families were the intelligentsias, if you will, of the village. The children\nof the priests became the postmaster, the school teachers, the mayor, if there was such a thing.\nThey sort of ran the community.",
        "A: They could read and write. Some f them were very highly educated. The more wealthy was the\npriest, the better educated were his children. In order to be educated they were sent \u201cabroad\u201d\u2019.\nAbroad meant great cities in Europe like Warsaw where this particular Rya, child of a priest in\nan Ukrainian village would up studying in Warsaw with my father. Apparently she took private\nlessons at home or somehow or other got home to meet my mother and became enamored of my\nmother and became a frequent visitor. I told you earlier about the generosity of my\ngrandmother and her warmth and so forth, and I am sure that my mother befriend this young\ngirl from the Ukraine in a similar sort of way, although this girl was not of peasant stock. But\nmy mother liked her and they had a relationship. Therefore, when my mother bumped into her\nin town and explained our plight, Rya must have asked -- I had to have been a baby, less than\nfour -- and Rya must have played with me or possibly babysat or whatever. So when my mother\nexplained our plight and the possibilities of our disaster, Rya being an altruistic, kind and\nreligious teenager said, well I\u2019Il take her home and hide her with me, without any thought to the\nconsequences or to the reaction of her family or the possible danger to herself, her family, the\nentire village, the future, I mean, you know, nothing. She simply offered and my mother\njumped at the opportunity. So my mother sent me off with a little package of clothing wrapped\naround a handkerchief, my teddy bear who was now significantly smaller than I was. I\nremember walking down the front steps. I remember my mother standing on the stairs saying\ndon\u2019t turn around. Just go, walk through the gate and don\u2019t turn around, keep walking.\nRemember what I told you, remember what I told you. We walked through the -- down the\nstairs and through the garden. I remember that the garden was overgrown and unkempt and\nwilted and a great mass of jungle. It had been cultivated at one time. That\u2019s why I -- it was late\nsummer. I remember walking with Rya holding my hand and I holding on to my teddy bear and\nRya with the bundle. We walked out and I turned once to look at my mother and she was\nholding a handkerchief up to her face. She yelled again don\u2019t turn around, keep walking.\nThat\u2019s my last memory of my mother. I don\u2019t even remember getting to the village or anything\nabout it. I don\u2019t remember arriving, I don\u2019t remember any of that.",
        "A: No, I might have -- I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember whether I remembered\nthen or...I was just an obedient child and I went... If my mother said she would come for me,\nshe would come for me. If she said that I would be safe and I should go, that was it. I trusted\nmy mother and I knew not to argue with my mother.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t imagine so, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure that that yellow star was on\nsummer clothing. I think it might have only been on outerwear. I really don\u2019t recall that.",
        "A: Rya.",
        "A: Yes, yes. So now we arrive in the village of the Ukraine. I\u2019ll describe the village to you. There\nwas a dirt road through which you got to the village. When you got to the village, there were\nhouses, there\u2019s one in these pictures somewhere. There\u2019s a man standing in front of it -- I was\nlooking at it before and now I can\u2019t find it. It\u2019s kind of log cabins with thatched roofs. Why\ndon\u2019t you turn that off for a moment and I\u2019Il look for the pictures?",
        "A: There were houses like I pointed out to you with thatched roofs, log cabin kind of houses, but\nwhitewashed; whitewashed log cabins. Then the road split like a wishbone. In the crook of the\nwishbone sat a small, white church with steps going up. It had a large door and two windows.\nWhen I looked at it, 1t looked like a clown face because it had a big window on each side of the\ndoor and the steps -- it looked like a clown with his tongue hanging out. It had a sharp point at\nthe top of the cross with the slash underneath. The road went around it. Behind the church was\na small cemetery with crosses, stone crosses. There was a legend that the cross of the priest\nwhose family I was about to live with, that stone cross grew every year. The people wee so\nsuperstitious and they had revered this particular priest to such a degree that these legends about\nhim grew. Anyway, the houses continued as the road -- the two roads...",
        "A: Diverged, exactly behind the church. I would say that at the very most there were 30 to 50\nhouses. That was the entire town. On the left side behind our house, which was the most\nelegant house, it was a clapboard house, very different from the other cabins...Further back\nbehind our house was a stream and then a forest. On the opposite side of town, to my right, as I\nwas facing the church was a road that led out to the fields where all of the various wheat and\ngrain and hemp and barley and whatever all was grown was. That was the entire town. There\nwas no electricity, there were no automobiles, there were no telephones. The donation that I\nmade to you, I wrote a little piece to go with it. The little dress we grew our own hemp. We\nspun on a spinning wheel, we spun the yarn. It was loomed at home, on a loom. I sewed it by\nhand. Life was primitive. I am sure that it was no different than it had been two centuries\nbefore. That was the life of the village.",
        "A: So I\u2019ve described the village to you. Okay, the household. I mean I could describe our house.\nVery briefly, Pll tell you that life was centered for the most part around the kitchen, primarily\nbecause it was the warmest place. There was no central heating of any kind, in fact. There is\nusually a fireplace in one room and the wall against which the fireplace 1s in one room 1s the\nbed wall in the adjacent room simply because of the heat, you know, the warmth. There was one\nroom which must have been the back of the kitchen, the wall behind where the oven where we\nbaked our bread was. We used to sit in that room a great deal. Or if not sit, we would stand\nwith our hands behind our back leaning on that warm wall. We would take turns because only\none spot on the wall was really warm and so we would take turns. That was how our evenings\nwere spent. We would tell stories. In fact, Rya devised a game. She would start a story. She\nwould say Mirka and Vali were two beautiful children and they went on a picnic. When they\ngot out to the woods a wolf suddenly jumped out from behind a tree and Mirka said ---, and she\nwould point to me and I would have to pick up the story. Then I would take the story to some\nprecipice and the next person would go on with it. This is how we entertained ourselves at\nnight and then we would all go to sleep.",
        "A: No and other members of the family.\nA Yes, I'll tell you about that. That\u2019s how our evenings were spent. There wasn\u2019t much to the\nevening because we woke up to the roosters. They took off with the first light, they would\ncrow. Life would start at five in the morning or whatever it was and I am sure we were all in\nbed and asleep by dark.",
        "A: Kerosene, we had kerosene lamps. Okay, the members of the family. The priest had died some\nyears before, two, three, five, I don\u2019t know. The wife of the priest was very highly revered in\nthe town and she was, in fact, feared. She was spoken of in the third person, you know.\nEnormous respect was accorded her. She was spoken of in the way you speak of a -- almost a\ngod or a monarch, or whatever. Very highly respected and revered. People paid court. There\nwere obligatory visits that they had to make. They brought baskets of fruit, or whatever, to visit\nher. They would nod in our direction whether we were sitting by the window or not, nod\ntoward our house as they walked by to pay respect, that sort of thing. Now she was a very\nbright woman. It was decided that my new identity was going to be that she was -- she spoke\nfluent Polish -- she was very well educated. She was fluent in Polish so my identity was going\nto be that she was Polish and had married the Ukrainian priest but she had a sister back in\nPoland and I was that sister\u2019s child. That was -- since I came from, I don\u2019t know where,\nwherever they had me come from in Poland, my Ukrainian was not perfect, my Russian was not\nabsolutely perfect, but that was the excuse. I was brought from the city of -- I was her niece, or\nher relative, or whatever and that was why my name was different. I didn\u2019t look exactly like\nthem and that was my beard.",
        "A: Yes, yes. So I had a new last name which was a Polish last name. Theirs was a Russian name,\nobviously. I remember only that my name was purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs\nended in kvov which son of whatever as does ski, I think. In any case, so I was --well, it\u2019s\nirrelevant, okay, I won\u2019t give you all that. In any case, this woman had five children. The\noldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really didn\u2019t take too terribly well to education. I\ndon\u2019t think he was ever sent abroad. He was sort of more interested in farming. He was very\npractical, he was the farmer. He was huge, he had a moustache, he never smiled, he rolled his\nown cigarettes, he spat into a spittoon. You know, he was more like a peasant. He was very\nwell liked and respected and he was like one of the boys and probably the head boy, you know.\nThen there was a middle son and he was very rebellious. He ultimately ran off to the forest and\nwas with the partisans. In fact, I used to hide out by the woods when the Germans came. At\none point, I was hidden in the hayloft, haystack rather. He once or twice came and gave me\nmessages which I carried back. But I hardly remember him because he left. I don\u2019t even\nremember his name. I remember that his mother -- I remember his mother describing him to\nsomeone, and she said, and it\u2019s funny because it\u2019s an expression that I\u2019ve used many times\nbecause it described him so well, it described his nature. She said that this middle son when he\nhas a cause or feels strongly about something would fight until he was up to his knees in blood.\nI don\u2019t know whether that was a Russian saying but I\u2019ve heard myself saying that in describing\nsuch a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn person. The youngest son was two years older than\nI was. His name was Vali and I was -- he and I slept in the same bed. I was, I don\u2019t know, five\nand a half, six; he was two years older. I can describe him perfectly. He was very tow headed.\nHe had a cowlick in sort of in the wrong place. It was just above the widow\u2019s peak where his\nhairline began. He had a sort of a double cowlick with cowlicks going in opposite directions at\nthat point. Because of that, his hair was almost shaved off. Because had it not been, it probably\nwouldn\u2019t have been able to sort of stay all in the same direction. So he has this Russian version\nof a crew cut. So those were the three sons. The two daughters were Rya, who I\u2019ve already\ntold you about and the older one whose name I really don\u2019t remember and whom I didn\u2019t get to\nknow very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in town. So she had some sort\nof office type job. Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever,\nthe provider and the man about the house. Vali was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the\nmiddle boy was the rebellious, I don\u2019t know, 14 year old he was, who ran off and joined the\npartisans and became what we called a Cossack. So that was the household. Now I was not\nreceived with any degree of love or kindness. I wasn\u2019t sheltered or shielded or loved at all. I\nwas tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of taken care of but never with kindness, never\nwith love. I was never complimented. If I did something very well, it was -- more than\nanything I had the feeling of resentment. Furthermore, I was from the city. I was urbane and\nVali was a peasant. He had never been to the city. I described the building in which I lived\nwhich had four floors. He couldn\u2019t understand that there was a room above a room. I explained\nto him that it was like the attic where they dried their apple slices on a -- strung from one end to\nanother -- and stored things. Also like the cellar where the cabbage slaw was kept and that, in\nfact, his house had three floors. But these were four floors of one above the other, bedrooms\nand, you know, apartments. I described one apartment building. He couldn\u2019t conceive of such\na thing. He couldn\u2019t conceive of such a thing as chocolate either. So that when we were finally\ninvaded by the German army, the first time I was hidden in the haystack which I already\nmentioned. But then they went back and forth and in and out. They were, you know, driven out\nby the Russians and there was fighting back and forth. So they were there several times, 1n and\nout. At some point, I became very brazen and I wound up sitting on the laps of officers. They\nwould pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with me and so forth and give me chocolate. I\nwould then take the chocolate and give it to Vali. Until the mother found out about this and put\na stop to it because it was, you know, absolutely life threatening. Well, anyway I never really\nhad any love. I was incredibly lonely. I kept thinking about my mother. One day, it just\noccurred to me that she\u2019s not living and she\u2019Il never come back. Meanwhile the mother, Vali\u2019s\nmother, Rya\u2019s mother, was teaching me to read, to sew, to be a Ukrainian child, girl. Taught me\nall the things, how to spin, how to weave, how to sew, how to mend, how to cook a little bit\nalthough it was very difficult because of the primitive style of cooking in deep ovens with iron\npots. You know, children couldn\u2019t physically manage that but everyone had jobs and mine was\npeeling the potatoes. In the time that I was there, in the two and a half years, I must have peeled\nten truckloads of potatoes, that\u2019s all I did. I peeled potatoes. I read with the mother and at first\nshe would read to me. She read me Bible stories. She would read to me and she would point to\nthe words with her finger. I would watch her moving finger across the page and then she would\nturn the page and there would be a picture that related to the story. She would continue the story\nand I kind of fell in love with one story. I kept asking her to read it over and over. It was the\nstory of the prodigal son. I don\u2019t know why I liked that one especially but somehow... So she\nread it over and over and then one day in the middle of the story, she sort of looked up and she\nsaid, you read, and I did. And not only did I read but -- maybe because I had heard that one so\nmany times -- I understood it and I read it and we turn the page and went on to the next story.\nAt one point we turned the page and there was a picture of little girls crossing a little bridge\nover a -- you know -- like a little stream. Hovering -- and there was a very sort of rickety little\nbridge, maybe a log, whatever it was, and it looked dangerous with the rushing water\nunderneath. Hovering in flight with arms outstretched behind the little child was an angel with\nbeautiful wings like a bird and a flowing gown. I said what is that and she explained to me\nabout angels. I said everybody has an angel? She said every child has an angel to protect it. I\nsaid even Jewish children? She said yes, even Jewish children and even you. You have a very\nspecial angel. So that night I went to sleep and I woke up and I knew who my angel was. I was\nabsolutely certain that my own angel was the infant Jesus and that I would be protected because\nI had a Jewish angel. No harm would come to me. I knew that I would be all right. I can tell\nyou a lot of stories about life in that village. I was there two Christmases and three Easters or\nmaybe the other way around. It\u2019s the other way around. One day, you\u2019re not going to believe\nthis, you\u2019re not going to believe this... One day in the middle of the severest winter, a horse\ndrawn sled came into town on the road, which was an event. I mean nothing came in the winter.\nSometimes, you know, if the German army was there, the trucks came but we never saw\nanything like cars or.... In fact, once a car came and all the children of the village gathered\naround the car and stared at it as if it was a flying saucer.",
        "A: Well, I mean to me, it was cars, I mean it was nothing, I had been in cars. My grandfather had a\nyard full of big shiny black cars and I remember sitting on his lap and blowing the horn, it was\noutside the car, you know, one of those things you squeezed. I mean cars -- was nothing to me.\nI was a city child. I remember being fascinated watching all these children staring at the car like\nit was something really. But in any case, it was a great event in the middle of winter, a sled\ncame from -- into town. Also a wagon, you know, a sled came from -- into town. Also a\nwagon, you know, a sled pulled by a single horse with a bell and a guy huddled up and dressed\nin -- bundled with a whip. He came right to our house and Rya came to me and she said Mirka\ndo you remember your uncle Jacob. This is a note from your uncle Jacob. He\u2019s waiting for\nyou. I was put on the sled the next morning. That morning, Vali, the little boy who was two\nyears older than I, disappeared and hid with my teddy bear. Finally the sled driver was anxious\nto leave and we could wait no longer and I had to leave without my teddy bear.",
        "A: Yes. That teddy bear is alive and well and living in the Ukraine and I know that. Because that -\n-that artifact would never be destroyed or discarded, never.",
        "A: I know that teddy bear is living and well somewhere in the Ukraine. So several hours later, by\nsled, we got into town and a tall extremely handsome man with a moustache and dark hair; he\nlooked kind of like Clark Gable or possibly..... No, no even more distinguished than that, not as\nromantic a figure but the one who -- what was that great war movie, Mrs. Miniver, who was the\nhusband of Mrs. Miniver? Not Gregory Peck, Walter Pidgeon. So my uncle Jacob, looking like\nWalter Pidgeon, in black shiny boots, very natty, very straight like a soldier, lifted me out of the\nwagon and set me down. I looked up at him, up, up, up; he was so tall. He said, do you\nremember me? I said, of course, you\u2019re uncle Jacob. How do you remember me? And he\ncarried me into the house and I told him the story of when the horse kicked him in the chest.",
        "A: Well, uncle Jacob and I traveled around Europe. We went to a number of capitols. I remember\nthat we went to -- I think we were in four or five countries. We traveled by those same railroad\ncars, looking for survivors. We lived in rooms that were incredibly cold. I'd like to tell you\nabout one experience but first I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to know how it was that uncle Jacob found\nthis needle in the haystack hidden in a village in the Ukraine when he had been in Siberia. So\nnow I'll tell you a story that you will not believe. Uncle Jacob left Siberia where he had been\nput in charge because he was, I had told you before he was so trustworthy and efficient and\ngood at everything, so he had been put in charge of the food supply, mainly the meat. He was\nthe head butcher in charge of -- he never touched the meat but he was in charge of all the food.\nWith the little bit of black marketing and finagling that he did, he was able to fill several\nsuitcases or bundles with goods, ladies\u2019 silk underwear... I don\u2019t know where he got all this\nstuff. I\u2019m sure they were payoffs for favors or whatever but as we traveled around Europe later,\nafter he found me, those suitcases got lighter and lighter because their contents is what kept us\nfed.",
        "A: That was our money. He also kept a journal. Unfortunately, at one point, we had to cross a\nborder where I was told that I was to play the part of a deaf mute since we were going -- I didn\u2019t\nspeak the language of wherever we were going. He was so fearful that he burned the journal\nand it was the history of the entire war, day by day, from the time he left Warsaw. So\nunfortunately a great treasure was -- and I watched that burn, I watched that burn. That was a\ndaily log. Anyway Jacob left Siberia and traveled until he -- traveled to many places. At one\npoint he wound up in this town.",
        "A: Yes. The way the Jews \u2014 there were no train schedules, you know. People would -- if they\nwanted to go east, they went to the platform where the train was heading east was going and\nthey sat on the platform for a day, for an hour, for a week, whatever, until the train came. When\nthe train came, they boarded the train and they went east. When the train stopped, they got off\nor they kept going or whatever and that\u2019s how people got around. So there were always people\nsitting on the platform. They were going either east or west or wherever they were going, north,\nsouth, waiting, sitting on platforms. Well, apparently, Jacob got off the platform and I have\nalready described to you that he was extremely handsome, very nattily dressed, which was very\nunusual, highly unusual. So this handsome guy gets off the train with two bulging suitcases and\nthe women were extremely attracted to him. He began to talk to a woman who was waiting for\na train which was going east -- in the opposite direction -- into, towards Siberia. Is that east?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: From whence he had come. So he gets off the train, he\u2019s on the platform, he begins to chat with\nthis woman. What is your name? That woman was the only human being who knew my\nwhereabouts. She was the woman who had shared the room with me and my mother.",
        "A: Yes. Had her train come first---. It was absolute sheer chance! He said Berliner, my mother\nhad changed her name, she was no longer using her married name because she was so\ndisillusioned with her husband, my father. So she had gone back to her name, Berliner. This\nwoman said oh your name is Jacob Berliner. My dear friend was Berliner. My uncle -- I\u2019m\nhearing this -- apparently fainted. Her train came. She got on the train and disappeared. He\nwasn\u2019t sure what niece. He didn\u2019t get all the facts. He knew the village, he knew a child. He\nthought it might be me but 1t could have been any number of his nieces. He didn\u2019t know. He\nfainted. I don\u2019t know how long he was on the platform. Anyway, he was found passed out by\nsomeone who I think was also a priest. He was taken home to that person\u2019s house, maybe\nbecause he looked wealthy, I don\u2019t know whatever. In any case, apparently he was sick,\ndelirious, ill, I don\u2019t know, whatever for a number of days. In that time, he told us later that he\nhad a dream. In the dream, he dreamed he was back in Warsaw, it was before the war. He was\nwearing his tails and top hat because he had come from a ball or gone to the opera, or whatever\nit was. He was walking along the street with his walking stick and as he got near the street\nlamp, gas lit street lamp, he heard the clippety clop of an oncoming carriage. It was a very\nfoggy night and out of the fog approached this horse drawn black carriage. He tried to peer\ninside but he couldn\u2019t see because of the fog but it stopped right under the street lamp. A\nwoman leaned forward and she was all dressed in white. Here comes the lump in the throat. It\nwas my mother, his young sister. She said, Yacov, take care of my child. He knew who it was\nand it was the next day that he sent this sled to get me.",
        "A: Perhaps, you\u2019re right, perhaps you\u2019re right.",
        "A: And a dream. An absolute meeting by chance. Two trains coming from different directions \u2014\npeople chatting on a platform. It wouldn\u2019t have happened if he was raggedy like all the rest but\nhe was so natty and so attractive and this woman began to -- she was attracted to him and began\nto chat with him. I just want to tell you that when I was born, apparently I was a very sickly\ninfant. The story goes that I couldn\u2019t be cured. I apparently had all of the childhood diseases,\nall at the same time. Anyway I was given up for dead. I had everything including whooping\ncough, all at the same time. They gave me up, this child will never live. Finally my mother in\ndesperation said well, then she\u2019Il die at home. She took me out of the hospital away from the\nspecialists and so forth and took me home to a room that she had painted white, everything\nincluding the floor. She had prepared this room for me. She took me into this room and no one\nwas allowed in the room. She cared for me herself. No one could come into the room until her\nbrother Jacob came. She said to him, Jacob, I know this sounds ridiculous. Everything has been\ndone for my child and my child is given up for dead. There are no more medical cures. I know\nyou'll think it\u2019s silly but there\u2019s one last thing that we haven\u2019t done. We haven\u2019t tried to fool the\ndybbuk, the dybbuk wants my child. He says tell me, I'll do anything. My mother said, we\nmust fool the dybbuk into thinking this is a different child. He said well what, what should we\ndo? So she said to him, well I will sell you this child and you will give her a new name and\nshe\u2019ll be yours and then the dybbuk won\u2019t want her anymore because it\u2019s not the child that the\ndybbuk wants. He said all right. How much do you want for her? She said well what is a\nchild\u2019s life worth? Give me your hat. He took off his hat. She said okay take this hat, fill it\nwith pennies, bring it back and I will give you my child. So he went and he filled the hat with\npennies and he came back and he bought me. She said, Jacob, what is your child\u2019s name? He\nsaid her name is Chai Berliner. Chai because it means life. And I survived and I got well. So I\nwas very precious to Jacob. All that bubba meinsa fits, you see. It just was meant that Jacob\nwould find me. All right, so Jacob and I traveled. We stayed in all kinds of places. There was\none time I remember, he woke me very early in the morning. We were in a room somewhere.\nWe had slept -- it was so cold. I used to sleep on top of him, huddled on top of his chest,\nsnuggled up. I was tiny, teeny. He woke me, he said quickly get up, we must get dressed. But\nWuyjaszek I called him Wujaszek, wujak in Polish 1s uncle, wujaszek 1s diminutive, a loving --.\nBut Wujaszek, but it\u2019s still dark, it\u2019s so cold, I can\u2019t get dressed. He said here you dress inside\nthe bed, under the covers. While you dress, I'll get you the milk. Ihave milk. He reached for\nthe milk which was sitting in a bottle on the corner but the bottle was full and it had -- the milk\nhad frozen and the bottle had cracked.",
        "A: Yes, but it was still frozen. That\u2019s how cold our room was. Anyway we dressed and he said\ncome we must go to the market. To the market, why are we going to the market? It\u2019s the\nmiddle of the night. He said, come, we must rush, we must run. He explained nothing. I\ndressed and we walked and walked and walked. It was still dark and we got to the market in the\nfirst light of morning. Instead of the usual stalls, the farmers selling their produce, there were\njust hundreds and hundreds of people in this cobblestone marketplace. As the morning dawned,\nJacob said I\u2019m going to put you on my shoulders. I want you to watch and no matter how\nhorrible the sight, I want you to keep your eyes open and watch. I said, Wujaszek, what am I\ngoing to see? Why are we here? He said they\u2019ve caught some German officers and they are\ngoing to hang them and I want you to watch. Why? He said because I don\u2019t want you to have\nany hate. The man you\u2019re going to see hanged is the man who murdered your mother. He sat\nme on his shoulders and I watched three men being hung. He just didn\u2019t want me to hate. He\nwanted it all to -- he wanted me to be healthy -- to let it all out in this one traumatic, ugly,\nhorrible experience.",
        "A: Obviously he didn\u2019t. It was just, just \u2014",
        "A: It was just therapy. It was his way. There was no connection whatsoever. He just didn\u2019t want\nme to hate anyone. I have to admit 50 years later that it didn\u2019t work. I can\u2019t hear German\nspoken without -- it didn\u2019t work. He used to leave me alone in the room. He would say, here\u2019s\nfood, here\u2019s my watch. I\u2019m going to be gone for eight hours. I\u2019ll be back at seven o\u2019clock. I\nwant you to sit here and listen to the radio. Here\u2019s paper and pencil. Just listen. If you hear --\ndon\u2019t change the station -- it\u2019s on just the station. Listen carefully, if anything sounds familiar,\nwrite it down. I would listen all day to coded messages, messages like Wujaszek is searching\nfor the little girl who untied his shoelaces -- only usually shorter. Or there would be lists of\nnames. The following are documented to have died in Treblinka and then an hour of names.\nHe would come home, what do you have? While I was doing that, he was going to various\nagencies, searching and looking and authenticating and documenting deaths and looking for\nsurvivors. There were none. Finally one day he said that\u2019s it. We got into one of those boxcars\nof which there is a photograph that I gave you. It\u2019s only many years later in the United States\nthat I realized what was written on the exterior of that boxcar. It\u2019s in English and in Hebrew. It\nsays \u201cTo Liberty.\u201d And \u201cFrom Auschwitz to New York.\u201d You know when I arrived in the United\nStates I didn\u2019t speak any English whatsoever. I knew two words; they were okay and I reasoned\nthat if okay meant yes then obviously nokay meant no.",
        "A: The little schooling I had was at the knee of the Ukrainian mother. A little bit of schooling in\nthe village but only until 1t got too cold for me to walk barefoot to the school because I had no\nshoes Then in the D.P. camp to which we went in that boxcar and the D.P. camp was in Munich.\nWe were in the D.P. camp for, I can\u2019t tell you how long, maybe a year or more. In the D.P.\ncamp, Jacob had the job of being in charge of the social hall which meant he was the electrician,\nthe plumber; he set up the chairs, he took them down, he was the stage manager and he was the\nemcee of all the various goings on. Being handsome and charming and witty, he was the\nperfect emcee. I went to school in the morning but school was mostly the learning of Hebrew.\nBecause most of the people in the D.P. camp, all of them, were going to Palestine. It was kind\nof embarrassing or shameful to admit that we were going to America. So I went to school and\nstudied Hebrew. When I came to the United States, I spoke Polish, Russian, Ukrainian. I could\nunderstand Greek, a little bit of Hebrew, a little bit of German and somewhat more, I was able\nto understand but not speak fluently, Yiddish. If I\u2019m not mistaken, that\u2019s seven languages.",
        "A: Well, my grandparents in their home spoke Yiddish and Polish so I heard it. There was no\nYiddish spoken between my parents. Of course, I heard it after my experience in the Ukraine as\nwe were displaced persons traveling from place to place. I left out one part of the story and I\nwill tell it to you as briefly as I can. The one part of my story which I never really told and the\nreason I\u2019m telling you now is that earlier today, I told it in front of my children. It\u2019s the first\ntime my children ever heard it. So now I feel at liberty to tell it to the world. It\u2019s not something\nof which I\u2019m proud of but it\u2019s a significant part of my life. My father left us. I can\u2019t with all\nhonesty say that he deserted us. But it sure felt that way. My father was a blue- eyed blond.\nMy father was a linguist, he was fluent in German and he could pass. Whereas, he promised to\nsend for us, he didn\u2019t. It could easily have been impossible. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ll ever know.\nBut I resented my father and when my mother became Berliner again, changing her name back\nto her maiden name, I simply went along with that. I went along with my mother\u2019s attitude\nabout my father which wasn\u2019t generous. It wasn\u2019t severe or bad either but their last months\ntogether were not affectionate. So I felt that my father had betrayed and deserted me\nthroughout the war and I never thought about him. In the D.P. camp, while Jacob was working\nat the duties in the social hall which was an all day and evening job, I went to school in the\nmorning where I studied Hebrew. Then when school ended in the morning, I would have lunch\nwith Jacob and then I was free in the afternoon. Now Jacob told me that we were going to go to\nAmerica on a ship across a big ocean. The ship would sway back and forth and there was a\ngood possibility that I would be seasick. I had never been seasick but he described it. To avoid\nthat, it would be a wonderful idea if I acclimated myself to the swaying motion by going to the\nplayground and spending my time on the swings. So I spent every afternoon on the swings.\nNow the swings faced a cyclone fence. On the opposite side of the fence, this was Munich,\nthere was a bench, a bus stop and in the afternoon a bus would come. Now I sat on the swings,\nswinging back and forth every day. Every day about an hour before the bus came, or half an\nhour, an old woman would come and she would sit on the bench and she would take out of her\nbag, a little package of crumbs. She would throw the crumbs to the little birds, pigeons, or\nwhatever it was. She would turn around and she would nod to me. This happened afternoon\nafter afternoon so finally we began to chat. Then one day she said to me, why are you spending\nso much time on the swings? So I explained I\u2019m going on a long voyage on a ship. I\u2019m going to\nAmerica and I know that I\u2019m going to get seasick and I explained the whole thing. She said,\nyou know, I have a brother in America. Some day, I\u2019m going to go to my brother when my\nquota number comes up. I said well if you\u2019re going to go on a ship, then you will be wise to get\nacclimated to the swaying also. From then on, instead of feeding the birds and sitting on the\nbench, she would come inside and she would sit on the swings. We would swing back and forth\ncriss-crossing each other and chatting away. One day as displaced persons do, we began to talk\nabout our backgrounds.. She began to ask me questions. What is your name, who are you,\nwhere are you from? I told her about my life before the blitzkrieg in Warsaw, my father had\nbeen a violinist and a violin teacher. She said tell me his name. I told her his name. The next\nday she returned and we sat on the swings and she said to me, tell me, do you have any marks\non your body? Anything that could identify you? Anything that\u2019s different from anything that\nanybody in the world has? I said yes. I have a beauty mark on my right forearm, shoulder.\nWhen I was a little girl, my grandfather used to tease me by making believe he took the beauty\nmark off my right forearm until I began to cry. Then he\u2019d say, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, I'll give it\nback. Then he would give it back to me on my left forearm or shoulder and I would look and\nthere it would be. So she left and came back the next day and she said, that was a very\ninteresting story about your grandfather but isn\u2019t there anything else on your body, any scars,\nanything that\u2019s different and unique? I said well, I don\u2019t like to talk about it but we have a\nfamily trait and I was born with it also. We have six toes. My uncle Jacob has six toes on one\nfoot. When I was born, I had six toes on each foot. They were surgically removed and I have a\nscar on each foot. The next day the woman came and brought my father. I don\u2019t know where\nhe survived but I think in Germany. Well my father insisted that I stay with him but we were\ngoing to sail two weeks hence. Having waited for our quota number, having found the uncle in\nAmerica. I mean all of these -- years of waiting and uncle Jacob said absolutely not. They\nargued and uncle Jacob had the same resentment or appeared to have the same resentment\ntowards my father that my mother had had. I didn\u2019t show him great warmth.",
        "A: Oh, of course, of course. So they argued and finally uncle Jacob said to me, okay, it\u2019s her\nchoice. Of course I insisted on going to America. Well about a year later, my father followed\nme and he knew where we were. By the time he came a year later I had begun to -- I had not\nbegun -- I had succeeded to a great extent in assimilating into American life, just like the\nchameleon I learned to be in the Ukraine. I did, once again, of necessity, in the United States.. I\nhad arrived here on June 24. By September, I was in school. On my first day of school, I called\nthe teacher outside and said to her something like I am greenhorn, do not call on me, I will not\nanswer. When I am ready, I will raise my hand. Then you call me. Shake? We shook hands\nand she never called on m until I raised my hand only a very short time later. I remember the\namazement of the class and the round of applause. I even remember the question and the\nanswer.",
        "A: Something like that. Anyway, suddenly my father shows up and he wants to take me back -- he\nwants to make an immigrant of me again. He doesn\u2019t speak a word of English, I\u2019m going to be\nliving again with displaced persons who\u2019 ve just arrived somewhere in Brooklyn, where I have a\nlife. My name is Berliner. I\u2019m starting to have friends. I speak English, \u2019 ve grown, having\ngone from the smallest child in the class to the tallest, all in one semester. I\u2019m appearing in\ntheir amateur hour and winning a prize doing my krazotsky and singing Russian songs.\nSuddenly he wants to take me -- he wants to turn the clock around, back to when I\u2019m going to\nbe da greena, look, the greena! Which was pejorative. Of course, 50 years of time have turned\nthe greena a pejorative into the survivor. This exalted, you know as if I did something\nphenomenal, I simply lived. Just like that little dress, that schmata that I\u2019ve had for 50 years\ntoday became an artifact.",
        "A: No, it was a schmata, trust me, a schmata. Now they have it hermetically sealed or G__ knows\nwhat and it\u2019ll be there for a thousand years or whatever, ina museum. Oh my G_, it\u2019s\nincredible what 50 years will do. But there was my father and he wanted to undo the year of\nvery hard adjustment. So I said no. He argued with my aunt and uncle. I now was living with\nthe rich uncle in America and his American wife and going to school in Forest Hills, Long\nIsland, P.S.3. My teacher was Mrs Riskin and the principal was Mrs. Morris. My G__, how do\nyou remember all that Miki? Anyway I didn\u2019t want to go back with my father. My father\npersisted and now my birthday came and my father sent me a gift. Actually a very beautiful\ngift. A box of oil paints and brushes. However he addressed it Mirka -- I still can\u2019t say it, his\nlast name -- in care of Berlinrer. I was mortified because the mailman knew and the doorman\nmight know. The girl who lived on the floor below might find out. Everyone might find out and\noh my G __, it\u2019s all going -- he\u2019s going to turn it all around for me. They\u2019ll start to point at me\nagain and I\u2019ll be da greena again. And there was huge arguments between my aunt and uncle\nand my father who persisted. Then my uncle offered my father the -- he said he wanted to\nlegally adopt me. It didn\u2019t mean that my father couldn\u2019t have a relationship with me, we could\nhave any relationship that we mutually wanted. I could visit him, I could go on a travel with\nhim or whatever. But he wanted to legally adopt me to give me the benefits of his moderate\nwealth and American citizenship and so forth. Of course my father refused. The arguments\nwent back and forth. Then one day my father sent a letter which named a sum of money for\nwhich he would sign the adoption papers. That caused my aunt and uncle to tell him to get lost.\nConsequently, I was not adopted until I was 21. Now I already told you the story of the\nchocolate bar and how the UNRRA gave the monthly packages and the family who had a child\nunder ten received the added chocolate bar. So my uncle Jacob registered me as being a year\nyounger. Consequently, I was really, in fact, 22 when I became free to sign the papers myself\nand I became a citizen in that year. I was also engaged to my husband who gave me an\nengagement ring on the very anniversary of my arrival in the United States which was June 24.",
        "A: Exactly, well yes, this is June 12. It\u2019s really strange that so many events and things have\nhappened to me in June. Today was a wonderful day and a very beautiful weekend at which I\nhave my family with me. My husband, my daughter Mural, my daughter-in-law,Gina and my\nson Andy. We are staying in a beautiful suite, in a lovely hotel in Washington and the sun is\nshining. And I\u2019ve survived the ordeal of this tape and life is wonderful.",
        "A: Thank you very much.",
        "A: Yes, a tiny anecdote which might help to clarify the date. My uncle and I and his two suitcases\nwere somewhere. It was in the middle of winter and we were in a tiny railroad station. It\nwasn\u2019t a big city railroad station. There weren\u2019t platforms, you know train platforms. It was a\ntrack and there was a little tiny building and inside the building it was just one room smaller, or\nperhaps the size of this room which is 12 by 20 or 15 or something like that. In the corner, there\nwas a potbelly stove and there was a desk and on the desk was one of those tick-tick machines,\nwhat is that? A telegraph, right. Okay, thank you. There was a guy who sat huddled up next to\nthe pot-bellied stove with this telegraph machine. In the back of the room, sitting on the floor,\nwhen we came in from a blizzard, walked into this building... I don\u2019t know where we came\nfrom, I don\u2019t remember how we got there. I know it was a blizzard...",
        "A: After he found me, okay, and we were going somewhere. We were going to wait for a train.\nThe train is going somewhere and we\u2019re going to wait for a train. It\u2019s night, it\u2019s a blizzard. It\u2019s\nnight, it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s freezing. We walk from whatever conveyance brought us to this station. I\nremember seeing the little building with the light inside and so forth. Anyway we walk in, a\nblizzard of snow flies in with us. There\u2019s this guy sitting at the desk and there are maybe half a\ndozen people who look like ruffians, men, very rough looking characters sitting on the floor.\nSome are smoking, and they are sort of lounging on the floor on bundles, obviously waiting for\nthe train. We walk in and Jacob is very well dressed and he has these two important looking\nsuitcases and this little child all bundled up. We walk in and there was one other item which I\nforgot, extremely important. The guy at the desk has this telegraph machine and a small radio\nwith a great deal of static and he\u2019s listening to this radio. We come in and we sit separate from\nthese rough looking men. Jacob goes and talks to the man and explains to him that we want to\nget on the train. The man argues with Jacob and says no, no, you can\u2019t get on the train. They\nargue back and forth. Jacob offers him goods, whatever, he\u2019ll pay. The man says no, no. Jacob\nsays what about these men? No, they\u2019re going to sit on top of the cars on the roof of the cars\nand you have a child and those boxes and you can\u2019t... Jacob pleads with him and suddenly the\nradio starts crackling and the man says, quiet, quiet, listen. They all listen and suddenly the\nmen jump up and run to the radio and they crowd around and I have no idea what 1s going on.\nThe static and the men are all excited and suddenly they all begin to cheer, Warsaw 1s liberated!",
        "A: G___ bless you, thank you so much. Isn\u2019t it wonderful, it\u2019s so great. You see, I really belong in\nhistory! Anyway, Jacob opened one of his suitcases and he took out the most treasured of all\nthe possessions, a bottle of vodka! We passed it around, everybody drank from it, these\nruffians...",
        "A: No. The ruffians became our best friends. Suddenly in the middle of this revelry, we heard the\ntrain, toot, toot. The train came and we all rushed outside and the man behind the desk said to\nJacob, listen these men are going on the roof. But if you will do it, you can stand in front of the\nlocomotive. There\u2019s a little guardrail. You\u2019ll stand, hold on to the guardrail. Your little girl will\nstand in front of you. Put your coat around her. Remember, we\u2019ll tie the suitcases on front of\nthe locomotive and remember you\u2019re going to be heading directly into the storm. I don\u2019t\nguarantee that you won\u2019t freeze to death but if you want this train, that\u2019s it. We got on the front\nof the locomotive. Jacob -- I stood in front of him against the guardrail. Jacob\u2019s coat was\nwrapped around me. I leaned against him. The train took off into this blinding snowstorm and\nI don\u2019t know where we went but we were happy.",
        "A: It\u2019s the same, it\u2019s the same. But you see, I fit into this context of time, that\u2019s so exciting! Iam\nso excited. I can\u2019t tell you, it\u2019s so important. January 1945. Fantastic!",
        "A: Yes, because it was winter, it\u2019s all winter, right?",
        "A: Yeah,",
        "A: Summer of \u201942. My G___it sounds like a movie with Elvis Presley or somebody, I don\u2019t know,\nwhatever. That\u2019s it.",
        "A: Thank you so much.",
