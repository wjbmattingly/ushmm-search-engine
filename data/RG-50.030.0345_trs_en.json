        "Q: Mr. Klipp, will you begin by telling me your name, where you were born, and your date\nof birth?",
        "A: My name is David Klipp, I was born July nine, 1905, in a small Lithuanian town called\nSkudy, S-k-u-d-y. Lithuania small little town, where we lived with my grandmother in\ntheir house, the -- all little houses were -- on Fridays, the baker -- there was a bakery\nopen, on the Friday it was -- things so -- baked for the whole week for the family, and so\non, so on. Anyway, is -- my father, and his brother married two sisters. This mean my\nmother\u2019s -- my mother and my uncle\u2019s wife were two sisters. Then there was another\nbrother, too, but I don\u2019t have any recollection where -- I know he should only be in\nFrance somewhere, but I had no contact. My dad, when he was alive, kept all the contact\nwith hi -- with [indecipherable]. No -- in 1907 -- you see, the -- all young men were rev --\neducated in religious thing. Rabbinical preparation, all kind in these thing, there were no\nother type of thing. No -- and my father has a little bit older ideas, too, and he wanted to\nbuild up a better life for his -- for his family. So, when I was two years old, in 1907, he\nwent to the United States. Was in the United States, the first [indecipherable] was how to\n-- peddling, like all the people do, and so on. But later on, he learned to make sweaters,\nand established himself a little factory -- factory -- they call it factory, all there was a\ncouple machines to make sweaters. No -- he was very prosperous, very good, and in 19-\n0-10, he decided he is ready to bring the family to New York, and start in living. So he\ncame back, but my mother didn\u2019t want to go. Her -- her parents were still alive, they lived\nall together, and what is in the United States? Where is it? What -- this is home, they\nknew only their world. So he had no choice, he had to give up the plant, and -- and he\nmoved in 19-0-10. He moved to Lodz, Poland, where he established himself a little\nfactory making sweater. The same thing what he had there. Same thing what he ha --\nwhat they had there, and was a pretty good doing. Then the first World War broke out\n[indecipherable] Poland, 19 fort -- [indecipherable] 1914 in -- and we came to Lodz 1913.\nMy father went 1910, and the rest of the family came 1913. The first World War got\n1914, and Lodz was occupied by the Russian army at thi -- this is part of the Russian\nsphere of interest, or kind of the s -- Poland for -- the country was divided in three parts.\nIt was the -- what they call the congers Poland, were Lodz, Russia, and all this thing. This\nfor they -- they were -- they called the Poland under -- under Austrian supervision, and\nthey\u2019re very compulsive education. And people had to go to school, and people had to\nlearn. The third part were in the area of Fooznine, which was more anti-Semitic oriented\nterritory, so -- and so this was wa -- 19 -- 1914, then the war broke out. Not -- the war\nbroke out, the people gel prepared, Poland can never last five weeks, six weeks. So, what\npeople did, they bought bread, put on cases of loafs of bread, this will keep us over the\nwar, and so on. [indecipherable]. So the war lasted quite a bit, until 1918. Then, the\nPolish armies became alive, too and so on, and there were the Polish armies from the\nRussian territory, the Polish officers were from the Russian army, and is all kind of thing.\nBut Poland became a -- a independent to a certain degree. No political, I don\u2019t recall too\nmany things there, but it -- it changed the whole life, in -- in -- in the whole area. This\nwent on, then the Russian army came into Lodz, I remember the Cossacks when they\ncame in. And naturally they did whatever they want, and when they were going over --\nthey were in Lodz, and they saw a German plane flying overboard, a Russian soldier\npicked up his rifle and shot in the air, he don\u2019t know what he is doing, what he shot, and\nthis you can imagine. But this is the way, the level of the armies what -- of this time. In\nth-this, the war went on, and in 1920 -- 1920, Pilsudski came to power. And Pilsudski\nwas more Socialistic oriented, and he was more cooperating with everything, and so --\nand he was the one. The territory close to the German border what called the Posnine\nregion was there, was General Halla, the anti-Semitic general whose soldiers were\ncatching Jews from deflor, cutting their beard, and so on, all kind of things. In 19 -- Iam\ngoing over fast, but there is not too many things sink. In 1926, I was called to the army.\nYeah, until then, I was working, before, and I worked in a company where I did clerical\nwork, and salers work, some small companies. In 1926, I was called to the -- to the army\nservice. So I went in octo -- On October the 12\", 1926. I had to induct to the army, and I\nwas assigned to the Fosnine region, where General Halla had his say, and so on. I went\nthere, and then there was a very big limitation what a Jew can do, what a Jew cannot do.\nIn the army, the regular probably hear the same thing. They need -- in the beginning they\nneed young people to do -- at least to help, were write and read, and so on. So they\nneeded people to the company office, to write. Who can read and write? Three people\npicked up their hands. I was one of them. I knew I will not make it, but I was one of\nthem. So they called okay, there was one who was by profession a teacher in Poland. So\nthey took him to the office, naturally. And he lasted about three or four weeks, and they\nget him out. Then there was another one who can read and write, some kind -- halfway\neducated. They took him in there, and he only last a few weeks, too. Finally they came to\nthe point there are nobody else. So they decided they have to -- no choice. So I was taken\nto the o -- to the office, and this is not part of the military duty, of going through the\nmilitary training, with all the [indecipherable] all the exercise, and so on, but in -- in\nspare time, day time, lunch time, evening, you do the -- the office work. No --\nexperienced I was, so they very fast decided that I can do the ho -- the payroll for the\ncompany also. Order was I get involved in many thing -- the -- the company payroll for\nthe officers and all kind of things. And this way I get the contact with -- the battalion\ncommander at this time, if I recall, was a majer -- Major Sheemak, in Polish majer, in\nEnglish major. Sheemak was on this way -- he was a son of a very wealthy Polish\nlandowner and so on, so he had his own horse, and all kind of things. But he was a little\nbit a nervous guy. When he went to the casino, and he drank a little bit, he took out his\ngun and shot at a lamp, shot at everything what [indecipherable]. So then what -- after\nthis was over, the following day, he realized, and somehow he knew the battalion\nworking in the -- in the company office -- battalion officer. So he calls me in, and tells\nme, \u201cWhen I go to the casino, and I start to drink, you come with me and take away my\ngun.\u201d Order is order, I did it. And when I came in, he didn\u2019t say anything, just took out\nthe gun and gave it to me. This was -- this was not nice. And this way was on -- I was in\nthe army until I went to the -- exercise the records there and so on, so on. This part of\nPoland belong to the division per -- General Halla was in charge of the whole thing. And\nwhen it came to the examination after the -- the three months, and the commander of the\ninfantry for the division came for the -- for the high ranking general -- came down, then\nnaturally they -- they have the bas -- the exercises. So when they start to ask question\natfil, whatever he asked me to do, and he right away picked on me. And whatever he\nasked me to do, I did. I considered myself a pretty good soldier, and I knew what I am\ndoing. And finally at the afternoon exams in the class, asking question again, and the\nprofessional -- one the officers didn\u2019t know all the answers always, so he picked on me.\nOne of the question was, who did more for Poland, General Halla, or Pilsudski? And\nbehind him, there was standing officers, and he which showed me to mark on the picture\nwhere -- where Halla is. I said, \u201cNo, in mine opinion Pilsudski did more for Poland than\nHalla.\u201d So this way we have a discussion and every question aired, I answered not to --\nnot to his liking. Anyway, this time were over, and then we had to come to the period of\nbeing sworn in. Being sworn in, they took, naturally, because swearing in for Christian\none way, and then all the Jews from the whole area, they took to a Polish son of Kalish,\nand there they bought -- they ordered a rabbi to come there and swear it in. And then, in\nthe meantime, waiting for the rabbi to come and so on, the officers made jokes. Naturally,\nanti-Semitic jokes were no problem there, so they -- they had fun. Finally there came the\nnews that the rabbi arrived. So they had to send a -- a horse and buggy to bring him in.\nCame in a rabbi from the part of Baleetshia what was until the ouster -- occupation, all t -\n- Jew with a -- with a long beard, and so on, spoke a beautiful Polish. And they opened\ntheir eyes, how can he speak Polish like this? And he did his formal thing, and he di --\nswearing in, and during this time they -- they get a little bit respect for him. They didn\u2019t\nexpect him to be such a Polishist. Anyway this -- this went over, and we went back to\nnormal duty. And I was in the army until March of 1928. 1928 I was released and I went\nhome.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a question.",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am.",
        "Q: Was your family fairly religious?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Was your family religious?",
        "A: My family was -- the background was a religious background. This is only thing they will\n-- learned. My father was a great Talmudist. But the goal for you went there is to be\nrabbinical educated, and what is much better than a rabbi, can\u2019t be much more. My father\nhimself was not -- he looked for something else, he had technical thinking and so on.\nThat\u2019s why he went to the United States. So he was -- he went -- he went to the United\nStates, naturally taking all the religious books and so on, and he came [indecipherable]\nthem. Was there he learned English a little bit. Was not a perfect English, but he learned,\nand he loved the United States. And he wanted to come back, but mother didn\u2019t go. So all\nthe way -- our fath -- my father, and my family was the less religious of seven -- of the\nother brothers -- uncles, and so on, so on.",
        "Q: What about when you were in school? Did you go to a Jewish school, or to a spec --",
        "A: I go -- 1t was -- it was a public school, it is called the Yarrowcheeskey gimnasium in pro -\n- in Skudy I went to the haider, to a religious school, to a rabbi. In Lodz when we came,\nwe went -- there was a building, a gimnasium, there were a public school, and then they\nhave all the -- a mechanical school for mechanical engineers. There was a big project,\nand there was donated by a -- by a wealthy family named Yarrowcheeskey. Well this --\ntheir name was called to the whole thing, Yarrowcheeskey school. In the -- in the\nbuilding of the school, they -- all they build -- they build it also a little synagogue, too.\nBut they -- the headmaster of the school was not an observant Jew, he was more\nassimilated. And he was only the one thing, Yom Kippur, to say the high holiday, Kol\nNidre, he has to be there. Thus he is only Jewish is what he displayed there. Not -- my\nfather was -- he had a good voice, was a good singer, and knew how to run services\nbefore a group and so on. And he loved my father. So he want -- he wanted my father\nwhen he is there Kol Nidre, my father has to do it. At one time he was late, and the other\npeople in the temple there, looked at the sun, cannot wait any longer. At san -- a certain\ntime when the sun goes down, you have to do it. So -- and he wasn\u2019t there. So they\ndecided not to wait, and let -- conduct the services. To another fellow, not my father, who\nwas to be in contorial duties once in awhile, conducted the prayer, and serv -- everything.\nAt the end the director came in. His name was Shweitzer. He came in and he find out Kol\nNidre is over. So he insisted -- he insisted that the Kol Nidre will be said again, and my\nfather has to do it. So there was a big rigamarole, it is against the lord, the religious\n[indecipherable] but finally my father said, \u201cLook, for peace, it -- it will no harm than to\nsay it again.\u201d So my father went up and prayed Kol Nidre, and he was really happy, and\nthis is the way it is. Well -- well this is to show that my father was religious, observant,\nbut he was not a fanatic.",
        "Q: Did you have any Gentile friends when you were in school or growing up?",
        "A: No, there were only Jewish boys in the school. The only Jewish boys. And on Saturdays\nyou were going to the temple in the gimnasium, in the building there, and that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: So you were part of a Jewish community in --",
        "A: A Jewish community, that\u2019s right. And this way we were -- we were brought up. No --\nmy mother was born 1892, and she died in 1920, at the age of 28. And this time, children\nwere not told what illness is, or what things this is. What do children know about? So,\nnaturally we didn\u2019t [indecipherable] from observation. From this reached the doctor who\nis -- who was the main doctor to my mother, Dr. Rosenberg, he was in the ghetto also.\nDr. Rosenberg was a neurolo, so I figured all by myself there is something to do with\nneurology. So -- and my mother was extremely religious observant, she didn\u2019t do -- at\nthat time, the -- the doctor said you have to eat something fat, you have to eat not kosher\nmeat, but eat what you need is fat. You could not convince her, there is no way. So my\nfather brought in a rabbi who lived not far, to try to explain her that even by Jewish law,\nto save a life you can -- you can eat things what you are not usually do. But, it didn\u2019t\nwork. There was no way. She died as a result of her illness as the Dr. Rosenberg was\ncoming there, and so on, and she died on -- in Lodz, in her bed.",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers or sisters?",
        "A: I had a brother and two sisters. My two sister -- my older sister went to unise -- my father\nwas later very much for sending the children to the United States. So, in the meantime my\nmother died, and my -- and my father was left with my older sister, myself, and the sister\nwas born 1911, and the boy was born 1916. So my sister went to the United States in\n1922, went to the -- to the United States, and -- and I rejected. And I said, \u201cI am not\ngoing, I will stay with you. Whatever I can help with the family we will do together,\u201d and\nSO on, so on. So it was not the easier time, but we survived. My father had worked on the\njob, too, so in the meantime he was coming home a few times to check what we are\ndoing, and I was very helpful in raising the whole family, and so on. No -- my -- and then\ncame the -- the war. The first war was 1914, 19 -- 18 - 19 - 20, we over this. The\nGermans started the war on September the first, 1939. This --",
        "Q: Let me ask -- before we get to that, let me just ask you a question.",
        "A: Please.",
        "Q: When you were a boy, and when you were a young adult, were you involved in any\npolitical organizations, any Zionist movements, anything?",
        "A: I was interested in Zionist movement, and I belonged to a group what was into Zionist\nthing. And I was attending their meetings and so on, and I was very much interested in\nIsrael at this time. So this is the -- the way of life, what with the -- so I attended this as\nmuch time as I had. I had to work, too. And be a -- with my work, no matter what I did, I\ncould help the family a little bit, which was very important.",
        "Q: Were these organizations popular?",
        "A: This 0 -- oh yeah, this was the well-known Zionist organization, a group called\nYidaktout. The head of it was Dr. Takover [indecipherable] died in Israel. And --",

        "A: The goal organization was for Israel -- for Zionist movements, and to be able to build up\na--a--a--a--a--a Israel in -- in -- in post-war. You see, this was the war effort. No --\nat this time there were not too many people were -- were sent to Israel to -- to kibbutz and\nso on, to work. But my interest was with the family, to help as much as I could.",
        "Q: Before the war began with the Germans --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: How much did you know about Hitler, and what was going on in Germany?",
        "A: I was very, very much aware. You see, I was interested in the anti-Hitler movement, and\nhere now was a lady by the name of Iren Hairind, I-r-e-n Hairind H-a-1-r-i-n-d. Iren\nHairind did a publication, monthly publication called Garaishdifite, which is justice. And\nthere she reported everything what she knew -- what she find out from Germany, so on,\nso on. So I was a subscriber to this. I worked on the job, and I did very well, and -- and\nshe -- and I was -- as -- a subscriber to this. I worked for a man by the name of Anatole\nFunkin. Mr. Funkin was a very well to do -- a Jewish family from before the war, and\nyou know, Jews could not keep in Petersburg -- this is the capital of -- of Russia unless he\nwas a -- big merchant. No -- my father\u2019s father was building railroads in Russia, so\nnatural he was entitled to go. And his son graduated from law in Petersburg in 1890 -\nsomething. My father was born 1876. Somehow my father met Mr. Funkin after the war,\nI was back already from the Polish army. And I worked on the job, and yet, at one point\nthere were in Poland three main factories of artificial silk -- the big ones. The most for the\nFrench capital. And in order to get the representation for this one, people paid money for\nit, and -- and gave deposits, and ba -- the guarantees, whatever they had. But it didn\u2019t\nwork out with some of them, and at one point Mr. Funkin was offered , if he\n[indecipherable] to say yes, so he will get the representation of the one company, which\nwas named the Hodakoof. Now, Mr. Funkin, he was us visiting, he was not leaving, he\ncame [indecipherable] so on. He had suites in all major towns in Europe, mostly\nSwitzerland, Zurich so on, Warsaw. And Mr. loo -- and at this time, when he was offered\nthis representation, he happened to be in Lodz, and my father knew him, how I don\u2019t\nknow, but -- and he wanted to meet me. And I was working on a job when I came out\nfrom the army. I was working there since 1928. So at one evening I went to meet him,\nand he told me what he has -- he was a very well educated elderly gentleman. And he --\nand he told me he will only take it if I will work for him. So I told him I need a few\nweeks to [indecipherable] my [indecipherable] there. So I decided in four weeks I should\nbe ready. When I came after four weeks to -- to take over the job, he was out of town. No\n-- the other man in the company [indecipherable] by the name of Vinerice. Vinerice was\nthe president of the Cheskloveena lodge, and was in these areas. So I come in, and I --\nthey locate me, I say, \u201cMr. Funkin hired me to start.\u201d \u201cOh, he forgot to tell me.\u201d But\nwhen you told me he hired, you would do whatever you want.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #IT'wo",
        "Q: You worked in this business for how long?",
        "A: In this particular business, I sel -- no, I was start working for them for 16 years old. And\ndifferent places were [indecipherable] town so on, so on. On this particular job we\u2019re\nafter -- we were -- I -- I started in 1928, and I took over the -- yet -- Funkin job in 1932.\nSo -- and then -- and I wot -- I established myself pretty -- really in the community too. I\nhad a name, and my personal card opened doors to many places, and so on. There was at\ntime that -- in Poland was very anti-Semitic, and [indecipherable] all over, and there were\nno -- as I said, we were -- we were married July the second in 1933, we went away for a\nfew weeks, and then we came back to work. Had my apartment, and Ill even -- Mr.\nFunkin, his family from his life had two big buildings, where I was there managing, too. I\nhad the [indecipherable] for tony for them, and so on. And I had there one apartment for\nmyself. No -- the orderzite I married my stepmother\u2019s younger sister. She was a teacher.\nAnd then in 1936, she became pregnant. And so I ask her, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to work, it is\nalready -- the school is end pretty soon, and now, no harm will ti -- be taken to the\nchildren if you don\u2019t finish with them. Let somebody else take over.\u201d In order to\nconvince me -- and she wanted to be -- somebody might do harm to the children, judging\nwrong, whatever it is. So, in order to convince, she, without my knowledge, she went to\nthe -- to the top doctor where all the big ladies were going, [indecipherable] and so on.\nAnd came back, and -- and brought me a letter from him, he didn\u2019t see any danger in her\ncontinue working. But it wasn\u2019t so. At one night she became very, very ill, and there was\nnowhere to go, nowhere to do. There was a clinic at -- kind of a hospital what was a\nmostly frequented by the poor part of the people, the rich didn\u2019t go there, and -- and\nthere\u2019s a -- not far from my house, and I had to take her to a -- to a hospital\n[indecipherable]. So fi -- I -- I called up, and they told me yeah, I can bring her. So I\nwent, said then call up the doctor. Cause there were no doctor and so on. So he says, Ooh\nyeah, if I -- if I get 20 zloty, I,\u201d -- so in middle of the night, \u201cif I get 20 zloty, I -- I will\ncome.\u201d 20 zloty was like hundred dollar here, at this time was money. I said, \u201cLook you\njust come there, and the money is waiting for you here.\u201d He came in the middle of the\nnight to that thing. It turned out my wife was in the seventh month of pregnancy and had\nto have a -- so that they [indecipherable] it was not easy, and she almost paid with her life\nfor it, but survived. Naturally, we did everything, but what could be done? And after all\nshe never regained her health completely. After a long time the doctor says oh, and we --\nyou are having a f -- a very comfortable job, and -- and she was conducting -- still\nteaching a little bit, [indecipherable] little for do something for awhile, then she had to\ngive it up, too. So we were living the -- the I-life at this time was in -- in Poland at this\ntime, the big meal [indecipherable] the evening. Lunchtime with the -- with the big meal\nis there, so usually people met on Saturday, Sunday in the caf\u00e9 houses, which has a live\nband playing and so on, for a tea, whatever -- before they went out for -- for dinners, and\nthis was our life, too. This was we were doing. Yo --",
        "Q: So all of this -- you\u2019ve mentioned several times that there was a lot of anti-Semitism.",

        "A: Anti-Semi --",
        "Q: Did this concern you? I mean, you knew what was happening in Germany. You were\nexperiencing problems --",
        "A: No, this was -- this was before. You see, the Christian church in Poland blamed the Jews\nfor Jesus\u2019 death. And in -- in Germany after the war, a Catholic priest, a good friend of\nmy told me he knew, and -- and everybody knew this is not the case, but this was the\ncause the church used. And this -- so this was the anti-Semitism, was part of Poland\u2019s\nlife. And this was really helpful to Germans when they came in, to -- to drag down Jews,\nand so every Polish little kinder, five, six years old, could show all, hey, Jew, so someone\ntook him away to work [indecipherable] and so on. This is the way the life was.",
        "Q: Tell me about the first day of the -- when the Germans came in.",
        "A: The German crossed the border on September the first. And this time we didn\u2019t know --\nwe knew this they were [indecipherable] and so on. We were -- we were home sleeping at\n-- at one time in -- what four o\u2019clock in the morning, five o\u2019clock in the morning, a friend\nof my -- a -- a MD who was living a few houses away, knocked at the door and came in,\nand said, \u201cY-You are still sleeping? Everybody\u2019s running -- everybody\u2019s running away,\nand so from the Germans, the Germans are coming.\u201d I say -- running -- fighting 1s not my\nnature, I never went. So I say okay, I will get up, get dressed, I will see what the situation\nis over there and so on. And then the rumors for the women -- to women they didn\u2019t do\nanything, the Germans, but men they take away, either with the work here and there, and\nso on. So it was everybody were -- all men went -- tried to get away. Finally, I was talked\ninto -- about eight o\u2019clock in the morning, to go. So with my brother and a third man who\nworked for me, we were walking toward Warsaw. Nobody expected that Warsaw will be\ncapitulated in a -- in a short time. I was living in Rosso at the time, in -- in the building on\nAubushna six. Aubushna six I had friends of my, and we were stay -- and I was staying\nwith them. And -- and Aubushna six was across the Polish theater, where the Polish\npolice from towns were there staying, and so on, so on. So at one time they had to bomb\nthe buildings, too. But everybody say there was a retired general living in the building\nyou saw, every shot would hear, he said, the old people are being shot. And then finally\nat one night, this was on the 25\" of September, a bomb hit the building. And we were on\nthe -- on the fourth floor. The sixth, and -- and the fifth floor collapse. We were on the\nfourth floor, and everything was burning around, and we had to start the war. Had to start\nthe war, and the [indecipherable] I don\u2019t know. So my brother and the three of men\n[indecipherable] we were walking. And the whole city was in flame, in fire. Everywhere\nwe went you couldn\u2019t pass by. Dead people and animal on the -- on the streets lying, this\nwas a chaos completely. And [indecipherable] we saw this way, the whole night until we\nfind the hideeron. Hideeron so on, until the morning. And then there was no -- yeah, but\nthis time the German already came in. there. And we were running toward Warsaw,\nrunning to get away from the German, maybe they will just stop, maybe they will never\nstopped. Wherever we went, everything was burning.",
        "Q: I\u2019m a little confused. When you\u2019re talking about the building being bombed --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: This is in Warsaw or in Ldodz?",
        "A: In Warsaw. The big building where I was the [indecipherable] floor. And so then we\nwere run to Warsaw and everything was afire. So we had to s -- we had to start to go -- go\nto a -- Warsaw, what we thought it might be safe and so on. It took us more than a week,\ncause we couldn\u2019t -- daytime you couldn\u2019t walk, so we had to lie down hidden\nsomewhere. And nights you could walk. And finally we came to -- shortly before\nWarsaw, we came on foot so -- and -- and -- and then the population, mostly the Jewish\npopulation ha -- had prepared drinks, and broth, and everything to try to help us to get\n[indecipherable]. But the main thing was, took us over the bridge. And this was the main\npart. So I put myself up further to the bridge and there -- and there is lying a Polish\nofficer, waiting too. And I ask him how it is. He says, \u201cLook, this is a I-long place was --\nis constantly bombed. And here, if you don\u2019t catch the moment between one set of flares\ngets away, and -- and the other comes, you might make it.\u201d We did. I saw\n[indecipherable] let\u2019s fly -- with away, so P\u2019Il know whatever it is, we have to make it. So\nwe on, and we crossed the long bridge, closer to Warsaw. There was a place called\nMajdanek if I remember right, and there the people were standing, helping us with food,\nwhatever it is. Then, finally we -- we came into Warsaw, and the German came into\nWarsaw, I think it was on September the 25\". When I heard the s -- the German are\nalready here and so on, so I -- so I approach the German column, and an officer was\nthere, and I ask him if he can tell me if the way to Lodz is safe for me to walk -- to start\nto do. He looks at me for awhile, and then he say, \u201cI on your place would go to\nPalestine.\u201d So, nothing we could do. We started to make our way, slowly different ways\ngoing back to Lodz and it took us a long time, and we had to -- walking and hiding and\nall kind of things. And we came to Lodz at one evening. We went in to the side of the\ncemetery there, and I paid somebody to go in and call up my wife, tell her that I am here.\nHe took the money, but they never made the call, I found out later. The other fellow -- at\nthe evening when it was dark, we took the freight car, we had no choice. And we went\non, we made it home. Now then, from this one 1s -- life was different that the German\ncame, and the German tried to take away every house where they can and so on. And I\nwas managing the two big apartment houses for my bosses, too, but at this time there was\nno managing at all. I had -- I couldn\u2019t do anything. So just living there, staying there for\nawhile. I had, before the war, working at Funkin, I had contact -- they were in Poland,\nwere at a lot of companies owned by people who came years ago from Germany,\nmanufacture, so on. The young, when hi -- when Hitler came to power, the young\ngeneration, the young Germans went to Germany, and they became the Hatenkroitzer and\nthis all kind of things. I had a conflict w-with -- with one company, who was very good,\nvery -- but the experience was when you see -- they were paying a lot with backslip.\nThose were checks with a longer period of time, so on. 60 days, 90 days, and -- and I had\nsome from the company [indecipherable] checks from other people, other name. And one\ncheck came back from my exper -- and my practice was mail it to them, and they will\nsend me back a check. [indecipherable] I mailed it, but I never heard anything back,\nbecause the young fellow was in head office, he was already away in Germany. And he\nwasn\u2019t -- so -- but he came back, as I was still in the building, leaving there. And I saw\nhim through the window coming in, so I opened the door, and I approached him in\nGermany, and say, \u201cYou are coming to -- to collect a debt.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, Mr. Klipp,\nI am -- Iam coming to pay a debt.\u201d And apologized for this what happened, and so on.\nNow, he was a uniform with the arm band, with all kind German things. And that\u2019s the\nway it was until we were living in the apartments, I was at my father with his family, and\n[indecipherable] and then until January 16.",
        "Q: Was your father able to continue his business?",
        "A: Father was sick, and I couldn\u2019t get the medical help for him. There was -- there was no\ndoctor who could go to a Jew, and there was no way, and he had the illness, and finally\nhe died on January 16, 1940, in his bed. I was at his bed. And the only thing we do is that\n-- use connections to be able to bury him in the cemetery, and this was it.",
        "Q: What other kinds of changes happened after the Germans took over, for Jewish people?",
        "A: When the German took over there, they first of all, they -- they fight to get all the Jews to\nwork. And then their main thing was to get the Jews out of central town. They establish --\nit was already toward the end of nine -- of -- of \u201939. There was already rumors of a\n[indecipherable] assigned as a ghetto. And -- and they tried to force people to move there\nas fast as you can by their own and so on. But I couldn\u2019t [indecipherable] cause my father\nwas still alive, but when he died, a day after, they came in, and gave me 10 minutes to\nwalk out of the building, and take whatever I can carry, nothing else. So we took\nwhatever we can and -- and we start to walk toward the ghetto. And -- and my -- my\nfriend there empty a room, empty apartment on one street, on Zigilska 36. So I went in\nand listen, there was no question asked. They open the door, you go in, and you are there.\nAnd this was the main street, where they build later the main artery, where they separated\nwith two halfs of the ghetto. So then --",
        "Q: Pri -- prior to this in Lodz, were businesses confiscated?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Could people continue going to school?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What was the life like for Jews?",
        "A: People couldn\u2019t whatever, the life stopped. Everything was -- there was no more life.\nPeople just tried to get out, and they were encouraging with many ways to people to\nmove away f-from there. So people were constantly moving, going, and so on. For\nexample, my mother\u2019s family carried f -- 40 jar, things with -- out there. I couldn\u2019t do it. I\nwas told only whatever I can have on my shoulder, and go. So it was -- there was no life\nany more after this, until the ghetto, and then we didn\u2019t know what.",
        "Q: What -- were there a lot of the -- were there attacks in the street, were the Germans\naround?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Every Pole you saw a Jew here attack them or took them away, can\u2019t do this, do\nthis, do this, and so on. And they were -- and the Germans were just -- they didn\u2019t care\nfor this -- or wa -- they didn\u2019t care to -- to defend, whatever it is. They let them do\nwhatever they want, this was helpful to them.",
        "Q: So the Poles were attacking you?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, the Poles, and the German was helping them. A little Polish boy had a German\nsoldier, and -- and he told him, he is a Jew, and okay, and this [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was this something if you were walking the streets you would see?",
        "A: I -- oh yeah, [indecipherable] from the streets. I had in the building where I was living,\nand what was owned by my -- by Mr. Funkin, by my boss. I -- I -- I had a tenant who was\nfrom Germany region, the family, many, many years ago. And these were good friends,\nalways, and we still good friends. So at one time then I n -- I was in a jam, I went to\nevery -- and advice, what should I do? I couldn\u2019t do this, I couldn\u2019t do this. So I decided\nto up to his door, he wa -- lived on the second floor, and go in and try to talk to him. The\nfamily knew me very well. And I come to the door, and his son opened the -- the -- let me\nin, and I see a German uniform hanging in sight. So he right away came out to say, don\u2019t\nworry, this is my nephew. Don\u2019t worry, you come in, and whatever I can do, tell me. So I\ntell him what -- in the meantime we\u2019re going in a conversation with the nephew. And the\nnephew, a young soldier tells me that we lost the war at this time. So I\u2019m telling him,\n\u201cLook, you are a member of a army who walks every day ahead, ahead, ahead. And you\nare tell me they lost the war?\u201d There is a German word, zieg, zieg, this means that we get\nsomething, we ge -- com -- he says, \u201cHerr -- herr Klipp, visignu stott.\u201d This means you\nare getting so much of this good, that we are die from it. And couple years later I was in\nthe ghetto already, I received a -- he sent me in a communication by somebody that his\nnephew died on the front. Non -- at this time they -- okay, this was -- the German -- under\nthe German occupation, there couldn\u2019t be -- naturally there was nothing. My father died,\nso I had to go to the ghetto. The ghetto I --",
        "Q: Were you -- one question -- one more question and then we\u2019ll talk about the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you aware of any Einsatzgruppen activities?",
        "A: Of what?",
        "Q: Einsatzgrup.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: In L6\u00e9dz?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: They were. The Einsatzgruppen were in the ghetto, in the part of the ghetto, and they all -\n- all around. They made a fence around the ghetto, and where we get close to the fence,\ncould be shot.",
        "Q: And this was Einsatzgruppen?",
        "A: The Einsatzgruppen with -- the Einsatzgruppen with the whole -- the -- I think there was\nsome regular SS or regular army also, but mostly Einsatzgrup were the one who was\nmarching with all thing. So it is -- it was no way -- again already the ghetto was\nestablished, and Roomkofsky was the head of the ghetto.",
        "Q: How -- how did he become the head of the ghetto?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: How was he chosen?",
        "A: He was chosen because he had a big head of white hair, an older, which means he can be\nthe altesta -- the oldest of the Jews. About --",
        "Q: Was he the head of the Jewish community before?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we did, but those were all Orthodox so -- and they were not acceptable, and\nthere were no Jewish community, they were all gone. The -- the Jewish community\nbefore the war didn\u2019t exist any more. It was a new -- new life in the ghetto. There are mid\n-- there are different opinions of what -- Roomkofsky, I didn\u2019t judge him so bad, okay?\nNo -- Roomkofsky\u2019s goal was to try to have as many possible Jews to survive. Naturally\nhe was under orders from the Germans. Veego was the head of the ghetto ferbotten. His\nassistant was a fellow by the name of Bardfish. But we had in the ghetto a circle -- we\nhad one fellow who was listening to the BBC news every day. And he was making up\nlittle notes that most political value for us, and I was getting such a note every day. I was\n-- there\u2019s not too many people hear that, but I was one who will get it. When somebody\ncame in and gave me a piece of paper, I knew what it did, and is that. No -- this fellow\neventually when they -- when they caught up with him, he committed suicide, hanged\nhimself. His name was Hayden Vidofsky. And was -- he didn\u2019t want to follow life in the\nGermans\u2019 hand. And dote -- the German head as you know, a krippo [indecipherable]\nside, there they were calling Jewish and tried to get away -- all Jews had to work, the\nJews were hiding, the Jews did all kind of things they wanted. And from time to time the\n[indecipherable] they were brought to the krippo. There were only -- they -- there were\nalso Jews who worked with the Germans in -- in the krippo. They used them to\n[indecipherable] to [indecipherable] to bring something, to some -- whatever it is. Now, I\nwas the office manager of the fiflagunsaftargum, in the ghetto. Which means the\ndepartment where all the food to the ghetto, for the Jews, whatever the German assigned,\ncame in to us.",
        "Q: How did you get this job?",
        "A: Mr. Roomkofsky wanted to get me in the beginning. I understood -- I found that out later.\nThere was a -- a lady by the name of Jacobson. Hers -- her son was a lawyer, and she\nwanted to promote her son, and when she get wind that Roomkofsky would like to -- to\nsee me, I never get called to see him, until there was a change later, Mr. Stalshi Jacobson,\nby way was related to my -- relation t-to -- I know you very well as a kid. And but she\nmaneuvered him, and I was not notified until there was a change. Jacobson was at once to\na different position, and somebody else came in to his office to be the office manager,\nand in the drawer they found my name that Roomkofsky wanted to see me, which I never\nknew.",
        "Q: Did you know Roomkofsky before the war?",
        "A: I met him one -- I knew about him, but I met him once, okay?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he was -- Roomkofsky himself was under the -- into very big pressure from the\nGermans, naturally, and he tried to get as many people to survive, as many possible, so\non. So his approach to the Germans was, we have people of every line of work, we can\ndo all type of work for the German could use, and what a German population can use.\nAnd he establish working results for all kind of things. And the German were taking\nadvantage of it too. They were using it and so on. So he was a couple time taken away by\nthe German out of town again, but after a few days, I don\u2019t think -- you see, Mr.\nRoomkofsky\u2019s secretary was a lady by the name of Dora Fuchs. Dora Fuchs was o -- the\nfamily originally from Poland, and many years ago, like many, they went to Germany.\nThey settled in Hanover, in Germany. And this Dora Fuchs became the secretary to\nRoomkofsky.",
        "Q: I think we need --\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Okay?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. Noy -- so he had to change of s-secretary, and he found so -- Jacobson to the legal\ndepartments, Jacobson was the lawyer. So, at this time came a new secretary to him, and\nopened the door and see a note to get me to see Roomkofsky. So -- and he knew me, so\nhe -- the following day I -- I was told to go to see Roomkofsky. So I went to see\nRoomkofsky. I come there to a office, we are standing around, people everywhere.\nRabbis, near rabbis, pela -- people, police, you name it, everybody was there. And he was\nmeeting somebody in his office. Finally he came out, and he looked around, \u201cI want to\nsee you.\u201d Left everybody stay and called me in, I\u2019m going in. He said, \u201cLook, I have a\nbig mess in the fiflagunsaftargum,,\u201d in there. This mean where the all food can be in the\naprovasultsia, the -- all the food came in at once [indecipherable] there was a big mess. \u201cI\nwant you to go right away there, take it over, and make order.\u201d No far I knew about him,\nthat there is no -- if I -- I cannot go tell anybody what I\u2019m going to do, I went right away\nover there, and I am working. He might think he\u2019s a -- he [indecipherable] I come by\nhorse and buggy, but I have to walk. So I went over there, actually there, and there was a\nfellow the -- 0 -- who head his office by the name of Roderusser, and he was unhappy\nwith him. And Roderusser was not a real professional, there\u2019s a different story. So I come\nin, and I said, \u201cRoderusser, look, don\u2019t worry. We will go, put everything together. They\nwill arrange it, and once you will [indecipherable] in the -- in the certain order we will, it\nwill work by themselves, unfort.\u201d\u2019 So, Roderusser was very afraid, because Roomkofsky\ngot aggravate, he could send him away right away to -- to be transported out to -- to\nAuschwitz, whatever it is. And -- but, he didn\u2019t do it. S --",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019m going to stop you one moment. Stop tape please. Okay.",
        "A: Okay. What was there -- you see, the Jewish bakeries from before the war, that were\nthere over on the ghetto, they were baking bread. And they had to come to buy flour to\nthe fiflagum sometime. So what they bought in their Polish money, they didn\u2019t get this\nback, because th-the German took away the Polish money, they didn\u2019t get the money.\nAnyway, when they -- this way he -- he came to transfer out the money and so on. I head\nthe department with a head cashier. There were five people working with us, to get the\nmoney, sort it out, but -- and so on. The -- the head cashier was a professional cashier\nfrom before the war, from a big bank. From the same bank where -- becau -- the\n[indecipherable] Mr. Rosenblatt came. I knew about her, I didn\u2019t know her. So -- but --\nand she was just as a -- before the war, slowly do it, one time, think of another and so on.\nThe ghetto was no time for it. So finally I saw the one day, it doesn\u2019t work. So I tells her,\n\u201cLook, Mrs. Steinbeck, you sit down at the corner, I will operate the cashier\u2019s office. You\nsit down there and watch me. And then you tell me if you can do it or not.\u201d The following\nday, the old people got there, and counting the money, sorting out, and I was sitting there,\nand I was doing the same time, collecting while I am paying out money, collecting, what\nshe say it couldn\u2019t be done. Circumstances are different, this is a war. So I worked there\nfor a whole day. At the end of the day she came into there, \u201cMr. Klipp, I will do it.\u201d\nOkay, good. That\u2019s all I needed. And then the money -- what the Jewish bakers brought\nin, the following day, the Germans took away. There came a Mr. Schwinn was his name,\na German from the ghetto Vivaldin, he came to collect the money and so on. So, from\nnow on she was -- she was handling this, and I was to get myself back to the office,\nbefore the people -- and I had people whom I knew from -- from before the war, most\naccountants I knew, and they knew me and so on. So it\u2019s all cloc pretty well. We\nsomehow man -- and Roomkofsky came after awhile, it didn\u2019t take long, I was there, and\nhe was there. So I told him, Mr. Roomkofsky, mis -- [indecipherable] I think we called\nhim, \u201cIt will be straightened out. Let me get to him orientity of what is, and I will assure\nyou after I finish, I will be able to tell you that everything works.\u201d Turned around, went\naway. And I started to organize the things, organize the people to work and so on. And 19\n-- going back to Roomkofsky as a person, as a character, what it is. In 1942, he sent us in\n5,000 from Czechoslovakia, and 5,000 from Vienna, and 5,000 from Berlin. And then\nanother transfer to 5,000 from Czechoslovakia. Most of them exsembly rich people. The\nlagers we told this what they had, this is the first time they had, they came in to the\nghetto. So, had to find to do something and so on. Among them was a Mr. Hirsch. Mr.\nHirsch was on the -- on the board of most of the heavy industry in Czechoslovakia, a\ngreat lawyer with a big legal office, and so on. And he was a sick man. Now, I tried to\nhelp him as much as you could. At the same time we were getting in potatoes. What\nhappened? My [indecipherable] always. You know that from the farmer to get permission\nfor one shipment of -- of -- of potatoes, with the same permission we get five, six, seven,\neight shipments of potatoes. So the whole night we are working, and I was working with\nthem. We are working with a little hand wagon what they pushed, what they pulled, and\nso on there, but they -- just to get away from the -- from the place where they are. At the\nsame time, I had to watch to make Roomkofsky satisfied too, that -- that I am not\nproblem. Among these people, as I say, was a Mr. Hirsch, extremely wealthy man, and\nMr. Hirsch showed me, \u201cMr. Klipp, when the war ends, half what I have is yours.\u201d So I\nthought myself, first let\u2019s survive, and then we\u2019ll talk. Then, as -- so, what I do with these\npeople? So, there was a little shack in the corner of the fiflagunsaftargum,, there was a\nlittle shack. I put in in this shack a long table with benches, and -- and there I -- I working\nfive people, Mr. Hirsch was among them, who couldn\u2019t do anything else, they were not\nused to anything else. Everybody had their pencil with the pad and sitting there. And\nnobody knew about this arrangement, the [indecipherable]. Mr. Roomkofsky discovered\nit one time when he was down there, gwaiting to corner. \u201cHey, hey,\u201d comes in there,\n\u201cwhat is this? What are the people doing here?\u201d So I tell him, \u201cPresent, they are waiting\nfor the soup.\u201d He looked at me, turned around, went out without saying a word. So, I had\nto -- so Iam almost legal with them -- having them. So they were work over there, and\nwere -- they sitting there hours, and waiting for the soup, then the soup came, then they\nwent, and they sit -- went to their families, to the qualas, wherever they are. This was\ngoing on for [indecipherable] Roomkofsky, his reaction, what a deleeng I told him they\nwait for the soup. This was for him -- and this told me a lot about him. He wanted to -- I\nknew about him more than I knew him, what I hear, these activities and -- in -- in -- in --\nin the homes for children with their parents, all kind of things. In the part of the Lodz -- I\nwas actually in the same place, in different part of town. So at one time he -- he called\nme, and he said look, here 1s a big -- here 1s a family what the father\u2019s going into the\narmy, and he has a family of small children. If I take care of the smallest, he will take\ncare of the bigger ones. He -- a deal. So I say, I\u2019ll put in the smallest children in the order\nof [indecipherable] and so on. Anyway, this -- this worked pretty good with him. This\nwent on until -- and yeah, and -- and every day Mr. Shrink was coming, collecting the --\nthe -- the -- the Polish money, take away the order. At the same time Mr. Meemorf, who\nwas before the war a coffee merchant, a big coffee merchant, and he created for himself,\nafter the war he should have something too. So he was sending in to the ghetto things like\ncacao, tea, rice, something like it -- it was -- what he couldn\u2019t touch, and told not to\ntouch it. And whatever a transport came in of his things, the following day he was in, and\nI had to give him a report what I have. Match a long paper, everything was beautiful. It\nalways match. But, I had people with epidamia, dysentaria, all kind of, all kind of -- and\nrice was the only thing what I had. So I had the -- the man who -- who headed the\n[indecipherable] the magazine, a fellow Moshberg, he didn\u2019t survive, I -- he was a very\nnice guy, so I told him, \u201cLook, let\u2019s opim a sacrifice, and when people call, they having\ndysentaria with the -- give them a little bit rice, so nobody should know that you were the\nonly one who can give what they need.\u201d And this [indecipherable] for awhile. So finally\nthe German collected all -- all the money and so on, and I s -- falsified Roomkofsky with\nthe cash -- with the -- with the handling and so on, and it worked smoothly. So -- so the\noffice worked, and I could award it to myself too, to taking care of [indecipherable] and\nall kind of things.",
        "Q: Estelle -- it -- we\u2019re hearing it --",
        "A: So, and this was -- the ghetto was goin -- going like it -- like this until they -- they started\nto liquidate the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay, then let\u2019s -- I want to ask you questions --",
        "A: Well now [indecipherable]",
        "Q: [indecipherable] if that\u2019s okay. You were talking about Roomkofsky.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I think that he was controversial in many ways.",
        "A: He what?",
        "Q: Was controversial.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: People felt that there was a lot of corruption with the officials, and the police, and do --\nwas that something you were aware of?",
        "A: Oh yeah. In cases like this, without corruption, nothing can be done. You see, what is,\nthere was more -- most people who were involved there -- he was the head of the ghetto\nfor about -- of the ghetto, Roomkofsky, but then the other department, who could make\nall those deals with the Germans to duplicate or triplicate potatoes, shipments, all kind of\nthis. Somebody who knew the underworld a little bit. And there was -- and fellows who\nwere active in the more advanced under-underground thing, they came to power, and they\nwere -- would they know how to handle, how to buy, whom to buy, what to buy with, and\nso on. And there was -- and this was the main thing, was nothing what they could do to it.\nYou see, he thi -- this is the way we are getting 1n potatoes much more than we -- than we\nshould have, and all the food items, and so on, so on. But all lead to their activities, 1t was\na means for us to get it.",
        "Q: So you got more than -- than what you were officially allowed?",
        "A: Oh yeah, no question about. You see, the -- whatever they officially send in, that the\nghetto can afford, 1t was divided by the corporation, by so many, and we have distribution\npoints, and we gave out, whenever this [indecipherable] what is the number of people in\nthis area, and we gave them as much people a -- a -- as much food as was there. But\nnothing officially came in. The unofficial we couldn\u2019t touch. So it was a -- there is -- ina\ncase like this there were no normalities, forget about normality at this time. Everything --\nmost people from the -- I would call them underground for this. But most people came to\npower, came to di -- let\u2019s say we created a sondercommando, was created in ghetto. The\npurpose of the -- of the sondercommando was to -- to try to get from the Jews the jewel,\ntheir values, whatever this is, and so on, and give them to the German. Now those people\nare involved in it, they are people too. So they knew how to handle who could work, no --\nthe -- the head of the department was a fellow by the name of David Yeelgla. He himself\nhas a background, what I don\u2019t know. He became a big man in the ghetto. His assistant\nwas a fellow by the name of Mark Kleeger, whom I knew. And Mark Kleeger was the\neducated fellow, and -- and no other one was the -- doing, the connection, the bribing, the\nall -- the all kind of things. And this ghetto -- how they, if they collected something, what\nthey did, they give in to the German or not. Naturally there were [indecipherable] and\nyou couldn\u2019t expect -- if they had to bribe German, they had to take it from somewhere,\nso they took from the [indecipherable] and buy the German whatever it is. It is in -- in\nsuch a time there is very hard to -- to talk about legal, and with lawyer, with problems,\nand this is the way they get the [indecipherable] it.",
        "Q: But was it a situation where the people who had some power, their families were much\nbetter taken care of --",
        "A: Yes, there was --",
        "Q: -- while people were starving?",
        "A: -- there was. Mr. Roomkofsky had a group of people who used to get what they call\ntalons. The leader of the department was a Miss Ivershitz, yeah Ivershitz. And she gave --\nand people of those families were in charge of something, who were -- who were\nconsidered helping Roomkofsky run the whole thing, they were getting talons for their\nfamilies. Was --",
        "Q: Will you just explain what a talon is?",
        "A: A talon, there was such a coupon to go and pick up some food, whatever it is, to different\ndepartments. That\u2019s a -- but --",
        "Q: Well I -- yeah -- explain that again, though, there was a car honking.",
        "A: Oh-oh. A talon, what you call that this thing was a piece of paper what Roomkofsky\ndepartment gave out for those people to go to a meat department, get some meat, to this\nto get some these, and so on, and he -- no, we had in ghetto the -- another thing, too.\nThose Jews who worked [indecipherable] krippo, and those Jews who worked with the\nkrippo, they were going to town with the krippos, and so on, so on. And they were always\ncoming in and he need a loaf of bread for a German, [indecipherable] for themse -- this\nthe way it went. I gave it to them. Those people that are going, and there was we -- we\nhave no medication, for example. And medication was a very important thing for a lot of\npeople. The most thing, B12 was a very -- why tha -- those people who were working\nwith the Germans to ghetto, they could get it if I contact them. So, there was a fellow\nwhom I knew, some wa -- he came to ask for something, and I used this connection. The\nname was Wortman, he was old. [indecipherable] to talk with them, and so on, so on.\nAnd I always told him I have a request for these, for [indecipherable] for other thing, and\nhe tried to get me, because he wanted something in return, bread, or whatever it is. And\nthis way -- and this was my contact with the -- with the unofficial [indecipherable]\ndepartment [indecipherable] to use them as much as I could. And -- and when I get\nmedication, I had the problem who to give it. If I had a secretary to the fiflagunsaftargum\n-- Dagushensky, Yelsi Dagushensky, her father was before the war the -- the cormeister\nfor the Jewish temple. And he was a sick man, a elderly man. And I get one medication\nwhat she needs for her father, and then was a young mother who need it. Who should I\ngive it to you? I give it to the young mother. And -- and I became a -- a enemy of\nDagushensky because I felt a y -- a young mother with a -- with a little baby, if you\ncouldn\u2019t help her, we are in -- we are in a pievin to a certain way, we have to make\nchoices what are not normally done, but has to be done. So this way -- this way it works.",
        "Q: Were you able to help a lot of people in your position?",
        "A: I did. As much as I could. Every time this Mr. Wortman went to town with a krippo, I\ngive [indecipherable] and I was sitting and waiting, and finally I -- get me these thing, get\nme these thing. Whatever I get, I get away, I think I helped, because I didn\u2019t need\nanything for myself, I gived everything away.",
        "Q: Did you have a lot of -- did you get special privileges because of --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t use them. I never ac-accepted a regular -- what I called talon before, a little slip to\ngo and get milk, and I had contact with it. You see, if I wanted, if I would -- let\u2019s say the\nhead of the meat department -- and there was mostly horsemeat, there was nothing else --\nso if I wanted to get meat, I could give him a loaf of bread, he would give me meat. I\ndidn\u2019t do it. I felt that this is dishonest, and I am not in the position to be able to use\ndishonesty just to -- to -- I didn\u2019t use it, except when I came to a point when my wife was\nvery ill, and I did get a different type of food. So I talked to -- I was [indecipherable] say\nI need a special talon for my wife, certain food and so on, and I get it. But this is the only\ntime I was using it for my own. Never did.",
        "Q: You know, well, let me ask you, were your contacts mostly with the administration\nwithin the ghetto, or did you also have contact with the German authorities?",
        "A: With the German no, nothing whatsoever. Only the Jewish army station in the ghetto, and\n-- and the main thing was, everything what came about from Kofsky. The manager of the\n-- ferfling of the food department where I was working was Roomkofsky\u2019s ex-partner\nfrom years ago, friend of his. And he put him in charge of the department. Then every\ndepartment had a commissar also. A high police ranking officer who was assigned to, and\nhe what -- had to handle. In my case there was a fellow by the name of Reingold,\nSigmund Reingold. So this is the way it -- 1t operates.",
        "Q: But this Reingold was part of the Jewish administration?",
        "A: Part of the Jewish administration.",
        "Q: Maybe you can explain s -- how complex the Jewish administration was in the ghetto, it\nwas pretty large, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "A: The Jewish administration was fully well organized. We had the departments, we have a\nkitchen department, who was responsible for cooking soups and so on. And we have all\nkinds departments for -- for a different specialty for different work and so on. And the\nmost what I was connected with was -- was the -- the department wa -- where the food\ncame through. And they were very well organized. There was a -- let\u2019s say there was a\nwhat you call meldinkovi -- registration of people, of vadiserobun, which was headed by\na good friend of my, Naftali, a lawyer [indecipherable]. And let\u2019s say when somebody\nneeded a job for somebody, he went there and asked for an assignment for a job. And one\ntime Mr. Shinsheevy, my manager comes up to me, and say, \u201cLook, Dave, I know you\nknow everybody, I need a job for two girls. Can you get it for me?\u201d I said, \u201cSure, I will\ntry to do it.\u201d And by this -- okay -- Estelle was one of the girls who he gave her the job.\nAnd this is the first time I met her there. When she sa -- heard, or saw that sh -- he asked\nme for jobs for the two girls, she came up -- and she graduated the same year from --\nfrom -- from high school, and I saw her diploma, everything excellent, she was a good\nstudent. And the other girl was another girl there whom I didn\u2019t know it. And so I went to\nthe department and came with the assignment -- with those two jobs. And they -- and\nthey were both employed. Estolle originally was with the department where it was near\nthe [indecipherable] everything was going ups and so on. And -- and Estelle I assigned to\nthe department where the soup talons were given out, in [indecipherable] department.\nEveryone who works here the Jew, [indecipherable] me the Jew. The soup --",
        "Q: Are you saying Estelle your wife now?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You knew her then?",
        "A: Yeah, we married -- at this time she was not, but we married in 1946 in Germany.",
        "Q: Oh. Let\u2019s change the tape\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Sorry about that.",
        "A: Okay. So, he ask question, I will answer.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, back to what you could do in this position. The food all came in from the\nGermans, they controlled how much you got?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. We have a special department who was the distribution department, and the\nhead of it was a fellow by the name Shisheesky, was a engineer, he didn\u2019t survive. And\nthen they will figure out how much food to give to each point for the people leave, and so\non, and -- and people came with their food carts, what they have, to go to pick it up, what\nis assigned to them, and so on, and pay for it.",
        "Q: Now, was there a different amount of food that could go to classifications of people, like\npeople who were working, or women, or people [indecipherable] officials --",
        "A: Every -- everything was for working people, there was no provision for not working.",
        "Q: So where did they eat?",
        "A: So, we divided f-for the number of -- population. You couldn\u2019t do it otherwise. So\neverybody gets something.",
        "Q: So that was up to you?",
        "A: This was up to the department was with doing it, n-not me personally. I was busy with\nthe office downstairs, operations, so on. But we -- we knew how much people there are in\nthe ghetto, how much people, so we figure out. Mr. Sheesheestio was on top of his -- he -\n- and he, with the -- the -- be the management came to the conclusion this why -- this is\nhow much we can give to everyone and so on. And people were going to the distribution\npoint, and picked it up.",
        "Q: So the food the Germans gave you was only for the working people?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: And then you had to figure out how much you could allot to other people who were not --",
        "A: This for the department to figure it out. We have so much food, and so many people, so\nwe can give only the -- that much.",
        "Q: Now, were you able to kind of manipulate the statistics to show that there were more\npeople who needed food, or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Like, if people died you wouldn\u2019t report them, or --",
        "A: No, this wa -- th-this was not in my hands at all. This was not my part.",
        "Q: Was that being done?",
        "A: We saw the li -- we saw this -- how many people there were, were report from every day.\nThis is how many people to get ahead. And people were dying, and people were getting\nwon too. Get ready and so on. We -- we tried to run the ghetto with normal life, with\nmusical concerts, with performances, with all kind of things. To make as much as\npossibly we will -- young people get married, and those thing happened. So this is with --\ntried to ode a active life what it is.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you provide soup kitchens and things like that?",
        "A: We had soup kitchens, was -- especially kitchen department, who was responsible for the\nsoups, and sent the soup for every department. And the head of the -- the office manager\nof the office, head of this was a fellow by the name of Boller, who at one time at a\nmeeting, Roomkofsky ask him, \u201cHow much cost us this soup?\u201d He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\nbecause I\u2019m getting free everything from Dave.\u201d",
        "Q: The soup kitchens were -- now, or -- originally were they privately run, and then the\ngovernment took them over?",
        "A: No. All g -- run always by the ghetto. There was no private an-anything.",
        "Q: So the -- so the ghetto government controlled every aspect of life?",
        "A: Every aspect of life, the ghetto was under control.",
        "Q: And there were no independent --",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Even the theaters, and the schools, and everything?",
        "A: So the schools were under supervision of the ghetto, and everything. There were -- school\ndepartment what took care, and they had to report to Roomkofsky, I\u2019m sure, and so on.\nBut -- but everything was run from the top.",
        "Q: Was it efficient?",
        "A: Yeah. Fully efficient under the circumstances.",
        "Q: What were the living conditions like in the ghetto?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: What were the living conditions like?",
        "A: The living conditions were not good. We were camped in small apartments, mostly. Let\u2019s\nsee, we had to occupy the -- the place where prior was the Polish underground, the Polish\n-- not underground, but the Polish volespart. They moved their mouth to a -- to a different\narea so the Jews can take over their quarters. For example, the office where I worked was\non Droska six. My room -- room with a small kitchen was Droska 15, across the street. I\nwant to be close if something happen, I can always communicate and so on. So it -- it was\nvery cramped, was me, my wife, and my sister. And there is a lady here whom I knew,\nwho works with my sister in that department where the jobs are assigned to and so on.",
        "Q: I thought your sister went to the United States, no?",
        "A: My older sister, I had two.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My older sister came in 1922.",
        "Q: Okay. So this was your -- another sister.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And did you have -- did you have plumbing, did you have sanitation?",
        "A: There was water inside, but you had to go to sanitation outside. Was a faucet for water\nwas.",
        "Q: Did you feel -- I mean, you worked in the food department, so you had enough to eat?",
        "A: Not necessarily, I didn\u2019t take anything more than I had. This was my thing. I didn\u2019t use\nmy job for personal benefit, until I needed help for my wife. Until then, no. I ti -- I could\nhave it easily, I could go to any department and get meat, for bread, and this for thi -- I\ndidn\u2019t feel this is the right thing to do. You see, as a matter of fact, the war there\u2019s --\nbefore there war there\u2019s so many political organizations, Jewish, Zionist, Bund, and you\nname it. And -- and I was active in the Zionist movement before the war, so after the war\nthey came in, oh, this organize, I said, \u201cNo, Iam a Jew here. 1am nota Zionist, I would\nnot, and I am a Jew here.\u201d And they see the way it is. I didn\u2019t -- went away from it.",
        "Q: Were these organizations active in the ghetto?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Were these organizations still active in the ghetto?",
        "A: Oh, the many -- the -- all organizations were active there.",
        "Q: The Zionists, and the Bund?",
        "A: Yeah, they all had groups. I never attended, I never was interested. What I di -- feel this is\nthe proper thing to do.",
        "Q: Do you -- were you aware of efforts to sabotage work in the factories, or for people to try\nto get out of the ghetto, any kind of resistance?",
        "A: Not to ob -- not to [indecipherable] no. I\u2019m no -- people usually works in the different\nresorts somewhere. I di -- nobody was there was happy. Everybody had thousand\ncomplaints, probably, but the circumstances were different. The si -- the interest of\nRoomkofsky was t-to -- all those resorts work, and operate. So there was not much. It\ncould be done if you -- if the -- some people did dishonest things, I\u2019m sure they did. For\nexample, some people did things where they were not informed -- where they had no\nright to do anyway. I found out after the war mainly a few cases like it. So it is -- but in\ndoing the ghetto, and in the -- during the life on it, was a different story. I considered\nmyself a member of the ghetto, and I have to live like everybody does. I didn\u2019t vote any\nspecial privilege for myself.",
        "Q: When you said that you tried to make life as normal as possible, were you shut up from\nthe outside world? Did you have any communications? Phone, mail, radio?",
        "A: No. At one time -- at one time interesting, I -- I had a communication. The company who\nrepresented votie -- represented from Estonia, and so on, their offices were in Berlin. A\ncompany [indecipherable] exterior export and import [indecipherable] shaft. And they\nhad problems. At one point they had a problem with a bank. And somehow, I don\u2019t know\nhow, a letter was delivered to me from this company, in the ghetto. And they\u2019re asking\none simple thing, if I could help them with this particular bank, to straighten it out. So I\nwrote them back, and I told -- and the letter was delivered. I wrote them back, and I told\nthem with the circumstances we are, that I have no way of getting contact with anybody,\nand there nothing what I can do, because I am in such and such conditions here. In the\n[indecipherable] I get a letter the -- they didn\u2019t know it, and they are very sorry for it. So,\nthis whole was my contact with them.",
        "Q: Did anybody have radios?",
        "A: There was a fellow what -- Haim Vidovsky was -- was his name. He listened every day to\nthe BBC. Nobody had radios officially, no shu -- shu -- should have radio. But he listened\nto the BBC, and they made the reports, little reports, and a number of people get them. I\nwas one of them who get every morning, a little slip of paper, was he picked up from the\nBBC a day before, and so on, so on. There were not too many people who get it, but I\nwas one of them. So this fellow, one day finally came, and how they came across that he\nis the one who is having the news, and the radio and so on, and when he found it out, he\nhanged himself. His name was Haim Vidovsky, and he said he didn\u2019t want to fall in life\nin the Germans hand, but if you break down you might s-say something. So he took his\nown life.",
        "Q: What kind of information did you get on the radio?",
        "A: [indecipherable] from the BBC news as far as the war is concerned, what the Germans\nare doing and so on. They\u2019re -- that they\u2019re not doing so well, and so on. And then when\nthey -- it was when the front came near to the ghetto, the Russian stopped, they didn\u2019t\nwant to move in. The Russian didn\u2019t want to give the Poles the honor of doing something\nfor themself. So they -- they didn\u2019t go in, and they stopped ahead of time, and this cost\nmany lifes, naturally.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea what was happening in the camps?",
        "A: No. We were kept under information of the -- everything voozes -- voo -- who -- who\nwere sending out, townswas people, that going to the cities to work, the German need\npeople to work, and they can\u2019t afford to, and we don\u2019t have the work here, but they have\nthe work in Germany, and so -- but nobody knew -- I wouldn\u2019t say nobody, I didn\u2019t,\nmaybe some people guessed more than they knew. And I came to Auschwitz with the\nsame transport what Roomkofsky came.",
        "Q: Were there -- were there a lot of transports into the Lodz ghetto from differ -- you\nmentioned a few.",
        "A: In 1941, they transport -- they -- they were from the little ghettos, they di -- transport the\nliquidated -- the able bodied people to work, send into the ghetto, there were not too\nmany, they were little, small ghettos. But in 1942, there came in the 5,000 from Vienna,\nfive from -- five from Berlin, and 10,000 Prague. And this was the new -- the newcomers\nthat were came in.",
        "Q: Had they cleared some space for these people?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Had they -- had the authorities cleared some space to allow for the new people?",
        "A: They had to take [indecipherable]. They had to assign quarters for them, and so on.",
        "Q: But did they have to move certain residents of Lodz out to make room?",
        "A: No, no, no. They were not group, these persons, wherever there was a place available to\nput them in, and -- and so on.",
        "Q: Were you aware of the Gypsy area?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you provide food for them also?",
        "A: The Gypsies were on the Jewish cemetery, they had Gypsies, and they was hanging them\nthere. That\u2019s all we knew from the -- some people who worked in the Jewish cemetery,\nwho came by and saw that the funeral, something like it, somebody get the word, and\nthey were spreading, gave it to somebody else. They are not official knowledge, but you\nknew what they are doing to the Gypsies there.",
        "Q: The Germans?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah.",
        "Q: So when you mention the cemetery, if somebody died in the ghetto, they actually had a\nproper burial?",
        "A: They take him right away to the cemetery, and bury them, sure.",
        "Q: Did you -- did the Jewish government provide food for the Gypsies?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Were the Germans in the ghetto, or were only the people -- the Jewish police in the\nghetto?",
        "A: The Germans?",
        "Q: Did they come inside the ghetto?",
        "A: They w --",
        "Q: The SS?",
        "A: What kind they were? They were mostly people belong to the -- to the SS, and criminal\npolitsi what the German call and so on. But there was no military units as such. Maybe\nthere was some stationed not far, I am sure. But in the ghetto, no.",
        "Q: So the -- the uv -- the SS, and the criminal police, they stayed outside of the ghetto, and\nthey let the Jewish police handle?",
        "A: They were outside, yeah. In the ghetto, they have certain a number of military, I don\u2019t\nknow which corps and which ranks, who were just to help keep order in it. And they send\n[indecipherable] to the fences, or on the fences. If somebody went close to the fence at\nevening, they could be shot without asking questions, no problem. But there were cases,\nfor example, my own experience. I had a young lady working in our department, her\nmother was ill, never get out of bed. But in order for her to get the soup, she had to be\nregistered as a working. Now they lived not far from the fence, at a part of the ghetto.\nAnd there was a time when -- when -- when [indecipherable] knew arbudscard, what they\ncalled, for people who working [indecipherable] card. So, then -- and I want to help her,\nshe was begging to help my mother. So what I did, I went up as close as I could to the\nfence, and showed her to the German soldier there, that I\u2019m here on a mission from the\nghetto, go to this and this building there, just to check on something, and I am coming out\nright away back. So he said, \u201cOkay, go ahead.\u201d So I went, and I went in there, and I gave\nher a pass, a working pass, [indecipherable] I never saw her. And -- and this was the end,\nthen I went out, and I say thank you to him, and I went back. F -- th -- only -- I was only\na couple times when I went so close to the fence, but I -- I want to help her something,\nand I -- it\u2019s the only way I could do it.",
        "Q: So you had a certain amount of these passes you could distribute?",
        "A: No, only for these particular names. For these particular names [indecipherable] with\nanybody else.",
        "Q: But you had one for this lady?",
        "A: I th -- listen, if she was in -- in my department, I want to help her mother, so --",
        "Q: But you were -- but -- but I\u2019m asking is, you were able to get a pass for her -- a work\npass?",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s what I delivered to her, a pass for that she\u2019s working.",
        "Q: For you?",
        "A: For -- yeah, what I deliver to her, a official passport from the -- from the department who\ngave her the passport, that she is a working member.",
        "Q: Right. I was just asking if you were able to get these passes for people, and say they were\nworking for you.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Did you ever go outside the ghetto?",
        "A: Never, never.",
        "Q: So in -- in four years you never went outside the ghetto?",
        "A: No. They ghetto was, in other words, inside a bridge over the main road to the other side\nof the ghetto. You have to go up and go down on the other side. The main line what was\nZleerska Street, what goes through, went all the way down. And the Germans were using\nthe roads, but we couldn\u2019t pass it. So in order to go on the other side, you had to go up on\nthese stairs and go down the other way.",
        "Q: So the ghetto was cut up, divided?",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was divided, it was divided. The ghetto was both sides. For the old, and for\nthe good.",
        "Q: And you couldn\u2019t cross at the street because that was --",
        "A: No way, no, no. There was no way, it was a barbed wire. There was no crossing.",
        "Q: Did some of the work groups go outside of the ghetto, or did everybody work inside the\nghetto?",
        "A: If --",
        "Q: The workgroups.",
        "A: The work groups?",
        "Q: The work commandoes.",
        "A: The work groups, they went outside the ghetto to work. They took them in the morning --\nnot all of them, I\u2019m sure, but this ones what I know, they picked them up 1n the morning,\ntake them outside the ghetto there to work, and evening brought them back.",
        "Q: And there were also a lot of factories inside? Inside the ghetto, a lot of workers?",
        "A: Back inside the ghetto, yeah.",
        "Q: Now, were there regular actions, or deportations inside the ghetto that ha -- did that\nhappen a lot?",
        "A: Oh yeah, that happened quite a bit. The German required from Roomkofsky, they want so\n-- SO many people out. And so -- so he took people out to varian -- and get people\ntogether from [indecipherable] from everything they were, and they made groups\nwherever they get them, made groups to send them out. But they send them out and we\nnever knew where they send them, if they send them, and so on. So we never heard from\nthose people. Was at -- at -- at one time in \u201942, they decided to take children away. And\nthen they came up with the idea to take the children to a orphan house in Germany. And\nthere is the mothers, [indecipherable] the children, very nice, and give it to -- give them\nanything, toys, what they can have, and so on. So when they come to Germany, they can\nplay in the other kindergarten with all kind of thing, he says oh. Those children were\ntaken away, we never heard, and never saw them, yeah. After a long time, some children\nclothing and so on, came in to be washed in the ghetto. I never saw it, but this what I was\ntold.",
        "Q: When these deportations happened, did you get any advanced warning?",
        "A: N-not advanced warning, but they decided they will come and they will [indecipherable]\nstreet maybe they had against -- I didn\u2019t know it, but maybe they gi -- of course\n[indecipherable] I am not sure, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Were there certain groups of people who got deported first, or -- how did they choose\nwho would get deported?",
        "A: Who would get deported? They choose for -- where they took the people\n[indecipherable]. Mostly they try to get rid of the -- of people from the underworld and so\non. But they just shoot -- they had to have a number of people. And some people were\n[indecipherable] some people were there, I don\u2019t know where, but they had no -- there are\nno special selections, or choose who. If somebody did -- did something wrong, he was\nincluded in [indecipherable] shipment.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t take the women first, or the old people?",
        "A: This was a -- we arrived at Auschwitz. From the ghetto, no. They took everybody who\nwas -- not able to do something, whatever they could.",
        "Q: So they took people who were not able to work, 1s that what you say?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Now, my understanding is that after this big aktion with the children, and when they s --\nsometime after, I guess 1942, most of the people in the ghetto were working people, is\nthat right?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did -- wa -- did -- did the administrations change, did the mood change around you?",
        "A: When you say administration, you mean Jewish administration? No, it was going on the\nsame way. The Jewish --",
        "Q: They still [indecipherable] everything?",
        "A: The Jewish organization tried to keep all -- all the factories working. All the factories\nwere doing something to -- for Germany, what they needed. And this was the interest.\nAnd one time the German came up with an idea, they -- to -- to build -- frame build\nhouses. So they start with a special department to build houses what can be built and\ntransferred to Germany. But this was a big thing. And when an inspection came, and I\nhappened to be there when an inspection came -- everybody had to be there, so they\nshow, so all the people, from the officers, and the [indecipherable] saw group of people\nworking on it. So when one of the Germans tried to pick up such a piece of thing, so it\u2019s -\n- itis heavy, how can we do it? So there\u2019s a what we are -- the [indecipherable] must\nhelp. And this is the way [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did they -- when they wanted to make deportations, would somebody come to your\noffice and say, can you spare so many workers, or --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That didn\u2019t --",
        "A: They -- they simple -- they gave orders to their departments, give me so and so many\npeople. And then this was a matter of the insight, relation, or fanshee, whatever it is, I\ndon\u2019t know. I was confronted with this quite a few times, and I\u2019m -- I most cases get\naway, not having to -- to comply, but in one case, [indecipherable] needed a name. The\nreason? I knew her sister\u2019s boyfriend was a bigshot in the -- in the Jewish police there,\nand he will get her out. And he did. But somebody else went. So if you helped anybody,\nyou put somebody in. So it was such a -- I mentioned wa -- a ex-coworker Mr. Vinerige\nlong time ago, he was coming in the morning into my office, sitting in the corner. Was\nhis, nobody else. And finally -- finally he was on one time when they came, and they took\nhim away with everybody. Yeah.",
        "Q: So these deportations, they were pretty regular from 1942 on?",
        "A: Yeah, they were going on mostly regularly. They want to reduce the number of Jews in\nthe ghetto, and the liquidation were going on.",
        "Q: You knew people who were taken away?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Did you know many people were -- who were taken away\u201d?",
        "A: With what?",
        "Q: Did you -- you knew many people who were taken away\u2019?",
        "A: From -- from the ghetto?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh sure. Every time they took away somebody, is -- everyone is a world for themself.\nAnd -- but it was -- it was part of the ghetto life. And people who were -- somebody was\ntaken away from the family, whatever it is, after awhile they -- lot of people, when\nsomebody died, they kept the body at home, they didn\u2019t report it to died, in order to get\nthe food ration card. [indecipherable] cases like it. Although it came to a point where\ndeath didn\u2019t mean a tragedy. It -- somebody\u2019s tragedy was somebody else\u2019s benefit. The\nmorale, sentimentality went through quite a big change.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: I think before we stopped you were talking about sort of a strange -- sort of a new\nmorality, because people had unusual choices, so that people dying might be a blessing to\nsomebody else. Any -- any other thoughts you have on that? Any other examples?",
        "A: People just kept the bodies at home, they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t get them buried, in order to\n-- they would -- to get the food ration, whatever it 1s.",
        "Q: From your office, your food distribution was to centers, not to individuals, is that right?",
        "A: Yes. From my office, you see, we had distribution of food, was -- was special\ndepartment, Sheesheesky, what I mentioned to you before. And he figured out we have so\nmuch food, we have so many heads, this we can do. And this is the way it was assigned.\nAlthough this was not exactly what the German thought we should give everybody\nwhatever it is. Did we have more, we have more potatoes, so we give more. If we -- was\na time, whatever get, we get a lot of shipment of potatoes, this was helping, naturally.\nThis way people could get a little bit more. But the [indecipherable] plants, the -- the --\nthe season, how much to give was based on the available food, and the number of heads\nin the ghetto.",
        "Q: But toward the end, towards 1944 --",
        "A: \"44,",
        "Q: -- the ghetto was much smaller, wasn\u2019t it?",
        "A: In \u201944, the ghetto was smaller. The ghetto opened up, I don\u2019t remember exactly, with\n160,000 over there with the -- I th -- remember how much it came to the ghetto. Then, lot\nof people went to Warsaw, and -- because there they were relatives, whatever it is, and\nthey hoped Warsaw will not have such a tough time like Lodz, so -- so they went. So it\nwas -- fluctuated, and we never knew exactly how many people we have. The food\ndepartment, the Sheesheesky department knew how much talons he\u2019s giving out. But\nthat\u2019s about all.",
        "Q: Okay, so what -- so what happened to you next?",
        "A: Well, next what?",
        "Q: Well, is there anything else you want to tell me about the ghetto, or do you want to tell\nme how you happened to leave it?",
        "A: And what -- and with the ghetto, do you have any specific questions I mi -- I think I know\nquite about the ghetto. There were the department of working, and lot of people who after\nthe war immigrated, gave different recollection, different thing. And this mostly cut in in\nmy period from after the war in Germany. When we were liberated from the camps, my\nidea was I knew at this time the [indecipherable] 19 people, whatever it is. Anyway, and I\nthought I will try to do what I can to help. This is what was -- what it is. Not having an\nidea how many there are. There were a lot of -- more people than we expected. And\ndifferent people came to work with us, and so on, so on. And some people -- but in a case\nlike this, in a time like this, not in a case, the people who have more experience with\ndoing illegalities, are better active doing something. For example, we have -- we -- I\norganized the office to help people from concentration camp in Germany after the war.\nWhat you call vicasette Auschwitz. Officially I am with hauptaushus [indecipherable]\nwith a haftlinger. And this -- came in a fellow, and then there wa -- in the concentration\ncamp, there were green winkles, and red winkles. The green were criminals, red was\npolitical. No -- nothing -- he had a man working with us by the name of Geerob Ganda he\npassed away. And he was a green winkle, criminal. But he belonged to a youth\norganization who worked anti-Hitler, and they made -- they rob banks, and some of\nwhatever they could. And one time he [indecipherable], he was in the [indecipherable |\nand he was stamped with the criminal winkle. But his explanation, I have it from him, his\nexplanation was he did it for the group, what tried to help the -- [indecipherable] other\npeople. He did -- after the war he had to run away, had to -- went to Israel, he went back,\ncame back. He died in Hanover. And so this fella knew how to handle those cases. Was a\n-- even -- Ge-Germans basically would like to benefit, and when they have connection\nwith a -- with a office, with a conshertoes, and they were able to get a little bit different\nfood on certain occasions, they went all for it. So -- but all those people who were in the\ncamps as -- as political, they were actually from political activities. A lot of people who\nwere from the criminal thing were political in whatever their actions. So, is the -- the\n[indecipherable] they forget to take the bot for. And for this Geerab Ganda, he knew so\nmuch from the [indecipherable] that I was inclined to believe him. He was able to\nmanage the German\u2019s authorities to give us more food, more this, more this. He was able\nto do it.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s go back.",
        "A: Yes, ma\u2019am.",
        "Q: We\u2019 ve jumped a little bit to after the war. You stayed in the ghetto how long?",
        "A: We -- I went to the ghetto in the beginning, after my father\u2019s death in 17\" of January.",
        "Q: 1940?",
        "A: Then I was t -- 1940 -- then they came in and gave me 10 minutes to leave the house, and\nonly take what I can. And I left the ghetto on the 28\" of August, 1944.",
        "Q: Can you tell me how that came about, you leaving the ghetto?",
        "A: Oh yeah. They were -- we were [indecipherable] getting out of the ghetto, they were\nsetting transport every day to send out. And there -- there was -- they decided to liquefy\nthe ghetto, and just leave about 50,000 people to do the cleaning wa -- to clean up, or\nsomething like it.",
        "Q: How many?",
        "A: 50,000. This was at this time they estimate 50,000 Jews to leave there to do the cleaning\njob after everybody left. And so they took -- if the numbers are right, but this is the\nnumbers we were given. Not 50,000, but 50 people, pardon me. Skip the thousands. I\u2019m\nsorry. And so it was at this time they were organizing transports every day, and it came to\nthis, my transport left on the 28\".",
        "Q: Did they tell you where you were going?",
        "A: No. They loaded it in the -- close the transport cars, no windows or nothing, put us in as\nmany as they could, pushed in, lock the door, and that\u2019s it. And we didn\u2019t know anything.\nI didn\u2019t know where we are going. Nobody knew. Had a lot of people -- not lot of, but a\nfew people suffocated there. And they died there, in it. No, we came after, and I don\u2019t --\nat this time I lost the count of time, if it was a day or two, when they finally -- when it\ncame to a point and they opened the gate and let us out. So then, this was Auschwitz.",
        "Q: What did it look like?",
        "A: Was [indecipherable] was a reception, a big field. And we had to go down from -- from\nthe cars, leave everything in the cars what we are left -- what we have left, just go down\nand form two lines, mens one side, women to the other side. And then, on the head of it\nstood the German, the famous -- oh boy, and he make selection, with the finger. Right,\nleft, right, left. The right what he assumed were good to work. To me he hesitates for a\nlittle while, but put me to the right, to the working. And to the -- and the -- they -- they\ndid the same thing to the women\u2019s line, too. And the one who were taken to the left,\nnever heard about them, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Who -- who else went with you?",
        "A: When we came to Auschwitz, was my sister, and my wife.",
        "Q: Who else went with you to Auschwitz, to this --",
        "A: To Auschwitz? My si -- my wife and my sister, Rachel.",
        "Q: And what happened when you all lined up, what happened to them?",
        "A: They lined up -- I was in one line, and the women was in the -- in the other line. And this\nhere the last time when we -- when we saw each other. We looked at each other, but we\nhad to move, move, move, move. And this the way it was. And never saw before, never\nsaw after. It\u2019s the last time.",
        "Q: Were there other prisoners around when you arrived?",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t see it, but later when we went in, and we were taken through the halls to\nwash, to be shaved, to clean our [indecipherable] then there were some prisoners\nworking, who were there before, working in a establishments there.",
        "Q: What were you thinking this was all --",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: What did you think this was all about?",
        "A: What was?",
        "Q: What did you think of all of this?",
        "A: What I think this? Yeah, no thinking at all at this time, you don\u2019t think. You following\nthe certain way of life, and thinking -- no, I don\u2019t think anybody want to think, and\nnobody was thinking. We knew this 1s nothing pleasant for us, and what will happen, who\nknows? Roomkofsky was with the same train. They took him off, his father and adopted\nson, and so on, and they put him in a van. I saw them take it into the van. He came to\nAuschwitz with letters of re-recommendation from Veevofe to treat him well. So this way\nhe was taken to a van. This is a van, when they start to move, gas comes in, and they\nsuffocated. I don\u2019t meet -- I didn\u2019t meet anybody who ever saw Roomkofsky afterwards.\nSo, this was the answer to me about Roomkofsky.",
        "Q: When he went in the van, though, you didn\u2019t know it was a gas van at the time, did you?",
        "A: No, but I saw a special type of van, and so my assumption was this is the end of it.",
        "Q: So after you were chosen to go to the right, what happened next?",
        "A: Then we were taken to Auschwitz and given numbers. They -- in 1944 was the last time\nthey tattooed numbers, they didn\u2019t have any time to do it. My number was 52962, a little\nmetal tag, and it was a sh -- painted on on this uniform, 52962, this is my number, under\nthis number I was known, there no name. And -- and then we were sent, the first transport\nwhat we were sent was a thousand people what were sent to continue [indecipherable]\nworker to the rubber factory.",
        "Q: So how long did you stay in Auschwitz?",
        "A: In Auschwitz? I would say the most five days. I don\u2019t think any more.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t work or anything there, any [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh no, in Auschwitz I didn\u2019t work at all. Just trying to get out of there. The smell in\nAuschwitz was not bearable.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Burned flesh, burning everything. Came on from Birkenau, where the -- where the gas\nchambers were.",
        "Q: And you knew what that was?",
        "A: Yeah, and they know about -- there was us people what they take to work. And then\nwhen they called -- when they call who is a -- for example, a carpenter, everybody was a\ncarpenter. When they call whatever it is, everybody is a specialist. For this arrangement,\nsome people made it, some people, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So how did they choose you to go out?",
        "A: Oh, to work?",
        "Q: Wait, let me just ask a question, what --",
        "A: They sent a group of thousand people, and I was in the area count a thing -- a thousand\npeople, it was not a individual choice, it was a count of thousand people, you were there.",
        "Q: Okay, so what happened, what did -- what did --",
        "A: And then we were sent to continue [indecipherable] work, as I said, continue\n[indecipherable] work -- employed people from -- from concentration camps. And the SS\nget paid for, they didn\u2019t do it. So we were sent there, but they need -- there was a camp\nset up not far, three miles, maybe two miles, so we could walk every night home, and\nevery night go back to -- and every day go back to work. There were 12 Polish, they did -",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- they couldn\u2019t tattoo any more, I think the last time they tattoo was \u00b044.",
        "Q: Okay, so you got to [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, then we wer -- then we went there, in the -- in a [indecipherable] they have set up a\ncamp not far, to be the barracks for us, and we had to work in the factory there. Now the\nfactory was -- was producing all kind of rubber goods for the Germans, and the -- and the\nmain thing was to produce [indecipherable] for tiles. So the rubber was coming down\nfrom the third floor, liquid, and came on the current floor, and there were big machines\nturning the thing, and -- and they get harden, and we had to carve them with knives to\nmake pieces of them, so they can go through again, and so on. Now, they were mostly --\nthey were civilian workers too, who worked with it, mostly Poles. The Poles were\ncoming into work every time, in shift. They leave [indecipherable] far, but they were\nbrought in to work, and so on.",
        "Q: Let me ask you where was this factory?",
        "A: In Hanover. It\u2019s a big, big territory.",
        "Q: Was it a sub-camp of a larger camp, or not?",
        "A: What, the camp?",
        "Q: Was it -- this -- the -- the factory was separate, it was a German factory, yes?",
        "A: A German factory.",
        "Q: Was -- were your barracks part of any -- you need to sit back, please.",
        "A: Oh, pardon me.",
        "Q: Were -- were your barracks part of any larger concentration camp, was it a sub-camp?",
        "A: No, no. We were all part of Neuengamme, all the camps around the area belonged to --\nthey had -- the headquarter of Neuengamme, in the area. So -- and we were part of it. So\nwe were there, and we had to work two shifts. Now, working on the shifts, cutting the\nrubber with the -- the Poles who were coming there, the Poles, they were volunteers to\nwork, and so on, they get gloves, and things to protect themself, we didn\u2019t get it. So we\nhave to somewhat burn the finger, burn the finger. So when he will cutting it, try to do\nthe best of the thing like this. And this time, somehow, I attracted the attention of a g-\nGerman master, who was going around see how everybody is doing, and he spoke\nGerman, and I know German, so we get in -- in a little conversation, and -- and he\nbecame interested, and visit me as often as he could. At one time, th -- and then he comes\nin one time and tells me he -- he is being transferred, and if I need anything what -- what\nhe can help me, I should contact him. I said, \u201cOkay, who are you, where should I contact\nyou?\u201d So there was a running sign around in the office there, Herr towans commarada\nedisnow pay. The -- the man who the -- the trusted men from the National Socialistic\nParty is he [indecipherable] me. But later on he confide to me he was never a Nazi, he\nnever belonged to coo -- but this was his job with the factory, he worked there for many\nyears. So then one time, during, I think, yeah, then in seven -- we worked on machines --\nthey were special machines to make amon, and this happened with -- and I finished my\nshift, and we were taken back to the barracks. After a little while, a SS man came to the\nroom and called my number. So, come. So I go. Followed him back to the factory. And\nturned out to be they had a few machines working upstairs, and the machines jumped\nsomehow, they couldn\u2019t make them go. There was a -- a German master, and his\nassistant, and they couldn\u2019t make the machines go. I was working on this type of\nmachines five at a time, and I knew the machines. Because the Poles came, and they were\ngoing hiding, and I worked for them. So they gave me a piece of bread once in awhile. So\n-- then -- so I come there, and then -- and they\u2019re stuck in the work, and they couldn\u2019t\nmake them, and the master comes up, and his eyes, you could see right away, he\u2019s not a\nfriend of mine. And he told me, \u201cYou know how to work these machines?\u201d I say, \u201cYes, I\nknow.\u201d \u201cDo you know how to work one machine?\u201d I say yes. \u201cGo work.\u201d I went, put up a\nmachine. After I let the machine go, I didn\u2019t ask any question, put up another machine. I\nwas working, and they were looking, and they work with their machines, and trying to fix\nit. I had it that this night I am working on three machines the same time, some\n[indecipherable] and they couldn\u2019t make their own machine go. So this -- this aggravated\nthem very, very much. Okay by then the morning, we had to go back and come back, I\nhad to wait -- no, I didn\u2019t go back. They told me you stay here, lie down for a couple\nhours, then you\u2019re back to your shifts. Okay. This was [indecipherable]. So then I didn\u2019t\nsee him, this friend of my, I seen him for a long, long time. One time I ge -- daytime, an\nSS man came in to the iddel, and called my number. And I was working. Come. I had to\nfollow him. So I followed him to a big, big office, a long table where there sitting maybe\n12 or 16 people around the -- around the table there. They were probably given a positive\ninformation about me, that I can help, and they were trying to set me up for a good job\nfor -- for after the war. So, first of all they give me a chair to sit down, and had a little\nconversation in German, just to check my German. So we\u2019re talking. Then finally they\ncame to the point, that is my knowledge of German, and with my experience in this work,\nI can build up myself a great career for after the war, and work with them, and do it --\nhelp them [indecipherable] and so on. So I was very pleased, I was -- thank you for the\nacknowledgement, and -- and polite conversation, and I was dismissed not knowing\nexactly what there is [indecipherable]. There is [indecipherable] they wanted to train me\nas a knowledgeable man who helped to run the machines, and all kind of things. I was\ntransferred to the upper place where all the rubber were mixed. I was very little\n[indecipherable] but many other things. And there with was everything what you put in in\nthe cooking machine was -- made me -- I wa -- black up and down, I couldn\u2019t wash it out\nfor weeks. See, the question there [indecipherable], but at the time this -- and when this\nwas going on for -- for quite awhile until November 30. November 30, 1944. November\n30 they came up and told us the department is not happy with all of you, so we are going\nto transfer you to -- to a different. And the office was a walking distance, probably an\nhour. We walked to a place called Ahlen. Ahlen was a -- a ex-asphalt mine. There was\nnot acting -- nothing there. They wanted to create a factory in this asphalt mine, so it has\nto be dynamited, put hole to dynamite, explode it, take out all the junk, all that, and so on,\nso on. And make it clear, which [indecipherable] this. And finally they came to the point\nwhen is clear enough, and they wanted to set up -- so we worked with dynamite, with all\nkind of things for the Germans. And [indecipherable] and every time to -- to take out,\npush up, blows up, and so at one time there was -- I am pushing up and I\u2019m -- and \u2019m\ntrying to go back, with pushing oh -- not by myself, with a few other people, and the\nGerman watch man was -- wa-was saying, give it back to me. [indecipherable], so I say,\n\u201cGere shtatin zeebeeta.\u201d Gere shtatin is a nice German expression for please, excuse me.\nHe tells, \u201cOh, bitte, bitte.\u2019 From this time we became buddies. Every time I pass by he\nwant to have a conversation with me. And we were talking a lot, and he was put in -- he\nwas out of the army, service a long time, but they needed a young people for the front, so\nthey took all the -- all the la -- people, put them in the SS to guard the camps. This is the\nway it was. And this was going on until we cleared the outside mine, made floors, made a\nfactory, and then -- and put in machinery, so they started to work, for this daily, daily\nhard work.",
        "Q: This camp Ahlen, this was also a sub-camp of Neuengamme? Also part --",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. Every -- all the camps were, they were part of Neuengamme.\nNeuengamme was the head camp for the whole territory, for the -- all the a -- other. The\nNeuengamme h-head office was in Hamburg, I think.",
        "Q: How were your living conditions?",
        "A: The living condition were excellent. We had the coffee pot in the morning to -- in -- in\nthe rag -- the -- they brought in a big jar with coffee, and made sure that everybody\nreceives coffee. Then they turned around the whole cage on the floor, and we had to\nscrub the floor with the coffee. Sometime we get the coffee [indecipherable], sometime\nnot. But this the way life was. And then this -- and then we went to work, on these floors.",
        "Q: Where -- did -- how many people were in your barracks?",

        "Q: Was this camp only men? Only men worked here?",
        "A: Only men, only men.",
        "Q: About how -- how many men?\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Talking about the Germans, I knew Germany from before the war. Etiquette is nice,\nexcellent people, and so on. This type, let\u2019s say for example, the -- the cassette Auschwitz\nwhat we organize was th -- to help people from concentration camp. One day comes in a\nGerman farmer, and gives me a bill, and want me to pay it, for potatoes he delivered to\nthe SS. So I tell, oh, and what happened to the potatoes? You people ate it, so why\nshouldn\u2019t you pay for? This was their mentality. Basically, they were jealous people. If\nsomebody had something, they want and so on. I had one time -- I --",

        "A: Yeah, after the war.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: I had -- one time, I had no car, and there were no car to get somewhere. One time comes\nto me a German, and say, \u201cI know where a car is,\u201d and tells me of a farmer that he has in\nhis thing hidden, covered up a car. The following there I went over there, a few people,\nand we took home the car. But this is characteristic for them, they were jealous of\nanother, and if somebody had something, they liked to have it, too. So it was a --a\ndifferent type of experience with Germans between these two groups of German. I cannot\ntell in -- tell the different groups that different people out of different groups, whatever it\nis, but this is the way it is.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s go back a minute to Ahlen.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And also I know you had -- you seemed to have conversations and contact with Germans\nthere, also at continental [indecipherable]. How much information were you getting about\nwhat was happening in the war?",
        "A: What was happening in the war? Nothing. This is a point I never touched. I was only\ninterested if he could help me to find out what will happen next to us. So he told\n[indecipherable], tomorrow I will let you know. And next time when he came to lead us\nto the toc, he told me the -- the -- the camp is to be set for evacuation on the sixth of\nApril. But from the outset what happen, I never went in with any German, no matter how\nfriendly, in politics. Was a dangerous area, and I stood away from it. I j -- so this is -- the\nonly thing was that I find out for him when the camp will be evacuated. And the camp\nwas evacuated officially on Friday, April the sixth, 1945. And then when -- then you see,\nthe -- the camp was in the middle of a field. People were going by Sundays for walks, and\nSO was going on and so. There were nobody who didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But when\nthe camp was evacuated on April the sixth, the evacuated, I mean that the marching\npeople went, and we were left who -- who couldn\u2019t walk, or couldn\u2019t march. Then,\npeople from all sides came in, disconnected electrical wiring from -- from -- from the\nfences, and trying to be nice and help us, they brought in coffee. We says, okay. But then\nour young people, very unpatient, run out, start to go around, look. And I begged them\ndon\u2019t go, the German are still around somewhere. What happened we don\u2019t know. No, we\nknow we are here tomor -- and on the following day, Saturday, came an SS man with a\ntruck, and loaded us on the truck, we were 19 people from this camp. And these 19\npeople, [indecipherable] drove us to a place called the Shizenplatz. The Shizenplatz was a\nplace where the German SS were leaving their officers, and everything and so on. So, he\ndrove us there, and there before the gate is a general, a professional, looks almost gray,\nstanding. And here Plotsam and I was on the truck. Here Plotsam, he get that here was\nsome 19 people for execution. And the general told him, \u201cLook, we are killing people in\na war, but we are not killing people who -- who -- who we\u2019re not fighting. Your friends\nleft already.\u201d So he told us to go off the truck, and he told the [indecipherable] and he\u2019s\nall off. So\u2019s the last I saw about him -- of him. Not far away was a French POW camp,\nand they motioned to us to come close to them. And this was a big -- a big help to us. So\nwe went over there, and they told us, \u201cLook, you never know if the German come back or\nnot. This uniform is not good. You have to go change uniforms.\u201d I said okay, how,\nwhere? So, \u201cThis is a little building there, break in. There are the uniforms what we are\nwearing.\u201d So I took my people, and we walk in there, and we took uniform, changed the\nuniforms, and put them in and joined them. They would be very -- they were very\nhelpful. They were trying to help us with little bit what they had, but they didn\u2019t have too\nmuch either. So -- it was a -- a certain type of a good experience in bad times.",
        "Q: What happened next?",
        "A: Next this was -- this already was the next ist day on Wednesday, the 11\" of April. A lady\ncomes running in, and say there are Americanos in the areas, be the American\n[indecipherable]. So, naturally I got the courage to go. So we went to center of the town,\nand there I saw the American tanks, first time I saw them, saw on the -- the lemt. And so\nI up -- I approached the officer in charge there where it was, and I told them as far as I\nknew we are 19 people, and we need some assistance, we don\u2019t know what to do. So he --\ntalking a little bit German, a little bit -- he must have been Jewish, too, or -- or he -- or he\nknew a little bit more [indecipherable]. So he told me to be the liaison, that he cannot talk\nto all 19 people, but a be -- and he appointed me -- gave me a piece of paper, so I can\nwalk after the time where 1s walking not permitted. And so then try to keep informed.\nThen we went to a place there were people there sitting down, that we were actually\nhousing. Still, ours had benches and so on, so on. And there we were sitting, and evening\nAmerican soldiers came to visit us. And there -- pardon me -- and there where it was --\nthank you -- and there where it was, my first disappointment, what it is? We are sitting,\nblack soldiers, white soldiers. Comes in a white soldier, shakes hands with every white,\nnot with the black. No, it didn\u2019t slide good with me, but there\u2019s the way it is, I don\u2019t what\nto think. That\u2019s the way it was. And they -- the black people didn\u2019t see anything abnormal\nin it. This was the life what they had. Then, among them was a fellow asked me if I have\nsomebody in New York, I say, \u201cSure, I have a sister in New York.\u201d \u201cDo you remember\nwhere she live?\u201d I gave him -- yeah, gave him the a -- the address. His wife lived a\ncouple blocks from there. He notified his wife, and he went away, I never saw him again.\nBut he notify -- later, I found out when I came to the States, he notified his wife, and she\ncontacted my sister. I never saw even the mo -- the units went off, so [indecipherable].\nAnd this was -- we were sitting there, and trying to house the -- and we had to eat\nsomething, so we found them whole rice, cages of rice. I never cooked rice in my life. I\ndidn\u2019t know when you put in a little bit, 1t grows up, [indecipherable]. So I put in a little\nbit, and I got plenty of it, but this is -- the first time you learn, next time, do better. And\nthis is where life is -- slowly went back until we were able to resettle from there. We\nsettled in -- in -- in -- in Hanover himself, in the town, and so on.",
        "Q: Did they find you housing in Hanover?",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "Q: Did the military find you housing?",
        "A: No, no, no, they were -- we sa -- went into town, and wherever apartments available, we\nget in. And there were many apartments available. And we were not -- we were only 19\npeople, so was not a big deal. And some of them are still live in Germany. There was my\nexperience in camp, the doctors. There was a -- a sickum, what they called, and there was\na doctor, a fellow who I knew from ghetto, who -- he did one year to graduate medical\nschool from -- from Italy, but he was only a shop. In the ghetto, he was working as a\ndoctor. He was very smart, and very knowledgeable. Dr. Faglovitch, his name now is\nFago. And the -- the order -- yeah, was a -- then there was a Dr. Vondaykunt in Belgium,\npicked up on the street, send him away to the camp, his family never knew where he is,\nwhat he is. This I found out after the war when they came looking for him. So -- but he\nwas a doctor, and he became ill one time, himself, to the Jewish Dr. Faglovitch, who was\nnot a [indecipherable] doctor told the German he had typhus. What are you talking, what\ndi-did you know about typhus? So, not -- they went away, it\u2019s not typhus. Then he get\nworse, so I called [indecipherable] they -- they brought a doctor from outside, a German\ndoctor from outside, and he says, yeah, that was typhus. It was too late already, couldn\u2019t\nsave him any more. Later on I find out more about him because the family came to look\nfor him, and somehow they were directed to me, said maybe I knew something more\nabout, but I was in the same group, and so on, and so on.",

        "A: My name is David Klipp, I was born July nine, 1905, in a small Lithuanian town called\nSkudy, S-k-u-d-y. Lithuania small little town, where we lived with my grandmother in\ntheir house, the -- all little houses were -- on Fridays, the baker -- there was a bakery\nopen, on the Friday it was -- things so -- baked for the whole week for the family, and so\non, so on. Anyway, is -- my father, and his brother married two sisters. This mean my\nmother\u2019s -- my mother and my uncle\u2019s wife were two sisters. Then there was another\nbrother, too, but I don\u2019t have any recollection where -- I know he should only be in\nFrance somewhere, but I had no contact. My dad, when he was alive, kept all the contact\nwith hi -- with [indecipherable]. No -- in 1907 -- you see, the -- all young men were rev --\neducated in religious thing. Rabbinical preparation, all kind in these thing, there were no\nother type of thing. No -- and my father has a little bit older ideas, too, and he wanted to\nbuild up a better life for his -- for his family. So, when I was two years old, in 1907, he\nwent to the United States. Was in the United States, the first [indecipherable] was how to\n-- peddling, like all the people do, and so on. But later on, he learned to make sweaters,\nand established himself a little factory -- factory -- they call it factory, all there was a\ncouple machines to make sweaters. No -- he was very prosperous, very good, and in 19-\n0-10, he decided he is ready to bring the family to New York, and start in living. So he\ncame back, but my mother didn\u2019t want to go. Her -- her parents were still alive, they lived\nall together, and what is in the United States? Where is it? What -- this is home, they\nknew only their world. So he had no choice, he had to give up the plant, and -- and he\nmoved in 19-0-10. He moved to Lodz, Poland, where he established himself a little\nfactory making sweater. The same thing what he had there. Same thing what he ha --\nwhat they had there, and was a pretty good doing. Then the first World War broke out\n[indecipherable] Poland, 19 fort -- [indecipherable] 1914 in -- and we came to Lodz 1913.\nMy father went 1910, and the rest of the family came 1913. The first World War got\n1914, and Lodz was occupied by the Russian army at thi -- this is part of the Russian\nsphere of interest, or kind of the s -- Poland for -- the country was divided in three parts.\nIt was the -- what they call the congers Poland, were Lodz, Russia, and all this thing. This\nfor they -- they were -- they called the Poland under -- under Austrian supervision, and\nthey\u2019re very compulsive education. And people had to go to school, and people had to\nlearn. The third part were in the area of Fooznine, which was more anti-Semitic oriented\nterritory, so -- and so this was wa -- 19 -- 1914, then the war broke out. Not -- the war\nbroke out, the people gel prepared, Poland can never last five weeks, six weeks. So, what\npeople did, they bought bread, put on cases of loafs of bread, this will keep us over the\nwar, and so on. [indecipherable]. So the war lasted quite a bit, until 1918. Then, the\nPolish armies became alive, too and so on, and there were the Polish armies from the\nRussian territory, the Polish officers were from the Russian army, and is all kind of thing.\nBut Poland became a -- a independent to a certain degree. No political, I don\u2019t recall too\nmany things there, but it -- it changed the whole life, in -- in -- in the whole area. This\nwent on, then the Russian army came into Lodz, I remember the Cossacks when they\ncame in. And naturally they did whatever they want, and when they were going over --\nthey were in Lodz, and they saw a German plane flying overboard, a Russian soldier\npicked up his rifle and shot in the air, he don\u2019t know what he is doing, what he shot, and\nthis you can imagine. But this is the way, the level of the armies what -- of this time. In\nth-this, the war went on, and in 1920 -- 1920, Pilsudski came to power. And Pilsudski\nwas more Socialistic oriented, and he was more cooperating with everything, and so --\nand he was the one. The territory close to the German border what called the Posnine\nregion was there, was General Halla, the anti-Semitic general whose soldiers were\ncatching Jews from deflor, cutting their beard, and so on, all kind of things. In 19 -- Iam\ngoing over fast, but there is not too many things sink. In 1926, I was called to the army.\nYeah, until then, I was working, before, and I worked in a company where I did clerical\nwork, and salers work, some small companies. In 1926, I was called to the -- to the army\nservice. So I went in octo -- On October the 12\", 1926. I had to induct to the army, and I\nwas assigned to the Fosnine region, where General Halla had his say, and so on. I went\nthere, and then there was a very big limitation what a Jew can do, what a Jew cannot do.\nIn the army, the regular probably hear the same thing. They need -- in the beginning they\nneed young people to do -- at least to help, were write and read, and so on. So they\nneeded people to the company office, to write. Who can read and write? Three people\npicked up their hands. I was one of them. I knew I will not make it, but I was one of\nthem. So they called okay, there was one who was by profession a teacher in Poland. So\nthey took him to the office, naturally. And he lasted about three or four weeks, and they\nget him out. Then there was another one who can read and write, some kind -- halfway\neducated. They took him in there, and he only last a few weeks, too. Finally they came to\nthe point there are nobody else. So they decided they have to -- no choice. So I was taken\nto the o -- to the office, and this is not part of the military duty, of going through the\nmilitary training, with all the [indecipherable] all the exercise, and so on, but in -- in\nspare time, day time, lunch time, evening, you do the -- the office work. No --\nexperienced I was, so they very fast decided that I can do the ho -- the payroll for the\ncompany also. Order was I get involved in many thing -- the -- the company payroll for\nthe officers and all kind of things. And this way I get the contact with -- the battalion\ncommander at this time, if I recall, was a majer -- Major Sheemak, in Polish majer, in\nEnglish major. Sheemak was on this way -- he was a son of a very wealthy Polish\nlandowner and so on, so he had his own horse, and all kind of things. But he was a little\nbit a nervous guy. When he went to the casino, and he drank a little bit, he took out his\ngun and shot at a lamp, shot at everything what [indecipherable]. So then what -- after\nthis was over, the following day, he realized, and somehow he knew the battalion\nworking in the -- in the company office -- battalion officer. So he calls me in, and tells\nme, \u201cWhen I go to the casino, and I start to drink, you come with me and take away my\ngun.\u201d Order is order, I did it. And when I came in, he didn\u2019t say anything, just took out\nthe gun and gave it to me. This was -- this was not nice. And this way was on -- I was in\nthe army until I went to the -- exercise the records there and so on, so on. This part of\nPoland belong to the division per -- General Halla was in charge of the whole thing. And\nwhen it came to the examination after the -- the three months, and the commander of the\ninfantry for the division came for the -- for the high ranking general -- came down, then\nnaturally they -- they have the bas -- the exercises. So when they start to ask question\natfil, whatever he asked me to do, and he right away picked on me. And whatever he\nasked me to do, I did. I considered myself a pretty good soldier, and I knew what I am\ndoing. And finally at the afternoon exams in the class, asking question again, and the\nprofessional -- one the officers didn\u2019t know all the answers always, so he picked on me.\nOne of the question was, who did more for Poland, General Halla, or Pilsudski? And\nbehind him, there was standing officers, and he which showed me to mark on the picture\nwhere -- where Halla is. I said, \u201cNo, in mine opinion Pilsudski did more for Poland than\nHalla.\u201d So this way we have a discussion and every question aired, I answered not to --\nnot to his liking. Anyway, this time were over, and then we had to come to the period of\nbeing sworn in. Being sworn in, they took, naturally, because swearing in for Christian\none way, and then all the Jews from the whole area, they took to a Polish son of Kalish,\nand there they bought -- they ordered a rabbi to come there and swear it in. And then, in\nthe meantime, waiting for the rabbi to come and so on, the officers made jokes. Naturally,\nanti-Semitic jokes were no problem there, so they -- they had fun. Finally there came the\nnews that the rabbi arrived. So they had to send a -- a horse and buggy to bring him in.\nCame in a rabbi from the part of Baleetshia what was until the ouster -- occupation, all t -\n- Jew with a -- with a long beard, and so on, spoke a beautiful Polish. And they opened\ntheir eyes, how can he speak Polish like this? And he did his formal thing, and he di --\nswearing in, and during this time they -- they get a little bit respect for him. They didn\u2019t\nexpect him to be such a Polishist. Anyway this -- this went over, and we went back to\nnormal duty. And I was in the army until March of 1928. 1928 I was released and I went\nhome.",

My father\nhimself was not -- he looked for something else, he had technical thinking and so on.\nThat\u2019s why he went to the United States. So he was -- he went -- he went to the United\nStates, naturally taking all the religious books and so on, and he came [indecipherable]\nthem. Was there he learned English a little bit.

In the -- in the\nbuilding of the school, they -- all they build -- they build it also a little synagogue, too.\nBut they -- the headmaster of the school was not an observant Jew, he was more\nassimilated. And he was only the one thing, Yom Kippur, to say the high holiday, Kol\nNidre, he has to be there. Thus he is only Jewish is what he displayed there.

Well -- well this is to show that my father was religious, observant,\nbut he was not a fanatic.",

From this reached the doctor who\nis -- who was the main doctor to my mother, Dr. Rosenberg, he was in the ghetto also.\nDr. Rosenberg was a neurolo, so I figured all by myself there is something to do with\nneurology.

Iren\nHairind did a publication, monthly publication called Garaishdifite, which is justice. And\nthere she reported everything what she knew -- what she find out from Germany, so on,\nso on. So I was a subscriber to this. I worked on the job, and I did very well, and -- and\nshe -- and I was -- as -- a subscriber to this. I worked for a man by the name of Anatole\nFunkin.

And in order to get the representation for this one, people paid money for\nit, and -- and gave deposits, and ba -- the guarantees, whatever they had.

        "A: In this particular business, I sel -- no, I was start working for them for 16 years old. And\ndifferent places were [indecipherable] town so on, so on. On this particular job we\u2019re\nafter -- we were -- I -- I started in 1928, and I took over the -- yet -- Funkin job in 1932.\nSo -- and then -- and I wot -- I established myself pretty -- really in the community too.

So, in order to convince, she, without my knowledge, she went to\nthe -- to the top doctor where all the big ladies were going, [indecipherable] and so on.\nAnd came back, and -- and brought me a letter from him, he didn\u2019t see any danger in her\ncontinue working. But it wasn\u2019t so. At one night she became very, very ill, and there was\nnowhere to go, nowhere to do. There was a clinic at -- kind of a hospital what was a\nmostly frequented by the poor part of the people, the rich didn\u2019t go there, and -- and\nthere\u2019s a -- not far from my house, and I had to take her to a -- to a hospital\n[indecipherable]. So fi -- I -- I called up, and they told me yeah, I can bring her. So I\nwent, said then call up the doctor. Cause there were no doctor and so on. So he says, Ooh\nyeah, if I -- if I get 20 zloty, I,\u201d -- so in middle of the night, \u201cif I get 20 zloty, I -- I will\ncome.\u201d 20 zloty was like hundred dollar here, at this time was money. I said, \u201cLook you\njust come there, and the money is waiting for you here.\u201d He came in the middle of the\nnight to that thing.

So it was everybody were -- all men went -- tried to get away. Finally, I was talked\ninto -- about eight o\u2019clock in the morning, to go. So with my brother and a third man who\nworked for me, we were walking toward Warsaw. Nobody expected that Warsaw will be\ncapitulated in a -- in a short time.

So we had to s -- we had to start to go -- go\nto a -- Warsaw, what we thought it might be safe and so on. It took us more than a week,\ncause we couldn\u2019t -- daytime you couldn\u2019t walk, so we had to lie down hidden\nsomewhere. And nights you could walk. And finally we came to -- shortly before\nWarsaw, we came on foot so -- and -- and -- and then the population, mostly the Jewish\npopulation ha -- had prepared drinks, and broth, and everything to try to help us to get\n[indecipherable]. But the main thing was, took us over the bridge. And this was the main\npart. So I put myself up further to the bridge and there -- and there is lying a Polish\nofficer, waiting too. And I ask him how it is. He says, \u201cLook, this is a I-long place was --\nis constantly bombed. And here, if you don\u2019t catch the moment between one set of flares\ngets away, and -- and the other comes, you might make it.\u201d We did. I saw\n[indecipherable] let\u2019s fly -- with away, so P\u2019Il know whatever it is, we have to make it. So\nwe on, and we crossed the long bridge, closer to Warsaw. There was a place called\nMajdanek if I remember right, and there the people were standing, helping us with food,\nwhatever it is. Then, finally we -- we came into Warsaw, and the German came into\nWarsaw, I think it was on September the 25\". When I heard the s -- the German are\nalready here and so on, so I -- so I approach the German column, and an officer was\nthere, and I ask him if he can tell me if the way to Lodz is safe for me to walk -- to start\nto do. He looks at me for awhile, and then he say, \u201cI on your place would go to\nPalestine.\u201d So, nothing we could do. We started to make our way, slowly different ways\ngoing back to Lodz and it took us a long time, and we had to -- walking and hiding and\nall kind of things. And we came to Lodz at one evening. We went in to the side of the\ncemetery there, and I paid somebody to go in and call up my wife, tell her that I am here.\nHe took the money, but they never made the call, I found out later. The other fellow -- at\nthe evening when it was dark, we took the freight car, we had no choice. And we went\non, we made it home. Now then, from this one 1s -- life was different that the German\ncame, and the German tried to take away every house where they can and so on. And I\nwas managing the two big apartment houses for my bosses, too, but at this time there was\nno managing at all. I had -- I couldn\u2019t do anything. So just living there, staying there for\nawhile. I had, before the war, working at Funkin, I had contact -- they were in Poland,\nwere at a lot of companies owned by people who came years ago from Germany,\nmanufacture, so on. The young, when hi -- when Hitler came to power, the young\ngeneration, the young Germans went to Germany, and they became the Hatenkroitzer and\nthis all kind of things. I had a conflict w-with -- with one company, who was very good,\nvery -- but the experience was when you see -- they were paying a lot with backslip.\nThose were checks with a longer period of time, so on. 60 days, 90 days, and -- and I had\nsome from the company [indecipherable] checks from other people, other name. And one\ncheck came back from my exper -- and my practice was mail it to them, and they will\nsend me back a check. [indecipherable] I mailed it, but I never heard anything back,\nbecause the young fellow was in head office, he was already away in Germany. And he\nwasn\u2019t -- so -- but he came back, as I was still in the building, leaving there. And I saw\nhim through the window coming in, so I opened the door, and I approached him in\nGermany, and say, \u201cYou are coming to -- to collect a debt.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, Mr. Klipp,\nI am -- Iam coming to pay a debt.\u201d And apologized for this what happened, and so on.\nNow, he was a uniform with the arm band, with all kind German things. And that\u2019s the\nway it was until we were living in the apartments, I was at my father with his family, and\n[indecipherable] and then until January 16.",
        "A: Father was sick, and I couldn\u2019t get the medical help for him. There was -- there was no\ndoctor who could go to a Jew, and there was no way, and he had the illness, and finally\nhe died on January 16, 1940, in his bed. I was at his bed. And the only thing we do is that\n-- use connections to be able to bury him in the cemetery, and this was it.",
        "A: When the German took over there, they first of all, they -- they fight to get all the Jews to\nwork. And then their main thing was to get the Jews out of central town. They establish --\nit was already toward the end of nine -- of -- of \u201939. There was already rumors of a\n[indecipherable] assigned as a ghetto. And -- and they tried to force people to move there\nas fast as you can by their own and so on. But I couldn\u2019t [indecipherable] cause my father\nwas still alive, but when he died, a day after, they came in, and gave me 10 minutes to\nwalk out of the building, and take whatever I can carry, nothing else. So we took\nwhatever we can and -- and we start to walk toward the ghetto. And -- and my -- my\nfriend there empty a room, empty apartment on one street, on Zigilska 36. So I went in\nand listen, there was no question asked. They open the door, you go in, and you are there.\nAnd this was the main street, where they build later the main artery, where they separated\nwith two halfs of the ghetto. So then --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: People couldn\u2019t whatever, the life stopped. Everything was -- there was no more life.\nPeople just tried to get out, and they were encouraging with many ways to people to\nmove away f-from there. So people were constantly moving, going, and so on. For\nexample, my mother\u2019s family carried f -- 40 jar, things with -- out there. I couldn\u2019t do it. I\nwas told only whatever I can have on my shoulder, and go. So it was -- there was no life\nany more after this, until the ghetto, and then we didn\u2019t know what.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Every Pole you saw a Jew here attack them or took them away, can\u2019t do this, do\nthis, do this, and so on. And they were -- and the Germans were just -- they didn\u2019t care\nfor this -- or wa -- they didn\u2019t care to -- to defend, whatever it is. They let them do\nwhatever they want, this was helpful to them.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, the Poles, and the German was helping them. A little Polish boy had a German\nsoldier, and -- and he told him, he is a Jew, and okay, and this [indecipherable]",
        "A: I -- oh yeah, [indecipherable] from the streets. I had in the building where I was living,\nand what was owned by my -- by Mr. Funkin, by my boss. I -- I -- I had a tenant who was\nfrom Germany region, the family, many, many years ago. And these were good friends,\nalways, and we still good friends. So at one time then I n -- I was in a jam, I went to\nevery -- and advice, what should I do? I couldn\u2019t do this, I couldn\u2019t do this. So I decided\nto up to his door, he wa -- lived on the second floor, and go in and try to talk to him. The\nfamily knew me very well. And I come to the door, and his son opened the -- the -- let me\nin, and I see a German uniform hanging in sight. So he right away came out to say, don\u2019t\nworry, this is my nephew. Don\u2019t worry, you come in, and whatever I can do, tell me. So I\ntell him what -- in the meantime we\u2019re going in a conversation with the nephew. And the\nnephew, a young soldier tells me that we lost the war at this time. So I\u2019m telling him,\n\u201cLook, you are a member of a army who walks every day ahead, ahead, ahead. And you\nare tell me they lost the war?\u201d There is a German word, zieg, zieg, this means that we get\nsomething, we ge -- com -- he says, \u201cHerr -- herr Klipp, visignu stott.\u201d This means you\nare getting so much of this good, that we are die from it. And couple years later I was in\nthe ghetto already, I received a -- he sent me in a communication by somebody that his\nnephew died on the front. Non -- at this time they -- okay, this was -- the German -- under\nthe German occupation, there couldn\u2019t be -- naturally there was nothing. My father died,\nso I had to go to the ghetto. The ghetto I --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Of what?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: They were. The Einsatzgruppen were in the ghetto, in the part of the ghetto, and they all -\n- all around. They made a fence around the ghetto, and where we get close to the fence,\ncould be shot.",
        "A: The Einsatzgruppen with -- the Einsatzgruppen with the whole -- the -- I think there was\nsome regular SS or regular army also, but mostly Einsatzgrup were the one who was\nmarching with all thing. So it is -- it was no way -- again already the ghetto was\nestablished, and Roomkofsky was the head of the ghetto.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: He was chosen because he had a big head of white hair, an older, which means he can be\nthe altesta -- the oldest of the Jews. About --",
        "A: Oh yeah, we did, but those were all Orthodox so -- and they were not acceptable, and\nthere were no Jewish community, they were all gone. The -- the Jewish community\nbefore the war didn\u2019t exist any more. It was a new -- new life in the ghetto. There are mid\n-- there are different opinions of what -- Roomkofsky, I didn\u2019t judge him so bad, okay?\nNo -- Roomkofsky\u2019s goal was to try to have as many possible Jews to survive. Naturally\nhe was under orders from the Germans. Veego was the head of the ghetto ferbotten. His\nassistant was a fellow by the name of Bardfish. But we had in the ghetto a circle -- we\nhad one fellow who was listening to the BBC news every day. And he was making up\nlittle notes that most political value for us, and I was getting such a note every day. I was\n-- there\u2019s not too many people hear that, but I was one who will get it. When somebody\ncame in and gave me a piece of paper, I knew what it did, and is that. No -- this fellow\neventually when they -- when they caught up with him, he committed suicide, hanged\nhimself. His name was Hayden Vidofsky. And was -- he didn\u2019t want to follow life in the\nGermans\u2019 hand. And dote -- the German head as you know, a krippo [indecipherable]\nside, there they were calling Jewish and tried to get away -- all Jews had to work, the\nJews were hiding, the Jews did all kind of things they wanted. And from time to time the\n[indecipherable] they were brought to the krippo. There were only -- they -- there were\nalso Jews who worked with the Germans in -- in the krippo. They used them to\n[indecipherable] to [indecipherable] to bring something, to some -- whatever it is. Now, I\nwas the office manager of the fiflagunsaftargum, in the ghetto. Which means the\ndepartment where all the food to the ghetto, for the Jews, whatever the German assigned,\ncame in to us.",
        "A: Mr. Roomkofsky wanted to get me in the beginning. I understood -- I found that out later.\nThere was a -- a lady by the name of Jacobson. Hers -- her son was a lawyer, and she\nwanted to promote her son, and when she get wind that Roomkofsky would like to -- to\nsee me, I never get called to see him, until there was a change later, Mr. Stalshi Jacobson,\nby way was related to my -- relation t-to -- I know you very well as a kid. And but she\nmaneuvered him, and I was not notified until there was a change. Jacobson was at once to\na different position, and somebody else came in to his office to be the office manager,\nand in the drawer they found my name that Roomkofsky wanted to see me, which I never\nknew.",
        "A: I met him one -- I knew about him, but I met him once, okay?",
        "A: And he was -- Roomkofsky himself was under the -- into very big pressure from the\nGermans, naturally, and he tried to get as many people to survive, as many possible, so\non. So his approach to the Germans was, we have people of every line of work, we can\ndo all type of work for the German could use, and what a German population can use.\nAnd he establish working results for all kind of things. And the German were taking\nadvantage of it too. They were using it and so on. So he was a couple time taken away by\nthe German out of town again, but after a few days, I don\u2019t think -- you see, Mr.\nRoomkofsky\u2019s secretary was a lady by the name of Dora Fuchs. Dora Fuchs was o -- the\nfamily originally from Poland, and many years ago, like many, they went to Germany.\nThey settled in Hanover, in Germany. And this Dora Fuchs became the secretary to\nRoomkofsky.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Okay?",
        "A: Okay?",
        "A: Yeah. Noy -- so he had to change of s-secretary, and he found so -- Jacobson to the legal\ndepartments, Jacobson was the lawyer. So, at this time came a new secretary to him, and\nopened the door and see a note to get me to see Roomkofsky. So -- and he knew me, so\nhe -- the following day I -- I was told to go to see Roomkofsky. So I went to see\nRoomkofsky. I come there to a office, we are standing around, people everywhere.\nRabbis, near rabbis, pela -- people, police, you name it, everybody was there. And he was\nmeeting somebody in his office. Finally he came out, and he looked around, \u201cI want to\nsee you.\u201d Left everybody stay and called me in, I\u2019m going in. He said, \u201cLook, I have a\nbig mess in the fiflagunsaftargum,,\u201d in there. This mean where the all food can be in the\naprovasultsia, the -- all the food came in at once [indecipherable] there was a big mess. \u201cI\nwant you to go right away there, take it over, and make order.\u201d No far I knew about him,\nthat there is no -- if I -- I cannot go tell anybody what I\u2019m going to do, I went right away\nover there, and I am working. He might think he\u2019s a -- he [indecipherable] I come by\nhorse and buggy, but I have to walk. So I went over there, actually there, and there was a\nfellow the -- 0 -- who head his office by the name of Roderusser, and he was unhappy\nwith him. And Roderusser was not a real professional, there\u2019s a different story. So I come\nin, and I said, \u201cRoderusser, look, don\u2019t worry. We will go, put everything together. They\nwill arrange it, and once you will [indecipherable] in the -- in the certain order we will, it\nwill work by themselves, unfort.\u201d\u2019 So, Roderusser was very afraid, because Roomkofsky\ngot aggravate, he could send him away right away to -- to be transported out to -- to\nAuschwitz, whatever it is. And -- but, he didn\u2019t do it. S --",
        "A: Okay. What was there -- you see, the Jewish bakeries from before the war, that were\nthere over on the ghetto, they were baking bread. And they had to come to buy flour to\nthe fiflagum sometime. So what they bought in their Polish money, they didn\u2019t get this\nback, because th-the German took away the Polish money, they didn\u2019t get the money.\nAnyway, when they -- this way he -- he came to transfer out the money and so on. I head\nthe department with a head cashier. There were five people working with us, to get the\nmoney, sort it out, but -- and so on. The -- the head cashier was a professional cashier\nfrom before the war, from a big bank. From the same bank where -- becau -- the\n[indecipherable] Mr. Rosenblatt came. I knew about her, I didn\u2019t know her. So -- but --\nand she was just as a -- before the war, slowly do it, one time, think of another and so on.\nThe ghetto was no time for it. So finally I saw the one day, it doesn\u2019t work. So I tells her,\n\u201cLook, Mrs. Steinbeck, you sit down at the corner, I will operate the cashier\u2019s office. You\nsit down there and watch me. And then you tell me if you can do it or not.\u201d The following\nday, the old people got there, and counting the money, sorting out, and I was sitting there,\nand I was doing the same time, collecting while I am paying out money, collecting, what\nshe say it couldn\u2019t be done. Circumstances are different, this is a war. So I worked there\nfor a whole day. At the end of the day she came into there, \u201cMr. Klipp, I will do it.\u201d\nOkay, good. That\u2019s all I needed. And then the money -- what the Jewish bakers brought\nin, the following day, the Germans took away. There came a Mr. Schwinn was his name,\na German from the ghetto Vivaldin, he came to collect the money and so on. So, from\nnow on she was -- she was handling this, and I was to get myself back to the office,\nbefore the people -- and I had people whom I knew from -- from before the war, most\naccountants I knew, and they knew me and so on. So it\u2019s all cloc pretty well. We\nsomehow man -- and Roomkofsky came after awhile, it didn\u2019t take long, I was there, and\nhe was there. So I told him, Mr. Roomkofsky, mis -- [indecipherable] I think we called\nhim, \u201cIt will be straightened out. Let me get to him orientity of what is, and I will assure\nyou after I finish, I will be able to tell you that everything works.\u201d Turned around, went\naway. And I started to organize the things, organize the people to work and so on. And 19\n-- going back to Roomkofsky as a person, as a character, what it is. In 1942, he sent us in\n5,000 from Czechoslovakia, and 5,000 from Vienna, and 5,000 from Berlin. And then\nanother transfer to 5,000 from Czechoslovakia. Most of them exsembly rich people. The\nlagers we told this what they had, this is the first time they had, they came in to the\nghetto. So, had to find to do something and so on. Among them was a Mr. Hirsch. Mr.\nHirsch was on the -- on the board of most of the heavy industry in Czechoslovakia, a\ngreat lawyer with a big legal office, and so on. And he was a sick man. Now, I tried to\nhelp him as much as you could. At the same time we were getting in potatoes. What\nhappened? My [indecipherable] always. You know that from the farmer to get permission\nfor one shipment of -- of -- of potatoes, with the same permission we get five, six, seven,\neight shipments of potatoes. So the whole night we are working, and I was working with\nthem. We are working with a little hand wagon what they pushed, what they pulled, and\nso on there, but they -- just to get away from the -- from the place where they are. At the\nsame time, I had to watch to make Roomkofsky satisfied too, that -- that I am not\nproblem. Among these people, as I say, was a Mr. Hirsch, extremely wealthy man, and\nMr. Hirsch showed me, \u201cMr. Klipp, when the war ends, half what I have is yours.\u201d So I\nthought myself, first let\u2019s survive, and then we\u2019ll talk. Then, as -- so, what I do with these\npeople? So, there was a little shack in the corner of the fiflagunsaftargum,, there was a\nlittle shack. I put in in this shack a long table with benches, and -- and there I -- I working\nfive people, Mr. Hirsch was among them, who couldn\u2019t do anything else, they were not\nused to anything else. Everybody had their pencil with the pad and sitting there. And\nnobody knew about this arrangement, the [indecipherable]. Mr. Roomkofsky discovered\nit one time when he was down there, gwaiting to corner. \u201cHey, hey,\u201d comes in there,\n\u201cwhat is this? What are the people doing here?\u201d So I tell him, \u201cPresent, they are waiting\nfor the soup.\u201d He looked at me, turned around, went out without saying a word. So, I had\nto -- so Iam almost legal with them -- having them. So they were work over there, and\nwere -- they sitting there hours, and waiting for the soup, then the soup came, then they\nwent, and they sit -- went to their families, to the qualas, wherever they are. This was\ngoing on for [indecipherable] Roomkofsky, his reaction, what a deleeng I told him they\nwait for the soup. This was for him -- and this told me a lot about him. He wanted to -- I\nknew about him more than I knew him, what I hear, these activities and -- in -- in -- in --\nin the homes for children with their parents, all kind of things. In the part of the Lodz -- I\nwas actually in the same place, in different part of town. So at one time he -- he called\nme, and he said look, here 1s a big -- here 1s a family what the father\u2019s going into the\narmy, and he has a family of small children. If I take care of the smallest, he will take\ncare of the bigger ones. He -- a deal. So I say, I\u2019ll put in the smallest children in the order\nof [indecipherable] and so on. Anyway, this -- this worked pretty good with him. This\nwent on until -- and yeah, and -- and every day Mr. Shrink was coming, collecting the --\nthe -- the -- the Polish money, take away the order. At the same time Mr. Meemorf, who\nwas before the war a coffee merchant, a big coffee merchant, and he created for himself,\nafter the war he should have something too. So he was sending in to the ghetto things like\ncacao, tea, rice, something like it -- it was -- what he couldn\u2019t touch, and told not to\ntouch it. And whatever a transport came in of his things, the following day he was in, and\nI had to give him a report what I have. Match a long paper, everything was beautiful. It\nalways match. But, I had people with epidamia, dysentaria, all kind of, all kind of -- and\nrice was the only thing what I had. So I had the -- the man who -- who headed the\n[indecipherable] the magazine, a fellow Moshberg, he didn\u2019t survive, I -- he was a very\nnice guy, so I told him, \u201cLook, let\u2019s opim a sacrifice, and when people call, they having\ndysentaria with the -- give them a little bit rice, so nobody should know that you were the\nonly one who can give what they need.\u201d And this [indecipherable] for awhile. So finally\nthe German collected all -- all the money and so on, and I s -- falsified Roomkofsky with\nthe cash -- with the -- with the handling and so on, and it worked smoothly. So -- so the\noffice worked, and I could award it to myself too, to taking care of [indecipherable] and\nall kind of things.",
        "A: So, and this was -- the ghetto was goin -- going like it -- like this until they -- they started\nto liquidate the ghetto.",
        "A: Well now [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: He what?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh yeah. In cases like this, without corruption, nothing can be done. You see, what is,\nthere was more -- most people who were involved there -- he was the head of the ghetto\nfor about -- of the ghetto, Roomkofsky, but then the other department, who could make\nall those deals with the Germans to duplicate or triplicate potatoes, shipments, all kind of\nthis. Somebody who knew the underworld a little bit. And there was -- and fellows who\nwere active in the more advanced under-underground thing, they came to power, and they\nwere -- would they know how to handle, how to buy, whom to buy, what to buy with, and\nso on. And there was -- and this was the main thing, was nothing what they could do to it.\nYou see, he thi -- this is the way we are getting 1n potatoes much more than we -- than we\nshould have, and all the food items, and so on, so on. But all lead to their activities, 1t was\na means for us to get it.",
        "A: Oh yeah, no question about. You see, the -- whatever they officially send in, that the\nghetto can afford, 1t was divided by the corporation, by so many, and we have distribution\npoints, and we gave out, whenever this [indecipherable] what is the number of people in\nthis area, and we gave them as much people a -- a -- as much food as was there. But\nnothing officially came in. The unofficial we couldn\u2019t touch. So it was a -- there is -- ina\ncase like this there were no normalities, forget about normality at this time. Everything --\nmost people from the -- I would call them underground for this. But most people came to\npower, came to di -- let\u2019s say we created a sondercommando, was created in ghetto. The\npurpose of the -- of the sondercommando was to -- to try to get from the Jews the jewel,\ntheir values, whatever this is, and so on, and give them to the German. Now those people\nare involved in it, they are people too. So they knew how to handle who could work, no --\nthe -- the head of the department was a fellow by the name of David Yeelgla. He himself\nhas a background, what I don\u2019t know. He became a big man in the ghetto. His assistant\nwas a fellow by the name of Mark Kleeger, whom I knew. And Mark Kleeger was the\neducated fellow, and -- and no other one was the -- doing, the connection, the bribing, the\nall -- the all kind of things. And this ghetto -- how they, if they collected something, what\nthey did, they give in to the German or not. Naturally there were [indecipherable] and\nyou couldn\u2019t expect -- if they had to bribe German, they had to take it from somewhere,\nso they took from the [indecipherable] and buy the German whatever it is. It is in -- in\nsuch a time there is very hard to -- to talk about legal, and with lawyer, with problems,\nand this is the way they get the [indecipherable] it.",
        "A: Yes, there was --",
        "A: -- there was. Mr. Roomkofsky had a group of people who used to get what they call\ntalons. The leader of the department was a Miss Ivershitz, yeah Ivershitz. And she gave --\nand people of those families were in charge of something, who were -- who were\nconsidered helping Roomkofsky run the whole thing, they were getting talons for their\nfamilies. Was --",
        "A: A talon, there was such a coupon to go and pick up some food, whatever it is, to different\ndepartments. That\u2019s a -- but --",
        "A: Oh-oh. A talon, what you call that this thing was a piece of paper what Roomkofsky\ndepartment gave out for those people to go to a meat department, get some meat, to this\nto get some these, and so on, and he -- no, we had in ghetto the -- another thing, too.\nThose Jews who worked [indecipherable] krippo, and those Jews who worked with the\nkrippo, they were going to town with the krippos, and so on, so on. And they were always\ncoming in and he need a loaf of bread for a German, [indecipherable] for themse -- this\nthe way it went. I gave it to them. Those people that are going, and there was we -- we\nhave no medication, for example. And medication was a very important thing for a lot of\npeople. The most thing, B12 was a very -- why tha -- those people who were working\nwith the Germans to ghetto, they could get it if I contact them. So, there was a fellow\nwhom I knew, some wa -- he came to ask for something, and I used this connection. The\nname was Wortman, he was old. [indecipherable] to talk with them, and so on, so on.\nAnd I always told him I have a request for these, for [indecipherable] for other thing, and\nhe tried to get me, because he wanted something in return, bread, or whatever it is. And\nthis way -- and this was my contact with the -- with the unofficial [indecipherable]\ndepartment [indecipherable] to use them as much as I could. And -- and when I get\nmedication, I had the problem who to give it. If I had a secretary to the fiflagunsaftargum\n-- Dagushensky, Yelsi Dagushensky, her father was before the war the -- the cormeister\nfor the Jewish temple. And he was a sick man, a elderly man. And I get one medication\nwhat she needs for her father, and then was a young mother who need it. Who should I\ngive it to you? I give it to the young mother. And -- and I became a -- a enemy of\nDagushensky because I felt a y -- a young mother with a -- with a little baby, if you\ncouldn\u2019t help her, we are in -- we are in a pievin to a certain way, we have to make\nchoices what are not normally done, but has to be done. So this way -- this way it works.",
        "A: I did. As much as I could. Every time this Mr. Wortman went to town with a krippo, I\ngive [indecipherable] and I was sitting and waiting, and finally I -- get me these thing, get\nme these thing. Whatever I get, I get away, I think I helped, because I didn\u2019t need\nanything for myself, I gived everything away.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t use them. I never ac-accepted a regular -- what I called talon before, a little slip to\ngo and get milk, and I had contact with it.

I\ndidn\u2019t do it. I felt that this is dishonest, and I am not in the position to be able to use\ndishonesty just to -- to -- I didn\u2019t use it, except when I came to a point when my wife was\nvery ill, and I did get a different type of food. So I talked to -- I was [indecipherable] say\nI need a special talon for my wife, certain food and so on, and I get it. But this is the only\ntime I was using it for my own. Never did.",

The manager of the\n-- ferfling of the food department where I was working was Roomkofsky\u2019s ex-partner\nfrom years ago, friend of his. And he put him in charge of the department. Then every\ndepartment had a commissar also. A high police ranking officer who was assigned to, and\nhe what -- had to handle. In my case there was a fellow by the name of Reingold,\nSigmund Reingold. So this is the way it -- 1t operates.",
        "A: Part of the Jewish administration.",
        "A: The Jewish administration was fully well organized. We had the departments, we have a\nkitchen department, who was responsible for cooking soups and so on. And we have all\nkinds departments for -- for a different specialty for different work and so on. And the\nmost what I was connected with was -- was the -- the department wa -- where the food\ncame through. And they were very well organized. There was a -- let\u2019s say there was a\nwhat you call meldinkovi -- registration of people, of vadiserobun, which was headed by\na good friend of my, Naftali, a lawyer [indecipherable]. And let\u2019s say when somebody\nneeded a job for somebody, he went there and asked for an assignment for a job. And one\ntime Mr. Shinsheevy, my manager comes up to me, and say, \u201cLook, Dave, I know you\nknow everybody, I need a job for two girls. Can you get it for me?\u201d I said, \u201cSure, I will\ntry to do it.\u201d And by this -- okay -- Estelle was one of the girls who he gave her the job.\nAnd this is the first time I met her there. When she sa -- heard, or saw that sh -- he asked\nme for jobs for the two girls, she came up -- and she graduated the same year from --\nfrom -- from high school, and I saw her diploma, everything excellent, she was a good\nstudent. And the other girl was another girl there whom I didn\u2019t know it. And so I went to\nthe department and came with the assignment -- with those two jobs. And they -- and\nthey were both employed.

My room -- room with a small kitchen was Droska 15, across the street. I\nwant to be close if something happen, I can always communicate and so on.

It\ncould be done if you -- if the -- some people did dishonest things, I\u2019m sure they did. For\nexample, some people did things where they were not informed -- where they had no\nright to do anyway. I found out after the war mainly a few cases like it. So it is -- but in\ndoing the ghetto, and in the -- during the life on it, was a different story. I considered\nmyself a member of the ghetto, and I have to live like everybody does.

So this fellow, one day finally came, and how they came across that he\nis the one who is having the news, and the radio and so on, and when he found it out, he\nhanged himself.

And this was the interest.\nAnd one time the German came up with an idea, they -- to -- to build -- frame build\nhouses. So they start with a special department to build houses what can be built and\ntransferred to Germany. But this was a big thing. And when an inspection came, and I\nhappened to be there when an inspection came -- everybody had to be there, so they\nshow, so all the people, from the officers, and the [indecipherable] saw group of people\nworking on it.

I knew her sister\u2019s boyfriend was a bigshot in the -- in the Jewish police there,\nand he will get her out. And he did. But somebody else went. So if you helped anybody,\nyou put somebody in. So it was such a -- I mentioned wa -- a ex-coworker Mr. Vinerige\nlong time ago, he was coming in the morning into my office, sitting in the corner. Was\nhis, nobody else.

And this is the way it was assigned.\nAlthough this was not exactly what the German thought we should give everybody\nwhatever it is. Did we have more, we have more potatoes, so we give more. If we -- was\na time, whatever get, we get a lot of shipment of potatoes, this was helping, naturally.\nThis way people could get a little bit more.

        "A: And what -- and with the ghetto, do you have any specific questions I mi -- I think I know\nquite about the ghetto. There were the department of working, and lot of people who after\nthe war immigrated, gave different recollection, different thing. And this mostly cut in in\nmy period from after the war in Germany. When we were liberated from the camps, my\nidea was I knew at this time the [indecipherable] 19 people, whatever it is. Anyway, and I\nthought I will try to do what I can to help. This is what was -- what it is. Not having an\nidea how many there are. There were a lot of -- more people than we expected. And\ndifferent people came to work with us, and so on, so on. And some people -- but in a case\nlike this, in a time like this, not in a case, the people who have more experience with\ndoing illegalities, are better active doing something. For example, we have -- we -- I\norganized the office to help people from concentration camp in Germany after the war.\nWhat you call vicasette Auschwitz. Officially I am with hauptaushus [indecipherable]\nwith a haftlinger. And this -- came in a fellow, and then there wa -- in the concentration\ncamp, there were green winkles, and red winkles. The green were criminals, red was\npolitical. No -- nothing -- he had a man working with us by the name of Geerob Ganda he\npassed away. And he was a green winkle, criminal. But he belonged to a youth\norganization who worked anti-Hitler, and they made -- they rob banks, and some of\nwhatever they could. And one time he [indecipherable], he was in the [indecipherable |\nand he was stamped with the criminal winkle. But his explanation, I have it from him, his\nexplanation was he did it for the group, what tried to help the -- [indecipherable] other\npeople. He did -- after the war he had to run away, had to -- went to Israel, he went back,\ncame back. He died in Hanover. And so this fella knew how to handle those cases. Was a\n-- even -- Ge-Germans basically would like to benefit, and when they have connection\nwith a -- with a office, with a conshertoes, and they were able to get a little bit different\nfood on certain occasions, they went all for it. So -- but all those people who were in the\ncamps as -- as political, they were actually from political activities. A lot of people who\nwere from the criminal thing were political in whatever their actions. So, is the -- the\n[indecipherable] they forget to take the bot for. And for this Geerab Ganda, he knew so\nmuch from the [indecipherable] that I was inclined to believe him. He was able to\nmanage the German\u2019s authorities to give us more food, more this, more this. He was able\nto do it.",

        "A: We -- I went to the ghetto in the beginning, after my father\u2019s death in 17\" of January.",
        "A: Then I was t -- 1940 -- then they came in and gave me 10 minutes to leave the house, and\nonly take what I can. And I left the ghetto on the 28\" of August, 1944.",
        "A: Oh yeah. They were -- we were [indecipherable] getting out of the ghetto, they were\nsetting transport every day to send out. And there -- there was -- they decided to liquefy\nthe ghetto, and just leave about 50,000 people to do the cleaning wa -- to clean up, or\nsomething like it.",
        "A: 50,000. This was at this time they estimate 50,000 Jews to leave there to do the cleaning\njob after everybody left. And so they took -- if the numbers are right, but this is the\nnumbers we were given. Not 50,000, but 50 people, pardon me. Skip the thousands. I\u2019m\nsorry. And so it was at this time they were organizing transports every day, and it came to\nthis, my transport left on the 28\".",
        "A: No. They loaded it in the -- close the transport cars, no windows or nothing, put us in as\nmany as they could, pushed in, lock the door, and that\u2019s it. And we didn\u2019t know anything.\nI didn\u2019t know where we are going. Nobody knew. Had a lot of people -- not lot of, but a\nfew people suffocated there. And they died there, in it. No, we came after, and I don\u2019t --\nat this time I lost the count of time, if it was a day or two, when they finally -- when it\ncame to a point and they opened the gate and let us out. So then, this was Auschwitz.",
        "A: Was [indecipherable] was a reception, a big field. And we had to go down from -- from\nthe cars, leave everything in the cars what we are left -- what we have left, just go down\nand form two lines, mens one side, women to the other side. And then, on the head of it\nstood the German, the famous -- oh boy, and he make selection, with the finger. Right,\nleft, right, left. The right what he assumed were good to work. To me he hesitates for a\nlittle while, but put me to the right, to the working. And to the -- and the -- they -- they\ndid the same thing to the women\u2019s line, too. And the one who were taken to the left,\nnever heard about them, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: When we came to Auschwitz, was my sister, and my wife.",
        "A: To Auschwitz? My si -- my wife and my sister, Rachel.",
        "A: They lined up -- I was in one line, and the women was in the -- in the other line. And this\nhere the last time when we -- when we saw each other. We looked at each other, but we\nhad to move, move, move, move. And this the way it was. And never saw before, never\nsaw after. It\u2019s the last time.",
        "A: No. We didn\u2019t see it, but later when we went in, and we were taken through the halls to\nwash, to be shaved, to clean our [indecipherable] then there were some prisoners\nworking, who were there before, working in a establishments there.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: What was?",
        "A: What I think this? Yeah, no thinking at all at this time, you don\u2019t think. You following\nthe certain way of life, and thinking -- no, I don\u2019t think anybody want to think, and\nnobody was thinking. We knew this 1s nothing pleasant for us, and what will happen, who\nknows? Roomkofsky was with the same train. They took him off, his father and adopted\nson, and so on, and they put him in a van. I saw them take it into the van. He came to\nAuschwitz with letters of re-recommendation from Veevofe to treat him well. So this way\nhe was taken to a van. This is a van, when they start to move, gas comes in, and they\nsuffocated. I don\u2019t meet -- I didn\u2019t meet anybody who ever saw Roomkofsky afterwards.\nSo, this was the answer to me about Roomkofsky.",
        "A: No, but I saw a special type of van, and so my assumption was this is the end of it.",
        "A: Then we were taken to Auschwitz and given numbers. They -- in 1944 was the last time\nthey tattooed numbers, they didn\u2019t have any time to do it. My number was 52962, a little\nmetal tag, and it was a sh -- painted on on this uniform, 52962, this is my number, under\nthis number I was known, there no name. And -- and then we were sent, the first transport\nwhat we were sent was a thousand people what were sent to continue [indecipherable]\nworker to the rubber factory.",
        "A: In Auschwitz? I would say the most five days. I don\u2019t think any more.",
        "A: Oh no, in Auschwitz I didn\u2019t work at all. Just trying to get out of there. The smell in\nAuschwitz was not bearable.",
        "A: Burned flesh, burning everything. Came on from Birkenau, where the -- where the gas\nchambers were.",
        "A: Yeah, and they know about -- there was us people what they take to work. And then\nwhen they called -- when they call who is a -- for example, a carpenter, everybody was a\ncarpenter. When they call whatever it is, everybody is a specialist. For this arrangement,\nsome people made it, some people, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Oh, to work?",
        "A: They sent a group of thousand people, and I was in the area count a thing -- a thousand\npeople, it was not a individual choice, it was a count of thousand people, you were there.",
        "A: And then we were sent to continue [indecipherable] work, as I said, continue\n[indecipherable] work -- employed people from -- from concentration camps. And the SS\nget paid for, they didn\u2019t do it. So we were sent there, but they need -- there was a camp\nset up not far, three miles, maybe two miles, so we could walk every night home, and\nevery night go back to -- and every day go back to work. There were 12 Polish, they did -",
        "A: -- they couldn\u2019t tattoo any more, I think the last time they tattoo was \u00b044.",
        "A: Okay, then we wer -- then we went there, in the -- in a [indecipherable] they have set up a\ncamp not far, to be the barracks for us, and we had to work in the factory there. Now the\nfactory was -- was producing all kind of rubber goods for the Germans, and the -- and the\nmain thing was to produce [indecipherable] for tiles. So the rubber was coming down\nfrom the third floor, liquid, and came on the current floor, and there were big machines\nturning the thing, and -- and they get harden, and we had to carve them with knives to\nmake pieces of them, so they can go through again, and so on. Now, they were mostly --\nthey were civilian workers too, who worked with it, mostly Poles. The Poles were\ncoming into work every time, in shift. They leave [indecipherable] far, but they were\nbrought in to work, and so on.",
        "A: In Hanover. It\u2019s a big, big territory.",
        "A: What, the camp?",
        "A: A German factory.",
        "A: Oh, pardon me.",
        "A: No, no. We were all part of Neuengamme, all the camps around the area belonged to --\nthey had -- the headquarter of Neuengamme, in the area. So -- and we were part of it. So\nwe were there, and we had to work two shifts. Now, working on the shifts, cutting the\nrubber with the -- the Poles who were coming there, the Poles, they were volunteers to\nwork, and so on, they get gloves, and things to protect themself, we didn\u2019t get it. So we\nhave to somewhat burn the finger, burn the finger. So when he will cutting it, try to do\nthe best of the thing like this. And this time, somehow, I attracted the attention of a g-\nGerman master, who was going around see how everybody is doing, and he spoke\nGerman, and I know German, so we get in -- in a little conversation, and -- and he\nbecame interested, and visit me as often as he could. At one time, th -- and then he comes\nin one time and tells me he -- he is being transferred, and if I need anything what -- what\nhe can help me, I should contact him. I said, \u201cOkay, who are you, where should I contact\nyou?\u201d So there was a running sign around in the office there, Herr towans commarada\nedisnow pay. The -- the man who the -- the trusted men from the National Socialistic\nParty is he [indecipherable] me. But later on he confide to me he was never a Nazi, he\nnever belonged to coo -- but this was his job with the factory, he worked there for many\nyears. So then one time, during, I think, yeah, then in seven -- we worked on machines --\nthey were special machines to make amon, and this happened with -- and I finished my\nshift, and we were taken back to the barracks. After a little while, a SS man came to the\nroom and called my number. So, come. So I go. Followed him back to the factory. And\nturned out to be they had a few machines working upstairs, and the machines jumped\nsomehow, they couldn\u2019t make them go. There was a -- a German master, and his\nassistant, and they couldn\u2019t make the machines go. I was working on this type of\nmachines five at a time, and I knew the machines. Because the Poles came, and they were\ngoing hiding, and I worked for them. So they gave me a piece of bread once in awhile. So\n-- then -- so I come there, and then -- and they\u2019re stuck in the work, and they couldn\u2019t\nmake them, and the master comes up, and his eyes, you could see right away, he\u2019s not a\nfriend of mine. And he told me, \u201cYou know how to work these machines?\u201d I say, \u201cYes, I\nknow.\u201d \u201cDo you know how to work one machine?\u201d I say yes. \u201cGo work.\u201d I went, put up a\nmachine. After I let the machine go, I didn\u2019t ask any question, put up another machine. I\nwas working, and they were looking, and they work with their machines, and trying to fix\nit. I had it that this night I am working on three machines the same time, some\n[indecipherable] and they couldn\u2019t make their own machine go. So this -- this aggravated\nthem very, very much. Okay by then the morning, we had to go back and come back, I\nhad to wait -- no, I didn\u2019t go back. They told me you stay here, lie down for a couple\nhours, then you\u2019re back to your shifts. Okay. This was [indecipherable]. So then I didn\u2019t\nsee him, this friend of my, I seen him for a long, long time. One time I ge -- daytime, an\nSS man came in to the iddel, and called my number. And I was working. Come. I had to\nfollow him. So I followed him to a big, big office, a long table where there sitting maybe\n12 or 16 people around the -- around the table there. They were probably given a positive\ninformation about me, that I can help, and they were trying to set me up for a good job\nfor -- for after the war. So, first of all they give me a chair to sit down, and had a little\nconversation in German, just to check my German. So we\u2019re talking. Then finally they\ncame to the point, that is my knowledge of German, and with my experience in this work,\nI can build up myself a great career for after the war, and work with them, and do it --\nhelp them [indecipherable] and so on. So I was very pleased, I was -- thank you for the\nacknowledgement, and -- and polite conversation, and I was dismissed not knowing\nexactly what there is [indecipherable]. There is [indecipherable] they wanted to train me\nas a knowledgeable man who helped to run the machines, and all kind of things. I was\ntransferred to the upper place where all the rubber were mixed. I was very little\n[indecipherable] but many other things. And there with was everything what you put in in\nthe cooking machine was -- made me -- I wa -- black up and down, I couldn\u2019t wash it out\nfor weeks. See, the question there [indecipherable], but at the time this -- and when this\nwas going on for -- for quite awhile until November 30. November 30, 1944. November\n30 they came up and told us the department is not happy with all of you, so we are going\nto transfer you to -- to a different. And the office was a walking distance, probably an\nhour. We walked to a place called Ahlen. Ahlen was a -- a ex-asphalt mine. There was\nnot acting -- nothing there. They wanted to create a factory in this asphalt mine, so it has\nto be dynamited, put hole to dynamite, explode it, take out all the junk, all that, and so on,\nso on. And make it clear, which [indecipherable] this. And finally they came to the point\nwhen is clear enough, and they wanted to set up -- so we worked with dynamite, with all\nkind of things for the Germans. And [indecipherable] and every time to -- to take out,\npush up, blows up, and so at one time there was -- I am pushing up and I\u2019m -- and \u2019m\ntrying to go back, with pushing oh -- not by myself, with a few other people, and the\nGerman watch man was -- wa-was saying, give it back to me. [indecipherable], so I say,\n\u201cGere shtatin zeebeeta.\u201d Gere shtatin is a nice German expression for please, excuse me.\nHe tells, \u201cOh, bitte, bitte.\u2019 From this time we became buddies. Every time I pass by he\nwant to have a conversation with me. And we were talking a lot, and he was put in -- he\nwas out of the army, service a long time, but they needed a young people for the front, so\nthey took all the -- all the la -- people, put them in the SS to guard the camps. This is the\nway it was. And this was going on until we cleared the outside mine, made floors, made a\nfactory, and then -- and put in machinery, so they started to work, for this daily, daily\nhard work.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. Every -- all the camps were, they were part of Neuengamme.\nNeuengamme was the head camp for the whole territory, for the -- all the a -- other. The\nNeuengamme h-head office was in Hamburg, I think.",
        "A: The living condition were excellent. We had the coffee pot in the morning to -- in -- in\nthe rag -- the -- they brought in a big jar with coffee, and made sure that everybody\nreceives coffee. Then they turned around the whole cage on the floor, and we had to\nscrub the floor with the coffee. Sometime we get the coffee [indecipherable], sometime\nnot. But this the way life was. And then this -- and then we went to work, on these floors.",
        "A: In the -- 1n each barracks there were -- there were a few barracks. In -- in -- in each\nbarrack there was about 30 - 32 people, and so on.",
        "A: The wa -- yeah, there was a bunk you could lay down. Two story.",
        "A: But -- but you could lay down, yeah. And --",
        "A: And food then -- then -- at work we -- we had to go for lunch and get food, and so on,\nyeah. The soup -- this -- the -- mo-most of the food was of a soup. Could hardly find a\npiece of potato there, but listen, this is the one we have, and this -- we have to survive, to\ngo on with.",
        "A: Only men, only men.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Talking about the Germans, I knew Germany from before the war. Etiquette is nice,\nexcellent people, and so on. This type, let\u2019s say for example, the -- the cassette Auschwitz\nwhat we organize was th -- to help people from concentration camp. One day comes in a\nGerman farmer, and gives me a bill, and want me to pay it, for potatoes he delivered to\nthe SS. So I tell, oh, and what happened to the potatoes? You people ate it, so why\nshouldn\u2019t you pay for? This was their mentality. Basically, they were jealous people. If\nsomebody had something, they want and so on. I had one time -- I --",
        "A: Yeah, after the war.",
        "A: I had -- one time, I had no car, and there were no car to get somewhere. One time comes\nto me a German, and say, \u201cI know where a car is,\u201d and tells me of a farmer that he has in\nhis thing hidden, covered up a car. The following there I went over there, a few people,\nand we took home the car. But this is characteristic for them, they were jealous of\nanother, and if somebody had something, they liked to have it, too. So it was a --a\ndifferent type of experience with Germans between these two groups of German. I cannot\ntell in -- tell the different groups that different people out of different groups, whatever it\nis, but this is the way it is.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: What was happening in the war? Nothing. This is a point I never touched. I was only\ninterested if he could help me to find out what will happen next to us. So he told\n[indecipherable], tomorrow I will let you know. And next time when he came to lead us\nto the toc, he told me the -- the -- the camp is to be set for evacuation on the sixth of\nApril. But from the outset what happen, I never went in with any German, no matter how\nfriendly, in politics. Was a dangerous area, and I stood away from it. I j -- so this is -- the\nonly thing was that I find out for him when the camp will be evacuated. And the camp\nwas evacuated officially on Friday, April the sixth, 1945. And then when -- then you see,\nthe -- the camp was in the middle of a field. People were going by Sundays for walks, and\nSO was going on and so. There were nobody who didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But when\nthe camp was evacuated on April the sixth, the evacuated, I mean that the marching\npeople went, and we were left who -- who couldn\u2019t walk, or couldn\u2019t march. Then,\npeople from all sides came in, disconnected electrical wiring from -- from -- from the\nfences, and trying to be nice and help us, they brought in coffee. We says, okay. But then\nour young people, very unpatient, run out, start to go around, look. And I begged them\ndon\u2019t go, the German are still around somewhere. What happened we don\u2019t know. No, we\nknow we are here tomor -- and on the following day, Saturday, came an SS man with a\ntruck, and loaded us on the truck, we were 19 people from this camp. And these 19\npeople, [indecipherable] drove us to a place called the Shizenplatz. The Shizenplatz was a\nplace where the German SS were leaving their officers, and everything and so on. So, he\ndrove us there, and there before the gate is a general, a professional, looks almost gray,\nstanding. And here Plotsam and I was on the truck. Here Plotsam, he get that here was\nsome 19 people for execution. And the general told him, \u201cLook, we are killing people in\na war, but we are not killing people who -- who -- who we\u2019re not fighting. Your friends\nleft already.\u201d So he told us to go off the truck, and he told the [indecipherable] and he\u2019s\nall off. So\u2019s the last I saw about him -- of him. Not far away was a French POW camp,\nand they motioned to us to come close to them. And this was a big -- a big help to us. So\nwe went over there, and they told us, \u201cLook, you never know if the German come back or\nnot. This uniform is not good. You have to go change uniforms.\u201d I said okay, how,\nwhere? So, \u201cThis is a little building there, break in. There are the uniforms what we are\nwearing.\u201d So I took my people, and we walk in there, and we took uniform, changed the\nuniforms, and put them in and joined them. They would be very -- they were very\nhelpful. They were trying to help us with little bit what they had, but they didn\u2019t have too\nmuch either. So -- it was a -- a certain type of a good experience in bad times.",
        "A: Next this was -- this already was the next ist day on Wednesday, the 11\" of April. A lady\ncomes running in, and say there are Americanos in the areas, be the American\n[indecipherable]. So, naturally I got the courage to go. So we went to center of the town,\nand there I saw the American tanks, first time I saw them, saw on the -- the lemt. And so\nI up -- I approached the officer in charge there where it was, and I told them as far as I\nknew we are 19 people, and we need some assistance, we don\u2019t know what to do. So he --\ntalking a little bit German, a little bit -- he must have been Jewish, too, or -- or he -- or he\nknew a little bit more [indecipherable]. So he told me to be the liaison, that he cannot talk\nto all 19 people, but a be -- and he appointed me -- gave me a piece of paper, so I can\nwalk after the time where 1s walking not permitted. And so then try to keep informed.\nThen we went to a place there were people there sitting down, that we were actually\nhousing. Still, ours had benches and so on, so on. And there we were sitting, and evening\nAmerican soldiers came to visit us. And there -- pardon me -- and there where it was --\nthank you -- and there where it was, my first disappointment, what it is? We are sitting,\nblack soldiers, white soldiers. Comes in a white soldier, shakes hands with every white,\nnot with the black. No, it didn\u2019t slide good with me, but there\u2019s the way it is, I don\u2019t what\nto think. That\u2019s the way it was. And they -- the black people didn\u2019t see anything abnormal\nin it. This was the life what they had. Then, among them was a fellow asked me if I have\nsomebody in New York, I say, \u201cSure, I have a sister in New York.\u201d \u201cDo you remember\nwhere she live?\u201d I gave him -- yeah, gave him the a -- the address. His wife lived a\ncouple blocks from there. He notified his wife, and he went away, I never saw him again.\nBut he notify -- later, I found out when I came to the States, he notified his wife, and she\ncontacted my sister. I never saw even the mo -- the units went off, so [indecipherable].\nAnd this was -- we were sitting there, and trying to house the -- and we had to eat\nsomething, so we found them whole rice, cages of rice. I never cooked rice in my life. I\ndidn\u2019t know when you put in a little bit, 1t grows up, [indecipherable]. So I put in a little\nbit, and I got plenty of it, but this is -- the first time you learn, next time, do better. And\nthis is where life is -- slowly went back until we were able to resettle from there. We\nsettled in -- in -- in -- in Hanover himself, in the town, and so on.",
        "A: Pardon me?",
        "A: No, no, no, they were -- we sa -- went into town, and wherever apartments available, we\nget in. And there were many apartments available. And we were not -- we were only 19\npeople, so was not a big deal. And some of them are still live in Germany. There was my\nexperience in camp, the doctors. There was a -- a sickum, what they called, and there was\na doctor, a fellow who I knew from ghetto, who -- he did one year to graduate medical\nschool from -- from Italy, but he was only a shop. In the ghetto, he was working as a\ndoctor. He was very smart, and very knowledgeable. Dr. Faglovitch, his name now is\nFago. And the -- the order -- yeah, was a -- then there was a Dr. Vondaykunt in Belgium,\npicked up on the street, send him away to the camp, his family never knew where he is,\nwhat he is. This I found out after the war when they came looking for him. So -- but he\nwas a doctor, and he became ill one time, himself, to the Jewish Dr. Faglovitch, who was\nnot a [indecipherable] doctor told the German he had typhus. What are you talking, what\ndi-did you know about typhus? So, not -- they went away, it\u2019s not typhus. Then he get\nworse, so I called [indecipherable] they -- they brought a doctor from outside, a German\ndoctor from outside, and he says, yeah, that was typhus. It was too late already, couldn\u2019t\nsave him any more. Later on I find out more about him because the family came to look\nfor him, and somehow they were directed to me, said maybe I knew something more\nabout, but I was in the same group, and so on, and so on.",
        "A: What --",
        "A: When?",
        "A: After the war --",
        "A: I organized the -- the office of the cartsertosious. This means to help -- to help the contact\nwith all people, with the Germans. There was no way that th -- a survivor and a German\ncould get together without a fight. Never happen. And I had to avoid this. And what we\ndid at this time, the German authorities had orders from the American, then from the\nBritish to help us towelon to look for people. So everybody had to get a -- 10 mark, and a\n[indecipherable] to buy food and so on I get this. And tried to tasser. She was one of\nthem, she was going looking for -- for her mother.",
        "A: And -- and pe -- yeah. And people, they are going. So I saw the -- how do you do when\nthey have to work to the Germans, sign for the thing, get a card. It didn\u2019t work out. I saw\nthis would be murder. So I told them, \u201cOkay, look, why don\u2019t you give me the cards, the\nmoney, and I will deliver you the following day [indecipherable] complacent.\u201d And this -\n- and this work this way. So I was every day what I was paid ousen to. I gave them a list\nwith the signatures, and they replaced me the money with the things on it,\n[indecipherable] looking, couldn\u2019t even. So this way we -- we had the cardset office\nworking to help people as much as possible.",
        "A: We -- we -- yeah, we organized [indecipherable] office, in middle of 1t on -- was a empty\nfew rooms, and -- and this is well known, if I -- the way I\u2019m all people [indecipherable]\nthey are. I [indecipherable] if there was -- if there is time for it, for a little episode. The\nBritish relief -- first were American, came in from HIAS, from the other groups, and Joint\nhelp. Then came the British relief in, who took over. And they were -- in the British was\na rabbi Dr. Monk, who kept with me a contact, mostly of religious things, what he want,\nwhere anybody needs something, so on, so on. And one time he comes for me, and says -\n- | take away your time with it? Am I take away your time with it?",
        "A: And one time he -- he comes to me, and say he has to go for two weeks to London, and\ngives me a telephone number, if something -- I will need something with a religious\nthing, to call this number. So a fella came up a couple days later, a Polish dressed officer,\na doctor on -- on a motorcycle, and say he\u2019s actually a Jew, and he want to go back to\nJudaism.
