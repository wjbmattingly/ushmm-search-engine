        "Q: ...name, date of birth, where were you born?",
        "A: I was born November 15, November 20, 1915 in Brooklyn, New York.",
        "Q: Your name\u2019?",
        "A: My name is Herman Rafael Goldberg.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family, family life.",
        "A: My family life was, was very busy. My mother was a teacher first and then a\nprincipal of the school in Brooklyn. My sister was a singer, she sang with Rosa\nPonselle in some of the operatic productions and um there were just 2 of us my\nsister and I. I loved sports right from the beginning but did not avoid other\nactivities. Um there were some firm expectations from my parents to adhere to\nmy responsibilities in school. My father had a hardware store to which I was\nexpected to contribute by learning about the business and helping when necessary.\nMy father was president of the hardware association of New York City and during\nsome of those days when he had to leave early, I took over in the store and he\ngave me information that I, I just didn\u2019t have. Um, so we had a diverse family,\nmother very busy in her life. My sister busy with emphasis in music, mine with\nemphasis in sports.",
        "Q: What about your religious life, what kind of background did you have?",
        "A: Um we were born into a Jewish family. I was working at a very early age. Um\nagain part of my mother\u2019s and father\u2019s feeling was as I said before my\ncontribution to the family well being included some working time. And uh that\nincluded complete family life including attendance at neighborhood temple. Uh\nincluding kinds of experiences where I would meet other young men and young\nwomen at temple and uh understanding my father\u2019s and mother\u2019s respect for the\nreligion of their parents which were on display through photographs of an earlier\nera.",
        "Q: So religion was an important part of your life.",
        "A: I would say it was a vital part. Uh I can\u2019t classify it as important because there\nwere a lot of things that were important and the presence of religion and in the\n1\n2\nfamily the Friday evening um service was important to me. Uh it gave me a very\nnice feeling that when I was in Israel one year, um I um was a professor. I was a\nFulbright professor at the University of Belunga in Italy. And um one little\nepisode I will share with you which is a great joy to me. Um a welcoming uh\nparty was scheduled by Abba Eban and Sonya Marabach head of education in\nIsrael. Uh and I was to be the, the guest of honor. Um the taxi driver said to me\nwell where are your flowers, this is Shabbas this is the Sabbath. Where are you\nwhere are your flowers, where is your gift. I don\u2019t have any flowers, I didn\u2019t buy\nany candy, I didn\u2019t buy anything. I just wanted to come. He said well usually on\na Friday night, it is expected that you bring some flowers to your host. Um the\ntaxi driver didn\u2019t know where Abba Eban lived. He knew the general\nneighborhood but didn\u2019t know the exact place. But he stopped some young\npeople on the street and he said to them, I remember very clearly he said well you,\nyou must have made some kind of relationship with these people from Israel.\nAnd I said well we did the best we could. All the florist shops were closed\nbecause it was uh between 4:30 and 5:00. They close early and I\u2019m sorry we, we\nhad nothing to, to give. So the taxi driver uh dropped my wife and me off at the\nhome of these officials from Israel and about 20 minutes later, the doorbell rang.\nAnd the taxi driver stepped out with a big bouquet of flowers and he handed them\nto my wife and he said here when you go back in there you will have a gift. You\nare not supposed to go in there without a gift. You should bring something to\nyour host. And so I asked him how much it would cost and he said there would\nbe absolutely no fee at all. It\u2019s my pleasure to be delivering you to, to have\ndelivered you to the party and to see that as guest of honor you were well\nreceived. And so uh everyone was very excited about the fact that the taxi driver\nbrought in some flowers because it was Friday night and uh he felt we should\nhave known, we should have remembered but it was our first trip to Israel so I did\nnot know. But the taxi driver made sure that all the passages were open after that.",
        "Q: ...growing up in Brooklyn. In terms of being Jewish, were your social contacts\nmixed. Did you have non Jewish friends as well. Or was your community really\na Jewish community?",
        "A: It was not a Jewish community. There were uh a number of Jewish families\nliving in our area, not many. Uh I would say that we were happy together as a\ngroup, playing sports, singing and music, being in school, um doing the kinds of\nthings that kids do in a. in a neighborhood school. I was lucky in being the\nchance to go to Boys High School in Brooklyn, kind of a well known school. Um\nwith lots of um talented people running the school and I was very delighted to be\na student at Boys High School.",
        "Q: So your milieu was mixed, it was Jewish and non Jewish.\nA; It was, that is correct. The neighborhood was Jewish and non Jewish. My friends\nwere Jewish and non Jewish and I can\u2019t count them and say I had 11 friends this\nday and I had 14 friends for the next 3 weeks. That didn\u2019t happen. Uh you\n2\n3\nworked with the young people whom you liked and uh it was your choice. And\num it seemed to work both ways that the non Jewish people were looking at us in\nthat neighborhood as newcomers to that neighborhood and everything was in\ngood shape. There was no trouble. We had no feelings whatsoever in that regard.\nWe had normal religious training, we had normal religious output in attending\nservices, in doing the things generally are expected of, of boys and girls age 13\nand above. My father and mother saw to that. And uh it was, it was a joyous\nthing.",
        "Q: And no feeling of being different because you were Jewish or anti-Semitism or\nanything like that?",
        "A: No feeling of that sort whatsoever, the, the sports were mixed with the religion.\nThe sports were mixed with school. The sports were mixed with music. The\nports were mixed with whatever activity was going on in, among our small group\nand for that reason I think we got along very well.",
        "Q: Were sports an opportunity for everybody to be together and get to know each\nother?",
        "A: It is, it 1s an opportunity. Sports is a way in which you can get to know each\nother, in which you can um be happy together, be distressed together when nec,\nwhen it happens. To understand more about the Catholic religion, the Protestant\nreligion in the neighborhood which serves its clientele and it was our\nresponsibility, my mother and father taught us to be together and uh it was, it was\na fine, it was a fine way to do it and my father had a hardware store and in the\nhardware store everyone needs nails and screws, hammers, lawn mowers, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter what religion you are, if you need a tool, you need a tool and so I\nlearned a lot about the exchange of information, exchange of equipment tools, um\nhow to make keys, how to fix locks, um |-o-c-k-s. How to prepare uh door\nchecks, how to prepare things that needed repair that my father had taken in for\nrepair and I was taught how to participate un that.",
        "Q: So it sounds like to me that you were an all American boy. You weren\u2019t\nnecessarily just from a Jewish community. I mean your identification was just...",
        "A: Absolutely. I\u2019ve oh I\u2019ve never felt either on one side of the street or the other side\nof the street, or with one collect, connection or another connection. I felt that we\nwere together, our group was together and we had a lot to enjoy together. And it\ndid occur. Many of the young people in, in my neighborhood were admitted as\nstudents at Boys High School, which was I have to say it, a very elite tough\nschool where you had to work very, very hard to remain to succeed and to get\nready for college.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your sports activity, what you liked, how good were you.\n3\n4",
        "A: Uh in my younger years there was no such thing as a little league baseball or Babe\nRuth league baseball. Uh fourteen managers and 26 assistant managers uh and\nsomebody in charge of the Pepsi cola and someone in charge of, of something\nelse. There, there wasn\u2019t that kind of uh relationship that uh the grouping was,\nwas not hard and in that way um my parents were aware of and permitted my\nparticipation in sports so I had to balance out the hours I spent in sports with the\nhours I gave to sports. And um it was uh a good way I think for me to learn um\nimportance of earning a living how different ways exist for earning a living. And\nuh participating in certain projects regardless of what background you come from\nreligiously.",
        "Q: What sports did you like? how did you get started?",
        "A: Uh well one way in which you get started I guess is by having things close to\nhand. My father had a hardware store but it also had a sporting goods branch to it\nand so I was allowed to go pick out a pair of ice skates. I was allowed to pick out\na pair of roller skates. I was allowed to pick out a brand new basketball and go\nwith a team to a certain neighborhood to play. I was allowed to uh pick for\nmyself and my Dad sold many of those sporting good items but it wasn\u2019t pushing\nme into sports in order to sell a few more gloves, a few more bats, a few more\nballs, not at all. And my Dad liked them very much too and that\u2019s why it was\nsuch a surprise to me when I played baseball in the Canadian American league,\nprofessional baseball on opening day when um the team I was playing with the\nRome Colonels, Rome New York Colonels, um frankly uh had a, an opportunity\nthat no one really ever gets automatically. And that was my father coming\nsecretly and I don\u2019t mean secretly in a secret, secretive sense but in a personnel\nsense. He got on a train and he came up to Rome, New York, didn\u2019t let me know,\nstood behind the dugout watched the belgium between Ottowa and the Rome\nColonels, watched his son play. After the game was over had dinner with his son,\nand a couple of his son\u2019s friends from the team and after dinner he got back on the\ntrain and went back to Brooklyn to his hardware store. Kind of a homey sequence\nbut that\u2019s what he did. And uh most of...",
        "Q: Followed your career.",
        "A: That, that started it yes. And as a handball player, tennis player, um I never had\ngolf clubs, we never had that kind of money to fill out all the sporting goods that\nexist. But that was one, that was one way to do it and the competition that came\nfrom sports relationship angles uh was very important kind of experience for me.\nBecause I, I learned to live with the competition, to lose when I had to lose\nwithout crying about it. To win when I could win with joyousness and to share\nwith my teammates other, other kinds of experiences. The last thing I would say\nin this regard is that that may have been the reason why when Little League did\nstart in Rochester, New York I started it. And got the teams together uh got the,\nthe parents together, got it, got it started and then we went off to high school. I\n4\n5\nplayed catcher for Boys High School and then catcher for Brooklyn College. I\nwas on Brooklyn College when I was selected for the Olympic team. Um.",
        "Q: ...how you really got into baseball, did you love it, how good were you?",
        "A: Well I was it was not a great competitor. I was a good competitor. I was fair. I\nworked hard at it. I had all the moves necessary. I was a catcher very early and\nbeing a catcher eliminates a lot of people from vying for that role. How to hold\nyour hand, how to make sure that the fingers are in such a position that when you,\nwhen you went to the minor leagues you didn\u2019t get whacked and have your\nfingers broken there or in Germany. And so it was an attempt to be able to scoop\nthe ball, learn how to scoop it without injuring your fingers and that took some\ndoing. Um so my sports really came from high school from being a catcher at\nBrooklyn College from which I went to the Olympic tryouts in Baltimore. And\nthe Olympic tryouts were held in 3 places in the United States. In Stanford,\nCalifornia, in western state Michigan College and in the Baltimore area and there\nwere hundreds and hundreds of athletes vying for the spots. There were 21 places\non the Olympic team, 21. And there were maybe 6, 7, 8 hundred athletes vying\nfor that, those 21 spots and I was a catcher selected uh by the coaches for the\nOlympic team from Baltimore, from the east coast tryouts.",
        "Q: You must have been pretty good.",
        "A: Uh I worked hard at it, I worked hard at it. I knew what I was doing and uh\nwanted to be a catcher right from the beginning and catching is so hard and so\ndifficult and uh it, it\u2019s one of the positions in sports where injuries are more likely\nto happen because of the close activity of the batted ball against the swinging bat\nand your fingers don\u2019t always give that much. Um and so I went off to school,\nwent off to Brooklyn College, became an athlete on the Brooklyn college team,\nwent to the Olympic tryouts, was selected for it uh and then had my chance very\nhappily with meeting up with Hank Greenberg, the uh first baseman of the Detroit\ntigers who that year was being shifted from first base to outfield. Uh and I talked\nto him about some things that were going on that I felt needed adjustment and he\ngave prompt attention to what he thinks he, what he thought he could do. And he\ndid some things that were very helpful to teammates and others on the team.",
        "Q: ...g0 back to the Olympics. While you were playing baseball in high school and\nat college, were you ever thinking in terms of Olympics?",
        "A: Never. In the first place you couldn\u2019t hope and dream for something that didn\u2019t\nexist, there were no Olympics in the baseball area, there just weren\u2019t any. It was\ntrack and field where Johnny Woodruff participated, sprinters, jumpers, runners,\nuh long distance athletes uh you can think about it. You can dream about it and\nyou can measure yourself uh side by side with other athletes and begin to think of\nyour own chances and you try for it and you shoot for it and by shooting for it and\n5\n6\nat some of the materials that um may become available to you, you will see that\nuh I worked very, very hard to try to get that.",
        "Q: What you\u2019re saying is that while you were playing baseball in college it hadn\u2019t\noccurred to you that you might be going to the Olympics.",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: ...complete thought.",
        "A: What, what I could say is that the uh thinking about playing in the Olympics as a\nspecific activity compared with uh playing baseball with a semi pro team with a\nneighborhood team, with a college team, far differed and thinking of playing\nbaseball in college, uh and getting a bid to be on the team, all of which were\nhelpful, um and I was lucky to be one of those selected and as I said they came\nfrom Stanford, western state Michigan and the Baltimore area.",
        "Q: Did a coach or somebody at college suggest that you go to these tryouts. How did\nthis come about?",
        "A: Uh the coach at the college uh at which I, I earned a silver medal in baseball when\nI was very young, 16, 17 years of age um kept pushing just said go ahead, keep\ngoing, keep going, keep going, keep going. Uh yes he wanted me to, to keep\ntrying out. Um I gave more energy. I spent more time in practice I worked\nharder with my teammates. And um when I went to Baltimore, there were 2,300\nathletes in the competition. And uh you were tried in all the positions, sliding,\nhitting um throwing. Uh doubling, triple activities. Uh all of which I knew\nsomething about...\n(end first tape)\n(Tape 2 of 3)",
        "A: ...for over a month.",
        "Q: How did exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics come about?",
        "A: Are you ready for the answer now. Exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics\nreally started because there was an American committee on baseball that was\npushing very hard for baseball to be introduced and attached to the Olympics.\nThe uh number of baseball players in the world were limited pretty much to\nCentral American teams, to all the American teams of course, South African\nteams uh the kinds of athletes who got started early through films, through\ntelevision and began to play at a very early age. It really got introduced because\n6\n7\nfrankly and I don\u2019t take this as a compliment for myself, because of Herman\nGoldberg who was in charge of developing baseball in the country of Italy.",
        "Q: I want to go back to Berlin.",
        "A: Please.",
        "Q: So the United States Olympic committee decided that they were going to try to\npromote baseball.\nA; They were going to try to promote it.",
        "Q: Who came to this decision?",
        "A: Judge J. L. Hoffman of Cincinnati, Ohio was the one who headed the group that\npushed very hard for baseball to be an Olympic sport. Also the American\nOlympic committee wanted to see baseball in the Olympics. They had seen uh\nski jumping; they had seen all the other sports and they really wanted to see\nbaseball in there and 1t came about because the committee of the various sports,\nfinally agreed that it would be a good thing for American baseball to be on the\ncalendar and as far as I can tell that\u2019s when it started because I began to get mail.\nI began to get the first uh pieces of information about the possibility of a baseball\ntournament being held.",
        "Q: And so it must have been pretty exciting to be in this.",
        "A: It was very exciting because well first of all the stadium was very large. 125,000\npeople watching a baseball series, unheard of, unheard of before. Most of the\nbaseball teams in America, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 maybe but 125,000 who ever\nheard of such a thing. You heard of it in Berlin, Germany for the first time and it\nwas promoted by the small group of 28 baseball players. There were 28 of us\nassigned to play a series of exhibitions against each other and then go out into the\ncountryside and demonstrate baseball to schools, to colleges, to many German\ninstitutions, how it\u2019s played uh what the difference is between baseball and\nsoccer, uh what the rules were. How the umpires played, played the game. Um it\nwas done um because of America and I was very proud to be a part of the group\nthat kept pushing without pushing. We kept encouraging, encouraging,\ndemonstrating. This is how left handed first basemen behave, this 1s how right\nhanded pitchers do this. If you are left handed this is how it\u2019s done. And um we,\nwe put it on the map.",
        "Q: What was the reaction when you were playing these games in Berlin? What was\nthe audience reaction?",
        "A: The audience reaction was very poor, very poor. They didn\u2019t like the game, they\ndidn\u2019t know the game. The diamond, the baseball diamond was never laid out\n7\n8\nlike a diamond. They took a four inch white silky tape and they pressed it into the\ngrass. And they made a, a, a uh diamond out of it for baseball. But they never\nactually made a baseball field, never. It caught hold to some extent, not to such\nextent as in other countries, especially central America. But it became a vivid\nactivity because it came from America. A lot of the kids wanted very much to\nknow more about America and the sports were very important to them too.",
        "Q: But the audience was not excited.",
        "A: The audience was not excited because the pace of baseball much slower than\nsoccer. In soccer the, the ball is moving, moving, moving, moving, moving all\nthe time and the kids are kicking you, and they\u2019re kicking you, they\u2019re kicking\nyou and they\u2019re circling and they\u2019re beating out the other guy whereas in the the\nsports you play hard or you jump hard, you, you run hard. You do all of the\nthings yourself, but in baseball you\u2019re part of a team. And it\u2019s necessary to uh\nunderstand that and uh the crowds on the baseball field were 100,000? not\n125,000",
        "Q: ...the period before you went over to Berlin. How much did you know at that\ntime about what was going on in Nazi Germany?",
        "A: I knew less than I guess I am told I should have known by many people who\nasked me how come you went to Germany when this was going on. The uh\nnumber of Jewish athletes, sort of about 8 or 9 out of 328. Um the number of\nJewish athletes who made the team and then quit 3 or 4 of those. Knowledge\nabout what was going on with Hitler beginning to come more close to us. Um.\nOne of the most telling experiences that I had personally we\u2019d lived in a small\ncottage. Mine happened to be named Brandenbourgh cottage. Because Hitler had\ncharged money to all the dead residents of Brandenburg. To pay for his cottage\nand then they, another group paid for the, their, their named cottage. Another\ngroup paid for this and I can recall very vividly the um concern I had when I went\ndown and I saw a big chain at the basement door of our village. There were 28\nplayers who lived in the Brandenbourg dorf in our village and uh what I saw in\nthe rear of the cottage was a door and another door and then a chain. And I\nopened the chain and I walked, started to walk downstairs in the bottom of a\nbasement. And there was a big cavernous area. I didn\u2019t know what it was for but\nI sure found out. That it was for Panzer tanks, German tanks because what they\ndid was declare the Olympic dorf, and the athlete and the military chiefs were\nhoused where the Olympic athletes were housed after the Olympics were over and\nI was told by a woman who took care of that building. Raus, raus, raus, get out of\nthere. Get out of there, get out of there. She didn\u2019t want me looking down in the\nbasement. I didn\u2019t know what was down there but it turned out that 1t was large\nenough, the cellar or the basement whatever you want to call it, in my, my cottage\nyou, you find these picture material that was brought to the studio today. Uh you\nwill find uh structures that look like resorts but when you walk down there, the\ncavernous, they\u2019re empty. They\u2019re the thick the uh the cement was about 10, 12,\n8\n9\n15 inches thick. And that couldn\u2019t be for just a car or a jeep or a truck.\nSomething big had to be in the basement that had floors this thick. You never\nsaw such thick floors and uh it turned out that that became the west point of\nGermany",
        "Q: At what point did you realize this was what it was?",
        "A: I realized what it was after I was in Germany and after I had seen enough of the\nactivity that led to uh the early movement of labor camp people into army men\nand from boy scouts into young soldiers and from ordinary men uh with ordinary\ncredentials, carrying shovels, dressed in regular clothes but carrying shovels ready\nto clean out as soon as the American athletes left, ready to clean out what they\ncould from there to get it ready for the army.",
        "Q: So you saw this as you were departing?",
        "A: I saw this about half way there. I would say about 4 weeks, 4 weeks before we\nleft. I saw it and they were very strict very angry because I, I was the only one\nwho went down to the basement and it was just a happenchance walking down a\nflight of stairs, we were moving a chain and being yelled at by the German\nhausfrau and house man who didn\u2019t like what they saw. I mean American down\nin their property, that was going to become a Panzer tank unit as soon as the\ngames were over.",
        "Q: You stayed in Germany for how long after the Olympics?",
        "A: Um, about 2 weeks.",
        "Q: So I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m a little confused. When you say you saw people coming in\nwith shovels getting ready to transform the Olympic village. This was while you\nwere there for the Olympics?",
        "A: Yes and the materials that we found by our beds, they were very large books\nmarked Berlin. Just the name Berlin on the outside and in that book were pictures\nof men marching in parade but they weren\u2019t equipped with Army uniforms, they\nwere equipped with regular clothes, with work clothes, with uh seemingly baskets\nand then shovels on the shoulder and they were walking this way, this way, this\nway through the whole area there and uh what we found out was that they were\nnot only being prepared for their part in the Olympics, but some were ready on,\non the grounds. Ready to be instructed in how to go ahead and um fill in the\ntanks that were going on.",
        "Q: You said there were books that would say Berlin. Or boxes.",
        "A: There were boxes of books. Very, very large books.\n9\n10",
        "Q: With photographs of the...",
        "A: Yes, on the outside it just said Berlin, one word, that\u2019s all and you turned pages\nand you saw pictures of the army and you turned more, there\u2019s one on\neverybody\u2019s bed, propaganda material and it was, it was on everybody\u2019s bed and\nnobody gave them up because you, you were intrigued, and you were reading\nthem, what is this all about. So I began to learn more about Hitler and Goebbels\nand some of the others after I turned pages. And uh I noticed that the um\nOlympics were for other purposes than storage.",
        "Q: How odd this is that they would leave this for you to see.",
        "A: How what?",
        "Q: Odd this is.",
        "A: How odd? Well I, I would say it would be stupid first, odd yes. Uh. An open\ndoor down to a basement that had no use other than for storage of large tanks and\nmaterials. Uh that\u2019s of war.",
        "Q: So before you went to Berlin, you didn\u2019t know too much about Nazi Germany\u2019?",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Now there was some movement in the United States um in regard, regard the\nboycott, were you aware of that?",
        "A: I was aware of some of the activities that were going on throughout the United\nStates in different parts, there were programs which uh um displayed the feeling\nabout uh Germany, what was happening, what was going on. Hitler\u2019s preparation\num the uh um activity going on in the in the field, in the manufacturing areas, the\nbuilding the construction, all of those things were, were apparently going on.\nAlso uh the American athletes and all other country had its athletes separated by\naction and by that I mean by what, summer sports, winter sports, differing kinds\nof activities trying to separate them and you could see that uh if you opened the\ndoors to look into places and the house man and the house frau caught you, you\u2019d\nget yelled at but they didn\u2019t do anything. They didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody and\nthey didn\u2019t want to give away their, some of their secrets about their, their non\nrelations with the United States. Um that\u2019s one of the one of the I, I think first,\nfirst time he ought to be aware of what 1s surface, the surface on, on a cottage\ngame. And uh if he has another chat we should have the chat, we should have the\nchat, we should not be afraid to have someone here telling us how he or she feels\nabout what\u2019s going on. It may not get it all so smoothly. You may or you may\nand you have to work it out to find out what, what is going on that is happening\nwith the Olympics that you are part of it, you\u2019re really not part of because\nsomebody else is running it now and you\u2019re someone else in a cotton uniform\n10\n11\nready to run uh for the next period of 3 or 4 weeks. I, I\u2019m not sure what else I can\nsay on that particular topic. I may have, I may have messed it up.",
        "Q: ...a sense of before you went to Berlin. Excuse me one minute...boycott in the\nUnited States, were you aware of it?",
        "A: Uh yes I was somewhat aware. The press gave some space to the problems in\nGermany not full space. Not full uh description of what might be going on\nunderneath the table uh. It wasn\u2019t that kind of a, a fullness of expression. But\nthere was enough information coming because Hitler was beginning to, to make\ndemands which were so great and impossible that you, you had to have a feeling\nthat you were into something that was going to be very, very rough.",
        "Q: Was there talk about a boycott, about not going to the games?",
        "A: There was some talk about it, yes there was and, and a lot of the talk was directed\nat the president of the American Olympic committee, who I think gave very little\npreliminary credence to it. But he wanted to see what was happening and he as an\nold time pole vaulter from Yale University and the head of the American\nOlympic committee behaved in such a way that um 8 or 9 of us who were Jewish\nwere, were not in the games. I was there because I was working with a\ndemonstration group, not a competitive group at that time. We were striving to\nteach enough skills so that they would say next time around, we want a baseball\nteam, we want a baseball team and didn\u2019t happen that way.\nQW: So you were allowed to play in Berlin because you were in a non-competitive\nsport?",
        "A: I think that would be one reason that the American Olympic committee chairman\nuh Norman Armitage uh did not have any feeling against me or against Jews that\nhe was visibly going to show.",
        "Q: Did you think before going to Berlin as a Jew that maybe you shouldn\u2019t go?",
        "A: Not for one minute, absolutely not one minute. I talked with a number of the\nsports leaders in our local area in Brooklyn, New York. I talked with the coaches\nat Boys high school and uh I told them what the goals were and I was not\ndiscouraged. I was not encouraged. I was just say well, here\u2019s your chance to\nlearn something and I did not speak German but I uh began to use some of the\nGerman that I knew in some of the discussions. Now the Olympic village was\nabout 12 miles from the city of Berlin. Marty Glickman and I were headed for\ndowntown Berlin from the village town to downtown. Um we were interested in\ntwo things, one uh a boxing match that was going to take place that day and some\nother events about uh kids who uh were in difficulty but uh were good athletes.\nNow in the first instance that I mentioned uh the bus we had missed and there was\na bus that ran every 30 minutes from the Olympic village to downtown Berlin. If\n11\n12\nyou miss the bus you are out of luck for the next 30 minutes. And so Marty and I\nwere headed for downtown Berlin and we did not make it. We were late and so\nwe went out on the highway and we put up our thumb to get a ride, dressed in the\nAmerican Olympic uniform, we had no trouble being picked up. We were picked\nup by Germany um athletes in uniform, German army men actually, in uniform\nwith a sidecar, a motorcycle with a sidecar and Marty and I got in the sidecar and\nhe drove us we were almost through with the 12 miles. And I asked the question,\nI asked the driver of Boxinyaki Vilsen from Veronica Staaten, from North\nAmerica right. Is Jackie Wilson from the United States of America going to be\nboxing tonight. Yako Wilson from the United States going to be boxing tonight.\nHuite, Heinte, I use the word Heinte, the Jewish word for tonight. Instead of\nHoyte which is the German word for tonight. If I wanted to know are all of you\ngoing to the movies tonight, hoyte, are you all going tonight. So I didn\u2019t say it the\nright way.\n(end second tape)\n(Tape 3 of 3)",
        "Q: From the Olympic village did you ever travel around or go into Berlin and have\nany unusual experiences?",
        "A: Yes, there were opportunities to go from the Olympic village into the city of\nBerlin uh every 30 minutes. It was a special bus arranged for the athletes from\ndifferent countries. I can recall one event when Marty Glickman a friend of mine\nfrom Syracuse University had an opportunity to go downtown together and we\nwent on, we went out on the road ready to thumb a ride into, into the town and uh\nit the way it worked out was that a German jeep uh or a, or a with sidecar came by\nand saw our thumbs out waiting for a ride and so they stopped and they invited us\nin. We went in, into their vehicle and we moved along very rapidly and at one\npoint in the ride, the German driver said to us um can I see your uh passport.\nYour (autograph?) And he said to me can I see your autograph also in German.\nAnd uh we had them with us but we didn\u2019t think it was their right to have them\nand so I went beyond that and I said um, uh tell me did will Yaquie Wilson from\nVeronichastaten from North America be boxen heint, I was really speaking\nYiddish, the word heint meaning tonight and instead of saying hoyte which is\ntonight in German, I said heinte and so that aroused their concern somewhat and\num they asked us to stay over on the side of the highway. They talked to us a\nlittle bit, much of which we couldn\u2019t understand but they asked for our autographs\nin spite of the fact that they were saying to themselves, these are two Jewish\nathletes. We were dressed in uniforms so they knew what, what we were doing\nthere. Uh the uh opportunity for knowledge of other country would be helpful to\nthem so they asked us for our autographs but being stopped on the road, driving\nalong with him and then being stopped to be asked uh what, what your autograph,\nwhat your number was and then linking that to uh, a request for an autograph was\nunusual, that did happen yes. And it was frightening.\n12\n13",
        "Q: I going into Berlin did you notice any signs of Nazi Germany and anti-Semitism?",
        "A: There were, there were beginning signs going up, there were workmen, some men\nsome women in ladders climbing 3,4,5 step ladders, taking down signs, putting up\nsigns uh identifying where they did not want you to be where you were forbidden\nto go. Uh we saw those quite often.",
        "Q: Cause a Jew.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: What did the sign say?",
        "A: Juden verboten, Jews forbidden to, to ride on this, on this road. Um.",
        "Q: I think I need you to restate this...say a complete...did you see indications of the\nanti-Semitism when you went into Berlin?",
        "A: Yes there, there were some.",
        "Q: There were what?",
        "A: There were two situations which were very frightening. Marty Glickman and I\nwere uh on the highway we had just.",
        "Q: ...the signs.",
        "A: We were in the, in the, in the bus and uh we were um asked for our autographs.\nWe wondered why and they were beginning to understand when they said, when\nthey saw my autograph, Herman Goldberg, yiddishman, a Jewish man that it was\nsomething that they should have been more cautious about. At least they were\nvery scary to us at the beginning and we did our very best to steer clear of them\nand we walked the last mile or 2 into, into town and I, I went to where I wanted to\ngo to the uh music hall to hear the, the opera Die Fleidermaus and Marty went to\nsome event that I can\u2019t recall what he went for.",
        "Q: In Berlin itself were there signs of the Nazi regime?",
        "A: Uh no there were, they were not, they were being very careful to uh keep those\nhidden from direct public view. There were uh some evidences where um news\npeople news syndicated people, syndicate people wanted to see if there were\ntroubles going on between Germany and the United States because of the\nexistence of Hebrews on the American team. And uh it was clear to us that they\nwanted those signs down and so there were some ladders maybe 4 to 6 feet tall\nthat I noticed very carefully and there were men and women on that ladder corps.\n13\n14\nUh directing whether or not those people were going to stay on that uh were going\nto move away from it. Uh. There was no smooth sailing. It was dreadful to think\nof what might be coming ahead. You couldn\u2019t quite tell everything. Um the\npreparations for athletic events, the preparation for musical events, et cetera were\nall things that were good things and you couldn\u2019t tell immediately that there uh\nanxiety over seeing what they could do to Americans could be completed.",
        "Q: Did you have any other experiences where you were alarmed or felt that there was\ndanger or that this anti-Semitism was rampant?",
        "A: Yes, there was one series of events where I felt that the uh some news syndicates\nin America who were very anxious to get evidence that things were not going well\nfor American athletes and that they would like to have me and then perhaps others\nspread the story through their syndicated news service, spread the word that uh\nthings were not going to be good for American athletes of Jewish background.\nUm the, the possibility of manufacturing such events when they really didn\u2019t\nexist, was presented by one person from an American news syndicate. It was a\nkind of situation where um my, my greatest hope would have been the ability to\njust knock them out on the floor uh and get them off the boat. He followed the\nboat out into the river and then met the boat 80 miles from New York checking on\nwhere could he get where could he dig a good story.",
        "Q: But there was no foundation for this.",
        "A: But there was no foundation for that, that\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Speaking of the boat ride over, what was that like? was it exciting?",
        "A: It was very exciting.",
        "Q: Say the boat ride over.",
        "A: Yes, the, the boat ride over was very exciting. People were thinking about um\nEleanor Holmes Jarrett, wondering about the allegations that she was drinking,\nusing alcohol, using tobacco, there were statements having to do with I think a\nreduction in the credibility of some of the American athletes was rampant. And\nuh it got cleared up I think after the thing was laid out on the table and was\nforcefully presented.\nQW: What was special about this boat ride over? What was happening?",
        "A: What was happening was the athletes were not sitting around, they were in\ntraining. I was surprised. Jesse Owens, Marty Glickman uh Marty Stoller a\nwhole bunch of athletes, running, jumping.\n14\n15",
        "Q: I need you to say that over because you said Marty Stoller instead of Sam Stoller.\nSo what was going on on the boat?",
        "A: Uh there was a great deal of activity going on, on the boat. They were practicing\nin their events. They were movement, there was, there was nobody sitting around\nreading a book. Uh they were trying hard to keep their weight down. They\nworked very hard in every aspect of uh self care. And it was important because\nthese athletes needed to have that great uh spirit, the great ability, the great uh uh\nbodily condition in which to participate and I think the Americans had it.",
        "Q: Was this an exciting opportunity for you?",
        "A: It was an exciting opportunity for me for the first reason, Mickey Cochrane was\naboard ship and one wondered why would the manager of the Detroit Tigers be\non board ship. Well uh all the um anxiety about it ended for me when I got word\nthat I was picked up by the Detroit Tigers to become a member of the Detroit\nTigers as, baseball team and to become a member of that a rookie staff and then to\nplay with that team. And to play with Buffalo in the International League. Uh\nthey were all very excited to have major league managers talk to you and who\nknows how much they were watching and what notes they were taking, who\nknows. I don\u2019t know. But at any rate it was a great feeling that um having\nimportant people on board ship was present and they were taking um plenty of\ntime to talk to athletes and to be with them and to try to assess what they were\nreally like and uh I was lucky. I happened to hook on well with the Detroit\nTigers.",
        "Q: The games themselves, what was it like being there?",
        "A: It was thrilling in so many ways because you looked out on the playing field and\nyou saw room for 125,000 people. Not every event drew 125,000 people. Some\ndrew fewer numbers than that but however it was a very exciting thing to see that\nsize crowd. Also to see a group playing a game that they weren\u2019t used to. The\nfoul lines were white ribbons four inches wide and they didn\u2019t put plaster of paris\nor yellow uh white dirt down on the field.",
        "Q: ...move on...the atmosphere, the general ambience.",
        "A: In the stands where I sat next to Marty Glickman for several weeks while events\nwere going on there were some things happening that uh gave you some more\nidea of what was going on. Hitler did not stay in the visible area of his private\nbalcony when a German athlete won an event. When a German athlete won an\nevent he walked out on his little balcony. He raised his hand. There as a lot of\napplause and then uh he went back in. When a black athlete perhaps Jewish\nathletes too, there were very few of us. I couldn\u2019t count, there wasn\u2019t time to\ncount uh the Jewish athletes and the black athletes especially caused Hitler to turn\naround and to walk out of his own private balcony. In other words he did not\n15\n16\nwant to be seen praising a black athlete even in his own track and field area. He\njust didn\u2019t want to be seen.",
        "Q: So what you\u2019re saying 1s, explain this to me once more. You could see Hitler\nfrom where you were sitting?",
        "A: From where I could see Hitler. I could see Hitler every single day. I could see\nhim every day because his travels were mainly going from inside the balcony,\noutside. Some applause for the German athlete. His hand down when a black\nathlete won an event and his reverse and his walking out of his balcony when\nsome the country became the winner of an event. He did not demonstrate the uh\nreal feelings of uh Olympic history, Olympic meaning, Olympic strength. He did\nnot demonstrate that at all. It was only what he could gain out of his own team\u2019s\nparticipation.",
        "Q: And so he didn\u2019t even salute other white athletes basically just his own?",
        "A: He did not salute white athletes, he stayed away from any opportunity to applaud\nan athlete who won an event who came from a country that he didn\u2019t like perhaps.\nI can\u2019t describe it another way but it, I would say it would be accurate to say that\nuh he removed himself from his own private balcony as often as he wanted to, to\ndemonstrate his own feeling and uh that\u2019s what I saw all the time. Marty and I\nwere very close to the balcony where, Hitler\u2019s balcony were not far away. We\ncould see that happening, his walking back and forth.",
        "Q: What was it like seeing Hitler up close like that?",
        "A: Uh I was no more than five feet away from him in the swimming meets. I went to\nthe swimming meets and I learned that Hitler went to many of the events without\nprior notice. For example wrestling. Swimming. Uh the kinds of events that\ndidn\u2019t draw big crowds and without prior notice. In other words he didn\u2019t tell all\non the phone the committee connected with a particular event. He would just\narrive there I his car, get out, follow his entourage, get up in the stands, sit there\nfor 3, 4, 5 minutes, get out, go to the next one. That we saw very often. Um there\nwas nothing that I can report that indicates that some one in charge of an athletic\nevent of such great importance would behave that way. I could, I could sense it\nyes.",
        "Q: Was there something frightening about him? Something awesome about him?",
        "A: Yes because.",
        "Q: I need you to say the whole thought.",
        "A: Yes, I, I think there was some frightening um characteristics of that type of\nbehavior because it was evident that he did not wish to demonstrate fairness to uh\n16\n17\nathletes from several different countries. Uh he avoided the opportunity to be\neven handed as often as possible which is one of the, one of the credos of the\nOlympiad to, to be fair to all the countries of the world.",
        "Q: Was there anything just viscerally significant about his presence?\nAs: \u2014 Uh, walking out onto the field, he did that at the beginning.",
        "Q: Please say that again.",
        "A: When Hitler was walking out onto the field and that happened several times, it\nwas very, very difficult to understand uh how he could possibly behave one way\nin the stands, another on the field, another way to the press. Another way to\nperhaps his own political leadership. It was very difficult to understand that\nbecause um the uh work of the Olympiad is entirely different than, than being\nangry at other people. It\u2019s being friendly, it\u2019s being togetherness, trying to work\ntogether, trying to understand each other from different parts of the world.",
        "Q: Did he have a commanding presence?",
        "A: What is it?",
        "Q: Did he have, did Hitler have a commanding presence?",
        "A: Hitler had a very commanding presence. Never strong enough to present it solo\nbut always second or third line with other protective units around him all the time.\nNever, never walking into a situation by himself but at least Goebbels and many\nof the others, 10, 12 people surrounding, walking uh in a way that would, would\ngive you a fright.",
        "Q: And the audience went wild for him. What happened?",
        "A: When he entered the stadium, when Hitler entered the stadium there was great\napplause. There was tremendous attempt for his own citizens, his, his German\nparticipants, his German spectators to applaud uh the, his, his presence yes that\u2019s\ntrue and they felt that he was the producer of this grand spectacle, this grand\nspectacle to make it possible for the rest of the world to be waiting and watching\nuh what was going on in Hitler, in Germany at this place.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you a question again about your role over there because I know\nthat in Berlin you played exhibition games and after that you did what?",
        "A: After we played an exhibition game, we would assign a series of locations where\nthe 28 of us on the Olympic baseball team were divided into squads and working\nwith local uh physical education teachers and leaders uh to teach baseball to\nclubs, to teams, to, not to fight them against their great desire to play soccer but to\n17\n18\nteach them that there was another sport and that the rest of the world was waiting\nfor them to come into baseball.",
        "Q: Did you play exhibition games in these locations?",
        "A: We played exhibition games throughout Germany yes.",
        "Q: Did you ever experience any anti Jewish sentiment while you were doing this?",
        "A: None whatsoever on my, my part, none on my part. The only anti-Semitic feeling\nthat I had slight touch for had to do with the um the newspaper syndicated people\nwho wanted to meet a manufacturer\u2019s story.",

But he stopped some young\npeople on the street and he said to them, I remember very clearly he said well you,\nyou must have made some kind of relationship with these people from Israel.\nAnd I said well we did the best we could. All the florist shops were closed\nbecause it was uh between 4:30 and 5:00. They close early and I\u2019m sorry we, we\nhad nothing to, to give. So the taxi driver uh dropped my wife and me off at the\nhome of these officials from Israel and about 20 minutes later, the doorbell rang.\nAnd the taxi driver stepped out with a big bouquet of flowers and he handed them\nto my wife and he said here when you go back in there you will have a gift. You\nare not supposed to go in there without a gift. You should bring something to\nyour host. And so I asked him how much it would cost and he said there would\nbe absolutely no fee at all. It\u2019s my pleasure to be delivering you to, to have\ndelivered you to the party and to see that as guest of honor you were well\nreceived. And so uh everyone was very excited about the fact that the taxi driver\nbrought in some flowers because it was Friday night and uh he felt we should\nhave known, we should have remembered but it was our first trip to Israel so I did\nnot know. But the taxi driver made sure that all the passages were open after that.",
        "A: It was not a Jewish community. There were uh a number of Jewish families\nliving in our area, not many. Uh I would say that we were happy together as a\ngroup, playing sports, singing and music, being in school, um doing the kinds of\nthings that kids do in a. in a neighborhood school. I was lucky in being the\nchance to go to Boys High School in Brooklyn, kind of a well known school. Um\nwith lots of um talented people running the school and I was very delighted to be\na student at Boys High School.\nA; It was, that is correct. The neighborhood was Jewish and non Jewish. My friends\nwere Jewish and non Jewish and I can\u2019t count them and say I had 11 friends this\nday and I had 14 friends for the next 3 weeks. That didn\u2019t happen. Uh you\n2\n3\nworked with the young people whom you liked and uh it was your choice. And\num it seemed to work both ways that the non Jewish people were looking at us in\nthat neighborhood as newcomers to that neighborhood and everything was in\ngood shape. There was no trouble. We had no feelings whatsoever in that regard.\nWe had normal religious training, we had normal religious output in attending\nservices, in doing the things generally are expected of, of boys and girls age 13\nand above. My father and mother saw to that. And uh it was, it was a joyous\nthing.",
        "A: No feeling of that sort whatsoever, the, the sports were mixed with the religion.\nThe sports were mixed with school. The sports were mixed with music. The\nports were mixed with whatever activity was going on in, among our small group\nand for that reason I think we got along very well.",
        "A: It is, it 1s an opportunity. Sports is a way in which you can get to know each\nother, in which you can um be happy together, be distressed together when nec,\nwhen it happens. To understand more about the Catholic religion, the Protestant\nreligion in the neighborhood which serves its clientele and it was our\nresponsibility, my mother and father taught us to be together and uh it was, it was\na fine, it was a fine way to do it and my father had a hardware store and in the\nhardware store everyone needs nails and screws, hammers, lawn mowers, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter what religion you are, if you need a tool, you need a tool and so I\nlearned a lot about the exchange of information, exchange of equipment tools, um\nhow to make keys, how to fix locks, um |-o-c-k-s. How to prepare uh door\nchecks, how to prepare things that needed repair that my father had taken in for\nrepair and I was taught how to participate un that.",
        "A: Absolutely. I\u2019ve oh I\u2019ve never felt either on one side of the street or the other side\nof the street, or with one collect, connection or another connection. I felt that we\nwere together, our group was together and we had a lot to enjoy together. And it\ndid occur. Many of the young people in, in my neighborhood were admitted as\nstudents at Boys High School, which was I have to say it, a very elite tough\nschool where you had to work very, very hard to remain to succeed and to get\nready for college.\n3\n4",
        "A: Uh in my younger years there was no such thing as a little league baseball or Babe\nRuth league baseball. Uh fourteen managers and 26 assistant managers uh and\nsomebody in charge of the Pepsi cola and someone in charge of, of something\nelse. There, there wasn\u2019t that kind of uh relationship that uh the grouping was,\nwas not hard and in that way um my parents were aware of and permitted my\nparticipation in sports so I had to balance out the hours I spent in sports with the\nhours I gave to sports. And um it was uh a good way I think for me to learn um\nimportance of earning a living how different ways exist for earning a living. And\nuh participating in certain projects regardless of what background you come from\nreligiously.",
        "A: Uh well one way in which you get started I guess is by having things close to\nhand. My father had a hardware store but it also had a sporting goods branch to it\nand so I was allowed to go pick out a pair of ice skates. I was allowed to pick out\na pair of roller skates. I was allowed to pick out a brand new basketball and go\nwith a team to a certain neighborhood to play. I was allowed to uh pick for\nmyself and my Dad sold many of those sporting good items but it wasn\u2019t pushing\nme into sports in order to sell a few more gloves, a few more bats, a few more\nballs, not at all. And my Dad liked them very much too and that\u2019s why it was\nsuch a surprise to me when I played baseball in the Canadian American league,\nprofessional baseball on opening day when um the team I was playing with the\nRome Colonels, Rome New York Colonels, um frankly uh had a, an opportunity\nthat no one really ever gets automatically. And that was my father coming\nsecretly and I don\u2019t mean secretly in a secret, secretive sense but in a personnel\nsense. He got on a train and he came up to Rome, New York, didn\u2019t let me know,\nstood behind the dugout watched the belgium between Ottowa and the Rome\nColonels, watched his son play. After the game was over had dinner with his son,\nand a couple of his son\u2019s friends from the team and after dinner he got back on the\ntrain and went back to Brooklyn to his hardware store. Kind of a homey sequence\nbut that\u2019s what he did. And uh most of...",
        "A: That, that started it yes. And as a handball player, tennis player, um I never had\ngolf clubs, we never had that kind of money to fill out all the sporting goods that\nexist. But that was one, that was one way to do it and the competition that came\nfrom sports relationship angles uh was very important kind of experience for me.\nBecause I, I learned to live with the competition, to lose when I had to lose\nwithout crying about it. To win when I could win with joyousness and to share\nwith my teammates other, other kinds of experiences. The last thing I would say\nin this regard is that that may have been the reason why when Little League did\nstart in Rochester, New York I started it. And got the teams together uh got the,\nthe parents together, got it, got it started and then we went off to high school. I\n4\n5\nplayed catcher for Boys High School and then catcher for Brooklyn College. I\nwas on Brooklyn College when I was selected for the Olympic team. Um.",
        "A: Well I was it was not a great competitor. I was a good competitor. I was fair. I\nworked hard at it. I had all the moves necessary. I was a catcher very early and\nbeing a catcher eliminates a lot of people from vying for that role. How to hold\nyour hand, how to make sure that the fingers are in such a position that when you,\nwhen you went to the minor leagues you didn\u2019t get whacked and have your\nfingers broken there or in Germany. And so it was an attempt to be able to scoop\nthe ball, learn how to scoop it without injuring your fingers and that took some\ndoing. Um so my sports really came from high school from being a catcher at\nBrooklyn College from which I went to the Olympic tryouts in Baltimore. And\nthe Olympic tryouts were held in 3 places in the United States. In Stanford,\nCalifornia, in western state Michigan College and in the Baltimore area and there\nwere hundreds and hundreds of athletes vying for the spots. There were 21 places\non the Olympic team, 21. And there were maybe 6, 7, 8 hundred athletes vying\nfor that, those 21 spots and I was a catcher selected uh by the coaches for the\nOlympic team from Baltimore, from the east coast tryouts.",
        "A: Uh I worked hard at it, I worked hard at it. I knew what I was doing and uh\nwanted to be a catcher right from the beginning and catching is so hard and so\ndifficult and uh it, it\u2019s one of the positions in sports where injuries are more likely\nto happen because of the close activity of the batted ball against the swinging bat\nand your fingers don\u2019t always give that much. Um and so I went off to school,\nwent off to Brooklyn College, became an athlete on the Brooklyn college team,\nwent to the Olympic tryouts, was selected for it uh and then had my chance very\nhappily with meeting up with Hank Greenberg, the uh first baseman of the Detroit\ntigers who that year was being shifted from first base to outfield. Uh and I talked\nto him about some things that were going on that I felt needed adjustment and he\ngave prompt attention to what he thinks he, what he thought he could do. And he\ndid some things that were very helpful to teammates and others on the team.",
        "A: Never. In the first place you couldn\u2019t hope and dream for something that didn\u2019t\nexist, there were no Olympics in the baseball area, there just weren\u2019t any. It was\ntrack and field where Johnny Woodruff participated, sprinters, jumpers, runners,\nuh long distance athletes uh you can think about it. You can dream about it and\nyou can measure yourself uh side by side with other athletes and begin to think of\nyour own chances and you try for it and you shoot for it and by shooting for it and\n5\n6\nat some of the materials that um may become available to you, you will see that\nuh I worked very, very hard to try to get that.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: What, what I could say is that the uh thinking about playing in the Olympics as a\nspecific activity compared with uh playing baseball with a semi pro team with a\nneighborhood team, with a college team, far differed and thinking of playing\nbaseball in college, uh and getting a bid to be on the team, all of which were\nhelpful, um and I was lucky to be one of those selected and as I said they came\nfrom Stanford, western state Michigan and the Baltimore area.",
        "A: Uh the coach at the college uh at which I, I earned a silver medal in baseball when\nI was very young, 16, 17 years of age um kept pushing just said go ahead, keep\ngoing, keep going, keep going, keep going. Uh yes he wanted me to, to keep\ntrying out. Um I gave more energy. I spent more time in practice I worked\nharder with my teammates. And um when I went to Baltimore, there were 2,300\nathletes in the competition. And uh you were tried in all the positions, sliding,\nhitting um throwing. Uh doubling, triple activities. Uh all of which I knew\nsomething about...\n(end first tape)\n(Tape 2 of 3)",
        "A: ...for over a month.",
        "A: Are you ready for the answer now. Exhibition baseball in the 1936 Olympics\nreally started because there was an American committee on baseball that was\npushing very hard for baseball to be introduced and attached to the Olympics.\nThe uh number of baseball players in the world were limited pretty much to\nCentral American teams, to all the American teams of course, South African\nteams uh the kinds of athletes who got started early through films, through\ntelevision and began to play at a very early age. It really got introduced because\n6\n7\nfrankly and I don\u2019t take this as a compliment for myself, because of Herman\nGoldberg who was in charge of developing baseball in the country of Italy.",
        "A: Please.\nA; They were going to try to promote it.",
        "A: Judge J. L. Hoffman of Cincinnati, Ohio was the one who headed the group that\npushed very hard for baseball to be an Olympic sport. Also the American\nOlympic committee wanted to see baseball in the Olympics. They had seen uh\nski jumping; they had seen all the other sports and they really wanted to see\nbaseball in there and 1t came about because the committee of the various sports,\nfinally agreed that it would be a good thing for American baseball to be on the\ncalendar and as far as I can tell that\u2019s when it started because I began to get mail.\nI began to get the first uh pieces of information about the possibility of a baseball\ntournament being held.",
        "A: It was very exciting because well first of all the stadium was very large. 125,000\npeople watching a baseball series, unheard of, unheard of before. Most of the\nbaseball teams in America, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 maybe but 125,000 who ever\nheard of such a thing. You heard of it in Berlin, Germany for the first time and it\nwas promoted by the small group of 28 baseball players. There were 28 of us\nassigned to play a series of exhibitions against each other and then go out into the\ncountryside and demonstrate baseball to schools, to colleges, to many German\ninstitutions, how it\u2019s played uh what the difference is between baseball and\nsoccer, uh what the rules were. How the umpires played, played the game. Um it\nwas done um because of America and I was very proud to be a part of the group\nthat kept pushing without pushing. We kept encouraging, encouraging,\ndemonstrating. This is how left handed first basemen behave, this 1s how right\nhanded pitchers do this. If you are left handed this is how it\u2019s done. And um we,\nwe put it on the map.",
        "A: The audience reaction was very poor, very poor. They didn\u2019t like the game, they\ndidn\u2019t know the game. The diamond, the baseball diamond was never laid out\n7\n8\nlike a diamond. They took a four inch white silky tape and they pressed it into the\ngrass. And they made a, a, a uh diamond out of it for baseball. But they never\nactually made a baseball field, never. It caught hold to some extent, not to such\nextent as in other countries, especially central America. But it became a vivid\nactivity because it came from America. A lot of the kids wanted very much to\nknow more about America and the sports were very important to them too.",
        "A: The audience was not excited because the pace of baseball much slower than\nsoccer. In soccer the, the ball is moving, moving, moving, moving, moving all\nthe time and the kids are kicking you, and they\u2019re kicking you, they\u2019re kicking\nyou and they\u2019re circling and they\u2019re beating out the other guy whereas in the the\nsports you play hard or you jump hard, you, you run hard. You do all of the\nthings yourself, but in baseball you\u2019re part of a team. And it\u2019s necessary to uh\nunderstand that and uh the crowds on the baseball field were 100,000? not\n125,000",
        "A: I knew less than I guess I am told I should have known by many people who\nasked me how come you went to Germany when this was going on. The uh\nnumber of Jewish athletes, sort of about 8 or 9 out of 328. Um the number of\nJewish athletes who made the team and then quit 3 or 4 of those. Knowledge\nabout what was going on with Hitler beginning to come more close to us. Um.\nOne of the most telling experiences that I had personally we\u2019d lived in a small\ncottage. Mine happened to be named Brandenbourgh cottage. Because Hitler had\ncharged money to all the dead residents of Brandenburg. To pay for his cottage\nand then they, another group paid for the, their, their named cottage. Another\ngroup paid for this and I can recall very vividly the um concern I had when I went\ndown and I saw a big chain at the basement door of our village. There were 28\nplayers who lived in the Brandenbourg dorf in our village and uh what I saw in\nthe rear of the cottage was a door and another door and then a chain. And I\nopened the chain and I walked, started to walk downstairs in the bottom of a\nbasement. And there was a big cavernous area. I didn\u2019t know what it was for but\nI sure found out. That it was for Panzer tanks, German tanks because what they\ndid was declare the Olympic dorf, and the athlete and the military chiefs were\nhoused where the Olympic athletes were housed after the Olympics were over and\nI was told by a woman who took care of that building. Raus, raus, raus, get out of\nthere. Get out of there, get out of there. She didn\u2019t want me looking down in the\nbasement. I didn\u2019t know what was down there but it turned out that 1t was large\nenough, the cellar or the basement whatever you want to call it, in my, my cottage\nyou, you find these picture material that was brought to the studio today. Uh you\nwill find uh structures that look like resorts but when you walk down there, the\ncavernous, they\u2019re empty. They\u2019re the thick the uh the cement was about 10, 12,\n8\n9\n15 inches thick. And that couldn\u2019t be for just a car or a jeep or a truck.\nSomething big had to be in the basement that had floors this thick. You never\nsaw such thick floors and uh it turned out that that became the west point of\nGermany",
        "A: I realized what it was after I was in Germany and after I had seen enough of the\nactivity that led to uh the early movement of labor camp people into army men\nand from boy scouts into young soldiers and from ordinary men uh with ordinary\ncredentials, carrying shovels, dressed in regular clothes but carrying shovels ready\nto clean out as soon as the American athletes left, ready to clean out what they\ncould from there to get it ready for the army.",
        "A: I saw this about half way there. I would say about 4 weeks, 4 weeks before we\nleft. I saw it and they were very strict very angry because I, I was the only one\nwho went down to the basement and it was just a happenchance walking down a\nflight of stairs, we were moving a chain and being yelled at by the German\nhausfrau and house man who didn\u2019t like what they saw. I mean American down\nin their property, that was going to become a Panzer tank unit as soon as the\ngames were over.",
        "A: Um, about 2 weeks.",
        "A: Yes and the materials that we found by our beds, they were very large books\nmarked Berlin. Just the name Berlin on the outside and in that book were pictures\nof men marching in parade but they weren\u2019t equipped with Army uniforms, they\nwere equipped with regular clothes, with work clothes, with uh seemingly baskets\nand then shovels on the shoulder and they were walking this way, this way, this\nway through the whole area there and uh what we found out was that they were\nnot only being prepared for their part in the Olympics, but some were ready on,\non the grounds. Ready to be instructed in how to go ahead and um fill in the\ntanks that were going on.",
        "A: There were boxes of books. Very, very large books.\n9\n10",
        "A: Yes, on the outside it just said Berlin, one word, that\u2019s all and you turned pages\nand you saw pictures of the army and you turned more, there\u2019s one on\neverybody\u2019s bed, propaganda material and it was, it was on everybody\u2019s bed and\nnobody gave them up because you, you were intrigued, and you were reading\nthem, what is this all about. So I began to learn more about Hitler and Goebbels\nand some of the others after I turned pages. And uh I noticed that the um\nOlympics were for other purposes than storage.",
        "A: How what?",
        "A: How odd? Well I, I would say it would be stupid first, odd yes. Uh. An open\ndoor down to a basement that had no use other than for storage of large tanks and\nmaterials. Uh that\u2019s of war.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: I was aware of some of the activities that were going on throughout the United\nStates in different parts, there were programs which uh um displayed the feeling\nabout uh Germany, what was happening, what was going on. Hitler\u2019s preparation\num the uh um activity going on in the in the field, in the manufacturing areas, the\nbuilding the construction, all of those things were, were apparently going on.\nAlso uh the American athletes and all other country had its athletes separated by\naction and by that I mean by what, summer sports, winter sports, differing kinds\nof activities trying to separate them and you could see that uh if you opened the\ndoors to look into places and the house man and the house frau caught you, you\u2019d\nget yelled at but they didn\u2019t do anything. They didn\u2019t want to hurt anybody and\nthey didn\u2019t want to give away their, some of their secrets about their, their non\nrelations with the United States. Um that\u2019s one of the one of the I, I think first,\nfirst time he ought to be aware of what 1s surface, the surface on, on a cottage\ngame. And uh if he has another chat we should have the chat, we should have the\nchat, we should not be afraid to have someone here telling us how he or she feels\nabout what\u2019s going on. It may not get it all so smoothly. You may or you may\nand you have to work it out to find out what, what is going on that is happening\nwith the Olympics that you are part of it, you\u2019re really not part of because\nsomebody else is running it now and you\u2019re someone else in a cotton uniform\n10\n11\nready to run uh for the next period of 3 or 4 weeks. I, I\u2019m not sure what else I can\nsay on that particular topic. I may have, I may have messed it up.",
        "A: Uh yes I was somewhat aware. The press gave some space to the problems in\nGermany not full space. Not full uh description of what might be going on\nunderneath the table uh. It wasn\u2019t that kind of a, a fullness of expression. But\nthere was enough information coming because Hitler was beginning to, to make\ndemands which were so great and impossible that you, you had to have a feeling\nthat you were into something that was going to be very, very rough.",
        "A: There was some talk about it, yes there was and, and a lot of the talk was directed\nat the president of the American Olympic committee, who I think gave very little\npreliminary credence to it. But he wanted to see what was happening and he as an\nold time pole vaulter from Yale University and the head of the American\nOlympic committee behaved in such a way that um 8 or 9 of us who were Jewish\nwere, were not in the games. I was there because I was working with a\ndemonstration group, not a competitive group at that time. We were striving to\nteach enough skills so that they would say next time around, we want a baseball\nteam, we want a baseball team and didn\u2019t happen that way.\nQW: So you were allowed to play in Berlin because you were in a non-competitive\nsport?",
        "A: I think that would be one reason that the American Olympic committee chairman\nuh Norman Armitage uh did not have any feeling against me or against Jews that\nhe was visibly going to show.",
        "A: Not for one minute, absolutely not one minute. I talked with a number of the\nsports leaders in our local area in Brooklyn, New York. I talked with the coaches\nat Boys high school and uh I told them what the goals were and I was not\ndiscouraged. I was not encouraged. I was just say well, here\u2019s your chance to\nlearn something and I did not speak German but I uh began to use some of the\nGerman that I knew in some of the discussions. Now the Olympic village was\nabout 12 miles from the city of Berlin. Marty Glickman and I were headed for\ndowntown Berlin from the village town to downtown. Um we were interested in\ntwo things, one uh a boxing match that was going to take place that day and some\nother events about uh kids who uh were in difficulty but uh were good athletes.\nNow in the first instance that I mentioned uh the bus we had missed and there was\na bus that ran every 30 minutes from the Olympic village to downtown Berlin. If\n11\n12\nyou miss the bus you are out of luck for the next 30 minutes. And so Marty and I\nwere headed for downtown Berlin and we did not make it. We were late and so\nwe went out on the highway and we put up our thumb to get a ride, dressed in the\nAmerican Olympic uniform, we had no trouble being picked up. We were picked\nup by Germany um athletes in uniform, German army men actually, in uniform\nwith a sidecar, a motorcycle with a sidecar and Marty and I got in the sidecar and\nhe drove us we were almost through with the 12 miles. And I asked the question,\nI asked the driver of Boxinyaki Vilsen from Veronica Staaten, from North\nAmerica right. Is Jackie Wilson from the United States of America going to be\nboxing tonight. Yako Wilson from the United States going to be boxing tonight.\nHuite, Heinte, I use the word Heinte, the Jewish word for tonight. Instead of\nHoyte which is the German word for tonight. If I wanted to know are all of you\ngoing to the movies tonight, hoyte, are you all going tonight. So I didn\u2019t say it the\nright way.\n(end second tape)\n(Tape 3 of 3)",
        "A: Yes, there were opportunities to go from the Olympic village into the city of\nBerlin uh every 30 minutes. It was a special bus arranged for the athletes from\ndifferent countries. I can recall one event when Marty Glickman a friend of mine\nfrom Syracuse University had an opportunity to go downtown together and we\nwent on, we went out on the road ready to thumb a ride into, into the town and uh\nit the way it worked out was that a German jeep uh or a, or a with sidecar came by\nand saw our thumbs out waiting for a ride and so they stopped and they invited us\nin. We went in, into their vehicle and we moved along very rapidly and at one\npoint in the ride, the German driver said to us um can I see your uh passport.\nYour (autograph?) And he said to me can I see your autograph also in German.\nAnd uh we had them with us but we didn\u2019t think it was their right to have them\nand so I went beyond that and I said um, uh tell me did will Yaquie Wilson from\nVeronichastaten from North America be boxen heint, I was really speaking\nYiddish, the word heint meaning tonight and instead of saying hoyte which is\ntonight in German, I said heinte and so that aroused their concern somewhat and\num they asked us to stay over on the side of the highway. They talked to us a\nlittle bit, much of which we couldn\u2019t understand but they asked for our autographs\nin spite of the fact that they were saying to themselves, these are two Jewish\nathletes. We were dressed in uniforms so they knew what, what we were doing\nthere. Uh the uh opportunity for knowledge of other country would be helpful to\nthem so they asked us for our autographs but being stopped on the road, driving\nalong with him and then being stopped to be asked uh what, what your autograph,\nwhat your number was and then linking that to uh, a request for an autograph was\nunusual, that did happen yes. And it was frightening.\n12\n13",
        "A: There were, there were beginning signs going up, there were workmen, some men\nsome women in ladders climbing 3,4,5 step ladders, taking down signs, putting up\nsigns uh identifying where they did not want you to be where you were forbidden\nto go. Uh we saw those quite often.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Juden verboten, Jews forbidden to, to ride on this, on this road. Um.",
        "A: Yes there, there were some.",
        "A: There were two situations which were very frightening. Marty Glickman and I\nwere uh on the highway we had just.",
        "A: We were in the, in the, in the bus and uh we were um asked for our autographs.\nWe wondered why and they were beginning to understand when they said, when\nthey saw my autograph, Herman Goldberg, yiddishman, a Jewish man that it was\nsomething that they should have been more cautious about. At least they were\nvery scary to us at the beginning and we did our very best to steer clear of them\nand we walked the last mile or 2 into, into town and I, I went to where I wanted to\ngo to the uh music hall to hear the, the opera Die Fleidermaus and Marty went to\nsome event that I can\u2019t recall what he went for.",
        "A: Uh no there were, they were not, they were being very careful to uh keep those\nhidden from direct public view. There were uh some evidences where um news\npeople news syndicated people, syndicate people wanted to see if there were\ntroubles going on between Germany and the United States because of the\nexistence of Hebrews on the American team. And uh it was clear to us that they\nwanted those signs down and so there were some ladders maybe 4 to 6 feet tall\nthat I noticed very carefully and there were men and women on that ladder corps.\n13\n14\nUh directing whether or not those people were going to stay on that uh were going\nto move away from it. Uh. There was no smooth sailing. It was dreadful to think\nof what might be coming ahead. You couldn\u2019t quite tell everything. Um the\npreparations for athletic events, the preparation for musical events, et cetera were\nall things that were good things and you couldn\u2019t tell immediately that there uh\nanxiety over seeing what they could do to Americans could be completed.",
        "A: Yes, there was one series of events where I felt that the uh some news syndicates\nin America who were very anxious to get evidence that things were not going well\nfor American athletes and that they would like to have me and then perhaps others\nspread the story through their syndicated news service, spread the word that uh\nthings were not going to be good for American athletes of Jewish background.\nUm the, the possibility of manufacturing such events when they really didn\u2019t\nexist, was presented by one person from an American news syndicate. It was a\nkind of situation where um my, my greatest hope would have been the ability to\njust knock them out on the floor uh and get them off the boat. He followed the\nboat out into the river and then met the boat 80 miles from New York checking on\nwhere could he get where could he dig a good story.",
        "A: But there was no foundation for that, that\u2019s correct.",
        "A: It was very exciting.",
        "A: Yes, the, the boat ride over was very exciting. People were thinking about um\nEleanor Holmes Jarrett, wondering about the allegations that she was drinking,\nusing alcohol, using tobacco, there were statements having to do with I think a\nreduction in the credibility of some of the American athletes was rampant. And\nuh it got cleared up I think after the thing was laid out on the table and was\nforcefully presented.\nQW: What was special about this boat ride over? What was happening?",
        "A: What was happening was the athletes were not sitting around, they were in\ntraining. I was surprised. Jesse Owens, Marty Glickman uh Marty Stoller a\nwhole bunch of athletes, running, jumping.\n14\n15",
        "A: Uh there was a great deal of activity going on, on the boat. They were practicing\nin their events. They were movement, there was, there was nobody sitting around\nreading a book. Uh they were trying hard to keep their weight down. They\nworked very hard in every aspect of uh self care. And it was important because\nthese athletes needed to have that great uh spirit, the great ability, the great uh uh\nbodily condition in which to participate and I think the Americans had it.",
        "A: It was an exciting opportunity for me for the first reason, Mickey Cochrane was\naboard ship and one wondered why would the manager of the Detroit Tigers be\non board ship. Well uh all the um anxiety about it ended for me when I got word\nthat I was picked up by the Detroit Tigers to become a member of the Detroit\nTigers as, baseball team and to become a member of that a rookie staff and then to\nplay with that team. And to play with Buffalo in the International League. Uh\nthey were all very excited to have major league managers talk to you and who\nknows how much they were watching and what notes they were taking, who\nknows. I don\u2019t know. But at any rate it was a great feeling that um having\nimportant people on board ship was present and they were taking um plenty of\ntime to talk to athletes and to be with them and to try to assess what they were\nreally like and uh I was lucky. I happened to hook on well with the Detroit\nTigers.",
        "A: It was thrilling in so many ways because you looked out on the playing field and\nyou saw room for 125,000 people. Not every event drew 125,000 people. Some\ndrew fewer numbers than that but however it was a very exciting thing to see that\nsize crowd. Also to see a group playing a game that they weren\u2019t used to. The\nfoul lines were white ribbons four inches wide and they didn\u2019t put plaster of paris\nor yellow uh white dirt down on the field.",
        "A: In the stands where I sat next to Marty Glickman for several weeks while events\nwere going on there were some things happening that uh gave you some more\nidea of what was going on. Hitler did not stay in the visible area of his private\nbalcony when a German athlete won an event. When a German athlete won an\nevent he walked out on his little balcony. He raised his hand. There as a lot of\napplause and then uh he went back in. When a black athlete perhaps Jewish\nathletes too, there were very few of us. I couldn\u2019t count, there wasn\u2019t time to\ncount uh the Jewish athletes and the black athletes especially caused Hitler to turn\naround and to walk out of his own private balcony. In other words he did not\n15\n16\nwant to be seen praising a black athlete even in his own track and field area. He\njust didn\u2019t want to be seen.",
        "A: From where I could see Hitler. I could see Hitler every single day. I could see\nhim every day because his travels were mainly going from inside the balcony,\noutside. Some applause for the German athlete. His hand down when a black\nathlete won an event and his reverse and his walking out of his balcony when\nsome the country became the winner of an event. He did not demonstrate the uh\nreal feelings of uh Olympic history, Olympic meaning, Olympic strength. He did\nnot demonstrate that at all. It was only what he could gain out of his own team\u2019s\nparticipation.",
        "A: He did not salute white athletes, he stayed away from any opportunity to applaud\nan athlete who won an event who came from a country that he didn\u2019t like perhaps.\nI can\u2019t describe it another way but it, I would say it would be accurate to say that\nuh he removed himself from his own private balcony as often as he wanted to, to\ndemonstrate his own feeling and uh that\u2019s what I saw all the time. Marty and I\nwere very close to the balcony where, Hitler\u2019s balcony were not far away. We\ncould see that happening, his walking back and forth.",
        "A: Uh I was no more than five feet away from him in the swimming meets. I went to\nthe swimming meets and I learned that Hitler went to many of the events without\nprior notice. For example wrestling. Swimming. Uh the kinds of events that\ndidn\u2019t draw big crowds and without prior notice. In other words he didn\u2019t tell all\non the phone the committee connected with a particular event. He would just\narrive there I his car, get out, follow his entourage, get up in the stands, sit there\nfor 3, 4, 5 minutes, get out, go to the next one. That we saw very often. Um there\nwas nothing that I can report that indicates that some one in charge of an athletic\nevent of such great importance would behave that way. I could, I could sense it\nyes.",
        "A: Yes because.",
        "A: Yes, I, I think there was some frightening um characteristics of that type of\nbehavior because it was evident that he did not wish to demonstrate fairness to uh\n16\n17\nathletes from several different countries. Uh he avoided the opportunity to be\neven handed as often as possible which is one of the, one of the credos of the\nOlympiad to, to be fair to all the countries of the world.\nAs: \u2014 Uh, walking out onto the field, he did that at the beginning.",
        "A: When Hitler was walking out onto the field and that happened several times, it\nwas very, very difficult to understand uh how he could possibly behave one way\nin the stands, another on the field, another way to the press. Another way to\nperhaps his own political leadership. It was very difficult to understand that\nbecause um the uh work of the Olympiad is entirely different than, than being\nangry at other people. It\u2019s being friendly, it\u2019s being togetherness, trying to work\ntogether, trying to understand each other from different parts of the world.",
        "A: What is it?",
        "A: Hitler had a very commanding presence. Never strong enough to present it solo\nbut always second or third line with other protective units around him all the time.\nNever, never walking into a situation by himself but at least Goebbels and many\nof the others, 10, 12 people surrounding, walking uh in a way that would, would\ngive you a fright.",
        "A: When he entered the stadium, when Hitler entered the stadium there was great\napplause. There was tremendous attempt for his own citizens, his, his German\nparticipants, his German spectators to applaud uh the, his, his presence yes that\u2019s\ntrue and they felt that he was the producer of this grand spectacle, this grand\nspectacle to make it possible for the rest of the world to be waiting and watching\nuh what was going on in Hitler, in Germany at this place.",
        "A: After we played an exhibition game, we would assign a series of locations where\nthe 28 of us on the Olympic baseball team were divided into squads and working\nwith local uh physical education teachers and leaders uh to teach baseball to\nclubs, to teams, to, not to fight them against their great desire to play soccer but to\n17\n18\nteach them that there was another sport and that the rest of the world was waiting\nfor them to come into baseball.",
        "A: We played exhibition games throughout Germany yes.",
        "A: None whatsoever on my, my part, none on my part. The only anti-Semitic feeling\nthat I had slight touch for had to do with the um the newspaper syndicated people\nwho wanted to meet a manufacturer\u2019s story.\n(end)\n18\n"
