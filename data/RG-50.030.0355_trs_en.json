        "Question: Can you tell us your name and where you come from and when you were born?",
        "Answer: Yes, I do this. My name is Teofil Kosinski, Polish, but for Americans it may be a\nlittle difficult to pronounce, Kosinsk1i, so it's better I say Toffi Kosinsk1.\nI was born in Poland, in Torran. This is a Polish name, and in German it was Torran. I\nwas born on the first of January 1925, so in one month I will be 71 years old.\nQ. Did you go to school also in Torran and what did your parents do?\nA. I finished my ordinary school, seven classes, in Torran. My parents -- my father worked\non the railroad and my mother worked from time to time cleaning some houses.\nWe were together five children and my mother and father. Until the war, until the first of\nFebruary 1929, we were living in the railroad blocks. We had three rooms, but two rooms were\nrented always because the salary of my father was very low to feed the whole family.\nQ. You speak also very well German. Why\u2019?\nA. You see, in Torran were many German people. Even my parents had to go to the school,\nto German school so that before the war I learned a little German from German people, and just a\nlittle home because from time to time my parents if they wanted to speak in secrets before me\nthey tried to speak in German.\nQ. And do you understand what they were telling?\nA. No, no, I couldn't. I was so angry. \"Mamma, why you speak?\" And she laughed and it\nwas so funny, but then when Hitler came I had to try to speak and to learn because I knew that\nwas very important for me.\nQ. How were you raised -- in which religion were you raise\nA. I was catholic. I am catholic and that's all. I was educated in this religion. When I was\ngoing to the school -- we had also because in Torran were some Jews. I had two friends at my\nschool but during the religion lesson they went out.\nQ. Do you remember their names?\nA. In Torran school not, but later I had some friends after the war that I met. Titlebaum.\nHe's now in Israel. He left Israel in 1968 probably he's still alive. Maybe when I will be in Israel\nI will find him. It will be a great pleasure for me.\nQ. I don't know Torran at all. Can you describe how it looked during your childhood when\nyou grew up and your family --?\nA. Yes, I try. It was a wonderful time. It still is wonderful, very old city. Some people\ncalled this town . It is from the old century, middle age city. A most gothic,\nbeautiful old churches and the music house also very nice. This place, the Torran was the place\nborn . It was very famous. You remember maybe or you know something\nbefore the war Hitler had in the place of , before it was a corridor, they called\nit, the train passed from Germany through Torran to Dank. So, me, as a child, I ran very often\nthis train. I followed. I asked for sweets something and the Germans gave me.\nQ. Do you remember in your early childhood, like when you went to school, was there any\ntensions between yourself, catholic, or Jews in Torran, or did you never notice anything?\nA. No, I noticed. In Torran, not very Jews but the Jews that are, are very kind and very\ngood. Even we, we made shopping by company by . My father was, as I told you,\na railroad worker, so if we like to buy something, some dressing, some clothing, we received\nfrom him especially . It was very convenient for us because cash to pay it was very\ndifficult. I played with the two boys and I went home and I like the cuisine, the Jewish cuisine.\nWe had some restaurants and to me personally when I was young, I worked not only be German\nI had it also to some Jews some restaurants only -- I met with them shopping. So, I had money\nbecause I should never holidays, instead to go like holidays like all the children to spend a nice\ntime I had to work.\nQ. Your family didn't have a lot of money?\nA. No, I told you. Even my mother -- we had three rooms, nice rooms but one room was\nalways rented. They were given to the window for rent. It was also not good because sometimes\nthey changed. Sometimes it was very good, sometimes it was very bad. Sometimes she didn't\nreceive money for it. It depends there are different people.\nQ. And you went to school -- how was your school career?\nA. You see, I finished this ordinary school. It was exactly in 1939 and I remember in June.\nThen my parents wanted me, personally, because I had not talent but I had very good knowledge\nand the teacher said to my mother and to my father that 1t should be very good when they send\nme to the gymnasium. And my parents decided our son must finish just a little high school. So, I\ntried to make examination and I passed very good notes. I was the third on the list, and my\nmother ordered a new suit for the gymnasium. I had the uniform and we couldn't pay\nimmediately so we ordered it exactly like my so the suit could be paid for for a few\nmonths. Then came the war and I never went to the gymnasium. I never wear this nice uniform.\nI gave it back to this tailor because I didn't use it and we couldn't pay. So, my further education\nwas finished. Since the war it was absolutely forbidden for the Polish people to go to the school.\nQ. Do you remember the day in 1939? Can you tell us exactly?\nA. Of course, I remember very well. It was on the third of September, morning --no it was\non the first of September. I was in the market. Usually I went very early before going to the\nschool, and I helped some German farmers to put vegetables on the market. They paid me also\nwith some vegetables and it was very hard for my mother. I returned home. We heard the\nsignals and my mother said, \"Oh my God, the war began.\" She has seen -- many people had seen\na cross on the sky oral like this because my mother spent the first war, she had the experience\nand she said, \"No, never in our life a second war.\" But the second war began.\nAnd then, on the third of September, it was Sunday, I'll never forget it. My father has to\ngo to Warsaw to fight against the Germans. He has received three months salary. He left his\nmoney to my mother. My mother took the money. She took special -- not in paper money only\nin coins, use silver because she said she had experience. Paper money would not be valid. The\ncoins will be valid, just silver.\nSo, the third of September, from our family from village they came with the horse and\nhow we call it this car -- with horse, and they took us from the village because everybody afraid\nthat they will come, the bombs will come, and we want to be hidden there so that we went to the\nvillage with our family with our family to be more surely there than in the city of Torran.\nQ. Did you return to Torran?\nA. Not so early. First me, brother, everybody, we were there and the village but maybe after\ntwo weeks after we heard that in Torran are the German soldiers, my mother asked me and my\nolder brother has to go to this house and try to prove that everything is okay because during the\nabsence could happen everything. We had returned. We seen soldiers, some soldiers in the\nbeginning were very kind. They tried to give soups and\nbreads because in the soups we had nothing. I took some breads even and I went by foot with\nmy brother to the village and I told mother, \"Come on. There is no reason to sit here. We must\ngo home. The soldiers are not so bad. Maybe the war will be not so long.\" And we returned to\nthe same place to the nice house where we lived before.\nQ. Did you stay in this house during the war?\nA. Oh, only maybe two months we were living there in the same house, but then once they\ncame there, the soldiers, by some patrol, I couldn't recall because I was very young, and said you\nmust leave this house. Oh my mother began to cry but where are we to go. We are living so\nlong here. Don't make a . You must leave. We are giving you a few hours time but\nfirst she would like to know where. You will receive a good flat. We went with my brother.\nWe had seen this replacement for us. It was terrible, but it was what we had to do. It was an\norder. So, we tried to take as much as was possible and we went to this new house. It wasn't a\nhouse, maybe it should be called shed maybe because it wa only -- we had three rooms and now\nmy mother said it is more easier to move from a worse place to better than to on the contrary,\nfrom the better to the worse. Here it was only one room house, with small kitchen, a dark\nkitchen. There was no water inside. There was no water, toilet outside, no cellar, nothing, but\nwhat we had to do was to leave and to stay and thank God we had received this because some\npeople they were put on the street.\nQ. Why had you to leave the house and how many other people had to leave the houses in\nTorran?\nA. The only reason was that we are Polish. This was the reason. It was too nice to us. They\nput it immediately German families from Germany. Sometime, because we were living in --\nacross sometimes we look out the window. It was very difficult to just living here and the people\nfrom Germany took our flat.\nQ. How did you support yourself and how did the family support themselves in the\nfollowing months?\nA. Usually all young people were sent to the force camp to Germany. My brother -- before\nthe war was one or two years he learned not as baker for some sweet things, but baker and so he\nworked by this baker and once he came to me he said you see, it's better you take the job by\n. It is also baker and I have some friends there. It will be very good job and\nmaybe it you will not go to Germany to the force camp.\nAnd I went to this bakery. I remember he was very nice tall man. I didn't speak so good\nGerman. I tried to speak German but this German he was living in Poland so he could speak\nPolish too. First, he refused to speak Polish but when he seen that I try but I couldn't he started\nwith me speak Polish. I told him that we have very difficult situation. My father is not here. I\nhave younger sisters and brother. We have to help mother. I would like to work because I heard\nthat there is wanted a boy his\nbakery. He called his wife. She looked at me probably I was good for -- I looked well. She\nagreed and soon I was employed there as a delivery boy. This kind of job I had to go by bicycle.\nI had on my back a basket with bread and every morning very early I brought this bread to some\nGerman hospitals, to German shops and to some private houses.\nQ. Were you disappointed that you were not allowed to go to school? How old were you?\nA. I heard this immediately. It was written, we had many times some special how you call\nthis on the streets, there was written, at the first in the beginning it was written in German and in\nPolish . I don't know in English how it was. I went\nto the school but the door was closed and it was only for German children. I knew immediately I\ncouldn't go.\nQ. Were you disappointed?\nA. Of course because I was so glad I started to study. I wanted to be as we called in Poland,\neven in Torran, one mensch. My mother, my father said I will take from a month and put to him\nfor his schooling, one of our family must be a mensch. _I think in comparing with other people,\nit was maybe in the beginning not so bad for us because as I told you I was working as a delivery\nboy for a baker. So, I could receive even for my payment, my salary was not so high. I\nremember it was only five marks per week, but I received some bread and it was very important\nbecause the food was rationed especially for Polish people. We had received -- what I\nremember, there was one pound of meat per month including bones. You can understand it was\nnothing. It was with some soldiers also. Sometimes we wondered she prepared some dishes, of\ncourse meat was maybe two or once per month, but she prepared this or that so things that my\nmama, she was very practical and we were not hungry. In the beginning I thought and my\nbrother bought so that our family didn't be hungry.\nQ. You said there were Polish people from Torran sent from Germany. Do you remember\nstories, do you know people who were sent to Germany for forced labor?\nA. Oh, yes. Even my friends from the school they were sent to . For\nthe first time I had received letters, I also have at home he sent me picture how he had to work in\n, how very hard, and very -- they had here a -- Polish, this is in Poland and he\nwrote me so that I could read the conditions were very, very hard. So, therefore I tried to do my\nbest only to stay to work for this baker instead to go there, to Germany.\nQ. Did he write you where he was -- was he kind of imprisoned in a work camp or did he\nwork for --?\nA. That was forced labor, . He was sent, many Polish people were sent. Some\nof Polish families were sent to this . It's called because we were born in Torran.\nWho was born in Torran the Germans they kept them there, but who wasn't born there, they sent\nto the district . Maybe it was better. We would like also to go there, but we\ncouldn't. We had to stay in Torran.\nQ. Do you know why?\nA. Why we had to stay? I don't know, maybe they wanted to make us German. I don't\nknow. I don't know why.\nQ. Those friends of yours who were sent to , Where did they live in\n\u2014\nA. Oh, I never seen him. Then I went -- my study later, I never seen him.\nQ. But when he did write the letter, did he tell you -- did he live in a house?\nA. Oh, no, together with horses. Together with horses. Their food was very bad. They had\nto take him from the fields some row of carrots or this to feed because they were so hungry. You\nsee, I tried to do everything not only to go there. Some of them they escaped but when they were\ncaught, they put them in the prison.\nQ. How old were you when you started to work for the German baker and did you stay\nworking for him all the time?\nA. Yes, I tell you. When I was fourteen years old I worked for this baker, and I worked, let's\nsee, 1941, I worked there. But it was so that during the war for young people, no chance, life\nwas so boring we couldn't go -- there was cinema but for German people only. There was the\narts but for German people only. We had nothing. We had to stay home from eight o'clock\nevening until six o'clock in the morning. It was how we call curfew. You couldn't walk. You\ncan't imagine. It is summer, a very nice time. Evening it's dark first at 10:00 and you have to be\nhome. What we have done. There was a small place, we took our chairs, from all people, we\nwere sitting there to spend in the fresh air because we couldn't go on the street. One time when I\nwas delivering the bread to the hospital, I pass, always the theater. I was very keen for theater\nbecause I like very much music. I like to sing, even in the school. And then I have seen there\nwas written \"Chorus singers wanted.\" I think \"Oh my God, maybe I could go there.\" First I\nwonder and ask was me as a Polish can I do it. They look at me because I'm very young. I was\n16 years old and first he said, \"You want to be singer? You still have this mutation, this change\nof voice.\" I said, \"No, no, I finish my mutation. I would like to sing.\" Okay. We employ also\nPoles, but the examination will be at this and this time. I asked to write to fill my name and after\ntwo days I went there. I remember Mr. Veber, not so old, but a very good man and he gave the\nexamination, first on the piano and then he asked me sing something. German songs I didn't\nknow and I asked, \"May I sing Polish?\" \"Yes. You can do this.\" I never forget I sang a very\nnice Polish old song. He liked it. It was very nice. I translate it soon as I could and he said to\nme, \"Go away, wait.\" I don't know. Maybe he asked somebody. Maybe the commission makes\nsome discussion. Anyhow, after one hour he said okay, you will be our chorus singer. Your\nvoice 1s correct, very good, only the question you must work here only as an extra task. It will\nnot be main work. I didn't understand what he meant. You will work afternoon and evening and\nthe other job you have you must keep it. Okay, I agreed. I went home. I said to my mother, my\nmother, oh, it will be too difficult for you, two jobs. And maybe the will not be\nsatisfied that you are working in theater. The night will be too short for you. But I insisted, my\nmother, it will be everything okay. I will keep this job and this job and believe me it will be\npossible. Okay, do as you like. And so I worked in theater and I worked in the bakery.\nQ. You stayed working for the baker?\nA. Not all time, but in the beginning I was working yes, I was working bakery and theater.\nThe theater was very nice. I like this climate, this atmosphere. There were dancers, singers, nice\npeople. In the theater you could forget, you see, the war, and especially for me, I had no chance,\nnothing, no cafes, just no -- it was war time boring. During the evening it was dark, closed\nhouse, no gas lamps nothing. War. Exactly war. So, when I was working in the theater it was\neverything good, but in my job happened something very wrong. Because as they told you you\nremember when I was employed by the baker the woman, his wife, came to me. She looked at\nme and then later I knew what for. The age of her husband and the woman was very big\ndifference. She was younger and probably she was bigger and more demand in the month for\nlove. She used me as a boy not only for delivery of bread but also of the delivery love letters to\nher lovers. In the beginning it was everything good but something happened very, very wrong.\nWhen I went with this letter, open it, a woman. She said, \"What are you doing. You're trying to\nmake -- break my marriage.\" And I ran away. I told -- I said in German \"Meister, and she said\n\"Yes did you --\" No, I have this. Good that you haven't given this but maybe she can recognize\nyou because Torran was very small. Everybody knew us. And then in this moment she tried to\ndo everything that will go out from this job. My mother, the meister, everybody was wondering\nwhy. It was always so good, but I knew later that the reason was that she was afraid that maybe\nthere will some blackmail. The man will be know about her and okay. I was looking for a new\njob. It was very, very difficult to find a very easy job. But I found it as an ordinary worker. It is\nin German a . You can translate this into English. I remember the name it\nwas Hanz Kruger. I agree and I was working there. I said immediately that I cannot stay very\nlong only until 3:00 because then I have to exercises in the theater. They appreciated very much.\nAt first they were very anxious, curious that Polish people and I said \"No, I'm just a chorus\nsinger, nothing more.\" And so I worked there and I worked in the theater.\nQ. But Polish people were not allowed to be on the street after 8:00?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But you had to work in the theater sometimes in the evening?\nA. Yes, you are right. Before I accepted the theater because they told me you will work here\nnights, performances until 10:00 and you will receive a special pass for the night. I received a\npass from 8:00 until 12:00. I was very funny and very proud, but it was not for other people not\ngood. Other people you can imagine. They are sitting. They are waiting and I'm coming at ten\nor eleven o'clock home. They are wondering what's happened. Maybe he is a German now. I\ncouldn't explain to everybody that I have this permission. At home my mother knew. My\nbrother was not satisfied with this, and he wasn't also satisfied that I was working in the theater.\nMaybe some friends, because he had many friends, and maybe they thought I was collaborating\nwith Germans. It was not a pleasant time for me, especially when I came home or when I passed\na street when somebody -- it happened also that my friends from the school sometimes when I\npassed they took the hat so on this side they thought that maybe I'm collaborating.\nQ. Did your German also improve when you were working in theater? Did you start to\nspeak better German?\nA. Yes, of course I had to because we had the exercises. We received a note and it was\nGerman. I tried to learn the German better. I asked my mother, my father, the grammar. My\nmother could speak but she couldn't explain me how it was grammatically good. Then I asked\nsometimes Mr. Veber and he was very glad that I am so keen for this language. He said, \"Oh,\nyou are a very clever boy. In a short time you will speak fluently German.\" It was not fluently\nbut it was better and better, always better. So, that's and even when I was working with this\nbaker, we went together and we made shopping with the women, with the meister and I tried also\nto speak German or Polish. She said we are going now to the German shop, try to speak German\nonly. And sometimes if I needed something, , then because we couldn't buy,\nexcept a small ration of food in the cart, nothing, no . The Germans had some\n, It is permission for buying clothes, dresses or shoes. We had nothing. Once I\nremember she also went to a German shop and you see the boy this winter it's cold maybe you\nhave something, and they put it to give because I talk to her German, maybe they took me as a\nGerman too.\nAnyhow, I improve my German so much as possible sometimes the Germans couldn't\nrecognize me that I was German, because I used this night pass control for some shopping. For\nGermans there was everything, but at night, evening. And I went to those shops, I bought I\nremember it was marmalade, there was some not -- a kind of zwieback, sometimes there was\nsome fruit some oranges, but there was only two or three. They wouldn't like to sell more so that\nI had use of this privilege of my pass and I could buy a little to my mother.\nQ. Then when you worked for the theater you met at one point someone who became very\nspecial?\nA. Yes. It was once when I left the theater I crossed usually the same place to make some\nshopping and I feel that somebody watched me. At the moment I thought maybe some\npoliceman because it was dark. I didn't see. I went and he followed me and they see there 1s\nsome uniform, some soldier. I didn't know what he wanted from me. He watched, but his\nwatching was completely differently than usual. He smiled to me. It never happened before and\nhe started to ask something of me and he said , which means \"this is a nice\nplace\" and then hello, how are you? What are you doing? \"I'm going home. Shall we go home\nto drink some coffee?\" I'm looking. A German invited me for coffee. My hat was trembling I\nwas so excited. I didn't know maybe if I refuse him maybe something happen wrong. I agree. I\nwent and then when we're inside, so, and you're out shopping. \"Your parents are living here,\nfamily?\" \"Yes, my parents are living here. My father is not here. My father is I don't know,\nmaybe in Germany and I was born also here.\" You were born here? You're not German? No,\nI'm Polish. Oh, God, what are you doing now.\" I said, \"Don't worry. I have the passport. I am\nworking theater. I have the passport until 12:00\" \"Oh, God, that's good, but maybe we go out,\"\nbecause I think he was afraid my characteristic, German speaking that somebody here that he\nspeaks with me, there were not so many people but anyhow I knew that in the beginning when I\nspoke only a few words it was correct. But I started to speak more he felt that my accent was\nbad.\nAnd we went out. He asked me in which direction I'm going home. I showed him\nbecause I was living not in the center of city, we were in suburb, very, very poor district. Then\nwhen the evening he asked me, \"May I see you again?\" For the first time, I would like to meet\nyou. But he look always in eyes. It was something completely different than usual with all the\nGerman men. I asked why not, we can do this. \"But where?\" I asked. You see, here, this\nstation. It was in the railroad station in the middle of the city. It was a very good place. Okay,\nbut when? You see I don't know when I'll receive the permission for going out because he was a\nsoldier. And I also, I don't know because there were differently plays, operetta, gypsy, a little\nlonger, sometimes it is an operetta it was a little shorter. We fixed exactly I\nremember it was after two days at the same place, and he came after my performance, he came.\nAnd then, I have to tell you we went -- I took him because I knew places. He asked me whether I\nknew some places because he is not so good to walk for him and for him, especially for him\nmaybe more because Polish people were not on the street.\nAnd I found some places we were standing there in the theater and he -- maybe I so\nexactly there is some item but he pressed on and he said, \"You look very nice. You are a very\nboy.\" Then he told me, \"I'm not German.\" \"You are not German? Who are you then?\" \"I'm\nAustrian. \"Austria, Vienna? Yes, Vienna.\" Then I feel a little better. It is completely different\nto like a German. Have you met in these places as a child. As a child I played in some places. I\nknew some. It was destroyed in the war in the field there was somebody watching as a guard.\nLet's go because it was cold. I met him it was on exactly the fourth of November 1941. It would\nsnow. It was cold. I liked to wear shoes -- only small shoes and trousers with pump, here. So,\nthe snow -- the winter was so strong. He took me to places for the first time like father and I was\na child and it was very pleasant and then we went to the shed. We played. It was romantic. It\nwas not so suffocating like now maybe, completely different. Then when I went home, I couldn't\nsleep. I dreamed because it happened something with me completely different.\nQ. What happened? What was different for you?\nA. Different for me, it changed my life. I feel something, like love. It was like love but\ndon't think that there was real sex. No. There was playing, kissing, maybe the sex comes also,\nof course, I was young, I feel it. But and we had no possibilities but it was a very, very\npleasurable time. We couldn't see each day as I told you because he could not receive every day\nthe permission but so long he could he came and he brought me always something, some sweet,\nsome special ration card. With this card I could buy some pastry because for Polish people it\nwas absolutely forbidden to receive pastry but for his card especially evening when I went, I\ncould receive it. I received once even shoes because he had seen that my shoes for the winter\ntime was no good. Home was big scandal, especially my brother.\nMy brother felt that there is something wrong because I brought shoes. I brought once\nshirt, inside shirt and he knew that this shirt was from soldier. He asked me something, \"What's\nhappened? Don't worry. What I am doing is my business.\" Sometimes he was very angry. He\nsaid I am older than you. I promise Father to take care of you so I must know.\nQ. Did you tell him?\nA. Not early. Later. When that was so big that even my mother feel something happened\nwith me, something, because I ask very often, \"Mother I need white shirt.\". My mother\ncomplained, \"I have no soap. You change every day. I cannot wash. Mother I must look very\nnice\", but it was not for theater. It was for my friend. His name was Willie Goetz. I will never\nforget his name.\nBecause he was so sweet to me, I wanted also to be sweet and once they of course, when\nmy brother drank a little, schnapps, that's a kind of illegal vodka, we couldn't buy it but he had\nsome contacts. Maybe later I will tell you. I knew he had to work. He worked with some\nunderground. I never knew exactly, but he brought also sometimes schnapps probably from\nthese places.\nI said to him, his name was Casimir, I said, \"Cashic, you must understand me. I fall in\nlove with soldier. Oh my God, why? You don't like women? No, I like men like you like\nwomen. I like men. You must understand me. No, this is only for the moment. You'll find a\ngirl probably, especially with Germany. You know what's happened. It's very dangerous. No,\nit's not dangerous, it's so good. No, you can be sure. You must stop this. I'll tell mother. Don't\ntell this mother, I ask you very much. Don't do this.\" He didn't say this, but from this time he\nchanged his behavior towards me. And our relation was not so open. I knew that sometimes he\nwent to somebody but not night only during the day. He had no permission so that his time\nworking and doing this was not so easy for him. Anyhow, our relation was not so good as\nbefore.\nQ. You said that your brother worked in the underground, did you ever get into difficulties\nwith that?\nA. I feel it. He never said this at home but there are too many friends and they came to our\nroom, with no loud speaking. Even my mother, \"What are you doing? This is our business.\"\nSO, that I feel there was something there. They had some news about the war, about the front,\nfrom where? We had no radio. I forgot to tell you that when we were living in this nice house\nwe had very nice radio, Phillips Radio. We didn't even pay. There was two years of payment\nand the Germans in the beginning immediately took this radio so that the Polish people never\nlistened to no radio. For my brother I had some news because from BBC they heard something.\nIt was only my feeling, but I suppose he was afraid that I was working in the theater with\nGerman people. And then I said to him I have this friend, this soldier, I'm sure that he didn't\nwant to tell me about his underground work.\nQ. Did you -- how was your feeling that Willie was Austrian, I mean he was part of the\nGerman army and the German army was responsible that you couldn't go to school, that you had\nto work. How did you feel about that?\nA. Usually my feeling to German soldiers was very bad because in the school we were\neducated against Germany and Russia. Even my mother sometimes when I wouldn't go to the\nchurch, she called me a Bolshevik. That was the worst thing. When I met Willie and he said to\nme he is Austrian, my feeling was completely different because I felt he's not German and his\nbehavior was so good. I thought maybe when I said to my brother that he will understand me,\nbut he didn't because he said for me German uniform is German uniform. It's Austria or it's not\nAustria but it is for me German. And he knew that I couldn't go to the school. Very often he\nmade me plans, you see the world, it will not be war time. The war will finish. Maybe you'll\ncome to my country. You will study there, you will be a real mensch. Be a waiting person, do\nlike just now. Be in this way as you are because I was very honest.\nIn our family and my mother was very strong, strong for the education. I never forget\nonce before the war I went not to the school I went -- instead to school with boys to some play\nand because I was always going to the school, the teacher sent somebody to ask what happened\nto me why I didn't come to the school. My mother knew this. I came home as usual. It was\ngreetings. I said . My mother said I give you forever and I received -- I was\npunished so strong and she punished because who lies also steals. So, I was very honest so\neverything what I've done was correct and therefore I believed Willie.\nWe talked about his future plans. We talked about is life and before for me it was for me\na pleasure to hear it. I agree that I was very lucky especially as I told you during the war time. It\nwas so boring for young people. I was 17 years old at this time. I had no friends because I had\nto work morning from one work to another work. I even had not enough for sleeping, only when\nI had no appointments with him I could sleep a little longer.\nQ. How old was Willie?\nA. He was maybe five or six years older than me, but he looks very handsome, very strong.\nI never seen his picture and he told me -- I asked once for his picture but he said it's better you\nwill not have it. It will be very dangerous for you and for me. He told me also. He said\nsomething, you must be very careful because Hitler, what you receive for this kind of love is\nvery dangerous. You must be very careful. I said what for we are doing nothing. Don't tell\nanybody that we meet or that we are coming here. It would be very dangerous. He told me one\nday he said \"You know Hitler is also for men. He likes only this kind of love. Really? Yes, he's\nnot married. He is single and he likes this kind of love. The Fuhrer then why are you so\nanxious? Please believe me, I am older I know better.\" He told me that.\nQ. Did he tell anything about the persecution of homosexual men?\nA. No, it was only the attention given to me in this way, but it was in a real 1941 when we\nmet, let's go to a place here, I cannot tell you. He brought me something new and he was very\nnervous. What's happen? At first I thought maybe someone has seen us. I asked him, no,\nnobody seen you know. I'm sent to the eastern front of war. Oh my to Russia. I heard that this\nwas the worst front in the war because it was warmer it was snow. You must wait for me. I\npromise you. The war will not be longer. When the war is end the war you will come to Vienna.\nI will try to live with you together. Wait for me. But how will I contact. I'll write you. I gave\nhim my address and I was waiting for his letter but I hadn't received it. I was very sorry, very\nsad. Even my mother, my brother. I said to my brother that my friend went -- he accepted, he\nagreed. He was a little satisfied with this. He was more calmly that something happened wrong\nto me. I was waiting for this letter. Once I couldn't remember -- I have to state to you also that\nin my theater there was working like me. He was a little older. He knew exactly, he learned me\nthis way, he explained me this kind of love and he asked me -- first I didn't want to tell him but I\nwanted to see the place, what's happened. Where is this shed and then come on let's go. We\nshall go maybe there and once we went there it was after the performance and when we went\nthere, voices. Some people -- I wanted to run away. He too, and especially one fellow took us\nhere very quickly, halted the mouths. We couldn't cry, nothing and then in broken German he\nsaid to me that he's from the concentration camp Studthoff. He was a very young Jew. Bascal I\nremember this name. We give our story to him to the other people. We talk to them also. One\nspoke very good Polish. He was Polish. That Sigmund, the other boy took the Jew -- I couldn't\ntake where we were living. He took him home probably for some feeding even some dressing.\nWhat's happened there I don't know exactly. I was only with my things about my friend. Even\nSigmund if I wanted to know, he told me only it was very nice time. I can imagine. Maybe he\nused him for some sex or something like this because he said it was so nice.\nQ. How many men were in this shed?\nA. Three men. Some of them they had stripes, some trousers. Maybe they found them, but\nthey had stripes. They couldn't go on the street. They would be immediately arrested.\nEverybody could recognize them. They had this cap also with this thread. Now I know that they\nhad some ___ but I don't remember exactly. I knew only the faces very --- Bascal was small,\nbut the eyes were very large, very big. This is all.\nQ. Bascal, where did he come from?\nA. He said to me from France and he spoke -- I couldn't speak French. He spoke only a little\nGerman, a few words. Enough only to understand me. Then when I was in the theater one day I\nhad seen a German newspaper and this German newspaper on the table and there was written,\nthere was the address for the soldiers who are on the east front. I wrote secretly this and then I\nwas fighting with myself. It was so long time, four months. I haven't received a letter. Have I to\nwrite or not to write the letter.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2\nQ. When you went to this shed and you heard voices, what exactly happened?\nA. You see, when we went there there was change. Usually I remember it that it was\ncompletely different. We heard some voices, some human voices and when I said to my friend,\nSigmund, let's go, we go, at this moment somebody stood up and closed our mouths, nothing to\nsay. Probably this man thought we are from Poland or maybe some spies. Then he started to ask\nme Polish. He spoke very good Polish. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked me. We came\nonly here because our paths crossed. We are not from -- no we are Polish. He tested me many\ntimes. He feels that I speak perfect Polish. My friend also, and then we have seen two other\nfaces. They were laying the sheets and the youngest was trembling, was very cold even the\noutside was not so cold. And the youngest tried to speak something. I asked in Polish first, but\nhe couldn't reply me Polish and he said to me in German. I asked \"Are you German? No, ina\ncompletely different way, in French. I'm French and Jew.\" He said Bascal's his name. My friend\nSigmund took care of him immediately. I gave him shirt because he had only his striped jacket.\nThis from the Studtkoff. It 1s warm outside I can go home in my white underwear shirt. And so\nI did. Then he said to this Bascal that he will take him home but only in this dressing. Then to\nthe two, he promised to wait here so long as they will come. The French with the Bascal\nprobably he wanted also to bring some food, maybe some dressing. I don't know exactly. I had\nenough problems with my Willie and I couldn't help nothing more. I give only my shirt and that\nis all.\nOnly the next day or after maybe two days I asked Sigmund what happened. He said\neverything is okay. Bascal was at his house, slept there, and he didn't want me to say more. I can\nimagine he helped them. He gave maybe food some dressing and they escaped from this place to\nmaybe another place. I never went more. I was also afraid that if I go there and there are some\nprisoners because they said they are from Studtkoff. It was for me also very dangerous to go\nthere. So, that I didn't go anymore there.\nOnly this I knew from Sigmund can be sure everything is okay. You can be sure don't\nask more. I was wondering a little. Usually he was a little crazy, not crazy, but so funny and at\nthis moment he was very, very serious and I proceeded very much. Unfortunately he is also not\nalive. I have met him maybe even ten years ago when I was in Torran but no more. He's also\ndead. He's no more alive. If he were we could go -- I would like to ask him even for this address\nof my friend as I told you Titlebaum. I tried to find his address. I wrote to my friend to\nin the South of Poland but for Sigmund I have no chance because he is no more\nalive. I'm sure that he helped for them maybe they are still alive, these three prisoners, maybe\nnot. Maybe when we ask sometimes in the radio, who was hidden in the shed near Torran,\nmaybe we'll find them.\nQ. Did you know then what Studtkoff was?\nA. Yes, I heard that it was the concentration camp for Jews and Poles. If something\nhappened in Torran, they were sent immediately to Studtkoff. I had -- there was very, very bad,\nvery slow time. Usually the family received the letter, this and this 1s dead, but we never\nbelieved. It was not dead, probably shot more.\nQ. Were the Jews of Torran sent to Studtkoff?\nA. No, I don't know. Maybe not all. In Torran there were not so many, but near of Torran\nthere was Alexandrov and there were many Jews. Even immediately in the beginning of the war\nwhen I didn't work by baker, it was not so far so I went by foot to Alexandrov to buy some\nbread. I remember that the Jews had to wear their David stars and they had to go on the street,\nand probably from Alexandrov they were sent to Studtkoff.\nQ. And Polish people from Torran, do you know any Polish people?\nA. Who were sent? No. At the moment I don't know. I cannot remember.\nQ. But there was talk in Torran what happened in Studtkoff?\nA. Oh, yes, yes, you know among the people there was talking of course that the situation\nwas very bad. The food and the hell, --as all the concentration camps, but exactly as you know,\nmaybe you remember about my life, later then I was arrested and my knowledge about the\nsituation of Polish people, Polish Jews in Torran was broken.\nQ. Why were you arrested?\nA. As I told you when I found the address in the in the German newspaper, I\nwrote secretly the address and then I was fighting with myself whether to write to Willie or not\nto write.\nQ. Which address did you find?\nA. I find it . It was for the soldiers who were sent to the eastern front\nin Russia, . A very important address, probably for most all soldiers in the\nfront. And I wrote a letter in my young German language. Probably it was you see, my mind it\nis very difficult to say the whole letter. It was that I love him. I'm waiting for him. I pray for\nhim that he comes back and I never go to the same places. I didn't mention the shed. I never go\nto the same place. I wait, I hope you will come back as soon and I will be very grateful. Please\ngive me some news because I am so anxious about you. I cannot sleep. I cannot work and at the\nend, with may kisses your friend Teo. I wrote.\nAnd it was a little naive to write especially I put my sender. Usually I couldn't do that\nbut I was fighting if I send without sender what will happen. Maybe the letter will not come\nback. And if come back I will know that he is not there. So, I send the letter with my sender.\n(section in bold has been copychecked; get most updated version from Joan. 9/10/96)\nQ. And what happened then?\nA. After sending I was still waiting. I was waiting for a reply, but the reply didn't\ncome, never. Once it was September 19, 1942, I was working morning at this manufacture\nand the boss called me and told me that I'm invited to the gestapo. I have to go to the\ngestapo. I asked him, me to the gestapo? What for? I was so honest. I do nothing, what\nfor do I have to go. He said please go there. We have received the order that you will go\nthere.\nUsually I took a bag with some sandwiches to the work. My mother prepared me\nthe sandwiches and I left this bag with sandwiches at this manufactory but he said take this\nwith you. Maybe you don't come back. Oh, why not? If I come back I will have nothing.\nNo, I didn't take, and when I went to the gestapo I remember this uniform, this black\nuniform with red here on the arm. He asked me first for the name. I told him that and\nthen he took a typewrite. He started to write. He write I sitting also in front of him when\nthe paper came down. I read from other side and I never forget the words it was written\n\" \" In English it is \"Order for prisoner.\" The first moment I thought I\nwould fall down, and then he said you will stay now. What for? I began to cry. Don't play\n. And then he called somebody. They took me to the cell it was downstairs in the\ncellar. To the cell and there was the furnace was only a wooden bed and a toilet and that's\nall. Even the door was scraped with wooden so I could put the handle like this. And I had\nto wait. The whole time I was sitting the night and I think what happened. What for, and\nthe next day when I was called again to him, he showed me the letter. This letter which I\nwrote to Willie. Is this your letter? I was very honest. I said of course. This is my letter. I\nwrote this to him. You, you wrote this letter to a German. You loved him. I wrote him it\nwas very good, yes. Then he said where did you meet him. He wanted to know exactly\nwhere we met at, what we had done, in which way. We seen only once or twice. I lied, I\ntried to lie but you say me and he showed me some pictures, other pictures of soldiers, not\nonly soldiers, civilians. He wanted to know you cannot remember. You will remember.\nwith trousers to beat especially with the . It was terrible\nand I cried. They put it in my trousers and they beat me when I couldn't breath, I couldn't\nspeak they brought water and poured water on me and began once more again and again.\nAll over, and always I heard only them, ''You pig, you \" So many bad\nwords I cannot translate it into English especially in German.\nQ. Say it in German.\nA. In German . Terrible, so many words I hadn't\never heard before that. And every day I was sent to the cell there was given only once a\nday, I don't know from there they brought. At first in the beginning I didn't eat nothing. I\nwanted to drink only water. Sleep I couldn't also because I was so beaten swollen under\nmy back -- when I was laying only on my stomach.\nAnd so happened I don't know when, I lost even the dates, maybe about two weeks,\neveryday the same question. The last one they gave me something to sign. I don't know\nwhat. I was so tortured. For me it was everything I signed only to be free.\n, When you tell us the truth you'll be free. I was so stupid. I told them\nalso about Hitler, what Willie said, that Hitler is also homosexual. He wrote this. Yes, and\nyou the Fuhrer. It was very, -- now I'm smiling but it was not for smiling. It was for\ncrying.\nIt happened so after two weeks as I told you I signed this what they wrote. I don't know.\nThen they took me by special closed car. It was a kind, we call this like a , which\nmeans you don't see nothing there, like in prison. When they brought me I had seen the round\nprison. I know because my brother immediately after the war, he was by the Germans also\narrested by Germans but for very short time. Only reason was that he as a boy when he was\ngoing to the school -- it was not high school it was for the baker school, when he was going\nthere, he has to train as a soldier, a Polish soldier. For this reason he was in the same prison. I\nnever forget how my mother suffered. Sometimes she give me bread to give him and then I had\nseen she cried and she said \"Oh my dear God it's better you take him.\" I had seen how the\nmother suffered if the son is arrested. Later when I was arrested I thought also that maybe she\nsuffered also. He was only one month and she suffered and when I was so long time, but maybe\nwe should go with my story further.\nI was brought to this round prison. I was put in the cell with six or seven crime prisoners\nusually. When they heard because each prisoner had received a special card. I had received\ncard. It was written paragraph 175. I didn't know what this mean paragraph and I showed it to\neverybody, but there was somebody oh it is for the gays, for the homosexuals.\nAnd since this time I was very bad behaved in this cell. I was not human. I couldn't sit at the\ntable when the meal began. They treated me very, very bad. And I was sitting there until fifth of\nDecember 1942.\nOn the fifth of December 1942 somebody opened the door. The block meister took me to\nthe Judge. I remember there was only my mother, no people and me and maybe five or six in\nblack dresses. They were the judges. There was shouting and cried, I have to be isolated. I have\ndemoralized the German military, me Pollock and how could I do that. I must be punished. I\nmust be punished for long time and I was 17 years old. They punished me for five years exactly\n. I don't know exactly how it's called in German but is a very hard\nprison.\nImmediately then I met my mother. I couldn't speak. You can imagine how was the\nfeeling my mother and me. When I came to the cell first I cried. But later I had to go -- I was\nsent to Koronovo. was not far from maybe 50 or 60 kilometers. It was the\nworst prison in Poland before the war and during the war. Only for Polish and Jewish prisoners.\nI will never forget they cut my hair because in Torran I still had my own hair. They gave\nme with some maybe yellow -- I don't know, it was here on the arm, and I was sent to the cellar\nwith about 40 prisoners. There were maybe about five or six Jews together with me and it was\nterrible. My memories, especially in this cellar because the oldest of this cell it was a prisoner\nfor a long life, murder and there was a clan. Around him he had a few prisoners. They made\neverything for him what he liked. We had nothing to say. We had to be polite what he -- even\nwith the toilet. The toilet was only morning and then the food, when they delivered the food it\nwas very small, but even if we received one spoon of marmalade, he took from us. We were\ngiven a little margarine, once or twice per week, he took also. So, that this time this 1s my worst\ntime in my life. And then my leg began to be I have received a kind of I\ncannot explain in English. Due to the reason I had no vitamins. It was like it was spoiled this\nleg. It started from a small wound. This was this leg. From this to this here, this place.\nNothing, in those terrible times but of course everywhere is bad times and after bad will come a\nlittle better. Even there, there was so that because our work we were living, we were working in\nthe same cell. There was very stupid work but very dangerous, very dusty. We had to the ropes,\nwe could resolve the ropes then we had to make the leather for the new shoes for the front they\nwere sent. This was the job and once they looked they wanted one . Oh, I have to\nexplain also here that here we could write the letters once every two or three months home in\nGerman language. Everybody doesn't write German. Me and especially my good friend, it was\nthe Applebaum, exactly I remember, he wrote also German. Some of them gave us one potato or\ntwo potatoes for the writing. At the first moment I didn't want to take but Applebaum said yes\ntake it. It 1s for them also very helpful when they have the contact with the parents or with\nfamily your letters.\nAnd so we cooperated very good in this way and once happen that block meister came to\nour cell and asked the oldest men for somebody who can write and speak German. First he send\nsomeone from his clan but after a few minutes he came back and he said no. Exactly he said\n. Then when he came one more, \"You have nobody here? Among 40 men\nyou have nobody. I need a writer. I was standing and I said -- usually I couldn't do that and I\nthink maybe I will be able for him. I said \"Her block meister, I can speak German and I write\nGerman too.\" He was wondering I was so slim and young, where I could speak English. And he\ntook me to his room. He gave me paper pencil and dictated. He dictated in German. I\nremember it was an office, exactly as you like I can do this in German,\n. He looked at this, yes, good. Go there. Take your clothes and\nyou'll come here. I went to the cell and I remember everybody especially those of the clan but\nmy friends, they said, really, he agree. You are able to take -- he takes you? Oh that's very good.\nGo boy, with his hand and with this you are also good that God helps you.\nWhen I went there it was a three men cell, much better, near the kitchen. Sometimes\nwhen I had a little more -- I received sometimes cigarettes. Cigarettes were very good like\nmoney for exchange. Because I didn't smoke -- I never smoked, I could make the exchange for\nthe prisoners in the kitchen for cigarette I received some bread. Then I had the permit to go to\nother places. I belonged to the high society of this prison. I received better uniform, prison\nuniform, better warmer. Even the hair was a little longer than usual. As the flour sometime one\nhad no water and me I was -- but I never forget about my friend Applebaum. I went and took\nwith me some bread some food and I went to the cell and I wanted to give him this. Then I\nremember, I don't know exactly the name of him, he said since few days there's no more\nApplebaum. He patted -- he was in so high depression. He was ill. He had diarrhea and it was\nvery, very dangerous. You know if somebody had this they couldn't stop and suffered. I\nsuppose he thought that this is the end and he made this.\nOf course I left his bread there. I came -- and that was not all because every week from\nKoronovo where the transport station to Sauxenhausen. So always thinking about it was one day\nI will also be sent there. Because that was the end of their life. Who was sent to Sauxenhausen\nnever returned.\nQ. Tell us a little bit more about --?\nA. He was older than me. He was maybe forty, maybe, older than me. He was black, black\nhair. He spoke very good Polish. He told me that he lived in Lodz, this German city for\n. He had family, but he never didn't want to say me what the reason was that he\nwas in Koronovo. I thought maybe he was arrested before the war. I don't know, maybe\npolitical, I never knew. Usually later you received a card what was the reason of the prison. But\nthis we haven't therefore I never knew. I never heard about this. His behavior, he said to me,\nboy don't be worried. You are very young. You will succeed. The war will be not long. You\ncan be sure. He should be older because he told me also about first war. Maybe he knew this\nbefore. He was so sure that -- because I lost my hope. I thought maybe that Germany -- because\nalways the Germans said Poland is forever forgotten, forever. And I lost my hope, but he gave\nme this trust in the prison.\nQ. Was he Jewish?\nA. Of course. You see I have to state, even in this prison, you knew immediately who was\nPolish who was Jewish. The David's star, they had this, this Applebaum. Therefore we knew,\nwe Polish had only a number or maybe yellow on here, this stripe around.\nQ. What was this yellow mean?\nA. I don't know what this yellow means. It was prisoners, not like pink or no -- the\ndifferences of color when I was sent as a writer I received green. Before I don't know exactly the\ndifferences of color.\nQ. Did people in the prison know that you were sentenced because of 175?\nA. Yes, Applebaum knew. I told him, before I never hear this word homosexuality. I told\nhim only that I had something with a man. I told him also with a German soldier. He wasn't\nastonished, only he smile, oh you are a young boy. It was stupid. You are still healthy. But my\nleg, you see, the war will not be so long. He told me always in this way.\nQ. Were there other prisoners who were imprisoned because they were homosexual?\nA. You see there were of course many, but some of them like the doctor for instance. He\nwas working as a doctor because we had lazaret. It was for the very ill people, but there was no\nmedicine, nothing. But there were some. When I was in the high position I met also another\nwriter. I met also someone from theater, not from Torran, from other places. He was also for the\nhomosexual. Then because we receive, everybody has a card and there was written for me for\ninstance was written at this time not paragraph 75, only . I don't know how to\ntranslate this into English. I don't know. It is like because I have just now this year I received a\ndocument thanks to the red cross and I have even with me this document and there was written\n. I looked at a dictionary. It's terrible. It is in the Polish language,\nprostitution. I was not prostitution. Stupid. I cannot show this document to anybody. It was 16\nor 17 years prostitution during the war, stupid. I was so angry for this document I couldn't sleep\nthree days. I wanted first to write to because is a gay national\nin Berlin. I wrote them. I have also the copy and I explained them everything that this\ndocumentary is wrong. Only one 1s exactly the date that I escaped from the prison in\nin the island. It was the 15th of May 1945. This is correct, but even there was a\nquestion nation, there was written unknown. They arrested as a Polish. They cried, \"You Polish\nsow.\" And then put \"Nation, unknown.\" I was so angry when I received this documentation. If\nyou wish I can show you later.\nQ. If you go back to the prison, did you have contact with other homosexual prisoners. Did\nyou talk about your situation?\nA. You mean in the prison? No, because I had no experience. This was maybe no\nhomosexual. I was also as we called this -- I didn't know exactly. Later after the war, I knew\nwhat it means, homosexual, gay etc. but me I was really very shy boy and I didn't know this. I\ndidn't talk about this and nobody asked, so that I never talked about homosexuals in the prison.\nQ. Did you understand when during the interrogation, in the prison when the guard showed\nyou the pictures of the other men, did you understand why -- what were you supposed to do with\nthose pictures?\nA. You mean after the war?\nQ. No, you said in the beginning.\nA. In the beginning when I met Willie --.\nQ. No, no when you were arrested.\nA. I think maybe they wanted to know that I had maybe more soldiers, not only one. This\nwas the reason. Before they showed me some soldiers and civilians but I hadn't. I had only\nWillie. It was true, but they beat me. They wanted to know and maybe they should kill me\nbecause they didn't believe me. But maybe after two weeks they couldn't receive nothing more\nand they believed and I signed something. What, I don't know. After the war, especially later\nwhen I was a tailor then I tried to find the documents so I wrote to Red Cross, everywhere. I\nwanted to receive my documents. See, maybe I will tell you something. When I was a tailor and\nthen when I was ill I didn't receive any indemnification for my time for prison. Then I think I\nhave to do something, I must write to anybody and to fight for my rights. I spent as a boy for\nnothing so I suffered and my leg was -- my body was burned, and I want to call. First I wrote to\nask for the indemnification. I explained that I was so long time the whole time in the prison for\nthis reason and I would like to receive something, some compensation especially because I had\nto go early as a tailor. I couldn't work. I was ill for this reason and I had skin cancer and\ndifferent illnesses, but I have received a reply very kindly that the money has been sent to Polish\ngovernment. I have to go to them and ask and they have to give me. But it was the communist\ngovernment. They will never give money. Then I wrote once more that maybe some symbolic\none mark only that I will have this satisfaction that he agree with me and I ask you for\nforgiveness. No, I received letter if I try more to write all letters will go to the paperbasket. I\nwas so angry. Then I write once more. I will fight so long I will write to New York to the\nUnited Nations. I will fight for my rights. I black mailed a little because I knew I couldn't do\nthat. Then what I have to do, then I find an address in Germany in the parliament there was\nhomosexual bond organization. I wrote to them. I explained that I was so young. I suffered. I\nhave paid with my life. My mother suffered and my family, and they explained we agree with\nyou. We are very sorry, but really what we can do, we can only collect money for you for your\nresearch medicine. And I said no, I don't think you -- I don't need money. I want to receive\nindemnification. You must do something for me.\nThen in Poland there was martial law, you remember and I said oh no, I cannot stay here.\nI must do something, and one day I received a very nice letter from Germany. A young writer\nwrote me a letter and he put this letter in a book about young Jews in Israel. He wanted to give\nme with this book a sample of his writing, how he writes, his style of the book. And it was\nwritten in this letter that he found it by this organization a homosexual by Mr. ;\nhe found my story. This story is very good for writing a book, and he asked me whether I agree\nfor this book. If yes, he'll help me. He put inside 20 marks for the stamps and this was the first\nmoney that I receive as indemnification from my stay in the prison.\nThen when I wrote him I agree, I bought used old typewriter and every day because I was\nnot working any more. I was retired now according to my illness and I wrote him every day\nabout my beginning from the prison everything that he needed for this book. I sent to him, he\nsent me again, so about six months we wrote. He wanted some pictures. He wanted to know\nsome details and when this project of this book was finished he came to me, to Warsaw. I gave\nhim the signature and the book was printed in Germany. The reaction of this book was fantastic.\nI never believed, especially the young people. They wrote letters and they asked me, maybe I\nneed something. They wanted to help me and they were saying -- I suffered only the reason was\nI love somebody, that I loved a man. It was very touching for me. Even until now I have contact\nwith some of them, especially one doctor who delivers me always there the medicine and they\ncontact -- they visit me. They come to me. I stay up to now with very good many friends and\nthe name of this book is \"Damned Strong Love\" and in German . I paid really\nwith my illness and with the memories especially. When I was sitting in Torran and I had seen\nmy mother was watching and I couldn't say to her it was sometimes, it was -- for me it is very\nheavy to remember. Sometimes I say I can forgive German, but never forget. It is too difficult\nto forget. And thanks also many American soldiers because you see when I escaped in the\nBritish zone, I went to Munich because I thought I will go to Vienna. I will find Willie. I\nwanted to know what happened with him. I wanted to meet him. In the beginning it was too\ndifficult. My leg was worse and worse. I received the displaced, the card, the displaced person\ncard in Munich from the Americans and I was sent immediately to the American hospital. I was\nabout two or three weeks. I don't know exactly now, but I know that after three weeks I was fit. I\nwas so healthy and I was so happy that I was again alive.\nNow, I want to go to Vienna. In Vienna there were Russians. I couldn't I wanted to go to\nPoland. I couldn't, because everywhere I heard that in Poland there are communists and their\nsituation is not clear. What I have to do 1s sit and wait? No, I started to work and I worked by\nAmericans. By Americans I learned a little English. By American I learned how 1s their life.\nBy American I learned how it is good because I was working in the canteen, I'm asking an\nofficer. I'll never forget the nice apples, red, the conflicts and even I remember some words I\nlearned, very funny like \"hubba hubba\" and it was really -- I had some friends and I met also one\nofficer. He wanted to adopt me. He wanted you must come to America. I dreamed about\nAmerica. I wanted to come here to America but he said you must receive the permission from\nyour parents because they are alive. I received once the letter from my mother and my father\ncame back. He was also in the forced labor camp in Germany and especially my mother asked\nme so much, come boy, back. Come on, it is not very good but we will be together. And I was\nfighting with myself. I didn't know what have to do, to go or not to go. Many friends said don't\ngo, but my soul says, \"Better go\" and I went of course.\nWhen I returned I regretted it because it was everything strange. Even when I went to\nthis bath house where we were sent from Germany I didn't recognize my young brother. I\nremember he came and I said to my mother, \"Mother a boy came.\" She said, \"This is your\nbrother.\" I cried but I couldn't go to Munich. I had to stay in Poland.\nQ. Let's go back to the prison. You told us you were transferred to a small cell with three\nbeds. It was a better situation. Did you stay in this prison?\nA. No, no. Later, in the beginning I didn't know, but when the transport to Sauxenhausen\nthe block meister came also to me and said you'll go to Stum. You must go -- no he didn't sent\nme to Stum only e took me to same transport. Me and some many four or five prisoners. They\ngave us you know how the hand -- and we went by and we went in special truck. Then on the\nway I heard Stum. Also, it is . In Stum, because my leg was so bad they\nsent me immediately to the lazaret. In lazaret 1t was a little better because it was not necessary to\nwork, but they couldn't heal my leg because they had no medicine and I was there maybe a few\nmonths, when the control always was there. Once he said, \"Oh, you are too long. It is not\nsanitary, you must go out.\" I know why because the front of Russia was near and near and they\nwanted that we do something. It was very hard work. It was very wrong because once I was in a\none man cell and we had always this card and it was written , what, I was\nwith animals. I was -- I never had some dogs or calves. I went to the block meister, excuse me\nplease, it is written here, \"Yeah sure,\" he cried. But no animals. Please ride with men but never\nwith animals, and they put this animals away and only with men.\nQ. Were you the only homosexual prisoner there or were there other prisoners?\nA. Only me. Then I was sent to also there. I haven't seen more homosexuals\nthere. There were some men who had stolen packages from the front from soldiers. When they\nkilled the meat for the black market so completely different for everything. Some letters -- I\ndon't know exactly the reason but homosexual I haven't seen. I remember only it was in winter\nin January 1945 there was so because the Russian front was, it was 1945. And\nwe had to pack everything and about two weeks we went by food in the strong winter and you\ncouldn't stop because you could fall and be frozen. It was very strong. I remember the\nwas frozen. We crossed the and the first maybe in\nreceived some trucks or trains and from there I was sent to the . It was near\nHamberg. It was an island. It was an island and I remember so many bombs there but I pray that\nmaybe the bombs will fall here, even in prison I could escape from prison. But the bombs were\nto the city but never to the prison camp. Then at the end of the war, it was the fifteenth of May,\n1945, I escaped from this prison. I worked there as a pork, . It was a rather\ngood job but I have taken with me sometimes potatoes also, but thank God it was not so long\ntime when we escaped. I went immediately to the British soldier. It was exactly in\n. [remember near Linnenberg. Then they send me to Birken Belsen but it was\nno more a concentration camp. We were living together with Jews in this but not in the barracks.\nOnly in the houses where the SS men were living. There food was too good. I was ill. I was\nswollen and my leg was also very bad, so I think no I have to escape here. I must go to\nAmericans. There was no train and with some friends some other boys we went by train to\nMunich, but it was no train, only American soldiers, some transport. And when I came to\nMunich there was the Judenrot. They gave out a displaced card. They sent me to the\n. It was for displaced person. I was living there short time, but I wanted to be free so\nI met a nice Polish gay boy who lived private and this boy, he's still alive. He's living in Poland.\nHe's older than me, but he's still alive. He's older than me. I met him very often. We speak about\nour time because during this time I learned English. I bought a book for myself and he liked also\nthe American soldiers. Of course I met also some but I had no experience at this time. Later,\nwhen I knew what homosexuality. I learned later. The first time as I told you I was not so\nsuffocated. It was more romantic. And so is my life.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3\nCan you tell us again, when you left the Koronovo prison and where did you go to?\nA. Yes. As I told you a few prisoners were sent to some places at the beginning we didn't\nknow exactly where we are sending. The first moment I thought maybe we are sent to\nSauxenhausen, but usually the transport to Sauxenhausen were much bigger. At this moment, a\nfew only went. Then we had seen some other prisoners, a new one and we heard that it's Stum.\nStum, special for young prisoners. Young 25, 26, but not so many older. And immediately after\narriving there, they had seen that I couldn't walk. They had seen my leg and they sent me to\nLazaret. I was in the Lazaret with other prisoners, not homosexual there. There was one from\nKriena, there was from Belgium. There was from Norway and German. This Ukrainian, I was a\nlittle friend because it was very easy, Polish and Ukraine language is similar so that we were like\nfriends. We talk most than with other prisoners, and after maybe two months, because every\ntime came control, especially one was very, very bad, probably he was from Hamberg,\nsomebody said to me. I don't know exactly for everybody block meister we gave a special\nnickname. Let's say this horse Polish it was , 1t means horse head, because he's\nlooking horselike. He said, \"Oh, you are still here? You must go work. He is not sanitary. You\nwill sin heathen.\" What I had to do, I had to leave and I was sent to one cell, one person cell. As\nI told you maybe before with it's description on my door, , with animals. I\nasked him to change because you can ride with men I had only with men something but not with\nanimals. It was not so easy. It was , everything is the same, especially during\nthe war. This is demoralization and it's just like animals. I had to go to work. It was very, very\nhard, with other prisoners. The nationality I told you was most of them were Polish, some\nGerman, some English, and also from Ukraine. But Ukraine, I was wondering why from\nUkraine, then after the war I can remember because Ukraine was treated a little better. They had\ncollaborated with Germany and maybe the prisoners were better treated. It was the reason.\nFrankly speaking, maybe it was not so -- only the work was very hard. The food was\nmaybe just a little better but not much better than in Koronovo. Of course, there was not enough\nto be food, but better than in Koronovo. I don't know why, but one time they had to send me to\n. Then I also feel what happened here was a big change. Then somebody said\nto me that my mother applied -- I don't know this is kind of a group for German cities and like\nthat. She wanted to help me. Then after the war my sister she told me she wanted to take the\nlawyers advocate. She had done everything to release me from this, and this was the reason that\nI was sent from Koronova to the Strum generally for the young prisoners. Not so the crimes like\nin Koronovo, there was completely different.\nQ. Which kind of release --?\nA. This is like German release, this belongs maybe for better treating. It was a kind of -- it\nwas exactly a group , | don't know. I had never seen this. I had\nonly after my release the my mother applied for this. Maybe it was the preparation that after the\nwar we would be the German citizens. Maybe, I'm not sure, but probably it was this.\nImmediately the change was but before there was no change.\nQ. All other prisoners in Stum were in this program?\nA. Maybe also. I have never seen this documents with this third group of German list.\nProbably it happened the same. I think so, because when we escaped from this, there were only\nthree Polish boys. One was from , one was from . I think so,\ntherefore, when I wrote the book, I asked the writer to find old documents. First\nI wanted to find my full documentation. I wanted to have the same that's\nhappened in east Germany. He has done everything, he couldn't. What I received, I received\nonly an option of one part of these documents which was as I told you, -- but it is not exactly the\nsame.\nQ. In Stum ?\nA. No, I was brought there. I didn't know nothing. If somebody said to me they had to say\nto me, \"Your mother applied to this German list. You are now German.\" No, it couldn't be\nbecause I should be sent to the military. It's happened. I have seen sometimes, you know, they\ntook them but from where I don't know. Maybe to when they needed soldiers.\nOnes that go free to the they will go free but it was very dangerous and\nnobody returned back. But I didn't never. First I knew about this when I returned after two years\nafter the war to Poland. My mother \"Yes, I tried to do my best but you didn't --\" She thought\nthat I would be free immediately and even in these documents I received there was a mention\nthat I had to be in the prison exactly five years. It was fifth of December, exactly five years.\nQ. What kind of work did you have to do in Strum?\nA. In Strum as I told you, it was very hard. They had prepared for the war some, you know.\nWe had to (Speaking in German.)\nQ. (Speaking in German.)\nA. (Speaking in German.)\nQ. So when you were in Stum you were not on the forced labor outside?\nA. No, it was a prison. We were always in a group. We had to go with the block meister.\nAfter it was from early morning to evening. It was dark. We came back. We had received hot\nsoup, evening first and the morning we left.\nQ. How many hours did you have to work?\nA. Oh, it was very long. Let's say from 8:00 until 4:00 afternoon. Because it was quickly\ndark. I remember this was autumn and it was very cold. Before I tried to do my best and it was\nyou know, everybody had a place. You had to -- then I met also this Ukrainian Andre. He was\nAndre also and he came to me with some , you know he wanted to give me, he\nfound that we were staying also in very good friendship.\nQ. Were there any other gay boys?\nA. In Stum I didn't find no gay boys, no Jews. In the same, no Jews. Only in\nKoronovo.\nQ. When were you ordered to ?\nA. It was maybe December -- before -- maybe December 1944. Yes, I was sent there and it\nwas very fine block meister there. He sent me immediately to the job, the magazine. You know,\nwhere the dresses of the prisoners there. It was a rather good job because I was not so -- and\nthen I met in Stum, I met also Hendrick. This was from Holland and we in Stum we worked also\ntogether. I was a friend with this Hendrick and when we came to he was\nsleeping behind me because we have two beds, down and upstairs so that he was not gay. And\nhe knew I was gay because in and in later, it was written exactly paragraph 175, and\nhe knew that. There was maybe for young prisoners, tolerated. They knew and sometimes they\njoked about me.\nQ. What kind?\nA. (in German. )\nQ. Tell me a story in German what they joked about.\nA. (Speaks in German)\nQ. Why was Hendrick in Stum?\nA. I don't know exactly what the reason. I suppose maybe -- I don't know exactly. I cannot\nremember. For my reason everybody knew very quickly. But the others, the\nknew. He had the stolen in the pocket, for the , the family sent, and he was hungry.\nHe for this reason, it was very strong punishment, but Hendrick I don't know.\nQ. How were the guards treating you at Stum?\nA. The guards? As I told you, twice very bad especially the one when he came to the lazaret\nand it would you think it is here sanitary we're called which means horse |\nand the other one went with us with this group to work for the front, he was very sharp.\nSometimes somebody found something. I don't know when Andre found this it\nwas some kind of beating for this you could -- I don't know maybe he thought he didn't see it,\nbecause he was very, very --. At the end when they feel that the Russian front is coming they\nchanged a little bit. We had days where we walked more kindly, not without the shouting. This\nis the reason they felt that the end of the war was near.\nQ. Was this already in Stum?\nA. No, no, in . In it started then in . It was\nSunday, yes, I remember, one day Sunday. I was in this magazine and we had to take and to\nmake because the snow, and it was so the atmosphere was very very hectic. They feel that the\nwar maybe the Russians are coming.\nQ. How long did you stay in ?\nA. To the end. After this came the Russian soldiers. So, that it was in winter, half of\nJanuary 1945.\nQ. How many people were all together in do you know\u2019?\nA. Let's say maybe three or four hundred. When we were sent from the ;\nthere were two groups, two groups, and it was in winter. We had to go by foot and they give us\nattention. When we tried to escape they will shoot immediately. They stopped only from time to\ntime in some , to sleep there. We had sleep only on the straw so without nothing. I\nremember it was winter, very cold. When we slept there even there was between the wood the\nwind with snow would come in and you wake and you had plenty of snow. But butter there\ninstead.\nQ. Did anyone try to escape?\nA. Yes, tried, and we don't know what happened. Many, many tried. Maybe succeed or\nmaybe not succeed. I don't know. We, when I escaped, we escaped we succeeded.\nQ. Do you remember if anybody tried to escape from Stum?\nA. No, no.\nQ. And from ?\nA. No. It was too difficult. Probably nobody could in that. You see there was so surround\nand with they were watching and in concentration camp there was also the electricity. You\ncouldn't do that.\nQ. Can you describe the electricity?\nA. Around the -- it was in because in were barracks. The\nbarracks were specially built for us, I think so, because too many prisons were there. There was\nno place and it was kind of a before. And they make this for the security, for\nthemselves.\nQ. Were they wooden barracks or stone barracks?\nA. Wooden. Wooden barracks. I was never after the war, I don't believe. Because even I\nwanted to find this certain Torran. What is also my -- this house is very bad. It's standing there.\nThe baker house is standing, the prison is there, the documentation from the foundation\nwhen he go there I will show them. They will make a documentation because\nme, I'm 71, maybe tomorrow or after tomorrow I'll die and there will be no documentation. It\nmust be for the young people.\nI can forgive but not forget, especially for the young. They must know how it was difficult in the\nwar and what for, for what reason. Only for the fact that I like men. From the beginning, I'm not\nthe child of God. I was born, -- I didn't know when things happened. Maybe just the first time\nwhen ---, but it was playing. I didn't know. First, even as I told you it was not so\nsuffocated, it was in very childish way, a rather romantic way. Now, I know\neverything. Iam old and I read book. Of course it should be like I had no advantages. Not only\nadvantages, I even had three times friends because I like not to jump from one flower to another\none. I had good friends. Even just know in Poland, but he's married and this is more difficult.\nQ. It must have been also very difficult for you to go through all these years because you\nwere very young. How did you manage. Where did you get the strength to get through it?\nA. (Answers in German.) I lost my hope that I will stay alive. And especially in Koronovo,\nI had to be also absent in the bed or I felt that I forget to say how many insects there were. I\ndon't know exactly the names of these, even the lice, but you know, it's terrible. I prayed and I\nwas So -- it was for me sometimes if I should be dead. Sometimes I wished to be dead. You see,\nthen in Stum, and this again, I wanted to stay to alive and I feel that even in Stum, one day came\nvery good information that in Warsaw, this uprising, it was in August -- I'll\nnever forget, it was August 1944, came information to everybody the Polish, you know in\nWarsaw, and I said \"Oh my God, maybe it will be the end of the war.\" So, sometimes when\ncame the news it was just great for us.\nQ. Could you describe a day in and how looked?\nA. Of course I can. The barracks were let's say maybe 20 for each -- in each barracks were\nliving in two divided bigger rooms, 40 or 30 prisoners. There were also one barrack for the\nkitchen, one barrack is for the magazine. One was for the tailor and for workers like wooden\nwork. What's more there, maybe -- and around the barracks as I told you was some of that\nsound, the electrician wire. They said I don't know, I'm not sure but they blackmailed us, if\nsomebody tried they will pay with their life. Each corner was a tower, a watch tower. He\nwas with a gun and that was -- and we had each day for half an hour we have to walk because\nyou need fresh air and during the walking I met this = \u2014\u2014\u2014s~who told me I'll follow you. It was\nthis and --\nQ. When did you have to get up?\nA. It was morning, very early. It was about six o'clock. First we have to bring this way, and\nto wash there was everything, washing in cold water of course. And not in the same barrack\nwhere you were sleeping privately. There was a barrack for washing. And you came to your\nbarrack and the brought you some kind of soup. It was soup like water and a piece of\nbread. Everybody -- for me came the block meister. He took me to magazine. Me and Hendrick\nwe were together. We had a job we have to in the magazine make the order with the dresses and\nto describe the names for everybody because everybody has private dressing.\nAfter that afternoon, they came again. We stood there in this barrack. There was no\ncentral heating. We had only through -- they gave us wood, but it was warm rather, so long as\nyou put the wood. It was warm. Sometimes the guard would bring some kind of tea that\nsomebody put in the water. Some they drank, but only prisoners who had a special contact with\nsomebody. I had no contact so I couldn't do nothing. I was living, as I told you, with Hendrick.\nHe was upstairs. He was working for the tailor.\nQ. Did your mother know where you were?\nA. At this moment, she knew. She had received information that I'm -- but I never saw her.\nIt was not allowed to visit to come, no, but she knew and we have also family, relations in\nprobably across the river somebody has seen me and wrote to my mother that I am\nalive, but she told me later, when we talked, after my return from Germany, she said somebody\nsaid I am alive and she wasn't sure exactly, but her hope was a little better. First when I wrote\nthe first letter after the war, she was completely sure that I was alive.\nQ. You were not allowed to write letters during the time you were in prison?\nA. Yes. In ,. don't know. I'm not exactly -- yes, probably we could. Maybe\nonly letters, you understand, but at the end of the war when we left this, she -- she didn't receive\nany information from . Only the last, maybe from Stum or maybe I don't know. It\nwas too long time ago.\nQ. Did you receive letters from her?\nA. If I had I would like to have the documentation. What I have some very nice proof that is\nin Koronovo when I was in better position, I had some relation with some other prisoners who\nworked in cafeteria, and they make very nice friends. I send this so some of\nprisoners they were sent to make the job outside the prison. How did I do that? I paid, of course,\nwith bread and they sent to my mother and this friend I have -- and I put a picture of my mother\nthere and from foundation he was before he came here he was home he made a picture.\nQ. So you must have felt very isolated in these years not knowing how your family was, if\nthey were alive?\nA. Listen, you know, my father was not home and I loved my mother over everything, and I\ncouldn't help. I had seen how she suffered when my brother was only one month. She had\nsuffered so much, I have seen this. She cried, \"Why you give me this?\" You must understand\nthat this painful on mother. She was so happy when I returned. Therefore, I tried to go as soon\nas it was possible and I am correct, so about -- I was together. I was living in Warsaw. All\nholidays, Christmas I spent with her and I help so that in this way I'm correct and satisfied. She\nsuffered. She spent you know so she has -- I was the youngest, but then there came another one\nwhich she loved very much. Even after the war when we talked sometimes, she told me that a\nneighbor, she was something talking, and they asked \"What is the reason you?\" She said, \"I\ndon't know.\" But probably I thing so that the gay, Sigmund, maybe he said something. What\nhappened with him, I don't know. Maybe he said something. Afterwards everybody knew. But\nmy mother, she was very simple. She finished only four classes, but she never said to me \"It's all\nmy fault, or this is the reason.\" She had to suffer. No, she never said this.\nQ. Can you tell us when in , when the Russian army approached, what\nhappened?\nA. In what happened? When we had to go, it was Sunday, a very strong\nwinter. Everybody was in a hurry and then we had to pack as much as we could. Most of them\nthere was , and we went first through the frozen. I met some\nPolish, they wanted to keep up. Maybe the people, they were members of my family, but I\ncouldn't recognize. I didn't remember exactly. Then we had to go. They shouted always, \"Don't\nstop. If you stop, you'll see you'll die.\" Because it was twenty degrees below zero. It was very\ncold. I was very tired. I wanted to stop I'm sure. If I would fall, I could die immediately. You\nwere frozen. You were tired. You better go, go, go. And always they shouted don't escape. If\nyou escape, you'll pay. We'll shoot. Then because we had to count always. Always, lists, lists,\nlists.\nQ. Did also people die on this march?\nA. During the march I cannot no-- I'm not sure. I don't know. I remember only that the last\nday, there was not in this , only the school, a little warmer and then they said we\nwill be going by train. It was not normal for person to -- it was for animals and we haven't seen\nnothing. They stopped sometimes and there was . I don't know and when we\narrived in Hamberg but how they put us to the island. I remember only that the next day we have\nto go to work. The work, it was in the meadow and I remember that there were some French\nprisoners and they took at the beginning this is the green and they ate this. No, I know, this is\nvery good. And it was 28th of February, rather a little warmer but not so warmer, and they\npicked up this and they ate it so I remember.\nAfter a few days they needed some pigs. They were not for us, only for the staff for the\nblock meister. And they needed somebody. I wonder, I never worked before in this way. It was\nvery difficult because you had to make clean always. The pig were --, you have to do this. But I\nwas satisfied because I share with the pig some how you call it -- this is a kind of flavor in\npotatoes and I took, I could be full and not so hungry.\nQ. Do you remember anything from the train, how many days you had been in the train?\nA. No. There was something, water. We left to go by boat, not ship, but I don't remember.\nThis is from me just now. I knew only that the prisoners said we have run the water. He knew\nthat there is a special, it was a kind of boat and this is how you put this with the rope so that we\ncould go to the other side. But we were very anxious that somebody would shoot us. Probably it\nwas 15 miles. They knew that they didn't want to do something.\nQ. What was the name of this prison?\nA. ;\nQ. How many people were there?\nA. I don't know. When it -- it was near of Hamberg and Hamberg was always bombed, very\noften. During this bombing they opened always the door of the cell. Probably if something\nhappened -- I don't know. It was opened but nobody escaped. I had seen only in the windows,\nyou know, it was not far of this place, Hamberg.\nQ. Were you there together with people that you knew?\nA. No, no. In Hamberg, in this a cell for one, only for one. Very small.\nQ. Did you know anyone there?\nA. No. You see, when I worked with the pigs, only me alone and still alone. The few Polish\nI met during the marching morning when we had to march to take this fresh air.\nQ. (In German)\nA. No. Maybe he escaped or maybe he was there because the last time I seen he was very ill\nin , and I don't know what happened.\nQ. How did you escape from this prison?\nA. From ?\nQ. Yes.\nA. I remember I had to go and pick up for the pig , you know, because this 1s\nvitamins. It was so very bad job. My hands were always, you know. I'm making this and the\nthree Polish boys were saying, \"We're, escaping. Would you like to go?\" \"Of course, me too.\" I\nleft this cart and I joined them. They knew probably. They had prepared. Then we went, there\nwas small boat, and as I told you this boat had no for this, only rope. Maybe they\nknew it was not so far. It was maybe ten minutes and we were so lucky when we jumped off\nthis, we are now free. But we are hungry. First, we went to a and I spoke very\ngood German. I put that I'm from this and it was May and it was not so cold. One night we\nspent in the meadow. We slept there. We found some old clothes and I put a shirt and trousers\nlike from the prison without the stripes and me and the other ones, especially the ones who lives\nin , was near of Torran and we went to . He give us eating\neverything and he said okay, we said then that we are how we call this, they say\n, that we are and he says I need two jobs you can stay\nhere, but because I had the experience with the pigs, he wanted me too. But we say we would\nlike maybe we stay just a short time when we hear the news from our country, exactly and I\nsuppose he said something because after you eat, better you go. Probably he had the feeling\nsomething wrong because it was not far from this . Maybe he had recognized\nour trousers. So he said, you eat and go. Then we walked in the direction of .\nWe found some trucks with soldiers and even Polish in British uniforms were written Poland.\nThen I stopped, I shouted Polish, Polish here.\" And there was an officer and I told him that we\nare here that we are from the Prison. Please take here a seat we'll bring you to a special Polish\ndisplacement. And they brought us to some place a village. The Germans had to live from there\nin some houses and were living in . I remember very good this place\nnear of . We were living there with the Polish people. Some\nwere from the forced work and we have received from British soldiers. We had to cook because\nwe are living in the houses of Germans. The Germans had to leave for us. But the Polish people,\ninstead to work the soldiers they maybe will work in the garden everything. They do nothing so\nthey send us to Birken Belsun. Birken Belsun was also near of Linnenberg. Many Jews there\nwere but not now the prisoners free. We are living in the because the barracks\nwere destroyed I suppose. In this I didn't feel well because we couldn't go out.\nLike in prison, I had enough prison. So, this boy from and another one he said,\n\"See we go out.\" It was not like in prison. We heard that there were some transports of soldiers\nto south of Germany, and we went.\nI'll never forget it was in Hanover, I think so, and there was black American and I told\nhim that I only German. He allowed us to come in. He came some things of food and soon by\nthis truck, this train, we went to Munich because the transport of Americans went to Munich.\nWhen we arrived at Munich, I said I will stay here. From Munich it is not far to Vienna\nto my friend. I will take that but the first steps, the Americans said you must go here to the\nJudenrot. It was in . They made a special office. We went there. We said we\nhave written and we signed and we have received the displaced card. I have also here the\noriginal displaced card.\nAnd from there, the Americans sent me immediately to the hospital because they had\nseen my leg. When I was fit, I wanted to go to Poland but I received the bad news from Poland\nthat there are Russians. To Vienna I couldn't go also Russian and without working to be, then I\nstarted to work. First I received in Munich as kitchen help. It was very good. Then as a waiter I\nworked also in Dachau. In Dachau there was the war crimes for officers. It was a very nice job.\nThen I worked there until the end of my stay. When I wanted to go to Poland the American said\n\"Stay better here.\" And I received very nice recommendation. I have it in English here. He\nwrote, \"Any recommendation will be . He worked and he's going at his own\nrequest.\"\nQ. The first time when you met this British soldiers and afterwards, did any of them ask you\nwhy you exactly were in prison?\nA. No.\nQ. Did you tell anyone?\nA. The Americans, no.\nQ. Why not?\nA. You see, first of all, as I told you, this is -- I didn't know this word. I said what for\nbecause I loved a German soldier. Stupid reason. Nobody could believe me. Now, if I was to\nanswer, \"I was a homosexual.\" But at this time I was sometimes I thought in my head, what for?\nI didn't kill anyone. I was in very good friendship with some of the soldiers, this is the reason I\nhave to go to prison? When they asked me -- they didn't ask me. I told all of them I was in\nprison. There was nothing given to this question. This was nothing. A displaced person. They\nfound me my country 1s Poland and Iam in Germany. The war is to end and I am in Germany.\nQ. Do you know what happened to Willie?\nA. This is so complicated. Me, together with Lutz VanDyke, we tried to research\neverywhere. In Poland, in Germany, in Austria, and with no news, nothing. But you see, I have\nalso this document. I received, it's stupid. The same name and everything is okay, even the age\nshould be maybe the same, Willie Goetz. Only the question is he was born not in Austria, in\nGermany. It was written in German and what's more it is written that he is dead at the beginning\n-- | was arrested in '42, and he's dead in '43. During the war -- I'm not sure. I have this\ndocument. Thanks to VanDyke. I have to state he helped me a lot. Through him I received\neven the document that I was in the prison from this and this time. When I went to no security,\nfor insurance, for this time for the three years, -- longer because they give a better date, but for\nthree years they came to the tailor and I have just a little more, but first when I went for this\ndocument. It should be translated, but this translator who writes for this translation, and for me\nthey said, \"You received this from Germany? This exception, they never send this.\" Yes,\nthrough a very good friend, I said.\nMany things, he has done for me a lot. I am with him in very good friendship. He visited\nme. I'm staying always in contact. You must know I was very ill. One month ago I wanted to\ncancel my trip to America and he called me always. He wanted to send me money because I had\nkidney stones. Our health service is very bad. They sent me to the hospital and I knew in the\nhospital very bad service. They should cut me immediately and I didn't want, so I have a little\nmoney for this addition and from this money I make everything private. The special laser and it\nwas private. I paid a lot of money for it because I suffered for four weeks. Then I thought I\ncould do this. Even before I came here, first from the foundation, one of the gentlemen came to\nme. He wanted to make the picture. He made this frame of my mother. He made some\ndocuments for the documentary. He brought me from one letter from young boy.\nI never seen him, a very nice written letter. He wrote me, \"Dear Mr. Stefan, I'm astonished that -\n--\" T regret that I didn't bring this letter here --\"I'm astonished that you never hated us. You have\nsuffered so much. I read your book. I found your story very good but very touching. I want to\nhelp you if you need help then please ...\"\nQ. Did you have difficulty later on from the years you were in prison physically?\nA. Of course, many. Liver and heart. With liver always. I'm taking medicine every day.\nBut thanks in Hamberg he sent me always. This medicine I couldn't buy and not to pay because\nin Poland it would be too low, it would be not enough. Like he had private. You know I paid for\nthis the last time I was ill about ten million lotas. It is in dollars about $1,000 I had to pay\neverything private. He called me always, take private. Do this. If you need more I'll send you.\nThe last time he sent me a very nice letter and said you are going here and I am to Moscow\nbecause he works in the Ann Frank Foundation. He knows me well. He know how I suffered.\nWe worked together on this book so that we are like brothers. He knows my sorrows also and\nwe plan in the springtime I would like to make a report of my visit here in the United States of\nAmerica.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4\nQ. How did you feel about what happened?\nA. Sometimes I'm wondering that I'm still alive. That I succeed and sometimes I'm\nwondering what kind of reason that the people that do are ever able to torture the young people\nlike me. I am catholic, I forgive but forget I cannot. I cannot. Sometimes there are very heavy\nscars even now. On Sunday I was invited to American friends. They never spoke. I have to tell\nthem and in some places my voice was broke because it is everything fresh. Even during the\nwriting of this book and when I read this book I cried because I have everything\nespecially twice. When I see my mother always standing watching the prison. She didn't see me\nbut she came. She wanted to see me. I saw her, but she couldn't. Then the judge, it was terrible.\nBut, with my soul I'm correct that I return back. I could be here. Maybe I could have\nhere very good possibility for everything and maybe I would even be millionaire but I spend my\ntime with my parents and especially with my mother. She suffered so much, and the only thing\neven the education from the child she learned me how I have to be good and honest to other\npeople. If somebody did wrong I think then she said don't you think and always my teacher\nwhen I was going to the school after the war, I have to finish my examination once it was written\nwhat I could do if I could. And I was written against all enemies. I'll never forget this teacher\nshe wrote, \"The word is very good, but don't forget enemy is destruction.\" And I know this 1s for\n-- itis very good that the young German people they cannot take the responsibilities for the old,\nfor the Nazis but they are so good and I'm so touched when I receive so many letters and the\ncritique was so good. In all German languages, the reception of this book was fantastic. I'm sure\nit will be the same here.\nAs you know, yesterday, when we had this small journal interview, many ladies, they\ncame to me. They gave me business cards. They want to stay in contact. They want also to\nprint in the gay news, they want to show the world that the war and the stupid rules of the war in\nNazi time must be over, never again. Never.\nQ. When you were in Poland you didn't talk about your experiences?\nA. I couldn't. During this I couldn't, I had to lie. I said always I was in the prison and you\nknow the reason I give . Because if I did, I couldn't find job. It was\nfor gays, it was very bad time. I suppose they knew something, there is something wrong\nbecause even I finish my studies but I couldn't receive very good position. First of all, I was\nalways single. This 1s no good. Second, I was so long time in until 1947.\nUsually everybody returned and me not. I know that sometimes even in some works where I was\nworking especially they collaborate with the communists by drinking vodka they said you are so\nclever and you are so good, but you have something. You cannot advance. I knew the reason\nwas maybe this, that I was a gay, a homosexual. That was the reason.\nQ. Did you meet anyone later --?\nA. Yes, I met in Torran. I was also in Koronovo but that even the last time I was in Torran\nwith some of them was working in the war house and my brother went to him. He gave us a very\nbad time because he had some better quality goods or like that. Ihave seen him. I have met\nthree. One was the doctor, he was living in Warsaw but he's now dead. About three, I met, gay,\nfrom Koronovo.\nQ. Did they say the same thing about what it's like to be gay men?\nA. There were more, but after the war I met them in Torran and one in ,\nQ. So there were a lot of gay men in prison in Koronovo?\nA. Not so many, but there -- especially from Torran. As somebody told me there were about\n80 to 100 people arrested for homosexuality in Torran. I didn't know that in small place so many\nbut he told me so.\nQ. Who told you?\nA. The doctor. He knew, I know his name but it's not necessary. I know his first name\nbecause he was also in Warsaw and I met him very often and he told me. He had the possibility\nto see the documents because he was working there as a doctor together with the German block\nmeister but he finished before the war. He was educated as a doctor. He could work there.\nQ. Did you ever talk to the family about the years?\nA. Never, and they gave me never chance to speak about it and to feel it. I'm sure they\nknew, my brother, but only you see one sister she said to me, he's probably like\nyou because he's married and he has no children and I'm sure that he's also that. I'm sure maybe\nhe was also gay but it was little discovered because my sister said everything he had he wrote in\nthe last will to one young boy, that was in village and his wife once told me also when I met her\nin Torran that she could receive a divorcement when she go to the church because she doesn't\nsleep together with people like this. So maybe it was the same in family. I think so.\nQ. Did you talk with your parents or brother about what you went through in the prison?\nA. No, no, we like it this subject -- even when we went to other families, oh you spent some\ntime in prison what was the reason and I said, don't talk about it, this was a very bad time, don't\nmention it.\nQ. Did you tell your mother about the conditions in the prison?\nA. Oh no, I couldn't to make her -- no, no, never. I tried to do my best. Even when I was a\nstudent and came to my mother she went to bake and brought me some bread. She showed me\nthat she loved me. This subject was omitted.\n(Looking at pictures) That's me. I think I was ten years old and it was in Torran. This is\nthe main street opposite of the municipal house. This 1s the Monument.\nThat was my last holiday in Torran near . I was with Polish friends and I\nbake a cod fish which I succeed without a card, free of ration. I was here about sixteen years old.\nIt was my last holiday.\nIt's me when I was working in theater as a gypsy in operetta. That was before when I was\nsitting and this made a picture. It was not on the stage it was in the .\nThis is very important documents. This is my displaced card which I received from\nAmerican in Munich. The both sides, the first one and the other side it's very important. It has\neverything written that I am a displaced person.\nIt is written in English so that everybody knows that this is a displaced person's card and\nit's use.\nThat's me. I was here about 23, 22, no 21, maybe 21 or 22 when I was working for\nAmerican as a waiter in Dachau. There is description \"Kitchen number so and so.\" It was in\nDachau as a waiter.\nThat was in Munich when I was working as kitchen help together with a Polish guard.\nThey are working as a guard for American soldiers. He was Polish but in American uniform.\nThis is in Munich. I was here probably 21. Behind me is this house where I was living\nthere. You see how the house it's windows were without glasses. So looked Munich after the\nwar.\nThis is the documents when I was working for the American military as kitchen help as a\nwaiter.\nThis is also one document more during my work by American in Munich.\nThis is my certificate of my working as a waiter in Munich or Dachau as a waiter for\nAmerican soldiers. And there is a translation into German the same. It was my last job.\nThis is very important documents. It is the part of my documents in all the prison. I\nreceived these documents after researching five or more years and there is everything written.\nOnly something is very, very stupid because it is mentioned \"Nation unknown.\" How it is\npossible to write \"Nation unknown.\" I was arrested as a Pole. I was beaten as a Pole and they\nmention unknown. It is a stupid part of the document but I couldn't correct it because I was glad\nto receive this very important document. This is the proof that I was in the prison so long time.\nIt is there written. Everybody can see here that I was punished for five years of prison and that\nwas so long that I have to be in the prison until December 1947. It means that longer than the\nwar, but thank God I escaped and I was free earlier.\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Answer: Yes, I do this. My name is Teofil Kosinski, Polish, but for Americans it may be a\nlittle difficult to pronounce, Kosinsk1i, so it's better I say Toffi Kosinsk1.\nI was born in Poland, in Torran. This is a Polish name, and in German it was Torran. I\nwas born on the first of January 1925, so in one month I will be 71 years old.\nQ. Did you go to school also in Torran and what did your parents do?\nA. I finished my ordinary school, seven classes, in Torran. My parents -- my father worked\non the railroad and my mother worked from time to time cleaning some houses.\nWe were together five children and my mother and father. Until the war, until the first of\nFebruary 1929, we were living in the railroad blocks. We had three rooms, but two rooms were\nrented always because the salary of my father was very low to feed the whole family.\nQ. You speak also very well German. Why\u2019?\nA. You see, in Torran were many German people. Even my parents had to go to the school,\nto German school so that before the war I learned a little German from German people, and just a\nlittle home because from time to time my parents if they wanted to speak in secrets before me\nthey tried to speak in German.\nQ. And do you understand what they were telling?\nA. No, no, I couldn't. I was so angry. \"Mamma, why you speak?\" And she laughed and it\nwas so funny, but then when Hitler came I had to try to speak and to learn because I knew that\nwas very important for me.\nQ. How were you raised -- in which religion were you raise\nA. I was catholic. I am catholic and that's all. I was educated in this religion. When I was\ngoing to the school -- we had also because in Torran were some Jews. I had two friends at my\nschool but during the religion lesson they went out.\nQ. Do you remember their names?\nA. In Torran school not, but later I had some friends after the war that I met. Titlebaum.\nHe's now in Israel. He left Israel in 1968 probably he's still alive. Maybe when I will be in Israel\nI will find him. It will be a great pleasure for me.\nQ. I don't know Torran at all. Can you describe how it looked during your childhood when\nyou grew up and your family --?\nA. Yes, I try. It was a wonderful time. It still is wonderful, very old city. Some people\ncalled this town . It is from the old century, middle age city. A most gothic,\nbeautiful old churches and the music house also very nice. This place, the Torran was the place\nborn . It was very famous. You remember maybe or you know something\nbefore the war Hitler had in the place of , before it was a corridor, they called\nit, the train passed from Germany through Torran to Dank. So, me, as a child, I ran very often\nthis train. I followed. I asked for sweets something and the Germans gave me.\nQ. Do you remember in your early childhood, like when you went to school, was there any\ntensions between yourself, catholic, or Jews in Torran, or did you never notice anything?\nA. No, I noticed. In Torran, not very Jews but the Jews that are, are very kind and very\ngood. Even we, we made shopping by company by . My father was, as I told you,\na railroad worker, so if we like to buy something, some dressing, some clothing, we received\nfrom him especially . It was very convenient for us because cash to pay it was very\ndifficult. I played with the two boys and I went home and I like the cuisine, the Jewish cuisine.\nWe had some restaurants and to me personally when I was young, I worked not only be German\nI had it also to some Jews some restaurants only -- I met with them shopping. So, I had money\nbecause I should never holidays, instead to go like holidays like all the children to spend a nice\ntime I had to work.\nQ. Your family didn't have a lot of money?\nA. No, I told you. Even my mother -- we had three rooms, nice rooms but one room was\nalways rented. They were given to the window for rent. It was also not good because sometimes\nthey changed. Sometimes it was very good, sometimes it was very bad. Sometimes she didn't\nreceive money for it. It depends there are different people.\nQ. And you went to school -- how was your school career?\nA. You see, I finished this ordinary school. It was exactly in 1939 and I remember in June.\nThen my parents wanted me, personally, because I had not talent but I had very good knowledge\nand the teacher said to my mother and to my father that 1t should be very good when they send\nme to the gymnasium. And my parents decided our son must finish just a little high school. So, I\ntried to make examination and I passed very good notes. I was the third on the list, and my\nmother ordered a new suit for the gymnasium. I had the uniform and we couldn't pay\nimmediately so we ordered it exactly like my so the suit could be paid for for a few\nmonths. Then came the war and I never went to the gymnasium. I never wear this nice uniform.\nI gave it back to this tailor because I didn't use it and we couldn't pay. So, my further education\nwas finished. Since the war it was absolutely forbidden for the Polish people to go to the school.\nQ. Do you remember the day in 1939? Can you tell us exactly?\nA. Of course, I remember very well. It was on the third of September, morning --no it was\non the first of September. I was in the market. Usually I went very early before going to the\nschool, and I helped some German farmers to put vegetables on the market. They paid me also\nwith some vegetables and it was very hard for my mother. I returned home. We heard the\nsignals and my mother said, \"Oh my God, the war began.\" She has seen -- many people had seen\na cross on the sky oral like this because my mother spent the first war, she had the experience\nand she said, \"No, never in our life a second war.\" But the second war began.\nAnd then, on the third of September, it was Sunday, I'll never forget it. My father has to\ngo to Warsaw to fight against the Germans. He has received three months salary. He left his\nmoney to my mother. My mother took the money. She took special -- not in paper money only\nin coins, use silver because she said she had experience. Paper money would not be valid. The\ncoins will be valid, just silver.\nSo, the third of September, from our family from village they came with the horse and\nhow we call it this car -- with horse, and they took us from the village because everybody afraid\nthat they will come, the bombs will come, and we want to be hidden there so that we went to the\nvillage with our family with our family to be more surely there than in the city of Torran.\nQ. Did you return to Torran?\nA. Not so early. First me, brother, everybody, we were there and the village but maybe after\ntwo weeks after we heard that in Torran are the German soldiers, my mother asked me and my\nolder brother has to go to this house and try to prove that everything is okay because during the\nabsence could happen everything. We had returned. We seen soldiers, some soldiers in the\nbeginning were very kind. They tried to give soups and\nbreads because in the soups we had nothing. I took some breads even and I went by foot with\nmy brother to the village and I told mother, \"Come on. There is no reason to sit here. We must\ngo home. The soldiers are not so bad. Maybe the war will be not so long.\" And we returned to\nthe same place to the nice house where we lived before.\nQ. Did you stay in this house during the war?\nA. Oh, only maybe two months we were living there in the same house, but then once they\ncame there, the soldiers, by some patrol, I couldn't recall because I was very young, and said you\nmust leave this house. Oh my mother began to cry but where are we to go. We are living so\nlong here. Don't make a . You must leave. We are giving you a few hours time but\nfirst she would like to know where. You will receive a good flat. We went with my brother.\nWe had seen this replacement for us. It was terrible, but it was what we had to do. It was an\norder. So, we tried to take as much as was possible and we went to this new house. It wasn't a\nhouse, maybe it should be called shed maybe because it wa only -- we had three rooms and now\nmy mother said it is more easier to move from a worse place to better than to on the contrary,\nfrom the better to the worse. Here it was only one room house, with small kitchen, a dark\nkitchen. There was no water inside. There was no water, toilet outside, no cellar, nothing, but\nwhat we had to do was to leave and to stay and thank God we had received this because some\npeople they were put on the street.\nQ. Why had you to leave the house and how many other people had to leave the houses in\nTorran?\nA. The only reason was that we are Polish. This was the reason. It was too nice to us. They\nput it immediately German families from Germany. Sometime, because we were living in --\nacross sometimes we look out the window. It was very difficult to just living here and the people\nfrom Germany took our flat.\nQ. How did you support yourself and how did the family support themselves in the\nfollowing months?\nA. Usually all young people were sent to the force camp to Germany. My brother -- before\nthe war was one or two years he learned not as baker for some sweet things, but baker and so he\nworked by this baker and once he came to me he said you see, it's better you take the job by\n. It is also baker and I have some friends there. It will be very good job and\nmaybe it you will not go to Germany to the force camp.\nAnd I went to this bakery. I remember he was very nice tall man. I didn't speak so good\nGerman. I tried to speak German but this German he was living in Poland so he could speak\nPolish too. First, he refused to speak Polish but when he seen that I try but I couldn't he started\nwith me speak Polish. I told him that we have very difficult situation. My father is not here. I\nhave younger sisters and brother. We have to help mother. I would like to work because I heard\nthat there is wanted a boy his\nbakery. He called his wife. She looked at me probably I was good for -- I looked well. She\nagreed and soon I was employed there as a delivery boy. This kind of job I had to go by bicycle.\nI had on my back a basket with bread and every morning very early I brought this bread to some\nGerman hospitals, to German shops and to some private houses.\nQ. Were you disappointed that you were not allowed to go to school? How old were you?\nA. I heard this immediately. It was written, we had many times some special how you call\nthis on the streets, there was written, at the first in the beginning it was written in German and in\nPolish . I don't know in English how it was. I went\nto the school but the door was closed and it was only for German children. I knew immediately I\ncouldn't go.\nQ. Were you disappointed?\nA. Of course because I was so glad I started to study. I wanted to be as we called in Poland,\neven in Torran, one mensch. My mother, my father said I will take from a month and put to him\nfor his schooling, one of our family must be a mensch. _I think in comparing with other people,\nit was maybe in the beginning not so bad for us because as I told you I was working as a delivery\nboy for a baker. So, I could receive even for my payment, my salary was not so high. I\nremember it was only five marks per week, but I received some bread and it was very important\nbecause the food was rationed especially for Polish people. We had received -- what I\nremember, there was one pound of meat per month including bones. You can understand it was\nnothing. It was with some soldiers also. Sometimes we wondered she prepared some dishes, of\ncourse meat was maybe two or once per month, but she prepared this or that so things that my\nmama, she was very practical and we were not hungry. In the beginning I thought and my\nbrother bought so that our family didn't be hungry.\nQ. You said there were Polish people from Torran sent from Germany. Do you remember\nstories, do you know people who were sent to Germany for forced labor?\nA. Oh, yes. Even my friends from the school they were sent to . For\nthe first time I had received letters, I also have at home he sent me picture how he had to work in\n, how very hard, and very -- they had here a -- Polish, this is in Poland and he\nwrote me so that I could read the conditions were very, very hard. So, therefore I tried to do my\nbest only to stay to work for this baker instead to go there, to Germany.\nQ. Did he write you where he was -- was he kind of imprisoned in a work camp or did he\nwork for --?\nA. That was forced labor, . He was sent, many Polish people were sent. Some\nof Polish families were sent to this . It's called because we were born in Torran.\nWho was born in Torran the Germans they kept them there, but who wasn't born there, they sent\nto the district . Maybe it was better. We would like also to go there, but we\ncouldn't. We had to stay in Torran.\nQ. Do you know why?\nA. Why we had to stay? I don't know, maybe they wanted to make us German. I don't\nknow. I don't know why.\nQ. Those friends of yours who were sent to , Where did they live in\n\u2014\nA. Oh, I never seen him. Then I went -- my study later, I never seen him.\nQ. But when he did write the letter, did he tell you -- did he live in a house?\nA. Oh, no, together with horses. Together with horses. Their food was very bad. They had\nto take him from the fields some row of carrots or this to feed because they were so hungry. You\nsee, I tried to do everything not only to go there. Some of them they escaped but when they were\ncaught, they put them in the prison.\nQ. How old were you when you started to work for the German baker and did you stay\nworking for him all the time?\nA. Yes, I tell you. When I was fourteen years old I worked for this baker, and I worked, let's\nsee, 1941, I worked there. But it was so that during the war for young people, no chance, life\nwas so boring we couldn't go -- there was cinema but for German people only. There was the\narts but for German people only. We had nothing. We had to stay home from eight o'clock\nevening until six o'clock in the morning. It was how we call curfew. You couldn't walk. You\ncan't imagine. It is summer, a very nice time. Evening it's dark first at 10:00 and you have to be\nhome. What we have done. There was a small place, we took our chairs, from all people, we\nwere sitting there to spend in the fresh air because we couldn't go on the street. One time when I\nwas delivering the bread to the hospital, I pass, always the theater. I was very keen for theater\nbecause I like very much music. I like to sing, even in the school. And then I have seen there\nwas written \"Chorus singers wanted.\" I think \"Oh my God, maybe I could go there.\" First I\nwonder and ask was me as a Polish can I do it. They look at me because I'm very young. I was\n16 years old and first he said, \"You want to be singer? You still have this mutation, this change\nof voice.\" I said, \"No, no, I finish my mutation. I would like to sing.\" Okay. We employ also\nPoles, but the examination will be at this and this time. I asked to write to fill my name and after\ntwo days I went there. I remember Mr. Veber, not so old, but a very good man and he gave the\nexamination, first on the piano and then he asked me sing something. German songs I didn't\nknow and I asked, \"May I sing Polish?\" \"Yes. You can do this.\" I never forget I sang a very\nnice Polish old song. He liked it. It was very nice. I translate it soon as I could and he said to\nme, \"Go away, wait.\" I don't know. Maybe he asked somebody. Maybe the commission makes\nsome discussion. Anyhow, after one hour he said okay, you will be our chorus singer. Your\nvoice 1s correct, very good, only the question you must work here only as an extra task. It will\nnot be main work. I didn't understand what he meant. You will work afternoon and evening and\nthe other job you have you must keep it. Okay, I agreed. I went home. I said to my mother, my\nmother, oh, it will be too difficult for you, two jobs. And maybe the will not be\nsatisfied that you are working in theater. The night will be too short for you. But I insisted, my\nmother, it will be everything okay. I will keep this job and this job and believe me it will be\npossible. Okay, do as you like. And so I worked in theater and I worked in the bakery.\nQ. You stayed working for the baker?\nA. Not all time, but in the beginning I was working yes, I was working bakery and theater.\nThe theater was very nice. I like this climate, this atmosphere. There were dancers, singers, nice\npeople. In the theater you could forget, you see, the war, and especially for me, I had no chance,\nnothing, no cafes, just no -- it was war time boring. During the evening it was dark, closed\nhouse, no gas lamps nothing. War. Exactly war. So, when I was working in the theater it was\neverything good, but in my job happened something very wrong. Because as they told you you\nremember when I was employed by the baker the woman, his wife, came to me. She looked at\nme and then later I knew what for. The age of her husband and the woman was very big\ndifference. She was younger and probably she was bigger and more demand in the month for\nlove. She used me as a boy not only for delivery of bread but also of the delivery love letters to\nher lovers. In the beginning it was everything good but something happened very, very wrong.\nWhen I went with this letter, open it, a woman. She said, \"What are you doing. You're trying to\nmake -- break my marriage.\" And I ran away. I told -- I said in German \"Meister, and she said\n\"Yes did you --\" No, I have this. Good that you haven't given this but maybe she can recognize\nyou because Torran was very small. Everybody knew us. And then in this moment she tried to\ndo everything that will go out from this job. My mother, the meister, everybody was wondering\nwhy. It was always so good, but I knew later that the reason was that she was afraid that maybe\nthere will some blackmail. The man will be know about her and okay. I was looking for a new\njob. It was very, very difficult to find a very easy job. But I found it as an ordinary worker. It is\nin German a . You can translate this into English. I remember the name it\nwas Hanz Kruger. I agree and I was working there. I said immediately that I cannot stay very\nlong only until 3:00 because then I have to exercises in the theater. They appreciated very much.\nAt first they were very anxious, curious that Polish people and I said \"No, I'm just a chorus\nsinger, nothing more.\" And so I worked there and I worked in the theater.\nQ. But Polish people were not allowed to be on the street after 8:00?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But you had to work in the theater sometimes in the evening?\nA. Yes, you are right. Before I accepted the theater because they told me you will work here\nnights, performances until 10:00 and you will receive a special pass for the night. I received a\npass from 8:00 until 12:00. I was very funny and very proud, but it was not for other people not\ngood. Other people you can imagine. They are sitting. They are waiting and I'm coming at ten\nor eleven o'clock home. They are wondering what's happened. Maybe he is a German now. I\ncouldn't explain to everybody that I have this permission. At home my mother knew. My\nbrother was not satisfied with this, and he wasn't also satisfied that I was working in the theater.\nMaybe some friends, because he had many friends, and maybe they thought I was collaborating\nwith Germans. It was not a pleasant time for me, especially when I came home or when I passed\na street when somebody -- it happened also that my friends from the school sometimes when I\npassed they took the hat so on this side they thought that maybe I'm collaborating.\nQ. Did your German also improve when you were working in theater? Did you start to\nspeak better German?\nA. Yes, of course I had to because we had the exercises. We received a note and it was\nGerman. I tried to learn the German better. I asked my mother, my father, the grammar. My\nmother could speak but she couldn't explain me how it was grammatically good. Then I asked\nsometimes Mr. Veber and he was very glad that I am so keen for this language. He said, \"Oh,\nyou are a very clever boy. In a short time you will speak fluently German.\" It was not fluently\nbut it was better and better, always better. So, that's and even when I was working with this\nbaker, we went together and we made shopping with the women, with the meister and I tried also\nto speak German or Polish. She said we are going now to the German shop, try to speak German\nonly. And sometimes if I needed something, , then because we couldn't buy,\nexcept a small ration of food in the cart, nothing, no . The Germans had some\n, It is permission for buying clothes, dresses or shoes. We had nothing. Once I\nremember she also went to a German shop and you see the boy this winter it's cold maybe you\nhave something, and they put it to give because I talk to her German, maybe they took me as a\nGerman too.\nAnyhow, I improve my German so much as possible sometimes the Germans couldn't\nrecognize me that I was German, because I used this night pass control for some shopping. For\nGermans there was everything, but at night, evening. And I went to those shops, I bought I\nremember it was marmalade, there was some not -- a kind of zwieback, sometimes there was\nsome fruit some oranges, but there was only two or three. They wouldn't like to sell more so that\nI had use of this privilege of my pass and I could buy a little to my mother.\nQ. Then when you worked for the theater you met at one point someone who became very\nspecial?\nA. Yes. It was once when I left the theater I crossed usually the same place to make some\nshopping and I feel that somebody watched me. At the moment I thought maybe some\npoliceman because it was dark. I didn't see. I went and he followed me and they see there 1s\nsome uniform, some soldier. I didn't know what he wanted from me. He watched, but his\nwatching was completely differently than usual. He smiled to me. It never happened before and\nhe started to ask something of me and he said , which means \"this is a nice\nplace\" and then hello, how are you? What are you doing? \"I'm going home. Shall we go home\nto drink some coffee?\" I'm looking. A German invited me for coffee. My hat was trembling I\nwas so excited. I didn't know maybe if I refuse him maybe something happen wrong. I agree. I\nwent and then when we're inside, so, and you're out shopping. \"Your parents are living here,\nfamily?\" \"Yes, my parents are living here. My father is not here. My father is I don't know,\nmaybe in Germany and I was born also here.\" You were born here? You're not German? No,\nI'm Polish. Oh, God, what are you doing now.\" I said, \"Don't worry. I have the passport. I am\nworking theater. I have the passport until 12:00\" \"Oh, God, that's good, but maybe we go out,\"\nbecause I think he was afraid my characteristic, German speaking that somebody here that he\nspeaks with me, there were not so many people but anyhow I knew that in the beginning when I\nspoke only a few words it was correct. But I started to speak more he felt that my accent was\nbad.\nAnd we went out. He asked me in which direction I'm going home. I showed him\nbecause I was living not in the center of city, we were in suburb, very, very poor district. Then\nwhen the evening he asked me, \"May I see you again?\" For the first time, I would like to meet\nyou. But he look always in eyes. It was something completely different than usual with all the\nGerman men. I asked why not, we can do this. \"But where?\" I asked. You see, here, this\nstation. It was in the railroad station in the middle of the city. It was a very good place. Okay,\nbut when? You see I don't know when I'll receive the permission for going out because he was a\nsoldier. And I also, I don't know because there were differently plays, operetta, gypsy, a little\nlonger, sometimes it is an operetta it was a little shorter. We fixed exactly I\nremember it was after two days at the same place, and he came after my performance, he came.\nAnd then, I have to tell you we went -- I took him because I knew places. He asked me whether I\nknew some places because he is not so good to walk for him and for him, especially for him\nmaybe more because Polish people were not on the street.\nAnd I found some places we were standing there in the theater and he -- maybe I so\nexactly there is some item but he pressed on and he said, \"You look very nice. You are a very\nboy.\" Then he told me, \"I'm not German.\" \"You are not German? Who are you then?\" \"I'm\nAustrian. \"Austria, Vienna? Yes, Vienna.\" Then I feel a little better. It is completely different\nto like a German. Have you met in these places as a child. As a child I played in some places. I\nknew some. It was destroyed in the war in the field there was somebody watching as a guard.\nLet's go because it was cold. I met him it was on exactly the fourth of November 1941. It would\nsnow. It was cold. I liked to wear shoes -- only small shoes and trousers with pump, here. So,\nthe snow -- the winter was so strong. He took me to places for the first time like father and I was\na child and it was very pleasant and then we went to the shed. We played. It was romantic. It\nwas not so suffocating like now maybe, completely different. Then when I went home, I couldn't\nsleep. I dreamed because it happened something with me completely different.\nQ. What happened? What was different for you?\nA. Different for me, it changed my life. I feel something, like love. It was like love but\ndon't think that there was real sex. No. There was playing, kissing, maybe the sex comes also,\nof course, I was young, I feel it. But and we had no possibilities but it was a very, very\npleasurable time. We couldn't see each day as I told you because he could not receive every day\nthe permission but so long he could he came and he brought me always something, some sweet,\nsome special ration card. With this card I could buy some pastry because for Polish people it\nwas absolutely forbidden to receive pastry but for his card especially evening when I went, I\ncould receive it. I received once even shoes because he had seen that my shoes for the winter\ntime was no good. Home was big scandal, especially my brother.\nMy brother felt that there is something wrong because I brought shoes. I brought once\nshirt, inside shirt and he knew that this shirt was from soldier. He asked me something, \"What's\nhappened? Don't worry. What I am doing is my business.\" Sometimes he was very angry. He\nsaid I am older than you. I promise Father to take care of you so I must know.\nQ. Did you tell him?\nA. Not early. Later. When that was so big that even my mother feel something happened\nwith me, something, because I ask very often, \"Mother I need white shirt.\". My mother\ncomplained, \"I have no soap. You change every day. I cannot wash. Mother I must look very\nnice\", but it was not for theater. It was for my friend. His name was Willie Goetz. I will never\nforget his name.\nBecause he was so sweet to me, I wanted also to be sweet and once they of course, when\nmy brother drank a little, schnapps, that's a kind of illegal vodka, we couldn't buy it but he had\nsome contacts. Maybe later I will tell you. I knew he had to work. He worked with some\nunderground. I never knew exactly, but he brought also sometimes schnapps probably from\nthese places.\nI said to him, his name was Casimir, I said, \"Cashic, you must understand me. I fall in\nlove with soldier. Oh my God, why? You don't like women? No, I like men like you like\nwomen. I like men. You must understand me. No, this is only for the moment. You'll find a\ngirl probably, especially with Germany. You know what's happened. It's very dangerous. No,\nit's not dangerous, it's so good. No, you can be sure. You must stop this. I'll tell mother. Don't\ntell this mother, I ask you very much. Don't do this.\" He didn't say this, but from this time he\nchanged his behavior towards me. And our relation was not so open. I knew that sometimes he\nwent to somebody but not night only during the day. He had no permission so that his time\nworking and doing this was not so easy for him. Anyhow, our relation was not so good as\nbefore.\nQ. You said that your brother worked in the underground, did you ever get into difficulties\nwith that?\nA. I feel it. He never said this at home but there are too many friends and they came to our\nroom, with no loud speaking. Even my mother, \"What are you doing? This is our business.\"\nSO, that I feel there was something there. They had some news about the war, about the front,\nfrom where? We had no radio. I forgot to tell you that when we were living in this nice house\nwe had very nice radio, Phillips Radio. We didn't even pay. There was two years of payment\nand the Germans in the beginning immediately took this radio so that the Polish people never\nlistened to no radio. For my brother I had some news because from BBC they heard something.\nIt was only my feeling, but I suppose he was afraid that I was working in the theater with\nGerman people. And then I said to him I have this friend, this soldier, I'm sure that he didn't\nwant to tell me about his underground work.\nQ. Did you -- how was your feeling that Willie was Austrian, I mean he was part of the\nGerman army and the German army was responsible that you couldn't go to school, that you had\nto work. How did you feel about that?\nA. Usually my feeling to German soldiers was very bad because in the school we were\neducated against Germany and Russia. Even my mother sometimes when I wouldn't go to the\nchurch, she called me a Bolshevik. That was the worst thing. When I met Willie and he said to\nme he is Austrian, my feeling was completely different because I felt he's not German and his\nbehavior was so good. I thought maybe when I said to my brother that he will understand me,\nbut he didn't because he said for me German uniform is German uniform. It's Austria or it's not\nAustria but it is for me German. And he knew that I couldn't go to the school. Very often he\nmade me plans, you see the world, it will not be war time. The war will finish. Maybe you'll\ncome to my country. You will study there, you will be a real mensch. Be a waiting person, do\nlike just now. Be in this way as you are because I was very honest.\nIn our family and my mother was very strong, strong for the education. I never forget\nonce before the war I went not to the school I went -- instead to school with boys to some play\nand because I was always going to the school, the teacher sent somebody to ask what happened\nto me why I didn't come to the school. My mother knew this. I came home as usual. It was\ngreetings. I said . My mother said I give you forever and I received -- I was\npunished so strong and she punished because who lies also steals. So, I was very honest so\neverything what I've done was correct and therefore I believed Willie.\nWe talked about his future plans. We talked about is life and before for me it was for me\na pleasure to hear it. I agree that I was very lucky especially as I told you during the war time. It\nwas so boring for young people. I was 17 years old at this time. I had no friends because I had\nto work morning from one work to another work. I even had not enough for sleeping, only when\nI had no appointments with him I could sleep a little longer.\nQ. How old was Willie?\nA. He was maybe five or six years older than me, but he looks very handsome, very strong.\nI never seen his picture and he told me -- I asked once for his picture but he said it's better you\nwill not have it. It will be very dangerous for you and for me. He told me also. He said\nsomething, you must be very careful because Hitler, what you receive for this kind of love is\nvery dangerous. You must be very careful. I said what for we are doing nothing. Don't tell\nanybody that we meet or that we are coming here. It would be very dangerous. He told me one\nday he said \"You know Hitler is also for men. He likes only this kind of love. Really? Yes, he's\nnot married. He is single and he likes this kind of love. The Fuhrer then why are you so\nanxious? Please believe me, I am older I know better.\" He told me that.\nQ. Did he tell anything about the persecution of homosexual men?\nA. No, it was only the attention given to me in this way, but it was in a real 1941 when we\nmet, let's go to a place here, I cannot tell you. He brought me something new and he was very\nnervous. What's happen? At first I thought maybe someone has seen us. I asked him, no,\nnobody seen you know. I'm sent to the eastern front of war. Oh my to Russia. I heard that this\nwas the worst front in the war because it was warmer it was snow. You must wait for me. I\npromise you. The war will not be longer. When the war is end the war you will come to Vienna.\nI will try to live with you together. Wait for me. But how will I contact. I'll write you. I gave\nhim my address and I was waiting for his letter but I hadn't received it. I was very sorry, very\nsad. Even my mother, my brother. I said to my brother that my friend went -- he accepted, he\nagreed. He was a little satisfied with this. He was more calmly that something happened wrong\nto me. I was waiting for this letter. Once I couldn't remember -- I have to state to you also that\nin my theater there was working like me. He was a little older. He knew exactly, he learned me\nthis way, he explained me this kind of love and he asked me -- first I didn't want to tell him but I\nwanted to see the place, what's happened. Where is this shed and then come on let's go. We\nshall go maybe there and once we went there it was after the performance and when we went\nthere, voices. Some people -- I wanted to run away. He too, and especially one fellow took us\nhere very quickly, halted the mouths. We couldn't cry, nothing and then in broken German he\nsaid to me that he's from the concentration camp Studthoff. He was a very young Jew. Bascal I\nremember this name. We give our story to him to the other people. We talk to them also. One\nspoke very good Polish. He was Polish. That Sigmund, the other boy took the Jew -- I couldn't\ntake where we were living. He took him home probably for some feeding even some dressing.\nWhat's happened there I don't know exactly. I was only with my things about my friend. Even\nSigmund if I wanted to know, he told me only it was very nice time. I can imagine. Maybe he\nused him for some sex or something like this because he said it was so nice.\nQ. How many men were in this shed?\nA. Three men. Some of them they had stripes, some trousers. Maybe they found them, but\nthey had stripes. They couldn't go on the street. They would be immediately arrested.\nEverybody could recognize them. They had this cap also with this thread. Now I know that they\nhad some ___ but I don't remember exactly. I knew only the faces very --- Bascal was small,\nbut the eyes were very large, very big. This is all.\nQ. Bascal, where did he come from?\nA. He said to me from France and he spoke -- I couldn't speak French. He spoke only a little\nGerman, a few words. Enough only to understand me. Then when I was in the theater one day I\nhad seen a German newspaper and this German newspaper on the table and there was written,\nthere was the address for the soldiers who are on the east front. I wrote secretly this and then I\nwas fighting with myself. It was so long time, four months. I haven't received a letter. Have I to\nwrite or not to write the letter.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2\nQ. When you went to this shed and you heard voices, what exactly happened?\nA. You see, when we went there there was change. Usually I remember it that it was\ncompletely different. We heard some voices, some human voices and when I said to my friend,\nSigmund, let's go, we go, at this moment somebody stood up and closed our mouths, nothing to\nsay. Probably this man thought we are from Poland or maybe some spies. Then he started to ask\nme Polish. He spoke very good Polish. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked me. We came\nonly here because our paths crossed. We are not from -- no we are Polish. He tested me many\ntimes. He feels that I speak perfect Polish. My friend also, and then we have seen two other\nfaces. They were laying the sheets and the youngest was trembling, was very cold even the\noutside was not so cold. And the youngest tried to speak something. I asked in Polish first, but\nhe couldn't reply me Polish and he said to me in German. I asked \"Are you German? No, ina\ncompletely different way, in French. I'm French and Jew.\" He said Bascal's his name. My friend\nSigmund took care of him immediately. I gave him shirt because he had only his striped jacket.\nThis from the Studtkoff. It 1s warm outside I can go home in my white underwear shirt. And so\nI did. Then he said to this Bascal that he will take him home but only in this dressing. Then to\nthe two, he promised to wait here so long as they will come. The French with the Bascal\nprobably he wanted also to bring some food, maybe some dressing. I don't know exactly. I had\nenough problems with my Willie and I couldn't help nothing more. I give only my shirt and that\nis all.\nOnly the next day or after maybe two days I asked Sigmund what happened. He said\neverything is okay. Bascal was at his house, slept there, and he didn't want me to say more. I can\nimagine he helped them. He gave maybe food some dressing and they escaped from this place to\nmaybe another place. I never went more. I was also afraid that if I go there and there are some\nprisoners because they said they are from Studtkoff. It was for me also very dangerous to go\nthere. So, that I didn't go anymore there.\nOnly this I knew from Sigmund can be sure everything is okay. You can be sure don't\nask more. I was wondering a little. Usually he was a little crazy, not crazy, but so funny and at\nthis moment he was very, very serious and I proceeded very much. Unfortunately he is also not\nalive. I have met him maybe even ten years ago when I was in Torran but no more. He's also\ndead. He's no more alive. If he were we could go -- I would like to ask him even for this address\nof my friend as I told you Titlebaum. I tried to find his address. I wrote to my friend to\nin the South of Poland but for Sigmund I have no chance because he is no more\nalive. I'm sure that he helped for them maybe they are still alive, these three prisoners, maybe\nnot. Maybe when we ask sometimes in the radio, who was hidden in the shed near Torran,\nmaybe we'll find them.\nQ. Did you know then what Studtkoff was?\nA. Yes, I heard that it was the concentration camp for Jews and Poles. If something\nhappened in Torran, they were sent immediately to Studtkoff. I had -- there was very, very bad,\nvery slow time. Usually the family received the letter, this and this 1s dead, but we never\nbelieved. It was not dead, probably shot more.\nQ. Were the Jews of Torran sent to Studtkoff?\nA. No, I don't know. Maybe not all. In Torran there were not so many, but near of Torran\nthere was Alexandrov and there were many Jews. Even immediately in the beginning of the war\nwhen I didn't work by baker, it was not so far so I went by foot to Alexandrov to buy some\nbread. I remember that the Jews had to wear their David stars and they had to go on the street,\nand probably from Alexandrov they were sent to Studtkoff.\nQ. And Polish people from Torran, do you know any Polish people?\nA. Who were sent? No. At the moment I don't know. I cannot remember.\nQ. But there was talk in Torran what happened in Studtkoff?\nA. Oh, yes, yes, you know among the people there was talking of course that the situation\nwas very bad. The food and the hell, --as all the concentration camps, but exactly as you know,\nmaybe you remember about my life, later then I was arrested and my knowledge about the\nsituation of Polish people, Polish Jews in Torran was broken.\nQ. Why were you arrested?\nA. As I told you when I found the address in the in the German newspaper, I\nwrote secretly the address and then I was fighting with myself whether to write to Willie or not\nto write.\nQ. Which address did you find?\nA. I find it . It was for the soldiers who were sent to the eastern front\nin Russia, . A very important address, probably for most all soldiers in the\nfront. And I wrote a letter in my young German language. Probably it was you see, my mind it\nis very difficult to say the whole letter. It was that I love him. I'm waiting for him. I pray for\nhim that he comes back and I never go to the same places. I didn't mention the shed. I never go\nto the same place. I wait, I hope you will come back as soon and I will be very grateful. Please\ngive me some news because I am so anxious about you. I cannot sleep. I cannot work and at the\nend, with may kisses your friend Teo. I wrote.\nAnd it was a little naive to write especially I put my sender. Usually I couldn't do that\nbut I was fighting if I send without sender what will happen. Maybe the letter will not come\nback. And if come back I will know that he is not there. So, I send the letter with my sender.\n(section in bold has been copychecked; get most updated version from Joan. 9/10/96)\nQ. And what happened then?\nA. After sending I was still waiting. I was waiting for a reply, but the reply didn't\ncome, never. Once it was September 19, 1942, I was working morning at this manufacture\nand the boss called me and told me that I'm invited to the gestapo. I have to go to the\ngestapo. I asked him, me to the gestapo? What for? I was so honest. I do nothing, what\nfor do I have to go. He said please go there. We have received the order that you will go\nthere.\nUsually I took a bag with some sandwiches to the work. My mother prepared me\nthe sandwiches and I left this bag with sandwiches at this manufactory but he said take this\nwith you. Maybe you don't come back. Oh, why not? If I come back I will have nothing.\nNo, I didn't take, and when I went to the gestapo I remember this uniform, this black\nuniform with red here on the arm. He asked me first for the name. I told him that and\nthen he took a typewrite. He started to write. He write I sitting also in front of him when\nthe paper came down. I read from other side and I never forget the words it was written\n\" \" In English it is \"Order for prisoner.\" The first moment I thought I\nwould fall down, and then he said you will stay now. What for? I began to cry. Don't play\n. And then he called somebody. They took me to the cell it was downstairs in the\ncellar. To the cell and there was the furnace was only a wooden bed and a toilet and that's\nall. Even the door was scraped with wooden so I could put the handle like this. And I had\nto wait. The whole time I was sitting the night and I think what happened. What for, and\nthe next day when I was called again to him, he showed me the letter. This letter which I\nwrote to Willie. Is this your letter? I was very honest. I said of course. This is my letter. I\nwrote this to him. You, you wrote this letter to a German. You loved him. I wrote him it\nwas very good, yes. Then he said where did you meet him. He wanted to know exactly\nwhere we met at, what we had done, in which way. We seen only once or twice. I lied, I\ntried to lie but you say me and he showed me some pictures, other pictures of soldiers, not\nonly soldiers, civilians. He wanted to know you cannot remember. You will remember.\nwith trousers to beat especially with the . It was terrible\nand I cried. They put it in my trousers and they beat me when I couldn't breath, I couldn't\nspeak they brought water and poured water on me and began once more again and again.\nAll over, and always I heard only them, ''You pig, you \" So many bad\nwords I cannot translate it into English especially in German.\nQ. Say it in German.\nA. In German . Terrible, so many words I hadn't\never heard before that. And every day I was sent to the cell there was given only once a\nday, I don't know from there they brought. At first in the beginning I didn't eat nothing. I\nwanted to drink only water. Sleep I couldn't also because I was so beaten swollen under\nmy back -- when I was laying only on my stomach.\nAnd so happened I don't know when, I lost even the dates, maybe about two weeks,\neveryday the same question. The last one they gave me something to sign. I don't know\nwhat. I was so tortured. For me it was everything I signed only to be free.\n, When you tell us the truth you'll be free. I was so stupid. I told them\nalso about Hitler, what Willie said, that Hitler is also homosexual. He wrote this. Yes, and\nyou the Fuhrer. It was very, -- now I'm smiling but it was not for smiling. It was for\ncrying.\nIt happened so after two weeks as I told you I signed this what they wrote. I don't know.\nThen they took me by special closed car. It was a kind, we call this like a , which\nmeans you don't see nothing there, like in prison. When they brought me I had seen the round\nprison. I know because my brother immediately after the war, he was by the Germans also\narrested by Germans but for very short time. Only reason was that he as a boy when he was\ngoing to the school -- it was not high school it was for the baker school, when he was going\nthere, he has to train as a soldier, a Polish soldier. For this reason he was in the same prison. I\nnever forget how my mother suffered. Sometimes she give me bread to give him and then I had\nseen she cried and she said \"Oh my dear God it's better you take him.\" I had seen how the\nmother suffered if the son is arrested. Later when I was arrested I thought also that maybe she\nsuffered also. He was only one month and she suffered and when I was so long time, but maybe\nwe should go with my story further.\nI was brought to this round prison. I was put in the cell with six or seven crime prisoners\nusually. When they heard because each prisoner had received a special card. I had received\ncard. It was written paragraph 175. I didn't know what this mean paragraph and I showed it to\neverybody, but there was somebody oh it is for the gays, for the homosexuals.\nAnd since this time I was very bad behaved in this cell. I was not human. I couldn't sit at the\ntable when the meal began. They treated me very, very bad. And I was sitting there until fifth of\nDecember 1942.\nOn the fifth of December 1942 somebody opened the door. The block meister took me to\nthe Judge. I remember there was only my mother, no people and me and maybe five or six in\nblack dresses. They were the judges. There was shouting and cried, I have to be isolated. I have\ndemoralized the German military, me Pollock and how could I do that. I must be punished. I\nmust be punished for long time and I was 17 years old. They punished me for five years exactly\n. I don't know exactly how it's called in German but is a very hard\nprison.\nImmediately then I met my mother. I couldn't speak. You can imagine how was the\nfeeling my mother and me. When I came to the cell first I cried. But later I had to go -- I was\nsent to Koronovo. was not far from maybe 50 or 60 kilometers. It was the\nworst prison in Poland before the war and during the war. Only for Polish and Jewish prisoners.\nI will never forget they cut my hair because in Torran I still had my own hair. They gave\nme with some maybe yellow -- I don't know, it was here on the arm, and I was sent to the cellar\nwith about 40 prisoners. There were maybe about five or six Jews together with me and it was\nterrible. My memories, especially in this cellar because the oldest of this cell it was a prisoner\nfor a long life, murder and there was a clan. Around him he had a few prisoners. They made\neverything for him what he liked. We had nothing to say. We had to be polite what he -- even\nwith the toilet. The toilet was only morning and then the food, when they delivered the food it\nwas very small, but even if we received one spoon of marmalade, he took from us. We were\ngiven a little margarine, once or twice per week, he took also. So, that this time this 1s my worst\ntime in my life. And then my leg began to be I have received a kind of I\ncannot explain in English. Due to the reason I had no vitamins. It was like it was spoiled this\nleg. It started from a small wound. This was this leg. From this to this here, this place.\nNothing, in those terrible times but of course everywhere is bad times and after bad will come a\nlittle better. Even there, there was so that because our work we were living, we were working in\nthe same cell. There was very stupid work but very dangerous, very dusty. We had to the ropes,\nwe could resolve the ropes then we had to make the leather for the new shoes for the front they\nwere sent. This was the job and once they looked they wanted one . Oh, I have to\nexplain also here that here we could write the letters once every two or three months home in\nGerman language. Everybody doesn't write German. Me and especially my good friend, it was\nthe Applebaum, exactly I remember, he wrote also German. Some of them gave us one potato or\ntwo potatoes for the writing. At the first moment I didn't want to take but Applebaum said yes\ntake it. It 1s for them also very helpful when they have the contact with the parents or with\nfamily your letters.\nAnd so we cooperated very good in this way and once happen that block meister came to\nour cell and asked the oldest men for somebody who can write and speak German. First he send\nsomeone from his clan but after a few minutes he came back and he said no. Exactly he said\n. Then when he came one more, \"You have nobody here? Among 40 men\nyou have nobody. I need a writer. I was standing and I said -- usually I couldn't do that and I\nthink maybe I will be able for him. I said \"Her block meister, I can speak German and I write\nGerman too.\" He was wondering I was so slim and young, where I could speak English. And he\ntook me to his room. He gave me paper pencil and dictated. He dictated in German. I\nremember it was an office, exactly as you like I can do this in German,\n. He looked at this, yes, good. Go there. Take your clothes and\nyou'll come here. I went to the cell and I remember everybody especially those of the clan but\nmy friends, they said, really, he agree. You are able to take -- he takes you? Oh that's very good.\nGo boy, with his hand and with this you are also good that God helps you.\nWhen I went there it was a three men cell, much better, near the kitchen. Sometimes\nwhen I had a little more -- I received sometimes cigarettes. Cigarettes were very good like\nmoney for exchange. Because I didn't smoke -- I never smoked, I could make the exchange for\nthe prisoners in the kitchen for cigarette I received some bread. Then I had the permit to go to\nother places. I belonged to the high society of this prison. I received better uniform, prison\nuniform, better warmer. Even the hair was a little longer than usual. As the flour sometime one\nhad no water and me I was -- but I never forget about my friend Applebaum. I went and took\nwith me some bread some food and I went to the cell and I wanted to give him this. Then I\nremember, I don't know exactly the name of him, he said since few days there's no more\nApplebaum. He patted -- he was in so high depression. He was ill. He had diarrhea and it was\nvery, very dangerous. You know if somebody had this they couldn't stop and suffered. I\nsuppose he thought that this is the end and he made this.\nOf course I left his bread there. I came -- and that was not all because every week from\nKoronovo where the transport station to Sauxenhausen. So always thinking about it was one day\nI will also be sent there. Because that was the end of their life. Who was sent to Sauxenhausen\nnever returned.\nQ. Tell us a little bit more about --?\nA. He was older than me. He was maybe forty, maybe, older than me. He was black, black\nhair. He spoke very good Polish. He told me that he lived in Lodz, this German city for\n. He had family, but he never didn't want to say me what the reason was that he\nwas in Koronovo. I thought maybe he was arrested before the war. I don't know, maybe\npolitical, I never knew. Usually later you received a card what was the reason of the prison. But\nthis we haven't therefore I never knew. I never heard about this. His behavior, he said to me,\nboy don't be worried. You are very young. You will succeed. The war will be not long. You\ncan be sure. He should be older because he told me also about first war. Maybe he knew this\nbefore. He was so sure that -- because I lost my hope. I thought maybe that Germany -- because\nalways the Germans said Poland is forever forgotten, forever. And I lost my hope, but he gave\nme this trust in the prison.\nQ. Was he Jewish?\nA. Of course. You see I have to state, even in this prison, you knew immediately who was\nPolish who was Jewish. The David's star, they had this, this Applebaum. Therefore we knew,\nwe Polish had only a number or maybe yellow on here, this stripe around.\nQ. What was this yellow mean?\nA. I don't know what this yellow means. It was prisoners, not like pink or no -- the\ndifferences of color when I was sent as a writer I received green. Before I don't know exactly the\ndifferences of color.\nQ. Did people in the prison know that you were sentenced because of 175?\nA. Yes, Applebaum knew. I told him, before I never hear this word homosexuality. I told\nhim only that I had something with a man. I told him also with a German soldier. He wasn't\nastonished, only he smile, oh you are a young boy. It was stupid. You are still healthy. But my\nleg, you see, the war will not be so long. He told me always in this way.\nQ. Were there other prisoners who were imprisoned because they were homosexual?\nA. You see there were of course many, but some of them like the doctor for instance. He\nwas working as a doctor because we had lazaret. It was for the very ill people, but there was no\nmedicine, nothing. But there were some. When I was in the high position I met also another\nwriter. I met also someone from theater, not from Torran, from other places. He was also for the\nhomosexual. Then because we receive, everybody has a card and there was written for me for\ninstance was written at this time not paragraph 75, only . I don't know how to\ntranslate this into English. I don't know. It is like because I have just now this year I received a\ndocument thanks to the red cross and I have even with me this document and there was written\n. I looked at a dictionary. It's terrible. It is in the Polish language,\nprostitution. I was not prostitution. Stupid. I cannot show this document to anybody. It was 16\nor 17 years prostitution during the war, stupid. I was so angry for this document I couldn't sleep\nthree days. I wanted first to write to because is a gay national\nin Berlin. I wrote them. I have also the copy and I explained them everything that this\ndocumentary is wrong. Only one 1s exactly the date that I escaped from the prison in\nin the island. It was the 15th of May 1945. This is correct, but even there was a\nquestion nation, there was written unknown. They arrested as a Polish. They cried, \"You Polish\nsow.\" And then put \"Nation, unknown.\" I was so angry when I received this documentation. If\nyou wish I can show you later.\nQ. If you go back to the prison, did you have contact with other homosexual prisoners. Did\nyou talk about your situation?\nA. You mean in the prison? No, because I had no experience. This was maybe no\nhomosexual. I was also as we called this -- I didn't know exactly. Later after the war, I knew\nwhat it means, homosexual, gay etc. but me I was really very shy boy and I didn't know this. I\ndidn't talk about this and nobody asked, so that I never talked about homosexuals in the prison.\nQ. Did you understand when during the interrogation, in the prison when the guard showed\nyou the pictures of the other men, did you understand why -- what were you supposed to do with\nthose pictures?\nA. You mean after the war?\nQ. No, you said in the beginning.\nA. In the beginning when I met Willie --.\nQ. No, no when you were arrested.\nA. I think maybe they wanted to know that I had maybe more soldiers, not only one. This\nwas the reason. Before they showed me some soldiers and civilians but I hadn't. I had only\nWillie. It was true, but they beat me. They wanted to know and maybe they should kill me\nbecause they didn't believe me. But maybe after two weeks they couldn't receive nothing more\nand they believed and I signed something. What, I don't know. After the war, especially later\nwhen I was a tailor then I tried to find the documents so I wrote to Red Cross, everywhere. I\nwanted to receive my documents. See, maybe I will tell you something. When I was a tailor and\nthen when I was ill I didn't receive any indemnification for my time for prison. Then I think I\nhave to do something, I must write to anybody and to fight for my rights. I spent as a boy for\nnothing so I suffered and my leg was -- my body was burned, and I want to call. First I wrote to\nask for the indemnification. I explained that I was so long time the whole time in the prison for\nthis reason and I would like to receive something, some compensation especially because I had\nto go early as a tailor. I couldn't work. I was ill for this reason and I had skin cancer and\ndifferent illnesses, but I have received a reply very kindly that the money has been sent to Polish\ngovernment. I have to go to them and ask and they have to give me. But it was the communist\ngovernment. They will never give money. Then I wrote once more that maybe some symbolic\none mark only that I will have this satisfaction that he agree with me and I ask you for\nforgiveness. No, I received letter if I try more to write all letters will go to the paperbasket. I\nwas so angry. Then I write once more. I will fight so long I will write to New York to the\nUnited Nations. I will fight for my rights. I black mailed a little because I knew I couldn't do\nthat. Then what I have to do, then I find an address in Germany in the parliament there was\nhomosexual bond organization. I wrote to them. I explained that I was so young. I suffered. I\nhave paid with my life. My mother suffered and my family, and they explained we agree with\nyou. We are very sorry, but really what we can do, we can only collect money for you for your\nresearch medicine. And I said no, I don't think you -- I don't need money. I want to receive\nindemnification. You must do something for me.\nThen in Poland there was martial law, you remember and I said oh no, I cannot stay here.\nI must do something, and one day I received a very nice letter from Germany. A young writer\nwrote me a letter and he put this letter in a book about young Jews in Israel. He wanted to give\nme with this book a sample of his writing, how he writes, his style of the book. And it was\nwritten in this letter that he found it by this organization a homosexual by Mr. ;\nhe found my story. This story is very good for writing a book, and he asked me whether I agree\nfor this book. If yes, he'll help me. He put inside 20 marks for the stamps and this was the first\nmoney that I receive as indemnification from my stay in the prison.\nThen when I wrote him I agree, I bought used old typewriter and every day because I was\nnot working any more. I was retired now according to my illness and I wrote him every day\nabout my beginning from the prison everything that he needed for this book. I sent to him, he\nsent me again, so about six months we wrote. He wanted some pictures. He wanted to know\nsome details and when this project of this book was finished he came to me, to Warsaw. I gave\nhim the signature and the book was printed in Germany. The reaction of this book was fantastic.\nI never believed, especially the young people. They wrote letters and they asked me, maybe I\nneed something. They wanted to help me and they were saying -- I suffered only the reason was\nI love somebody, that I loved a man. It was very touching for me. Even until now I have contact\nwith some of them, especially one doctor who delivers me always there the medicine and they\ncontact -- they visit me. They come to me. I stay up to now with very good many friends and\nthe name of this book is \"Damned Strong Love\" and in German . I paid really\nwith my illness and with the memories especially. When I was sitting in Torran and I had seen\nmy mother was watching and I couldn't say to her it was sometimes, it was -- for me it is very\nheavy to remember. Sometimes I say I can forgive German, but never forget. It is too difficult\nto forget. And thanks also many American soldiers because you see when I escaped in the\nBritish zone, I went to Munich because I thought I will go to Vienna. I will find Willie. I\nwanted to know what happened with him. I wanted to meet him. In the beginning it was too\ndifficult. My leg was worse and worse. I received the displaced, the card, the displaced person\ncard in Munich from the Americans and I was sent immediately to the American hospital. I was\nabout two or three weeks. I don't know exactly now, but I know that after three weeks I was fit. I\nwas so healthy and I was so happy that I was again alive.\nNow, I want to go to Vienna. In Vienna there were Russians. I couldn't I wanted to go to\nPoland. I couldn't, because everywhere I heard that in Poland there are communists and their\nsituation is not clear. What I have to do 1s sit and wait? No, I started to work and I worked by\nAmericans. By Americans I learned a little English. By American I learned how 1s their life.\nBy American I learned how it is good because I was working in the canteen, I'm asking an\nofficer. I'll never forget the nice apples, red, the conflicts and even I remember some words I\nlearned, very funny like \"hubba hubba\" and it was really -- I had some friends and I met also one\nofficer. He wanted to adopt me. He wanted you must come to America. I dreamed about\nAmerica. I wanted to come here to America but he said you must receive the permission from\nyour parents because they are alive. I received once the letter from my mother and my father\ncame back. He was also in the forced labor camp in Germany and especially my mother asked\nme so much, come boy, back. Come on, it is not very good but we will be together. And I was\nfighting with myself. I didn't know what have to do, to go or not to go. Many friends said don't\ngo, but my soul says, \"Better go\" and I went of course.\nWhen I returned I regretted it because it was everything strange. Even when I went to\nthis bath house where we were sent from Germany I didn't recognize my young brother. I\nremember he came and I said to my mother, \"Mother a boy came.\" She said, \"This is your\nbrother.\" I cried but I couldn't go to Munich. I had to stay in Poland.\nQ. Let's go back to the prison. You told us you were transferred to a small cell with three\nbeds. It was a better situation. Did you stay in this prison?\nA. No, no. Later, in the beginning I didn't know, but when the transport to Sauxenhausen\nthe block meister came also to me and said you'll go to Stum. You must go -- no he didn't sent\nme to Stum only e took me to same transport. Me and some many four or five prisoners. They\ngave us you know how the hand -- and we went by and we went in special truck. Then on the\nway I heard Stum. Also, it is . In Stum, because my leg was so bad they\nsent me immediately to the lazaret. In lazaret 1t was a little better because it was not necessary to\nwork, but they couldn't heal my leg because they had no medicine and I was there maybe a few\nmonths, when the control always was there. Once he said, \"Oh, you are too long. It is not\nsanitary, you must go out.\" I know why because the front of Russia was near and near and they\nwanted that we do something. It was very hard work. It was very wrong because once I was in a\none man cell and we had always this card and it was written , what, I was\nwith animals. I was -- I never had some dogs or calves. I went to the block meister, excuse me\nplease, it is written here, \"Yeah sure,\" he cried. But no animals. Please ride with men but never\nwith animals, and they put this animals away and only with men.\nQ. Were you the only homosexual prisoner there or were there other prisoners?\nA. Only me. Then I was sent to also there. I haven't seen more homosexuals\nthere. There were some men who had stolen packages from the front from soldiers. When they\nkilled the meat for the black market so completely different for everything. Some letters -- I\ndon't know exactly the reason but homosexual I haven't seen. I remember only it was in winter\nin January 1945 there was so because the Russian front was, it was 1945. And\nwe had to pack everything and about two weeks we went by food in the strong winter and you\ncouldn't stop because you could fall and be frozen. It was very strong. I remember the\nwas frozen. We crossed the and the first maybe in\nreceived some trucks or trains and from there I was sent to the . It was near\nHamberg. It was an island. It was an island and I remember so many bombs there but I pray that\nmaybe the bombs will fall here, even in prison I could escape from prison. But the bombs were\nto the city but never to the prison camp. Then at the end of the war, it was the fifteenth of May,\n1945, I escaped from this prison. I worked there as a pork, . It was a rather\ngood job but I have taken with me sometimes potatoes also, but thank God it was not so long\ntime when we escaped. I went immediately to the British soldier. It was exactly in\n. [remember near Linnenberg. Then they send me to Birken Belsen but it was\nno more a concentration camp. We were living together with Jews in this but not in the barracks.\nOnly in the houses where the SS men were living. There food was too good. I was ill. I was\nswollen and my leg was also very bad, so I think no I have to escape here. I must go to\nAmericans. There was no train and with some friends some other boys we went by train to\nMunich, but it was no train, only American soldiers, some transport. And when I came to\nMunich there was the Judenrot. They gave out a displaced card. They sent me to the\n. It was for displaced person. I was living there short time, but I wanted to be free so\nI met a nice Polish gay boy who lived private and this boy, he's still alive. He's living in Poland.\nHe's older than me, but he's still alive. He's older than me. I met him very often. We speak about\nour time because during this time I learned English. I bought a book for myself and he liked also\nthe American soldiers. Of course I met also some but I had no experience at this time. Later,\nwhen I knew what homosexuality. I learned later. The first time as I told you I was not so\nsuffocated. It was more romantic. And so is my life.\nEnd of Tape 2\nTape 3\nCan you tell us again, when you left the Koronovo prison and where did you go to?\nA. Yes. As I told you a few prisoners were sent to some places at the beginning we didn't\nknow exactly where we are sending. The first moment I thought maybe we are sent to\nSauxenhausen, but usually the transport to Sauxenhausen were much bigger. At this moment, a\nfew only went. Then we had seen some other prisoners, a new one and we heard that it's Stum.\nStum, special for young prisoners. Young 25, 26, but not so many older. And immediately after\narriving there, they had seen that I couldn't walk. They had seen my leg and they sent me to\nLazaret. I was in the Lazaret with other prisoners, not homosexual there. There was one from\nKriena, there was from Belgium. There was from Norway and German. This Ukrainian, I was a\nlittle friend because it was very easy, Polish and Ukraine language is similar so that we were like\nfriends. We talk most than with other prisoners, and after maybe two months, because every\ntime came control, especially one was very, very bad, probably he was from Hamberg,\nsomebody said to me. I don't know exactly for everybody block meister we gave a special\nnickname. Let's say this horse Polish it was , 1t means horse head, because he's\nlooking horselike. He said, \"Oh, you are still here? You must go work. He is not sanitary. You\nwill sin heathen.\" What I had to do, I had to leave and I was sent to one cell, one person cell. As\nI told you maybe before with it's description on my door, , with animals. I\nasked him to change because you can ride with men I had only with men something but not with\nanimals. It was not so easy. It was , everything is the same, especially during\nthe war. This is demoralization and it's just like animals. I had to go to work. It was very, very\nhard, with other prisoners. The nationality I told you was most of them were Polish, some\nGerman, some English, and also from Ukraine. But Ukraine, I was wondering why from\nUkraine, then after the war I can remember because Ukraine was treated a little better. They had\ncollaborated with Germany and maybe the prisoners were better treated. It was the reason.\nFrankly speaking, maybe it was not so -- only the work was very hard. The food was\nmaybe just a little better but not much better than in Koronovo. Of course, there was not enough\nto be food, but better than in Koronovo. I don't know why, but one time they had to send me to\n. Then I also feel what happened here was a big change. Then somebody said\nto me that my mother applied -- I don't know this is kind of a group for German cities and like\nthat. She wanted to help me. Then after the war my sister she told me she wanted to take the\nlawyers advocate. She had done everything to release me from this, and this was the reason that\nI was sent from Koronova to the Strum generally for the young prisoners. Not so the crimes like\nin Koronovo, there was completely different.\nQ. Which kind of release --?\nA. This is like German release, this belongs maybe for better treating. It was a kind of -- it\nwas exactly a group , | don't know. I had never seen this. I had\nonly after my release the my mother applied for this. Maybe it was the preparation that after the\nwar we would be the German citizens. Maybe, I'm not sure, but probably it was this.\nImmediately the change was but before there was no change.\nQ. All other prisoners in Stum were in this program?\nA. Maybe also. I have never seen this documents with this third group of German list.\nProbably it happened the same. I think so, because when we escaped from this, there were only\nthree Polish boys. One was from , one was from . I think so,\ntherefore, when I wrote the book, I asked the writer to find old documents. First\nI wanted to find my full documentation. I wanted to have the same that's\nhappened in east Germany. He has done everything, he couldn't. What I received, I received\nonly an option of one part of these documents which was as I told you, -- but it is not exactly the\nsame.\nQ. In Stum ?\nA. No, I was brought there. I didn't know nothing. If somebody said to me they had to say\nto me, \"Your mother applied to this German list. You are now German.\" No, it couldn't be\nbecause I should be sent to the military. It's happened. I have seen sometimes, you know, they\ntook them but from where I don't know. Maybe to when they needed soldiers.\nOnes that go free to the they will go free but it was very dangerous and\nnobody returned back. But I didn't never. First I knew about this when I returned after two years\nafter the war to Poland. My mother \"Yes, I tried to do my best but you didn't --\" She thought\nthat I would be free immediately and even in these documents I received there was a mention\nthat I had to be in the prison exactly five years. It was fifth of December, exactly five years.\nQ. What kind of work did you have to do in Strum?\nA. In Strum as I told you, it was very hard. They had prepared for the war some, you know.\nWe had to (Speaking in German.)\nQ. (Speaking in German.)\nA. (Speaking in German.)\nQ. So when you were in Stum you were not on the forced labor outside?\nA. No, it was a prison. We were always in a group. We had to go with the block meister.\nAfter it was from early morning to evening. It was dark. We came back. We had received hot\nsoup, evening first and the morning we left.\nQ. How many hours did you have to work?\nA. Oh, it was very long. Let's say from 8:00 until 4:00 afternoon. Because it was quickly\ndark. I remember this was autumn and it was very cold. Before I tried to do my best and it was\nyou know, everybody had a place. You had to -- then I met also this Ukrainian Andre. He was\nAndre also and he came to me with some , you know he wanted to give me, he\nfound that we were staying also in very good friendship.\nQ. Were there any other gay boys?\nA. In Stum I didn't find no gay boys, no Jews. In the same, no Jews. Only in\nKoronovo.\nQ. When were you ordered to ?\nA. It was maybe December -- before -- maybe December 1944. Yes, I was sent there and it\nwas very fine block meister there. He sent me immediately to the job, the magazine. You know,\nwhere the dresses of the prisoners there. It was a rather good job because I was not so -- and\nthen I met in Stum, I met also Hendrick. This was from Holland and we in Stum we worked also\ntogether. I was a friend with this Hendrick and when we came to he was\nsleeping behind me because we have two beds, down and upstairs so that he was not gay. And\nhe knew I was gay because in and in later, it was written exactly paragraph 175, and\nhe knew that. There was maybe for young prisoners, tolerated. They knew and sometimes they\njoked about me.\nQ. What kind?\nA. (in German. )\nQ. Tell me a story in German what they joked about.\nA. (Speaks in German)\nQ. Why was Hendrick in Stum?\nA. I don't know exactly what the reason. I suppose maybe -- I don't know exactly. I cannot\nremember. For my reason everybody knew very quickly. But the others, the\nknew. He had the stolen in the pocket, for the , the family sent, and he was hungry.\nHe for this reason, it was very strong punishment, but Hendrick I don't know.\nQ. How were the guards treating you at Stum?\nA. The guards? As I told you, twice very bad especially the one when he came to the lazaret\nand it would you think it is here sanitary we're called which means horse |\nand the other one went with us with this group to work for the front, he was very sharp.\nSometimes somebody found something. I don't know when Andre found this it\nwas some kind of beating for this you could -- I don't know maybe he thought he didn't see it,\nbecause he was very, very --. At the end when they feel that the Russian front is coming they\nchanged a little bit. We had days where we walked more kindly, not without the shouting. This\nis the reason they felt that the end of the war was near.\nQ. Was this already in Stum?\nA. No, no, in . In it started then in . It was\nSunday, yes, I remember, one day Sunday. I was in this magazine and we had to take and to\nmake because the snow, and it was so the atmosphere was very very hectic. They feel that the\nwar maybe the Russians are coming.\nQ. How long did you stay in ?\nA. To the end. After this came the Russian soldiers. So, that it was in winter, half of\nJanuary 1945.\nQ. How many people were all together in do you know\u2019?\nA. Let's say maybe three or four hundred. When we were sent from the ;\nthere were two groups, two groups, and it was in winter. We had to go by foot and they give us\nattention. When we tried to escape they will shoot immediately. They stopped only from time to\ntime in some , to sleep there. We had sleep only on the straw so without nothing. I\nremember it was winter, very cold. When we slept there even there was between the wood the\nwind with snow would come in and you wake and you had plenty of snow. But butter there\ninstead.\nQ. Did anyone try to escape?\nA. Yes, tried, and we don't know what happened. Many, many tried. Maybe succeed or\nmaybe not succeed. I don't know. We, when I escaped, we escaped we succeeded.\nQ. Do you remember if anybody tried to escape from Stum?\nA. No, no.\nQ. And from ?\nA. No. It was too difficult. Probably nobody could in that. You see there was so surround\nand with they were watching and in concentration camp there was also the electricity. You\ncouldn't do that.\nQ. Can you describe the electricity?\nA. Around the -- it was in because in were barracks. The\nbarracks were specially built for us, I think so, because too many prisons were there. There was\nno place and it was kind of a before. And they make this for the security, for\nthemselves.\nQ. Were they wooden barracks or stone barracks?\nA. Wooden. Wooden barracks. I was never after the war, I don't believe. Because even I\nwanted to find this certain Torran. What is also my -- this house is very bad. It's standing there.\nThe baker house is standing, the prison is there, the documentation from the foundation\nwhen he go there I will show them. They will make a documentation because\nme, I'm 71, maybe tomorrow or after tomorrow I'll die and there will be no documentation. It\nmust be for the young people.\nI can forgive but not forget, especially for the young. They must know how it was difficult in the\nwar and what for, for what reason. Only for the fact that I like men. From the beginning, I'm not\nthe child of God. I was born, -- I didn't know when things happened. Maybe just the first time\nwhen ---, but it was playing. I didn't know. First, even as I told you it was not so\nsuffocated, it was in very childish way, a rather romantic way. Now, I know\neverything. Iam old and I read book. Of course it should be like I had no advantages. Not only\nadvantages, I even had three times friends because I like not to jump from one flower to another\none. I had good friends. Even just know in Poland, but he's married and this is more difficult.\nQ. It must have been also very difficult for you to go through all these years because you\nwere very young. How did you manage. Where did you get the strength to get through it?\nA. (Answers in German.) I lost my hope that I will stay alive. And especially in Koronovo,\nI had to be also absent in the bed or I felt that I forget to say how many insects there were. I\ndon't know exactly the names of these, even the lice, but you know, it's terrible. I prayed and I\nwas So -- it was for me sometimes if I should be dead. Sometimes I wished to be dead. You see,\nthen in Stum, and this again, I wanted to stay to alive and I feel that even in Stum, one day came\nvery good information that in Warsaw, this uprising, it was in August -- I'll\nnever forget, it was August 1944, came information to everybody the Polish, you know in\nWarsaw, and I said \"Oh my God, maybe it will be the end of the war.\" So, sometimes when\ncame the news it was just great for us.\nQ. Could you describe a day in and how looked?\nA. Of course I can. The barracks were let's say maybe 20 for each -- in each barracks were\nliving in two divided bigger rooms, 40 or 30 prisoners. There were also one barrack for the\nkitchen, one barrack is for the magazine. One was for the tailor and for workers like wooden\nwork. What's more there, maybe -- and around the barracks as I told you was some of that\nsound, the electrician wire. They said I don't know, I'm not sure but they blackmailed us, if\nsomebody tried they will pay with their life. Each corner was a tower, a watch tower. He\nwas with a gun and that was -- and we had each day for half an hour we have to walk because\nyou need fresh air and during the walking I met this = \u2014\u2014\u2014s~who told me I'll follow you. It was\nthis and --\nQ. When did you have to get up?\nA. It was morning, very early. It was about six o'clock. First we have to bring this way, and\nto wash there was everything, washing in cold water of course. And not in the same barrack\nwhere you were sleeping privately. There was a barrack for washing. And you came to your\nbarrack and the brought you some kind of soup. It was soup like water and a piece of\nbread. Everybody -- for me came the block meister. He took me to magazine. Me and Hendrick\nwe were together. We had a job we have to in the magazine make the order with the dresses and\nto describe the names for everybody because everybody has private dressing.\nAfter that afternoon, they came again. We stood there in this barrack. There was no\ncentral heating. We had only through -- they gave us wood, but it was warm rather, so long as\nyou put the wood. It was warm. Sometimes the guard would bring some kind of tea that\nsomebody put in the water. Some they drank, but only prisoners who had a special contact with\nsomebody. I had no contact so I couldn't do nothing. I was living, as I told you, with Hendrick.\nHe was upstairs. He was working for the tailor.\nQ. Did your mother know where you were?\nA. At this moment, she knew. She had received information that I'm -- but I never saw her.\nIt was not allowed to visit to come, no, but she knew and we have also family, relations in\nprobably across the river somebody has seen me and wrote to my mother that I am\nalive, but she told me later, when we talked, after my return from Germany, she said somebody\nsaid I am alive and she wasn't sure exactly, but her hope was a little better. First when I wrote\nthe first letter after the war, she was completely sure that I was alive.\nQ. You were not allowed to write letters during the time you were in prison?\nA. Yes. In ,. don't know. I'm not exactly -- yes, probably we could. Maybe\nonly letters, you understand, but at the end of the war when we left this, she -- she didn't receive\nany information from . Only the last, maybe from Stum or maybe I don't know. It\nwas too long time ago.\nQ. Did you receive letters from her?\nA. If I had I would like to have the documentation. What I have some very nice proof that is\nin Koronovo when I was in better position, I had some relation with some other prisoners who\nworked in cafeteria, and they make very nice friends. I send this so some of\nprisoners they were sent to make the job outside the prison. How did I do that? I paid, of course,\nwith bread and they sent to my mother and this friend I have -- and I put a picture of my mother\nthere and from foundation he was before he came here he was home he made a picture.\nQ. So you must have felt very isolated in these years not knowing how your family was, if\nthey were alive?\nA. Listen, you know, my father was not home and I loved my mother over everything, and I\ncouldn't help. I had seen how she suffered when my brother was only one month. She had\nsuffered so much, I have seen this. She cried, \"Why you give me this?\" You must understand\nthat this painful on mother. She was so happy when I returned. Therefore, I tried to go as soon\nas it was possible and I am correct, so about -- I was together. I was living in Warsaw. All\nholidays, Christmas I spent with her and I help so that in this way I'm correct and satisfied. She\nsuffered. She spent you know so she has -- I was the youngest, but then there came another one\nwhich she loved very much. Even after the war when we talked sometimes, she told me that a\nneighbor, she was something talking, and they asked \"What is the reason you?\" She said, \"I\ndon't know.\" But probably I thing so that the gay, Sigmund, maybe he said something. What\nhappened with him, I don't know. Maybe he said something. Afterwards everybody knew. But\nmy mother, she was very simple. She finished only four classes, but she never said to me \"It's all\nmy fault, or this is the reason.\" She had to suffer. No, she never said this.\nQ. Can you tell us when in , when the Russian army approached, what\nhappened?\nA. In what happened? When we had to go, it was Sunday, a very strong\nwinter. Everybody was in a hurry and then we had to pack as much as we could. Most of them\nthere was , and we went first through the frozen. I met some\nPolish, they wanted to keep up. Maybe the people, they were members of my family, but I\ncouldn't recognize. I didn't remember exactly. Then we had to go. They shouted always, \"Don't\nstop. If you stop, you'll see you'll die.\" Because it was twenty degrees below zero. It was very\ncold. I was very tired. I wanted to stop I'm sure. If I would fall, I could die immediately. You\nwere frozen. You were tired. You better go, go, go. And always they shouted don't escape. If\nyou escape, you'll pay. We'll shoot. Then because we had to count always. Always, lists, lists,\nlists.\nQ. Did also people die on this march?\nA. During the march I cannot no-- I'm not sure. I don't know. I remember only that the last\nday, there was not in this , only the school, a little warmer and then they said we\nwill be going by train. It was not normal for person to -- it was for animals and we haven't seen\nnothing. They stopped sometimes and there was . I don't know and when we\narrived in Hamberg but how they put us to the island. I remember only that the next day we have\nto go to work. The work, it was in the meadow and I remember that there were some French\nprisoners and they took at the beginning this is the green and they ate this. No, I know, this is\nvery good. And it was 28th of February, rather a little warmer but not so warmer, and they\npicked up this and they ate it so I remember.\nAfter a few days they needed some pigs. They were not for us, only for the staff for the\nblock meister. And they needed somebody. I wonder, I never worked before in this way. It was\nvery difficult because you had to make clean always. The pig were --, you have to do this. But I\nwas satisfied because I share with the pig some how you call it -- this is a kind of flavor in\npotatoes and I took, I could be full and not so hungry.\nQ. Do you remember anything from the train, how many days you had been in the train?\nA. No. There was something, water. We left to go by boat, not ship, but I don't remember.\nThis is from me just now. I knew only that the prisoners said we have run the water. He knew\nthat there is a special, it was a kind of boat and this is how you put this with the rope so that we\ncould go to the other side. But we were very anxious that somebody would shoot us. Probably it\nwas 15 miles. They knew that they didn't want to do something.\nQ. What was the name of this prison?\nA. ;\nQ. How many people were there?\nA. I don't know. When it -- it was near of Hamberg and Hamberg was always bombed, very\noften. During this bombing they opened always the door of the cell. Probably if something\nhappened -- I don't know. It was opened but nobody escaped. I had seen only in the windows,\nyou know, it was not far of this place, Hamberg.\nQ. Were you there together with people that you knew?\nA. No, no. In Hamberg, in this a cell for one, only for one. Very small.\nQ. Did you know anyone there?\nA. No. You see, when I worked with the pigs, only me alone and still alone. The few Polish\nI met during the marching morning when we had to march to take this fresh air.\nQ. (In German)\nA. No. Maybe he escaped or maybe he was there because the last time I seen he was very ill\nin , and I don't know what happened.\nQ. How did you escape from this prison?\nA. From ?\nQ. Yes.\nA. I remember I had to go and pick up for the pig , you know, because this 1s\nvitamins. It was so very bad job. My hands were always, you know. I'm making this and the\nthree Polish boys were saying, \"We're, escaping. Would you like to go?\" \"Of course, me too.\" I\nleft this cart and I joined them. They knew probably. They had prepared. Then we went, there\nwas small boat, and as I told you this boat had no for this, only rope. Maybe they\nknew it was not so far. It was maybe ten minutes and we were so lucky when we jumped off\nthis, we are now free. But we are hungry. First, we went to a and I spoke very\ngood German. I put that I'm from this and it was May and it was not so cold. One night we\nspent in the meadow. We slept there. We found some old clothes and I put a shirt and trousers\nlike from the prison without the stripes and me and the other ones, especially the ones who lives\nin , was near of Torran and we went to . He give us eating\neverything and he said okay, we said then that we are how we call this, they say\n, that we are and he says I need two jobs you can stay\nhere, but because I had the experience with the pigs, he wanted me too. But we say we would\nlike maybe we stay just a short time when we hear the news from our country, exactly and I\nsuppose he said something because after you eat, better you go. Probably he had the feeling\nsomething wrong because it was not far from this . Maybe he had recognized\nour trousers. So he said, you eat and go. Then we walked in the direction of .\nWe found some trucks with soldiers and even Polish in British uniforms were written Poland.\nThen I stopped, I shouted Polish, Polish here.\" And there was an officer and I told him that we\nare here that we are from the Prison. Please take here a seat we'll bring you to a special Polish\ndisplacement. And they brought us to some place a village. The Germans had to live from there\nin some houses and were living in . I remember very good this place\nnear of . We were living there with the Polish people. Some\nwere from the forced work and we have received from British soldiers. We had to cook because\nwe are living in the houses of Germans. The Germans had to leave for us. But the Polish people,\ninstead to work the soldiers they maybe will work in the garden everything. They do nothing so\nthey send us to Birken Belsun. Birken Belsun was also near of Linnenberg. Many Jews there\nwere but not now the prisoners free. We are living in the because the barracks\nwere destroyed I suppose. In this I didn't feel well because we couldn't go out.\nLike in prison, I had enough prison. So, this boy from and another one he said,\n\"See we go out.\" It was not like in prison. We heard that there were some transports of soldiers\nto south of Germany, and we went.\nI'll never forget it was in Hanover, I think so, and there was black American and I told\nhim that I only German. He allowed us to come in. He came some things of food and soon by\nthis truck, this train, we went to Munich because the transport of Americans went to Munich.\nWhen we arrived at Munich, I said I will stay here. From Munich it is not far to Vienna\nto my friend. I will take that but the first steps, the Americans said you must go here to the\nJudenrot. It was in . They made a special office. We went there. We said we\nhave written and we signed and we have received the displaced card. I have also here the\noriginal displaced card.\nAnd from there, the Americans sent me immediately to the hospital because they had\nseen my leg. When I was fit, I wanted to go to Poland but I received the bad news from Poland\nthat there are Russians. To Vienna I couldn't go also Russian and without working to be, then I\nstarted to work. First I received in Munich as kitchen help. It was very good. Then as a waiter I\nworked also in Dachau. In Dachau there was the war crimes for officers. It was a very nice job.\nThen I worked there until the end of my stay. When I wanted to go to Poland the American said\n\"Stay better here.\" And I received very nice recommendation. I have it in English here. He\nwrote, \"Any recommendation will be . He worked and he's going at his own\nrequest.\"\nQ. The first time when you met this British soldiers and afterwards, did any of them ask you\nwhy you exactly were in prison?\nA. No.\nQ. Did you tell anyone?\nA. The Americans, no.\nQ. Why not?\nA. You see, first of all, as I told you, this is -- I didn't know this word. I said what for\nbecause I loved a German soldier. Stupid reason. Nobody could believe me. Now, if I was to\nanswer, \"I was a homosexual.\" But at this time I was sometimes I thought in my head, what for?\nI didn't kill anyone. I was in very good friendship with some of the soldiers, this is the reason I\nhave to go to prison? When they asked me -- they didn't ask me. I told all of them I was in\nprison. There was nothing given to this question. This was nothing. A displaced person. They\nfound me my country 1s Poland and Iam in Germany. The war is to end and I am in Germany.\nQ. Do you know what happened to Willie?\nA. This is so complicated. Me, together with Lutz VanDyke, we tried to research\neverywhere. In Poland, in Germany, in Austria, and with no news, nothing. But you see, I have\nalso this document. I received, it's stupid. The same name and everything is okay, even the age\nshould be maybe the same, Willie Goetz. Only the question is he was born not in Austria, in\nGermany. It was written in German and what's more it is written that he is dead at the beginning\n-- | was arrested in '42, and he's dead in '43. During the war -- I'm not sure. I have this\ndocument. Thanks to VanDyke. I have to state he helped me a lot. Through him I received\neven the document that I was in the prison from this and this time. When I went to no security,\nfor insurance, for this time for the three years, -- longer because they give a better date, but for\nthree years they came to the tailor and I have just a little more, but first when I went for this\ndocument. It should be translated, but this translator who writes for this translation, and for me\nthey said, \"You received this from Germany? This exception, they never send this.\" Yes,\nthrough a very good friend, I said.\nMany things, he has done for me a lot. I am with him in very good friendship. He visited\nme. I'm staying always in contact. You must know I was very ill. One month ago I wanted to\ncancel my trip to America and he called me always. He wanted to send me money because I had\nkidney stones. Our health service is very bad. They sent me to the hospital and I knew in the\nhospital very bad service. They should cut me immediately and I didn't want, so I have a little\nmoney for this addition and from this money I make everything private. The special laser and it\nwas private. I paid a lot of money for it because I suffered for four weeks. Then I thought I\ncould do this. Even before I came here, first from the foundation, one of the gentlemen came to\nme. He wanted to make the picture. He made this frame of my mother. He made some\ndocuments for the documentary. He brought me from one letter from young boy.\nI never seen him, a very nice written letter. He wrote me, \"Dear Mr. Stefan, I'm astonished that -\n--\" T regret that I didn't bring this letter here --\"I'm astonished that you never hated us. You have\nsuffered so much. I read your book. I found your story very good but very touching. I want to\nhelp you if you need help then please ...\"\nQ. Did you have difficulty later on from the years you were in prison physically?\nA. Of course, many. Liver and heart. With liver always. I'm taking medicine every day.\nBut thanks in Hamberg he sent me always. This medicine I couldn't buy and not to pay because\nin Poland it would be too low, it would be not enough. Like he had private. You know I paid for\nthis the last time I was ill about ten million lotas. It is in dollars about $1,000 I had to pay\neverything private. He called me always, take private. Do this. If you need more I'll send you.\nThe last time he sent me a very nice letter and said you are going here and I am to Moscow\nbecause he works in the Ann Frank Foundation. He knows me well. He know how I suffered.\nWe worked together on this book so that we are like brothers. He knows my sorrows also and\nwe plan in the springtime I would like to make a report of my visit here in the United States of\nAmerica.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4\nQ. How did you feel about what happened?\nA. Sometimes I'm wondering that I'm still alive. That I succeed and sometimes I'm\nwondering what kind of reason that the people that do are ever able to torture the young people\nlike me. I am catholic, I forgive but forget I cannot. I cannot. Sometimes there are very heavy\nscars even now. On Sunday I was invited to American friends. They never spoke. I have to tell\nthem and in some places my voice was broke because it is everything fresh. Even during the\nwriting of this book and when I read this book I cried because I have everything\nespecially twice. When I see my mother always standing watching the prison. She didn't see me\nbut she came. She wanted to see me. I saw her, but she couldn't. Then the judge, it was terrible.\nBut, with my soul I'm correct that I return back. I could be here. Maybe I could have\nhere very good possibility for everything and maybe I would even be millionaire but I spend my\ntime with my parents and especially with my mother. She suffered so much, and the only thing\neven the education from the child she learned me how I have to be good and honest to other\npeople. If somebody did wrong I think then she said don't you think and always my teacher\nwhen I was going to the school after the war, I have to finish my examination once it was written\nwhat I could do if I could. And I was written against all enemies. I'll never forget this teacher\nshe wrote, \"The word is very good, but don't forget enemy is destruction.\" And I know this 1s for\n-- itis very good that the young German people they cannot take the responsibilities for the old,\nfor the Nazis but they are so good and I'm so touched when I receive so many letters and the\ncritique was so good. In all German languages, the reception of this book was fantastic. I'm sure\nit will be the same here.\nAs you know, yesterday, when we had this small journal interview, many ladies, they\ncame to me. They gave me business cards. They want to stay in contact. They want also to\nprint in the gay news, they want to show the world that the war and the stupid rules of the war in\nNazi time must be over, never again. Never.\nQ. When you were in Poland you didn't talk about your experiences?\nA. I couldn't. During this I couldn't, I had to lie. I said always I was in the prison and you\nknow the reason I give . Because if I did, I couldn't find job. It was\nfor gays, it was very bad time. I suppose they knew something, there is something wrong\nbecause even I finish my studies but I couldn't receive very good position. First of all, I was\nalways single. This 1s no good. Second, I was so long time in until 1947.\nUsually everybody returned and me not. I know that sometimes even in some works where I was\nworking especially they collaborate with the communists by drinking vodka they said you are so\nclever and you are so good, but you have something. You cannot advance. I knew the reason\nwas maybe this, that I was a gay, a homosexual. That was the reason.\nQ. Did you meet anyone later --?\nA. Yes, I met in Torran. I was also in Koronovo but that even the last time I was in Torran\nwith some of them was working in the war house and my brother went to him. He gave us a very\nbad time because he had some better quality goods or like that. Ihave seen him. I have met\nthree. One was the doctor, he was living in Warsaw but he's now dead. About three, I met, gay,\nfrom Koronovo.\nQ. Did they say the same thing about what it's like to be gay men?\nA. There were more, but after the war I met them in Torran and one in ,\nQ. So there were a lot of gay men in prison in Koronovo?\nA. Not so many, but there -- especially from Torran. As somebody told me there were about\n80 to 100 people arrested for homosexuality in Torran. I didn't know that in small place so many\nbut he told me so.\nQ. Who told you?\nA. The doctor. He knew, I know his name but it's not necessary. I know his first name\nbecause he was also in Warsaw and I met him very often and he told me. He had the possibility\nto see the documents because he was working there as a doctor together with the German block\nmeister but he finished before the war. He was educated as a doctor. He could work there.\nQ. Did you ever talk to the family about the years?\nA. Never, and they gave me never chance to speak about it and to feel it. I'm sure they\nknew, my brother, but only you see one sister she said to me, he's probably like\nyou because he's married and he has no children and I'm sure that he's also that. I'm sure maybe\nhe was also gay but it was little discovered because my sister said everything he had he wrote in\nthe last will to one young boy, that was in village and his wife once told me also when I met her\nin Torran that she could receive a divorcement when she go to the church because she doesn't\nsleep together with people like this. So maybe it was the same in family. I think so.\nQ. Did you talk with your parents or brother about what you went through in the prison?\nA. No, no, we like it this subject -- even when we went to other families, oh you spent some\ntime in prison what was the reason and I said, don't talk about it, this was a very bad time, don't\nmention it.\nQ. Did you tell your mother about the conditions in the prison?\nA. Oh no, I couldn't to make her -- no, no, never. I tried to do my best. Even when I was a\nstudent and came to my mother she went to bake and brought me some bread. She showed me\nthat she loved me. This subject was omitted.\n(Looking at pictures) That's me. I think I was ten years old and it was in Torran. This is\nthe main street opposite of the municipal house. This 1s the Monument.\nThat was my last holiday in Torran near . I was with Polish friends and I\nbake a cod fish which I succeed without a card, free of ration. I was here about sixteen years old.\nIt was my last holiday.\nIt's me when I was working in theater as a gypsy in operetta. That was before when I was\nsitting and this made a picture. It was not on the stage it was in the .\nThis is very important documents. This is my displaced card which I received from\nAmerican in Munich. The both sides, the first one and the other side it's very important. It has\neverything written that I am a displaced person.\nIt is written in English so that everybody knows that this is a displaced person's card and\nit's use.\nThat's me. I was here about 23, 22, no 21, maybe 21 or 22 when I was working for\nAmerican as a waiter in Dachau. There is description \"Kitchen number so and so.\" It was in\nDachau as a waiter.\nThat was in Munich when I was working as kitchen help together with a Polish guard.\nThey are working as a guard for American soldiers. He was Polish but in American uniform.\nThis is in Munich. I was here probably 21. Behind me is this house where I was living\nthere. You see how the house it's windows were without glasses. So looked Munich after the\nwar.\nThis is the documents when I was working for the American military as kitchen help as a\nwaiter.\nThis is also one document more during my work by American in Munich.\nThis is my certificate of my working as a waiter in Munich or Dachau as a waiter for\nAmerican soldiers. And there is a translation into German the same. It was my last job.\nThis is very important documents. It is the part of my documents in all the prison. I\nreceived these documents after researching five or more years and there is everything written.\nOnly something is very, very stupid because it is mentioned \"Nation unknown.\" How it is\npossible to write \"Nation unknown.\" I was arrested as a Pole. I was beaten as a Pole and they\nmention unknown. It is a stupid part of the document but I couldn't correct it because I was glad\nto receive this very important document. This is the proof that I was in the prison so long time.\nIt is there written. Everybody can see here that I was punished for five years of prison and that\nwas so long that I have to be in the prison until December 1947. It means that longer than the\nwar, but thank God I escaped and I was free earlier.\nConclusion of Interview\n"
