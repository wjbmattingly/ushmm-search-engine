        "A: This was 5:00 in the morning because as I\u2019ve said before this Jewish boy who killed the\nGerman attach\u00e9 in Paris because the German Nazis had killed the boy\u2019s parents in Poland. So he\ntook revenge and he killed this yeah, diplomat thank you. And so \u2014",

And so that same night and the next\nmorning that is called Kristallnacht. My sister and I, it was 5:00 in the morning. We were\nsleeping alone, we were home. We had nobody. And there was a knock on the door and I started\nto argue with my sister. She was older. She always wanted me to do things and I said no, Lottie,\nthis time you open the door. By the time we finished arguing they broke down the door with\nhammers and axes. And they attacked this, what is this piano called.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nJoanie: Steinway.",
        "A: Steinway, this great Steinway. Ah. With hammers and axes and my sister had gone to open\nthe door so she went down into the basement and I was sitting up in bed in my nightgown. I saw\nthese, maybe 40, 50 guys with hammers and axes starting to chop not looking for anything. So I\nsaid to myself, Marianne, in fact I said Marianna which was my German name. I said now or\nnever. So in my nightgown I dashed through them and ran into the basement where my sister was\nwaiting for me. And so we were down there without food, without drink for several days until we\nwound up going to Lottie\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s home, the Russian Jews.\nAnd yeah so we were down in the basement for several days, nothing to eat, nothing to drink and\nnever knowing when they might discover us. Somehow they never followed us down, down into\nthe basement. They didn\u2019t. They were so eager, they were so full of anxiety to kill you know.\nAnd \u2014",

        "Q: And how long did you \u2014",

        "Q: In their house. When you first came out on the street after you left your basement to go to\nthis other house, and you saw all this destruction. You saw this destruction, what \u2014",
        "A: We were scared to death and we tried not to be seen in the street at all until such time excuse\nme, until such time that we had to go to, to Frankfurt to pick up our visas to come to the United\nStates. That was a very lengthy painful thing because when my mother was still alive, we needed\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nrelatives and friends in America to send us visas that would permit us to come to the States. So\nwhen this finally arrived we at night, my sister and I went through the streets, to the train,\nrailroad station yeah. And when I came into the train my cousin in Holland was somehow I don\u2019t\nknow now how he found out about it. We may have asked someone to contact him. I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: This is early 1939.\nJoanie: Can I explain the sequence here.",
        "A: Go ahead, you don\u2019t have to ask me.\nJoanie: Ok so you stayed in the basement for a few days. And then you had the courage to run\nout to Lottie\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents\u2019 house. And you hid in that house for several months, never went\nout and you had a little boy who came and delivered food. And then you somehow found out\nthat the work that your mother had done to get you passage to America came through.",
        "A: Yes, the work that my mother had done.\nJoanie: Tell her about the Palestine cruise.",
        "A: Yeah she also, she had contacted people and relatives and friends in the States to give us visas\nbut while they were still working on all of this. It took three years anyhow. It was not an easy\nfeat so my mother -- they didn\u2019t want the Jews to leave Germany. Because they wanted to have\nall our belongings you see. And so my mother said girls, my sister and me, we\u2019re going to tell\nthem that we are going on a cruise to what was then Palestine which is now Israel. And we\u2019re\ngoing to tell them we\u2019re just going on a cruise to visit this exhibit you know. And sure enough\nthe day we wanted to leave the Nazis came, that they\u2019re big shots you know. We\u2019re here,\nFrankone [ph \u2014 German?]. We\u2019re here. You\u2019re going to -- want to leave us. My mother said oh\nno we\u2019re just going to see this exhibit there in Palestine. They went like this. They said then\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\npassport, bitte. The passport . So without the passport you\u2019re a dead duck yeah. So that\u2019s what\nhappened.\nJoanie: But when she realized things were getting so bad with Hitler, since you couldn\u2019t escape\nto Palestine, she knew that earlier some of your distant cousins had gone to America. And she\nwrote to them to start the process of getting visas.",
        "A: So what would I do without you for God\u2019s sakes.\nJoanie: And this is in 1935 she started this process.",
        "A: Because when I come back to all of this, I\u2019m like a bundle of nerves. That\u2019s why my brain\nisn\u2019t working yet. But that\u2019s what happened.\nJoanie: So somehow when you were in hiding in 1938 you heard that the visas were granted.",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t know how. Gave us the news.\nJoanie: And that\u2019s when you and Lottie had the chutzpah to leave this hiding and get on a train to\ngo to the consulate.",
        "A: We went in the middle of the night. We then to get the train and then I, when we went to the\ntrain to get our visas, my cousin who lived in Holland somehow he had been told so he was\nwaiting in the compartment. The first thing I did was I, there was another man sitting there.\nJoanie: That story came a little bit later ok so it was when you were actually on the train \u2014",
        "A: On the train yes.\nJoanie: To England. You had gotten your visas already.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "Q: So then you came back?\nJoanie: Came back and you came back to Ludwigshafen with your visas.",
        "A: Just a minute. I\u2019m very confused here. All I know is this -- that my cousin from Holland came\nto meet us in the train. And I went in and I whispered into his ear. I said Oscar can I now talk and\nsay anything I want and there was another man in the compartment who said can you imagine\nthe teachers, thank you. Oh. Excuse me. He said can you imagine what she just asked me,\nwhether she now can talk and say everything she wants you know. So we came to Holland but\nunfortunately the same thing had happened to Holland eventually. They took him and his wife to\nthe camp yeah.",
        "Q: So you got your visas, you came back to Ludwigshafen and then soon after went to England.",
        "A: Went to England yeah and my sister wanted to remain in England with friends.",
        "Q: What about her fianc\u00e9?",
        "A: That eventually was dissolved. So supposedly she -- the main reason in the beginning for her\nwanting to remain in London was because of the fianc\u00e9 but it never materialized. I didn\u2019t like\nhim anyhow so \u2014",
        "Q: When you took the voyage across to England were there other Jewish refugees?",
        "A: No, no, no. We were on, no just my sister and I and when we came to Amsterdam in Holland\nwe had no money and we needed to continue our journey. So there was a fabulous friend of my\nparents, my father\u2019s and he was Dr. Siegel and he was the head of a quinine factory in\nAmsterdam. And we called him and he came and gave us money.",
        "Q: Gave you money to go, for passage \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: To continue on, sure. We had no money. The Nazis took everything away.",
        "Q: What did you take with you when you left Germany? What did you take with you?",
        "A: I\u2019m glad you asked that. They sent in a Nazi with big black boots. Ah. And also there was a\ncardboard box there. I don\u2019t know how it \u2014 who did that and also a plain German man and the\nNazi had a list of what we were allowed to take with us. So what they wanted us to take was\nstrictly the things that my mother and father had when they were getting married. You hear. And\nall the garbage that they would allow us to take, it was absolutely ridiculous. We were standing\nthere with Nazi boots and a whip and if God forbid we did something wrong or tried to smuggle\nsomething into the box, would have been goodbye Charlie you know yeah. So \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember what you actually took with you?",
        "A: Pots and pans. Nothing. They wouldn\u2019t allow me. The guy standing with the whip.",
        "Q: Could you take any clothes with you?",
        "A: Oh wait a minute. I smuggled a ring that my mother gave me, yeah. I did smuggle a ring\nyeah.",
        "Q: Did you take any clothes with you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think this 1s going to be very easy for me cause it\u2019s\nkind of difficult yeah.",
        "Q: Painful. So you get over to England. You got to England eventually and where did you stay in\nEngland?",
        "A: All I know is I don\u2019t remember where I stayed in England. All I know is that my sister was\nbusy with her friends. And we only had so much allotment of time to spend time in London by\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nthe English government. So I said, she said she wanted to stay for a while and so I said to her,\ndon\u2019t worry. I may have been maybe 14, 15 years old. But I spoke perfect English from school\nyou know.",
        "Q: You learned English 1n school?",
        "A: And in addition to that my mother hired a woman from London and what\u2019s this.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we take a break at the moment?\nGail Schwartz: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Marianne Roberts. This is track number two. And we were\ntalking about how you and your sister got over to England. What did you want to say now?\nMarianne Roberts: And my sister was engaged and she wanted to wait for the fianc\u00e9 to come to\nLondon. And, but the fianc\u00e9 had been a bad boy. He did some business in Germany that was\nillegal and so he was not able to gain entry into London, something like that I think. He was\nrefused entry into something, must have been London. So \u2014",
        "Q: How much money did you take with you when you left Germany\u201d?",
        "A: Well, my dear, love. That was Hitler. You don\u2019t think he let us take any money.",
        "Q: You took no money?",
        "A: In other words they allowed us to take the equivalent of four American dollars to travel to\nanother continent.",
        "Q: So you stayed in London. Did you know anybody in London? Or where did you stay?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: I probably didn\u2019t stay very long but all I know is the fellow in \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stay very long\nbecause London only gave us the limitation on the amount of stay in London so we would need\nspecial permission. So me, you know being 14, 15, but I was always very sensible. I said Lottie\ndon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll go to the government and I\u2019ll get permission for us to stay longer. And sure\nenough, I went to the Home Office in London. You know what that is, the Home Office. The\nHome Office in London, government, yeah. And so I was a little kid and, but I had not only\nlearned how to speak English in school, but my mother had always wanted us to learn languages.\nSo without any further ado she hired a woman from London and she, but she spoke us the king\u2019s\nEnglish. She taught us half past, you know that. So made no difference really. So I said to my\nsister, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll go and get an extension for your stay in London.\nAnd I will continue on to America, you know.",
        "Q: You\u2019re 18, 19 at this point?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: This is in early 1939.",
        "A: 18, yeah. And \u2014",
        "Q: What was her fianc\u00e9\u2019s name?",
        "A: Her fianc\u00e9\u2019s name. Ernest. And I didn\u2019t like him at all. But he was no good anyway.",
        "Q: His last name, do you know his last name?",
        "A: Lostig, Lustig, Lostig, yeah.",
        "Q: So you tell your sister you'll go by yourself? You were very brave.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: So I told my sister, I told my sister first things first. I have to go to the English government\nfor them to give her permit an extension and also for me until I could leave for \u2014 so I made an\nappointment and I didn\u2019t think I was as old as 18. I thought I was about 16, 17 but whatever.\nAnd so this man was sitting opposite me. In my best English because not only my mother had\nhired a woman from London to give us English lessons, just for the sake of lessons, but also I\nhad English in school. In the first, the first class, the first session in school they taught us in, was\nan English lesson, the first one yeah.\nJoanie: So you got the extension for Lottie to stay but you got yourself a trip across the Atlantic.",
        "A: Yeah, just a minute, you\u2019re jumping ahead. Because I said to Lottie, don\u2019t worry. Pll go to the\nEnglish government and I\u2019ll get you an extension to stay. And so one day I found myself across\nthis man, sitting across the table and in perfect English, the king\u2019s English, I told him what\nhappened and que pasa, you know that I wanted to continue on and she wanted to stay. So he\nwas so gracious. Oh my god, he was such a nice man. I\u2019m sure he had a lot of respect for a\nyoung kid to take, to undertake such a mission you know.\nSo sure enough he granted it and she was waiting outside in the street for me. And I came out\nand I said Lottie you can stay you know.",
        "Q: Did you want to stay with her or did you really want to go to America?",
        "A: No, I wanted to go to America.",
        "Q: Even by yourself?",
        "A: [had no reason to want to remain there. She, her reason was her fianc\u00e9 that incidentally never\nmaterialized, that didn\u2019t work out but I was \u2014",
        "Q: How soon after did you sail to the United States?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: I guess very shortly. As soon as I could get a ticket to go. You know. I was always a very\nindependent person. Always, yeah.",
        "Q: Which is different than what you said when you were very young that you always depended\non your sister when you were little. When I asked you were you an independent child, you said\nyou always looked up to your sister.",
        "A: I was dependent upon her when I was very young and then furthermore when she grew older\nand she had all her own friends, I was clinging to my mother\u2019s skirts. But once I, my mother\ndied and she and I were alone, my sister, I became independent yeah.",

        "A: Oh. Cunard White Star, yeah thank you my dear.",
        "Q: Were there any other refugees on that voyage?",
        "A: No it had nothing to do with refugees. I was just, I got, bought a ticket and I went.",
        "Q: As a regular passenger?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: What did America mean to you at that age of 18?",
        "A: Freedom.",
        "Q: How did you know that?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: Well I mean I went to school and I was fairly well educated and I had one set of cousins who\nwere living in the United States and my mother when she was still alive, she tried her darnedest\nfor us to go to America. So I knew that should be my goal.",
        "Q: America. Did you have any sad thoughts about leaving Germany? Was that hard for you?",
        "A: Ach, my dear girl, you didn\u2019t know Adolf Hitler. I was thrilled to death to be able to go.",

        "A: Probably mostly Jewish. Probably. But \u2014",
        "Q: Not German?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you the correct answer to that. The Germans, the kids used to come and stick\ntheir fist in my chest and say you killed Jesus Christ so what should I love about Germany\u201d?",

Why does she\nnever come here? And she was busy. But I got a job with Eda, and she worked in a book\npublisher\u2019s office so she got me a position there as a file clerk. And I remember. The boss was a\nlittle guy, little old man. There was a big barrel at the front of the office, indoors. And people\nthrew all the paperwork in there.

So he saw evidently that we were good material. So\nhe called in the head of Picker x ray, the head and the result was that this head of Picker x ray\ncame several times to give us lessons how to take x rays. Cause the equipment was there. We\nwere so lucky that this happened to us. Then you didn\u2019t need a license. In more later years we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nhad to be state licensed by the, to be an x ray technologist. And so anyway then the doctor made\nmore money because he was able to x ray patients and we got a salary and all was well. So that\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "Q: And then, did you have a social life at all\u2019? Did you meet anybody?",

Didn\u2019t I mention that and so this woman, mean, well meaning, she pulled me\naside and she says your sister is taking away the guy, the boyfriend from Celia, from the doctor\u2019s\nsecretary. She said you should be the one to be taking a guy or whatever. But of course that was\nnot my cup of tea. And \u2014",

And he said to me, Marianne, I would like to ask you how about speaking\nabout it. And this is what got me started. I very soon after I found myself before 1000 temple\nmembers. He was a very young modern rabbi. And I found myself before 1000 temple members\nand standing up there and I was looking around and I said to myself, how come you don\u2019t feel\nanything? It\u2019s because of my youth. My parents owned movie houses. We were always in the\nlimelight. And I always had to shake hands and say good day and make a curtsey. You know\nwhen I was a child. So this is why to this day, nothing bothers me. Nothing bothers me. I\u2019m a\nlucky duck really to say nothing bothers me.\nAnd so the rabbi had asked me to \u2014 there were a thousand people in our congregation which was\na reform congregation and I spoke and I had, he had --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",

        "Q: And you were willing to say what had happened?",
        "A: Well I don\u2019t remember, but I\u2019m sure that I must have said, maybe I didn\u2019t talk about it too\nmuch, yeah.",
        "Q: When you meet people from, Jews from Germany or other countries in Europe, do you feel a\nspecial connection to them?",

        "Q: How did she know so much about the United States and what do you attribute that to?",
        "A: The Jewish people were all talking about the haven, the United States. And which other\ncountry would take in Jewish people. It was a mixture, a m\u00e9lange of different things. That, the\nUnited States was the, the \u2014 and that in the United States people could live and have freedom.\nThat\u2019s what we didn\u2019t have in Germany, you know.",
        "Q: When you meet a German today, what are your thoughts, a non-Jewish German?",
        "A: A non-Jewish German? Well of course I can very easily say I have no love for any one of\nthem, because I remember some very sad things in Germany. When I was a little girl and I was\nmaybe in third grade, and there was one girl, Gentile J, a Gentile girl who was very beautiful and\nI admired her so for her beauty. And we went home with the same trolley car. So she sat near\nthe window and I sat on the inside. And I always admired this girl for her beauty. And so this\nwas the first time we had a real good conversation. And then I was the first one to get off the\ntrolley car because I, that was home. And as I got up and walked away, there were two seats\nbetween her and me. She looked at me after all the nice conversation we had and she said you\ndirty Jew. So I said to myself, how could you love people like that really. You dirty Jew she\nsaid. And then I remember in front of our movies, there used to be other kids my age. And really\na little bit older perhaps and they would put their fists into my chest and say you killed Jesus\nChrist. So I personally did this you know.",

        "A: Well it was yes. Yes, destroyed but disfigured. They made a candy store out of it. I was sick\nyou know. I was sorry, I had Joanie with me to see, because I always told her how that it could\nhave stood. We always have said that the movies could have been here on Broadway. It was so\ngorgeous cause my father was such an entrepreneur. He had such great big wonderful ideas. But,\nC\u2019est la vie. What can you do?

        "A: Yeah, all right.",
        "Q: You had a picture taken, by whom?",
        "A: Yes, as a matter of fact I did. You see each city was able to devise plans to embarrass and\nhurt the Jew. So therefore in our particular city the guys who ran the city hall, they were a bunch\nof, ah. So they called me up and I should come over to city hall. So I went. I don\u2019t remember\nwhether my sister was with me. I think I was alone. I was about 14 years old or 16.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nJoanie: 16.",

Yeah.\nSo then I ok so I went to them. And they asked me questions and so on. So finally they said ok.\nExpose your left ear. I was afraid to ask why. So I looked and they said, the Jewish left ear is\ndifferent from Gentile left ears. So I knew that this was such garbage like I never heard in my life\nyou know. But I didn\u2019t dare oppose them. So this is the picture they took of me here. With the\nleft ear exposed. I look like I was 16 years old here. I look like I was 90. Look how dejected I\nam. Yeah, disgusted.",
        "Q: They gave you a copy of the picture?\nJoanie: This is the original.",

        "Q: Did anybody else you know have to do that or were you the only \u2014",
        "A: I really wouldn\u2019t know. I was so disgusted and so glad to get the hell out of there, that I didn\u2019t\ncare who else had to do, expose their ear. Bunch of idiots. In other words each city comprised\ntheir own way to humiliate us. That\u2019s all I can say. I look like an old lady on here. Take a look\nat this. I\u2019m 16 years old. Look at this. I\u2019m so dejected yeah.",

        "A: She contracted an illness. She had pancreatic cancer yeah. Now what would I do without you?\nAnd that\u2019s how she died, yeah. That was, we were fortunate there was still one Jewish hospital\nleft in town so that\u2019s where she went, yeah.",
        "A: Well in the beginning we were still able to go into the store but I remember distinctly I was\nin the store and I was at the head of the line in the grocery store. And I wanted something and the\nguy said the Jews go on the back of the line and he had known us forever and ever. Such a\nmiserable thing here.",

        "A: Well there was a sum set aside because we were without parents. I don\u2019t know whether my\nparents decreed this or what. And so but the Germans eventually said we have to -- girls you\nhave to give us all of your money because we have to send it to Berlin. They probably pocketed\nit you know.",
        "A: You know it\u2019s not exactly easy thinking back of those horrible things.\nJoanie: do you need to take a break?",
        "A: No, if Ido Ill tell you.",
        "A: This was 5:00 in the morning because as I\u2019ve said before this Jewish boy who killed the\nGerman attach\u00e9 in Paris because the German Nazis had killed the boy\u2019s parents in Poland. So he\ntook revenge and he killed this yeah, diplomat thank you. And so \u2014",
        "A: It was five, so what happened was that the moment that boy killed this guy in Paris, Hitler got\non the phone and he said the Jews are going to pay for this. And so that same night and the next\nmorning that is called Kristallnacht. My sister and I, it was 5:00 in the morning. We were\nsleeping alone, we were home. We had nobody. And there was a knock on the door and I started\nto argue with my sister. She was older. She always wanted me to do things and I said no, Lottie,\nthis time you open the door. By the time we finished arguing they broke down the door with\nhammers and axes. And they attacked this, what is this piano called.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nJoanie: Steinway.",
        "A: Steinway, this great Steinway. Ah. With hammers and axes and my sister had gone to open\nthe door so she went down into the basement and I was sitting up in bed in my nightgown. I saw\nthese, maybe 40, 50 guys with hammers and axes starting to chop not looking for anything. So I\nsaid to myself, Marianne, in fact I said Marianna which was my German name. I said now or\nnever. So in my nightgown I dashed through them and ran into the basement where my sister was\nwaiting for me. And so we were down there without food, without drink for several days until we\nwound up going to Lottie\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s home, the Russian Jews.\nAnd yeah so we were down in the basement for several days, nothing to eat, nothing to drink and\nnever knowing when they might discover us. Somehow they never followed us down, down into\nthe basement. They didn\u2019t. They were so eager, they were so full of anxiety to kill you know.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: And I think they were Russian Jews so \u2014",
        "A: We stayed there for a while until they came and took all the men the Russian and Polish men\nJewish to concentration camps.\nJoanie: It was several months that you were in hiding.",
        "A: We were scared to death and we tried not to be seen in the street at all until such time excuse\nme, until such time that we had to go to, to Frankfurt to pick up our visas to come to the United\nStates. That was a very lengthy painful thing because when my mother was still alive, we needed\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nrelatives and friends in America to send us visas that would permit us to come to the States. So\nwhen this finally arrived we at night, my sister and I went through the streets, to the train,\nrailroad station yeah. And when I came into the train my cousin in Holland was somehow I don\u2019t\nknow now how he found out about it. We may have asked someone to contact him. I don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "A: Go ahead, you don\u2019t have to ask me.\nJoanie: Ok so you stayed in the basement for a few days. And then you had the courage to run\nout to Lottie\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents\u2019 house. And you hid in that house for several months, never went\nout and you had a little boy who came and delivered food. And then you somehow found out\nthat the work that your mother had done to get you passage to America came through.",
        "A: Yes, the work that my mother had done.\nJoanie: Tell her about the Palestine cruise.",
        "A: Yeah she also, she had contacted people and relatives and friends in the States to give us visas\nbut while they were still working on all of this. It took three years anyhow. It was not an easy\nfeat so my mother -- they didn\u2019t want the Jews to leave Germany. Because they wanted to have\nall our belongings you see. And so my mother said girls, my sister and me, we\u2019re going to tell\nthem that we are going on a cruise to what was then Palestine which is now Israel. And we\u2019re\ngoing to tell them we\u2019re just going on a cruise to visit this exhibit you know. And sure enough\nthe day we wanted to leave the Nazis came, that they\u2019re big shots you know. We\u2019re here,\nFrankone [ph \u2014 German?]. We\u2019re here. You\u2019re going to -- want to leave us. My mother said oh\nno we\u2019re just going to see this exhibit there in Palestine. They went like this. They said then\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\npassport, bitte. The passport . So without the passport you\u2019re a dead duck yeah. So that\u2019s what\nhappened.\nJoanie: But when she realized things were getting so bad with Hitler, since you couldn\u2019t escape\nto Palestine, she knew that earlier some of your distant cousins had gone to America. And she\nwrote to them to start the process of getting visas.",
        "A: So what would I do without you for God\u2019s sakes.\nJoanie: And this is in 1935 she started this process.",
        "A: Because when I come back to all of this, I\u2019m like a bundle of nerves. That\u2019s why my brain\nisn\u2019t working yet. But that\u2019s what happened.\nJoanie: So somehow when you were in hiding in 1938 you heard that the visas were granted.",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t know how. Gave us the news.\nJoanie: And that\u2019s when you and Lottie had the chutzpah to leave this hiding and get on a train to\ngo to the consulate.",
        "A: We went in the middle of the night. We then to get the train and then I, when we went to the\ntrain to get our visas, my cousin who lived in Holland somehow he had been told so he was\nwaiting in the compartment. The first thing I did was I, there was another man sitting there.\nJoanie: That story came a little bit later ok so it was when you were actually on the train \u2014",
        "A: On the train yes.\nJoanie: To England. You had gotten your visas already.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: Just a minute. I\u2019m very confused here. All I know is this -- that my cousin from Holland came\nto meet us in the train. And I went in and I whispered into his ear. I said Oscar can I now talk and\nsay anything I want and there was another man in the compartment who said can you imagine\nthe teachers, thank you. Oh. Excuse me. He said can you imagine what she just asked me,\nwhether she now can talk and say everything she wants you know. So we came to Holland but\nunfortunately the same thing had happened to Holland eventually. They took him and his wife to\nthe camp yeah.",
        "A: Went to England yeah and my sister wanted to remain in England with friends.",
        "A: That eventually was dissolved. So supposedly she -- the main reason in the beginning for her\nwanting to remain in London was because of the fianc\u00e9 but it never materialized. I didn\u2019t like\nhim anyhow so \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no. We were on, no just my sister and I and when we came to Amsterdam in Holland\nwe had no money and we needed to continue our journey. So there was a fabulous friend of my\nparents, my father\u2019s and he was Dr. Siegel and he was the head of a quinine factory in\nAmsterdam. And we called him and he came and gave us money.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: To continue on, sure. We had no money. The Nazis took everything away.",
        "A: I\u2019m glad you asked that. They sent in a Nazi with big black boots. Ah. And also there was a\ncardboard box there. I don\u2019t know how it \u2014 who did that and also a plain German man and the\nNazi had a list of what we were allowed to take with us. So what they wanted us to take was\nstrictly the things that my mother and father had when they were getting married. You hear. And\nall the garbage that they would allow us to take, it was absolutely ridiculous. We were standing\nthere with Nazi boots and a whip and if God forbid we did something wrong or tried to smuggle\nsomething into the box, would have been goodbye Charlie you know yeah. So \u2014",
        "A: Pots and pans. Nothing. They wouldn\u2019t allow me. The guy standing with the whip.",
        "A: Oh wait a minute. I smuggled a ring that my mother gave me, yeah. I did smuggle a ring\nyeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think this 1s going to be very easy for me cause it\u2019s\nkind of difficult yeah.",
        "A: All I know is I don\u2019t remember where I stayed in England. All I know is that my sister was\nbusy with her friends. And we only had so much allotment of time to spend time in London by\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nthe English government. So I said, she said she wanted to stay for a while and so I said to her,\ndon\u2019t worry. I may have been maybe 14, 15 years old. But I spoke perfect English from school\nyou know.",
        "A: And in addition to that my mother hired a woman from London and what\u2019s this.",
        "A: Well, my dear, love. That was Hitler. You don\u2019t think he let us take any money.",
        "A: In other words they allowed us to take the equivalent of four American dollars to travel to\nanother continent.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: I probably didn\u2019t stay very long but all I know is the fellow in \u2014 I couldn\u2019t stay very long\nbecause London only gave us the limitation on the amount of stay in London so we would need\nspecial permission. So me, you know being 14, 15, but I was always very sensible. I said Lottie\ndon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll go to the government and I\u2019ll get permission for us to stay longer. And sure\nenough, I went to the Home Office in London. You know what that is, the Home Office. The\nHome Office in London, government, yeah. And so I was a little kid and, but I had not only\nlearned how to speak English in school, but my mother had always wanted us to learn languages.\nSo without any further ado she hired a woman from London and she, but she spoke us the king\u2019s\nEnglish. She taught us half past, you know that. So made no difference really. So I said to my\nsister, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll go and get an extension for your stay in London.\nAnd I will continue on to America, you know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: 18, yeah. And \u2014",
        "A: Her fianc\u00e9\u2019s name. Ernest. And I didn\u2019t like him at all. But he was no good anyway.",
        "A: Lostig, Lustig, Lostig, yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: So I told my sister, I told my sister first things first. I have to go to the English government\nfor them to give her permit an extension and also for me until I could leave for \u2014 so I made an\nappointment and I didn\u2019t think I was as old as 18. I thought I was about 16, 17 but whatever.\nAnd so this man was sitting opposite me. In my best English because not only my mother had\nhired a woman from London to give us English lessons, just for the sake of lessons, but also I\nhad English in school. In the first, the first class, the first session in school they taught us in, was\nan English lesson, the first one yeah.\nJoanie: So you got the extension for Lottie to stay but you got yourself a trip across the Atlantic.",
        "A: Yeah, just a minute, you\u2019re jumping ahead. Because I said to Lottie, don\u2019t worry. Pll go to the\nEnglish government and I\u2019ll get you an extension to stay. And so one day I found myself across\nthis man, sitting across the table and in perfect English, the king\u2019s English, I told him what\nhappened and que pasa, you know that I wanted to continue on and she wanted to stay. So he\nwas so gracious. Oh my god, he was such a nice man. I\u2019m sure he had a lot of respect for a\nyoung kid to take, to undertake such a mission you know.\nSo sure enough he granted it and she was waiting outside in the street for me. And I came out\nand I said Lottie you can stay you know.",
        "A: No, I wanted to go to America.",
        "A: [had no reason to want to remain there. She, her reason was her fianc\u00e9 that incidentally never\nmaterialized, that didn\u2019t work out but I was \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: I guess very shortly. As soon as I could get a ticket to go. You know. I was always a very\nindependent person. Always, yeah.",
        "A: I was dependent upon her when I was very young and then furthermore when she grew older\nand she had all her own friends, I was clinging to my mother\u2019s skirts. But once I, my mother\ndied and she and I were alone, my sister, I became independent yeah.",
        "A: Oh. Cunard White Star, yeah thank you my dear.",
        "A: No it had nothing to do with refugees. I was just, I got, bought a ticket and I went.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Freedom.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: Well I mean I went to school and I was fairly well educated and I had one set of cousins who\nwere living in the United States and my mother when she was still alive, she tried her darnedest\nfor us to go to America. So I knew that should be my goal.",
        "A: Ach, my dear girl, you didn\u2019t know Adolf Hitler. I was thrilled to death to be able to go.",
        "A: Probably mostly Jewish. Probably. But \u2014",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell you the correct answer to that. The Germans, the kids used to come and stick\ntheir fist in my chest and say you killed Jesus Christ so what should I love about Germany\u201d?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Of the voyage. Yeah well one of the officers tried to date me but I was in no condition.\nJoanie: So one story you used to tell me was that when you left Liverpool and you saw England\nbehind you, you said never look back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: Yeah because I was with my back to the boat the way it was going. And I said to myself,\nMarianna never look back. It was a new start and I was a kid. You know.",
        "A: When I saw the Statue of Liberty, I really was all shook up. That\u2019s true.",
        "A: Some distant cousins. A husband and wife and I stayed with them for just a few days.",
        "A: Yeah, downtown New York. And the English was Anglish. And it was \u2014 toity toid street on\nthe toid floor. That\u2019s what it was yeah.",
        "A: I stayed with them for a few days and then they got me a position in Brooklyn where there\nwere all two family homes, with a lovely Jewish family as a companion to their daughter, who\nwas my age yeah. So that was very nice yeah. And I remember they always used to say how\ncome that you always have to go to your sister? How come she never comes here?",
        "A: Really.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: Why did she come shortly after? What happened?\nJoanie: Because she only had an extension for a few weeks to stay in England.",
        "A: I was the one that got her the extension, yeah.",
        "A: No she didn\u2019t join me and the people for whom I was working, they always used to say to me,\nI don\u2019t understand. You always have to go on your day off to see your sister. Why does she\nnever come here? And she was busy. But I got a job with Eda, and she worked in a book\npublisher\u2019s office so she got me a position there as a file clerk. And I remember. The boss was a\nlittle guy, little old man. There was a big barrel at the front of the office, indoors. And people\nthrew all the paperwork in there. And he used to climb into, this guy and jump up and down and\nit was so funny.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know for how long.",
        "A: Well then, all I know is eventually my sister and I got a position at a doctor\u2019s office in Coney\nIsland and so first we grew up as receptionists and then the doctor showed us, he had a spare\nroom lined up totally with x ray equipment. So he saw evidently that we were good material. So\nhe called in the head of Picker x ray, the head and the result was that this head of Picker x ray\ncame several times to give us lessons how to take x rays. Cause the equipment was there. We\nwere so lucky that this happened to us. Then you didn\u2019t need a license. In more later years we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nhad to be state licensed by the, to be an x ray technologist. And so anyway then the doctor made\nmore money because he was able to x ray patients and we got a salary and all was well. So that\u2019s\nwhat happened.",
        "A: Well my sister was the social butterfly and the woman, the neighbor who lived over there in\nthe doctor\u2019s upstairs the doctor\u2019s office, she once pulled me aside and she said my sister was the\ndivorcee after all. Didn\u2019t I mention that and so this woman, mean, well meaning, she pulled me\naside and she says your sister is taking away the guy, the boyfriend from Celia, from the doctor\u2019s\nsecretary. She said you should be the one to be taking a guy or whatever. But of course that was\nnot my cup of tea. And \u2014",
        "A: Well the doctor\u2019s office had \u2014 was a house and upstairs was like a railroad apartment. That\nwas empty so we lived upstairs and we were on call for the doctor day and night. It was \u2014",
        "A: Ah, I don\u2019t remember.\nJoanie: Were you still there when you met dad?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so no, I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: Ah, I know. In those days in Brooklyn there used to be dances, social dances and so I had a\nfriend and she said, she was a do-er and go-er and she come, Marianne, let\u2019s go to the dance. So\nthis is how I met Murray, yeah, yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: June, July the 22\u2122. 49.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Was my husband what?",
        "A: No, he was American, yeah. And it was not the best choice for me. No, no. C\u2019est la vie, such\nis life.",
        "A: Yes. Two very wonderful children. My son Noah and Joan. And they are wonderful.",
        "A: One time. It was a business deal. My husband and I, we had to go back and the mayor of the\n\u2014 there came a time (sigh) there came a time when the German government told each mayor to\ninvite the Jewish people that had been thrown out of there. And to show them a wonderful time.\nIn other words, this is like in Spain. In Spain the Jewish were \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: So yeah.\nJoanie: We went back in 1997.",
        "A: To Germany.\nJoanie: Or 1998.",
        "A: So they were certainly showing us a wonderful time and everything but \u2014",
        "A: I went there once and it was enough for me. Of course my parents\u2019 graves are there so I\ncouldn\u2019t find my mother\u2019s grave, but my father\u2019s grave I could because he was at the very\nbeginning of the Jewish cemetery. It had just been opened, but my mother\u2019s grave I couldn\u2019t\nfind.",
        "A: Who is my extended family?",
        "A: Cousins. They ---",
        "A: Well the cousins were the first ones to come to the United States and to Israel.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: But that was before when I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember whether it was at the beginning of\nHitler. Whatever it was, they had a reason to flee as quickly as possible. Must have been Hitler.",
        "A: Oh no. my children were raised the way I wanted to raise them. It, are you asking me\nwhether I asked my children to hate Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, she always, Joanie always says to me, mom you can do anything. And I said you know\nwhy. Because I went through a lot of tough times. That\u2019s what it is.",
        "A: They never had to thank God, to go through what I went through so there was no need for\ncomparison.\nJoanie: But you did not speak about Germany at all until we were grown up.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: I was not aware of that. Would you believe this? I was not aware of it. Because something\nhad happened and it never occurred to me that it might be of value to you children to hear about\nit. Because it was not a good news. No.",
        "A: Jewish people were never able to join those \u2014",
        "A: My civil rights movement is the fact that for years and years and hopefully much longer,\nanywhere and every place I get up and I speak about the Holocaust. Anywhere and everywhere.\nThis is my, this is my gift.",
        "A: In schools, in colleges, in universities. Any club that wants to hear. I have spoken for example\nI swear to you, in front of a thousand students in Chapel Hill, I remember. What\u2019s her name was\nwith me, in fact. And she came in to see how it was done. Which I didn\u2019t know here. So \u2014\nJoanie: Just this spring, 2012, you have spoken in front of 900 eighth graders who were studying\nthe Holocaust.",
        "A: And many more besides that yeah.",
        "A: Why?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: I do it because of what I went through. Yeah.",
        "A: Not to honor Hitler.\nJoanie: But as you say in your speeches, this must never happen again.",
        "A: So there\u2019s your answer actually. It must never happen again because I\u2019ve had my share and,\nand other children shouldn\u2019t have to go through this.",
        "A: Well it depends who is in government. How, how fair people are who are in present\ngovernment. I would not want it to happen to a dog, really. I don\u2019t believe. I cannot say I don\u2019t\nbelieve it will never happen again because I don\u2019t know who 1s in charge.",
        "A: I feel \u2019ve come home. I am so elated to be here today, you have no idea.",
        "A: Because of the relationship and the memories it brings, good and bad. This is my field, the\nHolocaust Museum. I am very happy. And don\u2019t think for one moment I appreciate so much\nwhat you are doing. But I can tell you it ain\u2019t easy. It isn\u2019t really. And but it\u2019s something that\nneeds to be done. It needs to be talked about that this should never ever happen again. And the\nmore people hear about it, the more important it is. It 1s yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nJoanie: This has been your mission in life for the last 20 years.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yes. I mean --",
        "A: The rabbi, the rabbi asked on the day of the Holocaust that six people of his members in\ntemple, would come up and light six candles, light, each one light a candle.",
        "A: This was, was this in North Carolina?\nJoanie: That was in Florida.",
        "A: In Florida, so yeah Florida. What would I do without you? So anyway, then he said to me so\nthen I lit the candle. And he said to me, Marianne, I would like to ask you how about speaking\nabout it. And this is what got me started. I very soon after I found myself before 1000 temple\nmembers. He was a very young modern rabbi. And I found myself before 1000 temple members\nand standing up there and I was looking around and I said to myself, how come you don\u2019t feel\nanything? It\u2019s because of my youth. My parents owned movie houses. We were always in the\nlimelight. And I always had to shake hands and say good day and make a curtsey. You know\nwhen I was a child. So this is why to this day, nothing bothers me. Nothing bothers me. I\u2019m a\nlucky duck really to say nothing bothers me.\nAnd so the rabbi had asked me to \u2014 there were a thousand people in our congregation which was\na reform congregation and I spoke and I had, he had --\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: Applause yeah and from that, the next step was the high school in back of the temple, again\nthey brought all the different classes in. A thousand students and from that day on, that was it\nyeah.",
        "A: Well of course, because I spoke with a foreign accent.",
        "A: Well I don\u2019t remember, but I\u2019m sure that I must have said, maybe I didn\u2019t talk about it too\nmuch, yeah.",
        "A: I tell you the truth, I have not as yet met any Jewish people that came from the same\nenvironment. They, some Polish people, yes. But the Polish people suffered a great deal but not\nfrom Germany.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: I think I\u2019m emptied out. I\u2019m a lucky duck to be living in the United States, that\u2019s all I have to\nsay. And my mother always wanted to and unfortunately you know she couldn\u2019t come with us\nbut \u2014",
        "A: The Jewish people were all talking about the haven, the United States. And which other\ncountry would take in Jewish people. It was a mixture, a m\u00e9lange of different things. That, the\nUnited States was the, the \u2014 and that in the United States people could live and have freedom.\nThat\u2019s what we didn\u2019t have in Germany, you know.",
        "A: A non-Jewish German? Well of course I can very easily say I have no love for any one of\nthem, because I remember some very sad things in Germany. When I was a little girl and I was\nmaybe in third grade, and there was one girl, Gentile J, a Gentile girl who was very beautiful and\nI admired her so for her beauty. And we went home with the same trolley car. So she sat near\nthe window and I sat on the inside. And I always admired this girl for her beauty. And so this\nwas the first time we had a real good conversation. And then I was the first one to get off the\ntrolley car because I, that was home. And as I got up and walked away, there were two seats\nbetween her and me. She looked at me after all the nice conversation we had and she said you\ndirty Jew. So I said to myself, how could you love people like that really. You dirty Jew she\nsaid. And then I remember in front of our movies, there used to be other kids my age. And really\na little bit older perhaps and they would put their fists into my chest and say you killed Jesus\nChrist. So I personally did this you know.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: Well yes. It was. And also they made such a horrible mess of it. You remember yeah. It was\nvery sad to \u2014 they destroyed it.",
        "A: I think they made a candy store out of it. My father \u2014",
        "A: The Rheingold. Rheingold because it was near the river Rhine. And Rheingold was a big deal\nover there. The gold of the Rhine. And \u2014",
        "A: Well it was yes. Yes, destroyed but disfigured. They made a candy store out of it. I was sick\nyou know. I was sorry, I had Joanie with me to see, because I always told her how that it could\nhave stood. We always have said that the movies could have been here on Broadway. It was so\ngorgeous cause my father was such an entrepreneur. He had such great big wonderful ideas. But,\nC\u2019est la vie. What can you do? I look pretty disgusted here, don\u2019t I?\nJoanie: Mom, this is the left ear picture. Can you tell her about that?",
        "A: Yeah, all right.",
        "A: Yes, as a matter of fact I did. You see each city was able to devise plans to embarrass and\nhurt the Jew. So therefore in our particular city the guys who ran the city hall, they were a bunch\nof, ah. So they called me up and I should come over to city hall. So I went. I don\u2019t remember\nwhether my sister was with me. I think I was alone. I was about 14 years old or 16.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012\nJoanie: 16.",
        "A: 16. Yeah so I came to city hall and they elevator there it goes, it never stops. The elevator\ngoing upstairs in city hall. It never stops. You have to leap upon, onto the elevator. Yeah. Yeah.\nSo then I ok so I went to them. And they asked me questions and so on. So finally they said ok.\nExpose your left ear. I was afraid to ask why. So I looked and they said, the Jewish left ear is\ndifferent from Gentile left ears. So I knew that this was such garbage like I never heard in my life\nyou know. But I didn\u2019t dare oppose them. So this is the picture they took of me here. With the\nleft ear exposed. I look like I was 16 years old here. I look like I was 90. Look how dejected I\nam. Yeah, disgusted.",
        "A: I guess they must have. It\u2019s many a moon ago you know.\nJoanie: And then they asked you to sign your name as Sarah.",
        "A: I signed my name as Sarah. And the men\u2019s name would be Israel. Yeah, yeah.\nJoanie: It was an identification card that they made for you in this picture.",
        "A: So that\u2019s why we have this, the Holocaust Museum here they have this picture up on the wall.\nYeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nApril 11, 2012",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.\nJoanie: She probably did but we don\u2019t have the picture.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: I really wouldn\u2019t know. I was so disgusted and so glad to get the hell out of there, that I didn\u2019t\ncare who else had to do, expose their ear. Bunch of idiots. In other words each city comprised\ntheir own way to humiliate us. That\u2019s all I can say. I look like an old lady on here. Take a look\nat this. I\u2019m 16 years old. Look at this. I\u2019m so dejected yeah.",
        "A: I think if we don\u2019t finish pretty soon then I\u2019m going to disappear from this earth.",
        "A: Thank you for asking me.",
        "A: Thank you for asking me really. Yeah. It\u2019s you know, after a while you become so angry\nwhen you have to rehash this whole thing and that\u2019s what started to happen to me. I became so\nworn out. Yeah.\n"
