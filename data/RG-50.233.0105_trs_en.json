        "A: Hello. How are you?",
        "Q: Fine. How are you?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Feel like remembering?",
        "A: Not really, but PIl give it a try.",
        "Q: Okay. When were you born?",
        "A: I was born in February 6, 1929 on a very cold day I\u2019m told.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And where?",
        "A: In Germany.",
        "Q: In Germany.",
        "A: In a little village called Hoffenheim near Heidelberg in the province of Baden.",
        "Q: Supposedly it\u2019s a nice area.",
        "A: Well, it....] returned there recently and I was surprised how charming it is. Yes, I must admit, it\nis very nice.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of growing up in this town?",
        "A: Oh, yes. I remember a lot of things. I lived there until I was ten or eleven years old so I have a\nlot of good -- eh -- a lot of memories.",
        "Q: Did you have any brothers and sisters?",
        "A: Yes. I have one brother named Menachem. He currently lives in Israel.",
        "Q: And he was the younger brother?",
        "A: He was younger by three years, yes.",
        "Q: And how about your parents? Can you tell us something about your parents? Who they were,\nwhat they did?",
        "A: Yes. Well, my mother was a typical housewife of its day. My father was in business as a\nbutcher. And they tried to make a living to support us as long as they managed to do it.",
        "Q: Your father was a butcher in Humfenheim?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you live in an apartment or your own house?",
        "A: Well we lived in an apartment and then as a sort of -- because the Jewish community was very\nsmall there, on the time we were deported there was as few as ten families, my father acted as a\ncantor. When the regular cantor left or died, I\u2019m not sure, we ended up in an apartment which\nwas adjoining to the synagogue. So we lived there until the Kristallnacht when, of course, the\nsynagogue was destroyed and we had to move out of the apartment very quickly. We moved in\nwith an uncle who lived in that same town.",
        "Q: So you lived in three different apartments in a short period?",
        "A: Well, as I can remember, it was over a ten -year period.-",
        "Q: So your father\u2019s butcher shop, that was separate, away from the apartment buildings?",
        "A: Yeah, correct.",
        "Q: Both of your parents were Jewish?",
        "A: Yes, they were.",
        "Q: Were they Reform, or Conservative, or Orthodox?",
        "A: Gee, I really don\u2019t know. But I think it\u2019s a typical German traditional, I think.",
        "Q: Most likely Conservative?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe we ate kosher in the latter years. It may well be that in early years we were but\nI\u2019m really not aware of it.",
        "Q: Do you remember what these apartments were like that you lived in?",
        "A: Not in any great detail. I -- the only vague memory I have is when I was perhaps three years\nold, and I believe it was about the time my brother was born. I remember very vividly a mouse\nplaying under his crib, that I kept watching.",
        "Q: A real mouse?",
        "A: A real mouse. And that\u2019s about all I can remember.",
        "Q: And he wasn\u2019t your pet mouse?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know where the mouse came from.",
        "Q: Did you have any pets?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, no.",
        "Q: Hobbies?",
        "A: No, not really. By the time I, you know, 1933 was not very far away, I was four years old, and\nthe little kids in the street very quickly stopped playing with us and would rather beat us up, so\nthere was very little time for hobbies. It was more a question of protection.",
        "Q: Did any of the kids ever beat you up?",
        "A: Oh yeah, quite frequently and I learned to run as fast as my little legs could carry me.",
        "Q: You mentioned that there were very few Jews in this town and I imagine half of them were\nrelatives.",
        "A: Not really. I think we, my brother and I, and another girl were the only children that I can\nremember.",
        "Q: And you had at least one uncle.",
        "A: Yes, but he didn\u2019t live in that same town.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you ever get to go to school?",
        "A: Yes. I started school when I was six, which I guess means 1935, and went to school for about\ntwo years, till --- or perhaps it was three, I\u2019m not sure. No, it was two years. Till they\nprohibited Jewish kids from going to the public schools. And I was then enrolled in a Jewish\noperated school in Heidelberg. And every morning I had to get up about six and take a train all\nby myself to go to Heidelberg and in the evening I returned home. I did this for one or two\nyears, well until the Kristallnacht, and then I think that school closed. One or two years, yeah.",
        "Q: How was it like going to school as one of the few Jewish kids?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have very much memory of the school, except that there was a lot of persecution. I was\nasked to leave the room when they talked about Nazi indoctrination, which of course made us\nlittle Jewish boys stick out like a sore thumb. And of course, whenever the kids could catch me\nthey would either push me into the --- some --- the embankment that fell up from the road, or\nbeat me up otherwise --- anything they could do. Recently, I returned to Germany. This is an\naside. And the seminary student, who 1s 28 years old wrote a thesis on the life of the Jewish\ncommunity in this town. And he found a lot of details about the history of the community, and\nmyself and my family, and so on. Things that I didn\u2019t know, I had forgotten. And, in fact, he\nfound my school records. And I had forgotten all my grades, but I can tell you they were\nterrible.",
        "Q: You were a terrible student?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s not surprising.",
        "Q: Or, how did the teachers treat you? That was my next question, anyway.",
        "A: How what?",
        "Q: How did the teachers treat you? Sometimes people had terrible grades but they were good\nstudents.",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t remember. I think all the teachers were Nazis, ultimately. Otherwise I don\u2019t\nthink they could teach. And I think as long as he had to put up with me he did, and when I was\nprohibited from attending, I guess --- I really don\u2019t know. But I was surprised to find my grades\nafter about 50 years, you know. Wasn\u2019t particularly paramount on my mind.",
        "Q: No. Even then.",
        "A: I have the piece of paper, if you want to look at it.",
        "Q: That piece, his thesis, oh, the book, the research. That would be interesting.",
        "A: It\u2019s quite amazing. It\u2019s quite an experience to meet these Germans. In fact, it\u2019s something I\u2019d\nlike to talk to you about later.",
        "Q: The rest of the town, were they, uh, was it more of a Protestant town or a Catholic town?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what the percentages was, but I have the impression it was maybe 80/20\nProtestant, but I can\u2019t tell you. There was one church each, of course.",
        "Q: Did you have any, I hesitate to say friends, but any non-Jewish acquaintances?",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember really playing with any particular kids. When you ask that question,\nthe image comes to mind of the first funeral I went to. One of the non-Jewish kids died of\nsomething and the whole class, I was still in the public school, went to the funeral. The first\ntime I\u2019ve ever been in the cemetery. And I vividly remember the open grave and the casket in it\nand every kid was supposed to go by and drop a flower on top of this casket. And I was so\nscared, I just couldn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s all I remember. Now whether this kid was a particular\nfriend of mine, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have any vivid memory of ever really playing, or really\nhaving a good time to tell you the truth. I, or perhaps I and my brother, but my brother was so\nmuch younger, were always too busy fleeing from being attacked. I remember the streets were\nfull of pretty large rocks. These were not paved roads, they were dirt roads with rock over\nthem. And I always had bloody knees because I always kept stumbling and falling as the kids\nwould pursue me or they would throw rocks. They were very handy little missiles, you know,\npick them off the floor and start throwing. So my memories were not particularly happy ones in\nthat town.",
        "Q: These were kids that were roughly your age?",
        "A: Yeah, of course.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have teenagers for example going after you?",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t bother with me. Not that I remember. I think that some of the older people in\ntown, in the time of higher excitement, particularly after, maybe Hitler made a speech, and we\nwould venture out in the street, in those days they still had horses and wagons, you know. I\nremember vividly one particular man who lived close by coming down that street on a wagon\nand taking his, what do you call this thing that you hit horses with?",
        "Q: The whip.",
        "A: Yeah. Take the whip and try to catch me walking in the street. You know, with the whip.",
        "Q: Crack the whip.",
        "A: Cracking ---",
        "Q: Cracking the whip in your direction?",
        "A: No, not in my direction. He hit me.",
        "Q: He got you?",
        "A: Yeah. But I think in general that, kind of, was the exception.",
        "Q: It must have been lonely not having many kids your age that you could play with?",
        "A: I guess so. I really don\u2019t have any strong memories of that.",
        "Q: How were you informed that you could no longer go to this public school?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I think just that one day, I think, my parents told me I was going to\nHeidelberg to continue school. And they would buy me a ticket, a monthly commuter ticket,\njust like the Long Island Railroad. And every morning, I would end up on that train with a\nschool bag on my back and a big thermos bottle in the school bag with the books, that was my\nlunch.",
        "Q: Did you know any Nazis?",
        "A: Well I think the village was full of them. And based on what this fellow wrote in his thesis,\nmore recently, apparently, he tried to interview some of them even as late as last year. They\nthreatened him with mayhem if he kept up the research.",
        "Q: There are Nazis still in hold?",
        "A: Of course we observed many of the, we saw many of the Nazi festivals, and so on, going on.\nBut, you know, the Nazis were, as usual, disciplined, and they would only take over the action\nwhen it was sanctioned like, Kristallnacht, and so on and so forth. Otherwise, because,\npresumably, my father --- not presumably, but my father was a soldier in World War I. He had\nsomewhat higher stature, if you like, in hierarchy of how they were treating the Jews and some\nothers. Of course in the final analysis it didn\u2019t do him any good.",
        "Q: And your father was in the German army in World War I?",
        "A: Yeah, he was in the German army for four years.",
        "Q: A decorated veteran?",
        "A: Yeah, he had a cross of this, a cross of that, which I remember he dramatically threw at the\nGestapo agent when they eventually deported us.",
        "Q: In 1940\u201d?",
        "A: In 1940.",
        "Q: \u201cThis may come as a surprise to you but you were a privileged child because your father was a\nwar veteran ---",
        "A: Is that really ---?",
        "Q: -- Apparently you were able to go to public school longer than the other kids.",
        "A: Was that so? I had no idea. I see. A little distinction. Yeah, they did make a little distinction.",
        "Q: Yes, two or three years.",
        "A: Yes and I remember when the --- after the Kristallnacht, he was arrested and he was sent to\nDachau like most of the males, if not all of them. He was privileged. He was let out four weeks\nafterwards and some other people had to wait a little bit longer.",
        "Q: So he was able to return home after this first trip?",
        "A: Yeah, well I think most of them returned home.",
        "Q: Yeah, what was his crime?",
        "A: His crime? I guess being a Jew.",
        "Q: Being a Jew, that was it, right?",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: He hadn\u2019t done a thing.",
        "A: Well all the males were arrested, after the Kristallnacht so the reason, I don\u2019t know what they\nare, logical, or if they needed any.",
        "Q: You remember Kristallnacht fairly well?",
        "A: Yeah, but before we talk about it, I\u2019d like to tell you one incident which was --- and I don\u2019t\nremember what year it was. We lived in this little town called Humfenheim, essentially an\nagricultural town. In those days some farmers still lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs.\nI mean that\u2019s how close they were. And, the regional town called Sinsheim is about four\nkilometers from there. And for some reason or another, my brother and I were walking to\nSinsheim I don\u2019t remember why, and one of the pleasures along that road was that the road was\nlined on both sides with apple trees. It must have been the time when the apples were just about\nripened, but they weren\u2019t ripe yet. And to this day I love green apples. We ate a lot of green\napples as we walked along that national road, a two-lane road. And we\u2019d take a bite out of the\napple and we would throw the rest of the apple at whatever car was speeding by. We would\nmiss most of them but this particular car, we hit right smack on the door and the whole apple\nsplattered. The car came to a grinding halt, backed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the\nSS sign of this particular car which was on the road. And the SS guy comes out of the car. \u201cWho\nthrew the apple?\u2019 And we both denied it, and of course he knew we were lying. He took our\nname and didn\u2019t say anything more. That night we came home and our father says, \u201cI had a\ncall... I was visited by the police. What did you guys do? You were throwing apples.\u201d \u201cWe\nweren\u2019t throwing apples.\u201d And he hit us across the face, I can still...",
        "Q: You lied to your father?",
        "A: I lied to my father.",
        "Q: He believed the SS over you?",
        "A: Well, I was so scared. I remember that very vividly. So when you say did I encounter any\nNazis, well that was a very close encounter.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a very close encounter. SS.",
        "A: I would guess it was 1938.",
        "Q: After you had stopped going to public school?",
        "A: Probably, yeah, probably.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t know it was an SS car?",
        "A: No, no, we would throw apples at any car.",
        "Q: You hit the jackpot.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did your father have any non-Jewish customers, I would think?",
        "A: I presume he did, as long as it was all right to buy from a Jewish shop.",
        "Q: Do you recall how his business fared after the Nazis came to power?",
        "A: Well, I think it quickly went to pot, but I don\u2019t really remember the details, really, I had very\nlittle to do with the store.",
        "Q: So you wouldn\u2019t know whether there was boycotts?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Shunning and so on?",
        "A: No, I really don\u2019t know. I think it probably followed the typical German history of this time.\nThese villages were surprisingly proactive. And based on what this fellow, recently has told\nme, it\u2019s still true.",
        "Q: In general, the Nazis were much more popular and stronger in the small towns.",
        "A: Oh is that so, I see, I didn\u2019t realize that.",
        "Q: The smaller the more likely...",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: Big cities tended to be Red.",
        "A: Yeah, well because everybody knew everybody and of course the Jews stuck out like a sore\nthumb I suppose.",
        "Q: Even though there weren\u2019t very many Jews.",
        "A: No, but at least you knew who they were, and of course... An interesting incident that this guy\ntold me. There\u2019s a bakery there in this village, today, and would you believe that every Friday\nthey bake and sell challah? And he told me that they do this because I guess the Christian\npopulation loved the challah, even though it was Jewish bread, right. And today, they have\nforgotten what the history, he told me, they forgotten the history of why is this bread baked the\nway it Is.",
        "Q: And when. And when.",
        "A: Yeah. This generation at least, has forgotten. It is amazing.",
        "Q: And yet they do it on Friday.",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah, for the weekend, in other words. That\u2019s amazing I thought... here is archeology in\naction while I\u2019m still alive.",
        "Q: Do any other incidents leap to your mind?",
        "A: From that time?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Well, one memory 1s the...all of these villages had communal gardens... and if you didn\u2019t, most\npeople didn\u2019t have a lot of land on their own, they lived in these villages, you could get a little\nplot from the community, raise your own vegetables and of course, you take that home. And I\nremember my mother working in this communal garden, you know. And we, as kids, would go\nto the local river which flows right by, which when I look at it now is about three feet wide, at\nthat time it looked terrifying, and take water out and put it in the garden. I\u2019m still afraid of\nwater because we used to swim in this water, or try to, and the other kids would like to drown\nus. And I\u2019m still terrified of the water. In fact, I\u2019m a very poor swimmer, I think as a result of\nthat.",
        "Q: You live on Long Island?\nA? Yeah. Incidents, and Iam a sailor too. I...One winter, we, I had some sort like a snow- suit on,\nvery warmly dressed, it was very cold there. And in the kitchen we had a cooking stove which\nwas fired, I think, by coal or wood, probably coal. And a big pot of soup was bubbling away.\nSomeone accidently turned that soup over and it landed on my leg. I got a tremendous burn\nover here. This was the time when Jews couldn\u2019t receive medical attention from non-Jewish\ndoctors and there was no Jewish doctor in this town. And I almost died because they...\nEventually the doctor that delivered me in 1929 who came from another little town, this\nSisnheim I was talking about, snuck into the house at night and provided some limited\namount of medical attention.. I remember that particular incident. Of course I\u2019m carrying that\nscar around",
        "Q: Was he a Jewish doctor?",
        "A: No, he was not. He was a Christian doctor. I don\u2019t remember his name but he was a nice guy. I\nremember a time, you probably know the year, when they insisted that all of the Jewish boys\nand girls get a Jewish identity card. When is that \u201938?",
        "Q: \"38.",
        "A: \u00b038. Again we had to go to this (unintelligible ) town and get the card, get the picture. In fact I\nhave the picture here in my file, and from then on I had a middle name called Israel.",
        "Q: And if you has a sister?",
        "A: She would have been Sarah.",
        "Q: Do you remember your parents talking about politics or talking about the Nazis in the\nhousehold?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any real recollection. They must have been so preoccupied and so overwhelmed\nwith the day-to-day problems of making a living and making ends meet that if they did talk\nabout it maybe they talked about it when I wasn\u2019t present but I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Do you remember whether your mother was allowed to tend her garden until the deportation?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember how far that went, or how long this lasted. I have no idea.",
        "Q: And Kristallnacht you remember?",
        "A: Yeah, vividly.",
        "Q: Vividly?",
        "A: Vividly.",
        "Q: Can you describe what you saw?",
        "A: Yeah, what I saw. I went to the train that morning, and went to school in Heidelberg. This\ndidn\u2019t happen in the night of the 9th to 10th in this village.",
        "Q: They were behind a day?",
        "A: Yeah, I guess they didn\u2019t get the message or something. Even though, you know, this was a\nparticular (unintelligible) what was his name? Wagner, I think, who apparently was more rabid\nthan most. And apparently he was a major factor behind this. And the first thing I knew 1s\nwhen I got to Heidelberg and got to school, in the school, they told a lot of kids to go back\nhome because something was happening. Or maybe they told us what was happening. I don\u2019t\nremember the specific event. I went back to the railroad station.",
        "Q: This was at the Jewish school?",
        "A: Yes. The Jewish school. I went back to the railroad station and caught the first train I possibly\ncould. This was not exactly on the half-hour. And as I was walking out from the railroad\nstation and looking up the so called main street, right by the little post office I suddenly saw my\nparents pushing a very large pushcart with whatever, in retrospect, they could save from this\napartment which was right adjoining the synagogue I was telling you about. And pushing it,\nyou know, to my uncle\u2019s house where they had made room for us to live with them. They did\nnot, as I remember, they didn\u2019t burn that synagogue. They literally took axes and hammers and\nkind of destroyed it bit by bit without setting it on fire. When I was in Germany about a year\nand a half ago, for the second time, the local minister walked me around the village. This is a\nwhole separate subject. And he took me to the place where the synagogue was, which I had a\nlittle trouble remembering and, well, there it was. They had managed to put a little plaque up\nwhich said \u201cformer synagogue\u201d. They had, of course appropriated eventually the real estate,\nand a pharmacy had been built on that lot. So there\u2019s no evidence. That\u2019s really all I remember\nexcept my father being arrested, sent to Dachau and came back, I believe about four weeks\nlater. It was snowing. This was November so this would make sense. December, January or\nsomething like that. He was limping very badly, had a red bandage, a red kerchief-like tied\naround foot, you know, ambling into the house. I remember that particular scene. That\u2019s about\nall I can remember.",
        "Q: Kristallnacht, you never returned to the apartment? Your parents had basically left?",
        "A: That\u2019s right. It was all destroyed.",
        "Q: The apartment was gutted?",
        "A: Yeah, all the furniture was destroyed and whatever belongings we might have had were\ndestroyed except what they could manage to get on that cart.",
        "Q: The pushcart was there at that time?",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: And your younger brother was with your parents?",
        "A: I believe so, yeah. He was too young to go to school at that time.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else on that day?",
        "A: Not really, not really.",
        "Q: Just walking into your uncle\u2019s apartment. (?) wasn\u2019t there either.",
        "A: Well, no, he was also at Dachau, so here you had all the women and children living in this one\nplace. That\u2019s the place where I got burned so it must have been \u00b038, \u201939 it must have been.\nThat\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Do you remember anything your father said when he came back from Dachau?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t. I think it was ... I think I remember tears but I don\u2019t remember words.",
        "Q: How was life the next few years?",
        "A: It\u2019s a blank. I don\u2019t remember what life was like the nest two years, except that my father\u2019s\nbrother, with his wife and daughter, the (?) that was mentioned earlier. We lived in South\nBirken which is more or less on the border with France. I guess they were forced to evacuate\nbecause Jews couldn\u2019t live too close to the border, I suppose, and they also moved in with us,\nwith that uncle. So now a family of two suddenly became five and now suddenly became eight.\nAnd of course, the house got a little tight with eight.",
        "Q: Were these uncles all brothers of your father?",
        "A: No. Yeah. The uncle we moved in with was the uncle of my father, not my uncle.",
        "Q: Oh. It was your father\u2019s uncle?",
        "A: Yeah. I think the two brothers were brothers of his.",
        "Q: Grand (?) And then the one from Starboken?",
        "A: Yes, he was the true uncle to me. He was my father\u2019s brother.",
        "Q: It was crowded?",
        "A: Yeah, it was crowded.",
        "Q: Did you continue going to school in Heidelberg?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t believe so. I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t know whether that school or whether...",
        "A: No I don\u2019t know what happened to that school. I remember the teachers names(?).",
        "Q: Reunion two years later? Do you remember any changes when the war broke out? In \u201939 or\n\"40?",
        "A: Not really except that you know that the war was so favorable to the Germans so quickly they\nwere all elated and I think the happier they were the more anti-Jewish they became. I mean it\njust were a way of beating up on somebody. I remember vividly, I must have gone to school\nbecause I was in Heidelberg, and they had a big exhibition under a tent in the middle of the\ntown square of some of the war booty that they had captured in Poland and France. I think it\nwas French equipment, maybe also British equipment from Dunkirk.. And of course,\ntheoretically, only Germans were allowed there. At that time we couldn\u2019t go to the movie...\nI\u2019ve never seen a movie in Germany, no we couldn\u2019t go to the movies...",
        "Q: Not allowed...",
        "A: And, I always passed myself off as a German, you know, or a non-Jew. And, I would Heil\nHitler up and down that tent, you know, and look at all that equipment, you know. AII the kids,\nall the boys are interested in guns and stuff like that.",
        "Q: And they didn\u2019t know you...?",
        "A: Of course they didn\u2019t. I had no trouble passing.",
        "Q: Were you proud as a German regarding these victories?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I thought of myself as anything other than. But I really didn\u2019t\nhave any of these philosophical opinions at the time.",
        "Q: But you know, sometimes kids, especially boys, are impressed by military trophies, military\nweaponry...",
        "A: Well, I remember Heil Hitlering, you know, just to get by, because 1t seemed like the thing to do\n(?) I had blond hair in those days, I still have blue eyes.",
        "Q: You still have blue eyes.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have a problem.",
        "Q: You were an Aryan. That brings us now to October 1940.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: How did you find out about this new voyage, this new trip of yours to France?",
        "A: Well, as I can remember it, the police came to the door and they told us we had two hours to\npack some minimum amount they allowed us to carry, I forgot how many kilograms it may have\nbeen. And we went. One of them stayed with us.",
        "Q: One of the Germans?",
        "A: One of the Germans.",
        "Q: Police or storm troopers?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I thought he had a black uniform on but I\u2019m not sure. I know he had a gun.\nGuns were still somewhat unique. And he kind of rested his hand on the gun, I think it was just\na way of kind of resting his hand, I don\u2019t think he meant anything. And frankly, I don\u2019t know\nwhat the reaction of my parents was. Except that there was a lot of scurrying around and\ngrabbing suitcases and so on and so forth and stuffing in rather irrelevant things I\u2019m sure. In\nfact, I know it was irrelevant because later on I found some of those things.",
        "Q: Did you help pack?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Did you help pack?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no, I don\u2019t think so. And that\u2019s one incident I remember when my father had\nsome words with the policeman. He might have known him. I don\u2019t know whether he was a\nlocal guy or not. And, kind of threw him or handed him his Iron Cross from World War I. The\nnext thing I remember is we walked through the streets, I believe, down to City Hall, where the\nbus, some sort of bus or perhaps truck was waiting and they put us all in this truck, with\nwhatever bags we had. The local Germans were, of course, were looking around their curtains,\nof course, and their doorways and what not. I don\u2019t remember anybody saying anything. And\nthey trucked us to Heidelberg. To the railroad station. Where we boarded a waiting train. This\nwas not a cattle car train, this was a passenger coacher, and there we sat, probably waiting for a\nnumber of other people coming in, and eventually the train started to move. I remember an\nincident where the accompanying Germans, I presumed they were Gestapo but I really don\u2019t\nknow, asked for all valuables. And I presume, as good Germans, we probably handed them\nover, I really don\u2019t know. That\u2019s about all I can remember from the trip except eventually we\nstopped at the German border, and I\u2019m almost 100% sure it stopped in Mullhurst.",
        "Q: Mullhurst? Did it?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah because I remember, I think I saw that name on the station. And it stopped and went\nand it took a rather long time and eventually it ended up in some siding. We had no idea where\nwe were because nobody told us where we were going. And they took us off the train and \u2019'm\nquite sure it was raining and we ended up on dump trucks, I know these were dump trucks.\nThere was a lot of mud, and they trucked us, I guess, from (?) railroad station (?) into what\nturned out to be Gurst (?). I had no idea where they were taking us. I mean I had no idea what\nwas going on. We just...it\u2019s almost like being asleep walk at this point. I don\u2019t know what the\nadults were thinking.",
        "Q: Even though you were going to France?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Before you...",
        "A: No. I had no idea.",
        "Q: Nobody...",
        "A: I had no idea and I\u2019m not sure they told this to anybody till eventually they ended up in France\nand of course they probably could see and read the signs at that time. We knew nothing about\nthis Madagascar business and so on that eventually developed.",
        "Q: You all sat together on the train?",
        "A: Family?",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "Q: As far as you could tell of the Jews, all of Jews that you knew from your town were on this\ntrain?",
        "A: Well, I presume so. Yeah. I knew all the Jews were deported at the same time...",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: ...and I presume we were more or less in the same carriage. I imagine they loaded those as\npeople came along, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What did you take? What did your parents take?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. But, I know that after my parents were re-deported from Gurst to\nAuschwitz eventually, my mother left behind one of those suitcases which somehow reached\nme where I was and it had a lot of bed linen in it.",
        "Q: No beds?",
        "A: No beds. No. But bed- linens. At long last.",
        "Q: How were you treated at Gurst?",
        "A: Well as you know Gurst was divided and men and women were separated. Both of us ended\nwith the mother. We were in (?) if I remember right. You know being curious boys, this was all\nnew. There was naturally a fence around it. There were barracks, completely bare. I don\u2019t\nbelieve we had mattresses. I don\u2019t remember that when we moved in there. And all the people\nwere just kind of laying like stacked wood, one next to the other. I saw my first death there one\nmorning. Someone who was laying near me, perhaps not next to me, passed away during the\nnight and my mother rushed me out of the room, the barracks, as quickly as she could. This\nwas October/November, and as you know was rather miserable weather. Very muddy, very\nrainy, rather cold. I don\u2019t remember the barracks being heated, but they might have been. It\nwas a rather, you know, difficult situation. The toilets were communal and washing area was\ncommunal where everyone washed in a long trough with, I believe it was a pipe that had a\nbunch of holes punched in it and someone turned the faucet on and the water came out.",
        "Q: Cold water only?",
        "A: Yeah. I believe so, yeah. I don\u2019t believe there were showers. I can\u2019t remember any showers.\nBut then as a boy I wasn\u2019t too anxious to shower anyway. I remember the toilets. They were\nsurprisingly mechanical. You climbed up a bunch of stairs and there was a platform. And they\nhad the fifty gallon barrels under the big hole and you did your thing and then it plopped into\nthe barrel. And the...the small narrow range railroad, railway, rail line, circled the camp and\nthey would move these barrels on top of some sort of flatbed car like affair, and they would\npush it to wherever they would dump it. That\u2019s how they moved it. I don\u2019t remember why I\nwould know that detail. As kids, we would... the camp of course was not guarded by Germans.\nThis was Vichy France, guarded by French soldiers who were relatively loose. I don\u2019t know\nhow, but, we as kids, managed to crawl under the fence and go to visit our father in the separate\npart of this camp. My father lucked out because he was a butcher, they thought he would make\na cook. And he ended up working in the kitchen. And he would sneak us an extra piece of\nbread or whatever he could lay his hands on. I have some vague memory of going... Some of\nthe older boys would sneak into the local town, which was about...",
        "Q: So you could get out of the outer fence too?",
        "A: Yeah. And I remember buying some pate, in a tin can. I don\u2019t know where we got the money,\nand going back to camp at night. I remember one guard, oh yeah ... we had a very good\nlooking redhead in this barracks and...",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, you were in the women\u2019s ...",
        "A: Yeah, I instantly fell in love with her. I don\u2019t know how old she was, she must have eighteen,\ntwenty. With long reddish hair. P\u2019ve had a red hair fetish ever since. And, I remember\nwatching her making love with that French soldier, that French guard. She wore a cross and\nobviously she was half, so-called, half Jewish.",
        "Q: She never reciprocated interest in you, though?",
        "A: No. I was too young. I saw my father\u2019s? brother there a few times. I saw the other uncle, my\nmother\u2019s brother. I don\u2019t remember seeing my grandmother, who died there.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t attend her funeral?",
        "A: But she died after I left. The mud is the most memorable thing I think. It\u2019s an incredible mark,\nit\u2019s very deep. We, somehow, we, many of us ended up with galoshes, which is, you know, sort\nof a rubber shoe. If you stepped in that mud and then tried to pull it out, the suction of that mud\nwas such that you could lose your shoe. And I remember many older people, falling in that mud\nand having a hell of a time getting back out of it. And if you went to help them, they would pull\nyou in the mud. And so for many months (?) struggled with that mud. I don\u2019t know why that\nsticks in my head, but it seems to have been a major problem...",
        "Q: That seems to be a major memory of all the people who were at Gurst.",
        "A: I remember getting some terribly strong vaccinations and believe it or not I have a certificate\nfrom (?) signed by the doctor at (?) against typhoid, diphtheria, etc. etc. Apparently these things\ndeveloped in those great environments very quickly and they inoculated, I guess, all the kids.\nAnd I presume many of the deaths which occurred there, probably occurred due to some of\nthese epidemics that developed that you might know more about us than I do.",
        "Q: When you weren\u2019t eating pate, what were you eating in this camp, what did they feed you?",
        "A: The standard fare seemed to be just some sort of a soup with some vegetables floating in it,\nthat\u2019s all I can remember.",
        "Q: Not especially tasty?",
        "A: Not particularly. The French eat a lot of beets, at least we ended up with a lot of beets, and (?)\nwe called them.",
        "Q: How about quantity?",
        "A: Oh I think we were always hungry.",
        "Q: You were always hungry?",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember any particular packages coming in from the Salvation Army or the Red\nCross and so on. I know these people in later years, I found out they were quite active, but I\nwasn\u2019t particularly aware of that activity. It doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t exist. As I said we\nmanaged to get some extra pieces of bread from my father. He would hold it at the end of a\nlong fork against this open fire where they had these big, tremendous, fifty- gallon drums\nbubbling away with the coup of the day and he would toast it. And they had these, maybe five\ngallon drums of fat standing there, and he would spread that on the toasted bread and that would\ntaste like heaven.",
        "Q: Not a kosher kitchen?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think there was any attempt at that.",
        "Q: Was there any cooking outside of this central kitchen where your father worked?",
        "A: Not that \u2019'm aware of, not that I\u2019m aware of.",
        "Q: Now, earlier, you mentioned that you saw your teacher from Heidelberg.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Was there any attempt to resume schooling, have classes?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe so, not while I was there, no. I have no recollection of that.",
        "Q: Now the time you were there. What did you do during the day when you weren\u2019t sneaking out\nunder the fence?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how we spent the time.",
        "Q: Not much to do?",
        "A: I guess, you know, kids at that age, as long as they are in reasonably good health, I guess we ran\naround, we probably became very rowdy and non-controllable, I suppose. I really don\u2019t know\nwhat we did.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sure you tried to stay warm, this was winter. You had gotten there just in the nick of time as\nfar as winter is concerned.",
        "A: I imagine I blocked out quite a bit of these negative part, I only seem to remember the better\nparts, I guess.",
        "Q: Did anyone have any idea what was to become of you? Where you would go or how long you\nwould stay or why you were there?",
        "A: I have no idea. I don\u2019t what the adults knew. I had no idea what they talked about. I don\u2019t\nknow if they, men and women, ever got together even for talking purposes. All I know 1s that\none day my mother and father both said that they had volunteered us to be taken out of the\ncamp by some organization and I don\u2019t remember my reaction. I don\u2019t know whether I was\ndelighted or reluctant. But we found ourselves, I guess, again on the truck with forty-seven\nsome other children, fifty children were taken out and we eventually ended up in a French\norphanage, near that camp.",
        "Q: Do you remember when this was?",
        "A: Yes. This was in 1941, February \u00b041.",
        "Q: February \u00b041.",
        "A: So I was in that camp about three to four months.",
        "Q: You were taken to an orphanage nearby?",
        "A: Yes, so my brother and I, with the other kids, were taken to the orphanage and it turned out later\non that a branch of the American Quakers, the American Friends Service Committee, acting\nthrough the Swedish chapter, had made arrangements with the French government to take these\nfifty children out. The French in World War 1, you know, had lost many men, so there were\nmillions, I guess literally millions, of households without males. So they built a whole number\nof orphanages ... (side one of tape ended, pick up with side two)",
        "Q: We were talking about the orphanage ...",
        "A: Yeah. And this was now roughly twenty years later. The orphans of course had grown up, the\norphanages were relatively empty and, I guess, somebody was smart enough to realize that here\nwas a possible place where, at least you could put some people. As I understand it, the Quakers\ncommitted themselves to feed the whole orphanage if they took these fifty Jewish children ...\nSo we ended up in this orphanage in a little place called Aspet, A-S-P-E-T, in the Haute Garron\n(?) department. Near...",
        "Q: Towards the Atlantic?",
        "A: No, no, no. This was right at the foot of the Pyrenees. It was not too far from (?). It was near a\nlarger town called Saint Grodance (???).",
        "Q: But it\u2019s toward the western part, that would be rather than towards the Mediterranean.",
        "A: I guess so. But it is quite close by. We ended up in this orphanage. I believe it was a two or\nthree story affair, there was a sort of a classical institutional looking affair. These German kids,\nof course now we were Germans, we weren\u2019t Jewish, in this French institution. The French had\njust lost the war so they didn\u2019t have a lot of love for the Germans, right. So we were the (?) no\nmatter how you looked at it. The director of the camp was an interesting man ...",
        "Q: The director of the orphanage?",
        "A: Of the orphanage, and he had some women who helped him. They organized us like little\nsoldiers and that\u2019s how ... there were roughly half and half boys and half girls in this little\ngroup of Jewish children.",
        "Q: Kept separate?",
        "A: We were kept separate. As I remember we did not go to German schools, French schools rather.",
        "Q: The nationality of the director ...",
        "A: He was French.",
        "Q: He was French.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And these Quakers ...",
        "A: The Quakers just came and went. I mean they came perhaps once every few months and see\nhow we were doing and then left. I guess they provided food in part for the whole institution.\nThere were of course other French children there. It was a fairly self-contained community\nrelatively speaking. They had their own fields where they raised vegetables. I remember they\nhad a man on the horse who did the plowing. They had an infirmary there. And I guess they\ntried to bring us up as sort of little bit like French kids would be. They walked us around the\nhall somewhat on a military side, but I guess that\u2019s the only way you could control fifty kids.",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t give you wine though?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t 100 % French.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t think we had wine.",
        "Q: The nationality of these Quakers, was it Swedish or American?",
        "A: Swedish.",
        "Q: Swedish. And aside from the schools was there anything else that you had to do? You didn\u2019t\nwork in the gardens or anything like that?",
        "A: I think we did some chores and at sometime they brought in a Jewish couple who lived in the\nvillage and I think he would come in and give us some modicum of instruction. I doubt it was\nparticularly effective but they made an attempt when he was till busy hiding of course. This\nwas Vichy France at the time. The only memories I have is this farmer who took care of the\nfields where they grew the vegetables, one day they decided, somebody decided, they were\ngoing to kill the cows so they could feed the kids. And it\u2019s an indescribable scene on how this\ncow was killed. I don\u2019t know if you want to hear about it. For the hell of it I'll tell you. There\nwas a manhole cover right in front of the so-called cafeteria, or the Refectoire, as the French\ncalled it, and they tied the cow down on this manhole which was of course steel and relatively\nheavy, by the horns, so the cow was now sort of ...",
        "Q: Nose to the ground.",
        "A: ...Nose to the ground. And this guy, was a big guy, would take a pickaxe and would literally hit\nthis cow between the horns. It seems like hundreds of times till eventually, I don\u2019t know how\nlong it was, but it was too long, eventually the cow got on his knees and just died. The French\neat blood sausages, are you familiar with that?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Or blood, it\u2019s not even sausage. They take the live blood and bake it, I forgot what it\u2019s called.",
        "Q: They put it in soup basically.",
        "A: Not soup, no. It becomes almost like a jello. It becomes, yeah. And that\u2019s the first thing I\nremember them feeding us. And well, that\u2019s one thing I can remember.",
        "Q: You scooped all of this up of course.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: I mean did you really feel like eating this?",
        "A: No. [have had an aversion to blood ever since. But to the French this was fairly routine. If\nthey killed a sheep, which was fairly routine, the blood would be collected and that was one of\nthings ...",
        "Q: And meat was a luxury.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well that was rare. Every afternoon it seemed like they would insist we would walk\nin fairly ordered fashion through the village and through the surrounding countryside, which in\nretrospect was quite beautiful. And they would teach us French songs and we would march to\nthese songs and that\u2019s how we got our fresh air. I remember when we first got there, I guess we\nhad a lot of lice and all the boys got their hair cut down to the scalp, including myself. I have a\npict..they took a set of I.D. pictures of every kid. I still have one of them from that time. There\nwas a lot of bed wetting, I remember and I think I was one of them. And they shamed us ...",
        "Q: Unintentional.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well I think all of the kids were obviously disturbed. And that went on a long time. I\nremember, I don\u2019t know why, I remember the toilets, the typical French, just a hole in the\nground, with an appliance over the hole and you put your feet on either side and you crouch\ndown and do your thing. Paper was very rare and many of boys would wipe their behind by just\ncleaning their finger on the wall. And one of the jobs that we had was to clean the walls. Well\nwe tried to instill in the kids to stop doing that but one kid would continue to do it and we\ncouldn\u2019t find out who it was. So we decided to stake out the toilets. The toilets had fairly high\nwalls but they were open on top and on the bottom. So we put two kids on top of the wall\nwatching, and this one kid would come into the toilet and he did his thing and wipe his finger\non the wall and of course we beat the hell out of him.",
        "Q: And made him clean it ...",
        "A: And you know what his nickname was for the rest of the time we were there?\nQ @)",
        "A: No. The name for (?) is (?) in French. His nickname was (?). You know when you wipe your\nthing? His name was (\u2019?).",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t make him clean it?",
        "A: Well what\u2019s amusing is that in 1972, I believe it was, my wife and I went back and retraced all\nthese steps I was just talking about. And we went to this little village of Aspet and the\norphanage is still there and it\u2019s now a home, they told us, for disturbed children. Of broken\nmarriages, you know divorces are also rampant in France. And I wanted to go see the toilets.\nAnd would you believe they are still there and they\u2019re still the way they were and the doors are\nstill as high as they were, it\u2019s amazing nothing has changed.",
        "Q: And the walls need cleaning.",
        "A: No, that I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Was your wife, you mentioned you went back with your wife, was your wife there as well?",
        "A: No, she was born in Vienna, Austria and she came here in 1938, a day or two after Kristallnacht.\nAnd she lived in the States and I met her here in the 50\u2019s. What else do I remember of Aspet?\nNot very much except we were there until 1942 and we had, the kids who had come out of\nGurst had not seen their parents for almost two years. We were busy trying to, we were saving\nbread from our ration in shoeboxes because we were all excited that we were going to have a\ntemporary visit with our parents, who at that time had been transferred to (?). I don\u2019t know if\nall of them had but mine had. We of course would get correspondence from the parents, regular\nletters, my brother has most of these letters. And one day a car came, we were going to go there\nin August as a matter of fact.",
        "Q: So you were going to go to the (?)",
        "A: ...of \u201942, right. A car came, a Gestapo car came. We never saw a German in that place. The\nGestapo showed up. They went to see the director. The director called two kids in and said\nyour parents are going to be transferred and they asked that you go with them. Pack your things\nand go with these people. And they left. And I still remember the name of these kids. He was\none of my friends. And I had imagined that the worst had happened to him. I told you\ndownstairs that my brother is writing a history of all of these kids. Well he met this guy, he told\nme last year. He ended up after the war in East Germany and had a whole history of his own on\nwhat\u2019s happened in East Germany to him. So he never ended up in Auschwitz. That\u2019s what I\nhad imagined. I don\u2019t know how he eventually escaped. At any rate, to make a long story\nshort, they prevented us from going to (?) because, unbeknownst to us, that\u2019s when the\ndeportation started.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: ...re-deportation started.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. The first deportation was to Auschwitz.",
        "A: And we stayed there for, up to the time, I believe, when the Germans occupied all of France.\nWas that in \u201943?",
        "Q: November of \u201942.",
        "A: \"42. So it was only a month or two later, right, August, September...",
        "Q: Yeah, a couple of months.",
        "A: And I guess at that time they passed some sort of law that Jews couldn\u2019t live within 20 miles of\nthe Spanish border or something like that, and we were closer than that to the Spanish border\nand some magic hand, I don\u2019t know who, the Quaker, the Ouzay (?), or whatever it was, took us\nout of this camp and sent up temporarily to Toulouse, where we were in some sort of a school.\nAnd within a month or two I ended up in another town called Montsac (?) which is in a town (?)\ndepartment. And there was a children\u2019s home there which was run by a Jewish organization.",
        "Q: Ousay?",
        "A: It could have been Ousay (?) and it was on the principle of the boy scouts) That is the life of\nthis organization was, it sort of as you lived there a boy scout 24 hours a day.",
        "Q: Jewish boy scouts?",
        "A: Jewish boy scouts. French Jewish boy scouts. Which 1s fairly prominent organization. In\nToulouse as I remember it, somehow my brother got separated from me. I don\u2019t know if it was\non purpose or otherwise and he ended up in Switzerland and spent the rest of the time, his time,\nin Switzerland.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know that until after the war?",
        "A: I knew we were separated.",
        "Q: Yeah. No, but you didn\u2019t know that he had made it to Switzerland?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether I knew that or not. I went to see him after the war in Switzerland so\nsomehow I knew or found out where he was.",
        "Q: So the group of 48 transferred out of the orphanage ...",
        "A: Yeah, but then we were ...",
        "Q: And then you were broken up.",
        "A: ...broken up. Yeah. Different people ended up in different places. So that takes us to 1943 or\nso. Life in Montsac was quite different. This now was an openly Jewish life. I wouldn\u2019t say\nreligious but observing. We all joined boy scout troops, we made our bed, we did kitchen duty.\nThey had some sort of a schooling organized and had organized a number of trade schools there\nwhere you could learn to become a carpenter, a cabinetmaker, an iron worker, and so on and so\nforth. Not terribly practical trades today but in those days that was the thing to do. Not unlike\nthe kind of preparation, I think, for people who might want to emigrate to then Palestine. You\nknow, they\u2019d teach you a trade. That lasted for about a year.",
        "Q: These are all boys?",
        "A: No. Boys and girls. It was strictly co-ed. The girls were on one floor, the boys on the other.\nAnd we were getting through the puberty stage and in fact there were some that were eighteen,\nperhaps twenty. And you know, any number of girls got pregnant. It was not unusual. But it\nwas fairly, you know, it was a decent life.",
        "Q: Were here boys and girls from other parts of France?",
        "A: Yes. They were French Jews and there were people from Belgium. These were families that\nmight have moved to ... children who ended up from other countries in France before the war,\ndidn\u2019t have, necessarily French passports, you know, so all kinds of mixture. There were not\nthat many German Jewish children there.",
        "Q: They would probably come from (?)",
        "A: Yes. Btu they mostly, only, talked French there. By that time you either ...",
        "Q: You knew French by then.",
        "A: Well, yes, more or less. I\u2019m sure with a very heavy accent.",
        "Q: And ironically all of this was under direct German occupation.",
        "A: Yeah. By that time it was. This home started before the occupation of France.",
        "Q: You got there and it was early in \u00b043?",
        "A: Yeah. Yes. I\u2019m quite sure that I ended up in early \u00b043.",
        "Q: Winter. It seems like you\u2019re making all your moves in winter.",
        "A: We were there for perhaps a year, maybe more than a year when it was obvious that the\nGermans now had cleaned all the concentration camps of the Jews they already had captive and\nthey were starting to arrest other Jews including the French Jews. And whoever this magic\nhands was, decided we better move all these kids so called underground, so to speak\nunderground. And we all received French identity cards, phony identity cards. My name\nbecame Marcel Mantue (?) And I ended up hidden in a county seat called (?) where French\nchildren would go to school during the school year from the farms, they would stay in the\nschool like here in the, you would have dorms in a college and you would stay ...",
        "Q: Boarding school ...",
        "A: Yeah. Like boarding school. But public ... Ad then during the vacation of course they would\ngo home. And I bluffed myself through that school, hiding my identity.",
        "Q: So you had to hide your identity from the other students?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: No one had to know.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s right. I don\u2019t remember how successful I was. And during the summer, the same\ninvisible hand had managed to make arrangements with a number of farms in the area to take a\nnumber of children who had no other place to go. Whether these people knew we were Jewish\nor not, I have no idea and I spent either one or two summers during the summer vacation that\nway on the farm. Guarding sheep. Very useful, typical French farmhouse. Probably ate very\nwell.",
        "Q: Is this still the same part of France, in the south?",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s south.",
        "Q: Southwest?",
        "A: All southern France. While we were in Montsac, of course, in the boy scouts we would camp\nduring the summer. We would, in fact we camped somewhere near (?) in that French, 1n that\npartisan village we were talking about earlier. We would celebrate the Jewish holidays. We had\na chorale , a singing chorale, which was presumably quite good, led by a young guy who\nbecame quite famous and lived in Geneva, Switzerland, perhaps (?) and a chorale director. It\nwas in retrospect, an interesting life.",
        "Q: Yeah. I see smiles on your face. It wasn\u2019t all bad.",
        "A: Yeah. There were some tense moments while we were underground, you know, as I guess we\nmoved into 1944.",
        "Q: Is this when you were on a shepherd, or a farmer, or already before that?",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember exactly. There was one summer when we ended up in some other\narrangement and the Germans, I guess, had found out that there might be either some Jews\nhiding or some (?) fighters hiding and they raided this place and we had to disappear into the\nwoods rather hurriedly. We heard machine guns of course and a number of people were\narrested but somehow I managed to get away.",
        "Q: Did you know anyone who was arrested?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: Jews, Jewish refugees or rescuers?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I guess there was more concerned for fellows who were eighteen, twenty,\ntwenty-five years old. I was still fourteen, fifteen at the time. On the assumption you could\nhide your identity. You know, if you didn\u2019t register for labor in Germany and so on you were\nsubject to arrest even if you were French. Well that\u2019s how we somehow got through the war.\nWe somehow heard about D-Day. And eventually we all ended up back in Montsac in this\nhome. The home now took over a building, a relatively new building that the Vichy\ngovernment had built for physical education because they were going to develop their own\nmaster race. So we ended up in this rather posh building which today, incidentally is a hotel\nwhich I slept in when I was back there in 1972. It was a time-warp experience of it\u2019s own. And",
        "Q: Do you know when you were liberated? Or where you were?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly where I was.",
        "Q: Summer of \u201944?",
        "A: Yeah. Must have been in the summer of *44.",
        "Q: Did you ever see combat troops, either German or American?",
        "A: The only real memory I have is seeing a big pipeline with a lot of gasoline leaking out of it and\nI\u2019ve never seen red gasoline before, it was all red, on some of the major roads we were hiking\non. I think, of course, that happened while we were in the boy-scout camp since they landed in\nJune. This all happened during the summer so I presume we were not in school at that time.",
        "Q: The landing in Normandy was in June. The landing in the Mediterranean was in August. You\nwere kind of in the middle.",
        "A: Yeah. So I\u2019m sure I saw the pipeline that came out from probably Marseilles or (?). There\nwasn\u2019t any significant fighting as I remember it in that area. I think most of the fighting was up\nnorth of course and it didn\u2019t take too long for the Germans to all hustle themselves north and\neast trying to...",
        "Q: Avoid the trap...",
        "A: ...to defend the Normandy part of the invasion. But I don\u2019t think there was any fighting.",
        "Q: In your area they were in risk, they were in danger of being cut off from the Mediterranean\noperation up the Rhone valley linking up with the operation north which would have cut off all\nthe forces to the southwest.",
        "A: I see. I see. So what we saw more of was the (?) taking revenge on the local French,\nparticularly, I remember rather vividly the women who had so-called fraternized with the\nFrench, getting their hair shorn, that was more prominent.",
        "Q: Those were the quite fortunate ones.",
        "A: So we ended back in Montsac and tried to return to normal. The school started again etc. etc.\nSomehow I believe this was a Quaker (?) somehow got in touch with me. They wanted to know\nif I knew anyone in the United States and whether I wanted to go there. So I said, \u201cWell, yes I\nremember my parents telling me about an uncle in the United States.\u201d In retrospect, it wasn\u2019t an\nuncle, it was a second cousin of my grandmother\u2019s. It was a man who had come over in\nsomething like 1908. In fact, he was a brother of the man we moved in with after Kristallnacht.\n(?) and they placed an ad in the paper, in the New York area, and he had over his many years,\nsponsored maybe something like 20 or 30 couples to come here (?) And he told me in retrospect\nhe got a lot of calls.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have to be a cousin, or...",
        "A: On this ad. Well, at this time they were curious on who survived. None of his families. And\nhe asked me whether I come over. And I said yes. I remember receiving a very large package\nwith, I believe a salami that looked like it was three feet long but maybe it was only one foot.\nAnd I remember standing at the children\u2019s home, in my room which I shared with a number of\nother boys, and slicing salami for two or three hours because everybody\u2019s coming by getting a\npiece of salami. After about a year, well, in fact it was December \u201946, I eventually came over.",
        "Q: To the United States.",
        "A: And I came over early, believe it or not, because I was not on a Jewish quota. I was now on a\nGerman quota. And the German quota was undersubscribed because during the war, obviously\ndid not come to the United States.",
        "Q: It was unused?",
        "A: Yeah, and since I had so called ... in the eyes of the Americans I was a German, so I could get\nin under the German quota. Irony, isn\u2019t it. So I ended up in Manhattan. I came over on the\nNormandy (?)\nQ @)",
        "A: No, I stayed here five years and I had a dying to go to California and I did. I ended up in\nCalifornia for 15-16 years and came back here in 1970. And here we are in 1992.",
        "Q: Your brother who escaped to Switzerland, he went to Israel.\nA Yes, I went to visit him after I had agreed to come here to talk him into coming with me. He\nhad come under the influence of very religious Zionist organizations, I don\u2019t remember who it\nwas. He was only about 11 or 12 and he was going to go to Palestine. He insisted. And I said,\nokay, if that\u2019s what you want to do. So he ended up in Palestine before the state became Israel.",
        "Q: You were never tempted to go to Palestine?",
        "A: I might have been but, I guess, not enough to do it.",
        "Q: Were your parents especially happy with (?). Did they ever talk about or think about leaving\nthere?",
        "A: Yes, they wanted to come here. And as a matter of fact they had a quota. Believe it or not I\nremember the number. Not exactly, but 1t was something like 16,000 something, and they were\nwaiting for an affidavit from this same uncle. And perhaps had the affidavit, I don\u2019t know. But\nobviously you couldn\u2019t go until your number was up.",

        "A: Yes. I have one brother named Menachem. He currently lives in Israel.",
        "A: He was younger by three years, yes.",
        "A: Yes. Well, my mother was a typical housewife of its day. My father was in business as a\nbutcher. And they tried to make a living to support us as long as they managed to do it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well we lived in an apartment and then as a sort of -- because the Jewish community was very\nsmall there, on the time we were deported there was as few as ten families, my father acted as a\ncantor. When the regular cantor left or died, I\u2019m not sure, we ended up in an apartment which\nwas adjoining to the synagogue. So we lived there until the Kristallnacht when, of course, the\nsynagogue was destroyed and we had to move out of the apartment very quickly. We moved in\nwith an uncle who lived in that same town.",
        "A: Well, as I can remember, it was over a ten -year period.-",
        "A: Yeah, correct.",
        "A: Yes, they were.",

        "A: Not in any great detail. I -- the only vague memory I have is when I was perhaps three years\nold, and I believe it was about the time my brother was born. I remember very vividly a mouse\nplaying under his crib, that I kept watching.",

        "A: No. I don\u2019t know where the mouse came from.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, no.",
        "A: No, not really. By the time I, you know, 1933 was not very far away, I was four years old, and\nthe little kids in the street very quickly stopped playing with us and would rather beat us up, so\nthere was very little time for hobbies. It was more a question of protection.",
        "A: Oh yeah, quite frequently and I learned to run as fast as my little legs could carry me.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. I started school when I was six, which I guess means 1935, and went to school for about\ntwo years, till --- or perhaps it was three, I\u2019m not sure. No, it was two years. Till they\nprohibited Jewish kids from going to the public schools. And I was then enrolled in a Jewish\noperated school in Heidelberg. And every morning I had to get up about six and take a train all\nby myself to go to Heidelberg and in the evening I returned home. I did this for one or two\nyears, well until the Kristallnacht, and then I think that school closed. One or two years, yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have very much memory of the school, except that there was a lot of persecution. I was\nasked to leave the room when they talked about Nazi indoctrination, which of course made us\nlittle Jewish boys stick out like a sore thumb. And of course, whenever the kids could catch me\nthey would either push me into the --- some --- the embankment that fell up from the road, or\nbeat me up otherwise --- anything they could do. Recently, I returned to Germany. This is an\naside. And the seminary student, who 1s 28 years old wrote a thesis on the life of the Jewish\ncommunity in this town. And he found a lot of details about the history of the community, and\nmyself and my family, and so on. Things that I didn\u2019t know, I had forgotten. And, in fact, he\nfound my school records. And I had forgotten all my grades, but I can tell you they were\nterrible.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s not surprising.",
        "A: How what?",
        "A: Well, I really don\u2019t remember. I think all the teachers were Nazis, ultimately. Otherwise I don\u2019t\nthink they could teach. And I think as long as he had to put up with me he did, and when I was\nprohibited from attending, I guess --- I really don\u2019t know. But I was surprised to find my grades\nafter about 50 years, you know. Wasn\u2019t particularly paramount on my mind.",
        "A: I have the piece of paper, if you want to look at it.",
        "A: It\u2019s quite amazing. It\u2019s quite an experience to meet these Germans. In fact, it\u2019s something I\u2019d\nlike to talk to you about later.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what the percentages was, but I have the impression it was maybe 80/20\nProtestant, but I can\u2019t tell you. There was one church each, of course.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember really playing with any particular kids. When you ask that question,\nthe image comes to mind of the first funeral I went to. One of the non-Jewish kids died of\nsomething and the whole class, I was still in the public school, went to the funeral. The first\ntime I\u2019ve ever been in the cemetery. And I vividly remember the open grave and the casket in it\nand every kid was supposed to go by and drop a flower on top of this casket. And I was so\nscared, I just couldn\u2019t do it. That\u2019s all I remember. Now whether this kid was a particular\nfriend of mine, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have any vivid memory of ever really playing, or really\nhaving a good time to tell you the truth. I, or perhaps I and my brother, but my brother was so\nmuch younger, were always too busy fleeing from being attacked. I remember the streets were\nfull of pretty large rocks. These were not paved roads, they were dirt roads with rock over\nthem. And I always had bloody knees because I always kept stumbling and falling as the kids\nwould pursue me or they would throw rocks. They were very handy little missiles, you know,\npick them off the floor and start throwing. So my memories were not particularly happy ones in\nthat town.",
        "A: Yeah, of course.",
        "A: No, they didn\u2019t bother with me. Not that I remember. I think that some of the older people in\ntown, in the time of higher excitement, particularly after, maybe Hitler made a speech, and we\nwould venture out in the street, in those days they still had horses and wagons, you know. I\nremember vividly one particular man who lived close by coming down that street on a wagon\nand taking his, what do you call this thing that you hit horses with?",
        "A: Yeah. Take the whip and try to catch me walking in the street. You know, with the whip.",
        "A: Cracking ---",
        "A: No, not in my direction. He hit me.",
        "A: Yeah. But I think in general that, kind of, was the exception.",
        "A: I guess so. I really don\u2019t have any strong memories of that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I think just that one day, I think, my parents told me I was going to\nHeidelberg to continue school. And they would buy me a ticket, a monthly commuter ticket,\njust like the Long Island Railroad. And every morning, I would end up on that train with a\nschool bag on my back and a big thermos bottle in the school bag with the books, that was my\nlunch.",
        "A: Well I think the village was full of them. And based on what this fellow wrote in his thesis,\nmore recently, apparently, he tried to interview some of them even as late as last year. They\nthreatened him with mayhem if he kept up the research.",
        "A: Of course we observed many of the, we saw many of the Nazi festivals, and so on, going on.\nBut, you know, the Nazis were, as usual, disciplined, and they would only take over the action\nwhen it was sanctioned like, Kristallnacht, and so on and so forth. Otherwise, because,\npresumably, my father --- not presumably, but my father was a soldier in World War I. He had\nsomewhat higher stature, if you like, in hierarchy of how they were treating the Jews and some\nothers. Of course in the final analysis it didn\u2019t do him any good.",
        "A: Yeah, he was in the German army for four years.",
        "A: Yeah, he had a cross of this, a cross of that, which I remember he dramatically threw at the\nGestapo agent when they eventually deported us.",
        "A: In 1940.",
        "A: Is that really ---?",
        "A: Was that so? I had no idea. I see. A little distinction. Yeah, they did make a little distinction.",
        "A: Yes and I remember when the --- after the Kristallnacht, he was arrested and he was sent to\nDachau like most of the males, if not all of them. He was privileged. He was let out four weeks\nafterwards and some other people had to wait a little bit longer.",
        "A: Yeah, well I think most of them returned home.",
        "A: His crime? I guess being a Jew.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Well all the males were arrested, after the Kristallnacht so the reason, I don\u2019t know what they\nare, logical, or if they needed any.",
        "A: Yeah, but before we talk about it, I\u2019d like to tell you one incident which was --- and I don\u2019t\nremember what year it was. We lived in this little town called Humfenheim, essentially an\nagricultural town. In those days some farmers still lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs.\nI mean that\u2019s how close they were. And, the regional town called Sinsheim is about four\nkilometers from there. And for some reason or another, my brother and I were walking to\nSinsheim I don\u2019t remember why, and one of the pleasures along that road was that the road was\nlined on both sides with apple trees. It must have been the time when the apples were just about\nripened, but they weren\u2019t ripe yet. And to this day I love green apples. We ate a lot of green\napples as we walked along that national road, a two-lane road. And we\u2019d take a bite out of the\napple and we would throw the rest of the apple at whatever car was speeding by. We would\nmiss most of them but this particular car, we hit right smack on the door and the whole apple\nsplattered. The car came to a grinding halt, backed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the\nSS sign of this particular car which was on the road. And the SS guy comes out of the car. \u201cWho\nthrew the apple?\u2019 And we both denied it, and of course he knew we were lying. He took our\nname and didn\u2019t say anything more. That night we came home and our father says, \u201cI had a\ncall... I was visited by the police. What did you guys do? You were throwing apples.\u201d \u201cWe\nweren\u2019t throwing apples.\u201d And he hit us across the face, I can still...",
        "A: I lied to my father.",
        "A: Well, I was so scared. I remember that very vividly. So when you say did I encounter any\nNazis, well that was a very close encounter.",
        "A: I would guess it was 1938.",
        "A: Probably, yeah, probably.",
        "A: No, no, we would throw apples at any car.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I presume he did, as long as it was all right to buy from a Jewish shop.",
        "A: Well, I think it quickly went to pot, but I don\u2019t really remember the details, really, I had very\nlittle to do with the store.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I really don\u2019t know. I think it probably followed the typical German history of this time.\nThese villages were surprisingly proactive. And based on what this fellow, recently has told\nme, it\u2019s still true.",
        "A: Oh is that so, I see, I didn\u2019t realize that.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah, well because everybody knew everybody and of course the Jews stuck out like a sore\nthumb I suppose.",
        "A: No, but at least you knew who they were, and of course... An interesting incident that this guy\ntold me. There\u2019s a bakery there in this village, today, and would you believe that every Friday\nthey bake and sell challah? And he told me that they do this because I guess the Christian\npopulation loved the challah, even though it was Jewish bread, right. And today, they have\nforgotten what the history, he told me, they forgotten the history of why is this bread baked the\nway it Is.",
        "A: Yeah. This generation at least, has forgotten. It is amazing.",
        "A: Oh yes, yeah, for the weekend, in other words. That\u2019s amazing I thought... here is archeology in\naction while I\u2019m still alive.",
        "A: From that time?",
        "A: Well, one memory 1s the...all of these villages had communal gardens... and if you didn\u2019t, most\npeople didn\u2019t have a lot of land on their own, they lived in these villages, you could get a little\nplot from the community, raise your own vegetables and of course, you take that home. And I\nremember my mother working in this communal garden, you know. And we, as kids, would go\nto the local river which flows right by, which when I look at it now is about three feet wide, at\nthat time it looked terrifying, and take water out and put it in the garden. I\u2019m still afraid of\nwater because we used to swim in this water, or try to, and the other kids would like to drown\nus. And I\u2019m still terrified of the water. In fact, I\u2019m a very poor swimmer, I think as a result of\nthat.\nA? Yeah. Incidents, and Iam a sailor too. I...One winter, we, I had some sort like a snow- suit on,\nvery warmly dressed, it was very cold there. And in the kitchen we had a cooking stove which\nwas fired, I think, by coal or wood, probably coal. And a big pot of soup was bubbling away.\nSomeone accidently turned that soup over and it landed on my leg. I got a tremendous burn\nover here. This was the time when Jews couldn\u2019t receive medical attention from non-Jewish\ndoctors and there was no Jewish doctor in this town. And I almost died because they...\nEventually the doctor that delivered me in 1929 who came from another little town, this\nSisnheim I was talking about, snuck into the house at night and provided some limited\namount of medical attention.. I remember that particular incident. Of course I\u2019m carrying that\nscar around",
        "A: No, he was not. He was a Christian doctor. I don\u2019t remember his name but he was a nice guy. I\nremember a time, you probably know the year, when they insisted that all of the Jewish boys\nand girls get a Jewish identity card. When is that \u201938?",
        "A: \u00b038. Again we had to go to this (unintelligible ) town and get the card, get the picture. In fact I\nhave the picture here in my file, and from then on I had a middle name called Israel.",
        "A: She would have been Sarah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any real recollection. They must have been so preoccupied and so overwhelmed\nwith the day-to-day problems of making a living and making ends meet that if they did talk\nabout it maybe they talked about it when I wasn\u2019t present but I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember how far that went, or how long this lasted. I have no idea.",
        "A: Yeah, vividly.",
        "A: Vividly.",
        "A: Yeah, what I saw. I went to the train that morning, and went to school in Heidelberg. This\ndidn\u2019t happen in the night of the 9th to 10th in this village.",
        "A: Yeah, I guess they didn\u2019t get the message or something. Even though, you know, this was a\nparticular (unintelligible) what was his name? Wagner, I think, who apparently was more rabid\nthan most. And apparently he was a major factor behind this. And the first thing I knew 1s\nwhen I got to Heidelberg and got to school, in the school, they told a lot of kids to go back\nhome because something was happening. Or maybe they told us what was happening. I don\u2019t\nremember the specific event. I went back to the railroad station.",
        "A: Yes. The Jewish school. I went back to the railroad station and caught the first train I possibly\ncould. This was not exactly on the half-hour. And as I was walking out from the railroad\nstation and looking up the so called main street, right by the little post office I suddenly saw my\nparents pushing a very large pushcart with whatever, in retrospect, they could save from this\napartment which was right adjoining the synagogue I was telling you about. And pushing it,\nyou know, to my uncle\u2019s house where they had made room for us to live with them. They did\nnot, as I remember, they didn\u2019t burn that synagogue. They literally took axes and hammers and\nkind of destroyed it bit by bit without setting it on fire. When I was in Germany about a year\nand a half ago, for the second time, the local minister walked me around the village. This is a\nwhole separate subject. And he took me to the place where the synagogue was, which I had a\nlittle trouble remembering and, well, there it was. They had managed to put a little plaque up\nwhich said \u201cformer synagogue\u201d. They had, of course appropriated eventually the real estate,\nand a pharmacy had been built on that lot. So there\u2019s no evidence. That\u2019s really all I remember\nexcept my father being arrested, sent to Dachau and came back, I believe about four weeks\nlater. It was snowing. This was November so this would make sense. December, January or\nsomething like that. He was limping very badly, had a red bandage, a red kerchief-like tied\naround foot, you know, ambling into the house. I remember that particular scene. That\u2019s about\nall I can remember.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. It was all destroyed.",
        "A: Yeah, all the furniture was destroyed and whatever belongings we might have had were\ndestroyed except what they could manage to get on that cart.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: I believe so, yeah. He was too young to go to school at that time.",
        "A: Not really, not really.",
        "A: Well, no, he was also at Dachau, so here you had all the women and children living in this one\nplace. That\u2019s the place where I got burned so it must have been \u00b038, \u201939 it must have been.\nThat\u2019s right.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t. I think it was ... I think I remember tears but I don\u2019t remember words.",
        "A: It\u2019s a blank. I don\u2019t remember what life was like the nest two years, except that my father\u2019s\nbrother, with his wife and daughter, the (?) that was mentioned earlier. We lived in South\nBirken which is more or less on the border with France. I guess they were forced to evacuate\nbecause Jews couldn\u2019t live too close to the border, I suppose, and they also moved in with us,\nwith that uncle. So now a family of two suddenly became five and now suddenly became eight.\nAnd of course, the house got a little tight with eight.",
        "A: No. Yeah. The uncle we moved in with was the uncle of my father, not my uncle.",
        "A: Yeah. I think the two brothers were brothers of his.",
        "A: Yes, he was the true uncle to me. He was my father\u2019s brother.",
        "A: Yeah, it was crowded.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t believe so. I\u2019m not sure, I\u2019m not sure.",
        "A: No I don\u2019t know what happened to that school. I remember the teachers names(?).",
        "A: Not really except that you know that the war was so favorable to the Germans so quickly they\nwere all elated and I think the happier they were the more anti-Jewish they became. I mean it\njust were a way of beating up on somebody. I remember vividly, I must have gone to school\nbecause I was in Heidelberg, and they had a big exhibition under a tent in the middle of the\ntown square of some of the war booty that they had captured in Poland and France. I think it\nwas French equipment, maybe also British equipment from Dunkirk.. And of course,\ntheoretically, only Germans were allowed there. At that time we couldn\u2019t go to the movie...\nI\u2019ve never seen a movie in Germany, no we couldn\u2019t go to the movies...",
        "A: And, I always passed myself off as a German, you know, or a non-Jew. And, I would Heil\nHitler up and down that tent, you know, and look at all that equipment, you know. AII the kids,\nall the boys are interested in guns and stuff like that.",
        "A: Of course they didn\u2019t. I had no trouble passing.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I thought of myself as anything other than. But I really didn\u2019t\nhave any of these philosophical opinions at the time.\nweaponry...",
        "A: Well, I remember Heil Hitlering, you know, just to get by, because 1t seemed like the thing to do\n(?) I had blond hair in those days, I still have blue eyes.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t have a problem.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, as I can remember it, the police came to the door and they told us we had two hours to\npack some minimum amount they allowed us to carry, I forgot how many kilograms it may have\nbeen. And we went. One of them stayed with us.",
        "A: One of the Germans.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I thought he had a black uniform on but I\u2019m not sure. I know he had a gun.\nGuns were still somewhat unique. And he kind of rested his hand on the gun, I think it was just\na way of kind of resting his hand, I don\u2019t think he meant anything. And frankly, I don\u2019t know\nwhat the reaction of my parents was. Except that there was a lot of scurrying around and\ngrabbing suitcases and so on and so forth and stuffing in rather irrelevant things I\u2019m sure. In\nfact, I know it was irrelevant because later on I found some of those things.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no, I don\u2019t think so. And that\u2019s one incident I remember when my father had\nsome words with the policeman. He might have known him. I don\u2019t know whether he was a\nlocal guy or not. And, kind of threw him or handed him his Iron Cross from World War I. The\nnext thing I remember is we walked through the streets, I believe, down to City Hall, where the\nbus, some sort of bus or perhaps truck was waiting and they put us all in this truck, with\nwhatever bags we had. The local Germans were, of course, were looking around their curtains,\nof course, and their doorways and what not. I don\u2019t remember anybody saying anything. And\nthey trucked us to Heidelberg. To the railroad station. Where we boarded a waiting train. This\nwas not a cattle car train, this was a passenger coacher, and there we sat, probably waiting for a\nnumber of other people coming in, and eventually the train started to move. I remember an\nincident where the accompanying Germans, I presumed they were Gestapo but I really don\u2019t\nknow, asked for all valuables. And I presume, as good Germans, we probably handed them\nover, I really don\u2019t know. That\u2019s about all I can remember from the trip except eventually we\nstopped at the German border, and I\u2019m almost 100% sure it stopped in Mullhurst.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah because I remember, I think I saw that name on the station. And it stopped and went\nand it took a rather long time and eventually it ended up in some siding. We had no idea where\nwe were because nobody told us where we were going. And they took us off the train and \u2019'm\nquite sure it was raining and we ended up on dump trucks, I know these were dump trucks.\nThere was a lot of mud, and they trucked us, I guess, from (?) railroad station (?) into what\nturned out to be Gurst (?). I had no idea where they were taking us. I mean I had no idea what\nwas going on. We just...it\u2019s almost like being asleep walk at this point. I don\u2019t know what the\nadults were thinking.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. I had no idea.",
        "A: I had no idea and I\u2019m not sure they told this to anybody till eventually they ended up in France\nand of course they probably could see and read the signs at that time. We knew nothing about\nthis Madagascar business and so on that eventually developed.",
        "A: Family?",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Well, I presume so. Yeah. I knew all the Jews were deported at the same time...",
        "A: ...and I presume we were more or less in the same carriage. I imagine they loaded those as\npeople came along, I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. But, I know that after my parents were re-deported from Gurst to\nAuschwitz eventually, my mother left behind one of those suitcases which somehow reached\nme where I was and it had a lot of bed linen in it.",
        "A: No beds. No. But bed- linens. At long last.",
        "A: Well as you know Gurst was divided and men and women were separated. Both of us ended\nwith the mother. We were in (?) if I remember right. You know being curious boys, this was all\nnew. There was naturally a fence around it. There were barracks, completely bare. I don\u2019t\nbelieve we had mattresses. I don\u2019t remember that when we moved in there. And all the people\nwere just kind of laying like stacked wood, one next to the other. I saw my first death there one\nmorning. Someone who was laying near me, perhaps not next to me, passed away during the\nnight and my mother rushed me out of the room, the barracks, as quickly as she could. This\nwas October/November, and as you know was rather miserable weather. Very muddy, very\nrainy, rather cold. I don\u2019t remember the barracks being heated, but they might have been. It\nwas a rather, you know, difficult situation. The toilets were communal and washing area was\ncommunal where everyone washed in a long trough with, I believe it was a pipe that had a\nbunch of holes punched in it and someone turned the faucet on and the water came out.",
        "A: Yeah. I believe so, yeah. I don\u2019t believe there were showers. I can\u2019t remember any showers.\nBut then as a boy I wasn\u2019t too anxious to shower anyway. I remember the toilets. They were\nsurprisingly mechanical. You climbed up a bunch of stairs and there was a platform. And they\nhad the fifty gallon barrels under the big hole and you did your thing and then it plopped into\nthe barrel. And the...the small narrow range railroad, railway, rail line, circled the camp and\nthey would move these barrels on top of some sort of flatbed car like affair, and they would\npush it to wherever they would dump it. That\u2019s how they moved it. I don\u2019t remember why I\nwould know that detail. As kids, we would... the camp of course was not guarded by Germans.\nThis was Vichy France, guarded by French soldiers who were relatively loose. I don\u2019t know\nhow, but, we as kids, managed to crawl under the fence and go to visit our father in the separate\npart of this camp. My father lucked out because he was a butcher, they thought he would make\na cook. And he ended up working in the kitchen. And he would sneak us an extra piece of\nbread or whatever he could lay his hands on. I have some vague memory of going... Some of\nthe older boys would sneak into the local town, which was about...",
        "A: Yeah. And I remember buying some pate, in a tin can. I don\u2019t know where we got the money,\nand going back to camp at night. I remember one guard, oh yeah ... we had a very good\nlooking redhead in this barracks and...",
        "A: Yeah, I instantly fell in love with her. I don\u2019t know how old she was, she must have eighteen,\ntwenty. With long reddish hair. P\u2019ve had a red hair fetish ever since. And, I remember\nwatching her making love with that French soldier, that French guard. She wore a cross and\nobviously she was half, so-called, half Jewish.",
        "A: No. I was too young. I saw my father\u2019s? brother there a few times. I saw the other uncle, my\nmother\u2019s brother. I don\u2019t remember seeing my grandmother, who died there.",
        "A: But she died after I left. The mud is the most memorable thing I think. It\u2019s an incredible mark,\nit\u2019s very deep. We, somehow, we, many of us ended up with galoshes, which is, you know, sort\nof a rubber shoe. If you stepped in that mud and then tried to pull it out, the suction of that mud\nwas such that you could lose your shoe. And I remember many older people, falling in that mud\nand having a hell of a time getting back out of it. And if you went to help them, they would pull\nyou in the mud. And so for many months (?) struggled with that mud. I don\u2019t know why that\nsticks in my head, but it seems to have been a major problem...",
        "A: I remember getting some terribly strong vaccinations and believe it or not I have a certificate\nfrom (?) signed by the doctor at (?) against typhoid, diphtheria, etc. etc. Apparently these things\ndeveloped in those great environments very quickly and they inoculated, I guess, all the kids.\nAnd I presume many of the deaths which occurred there, probably occurred due to some of\nthese epidemics that developed that you might know more about us than I do.",
        "A: The standard fare seemed to be just some sort of a soup with some vegetables floating in it,\nthat\u2019s all I can remember.",
        "A: Not particularly. The French eat a lot of beets, at least we ended up with a lot of beets, and (?)\nwe called them.",
        "A: Oh I think we were always hungry.",
        "A: Yeah. I don\u2019t remember any particular packages coming in from the Salvation Army or the Red\nCross and so on. I know these people in later years, I found out they were quite active, but I\nwasn\u2019t particularly aware of that activity. It doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t exist. As I said we\nmanaged to get some extra pieces of bread from my father. He would hold it at the end of a\nlong fork against this open fire where they had these big, tremendous, fifty- gallon drums\nbubbling away with the coup of the day and he would toast it. And they had these, maybe five\ngallon drums of fat standing there, and he would spread that on the toasted bread and that would\ntaste like heaven.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think there was any attempt at that.",
        "A: Not that \u2019'm aware of, not that I\u2019m aware of.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe so, not while I was there, no. I have no recollection of that.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how we spent the time.",
        "A: I guess, you know, kids at that age, as long as they are in reasonably good health, I guess we ran\naround, we probably became very rowdy and non-controllable, I suppose. I really don\u2019t know\nwhat we did.",
        "A: I imagine I blocked out quite a bit of these negative part, I only seem to remember the better\nparts, I guess.",
        "A: I have no idea. I don\u2019t what the adults knew. I had no idea what they talked about. I don\u2019t\nknow if they, men and women, ever got together even for talking purposes. All I know 1s that\none day my mother and father both said that they had volunteered us to be taken out of the\ncamp by some organization and I don\u2019t remember my reaction. I don\u2019t know whether I was\ndelighted or reluctant. But we found ourselves, I guess, again on the truck with forty-seven\nsome other children, fifty children were taken out and we eventually ended up in a French\norphanage, near that camp.",
        "A: Yes. This was in 1941, February \u00b041.",
        "A: So I was in that camp about three to four months.",
        "A: Yes, so my brother and I, with the other kids, were taken to the orphanage and it turned out later\non that a branch of the American Quakers, the American Friends Service Committee, acting\nthrough the Swedish chapter, had made arrangements with the French government to take these\nfifty children out. The French in World War 1, you know, had lost many men, so there were\nmillions, I guess literally millions, of households without males. So they built a whole number\nof orphanages ... (side one of tape ended, pick up with side two)",
        "A: Yeah. And this was now roughly twenty years later. The orphans of course had grown up, the\norphanages were relatively empty and, I guess, somebody was smart enough to realize that here\nwas a possible place where, at least you could put some people. As I understand it, the Quakers\ncommitted themselves to feed the whole orphanage if they took these fifty Jewish children ...\nSo we ended up in this orphanage in a little place called Aspet, A-S-P-E-T, in the Haute Garron\n(?) department. Near...",
        "A: No, no, no. This was right at the foot of the Pyrenees. It was not too far from (?). It was near a\nlarger town called Saint Grodance (???).",
        "A: I guess so. But it is quite close by. We ended up in this orphanage. I believe it was a two or\nthree story affair, there was a sort of a classical institutional looking affair. These German kids,\nof course now we were Germans, we weren\u2019t Jewish, in this French institution. The French had\njust lost the war so they didn\u2019t have a lot of love for the Germans, right. So we were the (?) no\nmatter how you looked at it. The director of the camp was an interesting man ...",
        "A: Of the orphanage, and he had some women who helped him. They organized us like little\nsoldiers and that\u2019s how ... there were roughly half and half boys and half girls in this little\ngroup of Jewish children.",
        "A: We were kept separate. As I remember we did not go to German schools, French schools rather.",
        "A: He was French.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: The Quakers just came and went. I mean they came perhaps once every few months and see\nhow we were doing and then left. I guess they provided food in part for the whole institution.\nThere were of course other French children there. It was a fairly self-contained community\nrelatively speaking. They had their own fields where they raised vegetables. I remember they\nhad a man on the horse who did the plowing. They had an infirmary there. And I guess they\ntried to bring us up as sort of little bit like French kids would be. They walked us around the\nhall somewhat on a military side, but I guess that\u2019s the only way you could control fifty kids.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t think we had wine.",
        "A: Swedish.",
        "A: I think we did some chores and at sometime they brought in a Jewish couple who lived in the\nvillage and I think he would come in and give us some modicum of instruction. I doubt it was\nparticularly effective but they made an attempt when he was till busy hiding of course. This\nwas Vichy France at the time. The only memories I have is this farmer who took care of the\nfields where they grew the vegetables, one day they decided, somebody decided, they were\ngoing to kill the cows so they could feed the kids. And it\u2019s an indescribable scene on how this\ncow was killed. I don\u2019t know if you want to hear about it. For the hell of it I'll tell you. There\nwas a manhole cover right in front of the so-called cafeteria, or the Refectoire, as the French\ncalled it, and they tied the cow down on this manhole which was of course steel and relatively\nheavy, by the horns, so the cow was now sort of ...",
        "A: ...Nose to the ground. And this guy, was a big guy, would take a pickaxe and would literally hit\nthis cow between the horns. It seems like hundreds of times till eventually, I don\u2019t know how\nlong it was, but it was too long, eventually the cow got on his knees and just died. The French\neat blood sausages, are you familiar with that?",
        "A: Or blood, it\u2019s not even sausage. They take the live blood and bake it, I forgot what it\u2019s called.",
        "A: Not soup, no. It becomes almost like a jello. It becomes, yeah. And that\u2019s the first thing I\nremember them feeding us. And well, that\u2019s one thing I can remember.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: No. [have had an aversion to blood ever since. But to the French this was fairly routine. If\nthey killed a sheep, which was fairly routine, the blood would be collected and that was one of\nthings ...",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well that was rare. Every afternoon it seemed like they would insist we would walk\nin fairly ordered fashion through the village and through the surrounding countryside, which in\nretrospect was quite beautiful. And they would teach us French songs and we would march to\nthese songs and that\u2019s how we got our fresh air. I remember when we first got there, I guess we\nhad a lot of lice and all the boys got their hair cut down to the scalp, including myself. I have a\npict..they took a set of I.D. pictures of every kid. I still have one of them from that time. There\nwas a lot of bed wetting, I remember and I think I was one of them. And they shamed us ...",
        "A: Oh yeah. Well I think all of the kids were obviously disturbed. And that went on a long time. I\nremember, I don\u2019t know why, I remember the toilets, the typical French, just a hole in the\nground, with an appliance over the hole and you put your feet on either side and you crouch\ndown and do your thing. Paper was very rare and many of boys would wipe their behind by just\ncleaning their finger on the wall. And one of the jobs that we had was to clean the walls. Well\nwe tried to instill in the kids to stop doing that but one kid would continue to do it and we\ncouldn\u2019t find out who it was. So we decided to stake out the toilets. The toilets had fairly high\nwalls but they were open on top and on the bottom. So we put two kids on top of the wall\nwatching, and this one kid would come into the toilet and he did his thing and wipe his finger\non the wall and of course we beat the hell out of him.",
        "A: And you know what his nickname was for the rest of the time we were there?\nQ @)",
        "A: No. The name for (?) is (?) in French. His nickname was (?). You know when you wipe your\nthing? His name was (\u2019?).",
        "A: Well what\u2019s amusing is that in 1972, I believe it was, my wife and I went back and retraced all\nthese steps I was just talking about. And we went to this little village of Aspet and the\norphanage is still there and it\u2019s now a home, they told us, for disturbed children. Of broken\nmarriages, you know divorces are also rampant in France. And I wanted to go see the toilets.\nAnd would you believe they are still there and they\u2019re still the way they were and the doors are\nstill as high as they were, it\u2019s amazing nothing has changed.",
        "A: No, that I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: No, she was born in Vienna, Austria and she came here in 1938, a day or two after Kristallnacht.\nAnd she lived in the States and I met her here in the 50\u2019s. What else do I remember of Aspet?\nNot very much except we were there until 1942 and we had, the kids who had come out of\nGurst had not seen their parents for almost two years. We were busy trying to, we were saving\nbread from our ration in shoeboxes because we were all excited that we were going to have a\ntemporary visit with our parents, who at that time had been transferred to (?). I don\u2019t know if\nall of them had but mine had. We of course would get correspondence from the parents, regular\nletters, my brother has most of these letters. And one day a car came, we were going to go there\nin August as a matter of fact.",
        "A: ...of \u201942, right. A car came, a Gestapo car came. We never saw a German in that place. The\nGestapo showed up. They went to see the director. The director called two kids in and said\nyour parents are going to be transferred and they asked that you go with them. Pack your things\nand go with these people. And they left. And I still remember the name of these kids. He was\none of my friends. And I had imagined that the worst had happened to him. I told you\ndownstairs that my brother is writing a history of all of these kids. Well he met this guy, he told\nme last year. He ended up after the war in East Germany and had a whole history of his own on\nwhat\u2019s happened in East Germany to him. So he never ended up in Auschwitz. That\u2019s what I\nhad imagined. I don\u2019t know how he eventually escaped. At any rate, to make a long story\nshort, they prevented us from going to (?) because, unbeknownst to us, that\u2019s when the\ndeportation started.",
        "A: ...re-deportation started.",
        "A: And we stayed there for, up to the time, I believe, when the Germans occupied all of France.\nWas that in \u201943?",
        "A: \"42. So it was only a month or two later, right, August, September...",
        "A: And I guess at that time they passed some sort of law that Jews couldn\u2019t live within 20 miles of\nthe Spanish border or something like that, and we were closer than that to the Spanish border\nand some magic hand, I don\u2019t know who, the Quaker, the Ouzay (?), or whatever it was, took us\nout of this camp and sent up temporarily to Toulouse, where we were in some sort of a school.\nAnd within a month or two I ended up in another town called Montsac (?) which is in a town (?)\ndepartment. And there was a children\u2019s home there which was run by a Jewish organization.",
        "A: It could have been Ousay (?) and it was on the principle of the boy scouts) That is the life of\nthis organization was, it sort of as you lived there a boy scout 24 hours a day.",
        "A: Jewish boy scouts. French Jewish boy scouts. Which 1s fairly prominent organization. In\nToulouse as I remember it, somehow my brother got separated from me. I don\u2019t know if it was\non purpose or otherwise and he ended up in Switzerland and spent the rest of the time, his time,\nin Switzerland.",
        "A: I knew we were separated.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether I knew that or not. I went to see him after the war in Switzerland so\nsomehow I knew or found out where he was.",
        "A: Yeah, but then we were ...",
        "A: ...broken up. Yeah. Different people ended up in different places. So that takes us to 1943 or\nso. Life in Montsac was quite different. This now was an openly Jewish life. I wouldn\u2019t say\nreligious but observing. We all joined boy scout troops, we made our bed, we did kitchen duty.\nThey had some sort of a schooling organized and had organized a number of trade schools there\nwhere you could learn to become a carpenter, a cabinetmaker, an iron worker, and so on and so\nforth. Not terribly practical trades today but in those days that was the thing to do. Not unlike\nthe kind of preparation, I think, for people who might want to emigrate to then Palestine. You\nknow, they\u2019d teach you a trade. That lasted for about a year.",
        "A: No. Boys and girls. It was strictly co-ed. The girls were on one floor, the boys on the other.\nAnd we were getting through the puberty stage and in fact there were some that were eighteen,\nperhaps twenty. And you know, any number of girls got pregnant. It was not unusual. But it\nwas fairly, you know, it was a decent life.",
        "A: Yes. They were French Jews and there were people from Belgium. These were families that\nmight have moved to ... children who ended up from other countries in France before the war,\ndidn\u2019t have, necessarily French passports, you know, so all kinds of mixture. There were not\nthat many German Jewish children there.",
        "A: Yes. Btu they mostly, only, talked French there. By that time you either ...",
        "A: Well, yes, more or less. I\u2019m sure with a very heavy accent.",
        "A: Yeah. By that time it was. This home started before the occupation of France.",
        "A: Yeah. Yes. I\u2019m quite sure that I ended up in early \u00b043.",
        "A: We were there for perhaps a year, maybe more than a year when it was obvious that the\nGermans now had cleaned all the concentration camps of the Jews they already had captive and\nthey were starting to arrest other Jews including the French Jews. And whoever this magic\nhands was, decided we better move all these kids so called underground, so to speak\nunderground. And we all received French identity cards, phony identity cards. My name\nbecame Marcel Mantue (?) And I ended up hidden in a county seat called (?) where French\nchildren would go to school during the school year from the farms, they would stay in the\nschool like here in the, you would have dorms in a college and you would stay ...",
        "A: Yeah. Like boarding school. But public ... Ad then during the vacation of course they would\ngo home. And I bluffed myself through that school, hiding my identity.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s right. I don\u2019t remember how successful I was. And during the summer, the same\ninvisible hand had managed to make arrangements with a number of farms in the area to take a\nnumber of children who had no other place to go. Whether these people knew we were Jewish\nor not, I have no idea and I spent either one or two summers during the summer vacation that\nway on the farm. Guarding sheep. Very useful, typical French farmhouse. Probably ate very\nwell.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s south.",
        "A: All southern France. While we were in Montsac, of course, in the boy scouts we would camp\nduring the summer. We would, in fact we camped somewhere near (?) in that French, 1n that\npartisan village we were talking about earlier. We would celebrate the Jewish holidays. We had\na chorale , a singing chorale, which was presumably quite good, led by a young guy who\nbecame quite famous and lived in Geneva, Switzerland, perhaps (?) and a chorale director. It\nwas in retrospect, an interesting life.",
        "A: Yeah. There were some tense moments while we were underground, you know, as I guess we\nmoved into 1944.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t remember exactly. There was one summer when we ended up in some other\narrangement and the Germans, I guess, had found out that there might be either some Jews\nhiding or some (?) fighters hiding and they raided this place and we had to disappear into the\nwoods rather hurriedly. We heard machine guns of course and a number of people were\narrested but somehow I managed to get away.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I guess there was more concerned for fellows who were eighteen, twenty,\ntwenty-five years old. I was still fourteen, fifteen at the time. On the assumption you could\nhide your identity. You know, if you didn\u2019t register for labor in Germany and so on you were\nsubject to arrest even if you were French. Well that\u2019s how we somehow got through the war.\nWe somehow heard about D-Day. And eventually we all ended up back in Montsac in this\nhome. The home now took over a building, a relatively new building that the Vichy\ngovernment had built for physical education because they were going to develop their own\nmaster race. So we ended up in this rather posh building which today, incidentally is a hotel\nwhich I slept in when I was back there in 1972. It was a time-warp experience of it\u2019s own. And",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly where I was.",
        "A: Yeah. Must have been in the summer of *44.",
        "A: The only real memory I have is seeing a big pipeline with a lot of gasoline leaking out of it and\nI\u2019ve never seen red gasoline before, it was all red, on some of the major roads we were hiking\non. I think, of course, that happened while we were in the boy-scout camp since they landed in\nJune. This all happened during the summer so I presume we were not in school at that time.",
        "A: Yeah. So I\u2019m sure I saw the pipeline that came out from probably Marseilles or (?). There\nwasn\u2019t any significant fighting as I remember it in that area. I think most of the fighting was up\nnorth of course and it didn\u2019t take too long for the Germans to all hustle themselves north and\neast trying to...",
        "A: ...to defend the Normandy part of the invasion. But I don\u2019t think there was any fighting.",
        "A: I see. I see. So what we saw more of was the (?) taking revenge on the local French,\nparticularly, I remember rather vividly the women who had so-called fraternized with the\nFrench, getting their hair shorn, that was more prominent.",
        "A: So we ended back in Montsac and tried to return to normal. The school started again etc. etc.\nSomehow I believe this was a Quaker (?) somehow got in touch with me. They wanted to know\nif I knew anyone in the United States and whether I wanted to go there. So I said, \u201cWell, yes I\nremember my parents telling me about an uncle in the United States.\u201d In retrospect, it wasn\u2019t an\nuncle, it was a second cousin of my grandmother\u2019s. It was a man who had come over in\nsomething like 1908. In fact, he was a brother of the man we moved in with after Kristallnacht.\n(?) and they placed an ad in the paper, in the New York area, and he had over his many years,\nsponsored maybe something like 20 or 30 couples to come here (?) And he told me in retrospect\nhe got a lot of calls.",
        "A: On this ad. Well, at this time they were curious on who survived. None of his families. And\nhe asked me whether I come over. And I said yes. I remember receiving a very large package\nwith, I believe a salami that looked like it was three feet long but maybe it was only one foot.\nAnd I remember standing at the children\u2019s home, in my room which I shared with a number of\nother boys, and slicing salami for two or three hours because everybody\u2019s coming by getting a\npiece of salami. After about a year, well, in fact it was December \u201946, I eventually came over.",
        "A: And I came over early, believe it or not, because I was not on a Jewish quota. I was now on a\nGerman quota. And the German quota was undersubscribed because during the war, obviously\ndid not come to the United States.",
        "A: Yeah, and since I had so called ... in the eyes of the Americans I was a German, so I could get\nin under the German quota. Irony, isn\u2019t it. So I ended up in Manhattan. I came over on the\nNormandy (?)\nQ @)",
        "A: No, I stayed here five years and I had a dying to go to California and I did. I ended up in\nCalifornia for 15-16 years and came back here in 1970. And here we are in 1992.\nA Yes, I went to visit him after I had agreed to come here to talk him into coming with me. He\nhad come under the influence of very religious Zionist organizations, I don\u2019t remember who it\nwas. He was only about 11 or 12 and he was going to go to Palestine. He insisted. And I said,\nokay, if that\u2019s what you want to do. So he ended up in Palestine before the state became Israel.",
        "A: I might have been but, I guess, not enough to do it.",
        "A: Yes, they wanted to come here. And as a matter of fact they had a quota. Believe it or not I\nremember the number. Not exactly, but 1t was something like 16,000 something, and they were\nwaiting for an affidavit from this same uncle. And perhaps had the affidavit, I don\u2019t know. But\nobviously you couldn\u2019t go until your number was up.\n"
