        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s May 17\", 2000 and we\u2019re conducting an interview with Mr. Oscar Haber here in his\nhome in Lexington, Kentucky and this 1s an interview for the Holocaust Survivors in Kentucky\nInterview Project, which is being sponsored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,\nas well as the Kentucky Oral History Commission. We are doing an interview that will focus\nmostly on Mr. Haber\u2019s experiences after the Holocaust because he has been interviewed before\nby the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation. And there is a videotape that is available through the\nShoah Foundation. My name is Arwen Donahue and this is tape number one, side A. Mr.\nHaber, let\u2019s start with your date of birth.",
        "A: March 8\", 1910.",
        "Q: And you talked about, in your other interview and by the way if we ever repeat anything, we\u2019 ll\ntry to just cover things that we haven\u2019t talked about before. But I\u2019m sure that you don\u2019t\nremember everything that you said and didn\u2019t say, so I might remind you sometimes if we\u2019ve\nalready talked about something. But in your other interview you did mention that you went, you\nhad an unusual opportunity, you were growing up in a small town, in a shtetl and you were one\nof nine children, and you had an unusual opportunity to attend a high school, a public high\nschool and eventually became a dentist. And I\u2019m wondering how it happened that you had this\nopportunity to study in a public high school and where the high school was?",
        "A: The high school was in Debica, which is in the district of Krakow and that was about nine\nkilometers of my village where I was born. And we had, from the age of three, in our house,\nalways a teacher, special for religious purposes. But by this same occasion we were studying\nnormal classes. So in the age of four I could already go in the village to the first class of public\nschool and I still was a good pupil, because no one of them was on the level I was. But I finished\nthere the fourth year and my father decided I have to go into the small city, which was Debica\nthere. In the same time, he put us in a quarter, that means to live in the house of a Rabbi, which\nwas teaching us the Hebrew and the religious teachings. In the same time I went to the Polish\npublic school. And that was a very difficult experience because we have to get up in the\nmorning at six o\u2019clock, sometimes earlier, and before we went to the public school in the\nmorning for eight o\u2019clock it started, we had already to pray and to learn Hebrew and to learn\neverything about religious life. And more and more. So, I was there about six years living with\nthis Rabbi. At the same time after I graduated from the normal school, from the seven classes, I\napplied to the high school, but I was too young. Because it was already that you can go to\nschool, start school only by the age of seven, and I was four years old. But I was somehow\nfortunate, my father knew the director of this high school. And he spoke with him and he said,\n\u201cWell I cannot do it. He has to go normal now to the sixth class at least, at least and to repeat.\u201d\nAnd my father said, \u201cYou know, make him a test.\u201d\u201d And I got a test and I passed the test, but still\n1\nhe couldn\u2019t take me. I had to repeat the seventh grade another year. And then I was accepted to\nthe high school. And there I matriculated there and so I continued my studies.",
        "Q: So, what language did you speak at home?",
        "A: Well, the first language we spoke, that was Yiddish. My father was very religious and he want\nus to know the Yiddish, we are spoken. But we had Polish Gentile servants, too, so we have to\nspeak Polish too. And surrounded by peasants who are speaking Polish and you have to knew\nthe language. In the school was Polish of course. When I went to school in Debica there was in\nthe fourth class was already German, too. So I had German, Polish and Yiddish, and of course,\nHebrew, which was, it was the liturgical language, to pray. At the age of three we started already\nto learn Hebrew and we knew the Hebrew alphabet and we knew to pray and most of the\nprayings until today, I know by heart. Most of the thick books, we learn, we have to do it. And\nthe first when you opened eyes at the religious house, the first is to wash your hands, that\u2019s the\nfirst things. And to make a blessing about the washing the hands and you make a blessing for the\nfood and you have to thank God that you got up in the morning. That was the first Hebrew\npraying and that was at the age of three. At the age of four we started already to learn the Torah,\nwhich is the Bible, the Old Testament. And so we continued to, so therefore I am quite\nacquainted about religious Jewish life. And then later on, of course, in high school we learned\nabout, in the public school we learned about history and that was very interesting, world history,\ntoo. And German literature. And therefore I, until today, I am quite acquainted with the world\nliterature and especially the German literature and the Hebrew, of course. And the Yiddish. So,\nthis is the way like it was. It was a very hard thing, because the distance to the town was like I\nsaid about nine kilometers, eight or nine kilometers. I don\u2019t remember exactly. And for\nSaturday we used to go home, I mean to the village. And when we came to the village Saturday,\nthere was the traditional Friday evening meal with the praying, with everything. In our house\nwas there a minyan, which is the quorum of ten people which is praying, Jews, by Jewish law.\nAnd my late father, by himself with his own funds, he founded a Torah. He let scribe it, and we\nhad a new Torah in our house and there was a praying in our house and my father was the master\nof the ceremony. And the people from the villages around, which were few, not always was\nthere the quorum of ten people. But Saturday morning was always a praying in quorum. If it\nwasn\u2019t quorum, so how many it was, but it was the normal pray. And we had to know it and to\nparticipate. And that was in afternoon, my father take a sleep one hour and he took us 1n the\nroom, me and my brother, because my older brother was with me in the school at this Rabbi. He\nwas sitting down and we had to repeat what we learned all the week. My father wanted to know\nwhat we learned and how far we are continuing to progress. And that was the way like it was in\nour house. Of course, Saturday was like in the Torah is resting day. And that was the religious\nway of life. Nothing was working, nobody was working, even the servants. Only to feed the\nanimals, to milk the cows and that what was doing. But not working in the field, not other work\nwas performed. Only the most necessary for surviving, which was necessary.",
        "Q: You mentioned that one of the towns nearby, Ropczyce, had a strong Hasidic tradition. Did your\nfamily have any Hasidic ties or traditions?",
        "A: My father by himself was a Hasid. But he didn\u2019t go to Ropcezyce because the old Ropcezyce\nRabbi wasn\u2019t more. The founder of the Hasidic movement which was Reb Nafthali, which you\n2\nknow. And he was no more alive. There was already third or fourth generation there and there\nwas no potential Rabbi which could, which could affinate (ph) my father there. My father used\nto go to Sans (ph) , which was quite a distance, about fifty miles. To go for holidays there to the\nRabbi of Sans (ph). Also sometimes OfBobof (ph), which is also a little shtetl there in the\nsurroundings of Sans (ph). They were the very famous Rabbis, which is the continuation of this\nRabbis is now here in the United States. They are siblings and family offsprings, which are\ncontinue this Hasidic movement of Bobof (ph) and of Sans (ph). And that was, my father was a\nHasid of them. He wasn\u2019t, by himself, he wasn\u2019t a blind Hasidic. He wasn\u2019t overdoing. But the\nbasic religious things were holy for him. And that was my father. Of course my mother did\neverything what my father said to do. The thing was, my father, his first wife passed away. And\nfrom his first wife, gave birth a daughter and by the birth she passed away. He was a young\nwidower. He was already thirty-five or thirty-six years old and a matchmaker found him a girl of\nsixteen years somewhere in another village there. And she came to live with him, and she was\nmy mother. She gave birth to the nine children. And we were in touch with our sister, because\nJewish law recognize it, one child, when it is from the same father, is a sibling, more even than\none mother. That is the religious way and tradition. Interesting enough, our sister, she married a\nvery interesting man, who was, in the beginning he was a teacher in our house, teaching us the\nreligious ways. He was very educated in Jewish Talmudic teachings. And he married her, and\nhe succeeded, he became quite a rich man. And she gave birth to eight children. And there are\nonly two children survived and they are still living. One is ninety-two years old, lives in the\nUnited States. And the other one is eighty-five years, that\u2019s the youngest one, eighty-four years\nold, lives in Israel.",
        "Q: These would be your nieces and nephews actually. Right? Officially. Your sister\u2019s children?",
        "A: Are?",
        "Q: They would be your nieces and your nephews?",
        "A: Yeah, they are my nieces and we are in touch with them and we are very much in good relations.\nAnd very interesting story about these two nieces. Both of them survived the Holocaust. The\none married in the war and had a daughter in the war. And she escaped, run away, being\npregnant from Debica, I mean this village there, to Lvov, which was in the Ukraine. Then it was\nbelonged to Poland, but the Russian invaded this part of the country, of Polish country. And she,\nwhen she saw the disaster in the ghetto, she put her child under a convent\u2019s door. And was\nlooking from far away what happened to this child. And she saw that a nun came out and she\ntook in the child in the house. And then she ran away and she became a servant, as a Polish girl,\nas a Gentile at the head of the Gestapo in Lvov. That was the older one. The younger one had a\nfriend in Lvov. She was in Lvov studying sewing, to be a seamstering. Mother, very good\nseamster, which she was. And she met there a boy, before the war he was leader already of the\ntrade unions. And when the Russian came in... in the beginning he was a very big shot. But\nwhen the Russians, when the German invaded, he went with the Russian back to Russia and\nthere he joined the Polish Army, which was organized there by the Poles after their agreement,\nthe Polish agreement in exile with the Russians, which allowed them to organize their Army,\nwhich was affiliated to the Russian Army. And they were fighting. And he was fighting the\nGermans until Berlin. And he put her on a Polish family. She was a seamster and she gave birth\n3\nto a daughter, but that was already in 1945 when the war is going to end. When he came from\nRussia to Poland with the invasion, I mean to fight with the Russian Army. And then she gave\nbirth to this daughter. And when the war was coming to an end, he became a governor of a part\nwhich was annected from Poland from the German territory there. And he took her there, and\nthey had another two sons, but they not living as Jews. And they very talented boys. And when\nit came in Poland the time where Jews moved from Poland to Israel in 1965 I guess, was it?\nSomething like this. They came, first time she told the sons that they are Jewish and they were\nalready both matriculated after high school diploma. And one of them was already studying\nengineering. And they came to Israel. But their father, himself, he in the meantime, being a\ngovernor he studied at the university at the same time to become an agronom... agronomy. And\nhe came to Israel as an agronom. But because Israel didn\u2019t have confidence to all these\napparatchiks from Poland. I mean all this communist active parties, he couldn\u2019t find a job. It\nwas very difficult to find. And we were already at this time in Israel and I had some connection\nwith people and to a member of the Israel Parliament. And I wrote to them and I warranted\nabout him, that he\u2019s not one of the Russian services and he got a job in agronomy. But he passed\naway about six or seven years ago. In the meantime, the older son is working in a very high,\nsecret Israel Army factory. And the other son was also an engineer, but in the same time he was\nteaching in a school, in a vocational school. And married a girl from Venezuela. And one year\nago they decided that they leave Israel and they came to the United States. And he got a job here\nin California. He must be very, very important engineer, because he got the, he made the green\ncard and he can work and they bought a house. But they have one son, who 1s at the Israel\nArmy. And just now I heard, two weeks ago, he went to Israel and asked to give him some off in\nthe Army. And he came to visit him here to the United States. He will not stay. He will go back\nto Israel. But he decided, his wife and with the other two children to stay in the United States.",
        "Q: Sounds as if you\u2019ve kept in pretty close touch with whatever members of your family have\nsurvived.",
        "A: Oh yeah, whatever I have. I have two brothers. I have a second cousin, who was... they were all\nin camps. And they are living here in the United States. My brothers and my second cousins.\nAre we are trying to keep all together here.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the time that we were talking about before the war. Did you end up going to\nhigh school then because your father wanted you to have oppor... special opportunities?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That normally your other siblings wouldn\u2019t have had?",
        "A: High school, further studies wasn\u2019t the main purpose of my father. My father would have very\nmuch liked me to go on and study Jewish, maybe Rabbinical even studies. But I was very\nstubborn and I was in very difficult conditions, making my study very difficult. Often in hunger,\noften have to work and to gain my life. But I did it. And I\u2019m happy I did it.",
        "Q: So it was really your, becoming a dentist was something that you really wanted to do.\n4",
        "A: I, that was my idea. That was my idea and there was also an idea which I got from a cousin of\nmine who was a dentist in the other place there. And I liked the way like he was living. I was\nenjoying more the free life. This religious life didn\u2019t match my character. I wasn\u2019t never,\nnever... even being young, following all the instructions and prescriptions, but I was never\nstrictly convinced that that was what I want to do. I was always looking on the broad world, and\nlife was for me, more interesting outside the religious life.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your first interview that you were a Polish patriot.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you politically interested or involved in Polish... well, were you interested in Polish\npolitics?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. I was, deep in my soul I was Jewish, but I found that we are living in a Polish\ncountry, this is Poland and this is our homeland and we owe to be loyal to our country. That\u2019s\nwherever I am, I found my obligation to be honest and I could avoid serving in the Polish Army\nwhich wasn\u2019t easy. It wasn\u2019t easy. It was very difficult. But it wasn\u2019t voluntary, because\nPoland was an Army which was called to the Army. That was not a voluntary army. You have\nto go, by twenty-one everyone has to go to the army except that somebody 1s unable to fulfill the\ndemand, sick and so forth. And a lot of my colleagues and a lot of Jewish people usually they\nstarted to do everything to avoid to go into the Polish Army. I didn\u2019t try it even. And I did it full\nhearted and I think it was my obligation to do it, because I owe it. I understand that it 1s a\ncommon responsibility when you are a citizen of a country, you live there, you have to do what\nbelongs. But politically I was never involved in any movement, never any movement.",
        "Q: Not...",
        "A: I loved Poland. I loved the country. It gave us opportunity and then that\u2019s it. I did what I had to\ndo.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n5\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: Tape one, side B. Were you involved in any Zionist organizations?",
        "A: It was a time I was involved in Zionist organization. It was a time I thought maybe one has to go\nto Palestine those times. I will not deny there was not in Poland anti-Semitism. But you know\nanti-Semitism until today has many faces. There is an economic anti-Semitism, there is a\npolitical anti-Semitism and there is a racist anti-Semitism. And for me and my observance, my\nconviction, I think if I analyze the Jewish situation in Poland, it was more economic anti-\nSemitism, with some reasons, objective reasons. They were nobody\u2019s fault, but the situation\nbecame so that this anti-Semitism has his logical reasons, logical reasons, maybe it shouldn\u2019t be,\nmaybe it is nobody\u2019s fault, but it was. I cannot say there was a racial anti-Semitism. Well, there\nis in every nation, there are some extreme people, which they can get... and they are more doing\nit for personal reasons and for gaining something of it. And this is also the political anti-\nSemitism, which is to gain something to rule over people. You know? And Jews were more\neducated, absolutely more educated than the common people in Poland. Because as I told you\nbefore, I started to study when I was three. You know, and this gives, whatever you study, it\ngives you more advance about people which are just starting to study something at the age of\neight or nine or ten even. Some of them didn\u2019t go to school, the Polish people didn\u2019t go to\nschool ever. There was illiteracy, too. So, when it came to elections, the Jews, they knew what\nthey wanted. And the masses didn\u2019t know. Maybe it is until today a lot of masses don\u2019t know\nwhen they are going to vote, what they need and what they want. It is until today everywhere.\nBut especially in a country like Poland, which was, which wasn\u2019t so educated. There was a lot\nof people who didn\u2019t have, it was only by propaganda, which was from mouth to mouth, from\npromises and so forth, you know. And then Poland, I would need to go into the situation of\nPoland, how Poland became free after being occupied by three countries.",
        "Q: Well let\u2019s not get into overall historical...",
        "A: Yeah, I understand. I understand, but the Jews even, in each occupied party, had different\nopportunities. In the Russian occupied part they couldn\u2019t progress like this we could make in the\nAustro-Hungarian or in the German occupied territory. So here comes the difference.\nEducation, knowledge and education, that was, is and that would always be the point. And this\ngave also the impulse for political views and for a kind of organized anti-Semitism, which for the\nJews, for the victims, it is not important what kind of anti-Semitism it is. He is anti-Semite, why\nand what, we didn\u2019t analyze and that wasn\u2019t important. We had to feel it and that what it is.",
        "Q: When you were in the Army then, in 1935 and \u201836, did you, were you primarily with non-Jewish\nPoles?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: And how was that?",
        "A: Ten percent was Jews. It was the same, approximately the same relative like it was, the\npopulation was about ten percent and there was about ten percent was in the Army.\n6",
        "Q: Were you discriminated against at all for being Jewish during your service?",
        "A: It\u2019s difficult to say that you were discriminating because Army is not the thing which gives you\nthe time. You have so many things to do that you don\u2019t have the time to play these games. But,\nbut, the officers, the Polish officers generally, generally, were anti-Semites. What kind? They\nwere so educated, they were so prepared. That was the elite. That they, but of course, they\ndidn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t want to show up as anti-Semites. But you could feel it, you could feel it. Not\neverybody felt it. And then like I said, the poorer Jews went to the Army because they were not\nable to pay to get free from the Army, not to serve. The rich Jews who didn\u2019t want to go to the\nArmy, there was always finding a way of bribery. To whom? To the Polish officers, to the\nPolish doctors, to the Polish secretaries, so that they made themselves sick and they write and\nthey are sick and they cannot serve. And so the poor and little Jews were serving in the Army.\nThere were no too many of the intelligentsia which was serving in the Army. And then there\nwas another thing. After matriculation you are going to the officer\u2019s school. And in the officer\u2019s\nschool, they didn\u2019t want the Jews to become officers. They were there because they were, after\nmatriculation that was the law. So usually they find always a way to send them back to the\nnormal Army, not to live in the school to become an officer. There were officers, Jewish\nofficers, but very few, very few. It was difficult to advance, to be a Jew and to be an officer, a\nhigh officer in the Polish Army. There were higher officers only medical officers, because they\nneeded them. They have to take them and that\u2019s what it was.",
        "Q: So, by the time you were in the Service, you were a dentist, were you a dentist already?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, so you were, your goal was just to do the service and then get out. Is that right?",
        "A: Yeah. When the time came to go out, I got a phone from Krakow that one doctor who was by\nhimself a Colonel in the Polish Army, doctor, dentist. He had private office. He was ready to\nretire and he had a private office. But he got a heart attack and they took him to hospital. And\nthey phone to me, they knew that I would go liberated, if I will be able to replace him, to fill out\nthat position. So the last day in the Polish Army... and even the greatest anti-Semite in my unit,\ncame to me, they make me a party, my departure, that was ad hoc make a party for me. He came\nto me, he said, \u201cYou know I am twenty years in the Polish Army. I am professional officer, high\nofficer. I\u2019m a major there.\u201d He said, \u201cYou are the first Jew I know had such a good time in the\nArmy like you have. Like you had.\u201d And I said to them good bye, and I left. And immediately\nthe next day I came to Krakow and I start to work because I had to fulfill this, this... later on he\nwas released from the hospital. He survived and he came to the office, but I still was working\nwith him. He couldn\u2019t work anymore. So I was working with him about a year and a half,\nsomething like this. And then I opened my own office.",
        "Q: But you said you didn\u2019t have such a good time in the... did you have a good time socially? Is\nthat what he meant? That you got along with other officers?\n7",
        "A: Oh yeah. I had a good time, well I got along. They were all, needed me because I was there\npracticing dentistry. After the first, first recruiting, six months, then later on I organize a clinic\nand I receive patients. So they had their families and they were coming to me and I had really a\ngood time. I came from the Army with some saved money, which the families of these officers\npaid to me for services. That was very, very, very little payments, but still I came with quite nice\nsaved money.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your other interview that you were involved with the underground army. The\nArmia Krajowa. How did you get involved with the army and when?",
        "A: In 1942, when we fled, went with the, on the Aryan papers, so-called. We came to a strange\nvillage there. And there the lady, which was the owner of the farm which we were given the\naddress from the priest to go. That was his sister-in-law. Where I was there on this farm, there\nthe Armia Krajowa started to organize herself. And we came there, and I went there as a refuge,\nrefugee from the occupied territory, German-occupied territory which occupied Poland from\nPoznan. I said I am from Poznan, and I am hiding away because I was a Polish officer and I am\nhiding from the German Army. So when they became knowledge, they turned to me and maybe\nI will join them. And I said, \u201cWell I cannot be a fighter to go and, with your fighting.\u201d I went\nwith them sometimes. But I organized a sanitary station, when some of them were wounded they\nbrought them to me and I gave them some bandages or some treatments, which I had a sanitary\nstation. And I also took care on the weapons which they had, and the magazine. They had some\nmagazine in hiding in the shelter. And they had some weapons there, which they organize\nsomehow. And I was taking, cleaning and taking care of it. And that was my function, I was\ngoing there and there, I was going close to every night I am going there and taking care of it.\nThere were some actions which I am participating, but I was never going in the first line to go to\nfight with the Germans. Never, ever.",
        "Q: Were you afraid at all or nervous that they would find, that they would check up on your story\nabout having been an officer in Poznan and find out about your identity?",
        "A: First of all, there was a case when somebody, the German has, in every village, in every town\nthey had... will you lay down? Lay down...",
        "Q: I have to...",
        "A: I will approach to you a little bit. They had their spies which are spying what happens to the\nPolish people there. What they are talking about and what they are doing. And some of them\ndenounced that there is some activity, that they have some activity. And they choose Easter,\n1943, yeah? 1943 they choose to go to make an action and to arrest these Polish people who are\nin the underground. They knew from this people which they send in this Volksdeutsche and they\ntook there ten people. Between them was the commandant of this base. His name was Bilig\n(ph), Bilig (ph). He was a student of law, of the third year, second or third year. He was the\ncommandant of this unit there in this region. And there was other, there was a teacher and there\nwas several people. And one was liberated by the Germans. That was suspected that he was\ncollaborating with the Germans. They released him. The other nine were taken to Auschwitz.\nThis commandant was so beaten up that he couldn\u2019t survive. Because one of these people who\n8\nwas release, he saw him. That they took him from one room to other after hearings. They took\nhim. He was all blooding. He didn\u2019t survive. No one of them survived. So the commandant of\nthis part was the brother of this woman where we were working on this farm. His name was\nKostetski (ph). Max Kostetski (ph). And this lady, which we were there on this farm, she was a\nvery fine, noble person. She knew that we are Jewish. She knew because when we arrived there,\nthe brother of the priest was there, just there. And he was very angry. He said to the priest,\n\u201cWhat did you bring these Jews here? Why did you do it?\u201d And he run away very angry. And\nshe knew, but she was a very, very [phone rings] fine, noble person. And she tried to influence\nher brother. I am an officer and so forth. And she was helping us a lot with bread, with food,\neverywhere. Even when we later on, after the denunciation, we had to live in other place. She\nused to come to bring us bread and all kinds of things. She did help us. I think maybe fifty\npercent of surviving we had to thank her. She was very, very, very kind.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Oscietska (ph), Stanislawa Oscietska (ph). Her father was anti-Semite. Her husband was a\nterrible anti-Semite. And the priest was also an anti-Semite and still that was the priest who\nhelped us and gave us the paper.",
        "Q: What was anti-Semitic about him? Why do you say that?",
        "A: He was anti-Semite, but he was, in my opinion he was economic anti-Semite. However, he\ndidn\u2019t have a business. But in the church he was preaching the Polish people to support Polish\npeople, to buy at Polish people, but most of the businesses were Jewish. And therefore Jews\nwere calling all of this kind of expression, they were calling anti-Semite. That was economical\nanti-Semitism. They want to support their own people. I don\u2019t find it wrong. I don\u2019t find it\nwrong. I think he as a priest has an obligation to his people. How we didn\u2019t like it, how we\ndidn\u2019t want it, but still 1t did hurt us economically. But he, as a human being and as a priest, he\ntold us, \u201cI want to help you because it comes a bad time to you.\u201d So I cannot say he is a racist or\nhe is a political anti-Semite. He was economical anti-Semite. He was anti-Semite. We are very\nsensitive. We Jews are very sensitive, but we have the reason why to be sensitive after\nthousands of years of discrimination. But still, 1f you have a little bit brain and you want to\nunderstand human nature, you can find some objective reasons why some people are behaving\nso, and not like you would like they will behave. We would like to be taken care on us as the\nChosen People. But we are not the chosen, to take care on us. We are chosen because we have\nobligations. We choose to have the obligations. This is the chosen. We took the Ten\nCommandments, we took the Torah, we took everything, but we have to perform it. And if there\nis, you have to love your neighbor as yourself. You can never love like yourself, it is allegoric.\nBut you don\u2019t have to harm your neighbor. You have to behave. And that, which in many cases\nwe are missing. Even in the holy books we sometimes mention, \u201cWe are the Chosen People.\nYou can do to other people this and this and this. You can take interest by non-Jews. You can\ndo this, you can do this, but not to your brothers.\u201d And that was a segregation which was in the\n9\nTorah. There is segregation which we choose to make the segregation. This is the Chosen\nPeople, not only in the positive sense, a lot of things is negative. And therefore a lot of people\nwho are open-minded, they are taking the teachings of our fathers, not strictly verbally. You\nmake some selection. You have some humanitarian obligations as a human being, not blind to\nfollow scriptures, but you have to find a way how to live with people, how to respect other\npeople. Which is very, very important. How do you respect others, so others will respect you?\nAnd this is my conviction which I came after so many years of life and so many readings and\nstudying of all, all this which is written in the Jewish and in the non-Jewish books and teachings.\nWell it\u2019s not a... if you know , introduction, but I mean you have to know to whom\nyou are speaking. I think maybe sometimes I am going out of the framework which this has in\nmind, but I still am open-minded of everything what happens around.",
        "Q: Yeah, I think it\u2019s valuable for the listeners to know who, who you are, what your beliefs are and\nwhere you\u2019re coming from and how you developed those beliefs. So, but also I wanted to find\nout, just make little bit clearer the chronology and the geography of what happened from the\nyears 1940 through 1944 or so. You were, you were, you told the story in the first interview\nabout how you went away to the Russian front. You tried to join the Army, you kind of got\ncaught underneath the Russian occupation and then you made your way back to your home\nvillage of Brzeznica? Is that right? And then I\u2019m a little bit confused. You mentioned that you\nwere working in an S, were you working in an SS camp? Was it a concentration camp for Jews\nthat you were working in? Okay, what was the name of the camp?",
        "A: Pustkow.",
        "Q: Pustkow. And you were interned there as a prisoner?",
        "A: No, never. That was one of the miracles of this war maybe. There were no many Jews who are\nallowed to go in the camp and to leave the camp. And that was, by some miracle, maybe the\nreason was the German discipline, which they followed the orders of the Commandants, of the\nFuhrers. When I came to this camp, I volunteered. That was a working camp and therefore I\nwas put into this camp as a dentist. There was no big dentistry and there was no big medicine,\nbut still there was three medical doctors and there was rooms with beds, which in the beginning,\nwhich people when they got sick, even beaten when they were, they could come to the doctor.\nAnd they get care, they get care. In the beginning, even some times they were released from this\nto go to the town, to the little shtetl close to Debica there. There was other assignment to other\nworks. But that was already not in their competence. In the beginning, how strange it would be,\nthere was a Colonel, SS, who was the head of this health services there, Obersturmbanfuhrer (ph)\nSchumacher was his name. And then, but he was maybe for two or three weeks and started only,\nthat was only in \u201840. That was not yet nothing. That was the first beginning. And therefore the\nJews were slowly getting in circulating. They took him so easy, they took him so by easy. They\nwere voluntary, then later by force and later on by annihilation. They were going by themselves.\nThat was the system. And then after two or three weeks, he left. But that was an order officer.\nA lieutenant officer.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n10\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: Tape two, side A. I\u2019m sorry, will you repeat what you just said?",
        "A: The Jewish doctors, they were the first. But if there were some people unable to work, they\ncouldn\u2019t release them. It has to sign, the SS doctor has to sign. And that what he was doing\nanother four weeks. But later on, they left it to the Jews, but the situation became worse. There\nwas no releasing. Treating and to work, treating and to work, no release anymore. In this time I\ncame to... when I organized this little dental clinic there, so called clinic, everything was\nprovisional.",
        "Q: When was it that you organized that clinic?",
        "A: In 1940 already. The end of 1940 I organized it there. And what could I do? If somebody has\ntoothache, I could help, or to make an extraction, to pull out a tooth. And that was the things.\nThere was no other things, no fillings. I had to make fillings only when an SS man didn\u2019t want\nto go to the SS. They were not allowed to go to a Jewish dentist, not to a Polish even, nor to a\nGerman. They had to go to an SS. But they knew that they will have a special treatment at the\nJewish dentist, so some of them came. And that was a very difficult task, because I didn\u2019t have,\nI didn\u2019t have this equipment, which the German have. The German has the most modern and the\nmost equipment. The SS had the most modern. And there was a lot of cases,\nwhich I couldn\u2019t treat them at all, and I send them to go there. But they were insisting, they were\ninsisting. And so in beginning, that was about a year. I had an ID, SS ID, that I could come to\nthe camp and I left. The bus was standing, I show only the ID and I left. In the beginning the\ndoctors were also leaving, living in Debica. And coming only to work there.",
        "Q: The Jewish doctors?",
        "A: The Jewish doctors, yeah. And even some of the workers were allowed to go Saturday and\nSunday for a day home, but they have to come back. If they didn\u2019t come back, they brought\nthem by force and that was a terrible thing then. So, after a year approximately, there was an\norder to take the ID\u2019s, SS ID\u2019s from all the Jews. But I think, I am not sure, because I was there\na volunteer, there was an order of the Commandant of this camp, of the head, Gillar (ph) SS\nOberfiihrer, who gave, day order, which he gives to the soldiers every day orders. He said, \u201cThe\nJewish dentist can come to the camp whenever he wants. And every time when he comes to the\npost they will give him a post who bring him in the camp and when he is finished, he will come\nto pick him up and take him out from the camp.\u201d That was unbelievable. That was\nunbelievable.",
        "Q: Did that happen because he had a special fondness for you?",
        "A: Because it was in the order. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I cannot comprehend it until today. I\ncannot understand it why.",
        "Q: Did you know him personally?\n11",
        "A: No. No. I knew the Commandant, the head of the... Ill tell you, I mentioned before, the\nGermans were strict in their orders. I was a volunteer, and I was assigned by the working office,\nthe special working office, which gave the contingent for the camp, for the people. Bring them\nand give them to different works. And because of they gave me this job, I didn\u2019t belong to the\nSS, I belong all the time to the working office. And the head of this working office was a\nGerman, he became German. He was a German from origin. But he was Polish all the time.\nOnly when the Germans came in, he became a German. And he was an officer in the Polish\nArmy with a German name. Eilmiss (ph) was his name, Jule Eilmiss (ph). And he was very\ngood to me. I was very good to him. I gave him from time to time, I gave him all kind of bribes.\nAnd maybe they respect because I was affiliated to this, maybe this was the reason that I didn\u2019t\nbelong to the SS, I belong to the working. And that was the reason. And when I came to this\npost and I said, \u201cI am the Jewish dentist. I need to go to the camp, please give me company.\u201d\nAnd they give me an SS man, who brought me to the camp. By the entrance to the camp there\nwas another SS man, but he respected this SS man, he gave me over to him. He opened the gate\nand let me in. And when I was ready, I went to the office and I said, \u201cI want to go out.\u201d They\ncall to the camp, to the post, and the postman came and take me out from there. So, this is,\neverything is miraculous. Well, it is miracle that I am alive and that Iam here. But that was\nsomething which was really extraordinary. I didn\u2019t hear for a similar case in all my experience\nof camps and Jewish labor.",
        "Q: Were you treating Jewish patients only or were there other prisoners there, who were non-\nJewish? I mean political prisoners or something, who you were treating?",
        "A: My treating was only Jews. There was close to it a Polish camp for political Polish prisoners, but\nI didn\u2019t go in there and they couldn\u2019t come here. They brought in, once they brought in two\nPolish prisoners, too, which I had to give them some treatment. But the SS Commandant sit\ndown and took my treatment and the second Schaffner (ph) of the camp took my treatment. And\nother SS people came in my private practice home. Because I make in the house where I live\nlike this Polish peasants, I make also a little clinic that what gives me my income. A barter\nbusiness, people brought me food and I treated them. And so some of these SS people came in\nand they brought me also some tea, some coffee, because it was not on the market, even black\nmarket was not to get it. But the SS had everything. And they came in there, most of these SS\npeople which were, plus they knew me, because I was going into the camp, out and in, and out\nand in, so I was really tolerated in this place like persona grata.",
        "Q: Okay, so you were doing that until 1942, when the area was evacuated and the Jews were\nordered to the ghetto?",
        "A: The Jews were evacuated earlier. The only Jewish family was my family which allowed, which\nthe Kreishofman (ph) allowed them to stay there. They allowed only me, but because the Polish\nofficer didn\u2019t understand German, so I take this opportunity and I left all my family there in this\nvillage. But there came the Final Solution and they want, nobody could, no Jew could be free.\nSo I would have to go to the camp. My wife, Fryda, had to go with all the family together to the\nghetto. From there they went to annihilation, as you know. Some of them went to the camp, to\nother camps, the brothers, my brothers. My three brothers came to other camps.\n12",
        "Q: So your, at that point your family, did they all go to the ghetto in Ropcezyce?",
        "A: Ropezyce and from Ropczyce they send them immediately to Senczyczow (ph), which was the\nnext little town. And from there, about two weeks, they send them all to annihilation. I don\u2019t\nknow exactly until now. I think to Treblinka. I guess they went to Treblinka, all of them.\nExcept my brothers which went to the other camp, to Rzeszow, from Rzeszow to Mielec. From\nMielec there was the factory of airplanes, Hermann Goring Werke. And they were there. And\nthere my oldest brother was killed there by the Germans. And these two brothers survived. And\nthey were taken from there to Germany and they make all the marches and all the way through.\nAnd they survived in Germany.",
        "Q: And your Polish, was your Polish good enough that you could pass well without worrying about\nlanguage problems as a Pole?",
        "A: My Polish was better than all the Polish Polish. Our Polish was exceptional, very good.\nOtherwise the priests wouldn\u2019t give us papers. That was the basic things, appearance and\nlanguage, that was the things which was the most important. And there was no, any blemish in\nmy language and so till today the Polish people who come here and we are friends, Polish\npeople. They say our Polish is immaculate.",
        "Q: Did you have any, Fryda was talking in the interview that we did with her a little earlier today,\nshe was talking about some of the challenges of being in church and having to adopt this\npersona, where you had to, everything had to be just right. Do you remember any trouble that\nyou had with that?",
        "A: Not at all. First of all, I adopted it very easy because living in a village, you are involved in the\npeasant\u2019s life. You want, you don\u2019t want, you don\u2019t have the time even, but still. And so I knew\nabout the habits and about everything how the Poles live. And we were living, even being\nOrthodox, my father was a very, very, very accepted in the community, in the peasant\ncommunity. They respected him very well and they came and they lived together. And my\nfather being an Orthodox Jew with you have seen. And he spoke immaculate\nPolish very well and so did all my family. And interesting enough, the children all were\nspeaking Polish home, only when father wasn\u2019t there. When father was in field, because we had\na farm, so my father was usually, in the summer time always in the field. As you know ina\nvillage there is always work, never endless, endless work. When my father came, approaching\nthe house, Yiddish, immediately Yiddish we have to speak at home, only Yiddish.",
        "Q: But your family was unusual then. I mean, I think 1t was common for Polish Jewish families to\nbe pretty segregated and to just associate with other Jews. But your family was much more\nintegrated it sounds like.",
        "A: Well the question of integration was more common in the shtetl, where there were around Jews.\nWe didn\u2019t have, our closest Jew was living a mile from us. A mile in Poland is like hundred\nmiles here. Distances are different. And the other Jews were coming to us to study religious\nthings by the teacher which we have in our house. And they were really poor Jews, poor Jews.\nIt is difficult to describe. Well, in the last years, the situation improve. But I remember as a\n13\nchild I came in the house of one of the oldest citizens in this village that has Haskila Ascheim\n(ph). And he had two sons... three sons, one went to the Austrian Army and later on to the\nPolish Army, because it was just a change from Polish liberalization. It was a widow with five\nchildren. Of course, the sons came to learn in our house. Not too much, not too much, but the\nbasic prayers, the basic prayers they learned. The other son had also five children and they were\nvery, very talented children, very talented children, but they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to\nschool, only to the community school, I mean to the elementary school. But they were\n, they studied by themselves. And this two sons became even writers and the\nlawyer in the village there. And one of the sons became a dentist. And the daughter married.\nNot that this is the point. The point is that this three sons with their families, in the beginning\nthere was here two children, here one child, the other one also two children. They were living in\none house, where there was only three rooms. Of course no bathroom, nothing like this. In\naddition, in the big hall, this old Jew had a pub. He was selling alcohol to the Polish people were\ncoming, drinking there. Everything in this one house. Later on they move on, they somehow\norganize them, their living. And they have their own houses. No one survived, as far as I know,\nof all these families. No one. Of all these villagers, no one survived. Only one son and a son-\nin-law went to America. But I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not more alive and I don\u2019t know if he had family. I\ndon\u2019t know. One grandson came also to America with a very tricky way. His father, who was\nalready in America, sent him a girl from the United States, which he married there, so he could\ntravel to America. But he\u2019s not alive. He died. He was a sick boy. Lyman (ph) was his name.\nNo one of all this family is around that I know, who survived.",
        "Q: You went from, okay, so in 1942 you went to the Priest\u2019s sister. I\u2019m forgetting the name of the\ntown.",
        "A: Jurkow (ph). Jurkow, by Szczow (ph).",
        "Q: And that was near the time when you got involved with the AK?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did you, we didn\u2019t get to just talk a little bit more about your experiences in the AK. Did you\nhave any, do you want to tell us a little bit about that?",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you. Thanks to this, my involvement in the AK, I could find a place after I had to\nescape because of the Gestapo which came. And thanks....the right place...",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s going to, so I'll... you don\u2019t have to hold it.",
        "A: Oh, and your hand. I have to support your hand.",
        "Q: I guess... sometimes I have to lift up my hand.",
        "A: Therefore I wanted to take from you. I understand it. I give you support.",
        "Q: Tell me when you get tired.\n14",
        "A: Yeah, you'll feel it. [Laughing. ]",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: Thanks to my involvement in the AK, I could find a place when I had to escape when the\nGestapo came to pick us up. That was the positive thing what I have of it. Well, I didn\u2019t\nexperience too many fights except one when it was already 1944, when our unit was affiliated to\na other unit and together we make an attack on a police station, German-Polish police station and\nthe dam of Roznow (ph). Roznow (ph), that was a big dam which they built on the Danube\nRiver, not Danube, but Dunajec river. That was a big dam. There was a little one later of in\nSzczow where in the beginning the Jews built it. But that was only in 1941, \u201842. But later on\nthey took away all the Jews in other camps. I don\u2019t know what they did to them. I don\u2019t know.\nAnd there was then a fight, which was quite a real fight with this police, but the Polish police\nhand over herself and the Germans, some escaped, some were killed. And that was the source\nwhere the AK gets more weapons there, from there. No, Iam not. You can hold it. I have here\nsupport. That was really when I, by my walking in the nights to the base where we have the\nweapons there, I met some of the AK men, which usually no AK men knew more than other two.\nThat was a conspiracy. And interesting enough, the main active AK man in our unit, which was\nreally an active guy, he was doing by himself a lot of things, he was a released criminal prisoner\nfrom Polish prison. And from him I got also for myself a gun, which I had one, but I didn\u2019t have\nenough ammunition for it. And he was the one who give me another gun and then I have some\nmore ammunition, some more for security. [Phone rings.] I didn\u2019t use it because I didn\u2019t need it,\nbut I was ready in case I will need it. I had a grenade and I had a weapon, I wouldn\u2019t go into\nprison voluntarily. I will kill some Germans and myself, that was my preparation to do.\nOtherwise I didn\u2019t have anything special.",
        "Q: Did you have any, I know that it was a challenge, the AK has a reputation for being very anti-\nSemitic. Did you have any trouble or close calls with that? With anybody finding out you were\nJewish?",
        "A: The only thing which I know, which came through me in the place where I was living, in the\nneighboring village was another unit of AK and there was a commandant, and all the orders who\ncame from the main office were passing from one unit to the other. And through me was passing\nfrom this unit, through me to my unit. And that was already in 1944, by the end of 1944. I\nusually tried to know what happens because I didn\u2019t have a radio. I was relying on the news\nwhich I got from the acquaintance, what they get to me. But from this, from this orders who\ncame, I found some orders what happens at the front. There was always messages what is to do\nand so forth. And the last message which I got, I opened it too. Then I close it and I send it\nfarther. There was a message, the Russians are approaching, not to hand over, not to give them\nover our units. And before they come in to clean up all the rest of the units of the people which\nare, which you will find in the forests, whether it is Russian partisans or other kind. It didn\u2019t\nmention exactly Jews, but who was there in the forest? That was the only thing which I have\npersonally met. From person to person, I didn\u2019t met, only I say the other two AK men and they\ndidn\u2019t know that Iam Jewish. They didn\u2019t know. And they, we never spoke about it.\n15",
        "Q: Were you afraid at all during that time?",
        "A: Well that is difficult to say, afraid. But you are always watching what you are saying, what you\nare doing, not to be different. You have to drink alcohol, the moonshine like they are and to do\neverything like they are doing when they come together. Even if you don\u2019t know them, but you\nhave to go on the way like this. And if they are cursing, you have to curse, if 1t is damn, or\nanother. You have to be always, not try to be different, not try to be different, that\u2019s the main\npoint what you have to do. Scared? Of course, you are always scared. You know, when I was\nwatching and going walking in the night from one village to the other, if I heard a frog jumping,\nmy ears were so sensitive, I heared it. Because I want to know what happens around me, to be\nalways prepared and always the hand on the gun. And I didn\u2019t continue to go until I found out\nwhat is this noise, if it is not people. I find the frog and then I continue to go. That\u2019s it.",
        "Q: How did you meet Frantiszek Muschau, who you talked about in your other interview?",
        "A: He was working on this farm...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\n16\nTape 2, Side B",
        "Q: So you were working together, and you got him involved eventually in the AK?",
        "A: I recommended to my commandant, I recommended my commandant to accept him. I also\naccepted the other one, who became the priest, the anti-Semite, which was. And this Muschau\nwas a very nice man, very nice man. And he was not like the common peasant. He was already\nmore civilized because he was working in France as a miner, several years. And he came up\nfrom France. He brought some furniture from France. And he was already more progressive.\nAnd we exchanged different opinions about the situation, the political situation. About the\nGermans, about the Russians, so forth. We were politicizing. He was inviting me in his home.\nWe are drinking and eating there. And he invite the neighbor. He has a neighbor there, one\nKilbasa (ph), who came also and they want to hear what happens in the world. And I have also\nsome news from my fellow man. So they accepted all the news from me as an intelligent Polish\nofficer and Polish patriot, of course. And that was always, with the alcohol, with moonshine. I\ndrank moonshine in my life, maybe I could make a bath in it and swim.",
        "Q: Was that hard to get used to? Drinking that much without slipping when you were drunk? I\nmean, letting something slip?",
        "A: I never allowed to be drunk. I always want to have my clear mind, because that was the most\ndangerous thing, to lose your mind. To be drunk. So when I felt, I run it out somewhere, I make\nlike I am drinking another one, another one, but I didn\u2019t drink it. But still it was quite a bit. I\nam happy that I could tolerate it as much as I could.",
        "Q: What happened towards the end of the war? Did you have, you had information about what was\nhappening through your involvement with the AK that you knew where the Russian front was\nand whether they were advancing and so forth?",
        "A: Well you could hear. First of all, there was a situation about four months, more than four\nmonths. The Russians stopped on the river, they didn\u2019t cross the river Vistula to help the Polish\nresistance, the Uprising in Poland for political reasons. They want the Poles to be annihilated by\nthe Germans and then will go and kill the Germans. That was a very courageous thing to make\nfrom the Russian side. But that was a very, very bad thing instead to help to fight the Germans.\nThe Germans killed a lot of Polish people. And of course, a lot between them the Jewish, which\nwere fighting with the Poles, from the rest which remained there between the Poles. And we\nhave all the news about the uprisings. There was, in the bunker where the commandant, ours,\nwas sitting, they had a radio, which they are listening to Radio London, from London, BBC, they\nhave all the news and the movements of the Russian Army. And I knew in one day they brought\nto me, two English pilots, who escaped from the camp, from the German camp, and I had to\ntransport them to the Russians, because the United States had air bases in Russia. Because the\nUnited States were already allies with the Russians. And I was already, I said already good bye\nto Fryda and I was already on the way to go. But in the meantime when they came to the next\nbase they told me not to go farther because the field are mined everywhere. I will not be able to\ncross. So I left them at this Polish unit there AK where I brought them there and I came back to\nFryda there. And we are waiting the other four months and then you didn\u2019t need the knowledge,\n17\nyou heared the bombardment with the Russians started on the river there, from a distance to\nbombard artillery. And then they started to move. And that was it. And so we became so-called\nliberated.",
        "Q: One second before we go on, I just want to make sure I understand your... So, you were\ninvolved with the AK, but you were also working on a farm? Is that right? So how did you?\nWhen did you?",
        "A: In the night.",
        "Q: Oh, at night time you worked with the AK?",
        "A: The AK didn\u2019t work in the day. They were always working 1n the nights.",
        "Q: Were you, you weren\u2019t, were you getting any sleep?",
        "A: Oh well I came, it wasn\u2019t until late at night. It was till twelve, one o\u2019clock. And then in the day\nI was sleeping there. Where we had a shelter with Fryda there, over the pigs there. We had a\nshelter there and there we were sleeping. We had enough sleeping there. Enough sleeping.",
        "Q: Did the people who were sheltering you know that you were working...?",
        "A: Oh no. They knew that Iam AK, and that I am officer, but no, they are not suspicious that I am\nJewish. No, no, no. Because the son, which is studying for priest. He was by himself, he said, if\nI will catch a Jew, I will cut in pieces and they should salt on it. As I said, he was a very, very\nbad anti-Semite. His parents were not anti-Semites. They were very simple peasants. They\ndidn\u2019t understand and think about it. Well, they boarded Jews and they went to the shtetl, they\nhad their acquaintance with Jews. But of course they preferred, they loved the Polish and the\nCatholic. It 1s normal, it is normal. But they didn\u2019t hate especially the Jews. But the son, which\nwas already studying priesthood and they knew already, they told him already, at this time they\nwere still teaching that the Jews killed Jesus and so forth. So, this young priest, no wonder that\nhe hated Jews. That was indoctrinated.",
        "Q: So you mentioned the \u201cso-called\u201d liberation. Did you feel in any way as if you were free?",
        "A: It was a very, very, very mixed feeling. On one side you felt the Russians are coming, you will\nnot be more in danger as a Pole, but as a Jew, you continue to be in danger. And then came the\nreality. You find out what happened. Because until now, you heared only, they killed here, they\nkilled here, they killed here. But the disaster so big, you realized only slowly when you were\nliberated. When you came to the big city, Krakow, which has before the war, in the war even, in\nthe beginning, ninety thousand Jews and you barely find five or six people which are Jews. That\nwas a trauma which you couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t hand it. You were, and you were asking by\nyourself, why me? Why didn\u2019t Anna do what I did? You start to analyze and to understand and\nthose are things that you cannot understand until today. Because there were wiser people than\nme, speaking Polish better than me or the same like me, having connection with people. Why\ndidn\u2019t they survive? Why didn\u2019t they choose our way? Was it right we did? And what is the\n18\nrole we have to play by being alive? Try to organize a Jewish life, or forget about it? No Jews,\nno Jewish life. You are Polish. Go on, be a Pole. And that\u2019s what many Jews do it, did it. And\nthere are until today Jews which are living as Poles. They said, \u201cForget about it.\u201d But we\ncouldn\u2019t do it. Our roots are too strong. I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know what to do. We didn\u2019t\nknow what to do. We were poor like mices. We had to look, to find something to eat, not to\nspeak about finding a way to organize your life, to start to be a human being. You are out of it,\nyou are no human anymore. You start to realize you live surrounded in animosity. And you\nlook for some Jews. And I found some. I remember the first night we didn\u2019t have where to go.\nNo home. But somehow we met somebody. I don\u2019t remember. I think I knew these people or\nrecognize them as Jews. And I did ask him, \u201cWho else is here?\u2019\u201d\u2019 He said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nAnd I went with him, or with her better. And we came in a dark room and there were already\nseveral Jewish people, survivors from all kinds of surviving. And we sit there in this room, in\nthis dark room and started to sing Jewish songs, Yiddish songs, very nostalgical Jewish songs.\nAll the Yiddish songs were sad, all were sad. But in this moment, they were healing. They were\nlike Balsam on a wound. Remembrance for a moment, your heritage. And we passed this night,\nI don\u2019t remember, on songs and somehow sleeping sitting on a broken couch. All together there\nwere maybe six, seven people. And each one with his song, not with story. We didn\u2019t talk yet\nabout story. We, somehow, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. Is it shame or 1s it... I don\u2019t know.\nBut we are here. We left everything behind and we are sitting here. Nostalgia, remembering\nYiddish songs. Don\u2019t think even what to do, where to go farther. But we woke up in the\nmorning, woke up. We didn\u2019t take our work clothes. We were in the clothes which we had,\nthese poor clothes. We find out from one of them that one of my friends survived. Where is he?\nWho 1s it? He was before the war, he was a lady beautician parlor. Father was a barber, and he\nhad a nice sister. And I used to come to their house before the war. And he survived on papers.\nBut he was already in the Russian intelligence. Polish uniform, the Russian intelligence. And\nsomehow I met him. I don\u2019t remember exactly how. And I asked him, \u201cWhat is to do. Where to\ngo? I don\u2019t have a house. I don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d He said, \u201cI got back my apartment.\u201d\nThere are two bedrooms, a kitchen on the third floor in the Jewish section.\nBut he says, \u201cYou can go there. And somehow we will find there some way to sleep.\u201d But there\nwere already some people in, which survived Auschwitz. That was a girl, a boy, and another\ngirl. And then came other people. I don\u2019t know who this were. We all were there, but we didn\u2019t\nhave a bed to sleep. We slept on the floor. And I decided, we decided to look around, and we\nwent to my village. To this older woman, who took us on. And she fed us, she gave us to eat.\nAnd we left in their house some of our clothes, some of our furnishes. And she was already, she,\nnot her son, who lived nearby... because my mother, my grandmother, my brother\u2019s sister lived\nin her house and I lived in the son\u2019s house. There I make a little clinic there in his house. And\nwe went there to sleep in the night in his house. In the night, somebody was knocking at the\ndoor and the window. And there\u2019s, in Russian, \u201cKroy (ph)! Open! You have here Jews!\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t have Jews. They are Polish people like you, like we.\u201d They came in. He opened,\nbecause this was soldiers which were in the camp, where there was once a camp. There was a\nfield hospital for wounded Russian soldiers. And this were wounded soldiers which were there\nin this, but they were strong enough to go in between the Poles and to make connections with\nthem. And I understand, I am not sure, I am ninety-nine percent sure. They went to the rich\nPoles where we left a lot of things and he told them to go there, the Jews came here. You have to\nkill them, very simple. And for them to kill a Jew is like kill a German. They like a soldier,\nespecially a wounded soldier, a front soldier. And they came in and said, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d\n19\nAnd I understand Ukrainian, too, because in the Polish Army where I served there were mostly\nUkrainians there. I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no Jews here.\u201d \u201cWho are you?\u201d We had the papers. Said,\n\u201cWe are here, only sleeping here. We are Polish.\u201d Well, okay, they left. They went to the house\nof the mother, the mother\u2019s house and they the same. \u201cWhere are the Jews here?\u201d \u201cThere are no\nJews.\u201d They gave some shots in the air and they left. In the morning we said to the son of our,\nwe told him to help us to move. We want to move back to Krakow. But there was no\ncommunication, there was no train. And I want to take some of this furniture to have something\nto sleep. So, he took the horse of his mother and the other horse from a neighbor and a wagon\nand we started to move to Krakow. That is about sixty miles from, hundred kilometers, hundred\nten kilometers, something like this.",
        "Q: What had happened to your house in Brzeznica?",
        "A: Our house was burned.",
        "Q: When did that happen?",
        "A: It was burned. It happens when we were there still. After we left, close to the house there was a\nrailway and a spark of this coal fire fell on the house there and it burned. So, there were not\nhouse. And these Polish people, who used to live in the house, took over our house. He was\nliving in the barn which was close to it. There was a horse barn and coal barn and he was living\nthere. So for us he wasn\u2019t moving out and I didn\u2019t want him and I didn\u2019t want to be there. So\nwe Started the way to go. And we didn\u2019t want to go with the main road because there still the\nRussian Army was moving. And they were taking the horses from the Polish people for their\nuse.",
        "Q: About when was this? Do you know the approximate date?",
        "A: It was 22\u2122) no 25\" of January, 1945, after the Russians came in. We start there the way to\nKrakow. It is not describable the conditions. We had to take food for the horses first because\nyou couldn\u2019t buy this. Nobody would sell it. The money didn\u2019t have any value anymore. And\nthe horses, if you don\u2019t feed them, they will not go. And you have to have the food on the way\nback, too. So the most of the wagon was food. And we took also some of the furniture which\nwe left there and some of clothings we left there, also. They took it out from the ground, they\ndig it out. And they give us back everything, everything. They were very honest people. On the\nway my wife was more dead than alive. She was fainting and I had to do, to work on her. And\nby the way we were going around way, it was a longer way but more secure. ;\nwhere the army wasn\u2019t going. I knew the Polish geography very well. I know how I will get to\nKrakow by longer, around ways. We came to an ort (ph), which was called Zakroczym. First of\nall we passed a place which is called Tochow (ph). At Tochow there used to live a sister of my\nmother, with her family. Her husband, her daughter with her husband. I don\u2019t know how many\nchildren she had in the meantime. And the sons all run away to Russia, and they survived in\nRussia. The husband too, the old husband, too. But he died in Siberia, in Russia. They all were\nsent to Siberia to Infada (ph), to Sever (ph), to Jakutz (ph), or Jakutzia (ph). That was where\nthey banished all the criminals in the older country revolutions there. With all the history there,\nthere were trees which ten people have to surround it. Such a tree, such forest. And they\n20\nbrought them there and they said to them, \u201cHere you have to live.\u201d No houses. Their houses\nwere from snow, and their windows were from ice. And they had to work there, but all right\nthat\u2019s about them. That\u2019s another story. But I came to this Tochow. And I did ask the Polish\npeople there because no Jew was there, \u201cWhat happens?\u201d They said, \u201cAll were killed and some\nremained they were sent to the ghetto at Tarnow.\u201d That was the end. No one Jew was there. No\none Jew. So I continued to the next shtetl which was Zakroczym. And of course we have to feed\nthe horses. And we want to come down to move a little bit like I say to you, to try if we can go.\nWe were sitting on the wagon all the time. And this poor Polish guy, this Soltys Stanislaw was\nwith us, he was the foreman. And while we wanted to come down, Fryda fell down on the\nground, fainted again. I save her. I put her on the ground laying down, make some exercises\nwith her. Put her on the wagon back, she faint again several times. And when we fed the horses,\nwe went to continue to go. But the night approach and in the night you couldn\u2019t, you are not\nallowed because it is curfew. The Russians didn\u2019t joke. Whom they found on the street they\nkilled. So, I went to the first Polish house there where there was a little bit space...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n21\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: Our third tape, so this 1s tape number three, side A. So there came, a woman came out of the\nhouse?",
        "A: And she asked me what do I want? Said, \u201cWe have to go to sleep, to take in.\u201d And I took Fryda\nfrom the wagon and I tried to put her in and the woman said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell we have to warm her up a little bit, because she is sick.\u201d And she looked at her and said,\n\u201cWell what do you think? She is dead already. Better one to put in the grave, like she is\nlooking.\u201d But I took, outside I found a brick, an old brick. I put it, make a fire and warm up the\nbrick and I warm up a little bit. And so at this house, on the floor, we slept through until the\nmorning. In the morning we start to go, and we went and we came to Krakow. We went to this\nhouse of our friend there and we put what we have, these little furnishes on the dirt floor. This\nguy helped us, Stanislaw Soltys helped us. And he went back with the horses, back to his home,\nhe had to give back the horse to the neighbor. That was sacrificing. I don\u2019t know how he did it\nor why he did it. It was not human, that was angel work. In this time to go back, to endanger the\nhorses, which is all what the people have, a horse, a cart, but he did it. And she gave us a little\nproducts, half a bread, which was the big peasant breads, and some beans, some barley, and we\u2019 Il\nhave something to cook and to eat. That was our food at the beginning. And so we are being\nthere with all this people around us, other people living there. And Fryda went to the house,\nwhich was their house before the war, their apartment. And there was the janitor of the house,\nwhich was the janitor before the war. He was a carpenter working in their furniture store. A\ndirty, drunk man. And she said to him, \u201cMaybe there will come some post here on this address.\nWe are here living...\u201d and she gave the address where we are living. And he, \u201cAnd what will be\nif I bring you a post from your father?\u201d And she says, \u201cWell, you will get a hug and a kiss.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cAll right.\u201d A few days later he came with a card, post card from Auschwitz. And he said,\n\u201cPana Fryda (ph), Miss Fryda, I get a kiss.\u201d And she give him a kiss and a hug. \u201cI got post card\nfrom your father.\u201d And we have this post card. You saw it I guess. And he is sick and he asks\nto come to pick him up. In the meantime, I met another acquaintance of me. He had a dental\noffice, quite a primitive office, but a dental office in an apartment which wasn\u2019t his. It did\nbelong to a Jewish woman before the war. She was even the owner of the house. And she and\nher daughter survived. But in this moment, she wasn\u2019t there yet. She was in a camp somewhere.\nAnd I met him and I said to him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell I have here a dental\noffice. But I\u2019m leaving this office. I want to sell it because I am leaving to the once German\nterritory. There I will organize a modern dental office, an apartment and I will be living there.\u201d\nHe married, he survived as a partisan. He married a Polish, Gentile woman. And he lived\ntogether with her. I guess he had some children with her already. But he was, he was a partisan\nin the Socialistic, not in the AK, in the AL, that was Armia Ludowa. That was the Volks party.\nAnd they were more lenient to the Jews. And he was a good fighter. He was a strong guy and he\nwas really fighting there, in this army. And he said, \u201cMy party will help me to organize there.\u201d I\nsaid to him, \u201cSell me your office here, for a begin, it will be good for me.\u201d He said, \u201cI will not\nsell you. I will rent it to you because maybe I don\u2019t find nothing there. I will come back.\u201d Said,\nOkay. I can\u2019t give you nothing. I don\u2019t have nothing. But for the first money what I will make\nas a dentist I will send it to you somehow.\u201d And I start to organize a practice. And I had first of\nall, aroom to sleep, a nice room to sleep with a bed, with a couch, quite a nice room and a nice\nkitchen. And that was for the moment a wonderful solution. But I started to think, \u201cIf he did it,\n22\nmaybe I can do the same. I will go to the German occupied, German-Polish occupied territories,\nPoland occupies German territories. And there were a lot of dentists and dentist equipment and I\nwill organize my clinic there. And to live there.\u201d And I went there, but I didn\u2019t find nothing\nwhich I would like. So I left Fryda there. We met there another guy, a survivor who was already\nworking for the Polish security, in the Polish security. He wrote a book about it. He lives here\nin the United States. He became a very rich guy here. And he became an officer. He survived\nin his village there. However they were trying to kill him from the AK, too. But he survived\nsomehow. And he was in this part which became occupied by the Russians first, the first month\nthere. And the Polish units there sent him to an officer\u2019s school and he became an officer 1n the\nPolish security. And then when the Russians moved, he moved with them. He came to Krakow.\nAnd he make a lot of, find a lot of Polish people whom, whom he gave over to, handed over to\nthe Polish security. But while the Russians occupied the German part, they sent him to Wroclaw\nas an officer there of their security. And then they send him to Lidnice, Lidnitz, where we were.\nAnd where I was looking for some dental equipment, he was working 1n his job to look for\nGermans. And we met. And we make a recognition as a Jew and he as a Jew. We didn\u2019t talk\ntoo much about it. He said, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I said, \u201cYou can help me to find some...\u201d\nHe said, he\u2019 Il try.",
        "Q: How did you, let me just interrupt briefly. How did you make that recognition? Was there some\nspecial way?",
        "A: Well, I recognize him as a Jew. His name was Polish, Zalewski (ph). And when I met him, I\nsaid, \u201cZaleski, but what is your real name?\u201d And he was from Kolbuszowa, which was not far\nfrom my village, about twelve kilometer. That\u2019s about eight miles. It was quite close. And I\nknew people from Kolbuszowa. And he told me, \u201cMy name is Zalschitz (ph), Nafthali\nZalschitz.\u201d And he was called Tadek Zalewski, Tadeusz Zalewski (ph). But I left Fryda with\nhim, and I went back to Krakow to see how to organize life in Krakow. I found some instrument\nwhich I can use there. And when I came to Krakow, I found this, I have to go, well I mix up\nbecause I don\u2019t go chronological. Before we left I went to Auschwitz to take Father, her father\nfrom Auschwitz.",
        "Q: You went actually to the camp?",
        "A: It was no more camp there. [Phone rings.] It was liberated by the Russians. That was a card we\nhave that he was there.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So I went there with the Russian trucks, I went there with taking ammunition to the front. There\nwas still war, but Auschwitz was already liberated. And he was the one who remained in the\nhospital there because he couldn\u2019t go farther. And he said better, they ask to leave, but he said\nhe preferred to stay here to be burned and not to go. And they shoot all the other people who\nwent there.",
        "Q: Did you, before you, so this is around February 1945, right?\n23",
        "A: It\u2019s January, still January.",
        "Q: Okay, did you know, did you know what had happened at Auschwitz at that point?",
        "A: Well, I knew from Polish accounting, but when I came there I found everything. I found\neverything. And when I saw him, I had all the history. That was a man who was taller than me\nand he was fifty-six pounds, I guess. I took in a blanket a heap of bones. And I was waiting for\na truck to take him to Krakow. But that was before we left to the occupied territories there. And\nFryda took care of him, and he came to his quite normal. But that was already February when\nwe left for... even more later, maybe March already. It is difficult now to remember the dates\nexactly. So we left Father in this apartment where we lived. We left to him. And we went to\nlook for, find some existence there with the idea maybe we\u2019ll take him over there to us.",
        "Q: Can we go back? I know you already did go forward, but go back to the Auschwitz experience\nand what you... you mentioned you really discovered what had gone on when you were there.\nWhat did you experience?",
        "A: Not too much. All what Father-in-law told us. I didn\u2019t have the time and the courage to go to\nlook what happens around. But he had enough to recount his stories of what happens during the\ntime. But on the way back from this occupied territory to Krakow, I have a car accident. And I\nhave broken my leg, my hand here, and I was taken to the hospital instead to go home.\nSomehow I could let know Fryda that I am in the hospital. That was everything through people,\nwhich are communicating, commuting there and back. So, she came back. She decided to come\nback. She didn\u2019t have money, not even for to pay the Russians to give the vodka for commuting\nwith them. But while she was at this friend\u2019s house, he became our good friend, this officer, this\nTadek Zalewski. His wife, she was Jewish too, she survived also on Christian papers. She said,\n\u201cT can\u2019t give you anything money.\u201d She want to give her some jewelry, but Fryda didn\u2019t want to\ntake it. But while she was sleeping, she put in her bag a golden bracelet. And Fryda when she\ngot up, she said, \u201cWhat is this yet? I didn\u2019t have a bracelet.\u201d She said, \u201cTake it, you\u2019Il need it.\nTake it, youll need it. I don\u2019t need it now. Someday you\u2019ll pay me back.\u201d I don\u2019t remember if\nshe took it. I guess she took it and she came back to me, to the hospital. And she had to take\ncare of this poor father and of this poor husband. In the meantime, we got connection by mail\nwith a brother of her father, an uncle, Uncle Solomon in the United States. And when he heard\nthat his brother survived, that we survived, he open... in Krakow, an open account. \u201cHow much\nyou need, you can have and take.\u201d And there was the connection who gave us the possibility to\nsurvive further. But that was already a few months later, because mail didn\u2019t function so easy.",
        "Q: At that time were you really thinking that you wanted to stay in Poland permanently?",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t think so much about Poland. I didn\u2019t want to stay with the Russians. I knew the\nRussians before. Poland I wouldn\u2019t mind, even, to stay, because I had my roots there, you\nknow? With all minuses I thought I would be able to organize a good life in Poland, even I\nthought in my dreams, on our farm. I said, I will keep the farm. I'll keep a clinic there, help the\npeople. And having a nice living on the farm. I love the farm too. We have a big farm, a nice\nfarm. And it was the nicest farm in the village. I thought sometimes that will be okay. But\nwhen I thought about the Russians and the system of their, when they bring in, I would not have\n24\nthe farm and I would not have my freedom so I start to think to move from Poland somewhere.\nSomewhere, the nearest approach was to Belgium, where Fryda has a brother of her father. In\nthe beginning we want to go to Germany, because one of my brothers, who lives now in the\nUnited States, came to visit us in Poland. He couldn\u2019t take us. When he came only for two or\nthree days. And he saw our misery there and he tried to help us what he could. And he said,\n\u201cCome in Germany we have apartment. You\u2019ll make a living there for time being. Come there.\u201d\nAnd we found a way where they were repatriating German families from Poland to Germany.\nSo there was a woman, she came to our house. She was making all kind of businesses, a Jewish\nwoman from Krakow. And she had the connection how to organize, to join people who want to\ngo to Germany with the German repatriates. We left our apartment. We went to Katowice,\nwhich was on the border to Germany. But when we came there, we were there two days, there\nwas no transport going to Germany. They already, the last transport left. And you have to wait\nanother month or two and I couldn\u2019t wait in Katowice there, so we decided to go back to Krakow\nthere. And in Krakow we stayed there until, I guess it was August, I guess, when we find a\nconnection which somebody make passports with a visa to Costa Rica for five hundred dollar\neach passport. And the uncle from United States gave us the money and we paid thousand five\nhundred. But we could get a transit visa through Belgium, because there was no straight flights.\nThere was no flight at all. You have to go by train to Belgium. And from Belgium you could\nhave gone to a flyer, a ship to Costa Rica. But when we came to Belgium, we remained in\nBelgium. And we stayed in Belgium for five years.",
        "Q: Were you originally planning on making the entire trip to Costa Rica or was your intention to\njust stay in Belgium and not go any further?",
        "A: My intention was to stay in Belgium, but even in Belgium I didn\u2019t want to stay. 1948 when\nIsrael was declared independent state, I was doing everything possible to go to Israel. I said I\ndon\u2019t want... the uncle sent us papers, everything to go to the United States. He wanted to pay\nfor my studies here and to upkeep us until I make my diploma here, but I didn\u2019t want to go to the\nUnited States. I want to go home, because after all Iam Jewish. There we have a state. I don\u2019t\nwant anymore to be a stranger.",
        "Q: Did you ever consider making aliyah before Israel was a state and going illegally?",
        "A: To be candid, we in our villages, it\u2019s more my nephews, organized a Zionist organization. And I\nwas quasi a member of this organization. But my brother was an active member and he even\nmade ha-shorah (ph). He was a farmer and he wanted to go before the war. But my mother,\neven before the war, somehow she said, \u201cThere is no future in Poland for Jews, let us go to\nIsrael.\u201d It was not yet Israel, still Palestine. Said, \u201cYou are a farmer,\u201d she said to father, \u201cand\nthe farmers are well off there.\u201d It was another kind of farming there. \u201cWe will make somehow\nmoney here from our farm.\u201d We could make then, that was a lot of money for our farm, ten\nthousand dollars. With ten thousand dollars in Israel you could do a lot, you could do a lot. But\nmy father said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want.\u201d He was much older than my mother. My mother was young.\nWith so many children he said, \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be difficult and impossible to make existence\nthere.\u201d And he didn\u2019t want to leave Poland. He was orthodox Jew. He said, \u201cI will go to Israel\nwhen Messiah will come.\u201d No Zionists. And my brother was prepared to go, but then there\ncame the war and he couldn\u2019t. And so my nephews wanted to go and no one of them did it.\n25\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\n26\nTape 3, Side B",
        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s now May 30, 2000, and we\u2019re continuing our interview with Mr. Oscar Haber. And\nwhy don\u2019t we start by going back, you had talked on the last tape about the day of your\nliberation. And just to remind you, what you had talked about, we were, you talked about how\nafterwards you had met up with some other Jews and you were singing some old Yiddish songs.\nAnd then you described going back to your hometown and then back to Krakow. The thing that\nI wasn\u2019t sure about, that I didn\u2019t quite understand is, did you immediately leave the town where\nyou were after liberation? And do you remember saying good-bye to the family that you were\nstaying with?",
        "A: Well, the question of liberation is one of the most difficult time from all the past problems which\nwe had. We were, as I told you, living as Christians. And the liberation came. We couldn\u2019t\nenjoy our liberation or country. It was the greatest shock and the most difficult moment in our\nlives. That was the liberation. And especially if I want to put it in perspective, the differences\nbetween people who survived camps and people who lived on so-called Aryan papers was very\ndifferent. We have two things to overcome. The first 1s, which we had all the time, that was the\nfight for existence and how to survive, of course. And the next, when the liberation came was\nthe shock to find the reality. You don\u2019t have where to go. You couldn\u2019t find nobody you know,\nor anybody of your people. You suddenly find yourself, you cannot stay in the place where you\nwere. We were in a village, not ina town. We were ina village. And if I... realize it was a\nhostage village. They were not sympathetic to Jewish survivors. However I survived, not a Jew,\nbut suddenly I felt that Iam back a Jew. But I couldn\u2019t officially declare it. I had to stay on my\nAryan papers. And how to go and where to go? Because to go to my other village where I was\nborn there, I wasn\u2019t sure that I will be accepted. And I wasn\u2019t sure to go to Krakow, for\nexample, because I didn\u2019t have where to go. Even not where to sleep at night. And you don\u2019t\nhave money. And you don\u2019t have nothing because whatever you had you have already sold out\nwhatever you had. So, that was the most terrible time in all this events which we had, the so-\ncalled liberation was the terrible hit of the reality. You were hit with the reality. Not where to\ngo and not what to do and how to start. Will you be accepted as a Jew? You cannot go on and to\nsay you are not a Jew, because really where you go they know you are Jew when you come to\nthe places where I used to live. And to stay in a strange, foreign surrounding like we were\nbefore, so I have to stay like I was all the time, a peasant, a farmer. To watch the horse and the\ncows. In reality I was a dentist. I want to go back. I didn\u2019t have nothing with me, but I have to\ngo to start to look for our existence. And as I said before already that part, I went to the village\nwhere I was born, and then later when they went with us to Krakow, all this trouble I have with\nFryda and when I came to Krakow. But the question of this liberation, to explain it in a very\nsimple term, that was the greatest shock of everything together. But when I came to Krakow,\nwhen I started to settle as I said, I have been there, different places, start to organize my life.\nAnd with the help of the uncle which came, we went to Belgium as I said. And in Belgium we\nbecame refugees. We became as one of the United Nations refugees. We registered there and I\nhave my register card as a refugee from the United Nations. And I got the permit because I had a\nvisa only to stay there, transit visa to pass through Belgium. But because I was recognized as a\nrefugee, they gave me time to stay three months there. In three months I had to renew my stay in\nBelgium. And we were under the auspicion of the foreign police, a special department, the\netranger (ph), police etranger. And they gave us another stay of three months.\n27",
        "Q: Okay, before we go on into Belgium, I just wanted to ask another question about the liberation\ntime. I\u2019ve forgotten the name of the family that was sheltering you right at the end of the war.\nWhat was their names?",
        "A: The Polish people?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Soltys. Soltys. That was a woman, a widow.",
        "Q: They were the ones in your hometown, right? But at the time of the liberation what was the\nname of the woman that you were staying?",
        "A: Oh that was a man, that was Muschau. He was recognized as a righteous man, the righteous\nbetween people. I gave him to Yad Vashem, and he is recognized. He was a wonderful person.\nHe helped us all the time, even the time when he didn\u2019t suspect us as Jews, he was all the time\nvery human and very helpful.",
        "Q: I thought you were staying with his sister right there. You were actually staying with him right\nat the end of the war?",
        "A: We stayed with the sister, but it was a very terrible accident. The last, the last bullet, the Russian\nbullet got his hand, his left hand. Because his house was on the, on the border. Where the front\nwas standing between the Russians and the Germans and there was heavy fire because there was\nthe Dunajec river. And he was close to this river, not far. So he decided, the frontier between\nthe Germans and the Russians, which was standing about four or five months was very close to\nthis place. And his house was under fire, so he decided to come to his sister place, and while he\nopened the door, a bullet cut his left hand. And he was bleeding and because he knew that the\nunderground station, sanitary station was in my place, so he decided that the neighbor took him\non a wagon and he brought him to me there to give him first help. And I cut him. It was\nhanging on the skin, this hand. I cut on this and I bind around that he doesn\u2019t bleed out and I\nwent back with him together and brought him to his house. And there I found out a really\nsurgeon doctor was hiding there in the underground army and they brought him to this house. I\ngave him the anesthesia, whichever it could be a little bit chloroform. But most anesthesia was I\ngave him alcohol. We had there moonshine, moonshine. And he was drinking so he was out of\nconscious. And this surgeon bind him, all these veins and arteries. First of all, he cut him a little\nbit of this arm farther because it was already gangrenous, gangrene, because where I bound it\nthere it started, it is very fast process. He cut it there and bind all the arteries and veins and so he\nsurvived. And then I didn\u2019t go more to the place of the sister, but I stayed with him and took\ncare on him all the time. So he survived and he was thankful to me and I was very thankful to\nhim. So it was a very, very good occasion to serve this man, this very nice person.",
        "Q: Was Fryda with you then too? With him?\n28",
        "A: No, for the first two days she stayed still with the sister there. But later on she came here, we\nbrought here. The front was standing there fora moment. There was a fight there. The\nGermans run away. They left only some guns, automatic shooters. And these were not origin\nGermans. This were Russians which were collaborated with the Germans. And they were\nmaking the last fights with the German. And there in this house just, we were there. The\nGermans caught the first Russian soldiers who came in, and they bind them together and they put\na grenade between them and they kill them there, on the garbage there.",
        "Q: Did you see that happen?",
        "A: I saw it later, after I saw them there. The Germans came in, you can come take in the shoes if\nyou need from this people. And then the Germans escape, of course. That was the end of this\nfight there. And after several days we went there, to the sister there. We took a little bit of what\nwe had, our clothings and we left there, from there. And then we are looking on occasion\nsomehow to go to Krakow and to go to my village there and to organize this life like I said.",
        "Q: But even though the war had ended and you were supposedly liberated, you didn\u2019t tell these\npeople that you were Jewish?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t tell them and for a long time they didn\u2019t know, until... I don\u2019t know exactly when\nthey started to realize that I am Jewish. But when the war passed my village where I was, the\nwar continued. It was January twenty-one and the war was continued until, as you know, until\nMay. So here was all the time moving Russian trucks and armaments and soldiers. That was the\nonly way, with the soldiers for a bottle of vodka, which we could have some commuting to\nKrakow or to the other villages. It was also very dangerous. They were also not very\nsympathetic to Jews. Sometimes Fryda stand in the line to get a ride to the village there for some\nfood to these Polish people. So there was standing a lot of people and waiting for this ride. So\nthe Russian driver which was taking said, \u201cYou yes, you can go. You yes, yes. But you no, no\nJews, no Jews, no Jews.\u201d Even the Russian soldier. So there is no big difference between one\nand the other one.",
        "Q: So you really didn\u2019t feel then that the Russians were any safer to live with than the Germans had\nbeen?",
        "A: First of all, they didn\u2019t realize who is a Jew or no, except that they really recognize by\nphysiognomy, they saw it is a Jew. And then in reality they were not more, well they didn\u2019t have\nin their program to kill Jews. That was individual soldiers, some of them which were, I don\u2019t\nknow, they were from some other nationality as Russians or Ukrainians or Belorussians or\nLithuanians or Latvians. There were all kinds of soldiers there. So that was more individual and\nthen it was also sometimes inspired by some other anti-Semites to go to kill a Jew. The Russians\ndidn\u2019t hesitate to kill a Jew, too. However it came in the Polish Army, which was a Polish unit\nin the Russian Army. In this unit there were many Jews, I mean for us, many... five was many.\nBecause we used already without Jews here in this side, the German side. But there were some\nJews and the times when the Jews didn\u2019t hear, you could hear... I understand Russian and\nUkrainian, too. So, I could hear how they were expressing themselves anti-Semitic even to their\nofficers and to their sergeants. \u201cThese dirty Jews,\u201d and so forth. So this is the reality like it was.\n29",
        "Q: Okay, then you were saying a little earlier about Belgium, then. And you were there as refugees\nand you had to be registered.",
        "A: In this village, I came to my village where I was origin. And I told you already before in this\nstory, that they send in somebody to kill us. And I didn\u2019t go back there to my village anymore.\nFryda went several times for food, but she never slept there. She went to the shtetl and in the\nshtetl were already three or four Jewish families. And between them was one, my niece, she\nlived there. She came there back to the shtetl there, and she had already a room there and she\nslept with her. And the next day she came back to Krakow. When she left I wasn\u2019t sure I will\nsee her tomorrow. It was a difficult time even after the liberation. Even after the liberation.",
        "Q: You mentioned last time about the group of people, the group of survivors that you were together\nwith. Where was that?",
        "A: That was already in Krakow. Well, you cannot say group, they formed a group. They find each\nother and because one of them has a place, so we came there. We could there sleep at night.\nAnd with no soldier, we were sitting and singing old Yiddish songs because we couldn\u2019t sleep.\nThe horror on our heads was so terrible that we couldn\u2019t sleep even. Like taking, by the time,\nhow to spend the time.",
        "Q: Were these people that you had known before the war?",
        "A: No, no, no. I never knew. I never knew these people. I never knew these people. That was only\ntwo or three days, until, as I told you, we find the place of my friends there, which they were\nalready coming survivors from Auschwitz after the liberation. Young people which were living\ntogether there. Sleeping there on the floor for a time. Somehow that you have, because in the\nevening there was curfew. You couldn\u2019t go in the street, you have to be someplace. So that was\nthe place where we could run away. And that was a very happy occasion to go in.",
        "Q: Okay, do you want to skip ahead then and talk about Belgium? Because we talked, that\u2019s where\nwe left off.",
        "A: Well when we came to Belgium. We founded there, because we came with Fryda\u2019s father, he\nfound there his brother, who survived in Antwerp. And he used to live in Antwerp before the\nwar and he was in Antwerp quite a known person. He was in the diamond business. And he was\npoor, but he already contact his other brother, younger brother in Holland, in England. The\nyoungest brother, who changed his name from Himmelblau to Hill. And then he became\nrecognized by the Queen as a British officer, decorated. And he already makes good business.\nHe was quite already a rich man. And he did help him. And also this uncle from the United\nStates, he opened us a place in Antwerp where we can take the money, how to survive our time.\nBut I didn\u2019t want to be supported. I organize, even illegal, a little clinic, and I treated Jewish\npatients, refugees who came there. And there was a yeshiva, an orthodox yeshiva, which I treat\nwithout money this all students there. And I don\u2019t know if I told you, one day came in a student.\nAnd you know whoever it comes you started to talk, \u201cWhere from are you? How do you\nsurvive? Where did you been?\u201d And there came in a yeshiva boy. A nice, pretty wonderful\n30\nboy. And I ask him, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I am from Krakow.\u201d \u201cFrom\nKrakow? We are also from Krakow.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d He was happy to hear that we are from Krakow.\n\u201cWhere did you live in Krakow?\u201d He said, \u201cWell in Diver (ph) Street, number four,\u201d and this\nhouse was the Himmelblau house of the house of my wife\u2019s family. And I remembered his\nfather. And Fryda knew his brothers and sisters, they were living in the same house for so many\nyears. And he started to cry and Fryda started to cry. I called in Fryda. In my clinic, I had a\ncorner in my bedroom where I put in an engine, a foot engine and actually did the patients,\nsomehow. But slowly I make a living off it and I had a possibility to make a decent living. So, I\nstopped the help of my uncle. I didn\u2019t want to be supported. In the meantime, as we have been\nthere for close to two years, Israel was established. And I was already connected with the\nZionist organization there in Antwerp. I was a member of the committee there. So I said, \u201cI\nwant to go to Israel.\u201d Well, Fryda\u2019s father didn\u2019t want to go. He preferred to stay in Antwerp.\nWell, he knew the languages and he had his brother there and he had the support from this two\nbrothers, so he decided he will not go with us. In the meantime, our son was born. He was\nalready two years old.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Henry Edward. He lives now in Texas, in Austin, Texas. He grew up in Israel. My uncle from\nthe United States sent us a visa and he even want us to come to the United States. And he\u2019ll pay\nour upkeep, my studies, so that I will be independent and we can live in the United States. But I\nfound that our place, after all we survived and surpassed, my place 1s Israel. This is the only\nplace for a Jewish person to live. That was my conviction.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\n31\nTape 4, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side A. Did you, did you have, what kind of experience did you have\nin Belgium, just as far as... were you just working all the time? Or were you having any leisure\ntime?",
        "A: Oh yeah, leisure time enough. And as I said, I was an active Zionist, too. And...",
        "Q: How were you active?",
        "A: Well, organizing young people who came there, many refugees from Poland, from Russia, from\nGermany. They start to come from all places there. And then they came from Israel. There was\nthe Israel soldiers which are serving in the British Army. They were in Europe and Germany and\neverywhere there was fighting against the Germans. And they are the people who helped us to\norganize the people to go to Israel. And quite a number of them went to Israel. Some of them\nremained in Belgium, some went to Australia, some went to America. But as I later heard, many\nof these young people who went to Israel became soldiers, even they were unexperienced\nsoldiers, only to fight for freedom. And most of them were killed in this fight because they were\nnot experienced soldiers. But Israel need everyone there in this time. It was a very hard time\nthere in Israel, too. And when I decide we are going, we organize. We brought everything,\nbecause in Israel we knew there is nothing, refrigerators and the stove, furniture, hardware, what\nwe need for the kitchen for a living. We took everything. We took several lifts and we went to\nMarseilles by train. And from Marseilles we went by boat, by the Kadma (ph). It was quite a\nnice boat. And that was my son\u2019s second birthday on this ship. The captain make him a party,\nwell, kind of party, a reception for our son there.",
        "Q: What was the date?",
        "A: That was April the 6\". My son was born April the 6\". So, we left Marseilles April the 5\".",
        "Q: 1948?",
        "A: 1948. No, 1951, excuse me. 1951, because \u201849 our son was born. When Fryda was pregnant we\ndidn\u2019t want to go for this experience. We were waiting that he will be able to make this\ntransport. In April of \u201851 we left for Israel. We were so far fortunate that our friend from\nAntwerp, who 1s also from Krakow, left for Israel a year before us. And he rented a house there\nwith two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom. And they invited us that we would be able to stay\nwith them for the first day until we find a place to stay. Because that was no other way. And we\ncame to them, we stayed with them. And the lift arrived. There was a yard there, we could put\nthe lift there. We were searching for an apartment. And we rented an apartment, which was a\nliving room and a bedroom, a hall, a kitchen and a bathroom. That was all.",
        "Q: What town was this in?",
        "A: Pardon?\n32",
        "Q: What town?",
        "A: Givataim, a suburb of Tel Aviv. We didn\u2019t want to go to Tel Aviv. First of all, it\u2019s a big town\nand everybody was going to Tel Aviv. And that was a settlement which was in development and\nthat was, to compare, a little bit cheaper. And I didn\u2019t have enough money to buy an apartment.\nWe rented an apartment. And we organized there. I organized in these three rooms, the hall was\nthe waiting room, the bedroom was the clinic. And there was a bed which was in the day, closed\nlike a cabinet. In the day I could accept patients. And the living room was the bedroom for us.\nWe were sleeping there in the bedroom. And the child was there. There was a terrace. It was\nnice. After working there about two years we rented, just close, became free another big room\nand a kitchen and a little hall. So we rented this, and... excuse me. We bought it. I bought it.\nIn the meantime I bought this apartment where you are renting. I bought this apartment. And I\nmade of both of them one bigger apartment and a separate clinic. And life became more\ncomfortable. We organized a very nice apartment and a very nice living in this room.",
        "Q: When you said you came to realize that the only place that you as a Jew could be at home was in\nIsrael, what had happened after the war that made you come to that conclusion?",
        "A: Well maybe it is not known in the world and people are more concentrated on Poland and Polish\nanti-Semites in Germany. But Belgium, which seems to be more sympathetic to the Jewish\ncase... in Antwerp, where there was quite a number of Jews, when you were looking for an\napartment for rent, it was in the windows written, \u201cNot for foreigners.\u201d And that meant not for\nJews. In some of the apartments was written exactly what I said, \u201cNo Jews.\u201d And I in the\nmeantime learned to speak Flemish, which was the language in Antwerp, because Brussels was\nmore French. But Antwerp was Flandria. That was the the part of... Belgium has two nations,\nValonia and Flandria. The Flandrians were more, more German sympathetic. They were\nGerman oriented. Valonians were more French oriented. And Jews which were saved in\nBelgium, they mostly were more saved in this part which was Valonian. In Flandria there was\nimpossible to survive. We came, rented an apartment. And still we were all the time renting\nthere. And that was a nice apartment. We love it. And the administrator showed us the\napartment and the conditions where it was not expensive. It was nice and the place was nice.\nAnd when it came to write the lease, he says, \u201cYes, but you are not strangers.\u201d And we said,\n\u201cYes, we are strangers. We are from Poland.\u201d And he said, \u201cBut you are not Jews?\u201d I said,\n\u201cYes, we are Jews.\u201d So, \u201cI am sorry, I have instructions from my... I am not the owner, from the\nowner, no Jews. I am sorry, no Jews.\u201d And that gave me a lot to think about it. Around you see\nno friends, no friendly, no foreigners, no Jews. So that means there is no place to live here for\nthe Jews. However there is a lot Jews remained there and lived there. They didn\u2019t care about it.\nBut I was, I don\u2019t know, personally more sensitive realizing this problem. I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\nwant to be, that can happen the same everywhere.\u201d And therefore I decided to go home. I said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one place where nobody would tell me as a Jew you have to live. You have all the\nrights.\u2019 And that was the reason.",
        "Q: Was there a particular organization that you were working with in Brussels? A Zionist\norganization?\n33",
        "A: Yeah, it was the general Zionist movement. General Zionist movement. Not labor, not\nrevisionist, general Zionist. That was in this time a general Zionist organization.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your last interview, I believe, that you had spent some time studying in\nGermany as well. Was that, did that happen after you had gone to Israel?",
        "A: Yes. After I became involved in my profession. In the dental association I became one of the\nactive members in the management of the organization. I became vice-president of the\norganization of the dental association in Israel. And because a big part of Jewish dentists in\nIsrael, their origin was countries where they spoke German. If 1t was Czechoslovakia, even\nPoland, they spoke more German than Yiddish, or even Yiddish, they could understand German.\nAnd there was a necessity, there was not world literature in Hebrew in this profession. And we\nwere interested as these people became more educated and more acquainted in the profession,\nwhich made progress terrible. Progress during the five years and then later on and on all the\ntime. And there was English literature, which the people didn\u2019t know. I spoke already a little bit\nEnglish, but not enough to be fluent in literature or to give a lecture in English. The University\nhas some professors which were lecturing in English. But for the mass, I mean for the majority\nof the dentists it wasn\u2019t understandable. So we needed German-speaking lectures. And time by\ntime, we start to bring in from Germany lecturers, professors. And so I became acquainted with\nthese professors. And we started to exchange normal relations between them. So we started\norganize even at the universities in Germany, some courses for the occasion, for progress, for\nprofessional progress. So we make a course in Bonn. We make a course in Berlin. We make a\ncourse in Munich. We make a course in Marburg on the Lahn. It was in Frankfurt also some\ncourses. Some from time to time there were a group of twenty, thirty people who can afford it,\nwho are going only for education there. And that was the reason. And so I went with this group\nthere. And I went to Bonn where I stayed for three months there. And I make my, my\ngraduation doctor there in Bonn and then Marburg. That was the two universities. Marburg was\na general university and Bonn was only a dental school. So here we got a dental license as a\ndental practitioner license and here you make your doctor up in Marburg. So you are a doctor\nand a dentist, both of it.",
        "Q: So up until that point you hadn\u2019t actually been a doctor until you...?",
        "A: No, I haven\u2019t been a doctor until this time. I be only a dentist, a licensed dentist in Poland. A\nlicensed dentist in Poland.",
        "Q: And how did it feel to, as a Jew, to be doing these studies in Germany after what had happened?",
        "A: In general, the staff of the university, of each of these universities, they were very, very\nforthcoming and they were very gentle and very willingly to help us. Even we knew that some\nof them were with a Nazi past. The more Nazi they were before the war or during the war, the\nmore forthcoming they were after the war. They didn\u2019t know, they said, about anything what\nhappened before. And they were always good with Jews and they had good relations and even\nthere at the university there were professors Jews and so forth. In Bonn, for example, the head of\nthe school was Professor Kirkhaus, which was known that he was a member of the Nazi party.\n34\nAnd he was the first one who quit the Jewish professor who was there. I don\u2019t remember this\nmoment what his name was.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re there for three months and you\u2019re studying in a German university. Did you feel\nangry? Or did you form any friendships with any Germans?",
        "A: I can hardly say that you were angry, because nobody forced you to go. You have to, to have\nyour attitude, you come there, you have to accept the reality. Of course, you knew exactly that\nyou are stepping on the burning ground. You know this is not the place where you should be.\nBut it is not only there. You start to think with the real terms even then already. This is the\nreality of life and this is the future of life. If you want to separate and if you want to be\nsomebody else, chosen for something. There is no place for you on this world. You have to\naccommodate it to the future life. And this is the future life. This is the future. Now you see\nwhat happens. Israel has relations with Germany, with France. However we know there are still\na lot of anti-Semites. And they are everywhere. They are everywhere. But they are not because\nthey are special anti-Semites. There are anti-blacks, there are anti-yellows, there are anti-Asians,\nthere are anti, all kinds of antis. This is the reality of the world now. You know, it sometimes is\nfor me difficult to accept the general view of the Jewish world about the Polish anti-Semites,\nabout Poland. I born in Poland. I got my education in Poland. I lived there. And I was a Polish\npatriot. And so were many, the majority. There were some Jews which didn\u2019t accept never that\nthey are Poles. And to say that the Poles were all anti-Semites, I will not put this category, put\nthem in this category. There were some interests. And people are behaving very often, very\ndifferent in different situations. But to say a priori all the Polish are anti-Semites, it is\nexaggerated. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not true. But the same you can say about Jews. They are anti-\nArabs, they are anti-Poles or anti-this. There are Jews who are anti-Jewish. Everything exists.\nBut mainly I don\u2019t know how to categorize it, even with my most sophisticated thinking, I think\nin every human body there is some anti, some anti. Anti- this, anti-him, anti, is it anti-blacks or\nsome blacks? Or anti-yellows or just some yellows? Anti-Asians. There is in every human\nbeing, there is an anti. But you have to come to some point that you are living in this world,\nwhich 1s very differentiated and if you will not accept this, there is no place for you. Because\nevery day brings surprises. We are not done with wars. We are not done with discriminations.\nIt was, it is and it will be forever, forever.",
        "Q: When you first moved to Israel did you feel, I mean there you were among your own people, did\nyou feel a sense of relief or a sense of being at home as you had hoped to feel?",
        "A: Well, this question is a very sensitive question. When you came to Israel, how difficult it 1s to\nsay, there was a gap between these born Israelis, long living in Israel and newcomers in Israel.\nLike everywhere, a stranger gets feeling of a stranger. You are a stranger for a while until you\nare not accommodating to the reality. And then some gap, some gap, it is sixty years after\nestablishment of Israel state, fifty-two years, but there\u2019s still differences between born Israelis,\nlongest living Israelis and new coming Israelis. Is it good? It is reality. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\nknow. Maybe it is human nature. It\u2019s this kind of jealousy. But in the beginning when you\ncame in, the feeling was a little bit different, because a lot of people in Israel, living in Israel, not\nborn in Israel, but living in Israel for many years, who were the elite in Israel, came from Poland,\nRussia, maybe Czechoslovakia. Some came from Germany, too. Zionists. They felt the elite,\n35\nand you felt when you came in with a feeling how could you survive? You must have done\nsomething which 1s not right, that you could survive the Holocaust. Because my parents, my\nuncle, my grandparents, my brother, my sister, they were killed. Everybody. Nobody is here.\nAnd you survive. You must be guilt of something. You have to feel this guilt.",
        "Q: Did people actually say that to you?",
        "A: I heard it. It wasn\u2019t meant maybe special straight to me, but I heard it. I heard it in a quite clear\nvoice. These people who survive, they were collaborating with the Germans. And that gave you\na very, very strange feeling, very bad feeling.",
        "Q: Will you say a little bit more about how you dealt with that? I mean you had such high hopes of\nfinding a place where you would really be at home. Did you, how did you deal with it?",
        "A: I was maybe more fortunate than the majority of this newcomers. First of all, because I was\ninvolved in the Zionist organization and secondly because I knew the language. And that gave\nme a very great advantage not to be singled out. That was worse with people who couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate. And they had to communicate in other language, which was in Yiddish or in\nGerman, and the Israeli-born children didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. They didn\u2019t want to speak Yiddish.\nI think they\u2019re quite chauvinistic. I think they are quite chauvinistic. And the same thing can be\nsaid about the long living in Israel. They were maybe not so chauvinistic as they were the best\none, the good one. \u201cWe came here and we built this country. We fought for this country and we\ngave us acountry.\u201d You know, that was also a very strange feeling. A very strange feeling. But\nwith the time you got used to all kind of treatment in your society.\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n36\nTape 4, Side B",
        "Q: This is tape four, side B. Who were your friends then, mostly other refugees when you were in\nIsrael?",
        "A: It\u2019s not only me, but usually people are always closer to their landsmen. Coming from Poland,\nget with the Polish people. Coming from Hungary, are living with the Hungarians because of the\nlanguage. I cannot say. We had people from different, from Hungary, from Romania, from\nCzechoslovakia, from Germany. And in reality, the most educated people which we met in\nIsrael, which were the leading intelligentsia in Israel, they were original from these countries.\nFrom Germany, coming from Germany. Because the aliyah which came to Israel from the Arab\ncountries, they were merchandise mostly. Very, very, very few which were professionals. They\nall business men, all handy people, making something for a living. But in general, there were the\npoor people who came, that were the first who came into Israel. That was the big problem. They\ndidn\u2019t have the language and they didn\u2019t have the... for them life was very difficult when they\ncame poor. So there was difficult for apartment. They built temporary shelters for them. And\nthey were living in these shelters for several years until they somehow came out there. There are\nsome of them living until today. Some of them built houses on the places where the shelter\nhouses were. They allowed them to build, so they gave them... because most of the land were\nbelonging to the Keren Kayemeth. So they allowed them, these people to settle on this places\nbecause the government wasn\u2019t able to give them stable living. So there are some slobs until\ntoday and there are some which built nice houses. And of course, with the time, the new\ngeneration there went to school and they make progress. And a lot of them came with their\nreligious leaders, with their Rabbis. And then they settled in their own circles. And this is now\nIsrael\u2019s greatest problem, is their religious Orthodox problem. With the Sephardic, Sephardic\nthose are those, Sephardic in reality means the Spanish people. They don\u2019t have nothing to do\nwith Spanish, except maybe their ancestors came from Spain. But generally they are Arabic\nJews and they learn quite fast, Hebrew. And they arrange their life very nice. And they make\nterrible progress, very, very nice progress. But the problem of Israel is not solved and will never\nbe solved in my opinion. That\u2019s war... my son, for example, was in two big wars, in the Six-\nDay War and the Yom Kippur War. And that was one of the main reasons that he left Israel.\nHe said he had enough of wars, when he came to the United States for studying his business, so\nhe found that he would be better here. And he stayed here. And therefore we are here. We\ncame after him, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be here in the United States. I would be here in Israel\nuntil today. And I\u2019m not sorry that I did it, because I\u2019m not sorry of one step in my life. I don\u2019t\nlook backwards. I take the reality. Iam here happy. I live happy. And so is my son. I have two\ngrandchildren. My granddaughter graduated now from the University here in Kentucky. But she\nlives also to Austin, Texas, where my son lives. And our grandson is in Virginia Beach. So now\nwe are without children and without grandchildren, but we have here very good friends. And we\nare happy here, making our life here.",
        "Q: When your son was growing up in Israel did he ask you about your past and about the Holocaust\nyears? Or did you tell him about what had happened there?",
        "A: Well the first years, I myself couldn\u2019t talk about it, neither could my wife. And she 1s until today\nnot so outspoken. And for her the language barrier in Israel was very difficult, very difficult.\n37\nShe learned the daily language, but usually she couldn\u2019t live a cultural life, except going to\nconcert and eventually from time to time with me to the theater. But usually it was a barrier for\nher. But we have a society where she could speak Polish, where she could speak German. And\nwe had very wonderful company, very good friends. And then concerning our son, it came when\nhe went to school, to elementary school. He asked in the first grade, he asked about whether we\ncould help him with something in his homework. And mother told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but go to\nFather because I don\u2019t know.\u201d So he ask a very simple question, \u201cMom, did you ever go in your\nlife to school?\u201d So it is difficult to say that we spoke with him about the Holocaust because it\nwas a painful thing to go on to put it on your children. But of course when he growed up, when\nhe went to high school and later on to military, he realized what happened and he asked some\nquestions. But not too many, not too many, not too many. And I think until we came here, to the\nUnited States, he learned more about all of this than all his staying in Israel.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t so much a part of cultural life in Israel then to even talk about it, even though it\u2019s a\nsociety mostly composed of Jews? People weren\u2019t, the children weren\u2019t being taught necessarily\nabout what had happened in Europe with the Nazis\u2019 extermination of Jews?",
        "A: Well, I, I cannot agree with this what you ask for. My culture life in Israel was very, very\ndeveloped. First of all in the professional way because I was very active in my profession and I\nstudied a lot. And except of which I went to concert and I went to theater, all Jewish theater, I\nmean Hebrew theater. I understood and I could take it. And then I had a very rich library in\nHebrew language and I was reading in Hebrew and for me Hebrew became my, really to say, my\nfirst, or my second language if I would say the truth, because the first always remains the Polish\nlanguage which you have your basic education.",
        "Q: My question was more about whether your son, your son was... or even in this, I would maybe\nhave guessed that in the schools he would have been taught about the Holocaust because he\u2019s\nliving in Israel. But from what you\u2019re saying it sounds as if there was not very much talk about\nthe Holocaust.",
        "A: You are right. In the first maybe ten years there was no talk about the Holocaust. Later on bit by\nbit it came out and they start to open more the world and exchange of knowledge of the world,\nwith all other countries in Europe and the United States. And the Jews from the United States,\ntourists used to come, family members looking, searching for family and some of them finding.\nAnd there was always exposed to the Israeli informations in the papers and everywhere that was\nalways the corner, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to find families, far families and families\nand friends from shtetl. Here they found a sister, here they found a brother after not knowing\nthat they survived, because they disappeared and they went to different corners of the world, to\nAustralia or to New Zealand and to Africa and wherever you want, you have everywhere people\nin the world. So when they start to come somehow together it was more exposed in the reality of\ncourse, with this knowledge it came always a history and development of knowledge about\nHolocaust, how it came to it, and this opened the door to more knowledge about the Holocaust.",
        "Q: How long did you live, oh, here\u2019s what I wanted to ask you. How segregated were you from\nyour Arab neighbors? Did you have any interaction with them at all? Or were your lives just\ncompletely separate?\n38",
        "A: My personal life was never involved with any Arabs. With any Arabs, I didn\u2019t\nknow. Well, I can say that I knew nothing, but from the press and visiting to go to the South to\nBeersheba and passing some villages where Arabs was living going to Nazareth. If you go to see\nthe country, you met the Arabs and their way of living. But in my place where I lived there was\nno Arabs at all. At that given time there was no Arabs. In Tel Aviv, for example, there was a\nsection which was Jaffa, the port of Jaffa, the old port of Jaffa is the oldest port in the\nMediterranean. There are living Arabs until today. The majority of them are Arabs and they are\nChristian Arabs and there are Muslim Arabs. There are churches, there are mosques. So when\nyou are going to Tel Aviv, because there is not separation between Tel Aviv and Givataim,\nGivataim was on the rand (ph) of Tel Aviv, that\u2019s like a suburb of Tel Aviv. And then when you\nwant to go for a good meal, you went to Jaffa there. Good restaurants. Were Arab restaurants.\nAnd Oriental Jews opened oriental restaurants. So this is the way where you came together with\nthe Arab world. You want to go to buy some fresh fish in the harbor there. So you could buy it\nat Arab fishers there. There were Jewish fishers, too. But generally we didn\u2019t have any, any,\nany connection and live together with the Arabs. We knew from the press and we knew from the\nmedias how they live and where they live and what their problems are, but we didn\u2019t have\nnothing in common, nothing in common. You came to Jerusalem, of course, after the Liberation,\nI mean after the Six-Day War there, western part of Israel, or Jerusalem which they annected. So\nyou learned something. When you came to Jerusalem before when it was divided, you came\nalways to the gate, where we saw the Arabs here. It was always a danger to approach close\nbecause there were shootings.",
        "Q: When did you first go back to visit Poland?",
        "A: I went to Poland after, to be exact, about after fifty years.",
        "Q: Fifty?",
        "A: After fifty years I went to Poland. The second time I went after three years.",
        "Q: So it was about 1995 that you first went to Poland?",
        "A: Something like this, yes.",
        "Q: Will you talk about that, that trip?",
        "A: We decide to go, when the parents of our good friends which live here in Kentucky came to visit\nhere. It was a very old Krakow family which knew the business of Fryda\u2019s parents and he by\nhimself helped one Jew to survive. And they are very, very nice people. We met them and\nbecame friendly, very friendly. They really embraced us and they asked us to come to Poland, to\nbe their guests there. And to see, you will see it is not so bad. Just try, come and you will see\nyour sights. That was one thing. The other thing was we wanted to see our savior, this\nMuschau, who got his righteous papers there, and his family. We wanted to see him because he\nwas older than we are and we wanted to see him alive still. We supported him from Israel. We\nwere sending parcels and money from time to time. And we supported him and he was very\n39\nthankful. They were not rich people, very poor peasants. And he also wrote us that he will be\nhappy to see us. So we decided we will go, we will see how it is. We went there and as I told\nyou maybe before, I was a member of Rotary International in Israel and I became a member of\nRotary here in Lexington, too. And as a Rotarian you are obliged to visit a club wherever you\ngo. You should go to meet. Rotary have to come together, whoever it is. The Rotary in\nprinciple, Rotary has to have the best people. That\u2019s what the principle of Rotary is. And we\nwent there to see Rotary in Krakow on their meeting. And one of the members was a Jesuit\npriest, who was a professor at the University there. And he was a doctor of biology and a doctor\nof philosophy. A very bright person. After I had my speech there, at Rotary they are always\nasking guest Rotarian to give his impression and his greetings from his club to bring there. He\ncame to me, and we became very friendly, very friendly. So that even when I came back to the\nUnited States, we were writing to each other. I have maybe fifty letters from him, which he\nwrote to me and I wrote to him exchanging of some ideas. He was very fond of the Jewish\nreligion and of Judaism. Which I, I have studied a lot about Judaism, biblical Judaism and\nTalmudic Judaism. So I could give him some answers. We had some very, very interesting talks\nabout this subject. We had a very good time there. We went there to the village. One of our\nPolish friends which we became friendly, he visited here with the University of Kentucky for a\nyear. We became friendly and he invited to visit him in Krakow. And he went with his car with\nus to these villages where we used to be in hiding there. And we went there and met the people.\nThere was a very exciting experience. And we really enjoyed to see this everything from\nperspective, it gives us some good feeling that we could do it. And therefore we went for the\nsecond time, too.",
        "Q: Had you kept in touch with anybody in Poland apart from Muschau?",
        "A: Yes, we saw Muschau for himself.",
        "Q: No, had you kept in touch with anyone other than Muschau during the years that you were not in\nPoland?",
        "A: No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all. Except these people here from the United States which we\nmet here and this people who visited here and the Jesuit priest which we visited, otherwise we\ndidn\u2019t have.",
        "Q: So, Mrs. Soltys or her son, did you see them?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we saw them. We saw both sons. They were, well, they were very touched. Madame\nSoltys didn\u2019t live anymore, she was gone. The second time we were even the Soltys son, the\noldest son passed away, too. Only the youngest son, Kazimierz Soltys, which writes us until\ntoday and we send him from time to time some money. Otherwise no.",
        "Q: What about, there were people who, I assume you had left Poland and they didn\u2019t know at the\ntime that you were Jewish, but you were friendly with them, such as the people who hid you.\nDid you have any encounters with people like that?\n40",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t meet more people. I will tell you, I didn\u2019t want these people to have different\nfeelings, that I was Jewish and they couldn\u2019t know and could even help me, maybe they will be\nsorry that they did it. I don\u2019t want to put them in this conflict. I don\u2019t know. You can never\nknow human thinkings, human spirits, human soul. You never know. I don\u2019t want to hurt\npeople.",
        "Q: But overall your visit was very good it sounds like.",
        "A: Yes, my visit was very good. Short. Very good. Well, we experienced one a very, very peculiar\nexperience while we were walking in Krakow. In the market place, in the most important place\nin Krakow, in the most beautiful place in Krakow and I am not sure that the person who did it\nknew that we are Jewish and it wasn\u2019t directed to us. I think because this person run away from\nthe market, screaming, \u201cDeath to the Jews.\u201d And that was a very, very strange feeling, very,\nvery strange feeling. I couldn\u2019t blame my friends. I couldn\u2019t blame nobody. Maybe some\ncrazy. You never know what people are able to do and who they are.\nEnd of Tape 4, Side B\n4]\nTape 5, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number five, side A of an interview with Oscar Haber. And you wanted to mention\nabout your visit?",
        "A: Because I was talking about Krakow, about the unpleasant what happens to me, I will try to\nmake some remarks about the Sharoka (ph) which 1s called the high street. And there is the\noldest synagogue in Europe, called before the world the Alte Shul. And there is now a Jewish\nmuseum. There is another thing there on this street, which is one of the oldest, maybe oldest too,\nmaybe in the same time. I don\u2019t know exactly. The Remu Shul, the shul which is named after\nReb Isserls, which was a Rabbi in Krakow in the, I guess it was in the fifteenth century if I am\nnot wrong. There is still a shul and there are still Jews coming and there is a minyan and praying\nin Shabbas. And they\u2019re of course coming curious. And there is always a meeting of Jews who\ncome visit Krakow. They are always coming there. And the site of this shul is the old cemetery\nwhich a gravestone of this famous Rabbi, Rabbi Isserls. They called the shul and they called the\nRabbi \u201cRemu\u2019. Rabbi Moshe Isserls. About him, used to say, \u201cFrom Moses, to Moses was not\nlike Moses Isserls.\u201d Was a very great Rabbi, who corrected one of the main Jewish religious\nbooks, the Shulchan Aruch, on which the Jews, the Western Jews were living their daily life.\nThat was included every point of life from the Jews. But I will go back to the museum. There\nare remnants from Jews in Krakow. There were several severed Torahs, Bibles, and all kind of\nreligious utilities. And last but not least, there are many photos of old Jewish life in Krakow.\nAnd we were there for a Shabbat prayer at the Remu Synagogue which I mentioned before. And\nthere were a minyan, there were even a group of young students from Canada came to visit\nPoland and they were visiting this shul and sitting all the pray and praying. And another thing\nwhich is to see of Jewish life, there is a Jewish cultural center on the Meilzel (ph) Street. A\nfoundation of Canadian Jew, a , and there are also kind of all Jewish life in the\npast and the present Jewish life. And they are cultural meetings. There are coming writers and\nmeeting there and presenting their books. And there are Jewish books there in this unit there.",
        "Q: Did seeing all of this inspire you at all to, to think about the possibility of Jewish life continuing\nin Poland? Did you ever consider living there yourself again?",
        "A: To answer this question 1s not easy. From a historical point of view I\u2019m sure Jews will live in\nPoland. First of all because of the root, of the roots. It may be even second, third, fourth and\nfifth generation, they have their Jewish ballast, if you want to say, which asks them to go back to\nthe sources. This is one thing. The second thing 1s, of the globalization of the world. The world\nis globalizing. It has united Europe. In another few years if it will continue this way there will\nno be borders between European countries. It will be a united Europe and Jews are living in\nEurope and will live in Europe. We have the best example, Spain. The Jews were driven in the\nfifteenth century from Spain and there are Jews living there. There is a Jewish life in Spain.\nAnd there will be everywhere. There is Jewish life in Germany. We may not like it. We may\nnot want it. But life is stronger than all our views. May it be political, philosophical, whatever it\nis, life has his right. Bread is easier. Where life is easier, people will always go. And that\u2019s my\nview. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But I am sure and I know that the last visit of the Pope\nin Israel gives a great contribution to somehow living together, Catholics and Jews. It is maybe\nironic that in general even in the United States, people, Jewish people in general are more\n42\ninvolved in general Christianity, maybe less in Catholic. Because there is a minority of\nCatholics. But Poland is ninety percent Catholics. And the Pope, his origin is Wadowice in\nPoland. And he was during the war behaving as a fellow Semite. And he now with his visit in\nIsrael and his approach to the problem of Jewish\u2014Christian connection, I think opens more the\ndoor for Jews to go back to Poland. Maybe I am wrong, maybe I am right. It is still a stereotype\nof American Jews which have a guilty feeling that they didn\u2019t do nothing, nothing in time of the\nHolocaust to help their brothers. That they are putting all the guilt of the Holocaust on Polish\npeople. I know the truth is that the majority of extermination, gas chambers and so forth was in\nthe Polish territory. But I find my very answer, I think the main reason is that it was much easier\nfor the Germans to make it where the biggest concentration of the Jews were. There was, in\nPoland was more Jews than all over the world. So instead to go to Holland or to go to Belgium\nor to go to Germany, of course they didn\u2019t want to take them because they were ashamed to\nbring the Jews to Germany. So I mean to this other little countries, to bring million of Jews it\nwas for them impossible. Impossible. Physically it was impossible. Maybe it would be good if\nthey had come to this idea. But their idea was to do this fast, fast and more able to do it was in\nPoland That\u2019s my opinion. Maybe I am wrong, but that is the reason. And of course, there is\nsomething to it that in Poland were no many objection to it. But there is another answer, Poland\nwas the biggest country of this all occupied territories except France. But France has its own\nAnti-Semitic history, so we can put it in another perspective.",
        "Q: So, if you knew that you had another hundred years to live, could you conceive of living in\nPoland, moving back to Poland for part of that?",
        "A: It is like I said, it\u2019s a very, very difficult answer. Maybe yes, maybe no. The yes is I would like\nto be the first one, not the second, not the third, not the fifth. But if I live fifty years and there\nwill be a community of a million Jews, I am not sure if I would not prefer to live in Poland. Well\nof course, my first priority is Israel, but I don\u2019t know what will happen to Israel in the next\nfuture. Iam very worrying and it is one of my greatest pains to think about, about a bad outcome\nof this situation. I don\u2019t want to be a prophet and I don\u2019t want to put my words in tapes or in\nhistory. But I am very afraid of the, what happens in Israel.",
        "Q: How do you feel about life in the United States?",
        "A: It is the same question like you ask me before.",
        "Q: Hard to answer?",
        "A: If I am living in the United States, it is the most wonderful place to live. If you ask me to live\nbetween Jews and the United States, I am not comfortable with it. I was more comfortable in\nJews to live in Israel or to live in Poland. And there is a reason to it and it is very difficult to\nraise out from history the past and the relations between American Jews and world Jewry at all.\nIt is a very difficult task. And even now, with their best will, with their greatest contribution to\nIsrael\u2014which 1s a feeling of guilt, of course\u2014the relations between old American Jews and the\nnew American Jews, except this which became very rich and involved in commerce and science\nand so forth, but the Jewish volks, volks... that means the Jewish Jews. The Jewish Jews which\n43\nare speaking still Jewish, which are reading Jewish books and they have the Jewish folklore and\nthey still have the memory, the heritage of European Jewry, 1s still differentiated.",
        "Q: Do you consider yourself an American now?",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m an American, loyal American, a loyal citizen and I know about what happened in the\nUnited States, politically and socially and I am very involved. I mean spiritually, because\nphysically I can\u2019t more. But I was a member and I still am a member, but not so supportive as I\nwas, I am a Republican. I cannot say I don\u2019t like Democrats because they are democratic. But I\ndon\u2019t like Democrats because they are more socialistic. And whatever smells of socialism or\ncommunism is for me, a red flag. And this is also a part of my Israeli past, which was the Labor\nparty, which was the priority movement for many years. And still they are trying to be, I don\u2019t\nknow what the outcome will be. Barak\u2019 is a Socialist and a member of the Socialist Labor party.\nAnd so are many of the desert members. And I don\u2019t like the religious extremists in the same\nway like I don\u2019t like the liberal extremists. I am used to a middle way, to a way of tolerance and\nliving in harmony with everybody.",
        "Q: When did you come to the United States?",

        "A: Do I come?",
        "Q: Did you come directly to Kentucky?",
        "A: Yeah, because my son was living in Kentucky, I came to Kentucky.",
        "Q: Do you remember your first impressions of the United States and of Lexington?",
        "A: Well, I came to the United States before I came to Lexington. I came to New York several\ntimes. And I make tours in Canada and California and Florida. I make Caribbean. And I knew\nabout American life and I met American people. I had my own idea about America. And my\nidea about Jewish America didn\u2019t change from the beginning until today. However my two\nbrothers are living here since \u201848, here. But they are still Polish Jews. They are Americans, but\nthey are Polish Jews. That\u2019s what I meant before what I said.",
        "Q: What is your idea about, what is your idea about Jewish America?",
        "A: Jewish Americans are Jews which speak Yiddish, love Israel, enjoy their life in the United\nStates, are good citizens here and live a Jewish life. It mustn\u2019t be Orthodox, it mustn\u2019t be strictly\nreligious, but humanitarian Jewish life, with everybody humanistic. That is my Jewish life, very\nhumanistic. Our great Rabbi and teacher, however it is a Rabbi, but a great Rabbi, the Orthodox\nRabbi, when it came to he, to him one famous gentile person. \u201cI will become a Jew if you will\n' Ehud Barak, Prime Minister of Israel from 1999 to 2001.\nAd\nteach me the Torah, how long I will stand on one leg.\u201d He says, \u201cNo problem, love your\nneighbor as yourself. This is whole Jewish religion and whole Jewish Torah, the most important\nthing.\u201d And that\u2019s what it is, what I mean, a Jewish American or an American American or a\nPolish American. Love the people who you are live with and you have to live with and\neverybody to see a human being. That\u2019s my opinion.",
        "Q: Are you a member of a synagogue here in Lexington?",
        "A: Yes, I am a member of the conservative movement. I accept it. There were asked about many\nthings which they change in the meantime when I approach the synagogue. There were no\nwomen called to the Torah. There were no women Rabbis. Now there is. But if they ask my\nopinion and I said, I will not be an exception. I am for the majority. You decided that you want\nit this way, I will agree. But not that I am fond of it, not that I like it. And that it my opinion.",
        "Q: You think that women should have the same traditional roles that they had in Orthodox Judaism?",
        "A: No, they have to have more liberal. But I still cannot accept a woman going to the Rabbi,\nbecause it is against the Halachic teachings. I mean, I accept it, but I don\u2019t find it nice. And the\nteaching there is, if a woman is not clean, she shouldn\u2019t come between the community. She is\nnot clean, that means when she has her menstruation. Only after she goes, she has menstruation,\nafter she finished and take a ritual bath, she is clean. And she is even with everybody. I don\u2019t\nsay she is not even, I don\u2019t say this is a dirtiness or an illness, but it\u2019s against the teachings of our\nsages. And if you go on to take off barriers one by one, officially as permissible, you take the\nbalance off Jewish religion. One of the two. You want to be Jewish you have to follow the\nteachings. Even when you don\u2019t follow, but you don\u2019t have to revolutionize it. That what I\nthink. Iam not kosher, for example. I am not doing a lot of things. I am riding on Shabbat. But\nmy opinion it is in those times, Shabbat there was no cars to ride on Shabbot. There was no\nelectricity to light. There was many things which I found it. But that\u2019s for me, but I don\u2019t say it\nis permissible. It 1s not permissible, but I find it, I can do it. If somebody doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s not\nmy problem. It\u2019s his problem. But I can do it. I can do everything which I found, in my\nopinion, it is an answer which is logic.",
        "Q: Do you have friends here in Lexington, who are Jewish or non-Jewish or what kind of\ncommunity do you have here?",
        "A: Well, I can say really friends are non-Jewish. This is the majority. Maybe there are some\nnumbers really which I can say they are not Jewish. Three, four families maybe or something\nlike this. But not to count as a really friend. These are really the Polish people, which are\nhelping me in need, when I had to go to an emergency, I call to the Polish people. They come\neven in the middle of the night and they bring me to Emergency. My wife is not driving and\nthey bring me. I don\u2019t have to go in ambulance. And other things also, they are really good\nfriends. So, I really don\u2019t differentiate it. Because you ask me I say they are accidentally Polish\nor Christian or Catholics and they are accidentally not. But they are my friends and they are my\nfriends, but not because of they are Polish, because they are Catholics or they are Christians. I\ndon\u2019t know if I have even one Catholic, exception of Polish people.\n45",
        "Q: Has it been important to you at all, did it, was it... let me start over. Was it ever important to\nyou to talk about with other people your experiences during the Holocaust. Did you get to a\npoint where you felt like I really have to tell people that\u2019s what I experienced and to be around\npeople who understand?",
        "A: I was talking several times in school, whoever invite me to give them, I give them my own\nexperience. But there was now a Remembrance day in the St. Luke church where there are\nmembers, two or three Christians which are my friends. And they are always counting on me\nthat I will be the speaker. And I for nine years will be making the Remembrance. They make it\nthis year, too and I went to them, I don\u2019t know I show it to you or you have it? No? I promise\nyou to give it to you, my talk. I have to make a copy. I forgot to make a copy. I will give it to\nyou someday if you will ask for it. And they make it in such a honorable day that was really a\npleasure to talk to these people and to explain to them, this time I spoke generally about the\nsituation. In the previous I gave from my personal experiences. And they are always anxious\nand they are...\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\n46\nTape 5, Side B",
        "A: Well, you asked me if I spoke to people. I must tell you, to my disappointment... I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe not disappointment, but take the reality like it is. I didn\u2019t have occasion to say my\nopinion or even something about the Holocaust to Jewish people. If they invited me to the\nTemple when there was Remembrance Day, they were asking me to light a candle. That was all.\nAnd they were making some prayers. And the same was here in our synagogue, when they\nmake. And they come such a small number of people that it is really not worth it even to open\nyour mouth to talk to them. But I wasn\u2019t asked to talk about the Holocaust. I wasn\u2019t asked.\nThey talk, they make some prayers and that\u2019s all. And that was very miserable, miserable. I was\nashamed that I was a part of this Remembrance Day. And that\u2019s it. Jews are not interested in it.\nMaybe they have it enough in books. Maybe they read about it, if that\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know.\nBut even when it is written, even when they read about it, I think, in my opinion, they have an\nopportunity to hear it from the first source. They should ask to hear of it, they should. But I\ndon\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t. Very ignorant, very ignorant. And then they are not interested.\nThe people, the few people who survive, they are not interested, because they know the same,\nthey have their opinion. And the other people are here, born here or for years are here, they are\nalready, they are already accustomed of the American habits, of the Jewish habits. That\u2019s what it\nis. They are not interested.",
        "Q: Do you feel that the people who were born here and who are from here, are less, have been less\nreceptive to you personally than have the newcomers?",
        "A: Well, I feel it, I feel 1t maybe personally, but I don\u2019t blame them. Maybe they were expecting\nmore involvement from my side in their community life, which I couldn\u2019t do, first of my age,\nsecondly my language is not good enough to expose my... it is maybe improved already, but in\nthe beginning my English was good to read, to understand. But to speak with my accent, to talk\nabout my experience and to be active in their community, it wasn\u2019t easy. It was maybe difficult.\nI even proposed and asked the Rabbi I can help him with the Hebrew lessons in the Sunday\nschool maybe. But he never asked me. And nobody did ask me to give a hand to something like\nthat. Maybe to a money drive, maybe they will ask me to do it, but that\u2019s not my specialty. I\nwill not do it. And that\u2019s one thing. The other thing is, which one influential person told me,\nthat they feel humiliated in my company. That I am too special for them, so therefore they are\nhesitating approach me. Well, I don\u2019t know what is true, what the reason 1s, but this is the reality\nwhat I told you. Iam a stranger for them and I will remain always to them a stranger. However\nthey are friendly. If I approach them they answer my questions, but that\u2019s all, that\u2019s all. What\ncan you do? That\u2019s the reality. And you have to live with it and we take it. And we learn after\nso many years of life, you learn to live with the reality, with each reality. This is the main source\nof our strength, to take the everyday reality in our life as custom life. And that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: Last time after we finished our interview you mentioned off tape, something about the\n\u201cbusiness\u201d of the Holocaust or the business that the Holocaust has become and I wonder if you\nwould say something about that. Does it bother you or do you feel that the Holocaust has been\noverly commercialized?\n47",
        "A: Again, I don\u2019t know who will hear this tape, but in the meantime there will be more business in\nthis field. You know, each community tries to make a museum, a Holocaust museum, which in\nitself is maybe a nice deed. But who will come to this museum? I think the Holocaust museum\nwhich is in Washington is the one which was a necessity, very important. And it fills all the\nspectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before the war, in the war and after the war. Maybe\nthere are some nuances which come out which are not of value. But to make so many, I think\npeople will not be interested to go to the main museum where they have everything. And this\nhappens because of the way how Jewish society is built in the United States. It has to be a\nsociety, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice-president, it has to be a secretary, it has to be\nmembers of the board and so forth and so forth. Maybe in itself it is as a social thing, maybe it is\ngood, maybe. But I think a majority of the raised funds goes to administrative use, the\npaperwork and to expenses which are not profit of the social needs of people who really needs\nthe help. That is what I think. And about commercializing the Holocaust, I think when you take\nthousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these\nthousands you will make one book which includes everything. So there is no need, in my\nopinion, for so many editions, for so many work with it in... I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. Of\ncourse, you can see a lot of people who became very famous because of the Holocaust, very\nfamous. But I don\u2019t want to criticize them. I don\u2019t want to criticize nobody. But I think it is a\ncrime if somebody makes it only for the business.",
        "Q: I\u2019m coming to the end of my questions. Is there something that we haven\u2019t talked about that\nyou'd like to talk about?",
        "A: Well, I gave, I gave a sketch about my experiences and about how I see it. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\ndon\u2019t have, in general, what to say about. And especially to the future generations of Jewish\npeople. Maybe somebody will listen to it. Maybe somebody will try to understand my point of\nview. But it is in the moment, I am ninety years old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life\nwith joy and suffering. It is like one Jewish sage said: \u201cIt is good to be born a Jew. It\u2019s good to\ndie a Jew, but what do you do in the meantime, this is the problem.\u201d From the beginning until\nthe end, the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life, which many other religion or\ncommunities don\u2019t have. Not because they wanted, but the wind of history put the Jews in the\ncenter of cultural life. Even in the world. Not only in Germany, not only in Poland or in Russia\nor in Palestine or Spain or in the United States. Everywhere where the Jews were the center of\ncivilized life, of cultural life was concentrated in the Jewish communities or singles. Jewish\nNobel Prize winners, there were scientists in the United States in medical field, in general\nscience are not compatible to no one other people. Maybe this is the reason that the jealousy of\nother people brings them to hatred. I cannot wish that the Jews wouldn\u2019t concentrate of all this\nprogress and culture and civilization. A country they have to do everything possible what brings\nprogress to the world. But I am turning to the other point not to cover this with egocentric\nreligious or national use. To take it more in human general perspective and civilized ways. This\nis my advice and this is my way of thinking. And that, and we will remember this, this can\nmaybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with other nations in civilized world. That we\nwill not be scapegoats in any way, which we were during all our history from the beginning until\ntoday. To avoid it, listen what I said. Thank you.",

    "questions": [
        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s May 17\", 2000 and we\u2019re conducting an interview with Mr. Oscar Haber here in his\nhome in Lexington, Kentucky and this 1s an interview for the Holocaust Survivors in Kentucky\nInterview Project, which is being sponsored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,\nas well as the Kentucky Oral History Commission. We are doing an interview that will focus\nmostly on Mr. Haber\u2019s experiences after the Holocaust because he has been interviewed before\nby the Survivors of the Shoah Foundation. And there is a videotape that is available through the\nShoah Foundation. My name is Arwen Donahue and this is tape number one, side A. Mr.\nHaber, let\u2019s start with your date of birth.",
        "Q: And you talked about, in your other interview and by the way if we ever repeat anything, we\u2019 ll\ntry to just cover things that we haven\u2019t talked about before. But I\u2019m sure that you don\u2019t\nremember everything that you said and didn\u2019t say, so I might remind you sometimes if we\u2019ve\nalready talked about something. But in your other interview you did mention that you went, you\nhad an unusual opportunity, you were growing up in a small town, in a shtetl and you were one\nof nine children, and you had an unusual opportunity to attend a high school, a public high\nschool and eventually became a dentist. And I\u2019m wondering how it happened that you had this\nopportunity to study in a public high school and where the high school was?",
        "Q: So, what language did you speak at home?",
        "Q: You mentioned that one of the towns nearby, Ropczyce, had a strong Hasidic tradition. Did your\nfamily have any Hasidic ties or traditions?",
        "Q: These would be your nieces and nephews actually. Right? Officially. Your sister\u2019s children?",
        "Q: They would be your nieces and your nephews?",
        "Q: Sounds as if you\u2019ve kept in pretty close touch with whatever members of your family have\nsurvived.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the time that we were talking about before the war. Did you end up going to\nhigh school then because your father wanted you to have oppor... special opportunities?",
        "Q: That normally your other siblings wouldn\u2019t have had?",
        "Q: So it was really your, becoming a dentist was something that you really wanted to do.",
        "Q: You mentioned in your first interview that you were a Polish patriot.",
        "Q: Were you politically interested or involved in Polish... well, were you interested in Polish\npolitics?",
        "Q: Not...",
        "Q: Tape one, side B. Were you involved in any Zionist organizations?",
        "Q: Well let\u2019s not get into overall historical...",
        "Q: When you were in the Army then, in 1935 and \u201836, did you, were you primarily with non-Jewish\nPoles?",
        "Q: And how was that?",
        "Q: Were you discriminated against at all for being Jewish during your service?",
        "Q: So, by the time you were in the Service, you were a dentist, were you a dentist already?",
        "Q: Yeah, so you were, your goal was just to do the service and then get out. Is that right?",
        "Q: But you said you didn\u2019t have such a good time in the... did you have a good time socially? Is\nthat what he meant? That you got along with other officers?",
        "Q: You mentioned in your other interview that you were involved with the underground army. The\nArmia Krajowa. How did you get involved with the army and when?",
        "Q: Were you afraid at all or nervous that they would find, that they would check up on your story\nabout having been an officer in Poznan and find out about your identity?",
        "Q: I have to...",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "Q: What was anti-Semitic about him? Why do you say that?",
        "Q: Yeah, I think it\u2019s valuable for the listeners to know who, who you are, what your beliefs are and\nwhere you\u2019re coming from and how you developed those beliefs. So, but also I wanted to find\nout, just make little bit clearer the chronology and the geography of what happened from the\nyears 1940 through 1944 or so. You were, you were, you told the story in the first interview\nabout how you went away to the Russian front. You tried to join the Army, you kind of got\ncaught underneath the Russian occupation and then you made your way back to your home\nvillage of Brzeznica? Is that right? And then I\u2019m a little bit confused. You mentioned that you\nwere working in an S, were you working in an SS camp? Was it a concentration camp for Jews\nthat you were working in? Okay, what was the name of the camp?",
        "Q: Pustkow. And you were interned there as a prisoner?",
        "Q: Tape two, side A. I\u2019m sorry, will you repeat what you just said?",
        "Q: When was it that you organized that clinic?",
        "Q: The Jewish doctors?",
        "Q: Did that happen because he had a special fondness for you?",
        "Q: Did you know him personally?",
        "Q: Were you treating Jewish patients only or were there other prisoners there, who were non-\nJewish? I mean political prisoners or something, who you were treating?",
        "Q: Okay, so you were doing that until 1942, when the area was evacuated and the Jews were\nordered to the ghetto?",
        "Q: So your, at that point your family, did they all go to the ghetto in Ropcezyce?",
        "Q: And your Polish, was your Polish good enough that you could pass well without worrying about\nlanguage problems as a Pole?",
        "Q: Did you have any, Fryda was talking in the interview that we did with her a little earlier today,\nshe was talking about some of the challenges of being in church and having to adopt this\npersona, where you had to, everything had to be just right. Do you remember any trouble that\nyou had with that?",
        "Q: But your family was unusual then. I mean, I think 1t was common for Polish Jewish families to\nbe pretty segregated and to just associate with other Jews. But your family was much more\nintegrated it sounds like.",
        "Q: You went from, okay, so in 1942 you went to the Priest\u2019s sister. I\u2019m forgetting the name of the\ntown.",
        "Q: And that was near the time when you got involved with the AK?",
        "Q: Did you, we didn\u2019t get to just talk a little bit more about your experiences in the AK. Did you\nhave any, do you want to tell us a little bit about that?",
        "Q: Yeah, it\u2019s going to, so I'll... you don\u2019t have to hold it.",
        "Q: I guess... sometimes I have to lift up my hand.",
        "Q: Tell me when you get tired.\n14",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "Q: Did you have any, I know that it was a challenge, the AK has a reputation for being very anti-\nSemitic. Did you have any trouble or close calls with that? With anybody finding out you were\nJewish?",
        "Q: Were you afraid at all during that time?",
        "Q: How did you meet Frantiszek Muschau, who you talked about in your other interview?",
        "Q: So you were working together, and you got him involved eventually in the AK?",
        "Q: Was that hard to get used to? Drinking that much without slipping when you were drunk? I\nmean, letting something slip?",
        "Q: What happened towards the end of the war? Did you have, you had information about what was\nhappening through your involvement with the AK that you knew where the Russian front was\nand whether they were advancing and so forth?",
        "Q: One second before we go on, I just want to make sure I understand your... So, you were\ninvolved with the AK, but you were also working on a farm? Is that right? So how did you?\nWhen did you?",
        "Q: Oh, at night time you worked with the AK?",
        "Q: Were you, you weren\u2019t, were you getting any sleep?",
        "Q: Did the people who were sheltering you know that you were working...?",
        "Q: So you mentioned the \u201cso-called\u201d liberation. Did you feel in any way as if you were free?",
        "Q: What had happened to your house in Brzeznica?",
        "Q: When did that happen?",
        "Q: About when was this? Do you know the approximate date?",
        "Q: Our third tape, so this 1s tape number three, side A. So there came, a woman came out of the\nhouse?",
        "Q: How did you, let me just interrupt briefly. How did you make that recognition? Was there some\nspecial way?",
        "Q: You went actually to the camp?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Did you, before you, so this is around February 1945, right?",
        "Q: Okay, did you know, did you know what had happened at Auschwitz at that point?",
        "Q: Can we go back? I know you already did go forward, but go back to the Auschwitz experience\nand what you... you mentioned you really discovered what had gone on when you were there.\nWhat did you experience?",
        "Q: At that time were you really thinking that you wanted to stay in Poland permanently?",
        "Q: Were you originally planning on making the entire trip to Costa Rica or was your intention to\njust stay in Belgium and not go any further?",
        "Q: Did you ever consider making aliyah before Israel was a state and going illegally?",
        "Q: Okay, it\u2019s now May 30, 2000, and we\u2019re continuing our interview with Mr. Oscar Haber. And\nwhy don\u2019t we start by going back, you had talked on the last tape about the day of your\nliberation. And just to remind you, what you had talked about, we were, you talked about how\nafterwards you had met up with some other Jews and you were singing some old Yiddish songs.\nAnd then you described going back to your hometown and then back to Krakow. The thing that\nI wasn\u2019t sure about, that I didn\u2019t quite understand is, did you immediately leave the town where\nyou were after liberation? And do you remember saying good-bye to the family that you were\nstaying with?",
        "Q: Okay, before we go on into Belgium, I just wanted to ask another question about the liberation\ntime. I\u2019ve forgotten the name of the family that was sheltering you right at the end of the war.\nWhat was their names?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: They were the ones in your hometown, right? But at the time of the liberation what was the\nname of the woman that you were staying?",
        "Q: I thought you were staying with his sister right there. You were actually staying with him right\nat the end of the war?",
        "Q: Was Fryda with you then too? With him?",
        "Q: Did you see that happen?",
        "Q: But even though the war had ended and you were supposedly liberated, you didn\u2019t tell these\npeople that you were Jewish?",
        "Q: So you really didn\u2019t feel then that the Russians were any safer to live with than the Germans had\nbeen?",
        "Q: Okay, then you were saying a little earlier about Belgium, then. And you were there as refugees\nand you had to be registered.",
        "Q: You mentioned last time about the group of people, the group of survivors that you were together\nwith. Where was that?",
        "Q: Were these people that you had known before the war?",
        "Q: Okay, do you want to skip ahead then and talk about Belgium? Because we talked, that\u2019s where\nwe left off.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side A. Did you, did you have, what kind of experience did you have\nin Belgium, just as far as... were you just working all the time? Or were you having any leisure\ntime?",
        "Q: How were you active?",
        "Q: What was the date?",
        "Q: 1948?",
        "Q: What town was this in?",
        "Q: What town?",
        "Q: When you said you came to realize that the only place that you as a Jew could be at home was in\nIsrael, what had happened after the war that made you come to that conclusion?",
        "Q: Was there a particular organization that you were working with in Brussels? A Zionist\norganization?",
        "Q: You mentioned in your last interview, I believe, that you had spent some time studying in\nGermany as well. Was that, did that happen after you had gone to Israel?",
        "Q: So up until that point you hadn\u2019t actually been a doctor until you...?",
        "Q: And how did it feel to, as a Jew, to be doing these studies in Germany after what had happened?",
        "Q: So you\u2019re there for three months and you\u2019re studying in a German university. Did you feel\nangry? Or did you form any friendships with any Germans?",

        "A: March 8\", 1910.",
        "A: The high school was in Debica, which is in the district of Krakow and that was about nine\nkilometers of my village where I was born. And we had, from the age of three, in our house,\nalways a teacher, special for religious purposes. But by this same occasion we were studying\nnormal classes. So in the age of four I could already go in the village to the first class of public\nschool and I still was a good pupil, because no one of them was on the level I was. But I finished\nthere the fourth year and my father decided I have to go into the small city, which was Debica\nthere. In the same time, he put us in a quarter, that means to live in the house of a Rabbi, which\nwas teaching us the Hebrew and the religious teachings. In the same time I went to the Polish\npublic school. And that was a very difficult experience because we have to get up in the\nmorning at six o\u2019clock, sometimes earlier, and before we went to the public school in the\nmorning for eight o\u2019clock it started, we had already to pray and to learn Hebrew and to learn\neverything about religious life. And more and more. So, I was there about six years living with\nthis Rabbi. At the same time after I graduated from the normal school, from the seven classes, I\napplied to the high school, but I was too young. Because it was already that you can go to\nschool, start school only by the age of seven, and I was four years old. But I was somehow\nfortunate, my father knew the director of this high school. And he spoke with him and he said,\n\u201cWell I cannot do it. He has to go normal now to the sixth class at least, at least and to repeat.\u201d\nAnd my father said, \u201cYou know, make him a test.\u201d\u201d And I got a test and I passed the test, but still\n1\nhe couldn\u2019t take me. I had to repeat the seventh grade another year. And then I was accepted to\nthe high school. And there I matriculated there and so I continued my studies.",
        "A: Well, the first language we spoke, that was Yiddish. My father was very religious and he want\nus to know the Yiddish, we are spoken. But we had Polish Gentile servants, too, so we have to\nspeak Polish too. And surrounded by peasants who are speaking Polish and you have to knew\nthe language. In the school was Polish of course. When I went to school in Debica there was in\nthe fourth class was already German, too. So I had German, Polish and Yiddish, and of course,\nHebrew, which was, it was the liturgical language, to pray. At the age of three we started already\nto learn Hebrew and we knew the Hebrew alphabet and we knew to pray and most of the\nprayings until today, I know by heart. Most of the thick books, we learn, we have to do it. And\nthe first when you opened eyes at the religious house, the first is to wash your hands, that\u2019s the\nfirst things. And to make a blessing about the washing the hands and you make a blessing for the\nfood and you have to thank God that you got up in the morning. That was the first Hebrew\npraying and that was at the age of three. At the age of four we started already to learn the Torah,\nwhich is the Bible, the Old Testament. And so we continued to, so therefore I am quite\nacquainted about religious Jewish life. And then later on, of course, in high school we learned\nabout, in the public school we learned about history and that was very interesting, world history,\ntoo. And German literature. And therefore I, until today, I am quite acquainted with the world\nliterature and especially the German literature and the Hebrew, of course. And the Yiddish. So,\nthis is the way like it was. It was a very hard thing, because the distance to the town was like I\nsaid about nine kilometers, eight or nine kilometers. I don\u2019t remember exactly. And for\nSaturday we used to go home, I mean to the village. And when we came to the village Saturday,\nthere was the traditional Friday evening meal with the praying, with everything. In our house\nwas there a minyan, which is the quorum of ten people which is praying, Jews, by Jewish law.\nAnd my late father, by himself with his own funds, he founded a Torah. He let scribe it, and we\nhad a new Torah in our house and there was a praying in our house and my father was the master\nof the ceremony. And the people from the villages around, which were few, not always was\nthere the quorum of ten people. But Saturday morning was always a praying in quorum. If it\nwasn\u2019t quorum, so how many it was, but it was the normal pray. And we had to know it and to\nparticipate. And that was in afternoon, my father take a sleep one hour and he took us 1n the\nroom, me and my brother, because my older brother was with me in the school at this Rabbi. He\nwas sitting down and we had to repeat what we learned all the week. My father wanted to know\nwhat we learned and how far we are continuing to progress. And that was the way like it was in\nour house. Of course, Saturday was like in the Torah is resting day. And that was the religious\nway of life. Nothing was working, nobody was working, even the servants. Only to feed the\nanimals, to milk the cows and that what was doing. But not working in the field, not other work\nwas performed. Only the most necessary for surviving, which was necessary.",
        "A: My father by himself was a Hasid. But he didn\u2019t go to Ropcezyce because the old Ropcezyce\nRabbi wasn\u2019t more. The founder of the Hasidic movement which was Reb Nafthali, which you\n2\nknow. And he was no more alive. There was already third or fourth generation there and there\nwas no potential Rabbi which could, which could affinate (ph) my father there. My father used\nto go to Sans (ph) , which was quite a distance, about fifty miles. To go for holidays there to the\nRabbi of Sans (ph). Also sometimes OfBobof (ph), which is also a little shtetl there in the\nsurroundings of Sans (ph). They were the very famous Rabbis, which is the continuation of this\nRabbis is now here in the United States. They are siblings and family offsprings, which are\ncontinue this Hasidic movement of Bobof (ph) and of Sans (ph). And that was, my father was a\nHasid of them. He wasn\u2019t, by himself, he wasn\u2019t a blind Hasidic. He wasn\u2019t overdoing. But the\nbasic religious things were holy for him. And that was my father. Of course my mother did\neverything what my father said to do. The thing was, my father, his first wife passed away. And\nfrom his first wife, gave birth a daughter and by the birth she passed away. He was a young\nwidower. He was already thirty-five or thirty-six years old and a matchmaker found him a girl of\nsixteen years somewhere in another village there. And she came to live with him, and she was\nmy mother. She gave birth to the nine children. And we were in touch with our sister, because\nJewish law recognize it, one child, when it is from the same father, is a sibling, more even than\none mother. That is the religious way and tradition. Interesting enough, our sister, she married a\nvery interesting man, who was, in the beginning he was a teacher in our house, teaching us the\nreligious ways. He was very educated in Jewish Talmudic teachings. And he married her, and\nhe succeeded, he became quite a rich man. And she gave birth to eight children. And there are\nonly two children survived and they are still living. One is ninety-two years old, lives in the\nUnited States. And the other one is eighty-five years, that\u2019s the youngest one, eighty-four years\nold, lives in Israel.",
        "A: Are?",
        "A: Yeah, they are my nieces and we are in touch with them and we are very much in good relations.\nAnd very interesting story about these two nieces. Both of them survived the Holocaust. The\none married in the war and had a daughter in the war. And she escaped, run away, being\npregnant from Debica, I mean this village there, to Lvov, which was in the Ukraine. Then it was\nbelonged to Poland, but the Russian invaded this part of the country, of Polish country. And she,\nwhen she saw the disaster in the ghetto, she put her child under a convent\u2019s door. And was\nlooking from far away what happened to this child. And she saw that a nun came out and she\ntook in the child in the house. And then she ran away and she became a servant, as a Polish girl,\nas a Gentile at the head of the Gestapo in Lvov. That was the older one. The younger one had a\nfriend in Lvov. She was in Lvov studying sewing, to be a seamstering. Mother, very good\nseamster, which she was. And she met there a boy, before the war he was leader already of the\ntrade unions. And when the Russian came in... in the beginning he was a very big shot. But\nwhen the Russians, when the German invaded, he went with the Russian back to Russia and\nthere he joined the Polish Army, which was organized there by the Poles after their agreement,\nthe Polish agreement in exile with the Russians, which allowed them to organize their Army,\nwhich was affiliated to the Russian Army. And they were fighting. And he was fighting the\nGermans until Berlin. And he put her on a Polish family. She was a seamster and she gave birth\n3\nto a daughter, but that was already in 1945 when the war is going to end. When he came from\nRussia to Poland with the invasion, I mean to fight with the Russian Army. And then she gave\nbirth to this daughter. And when the war was coming to an end, he became a governor of a part\nwhich was annected from Poland from the German territory there. And he took her there, and\nthey had another two sons, but they not living as Jews. And they very talented boys. And when\nit came in Poland the time where Jews moved from Poland to Israel in 1965 I guess, was it?\nSomething like this. They came, first time she told the sons that they are Jewish and they were\nalready both matriculated after high school diploma. And one of them was already studying\nengineering. And they came to Israel. But their father, himself, he in the meantime, being a\ngovernor he studied at the university at the same time to become an agronom... agronomy. And\nhe came to Israel as an agronom. But because Israel didn\u2019t have confidence to all these\napparatchiks from Poland. I mean all this communist active parties, he couldn\u2019t find a job. It\nwas very difficult to find. And we were already at this time in Israel and I had some connection\nwith people and to a member of the Israel Parliament. And I wrote to them and I warranted\nabout him, that he\u2019s not one of the Russian services and he got a job in agronomy. But he passed\naway about six or seven years ago. In the meantime, the older son is working in a very high,\nsecret Israel Army factory. And the other son was also an engineer, but in the same time he was\nteaching in a school, in a vocational school. And married a girl from Venezuela. And one year\nago they decided that they leave Israel and they came to the United States. And he got a job here\nin California. He must be very, very important engineer, because he got the, he made the green\ncard and he can work and they bought a house. But they have one son, who 1s at the Israel\nArmy. And just now I heard, two weeks ago, he went to Israel and asked to give him some off in\nthe Army. And he came to visit him here to the United States. He will not stay. He will go back\nto Israel. But he decided, his wife and with the other two children to stay in the United States.",
        "A: Oh yeah, whatever I have. I have two brothers. I have a second cousin, who was... they were all\nin camps. And they are living here in the United States. My brothers and my second cousins.\nAre we are trying to keep all together here.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: High school, further studies wasn\u2019t the main purpose of my father. My father would have very\nmuch liked me to go on and study Jewish, maybe Rabbinical even studies. But I was very\nstubborn and I was in very difficult conditions, making my study very difficult. Often in hunger,\noften have to work and to gain my life. But I did it. And I\u2019m happy I did it.\n4",
        "A: I, that was my idea. That was my idea and there was also an idea which I got from a cousin of\nmine who was a dentist in the other place there. And I liked the way like he was living. I was\nenjoying more the free life. This religious life didn\u2019t match my character. I wasn\u2019t never,\nnever... even being young, following all the instructions and prescriptions, but I was never\nstrictly convinced that that was what I want to do. I was always looking on the broad world, and\nlife was for me, more interesting outside the religious life.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, no, no, no. I was, deep in my soul I was Jewish, but I found that we are living in a Polish\ncountry, this is Poland and this is our homeland and we owe to be loyal to our country. That\u2019s\nwherever I am, I found my obligation to be honest and I could avoid serving in the Polish Army\nwhich wasn\u2019t easy. It wasn\u2019t easy. It was very difficult. But it wasn\u2019t voluntary, because\nPoland was an Army which was called to the Army. That was not a voluntary army. You have\nto go, by twenty-one everyone has to go to the army except that somebody 1s unable to fulfill the\ndemand, sick and so forth. And a lot of my colleagues and a lot of Jewish people usually they\nstarted to do everything to avoid to go into the Polish Army. I didn\u2019t try it even. And I did it full\nhearted and I think it was my obligation to do it, because I owe it. I understand that it 1s a\ncommon responsibility when you are a citizen of a country, you live there, you have to do what\nbelongs. But politically I was never involved in any movement, never any movement.",
        "A: I loved Poland. I loved the country. It gave us opportunity and then that\u2019s it. I did what I had to\ndo.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\n5\nTape 1, Side B",
        "A: It was a time I was involved in Zionist organization. It was a time I thought maybe one has to go\nto Palestine those times. I will not deny there was not in Poland anti-Semitism. But you know\nanti-Semitism until today has many faces. There is an economic anti-Semitism, there is a\npolitical anti-Semitism and there is a racist anti-Semitism. And for me and my observance, my\nconviction, I think if I analyze the Jewish situation in Poland, it was more economic anti-\nSemitism, with some reasons, objective reasons. They were nobody\u2019s fault, but the situation\nbecame so that this anti-Semitism has his logical reasons, logical reasons, maybe it shouldn\u2019t be,\nmaybe it is nobody\u2019s fault, but it was. I cannot say there was a racial anti-Semitism. Well, there\nis in every nation, there are some extreme people, which they can get... and they are more doing\nit for personal reasons and for gaining something of it. And this is also the political anti-\nSemitism, which is to gain something to rule over people. You know? And Jews were more\neducated, absolutely more educated than the common people in Poland. Because as I told you\nbefore, I started to study when I was three. You know, and this gives, whatever you study, it\ngives you more advance about people which are just starting to study something at the age of\neight or nine or ten even. Some of them didn\u2019t go to school, the Polish people didn\u2019t go to\nschool ever. There was illiteracy, too. So, when it came to elections, the Jews, they knew what\nthey wanted. And the masses didn\u2019t know. Maybe it is until today a lot of masses don\u2019t know\nwhen they are going to vote, what they need and what they want. It is until today everywhere.\nBut especially in a country like Poland, which was, which wasn\u2019t so educated. There was a lot\nof people who didn\u2019t have, it was only by propaganda, which was from mouth to mouth, from\npromises and so forth, you know. And then Poland, I would need to go into the situation of\nPoland, how Poland became free after being occupied by three countries.",
        "A: Yeah, I understand. I understand, but the Jews even, in each occupied party, had different\nopportunities. In the Russian occupied part they couldn\u2019t progress like this we could make in the\nAustro-Hungarian or in the German occupied territory. So here comes the difference.\nEducation, knowledge and education, that was, is and that would always be the point. And this\ngave also the impulse for political views and for a kind of organized anti-Semitism, which for the\nJews, for the victims, it is not important what kind of anti-Semitism it is. He is anti-Semite, why\nand what, we didn\u2019t analyze and that wasn\u2019t important. We had to feel it and that what it is.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Ten percent was Jews. It was the same, approximately the same relative like it was, the\npopulation was about ten percent and there was about ten percent was in the Army.\n6",
        "A: It\u2019s difficult to say that you were discriminating because Army is not the thing which gives you\nthe time. You have so many things to do that you don\u2019t have the time to play these games. But,\nbut, the officers, the Polish officers generally, generally, were anti-Semites. What kind? They\nwere so educated, they were so prepared. That was the elite. That they, but of course, they\ndidn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t want to show up as anti-Semites. But you could feel it, you could feel it. Not\neverybody felt it. And then like I said, the poorer Jews went to the Army because they were not\nable to pay to get free from the Army, not to serve. The rich Jews who didn\u2019t want to go to the\nArmy, there was always finding a way of bribery. To whom? To the Polish officers, to the\nPolish doctors, to the Polish secretaries, so that they made themselves sick and they write and\nthey are sick and they cannot serve. And so the poor and little Jews were serving in the Army.\nThere were no too many of the intelligentsia which was serving in the Army. And then there\nwas another thing. After matriculation you are going to the officer\u2019s school. And in the officer\u2019s\nschool, they didn\u2019t want the Jews to become officers. They were there because they were, after\nmatriculation that was the law. So usually they find always a way to send them back to the\nnormal Army, not to live in the school to become an officer. There were officers, Jewish\nofficers, but very few, very few. It was difficult to advance, to be a Jew and to be an officer, a\nhigh officer in the Polish Army. There were higher officers only medical officers, because they\nneeded them. They have to take them and that\u2019s what it was.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. When the time came to go out, I got a phone from Krakow that one doctor who was by\nhimself a Colonel in the Polish Army, doctor, dentist. He had private office. He was ready to\nretire and he had a private office. But he got a heart attack and they took him to hospital. And\nthey phone to me, they knew that I would go liberated, if I will be able to replace him, to fill out\nthat position. So the last day in the Polish Army... and even the greatest anti-Semite in my unit,\ncame to me, they make me a party, my departure, that was ad hoc make a party for me. He came\nto me, he said, \u201cYou know I am twenty years in the Polish Army. I am professional officer, high\nofficer. I\u2019m a major there.\u201d He said, \u201cYou are the first Jew I know had such a good time in the\nArmy like you have. Like you had.\u201d And I said to them good bye, and I left. And immediately\nthe next day I came to Krakow and I start to work because I had to fulfill this, this... later on he\nwas released from the hospital. He survived and he came to the office, but I still was working\nwith him. He couldn\u2019t work anymore. So I was working with him about a year and a half,\nsomething like this. And then I opened my own office.\n7",
        "A: Oh yeah. I had a good time, well I got along. They were all, needed me because I was there\npracticing dentistry. After the first, first recruiting, six months, then later on I organize a clinic\nand I receive patients. So they had their families and they were coming to me and I had really a\ngood time. I came from the Army with some saved money, which the families of these officers\npaid to me for services. That was very, very, very little payments, but still I came with quite nice\nsaved money.",
        "A: In 1942, when we fled, went with the, on the Aryan papers, so-called. We came to a strange\nvillage there. And there the lady, which was the owner of the farm which we were given the\naddress from the priest to go. That was his sister-in-law. Where I was there on this farm, there\nthe Armia Krajowa started to organize herself. And we came there, and I went there as a refuge,\nrefugee from the occupied territory, German-occupied territory which occupied Poland from\nPoznan. I said I am from Poznan, and I am hiding away because I was a Polish officer and I am\nhiding from the German Army. So when they became knowledge, they turned to me and maybe\nI will join them. And I said, \u201cWell I cannot be a fighter to go and, with your fighting.\u201d I went\nwith them sometimes. But I organized a sanitary station, when some of them were wounded they\nbrought them to me and I gave them some bandages or some treatments, which I had a sanitary\nstation. And I also took care on the weapons which they had, and the magazine. They had some\nmagazine in hiding in the shelter. And they had some weapons there, which they organize\nsomehow. And I was taking, cleaning and taking care of it. And that was my function, I was\ngoing there and there, I was going close to every night I am going there and taking care of it.\nThere were some actions which I am participating, but I was never going in the first line to go to\nfight with the Germans. Never, ever.",
        "A: First of all, there was a case when somebody, the German has, in every village, in every town\nthey had... will you lay down? Lay down...",
        "A: I will approach to you a little bit. They had their spies which are spying what happens to the\nPolish people there. What they are talking about and what they are doing. And some of them\ndenounced that there is some activity, that they have some activity. And they choose Easter,\n1943, yeah? 1943 they choose to go to make an action and to arrest these Polish people who are\nin the underground. They knew from this people which they send in this Volksdeutsche and they\ntook there ten people. Between them was the commandant of this base. His name was Bilig\n(ph), Bilig (ph). He was a student of law, of the third year, second or third year. He was the\ncommandant of this unit there in this region. And there was other, there was a teacher and there\nwas several people. And one was liberated by the Germans. That was suspected that he was\ncollaborating with the Germans. They released him. The other nine were taken to Auschwitz.\nThis commandant was so beaten up that he couldn\u2019t survive. Because one of these people who\n8\nwas release, he saw him. That they took him from one room to other after hearings. They took\nhim. He was all blooding. He didn\u2019t survive. No one of them survived. So the commandant of\nthis part was the brother of this woman where we were working on this farm. His name was\nKostetski (ph). Max Kostetski (ph). And this lady, which we were there on this farm, she was a\nvery fine, noble person. She knew that we are Jewish. She knew because when we arrived there,\nthe brother of the priest was there, just there. And he was very angry. He said to the priest,\n\u201cWhat did you bring these Jews here? Why did you do it?\u201d And he run away very angry. And\nshe knew, but she was a very, very [phone rings] fine, noble person. And she tried to influence\nher brother. I am an officer and so forth. And she was helping us a lot with bread, with food,\neverywhere. Even when we later on, after the denunciation, we had to live in other place. She\nused to come to bring us bread and all kinds of things. She did help us. I think maybe fifty\npercent of surviving we had to thank her. She was very, very, very kind.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Oscietska (ph), Stanislawa Oscietska (ph). Her father was anti-Semite. Her husband was a\nterrible anti-Semite. And the priest was also an anti-Semite and still that was the priest who\nhelped us and gave us the paper.",
        "A: He was anti-Semite, but he was, in my opinion he was economic anti-Semite. However, he\ndidn\u2019t have a business. But in the church he was preaching the Polish people to support Polish\npeople, to buy at Polish people, but most of the businesses were Jewish. And therefore Jews\nwere calling all of this kind of expression, they were calling anti-Semite. That was economical\nanti-Semitism. They want to support their own people. I don\u2019t find it wrong. I don\u2019t find it\nwrong. I think he as a priest has an obligation to his people. How we didn\u2019t like it, how we\ndidn\u2019t want it, but still 1t did hurt us economically. But he, as a human being and as a priest, he\ntold us, \u201cI want to help you because it comes a bad time to you.\u201d So I cannot say he is a racist or\nhe is a political anti-Semite. He was economical anti-Semite. He was anti-Semite. We are very\nsensitive. We Jews are very sensitive, but we have the reason why to be sensitive after\nthousands of years of discrimination. But still, 1f you have a little bit brain and you want to\nunderstand human nature, you can find some objective reasons why some people are behaving\nso, and not like you would like they will behave. We would like to be taken care on us as the\nChosen People. But we are not the chosen, to take care on us. We are chosen because we have\nobligations. We choose to have the obligations. This is the chosen. We took the Ten\nCommandments, we took the Torah, we took everything, but we have to perform it. And if there\nis, you have to love your neighbor as yourself. You can never love like yourself, it is allegoric.\nBut you don\u2019t have to harm your neighbor. You have to behave. And that, which in many cases\nwe are missing. Even in the holy books we sometimes mention, \u201cWe are the Chosen People.\nYou can do to other people this and this and this. You can take interest by non-Jews. You can\ndo this, you can do this, but not to your brothers.\u201d And that was a segregation which was in the\n9\nTorah. There is segregation which we choose to make the segregation. This is the Chosen\nPeople, not only in the positive sense, a lot of things is negative. And therefore a lot of people\nwho are open-minded, they are taking the teachings of our fathers, not strictly verbally. You\nmake some selection. You have some humanitarian obligations as a human being, not blind to\nfollow scriptures, but you have to find a way how to live with people, how to respect other\npeople. Which is very, very important. How do you respect others, so others will respect you?\nAnd this is my conviction which I came after so many years of life and so many readings and\nstudying of all, all this which is written in the Jewish and in the non-Jewish books and teachings.\nWell it\u2019s not a... if you know , introduction, but I mean you have to know to whom\nyou are speaking. I think maybe sometimes I am going out of the framework which this has in\nmind, but I still am open-minded of everything what happens around.",
        "A: Pustkow.",
        "A: No, never. That was one of the miracles of this war maybe. There were no many Jews who are\nallowed to go in the camp and to leave the camp. And that was, by some miracle, maybe the\nreason was the German discipline, which they followed the orders of the Commandants, of the\nFuhrers. When I came to this camp, I volunteered. That was a working camp and therefore I\nwas put into this camp as a dentist. There was no big dentistry and there was no big medicine,\nbut still there was three medical doctors and there was rooms with beds, which in the beginning,\nwhich people when they got sick, even beaten when they were, they could come to the doctor.\nAnd they get care, they get care. In the beginning, even some times they were released from this\nto go to the town, to the little shtetl close to Debica there. There was other assignment to other\nworks. But that was already not in their competence. In the beginning, how strange it would be,\nthere was a Colonel, SS, who was the head of this health services there, Obersturmbanfuhrer (ph)\nSchumacher was his name. And then, but he was maybe for two or three weeks and started only,\nthat was only in \u201840. That was not yet nothing. That was the first beginning. And therefore the\nJews were slowly getting in circulating. They took him so easy, they took him so by easy. They\nwere voluntary, then later by force and later on by annihilation. They were going by themselves.\nThat was the system. And then after two or three weeks, he left. But that was an order officer.\nA lieutenant officer.\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\n10\nTape 2, Side A",
        "A: The Jewish doctors, they were the first. But if there were some people unable to work, they\ncouldn\u2019t release them. It has to sign, the SS doctor has to sign. And that what he was doing\nanother four weeks. But later on, they left it to the Jews, but the situation became worse. There\nwas no releasing. Treating and to work, treating and to work, no release anymore. In this time I\ncame to... when I organized this little dental clinic there, so called clinic, everything was\nprovisional.",
        "A: In 1940 already. The end of 1940 I organized it there. And what could I do? If somebody has\ntoothache, I could help, or to make an extraction, to pull out a tooth. And that was the things.\nThere was no other things, no fillings. I had to make fillings only when an SS man didn\u2019t want\nto go to the SS. They were not allowed to go to a Jewish dentist, not to a Polish even, nor to a\nGerman. They had to go to an SS. But they knew that they will have a special treatment at the\nJewish dentist, so some of them came. And that was a very difficult task, because I didn\u2019t have,\nI didn\u2019t have this equipment, which the German have. The German has the most modern and the\nmost equipment. The SS had the most modern. And there was a lot of cases,\nwhich I couldn\u2019t treat them at all, and I send them to go there. But they were insisting, they were\ninsisting. And so in beginning, that was about a year. I had an ID, SS ID, that I could come to\nthe camp and I left. The bus was standing, I show only the ID and I left. In the beginning the\ndoctors were also leaving, living in Debica. And coming only to work there.",
        "A: The Jewish doctors, yeah. And even some of the workers were allowed to go Saturday and\nSunday for a day home, but they have to come back. If they didn\u2019t come back, they brought\nthem by force and that was a terrible thing then. So, after a year approximately, there was an\norder to take the ID\u2019s, SS ID\u2019s from all the Jews. But I think, I am not sure, because I was there\na volunteer, there was an order of the Commandant of this camp, of the head, Gillar (ph) SS\nOberfiihrer, who gave, day order, which he gives to the soldiers every day orders. He said, \u201cThe\nJewish dentist can come to the camp whenever he wants. And every time when he comes to the\npost they will give him a post who bring him in the camp and when he is finished, he will come\nto pick him up and take him out from the camp.\u201d That was unbelievable. That was\nunbelievable.",
        "A: Because it was in the order. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I cannot comprehend it until today. I\ncannot understand it why.\n11",
        "A: No. No. I knew the Commandant, the head of the... Ill tell you, I mentioned before, the\nGermans were strict in their orders. I was a volunteer, and I was assigned by the working office,\nthe special working office, which gave the contingent for the camp, for the people. Bring them\nand give them to different works. And because of they gave me this job, I didn\u2019t belong to the\nSS, I belong all the time to the working office. And the head of this working office was a\nGerman, he became German. He was a German from origin. But he was Polish all the time.\nOnly when the Germans came in, he became a German. And he was an officer in the Polish\nArmy with a German name. Eilmiss (ph) was his name, Jule Eilmiss (ph). And he was very\ngood to me. I was very good to him. I gave him from time to time, I gave him all kind of bribes.\nAnd maybe they respect because I was affiliated to this, maybe this was the reason that I didn\u2019t\nbelong to the SS, I belong to the working. And that was the reason. And when I came to this\npost and I said, \u201cI am the Jewish dentist. I need to go to the camp, please give me company.\u201d\nAnd they give me an SS man, who brought me to the camp. By the entrance to the camp there\nwas another SS man, but he respected this SS man, he gave me over to him. He opened the gate\nand let me in. And when I was ready, I went to the office and I said, \u201cI want to go out.\u201d They\ncall to the camp, to the post, and the postman came and take me out from there. So, this is,\neverything is miraculous. Well, it is miracle that I am alive and that Iam here. But that was\nsomething which was really extraordinary. I didn\u2019t hear for a similar case in all my experience\nof camps and Jewish labor.",
        "A: My treating was only Jews. There was close to it a Polish camp for political Polish prisoners, but\nI didn\u2019t go in there and they couldn\u2019t come here. They brought in, once they brought in two\nPolish prisoners, too, which I had to give them some treatment. But the SS Commandant sit\ndown and took my treatment and the second Schaffner (ph) of the camp took my treatment. And\nother SS people came in my private practice home. Because I make in the house where I live\nlike this Polish peasants, I make also a little clinic that what gives me my income. A barter\nbusiness, people brought me food and I treated them. And so some of these SS people came in\nand they brought me also some tea, some coffee, because it was not on the market, even black\nmarket was not to get it. But the SS had everything. And they came in there, most of these SS\npeople which were, plus they knew me, because I was going into the camp, out and in, and out\nand in, so I was really tolerated in this place like persona grata.",
        "A: The Jews were evacuated earlier. The only Jewish family was my family which allowed, which\nthe Kreishofman (ph) allowed them to stay there. They allowed only me, but because the Polish\nofficer didn\u2019t understand German, so I take this opportunity and I left all my family there in this\nvillage. But there came the Final Solution and they want, nobody could, no Jew could be free.\nSo I would have to go to the camp. My wife, Fryda, had to go with all the family together to the\nghetto. From there they went to annihilation, as you know. Some of them went to the camp, to\nother camps, the brothers, my brothers. My three brothers came to other camps.\n12",
        "A: Ropezyce and from Ropczyce they send them immediately to Senczyczow (ph), which was the\nnext little town. And from there, about two weeks, they send them all to annihilation. I don\u2019t\nknow exactly until now. I think to Treblinka. I guess they went to Treblinka, all of them.\nExcept my brothers which went to the other camp, to Rzeszow, from Rzeszow to Mielec. From\nMielec there was the factory of airplanes, Hermann Goring Werke. And they were there. And\nthere my oldest brother was killed there by the Germans. And these two brothers survived. And\nthey were taken from there to Germany and they make all the marches and all the way through.\nAnd they survived in Germany.",
        "A: My Polish was better than all the Polish Polish. Our Polish was exceptional, very good.\nOtherwise the priests wouldn\u2019t give us papers. That was the basic things, appearance and\nlanguage, that was the things which was the most important. And there was no, any blemish in\nmy language and so till today the Polish people who come here and we are friends, Polish\npeople. They say our Polish is immaculate.",
        "A: Not at all. First of all, I adopted it very easy because living in a village, you are involved in the\npeasant\u2019s life. You want, you don\u2019t want, you don\u2019t have the time even, but still. And so I knew\nabout the habits and about everything how the Poles live. And we were living, even being\nOrthodox, my father was a very, very, very accepted in the community, in the peasant\ncommunity. They respected him very well and they came and they lived together. And my\nfather being an Orthodox Jew with you have seen. And he spoke immaculate\nPolish very well and so did all my family. And interesting enough, the children all were\nspeaking Polish home, only when father wasn\u2019t there. When father was in field, because we had\na farm, so my father was usually, in the summer time always in the field. As you know ina\nvillage there is always work, never endless, endless work. When my father came, approaching\nthe house, Yiddish, immediately Yiddish we have to speak at home, only Yiddish.",
        "A: Well the question of integration was more common in the shtetl, where there were around Jews.\nWe didn\u2019t have, our closest Jew was living a mile from us. A mile in Poland is like hundred\nmiles here. Distances are different. And the other Jews were coming to us to study religious\nthings by the teacher which we have in our house. And they were really poor Jews, poor Jews.\nIt is difficult to describe. Well, in the last years, the situation improve. But I remember as a\n13\nchild I came in the house of one of the oldest citizens in this village that has Haskila Ascheim\n(ph). And he had two sons... three sons, one went to the Austrian Army and later on to the\nPolish Army, because it was just a change from Polish liberalization. It was a widow with five\nchildren. Of course, the sons came to learn in our house. Not too much, not too much, but the\nbasic prayers, the basic prayers they learned. The other son had also five children and they were\nvery, very talented children, very talented children, but they didn\u2019t have the opportunity to go to\nschool, only to the community school, I mean to the elementary school. But they were\n, they studied by themselves. And this two sons became even writers and the\nlawyer in the village there. And one of the sons became a dentist. And the daughter married.\nNot that this is the point. The point is that this three sons with their families, in the beginning\nthere was here two children, here one child, the other one also two children. They were living in\none house, where there was only three rooms. Of course no bathroom, nothing like this. In\naddition, in the big hall, this old Jew had a pub. He was selling alcohol to the Polish people were\ncoming, drinking there. Everything in this one house. Later on they move on, they somehow\norganize them, their living. And they have their own houses. No one survived, as far as I know,\nof all these families. No one. Of all these villagers, no one survived. Only one son and a son-\nin-law went to America. But I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not more alive and I don\u2019t know if he had family. I\ndon\u2019t know. One grandson came also to America with a very tricky way. His father, who was\nalready in America, sent him a girl from the United States, which he married there, so he could\ntravel to America. But he\u2019s not alive. He died. He was a sick boy. Lyman (ph) was his name.\nNo one of all this family is around that I know, who survived.",
        "A: Jurkow (ph). Jurkow, by Szczow (ph).",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, Pll tell you. Thanks to this, my involvement in the AK, I could find a place after I had to\nescape because of the Gestapo which came. And thanks....the right place...",
        "A: Oh, and your hand. I have to support your hand.",
        "A: Therefore I wanted to take from you. I understand it. I give you support.",
        "A: Yeah, you'll feel it. [Laughing. ]",
        "A: Thanks to my involvement in the AK, I could find a place when I had to escape when the\nGestapo came to pick us up. That was the positive thing what I have of it. Well, I didn\u2019t\nexperience too many fights except one when it was already 1944, when our unit was affiliated to\na other unit and together we make an attack on a police station, German-Polish police station and\nthe dam of Roznow (ph). Roznow (ph), that was a big dam which they built on the Danube\nRiver, not Danube, but Dunajec river. That was a big dam. There was a little one later of in\nSzczow where in the beginning the Jews built it. But that was only in 1941, \u201842. But later on\nthey took away all the Jews in other camps. I don\u2019t know what they did to them. I don\u2019t know.\nAnd there was then a fight, which was quite a real fight with this police, but the Polish police\nhand over herself and the Germans, some escaped, some were killed. And that was the source\nwhere the AK gets more weapons there, from there. No, Iam not. You can hold it. I have here\nsupport. That was really when I, by my walking in the nights to the base where we have the\nweapons there, I met some of the AK men, which usually no AK men knew more than other two.\nThat was a conspiracy. And interesting enough, the main active AK man in our unit, which was\nreally an active guy, he was doing by himself a lot of things, he was a released criminal prisoner\nfrom Polish prison. And from him I got also for myself a gun, which I had one, but I didn\u2019t have\nenough ammunition for it. And he was the one who give me another gun and then I have some\nmore ammunition, some more for security. [Phone rings.] I didn\u2019t use it because I didn\u2019t need it,\nbut I was ready in case I will need it. I had a grenade and I had a weapon, I wouldn\u2019t go into\nprison voluntarily. I will kill some Germans and myself, that was my preparation to do.\nOtherwise I didn\u2019t have anything special.",
        "A: The only thing which I know, which came through me in the place where I was living, in the\nneighboring village was another unit of AK and there was a commandant, and all the orders who\ncame from the main office were passing from one unit to the other. And through me was passing\nfrom this unit, through me to my unit. And that was already in 1944, by the end of 1944. I\nusually tried to know what happens because I didn\u2019t have a radio. I was relying on the news\nwhich I got from the acquaintance, what they get to me. But from this, from this orders who\ncame, I found some orders what happens at the front. There was always messages what is to do\nand so forth. And the last message which I got, I opened it too. Then I close it and I send it\nfarther. There was a message, the Russians are approaching, not to hand over, not to give them\nover our units. And before they come in to clean up all the rest of the units of the people which\nare, which you will find in the forests, whether it is Russian partisans or other kind. It didn\u2019t\nmention exactly Jews, but who was there in the forest? That was the only thing which I have\npersonally met. From person to person, I didn\u2019t met, only I say the other two AK men and they\ndidn\u2019t know that Iam Jewish. They didn\u2019t know. And they, we never spoke about it.\n15",
        "A: Well that is difficult to say, afraid. But you are always watching what you are saying, what you\nare doing, not to be different. You have to drink alcohol, the moonshine like they are and to do\neverything like they are doing when they come together. Even if you don\u2019t know them, but you\nhave to go on the way like this. And if they are cursing, you have to curse, if 1t is damn, or\nanother. You have to be always, not try to be different, not try to be different, that\u2019s the main\npoint what you have to do. Scared? Of course, you are always scared. You know, when I was\nwatching and going walking in the night from one village to the other, if I heard a frog jumping,\nmy ears were so sensitive, I heared it. Because I want to know what happens around me, to be\nalways prepared and always the hand on the gun. And I didn\u2019t continue to go until I found out\nwhat is this noise, if it is not people. I find the frog and then I continue to go. That\u2019s it.",

        "A: I recommended to my commandant, I recommended my commandant to accept him. I also\naccepted the other one, who became the priest, the anti-Semite, which was. And this Muschau\nwas a very nice man, very nice man. And he was not like the common peasant. He was already\nmore civilized because he was working in France as a miner, several years. And he came up\nfrom France. He brought some furniture from France. And he was already more progressive.\nAnd we exchanged different opinions about the situation, the political situation. About the\nGermans, about the Russians, so forth. We were politicizing. He was inviting me in his home.\nWe are drinking and eating there. And he invite the neighbor. He has a neighbor there, one\nKilbasa (ph), who came also and they want to hear what happens in the world. And I have also\nsome news from my fellow man. So they accepted all the news from me as an intelligent Polish\nofficer and Polish patriot, of course. And that was always, with the alcohol, with moonshine. I\ndrank moonshine in my life, maybe I could make a bath in it and swim.",
        "A: I never allowed to be drunk. I always want to have my clear mind, because that was the most\ndangerous thing, to lose your mind. To be drunk. So when I felt, I run it out somewhere, I make\nlike I am drinking another one, another one, but I didn\u2019t drink it. But still it was quite a bit. I\nam happy that I could tolerate it as much as I could.",
        "A: Well you could hear. First of all, there was a situation about four months, more than four\nmonths. The Russians stopped on the river, they didn\u2019t cross the river Vistula to help the Polish\nresistance, the Uprising in Poland for political reasons. They want the Poles to be annihilated by\nthe Germans and then will go and kill the Germans. That was a very courageous thing to make\nfrom the Russian side. But that was a very, very bad thing instead to help to fight the Germans.\nThe Germans killed a lot of Polish people. And of course, a lot between them the Jewish, which\nwere fighting with the Poles, from the rest which remained there between the Poles. And we\nhave all the news about the uprisings. There was, in the bunker where the commandant, ours,\nwas sitting, they had a radio, which they are listening to Radio London, from London, BBC, they\nhave all the news and the movements of the Russian Army. And I knew in one day they brought\nto me, two English pilots, who escaped from the camp, from the German camp, and I had to\ntransport them to the Russians, because the United States had air bases in Russia. Because the\nUnited States were already allies with the Russians. And I was already, I said already good bye\nto Fryda and I was already on the way to go. But in the meantime when they came to the next\nbase they told me not to go farther because the field are mined everywhere. I will not be able to\ncross. So I left them at this Polish unit there AK where I brought them there and I came back to\nFryda there. And we are waiting the other four months and then you didn\u2019t need the knowledge,\n17\nyou heared the bombardment with the Russians started on the river there, from a distance to\nbombard artillery. And then they started to move. And that was it. And so we became so-called\nliberated.",
        "A: In the night.",
        "A: The AK didn\u2019t work in the day. They were always working 1n the nights.",
        "A: Oh well I came, it wasn\u2019t until late at night. It was till twelve, one o\u2019clock. And then in the day\nI was sleeping there. Where we had a shelter with Fryda there, over the pigs there. We had a\nshelter there and there we were sleeping. We had enough sleeping there. Enough sleeping.",
        "A: Oh no. They knew that Iam AK, and that I am officer, but no, they are not suspicious that I am\nJewish. No, no, no. Because the son, which is studying for priest. He was by himself, he said, if\nI will catch a Jew, I will cut in pieces and they should salt on it. As I said, he was a very, very\nbad anti-Semite. His parents were not anti-Semites. They were very simple peasants. They\ndidn\u2019t understand and think about it. Well, they boarded Jews and they went to the shtetl, they\nhad their acquaintance with Jews. But of course they preferred, they loved the Polish and the\nCatholic. It 1s normal, it is normal. But they didn\u2019t hate especially the Jews. But the son, which\nwas already studying priesthood and they knew already, they told him already, at this time they\nwere still teaching that the Jews killed Jesus and so forth. So, this young priest, no wonder that\nhe hated Jews. That was indoctrinated.",
        "A: It was a very, very, very mixed feeling. On one side you felt the Russians are coming, you will\nnot be more in danger as a Pole, but as a Jew, you continue to be in danger. And then came the\nreality. You find out what happened. Because until now, you heared only, they killed here, they\nkilled here, they killed here. But the disaster so big, you realized only slowly when you were\nliberated. When you came to the big city, Krakow, which has before the war, in the war even, in\nthe beginning, ninety thousand Jews and you barely find five or six people which are Jews. That\nwas a trauma which you couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t hand it. You were, and you were asking by\nyourself, why me? Why didn\u2019t Anna do what I did? You start to analyze and to understand and\nthose are things that you cannot understand until today. Because there were wiser people than\nme, speaking Polish better than me or the same like me, having connection with people. Why\ndidn\u2019t they survive? Why didn\u2019t they choose our way? Was it right we did? And what is the\n18\nrole we have to play by being alive? Try to organize a Jewish life, or forget about it? No Jews,\nno Jewish life. You are Polish. Go on, be a Pole. And that\u2019s what many Jews do it, did it. And\nthere are until today Jews which are living as Poles. They said, \u201cForget about it.\u201d But we\ncouldn\u2019t do it. Our roots are too strong. I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know what to do. We didn\u2019t\nknow what to do. We were poor like mices. We had to look, to find something to eat, not to\nspeak about finding a way to organize your life, to start to be a human being. You are out of it,\nyou are no human anymore. You start to realize you live surrounded in animosity. And you\nlook for some Jews. And I found some. I remember the first night we didn\u2019t have where to go.\nNo home. But somehow we met somebody. I don\u2019t remember. I think I knew these people or\nrecognize them as Jews. And I did ask him, \u201cWho else is here?\u2019\u201d\u2019 He said, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\nAnd I went with him, or with her better. And we came in a dark room and there were already\nseveral Jewish people, survivors from all kinds of surviving. And we sit there in this room, in\nthis dark room and started to sing Jewish songs, Yiddish songs, very nostalgical Jewish songs.\nAll the Yiddish songs were sad, all were sad. But in this moment, they were healing. They were\nlike Balsam on a wound. Remembrance for a moment, your heritage. And we passed this night,\nI don\u2019t remember, on songs and somehow sleeping sitting on a broken couch. All together there\nwere maybe six, seven people. And each one with his song, not with story. We didn\u2019t talk yet\nabout story. We, somehow, I don\u2019t know how to explain it. Is it shame or 1s it... I don\u2019t know.\nBut we are here. We left everything behind and we are sitting here. Nostalgia, remembering\nYiddish songs. Don\u2019t think even what to do, where to go farther. But we woke up in the\nmorning, woke up. We didn\u2019t take our work clothes. We were in the clothes which we had,\nthese poor clothes. We find out from one of them that one of my friends survived. Where is he?\nWho 1s it? He was before the war, he was a lady beautician parlor. Father was a barber, and he\nhad a nice sister. And I used to come to their house before the war. And he survived on papers.\nBut he was already in the Russian intelligence. Polish uniform, the Russian intelligence. And\nsomehow I met him. I don\u2019t remember exactly how. And I asked him, \u201cWhat is to do. Where to\ngo? I don\u2019t have a house. I don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d He said, \u201cI got back my apartment.\u201d\nThere are two bedrooms, a kitchen on the third floor in the Jewish section.\nBut he says, \u201cYou can go there. And somehow we will find there some way to sleep.\u201d But there\nwere already some people in, which survived Auschwitz. That was a girl, a boy, and another\ngirl. And then came other people. I don\u2019t know who this were. We all were there, but we didn\u2019t\nhave a bed to sleep. We slept on the floor. And I decided, we decided to look around, and we\nwent to my village. To this older woman, who took us on. And she fed us, she gave us to eat.\nAnd we left in their house some of our clothes, some of our furnishes. And she was already, she,\nnot her son, who lived nearby... because my mother, my grandmother, my brother\u2019s sister lived\nin her house and I lived in the son\u2019s house. There I make a little clinic there in his house. And\nwe went there to sleep in the night in his house. In the night, somebody was knocking at the\ndoor and the window. And there\u2019s, in Russian, \u201cKroy (ph)! Open! You have here Jews!\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cI don\u2019t have Jews. They are Polish people like you, like we.\u201d They came in. He opened,\nbecause this was soldiers which were in the camp, where there was once a camp. There was a\nfield hospital for wounded Russian soldiers. And this were wounded soldiers which were there\nin this, but they were strong enough to go in between the Poles and to make connections with\nthem. And I understand, I am not sure, I am ninety-nine percent sure. They went to the rich\nPoles where we left a lot of things and he told them to go there, the Jews came here. You have to\nkill them, very simple. And for them to kill a Jew is like kill a German. They like a soldier,\nespecially a wounded soldier, a front soldier. And they came in and said, \u201cAre you Jewish?\u201d\n19\nAnd I understand Ukrainian, too, because in the Polish Army where I served there were mostly\nUkrainians there. I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no Jews here.\u201d \u201cWho are you?\u201d We had the papers. Said,\n\u201cWe are here, only sleeping here. We are Polish.\u201d Well, okay, they left. They went to the house\nof the mother, the mother\u2019s house and they the same. \u201cWhere are the Jews here?\u201d \u201cThere are no\nJews.\u201d They gave some shots in the air and they left. In the morning we said to the son of our,\nwe told him to help us to move. We want to move back to Krakow. But there was no\ncommunication, there was no train. And I want to take some of this furniture to have something\nto sleep. So, he took the horse of his mother and the other horse from a neighbor and a wagon\nand we started to move to Krakow. That is about sixty miles from, hundred kilometers, hundred\nten kilometers, something like this.",
        "A: Our house was burned.",
        "A: It was burned. It happens when we were there still. After we left, close to the house there was a\nrailway and a spark of this coal fire fell on the house there and it burned. So, there were not\nhouse. And these Polish people, who used to live in the house, took over our house. He was\nliving in the barn which was close to it. There was a horse barn and coal barn and he was living\nthere. So for us he wasn\u2019t moving out and I didn\u2019t want him and I didn\u2019t want to be there. So\nwe Started the way to go. And we didn\u2019t want to go with the main road because there still the\nRussian Army was moving. And they were taking the horses from the Polish people for their\nuse.",
        "A: It was 22\u2122) no 25\" of January, 1945, after the Russians came in. We start there the way to\nKrakow. It is not describable the conditions. We had to take food for the horses first because\nyou couldn\u2019t buy this. Nobody would sell it. The money didn\u2019t have any value anymore. And\nthe horses, if you don\u2019t feed them, they will not go. And you have to have the food on the way\nback, too. So the most of the wagon was food. And we took also some of the furniture which\nwe left there and some of clothings we left there, also. They took it out from the ground, they\ndig it out. And they give us back everything, everything. They were very honest people. On the\nway my wife was more dead than alive. She was fainting and I had to do, to work on her. And\nby the way we were going around way, it was a longer way but more secure. ;\nwhere the army wasn\u2019t going. I knew the Polish geography very well. I know how I will get to\nKrakow by longer, around ways. We came to an ort (ph), which was called Zakroczym. First of\nall we passed a place which is called Tochow (ph). At Tochow there used to live a sister of my\nmother, with her family. Her husband, her daughter with her husband. I don\u2019t know how many\nchildren she had in the meantime. And the sons all run away to Russia, and they survived in\nRussia. The husband too, the old husband, too. But he died in Siberia, in Russia. They all were\nsent to Siberia to Infada (ph), to Sever (ph), to Jakutz (ph), or Jakutzia (ph). That was where\nthey banished all the criminals in the older country revolutions there. With all the history there,\nthere were trees which ten people have to surround it. Such a tree, such forest. And they\n20\nbrought them there and they said to them, \u201cHere you have to live.\u201d No houses. Their houses\nwere from snow, and their windows were from ice. And they had to work there, but all right\nthat\u2019s about them. That\u2019s another story. But I came to this Tochow. And I did ask the Polish\npeople there because no Jew was there, \u201cWhat happens?\u201d They said, \u201cAll were killed and some\nremained they were sent to the ghetto at Tarnow.\u201d That was the end. No one Jew was there. No\none Jew. So I continued to the next shtetl which was Zakroczym. And of course we have to feed\nthe horses. And we want to come down to move a little bit like I say to you, to try if we can go.\nWe were sitting on the wagon all the time. And this poor Polish guy, this Soltys Stanislaw was\nwith us, he was the foreman. And while we wanted to come down, Fryda fell down on the\nground, fainted again. I save her. I put her on the ground laying down, make some exercises\nwith her. Put her on the wagon back, she faint again several times. And when we fed the horses,\nwe went to continue to go. But the night approach and in the night you couldn\u2019t, you are not\nallowed because it is curfew. The Russians didn\u2019t joke. Whom they found on the street they\nkilled. So, I went to the first Polish house there where there was a little bit space...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\n21\nTape 3, Side A",
        "A: And she asked me what do I want? Said, \u201cWe have to go to sleep, to take in.\u201d And I took Fryda\nfrom the wagon and I tried to put her in and the woman said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I said,\n\u201cWell we have to warm her up a little bit, because she is sick.\u201d And she looked at her and said,\n\u201cWell what do you think? She is dead already. Better one to put in the grave, like she is\nlooking.\u201d But I took, outside I found a brick, an old brick. I put it, make a fire and warm up the\nbrick and I warm up a little bit. And so at this house, on the floor, we slept through until the\nmorning. In the morning we start to go, and we went and we came to Krakow. We went to this\nhouse of our friend there and we put what we have, these little furnishes on the dirt floor. This\nguy helped us, Stanislaw Soltys helped us. And he went back with the horses, back to his home,\nhe had to give back the horse to the neighbor. That was sacrificing. I don\u2019t know how he did it\nor why he did it. It was not human, that was angel work. In this time to go back, to endanger the\nhorses, which is all what the people have, a horse, a cart, but he did it. And she gave us a little\nproducts, half a bread, which was the big peasant breads, and some beans, some barley, and we\u2019 Il\nhave something to cook and to eat. That was our food at the beginning. And so we are being\nthere with all this people around us, other people living there. And Fryda went to the house,\nwhich was their house before the war, their apartment. And there was the janitor of the house,\nwhich was the janitor before the war. He was a carpenter working in their furniture store. A\ndirty, drunk man. And she said to him, \u201cMaybe there will come some post here on this address.\nWe are here living...\u201d and she gave the address where we are living. And he, \u201cAnd what will be\nif I bring you a post from your father?\u201d And she says, \u201cWell, you will get a hug and a kiss.\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cAll right.\u201d A few days later he came with a card, post card from Auschwitz. And he said,\n\u201cPana Fryda (ph), Miss Fryda, I get a kiss.\u201d And she give him a kiss and a hug. \u201cI got post card\nfrom your father.\u201d And we have this post card. You saw it I guess. And he is sick and he asks\nto come to pick him up. In the meantime, I met another acquaintance of me. He had a dental\noffice, quite a primitive office, but a dental office in an apartment which wasn\u2019t his. It did\nbelong to a Jewish woman before the war. She was even the owner of the house. And she and\nher daughter survived. But in this moment, she wasn\u2019t there yet. She was in a camp somewhere.\nAnd I met him and I said to him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell I have here a dental\noffice. But I\u2019m leaving this office. I want to sell it because I am leaving to the once German\nterritory. There I will organize a modern dental office, an apartment and I will be living there.\u201d\nHe married, he survived as a partisan. He married a Polish, Gentile woman. And he lived\ntogether with her. I guess he had some children with her already. But he was, he was a partisan\nin the Socialistic, not in the AK, in the AL, that was Armia Ludowa. That was the Volks party.\nAnd they were more lenient to the Jews. And he was a good fighter. He was a strong guy and he\nwas really fighting there, in this army. And he said, \u201cMy party will help me to organize there.\u201d I\nsaid to him, \u201cSell me your office here, for a begin, it will be good for me.\u201d He said, \u201cI will not\nsell you. I will rent it to you because maybe I don\u2019t find nothing there. I will come back.\u201d Said,\nOkay. I can\u2019t give you nothing. I don\u2019t have nothing. But for the first money what I will make\nas a dentist I will send it to you somehow.\u201d And I start to organize a practice. And I had first of\nall, aroom to sleep, a nice room to sleep with a bed, with a couch, quite a nice room and a nice\nkitchen. And that was for the moment a wonderful solution. But I started to think, \u201cIf he did it,\n22\nmaybe I can do the same. I will go to the German occupied, German-Polish occupied territories,\nPoland occupies German territories. And there were a lot of dentists and dentist equipment and I\nwill organize my clinic there. And to live there.\u201d And I went there, but I didn\u2019t find nothing\nwhich I would like. So I left Fryda there. We met there another guy, a survivor who was already\nworking for the Polish security, in the Polish security. He wrote a book about it. He lives here\nin the United States. He became a very rich guy here. And he became an officer. He survived\nin his village there. However they were trying to kill him from the AK, too. But he survived\nsomehow. And he was in this part which became occupied by the Russians first, the first month\nthere. And the Polish units there sent him to an officer\u2019s school and he became an officer 1n the\nPolish security. And then when the Russians moved, he moved with them. He came to Krakow.\nAnd he make a lot of, find a lot of Polish people whom, whom he gave over to, handed over to\nthe Polish security. But while the Russians occupied the German part, they sent him to Wroclaw\nas an officer there of their security. And then they send him to Lidnice, Lidnitz, where we were.\nAnd where I was looking for some dental equipment, he was working 1n his job to look for\nGermans. And we met. And we make a recognition as a Jew and he as a Jew. We didn\u2019t talk\ntoo much about it. He said, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d I said, \u201cYou can help me to find some...\u201d\nHe said, he\u2019 Il try.",
        "A: Well, I recognize him as a Jew. His name was Polish, Zalewski (ph). And when I met him, I\nsaid, \u201cZaleski, but what is your real name?\u201d And he was from Kolbuszowa, which was not far\nfrom my village, about twelve kilometer. That\u2019s about eight miles. It was quite close. And I\nknew people from Kolbuszowa. And he told me, \u201cMy name is Zalschitz (ph), Nafthali\nZalschitz.\u201d And he was called Tadek Zalewski, Tadeusz Zalewski (ph). But I left Fryda with\nhim, and I went back to Krakow to see how to organize life in Krakow. I found some instrument\nwhich I can use there. And when I came to Krakow, I found this, I have to go, well I mix up\nbecause I don\u2019t go chronological. Before we left I went to Auschwitz to take Father, her father\nfrom Auschwitz.",
        "A: It was no more camp there. [Phone rings.] It was liberated by the Russians. That was a card we\nhave that he was there.",
        "A: So I went there with the Russian trucks, I went there with taking ammunition to the front. There\nwas still war, but Auschwitz was already liberated. And he was the one who remained in the\nhospital there because he couldn\u2019t go farther. And he said better, they ask to leave, but he said\nhe preferred to stay here to be burned and not to go. And they shoot all the other people who\nwent there.\n23",
        "A: It\u2019s January, still January.",
        "A: Well, I knew from Polish accounting, but when I came there I found everything. I found\neverything. And when I saw him, I had all the history. That was a man who was taller than me\nand he was fifty-six pounds, I guess. I took in a blanket a heap of bones. And I was waiting for\na truck to take him to Krakow. But that was before we left to the occupied territories there. And\nFryda took care of him, and he came to his quite normal. But that was already February when\nwe left for... even more later, maybe March already. It is difficult now to remember the dates\nexactly. So we left Father in this apartment where we lived. We left to him. And we went to\nlook for, find some existence there with the idea maybe we\u2019ll take him over there to us.",
        "A: Not too much. All what Father-in-law told us. I didn\u2019t have the time and the courage to go to\nlook what happens around. But he had enough to recount his stories of what happens during the\ntime. But on the way back from this occupied territory to Krakow, I have a car accident. And I\nhave broken my leg, my hand here, and I was taken to the hospital instead to go home.\nSomehow I could let know Fryda that I am in the hospital. That was everything through people,\nwhich are communicating, commuting there and back. So, she came back. She decided to come\nback. She didn\u2019t have money, not even for to pay the Russians to give the vodka for commuting\nwith them. But while she was at this friend\u2019s house, he became our good friend, this officer, this\nTadek Zalewski. His wife, she was Jewish too, she survived also on Christian papers. She said,\n\u201cT can\u2019t give you anything money.\u201d She want to give her some jewelry, but Fryda didn\u2019t want to\ntake it. But while she was sleeping, she put in her bag a golden bracelet. And Fryda when she\ngot up, she said, \u201cWhat is this yet? I didn\u2019t have a bracelet.\u201d She said, \u201cTake it, you\u2019Il need it.\nTake it, youll need it. I don\u2019t need it now. Someday you\u2019ll pay me back.\u201d I don\u2019t remember if\nshe took it. I guess she took it and she came back to me, to the hospital. And she had to take\ncare of this poor father and of this poor husband. In the meantime, we got connection by mail\nwith a brother of her father, an uncle, Uncle Solomon in the United States. And when he heard\nthat his brother survived, that we survived, he open... in Krakow, an open account. \u201cHow much\nyou need, you can have and take.\u201d And there was the connection who gave us the possibility to\nsurvive further. But that was already a few months later, because mail didn\u2019t function so easy.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t think so much about Poland. I didn\u2019t want to stay with the Russians. I knew the\nRussians before. Poland I wouldn\u2019t mind, even, to stay, because I had my roots there, you\nknow? With all minuses I thought I would be able to organize a good life in Poland, even I\nthought in my dreams, on our farm. I said, I will keep the farm. I'll keep a clinic there, help the\npeople. And having a nice living on the farm. I love the farm too. We have a big farm, a nice\nfarm. And it was the nicest farm in the village. I thought sometimes that will be okay. But\nwhen I thought about the Russians and the system of their, when they bring in, I would not have\n24\nthe farm and I would not have my freedom so I start to think to move from Poland somewhere.\nSomewhere, the nearest approach was to Belgium, where Fryda has a brother of her father. In\nthe beginning we want to go to Germany, because one of my brothers, who lives now in the\nUnited States, came to visit us in Poland. He couldn\u2019t take us. When he came only for two or\nthree days. And he saw our misery there and he tried to help us what he could. And he said,\n\u201cCome in Germany we have apartment. You\u2019ll make a living there for time being. Come there.\u201d\nAnd we found a way where they were repatriating German families from Poland to Germany.\nSo there was a woman, she came to our house. She was making all kind of businesses, a Jewish\nwoman from Krakow. And she had the connection how to organize, to join people who want to\ngo to Germany with the German repatriates. We left our apartment. We went to Katowice,\nwhich was on the border to Germany. But when we came there, we were there two days, there\nwas no transport going to Germany. They already, the last transport left. And you have to wait\nanother month or two and I couldn\u2019t wait in Katowice there, so we decided to go back to Krakow\nthere. And in Krakow we stayed there until, I guess it was August, I guess, when we find a\nconnection which somebody make passports with a visa to Costa Rica for five hundred dollar\neach passport. And the uncle from United States gave us the money and we paid thousand five\nhundred. But we could get a transit visa through Belgium, because there was no straight flights.\nThere was no flight at all. You have to go by train to Belgium. And from Belgium you could\nhave gone to a flyer, a ship to Costa Rica. But when we came to Belgium, we remained in\nBelgium. And we stayed in Belgium for five years.",
        "A: My intention was to stay in Belgium, but even in Belgium I didn\u2019t want to stay. 1948 when\nIsrael was declared independent state, I was doing everything possible to go to Israel. I said I\ndon\u2019t want... the uncle sent us papers, everything to go to the United States. He wanted to pay\nfor my studies here and to upkeep us until I make my diploma here, but I didn\u2019t want to go to the\nUnited States. I want to go home, because after all Iam Jewish. There we have a state. I don\u2019t\nwant anymore to be a stranger.",
        "A: To be candid, we in our villages, it\u2019s more my nephews, organized a Zionist organization. And I\nwas quasi a member of this organization. But my brother was an active member and he even\nmade ha-shorah (ph). He was a farmer and he wanted to go before the war. But my mother,\neven before the war, somehow she said, \u201cThere is no future in Poland for Jews, let us go to\nIsrael.\u201d It was not yet Israel, still Palestine. Said, \u201cYou are a farmer,\u201d she said to father, \u201cand\nthe farmers are well off there.\u201d It was another kind of farming there. \u201cWe will make somehow\nmoney here from our farm.\u201d We could make then, that was a lot of money for our farm, ten\nthousand dollars. With ten thousand dollars in Israel you could do a lot, you could do a lot. But\nmy father said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want.\u201d He was much older than my mother. My mother was young.\nWith so many children he said, \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be difficult and impossible to make existence\nthere.\u201d And he didn\u2019t want to leave Poland. He was orthodox Jew. He said, \u201cI will go to Israel\nwhen Messiah will come.\u201d No Zionists. And my brother was prepared to go, but then there\ncame the war and he couldn\u2019t.

        "A: Well, the question of liberation is one of the most difficult time from all the past problems which\nwe had. We were, as I told you, living as Christians. And the liberation came. We couldn\u2019t\nenjoy our liberation or country. It was the greatest shock and the most difficult moment in our\nlives. That was the liberation. And especially if I want to put it in perspective, the differences\nbetween people who survived camps and people who lived on so-called Aryan papers was very\ndifferent. We have two things to overcome. The first 1s, which we had all the time, that was the\nfight for existence and how to survive, of course. And the next, when the liberation came was\nthe shock to find the reality. You don\u2019t have where to go. You couldn\u2019t find nobody you know,\nor anybody of your people. You suddenly find yourself, you cannot stay in the place where you\nwere. We were in a village, not ina town. We were ina village. And if I... realize it was a\nhostage village. They were not sympathetic to Jewish survivors. However I survived, not a Jew,\nbut suddenly I felt that Iam back a Jew. But I couldn\u2019t officially declare it. I had to stay on my\nAryan papers. And how to go and where to go? Because to go to my other village where I was\nborn there, I wasn\u2019t sure that I will be accepted. And I wasn\u2019t sure to go to Krakow, for\nexample, because I didn\u2019t have where to go. Even not where to sleep at night. And you don\u2019t\nhave money. And you don\u2019t have nothing because whatever you had you have already sold out\nwhatever you had. So, that was the most terrible time in all this events which we had, the so-\ncalled liberation was the terrible hit of the reality. You were hit with the reality. Not where to\ngo and not what to do and how to start. Will you be accepted as a Jew? You cannot go on and to\nsay you are not a Jew, because really where you go they know you are Jew when you come to\nthe places where I used to live. And to stay in a strange, foreign surrounding like we were\nbefore, so I have to stay like I was all the time, a peasant, a farmer. To watch the horse and the\ncows. In reality I was a dentist. I want to go back. I didn\u2019t have nothing with me, but I have to\ngo to start to look for our existence. And as I said before already that part, I went to the village\nwhere I was born, and then later when they went with us to Krakow, all this trouble I have with\nFryda and when I came to Krakow. But the question of this liberation, to explain it in a very\nsimple term, that was the greatest shock of everything together. But when I came to Krakow,\nwhen I started to settle as I said, I have been there, different places, start to organize my life.\nAnd with the help of the uncle which came, we went to Belgium as I said. And in Belgium we\nbecame refugees. We became as one of the United Nations refugees. We registered there and I\nhave my register card as a refugee from the United Nations. And I got the permit because I had a\nvisa only to stay there, transit visa to pass through Belgium. But because I was recognized as a\nrefugee, they gave me time to stay three months there. In three months I had to renew my stay in\nBelgium. And we were under the auspicion of the foreign police, a special department, the\netranger (ph), police etranger. And they gave us another stay of three months.\n27",

        "A: Oh that was a man, that was Muschau. He was recognized as a righteous man, the righteous\nbetween people. I gave him to Yad Vashem, and he is recognized. He was a wonderful person.\nHe helped us all the time, even the time when he didn\u2019t suspect us as Jews, he was all the time\nvery human and very helpful.",
        "A: We stayed with the sister, but it was a very terrible accident. The last, the last bullet, the Russian\nbullet got his hand, his left hand. Because his house was on the, on the border. Where the front\nwas standing between the Russians and the Germans and there was heavy fire because there was\nthe Dunajec river. And he was close to this river, not far. So he decided, the frontier between\nthe Germans and the Russians, which was standing about four or five months was very close to\nthis place. And his house was under fire, so he decided to come to his sister place, and while he\nopened the door, a bullet cut his left hand. And he was bleeding and because he knew that the\nunderground station, sanitary station was in my place, so he decided that the neighbor took him\non a wagon and he brought him to me there to give him first help. And I cut him. It was\nhanging on the skin, this hand. I cut on this and I bind around that he doesn\u2019t bleed out and I\nwent back with him together and brought him to his house. And there I found out a really\nsurgeon doctor was hiding there in the underground army and they brought him to this house. I\ngave him the anesthesia, whichever it could be a little bit chloroform. But most anesthesia was I\ngave him alcohol. We had there moonshine, moonshine. And he was drinking so he was out of\nconscious. And this surgeon bind him, all these veins and arteries. First of all, he cut him a little\nbit of this arm farther because it was already gangrenous, gangrene, because where I bound it\nthere it started, it is very fast process. He cut it there and bind all the arteries and veins and so he\nsurvived. And then I didn\u2019t go more to the place of the sister, but I stayed with him and took\ncare on him all the time. So he survived and he was thankful to me and I was very thankful to\nhim. So it was a very, very good occasion to serve this man, this very nice person.\n28",
        "A: No, for the first two days she stayed still with the sister there. But later on she came here, we\nbrought here. The front was standing there fora moment. There was a fight there. The\nGermans run away. They left only some guns, automatic shooters. And these were not origin\nGermans. This were Russians which were collaborated with the Germans. And they were\nmaking the last fights with the German. And there in this house just, we were there. The\nGermans caught the first Russian soldiers who came in, and they bind them together and they put\na grenade between them and they kill them there, on the garbage there.",
        "A: I saw it later, after I saw them there. The Germans came in, you can come take in the shoes if\nyou need from this people. And then the Germans escape, of course. That was the end of this\nfight there. And after several days we went there, to the sister there. We took a little bit of what\nwe had, our clothings and we left there, from there. And then we are looking on occasion\nsomehow to go to Krakow and to go to my village there and to organize this life like I said.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t tell them and for a long time they didn\u2019t know, until... I don\u2019t know exactly when\nthey started to realize that I am Jewish. But when the war passed my village where I was, the\nwar continued. It was January twenty-one and the war was continued until, as you know, until\nMay. So here was all the time moving Russian trucks and armaments and soldiers. That was the\nonly way, with the soldiers for a bottle of vodka, which we could have some commuting to\nKrakow or to the other villages. It was also very dangerous. They were also not very\nsympathetic to Jews. Sometimes Fryda stand in the line to get a ride to the village there for some\nfood to these Polish people. So there was standing a lot of people and waiting for this ride. So\nthe Russian driver which was taking said, \u201cYou yes, you can go. You yes, yes. But you no, no\nJews, no Jews, no Jews.\u201d Even the Russian soldier. So there is no big difference between one\nand the other one.",
        "A: First of all, they didn\u2019t realize who is a Jew or no, except that they really recognize by\nphysiognomy, they saw it is a Jew. And then in reality they were not more, well they didn\u2019t have\nin their program to kill Jews. That was individual soldiers, some of them which were, I don\u2019t\nknow, they were from some other nationality as Russians or Ukrainians or Belorussians or\nLithuanians or Latvians. There were all kinds of soldiers there. So that was more individual and\nthen it was also sometimes inspired by some other anti-Semites to go to kill a Jew. The Russians\ndidn\u2019t hesitate to kill a Jew, too. However it came in the Polish Army, which was a Polish unit\nin the Russian Army. In this unit there were many Jews, I mean for us, many... five was many.\nBecause we used already without Jews here in this side, the German side. But there were some\nJews and the times when the Jews didn\u2019t hear, you could hear... I understand Russian and\nUkrainian, too. So, I could hear how they were expressing themselves anti-Semitic even to their\nofficers and to their sergeants. \u201cThese dirty Jews,\u201d and so forth. So this is the reality like it was.\n29",
        "A: In this village, I came to my village where I was origin. And I told you already before in this\nstory, that they send in somebody to kill us. And I didn\u2019t go back there to my village anymore.\nFryda went several times for food, but she never slept there. She went to the shtetl and in the\nshtetl were already three or four Jewish families. And between them was one, my niece, she\nlived there. She came there back to the shtetl there, and she had already a room there and she\nslept with her. And the next day she came back to Krakow. When she left I wasn\u2019t sure I will\nsee her tomorrow. It was a difficult time even after the liberation. Even after the liberation.",
        "A: That was already in Krakow. Well, you cannot say group, they formed a group. They find each\nother and because one of them has a place, so we came there. We could there sleep at night.\nAnd with no soldier, we were sitting and singing old Yiddish songs because we couldn\u2019t sleep.\nThe horror on our heads was so terrible that we couldn\u2019t sleep even. Like taking, by the time,\nhow to spend the time.",
        "A: No, no, no. I never knew. I never knew these people. I never knew these people. That was only\ntwo or three days, until, as I told you, we find the place of my friends there, which they were\nalready coming survivors from Auschwitz after the liberation. Young people which were living\ntogether there. Sleeping there on the floor for a time. Somehow that you have, because in the\nevening there was curfew. You couldn\u2019t go in the street, you have to be someplace. So that was\nthe place where we could run away. And that was a very happy occasion to go in.",
        "A: Well when we came to Belgium. We founded there, because we came with Fryda\u2019s father, he\nfound there his brother, who survived in Antwerp. And he used to live in Antwerp before the\nwar and he was in Antwerp quite a known person. He was in the diamond business. And he was\npoor, but he already contact his other brother, younger brother in Holland, in England. The\nyoungest brother, who changed his name from Himmelblau to Hill. And then he became\nrecognized by the Queen as a British officer, decorated. And he already makes good business.\nHe was quite already a rich man. And he did help him. And also this uncle from the United\nStates, he opened us a place in Antwerp where we can take the money, how to survive our time.\nBut I didn\u2019t want to be supported. I organize, even illegal, a little clinic, and I treated Jewish\npatients, refugees who came there. And there was a yeshiva, an orthodox yeshiva, which I treat\nwithout money this all students there. And I don\u2019t know if I told you, one day came in a student.\nAnd you know whoever it comes you started to talk, \u201cWhere from are you? How do you\nsurvive? Where did you been?\u201d And there came in a yeshiva boy. A nice, pretty wonderful\n30\nboy. And I ask him, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And he said, \u201cWell, I am from Krakow.\u201d \u201cFrom\nKrakow? We are also from Krakow.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d He was happy to hear that we are from Krakow.\n\u201cWhere did you live in Krakow?\u201d He said, \u201cWell in Diver (ph) Street, number four,\u201d and this\nhouse was the Himmelblau house of the house of my wife\u2019s family. And I remembered his\nfather. And Fryda knew his brothers and sisters, they were living in the same house for so many\nyears. And he started to cry and Fryda started to cry. I called in Fryda. In my clinic, I had a\ncorner in my bedroom where I put in an engine, a foot engine and actually did the patients,\nsomehow. But slowly I make a living off it and I had a possibility to make a decent living. So, I\nstopped the help of my uncle. I didn\u2019t want to be supported. In the meantime, as we have been\nthere for close to two years, Israel was established. And I was already connected with the\nZionist organization there in Antwerp. I was a member of the committee there. So I said, \u201cI\nwant to go to Israel.\u201d Well, Fryda\u2019s father didn\u2019t want to go. He preferred to stay in Antwerp.\nWell, he knew the languages and he had his brother there and he had the support from this two\nbrothers, so he decided he will not go with us. In the meantime, our son was born. He was\nalready two years old.",
        "A: Henry Edward. He lives now in Texas, in Austin, Texas. He grew up in Israel. My uncle from\nthe United States sent us a visa and he even want us to come to the United States. And he\u2019ll pay\nour upkeep, my studies, so that I will be independent and we can live in the United States. But I\nfound that our place, after all we survived and surpassed, my place 1s Israel. This is the only\nplace for a Jewish person to live. That was my conviction.\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\n31\nTape 4, Side A",

        "A: Well, organizing young people who came there, many refugees from Poland, from Russia, from\nGermany. They start to come from all places there. And then they came from Israel. There was\nthe Israel soldiers which are serving in the British Army. They were in Europe and Germany and\neverywhere there was fighting against the Germans. And they are the people who helped us to\norganize the people to go to Israel. And quite a number of them went to Israel. Some of them\nremained in Belgium, some went to Australia, some went to America. But as I later heard, many\nof these young people who went to Israel became soldiers, even they were unexperienced\nsoldiers, only to fight for freedom. And most of them were killed in this fight because they were\nnot experienced soldiers. But Israel need everyone there in this time. It was a very hard time\nthere in Israel, too. And when I decide we are going, we organize. We brought everything,\nbecause in Israel we knew there is nothing, refrigerators and the stove, furniture, hardware, what\nwe need for the kitchen for a living. We took everything. We took several lifts and we went to\nMarseilles by train. And from Marseilles we went by boat, by the Kadma (ph). It was quite a\nnice boat. And that was my son\u2019s second birthday on this ship. The captain make him a party,\nwell, kind of party, a reception for our son there.",

        "A: 1948. No, 1951, excuse me. 1951, because \u201849 our son was born. When Fryda was pregnant we\ndidn\u2019t want to go for this experience. We were waiting that he will be able to make this\ntransport. In April of \u201851 we left for Israel. We were so far fortunate that our friend from\nAntwerp, who 1s also from Krakow, left for Israel a year before us. And he rented a house there\nwith two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom. And they invited us that we would be able to stay\nwith them for the first day until we find a place to stay. Because that was no other way. And we\ncame to them, we stayed with them. And the lift arrived. There was a yard there, we could put\nthe lift there. We were searching for an apartment. And we rented an apartment, which was a\nliving room and a bedroom, a hall, a kitchen and a bathroom. That was all.",
        "A: Pardon?\n32",
        "A: Givataim, a suburb of Tel Aviv. We didn\u2019t want to go to Tel Aviv. First of all, it\u2019s a big town\nand everybody was going to Tel Aviv. And that was a settlement which was in development and\nthat was, to compare, a little bit cheaper. And I didn\u2019t have enough money to buy an apartment.\nWe rented an apartment. And we organized there. I organized in these three rooms, the hall was\nthe waiting room, the bedroom was the clinic. And there was a bed which was in the day, closed\nlike a cabinet. In the day I could accept patients. And the living room was the bedroom for us.\nWe were sleeping there in the bedroom. And the child was there. There was a terrace. It was\nnice. After working there about two years we rented, just close, became free another big room\nand a kitchen and a little hall. So we rented this, and... excuse me. We bought it. I bought it.\nIn the meantime I bought this apartment where you are renting. I bought this apartment. And I\nmade of both of them one bigger apartment and a separate clinic. And life became more\ncomfortable. We organized a very nice apartment and a very nice living in this room.",
        "A: Well maybe it is not known in the world and people are more concentrated on Poland and Polish\nanti-Semites in Germany. But Belgium, which seems to be more sympathetic to the Jewish\ncase... in Antwerp, where there was quite a number of Jews, when you were looking for an\napartment for rent, it was in the windows written, \u201cNot for foreigners.\u201d And that meant not for\nJews. In some of the apartments was written exactly what I said, \u201cNo Jews.\u201d And I in the\nmeantime learned to speak Flemish, which was the language in Antwerp, because Brussels was\nmore French. But Antwerp was Flandria. That was the the part of... Belgium has two nations,\nValonia and Flandria. The Flandrians were more, more German sympathetic. They were\nGerman oriented. Valonians were more French oriented. And Jews which were saved in\nBelgium, they mostly were more saved in this part which was Valonian. In Flandria there was\nimpossible to survive. We came, rented an apartment. And still we were all the time renting\nthere. And that was a nice apartment. We love it. And the administrator showed us the\napartment and the conditions where it was not expensive. It was nice and the place was nice.\nAnd when it came to write the lease, he says, \u201cYes, but you are not strangers.\u201d And we said,\n\u201cYes, we are strangers. We are from Poland.\u201d And he said, \u201cBut you are not Jews?\u201d I said,\n\u201cYes, we are Jews.\u201d So, \u201cI am sorry, I have instructions from my... I am not the owner, from the\nowner, no Jews. I am sorry, no Jews.\u201d And that gave me a lot to think about it. Around you see\nno friends, no friendly, no foreigners, no Jews. So that means there is no place to live here for\nthe Jews. However there is a lot Jews remained there and lived there. They didn\u2019t care about it.\nBut I was, I don\u2019t know, personally more sensitive realizing this problem. I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\nwant to be, that can happen the same everywhere.\u201d And therefore I decided to go home. I said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one place where nobody would tell me as a Jew you have to live. You have all the\nrights.\u2019 And that was the reason.\n33",
        "A: Yeah, it was the general Zionist movement. General Zionist movement. Not labor, not\nrevisionist, general Zionist. That was in this time a general Zionist organization.",
        "A: Yes. After I became involved in my profession. In the dental association I became one of the\nactive members in the management of the organization. I became vice-president of the\norganization of the dental association in Israel. And because a big part of Jewish dentists in\nIsrael, their origin was countries where they spoke German. If 1t was Czechoslovakia, even\nPoland, they spoke more German than Yiddish, or even Yiddish, they could understand German.\nAnd there was a necessity, there was not world literature in Hebrew in this profession. And we\nwere interested as these people became more educated and more acquainted in the profession,\nwhich made progress terrible. Progress during the five years and then later on and on all the\ntime. And there was English literature, which the people didn\u2019t know. I spoke already a little bit\nEnglish, but not enough to be fluent in literature or to give a lecture in English. The University\nhas some professors which were lecturing in English. But for the mass, I mean for the majority\nof the dentists it wasn\u2019t understandable. So we needed German-speaking lectures. And time by\ntime, we start to bring in from Germany lecturers, professors. And so I became acquainted with\nthese professors. And we started to exchange normal relations between them. So we started\norganize even at the universities in Germany, some courses for the occasion, for progress, for\nprofessional progress. So we make a course in Bonn. We make a course in Berlin. We make a\ncourse in Munich. We make a course in Marburg on the Lahn. It was in Frankfurt also some\ncourses. Some from time to time there were a group of twenty, thirty people who can afford it,\nwho are going only for education there. And that was the reason. And so I went with this group\nthere. And I went to Bonn where I stayed for three months there. And I make my, my\ngraduation doctor there in Bonn and then Marburg. That was the two universities. Marburg was\na general university and Bonn was only a dental school. So here we got a dental license as a\ndental practitioner license and here you make your doctor up in Marburg. So you are a doctor\nand a dentist, both of it.",
        "A: No, I haven\u2019t been a doctor until this time. I be only a dentist, a licensed dentist in Poland. A\nlicensed dentist in Poland.",
        "A: In general, the staff of the university, of each of these universities, they were very, very\nforthcoming and they were very gentle and very willingly to help us. Even we knew that some\nof them were with a Nazi past. The more Nazi they were before the war or during the war, the\nmore forthcoming they were after the war. They didn\u2019t know, they said, about anything what\nhappened before. And they were always good with Jews and they had good relations and even\nthere at the university there were professors Jews and so forth. In Bonn, for example, the head of\nthe school was Professor Kirkhaus, which was known that he was a member of the Nazi party.\n34\nAnd he was the first one who quit the Jewish professor who was there. I don\u2019t remember this\nmoment what his name was.",
        "A: I can hardly say that you were angry, because nobody forced you to go. You have to, to have\nyour attitude, you come there, you have to accept the reality. Of course, you knew exactly that\nyou are stepping on the burning ground. You know this is not the place where you should be.\nBut it is not only there. You start to think with the real terms even then already. This is the\nreality of life and this is the future of life. If you want to separate and if you want to be\nsomebody else, chosen for something. There is no place for you on this world. You have to\naccommodate it to the future life. And this is the future life. This is the future. Now you see\nwhat happens. Israel has relations with Germany, with France. However we know there are still\na lot of anti-Semites. And they are everywhere. They are everywhere. But they are not because\nthey are special anti-Semites. There are anti-blacks, there are anti-yellows, there are anti-Asians,\nthere are anti, all kinds of antis. This is the reality of the world now. You know, it sometimes is\nfor me difficult to accept the general view of the Jewish world about the Polish anti-Semites,\nabout Poland. I born in Poland. I got my education in Poland. I lived there. And I was a Polish\npatriot. And so were many, the majority. There were some Jews which didn\u2019t accept never that\nthey are Poles. And to say that the Poles were all anti-Semites, I will not put this category, put\nthem in this category. There were some interests. And people are behaving very often, very\ndifferent in different situations. But to say a priori all the Polish are anti-Semites, it is\nexaggerated. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not true. But the same you can say about Jews. They are anti-\nArabs, they are anti-Poles or anti-this. There are Jews who are anti-Jewish. Everything exists.\nBut mainly I don\u2019t know how to categorize it, even with my most sophisticated thinking, I think\nin every human body there is some anti, some anti. Anti- this, anti-him, anti, is it anti-blacks or\nsome blacks? Or anti-yellows or just some yellows? Anti-Asians. There is in every human\nbeing, there is an anti. But you have to come to some point that you are living in this world,\nwhich 1s very differentiated and if you will not accept this, there is no place for you. Because\nevery day brings surprises. We are not done with wars. We are not done with discriminations.\nIt was, it is and it will be forever, forever.",
        "A: Well, this question is a very sensitive question. When you came to Israel, how difficult it 1s to\nsay, there was a gap between these born Israelis, long living in Israel and newcomers in Israel.\nLike everywhere, a stranger gets feeling of a stranger. You are a stranger for a while until you\nare not accommodating to the reality. And then some gap, some gap, it is sixty years after\nestablishment of Israel state, fifty-two years, but there\u2019s still differences between born Israelis,\nlongest living Israelis and new coming Israelis. Is it good? It is reality. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\nknow. Maybe it is human nature. It\u2019s this kind of jealousy. But in the beginning when you\ncame in, the feeling was a little bit different, because a lot of people in Israel, living in Israel, not\nborn in Israel, but living in Israel for many years, who were the elite in Israel, came from Poland,\nRussia, maybe Czechoslovakia. Some came from Germany, too. Zionists. They felt the elite,\n35\nand you felt when you came in with a feeling how could you survive? You must have done\nsomething which 1s not right, that you could survive the Holocaust. Because my parents, my\nuncle, my grandparents, my brother, my sister, they were killed. Everybody. Nobody is here.\nAnd you survive. You must be guilt of something. You have to feel this guilt.",
        "A: I heard it. It wasn\u2019t meant maybe special straight to me, but I heard it. I heard it in a quite clear\nvoice. These people who survive, they were collaborating with the Germans. And that gave you\na very, very strange feeling, very bad feeling.",
        "A: I was maybe more fortunate than the majority of this newcomers. First of all, because I was\ninvolved in the Zionist organization and secondly because I knew the language. And that gave\nme a very great advantage not to be singled out. That was worse with people who couldn\u2019t\ncommunicate. And they had to communicate in other language, which was in Yiddish or in\nGerman, and the Israeli-born children didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. They didn\u2019t want to speak Yiddish.\nI think they\u2019re quite chauvinistic. I think they are quite chauvinistic. And the same thing can be\nsaid about the long living in Israel. They were maybe not so chauvinistic as they were the best\none, the good one. \u201cWe came here and we built this country. We fought for this country and we\ngave us acountry.\u201d You know, that was also a very strange feeling. A very strange feeling. But\nwith the time you got used to all kind of treatment in your society.\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\n36\nTape 4, Side B",
        "A: It\u2019s not only me, but usually people are always closer to their landsmen. Coming from Poland,\nget with the Polish people. Coming from Hungary, are living with the Hungarians because of the\nlanguage. I cannot say. We had people from different, from Hungary, from Romania, from\nCzechoslovakia, from Germany. And in reality, the most educated people which we met in\nIsrael, which were the leading intelligentsia in Israel, they were original from these countries.\nFrom Germany, coming from Germany. Because the aliyah which came to Israel from the Arab\ncountries, they were merchandise mostly. Very, very, very few which were professionals. They\nall business men, all handy people, making something for a living. But in general, there were the\npoor people who came, that were the first who came into Israel. That was the big problem. They\ndidn\u2019t have the language and they didn\u2019t have the... for them life was very difficult when they\ncame poor. So there was difficult for apartment. They built temporary shelters for them. And\nthey were living in these shelters for several years until they somehow came out there. There are\nsome of them living until today. Some of them built houses on the places where the shelter\nhouses were. They allowed them to build, so they gave them... because most of the land were\nbelonging to the Keren Kayemeth. So they allowed them, these people to settle on this places\nbecause the government wasn\u2019t able to give them stable living. So there are some slobs until\ntoday and there are some which built nice houses. And of course, with the time, the new\ngeneration there went to school and they make progress. And a lot of them came with their\nreligious leaders, with their Rabbis. And then they settled in their own circles. And this is now\nIsrael\u2019s greatest problem, is their religious Orthodox problem. With the Sephardic, Sephardic\nthose are those, Sephardic in reality means the Spanish people. They don\u2019t have nothing to do\nwith Spanish, except maybe their ancestors came from Spain. But generally they are Arabic\nJews and they learn quite fast, Hebrew. And they arrange their life very nice. And they make\nterrible progress, very, very nice progress. But the problem of Israel is not solved and will never\nbe solved in my opinion. That\u2019s war... my son, for example, was in two big wars, in the Six-\nDay War and the Yom Kippur War. And that was one of the main reasons that he left Israel.\nHe said he had enough of wars, when he came to the United States for studying his business, so\nhe found that he would be better here. And he stayed here. And therefore we are here. We\ncame after him, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t be here in the United States. I would be here in Israel\nuntil today. And I\u2019m not sorry that I did it, because I\u2019m not sorry of one step in my life. I don\u2019t\nlook backwards. I take the reality. Iam here happy. I live happy. And so is my son. I have two\ngrandchildren. My granddaughter graduated now from the University here in Kentucky. But she\nlives also to Austin, Texas, where my son lives. And our grandson is in Virginia Beach. So now\nwe are without children and without grandchildren, but we have here very good friends. And we\nare happy here, making our life here.",
        "A: Well the first years, I myself couldn\u2019t talk about it, neither could my wife. And she 1s until today\nnot so outspoken. And for her the language barrier in Israel was very difficult, very difficult.\n37\nShe learned the daily language, but usually she couldn\u2019t live a cultural life, except going to\nconcert and eventually from time to time with me to the theater. But usually it was a barrier for\nher. But we have a society where she could speak Polish, where she could speak German. And\nwe had very wonderful company, very good friends. And then concerning our son, it came when\nhe went to school, to elementary school. He asked in the first grade, he asked about whether we\ncould help him with something in his homework. And mother told him, \u201cI\u2019m sorry but go to\nFather because I don\u2019t know.\u201d So he ask a very simple question, \u201cMom, did you ever go in your\nlife to school?\u201d So it is difficult to say that we spoke with him about the Holocaust because it\nwas a painful thing to go on to put it on your children. But of course when he growed up, when\nhe went to high school and later on to military, he realized what happened and he asked some\nquestions. But not too many, not too many, not too many. And I think until we came here, to the\nUnited States, he learned more about all of this than all his staying in Israel.",
        "A: Well, I, I cannot agree with this what you ask for. My culture life in Israel was very, very\ndeveloped. First of all in the professional way because I was very active in my profession and I\nstudied a lot. And except of which I went to concert and I went to theater, all Jewish theater, I\nmean Hebrew theater. I understood and I could take it. And then I had a very rich library in\nHebrew language and I was reading in Hebrew and for me Hebrew became my, really to say, my\nfirst, or my second language if I would say the truth, because the first always remains the Polish\nlanguage which you have your basic education.",
        "A: You are right. In the first maybe ten years there was no talk about the Holocaust. Later on bit by\nbit it came out and they start to open more the world and exchange of knowledge of the world,\nwith all other countries in Europe and the United States. And the Jews from the United States,\ntourists used to come, family members looking, searching for family and some of them finding.\nAnd there was always exposed to the Israeli informations in the papers and everywhere that was\nalways the corner, the sensitive corner of Jewish life, to find families, far families and families\nand friends from shtetl. Here they found a sister, here they found a brother after not knowing\nthat they survived, because they disappeared and they went to different corners of the world, to\nAustralia or to New Zealand and to Africa and wherever you want, you have everywhere people\nin the world. So when they start to come somehow together it was more exposed in the reality of\ncourse, with this knowledge it came always a history and development of knowledge about\nHolocaust, how it came to it, and this opened the door to more knowledge about the Holocaust.\n38",
        "A: My personal life was never involved with any Arabs. With any Arabs, I didn\u2019t\nknow. Well, I can say that I knew nothing, but from the press and visiting to go to the South to\nBeersheba and passing some villages where Arabs was living going to Nazareth. If you go to see\nthe country, you met the Arabs and their way of living. But in my place where I lived there was\nno Arabs at all. At that given time there was no Arabs. In Tel Aviv, for example, there was a\nsection which was Jaffa, the port of Jaffa, the old port of Jaffa is the oldest port in the\nMediterranean. There are living Arabs until today. The majority of them are Arabs and they are\nChristian Arabs and there are Muslim Arabs. There are churches, there are mosques. So when\nyou are going to Tel Aviv, because there is not separation between Tel Aviv and Givataim,\nGivataim was on the rand (ph) of Tel Aviv, that\u2019s like a suburb of Tel Aviv. And then when you\nwant to go for a good meal, you went to Jaffa there. Good restaurants. Were Arab restaurants.\nAnd Oriental Jews opened oriental restaurants. So this is the way where you came together with\nthe Arab world. You want to go to buy some fresh fish in the harbor there. So you could buy it\nat Arab fishers there. There were Jewish fishers, too. But generally we didn\u2019t have any, any,\nany connection and live together with the Arabs. We knew from the press and we knew from the\nmedias how they live and where they live and what their problems are, but we didn\u2019t have\nnothing in common, nothing in common. You came to Jerusalem, of course, after the Liberation,\nI mean after the Six-Day War there, western part of Israel, or Jerusalem which they annected. So\nyou learned something. When you came to Jerusalem before when it was divided, you came\nalways to the gate, where we saw the Arabs here. It was always a danger to approach close\nbecause there were shootings.",
        "A: I went to Poland after, to be exact, about after fifty years.",
        "A: After fifty years I went to Poland. The second time I went after three years.",
        "A: Something like this, yes.",
        "A: We decide to go, when the parents of our good friends which live here in Kentucky came to visit\nhere. It was a very old Krakow family which knew the business of Fryda\u2019s parents and he by\nhimself helped one Jew to survive. And they are very, very nice people. We met them and\nbecame friendly, very friendly. They really embraced us and they asked us to come to Poland, to\nbe their guests there. And to see, you will see it is not so bad. Just try, come and you will see\nyour sights. That was one thing. The other thing was we wanted to see our savior, this\nMuschau, who got his righteous papers there, and his family. We wanted to see him because he\nwas older than we are and we wanted to see him alive still. We supported him from Israel. We\nwere sending parcels and money from time to time. And we supported him and he was very\n39\nthankful. They were not rich people, very poor peasants. And he also wrote us that he will be\nhappy to see us. So we decided we will go, we will see how it is. We went there and as I told\nyou maybe before, I was a member of Rotary International in Israel and I became a member of\nRotary here in Lexington, too. And as a Rotarian you are obliged to visit a club wherever you\ngo. You should go to meet. Rotary have to come together, whoever it is. The Rotary in\nprinciple, Rotary has to have the best people. That\u2019s what the principle of Rotary is. And we\nwent there to see Rotary in Krakow on their meeting. And one of the members was a Jesuit\npriest, who was a professor at the University there. And he was a doctor of biology and a doctor\nof philosophy. A very bright person. After I had my speech there, at Rotary they are always\nasking guest Rotarian to give his impression and his greetings from his club to bring there. He\ncame to me, and we became very friendly, very friendly. So that even when I came back to the\nUnited States, we were writing to each other. I have maybe fifty letters from him, which he\nwrote to me and I wrote to him exchanging of some ideas. He was very fond of the Jewish\nreligion and of Judaism. Which I, I have studied a lot about Judaism, biblical Judaism and\nTalmudic Judaism. So I could give him some answers. We had some very, very interesting talks\nabout this subject. We had a very good time there. We went there to the village. One of our\nPolish friends which we became friendly, he visited here with the University of Kentucky for a\nyear. We became friendly and he invited to visit him in Krakow. And he went with his car with\nus to these villages where we used to be in hiding there. And we went there and met the people.\nThere was a very exciting experience. And we really enjoyed to see this everything from\nperspective, it gives us some good feeling that we could do it. And therefore we went for the\nsecond time, too.",
        "A: Yes, we saw Muschau for himself.",
        "A: No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all. Except these people here from the United States which we\nmet here and this people who visited here and the Jesuit priest which we visited, otherwise we\ndidn\u2019t have.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we saw them. We saw both sons. They were, well, they were very touched. Madame\nSoltys didn\u2019t live anymore, she was gone. The second time we were even the Soltys son, the\noldest son passed away, too. Only the youngest son, Kazimierz Soltys, which writes us until\ntoday and we send him from time to time some money. Otherwise no.\n40",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t meet more people. I will tell you, I didn\u2019t want these people to have different\nfeelings, that I was Jewish and they couldn\u2019t know and could even help me, maybe they will be\nsorry that they did it. I don\u2019t want to put them in this conflict. I don\u2019t know. You can never\nknow human thinkings, human spirits, human soul. You never know. I don\u2019t want to hurt\npeople.",
        "A: Yes, my visit was very good. Short. Very good. Well, we experienced one a very, very peculiar\nexperience while we were walking in Krakow. In the market place, in the most important place\nin Krakow, in the most beautiful place in Krakow and I am not sure that the person who did it\nknew that we are Jewish and it wasn\u2019t directed to us. I think because this person run away from\nthe market, screaming, \u201cDeath to the Jews.\u201d And that was a very, very strange feeling, very,\nvery strange feeling. I couldn\u2019t blame my friends. I couldn\u2019t blame nobody. Maybe some\ncrazy. You never know what people are able to do and who they are.\nEnd of Tape 4, Side B\n4]\nTape 5, Side A",
        "A: Because I was talking about Krakow, about the unpleasant what happens to me, I will try to\nmake some remarks about the Sharoka (ph) which 1s called the high street. And there is the\noldest synagogue in Europe, called before the world the Alte Shul. And there is now a Jewish\nmuseum. There is another thing there on this street, which is one of the oldest, maybe oldest too,\nmaybe in the same time. I don\u2019t know exactly. The Remu Shul, the shul which is named after\nReb Isserls, which was a Rabbi in Krakow in the, I guess it was in the fifteenth century if I am\nnot wrong. There is still a shul and there are still Jews coming and there is a minyan and praying\nin Shabbas. And they\u2019re of course coming curious. And there is always a meeting of Jews who\ncome visit Krakow. They are always coming there. And the site of this shul is the old cemetery\nwhich a gravestone of this famous Rabbi, Rabbi Isserls. They called the shul and they called the\nRabbi \u201cRemu\u2019. Rabbi Moshe Isserls. About him, used to say, \u201cFrom Moses, to Moses was not\nlike Moses Isserls.\u201d Was a very great Rabbi, who corrected one of the main Jewish religious\nbooks, the Shulchan Aruch, on which the Jews, the Western Jews were living their daily life.\nThat was included every point of life from the Jews. But I will go back to the museum. There\nare remnants from Jews in Krakow. There were several severed Torahs, Bibles, and all kind of\nreligious utilities. And last but not least, there are many photos of old Jewish life in Krakow.\nAnd we were there for a Shabbat prayer at the Remu Synagogue which I mentioned before. And\nthere were a minyan, there were even a group of young students from Canada came to visit\nPoland and they were visiting this shul and sitting all the pray and praying. And another thing\nwhich is to see of Jewish life, there is a Jewish cultural center on the Meilzel (ph) Street. A\nfoundation of Canadian Jew, a , and there are also kind of all Jewish life in the\npast and the present Jewish life. And they are cultural meetings. There are coming writers and\nmeeting there and presenting their books. And there are Jewish books there in this unit there.",
        "A: To answer this question 1s not easy. From a historical point of view I\u2019m sure Jews will live in\nPoland. First of all because of the root, of the roots. It may be even second, third, fourth and\nfifth generation, they have their Jewish ballast, if you want to say, which asks them to go back to\nthe sources. This is one thing. The second thing 1s, of the globalization of the world. The world\nis globalizing. It has united Europe. In another few years if it will continue this way there will\nno be borders between European countries. It will be a united Europe and Jews are living in\nEurope and will live in Europe. We have the best example, Spain. The Jews were driven in the\nfifteenth century from Spain and there are Jews living there. There is a Jewish life in Spain.\nAnd there will be everywhere. There is Jewish life in Germany. We may not like it. We may\nnot want it. But life is stronger than all our views. May it be political, philosophical, whatever it\nis, life has his right. Bread is easier. Where life is easier, people will always go. And that\u2019s my\nview. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I don\u2019t know. But I am sure and I know that the last visit of the Pope\nin Israel gives a great contribution to somehow living together, Catholics and Jews. It is maybe\nironic that in general even in the United States, people, Jewish people in general are more\n42\ninvolved in general Christianity, maybe less in Catholic. Because there is a minority of\nCatholics. But Poland is ninety percent Catholics. And the Pope, his origin is Wadowice in\nPoland. And he was during the war behaving as a fellow Semite. And he now with his visit in\nIsrael and his approach to the problem of Jewish\u2014Christian connection, I think opens more the\ndoor for Jews to go back to Poland. Maybe I am wrong, maybe I am right. It is still a stereotype\nof American Jews which have a guilty feeling that they didn\u2019t do nothing, nothing in time of the\nHolocaust to help their brothers. That they are putting all the guilt of the Holocaust on Polish\npeople. I know the truth is that the majority of extermination, gas chambers and so forth was in\nthe Polish territory. But I find my very answer, I think the main reason is that it was much easier\nfor the Germans to make it where the biggest concentration of the Jews were. There was, in\nPoland was more Jews than all over the world. So instead to go to Holland or to go to Belgium\nor to go to Germany, of course they didn\u2019t want to take them because they were ashamed to\nbring the Jews to Germany. So I mean to this other little countries, to bring million of Jews it\nwas for them impossible. Impossible. Physically it was impossible. Maybe it would be good if\nthey had come to this idea. But their idea was to do this fast, fast and more able to do it was in\nPoland That\u2019s my opinion. Maybe I am wrong, but that is the reason. And of course, there is\nsomething to it that in Poland were no many objection to it. But there is another answer, Poland\nwas the biggest country of this all occupied territories except France. But France has its own\nAnti-Semitic history, so we can put it in another perspective.",
        "A: It is like I said, it\u2019s a very, very difficult answer. Maybe yes, maybe no. The yes is I would like\nto be the first one, not the second, not the third, not the fifth. But if I live fifty years and there\nwill be a community of a million Jews, I am not sure if I would not prefer to live in Poland. Well\nof course, my first priority is Israel, but I don\u2019t know what will happen to Israel in the next\nfuture. Iam very worrying and it is one of my greatest pains to think about, about a bad outcome\nof this situation. I don\u2019t want to be a prophet and I don\u2019t want to put my words in tapes or in\nhistory. But I am very afraid of the, what happens in Israel.",
        "A: It is the same question like you ask me before.",
        "A: If I am living in the United States, it is the most wonderful place to live. If you ask me to live\nbetween Jews and the United States, I am not comfortable with it. I was more comfortable in\nJews to live in Israel or to live in Poland. And there is a reason to it and it is very difficult to\nraise out from history the past and the relations between American Jews and world Jewry at all.\nIt is a very difficult task. And even now, with their best will, with their greatest contribution to\nIsrael\u2014which 1s a feeling of guilt, of course\u2014the relations between old American Jews and the\nnew American Jews, except this which became very rich and involved in commerce and science\nand so forth, but the Jewish volks, volks... that means the Jewish Jews. The Jewish Jews which\n43\nare speaking still Jewish, which are reading Jewish books and they have the Jewish folklore and\nthey still have the memory, the heritage of European Jewry, 1s still differentiated.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m an American, loyal American, a loyal citizen and I know about what happened in the\nUnited States, politically and socially and I am very involved. I mean spiritually, because\nphysically I can\u2019t more. But I was a member and I still am a member, but not so supportive as I\nwas, I am a Republican. I cannot say I don\u2019t like Democrats because they are democratic. But I\ndon\u2019t like Democrats because they are more socialistic. And whatever smells of socialism or\ncommunism is for me, a red flag. And this is also a part of my Israeli past, which was the Labor\nparty, which was the priority movement for many years. And still they are trying to be, I don\u2019t\nknow what the outcome will be. Barak\u2019 is a Socialist and a member of the Socialist Labor party.\nAnd so are many of the desert members. And I don\u2019t like the religious extremists in the same\nway like I don\u2019t like the liberal extremists. I am used to a middle way, to a way of tolerance and\nliving in harmony with everybody.",
        "A: In 1980.",
        "A: Do I come?",
        "A: Yeah, because my son was living in Kentucky, I came to Kentucky.",
        "A: Well, I came to the United States before I came to Lexington. I came to New York several\ntimes. And I make tours in Canada and California and Florida. I make Caribbean. And I knew\nabout American life and I met American people. I had my own idea about America. And my\nidea about Jewish America didn\u2019t change from the beginning until today. However my two\nbrothers are living here since \u201848, here. But they are still Polish Jews. They are Americans, but\nthey are Polish Jews. That\u2019s what I meant before what I said.",
        "A: Jewish Americans are Jews which speak Yiddish, love Israel, enjoy their life in the United\nStates, are good citizens here and live a Jewish life. It mustn\u2019t be Orthodox, it mustn\u2019t be strictly\nreligious, but humanitarian Jewish life, with everybody humanistic. That is my Jewish life, very\nhumanistic. Our great Rabbi and teacher, however it is a Rabbi, but a great Rabbi, the Orthodox\nRabbi, when it came to he, to him one famous gentile person. \u201cI will become a Jew if you will\n' Ehud Barak, Prime Minister of Israel from 1999 to 2001.\nAd\nteach me the Torah, how long I will stand on one leg.\u201d He says, \u201cNo problem, love your\nneighbor as yourself. This is whole Jewish religion and whole Jewish Torah, the most important\nthing.\u201d And that\u2019s what it is, what I mean, a Jewish American or an American American or a\nPolish American. Love the people who you are live with and you have to live with and\neverybody to see a human being. That\u2019s my opinion.",
        "A: Yes, I am a member of the conservative movement. I accept it. There were asked about many\nthings which they change in the meantime when I approach the synagogue. There were no\nwomen called to the Torah. There were no women Rabbis. Now there is. But if they ask my\nopinion and I said, I will not be an exception. I am for the majority. You decided that you want\nit this way, I will agree. But not that I am fond of it, not that I like it. And that it my opinion.",
        "A: No, they have to have more liberal. But I still cannot accept a woman going to the Rabbi,\nbecause it is against the Halachic teachings. I mean, I accept it, but I don\u2019t find it nice. And the\nteaching there is, if a woman is not clean, she shouldn\u2019t come between the community. She is\nnot clean, that means when she has her menstruation. Only after she goes, she has menstruation,\nafter she finished and take a ritual bath, she is clean. And she is even with everybody. I don\u2019t\nsay she is not even, I don\u2019t say this is a dirtiness or an illness, but it\u2019s against the teachings of our\nsages. And if you go on to take off barriers one by one, officially as permissible, you take the\nbalance off Jewish religion. One of the two. You want to be Jewish you have to follow the\nteachings. Even when you don\u2019t follow, but you don\u2019t have to revolutionize it. That what I\nthink. Iam not kosher, for example. I am not doing a lot of things. I am riding on Shabbat. But\nmy opinion it is in those times, Shabbat there was no cars to ride on Shabbot. There was no\nelectricity to light. There was many things which I found it. But that\u2019s for me, but I don\u2019t say it\nis permissible. It 1s not permissible, but I find it, I can do it. If somebody doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s not\nmy problem. It\u2019s his problem. But I can do it. I can do everything which I found, in my\nopinion, it is an answer which is logic.",
        "A: Well, I can say really friends are non-Jewish. This is the majority. Maybe there are some\nnumbers really which I can say they are not Jewish. Three, four families maybe or something\nlike this. But not to count as a really friend. These are really the Polish people, which are\nhelping me in need, when I had to go to an emergency, I call to the Polish people. They come\neven in the middle of the night and they bring me to Emergency. My wife is not driving and\nthey bring me. I don\u2019t have to go in ambulance. And other things also, they are really good\nfriends. So, I really don\u2019t differentiate it. Because you ask me I say they are accidentally Polish\nor Christian or Catholics and they are accidentally not. But they are my friends and they are my\nfriends, but not because of they are Polish, because they are Catholics or they are Christians. I\ndon\u2019t know if I have even one Catholic, exception of Polish people.\n45",
        "A: I was talking several times in school, whoever invite me to give them, I give them my own\nexperience. But there was now a Remembrance day in the St. Luke church where there are\nmembers, two or three Christians which are my friends. And they are always counting on me\nthat I will be the speaker. And I for nine years will be making the Remembrance. They make it\nthis year, too and I went to them, I don\u2019t know I show it to you or you have it? No? I promise\nyou to give it to you, my talk. I have to make a copy. I forgot to make a copy. I will give it to\nyou someday if you will ask for it. And they make it in such a honorable day that was really a\npleasure to talk to these people and to explain to them, this time I spoke generally about the\nsituation. In the previous I gave from my personal experiences. And they are always anxious\nand they are...\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\n46\nTape 5, Side B",
        "A: Well, you asked me if I spoke to people. I must tell you, to my disappointment... I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe not disappointment, but take the reality like it is. I didn\u2019t have occasion to say my\nopinion or even something about the Holocaust to Jewish people. If they invited me to the\nTemple when there was Remembrance Day, they were asking me to light a candle. That was all.\nAnd they were making some prayers. And the same was here in our synagogue, when they\nmake. And they come such a small number of people that it is really not worth it even to open\nyour mouth to talk to them. But I wasn\u2019t asked to talk about the Holocaust. I wasn\u2019t asked.\nThey talk, they make some prayers and that\u2019s all. And that was very miserable, miserable. I was\nashamed that I was a part of this Remembrance Day. And that\u2019s it. Jews are not interested in it.\nMaybe they have it enough in books. Maybe they read about it, if that\u2019s possible. I don\u2019t know.\nBut even when it is written, even when they read about it, I think, in my opinion, they have an\nopportunity to hear it from the first source. They should ask to hear of it, they should. But I\ndon\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t. Very ignorant, very ignorant. And then they are not interested.\nThe people, the few people who survive, they are not interested, because they know the same,\nthey have their opinion. And the other people are here, born here or for years are here, they are\nalready, they are already accustomed of the American habits, of the Jewish habits. That\u2019s what it\nis. They are not interested.",
        "A: Well, I feel it, I feel 1t maybe personally, but I don\u2019t blame them. Maybe they were expecting\nmore involvement from my side in their community life, which I couldn\u2019t do, first of my age,\nsecondly my language is not good enough to expose my... it is maybe improved already, but in\nthe beginning my English was good to read, to understand. But to speak with my accent, to talk\nabout my experience and to be active in their community, it wasn\u2019t easy. It was maybe difficult.\nI even proposed and asked the Rabbi I can help him with the Hebrew lessons in the Sunday\nschool maybe. But he never asked me. And nobody did ask me to give a hand to something like\nthat. Maybe to a money drive, maybe they will ask me to do it, but that\u2019s not my specialty. I\nwill not do it. And that\u2019s one thing. The other thing is, which one influential person told me,\nthat they feel humiliated in my company. That I am too special for them, so therefore they are\nhesitating approach me. Well, I don\u2019t know what is true, what the reason 1s, but this is the reality\nwhat I told you. Iam a stranger for them and I will remain always to them a stranger. However\nthey are friendly. If I approach them they answer my questions, but that\u2019s all, that\u2019s all. What\ncan you do? That\u2019s the reality. And you have to live with it and we take it. And we learn after\nso many years of life, you learn to live with the reality, with each reality. This is the main source\nof our strength, to take the everyday reality in our life as custom life. And that\u2019s it.\n47",
        "A: Again, I don\u2019t know who will hear this tape, but in the meantime there will be more business in\nthis field. You know, each community tries to make a museum, a Holocaust museum, which in\nitself is maybe a nice deed. But who will come to this museum? I think the Holocaust museum\nwhich is in Washington is the one which was a necessity, very important. And it fills all the\nspectrum of Holocaust and of Jewish life, before the war, in the war and after the war. Maybe\nthere are some nuances which come out which are not of value. But to make so many, I think\npeople will not be interested to go to the main museum where they have everything. And this\nhappens because of the way how Jewish society is built in the United States. It has to be a\nsociety, it has to be a president, it has to be a vice-president, it has to be a secretary, it has to be\nmembers of the board and so forth and so forth. Maybe in itself it is as a social thing, maybe it is\ngood, maybe. But I think a majority of the raised funds goes to administrative use, the\npaperwork and to expenses which are not profit of the social needs of people who really needs\nthe help. That is what I think. And about commercializing the Holocaust, I think when you take\nthousand books and you put them in a computer and you take the essence, I think from these\nthousands you will make one book which includes everything. So there is no need, in my\nopinion, for so many editions, for so many work with it in... I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. Of\ncourse, you can see a lot of people who became very famous because of the Holocaust, very\nfamous. But I don\u2019t want to criticize them. I don\u2019t want to criticize nobody. But I think it is a\ncrime if somebody makes it only for the business.",
        "A: Well, I gave, I gave a sketch about my experiences and about how I see it. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\ndon\u2019t have, in general, what to say about. And especially to the future generations of Jewish\npeople. Maybe somebody will listen to it. Maybe somebody will try to understand my point of\nview. But it is in the moment, I am ninety years old and I passed through all kind of Jewish life\nwith joy and suffering. It is like one Jewish sage said: \u201cIt is good to be born a Jew. It\u2019s good to\ndie a Jew, but what do you do in the meantime, this is the problem.\u201d From the beginning until\nthe end, the Jews have a very rich historical experience of life, which many other religion or\ncommunities don\u2019t have. Not because they wanted, but the wind of history put the Jews in the\ncenter of cultural life. Even in the world. Not only in Germany, not only in Poland or in Russia\nor in Palestine or Spain or in the United States. Everywhere where the Jews were the center of\ncivilized life, of cultural life was concentrated in the Jewish communities or singles. Jewish\nNobel Prize winners, there were scientists in the United States in medical field, in general\nscience are not compatible to no one other people. Maybe this is the reason that the jealousy of\nother people brings them to hatred. I cannot wish that the Jews wouldn\u2019t concentrate of all this\nprogress and culture and civilization. A country they have to do everything possible what brings\nprogress to the world. But I am turning to the other point not to cover this with egocentric\nreligious or national use. To take it more in human general perspective and civilized ways. This\nis my advice and this is my way of thinking. And that, and we will remember this, this can\nmaybe, maybe some day bring to make us even with other nations in civilized world. That we\nwill not be scapegoats in any way, which we were during all our history from the beginning until\ntoday. To avoid it, listen what I said. Thank you.\n48\nConclusion of Interview\n49\n"
